{"id":43532,"no":11,"title":"11 ANATOMY CLASS","content":"To BOND\u0027S unspeakable relief, they put up that night at the smartest hotel in Kyoto, the Miyako. The comfortable bed, air-conditioning and Western-style lavatory on which one could actually sit were out of this world. Better still, Tiger said that unfortunately he had to dine with the Chief of Police of the prefecture and Bond ordered a pint of Jack Daniels and a double portion of-eggs Benedict to be brought up to his room. Then, from a belated sense of duty, he watched \u0027The Seven Detectives\u0027, a famous Japanese television series, failed to spot the villain, and went to bed and slept for twelve hours. \n The next morning, hungover and conscience-stricken, he obediently fell in with Tiger\u0027s plans that they should visit the oldest whore-house in Japan before a quick drive to Osaka for the day\u0027s journey across the Inland Sea to the southern island of Kyushu. \u0027Bit early for visiting a whore-house,\u0027 had been his only comment. \n Tiger laughed. \u0027It is a matter of deep regret to me that your baser instincts should always be in the ascendancy, Bondo-san. Prostitution is now illegal in Japan. What we are about to visit is a national monument.\u0027 \n \u0027Oh, good show!\u0027 \n There was a deal of bowing and hissing at the whore-house, a spacious establishment in the now defunct red lamp street of the ancient capital, and they were presented with handsomely bound descriptive booklets by the earnest curator. They wandered over polished floors from chamber to chamber, and gravely inspected the sword cuts in the wooden supports that had been inflicted, according to Tiger, by samurai infuriated by lust and impatience. Bond inquired how many actual bedrooms there had been. It seemed to him that the whole place was taken up by a vast kitchen and many dining-rooms. \n \u0027Four rooms,\u0027 answered the curator. \n \u0027That\u0027s no way to run a whore-house,\u0027 commented Bond. \u0027You need quick throughput, like a casino.\u0027 \n \u0027Bondo-san,\u0027 complained Tiger. \u0027Please try and put out of your mind comparisons between our way of life and yours. In former times, this was a place of rest and recreation. Food was served and there was music and story-telling. People would write tankas. Take that inscription on the wall. It says \"Everything is new tomorrow.\" Some man with a profound mind will have written that.\u0027 \n \u0027Then he threw his pen away and reached for his sword and shouted, \"When is room No. 4 going to be empty?\" National monument indeed! It\u0027s like in the new African States where they pretend the cannibal stewpot in the chief\u0027s hut was for cooking yams for the hungry children. Everyone tries to forget his rowdy past instead of being proud of it. Like we are of Bloody Morgan, or Nell Gwynne, for instance. The great murderer and the great whore are part of our history. You shouldn\u0027t try and pretend that your oldest whore-house is a sort of Stratford-on-Avon.\u0027 \n Tiger uttered an explosive laugh. \u0027Bondo-san, your comments on our Japanese way of life become more and more outrageous. Come, it is time to cleanse your mind in the salubrious breezes of the Inland Sea.\u0027 \n The Murasaki Maru was a very modern 3,ooo-ton ship with all the luxuries of an ocean liner. Crowds waved her goodbye as if the ship was setting off across the Atlantic instead of doing a day trip down the equivalent of a long lake. There was much throwing of paper streamers by groups bearing placards to show whom they represented - business outings, schools, clubs-part of the vast travelling population of Japan, for ever on the move, making an outing, visiting relatives or shrines, or just seeing the sights of the country. The ship throbbed grandly through the endless horned islands. Tiger said that there were fine whirlpools \u0027like great lavatory pans, specially designed for suicides\u0027 between some of these. Meanwhile, Tiger and Bond sat in the first class dining-room and consumed \u0027Hamlets\u0027 - ham omelets - and sake. Tiger was in a lecturing mood. He was determined to correct Bond\u0027s boorish ignorance of Japanese culture. \u0027Bondo-san, I wonder if I will ever get you to appreciate the nuances of the Japanese tanka, or of the haiku, which are the classical forms of Japanese verse. Have you ever heard of Basho, for instance?\u0027 \n \u0027No,\u0027 said Bond with polite interest. \u0027Who\u0027s he?\u0027 \n \u0027Just so,\u0027 said Tiger bitterly. \u0027And yet you would think me grossly uneducated if I had never heard of Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, Cervantes, Goethe. And yet Basho, who lived in the seventeenth century, is the equal of any of them.\u0027 \n \u0027What did he write?\u0027 \n \u0027He was an itinerant poet. He was particularly at home with the haiku, the verse of seventeen syllables.\u0027 Tiger assumed a contemplative expression. He intoned: \n \n \u0027In the bitter radish \n that bites into me, I feel \n the autumn wind. \n \n \u0027Does that not say anything to you? Or this: \n \n \u0027The butterfly is perfuming \n its wings, in the scent \n of the orchid. \n \n \u0027You do not grasp the beauty of that image?\u0027 \n \u0027Rather elusive compared to Shakespeare.\u0027 \n \n \u0027In the fisherman\u0027s hut \n mingled with dried shrimps \n crickets are chirping.\u0027 \n \n Tiger looked at him hopefully. \n \u0027Can\u0027t get the hang of that one,\u0027 said Bond apologetically. \n \u0027You do not catch the still-life quality of these verses? The flash of insight into humanity, into nature? Now, do me a favour, Bondo-san. Write a haiku for me yourself. I am sure you could get the hang of it. After all you must have had some education?\u0027 \n Bond laughed. \u0027Mostly in Latin and Greek. All about Caesar and Balbus and so on. Absolutely no help in ordering a cup of coffee in Rome or Athens after I\u0027d left school. And things like trigonometry, which I\u0027ve totally forgotten. But give me a pen and a piece of paper and I\u0027ll have a bash, if you\u0027ll forgive the bad joke.\u0027 Tiger handed them over and Bond put his head in his hands. Finally, after much crossing out and rewriting he said, \u0027Tiger, how\u0027s this? It makes just as much sense as old Basho and it\u0027s much more pithy.\u0027 He read out: \n \n \u0027You only live twice: \n Once when you are born \n And once when you look death in the face.\u0027 \n \n Tiger clapped his hands softly. He said with real delight, \u0027But that is excellent, Bondo-san. Most sincere.\u0027 He took the pen and paper and jotted some ideograms up the page. He shook his head. \u0027No, it won\u0027t do in Japanese. You have the wrong number of syllables. But it is a most honourable attempt.\u0027 He looked keenly at Bond. \u0027You were perhaps thinking of your mission?\u0027 \n \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 said Bond with indifference. \n \u0027It is weighing on your mind?\u0027 \n \u0027The practical difficulties are bound to do so. I have swallowed the moral principles involved. Things being as they are, I have to accept that the end justifies the means.\u0027 \n \u0027Then you are not concerned with your own safety?\u0027 \n \u0027Not particularly. I\u0027ve had worse jobs to do.\u0027 \n \u0027I must congratulate you on your stoicism. You do not appear to value your life as highly as most Westerners.\u0027 Tiger looked at him kindly. \u0027Is there perhaps a reaso\u0027n for that?\u0027 \n Bond was offhand. \u0027Not that I can think of. But for God\u0027s sake chuck it, Tiger 1 None of your Japanese brain-washing! More sake, and answer my question of yesterday. Why weren\u0027t those men disabled by those terrific slashes to the groin? That might be of some practical value to me instead of all this waffle about poetry.\u0027 \n Tiger ordered the sake. He laughed. \u0027Unfortunately you are too old to benefit. I would need to have caught you at the age of about fourteen. You see, it is this way. You know the sumo wrestlers? It is they who invented the trick many centuries ago. It is vital for them to be immune from damage to those parts of the body. Now, you know that, in men, the testicles, which until puberty have been held inside the body, are released by a particular muscle and descend between the legs?\u0027 \n \u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \u0027Well the sumo wrestler will have been selected for his profession by the time of puberty. Perhaps because of his weight and strength, or perhaps because he comes of a sumo family. Well, by assiduously massaging those parts, he is able, after much practice, to cause the testicles to re-enter the body up the inguinal canal down which they originally descended.\u0027 \n \u0027My God, you Japanese!\u0027 said Bond with admiration. \u0027You really are up to all the tricks. You mean he gets them right out of the way behind the bones of the pelvis or what not?\u0027 \n \u0027Your knowledge of anatomy is as vague as your appreciation for poetry, but that is more or less so, yes. Then, before a fight, he will bind up that part of the body most thoroughly to contain these vulnerable organs in their hiding-place. Afterwards, in the bath, he will release them to hang normally. I have seen them do it. It is a great pity that it is now too late for you to practise this art. It might have given you more confidence on your mission. It is my experience that agents fear most for that part of the body when there is fighting to be done or when they risk capture. These organs, as you know, are most susceptible to torture for the extraction of information.\u0027 \n \u0027Don\u0027t I know it!\u0027 said Bond from the heart. \u0027Some of our chaps wear a box when they think they\u0027re in for a rough house. I don\u0027t care for them. Too uncomfortable.\u0027 \n \u0027What is a box?\u0027 \n \u0027It is what our cricketers wear to protect those parts when they go out to bat. It is a light padded shield of aluminium.\u0027 \n \u0027I regret that we have nothing of that nature. We do not play cricket in Japan. Only baseball.\u0027 \n \u0027Lucky for you you weren\u0027t occupied by the British,\u0027 commented Bond. \u0027Cricket is a much more difficult and skilful game.\u0027 \n \u0027The Americans say otherwise.\u0027 \n \u0027Naturally. They want to sell you baseball equipment.\u0027 \n They arrived at Beppu in the southern island of Kyushu as the sun was setting. Tiger said that this was just the time to see the famous geysers and fumaroles of the little spa. In any case, there would be no time in the morning as they would have to start early for Fukuoka, their final destination. Bond shivered slightly at the name. The moment was rapidly approaching when the sake and sightseeing would have to stop. \n Above the town of Beppu, they visited in turn the ten spectacular \u0027hells\u0027 as they are officially designated. The stink of sulphur was disgusting, and each bubbling, burping nest of volcanic fumaroles was more horrific than the last. The steaming mud and belching geysers were of different colours - red, blue, and orange - and everywhere there were warning notices and skulls and crossbones to keep visitors at a safe distance. The tenth \u0027hell\u0027 announced in English and Japanese that there would be an eruption punctually every twenty minutes. They joined a small group of spectators under the arc lights that pinpointed a small quiescent crater in a rock area bespattered with mud. Sure enough, in five minutes, there came a rumbling from underground and a jet of steaming grey mud shot twenty feet up into the air and splashed down inside the enclosure. As Bond was turning away, he noticed a large red painted wheel, heavily padlocked and surrounded by wire-netting in a small separate enclosure. There were warning notices above it and a particularly menacing skull and crossbones. Bond asked Tiger what it was. \n \u0027It says that this wheel controls the pulse of the geyser. It says that if this wheel were screwed down it could result in the destruction of the entire establishment. It gives the explosive force of the volcano, if the exhaust valve of the geyser were to be closed, as the equivalent of a thousand pounds of TNT. It is, of course, all a bit of nonsense to attract the tourists. But now, back to the town, Bondo-sanl Since it is our last day together,\u0027 he added hastily, \u0027on this particular voyage, I have arranged a special treat. I ordered it by radio from the ship. A fugu feast!\u0027 \n Bond cursed silently. The memory of his eggs Benedict the night before was intolerably sweet. What new monstrosity was this? he asked. \n \u0027Fugu is the Japanese blow-fish. In the water, it looks like a brown owl, but when captured it blows itself up into a ball covered with wounding spines. We sometimes dry the skins and put candles inside and use them as lanterns. But the flesh is particularly delicious. It is the staple food of the sumo wrestlers because it is supposed to be very strength-giving. The fish is also very popular with suicides and murderers because its liver and sex glands contain a poison which brings death instantaneously.\u0027 \n \u0027That\u0027s just what I would have chosen for dinner. How thoughtful of you, Tiger.\u0027 \n \u0027Have no fear, Bondo-san. Because of the dangerous properties of the fish, every fugu restaurant has to be manned by experts and be registered with the State.\u0027 \n They left their bags at a Japanese inn where Tiger had reserved rooms, enjoyed the o-furo, honourable bath, together in the blue-tiled miniature swimming pool whose water was very hot and smelled of sulphur and then, totally relaxed, went off down the street leading to the sea. \n (Bond had become enamoured of the civilized, vaguely Roman, bathing habits of the Japanese. Was it because of these, because they washed outside the bath instead of wallowing in their own effluvia, that they all smelled so clean? Tiger said bluntly that, at the very best, Westerners smelled of sweet pork.) \n The restaurant had a giant blow-fish hanging as a sign above the door, and inside, to Bond\u0027s relief, there were Western-style chairs and tables at which a smattering of people were eating with the intense concentration of the Japanese. They were expected and their table had been prepared. Bond said, \u0027Now then, Tiger, I\u0027m not going to commit honourable suicide without at least five bottles of sake inside me.\u0027 The flasks were brought, all five of them, to the accompaniment of much tittering by the waitresses. Bond downed the lot, tumbler by tumbler, and expressed himself satisfied. \u0027Now you can bring on this blasted blow-fish,\u0027 he said belligerently, \u0027and if it kills me it will be doing a good turn to our friend the doctor in his castle.\u0027 \n A very beautiful white porcelain dish as big as a bicycle wheel was brought forward with much ceremony. On it were arranged, in the pattern of a huge flower, petal upon petal of a very thinly sliced and rather transparent white fish. Bond followed Tiger\u0027s example and set to with his chopsticks. He was proud of the fact that he had reached Black Belt standard with these instruments-the ability to eat an underdone fried egg with them. \n The fish tasted of nothing, not even of fish. But it was very pleasant on the palate and Bond was effusive in his compliments because Tiger, smacking his lips over each morsel, obviously expected it of him. There followed various side-dishes containing other parts of the fish, and more sake, but this time containing raw fugu fins. \n Bond sat back and lit a cigarette. He said, \u0027Well, Tiger. This is nearly the end of my education. Tomorrow you say I am to leave the nest. How many marks out of a hundred?\u0027 \n Tiger looked at him quizzically. \u0027You have done well, Bondo-san. Apart from your inclination to make Western jokes about Eastern customs. Fortunately I am a man of infinite patience, and I must admit that your company has given me much pleasure and a certain amount of amusement. I will award you seventy-five marks out of a possible hundred.\u0027 \n As they rose to go, a man brushed past Bond to get to the exit. He was a stocky man with a white masko over his mouth and he wore an ugly leather hat. The man on the train! \n Well, welll thought Bond. If he shows up on the last lap to Fukuoka, I\u0027ll get him. If not I\u0027ll reluctantly put it down to \u0027Funny Coincidence Department\u0027. But it looks like nought out of a hundred to Tiger for powers of observation. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584/47093.html","bookId":1266,"book":{"id":1266,"title":"007之雷霆谷 You Only Live Twice","description":"简介： 一天，美国太空船遭到了不明飞行物的攻击，美方怀疑是苏联的阴谋，目的是想独霸太空。美方测出了不明飞行物的降落地点是在日本，于是英国军方派出007（肖恩康纳利SeanConnery饰）前往日本替美方调查此事。由于007的身份特殊，直接进入日本容易被敌人察觉。为了掩人耳目...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/21/09-23-13-33-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
