{"id":43526,"no":5,"title":"5 MAGIC 44","content":"DIKKO HENDERSON came to fetch Bond at ten o\u0027clock next morning. He was considerably overhung. The hard blue eyes were veined with blood and he made straight for the Bamboo Bar and ordered himself a double brandy and ginger ale. Bond said mildly, \u0027You shouldn\u0027t have poured all that sake on top of the Suntory. I can\u0027t believe Japanese whisky makes a good foundation for anything.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got something there, sport. I\u0027ve got myself a proper futsukayoi - honourable hangover. Mouth like a vulture\u0027s crutch. Soon as we got home from that lousy cat house, I had to go for the big spit. But you\u0027re wrong about Suntory. It\u0027s a good enough brew. Stick to the cheapest, the White Label, at around fifteen bob a bottle. There are two smarter brands, but the cheap one\u0027s the best. Went up to the distillery some whiles ago and met one of the family. Told me an interesting thing , about whisky. He said you can only make good whisky where you can take good photographs. Ever heard that one? Said it was something to do with the effect of clear light on the alcohol. But did I talk a lot of crap last night? Or did you? Seem to recollect that one of us did.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You only gave me hell about the state of the world and called me a poofter. But you were quite friendly about it. No offence given or taken.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh, Christ!\u0027 Dikko Henderson gloomily pushed a hand through his tough, grizzled hair. \u0027But I didn\u0027t hit anyone?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Only that girl you slapped so hard on the bottom that she fell down.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh that!\u0027 said Dikko Henderson with relief. \u0027That was just a love-pat. What\u0027s a girl\u0027s bottom for, anyway? And so far as I recall they all screamed with laughter. Including her. Right? How did you make out with yours by the way? She looked pretty enthusiastic.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027She was.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Good show.\u0027 He swallowed the remains of his drink and got to his feet. \u0027Come on, bud. Let\u0027s go. Wouldn\u0027t do to keep Tiger waiting. I once did and he wouldn\u0027t speak to me for a week.\u0027 \\n\\n It was a typical Tokyo day in late summer - hot, sticky and grey - the air full of fine dust from the endless demolition and reconstruction work. They drove for\u0027 half an hour towards Yokohama and pulled up outside a dull grey building which announced itself in large letters to be \u0027The Bureau of All-Asian Folkways\u0027. There was a busy traffic of Japanese scurrying in and out through the bogusly important-looking entrance, but no one glanced at Dikko and Bond, and they were not asked their business as Dikko led the way through an entrance hall where there were books and postcards on sale as if the place were some kind of museum. Dikko made for a doorway marked \u0027Coordination Department\u0027 and there was a long corridor with open rooms on both sides. The rooms were full of studious-looking young men at desks. There were large wall maps with coloured pins dotted across them, and endless shelves of books. A door marked \u0027International Relations\u0027 gave on to another corridor, this time lined with closed doors which had people\u0027s names on them in English and Japanese. A sharp right turn took them through the \u0027Visual Presentation Bureau\u0027 with more closed doors, and on to \u0027Documentation\u0027, a large hall-shaped library with more people bent over desks. Here, for the first time, they were scrutinized by a man at a desk near the entrance. He rose to his feet and bowed wordlessly. As they walked on Dikko said quietly, \u0027This is where the cover tapers off. Up till now, all those people really were researching Asian Folkways. But these here are part of Tiger\u0027s outside staff, doing more or less classified work. Sort of archivists. This is where we\u0027d be politely turned back if we\u0027d lost our way.\u0027 Behind a final wall of bookshelves that stretched out into the room a small door was concealed. It was marked \u0027Proposed Extension to Documentation Department. Danger! Construction work in progress\u0027. From behind it came the sound of drills, a circular saw cutting through the wood and other building noises. Dikko walked through the door into a totally empty room with a highly-polished wood floor. There was no sign of construction work. Dikko laughed at Bond\u0027s surprise. He gestured towards a large metal box fitted to the back of the door through which they had come. \u0027Tape recorder,\u0027 he said. \u0027Clever gimmick. Sounds just like the real thing. And this\u0027 - he pointed to the stretch of bare floor ahead - \u0027is what the Japanese call a \"nightingale floor\". Relic of the old days when people wanted to be warned of intruders. Serves the same purpose here. Imagine trying to get across here without being heard.\u0027 They set off, and immediately the cunningly sprung boards gave out penetrating squeaks and groans. In a small facing door, a spy-hole slid open and one large eye surveyed them. The door opened to reveal a stocky man in plain clothes who had been sitting at a small deal table reading a book. It was a tiny box-like room that seemed to have no other exit. The man bowed. Dikko said some phrases containing the words \u0027Tanaka-san\u0027. The man bowed again. Dikko turned to Bond. \u0027You\u0027re on your own now. Be in it, champ! Tiger\u0027ll send you back to your hotel. See you.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said, \u0027Tell Mother I died game,\u0027 and walked into the little box and the door was closed behind him. There was a row of buttons by the desk and the guard pressed one of them. There came a barely perceptible whine and Bond got the impression of descent. So the room was a lift. What a box of tricks the formidable Tiger had erected as a screen for himself! The authentic Eastern nest of boxes. What next? \\n\\n The descent continued for some time. When it stopped, the guard opened the door and Bond stepped out and stood stock still. He was standing on the platform of an underground station! There it all was: the red and green signals over the two yawning tunnels, the conventional white tiles on the walls and the curved roof - even an empty cigarette kiosk let into the wall beside him! A man had come out of this. He now said in good English, \u0027Please to follow me, Commander,\u0027 and led the way through an arch marked \u0027Exit\u0027. But here all the floor space of the hall that would one day lead to the moving stairways was occupied by trim prefabricated offices on both sides of a wide corridor. Bond was led into the first of these which revealed itself as a waiting-room and outer office. A male secretary rose from his typewriter, bowed and went through a communicating door. He immediately reappeared, bowed again and held the door open. \u0027Please to come this way, Commander.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond went through and the door was softly closed behind him. The big square figure that Dikko had described to him came forward across the handsome red carpet and held out a hand that was hard and dry. \u0027My dear Commander. Good morning. It is a great pleasure to meet you.\u0027 The wide, gold-toothed smile signalled welcome. The eyes glittered between long dark lashes that were almost feminine. \u0027Come and sit down. How do you like my offices? Rather different from your own Chief\u0027s, no doubt. But the new underground will take another ten years to complete and there is little office space in Tokyo. It crossed my mind to make use of this disused station. It is quiet. It is private. It is also cool. I shall be sorry when the trains are required to run and we shall have to move out.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond took the proffered chair across the empty desk from Tanaka. \u0027It\u0027s a brilliant idea. And I enjoyed the Folkways above our heads. Are there really so many people in the world interested in Folkways?\u0027 \\n\\n Tiger Tanaka shrugged. \u0027What does it matter? The literature is given away free. I have never asked the Director who reads it. Americans, I expect, and Germans. Perhaps some Swiss. The serious-minded can always be found for such stuff. It is an expensive conceit, of course. But fortunately the expense is not carried by the Ministry of Internal Affairs with whom I am concerned. Down here, we have to count our pennies. I suppose it is the same with your own budget.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond assumed that this man would know the published facts of the Secret Service Vote. He said, \u0027Under ten million pounds a year doesn\u0027t go far when there is the whole world to cover.\u0027 \\n\\n The teeth glistened under the neon strip lighting. \u0027At least for the last ten years you have saved money by closing down your activities in this part of the world.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes. We rely on the CIA to do our work here for us. They are most efficient and helpful.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027As much so under McCone as under Dulles?\u0027 \\n\\n The old fox! \u0027Nearly so. Nowadays they are even more inclined to regard the Pacific as their own back garden.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027From which you wish to borrow the mowing machine. Without them knowing.\u0027 Tiger\u0027s smile was even more tigerish. \\n\\n Bond had to laugh. The wily devil had certainly been putting two and two together. When Bond laughed, Tiger also laughed, but carefully. Bond said, \u0027We had a man called Captain Cook and various others who discovered much of this garden. Australia and New Zealand are two very great countries. You must admit that our interest in this half of the world is perfectly legitimate.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027My dear Commander. You were lucky that we struck at Pearl Harbour rather than at Australia. Can you doubt that we would have occupied that country and New Zealand if we had done otherwise? These are big and important land spaces, insufficiently developed. You could not have defended them. The Americans would not have. If our policy had been different, we would now own half the British Commonwealth. Personally, I have never understood the strategy behind Pearl Harbour. Did we wish to conquer America? The supply lines were too long. But Australia and New Zealand were ripe for the plucking.\u0027 He pushed forward a large box of cigarettes. \u0027Do you smoke? These are Shinsei. It is an acceptable brand.\u0027 \\n\\n James Bond was running out of his Morland specials. He would soon have to start on the local stuff. He also had to collect his thoughts. This was rather like being involved in a Summit meeting between the United Kingdom and Japan. He felt way out of his depth. He took a cigarette and lit it. It burned rapidly with something of the effect of a slow-burning firework. It had a vague taste of American blends, but it was good and sharp on the palate and lungs like 90 proof spirits. He let the smoke out in a quiet hiss and smiled. \u0027Mr Tanaka, ? these are matters for political historians. I am concerned with much lower matters. And matters concerning the future rather than the past.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I quite understand, Commander.\u0027 Tiger Tanaka was obviously displeased that his game of generalities had been dodged by Bond. \u0027But we have a saying \"Speak of next year and the devil laughs\". The future is inscrutable. But tell me, what are your impressions of Japan? You have been enjoying yourself?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I imagine that one always enjoys oneself with Dikko Henderson.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes, he is a man who lives as if he were going to die tomorrow. This is a correct way to live. He is a good friend of mine. I greatly enjoy his company. We have certain tastes in common.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said ironically, \u0027Folkways?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Exactly.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027He has a great affection for you. I do not know him well, but I suspect that he is a lonely man. It is an unfortunate combination to be both lonely and intelligent. Wouldn\u0027t it be a good thing for him to marry a Japanese girl and settle down? Couldn\u0027t you find him one?\u0027 Bond was pleased that the conversation had descended to personalities. He sensed that he was on the right track. At least on a better track than this talk about power politics. But there would come a bad moment when he would have to get down to business. He didn\u0027t care for the prospect. \\n\\n As if he had sensed this, Tiger Tanaka said, \u0027I have arranged for our friend to meet many Japanese girls. The result in every case has been negative, or, at the best, fleeting. But tell me, Commander. We have not met here to discuss Mr Henderson\u0027s private life. In what respect can I be of service to you? Is it the lawn mower?\u0027 \\n\\n Bond smiled. \u0027It is. The manufacturers\u0027 trade mark for this particular implement is MAGIC 44.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Ah yes. A most valuable implement of many uses. I can understand that your country would wish to have the services of this implement. A case in point is an example of its capabilities which came into my hands only this morning.\u0027 Tiger Tanaka opened a drawer in his desk and extracted a file. It was a pale green file stamped in a square box with the word GOKUHI in black Japanese and Roman characters. Bond assumed this to be the equivalent of Top Secret. He put this to Mr Tanaka who confirmed it. Mr Tanaka opened the file and extracted two sheets of yellow paper. Bond could see that one was covered with Japanese ideograms and that the other had perhaps fifty lines of typewriting. Mr Tanaka slipped the typewritten one across the desk. He said, \u0027May I beg you on oath not to reveal to anyone what you are about to read?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027If you insist, Mr Tanaka.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I am afraid I must, Commander.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027So be it.\u0027 Bond drew the sheet of paper towards him. The text was in English. This is what it said: \\n\\n TO ALL STATIONS OF GRADE TWO AND ABOVE. TO BE DECIPHERED BY ADDRESSEE PERSONALLY AND THEN DESTROYED.

He let out his breath in a quiet hiss. He reached for the box of Shinsei and lit one, drawing the harsh smoke deep down into his lungs. He raised his eyes to Mr Tanaka\u0027s, which were regarding him with polite interest. \u0027I suppose Number One is Khrushchev?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027That is correct, and the meaning of stations grade two and above is consulates general and embassies. It is interesting material, is it not?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027It is a mistake that you are keeping this material from us. We have a treaty of friendship and a trade treaty with you. Do you not regard the withholding of this vital information as a dishonourable act?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Honour is a very serious word in Japan, Commander. Would it not be even more dishonourable to break our word to our good American friends? They have several times assured me and my government that any information of vital importance to our other friends and allies will be passed on to them in such a way as not to divulge the source. I have no evidence that they are not pursuing this routine.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You know as well as I do, Mr Tanaka, that rewriting and doctoring to conceal the source reduces this type of material to a grade no higher than secret reports from countless other \"delicate and reliable\" sources. The nature of this particular source, the fact that one is reading the very words of the enemy, is at least fifty per cent of the value of the information this message contains. No doubt Washington will pass on a garbled version of this message to London. I hope they already have. But you realize that it might be in their interests to keep quiet about this terrible threat that hangs over England? At the same time, it is in England\u0027s interest to use every hour in devising some counter to this plan. One small step, which at once comes to mind, is preparations for the internment of all Soviet citizens in Britain at the first sign of the evacuation measures mentioned in the message.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I appreciate your point of view, Commander. There is of course, in this instance, an alternative route for this information to reach your government.\u0027 Mr Tanaka\u0027s face crinkled wickedly. \\n\\n Bond leant urgently over the desk. \u0027But I gave my word of honour!\u0027 \\n\\n Mr Tanaka\u0027s face underwent a curious change. All the upward lines turned downwards. The dark eyes lost their glitter and assumed an inward look. In a curious way, the whole face slumped into melancholy. He said, \u0027Commander, I was very happy in England. Your people were very good to me. I repaid them in an unworthy fashion.\u0027 (Ah! thought Bond. The ON.) \u0027I plead youth and the heat of a war that I thought would bring much glory to my country. I was mistaken. We were defeated. The expiation of that dishonour is a large matter, a matter for the youth of this country. I am not a politician and I do not know what course that expiation will take. At present we are going through the usual transition period of the vanquished. But I, Tanaka, have my own private accounting to balance. I am in great debt to your country. This morning I have betrayed a State secret to you. I was encouraged in my action by my friendship for Dikko. I was also encouraged by the sincerity of your bearing and the honesty of your approach to the duty that has been laid upon you. I fully realize the importance of this piece of paper to Britain. You remember its contents?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Exactly, I think.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027And you are on your honour not to communicate it elsewhere.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 \\n\\n Tiger Tanaka got to his feet and held out his hand. \u0027Goodbye for the time being, Commander. I hope that we shall be seeing more of each other.\u0027 The powerful face lit up again. \\n\\n Now there was no pretence in the great golden smile. \u0027Honour is a pattern of behaviour, Commander. The bamboo must bend to the breeze. But equally the cedar must bend to the typhoon. The meaning of this is that sometimes duty is more compelling than any words. A car is waiting to take you back to your hotel. Please give my deep respects to Dikko and tell him he owes me one thousand yen for repairs to electronic equipment that is the property of the State.\u0027 \\n\\n James Bond took the hard dry paw. He said from his heart: \u0027Thank you, Mr Tanaka.\u0027 He walked out of the little secret room with one thought uppermost in his mind. How fast were Dikko\u0027s communications to Melbourne? How fast from Melbourne to London? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584/47087.html","bookId":1266,"book":{"id":1266,"title":"007之雷霆谷 You Only Live Twice","description":"简介： 一天，美国太空船遭到了不明飞行物的攻击，美方怀疑是苏联的阴谋，目的是想独霸太空。美方测出了不明飞行物的降落地点是在日本，于是英国军方派出007（肖恩康纳利SeanConnery饰）前往日本替美方调查此事。由于007的身份特殊，直接进入日本容易被敌人察觉。为了掩人耳目...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/21/09-23-13-33-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1584","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
