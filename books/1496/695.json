The fluctuations of the magical techniques used were still in the air, as was the blood. The faces of the newcomers flickered, and they transmitted a short conversation before scattering.\n Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun sped through the mists at high speed, licking his lips, his eyes flickering with madness. Little Wolfgod was not the first chosen he had captured, but rather, the eighth.\n “That’ll teach you to change shape before attacking me!” he thought with a cold snort. All of the other chosen he had captured, including Little Wolfgod, had been taken out with a single fist strike. For all intents and purposes, this was Bai Xiaochun’s first time truly fighting people since he had stepped into the Heaven-Dao Nascent Soul stage. As he did, he was learning about some of the amazing aspects of his new cultivation base.\n “My Heaven-Dao Nascent Soul seems powerful enough to suppress all other types of nascent souls…. All of the other chosen I attacked nearly had their cultivation bases destroyed.” After reviewing the past few fights, he was even more certain than ever that Little Wolfgod’s cultivation base had also been unstable. With that, he decided to go confirm his theory.\n He hurried along for a bit until suddenly, his expression flickered, and he changed direction. Off to the right, he had just caught sight of two Wildlander chosen being chased by a large group of vengeful souls.\n “I’ll do a little test with these two.” Chuckling, he accelerated toward the two chosen, who caught sight of him only moments later. Their faces fell, and they were about to open their mouths when Bai Xiaochun flicked his sleeve, sending a burst of wind out. Both of them had mid Nascent Soul stage cultivation bases, which they drew upon to defend themselves, and yet, how could they possibly be a match for Bai Xiaochun? When facing his magical techniques, their cultivation bases were suppressed, making it difficult for them to rotate them properly.\n Before either of them could do anything, they were sent tumbling backward, blood spraying out of their mouths. Then, Bai Xiaochun shot forward, reached out, and grabbed them.\n After sealing them and tossing them into his bag of holding, he smiled broadly. Just now, he had been closely observing their cultivation bases, and was now sure that his Heaven-Dao Nascent Soul cultivation base truly could emit crushing pressure onto other types of nascent souls.\n “Heavens! Who would have thought that I was this strong!?!?’ Excitedly, he turned and headed off in a different direction.\n By now, the other Wildlander chosen in the Necromancer Kettle were the prey, and Bai Xiaochun, the hunter. One after another, he captured chosen, almost as if he were an eagle swooping down onto baby chickens.\n When he encountered larger groups, he would avoid them, preferring to prey on solitary targets. When he found such targets, rumbling sounds would fill the air that attracted a lot of attention. But he won each battle so quickly, and fled with such speed, that no one else was able to even come close to surrounding him.\n “Dammit, how come this Bai Hao can move about so freely in this mist?!?!”\n “There are already more than ten people missing….”\n “Notify everyone that they need to stick together. Form groups of at least five!” Virtually all of the chosen in the Necromancer Kettle were taking orders from either Gongsun Yi, Zhou Hong or Xu Shan, so as the messages were sent out, everyone became more cautious than ever.\n When that started happening, Bai Xiaochun got nervous. Although it was possible to kidnap five people at a time, it would take a lot longer. At the moment, he was speeding through the mists, wondering if he should change his appearance with his mask to fool people, when suddenly his face lit up.\n “A straggler!” Off in the distance, he could see a burly fellow striding along, slaughtering vengeful souls left and right. It was none other than… Zhao Dongshan.\n “He’s pretty far away. If he tried to use a minor teleportation, it would definitely drag things out too long….” With that, he produced a greatbow from his bag of holding.\n In almost the same moment that Bai Xiaochun caught sight of Zhao Dongshan, Zhao Dongshan caught sight of him.\n Zhao Dongshan was shocked; he had heard that quite a few people were missing, and as such, immediately turned to head toward some of his fellows. However, even as he tried to break out from the tide of souls that had surrounded him, a sensation of profound crisis rose up within him. That sense of crisis didn’t come because of his divine sense, but rather, the special technique he cultivated, a fleshly body danger sense!\n Looking back in fear at Bai Xiaochun, he didn\u0027t hesitate for even a moment to utilize a minor teleportation. However, before he could complete it, an arrow appeared, shooting toward him at high speed and with shocking energy. Then, before it even reached him, it detonated.\n The massive force of the explosion instantly threw the air in the area into chaos.\n “A spirit enhanced arrow!!” Blood oozed out of the corners of Zhao Dongshan’s mouth as he realized that this spirit enhanced arrow had reached the tenfold level or higher. Only arrows like that could create spatial distortions that would interfere with teleportations\n A look of despair appeared in his eyes as he tried to back up. As he watched in terror, Bai Xiaochun used his greatbow to shoot seven more arrows, all of which whistled toward him with incredible speed.\n “Bai Hao!!” Zhao Dongshan shouted, urgently speeding away physically because he was unable to teleport.\n Earlier, he had looked down on this supposed Bai Hao. But then he ended up being the first one struck when the chosen attempted to surround him. His chest still hurt from where he had been bashed into, and because of that, he had no intention of getting into a fight right now. And yet, before he could truly begin to retreat, the arrows were upon him, and exploded.\n The explosions cast the area into further chaos, and caused blood to spray out of Zhao Dongshan’s mouth. Throwing all caution to the wind, he attempted to flee at top speed. And yet, compared to Bai Xiaochun, he was too slow. Already, Bai Xiaochun was closing in on him in utterly aggressive fashion.\n The mere thought of how Zhao Dongshan had been the first one to attack him got Bai Xiaochun very angry. “Think you’re tough stuff? Fudge! How dare you be the first one to attack Lord Bai! Lord Bai is gonna beat you to death!”\n Without any hesitation, he unleashed a devastating fist strike, which caused deafening rumbling sounds to echo out in all directions. After the proverbial dust cleared, Zhao Dongshan was kidnapped, and Bai Xiaochun was speeding away.\n Bai Xiaochun’s heart was pounding with excitement by this point. He was definitely having a lot of fun with this cat-and-mouse game.\n “What a bunch of dolts! All they know how to do is gang up on people. Hmmmphh! Which of them would dare to fight Lord Bai one-on-one!?” Feeling truly unparalleled under heaven, he flicked his sleeve and proceeded onward proudly. Before long, he encountered a large group of shrieking vengeful souls, from within which could be heard the sounds of fighting.\n “Another windfall. The eagle catches more baby chickens….” Licking his lips, he approached carefully until he could see five Wildlander chosen surrounded by vengeful souls. At the moment, they were just on the verge of breaking out into the open. Of the five, four were in the mid Nascent Soul stage, and one was in the late stage. Their combined power was incredible, and obviously, it was only a matter of time before they would be free of the vengeful souls.\n “What a pity I can’t control the vengeful souls here. That would make things a whole lot simpler!” He sighed, then thought for a moment before producing a fifteen-colored flame. Eyes flickering, and chuckling darkly, he flew forward, concealing the fluctuations of his cultivation base as he got closer and closer to the group of chosen.\n Before long, intense rumbling sounds could be heard as red clouds appeared in the sky. Then, fire began to fall like rain. It was none other than the special divine ability Bai Xiaochun had come up with in the Bai Clan. He had assumed that after reaching the Heaven-Dao Nascent Soul stage, he would lose that ability, and yet, unexpectedly, the opposite had happened. It actually got easier to use. As the sea of flames appeared, the vengeful souls began to scatter. As for the five chosen, their faces fell as they saw the endlessly destructive fire bearing down on them. They immediately turned to flee, which was the exact same moment that Bai Xiaochun appeared among them, long spear in hand, battle prowess surging as he danced in and out of the raining fire….\n Booms filled the air, and after ten breaths of time, Bai Xiaochun was gone, along with the five chosen. Even after he left, the rain of fire continued to fall with destructive force.\n The entire dimension inside the Necromancer Kettle had been thrown into chaos. The Wildlander Chosen were all shocked to the core, and by now, everyone knew that nearly thirty among their number were missing.\n Bai Hao was simply too quick. Nobody ever had a chance to try to surround him, and furthermore, it was to the shock of all present that they realized the evil ghosts didn\u0027t even notice him.\n Everyone was frustrated, enraged, and also shocked. As of this moment, Bai Xiaochun’s revenge was being carried out very smoothly.\n By now, the remaining chosen had separated into four main groups, led respectively by Gongsun Yi, Zhou Hong, Xu Shan, and the second prince.\n Of course, it wasn’t a long-term strategy. After all, they had to track Bai Xiaochun down. If they didn\u0027t, and the deadlock lasted for too long, nobody would get the ghost king fruit.\n Eventually, they realized they had to split up. Unfortunately, spreading out into a net-like formation wasn’t very suitable in the Necromancer Kettle. There were simply too many evil ghosts and vengeful souls in the place. As such, they had to stick together, even if just to fight off the occasional evil ghost.\n Of the four main groups, each had their own separate way of doing things. The second prince had a group of several dozen with him, including Chen Manyao, who stuck together closely as they searched.\n Although Gongsun Yi, Zhou Hong and Xu Shan were all very confident in general, they also kept three or four people with them as they searched. The rest of the cultivators stayed in groups of roughly ten. It was in this way that everyone felt confident enough to tackle Bai Xiaochun if they encountered him.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-693","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
