{"id":45820,"no":503,"title":"Chapter 501: Trying To Defeat A Nascent Soul Expert!","content":"Bai Xiaochun seemed like he had already descended into madness. He had received numerous injuries, and his eyes were completely bloodshot. Behind him, the ground was littered with corpses, and the soul cultivators ahead of him were completely shaken.\\n\\n To them, Bai Xiaochun seemed insane and completely bereft of the desire to live. Despite having killed quite a number of soul cultivators, he was clearly seriously injured.\\n\\n However, he didn’t seem to care about any such injuries as he strode forward, shouting, “Die!!” \\n\\n Suddenly, an old soul cultivator appeared in front of him, reaching out with a hand that was already decaying into blackness. By the time his hand was extended, it looked like nothing but ashen bones as he tried to grab Bai Xiaochun’s chest, apparently to rip out his heart.\\n\\n At the same time, eight other soul cultivators in the area drew so deeply upon themselves that blood began to ooze out of their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths. Soul power battered Bai Xiaochun’s frigid qi as they charged in attack; if they could just slow down his momentum, then perhaps their combined force would be enough to destroy him in body and soul.\\n\\n In the face of such danger, Bai Xiaochun laughed viciously and allowed the old man’s pitch-black bone hand to slam into his chest. The old man’s eyes lit up with delight, and just when he was about to grab down, his face fell as he realized that it felt like his hand had run into a chunk of iron. Heart pounding, the old man made to retreat.\\n\\n However, that was when Bai Xiaochun lunged forward, headbutting the man in the face. As the man’s head was crushed, he screamed and tried to fight back, and yet, the frigid qi had suppressed even his quasi-Nascent Soul cultivation base, and a moment later, he was dead in body and soul.\\n\\n After killing the old man, Bai Xiaochun spun, his hands flashing in a double-handed incantation gesture to summon a gale-force wind that blasted against the other eight soul cultivators\\n\\n Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and yet he shot like lightning toward the eight enemies, landing vicious fist strikes onto their chests that sent them tumbling backward like kites with their strings cut.\\n\\n All of this takes a bit of time to describe, but actually occurred within about ten breaths of time. During that time, he had already killed at least a hundred soul cultivators, and many savage giants. Behind him, the ground was soaked with blood and gore.\\n\\n As his frigid qi faded away, he staggered a bit to the side, where some of the cultivators of the five legions reached out to prop him up. Those cultivators’ eyes were bright red; after witnessing Bai Xiaochun’s brave ferocity, they were also pushed deeper into madness, and took it upon themselves to protect him as they again charged forward.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun’s face was pale white, and he was having a hard time breathing. However, with the help of the other cultivators, he managed to grit his teeth and put a Godly Vestige Pill into his mouth. Then he pulled out a few bottles of spirit alcohol to restore his spiritual energy.\\n\\n The main reason he had been willing to sustain such injuries moments ago was because he had the Godly Vestige Pill to fall back on. As soon as the miraculous pill entered his mouth, heat washed through him, and in the blink of an eye, all of his injuries were being healed.\\n\\n Meanwhile, the cultivators continued to charge toward the shield, which was now only about 1,500 meters away. Along the way, other nearby cultivators had noticed what was happening, and had been hurrying over to join them the entire time, causing their numbers to swell to over 10,000.\\n\\n Of course, they weren’t the only large group of cultivators who had managed to group together. There were seven or eight other such groups, all of whom were in formation and trying to reach the shield. Furthermore, all of them were rallying around a powerful figure of some sort.\\n\\n And of course, Bai Xiaochun was just such a leader!\\n\\n However, he was a bit different from the other core figures who had rallied troops around them. Those people had long since grown in prestige and power. In contrast, Bai Xiaochun had slaughtered his way into fame in a very short time!\\n\\n He seemed to lack any fear of death, and was willing to fight back against hundreds of soul cultivators and savage giants. Because of that, he had gained the complete approval of everyone around him.\\n\\n As his group blasted through layer after layer of opposition, and got closer and closer to the shield, one of the Nascent Soul tribal chiefs finally used some unknown method to make it past the destructive beams of light being sent out by the huge eye.\\n\\n At first, the tribal chief was only about 30 meters tall, but as he closed in, he rapidly grew in height to 300 meters tall. Every step he took caused his energy to rise to even more shocking heights, even causing a powerful wind to sweep about in all directions.\\n\\n As he sped toward Bai Xiaochun, cries of alarm rang out from the cultivators.\\n\\n “Time to die, Devil Bai!” he howled in rage, his voice echoing like thunder. The mere sound of his voice was such that the cultivators who had been clustered protectively around Bai Xiaochun began to tremble and cough up blood.\\n\\n With that, the tribal chief lunged forward, shoving his mountain-like hand forward and unleashing pressure that the cultivators of the five legions could not fight back against. From the look of it, there was nothing anybody could do to stop this chief.\\n\\n Even as Bai Xiaochun stood there, supported by another cultivator, he looked up, and his pupils constricted.\\n\\n “Nascent Soul....”\\n\\n There was no time for hesitation. He had already surmised that the Wildlanders wouldn’t let him escape so easily, which was why he had held back so many of his other trump cards.\\n\\n Although the scene which was playing out was shocking, it was by no means unexpected. Gritting his teeth, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture and then dashed forward to meet the tribal chief, frigid qi swirling around him, his Undying Live Forever Technique on full display.\\n\\n In the blink of an eye, the two of them met, and an intense boom filled the air. Blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth, and he almost felt like the pressure and might of the Nascent Soul stage alone was enough to crush him into oblivion!\\n\\n However, the tribal chief didn\u0027t come out unscathed. Blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth, and his eyes shone with incredulity as he staggered backward several steps.\\n\\n “What level is your cultivation base?! You’re not injured?!?!” In his shock, the tribal chief asked two questions in one breath. From what he had been able to tell, this Devil Bai was actually on equal footing with himself, which seemed like a complete impossibility.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun wiped the blood off of his mouth and said, “My cultivation base level? The level that can kill you!” \\n\\n A quick glance confirmed that the beams of light from the giant eye would definitely keep the other tribal chiefs at bay temporarily. However, if he didn’t take care of this tribal chief quickly, then death would be just around the corner.\\n\\n Eyes flickering, he decided to completely throw caution to the wind. Quickly performing a double-handed incantation gesture, he shoved his hands down toward the ground!\\n\\n “Waterswamp!!”\\n\\n Instantly, ripples spread out through the air, causing water vapor to spring out of nowhere as the entire area was transformed into a huge swamp!\\n\\n When that swamp appeared, the tribal chief’s face fell, and the profound sense of deadly crisis that inundated him caused his heart to begin to pound.\\n\\n “This Devil Bai is very strange....” The chief’s eyes flickered with killing intent; well aware that he couldn’t let Bai Xiaochun finish using this technique, he suddenly lunged forward.\\n\\n “You’re dead!”\\n\\n “Nope,” Bai Xiaochun retorted. “You’re dead!” With that, he flung his hands over his head, causing his hair and his blood-stained garments to whip about as energy surged in all directions.\\n\\n “.... Kingdom!!”\\n\\n RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!\\n\\n The lands quaked as a massive spike shot out from the ground, then a second, and then a third! One after another, they rose up like mountains, provoking looks of wide-eyed shock from everyone on the battlefield.\\n\\n The tribal chief had been in the middle of lunging forward, and was stabbed directly by one of the spikes. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and a look of utter shock appeared on his face.\\n\\n Frigid qi poured into him as he looked down at the spike, and the swamp around him. From what he could tell, that water vapor hid some shockingly enormous beast!\\n\\n And yet, things weren’t over yet. Bai Xiaochun leaped into the air above the tribal chief, spreading his arms wide as he howled, “Living Mountain Incantation!”\\n\\n In the blink of an eye, rocks began to form around him until he looked like a huge stone golem!\\n\\n With the power of a living mountain, he bore down on the tribal chief and then crushed him with vicious ruthlessness!\\n\\n “Elder Brother Zhao can kill Nascent Soul experts, and so can Bai Xiaochun!”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-501","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \\n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
