{"id":45576,"no":259,"title":"Chapter 257: Boo!?!?","content":"While Bai Xiaochun was in the middle of fighting Xiao Qing, Yang Hongwu, and Zhang Yunshan, Song Junwan was barreling down the Ancient Blood Path thanks to the help provided by Bai Xiaochun. She even burned some of her own life blood to speed up as she pursued Xuemei.\\n\\n Up ahead, Xuemei frowned as she also accelerated. However, the fact that Song Junwan was burning her life blood ensured that she only got closer and closer. Soon, she was close enough to launch an attack, and the two of them started fighting.\\n\\n As the fighting began, Song Junwan’s face was paler than ever. Surprisingly, not only were Xuemei’s injuries completely healed, her cultivation base also seemed to have made some progress, putting her on almost exactly the same level as Song Junwan. Because of their fierce fighting, the two women slowed down, and soon they could hear booms and explosions coming from behind them. There were also words being spoken, but because of the intense rumbling sounds, it was impossible to hear them clearly.\\n\\n Song Junwan’s expression flickered. Although she cared about the blood master title, she was also worried about Nightcrypt. After all, for him to simultaneously fight Xiao Qing, Yang Hongwu, and Zhang Yunshan would put him in great danger.\\n\\n The fact that he was putting his life on the line to help her become the blood master filled her heart with stabs of pain. She was also confused, unsure of whether or not she was doing the right thing. However, there was little time to ponder the matter. Chuckling bitterly, she attacked Xuemei with all the power she could muster.\\n\\n Xuemei didn’t say much, and from the look in her eye, she was getting very anxious. However, Song Junwan had a profound cultivation base, and couldn’t be taken care of quickly. Even as they continued to fight, the sounds behind them suddenly ceased. At the same time, the two women gradually got closer and closer to the end of the Ancient Blood Path.\\n\\n Now visible was an arched doorway that was emanating intense blood-colored light. Clearly, beyond that door existed blood qi so powerful that it was difficult to put into words.\\n\\n That place... was the heart cavity, and also the location of the blood crystal. Whoever got inside first would have the first chance to get the blood crystal and become Middle Peak’s blood master.\\n\\n In the moment that the end of the path became visible, the two women heard a sound from behind them that resembled sonic booms, as though some powerful expert were unleashing all the power at his disposal to race toward them.\\n\\n Also, it was obvious that whoever this person was, it would only take them about five or six breaths of time to reach them.\\n\\n Xuemei knew that the chances of that person being Nightcrypt were not large, but she wasn’t willing to bet on that fact. As she and Song Junwan got closer to the arched doorway, fighting the entire way, she suddenly smiled.\\n\\n “Song Junwan, the title of blood master doesn’t belong to you.”\\n\\n Although her smile wasn\u0027t visible because of the mask, her arrogance was audible in her voice. At this point, she extended her hand, and visible there on her wrist was a violet, triangular mark.\\n\\n Almost as soon as the mark became visible, it flew off of her skin and transformed into three diamond-shaped sealing marks which immediately shot toward Song Junwan, emanating powerful pressure!\\n\\n Rumbling sounds echoed out, and Song Junwan shivered. Blood sprayed out of her mouth as she was shoved away from the arched doorway. The three diamond-shaped sealing marks were swirling around her, emanating sealing power that Song Junwan simply couldn’t break free from.\\n\\n Song Junwan trembled as she looked around at the sealing marks. The sealing method that was being used was almost beyond comprehension, and Song Junwan quickly came to the conclusion that it was the work of Patriarch Limitless. “Xuemei, you cheap slut! Not only did you cheat, Patriarch Limitless also ignored the rules and gave you a sealing treasure! Even if you do become the blood master, the Song Clan won’t let this stand!!”\\n\\n “Be a good girl, now. The blood master title doesn’t belong to you anyway.” Xuemei laughed lightly as she took a stop toward the blood-colored door.\\n\\n Bitterness and despair could be seen in Song Junwan’s eyes, and her hatred for Xuemei had reached the pinnacle. It was at that moment, when Xuemei was just about to step into the door, that deafening rumbling filled the area.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun appeared, right next to Song Junwan. When he saw the three violet sealing marks, his expression flickered, and he punched out with his right hand.\\n\\n That blow was backed by the power of a heavenly demon, but when it landed on the three violet diamonds, the sealing marks weren’t affected at all. In fact, the force of his blow was directed back at him in a backlash. Bai Xiaochun gasped.\\n\\n “Is that a patriarch-level seal?”\\n\\n Song Junwan had no time to ponder how Nightcrypt had managed to get past Xiao Qing, Yang Hongwu, and Zhang Yunshan. Taking a deep breath, her eyes flickered with determination, and she lifted her right hand up. Laying there in the palm of her hand was a blood-colored command medallion.\\n\\n There was something very strange about the medallion, and as soon as it appeared, the sealing marks around her began to twist and distort. Although they didn’t shatter, it was clear that they would collapse within the time it takes an incense stick to burn.\\n\\n Unfortunately, Song Junwan didn’t have that much time on her hands.\\n\\n “Nightcrypt, take my blood master command medallion. I don’t care how you do it, become the blood master! You can’t let that slut succeed!!!” Song Junwan was throwing caution to the wind. Without any more hesitation, she hurled the command medallion toward Bai Xiaochun. Because of the strange properties of the medallion itself, it passed directly through the seal, to be snatched out of the air by Bai Xiaochun. Almost immediately, he could feel it vibrating as if with joy, as if it viewed Bai Xiaochun with ultimate approval.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun’s eyes widened, but this wasn’t the time for consideration. If Xuemei succeeded, he would be in grave danger, and he couldn’t let that happen. Gritting his teeth, he shot toward the blood-colored archway with blinding speed!\\n\\n As Song Junwan watched this happen, her entire body seemed to weaken, and yet, a smile broke out on her face.\\n\\n “Nightcrypt, if you succeed, I’ll do everything I can to make sure your position as blood master is stable!” Suddenly, she was struck with the feeling that this was definitely the right decision. If Nightcrypt did manage to become the blood master, that was something the Song Clan could probably accept!\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun disappeared into the doorway, her words echoing in his ears.\\n\\n The world of the heart cavity was filled with blood-colored light. In the very middle, a gigantic heart was visible, and although it was still and unmoving, it radiated an intense pressure that could shake heaven and earth.\\n\\n Enormous blood vessels stretched out in all directions, making the entire place something like a maze.\\n\\n Resting on top of the heart itself was a blood crystal which emanated both radiant light and intense pressure. From the feeling it let off, it seemed that anyone who acquired it would have control over part of a legacy. They would control.... one of the Blood Ancestor’s fingers!\\n\\n That blood crystal was required of anyone who wished to become the Middle Peak blood master!\\n\\n Xuemei was currently speeding in the direction of the blood crystal, her eyes shining with a strange light. Oddly, a head-sized crystal was currently floating along next to her, within which was a blurry figure that was screaming at the top of its lungs.\\n\\n “It’s there! Right there...!”\\n\\n “Shut up!” Xuemei growled, pushing forward with even more speed. However, it was at that moment that her eyes narrowed, and she looked back to see Nightcrypt stepping through the entrance.\\n\\n Xuemei’s jaw dropped, and her killing intent immediately spiked. However, all she did was look back at the heart and push forward with greater speed than before.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath as he looked around. As soon as he caught sight of Xuemei, his wings fluttered, and he shot in her direction. By calling upon all of the protomagnetic powers of gravity and repulsion, he was capable of speed that far surpassed Xuemei’s. At the very moment that she reached the heart, he caught up with her.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun was actually feeling a bit depressed. His goal had been to become the grand elder, but thanks to a freak combination of factors, he was now fighting to become the blood master. There was no time to ponder the situation; he absolutely could not let Xuemei succeed, and therefore, he was left with few options.\\n\\n “I guess I underestimated Song Junwan’s boldness,” Xuemei said, chuckling, and then her right hand flashed with an incantation gesture. Instantly, a golden arc of electricity shot out from her finger toward Bai Xiaochun.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun was about to counterattack, but then his face flickered. That golden arc of electricity seemed even more terrifying than anything which Xiao Qing, Yang Hongwu, or Zhang Yunshan had unleashed. Without the slightest hesitation, Bai Xiaochun used the Mountain Shaking Bash to evade the electricity and charge directly toward Xuemei.\\n\\n As soon as he appeared in front of her, he unleashed a fist strike, causing her pupils to constrict. Her lovely left hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and she slapped at his fist. As soon as their hands made contact, her hand turned golden, and Bai Xiaochun gasped at the sensation of intense power, which seemed no weaker than his own fleshly body power. As he staggered backward, he looked up to see shock in Xuemei’s eyes as she also lurched backward.\\n\\n Just as she was about to unleash another attack... the blood crystal seemed to respond to Bai Xiaochun’s presence. Vibrating, it suddenly flew up into the air and shot toward him.\\n\\n The shocking scene caused Xuemei’s eyes to fill with astonishment. At the same time, the blurry figure in the crystal hovering next to her screamed, “Stop him! Don\u0027t let him get it!!”\\n\\n “Shut up!” Xuemei said, grinding her teeth. Suddenly, her eyes turned bright gold, and the blood-colored light which surrounded her vanished. Golden light sprang up around her, and she grew visibly gaunt as she used a divine ability that gave her great strength at the cost of some of her life force. With that, she extended her right hand and pointed at Bai Xiaochun.\\n\\n This was none other than her most powerful trump card!\\n\\n A hand materialized behind her that looked just like her own right hand, with finger extended. It was huge, and radiated an intense power that filled Bai Xiaochun with an keen sensation of deadly crisis. Prickling stabs of pain filled him, as though the basic structure of his body were being altered!\\n\\n The sensation of danger that washed through him exceeded anything he had felt when fighting Xiao Qing, Yang Hongwu, and Zhang Yunshan, and even surpassed the feelings he had experienced when he was being chased by the Luochen Clan. The only thing it could compare to was the feeling he\u0027d experienced because of the girl in the white dress, back in the Fallen Sword World.\\n\\n Rumbling sounds filled his mind, and he knew that he could not simply sit out this crisis and wait until it ended. Nor could he try to flee. If he did, he would die. His intuition was telling him that the only way to deal with this divine ability... was to attack it head-on!\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun’s cultivation base erupted with power, and his wings flickered as the powers of gravity and repulsion erupted out, imbuing the Mountain Shaking Bash with even more power than before, and sending him shooting at top speed toward Xuemei!\\n\\n “Golden Touch!” As the words left Xuemei’s mouth, they rumbled like thunder. At the same time, she waved her finger down, and the huge hand behind her rumbled forth, emanating pressure like that of the heavens.\\n\\n As they closed in on each other, Xuemei’s finger stabbed toward Bai Xiaochun’s forehead. At the same time, his thumb and forefinger began to snap shut as he unleashed the Throat Crushing Grasp.\\n\\n As of this moment, he was holding nothing back. He... was going all out with every bit of power he possessed! The turtle-wok appeared, shielding him as he reached out toward Xuemei\u0027s neck.\\n\\n Just when they were about to make contact, Xuemei\u0027s body suddenly blurred as she tried to dodge to the side. And yet, Bai Xiaochun had been prepared for that possibility, and gravitational force erupted out of his palm with unprecedented power. It locked down onto Xuemei, making it impossible for her to move out of the way. A look of panic rose up in her eyes, and in that moment... her mask... fell off.\\n\\n Now it was possible to see... a spectacularly beautiful face, with pure, fair skin!\\n\\n The instant Bai Xiaochun saw her facial features, he felt like 100,000 lightning bolts were striking his mind, as if his brain were about to explode. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing, and instinctively blurted, “Boo!?!?”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-257","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \\n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
