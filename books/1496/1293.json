{"id":46610,"no":1293,"title":"Chapter 1291: The Mortal Renegade Awakens!","content":"Daoist Heavenspan had perished!\\n\\n Back in the Heavenspan Realm, his spectacular talent, his immense power, and his profound scheming had brought ruin to Arch-Emperor City. He very nearly ended the succession of the Arch-Emperors, and brought about the existence of the Wildlands. In the end, he personally destroyed the Heavenspan Realm…. Now, his life was nothing but a thing of the past. He was now ash drifting in the starry sky, his soul gone forever.\\n\\n No one had heard his final words, and no one would ever know whether he thought it had all been worth it, or not.\\n\\n No one would ever know what would have happened if the gravekeeper had violated the ancient stipulations, and actually allowed Daoist Heavenspan to lead the Arch-Emperor Dynasty.\\n\\n The gravekeeper had adhered to the Arch-Ancestor’s wishes, and did not allow someone who lacked the Daoist magics of the Arch-Emperors to lead the exodus from the Heavenspan Realm.\\n\\n Daoist Heavenspan had lived a thrilling life, but all of his ruthless ambitions had now come to an end.\\n\\n Mixed emotions could be seen in the eyes of both Song Que and the Saint-Emperor as they watched the ash that was all that remained of Daoist Heavenspan drifting out into the void.\\n\\n As for all the other living beings in the Eternal Immortal Domains, especially the cultivators of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, they were completely stunned by the battle which had just taken place. Although they couldn’t see everything clearly, they could sense that Daoist Heavenspan was dead, and after a short moment of silence, they broke out into cheering.\\n\\n They all hated Daoist Heavenspan with a passion, and as their cheers filled the air, Song Que and the Saint-Emperor prepared to return to the Eternal Immortal Domains.\\n\\n But then, both of their expressions flickered!\\n\\n A boundless, majestic aura suddenly appeared, something that could fill the entire starry sky and cause pressure to weigh down on all living beings. Both within and without the starry sky, it was the ultimate expression of existence, and it came from none other than the enormous, statue-like Mortal Renegade!\\n\\n The sky trembled, and the Eternal Immortal Domains shook, causing crevices to open up everywhere. Even the Eternal Sea was affected, and began to sink down due to the invisible force.\\n\\n Everyone in the Eternal Immortal Domains felt struck to the core, and began to shiver, all the way down to their souls. It was as if their thoughts and minds had been wiped away, leaving them capable of feeling only instinctual terror and confusion. It was as if they were suddenly in the presence of the most deadly and vicious enemy possible!!\\n\\n If that were all there were to the situation, it might not have been a big deal. But strangely, the aura seemed to contain the power of natural law, some sort of force of attraction which caused the previously sinking waters of the Eternal Sea to suddenly begin to rise up into the air!\\n\\n It wasn’t just the Eternal Sea. Mountains were ripped out of the ground and began to float up, and even people! Regardless of the level of their cultivation base, they all began to rise into the air, their bodies completely beyond their own control!\\n\\n Cities, palaces, plants, vegetation, animals. Everything in the Eternal Immortal Domains seemed to be affected!\\n\\n It was a completely shocking scene!\\n\\n Even Bai Xiaochun began to rise up into the air, along with his private chamber. No protective spell formations had any effect! Shockingly, even the door of his chamber was affected, and shattered, with the resulting fragments slowly floating up!\\n\\n Now it was possible to see Bai Xiaochun, sitting there cross-legged, withered and brittle. It was impossible to tell whether he was alive or dead!!\\n\\n He was being affected like everything else in the Eternal Immortal Domains, except for the fact… that he sat there cross-legged and unmoving!!\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun was the only one to react in such a way. Even the Saint-Emperor and Song Que were trembling, as though fetters had suddenly wrapped around them. With immense difficulty, they turned and looked behind them to see the Mortal Renegade… moving!!\\n\\n As he hovered there in the starry sky, his hands twitched, and then cracking sounds rang out from his head. At the same time, the dirt and rock that had built up on him over the many years began to crack.\\n\\n First there were dozens of cracks, then hundreds, and soon thousands. Within moments, there were tens of thousands, and with each new one that appeared, his aura grew more shocking!!\\n\\n The living beings in the Eternal Immortal Domains could hardly think, and in fact, the lands also seemed to be moving upward, albeit very slowly.\\n\\n As for the Saint-Emperor and Song Que, they were completely overwhelmed by waves of shock.\\n\\n “He… he….” the Saint-Emperor said shakily, terror shining in his eyes as he watched the cracks spreading out over the surface of the Mortal Renegade.\\n\\n Song Que’s face was ashen. Both he and the Saint-Emperor had gone all out in their fight with Daoist Heavenspan, and although they had killed him in the end, their battle had only served to reinforce how unimaginably powerful the Mortal Renegade was.\\n\\n “He’s waking up… ahead of schedule!!” In that moment, the Mortal Renegade’s eyelids twitched, causing massive rumbling sounds to echo out. From the dirt and rocks that were now falling down, it was obvious that the Mortal Renegade was trying to open his eyes!\\n\\n As for the sealing strip on him that represented the Arch-Emperor, it only took a few short breaths of time for it to vanish completely!\\n\\n It sounded like a zither string snapping, a sound which filled all of the Eternal Immortal Domains.\\n\\n And then, for the first time since he had been sealed, the Mortal Renegade’s eyelids… cracked open, revealing something like two suns!!\\n\\n When those suns appeared in the dark starry sky, they did not shine with blinding light. No, these suns were black, and actually resembled black holes!\\n\\n And those black holes were none other than… the eyes of the Mortal Renegade!\\n\\n The Mortal Renegade was waking up!!\\n\\n In that moment, the sound of a sigh could be heard, seemingly originating from the most ancient of times. It echoed out to fill all creation, filling the starry sky, and even the ruins that were all that remained of the countless living beings that had once existed!\\n\\n In response to that sigh, the minds of all living beings in the Eternal Immortal Domains reeled, and they immediately snapped out of their reveries. Not even paying attention to how they were now floating up into the air, they all looked up into the sky… at the Mortal Renegade’s eyes!!\\n\\n There were no cries of alarm, but there were innumerable gasps, as a sense of profound terror and helplessness filled them all.\\n\\n Then, a voice spoke, profoundly ancient, thrumming as if with the Essence of time, causing everything it reached to age.\\n\\n “I have awakened for one reason. Extermination….” \\n\\n In that instant, the Eternal Immortal Domains suddenly began to turn gray….\\n\\n By now, the Mortal Renegade was completely covered with innumerable cracks. Then, rumbling sounds echoed out as he began his first attempt to move!!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1291","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \\n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
