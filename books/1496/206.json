{"id":45523,"no":206,"title":"Chapter 204: Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening!","content":"“Blood qi, gather!” Bai Xiaochun threw his head back and roared. As his hand waved through the air, something completely and utterly shocking occurred in the midst of the Foundation Establishment cultivators! Throughout the entire lower finger of Middle Peak, countless strands of blood qi seemed to answer Bai Xiaochun’s call, almost as if they were related to him. They almost seemed to possess intelligence as they sped through the air, radiating something like joy. Countless strands of blood qi shot toward Bai Xiaochun, merging into him. Every plant, every immortal\u0027s cave, every blood cistern, every blood waterfall, every inch of the ground emitted blood qi, which then raced toward Bai Xiaochun. RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE! It was a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering scene of shocking nature. Everything turned bright red as matchlessly strong blood qi blotted out the sky. A blood mist rapidly formed around Bai Xiaochun, a mist that rose high into the air above him. It was as if Bai Xiaochun had become the king of all the blood qi in the area, as if a single word from his mouth would cause it all to rush to his side. All of the blood qi in all of the lower finger of Middle Peak was churning in response to his words. However, the effect wasn’t limited to the lower finger area. Even the blood qi in the upper finger was stirring into motion. A massive column of blood-colored light surrounded Bai Xiaochun, shaking everything around it as it shot into the sky. All of Middle Peak was devolving into complete and utter chaos. When the surrounding dozens of Foundation Establishment cultivators saw what was happening, they were flabbergasted, and began to shake in terror as they realized that the blood qi in their own bodies was on the verge of bursting out into the open. Even the mid Foundation Establishment cultivators had looks of utter disbelief on their faces. At the same time, beams of light shot up from the upper finger as numerous late Foundation Establishment experts appeared. Each and every one seemed completely and utterly taken aback. “What kind of freak is this guy!?!?” “I can’t believe the blood qi is heeding his commands!!” “Dammit! How could Nightcrypt be so powerful? Why didn’t he reach Earthstring Foundation Establishment?!” The cultivators on Lesser Marsh Peak, Nameless Peak, and Corpse Peak were all struck speechless. Even the grand elders of the three other mountain peaks all had looks of complete awe on their faces as they watched events playing out on Middle Peak. “This is....” “The mere sight of it....” The blood masters from the three other mountains had all emerged from their temples to watch what was happening. They were all young men, each of whom radiated enigmatic auras. Serious expressions could be seen on their faces, and their hearts trembled because of the waves of shock which battered them inwardly. On the upper finger of Middle Peak, Grand Elder Song Junwan was in the middle of an important meeting with the mountain’s nine bloodstreak elders. Although they had been aware of the fierce fighting going on in the lower finger area, they hadn’t been paying too much attention. But now, the sudden eruption of blood qi left them all completely shocked. That was especially true when the blood qi in the upper finger began to stir into motion. A look of complete incredulity appeared on Song Junwan’s face. Without even formally adjourning the meeting, she flew out, followed by the nine astonished bloodstreak elders. The ten of them saw all of the blood qi on Middle Peak erupting in an unheard-of fashion, and then saw Bai Xiaochun hovering in midair, hair flying around him, eyes shining with coldness, surrounded by a boundlessly somber and desolate air. He looked like a blood devil! “This....” “Heavens! All of the blood qi on the whole mountain peak is gathering around him!!” The bloodstreak elders were completely shaken, and Song Junwan was beginning to pant. At the same time, even more divine sense converged on the area from the prime elders on Ancestor Peak. None of them could remain even the least bit calm. “Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening? How is this even possible!?!?” “I can’t believe young Nightcrypt has such destiny. He’s reached Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening!!” “Dammit! Who tested this kid’s latent talent in the beginning? If we’d known he could pull off Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening with his blood sword cultivation, we would have definitely made sure he reached Earthstring Foundation Establishment!” As the prime elders reeled in shock, an even stronger stream of divine sense appeared, something which completely surpassed the prime elders. It was so powerful that all heaven and earth seemed to distort because of its mere presence. An ancient voice suddenly echoed out into the minds of the prime elders: “Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening can be stumbled upon by chance, but can never be pursued directly. Among 100,000 cultivators who practice Blood Stream Sect techniques, it would be difficult to find even one person who can build up the reserves necessary to have such a unique Ancestral Awakening. An opportunity like this has only presented itself twice in the past. Few people could ever have detected this within him ahead of time.” As everyone watched in shock, blood qi surged like mad into the trembling Bai Xiaochun, who let out a long, piercing cry. The amount of blood qi visible was shocking. Bai Xiaochun was like a black hole, sucking it all in, and as he did, his Undying Skin shone with dazzling light. As of this moment, there was nothing golden about that light; it was utterly and thoroughly the color of blood! That blood color was a symbol that anyone could identify as the hallmark of the Blood Stream Sect. There was no better way for someone to show that they were using the techniques of the Blood Stream Sect than to do exactly what Bai Xiaochun was doing. As the blood-colored light spread out in all directions, Bai Xiaochun threw his head back and bellowed, and an enormous figure appeared behind him, a creature with green skin, vicious-looking facial features, and long, protruding tusks! It had claws sharp enough to tear down all walls, a pointed horn that could rip open the heavens, and a long, scale-covered tail that could sweep across anything and everything. That creature was none other than the legendary berserk ghost!! The sudden appearance of the berserk ghost indicated that Bai Xiaochun had finally completed the first level of the Undying Heavenly King! The instant the image of the berserk ghost appeared, the eyes of Lesser Marsh Peak’s grand elder went wide. As for the blood master from Lesser Marsh Peak, he was shaking visibly, and his eyes were glowing with bright light. “Lesser Marsh Peak must have this Nightcrypt!!” shouted the blood master. The grand elder from Lesser Marsh Peak had the same reaction, and simply couldn’t contain his excitement. On Lesser Marsh Peak, they had a secret magic that had come from years of research into the hand of the Blood Ancestor, a secret magic that was based on a totem tattoo that depicted the berserk ghost! Shockingly, Bai Xiaochun’s Ancestral Awakening caused an actual projection of the berserk ghost to appear. Everyone on Lesser Marsh Peak was being driven to complete madness. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun hovered in midair, roaring at the top of his lungs, absorbing all of the blood qi in the area. After flowing into him, the blood qi then emerged behind him to form the shape of an enormous blood sword. At first, only the tip was fully formed. But as he absorbed more blood qi, the blade began to form, and then the hilt! Although all of this takes a bit of time to describe, it was accomplished in only a few breaths’ worth of time. In the end, an enormous, blood-colored sword appeared! Everyone gasped as Bai Xiaochun raised both hands and grasped the hilt of the sword. “This is my Blood Annihilation World!” he shouted. “You people want to kill me? Well, what if I kill you first!?” Then, he slashed the sword down, sending an arc of blood-colored light shooting toward the dozens of Foundation Establishment cultivators below. As the massive sword descended, more blood qi in the area rushed toward it, merging into it, causing it to grow larger and larger. In the blink of an eye, it was over 30 meters long, radiating an explosive aura of extermination. The Foundation Establishment cultivators’ faces went pale. Howling, they joined forces, unleashing all of the power at their disposal to defend themselves, even their trump cards! BOOOOOOOOOMMM! When the sword hit the cultivators in the front line, they screamed, and their bodies began to tremble on the verge of collapse. Apparently, it started a chain reaction which quickly spread to the cultivators behind them. The blood sword attack which they had just sustained was now threatening to destroy them all. Song Que was in the group, and a vicious look appeared on his face for the second time as he prepared to put his life on the line to counterattack! However, it was at this point that a cold snort echoed out. “Enough is enough! Blood qi, disperse!” The words echoed out like thunder, causing the blood sword in Bai Xiaochun’s hands to tremble, and then rapidly begin to fall apart and disperse. All of Middle Peak trembled as a powerful force swept over it. At the same time, countless spell formations and magical symbols appeared on the surface of the ground, which had been placed on the hand specifically to control the blood qi! Bai Xiaochun’s eyes widened as he sensed the blood qi responding to the voice which had just spoken. It was no longer under his control, almost as if that voice were its true master, and had a much higher level of control over it than he did. However, moments later, he realized that the truth of the matter was that this person’s control over the blood qi was being exerted by outside force, in sharp contrast to himself. After all, he was related to the blood qi! Rage filled Bai Xiaochun’s heart. At the moment, he didn’t care who that voice belonged to, he couldn’t hold back from saying, “No, enough is not enough! When they tried to kill me, how come you didn’t intervene then? Now I’m trying to kill them, and suddenly you say ‘enough is enough’? I refuse to accept this!” From the moment he\u0027d arrived in the Blood Stream Sect, he’d been running around with his tail stuck between his legs. Now he was finally taking some action, only to receive the short end of the stick. At the moment, his desire to kill these Foundation Establishment cultivators only continued to grow. “This is their fault!” he cried, eyes bright red. Although he knew what he was doing might not be the best choice, he exerted all his power to call out to the huge hand, all with the intention of throwing the Blood Stream Sect into chaos. Even if he had to flee the sect afterward, this was his choice. As the blood qi dispersed, as intense pressure weighed down, as the Foundation Establishment cultivators gasped, he burst into motion. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of one of the Foundation Establishment Dharma protectors, whereupon he clenched his hand into a fist and punched out. That cultivator had just been breathing a sigh of relief. Too slow to react to what was happening, he was struck directly by the fist strike, causing blood to spray out of his mouth as his heart and blood vessels began to explode. “You--” His eyes went wide, and before he could say anything more, he was dead. Everyone devolved into chaos and began to flee. Bai Xiaochun was tired of being wronged, and had thrown caution to the wind. His expression was grim, and his eyes radiated killing intent as he attacked once again.

It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama.","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
