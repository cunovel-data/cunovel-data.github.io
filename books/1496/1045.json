{"id":46362,"no":1045,"title":"Chapter 1043: Stupefying Battleship","content":"On the bone galleon, Ghostmother’s phoenix-like eyes narrowed. Despite having been in the Heavenspan Realm for many years, she had been stuck in the Deadmire for most of that time. Furthermore, Bai Xiaochun had progressed significantly since the last time she had encountered him, on the eve of her departure.\n Therefore, she didn’t have a thorough understanding of all of his divine abilities and magical techniques. Nor was she aware of all of his trump cards. Because of that, she wouldn’t make the mistake of underestimating him. Although she didn’t quite view him as being on the same level as herself, she did think of him as being stronger than Daoist Heavenspan.\n As soon as she saw the vortex springing up around his hand, her eyes flashed.\n At the same time, a howl erupted from the mouth of Bai Xiaochun’s Forefather Transformation form. Stepping forward, he gathered the power of the black vortex… and punched out toward the incoming beam of light!\n It was a quintuple-power Undying Emperor’s Fist!!\n Massive rumbling sounds filled heaven and earth as the shadowy emperor also punched out. The two fists overlapped, and then mountain-toppling, sea-draining power smashed into the black beam of light!\n A huge boom rang out as the black beam of light struggled to fight back, but then shattered. Then, Bai Xiaochun’s Undying Emperor’s Fist went on to hit the sea of flames.\n It was like a raging dragon had sliced through the middle of the fire, cutting the sea of flames into two halves. Then, the fist strike continued on toward the ghost faces!\n By that point, though, it was getting weaker. And given how extraordinary the ghost faces were, when they collided, the Undying Emperor’s Fist was vanquished.\n And yet, Bai Xiaochun’s expression didn\u0027t even flicker in response, although he was panting for breath.\n “If quintuple won’t work, then I’ll double it! Decuple power!!”\n An even more shocking pulse of fleshly body power erupted out, becoming a wildly destructive windstorm that slammed into the two ghost faces.\n It was at this point that Ghostmother’s expression flickered. The power of Bai Xiaochun’s decuple-power Undying Emperor’s Fist was something that could be considered rare even among the divine abilities of the Eternal Lands.\n The two ghost faces were completely shaken, and had no choice other than to twist to the side to try to avoid the blow.\n With the two ghost faces out of the way, Bai Xiaochun was now facing the huge bone lizard. Without any hesitation, he used his Undying Hex, becoming a series of afterimages that appeared right above the bone galleon a moment later. Making eye contact with Ghostmother, Bai Xiaochun clenched his right hand into a fist, and then punched at her with another decuple-power Undying Emperor’s Fist!\n As for Ghostmother, although she was clearly shocked, there was a bit of a scornful look in her eyes.\n Even as Bai Xiaochun’s fist strike closed in, a powerful blood qi sprang up around the bone lizard, which rapidly formed into a defensive shield.\n It wasn’t a spell formation, but rather a divine ability connected to the bone galleon, and it formed just in time to meet Bai Xiaochun’s incoming fist strike.\n And although a massive boom echoed out, the shield did not fall. Furthermore, a significant backlash attack hit Bai Xiaochun, causing his face to fall.\n Unlike the beam of light or the sea of flames, this blood mist shield was powerful in defensive strength. In fact, it seemed to be on a completely different level. Cracking sounds rang out inside of Bai Xiaochun as he was thrown backwards, his five yin organs in chaos to the point where he felt like he might explode.\n “How arrogant!” Ghostmother said scornfully. Waving her hand, she summoned two enormous ghost hands, which lunged toward Bai Xiaochun as if to grab him.\n Simultaneously, the bone lizard spat out another sea of fire, cutting off any path of escape.\n As all of this happened, Bai Xiaochun’s powers of regeneration kicked in, and his backlash injuries began to disappear. Then he burst into motion, piercing through the sea of flames and punching out toward the ghost hands.\n Within moments, he was completely back to normal, provoking a slight gasp from Ghostmother.\n “Such powers of regeneration!!!” As of this moment, she finally understood how it was possible that Daoist Heavenspan had been defeated.\n “That is his true secret weapon! But what other trump cards does he have?!” By now, Ghostmother’s heart burned with true greed.\n Based on their very short interchange, Bai Xiaochun already understood a lot more about the battleship than before. “Now that’s a battleship!” he thought. “It’s actually stronger than Ghostmother herself…. Especially its defenses. Absolutely terrifying! And it’s so fast….” By now, he was relatively certain that even a blow from the Greatsword of the North wouldn’t do much to this ship.\n Nor would Ghostmother give him the time to prepare to do so….\n “Ghostmother has true celestial battle prowess, but not enough to make her a major problem for me!” Having reached this conclusion, he decided that at the moment, the true threat was not Ghostmother, but rather… the battleship.\n Meanwhile, Ghostmother took a deep breath. The greed in her eyes hadn’t faded a bit; performing an incantation gesture, she waved her finger, causing screams to erupt from the two ghost faces that had just evaded Bai Xiaochun moments ago. Driven by the torment of the restrictive spells inside of them, they turned and headed toward Bai Xiaochun again.\n At the same time, the battleship began to vibrate, causing the air around it to distort. Apparently, it was building up power to unleash one massive attack.\n Bai Xiaochun’s eyes flickered with the realization that he couldn’t fight this battleship. However, it wouldn’t necessarily be impossible to lock it down temporarily. Completely ignoring the two ghost faces, he unleashed his frigid domain and summoned nine frigid clones, which he sent toward the ghost faces, not in the hopes of defeating them, but just delaying them.\n Then he howled, unleashing another Undying Emperor’s Fist with decuple power, directly toward the bone galleon itself!\n As the fist shot out, a massive vortex appeared!\n He didn’t pause for even a moment. Relying on the regenerative powers of his Undying Blood, he unleashed a second fist strike, then a third and a fourth!\n Boom, boom, boom! Relentless attacks!\n And the vortexes only continued to grow stronger!\n Ghostmother’s face fell as, in the space of a few short breaths of time, Bai Xiaochun unleashed… ten decuple-power Undying Emperor’s Fists!\n Even with his powers of regeneration, it was a level of wastage so intense that it created something like a black hole of spiritual energy, which almost instantly drained everything in a wide area. All of a sudden, the bone battleship was deprived of its fuel source, and was incapable of moving.\n Although it was only temporary, and would last no more than ten breaths of time, that was plenty of time for Bai Xiaochun to work with. Without pausing, he flew back toward the Giant Ghost King, who despite having the moonflower to help him, was being battered soundly by the seven other demigods. Before any of the demigods could react, Bai Xiaochun reached out and clamped his hand down onto the head of the one nearest him.\n He moved so quickly that the man had no chance to dodge or evade. Then, terrifying might erupted from his hand, filling the demigod with a sensation of deadly crisis. Howling, he immediately resorted to self-detonation to try to block Bai Xiaochun.\n As his nascent divinity attempted to flee, the moonflower shot out and gobbled it up!\n At the same time, Bai Xiaochun grabbed the Giant Ghost King and rocketed off into the distance.\n In the blink of an eye, he was far, far away. Only six demigods remained on the battlefield, their scalps tingling in fear at the way Bai Xiaochun had just attacked. For the moment, none of them seemed willing to chase after him.\n In their moment of hesitation, the bone battleship erupted with a mist of blood. No longer affected by what Bai Xiaochun had just done, the ship sprang into motion again.\n As the bone lizard broke free, Ghostmother’s expression flickered grimly, and yet at the same time, with greed. Pointing off into the distance, she said, “Catch him! Or die trying!”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1043","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
