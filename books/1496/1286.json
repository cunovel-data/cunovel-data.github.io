{"id":46603,"no":1286,"title":"Chapter 1284: Single Sparks","content":"Over the ten year period, countless dandelion seeds spread out into the void, all of which contained Bai Xiaochun’s life force and divine sense. They moved with speed that defied the comprehension of cultivators, piercing through the void even faster than Bai Xiaochun could have moved on his own.\n Some landed on various ruins, while others continued on, reaching places far, far away from the Eternal Immortal Domains. And as the dandelion seeds landed and took root, changes began to take place.\n In one particular location was a stretch of ruins completely devoid of any signs of life. It was desolate, withered, and rife with death.\n There was even a misty haze that hung over the area, almost like a sludge.\n A dandelion seed dropped into the haze, and vanished. A few years later, the mist began to fade away, along with the feeling of death….\n Another three years passed, and the mist and aura of death were gone, which was when a delicate sprout rose up from the mud below!!\n Although it was only a tiny sprout, it still represented life!\n It seemed to have broken through some sort of seal, a curse of sorts, which allowed it to spread life force, completely changing the ruins around it!\n Another three years passed, and the sprout bloomed, giving birth to a flower that looked exactly like a moon.\n It was none other than a moonflower!\n When the moonflower bloomed, it emitted a faint, glittering light. It wasn’t particularly dazzling, but in the darkness of the void, it was still breathtaking!\n The light grew stronger, slowly driving away the darkness, growing more stable. Gradually, that portion of the dark void… was becoming bright!!\n And that was only one set of ruins among many. Before long, a second light blazed to life, and then another, and another. One by one, sparks were appearing….\n Although they were single sparks now, that didn’t mean they couldn’t combine into a raging fire!!\n As the dandelion seeds found more and more ruins, and as the years passed, more light appeared…. By now, Bai Xiaochun had been in secluded meditation for more than twenty years.\n Xiaobao was a young man now, whose main impression of his father was that he remained sealed behind a door. However, based on the things that his older brother and sister had told him, he knew that his father was a grand and mighty individual!\n Dabao had taken over the responsibilities of running the Arch-Emperor Dynasty as the heir apparent, and with the help of the Grand Heavenmaster and other powerful experts, assimilated the former Vile-Emperor Dynasty.\n Xiaoxiao had risen to the level of a celestial, but had not gained the approval of the Eternal Mother. However, she had Bai Xiaochun’s approval, and as he transformed into a host of dandelion seeds that spread through the void, the karma between them caused her cultivation base to advance by leaps and bounds. In the short twenty years that passed, she reached the mid Celestial Realm!\n It was at that time… that strange signs occurred!\n The Mortal Renegade hadn’t moved for twenty years, but now, he suddenly trembled. Instantly, the people of the Eternal Immortal Domains descended into vigilant anxiety.\n Both Bai Xiaochun and the Saint-Emperor were still in seclusion, leaving the Eternal Immortal Domains without a single archaean. Thankfully, no meteorites fell; unfortunately, a vortex sprang up on the Mortal Renegade’s forehead.\n As it did, Daoist Heavenspan appeared. He had been scared off years ago by Bai Xiaochun, but now he was back, an unsightly expression on his face as he looked first at the spell formation which bound the Mortal Renegade, and then down at the Eternal Immortal Domains.\n If he could have his way, he would not see the Eternal Immortal Domains destroyed. However, the sleeping Mortal Renegade had sensed some dangerous crisis brewing, and had given him a very specific mission.\n “Break through the spell formation. End Bai Xiaochun’s session of meditation….” Daoist Heavenspan had mixed feelings regarding Bai Xiaochun, feelings that he had not been able to sort out even after all the years that had passed.\n Daoist Heavenspan knew that he had no choice in the matter. Although he was an apprentice, the truth was that most of his actions were controlled by his own Dao. And the origin of that Dao, that of nirvanic extermination, was the Mortal Renegade.\n Sometimes Daoist Heavenspan asked himself if it was all worth it. And he wondered if he could go back to the very beginning, if he might have made different choices. But there was no real way to answer that question. He could only suppress his melancholy, and look out with sharply cold eyes. As of this moment, he waved his arm, causing the vortex in the Mortal Renegade’s forehead to swirl. Then, howls and roars could be heard as a vast horde of devilish specters emerged!\n There were too many of them to count, a massive army that was now at the command of Daoist Heavenspan. Without any hesitation, the army charged toward the spell formation that Bai Xiaochun had set up using the Essence of time.\n Rumbling sounds echoed out into the void, and quickly caught the attention of the cultivators down below in the Eternal Immortal Domains. Shocked, they began to rotate their cultivation bases to fight back!\n This was one of the marvelous aspects of the spell formation. Every single formation node in the entire spell formation was linked to a cultivator, which made it nearly invincible!\n However, if enough of the nodes were broken, then it would eventually fall. All that would be required was enough time.\n The assault on the spell formation lasted for three years!\n During that time, rumbling sounds filled the sky above the Eternal Immortal Domains both day and night. Daoist Heavenspan wasn’t concerned at all with how much time it was taking. There were too many devilish specters inside of the Mortal Renegade to even count, and even if they were all killed, Daoist Heavenspan wouldn’t care. Despite the heavy losses that the army of devilish specters sustained during the three years, Daoist Heavenspan did not call off the offensive.\n Furthermore, the constant assault was pushing the spell formation to the brink of detonation. Black marks could be seen spreading across its surface, staining the Essence of time, and causing the spell formation to slowly grow weaker.\n “It won’t be long now….” Daoist Heavenspan murmured. Waving his hand, he sent even more devilish specters charging forth in attack….\n It was a difficult time for the cultivators in the Eternal Immortal Domains. Virtually none of them were able to focus on cultivation. They were forced to sit there cross-legged and focus their energy on the spell formation, powering it with their cultivation bases to resist the advance of the devilish specters.\n Although the two parties were separated by the formation, they were involved in a very strange and unique showdown!\n Meanwhile, the dandelion seeds that contained Bai Xiaochun’s life force and divine sense had thoroughly disseminated throughout the void. They descended onto the ruins everywhere, even into that floating field of coffins that he had once encountered.\n With each year that passed, more light flared to life…. As of now, if one looked out into the void, there was dazzling starlight everywhere! As of now, it could truly be called a starry sky again!\n The changes caused the sleeping Mortal Renegade to grow even more restless, and Daoist Heavenspan was likewise gripped by anxiety. He could sense the fury of the Mortal Renegade, and when he looked out at the rapidly deteriorating spell formation, it was with completely bloodshot eyes.\n “It’s about time… to end things! Bai Xiaochun is in seclusion, and thanks to the help of the Mortal Renegade, I\u0027m now a half-sovereign. As of this moment… nobody can stop me!”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1284","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
