After a moment, he looked away from the Eternal Flower on the right.\\n\\n The old boatman took out another jug of alcohol, took a sip, and then looked at Bai Xiaochun.\\n\\n “That flower really suits you. It’s not going back to the beginning, but neither is it the true ending.”\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun didn’t say anything, and it was impossible to tell what he was thinking. He looked at the flower on the left, and then the flower on the right, and finally, closed his eyes again.\\n\\n “Why don’t you take that flower on the right? It seems wonderful to me. Although, both of them are actually acceptable…. Trying to pick between the two seems like a very difficult choice.” The old man sighed. Truthfully, not even he would have an easy time making this choice.\\n\\n “One of them features a set conclusion. Although it would conform to your desires, everything is already set.\\n\\n “The other features endless possibilities, and a future brimming with options. Maybe you could make things more perfect. Maybe you could get rid of all your doubts, and make your future exactly the way you want it.”\\n\\n The old man shook his head. “How will you pick…? Would you like to have a drink while you consider?” \\n\\n With that, he held out his jug of alcohol.\\n\\n “There’s no need.” Bai Xiaochun said. Opening his eyes, he looked out at the two flowers.

It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \\n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
