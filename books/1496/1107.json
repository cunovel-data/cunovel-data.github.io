Then he thought back to some of the things Bai Xiaochun had done in the past, and his heart began to pound. He definitely regretted telling him the truth. “Xiaochun, don’t do anything rash! Even without Godsifter Prefecture, we still have options. I got my position from the Saint-Emperor himself! There’s no way that this Celestial Aged Spirit will push things too far! He’ll surely give me some compensation….” Bai Xiaochun rose to his feet, slowly shaking his head. The Giant Ghost King anxiously moved to block his path. “Xiaochun, even if you do something, we need to think of the long-term plan. Killing Celestial Aged Spirit won’t solve anything.” At this point, a strange expression appeared on Bai Xiaochun’s face. “I never said anything about killing Celestial Aged Spirit,” he said. “That bastard works in underhanded ways, so I’m going to go embarrass him a bit, that’s all. Listen, old pal, you don’t need to worry about anything at all. Just rest up a bit while I head out.” With that, he sidestepped the Giant Ghost King and left. The Giant Ghost King couldn’t quite envision what Bai Xiaochun planned to do, and before he could decide whether or not to try to continue to persuade him to stop, he was gone. The Giant Ghost King stood there alone in the main hall, sighing. Finally, he stamped his foot. In the end, his cultivation base was too low to catch up to Bai Xiaochun, so therefore, he sat back down, grabbed an alcohol jug, and kept drinking. Things had been so wonderful in Godsifter Prefecture at the beginning, but now, all of that was gone. Even his ambition had taken a significant blow because of what had happened. It affected him so badly that Bai Xiaochun was able to tell that something was wrong just by looking at him. -- By now, Bai Xiaochun was far from the capital city, speeding northward! Considering that he was a celestial, and that he was pushing all-out, there was nothing that could match him in terms of speed. Although the northern prefectures weren’t very close, they also couldn’t be considered to be very far away. Dawn hadn’t even come by the time Bai Xiaochun caught sight of the northern part of this immortal domain. It was an icy and snowy place, incredibly cold. Snowflakes filled the air, and a bleak wind whimpered in the night air…. After arriving, Bai Xiaochun scanned the area with divine sense, and then locked onto one specific area. In one particular city, in a seemingly ordinary immortal’s cave, Gongsun Wan’er sat cross-legged in meditation. As the celestial in charge of this northern part of the second immortal domain, she didn’t actually need to be present in the north all the time. But after returning to the Vile-Emperor Dynasty from being kidnapped, the Vile-Emperor had realized that she was slightly different than the old Ghostmother, and had become slightly suspicious of her. In order to prove herself, and to solidify her position within the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, she had come here and taken over the fifth prefecture to prove her loyalty. Even as she sat there in meditation, her heart stirred, and her phoenix-like eyes opened. She was inherently beautiful, an effect that was even more pronounced as she looked coldly out of the corner of her eye at the entrance to her immortal\u0027s cave. For some reason, despite her beauty, she seemed profoundly icy and cold. Before long, Bai Xiaochun’s voice could be heard outside. His only company as he stood outside of her immortal\u0027s cave was the gently falling snowflakes. As he looked at the entrance, he cleared his throat, not sure of what to say that would be completely appropriate. After all, he had come to ask for help. Therefore, he decided to try to play on their somewhat close relationship. “Wan\u0027er, you know it’s me. Why don’t you open the door?” When she heard his words, she smiled. Although she was inclined to ignore him, she finally waved her hand, causing the entrance to swing open. He hurried in to find Gongsun Wan’er smiling at him. None of the coldness from before was present, although her eyes were as mysterious as always. “What are you doing here so late, sweetie?” she said, somewhat flirtatiously. “Don’t tell me you want to spend the night with me?” Eyes flickering with a mysterious light, she gently licked her lips. “You’d let me spend the night with you?” Bai Xiaochun answered, his heart starting to pound. The truth was that if he didn’t need Gongsun Wan’er’s help, he would never have come to see her. Before he could say anything else though, his expression flickered, and he backed up. At the same time, Gongsun Wan’er chuckled. “You’re a celestial now, sweetie. I\u0027m very interested to see if you qualify to spend the night with me.” She suddenly blurred into motion, appearing in the spot where he had just stood, her right hand flashing with an incantation gesture. A whooshing sound then rang out as the air began to distort around her, tugging the light toward her to form a vortex. “What are you doing?” Bai Xiaochun blurted. “I\u0027m not spending the night with you!” However, Gongsun Wan’er didn’t even respond. Flashing a radiant smile, she closed in on him again. “Are you crazy, Gongsun Wan’er?! I saved your life!” Heart pounding, he dodged out of the way again, only to find her coming around for another shot. At this point, he was starting to get angry. “You psycho! We’ve known each other for a long time, have you forgotten? I don’t have any ill intentions! I saved your life! And I\u0027m here to ask for your help!” Gongsun Wan’er’s eyes glittered in response to his words. However, having discovered that he continued to dodge her, she increased her speed, becoming like a shooting star that headed toward him, her right hand extended like a claw toward his forehead! Now truly angry, Bai Xiaochun stopped evading. Performing an incantation gesture with his right hand, he imbued it with the power of his Sutra of Former Reincarnation, then struck out at her. A boom rang out as Gongsun Wan’er was struck. She yelped in shock as a host of magical symbols appeared around her, which were none other than her memories. As they rotated, it felt to her like she was being struck by lightning. Bai Xiaochun wasn’t in any better shape. Her meteor-like blow seemingly stabbed through him, creating something like an invisible black hole. Instantly, he was surrounded by streams of death energy that Bai Xiaochun’s divine sense revealed to be innumerable evil ghosts! “Dammit, you know I\u0027m afraid of ghosts! I can’t believe you’re trying to scare me!” However, because of how close Gongsun Wan’er was to him, and how she was bound in place by all the magical symbols, he quickly pulled his hand back and then slapped her on her attractive rear end…. A loud smacking sound rang out, and Gongsun Wan’er’s expression distorted. As a result, the evil ghosts stopped in place. Meanwhile, true killing intent appeared in Gongsun Wan’er’s eyes. Seeing that his strategy had been effective, Bai Xiaochun pulled his hand back again to deliver another blow. “Feeling suicidal, Bai Xiaochun?!?!” she said furiously. However, how could Bai Xiaochun not take advantage of the fact that she was completely immobilized by his Sutra of Former Reincarnation? Therefore, he let swing another slap, and another, and another…. After spanking her ten times, Gongsun Wan’er’s anger suddenly vanished, to be replaced by a somewhat dazed expression. That dazed look struck fear into Bai Xiaochun’s heart. However, as soon as he stopped spanking her, the killing intent appeared in her eyes again, so he quickly struck her rear end again. And thus, she calmed down again. Soon, the dazed look turned into complete blankness, and she was even panting a bit. At that point, Bai Xiaochun was truly struck with fear. “Wan\u0027er, can you do me a favor? Tomorrow, find an opportunity to publicly announce that the reason you took over this prefecture is that the demigod preceptor Marquis Zi Lin has been secretly working for your Smile-Emperor Dynasty.” “Forget it!” she said, the blank look in her eyes fading a bit. Feeling very anxious, Bai Xiaochun hardened his heart and spanked her another dozen or so times. By this point, she was starting to go a bit limp. In fact, without Bai Xiaochun holding her up, she would have just sagged down to the ground. Heart racing, Bai Xiaochun growled, “Agree? Or not?!” Panting for breath, Gongsun Wan’er gritted her teeth and refused to speak. After spanking her some more, her eyes went almost completely blank. Finally, she hissed, “Fine, I agree… now get the hell out of here!!” As far as Bai Xiaochun was concerned, this interaction with Gongsun Wan’er had been bizarre to the extreme. After finally getting her to agree, he quickly left her immortal\u0027s cave, feeling slightly guilty, but at the same time, almost in a bit of a daze. “I can’t believe Gongsun Wan’er is so resilient….” he muttered to himself, blinking a few times. For some reason, there was some sort of vile fire burning in his heart now, something he couldn’t get rid of. “Vixen! She just seduced me, didn’t she!?” In the end, he could only sigh at how outstanding he was. Sometimes, he frightened even himself.

It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama.","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
