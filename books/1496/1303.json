{"id":46620,"no":1303,"title":"Chapter 1301: That’s It?","content":"The Mortal Renegade had fought Bai Xiaochun using his Vile-Emperor clone, and had faced his Waterswamp Kingdom on that occasion. But at that time, his true form had been asleep, and the clone had been unable to provide detailed feedback about the encounter.\n Therefore, this was the Mortal Renegade’s first time encountering the Waterswamp Kingdom in person!\n He couldn’t help but be shaken by the vicious and violent crocodilian turtle, and the terrifying energy fluctuations emanating off of it. Perhaps if he hadn’t seen the ancient historical events playing out around that vortex, it might have been a different story. But he had witnessed with his own eyes how that crocodilian turtle had been dispatched from beyond this starry sky, and had been sent with a specific mission.\n The mere fact that Bai Xiaochun could summon it was profoundly shocking to the Mortal Renegade. However, despite understanding the matters of karma involved, he had no time to think over the matter in detail. As soon as the crocodilian turtle lunged toward him, he fell back at top speed, simultaneously sending out another Finger of Extermination.\n The crocodilian turtle threw his head back and roared, completely disregarding the Finger of Extermination as he charged forward aggressively. The Finger of Extermination was immediately destroyed, and the crocodilian turtle’s energy only seemed to be growing more powerful. His howls caused the starry sky to tremble as he bore down on the Mortal Renegade in completely domineering fashion.\n The Mortal Renegade’s face fell as he continued to back up, his hands flashing in a double-handed incantation gesture. Instantly, black smoke shot out, forming into a huge face rife with magical symbols, its expression fierce to the extreme. Opening its mouth, it shot toward the crocodilian turtle as if to devour him.\n However, that was when the crocodilian turtle’s eyes shone with mysterious light, and suddenly, he opened his mouth in shocking fashion as well! From a distance, it was obvious that the turtle was simply too big for the face to do anything about him. In fact, in the following moment, the turtle snapped up the face!\n Then, without pausing for a moment, he continued on toward the Mortal Renegade!\n As the starry sky trembled, Bai Xiaochun looked on nervously. Obviously, he understood a lot more about his life essence spirit than the Mortal Renegade. After all, he had been using the Waterswamp Kingdom from almost the moment he began to practice cultivation. Step by step, his cultivation base had grown higher, until the point where he witnessed the events of ancient history only moments before. That was when he was suddenly inspired to take out his turtle-wok and send it out, backed by the power of his sovereign cultivation base.\n With all of the various elements coming together, his Waterswamp Kingdom completely transformed. Now, the majestic crocodilian turtle shone with golden light, and emanated a ferocious air that surpassed anything from before. He left even Bai Xiaochun feeling a bit jumpy.\n As for why Bai Xiaochun had been able to summon this mysterious crocodilian turtle from beyond the starry sky, he was already fairly certain of the general details. He had been born on the Eternal Flower, and thus, could also be considered one of many Eternal Sons. After the Eternal Flower captured the crocodilian turtle, he became her companion spirit, and thus, it was only natural that someone with the blood of the Eternal Immortal Domains would be able to summon him, albeit with some difficulty.\n And clearly, his turtle-wok also had something to do with it!\n “Don’t tell me… that the final battle is going to be won by my life essence spirit?” The thought excited him. After all, if the crocodilian turtle could dispatch the Mortal Renegade, that would make things a lot easier.\n As Bai Xiaochun looked on excitedly, the Mortal Renegade’s eyes turned pitch black, and he threw his hands over his head, causing black light to spill out in all directions. At the same time, a vortex appeared on his forehead, within which was a magical sigil!\n It was a sigil that depicted a battleship!\n As the magical sigil appeared, the Mortal Renegade began to speak words in an incomprehensible language, a curse of sorts that caused a boundless, ancient, and corrosive attack to spread out into the space around him.\n Time seemed to slow, causing Bai Xiaochun’s heart to pound. Then, the starry sky beneath the Mortal Renegade’s feet suddenly shattered like a mirror!\n As it did, an ancient battleship shot out into the open, radiating a shocking aura of death!!\n “You have sought your own death, foul creature!” the Mortal Renegade shouted. The entire starry sky trembled as a massive, tempest-like energy spread out, causing even Bai Xiaochun to back up in shock.\n However… the Mortal Renegade had truly underestimated the crocodilian turtle. In addition to being fierce, he was also completely voracious, and apparently, didn’t usually take the time to think things through. Of course, Bai Xiaochun had experienced that first hand in the past…. \n As soon as the battleship was out in the open, the crocodilian turtle didn’t pause for a moment before taking action. Eyes shining with madness, he opened his huge mouth, completely ignored the deadly energy emanating off of the battleship, and lunged forward….\n With a snap, he gobbled up both the battleship and the Mortal Renegade!!\n Despite how much Bai Xiaochun knew about this turtle, his eyes still bulged as wide as if he had just watched a mortal eating a bolt of lightning.\n “Can you eat… anything?!” he blurted, shocked. The crocodilian turtle looked very pleased with himself as he threw his head back and roared. Obviously, he felt more than a bit of pride at having swallowed his opponent. Ignoring Bai Xiaochun’s shock, he shot back toward the swamp, then sank down inside it, whereupon… the swamp faded away.\n Bai Xiaochun looked on, flabbergasted.\n “That’s… that’s it? What about my wok…?” He was still of the impression that his life essence spirit was very unreliable. Furthermore, he now felt a distinct sensation that there were explosive and violent fluctuations coming from whatever dimension the Waterswamp Kingdom existed in now.\n At that point, he didn’t waste any time. Hands flashing with a double-handed incantation gesture, he caused the vortex of time to spring up again, and immediately shifted time to return to reality!\n “The Mortal Renegade will definitely get out. I can’t waste any time!” He flashed like lightning into the vortex, vanishing, to reappear… back in reality. Once there, he vanished again, and then reappeared in the location of the former Immortal World, where the only thing that remained of it was its ruins!\n Other than the Eternal Immortal Domains themselves, there was no place among the 1,080,000 worlds of the starry sky where Bai Xiaochun felt more of a sense of belonging than here. It was the qi flow of this place that had propelled him from being a celestial into being an archaean!\n As soon as he appeared in the ruins of the Immortal World, he immediately got to work. For one thing, he sent out his divine sense to personally light up the ruins of the Immortal World. And at the same time, he took advantage of the fact that the Mortal Renegade’s Dao clones were not being properly controlled to fight them with full force. In all 1,080,000 worlds within the starry sky, his Dao clones attacked with everything they had!\n The war between Bai Xiaochun and the Mortal Renegade that continued to be fought in all of those worlds was now different from earlier. Before, Bai Xiaochun’s Dao clones had been weaker, but now that Bai Xiaochun had returned, they almost immediately gained the upper hand. And as a result, the brightness in the starry sky immediately began to surpass the darkness!\n Within the ruins of the Immortal World, Bai Xiaochun sat down cross-legged, his divine sense spread out as he used his true self’s full power, all of his Dao, and even his sovereign aura, to cause everything around him to burst with light and life force!\n At the same time, he kept a bit of divine sense locked onto the mysterious dimension where the Waterswamp Kingdom was located. That way, he would immediately be notified if the Mortal Renegade freed himself, and would go to block his path!\n One breath of time after another passed. Within the 1,080,000 worlds, the Mortal Renegade’s Dao clones suffered defeat after defeat, and dazzling light continued to shine out. Soon, Bai Xiaochun’s divine sense caused all of the darkness to be driven from the Immortal World, and the seed which had been planted there began to shine brightly. From a distance, the ruins of the Immortal World looked like a dazzling candle!\n As soon as that candle sprang to life, Bai Xiaochun shivered… at the sensation of that mysterious energy, once again coming into being!\n Apparently, after bringing light to the Immortal World, that mysterious energy became vastly more distinct!\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1301","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
