{"id":46576,"no":1259,"title":"Chapter 1257: Are You Really Cursing Me?","content":"The most fearsome aspect of the Sutra of Future Pāramitā was how it connected fates. Both parties would be equally wounded, which might not have been particularly outstanding under normal circumstances. However, Bai Xiaochun had the powers of regeneration that came with the Undying Codex, as well as shocking fleshly body power…. He would normally only be harmed by sixty or seventy percent of a full attack; any serious injuries would quickly be healed, and any light injuries were essentially gone instantly. Unless his opponent possessed similar powers of regeneration, any fight under these circumstances would be very uneven. Blood was currently spewing out of the mouth of the Vile-Emperor, and as he looked at the stone in Bai Xiaochun’s hand, his eyes flickered with panic. He still was ready to keep fighting, except, he still underestimated Bai Xiaochun’s shamelessness…. Just when he was about to move, Bai Xiaochun stuck his right hand out in front of himself and then smashed it into his own chest. A muffled thump rang out, and blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth as he staggered backward. The Undying Codex was powerful, and immediately went to work, but he didn’t forget to cry out, “Aiya! You hit me! Ow, that hurts….” The Vile-Emperor’s eyes went wide, and even as he prepared to unleash his next attack, another thumping sound could be heard, and blood sprayed out of his mouth. As of this point, his hair was disheveled, and he looked to be in really bad shape. “How shameless of you, Bai Xiaochun!!” he shouted, feeling like he was about to go insane. The humiliation he had endured so far was indescribable, and he already deeply regretted his decisions to probe Bai Xiaochun a bit. He was simply too difficult to deal with. His Vile Imperial Crystals had been destroyed, his bone dragon sealed, and his sun had exploded. And in the end, he even ended up being injured. If that were all there were to it, he might have been able to accept it, but then Bai Xiaochun resorted to the bizarre tactic of hurting himself…. The Vile-Emperor couldn’t properly express how crazed he felt. He normally maintained a somber visage, but thanks to Bai Xiaochun, the entire mood of the fight had completely changed…. “Are you really cursing me, you old codger? If you do that, you’re going to hurt my feelings!” Glaring, Bai Xiaochun clenched his hand into a fist and hit himself in the pit of the stomach. Blood sprayed out of the Vile-Emperor’s mouth, and his lips quivered as he howled at the top of his lungs. Even as he tried to charge forward to attack, Bai Xiaochun punched himself seven or eight more times. In the end, the Vile-Emperor felt like he was about to explode. In order to break the connection between the two of them, he hefted his trident and, eyes flickering with madness, began to squeeze his hand down on it! “Detonate!!” he howled. The trident, a magical item belonging to the Mortal Renegade, exploded, causing a black tempest to explode out into the air, right between Bai Xiaochun and the Vile-Emperor! Booms rang out as blood sprayed out of both of their mouths, and they staggered backward. The explosion apparently interfered with natural law, and even affected the cycle of reincarnation. As it rushed out… it severed the connection of fate that had been created by Bai Xiaochun’s Sutra of Future Pāramitā!! As that happened, and as Bai Xiaochun’s wounds began to recover thanks to his Undying Codex, his eyes flickered with cold light. Not doing anything to hide his cultivation base any longer, he accelerated, the energy of an archaean raging around him as he bore down on the Vile-Emperor! Worried that he wasn’t going fast enough, he used his Undying Hex, and then, as he closed in, the Mountain Shaking Bash! With every moment that passed, he moved faster than before, appearing right in front of the Vile-Emperor only a moment later. Then, as he reached out toward the Vile-Emperor, he utilized his Throat Crushing Grasp! Everything was happening too quickly. Earlier, the Vile-Emperor might have had the wherewithal to dodge, but now he was severely injured, and just didn’t have what it took. Although he managed to twist his head out of the way, Bai Xiaochun’s grasping attack still managed to hit his shoulder! “Show me what you really look like!!” Bai Xiaochun roared. Gripping down hard with his hand, he began to rip the skin off the Vile-Emperor’s shoulder!! The Vile-Emperor howled and tried to back up, but that only revealed… the wriggling flesh beneath his skin. As his flesh peeled off, the natural laws of the Eternal Immortal Domains took effect, preventing him from maintaining a human form. Twitching and spasming, he transformed into a giant, blood-colored lizard!! He continued to scream in rage and pain as, bereft of his protective skin, and bereft of the spiderweb covering that had protected his egg sac, he was now subject to the natural laws of the Eternal Immortal Domains, which immediately sought to wipe him out of existence! When the huge lizard appeared, the remaining people of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty down below were completely stunned, especially the celestials who had participated in the events within the spiderweb area. They almost couldn’t believe what they were seeing. “That’s a sovereign clone!!” “What… what exactly is going on here?!?!” “Impossible. This is completely impossible. The Vile-Emperor… is actually a clone of the sovereign?!?!” Countless cries of shock and alarm filled the air as the shocking truth was revealed: the Vile-Emperor was actually a vicious, bizarre creature! Although not everyone knew where this lizard came from, the exclamations of the celestials were heard by the surrounding cultivators, leading to widespread shock. Of course, there was no way Bai Xiaochun was going to let this opportunity pass him by. Pointing his finger at the howling lizard, he spoke in a loud voice that everyone could hear. “Fellow Daoists of the Eternal Immortal Domains. It has been years now since the Vile-Emperor was killed by a clone of the Enemy from Beyond. He was skinned, and then replaced. This bizarre creature you are looking at is none other than that clone!” Gasps rang out in response to his words, and immediately, people began to spread word to the rest of the Eternal Immortal Domains. It was also in that exact same moment that the sky rippled, and the Saint-Emperor stepped out into the open. When he saw that the Vile-Emperor was now a huge lizard, he was deeply shaken. Not even he could ever have guessed that the Vile-Emperor was actually… a clone of the great Enemy!! Glaring coldly at the huge lizard, he said, “No wonder you freed the creature that emerged from the stone of flesh and blood that fell when the damaged fan arrived!! [1] “No wonder you always came up with excuses not to go check the seal that had been placed on the sovereign!” Even as everyone reeled in shock, the lizard looked up with bloodshot eyes, to glare at Bai Xiaochun! “You ruined all of my plans, Bai Xiaochun! And for that, you shall die!!” Howling, the lizard’s aura began to power up to heaven-defying levels. At the same time, it was possible to see a black light glowing on the forehead of the enormous Mortal Renegade up in the heavens. That light healed the lizard of all its wounds, and caused his cultivation base and battle prowess to surpass anything from before, reaching unprecedented heights. Simultaneously, a figure took shape behind the lizard, which, to the shock of all onlookers… was a smaller version of the enormous sovereign!! As the Saint-Emperor’s face fell, the lizard began to emanate a murderous aura, and shouted, “Nobody can stop the Revered Extermination from awakening!” Then, the lizard trembled, whereupon countless black locusts exploded out from inside of him!! In the blink of an eye, they covered heaven and earth alike in numbers too great to count, creating something like a black cloud. Buzzing sounds filled the air as some of them shot toward Bai Xiaochun, and others... spread out to infect the surrounding cultivators! No one recognized these locusts, except for Bai Xiaochun, who had seen them before. Shaken, he recalled the Mortal Renegade’s divine ability, that he himself had witnessed within the memories of the Worldly Daoist! He knew that once these locusts infected a host, that they would absorb the victim’s flesh, blood, and cultivation base, and then give birth to more locusts! 1.

It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama.","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
