{"id":45996,"no":679,"title":"Chapter 677: Study Away, Majordomo Bai...","content":"Gritting his teeth inwardly, but maintaining a very calm expression, the chief of the Cai Clan rose to his feet and said, “Majordomo Bai, please, calm yourself….” \n The clan elders had similar reactions. All of them could tell that Bai Xiaochun’s act of breaking the soul bottle indicated that he was not here out of any expression of goodwill.\n Clearly, he wasn\u0027t going to wipe out their lives, but he was definitely planning to wipe out their thousand years of reserves!\n “That was only the first thing we planned to show you. Just wait a moment, Majordomo Bai, there’s more to come.” Taking a deep breath, the clan chief then issued some more orders.\n Before long, another clan member hurried over with five soul bottles, which were placed in front of Bai Xiaochun. When Bai Xiaochun eyed them, his heart immediately began to beat faster.\n “A thousand years of reserve savings….” he thought, his mouth going a bit dry. However, he forced a frown onto his face.\n The clan chief’s heart surged with pain as he realized that if the clan didn’t bleed today, they would be put in great danger. Gritting his teeth, he transmitted some more messages, whereupon more clan members arrived, this time to place over a hundred bracelets of holding in front of Bai Xiaochun!\n Unexpectedly, each and every one of the bracelets of holding was packed with soul medicine. There was so much that it would be impossible to count in a short period of time. The mere sight of it all got Bai Xiaochun’s heart pounding, and he suddenly realized what exactly the thousand year reserve savings of an aristocratic necromancer clan was like.\n And yet, he continued to frown with just as much displeasure as before.\n The scene playing out caused profound bitterness to grip the heart of the clan chief. Although the things he had offered up were not all of the Cai Clan’s thousand years of reserve savings, they were a significant portion. However, considering the danger the clan was in, he had to endure the pain he felt in his heart and send more messages.\n Soon, a steady stream of trembling clan members came, bringing all sorts of items with them. There were more than a thousand magical items, many of them spirit enhanced. However, after seeing everything, Bai Xiaochun shot to his feet, looking completely livid as he said, “Clan Chief Cai, I\u0027m here to try to save your Cai Clan from calamity! However, it seems you hold me in complete contempt. Are you really trying to please me with trash like this? Fine. Fine! I’m done with this matter!” \n Swishing his sleeve, he chuckled coldly and prepared to leave.\n The clan chief’s expression flickered, and his frustration surged to the point where he almost lost control. He had already offered quite a bit of resources, only to be rebuffed. Furthermore, he had already given everything he had the authority to give. Everything else… was considered the foundation of the clan, and the decision to do anything with them was beyond him.\n At this point, the Cai Clan’s grand elder took a deep breath and stepped forward, a smile on his face. He knew that it was a critical moment for the clan. Unlike the other two great clans, their patriarch was dead. That meant that if they weren’t willing to part with some of their wealth, they would be courting a major disaster. The entire clan could end up getting wiped out.\n “Majordomo Bai, please wait a moment. The Cai Clan still has more treasures for you to study….” He turned to look at one of the other clan elders nearby. “Old Third, open the inner storehouse and bring out… everything!” \n The elder who had been spoken to sighed, bowed his head, and hurried away.\n Bai Xiaochun stopped walking. Currently, his heart was pounding with anticipation. The truth was that the gifts which had been offered him so far actually left him very moved. Softening his expression a bit, he went back and sat down again.\n Before long, a trembling Cai Clan cultivator hurried over with a little pagoda!\n It wasn’t a soulhoarding pagoda, but rather, a pagoda crafted from wood. Bai Xiaochun scanned it with divine sense to find that it was filled with multi-colored flame…. It had everything from ten-colored flame all the way up to fifteen-colored flame, six tongues of it!\n And yet, things weren’t over yet. Another clan member brought a bone slip, which contained the Cai Clan’s formulas for everything from fifteen- to seventeen-colored flame. Even as he was accepting the bone slip, another clan member arrived… with a deva soul!\n It was a fire-type soul contained in a crystal box, and the sight of it finally caused Bai Xiaochun’s expression to brighten a bit. He even gasped slightly…. The members of the Cai Clan had been watching him closely, and noticed the change. As for the clan chief, his heart was wracked with indescribable pain; as of this moment, more than half of the reserve savings of the clan had been handed over.\n Even the Nascent Soul experts who were guarding Bai Xiaochun were completely stunned by everything that was being spread out in front of him.\n As for Chen Hai, he was actually waiting outside, but had he been inside to witness what was happening, he would have been completely stunned.\n “Will this do, Majordomo Bai?” the clan chief asked.\n Bai Xiaochun licked his lips. By now, his heart was pounding so hard it was like thunder in his ears. However, he didn’t answer the question immediately, nor did he collect the items up. Instead, he just patted his bag of holding expectantly.\n The Cai Clan cultivators who had just been sighing with relief were suddenly even more nervous than before.\n A very, very long moment passed. Bai Xiaochun was started to get anxious. One of the reasons he had been so confident going into this situation was that he had sent a message earlier into his bag of holding, to the little turtle, saying that he was hunting for treasure. The little turtle had been immediately intrigued by the prospect.\n However, as of yet, he had received no word from the little turtle. Seeing that everyone was looking at him, he finally cleared his throat and said, “Clan Chief Cai, back in Giant Ghost City, you chased me for a full day trying to kill me…. It got me so terrified that I couldn\u0027t focus on my cultivation.”\n Bai Xiaochun sighed.\n The clan chief’s eyelid twitched, and he looked over at the grand elder sitting next to him. The grand elder’s expression turned even grimmer than before as he gritted his teeth and looked around at the other clan members.\n “Give him all of the soul medicine you have. Everyone.” The other clan members quickly pulled out the soul medicine they had, as well as other random objects and began to hand them over. As long as they could get Bai Xiaochun to leave, they would do anything.\n It didn’t take long before a large heap of soul medicine was right in front of Bai Xiaochun. Of course, the purpose of the grand elder doing this was to show to Bai Xiaochun that they really had run out of things to give him.\n Bai Xiaochun was starting to feel a bit embarrassed, but the fact that the little turtle hadn’t sent him a message yet indicated that something strange was going on. Perhaps the Cai Clan… was hiding some truly powerful magical treasure. Therefore, he cleared his throat again.\n “How very polite of all of you,” he said. Sighing, he shook his head and said, “Now that I think about it, I\u0027m a bit embarrassed about the matter of burning up your soulgrounds…. I really do feel guilty about that.”\n Blue veins were bulging out on the neck and face of the clan chief as he realized how vicious this Bai Hao was…. And yet, there was nothing he could do about the matter.\n “Oh, they were some trifling soulgrounds, nothing more,” he said. “Don’t feel guilty, Majordomo Bai. From now on, our soulgrounds all belong to you. If you want to burn them to the ground, feel free to do so.”\n The fact that the Cai Clan was actually offering their soulgrounds to him left Bai Xiaochun at a bit of a loss about what to do next. He was finally thinking that he might need to call it a day, when… the little turtle’s voice suddenly rang out in his mind.\n “Hey, little punk, Lord Turtle found a big treasure! Heavens! I can\u0027t believe the Cai Clan has a powerful magical item like this. Even in the Heavenspan River area, something like this would be considered rare. In the Wildlands, it’s even more valuable….” The little turtle went on to provide some further descriptions, whereupon Bai Xiaochun’s eyes began to shine. But then, a moment later, his expression turned grim as he looked over at the grand elder and the clan chief.\n When the rest of the clan members saw that, their hearts began to pound.\n “Clan Chief Cai, I heard that your Cai Clan… has a spiritjade statue…. I would very much like to take a look at it.” An icy gleam ran through his eyes.\n Although his words didn’t mean much to the ordinary clan members, when the clan chief and the grand elder heard them, their faces fell, and they began to tremble with disbelief.\n The spiritjade statue was the Cai Clan’s greatest secret, something that, other than the patriarch, only the clan chief and the grand elder knew about. It was a strictly kept secret that they were sure not even a demigod would be able to uncover, let alone Bai Xiaochun.\n And yet, somehow, he had discovered their secret. The only explanation they could think of… was that the Giant Ghost King actually did know about it. And the only way he could know about it was if he learned about it from their patriarch!!\n Madness rose in their hearts as they exchanged a glance. The spiritjade statue was of incredible importance to them, and was the true reserve savings of the clan. It was their signature treasure, and was what had helped the Cai Clan cultivators advance in their cultivation more rapidly than the average person!\n As of this moment, it didn’t matter how defiant they were, they had no choice but to bring it out…. The clan chief felt so completely powerless that he couldn\u0027t move. As for the grand elder, he sighed, took a step forward, and vanished. When he reappeared, he waved his sleeve, causing a three-meter-tall statue of a woman to appear in front of Bai Xiaochun.\n The spiritjade statue caused blinding, colorful light to fill the area, as well as incredibly strong spiritual energy. In a barren place like the Wildlands, spiritual energy like that was an assault on the senses!\n Everyone was completely shocked, and immediately began to look at the statue with envious expressions.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-677","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
