{"id":45626,"no":309,"title":"Chapter 307: Target... Bai Xiaochun!","content":"“So, this is the terrifying level of a tenfold spirit enhancement!!” The patriarchs of the Profound Stream Sect almost couldn’t believe their eyes, and were completely shaken. If people like them had such a reaction, then there was no need to even mention the Profound Stream Sect’s Gold Core cultivators, whose scalps were tingling in astonishment.\n Even the Blood Stream Sect cultivators felt their minds reeling. As for the patriarchs, they had known in the past that the Heavenhorn Sword was something to take very seriously, but to see with their own eyes how domineering it was forced them to admit that they had underestimated the signature sword of the Spirit Stream Sect!\n “It seems the legends of the tenfold spirit enhancement were true,” the Blood Stream Sect arch-patriarch said. “A tenfold spirit enhancement will produce shocking transformations.... In fact, it’s just short of being a true spirit treasure!”\n After joining forces with the Spirit Stream Sect, it was becoming increasingly clear to the Blood Stream Sect that they were adept at concealing their true strength. Although they still didn\u0027t quite match up to the Blood Stream Sect, if war had truly broken out, even if the Blood Stream Sect won in the end, they would have been forced to pay a severe price. In fact, they would most likely have lost any qualification to enter the Middle Reaches.\n Furthermore, before they would even have had a chance to do that, the Profound Stream Sect would have come for them, and the current situation would likely have been reversed.\n Everyone had been watching the clash between the Heavenhorn Sword and the black-armored star beetle. That was especially true of the people on the city walls. Actually, there was a stirring of spiritual energy originating from those walls that was locked down on the area around the black-armored star beetle....\n As the Heavenhorn Sword rose back up into the air, the two halves of the black-armored star beetle toppled down to either side, and the battlefield went completely silent. But then, all of the Spirit Stream Sect cultivators broke out into thunderous cheering.\n In sharp contrast, the Profound Stream Sect cultivators were forced to watch their sect’s precious treasure, the black-armored star beetle, be cut in half. As its black blood oozed out in all directions, the shaken Profound Stream Sect cultivators slowly bowed their heads. Many of them looked more thoughtful than ever.\n It was then that people started to realize that within the corpse of the black-armored star beetle, there was a very strange-looking crystal. Soon, more and more people were staring at it.\n However, even more attracted to the crystal were the numerous battle beasts, who were staring at it wide-eyed.\n “A beast king crystal!” the Blood Stream Sect’s arch-patriarch said. But then his eyes flickered, and his face fell. “Wait, no, it\u0027s a fake!”\n However, even as the words left his mouth, a tiny figure leapt out in front of everyone. It was Bruiser, who had shrunk down to the size of a hand, and was flying toward the corpse of the black-armored star beetle with shocking speed.\n His eyes shone with longing, almost madness, and he was moving so quickly that he was nothing more than a colorful blur. Bai Xiaochun’s jaw dropped, and suddenly, he was stricken with the realization that something about the situation seemed off. Before he could react though...\n A droning sound filled the air, and it was coming from the city walls of the Profound Stream Sect. The sound instantly grew in volume until it was earsplitting, and caused all hearts to tremble.\n Next, a black arrow became visible. In the blink of an eye, it shot forth from the city, flying at unbelievable speed toward the direction of the black-armored star beetle!\n Its target was none other than Bruiser!!\n A tremor ran through Bruiser, a sudden, intense sensation of deadly crisis. He let out a howl as he tried to flee, or perhaps fight back. And yet all such efforts were useless; the arrow was only half a moment away from stabbing into his forehead!\n Bai Xiaochun instantly devolved into madness. Shouting out in a hoarse voice, he flew out into the air and opened his Heavenspan Dharma Eye. All the control power of his third eye erupted, almost like an invisible hand which wrapped around the arrow in an attempt to halt its momentum.\n Bai Xiaochun shot toward the beetle corpse with all the power he could muster, blood oozing out of his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. As a result of all of his efforts, the arrow suddenly lurched to a halt!\n In that moment, Bruiser shivered, and then leapt to the side. Just as Bai Xiaochun was breathing a sigh of relief, the arrow swiveled in place. Instead of aiming at Bruiser, or even at Bai Xiaochun, it was now pointing directly toward the black crystal!\n It moved with speed just as incredible as before, and the sudden acceleration instantly shattered Bai Xiaochun’s control power....\n All of this takes quite some time to describe, but happened with exceeding quickness. Few people on the battlefield were capable of even reacting. However, one of them was the Blood Stream Sect’s arch-patriarch, whose scalp was tingling so hard it felt like it might explode.\n “Nightcrypt, get back!” he shouted. “The target is you!!”\n The other patriarchs’ faces fell as they realized what was happening, and although they wanted to do something to save Bai Xiaochun, there was no time.\n Although the previous situations he had encountered on the battlefield seemed dangerous, the truth was that the patriarchs had always been close by, and could have intervened if the situation got out of hand.\n But now, things were developing too quickly, and the Profound Stream Sect had seized an opportunity with vicious determination. Bai Xiaochun had flown out of his own accord because of the danger Bruiser had been in. Because of that, the ability of the patriarchs of the Spirit and Blood Stream Sects to protect him had suddenly faltered!\n Although few other people might have noticed the opportunity which had developed, how could Patriarch Crimsonsoul of the Profound Stream Sect not notice? This was a situation that he had personally manipulated!\n Bai Xiaochun’s pupils constricted, but he didn\u0027t have any time to ponder his next action. A sensation of mortal crisis filled him, and he was left with few ways to defend himself. Shouting, he grabbed Bruiser, and then a black light shone out as the turtle-wok appeared. Simultaneously, Bai Xiaochun curled up into the smallest ball possible inside of the wok.\n Just as he did that, the arrow struck the black crystal that was inside the corpse of the beetle. Instantly, a huge boom shook the area, and a black shockwave spread out for 90 meters in every direction. Everywhere the shockwave passed, it obliterated any living thing it touched, even the grass. Everything was wiped away; the cultivators it hit didn’t even have a chance to scream.\n The corpse of the black-armored star beetle was completely eradicated, and a huge crater was hewn out of the ground!\n Soon the boundless black light faded away, revealing the only thing to have been left behind: a black wok on the edge of the crater, sitting there motionless.\n As everyone peered over to look, the wok trembled, and then slowly lifted up to reveal Bai Xiaochun’s face. He appeared to be so terrified that he was shaking. The sensation of having just escaped with his life left tears running down his cheeks.\n “Profound Stream Sect,” he shrieked, “things aren’t finished between us. Y-y-you... you people actually tried to ambush me again!?!?” Fear still throbbed in his heart. Despite having been saved by the turtle-wok, he was still convinced that he was about to die.\n However, when used by Bai Xiaochun, the spirit enhancement wok was extremely powerful. Without it, his poor little life would have been lost. His heart was pounding, and the residual fear that flowed through him caused his knees to wobble.\n Crawling out from underneath the wok, and cradling Bruiser in his arms, he said, “Bruiser, you almost got your dad killed, did you know that!?!?”\n Bruiser looked like he was about to cry; he knew that he had slipped up.\n Seeing Bruiser’s reaction, Bai Xiaochun couldn’t bear to criticize him any further. Then, flames of rage began to rise up in his eyes as he looked over at the city walls, and the old man standing atop them with a huge bow in his hands.\n “You just wait for Lord Bai, you old fart!” he shouted at the top of his lungs. “I... I want that bow of yours!!”\n “I can’t believe he’s not dead!!” Patriarch Crimsonsoul said, lowering the enormous green bow. The bow itself emanated a profoundly ancient Heaven-Dao aura. It was none other than the Profound Stream Sect’s second precious treasure, the Heaven Bow!\n The arrow from moments ago had been loosed by that very bow!\n The Profound Stream Sect had long since come to realize that it would be impossible for any of them to directly kill Bai Xiaochun, not even the Gold Core cultivators. One of the enemy patriarchs would definitely step in to save him. The Spirit and Blood Stream Sects were simply too protective of Bai Xiaochun.\n The entire time, Patriarch Crimsonsoul had never been able to find a chance to kill Bai Xiaochun, and had eventually come up with the plan from moments ago, to sacrifice the black-armored star beetle, and then use a crystal infused with the aura of a beast king to attract Bruiser. If Bai Xiaochun didn\u0027t make a move to save Bruiser, then the plan would have been for naught. However, as long as Bai Xiaochun appeared... then he could detonate the black crystal and destroy everything in the area, including Bai Xiaochun!\n If Bai Xiaochun died, it would be a fatal blow to the Spirit and Blood Stream Sects, and would have made a split between the two even more likely. Even if the Profound Stream Sect eventually surrendered, they would have a chance to rise up again in the future!\n However, after everything was said and done, Bai Xiaochun didn\u0027t end up dead. A very unsightly expression could be seen on Patriarch Crimsonsoul’s face, and his heart was filled with bitter sullenness.\n When the Spirit and Blood Stream Sect patriarchs realized that Bai Xiaochun had survived, they breathed sighs of relief. Li Qinghou was shaking; moments ago, he had been struck mute with fear. It was the same with all of Bai Xiaochun’s other friends on the battlefield.\n As the fury of the two sects burned hotter than ever, they attacked. The Heavenhorn Sword slashed into the spell formation, and the other precious treasures of the Spirit and Blood Stream Sects were unleashed.\n A huge blood-colored tree appeared, as well as a blood mirror. Numerous powerful objects sent heaven-rending, earth-crushing power toward the Profound Stream Sect!\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-307","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
