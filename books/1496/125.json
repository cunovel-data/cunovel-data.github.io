In all my years, I’ve never seen a guy as shameless as that. I can’t deal with this. Can\u0027t deal with it, I tell you! I’m gonna go strangle him to death!”\n “Get out of my way! This villain Bai Xiaochun’s shameless is incomprehensible!!”\n Everyone was going mad and shouting at the tops of their lungs. Eyes were shot with blood. Liu Dabiao reappeared after having conceded, his legs wobbling and tears streaming down his face. Everyone present felt sorry for him.\n “This is too much! Instead of accepting the challenge of an Inner Sect disciple, he fights an Outer Sect disciple? If he wants to pick someone weak to fight, fine, but did he have to pick someone that weak?!?!”\n “Hey, fight me, Chen Ao! I challenged you on the first day. Come on, I dare ya!!” The Inner Sect disciples were going mad, unleashing anger upon Bai Xiaochun that could shake heaven and earth.\n The Gongsun siblings and Xu Song were speeding toward the trial platform from off in the distance. After learning what had happened, they were shaken, but also enraged.\n That was especially true of Beihan Lie, who threw his head back and roared.\n “Bai Xiaochun, I challenge you to fight!!”\n His words caused everything to shake as if with thunder, and filled all four peaks of the north bank. Countless disciples of both the Outer and Inner sects were shocked. Eyes wide, they began to race toward the trial platform.\n So many people were calling out that they wanted to fight that several hundred paper cranes formed and shot toward Bai Xiaochun, almost inundating him.\n This was a scene which had never, ever played out before on the north bank. The disciples were going crazy, and even the four peak lords were left gasping. A huge group of elders appeared, hovering up in the air and looking down at the scene playing out.\n However, no matter which way they analyzed the situation, they couldn’t think of any way in which Bai Xiaochun had violated any sect rules. The old woman from Irispetal Peak looked down at him with wide eyes, aware that everything he had done was in compliance with all regulations....\n Seeing all the paper cranes, and seeing how angry everyone was, Bai Xiaochun started getting mad. He hadn’t done anything to deserve this, and was convinced that he was in the right. He hadn’t violated a single sect rule. He hadn’t challenged a single person; they kept challenging him!\n All he had done was accept the challenge....\n Hearing how everyone was shouting out challenges at him, his eyes widened into a glare, and he roared, “You bunch of bullies! Fine. Fine! You forced me into this!”\n Sweeping his furious gaze across the crowd, he waved his hand, and a sound like rushing water could be heard as more than 5,000 paper cranes emerged from his bag of holding. Those were all of the paper cranes he had collected recently, a thousand of which had just come in that morning....\n The crowd instantly went quiet. The Inner Sect disciples were all cracking their knuckles, ready to fight at any moment. As for the Outer Sect disciples, they were burning with rage. However, some of them, the impulsive thousand or so who had joined Liu Dabiao to issue challenges, were also a bit nervous.\n Bai Xiaochun, heart pulsing with fury, looked over at the paper cranes and then selected one from an Outer Sect disciple in the fifth level of Qi Condensation.\n “You!” he said loftily. “I accept your challenge!”\n As his voice echoed out, one of the Outer Sect disciples in the crowd, a teenager, vanished as he was teleported onto the trial platform. Trembling, tears welling up in his eyes and leaking out the corners, he edged backward.\n “I... I concede!!”\n The audience gaped, and some people’s vision started to turn black as they realized they had underestimated the true depth of Bai Xiaochun’s shamelessness....\n “ARRGHHHH! I\u0027m gonna kill him! Bai Xiaochun, you’re not gonna escape this time! Not unless you fight everybody here! Until that happens, this matter will never be over!”\n “This level of shamelessness... I... I don’t even know what to say!”\n “Heavens! I hope some immortal lightning falls from the sky and strikes him dead!”\n That only got Bai Xiaochun more angry. Looking around at the maddened crowd, he said, “I, Bai Xiaochun, came here from the south bank, alone and impoverished. I\u0027ve kept my tail between my legs up to now because I didn\u0027t want to offend anyone. But since you’ve forced me, then fine, I’m gonna go all out!”\n Eyes bright red, he clenched his jaw and pulled out a paper crane from a disciple in the fifth level of Qi Condensation.\n A moment later, the Outer Sect disciple appeared in front of Bai Xiaochun, so terrified he was on the verge of collapsing. He immediately shouted that he conceded. Bai Xiaochun let out a cold harrumph and then produced another paper crane.\n To the increasing rage of the crowd, Bai Xiaochun produced one challenge crane after another belonging to Outer Sect disciples. Each and every one was so terrified their legs felt like jelly. However, challenges could not be canceled by the challenger, so they had no choice but to tearfully concede and watch as their merit points were transferred to Bai Xiaochun.\n After conceding, they would return to the crowd, their fury even stronger than before, and yet also feeling pained because of the loss of merit points.\n Of course, Bai Xiaochun’s merit points were increasing rapidly, to the point where even he was shocked. That day was a huge catastrophe for all of the impulsive Outer Sect disciples....\n To them, Bai Xiaochun had become a pernicious devil who consumed merit points with extreme prejudice. As for Bai Xiaochun, he ruthlessly swept through the entire group of Outer Sect disciples, the process of which took three days.\n He didn’t fight a single time, although taking out all the paper cranes left his arm a bit sore.\n The north bank disciples were apoplectic, their voices hoarse and sore from all the shouting. And yet, they didn’t calm down in the least bit. Eventually, the Hall of Justice had to intervene to keep things under control. But even they could only watch Bai Xiaochun at work, remaining vigilant against a possible uprising on the part of the north bank disciples.\n The four peak lords looked on in absolute astonishment. Glancing at each other, they could see the helplessness and shock in each other’s eyes.\n “No wonder the south bank sent Bai Xiaochun over here!”\n “This guy could run the sect into the ground!!”\n “And yet, he hasn’t broken any sect rules....”\n Three days later, Bai Xiaochun stretched his right arm to loosen it up, then let out a cold harrumph. Having cleared all of the Outer Sect disciples’ fight challenges, he looked around at the tens of thousand of people surrounding him, and could tell that they wouldn\u0027t let him leave.\n After a moment of silence, he chuckled. “Well, since you’re going to be like that, don\u0027t blame me for what happens next.”\n It was at that moment that his normal cautiousness faded, and the same veins of steel appeared that had been present in the fight with the Luochen Clan!\n Even as the crowd looked on with bloodshot eyes, he selected a fight challenge from an Inner Sect disciple.\n All eyes were completely focused on the trial platform as a figure materialized. It was a gaunt young man who, the moment he appeared, threw his head back and laughed uproariously.\n “Bai Xiaochun, today I will--”\n BOOM!\n Before he could even finish speaking, Bai Xiaochun was right in front of him, unleashing a fist strike. The gaunt young man’s eyes went wide as he sailed through the air and then slammed into the shield surrounding the trial platform, where he slumped down, unconscious.\n The audience gasped, and their eyes went wide. Bai Xiaochun stood there with a placid expression on his face as he pulled out a second paper crane from an Inner Sect disciple. Moments later, the second Inner Sect disciple appeared on the platform. In the blink of an eye, a fist flashed, and he was unconscious. Then, Bai Xiaochun pulled out a third challenge....\n It took one day for him to accept the challenge cranes from a hundred Inner Sect disciples. All of them were in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and yet none of them could stand up to a single punch from Bai Xiaochun.\n When evening fell, Bai Xiaochun chose to rest. He sat down cross-legged on the trial platform, surrounded by a furious crowd bent on preventing him from leaving if he tried.\n The next day at dawn, Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes. Expression the same as ever, he selected a paper crane, and then once again set to work. Yet again, a hundred people couldn’t stand up to a single punch!\n Day three. Day four. Day five....\n Twenty days passed in which Bai Xiaochun accepted two thousand challenges from Inner Sect disciples. All of them were in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and not a single one could stand up to his fist strike.\n None of them even came close to qualifying.\n Although it was certainly an impressive scene, the north bank disciples weren’t silenced yet, nor was their rage lessened.\n It was on the twentieth day that Bai Xiaochun calmly produced a challenge letter belonging to someone in the ninth level of Qi Condensation. Soon, people were shocked to find out that Bai Xiaochun was so strong... that the disciples in the ninth level of Qi Condensation could only withstand two fist strikes before being knocked unconscious.\n Some of them even coughed up mouthfuls of blood.\n The north bank disciples were staggered, and many of them finally lapsed into silence. Even the four great Chosen, the Gongsun siblings, Xu Song, and finally Beihan Lie, couldn’t endure more than ten successive fist strikes.\n Beihan Lie was utterly shocked to find that his Sunset Incantation couldn’t stand up to Bai Xiaochun at all!\n The Gongsun siblings were astonished. They had been under the belief that they had experienced rapid advancement since the Chosen battles, but now they realized that Bai Xiaochun had advanced far, far more quickly than they had!\n Xu Song faced Bai Xiaochun bitterly, and to him, it felt like standing in front of Ghostfang. The terror he felt was something he had never felt before in his life.\n Ten fist strikes ended everything. Bai Xiaochun’s fleshly body was already in a position to make contact with the first shackle. After he reached the Undying Gold Skin level, he would be at the peak of the Dragon Mammoth Sea-Forming scripture, and would be on the verge of ascending to a higher level.\n Such strength made him truly invincible to anyone under Foundation Establishment.\n After seeing the four great Chosen fall, the other north bank disciples sat there silently, looking at Bai Xiaochun with complicated expressions. Although rage still burned in their hearts, at long last... they had to admit to his superiority!\n In the cultivation world, respect was given to the strong and powerful. Bai Xiaochun had struck terror into the depths of their hearts, and as of this moment, had truly defeated the north bank disciples.\n He was still their archenemy, but now, people wanted to work as hard as possible to surpass that archenemy!\n It was hard to say who moved first, but soon, the crowd had parted to open a pathway leading toward the Beast Conservatory.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-123","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
