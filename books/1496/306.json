{"id":45623,"no":306,"title":"Chapter 304: Powerful Fleshly Body!","content":"As Lin Mu sent the violet puppet’s left hand waving through the air, the moon shot out like tribulation, radiating frigid coldness. Snowflakes even began to flutter in the air as it sped toward Bai Xiaochun.\n The violet puppet had unleashed a sun with its right hand and a moon with its left. Now it hovered there in the air like a god, radiating intense energy. Although the sun had been bound up by Bai Xiaochun’s Magic Plant Arsenal, the moon bearing down on the other side radiated a killing aura that caused everyone who felt it to tremble.\n “Time to die, Bai Xiaochun!!” Lin Mu shouted hoarsely.\n Bai Xiaochun’s eyes widened at the extraordinary display of power. Although he could sense the danger he was in, it also drove him to a state of maddened rage.\n “You’ll be the one to die!” he roared. His right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, causing the Undying Live Forever Technique to erupt with power. Blood qi surged out of him, and in the blink of an eye, it became a huge blood-colored greatsword, which he grasped and then swung toward the incoming moon.\n By calling upon the Violet Qi Heavenspan Incantation, he was able to summon a drop of Heavenspan River water from within his spiritual seas, which he fused into some blood qi, causing a fist-sized blood sphere to shoot out and join the blood sword.\n The blood sphere caused the cultivators who saw it to feel completely shaken. Sensations of profound danger even rose up in their hearts.\n “Is that…?”\n “The aura of Heavenspan River water?!”\n Even as astonished cries rang out, Bai Xiaochun’s blood-colored greatsword caused rumbling sounds to echo out as it slammed into Lin Mu’s moon.\n Everything began to shake violently, and a huge wind blasted out in all directions. At the same time, the blood sphere continued on toward Lin Mu.\n The dazzling light shining from the sphere could be seen by people far away on the battlefield. Even the prime elders and legacy echelon cultivators were watching with wide eyes!\n Even though they were currently in the Core Formation stage, back when they had been in Foundation Establishment, they couldn’t have competed with Bai Xiaochun or Lin Mu. The fight going on was completely and utterly shocking. Although Bai Xiaochun and Lin Mu were relying on a spell formation and a puppet respectively, what they were doing proved that they were far beyond ordinary. They were clearly at the ultimate peak of Foundation Establishment.\n A huge shockwave spread out. Bai Xiaochun’s Heavenly Demon Body twisted and distorted, and he fell back by several paces. Lin Mu’s violet puppet emitted cracking sounds, and fissures could be seen on its surface as it, too, fell back.\n Both of them were breathing heavily. As for Lin Mu, he also felt as if he were facing a powerful adversary. Eyes shining brightly, he threw his head back and laughed maniacally.\n “So, it turns out you’re even stronger than Nine-Isles. What a pity, though, Bai Xiaochun. You’re going to die here anyway!” The violet puppet leaped high into the air, raising its arms high as if to touch the heavens.\n Then, a strange light appeared in its eyes as its right and left hands touched right in front of its forehead. At the same time, the puppet’s voice thundered, “Sun and moon shine together!”\n Almost immediately, both the sun and the moon reappeared within the violet puppet’s hands. They superimposed, and it was like fire and water mixing. An intense tearing force shone out, becoming bright beams of light that caused everything to rumble and shake!\n In the blink of an eye, everything within 300 meters was enveloped with light. First, it was freezing, then burning hot, and then those forces combined, creating a bizarre power capable of melting anything and everything!\n All cultivators within that area, even the cultivators from the Profound Stream Sect, began to scream in bloodcurdling fashion as they were wiped out of existence.\n Bai Xiaochun’s Heavenly Demon Body was already showing signs of instability. Within the bright, shining light, it was like a snowball facing a raging fire, and instantly began to melt. Based on Bai Xiaochun’s calculations, it would only take a few breaths of time for both the Heavenly Demon Body and the spell formation giant to be transformed into ash.\n In that critical moment, Bai Xiaochun’s eyes became completely bloodshot. The fact that dozens of fellow disciples had just been killed made him feel like his heart was being torn apart. Without any hesitation, he slapped his bag of holding, producing more than a hundred glowing spheres!\n Those glowing spheres had been created by drawing upon the cyclical powers of gravity and repulsion, and then infused with vast amounts of toxic gas!\n Bai Xiaochun immediately flung the spheres as hard as he could in the direction of the violet puppet.\n They became beams of light that shot toward Lin Mu at incredible speed, completely impervious to the effects of the bright light shining down in the area. None of them even showed a single sign of melting as they shot toward the puppet.\n Then booms began to ring out as the glowing spheres exploded, sending large amounts of gas into the interior of the violet puppet!\n All of this takes quite some time to describe, but happened extremely quickly. Bai Xiaochun let out a howl as the light from the sun and the moon caused the Heavenly Demon Body to melt completely, revealing the half-destroyed spell formation giant beneath it.\n Just when the giant was about to vanish, Bai Xiaochun called upon the last bits of power remaining and yelled, “Break formation!”\n Instantly, the spell formation incarnation shattered, ejecting the Spirit Stream Sect disciples out in all directions. Bai Xiaochun himself leapt high up into the air, his Undying Live Forever Technique erupting with power. He had golden skin, and fleshly body defenses provided by the Heavenly Demon Body. Drawing upon his shocking speed, he quickly escaped from the destructive perimeter of light!\n Meanwhile, the violet puppet was beginning to tremble, and screams were starting to echo out from inside, as well as cackling laughter. After shaking for a moment, the puppet exploded, and an entire group of maddened Profound Stream Sect disciples poured out. Among them was Lin Mu, his face pale as he shouted, “Bai Xiaochun!!”\n Lin Mu’s hair was completely disheveled as he hovered there in midair. Moments ago, he had been completely convinced that his techniques would either kill Bai Xiaochun or destroy his spell formation, leaving him completely vulnerable to the power of the violet puppet.\n Never could he have imagined that everything would backfire. Just when the spell formation had been on the verge of melting completely, his own violet puppet was suddenly infected by a damnable toxic gas, and rendered completely useless!\n Now, the two evenly matched opponents were bereft of any spell formations or puppets. When their eyes met across the battlefield, Bai Xiaochun could see the killing intent in Lin Mu’s eyes, and Lin Mu could see the madness flickering in Bai Xiaochun\u0027s.\n Inside, Lin Mu was trembling. He knew that Bai Xiaochun’s fleshly body power was beyond ordinary, and that his own superiority came in the form of magical techniques. Just as he was considering fleeing, Bai Xiaochun shot forward, a murderous aura raging around him as he unleashed the Mountain Shaking Bash. He began as nothing more than a blur of afterimages, causing rumbling sounds to echo out as he closed in on Lin Mu, his hand clenched into a fist!\n “The time for magical techniques is over. Let’s see whose fleshly body is stronger!”\n Lin Mu wanted to evade, but quickly realized that he was slower than Bai Xiaochun. He couldn’t match up at all with someone who had cultivated the Undying Live Forever Technique; Bai Xiaochun was like a wild animal pouncing on prey. Lin Mu quickly bit his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood.\n The blood formed a blood-colored buckler, which shot out to meet Bai Xiaochun’s fist strike.\n Although the blood buckler wasn\u0027t destroyed by the punch, it was sent spinning backward, where it slammed into Lin Mu’s chest, causing him to cough up a mouthful of blood. Shocked, he began to back up.\n “Think you can just run away?” Bai Xiaochun said, chasing after him. Lifting his right leg up, he kicked Lin Mu hard in the shoulder. Lin Mu gritted his teeth as he was shoved backward, blood soaking through his clothes.\n He felt humiliated, and yet, there was nothing he could do. In terms of cultivation base, he didn’t fear Bai Xiaochun, nor was there any disparity between them when it came to magical techniques. But as for fleshly body power, he simply had no way of competing with Bai Xiaochun.\n He had no violet puppet, and wasn\u0027t strong enough to fight back physically. “Dammit! Cultivators like us practice divine abilities! We search for great Daos, and work hard to live forever! Y-y-you’re... y-y-you’re just cultivating your physical body!!”\n “The only way to live forever is to not die!” Bai Xiaochun replied confidently. “So of course I cultivate an undying body!” Lin Mu was unable to offer a response. Another blow hit him, and he coughed up more blood as he was knocked across the battlefield.\n Killing intent swirled in Bai Xiaochun’s eyes as he bore down again on Lin Mu, within whose eyes flickered an unyielding gleam, and even madness. Lin Mu waved his arms, causing a pill furnace to fly out from his sleeve and shoot toward Bai Xiaochun.\n Bai Xiaochun snorted coldly and didn’t even pause for a moment. In fact, he slammed directly into the pill furnace. It was a powerful magical treasure, and yet, could do nothing to Bai Xiaochun. It was instantly sent flying off to the side as he arced through the air toward Lin Mu, looking like a blade of death!\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-304","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
