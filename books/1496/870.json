{"id":46187,"no":870,"title":"Chapter 868: To Battle!","content":"Bai Xiaochun knew that he couldn’t chase Patriarch Dao River any further at the moment. Snorting coldly, he sent the nine projections of himself down to the battlefield below.\\n\\n Wherever they went, they cut down their enemies with impunity. The Nascent Soul cultivators were especially targeted, and it only took a short time for roughly ten to be slaughtered.\\n\\n That was the limit of Bai Xiaochun’s frigid domain when in the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage. He could create multiple powerful projections, but they could only last for so long.\\n\\n And yet, it had only taken a few short breaths of time for him to cut down more than a dozen Nascent Soul experts on the battlefield below, and also destroy Patriarch Dao River’s fleshly body, leaving him fleeing in nascent divinity form.\\n\\n Everyone felt as shaken as if they had been struck by numerous bolts of lightning.\\n\\n “This is impossible!!”\\n\\n “Patriarch, this… how… how could this be happening?!?!”\\n\\n “What’s the level of his cultivation base? It only took a few breaths of time for him to cut down multiple Nascent Soul experts, and even defeat a deva!!” The cultivators from the three sects were completely astonished, and were trembling in disbelieving fear. To see Bai Xiaochun handily defeat the deva patriarch from the Dao River Court, who then ran away like a stray dog, left them on the verge of collapsing mentally.\\n\\n That was especially true of the cultivators from the Dao River Court, who were the most terrified of all.\\n\\n In the past, Bai Xiaochun had marked all of the chosen from these three sects with turtle marks. Now, he had them shaking in terror, hardly able to believe what they were seeing…. The fact that their patriarch had almost been killed, and fled in bedraggled fashion, proved that… Bai Xiaochun was now unimaginably powerful!\\n\\n The morale of the three sects’ cultivators was dropping rapidly. In contrast, the cultivators of the River-Defying Sect began to cheer at the tops of their lungs.\\n\\n They simply couldn’t control their excitement. The River-Defying Sect had been under great pressure for too long. For years, they had been bullied by the other three sects, even when disciples went out for training. The friction had become so bad that some disciples had been killed in the resulting conflicts.\\n\\n Unfortunately, the River-Defying Sect just wasn’t strong enough. For the sake of the bigger picture, in the hopes of preventing things from escalating too quickly, and especially to avoid giving the three sects an excuse to attack, they had simply endured.\\n\\n But despite how they had endured, the three sects had managed to get tacit approval from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect to exterminate the River-Defying Sect. And therefore, the hatred the River-Defying Sect disciples felt toward the three sects had reached an unimaginable degree. They simply couldn’t exist under the same sky together.\\n\\n Now, a mighty deva patriarch had been beaten and sent running. It was so exciting that the River-Defying Sect disciples couldn’t contain themselves. Most important was Bai Xiaochun. He was the spirit and heart of the River-Defying Sect; he had even come up with the name of the sect! He was their pride and joy, someone who truly deserved to be referred to as a consummate chosen!\\n\\n “Sect Grandfather Bai!”\\n\\n “Sect Grandfather Bai!!”\\n\\n “Sect Grandfather Bai!!!”\\n\\n It was hard to say who called it out first, but soon everyone in the River-Defying Sect was shouting the same thing, creating sound waves that rolled out in all directions.\\n\\n Song Junwan was completely swept up in the excitement. To see Bai Xiaochun standing right here in front of her was like a dream that caused tears of joy to well up in her eyes.\\n\\n Shangguan Tianyou said nothing. He looked exhausted, and had mixed emotions in his eyes. However, many years had passed, and he had changed. He was no longer the type to be easily excited.\\n\\n Beihan Lie’s hands were clenched into fists as he glared hatefully at the disciples of the three sects. A corpse lay nearby, the corpse of a black dog…. Shortly before Bai Xiaochun had arrived, that black dog had fought to the death to protect him.\\n\\n Within the sect headquarters, Patriarch Blood Stream was inside the Blood Ancestor, trembling with excitement. Even he had been despairing moments ago, but now, he suddenly found himself thinking about what Bai Xiaochun had looked like as Nightcrypt all those years ago on Middle Peak.\\n\\n The rabbit stood on the Blood Ancestor’s head, looking at Bai Xiaochun, muttering in a voice too low for anyone to hear.\\n\\n Patriarch Spirit Stream, Zheng Yuandong, and the monkey were all looking at the hope of the sect!\\n\\n “This is the miracle I was talking about!” the monkey murmured, his eyes shining with brilliant light.\\n\\n As the River-Defying Sect brimmed with excitement, Bai Xiaochun looked over at the destroyed fleshly body of Patriarch Dao River, and at his fleeing nascent divinity. Then he turned to look at Patriarchs Starry River and Polarity River, who were so shaken by the defeat of the other deva that they didn’t dare to continue their advance.\\n\\n Because they were devas, and understood the Deva Realm well, they were more flustered than anyone else.\\n\\n They knew that although Patriarch Dao River had only been in the early Deva Realm, the techniques he used made him the strongest of all of them. And yet, he had been defeated within a few breaths of time by Bai Xiaochun.\\n\\n They could tell that, were it not for the fact that the chaos of the battlefield prevented Bai Xiaochun from giving chase, Patriarch Dao River would have a hard time escaping with his life!\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun could kill devas! It was a realization that shook the two remaining patriarchs to the core. Because devas could supplant heavenly will, the spiritual power they had access to, as well as their magical techniques and divine abilities, all contained the might of creation. They were like gods to all lower cultivators, and were beings that were virtually impossible to kill.\\n\\n Only someone who was also in the early Deva Realm would have a chance at beating someone like that. Furthermore, it would be difficult to end the fight with a kill. Therefore, what they had just seen play out in front of them seemed almost impossible. As Bai Xiaochun looked over at them, they both unleashed the power of their cultivation bases.\\n\\n “Why don\u0027t we stop fighting for today, Bai Xiaochun…?” Patriarch Starry River said.\\n\\n “We only made a move because the River-Defying Sect had no deva,” Patriarch Polarity River added in. “But seeing that you do, well, I guess this was all a big misunderstanding….”\\n\\n Neither of them wanted to keep on fighting. The truth was that they weren’t confident in being able to handle the terrifying Bai Xiaochun. Therefore, they both tried to play on his concern for the River-Defying Sect to end things.\\n\\n “Don’t just think about yourself, Bai Xiaochun. You have to consider the other disciples of the River-Defying Sect. They’ve been fighting for a long time as it is. There really isn’t a need for any more fighting and killing….”\\n\\n “That’s right. Our three sects still have the advantage. If we keep going, it won’t benefit the River-Defying Sect. Besides, your people are all exhausted. If they keep going now, there will surely be more injuries and deaths. You have to think of your fellow disciples!”\\n\\n As Bai Xiaochun hovered there looking at them coldly, Patriarch Spirit Stream looked up from within the sect headquarters and shouted, “If we don’t crush the enemy, how could things be over!? Can the blood of the River-Defying Sect be spilt so casually? This place… is not one they can blithely intrude upon, and then just waltz away!”\\n\\n The eyes of the other disciples turned crimson, and they began to shout in rage.\\n\\n “Patriarch, do something! We’re all willing to keep fighting!”\\n\\n “They invaded our River-Defying Sect, now they have to pay the price. In blood!!”\\n\\n As the shouting grew more intense, the army from the three sects began to tremble. At the moment, they had no desire to fight at all, and in fact, began to edge away.\\n\\n When Bai Xiaochun saw what was happening, his killing intent began to burn with even more intensity. Then, rumbling sounds echoed out as he shot toward the two remaining devas. Although he wasn’t a fan of killing, he knew that it was just as Patriarch Spirit Stream had said. These people had attacked the River-Defying Sect, and they had to pay the price!\\n\\n Taking the fleshly body away from one measly deva was not enough!\\n\\n Patriarchs Starry River and Polarity River felt their hearts pounding in their chests. Their faces fell as they realized… that they could not avoid this fight!\\n\\n Considering that, they took solace in the fact that, although they might not be able to defeat Bai Xiaochun if they fought him one-on-one, they could still join forces. Eyes flashing with determination, they unleashed their most powerful divine abilities!\\n\\n Heaven and earth shook violently as countless heavenly bodies materialized around Patriarch Starry River.\\n\\n As for Patriarch Polarity River, he knew he was facing a formidable opponent. A devilish will erupted around him as he summoned a massive devil projection with 1,000 arms!\\n\\n Then, both of them charged toward Bai Xiaochun in attack!\\n\\n A grand battle of devas was about to begin!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-868","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \\n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
