{"id":46289,"no":972,"title":"Chapter 970: Xiaochun Overturns The Heavens!","content":"Four devas were joining hands to attack Bai Xiaochun with deadly force. The cultivators from the Cloud Order and the Lightning Order were all watching with rapt attention. Based on what everyone could tell, it didn’t matter if Bai Xiaochun were even stronger than he had already proven to be, he would still die for his brazenness! “This Bai Xiaochun is strong, but he\u0027s forgotten that he isn\u0027t in the east anymore. This is the north!” “Hmph! How dare he throw his weight around here in the north. We’re definitely going to show him a thing or two!” “I refuse to believe that Master Cloud Lightning and the other devas all working together can’t kill that one measly Bai Xiaochun!” Everyone was now starting to calm down, and were showing nothing but open disdain toward Bai Xiaochun. Meanwhile, Master Cloud Lightning and the other devas were closing in rapidly. Cold light flickered in Bai Xiaochun’s eyes. He had been restraining himself ever since he arrived in the north, but now that he had four devas all showing open killing intent, his anger erupted in full. Instead of backing up, he advanced, waving his hand to summon the Waterswamp Kingdom. Water vapor roiled in all directions as a huge clawed hand shot out. Everything shook violently, catching all of the devas completely by surprise. Master Cloud Lightning wasn\u0027t affected very deeply, but the three other devas gasped, and one of them even coughed up blood. “Bai Xiaochun!” Master Cloud Lightning, the top deva in the north, roared in rage at this. Transforming into a beam of bright light, he shot directly toward Bai Xiaochun, simultaneously shouting, “Cloud Lightning Forefather: Seventh Transformation!!” An ear-splitting rumbling sound spread out as Master Cloud Lightning rapidly grew to a height of 210 meters. He truly looked like the forefather of all humanity, with a cultivation base and battle prowess that skyrocketed seemingly without limit. In an instant, he was past the late Deva Realm, and was like a tempest bearing down on Bai Xiaochun. However, that was when Bai Xiaochun’s eyes flashed, and he shouted, “Super Suppression Forefather, Fifth Transformation!” BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! Bai Xiaochun also grew rapidly in size, until he was 150 meters tall, with a wild and barbaric aura, and a burly, savage appearance. Within his left eye was a moon sigil that shone with dazzling light, which made his fifth transformation… as powerful as the eighth! “This is impossible!!” Master Cloud Lightning’s eyes bulged on the verge of popping out of his skull. The reason he hadn’t resorted to his eighth transformation was that it was too draining. Furthermore, how could he possibly have ever guessed that Bai Xiaochun would actually use the exact same divine ability as him!? They slammed into each other, and a massive boom echoed out in all directions. The air vibrated as Master Cloud Lightning tumbled backward, blood spraying out of his mouth. Although he was shaken physically, he was even more shaken mentally, and was panting in disbelief. The Cloud Lightning Forefather technique was a secret magic that belonged to the north. And yet, in completely unexpected fashion, Bai Xiaochun had used it right in front of him, a fact that instantly shoved him further toward madness. Even worse was the fact that he had only used the fifth transformation, and yet had completely overpowered his own seventh transformation. It was utterly maddening. “Bai Xiaochun,” he roared, “how dare you steal a secret legacy technique of the north!!” Without any hesitation, he utilized his eighth transformation, reaching a height of 240 meters, whereupon he charged back into the fray. “That’s bullshit and you know it!” Bai Xiaochun shot back. “You’re using the Cloud Lightning Forefather technique, and I\u0027m using the Super Suppression Forefather technique! The names are totally different! What are you, blind? Or deaf? Or both?!” Snorting coldly, he launched forward, slamming into Master Cloud Lightning. As they separated from the exchange, Bai Xiaochun’s qi and blood was boiling. Eyes shining with the desire to do battle, he lurched backward, performed a double-handed incantation gesture, and then shouted out at the top of his lungs “Living Mountain Incantation!” RUUUUUUUUMBLE! Countless rocks and boulders began to fly through the air, covering Bai Xiaochun’s 150-meter frame and causing him to grow larger and taller. Within moments, he was a 300-meter-tall stone golem. The combination of the Forefather Transformation with the Living Mountain Incantation produced shocking results, and shook everything in the area due to the sheer stunning levels of energy involved. All of the northern cultivators gasped, and began to cry out in alarm. Furthermore, the energy of the Living Mountain Incantation caused a massive wind to spring up, a wind so powerful it stung the faces of all cultivators it touched. Master Cloud Lightning couldn’t help but gasp in shock. He suddenly had the intense premonition that Bai Xiaochun… was too much for him to handle! “Dammit. Dammit! How could he have become so strong?!?!?! Only someone in the great circle of the Deva Realm could possibly be a match for him. And he hasn’t even used that trump card fist strike yet….” At that point, Master Cloud Lightning’s pupils constricted, and he began to back up as quickly as possible. However, even as he did, Bai Xiaochun began to stride forward! As he went after Master Cloud Lightning, Bai Xiaochun let out a low-pitched growl that contained heavenly might, forcing the other devas to brace themselves and fight back against it. One of them transformed into a black lightning bolt, another split up into nine cloud projections, and the third summoned an enormous furnace. Then all three of them shot forward to block Bai Xiaochun’s path. Bai Xiaochun didn’t even look at them. “Get the hell out of my way!” Roaring, he waved his hand, sending a blast of wind out to meet them. The black lightning bolt shattered, the nine cloud projections were ripped to pieces, and the enormous furnace broke into countless fragments. The three devas all coughed up blood, expressions of disbelief overtaking their faces as Bai Xiaochun flew right past them. “Too… too strong!!” Bai Xiaochun hadn’t slowed down at all. As he closed in on Master Cloud Lightning, he clenched his hand into a fist, causing a black vortex to spring up around it. “You ambushed me in the trial by fire, Master Cloud Lightning. And afterwards, you were completely unreasonable! And now you want to rely on your late Deva Realm cultivation base to kill me? “You\u0027ve been pestering me constantly since I got to the north. Well now, on this day, we’re going to settle all our debts and grudges!” Master Cloud Lightning’s mind was reeling, especially considering that he could plainly see Bai Xiaochun’s fist, and the black vortex spinning around it. Face flickering wildly, he flew backward and screamed, “What are you people standing around for!? Activate the sect’s grand defensive spell formation!!” The other three devas all began to shout orders. “Activate formation!!” “Power up the grand spell formation!!” As for the surrounding northern cultivators who had been standing around in stunned shock, they finally recovered from their reveries. Faces pale, they immediately began to go about activating their sect’s grand spell formation! It wasn’t a process that took a lot of time. Even as Bai Xiaochun closed in on Master Cloud Lightning, a massive force sprang out from the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect, creating a misty shield that emanated a formidable force of expulsion. Not only was Bai Xiaochun stopped in his tracks, but he was even pushed backward out of the sect. Bai Xiaochun frowned as he was shoved in the opposite direction, completely beyond his control. When Master Cloud Lightning and the other devas saw that, they finally breathed sighs of relief. The fight had spun out of control too quickly, leaving them more shaken with every second that passed. However, even as they breathed sighs of relief, Bai Xiaochun’s eyes glittered. “Spell formations don\u0027t work against me!” Drawing upon the Undying Hex, he bypassed the force of expulsion and pierced back through the spell formation shield. Shockingly, there was nothing that could stand in his way! Rumbling sounds could be heard as he appeared in front of Master Cloud Lightning, the black vortex around his fist rapidly devouring the spiritual energy in the area. An enormous, shadowy emperor appeared behind him, which then merged into his fist. The Undying Emperor’s Fist! When that fist struck, anything in creation could be destroyed! Master Cloud Lightning’s pupils constricted, and his mind spun crazily. There was no time to ponder what to do, and no way he could dodge out of the way. He could only howl at the top of his lungs and draw dangerously upon his energy to unleash his ninth transformation! In the blink of an eye, he was 270 meters tall and bracing himself for Bai Xiaochun’s blow! A boom rang out that surpassed anything from before. All sound in the area was crushed, to the point where it almost seemed silent. Then the shockwave erupted, shaking the entire Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect to its foundations. At the same time, Master Cloud Lightning’s eyes went wide, and he screamed uncontrollably. “Noooo!!” Blood erupted from his mouth like a waterfall as he was flung backward head over heels. He could no longer maintain his transformed form, and he shrank back down and then split apart into two people, both of whom continued to tumble backward, blood spraying out of their mouths…. The older brother among the two had it better off than the younger one. The younger brother simply couldn’t withstand the force, and was ripped to shreds….

It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama.","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
