{"id":46524,"no":1207,"title":"Chapter 1205: Shaking The Vile-Emperor!!","content":"The surrounding cultivators of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty had still not recovered from their shock. As for the Heavenspan Realm cultivators who were hidden in the crowd, they were still pleasantly shocked…. And that was exactly when Bai Xiaochun spoke in a thunderous voice that struck everyone down to their hearts!\\n\\n The Vile-Emperor Dynasty cultivators seemed to once again be filled with confidence, and gave voice to excited anticipation. \\n\\n “The Vile-Emperor!?!?!?”\\n\\n “Heavens! Don’t tell me the Vile-Emperor is actually among us right now?!?!”\\n\\n “Hahaha! This Bai Xiaochun is dead! When His Majesty the Vile-Emperor takes action, nobody in the entire Eternal Immortal Domains can stand up to his wrath, except maybe the Saint-Emperor!”\\n\\n Meanwhile, the air in the location that Bai Xiaochun had looked to began to ripple as a figure stepped out into the open.\\n\\n He wore golden imperial robes, as well as an imperial crown. He was tall and slender, but at the same time, nefarious and domineering in a way that shook everyone who looked at him!\\n\\n The archaean fluctuations which rolled off of him made him seem like a paragon entity of all creation, as though everywhere he went in the world, he would be as comfortable as if he were strolling in his own garden. The mere sight of him caused Bai Xiaochun’s pupils to constrict.\\n\\n He was none other than the Vile-Emperor!\\n\\n “My respects, Your Majesty!”\\n\\n “Your Majesty!!”\\n\\n “His Imperial Majesty!” \\n\\n A variety of formal greetings rang out to fill Megarock City as virtually everyone present dropped to their knees to kowtow.\\n\\n A calm expression could be seen on the Vile-Emperor’s face, although his eyes were ice-cold, making him seem threatening without being angry. After nodding in acknowledgement to his people, he looked at Bai Xiaochun.\\n\\n “Admit to your crimes, Bai Xiaochun,” he said coolly.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun had been waiting for this moment to arrive, and now that it had, his heart surged with the desire to do battle. Just as he had planned, he didn’t speak, but instead, began to advance on the Vile-Emperor.\\n\\n The Vile-Emperor snorted coldly, and then waved his hand in seemingly casual fashion. However, as a result, a tempest sprang out that immediately caused intense rumbling sounds to fill the area.\\n\\n The winds were filled with the divine sense and fluctuations of the Archaean Realm, and immediately formed a crushing force that bore down on Bai Xiaochun!\\n\\n Amidst the rumbling sounds, Bai Xiaochun continued to advance through the storm winds, and met the descending divine sense head on!\\n\\n In addition to the power of an Archaean, that divine sense also contained the Willpower of countless other living beings. Obviously, controlling Willpower was as easy for an archaean as turning over a hand. Furthermore, they could unleash it in ways that celestials simply couldn’t match up to. Generally, when archaeans manipulated Willpower, celestials would instantly be crushed by it!\\n\\n In their previous encounter, the Vile-Emperor had not resorted to Willpower because he had been intentionally trying to get Bai Xiaochun to teleport to the damaged fan, and bring him along. But now… he knew that trying to get the fan was useless. Furthermore, it was to his shock moments ago that he had sensed a sovereign aura within Bai Xiaochun’s attack. Thus, he had immediately resorted to Willpower to try to crush him!\\n\\n To Bai Xiaochun, it felt like everything around him was solidifying, and at the same time, a powerful force of expulsion was building up. It was as if the entire world, and everyone in it, was dead set on expelling him!\\n\\n The pressure became a boundless force that instantly slammed him down onto the ground below!\\n\\n In the face of a Willpower attack from an archaean, no celestial could possibly be strong enough to fight back!\\n\\n It was something Bai Xiaochun had not experienced when sparring with the archaean slave back on the treasured fan. After all, the archaean slave did not have a host of people worshiping him, whose Willpower he could draw upon!\\n\\n In the time it takes to flick a sleeve, Bai Xiaochun was suppressed, and cheers began to fill the air. However, even as the cheers began, Bai Xiaochun suddenly let out a powerful shout, and steeled himself.\\n\\n Eyes bloodshot, he looked up into the air and called upon… his sovereign aura!!\\n\\n The aura erupted from his right hand, and was not something that the observing cultivators could easily detect. However, it caused the Vile-Emperor’s eyes to widen, and his expression to turn unprecedentedly somber. Eyes flickering with icy light, he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, and then shoved it toward Bai Xiaochun in a palm strike!\\n\\n The palm strike seemed to rip a portion of the sky out, the same shape as the palm itself!\\n\\n Then, the wind, rain, thunder and lightning of the Eternal Lands… as well as the water in the Eternal Sea, and all living beings that existed in the world, seemed to materialize and fuse into that palm!\\n\\n It was no illusory palm! It was fueled by the Willpower at the control of the Vile-Emperor to create a massive, 3,000-meter-wide palm that bore down directly on Bai Xiaochun!\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun’s breath caught in his throat, but the sovereign aura weakened the Willpower that was crushing down on him, and lessened the pressure. Looking up, his battle spirit surged with even more intensity.\\n\\n “Come on, let’s fight!!” he shouted, leaping into the air toward the Vile-Emperor. As he moved, he clenched his right hand into a fist, causing a shadowy emperor to appear behind him.\\n\\n He wore imperial robes and an imperial crown, and looked exactly like Bai Xiaochun in every respect, with the exception of the fact that he had… the wolfish arm of a sovereign!!\\n\\n “Undying… Sovereign’s… Fist!!”\\n\\n Right now, the Undying Sovereign’s Fist was Bai Xiaochun’s most powerful divine ability, a trump card that could shake archaeans! After his experiments out in the void, and his sparring sessions with the archaean slave, Bai Xiaochun’s Undying Sovereign’s Fist could now be unleashed with complete impunity!\\n\\n At the same time, the sovereign aura merged into the fist strike, propelling it to the ultimate level of power.\\n\\n Incalculable levels of power began to converge on Bai Xiaochun’s fist, which he struck out to meet the archaean palm that raced toward him!\\n\\n The shadowy emperor’s sovereign arm merged with Bai Xiaochun, creating a fist that radiated the most shocking of energies!\\n\\n The sky and the lands all shook violently as force which far surpassed the level of a celestial gripped all creation!\\n\\n The entire immortal domain was trembling, and fluctuations rolled out, causing the celestials in Vile-Emperor City to be completely and utterly astonished.\\n\\n Meanwhile, something like an enormous giant appeared in the sky above Megarock City, the manifestation of Bai Xiaochun’s Undying Sovereign’s Fist, which slammed into the archaean palm strike. The collision… was like the sun and the moon smashing into each other!\\n\\n RRRUUUUMBLE!\\n\\n Megarock City shook violently, to the point where many buildings collapsed. Numerous mountains within the immortal domains were flattened, and crevices opened up throughout the lands!\\n\\n Massive waves covered the surface of the Eternal Sea, and even the immortal domain that was home to Vile-Emperor City began to shake in astonishing fashion.\\n\\n At this point, the shadowy emperor that existed behind Bai Xiaochun began to shatter into pieces! Bai Xiaochun was sent flying backward like a kite with its string cut, blood spraying out of his mouth as his Undying Codex healed him. He was seriously injured, but by the time he came to a stop, he was still able to stand upright!\\n\\n And then, he threw his head back and laughed uproariously.\\n\\n “Is that all you can do, Mr. Archaean Vile-Emperor?!?!”\\n\\n After all, the archaean palm strike had also shattered into bits!\\n\\n Even more telling, the backlash caused the Vile-Emperor to shiver, his face going pale as a stream of blood oozed out of one corner of his mouth!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1205","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \\n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
