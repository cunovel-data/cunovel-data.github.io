{"id":45878,"no":561,"title":"Chapter 559: Beaten But Not To Death","content":"In the same moment that Mistress Red-Dust destroyed the stone stele, it activated some unseen restrictive spell. The slowly-fading golden light dragon suddenly opened its eyes, causing all of the light shooting out of the holes in the walls to suddenly change direction and sweep through the crumbling sepulcher. The golden dragon vanished, and in the blink of an eye, the entire sepulcher was filled with dazzling, colorful shafts of light. Most of them landed on Mistress Red-Dust, causing her face to fall. The light possessed some corrosive power that instantly dissolved Mistress Red-Dust’s clothing, revealing her milky white skin. Then, glowing red dots appeared on her that began to eat down into her skin, a corrosive attack that required cultivation base power to fight against. Magical items were useless against it, and therefore, Mistress Red-Dust waved her hand in an attempt to destroy the light-emitting holes. However, nothing worked, and she was forced to simply try to evade the touch of the light. Bai Xiaochun was shocked by all of this, but was in no mood to ogle Mistress Red-Dust’s lithe body. Some of the light flying around the room landed on him as well, although the effects seemed rather mild.... “The curse. It\u0027s the curse.... I wiped away a line of text, but Mistress Red-Dust is far guiltier! Hah, the Arch-Emperor is a smart one after all!” Bai Xiaochun was feeling very proud of himself, and yet, before he had much time to gloat, a red mist sprang up around Mistress Red-Dust, she threw another set of clothing on, and then began to speed in his direction. The mist was rapidly being whittled away by the shooting light, and yet, Mistress Red-Dust seemed to think she had plenty of time to kill Bai Xiaochun! Bai Xiaochun’s eyes widened, and he let out a yelp of fright. “Your curse isn’t working, second generation Arch-Emperor....” With that, he shot forward with another burst of speed, becoming a series of afterimages as he fled from Mistress Red-Dust. However, Mistress Red-Dust was a deva, and even a casual effort on her part was something that a person like Bai Xiaochun, in the great circle of the Gold Core stage, would be powerless to fight against. A boom rang out, and blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth. Despair filled his eyes; if he couldn’t find the exit, he would be killed beyond the shadow of a doubt! “You’re too slow.” Mistress Red-Dust said coldly. She took a step forward that seemed to simultaneously stretch and shrink the space around her. Clearly, she was about to place herself right in front of Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun’s hair stood on end as he backed up, letting out another shriek. However, it was in that moment that the sepulcher began to sway back and forth even more dramatically than before. Virtually all the statues along the walls were now falling to pieces. Furthermore, a burst of teleportation power suddenly appeared. Clearly... a teleportation spell formation was activating! Its effects weren’t limited to the sepulcher. In the realm of trials by fire, as well as in the tunnels of the labyrinth, teleportation power began to build up. Obviously, the teleportation was only moments away. When that happened, everyone inside would be teleported away.... As of this moment... the exit was opening!! To everyone else, the chance to leave meant a chance to survive. But that wasn’t the case for Bai Xiaochun. Considering how Mistress Red-Dust was attacking him, he wouldn’t be able to hold out until the teleportation formation activated! However, the teleportation power interfered with Mistress Red-Dust’s technique, leaving her in exactly the same place she had been in moments ago. Aware that a teleportation was imminent, her eyes flashed with determination as she began to stride toward Bai Xiaochun. The shafts of light didn\u0027t seem to be hurting her very much at this point, and although the red dots on her skin were painful, she was able to suppress their effects with her cultivation base. Having no other options available, she summoned another cloud of red mist, and then attacked Bai Xiaochun again. Bai Xiaochun was like a trapped animal. In the moment he had in which Mistress Red-Dust was delayed, he quickly pulled out a Godly Vestige Pill and popped it into his mouth, then continued to fall back. However, all Mistress Red-Dust had to do was take a single step, and his speed was useless. In the blink of an eye, she was right in front of him, whereupon she waved her right index finger in his direction. Although she moved her finger casually through the air, it contained wildly destructive power. A sense of profound deadly crisis immediately caused Bai Xiaochun\u0027s bloodshot eyes to go wide. Considering he had no options left, he decided to throw caution to the wind and simply attack her with everything he had! Bai Xiaochun knew that his only chance now was to buy some time for the teleportation spell formation to finish activating. “Let\u0027s finish this!” he roared, unleashing all of the potential of his Undying Live Forever Technique. Utilizing his Undying Gold Skin, Undying Heavenly King, and Undying Tendons, he reached out toward Mistress Red-Dust and pinched his fingers together! It was none other than the Throat Crushing Grasp! But then, a boom echoed out, along with a scream from Bai Xiaochun, as Mistress Red-Dust simply grabbed his hand! With a slight gleam of disdain in her eye, she tossed him to the side. Cracking sounds could be heard as his fingers were broken, and a massive force sent him flying away. Thankfully, his cultivation base and Undying Live Forever Technique made him extremely tough. Despite not being killed, he slammed over and over again into the ground, bones shattering and blood spurting out everywhere! His Undying Live Forever Technique had been completely routed! It took only the shortest of moments for Bai Xiaochun to be severely injured. Chuckling coldly, Mistress Red-Dust said, “Aren’t we the tough one? Got anything else left in you?” Then she flickered into motion to eradicate the last bit of Bai Xiaochun’s life force. Bai Xiaochun could tell how badly he had been injured, and could sense that the flame of his life force was on the verge of being extinguished. Groaning, he stuffed his mouth full of Godly Vestige Pills, but swallowed only one of them. Waves of heat washed through him, repairing his body with incredible speed. However, that was all the time it took Mistress Red-Dust to reach him. Eyes bloodshot, he released the power of his cultivation base, causing frigid qi to shoot out with reckless abandon. He even drew upon his spiritual power, not holding back even the smallest bit. In the blink of an eye, the entire sepulcher filled with cracking sounds as it froze into a world of ice. There was no time for thought or planning. Bai Xiaochun immediately turned and fled. Although all of this takes a bit of time to describe, it took place in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint. Mistress Red-Dust’s eyes flickered with scorn; she could tell that Bai Xiaochun was trying to buy time, and yet, was still confident that even still, she would be able to crush him to death. As the frigid qi bore down on her, she waved her hand, causing it to crumble and disperse. Then she reached out with her finger, piercing through the air to appear right in front of Bai Xiaochun. She was planning to end Bai Xiaochun’s life in that moment, but before she could, the shafts of light destroyed her red mist, forcing her to summon it again. Before she could, the red dots on her skin corroded her even further, forcing her to combat the effects with her cultivation base. Because of all of those distractions, she could only spare thirty to forty percent of her power to attack Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun was spattered with blood, but could do nothing to dodge or evade her. Howling with rage, he resorted to the Mountain Shaking Bash! A boom rang out, along with a miserable howl as Bai Xiaochun was flung off to the side again, where he slammed into the crumbling wall. Virtually all of the bones in his body were broken, and the flame of his life force was once again pushed to the edge of being extinguished. However, almost no time passed before he bit down onto one of the Godly Vestige Pills he’d put into his mouth earlier. Warmth spread through him again, healing him almost instantly. Even as Mistress Red-Dust closed in him again, he danced to the side in lively fashion, causing her brow to furrow. Snorting coldly, she momentarily stopped worrying about the dots on her skin or the red mist, and unleashing a mighty blow onto Bai Xiaochun. “I refuse to believe that you can recover from a true killing blow!” The massive image of an illusory hand closed in on Bai Xiaochun, causing the air to twist and distort and releasing explosive energy in all directions. “Lord Bai isn’t the kind of guy you can just kill whenever you want, Granny Red-Dust!” Even as the huge hand bore down on him, Bai Xiaochun whipped out his Eternal Parasol. Nine silver designs shone on its surface as he snapped it open. Then, the bizarre face appeared.

It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama.","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
