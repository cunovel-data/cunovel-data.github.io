{"id":45422,"no":105,"title":"Chapter 103: I Want To Serve The Sect!","content":"There weren’t many Spirit Stream Sect disciples in the Wildweed Mountains, only a few dozen. The area didn’t have many Foundation Establishment-level beasts, but it still had its dangers, even for Inner Sect disciples. Only people who considered themselves to be especially powerful would go there. When Bai Xiaochun cried out his warnings, some disciples would respond and heed his advice. They would take his apology gift and leave. However, a few bull-headed individuals would arrogantly assume that he was crying out for help, and would pretend they couldn’t hear him. Some of them even hoped to collect his bag of holding after he died. They would continue whatever it was they were doing, and think little more of the matter. But it wouldn’t take long before they realized the beasts were acting strange, impulsive and maddened. Shangguan Tianyou was in the Wildweed Mountains, and as soon as he heard Bai Xiaochun calling out, his eyes flickered, and he ignored him. He was on the same mission as Bai Xiaochun, looking for Lifestealers, but at the moment, he was shocked by the sight of a huge bear in the sixth level of Qi Condensation, who was wrapped around a tree, banging into it over and over again.... It wasn’t his first time seeing something like that. He’d seen a rabbit earlier that had ambushed him with raving madness. When he realized that the situation seemed familiar, his scalp suddenly went numb. “Something’s off here. What’s changed in the Wildweed Mountains?!” Then he thought back to Bai Xiaochun’s Aphrodisiac Pill, and his heart seized. By this point, Bai Xiaochun had over thirty Lifestealer cores in his bag of holding, and was continuing his work with the Aphrodisiac Pills. About half a month later, he was overjoyed to discover a V-shaped valley located deep within the mountains, a place that had a strong wind.... The valley would suck in the wind and then vent it out to fill a large portion of the Wildweed Mountains. Based on Bai Xiaochun’s calculations, it would only take three days for the wind from the valley to fill nearly half of the Wildweed Mountains. Even standing there in the wind, he would only last for about one breath of time before losing his footing. He immediately felt connected to the place, as if by destiny. Hair whipping about, he looked down at the spot where the wind shot out and said, “This is definitely the best place to disseminate powder throughout the mountains!! There shouldn\u0027t be any fellow disciples here either. I can safely harvest to my heart’s content!” Bai Xiaochun was starting to get very excited. In order to ensure nothing bad happened to his fellow disciples, he\u0027d already given out about ten cores. However, he didn’t regret that at all. He was sure that he could get more. He could even visualize the merit points flowing in. Taking a deep breath, he brought out all of the rest of the Aphrodisiac Pills and crushed them. The rushing wind immediately carried the powder out into the rest of the Wildweed Mountains. Bai Xiaochun stood on a nearby mountain peak, looking out proudly at the jungle below, feeling very heroic. “I, Bai Xiaochun, have worked tirelessly to benefit the Wildweed Mountains. One can only imagine how many animals will be born in the coming years.... What a wonderful meritorious service.” He sighed emotionally as howls began to rise from within the forest. More and more howls could be heard, until they filled the air ceaselessly. In one day, twenty percent of the Wildweed Mountains had been covered.... The roars reached a shocking level. Three days later... half of the Wildweed Mountains were going mad! At that point, Bai Xiaochun flew along, dispersing Pheromone Pills every so often to attract the nearby beasts. At the same time, he collected more and more Lifestealer cores. He was very pleased with everything. Not only was he collecting plenty of cores, he was also bringing happiness to all the creatures in the Wildweed Mountains. When he saw so many animals pouncing on each other, he couldn’t help but marvel at how he was benefiting the environment. “What a good person I am,” he thought to himself. “The beasts in these mountains are definitely going to thank me later.” And so he continued along, throwing out Pheromone Pills all the way. Of course, there were some disciples in the mountains who had ignored his earlier cries. Their eyes soon went wide at the maddened state of the animals. The sight of all the animals pouncing on one another... left the disciples gasping. “What’s... what\u0027s going on!?” “Why... why does this scene seem so familiar....” Shocked, the disciples all began to flee in terror. “Bai Xiaochun!!” Shangguan Tianyou was going all out to kill the nearby beasts and fly away. His heart filled with terror when he recalled what had occurred to Beihan Lie, and he began to shiver. Unfortunately for this handful of people, they were deep within the Wildweed Mountains, and getting out was no easy task. That was especially the case considering that all of the beasts in the area were going completely mad.... Bai Xiaochun flew along, happily tossing Pheromone Pills around. He attracted large numbers of beasts, and collected numerous Lifestealer cores. By the time he left the Wildweed Mountains half a month later, he had two hundred cores in his bag of holding. Completely satisfied, he headed back toward the sect. Some days after he left, Shangguan Tianyou and the other disciples finally emerged. Their faces were pale and filled with bitterness, and their hair disheveled. They were all in bad condition, with blank looks on their faces. After finally emerging, they would throw their heads back and howl bitterly. As for what exactly had occurred within those mountains... it was a complete mystery to them. After returning to the sect, Bai Xiaochun raced directly to the Missions Office. When the disciples there saw that he was turning in two hundred Lifestealer cores, their eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. After incredulously examining the cores, they looked back at Bai Xiaochun in shock. Throughout the years, Lifestealer core missions would pop up occasionally, although usually only one at a time. Generally speaking, it would take a whole year for a disciple to collect a mere ten of them. But within a few months, Bai Xiaochun had managed to collect an unthinkable amount. “He definitely deserves to be the Junior Brother of the sect leader, a Prestige disciple, and the first place winner of the Chosen battles....” The other Inner Sect disciples looked enviously at Bai Xiaochun. After clearing his inventory, he racked up 200,000 merit points. Although he tried to put on a show of looking indifferent, it was impossible for him to completely conceal how proud of himself he was. The matter shook the entire south bank. Anyone who heard that someone had collected 200,000 merit points in one shot almost couldn’t believe it. But then word began to spread from the disciples Bai Xiaochun had advised to leave the Wildweed Mountains, and soon, the three mountain peaks of the south bank were buzzing with the news. “What a monster!!” “Crazy! He filled half of the Wildweed Mountains with Aphrodisiac Pills!!” “We won\u0027t be able to go there for a long time now....” Even as the discussions raged, Shangguan Tianyou and the other bedraggled disciples began to filter back into the sect. Shangguan Tianyou was aware that Bai Xiaochun was the cause of what had happened, so he wasn’t so surprised at the results. But when the other disciples realized the situation, they howled at the tops of their lungs. However, there was nothing they could do about Bai Xiaochun. After all... he had warned them repeatedly, and they had heard, but chosen to ignore him. Now they regretted what they had done; a mere response on their part, and they could have avoided such a tragic fate. Bai Xiaochun was extremely pleased with the results. In subsequent days, he would often appear at the Missions Office, whereupon he would select missions involving collecting things from beasts. He almost seemed addicted. After each mission, he would concoct batches of medicinal pills and head out again.... Each time, he drove more disciples mad. Whether those disciples were out on missions or not, it didn’t matter. After all, any location Bai Xiaochun went to on his own missions had to be avoided for significant periods of time afterward. They were far too dangerous…. The Cloudpeak Mountains, Frostforest Mountains, Brightsummit Mountains, Lasteast Mountains.... For an entire year, Bai Xiaochun was a mission-accomplishing maniac. He swept through all of the missions that involved beasts, and his harvests were always incredible. Each and every time, the Missions Office was left completely shaken. At the same time, countless Inner Sect disciples were driven to madness. Eventually, he cleared all of the beast-related missions on Fragrant Cloud Peak, after which he went to Green Crest Peak, and then Violet Cauldron Peak. He took all of the missions there, and soon helped the disciples there realize what a true missions fiend was. In the end, the Inner Sect disciples of the south bank were driven to complete despair. None of the mountain ranges near the sect were safe to enter, as they were filled with countless sexually charged beasts.... Having no other option, hundreds of Inner Sect disciples from the three mountain peaks signed a petition to the sect, requesting that Bai Xiaochun be exempted from mission service.... Li Qinghou didn\u0027t want to interfere; it was a rare occasion when Bai Xiaochun was so enthused about serving the sect. The matter turned into a huge headache for the sect leader. He was coming to find that after Bai Xiaochun joined the sect, he would frequently be struck with such headaches. Every time he heard Bai Xiaochun’s name mentioned, he would subconsciously sigh. “It\u0027s almost better when he\u0027s not working hard. As soon as he gets serious... it’s really... ai, Bai Xiaochun causes a disaster no matter which mission he picks! “Doesn’t he want to work at pill concocting? Go concoct pills then! The sect will provide the merit points, as long things calm down....” When the signatures on the petition rose from a few hundred to over a thousand, the sect leader gritted his teeth and went to discuss the matter with Li Qinghou. Finally, they exempted Bai Xiaochun from mission service for the following ten years. He was the only disciple in the sect who didn’t have to do missions, but would still get a huge amount of merit points from the sect. Bai Xiaochun wasn’t very happy about the situation. He had been browsing missions at the Missions Office, and had just found one he wanted to take, when he got the notification. He was stunned. “What the hell?” he exclaimed loudly. “I want to serve the sect! I want to work hard! This is ridiculous!” Under the solemn gazes of the Missions Office disciples, he sighed, then stuck his chin up and swished his sleeve. “With the snap of a finger, I reduced the Missions Office... to ashes.” Shaking his head, he sighed. Looking very lonely, he made his way off into the distance.

It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama.","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
