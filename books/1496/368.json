Of course, they wished they could do something to stop Bai Xiaochun, but he was in an area of extreme danger that they didn’t even dare to enter....\\n\\n They could only watch wide-eyed as the two turtles sped further and further into the zone of defensive spells. 3,900 meters. 4,800 meters. Before long, Bai Xiaochun was 6,000 meters in, a distance that none of the rest of the sects dared to attempt to match.\\n\\n “6,000... 6,000 meters!?!?”\\n\\n “Dammit! How could this guy possibly get 6,000 meters in? Doesn’t... doesn’t that mean that he’s going to get past the Dao River Court and have the first chance to get the legacy seals?!?!”\\n\\n As the cultivators of the three sects realized what was happening, shouts of astonishment and jealousy began to rise up into the air.\\n\\n 6,000 meters in, the magic was so intense that it fell like rain. At that point, Bai Xiaochun stopped for a moment, slowly lifted the edge of the turtle-wok and looked out with eager anticipation.\\n\\n He could hear the shouts of astonishment coming from behind him, and it made him happier than ever. Even as he wallowed in his pride, the Mountain of Legacy Seals began to tremble, and a legacy seal flew out. As it circled about, it got closer and closer to Bai Xiaochun.\\n\\n “Hahaha! Now nobody can even think of stealing it from me. Hey little legacy seal, come over here!” Smiling broadly, he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, and then waved his finger at the incoming legacy seal.\\n\\n Whoever was closest to the legacy seals obviously had the advantage, and at the moment, nobody was there to compete with Bai Xiaochun. The legacy seal shivered in place, then shot toward Bai Xiaochun, disappearing into the turtle shell.\\n\\n “Got one!” he cried excitedly, absorbing it.\\n\\n When the cultivators of the three sects saw this happen, their eyes turned as red as rabbits’. That was especially true of the people from the Dao River Court. They poured power into their giant to try to get it to move forward, and even as they did, another legacy seal flew out and was grabbed by Bai Xiaochun. The rage of the cultivators burned hot and bright.\\n\\n “Are you looking to die, Bai Xiaochun!?!?\"\\n\\n “This isn’t fair!!”\\n\\n “You’re pushing things too far, Bai Xiaochun!!”\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun only began to hum his little tune louder than before. After resting for a bit longer under the turtle shell, he saw a third legacy seal, which he quickly sucked into the shell.\\n\\n “I guess I’ll just wait here and grab each one as it comes along. Hmph!” Feeling more pleased than ever, and more awesome, Bai Xiaochun thought about bringing out his mirror to ask imposter Nightcrypt how amazing he was.\\n\\n However, it didn\u0027t seem like a good idea at the moment, so he suppressed it.\\n\\n He was feeling quite comfortable underneath the turtle shell, grabbing legacy seals at leisure. However, the cultivators of the three sects were simmering on the point of complete madness.\\n\\n If things kept going the way they were, then Bai Xiaochun would likely pull off a miracle, a miracle that would leave them humiliated more than they had been in years!\\n\\n That was especially true of the dozens of Core Formation Chosen from the Dao River Court. The pressure on them was suddenly quite intense. The entire group went all out, causing the illusory giant to turn even more corporeal, and then carry them forward 1,500 meters in a wild sprint.\\n\\n The Polarity and Starry River Court cultivators also took various risks, gritting their teeth to shoot forward once again.\\n\\n The three sects advanced in grand fashion, with their cultivators using all sorts of magical items, divine abilities and magical techniques. They utilized everything within their power to try to head deeper into the danger zone.\\n\\n When Bai Xiaochun sensed the surge of energy behind him, and realized that the three sects were trying to catch up, his anger flared.\\n\\n “This is my spot! I can’t believe you people are going to try to steal from me again. Complete bullies!!” Gritting his teeth, he hunkered down in the turtle shell and started crawling forward again.\\n\\n The little turtle followed along, laughing in amusement.\\n\\n Time passed. As Bai Xiaochun crawled forward, he continued to grab the legacy seals as they flew out. Eventually, the Dao River Court reached the 6,000-meter mark. The Polarity River Court was right behind them, and even the Starry River Court had reached the 3,600-meter mark. All three sects had truly reached their limit. And yet, to their complete despair, Bai Xiaochun had already crawled up to the 9,000-meter mark.\\n\\n And he kept going. Soon, he reached 10,500 meters. Then 12,000....\\n\\n The distances involved left the Dao River Court in a state of complete hopelessness. The Polarity River Court was filled with bitterness, and the Starry River Court was going mad. One legacy seal after another flew out and was taken by Bai Xiaochun. All the cultivators were filled with a sense of indescribable powerlessness.\\n\\n “12,000... 12,000 meters....”\\n\\n “This can’t really be happening....” As of this moment, the Starry River Court had two legacy seals, the Polarity River Court had one more than them, and the Dao River Court had the most with five.\\n\\n All of the other legacy seals were going to Bai Xiaochun....\\n\\n To make matters even worse, Bai Xiaochun was loudly announcing how many he’d acquired.\\n\\n “Thirty-one!”\\n\\n “Thirty-seven!”\\n\\n “Forty-three!”\\n\\n The Mountain of Legacy Seals was shaking violently. From ancient times until now, nothing like this had ever happened. No one had ever gotten so close to the mountain, or acquired so many legacy seals.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun was completely elated. He even took a moment to look back at the cultivators from the other three sects, and felt more wonderful than ever. After that, he decided he might as well keep crawling forward.\\n\\n “Forty-seven!”\\n\\n “Fifty-three!”\\n\\n “Fifty-seven!”\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun’s voice continued to ring out as he got closer and closer to the Mountain of Legacy Seals. The cultivators of the three sects felt as if wild beasts were trampling their hearts. As they watched Bai Xiaochun, their eyes burned with madness and killing intent. From the look of things, if they could, they would ignore the rules and simply kill him.\\n\\n “Shut up!!”\\n\\n “Dammit. You’re completely shameless! Cheater!!”\\n\\n “I\u0027m gonna kill you!!!”\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun turned around and disdainfully lifted the back edge of the turtle-wok to peer out at the three sects. Then he cried out as loudly as possible, “Do you people dare to come over here!? We can have an epic fight. I dare you! Come on! I\u0027m waiting for you right here!”\\n\\n Saying such words was like pouring fuel onto the fire. The three sects exploded with rage, especially Chen Yunshan, whose face was distorted from fury.\\n\\n A moment passed, and then Bai Xiaochun sighed and said, “Why aren’t any of you coming over? How about.... you all come together?! I’ll take you all on at once! What do you say...? Lord Bai is getting tired of waiting.... Ai, heroes are always so lonely. The scenery here is wonderful, what a pity none of you dare to come share it with me.”\\n\\n With that, he grabbed another legacy seal.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun was used to calling out the numbers by now, so he yelled, “This is the fifty-ninth!”\\n\\n After some thought, he was curious what it would be like even closer to the mountain, so he began to proceed forward again.\\n\\n At the same time, the cultivators of the three sects realized that they couldn’t stay in their current positions safely, and began to move in the opposite direction.\\n\\n Of course, a scene of similar madness could be seen outside of the legacy zone….\\n\\n Some time earlier, the River-Defying Sect\u0027s circle on the glowing screen had suddenly lit up.\\n\\n Frigidsect, Crimsonsoul, and Master Godwind were immediately delighted. After all, that glowing light represented the honor of the whole sect. Based on how bright their glowing circle was compared to the other three sects, they were able to speculate that Bai Xiaochun had acquired a single legacy seal.\\n\\n “Even one makes this whole thing worth it!” Crimsonsoul thought, tightening his hands into fists. Not too far away, the red-haired old man from the Starry River Court felt his heart suddenly tremble. He even frowned, although it only lasted for a moment.\\n\\n “Congratulations, River-Defying Sect,” he said with a false smile. “You got lucky and managed to get a single legacy seal. However, luck will only carry you so far in--” Before he could finish speaking, the River-Defying Sect’s glowing circle suddenly got a bit brighter. Then, only moments later, it brightened again. Soon, it was brighter than the Starry River Court’s circle.\\n\\n The Nascent Soul patriarchs from the other three sects were shocked, especially those from the Starry River Court.\\n\\n “How is this possible?!”\\n\\n The three patriarchs from the River-Defying Sect were also astonished, and exchanged incredulous glances.\\n\\n The red-haired old man’s expression was extremely unsightly, and rage could be seen flickering in his eyes. All of a sudden, he felt as if the disciples he had sent into the legacy zone were completely useless. Even as he began to feel regret in his heart, the River-Defying Sect’s glowing circle got even brighter!\\n\\n There were no rumbling sounds, but everyone felt as if their minds were crashing with thunder. The River-Defying Sect’s glowing circle was getting brighter with indescribable speed. A moment later, and it surpassed the Polarity River Court!\\n\\n The Nascent Soul Daoist masters from the Polarity River Court couldn’t prevent their expressions from flickering.\\n\\n Moments later, the River-Defying Sect surpassed the Dao River Court. The white-haired old man took a step forward to stare more closely at the glowing circles. Everyone had looks of madness overtaking their faces.\\n\\n The brightness of the River-Defying Sect’s glowing circle was increasing so dramatically that it completely exceeded the imaginations of all present!\\n\\n --\\n\\n Translator: Deathblade.

It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \\n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
