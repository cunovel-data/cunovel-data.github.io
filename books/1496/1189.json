{"id":46506,"no":1189,"title":"Chapter 1187: Slaughtering A Celestial!","content":"Bai Xiaochun began to rave with maddened laughter, laughter filled with all the vicious rage that he had been keeping suppressed during his time in the Eternal Immortal Domains!\\n\\n “Well in that case… I guess I might as well kill a celestial!” Reverend Devourer had been forced into retreat by the Waterswamp Kingdom, and Celestial Deadfall had been injured to the point of coughing up blood by the Godkiller. Therefore, it was without hesitation that Bai Xiaochun shot toward Celestial Deadfall!\\n\\n As he moved, countless rocks and boulders formed around him, transforming him into an enormous stone golem!\\n\\n Then, he utilized the Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation, causing his stone golem form’s fleshly body power to increase dramatically, and to grow even larger than before. By the time the process was complete, he was radiating energy that caused the sky to grow dim, and sent a wild wind screaming across the lands.\\n\\n Celestial Deadfall could hardly breathe. Eyes wide from the sensation of deadly crisis, he immediately unleashed the full power of his cultivation base, and drew upon all of the magical items and trump cards that he could think of.\\n\\n And yet, none of that did anything to reduce the sensation of profound danger. In fact, as Bai Xiaochun advanced toward him, that sensation only grew more intense!\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun’s fleshly body power erupted as he used his Undying Hex, as well as the Mountain Shaking Bash!\\n\\n It was almost as if he had transformed into an enormous mountain that blurred through the air toward Celestial Deadfall!\\n\\n Celestial Deadfall felt like he was collapsing mentally. However, he couldn’t evade the blow. In his despair, he prepared to meet the strike head on to try to survive it. And yet, Bai Xiaochun had not yet resorted to his most deadly technique. As he neared… he clenched his hand into a fist.\\n\\n He was using… the Undying Emperor’s Fist!!\\n\\n It was no ordinary Undying Emperor’s Fist. It was backed by the Living Mountain Incantation, the Cloud Lighting Forefather Transformation, his fleshly body power, his Mountain Shaking Bash, and his Undying Hex, as well as all of the life force he had just absorbed with the Godkiller technique! This was… a fist strike of unparalleled destructive power!\\n\\n Everything in the area began to tremble violently as energy fluctuations were released that surpassed ordinary celestials. This energy… was on the very cusp of being in the great circle of the Celestial Realm!!\\n\\n “Time to die!!” Bai Xiaochun shouted. Meanwhile, Celestial Deadfall howled in desperation as they collided.\\n\\n BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!\\n\\n Everything in the area shook violently, even Vile-Emperor City. Mountains crumbled, and countless cultivators in the city were stunned by the deafening explosion.\\n\\n A shockwave spread out everywhere, along with a sound so loud that even Celestial Deadfall’s cry of anguish was drowned out.\\n\\n When the dust cleared, Bai Xiaochun stood there, his right sleeve gone, revealing his arm. Although his arm seemed intact, closer inspection revealed that it was covered with too many wounds to count.\\n\\n However, those wounds immediately began to heal up. At the same time, it was possible to see a crater in front of Bai Xiaochun, at the bottom of which were scattered… chunks of bloody flesh and gore!!\\n\\n Celestial Deadfall\u0027s fleshly body had been completely destroyed!!\\n\\n His Daoseed flew out, and then vanished….\\n\\n A celestial… had been killed.\\n\\n This was the second time in the Eternal Immortal Domains that a celestial had been killed in recent times. The first to have been killed was the old woman who had been killed by the sovereign clone, and now Celestial Deadfall. Although he could be resurrected, it was still completely momentous.\\n\\n Off in the distance, Reverend Devourer panted for breath, his mind spinning.\\n\\n “Bai Xiaochun, how… how dare you kill a celestial!!”\\n\\n Although the Vile-Emperor Dynasty and the Saint-Emperor Dynasty had been at odds for many years, nothing like this had ever happened before. Not only was Reverend Devourer stunned by the death of Celestial Deadfall… he was also terrified of Bai Xiaochun’s display of battle prowess!\\n\\n “He\u0027s already reached the point… where he can kill a celestial with a single fist strike!!” Reverend Devourer shivered with fear. Although the Waterswamp Kingdom had already faded away, he was still completely terrified.\\n\\n Before he could come to his senses, Bai Xiaochun turned to him, eyes bloodshot, and began to walk toward him.\\n\\n “And then there’s you!!”\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun\u0027s right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and then he waved his finger in Reverend Devourer’s direction. Instantly, numerous Live Forever Lamps sprang up in the area. At the same time, Reverend Devourer himself became a lamp, along with the sky above and the land below.\\n\\n Reverend Devourer’s face fell, not from fear of the technique, but rather, because Bai Xiaochun had just pulled out the Greatsword of the North, and was accelerating in his direction.\\n\\n Obviously, he planned to take advantage of Reverend Devourer being stuck in place by the Live Forever Lamps… to kill him!\\n\\n “Dammit, this guy really holds grudges!” Gasping for breath, he performed an incantation gesture, causing a blood-colored light to spring up around him. In that same moment, the energy of the Live Forever Lamps erupted, smashing into the blood-colored light and shattering it.\\n\\n At the same time, the Greatsword of the North descended toward Reverend Devourer. Normally speaking, Reverend Devourer would have chosen to go all out to seize victory. But right now, his life was more important to him than the spell formation or the people of Heavenspan. After all, everything had been set up by the Vile-Prince to begin with.\\n\\n Therefore, it was without hesitation that he threw everything he had into blocking the sword strike. Then, blood spraying from his mouth, he sped off into the distance.\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun stood there panting, looking like he was completely out of control. However, the truth was that he knew exactly what he was doing. For one thing, his spectacular gains in the damaged fan had pushed him to the very brink of the late Celestial Realm.\\n\\n Second was that he was completely enraged by the situation the Vile-Prince had set up. Ignoring the fleeing Reverend Devourer, Bai Xiaochun hefted the Greatsword of the North and then slashed it down toward the spell formation!\\n\\n “Be destroyed!!” he shouted. As the sword descended, one of the nine black dragons that made up the foundation of the formation howled as it was absolutely destroyed.\\n\\n The other eight quickly rushed over to gobble up the bits of the destroyed dragon. Bai Xiaochun had never seen a spell formation like this before, but he could tell that it was extraordinary. Although he could use his Undying Hex to get into it, his goal was to save everyone inside. Therefore, using the Undying Hex would be too much of a waste of time. Being so close to Vile-Emperor City, time was of the essence. He needed the spell formation open immediately. Lifting the Greatsword of the North up again, he cut down toward the spell formation.\\n\\n BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!\\n\\n He struck seven times, destroying a black dragon with each blow. Each time, the spell formation trembled and grew weaker, until soon, the turbid chaos began to fade away to reveal… the tens of thousands of Heavenspan Realm cultivators inside!\\n\\n They were seated cross-legged in meditation, their faces ashen. Some were clearly putting up a fight, but some had already been reduced to skeletons….\\n\\n Bai Xiaochun quickly spotted Li Qinghou and Patriarch Spirit Stream.\\n\\n “Uncle Li….” Bai Xiaochun murmured. It had been years since they had last seen each other. Li Qinghou’s hair was no longer black, but gray. Next to him was Patriarch Spirit Stream, who looked haggard and withered. There were many other familiar faces, all of whom caused Bai Xiaochun to howl with rage as he slashed away with the Greatsword of the North.\\n\\n It was at this point that, with no warning whatsoever, a beam of light shot out from Vile-Emperor City toward Bai Xiaochun.\\n\\n “Feeling suicidal, Bai Xiaochun?!?!” The voice that rang into Bai Xiaochun’s ears belonged to none other than the strongest celestial in the Vile-Emperor City… Celestial Virūpākṣa!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1187","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \\n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
