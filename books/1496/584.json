{"id":45901,"no":584,"title":"Chapter 582: Bai Clan, East Outskirts","content":"Li Feng was getting very, very nervous. After all, this Grandmaster Bai was a terrestrial necromancer, the most powerful necromancer Li Feng had ever met.\n The benefits of being a follower of a person like that defied description, and Li Feng knew that if he didn’t seize this opportunity, he would regret it for the rest of his life. Aware that he had to do something to make himself valuable, he quickly cried, “Wait for me, Grandmaster Bai! I can be of a lot of use. For example, when you need souls, I can go looking for them for you. I can also--”\n Bai Xiaochun paused midstride. After all, the things that Li Feng was saying made sense.\n As for Zhou Yixing, his heart was starting to pound with anger. Back before Bai Xiaochun had proved to be a terrestrial necromancer, he had felt that being his follower was somewhat of an insult. But now things were completely different; as far as he was concerned, Bai Xiaochun was almost like a deva.\n Zhou Yixing had done a lot of boot-licking to try to get Li Feng kicked away, only to have him shamelessly offer to do the same things that he himself was responsible for.\n “I can do that too!” he shouted, worried that Bai Xiaochun would agree.\n Bai Xiaochun blinked a few times, but maintained his calm. He could tell that these two viewed each other as competition, and the truth was, he was actually pleased by that. Without saying anything, he continued along.\n Feeling a bit better, Zhou Yixing glared over at Li Feng and pondered how he would stomp him to death if his cultivation base were unsealed....\n Li Feng couldn’t just sit around and let Zhou Yixing act like this. Turning anxiously toward Bai Xiaochun, he raised his voice and said, “Grandmaster Bai, I... I know a place where you can get a huge amount of souls!!”\n “So do I!” Zhou Yixing shouted immediately. “I know lots of places like that!”\n “I can concoct soul medicine for you, Grandmaster!” Li Feng said. “I\u0027m at the peak of the master necromancer rank, so I can make plenty of soul medicine to keep you safe, your majesty!!”\n “I can concoct soul medicine too!” Zhou Yixing said through gritted teeth.\n “You’re pushing things too far, Zhou Yixing! I know a place where you can get Heavenspan River water! That stuff is incredibly valuable! Even a single drop can get you tons and tons of soul medicine! Can you match that, Zhou Yixing?!” Li Feng shouted.\n “I....” If Zhou Yixing were back home, he could definitely do that, but here, there was no way....\n Bai Xiaochun’s eyes brightened. He had been aware that Heavenspan River water was rare in the Wildlands, and that it was valuable, but he had never really put much thought into exactly how valuable it would be....\n Seeing that Zhou Yixing appeared to be at a loss for words, Li Feng started to get excited, and immediately began to list out all his selling points in the hopes that he could get Bai Xiaochun’s attention. \n “I know somewhere you can get a deva soul!\n “I can gather all kinds of information from the area!\n “I can--”\n Eyes bloodshot, Zhou Yixing was just about to offer a retort when Bai Xiaochun suddenly stopped and turned around. \n Then, Zhou Yixing’s heart began to pound as he realized that Bai Xiaochun was staring at Li Feng.\n “Did you just say that you know the location of a deva soul?”\n Bursting with excitement at Bai Xiaochun’s reaction, Li Feng immediately clasped hands and bowed deeply.\n “Grandmaster Bai, your humble servant absolutely has some information about a deva soul. According to the rumors, the Giant Ghost King himself has one. In addition to him, each of the three great necromancer clans within Giant Ghost City territory also has one!”\n Bai Xiaochun frowned. From what he could tell, this information might as well be a complete fabrication.\n Zhou Yixing was delighted to see Bai Xiaochun frowning, and decided that he had to counter attack. “Hmph. The Giant Ghost King is a demigod expert. How could you possibly just take a deva soul from him?! And as for what you said about the necromancer clans, that’s pure speculation!” \n Li Feng stared at him coldly for a moment, then chuckled. Putting a very respectful expression onto his face, he looked at Bai Xiaochun and said, “How could I possibly do anything to deceive Grandmaster Bai? Obviously, the deva soul possessed by the exalted Giant Ghost King is not something to go after. As for the necromancer clans, there are two who I can\u0027t say for certain have a deva soul. But one of them does. I’d stake my life on that fact!\n “I was once a vassal in that very clan, and during one of their ceremonies, I had the honor of seeing that deva soul with my own eyes. It bore the semblance of sandy soil, and instantly caused incredible pressure to weigh down in the entire area!” As soon as Bai Xiaochun heard Li Feng’s complete description, his eyes sparkled.\n Deva souls were precious treasures in the Wildlands just like they were in the lands of Heavenspan. They were the type of thing that few people could ever lay eyes on, and as such, few people knew what they would look like. However, Li Feng’s description matched the description exactly.\n “If he’s telling the truth, then that means he saw an earth-type deva soul. I already have fire, wood, and water.... I\u0027m just missing metal and earth!” Bai Xiaochun’s heart was palpitating in eagerness.\n “Which clan are you talking about?” Bai Xiaochun asked, his eyes sparkling.\n Li Feng hesitated for a moment, but considering that his chance to be Bai Xiaochun’s follower was at stake, he finally said, “The Bai Clan, on the east outskirts of the city!”\n Bai Xiaochun’s eyes widened in surprise. The clan Li Feng had just mentioned sounded very familiar, and when he realized why, his jaw dropped....\n “The east outskirts of the city…” he thought. “Three great necromancer clans... the Bai Clan.... Isn’t that the clan Bai Hao came from?” Such thoughts got his heart pounding. “But a clan like that, a great clan attached to Giant Ghost City... they must have a deva patriarch!” \n Bai Xiaochun licked his lips, and yet, was still hesitating. However, he absolutely had to get more deva souls, and considering that he was already masquerading as Bai Hao, it would probably make things easier.\n As he hesitated, the nervous Li Feng began to give more information about the Bai Clan. As far as he was concerned, even offending the Bai Clan would be worth it if he could be Bai Xiaochun’s follower.\n Although he had served at the Bai Clan as a vassal, he had never noticed Bai Hao during that time. After all, Bai Hao was only in early Foundation Establishment, and wasn’t considered an outstanding member of the clan. It would only be natural for Li Feng, a master necromancer, to ignore him.\n Bai Xiaochun’s mind spun as he considered the matter for a long moment. Finally, he gritted his teeth and thought, “I might not succeed in the end, but I should at least give it a shot. After all, I do have my demigod pagoda.... Even if my identity gets exposed, I shouldn’t be in too much danger.” \n At the same time, his anger toward Mistress Red-Dust smoldered. After all, if it weren’t for her, he wouldn’t need to get deva souls to step into the Nascent Soul stage.\n “It’s all the fault of that shrew Mistress Red-Dust. Once I’m awesome enough, I’ll definitely teach her a lesson! And the same with Chen Hetian!” Finally, he made his decision, and formally agreed to let Li Feng be his follower. With that, the three of them flew off in the direction of the Bai Clan.\n Along the way, Bai Xiaochun reviewed the bone slips he had found in Bai Hao’s bag of holding, and also thought about the circumstances surrounding Bai Hao’s death. Obviously, returning to the clan as Bai Hao would probably cause something of a stir.\n “Very well, Bai Hao. If I get a chance, I’ll figure out who’s responsible for your death and get revenge!”\n A few days later, they were closing in on the Bai Clan. Obviously, it wouldn’t do to take Li Feng and Zhou Yixing with him, so at a certain point he stopped and arranged for them to stay in the vicinity and work on their cultivation, ready to come the instant he called for them.\n He dropped his cultivation base from the great circle of Core Formation down to where Bai Hao’s had been, in early Foundation Establishment, and also flew a bit slower than before, doing everything he could to make himself look like Bai Hao should. He even put a taciturn expression onto his face.\n “Bai Hao was a bastard son, so the clan probably doesn’t care about him very much....” It only made sense to him that Bai Hao wouldn’t look very happy to come back to the clan after almost being killed.\n This area was considered the outskirts of Giant Ghost City, and all of it was controlled by the Bai Clan. It was a huge area, populated to the point where it was essentially a huge city.\n The city was violet, and almost looked like it had been imprinted into the earth itself from above. The city wall was formed by statues of dragonsnakes, which formed together to make four huge gates, the entrances to the clan!\n There was clearly a spell formation at work, which emanated terrifying pressure that both filled the Bai Clan and made it stand out among the lands that surrounded it.\n As soon as Bai Xiaochun entered the vicinity of the city, he felt eyes on him from all directions, although no one looked at him for too long.\n As for the power of the spell formation, it caused his heart to tremble. “The Bai Clan... definitely has a deva patriarch!”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-582","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
