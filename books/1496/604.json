{"id":45921,"no":604,"title":"Chapter 602: Take What I Want","content":"Very few people on the mountain had even noticed the change in Bai Xiaochun. Most everyone else was transfixed by Bai Qi as he dealt with the final restrictive spell at the summit, and were looking on with jealousy, frustration, and countless other emotions. “This is really unfair!” “That’s right. Even if Bai Qi were more of a chosen than he already is, he shouldn’t have been able to make it to the top of the mountain that easily. I don’t care if he is in the great circle of Core Formation!” “Hmph! I was watching him, and from what I could tell, he knew how to deal with those restrictive spells before he even got to them! It was too easy for him!” “Come on, don’t you realize what\u0027s going on? Not even Bai Lei put up a fight. It’s obvious that the ancestral land was opened just for Bai Qi! The leadership already decided to give him the deva soul, that way he can get his five elements deva beast souls and form his nascent soul!!” Most angry of all were the people from the auxiliary bloodlines, whereas the people from the direct bloodline seemed very pleased. They even went so far as to rebuke anyone they heard saying anything they didn’t like. “Bai Qi is the qilin son of our clan! It’s the will of heaven and earth that he gets that deva soul!” All sorts of talk could be heard on the mountain. Meanwhile, people on the outside were also dealing with all sorts of thoughts and feelings. No one outside had noticed Bai Xiaochun yet either. Bai Qi was currently the main focus in the ancestral land, and was like a blazing sun that drew all attention. As he went about dismantling the restrictive spell, discussions could also be heard near the stone gate. “So, the deva soul is going to Bai Qi....” “I\u0027d guessed that it would be him. Not that we would have had a say in it anyway.” “It was definitely set up ahead of time. Nobody else even had a chance. But then again, nobody is on the same level as Bai Qi.” As people discussed the matter, the faces of the clan elders were all expressionless. After all, they had all known ahead of time that this would happen. Even the grand elders from the Hall of Justice and the Hall of Corrections weren’t reacting. None of them qualified to argue with the decisions made by the patriarch, and furthermore, Bai Qi really was the cream of the crop of the current generation. Most excited of all was Madam Cai. She was physically shaking from excitement, and could barely breathe straight as she watched the image of Bai Qi on the screen. “My Qi’er is definitely the qilin son of the Bai Clan,” she thought. “That deva soul was prepared just for him! How dare that little son of a bitch Bai Hao try to compete with my Qi’er. What gives him the right?! Everything was prepared for Qi’er. All we did was take his research notes and arrange for him to be killed! How dare he fight back against us!! “You just wait, Bai Hao. As soon as my Qi’er gets that deva soul, you’ll definitely be dead, you son of a bitch!!” Madam Cai laughed out loud, sounding completely elated. The clan chief no longer looked grim like he usually did. As the sun shone down onto his smiling face, he seemed warm, happy, and proud. However, even as Bai Qi attempted to break through the restrictive spell, people outside of the ancestral land finally noticed that Bai Xiaochun was thrumming with a shocking energy. In fact, that energy was so shocking, so indescribably powerful, that it caused the screen to distort. The fact that the energy seemed to be interfering with heaven and earth caused looks of shock to appear on the faces of many of the clan members. “That’s....” “Bai Hao!” “What’s going on? What’s happening with Bai Hao!?!?” Eyes widened as more people looked over. The clan elders seemed shocked, as did Madam Cai and the clan chief. All of them subconsciously looked over at Bai Xiaochun! It was in that very moment that Bai Xiaochun threw his head back and laughed uproariously. Then, he looked at the fifth young lady and said, “Alright, Fifth Young Lady. If you have the guts to ask for everything, then I have the guts to get it for you!” Only moments ago, Bai Xiaochun had come to realize that although the fifth young lady seemed soft, she was actually a lot more tough and tenacious than he’d realized. If he took all the treasures on the mountain and gave them to her, it wouldn’t be easy for her to keep them. However, she obviously knew that, and yet was still confident enough to say what she had. In that case, Bai Xiaochun wasn’t going to disagree with her. As he laughed, his hair whipped about in the air, and his cultivation base began to rise rapidly. In almost the blink of an eye, he went from Early Foundation Establishment to the mid stage, the late stage, and then the great circle. Within a few earth-shaking moments, he had become a Core Formation cultivator. Wind screamed around him, shaking the entire ancestral mountain, rising up into the sky and even provoking lightning. All of the clan members on the mountain were completely shaken, and began to cry out in shock. “Th-this... this....” “Heavens, what’s happening!?!?” They weren’t the only ones to react in such a way. Even more shocked was Bai Lei, who felt like his mind was being struck by lightning. His face turned completely ashen, and he staggered backward, trembling the entire time. Because he was closer to what was happening, he felt like Bai Hao had become a raging ocean, while he was a little rowboat being tossed about by the waves. It was almost impossible for him to comprehend what was going on, and he felt like he might get wiped out of existence at any moment. “I... I can’t believe he\u0027s so strong!!!” Bai Lei’s mind was devolving into a blank, and he was already sweating profusely. As for the fifth young lady, she was panting; she had already come to the realization that Bai Hao had been hiding the true level of his cultivation base, and to see him explode to higher levels of power right in front of her caused her eyes to shine brightly. It took only the briefest of moments for Bai Xiaochun’s cultivation base to reach the shocking level of the great circle of Core Formation! And then, it went a bit further, into the pseudo-Nascent Soul stage! With his current cultivation base, Bai Xiaochun looked like an immortal devil, his eyes shining like the stars, his fleshly body power surging. Although he was slender and had a fair face, he seemed like he contained the explosive power of a divine dragon! Then, even as he continued to laugh, he lifted his right foot. The moment had come to vent all of the negative feelings that had cropped up in his heart because of Bai Hao’s tragic fate. All of his discontent with the Bai Clan was about to erupt! Without any hesitation, he stomped his foot down onto the surface of the ancestral mountain! Instantly, a sound like heavenly thunder filled the air. The entire mountain began to shake, provoking cries of alarm from all of the clan members standing on it. Bai Xiaochun stomped down with the full power of his own cultivation base, as well as his three clones’. It was a force that surpassed the Core Formation stage, and also contained control power, which seemed capable of rocking the entire mountain! And that was not to mention his fleshly body power, which was in the great circle of the third level of the Undying Live Forever Technique. He was already at the point of making contact with the third shackle, giving him access to monstrous force! All of the frustration he had been keeping suppressed in the Bai Clan was unleashed in the stomp of his foot, which shook the ancestral mountain so violently that a crevice opened up on it! Cracking sounds could be heard as, in the blink of an eye, the crevice spread out through the entire mountain! Many areas of the mountain even began to completely collapse! To the clan members on the mountain itself, it was like an apocalypse of destruction. Screams and shouts could be heard everywhere, and at the same time, the halos formed by countless restrictive spells were simultaneously destroyed! Moments later, all of the items of good fortune which had been placed into the ancestral land by the Bai Clan were out in the open. Vast amounts of magical items, soul bodies, and soul medicine all appeared, completely unprotected by any restrictive spells!

It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama.","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
