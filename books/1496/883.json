Blinking, he shouted, “No, don’t…! Wait, Wan\u0027er! What are you doing? Aaagh! Don’t tear my clothes off! This is my first time…!”\\n\\n His shrieks were particularly exaggerated, and although he seemed to be struggling to fight against the effects of the pink mist, he obviously wasn’t putting much heart into it.\\n\\n The main thing he was afraid of was that Song Junwan would figure out what had occurred between him and Mistress Red-Dust back in the Wildlands…. Suddenly, he screamed with renewed fervor.\\n\\n “Stop it! At least let me get ready….” Piteous wails erupted from within the mist, but clearly, he was just putting on a show. The look in his eyes and the way he held himself actually made it easier for Song Junwan to tear his clothing off….\\n\\n Panting, Song Junwan said, “Shut up! This is exactly what I want! Your first time!”\\n\\n Along with her words came the brutal sound of clothing being torn. At that point, Bai Xiaochun’s shrieking ceased, and a sharp intake of breath could be heard from Song Junwan. And then… the mist began to seethe and burn.\\n\\n Two hours went by….\\n\\n When the mist vanished, Song Junwan seemed to be thinking clearly again. Her clothing was back on, but a deep flush covered her face. Next to her was Bai Xiaochun, an expression on his face that was a mixture of pride and tenderness. Arms wrapped around his knees, he looked off into space.\\n\\n The expression on his face was very pleasing to Song Junwan. In fact, if he had looked any other way, she might have become suspicious. Adjusting her clothing, she smiled and said, “Alright, hurry up and put some clothes on. Don’t worry, I’m not going to abandon you now or something.”\\n\\n The truth was that Bai Xiaochun’s daze was only thirty percent real and seventy percent a show…. He didn’t dare to do anything other than look like he was in a daze. Otherwise, Song Junwan might have guessed at the truth. In his mind, he was comparing Song Junwan and Mistress Red-Dust.\\n\\n In the end, he decided that both of them were perfect. One was wild and barbaric, the other was shockingly beautiful. The truth was that all sorts of different flowers had their upsides.\\n\\n However, he kept a strange look on his face, and after a bit of thought, even shivered a few times to make it really seem like it was his first time….\\n\\n Inside, he was sighing endlessly at the fact that, twice in a row, he had been trapped by an Aphrodisiac Pill….\\n\\n “Is the Aphrodisiac Pill the bane of my existence?! If there was a first time, and a second time, does that mean there will be a third, fourth, and fifth time…?” Although it was somewhat of a dismal thought, for some reason… he actually looked forward to it….\\n\\n Song Junwan was completely pleased by the strange look on Bai Xiaochun’s face. Patting her bag of holding, she produced a new set of clothing, which she handed over to him. Considering the blank look that was on his face, she offered a few tender words and then helped him get dressed.\\n\\n Of course, although the blank look remained on his face, inside he was feeling wonderful, and couldn’t help but marvel at the wonderful act he was putting on.\\n\\n At the same time, he kept wondering why he was so outstanding. If he weren’t, why would Mistress Red-Dust and Song Junwan have both intentionally used an Aphrodisiac Pill to bewitch him?\\n\\n “I can’t blame them. I can only blame my outstanding nature.” Having reached this point in his train of thought, he sighed helplessly at his amazing qualities.\\n\\n Feeling prouder of herself than ever, Song Junwan rubbed his shoulder and offered some more tender words. It was at that point that Bai Xiaochun finally broached the subject of Hou Xiaomei.\\n\\n Earlier, Song Junwan might have answered such questions, but would have felt somewhat uncomfortable doing so. Now, considering how pleased she was, she didn’t mind at all, and explained everything she knew.\\n\\n Several thousand cultivators from the River-Defying Sect had gone to the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect to participate in the selection process. In total, there were tens of thousands from the eastern Heavenspan River who had participated in the trial.\\n\\n Song Junwan hadn’t passed the test. And in fact, of all the other River-Defying Sect disciples, only Ghostfang had succeeded. However, during the talent portion of the assessment, Hou Xiaomei was shown to be particularly suited to the divine abilities and magical techniques of Heavenspan Island.\\n\\n Therefore, both she and Ghostfang had proceeded on to Heavenspan Island. Actually, Hou Xiaomei wasn’t the only one to receive such treatment. According to Song Junwan, there were a total of eight other disciples who had been selected because of how well they conformed to certain legacy magical techniques.\\n\\n When Bai Xiaochun heard that Hou Xiaomei was one of several disciples to go to Heavenspan Island, he felt a bit better about the situation. And he felt even better when Song Junwan pointed out that such arrangements had been made many times throughout history. In fact, it had been this way for thousands of years. Furthermore, most cultivators who served as special guards on Heavenspan Island eventually returned to their home sects.\\n\\n “Maybe I\u0027m just worrying too much….”\\n\\n Having received all of this information, he looked over at Song Junwan and noticed how exhausted she seemed. In fact, both of them seemed to be a bit out of sorts…. Clearing his throat, he offered some words of departure.\\n\\n Before leaving, though, he gave her a deva soul!\\n\\n He had never been able to collect another full set of five deva souls. However, even only one of the souls he had could be considered a precious treasure in the Heavenspan River region.\\n\\n One of those souls could be traded into a sect for a set of deva beast souls, and would be of immense help to Song Junwan when it came time for her to create her nascent soul. Furthermore, if she succeeded, she would have a nascent soul that put her on the same level as the chosen from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect!\\n\\n It would definitely be beneficial to her cultivation!\\n\\n Song Junwan was completely shaken by the gift. It was the first time in her life that she had ever laid hands on something so precious. She looked up at Bai Xiaochun, the entrancement in her eyes growing deeper. She didn’t try to persuade him to stay. However, when he turned to leave, she walked over and embraced him.\\n\\n The feeling of her soft curves pressing into him caused Bai Xiaochun’s heart to start racing again. Although he had just gone through an incredible experience, being held by her immediately caused him to recall everything that had just happened. Worried that he might reveal some information he didn’t want to, he mumbled a few words and then hurried away.\\n\\n Outside of the immortal\u0027s cave, he felt his heart still pounding, and muttered a few more times about how much of a vixen she was. Sighing, he realized that he really had changed….\\n\\n This time, he wasn’t nearly as depressed as he had been the last time.\\n\\n “Wait. No. No way! I can’t be like this. Oh, and I definitely can’t let Hou Xiaomei find out!” Having reached this point in his train of thought, he suddenly started wondering if Hou Xiaomei had somehow come across an Aphrodisiac Pill. If not, then perhaps he would need to figure out a way to make sure she did….\\n\\n “Hold on. No! How could Bai Xiaochun be a person like that!?” After all, he was a very pure person, and therefore, such thinking didn’t befit him.\\n\\n Eventually, he looked up into the sky and sighed.\\n\\n “Why? Why am I so outstanding!?”\\n\\n Sighing, he made his way to the immortal\u0027s cave that had been prepared for him. Once inside, he sat down cross-legged and got his thoughts under control.\\n\\n “It\u0027s hard to say where the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect stands when it comes to the River-Defying Sect. To be safe… I really need to become a deva as soon as possible….” At that point, his eyes lit up with determination. “I need to conjure a twenty-one colored flame!”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-881","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. \\n","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
