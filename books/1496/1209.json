He seemed completely confident, almost as if he had forgotten that he actually only had fourteen shots left! Although he had used one beam to punish Bai Xiaochi, after Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo woke up, his supply had returned to fifteen shots. And yet, at this moment, he almost seemed to believe that his supply was endless! Facing the Vile-Emperor and his red sun, he waved his hand out in front of him! “Fear not, Lord Bai has lots of Archaean Luminescence left!” He reached out with divine sense to connect to the fan, whereupon… a second beam of Archaean Luminescence appeared! But that wasn’t all! A third beam also materialized, both of which contained the battle prowess of an archaean as they shot toward the red sun! A tremor passed through the Vile-Emperor, and his mind began to spin. Not even he could have guessed that Bai Xiaochun would do something like this, and it immediately caused him to question his previous suppositions. The two beams of Archaean Luminescence smashed into the red sun, causing shocking vibrations to spread out as two massive craters appeared! If the Archaean Luminescence could punch a hole into the arm of a sovereign, then obviously it could damage this sun created by the Vile-Emperor! Although the two craters that resulted did not punch all the way through the sun, they were still shocking!! Furthermore, the sun shuddered a bit, and both its heat and light were significantly reduced, as well as its speed. At the same time, the backlash caused the Vile-Emperor to actually cough up a mouthful of blood! “How is this even possible!?!?” the Vile-Emperor thought incredulously, glaring at Bai Xiaochun, his chest heaving. Although he knew that Bai Xiaochun was the owner of the fan, he still couldn’t imagine how, in only half of a sixty-year-cycle, he could have possibly changed so much! Before, he had just barely managed to fight back against an illusory attack, and was someone the Vile-Emperor could have killed without expending very much effort. But now… the Vile-Emperor had to admit that Bai Xiaochun, with his sovereign fist strike, definitely had battle prowess equivalent to a half-archaean! Of course, the Vile-Emperor could still win against power like that. But there was more…. Bai Xiaochun had his Archaean Luminescence, which contained the true battle prowess of an archaean. That changed everything, and although the Vile-Emperor didn’t want to admit it, in his gut he knew… that he couldn’t do anything about Bai Xiaochun!! His only chance would be to pay a huge price and fight a battle to the death. Then he might end up severely wounded, which could be an acceptable outcome if he were the only archaean in the Eternal Immortal Domains. But he wasn’t! The Saint-Emperor would be watching very closely to see how things played out! Obviously, the Saint-Emperor would love for the Vile-Emperor to pay a steep price to kill Bai Xiaochun. If the Vile-Emperor were severely wounded in the process, then after the dust settled, the Saint-Emperor could swoop in and kill him! Perhaps the Vile-Emperor might end up escaping, but even if he did, the Saint-Emperor would surely declare all-out war. The Saint-Emperor Dynasty would gain more immortal domains, and the Vile-Emperor would be forced to go into hiding to recover, and would lose the upper hand in the overarching conflict. Such thoughts ran through his mind in the briefest of moments. And although he wasn’t very pleased about it, he knew that he had to suppress his frustration! “Dammit! Don’t tell me I just have to let things drop?!” he thought, feeling a bit suffocated. Eyes flickering with cold light, he contemplated whether it might actually be worth it to get injured in order to kill Bai Xiaochun. “There’s no way he can use that Archaean Luminescence forever. There has to be a limit. In that case… I may be able to figure out a way to kill him without getting hurt, and at the same time, scare the Saint-Emperor enough that he won’t interfere!” Convinced that this was the best way to do things, the Vile-Emperor blurred into motion, his eyes flickering with even more killing intent than before as he performed a double-handed incantation gesture. As a result, he began to merge with the red sun! The fading sun flared back to life! This was the Vile-Emperor’s ultimate state, in which he was the red sun, and the red sun was him! As he accelerated, blistering heat rippled out, causing the land to wither and the air to distort. Many people screamed in pain as they were instantly transformed into dried-up corpses! “I\u0027m willing to bet… that you only have a few shots of Archaean Luminescence!” Howling, the Vile-Emperor drew closer and closer to Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun’s eyes narrowed at the sight of the Vile-Emperor’s stubbornness. He knew that he only had twelve shots left, and that he absolutely, positively could not reveal his true limits. “So,” he said loudly, “you saw through my little ruse. Well done! Hang on for just a bit longer. I won’t try to fool you any longer. This is my last shot!” With that, he pointed up at the sky, causing another beam of Archaean Luminescence to descend. However, he didn’t stop there; he actually summoned a total of five beams! As one beam after another appeared, the Vile-Emperor’s heart began to pound crazily. Although he was sure that Bai Xiaochun could not use his Archaean Luminescence forever… it almost seemed like he could! No matter how he analyzed the situation, it seemed completely impossible for Bai Xiaochun to be doing this!! Even more shocking was how, only a moment later, Bai Xiaochun flicked his sleeve casually, stuck his chin up, and said, “Okay, here comes my last shot!” Rumbling sounds filled the air as two more beams of Archaean Luminescence materialized. Those two were the straw that broke the camel’s back. Heart pounding, the Vile-Emperor said, “Just how many do you have?!?!” If Bai Xiaochun had refused to say anything, it would have been much easier to accept the situation. But considering how he was acting, the Vile-Emperor couldn’t help but be both enraged and confused. He tried to dodge out of the way, but his red sun form was too large. As the Archaean Luminescence slammed into it, it shuddered violently on the verge of collapse. As for the Vile-Emperor, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he was forced to dispel the sun and fall back in retreat. He really had no choice. He had been injured several times, and much to his frustration and madness, had no way of knowing how many times Bai Xiaochun could unleash that particular attack. The Saint-Emperor was watching all of this happen, and was also shocked. At one point, he lifted his foot up as if to spring into action, but then put it back down, unsure of what to do. Bai Xiaochun, on the other hand, was sighing in relief. He knew that he only had nine shots left, and didn’t want to push things too far. Hovering there in midair, he clasped his hands behind his back, sighed, and said, “I only have one shot left now….” “One shot my ass!!” the Vile-Emperor shot back. Suddenly spinning in place, he shot back toward Bai Xiaochun, eyes blazing with killing intent! And yet, even as he closed in, Bai Xiaochun let out a shout, causing one… two… three beams of Archaean Luminescence to descend like lightning bolts! At that point, all of the Vile-Emperor’s suspicions were blown away. Howling, he fell back, but was still hit by the beams of light. As he was, Bai Xiaochun yet again spoke out in a loud voice, “Okay, I\u0027m really out now….” “Bai Xiaochun!!” the Vile-Emperor shouted, yet again spinning and heading back aggressively. But that was when… three more beams of Archaean Luminescence fell from the sky! Blood sprayed out of the Vile-Emperor’s mouth as he threw his head back and roared furiously. At that point, he simply decided to leave, no longer willing to test Bai Xiaochun any longer. Even as he began to fade away, he heard Bai Xiaochun’s treacherous voice one more time. “Okay, I\u0027m really out now. Rest at ease….” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1207","bookId":1496,"book":{"id":1496,"title":"A Will Eternal","description":"A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen\u0027s other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen\u0027s previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama.","cover":"http://cunovel.com/img/AWE.jpg","type":"Wuxia","link":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal","creation":"Sep 10, 2019 12:39:40 AM","modification":"Sep 25, 2019 12:28:09 AM"}}
