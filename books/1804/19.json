The man\u0027s obvious bewilderment brought a glint of amusement to Clayton\u0027s eyes. \"Correct. And negotiate the lease in the name Westland, not Westmoreland. Once my staff and I are installed, we will keep to ourselves as much as possible, and I will pass myself off as a new neighbor, Clayton Westland.\" \"Surely not to Miss Stone?\" Matthew said. \"Especially to Miss Stone,\" Clayton chuckled. Chapter Eight ONE MONTH LATER, WlLSON, THE GILBERTS\u0027 DIGNIFIED BUTLER, padded down the hall to Lord Gilbert\u0027s study and handed him the mail. On the top of the stack was a letter from England. Five minutes later, the door to Lord Gilbert\u0027s study was flung open and he bellowed at the butler, \"Have Lady Gilbert join me here at once! Don\u0027t dawdle, man. Hurry, I said,\" he called after the harassed servant who was already sprinting down the hall, his black coattails flapping behind him. \"What is it, Edward?\" Anne said, flying into her husband\u0027s study in answer to his urgent summons. \"This!\" said Edward, thrusting the letter from Martin Stone at her. Anne looked from her husband\u0027s white face to the signature on the single sheet of paper in her hand. \"He\u0027s sent for Whitney?\" she guessed in a tortured voice. \"He says he will reimburse me for all her expenses during the last four years, as soon as he receives an accounting from me,\" Edward said furiously. \"And he\u0027s sent a blasted fortune along with this letter, for her to spend \u0027on clothing and trinkets\u0027 before she returns. Who the devil does he think he is? He hasn\u0027t sent a penny to cover her expenses in all this time. That bastard! He\u0027ll get no accounting from me, and I will see that she returns in style. He can shove his money precisely-\" \"Whitney is going home,\" Anne whispered brokenly, sinking into a chair. \"I-I had deluded myself into thinking he\u0027d forgotten about her.\" She brightened. \"I have it! Wr-write Martin at once and hint of a match with Nicolas DuVille. That would buy us time.\" \"Read the letter, Madame. He says as plainly and as rudely as can be that she\u0027s to leave here in one month to the day, without excuses or delay.\" Anne did as he said, her eyes moving dully over the lines. \"He says she is to spend the remaining time saying farewell to her friends and visiting her favorite modistes and milliners.\" She tried to look encouraged. \"He must have changed in the last four years-he\u0027d never have thought of Whitney requiring time to order her clothing here in Paris, where fashions are so far advanced. Edward,\" she said, \"do you suppose that he could have received an offer for Whitney from that young man she adored so much when she was a girl?\" \"He\u0027s received no marriage proposal,\" Edward snapped, \"or he would have been gloating about it in this damned letter, thinking he had succeeded where he believes we\u0027ve failed.\" He turned his back to his wife. \"You may as well tell her now and have done with it. I\u0027ll be up in a bit.\" Whitney stood numbly, trying to assimilate the news she thought she\u0027d longed to hear. \"I-I\u0027m happy to be going home, Aunt Anne,\" she managed finally. \"It\u0027s just that. . .\" Her voice trailed off. Happy to be going home? Terrified of going home! Terrified that now the chance was being given to her, she might fail. It was one thing to languish in Paris, surrounded by men who flattered and admired her, another to go home and try to make Paul see her with their eyes. There was her father to cope with, and Margaret Merryton, and everyone\u0027s mothers, who had always made her feel lower than an insect. But here, there was Aunt Anne and Uncle Edward who loved her and laughed with her, who made her life warm and happy. Her aunt turned her face to the windows, but Whitney saw a tear trickle down her cheek. She bit her lip; if Aunt Anne had misgivings about her returning to England, then surely it was too soon to go. She wasn\u0027t ready to confront everyone yet. She turned to the mirror, hoping to find some reassurance in her appearance. In Paris, gentlemen said she was beautiful. Would Paul think so? The mirror promptly quashed that idea! It was happening already, she realized in panic. Before she even left, she could feel her facade falling away. She was plain, awkward, too tall-even her fingers were fidgeting nervously as they used to do. And there--on the bridge of her nose-she could still see faint traces of the freckles she loathed. Oh the devil! Whitney thought, suddenly impatient with herself. Freckles do not reappear before one\u0027s eyes; fingers do not have to fidget, and she would not, would not, begin inventorying her faults and shortcomings as she had in the old days! Her stomach ceased its frantic churning. Inside of her, something else began to blossom: hope. Her lips curved into a soft smile. I am going home, she thought. I am going home to Paul-home to show everyone how much I\u0027ve really changed. I am actually going home! But going home also meant leaving her beloved aunt and uncle. She turned away from the mirror and saw her aunt\u0027s shoulders shaking with silent weeping. \"I feel as if I\u0027m being severed in half,\" Anne choked. \"I love you, Aunt Anne,\" Whitney whispered, hot tears rushing to her eyes and streaming down her cheeks. \"I love you so much.\" Aunt Anne opened her arms, and Whitney fled into them, trying to comfort and be comforted. Pausing outside Whitney\u0027s bedroom, Edward squared his shoulders and carefully schooled his desolate features into a fixed, bright smile. Clasping his hands behind his back, he strolled into the room. \"Having a good time, ladies?\" he ventured with forced joviality, glancing from one weeping woman to the other. Two teary, anguished faces gaped at him in utter disbelief. \"Having a good. . . ?\" Anne echoed incredulously. She looked at Whitney and Whitney looked at her. Suddenly they began to giggle, then the giggles burst into great, gusty laughs. \"Yes ... er ... well, good. Glad to see it,\" Edward murmured, bewildered by his ladies\u0027 excessively unstable behavior. Then he cleared his throat. \"We\u0027ll miss you, child. You\u0027ve been a blessing and a joy to us both.\" Whitney\u0027s gaiety fled, and fresh tears stung her eyes. \"Oh Uncle Edward,\" she whispered brokenly, \"I shall never, never love any man as much as I love you.\" To his acute dismay, Edward felt his eyes misting. He opened his arms wide, and his niece came into them. When at last the storm of emotions had passed, the three of them stood looking sheepishly at one another, each clutching a handkerchief. Edward was the first to speak. \"Well now, England isn\u0027t the end of the world, is it?\" \"It-it isn\u0027t exactly next door, either,\" Whitney said, dabbing at her eyes.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/whitney-my-love-westmoreland-saga-2/page-19.html","bookId":1804,"book":{"id":1804,"title":"Whitney, My Love (Westmoreland Saga #2)","description":"Storyline: Fresh from her triumphs in Paris society, Whitney Stone returns to England determined to win the heart of her childhood love.
