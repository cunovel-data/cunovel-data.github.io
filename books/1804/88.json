If everyone, including the servants, was openly gossiping about her \"betrothal\" to Paul, Clayton would certainly hear of it as soon as he returned. He had made it very clear that he wouldn\u0027t tolerate people believing she had ever been betrothed to anyone but him, and Whitney tried to think of some proof she could offer him that none of this was her fault-that she had, in fact, told Paul she wouldn\u0027t marry him, exactly as she had promised Clayton she would.\n He had accepted her word and trusted her to keep it, and Whitney wanted him to believe she had, but the only one who could prove it was Paul, and Paul was in no mood to aid her.\n Whitney bit her lip, concerned with more than just the loss of her honor. Without the incentive of marrying Paul to give her courage, she now felt a deep-rooted, genuine fear of Clayton\u0027s wrath. The more she pondered it, the more convinced she became that the best way to avert certain disaster was to go to London and explain to Clayton what was happening here. He would be far less angry hearing it from her than from strangers, and he would know she wasn\u0027t to blame. After all, if she was truly planning to marry Paul, as the gossip had it, why would she return to London to see Clayton?\n Resolutely, Whitney got up and went down the hall to her aunt\u0027s room. She poured out the entire story, including the gossip about her betrothal to Paul and her abandoned plan to elope. Aunt Anne blanched but she remained silent until Whitney was finished. \"What do you intend to do now?\" she asked then.\n \"I think it would be best if I went to London and stayed with Emily. As soon as I arrive, I\u0027ll notify his grace I\u0027m there, and he\u0027ll naturally come to see me. Then I\u0027U choose exactly the right moment to tell him about the gossip here. I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll care so much about the talk, so long as he believes it isn\u0027t my fault.\"\n \"I\u0027ll come to London with you,\" her aunt instantly volunteered.\n Whitney shook her head. \"I wish you could, but there\u0027s a slim chance that he might return to the village without my having been able to see him in London. If he does, he\u0027ll hear the gossip and undoubtedly come straight here to the house. I need you here to explain and calm him down.\"\n \"What a cheerful prospect,\" Lady Anne said drily, but she was smiling. \"Very well, I\u0027ll stay here. Now, assuming you reach him in London, what reason will you give him for being there?\"\n Whitney\u0027s smooth forehead knitted into an irritated frown. \"I suppose I\u0027ll have to tell him the truth-that I was afraid he would come back to the village and believe that despite his warning, I hadn\u0027t refused Paul. Although, I find it excessively galling to have to tear off to London like a rabbit frightened of incurring his wrath. That man walked into my life a few months ago, and I\u0027ve been like a puppet obliged to dance to his tune ever since. I think I shall tell him that too!\" Whitney finished mutinously.\n \"While you\u0027re bent on being so honest about your feelings,\" Aunt Anne suggested with a knowing gleam in her eyes, \"why don\u0027t you also tell him that you have developed a sincere affection for him and you are willing now to honor the betrothal contract? It will please him immensely to hear you say it.\"\n Whitney shot up off the sofa as if she\u0027d been scorched. \"I most certainly will not!\" she declared hotly. \"Considering that he never cared whether I wanted to marry him, and has never doubted for a minute that I would marry him, I fail to see why I should flatter his vanity now by professing to want to marry him. Besides, I haven\u0027t made up my mind to marry him.\"\n \"I think you have, darling.\"\n Her aunt\u0027s quiet voice checked Whitney in mid-stride as she headed for the door. \"And if it will make it easier for you to admit your own feelings, I will tell you that, in my opinion, that man loves you with an intensity that would astonish him if he but recognized it-and very likely flatter your vanity.\"\n \"You\u0027re wrong, Aunt Anne,\" Whitney said tonelessly. \"He has never even said he cares for me. I\u0027m a possession he\u0027s acquired, nothing more. Don\u0027t ask me to crawl to him; I have very little pride left as it is, and I won\u0027t sacrifice it to soothe his temper or flatter his ego.\"\n Elizabeth Ashton appeared at the house each afternoon to report her progress, but by the end of the third day, there was still no cause for celebration. Clarissa and Whitney were packing for the next day\u0027s trip to London when Elizabeth trailed into the bedroom, a soldier returning in defeat from a battle that should have been easy for her to win. \"Peter is no nearer declaring himself now than he was ten years ago,\" she said glumly, flopping into a chair.\n Whitney thrust an armload of underclothing into a trunk\n and gazed at Elizabeth in perplexed dismay. \"Are you certain?\"\n \"Positive,\" Elizabeth said morosely. \"I suggested we dine at my house tonight, without my parents, and do you know what he said? He said\"-Elizabeth sighed heavily-\"that he likes dining with my parents.\"\n \"That idiot!\" Whitney burst out irritably. Slowly she began to pace back and forth. \"You may be ready to accept defeat, but I\u0027m not-at least not from Peter Redfern, of all people! That dolt has worshiped you since we were children. What he needs is some sort of motivation to force him into declaring himself without delay.\" Idly, Whitney shoved the fully packed portmanteau out of the way with her foot and frowned at the luggage scattered everywhere around the room. \"I have it!\" she burst out, whirling on Elizabeth with an impetuous, daring gleam in her green eyes that Elizabeth well remembered from days gone by. Terrified, she shrank back into her chair: \"Whitney, whatever you\u0027re thinking, we aren\u0027t going to do it.\"\n \"Oh yes, we are!\" Whitney hooted triumphantly. \"Miss Ashton, I hereby invite you to come to London with me.\"\n \"But I don\u0027t want to go to London,\" Elizabeth sputtered desperately. \"I want Peter.\"\n \"Good, and you\u0027re going to get him tonight. Now repeat after me, \u0027Yes, I will go to London with you.\u0027\"\n \"Yes, I will go to London with you,\" Elizabeth parroted. \"But I don\u0027t want to.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/whitney-my-love-westmoreland-saga-2/page-88.html","bookId":1804,"book":{"id":1804,"title":"Whitney, My Love (Westmoreland Saga #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Fresh from her triumphs in Paris society, Whitney Stone returns to England determined to win the heart of her childhood love.
