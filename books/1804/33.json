{"id":82509,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"\"What?\" Thomas gasped, staring at Westland. \"Are you certain?\"\n \"Positive!\" Whitney said, laughing silently as Thomas turned and walked into the stable. Feeling extremely pleased with herself, Whitney clasped her hands behind her back and strolled over to the white corral fence to stand beside Clayton, \"I\u0027ve arranged for you to ride our very finest horse,\" she told him.\n Clayton studied her bright smile, but his attention was diverted by the sound of a scuffle from within the stable. Two violent oaths from a groom were followed by a yowl of pain, and Dangerous Crossing erupted into the enclosure, flinging one groom against the fence, then kicking savagely at the other.\n \"Isn\u0027t he wonderful?\" Whitney rhapsodized, casting a mirthful sideways glance at her intended victim. At that moment, the horse changed direction, charging for the rail where they stood, then swung around. Whitney jumped back just as his rear feet punched out, exploding against the fence like the crack of a cannon. With a tremor in her voice, she explained, \"He\u0027s ... ah ... very spirited.\"\n \"So I see,\" Clayton agreed, shifting his impassive gaze from the nervous, sweating stallion to Whitney.\n \"If you\u0027re afraid to ride the stallion, simply say so,\" Whitney generously suggested. \"I\u0027m sure we can find you a more suitable mount. . . like Sugar Plum.\" Fighting back her laughter, she nodded sweetly toward the old brood mare who was nibbling contentedly at grass, her belly hanging down, and her backbone sticking up. Clayton followed her gaze, and a look of cold revulsion crossed his features. Instantly, Whitney decided it would be much more satisfying if Clayton Westland had to jog up to the picnickers on the ancient mare. \"Thomas!\" Whitney called, \"Mr. Westland has decided to ride Sugar Plum instead, so-\"\n \"The stallion will do,\" Clayton snapped at Thomas, then he swung his icy gaze on Whitney.\n Defensively, she said, \"Why don\u0027t you just tell me where the picnic is, and I\u0027ll go on ahead.\"\n \"I have no intention of doing that, nor do I intend to gratify your wish to see me lying on the ground under the stallion\u0027s hooves.\" Jerking his head toward Khan, who was being led out of the stable, he said curtly, \"Get on your horse and keep him at the rail out of my way. I\u0027m going to have enough on my hands without having to worry about you.\"\n His arrogant assumption that he could ride the stallion wiped out Whitney\u0027s momentary trace of guilt. She mounted Khan and guided him to the rail at the far end of the enclosure. Transferring Khan\u0027s reins to her teeth, she reached\n up behind her neck, gathered her hair into a fist at her nape and then tugged her scarf loose, using it to tie her hair back.\n Grooms and stablekeeps and three gardeners hurried to the enclosure, positioning themselves along the fence for the best view. Thomas and two grooms held the stallion\u0027s head while Clayton ran his hand along the horse\u0027s sleek neck, speaking quietly to him. The remembered feel of that same hand fondling her breast made Whitney flush with anger.\n Clayton put his foot in the stirrup, then eased up and over, settling slowly, carefully into the saddle, avoiding any sudden movement that might add to the stallion\u0027s alarm. In spite of his caution, Dangerous Crossing snorted and jerked wildly at the men holding him. The last man who had used that particular saddle was shorter than Clayton and, for a moment, it looked to Whitney as if Crossing were going to rid himself of his unwelcome burden while the stirrup leathers were being lengthened.\n Whitney laughed at the way the stallion was turning and twisting about. At any second, she expected Clayton to give up and dismount. Instead he gathered the reins and the grooms turned the stallion loose, then leapt out of the way.\n All Clayton\u0027s attention was concentrated on the nervous, sweating stallion beneath him. \"Easy now,\" he soothed, loosening the reins very slightly. Dangerous Crossing jerked his head furiously, trying to get the bit between his teeth as he danced sideways across the enclosure, threatening first to rear and then trying to get his head down to buck. \"Easy now . . . Easy . . .\" The voice calmed the horse\u0027s ragged nerves; the light contact on his reins held him firmly but not harshly under control.\n Whitney watched in wide-eyed astonishment as the stallion fretted a bit and then smoothed out, easing into a flashy trot across the length of the enclosure. The stallion\u0027s ears were forward, and he looked as if he were almost enjoying himself, proud to be bearing the burden of the tall man atop him- until Clayton brushed the stallion\u0027s flank with the crop, signaling for a canter. Instantly Crossing jerked his head, bunching his hindquarters to buck.\n \"It\u0027s the crop, sir,\" Thomas called happily. \"Drop it- that\u0027s all that\u0027s worrying him now.\"\n For the moment, Whitney dismissed her grievances against the man. She was too She a horsewoman herself to pretend to be unimpressed by what she had just witnessed. Clayton\u0027s expert handling of Dangerous Crossing filled her with admiring respect, and she made no effort to conceal it as the stallion trotted toward her. Her mouth curved into a smile as she started to pay him the tribute he deserved-only to have Clayton slap the crop into her outstretched hand and snap, \"Sorry to disappoint you. Find someone else to play your nursery games with next time.\"\n \"You monster!\" Whitney hissed, raising her arm; the crop sliced the air, missed Clayton\u0027s shoulder, and bit into the stallion\u0027s flank. Raging and violent, the stallion threw himself into the air, broke for the fence as if be were going to crash through it, and at the last possible moment, leapt it instead with the bit in his teeth-completely out of control.\n \"Oh dear God,\" Whitney whispered, watching horse and rider tearing across the rolling landscape. In belated shame, she looked away. The silent punishment she was heaping on herself for her childish attempt at vengeance was reinforced by Thomas, who flung himself across the corral, his face purple with fury. \"Is this what you learned in France-to bring injury to strangers! Is it?\" he roared. \"No one will ever mount that horse again, you little fool!\" He turned and ran for a mount to pursue the stallion.\n It was all Whitney could do not to go after Thomas and explain that she\u0027d intended to hit the rider, not the horse. Never the horse. Off to her distant left, the stallion was rapidly diminishing to a speck on the horizon, and there was no way to tell if the rider was still up. Glancing about her, Whitney saw disapproval on every servant\u0027s face before their eyes slid away from her.\n She couldn\u0027t bear to remain here and suffer their silent accusation. She turned Khan and cantered from the enclosure, but once outside its boundary, she realized she hadn\u0027t any idea where to go. She drew Khan to a halt and hesitated. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/whitney-my-love-westmoreland-saga-2/page-33.html","bookId":1804,"book":{"id":1804,"title":"Whitney, My Love (Westmoreland Saga #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Fresh from her triumphs in Paris society, Whitney Stone returns to England determined to win the heart of her childhood love.
