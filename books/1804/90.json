I had so wanted to ... give Elizabeth a glorious taste of London.\"\n Peter, who was innately good-tempered, glanced with smiling tolerance at his future wife and said in a friendlier voice, \"Since you\u0027re so bent on being with Elizabeth in London, you can shop for her trousseau with her. If her papa accepts me tonight, I expect she\u0027ll want to leave tomorrow, and she has already informed me that she wants you to be a bridesmaid.\"\n Chapter Twenty-three\n UPON ARRIVING AT THE ARCHIBALDS\u0027 TOWNHOUSE, WHTTNEY was greeted by a flustered Emily, her brown hair covered with a kerchief, her cheeks smudged with dirt. \"You look like a chimney sweep,\" Whitney laughed.\n \"You look like a godsend!\" Emily countered, embracing her. \"Can a knight be seated beside an honorable at dinner?\" she burst out desperately.\n Whitney blinked in surprised confusion.\n \"It\u0027s this wretched party,\" Emily explained in the salon after Whitney had taken off her pelisse and Clarissa had been shown to her room. \"Michael\u0027s mama said that I must begin to entertain as suits Michael\u0027s station in life. Have you any idea how much fuss the ton can make over the simple act of sitting down to dinner? Here, just look at what I\u0027ve been going through.\" She went over to a desk and plucked up a seating diagram for the dining tables that evening. It was obvious she had repeatedly scratched out names to rearrange them. \"Can you, or can you not, seat an honorable beside a knight? Michael\u0027s mama lent me a dozen books on etiquette, but they\u0027re so filled with contradictions and exceptions to rules that I know less now than I did before I read them.\"\n Whitney scanned the seating diagram and then promptly slid into the sabre-legged chair at the desk. Dipping the quill into the inkpot, she deftly rearranged the guests, then sat back and flashed a sunny smile at her stunned friend. \"Thanks to Aunt Anne\u0027s training, 1 can do that when there are nobles from five different countries present,\" she said.\n Emily sank down on the sofa, her eyes still clouded with worry. \"This is our first formal party and Michael\u0027s mama is going to be here watching every move I make. She\u0027s a stickler for formalities. She was less than pleased when her son married A Nobody, and I want more than anything to show her I can have the most perfect, grandest party she\u0027s ever attended!\"\n Whitney, who had been racking her brain for some excuse to see Clayton other than the obvious one, slowly began to smile with delight. Turning back to the desk, she picked up the quill and wrote his name and title in the proper place on the seating diagram. \"This should make you the hostess of the year,\" she announced proudly, handing the diagram to Emily. \"And it will also make your mother-in-law positively envious!\"\n \"The Duke of Claymore,\" Emily gasped. \"But he\u0027d think me the most presumptuous person in the world. Besides, he\u0027d not come-none of our guests is his social equal, despite their titles.\"\n \"He\u0027ll come,\" Whitney assured her. \"Give me a spare invitation and a sheet of paper.\" After a moment\u0027s thought, Whitney wrote to Clayton and explained that she had come to London to visit Emily, and that she hoped very much that he would join her at the party. She enclosed the invitation and gave it to one of the Archibalds\u0027 footmen with instructions to take it to his grace\u0027s secretary, Mr. Hudgins, in Upper Brook Street and to tell Mr. Hudgins that the note was from Miss Stone-which was how Clayton had told her to reach him if she wanted him to come back early.\n The footman returned a short time later with the information that the duke had gone to his brother\u0027s country home, and would be back in London early the next day-Saturday.\n Emily looked simultaneously relieved and crestfallen. \"He\u0027ll be too weary to come to the party tomorrow night,\" she sighed. \"He\u0027ll be here,\" Whitney said with smiling certainty.\n After dinner, Emily tried to open the subject of Paul, and then the Duke of Claymore, but Whitney said very gently, and very firmly, that she didn\u0027t want to discuss either of them just yet. To take the sting out of her refusal to confide in her best friend, Whitney then regaled her with an hilarious account of how she\u0027d coerced poor Peter into offering for Elizabeth. \"Elizabeth and Peter, along with their parents, and Margaret and Mrs. Merryton, all left the village this morning when I did,\" she finished gaily. \"They have come here to shop for Elizabeth\u0027s trousseau.\"\n \"If anyone had told me a few years ago that you would someday be Elizabeth\u0027s bridesmaid, I\u0027d have accused them of being deranged!\" Emily said with a laugh.\n \"I think Elizabeth means to ask you to be her matron of honor,\" Whitney said. \"The wedding is going to take place here in London, since most of Elizabeth and Peter\u0027s relatives live here.\"\n Not until Saturday afternoon did Whitney allow herself to dwell on her forthcoming confrontation with Clayton tonight. She and Clarissa spent the morning doing errands for Emily, and on the way back, Whitney asked the Archibalds\u0027 driver to turn into the park and stop. She left Clarissa in the open carriage and wandered along the path between the neatly tended beds of chrysanthemums.\n She had told Aunt Anne that Clayton didn\u0027t care for her, but she knew that wasn\u0027t entirely true. He had said he \"wanted\" her, which must mean he desired her. Whitney sat down on the park bench, a faint blush staining her cheeks as she thought of his lips moving warmly on hers and his hands caressing her body, molding her to his masculine frame.\n She thought about the times they had been together, beginning with the first time she\u0027d seen him in England. He\u0027d been standing beside the stream with his shoulders propped against the sycamore, watching her sunning her bare legs. He had already been betrothed to her that day, and she had virtually ordered him oft her property. She felt a surge of righteous indignation when she recalled the way he had used the crop on her tender backside, but it dwindled away when she thought about what she\u0027d done to deserve it. A smile touched her lips as she recalled the night they bad played chess at his house, and her flush deepened as she remembered the stormy passion of his kisses before he took her home.\n Clayton desired her. And he was very proud of her-she had seen that at the Rutherfords\u0027 ball. He didn\u0027t love her, of course, but he did care for her. He cared enough about her to be hurt by the dreadful things she\u0027d said to him that day beside the pavilion. Tenderness welled in her heart as she remembered how furiously he\u0027d rejected her kiss until he finally lost control and his arms went around her, crushing her to him. And she remembered how desolate she\u0027d felt when she believed they were saying goodbye forever. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/whitney-my-love-westmoreland-saga-2/page-90.html","bookId":1804,"book":{"id":1804,"title":"Whitney, My Love (Westmoreland Saga #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Fresh from her triumphs in Paris society, Whitney Stone returns to England determined to win the heart of her childhood love.
