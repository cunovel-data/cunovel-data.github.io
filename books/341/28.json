{"id":42655,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. A BUSINESS JOURNEY.","content":"We must now carry forward the story two years. It has been a profitable time for Julius. His excellent natural abilities, stimulated by ambition, have advanced him very considerably in the education which comes from books, while the hours spent in labor on the farm have strengthened his muscles, and developed his figure, so that he presents a strong contrast to the undersized and slender boy who came from the city streets in Mr. O’Connor’s company. The effort of generous diet also may be seen in his improved looks. He would now be regarded as quite a good-looking boy, though he privately considers himself entitled to the more dignified appellation of a young man. I am glad to be able to record that in other ways also he has improved. As a street boy, he was not wholly free from the errors common to his class. Now he has a regard for truth, and Mr. Taylor has come to have implicit confidence in his word. He has even come to feel a paternal interest in the once neglected waif, and treats him in all respects like a son. Little Carrie, too, calls him Brother Julius, and probably feels as much affection for him as if he were her own brother. Thus happily situated, Julius is not troubled as to his real parentage. There is a mystery attending his origin, which he will probably never be able to solve. But he is content to regard Mr. and Mrs. Taylor as his parents, since they have allowed him to do so, and will always be known by the name of Julius Taylor. Of course he has not forgotten his old associates, Jack Morgan and Marlowe. About two years after his arrival in Brookville a paragraph was copied into the county paper from the New York Herald, recording the daring attempts of these two criminals to escape from the prison at Sing Sing. Jack Morgan was caught and brought back, but Marlowe managed to make good his escape. “I suppose,” thought Julius, “Jack was too fat. He couldn’t get over the ground as fast as Marlowe.” In this he was correct. Jack Morgan’s size and clumsiness had interfered with his escape, while Marlowe, who was not so incumbered, got away. “Marlowe would be glad to know where I am,” said our hero to himself. “He’d like to punish me for getting him caught. But he isn’t likely to find me out here. And even if he did, I think I can take care of myself better than I could when he knew me.” Julius surveyed his figure in the glass complacently as he said this. He was five feet eight inches in height, and weighed one hundred and fifty pounds. His arm was powerful; and though he could not contend on equal terms with the tall burglar, he felt that the time would soon come when he could do so. “I wonder if he’d know me now,” thought our hero. This question was soon to be solved, though Julius did not know it. In the month of October Mr. Taylor proposed to Julius to set out on a collecting tour, among the towns in the neighborhood. “I have claims against a dozen persons,” he said, “which ought to be presented and paid. At present, however, it is not convenient for me to leave home. If you will take my place, it will be quite a relief.” “There is nothing I should like better,” said Julius, elated at the prospect of a journey. “I thought you might like it,” said Mr. Taylor. “I am glad you feel sufficient confidence in me to send me,” said our hero. “You have given me reason to confide in you,” said Mr. Taylor, quietly. “You will judge of the extent of my confidence when I say that the bills which I shall give you to collect amount to a thousand dollars, or, perhaps, a little more.” “I will bring back every cent,” said Julius, promptly. “Every cent you succeed in collecting. I have no doubt of it. The only caution I have to give you is, to guard against being robbed. If it is supposed that you have a considerable sum of money, you might be in danger of having it stolen.” “It’ll take a smart thief to get it away from me,” said Julius, confidently. “I didn’t live fifteen years in the streets of New York for nothing. When do you want me to start?” “To-morrow morning. I shall give you the horse and buggy, and we will plan the order of your journey to-night. You will stop at hotels, and expend whatever is needful. I will ask you only to keep an account of your expenses, to be submitted to me on your return.” “Very well, sir. How long do you expect me to be gone?” “That will depend on how much success you meet with. I should think a week might be sufficient. If you find it necessary to stay longer, do so; but let me know from time to time what progress you make in your mission.” “Yes, sir, I’ll write to you every day.” There are few boys of seventeen who would not have experienced pleasure in such an expedition. To have the command of a horse and buggy, to drive from town to town, putting up at hotels by night, would to most be a pleasant prospect. But Julius thoroughly understood that, however pleasant it might be, the motive of his journey was business; and he resolved to exert himself to the utmost in the interests of his guardian and benefactor.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2985/82301.html","bookId":341,"book":{"id":341,"title":"Julius, The Street Boy or Out West","description":"简介： Where are you goin, Julius?
