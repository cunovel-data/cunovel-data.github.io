{"id":16651,"no":23,"title":"THE CITY","content":"You tell yourself: I’ll be gone To some other land, some other sea, To a city lovelier far than this Could ever have been or hoped to be — Where every step now tightens the noose: A heart in a body buried and out of use: How long, how long must I be here Confined among these dreary purlieus Of the common mind? Wherever now I look Black ruins of my life rise into view. So many years have I been here Spending and squandering, and nothing gained. There’s no new land, my friend, no New sea; for the city will follow you, In the same streets you’ll wander endlessly, The same mental suburbs slip from youth to age, In the same house go white at last — The city is a cage. No other places, always this Your earthly landfall, and no ship exists To take you from yourself. Ah! don’t you see Just as you’ve ruined your life in this One plot of ground you’ve ruined its worth Everywhere now — over the whole earth? THE GOD ABANDONS ANTONY When suddenly at darkest midnight heard, The invisible company passing, the clear voices, Ravishing music of invisible choirs — Your fortunes having failed you now, Hopes gone aground, a lifetime of desires Turned into smoke. Ah! do not agonize At what is past deceiving But like a man long since prepared With courage say your last good-byes To Alexandria as she is leaving. Do not be tricked and never say It was a dream or that your ears misled, Leave cowards their entreaties and complaints, Let all such useless hopes as these be shed, And like a man long since prepared, Deliberately, with pride, with resignation Befitting you and worthy of such a city Turn to the open window and look down To drink past all deceiving Your last dark rapture from the mystical throng And say farewell, farewell to Alexandria leaving","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2015/57467.html","bookId":638,"book":{"id":638,"title":"The Alexandria Quartet 亚历山大四部曲","description":"简介： 伟大的现代巴洛克风格小说，使中产阶级得以亲近地中海。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/12/13-31-30-67-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:04 AM"}}
