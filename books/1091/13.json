{"id":24099,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER II CHEAPSIDE","content":"It was a great day at the Doctor\u0027s post office when Cheapside, the London sparrow, arrived from Puddleby to look after the city deliveries for Fantippo. The Doctor was eating his lunch of sandwiches at the information desk when the little bird popped his head through the window and said in his cheeky Cockney voice: \"\u0027Ulloa, Doctor, \u0027ere we are again! What ho! The old firm! Who would \u0027ave thought you\u0027d come to this?\" Cheapside was a character. Anyone on seeing him for the first time would probably guess that he spent his life in city streets. His whole expression was different from other birds. In Speedy\u0027s eyes, for instance—though nobody would dream of thinking him stupid—there was an almost noble look of country honesty. But in the eyes of Cheapside, the London Sparrow, there was a saucy, dare-devil expression that seemed to say \"Don\u0027t you think for one moment that you\u0027ll ever get the better of me. I\u0027m a Cockney bird.\" \"Cheapside, the London sparrow\" \"Why, Cheapside!\" cried John Dolittle. \"At last you\u0027ve come. My, but it\u0027s good to see you! Did you have a pleasant journey?\" \"Not bad—not \u0027alf bad,\" said Cheapside, eyeing some crumbs from the Doctor\u0027s lunch which lay upon the desk. \"No storms. Pretty decent travellin\u0027. \u0027Ot? Well, I should say it was \u0027ot. \u0027Ot enough for an \u0027Ottentot!... Quaint place you \u0027ave \u0027ere—sort of a barge?\" By this time all the animals had heard Cheapside arriving and they came rushing in to see the traveler and to hear the news of Puddleby and England. \"How is the old horse in the stable?\" asked John Dolittle. \"Pretty spry,\" said Cheapside. \"Course \u0027e ain\u0027t as young as \u0027e used to be. But \u0027e\u0027s lively enough for an old \u0027un. \u0027E asked me to bring you a bunch of crimson ramblers—just bloomin\u0027 over the stable door, they was. But I says to \u0027im, I says, \u0027What d\u0027yer take me for, an omnibus?\u0027 Fancy a feller at my time of life carrying a bunch of roses all the way down the Atlantic! Folks would think I was goin\u0027 to a weddin\u0027 at the South Pole.\" \"Gracious, Cheapside!\" said the Doctor, laughing. \"It makes me quite homesick for England to hear your Cockney chirp.\" \"And me, too,\" sighed Jip. \"Were there many rats in the woodshed, Cheapside?\" \"\u0027Undreds of them,\" said the sparrow—\"as big as rabbits. And that uppish you\u0027d think they owned the place!\" \"I\u0027ll soon settle them, when I get back,\" said Jip. \"I hope we go soon.\" \"How does the garden look, Cheapside?\" asked the Doctor. \"A1,\" said the sparrow. \"Weeds in the paths, o\u0027 course. But the iris under the kitchen window looked something lovely, they did.\" \"Anything new in London?\" asked the white mouse who was also city bred. \"Yes,\" said Cheapside. \"There\u0027s always something doing in good old London. They\u0027ve got a new kind of cab that goes on two wheels instead of four. A man called \u0027Ansom invented it. Much faster than the old \u0027ackneys they are. You see \u0027em everywhere. And there\u0027s a new greengrocer\u0027s shop near the Royal Exchange.\" \"I\u0027m going to have a greengrocer\u0027s shop of my own when I grow up,\" murmured Gub-Gub, \"—in England where they grow good vegetables—I\u0027m awfully tired of Africa—and then I\u0027ll watch the new vegetables coming into season all the year round.\" \"He\u0027s always talking about that,\" said Too-Too. \"Such an ambition in life to have—to run a greengrocer\u0027s shop!\" \"Ah, England!\" cried Gub-Gub sentimentally. \"What is there more beautiful in life than the heart of a young lettuce in the Spring?\" \"\u0027Ark at \u0027im,\" said Cheapside, raising his eyebrows. \"Ain\u0027t \u0027e the poetical porker? Why don\u0027t you write a bunch of sonnets to the Skunk-Kissed-Cabbages of Louisiana, Mr. Bacon?\" \"Well, now, look here, Cheapside,\" said the Doctor. \"We want you to get these city deliveries straightened out for us in the town of Fantippo. Our post birds are having great difficulty finding the right houses to take letters to. You\u0027re a city-bird, born and bred. Do you think you can help us?\" \"I\u0027ll see what I can do for you, Doc,\" said the Sparrow, \"after I\u0027ve taken a look around this \u0027eathen town of yours. But first I want a bath. I\u0027m all heat up from flying under a broiling sun. Ain\u0027t you got no puddles round here for a bird to take a bath in?\" \"No, this isn\u0027t puddly climate,\" said the Doctor. \"You\u0027re not in England, you know. But I\u0027ll bring you my shaving mug and you can take a bath in that.\" \"Mind, you wash the soap out first, Doc,\" chirped the Sparrow, \"it gets into my eyes.\" The next day after Cheapside had had a good sleep to rest up from his long journey the Doctor took the London sparrow to show him around the town of Fantippo. \"Well, Doc,\" said Cheapside after they had seen the sights, \"as a town I don\u0027t think much of it—really, I don\u0027t. It\u0027s big. I\u0027ll say that for it. I \u0027ad no idea they \u0027ad towns as big as this in Africa. But the streets is so narrow! I can see why they don\u0027t \u0027ave no cabs \u0027ere—\u0027ardly room for a goat to pass, let alone a four-wheeler. And as for the \u0027ouses, they seem to be made of the insides of old mattresses. The first thing we\u0027ll \u0027ave to do is to make old King Cocoanut tell \u0027is subjects to put door knockers on their doors. What is \u0027ome without a door knocker, I\u0027d like to know? Of course, your postmen can\u0027t deliver the letters, when they\u0027ve no knockers to knock with.\" \"I\u0027ll attend to that,\" said the Doctor. \"I\u0027ll see the King about it this afternoon.\" \"And then, they\u0027ve got no letter boxes in the doors,\" said Cheapside. \"There ought to be slots made to poke the letters in. The only place these bloomin\u0027 \u0027eathens have for a postman to put a letter is down the chimney.\" \"Very well,\" said the Doctor. \"I\u0027ll attend to that, too. Shall I have the letter boxes in the middle of the door, or would you like them on one side?\" \"Put \u0027em on each side of the doors—two to every \u0027ouse,\" said Cheapside. \"What\u0027s that for?\" asked the Doctor. \"That\u0027s a little idea of my own,\" said the Sparrow. \"We\u0027ll \u0027ave one box for the bills and one for sure-enough letters. You see, people are so disappointed when they \u0027ear the postman\u0027s knock and come to the door, expecting to find a nice letter from a friend or news that money\u0027s been left them and all they get is a bill from the tailor. But if we have two boxes on each door, one marked \u0027Bills,\u0027 and the other \u0027Letters,\u0027 the postman can put all the bills in one box and the honest letters in the other. As I said, it\u0027s a little idea of my own. We might as well be real up-to-date. What do you think of it?\" \"I think it\u0027s a splendid notion,\" said the Doctor. \"Then the people need only have one disappointment—when they clear the bill box on the day set for paying their debts.\" \"That\u0027s the idea,\" said Cheapside. \"And tell the post-birds—as soon as we\u0027ve got the knockers on—to knock once for a bill and twice for a letter, so the folks in the \u0027ouse will know whether to come and get the mail or not. Oh, I tell you, we\u0027ll show these poor pagans a thing or two before we\u0027re finished! We\u0027ll \u0027ave a post office in Fantipsy that really is a post office. And, now, \u0027ow about the Christmas boxes, Doctor? Postmen always expect a handsome present around Christmas time, you know.\" \"Well, I\u0027m rather afraid,\" said the Doctor doubtfully, \"that these people don\u0027t celebrate Christmas as a holiday.\" \"Don\u0027t celebrate Christmas!\" cried Cheapside in a shocked voice. \"What a disgraceful scandal! Well, look here, Doctor. You just tell King Cocoa-butter that if \u0027e and \u0027is people don\u0027t celebrate the festive season by giving us post-birds Christmas-boxes there ain\u0027t going to be no mail delivered in Fantipsy from New Year\u0027s to Easter. And you can tell \u0027im I said so. It\u0027s \u0027igh time somebody hen-lightened \u0027is hignorance.\" \"All right,\" said the Doctor, \"I\u0027ll attend to that, too.\" \"Tell \u0027im,\" said Cheapside, \"we\u0027ll expect two lumps of sugar on every doorstep Christmas morning for the post-birds. No sugar, no letters!\" That afternoon the Doctor called upon the King and explained to him the various things that Cheapside wanted. And His Majesty gave in to them, every one. Beautiful brass knockers were screwed on all the doors—light ones, which the birds could easily lift. And very elegant they looked—by far the most up-to-date part of the ramshackle dwellings. The double boxes were also put up, with one place for bills and one for the letters. \"The double letter boxes of Fantippo\" John Dolittle instructed King Koko as well in the meaning of Christmas time, which should be a season for giving gifts. And among the Fantippo people the custom of making presents at Christmas became very general—not only to postmen, but to friends and relatives, too. That is why when, several years after the Doctor had left this country, some missionaries visited that part of Africa, they found to their astonishment that Christmas was celebrated there, although the people were heathens. But they never learned that the custom had been brought about by Cheapside, the cheeky London sparrow. And now very soon Cheapside took entire charge of the city delivery of mails in Fantippo. Of course, as soon as the mail began to get heavy, when the people got the habit of writing more to their friends and relatives, Cheapside could not deal with all the mail himself. So he sent a message by a swallow to get fifty sparrows from the streets of London (who were, like himself, accustomed to city ways), to help him with the delivery of letters. And around the native holiday seasons, the Harvest Moon and the Coming of the Rains, he had to send for fifty more to deal with the extra mail. And if you happened to pass down the main street of Fantippo at nine in the morning or four in the afternoon you would hear the Rat-tat-tat of the post-sparrows, knocking on the doors—Tat-tat, if it was a real letter, and just Rat! if it was a bill. Of course, they could not carry more than one or two letters at a time—being such small birds. But it only took them a moment to fly back to the houseboat for another load, where Too-Too was waiting for them at the \"city\" window with piles of mail, sorted out into boxes marked \"Central,\" \"West Central,\" \"Southwest,\" etc., for the different parts of the town. This was another idea of Cheapside\u0027s, to divide up the city into districts, the same as they did in London, so the mail could be delivered quickly without too much hunting for streets. Cheapside\u0027s help was, indeed, most valuable to the Doctor. The King himself said that the mails were wonderfully managed. The letters were brought regularly and never left at the wrong house. He had only one fault, had Cheapside. And that was being cheeky. Whenever he got into an argument his Cockney swearing was just dreadful. And in spite of the Doctor\u0027s having issued orders time and time again that he expected his post office clerks and mail birds to be strictly polite to the public, Cheapside was always getting into rows—which he usually started himself. One day when King Koko\u0027s pet white peacock came to the Doctor and complained that the Cockney sparrow had made faces at him over the palace wall the Doctor became quite angry and read the City Manager a long lecture. \"The royal peacock complained that Cheapside had made faces at him\" Then Cheapside got together a gang of his tough London sparrow friends and one night they flew into the palace garden and mobbed the white peacock and pulled three feathers out of his beautiful tail. This last piece of rowdyism was too much for John Dolittle and, calling up Cheapside, he discharged him on the spot—though he was very sorry to do it. But when the sparrow went all his London friends went with him and the post office was left with no city birds to attend to the city deliveries. The swallows and other birds tried their hardest to get letters around to the houses properly. But they couldn\u0027t. And before long complaints began to come in from the townspeople. Then the Doctor was sorry and wished he hadn\u0027t discharged Cheapside, who seemed to be the only one who could manage this part of the mails properly. But one day, to the Doctor\u0027s great delight—though he tried hard to look angry—Cheapside strolled into the post office with a straw in the corner of his mouth, looking as though nothing had happened. John Dolittle had thought that he and his friends had gone home to London. But they hadn\u0027t. They knew the Doctor would need them and they had just hung around outside the town. And then the Doctor, after lecturing Cheapside again about politeness, gave him back his job. But the next day the rowdy little sparrow threw a bottle of post office ink over the royal white peacock when he came to the houseboat with the King to take tea. Then the Doctor discharged Cheapside again. In fact, the Doctor used to discharge him for rudeness regularly about once a month. And the city mails always got tied up soon after. But, to the Doctor\u0027s great relief, the City Manager always came back just when the tie-up was at its worst and put things right again. Cheapside was a wonderful bird. But it seemed as though he just couldn\u0027t go a whole month without being rude to somebody. The Doctor said it was in his nature. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2938/80683.html","bookId":1091,"book":{"id":1091,"title":"Doctor Dolittle\u0027s Post Office","description":"简介： Nearly all of the history of Doctor Dolittle\u0027s post office took place when he was returning from a voyage to West Africa.
