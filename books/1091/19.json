{"id":24105,"no":19,"title":"PART III CHAPTER I THE ANIMALS\u0027 MAGAZINE","content":"The next thing I must tell you about is the Prize Story Competition: The fame of the Puddleby fireside-circle, where the Doctor had amused his pets with so many interesting tales, had become quite a famous institution. Too-Too had gossiped about it; Gub-Gub, Jip and the white mouse had boasted of it. (You see, they were always proud that they could say they were part of the great man\u0027s regular household.) And before long, through this new post office of their own, creatures all over the world were speaking of it and discussing it by letter. Next thing, the Doctor began to receive requests for stories by mail. He had become equally famous as an animal doctor, an animal educator and an animal author. From the Far North letters came in by the dozen from polar bears and walruses and foxes asking that he send them some light entertaining reading as well as his medical pamphlets and books of etiquette. The winter nights (weeks and weeks long up there) grew frightfully monotonous, they said, after their own supply of stories had run out—because you couldn\u0027t possibly sleep all the time and something had to be done for amusement on the lonely ice-floes and in the dens and lairs beneath the blizzard-swept snow. For some time the Doctor was kept so busy with more serious things that he was unable to attend to it. But he kept it in mind until he should be able to think out the best way of dealing with the problem. Now his pets, after the post office work got sort of settled and regular, often found it somewhat hard to amuse themselves in the evenings. One night they were all sitting around on the veranda of the houseboat wondering what game they could play when Jip suddenly said: \"I know what we can do—let\u0027s get the Doctor to tell us a story.\" \"Oh, you\u0027ve heard all my stories,\" said the Doctor. \"Why don\u0027t you play Hunt-the-Slipper?\" \"The houseboat isn\u0027t big enough,\" said Dab-Dab. \"Last time we played it Gub-Gub got stuck by the pushmi-pullyu\u0027s horns. You\u0027ve got plenty of stories. Tell us one, Doctor—just a short one.\" \"Well, but what shall I tell you a story about?\" asked John Dolittle. \"About a turnip field,\" said Gub-Gub. \"No, that won\u0027t do,\" said Jip. \"Doctor, why don\u0027t you do what you did sometimes by the fire in Puddleby—turn your pockets out upon the table till you come to something that reminds you of a story—you remember?\" \"All right,\" said the Doctor. \"But——\" And then an idea came to him. \"Look here,\" he said: \"You know I\u0027ve been asked for stories by mail. The creatures around the North Pole wanted some light reading for the long winter nights. I\u0027m going to start an animals\u0027 magazine for them. I\u0027m calling it The Arctic Monthly. It will be sent by mail and be distributed by the Nova Zembla branch office. So far, so good. But the great problem is how to get sufficient stories and pictures and articles and things to fill a monthly magazine—no easy matter. Now listen, if I tell you animals a story to-night, you\u0027ll have to do something to help me with my new magazine. Every night when you want to amuse yourselves we\u0027ll take it in turns to tell a story. That will give us seven stories right away. There will be only one story printed each month—the rest of the magazine will be news of the day, a medical advice column, a babies\u0027 and mothers\u0027 page and odds and ends. Then we\u0027ll have a Prize Story Competition. The readers shall judge which is the best; and when they write to us here and tell us, we\u0027ll give the prize to the winner. What do you say?\" \"What a splendid idea!\" cried Gub-Gub. \"I\u0027ll tell my story to-morrow night. I know a good one. Now go ahead, Doctor.\" Then John Dolittle started turning his trousers pockets out onto the table to try and find something that reminded him of a story. It was certainly a wonderful collection of objects that he brought forth. There were pieces of string and pieces of wire, stub ends of pencils, pocket-knives with the blades broken, coat buttons, boot buttons, a magnifying glass, a compass and a corkscrew. \"It was certainly a wonderful collection of objects\" \"There doesn\u0027t seem to be anything very hopeful there,\" said the Doctor. \"Try in your waistcoat pockets,\" said Too-Too. \"They were always the most interesting. You haven\u0027t turned them out since you left Puddleby. There must be lots in them.\" So the Doctor turned out his waistcoat pockets. These brought forth two watches (one that went and one that didn\u0027t), a measuring tape, a piece of cobbler\u0027s wax, a penny with a hole through it and a clinical thermometer. \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Gub-Gub, pointing to the thermometer. \"That\u0027s for taking people\u0027s temperature with,\" said the Doctor. \"Oh, that reminds me——\" \"Of a story?\" cried Too-Too. \"I knew it would,\" said Jip. \"A thing like that must have a story to it. What\u0027s the name of the story, Doctor?\" \"Well,\" said the Doctor, settling himself back in his chair, \"I think I\u0027ll call this story \u0027The Invalids\u0027 Strike.\u0027\" \"What\u0027s a strike?\" asked Gub-Gub. \"And what on earth is an invalid?\" cried the pushmi-pullyu. \"A strike,\" said the Doctor, \"is when people stop doing their own particular work in order to get somebody else to give them what they want. And an invalid—well, an invalid is a person who is always—er, more or less—ill.\" \"But what kind of work is invalids\u0027 work?\" asked the white mouse. \"Their work is—er, staying—ill,\" said the Doctor. \"Stop asking questions or I\u0027ll never get this story started.\" \"Wait a minute,\" said Gub-Gub. \"My foot\u0027s gone to sleep.\" \"Oh, bother your feet!\" cried Dab-Dab. \"Let the Doctor get on with his story.\" \"Is it a good story?\" asked Gub-Gub. \"Well,\" said the Doctor, \"I\u0027ll tell it, and then you can decide for yourself. Stop fidgeting, now, and let me begin. It\u0027s getting late.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2938/80689.html","bookId":1091,"book":{"id":1091,"title":"Doctor Dolittle\u0027s Post Office","description":"简介： Nearly all of the history of Doctor Dolittle\u0027s post office took place when he was returning from a voyage to West Africa.
