{"id":24109,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER V THE WHITE MOUSE\u0027S STORY","content":"\"Who\u0027s turn is it to give us a story now?\" asked the Doctor, when the supper things were cleared away the following evening. \"I think the white mouse ought to tell us one,\" said Jip. \"Very well,\" said the white mouse. \"I will tell you one of the days of my youth. The Doctor knows this story, but the rest of you have never heard it.\" And smoothing back his white whiskers and curling his pink tail snugly about his small, sleek body, he blinked his eyes twice and began: \"When I was born I was one of seven twins. But all my brothers and sisters were ordinary mouse color and I alone out of the whole family was white. My color worried my mother and father a great deal. They said I was so conspicuous and would certainly, as soon as I left the nest, get caught by the first owl or cat that came along. \"We were city folk, my family were—and proud of it. We lived under the floor of a miller\u0027s shop. Across the street from our place was a butcher\u0027s shop, and next door to us was a dyer\u0027s—where they dyed cloth different colors before it went to the tailor\u0027s to be made into suits. \"Now, when we children grew up big enough to go off for ourselves our parents gave us all sorts of careful instructions about escaping cats and ferrets and weasels and dogs. But over poor me they shook their heads. They really felt that there was not much hope of my leading a peaceful life with white fur that could be seen a mile off. \"Well, they were quite right. My color got me into trouble the first week that I set out to seek my fortune—but not in the way they thought it would. The son of the miller who owned the shop where we lived found me one morning in a bin of oats. \"\u0027Ah, hah!\u0027 he cried. \u0027A white mouse! The very thing I\u0027ve been wanting!\u0027 \"And he caught me in a fishing net and put me in a cage, to keep as a pet. \"I was very sad at first. But after a while I got sort of used to the life. The boy—he was only eight years old—treated me kindly and fed me regularly each day. I grew almost fond of the funny, snub-nosed lad and became so tame that he would let me out of my cage sometimes and I would run up and down his sleeve. But I never got a chance to escape. \"After some months I began to grow weary of the silly life I was leading. And then, too, the wild mice were so mean to me. They used to come around at night and point at me through the wire of my cage, saying: \"\u0027Look at the tame white mouse! Tee-hee-hee! A plaything for children! Good little mousey! Come and have \u0027ims facey washed!\u0027 The stupid little idiots! \"Well, finally I set to work and thought out a clever plan of escape. I gnawed a hole through the wooden floor of my cage and kept it covered with straw, so the boy couldn\u0027t see it. And one night when I heard him safely snoring—he always kept my cage at the head of his bed—I slipped out of the hole and got away. \"I had many adventures with cats. It was winter time and the snow lay thick upon the ground. I started off to explore the world, rejoicing in my liberty. Going around to the back of the house, I passed from the miller\u0027s yard into the dyer\u0027s yard, next door. In the yard was a dyeing shed and I noticed two owls sitting on the top of it in the moonlight. \"Entering the shed, I met a rat, very old and very thin. Said he to me: \"\u0027I am the oldest rat in the town and I know a great deal. But, tell me, why do you come here into the dyeing shed?\u0027 \"\u0027I was looking for food,\u0027 I said. \"The old rat laughed a cracked and quavering laugh, with no joy in it at all. \"The old rat laughed a quavering laugh\" \"\u0027There\u0027s no food here,\u0027 he said, \u0027only dyes of different colors.\u0027 And he pointed to the big dye vats, all in a row, that towered in the half darkness above our heads. \"\u0027Any food there was here I\u0027ve eaten,\u0027 he went on sadly, \u0027and I dare not go out for more because the owls are waiting on the roof. They\u0027d see my dark body against the snow and I\u0027d stand no chance of escape. I am nearly starved.\u0027 And he swayed weakly on his old feet. \u0027But now you\u0027ve come, it\u0027s different. Some good fairy must have sent you to me. I\u0027ve been sitting here for days and nights on end, hoping a white mouse might come along. With your white fur, you understand, the owls can\u0027t see you so well against the snow. That\u0027s what\u0027s called protective coloration. I know all about natural history—I\u0027m very old, you see. That is why you managed to get in here without being caught. Go out now, for pity\u0027s sake, and bring me the first food of any kind that you can find. The owls by night and the cats by day have kept me shut in here since the snow came without a bite to eat. You are only just in time to save my life.\u0027 \"So off I went across the moonlit snow and the blinking owls on the roof of the dyeing shed never spotted me. Against the whiteness I was nearly invisible. I felt quite proud. At last my white fur was coming in handy. \"I found a garbage can and, picking out some bacon rinds, I carried them back to the starving rat. The old fellow was ever so grateful. He ate and ate—my whiskers, how he ate! Finally he said: \"\u0027Ah! Now I feel better.\u0027 \"\u0027You know,\u0027 said I, \u0027I have only just escaped from captivity. I was kept as a pet by a boy. So far being white has only been a great inconvenience to me. The cats could see me so well life wasn\u0027t worth living.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, now, I\u0027ll tell you what we\u0027ll do,\u0027 said he, \u0027you come and live in this dyeing shed with me. It isn\u0027t a bad place—quite warm and snug under the floors, and the foundations are simply riddled with holes and corridors and hiding places. And while the snow is here you can go out and get the food for both of us—because you can\u0027t be seen so well against the snow. And when the Winter is over and the earth is black again I will do the food hunting outside and you can do the staying at home. You see, this is a good place to live in in another way—there is nothing for rats and mice to destroy here, so people don\u0027t bother about you. Other places—like houses and food shops and mills—folks are always setting traps and sending ferrets after you. But no one minds rats living in a dyeing shed, see? Foolish young rats and mice go and live where there\u0027s lots of food. But not for me! I\u0027m a wise one, I am.\u0027 \"Well, we agreed upon this arrangement and for a whole year I lived at the dyer\u0027s with the old wise rat. And we lived high—no mistake! Not a soul ever bothered us. In the winter days I did the foraging and when Summer came my old partner, who knew where to get the choicest foods in town, kept our larder stocked with the daintiest delicacies. Ah, many\u0027s the jolly meal I\u0027ve had under the floor of the dye shed with that old veteran, chuckling in whispers as we heard the dyers overhead mixing the dyes in the great big vats and talking over the news of the town! \"Upstairs where the dye vats stood\" \"But none of us are ever content for long, you know—foolish creatures that we are. And by the time the second Summer was coming I was longing to be a free mouse, to roam the world and all that sort of thing. And then, too, I wanted to get married. Maybe the Spring was getting into my blood. So one night I said to the old rat: \"\u0027Rat,\u0027 I said, \u0027I\u0027m in love. All Winter, every night I went out to gather fodder, I\u0027ve been keeping company with a lady mouse—well-bred she is, with elegant manners. I\u0027ve a mind to settle down and have a family of my own. Now, here comes the Summer again and I\u0027ve got to stay shut up in this miserable shed on account of my beastly color.\u0027 \"The old rat gazed at me thoughtfully a moment and I knew that he was going to say something particularly wise. \"\u0027Young man,\u0027 says he at last, \u0027if you\u0027ve a mind to go I reckon I can\u0027t stop you—foolish young mad-cap though I think you. And how I\u0027ll ever shift for myself after you\u0027ve gone goodness only knows. But, seeing you have been so useful to me this past year and more, I\u0027ll help you.\u0027 \"So saying, he takes me upstairs to where the dye vats stood. It was twilight and the men were gone. But we could see the dim shapes of the big vats towering above our heads. Then he takes a string that lay upon the floor and, scaling up the middle vat, he lets the string down inside. \"\u0027What\u0027s that for?\u0027 I asked. \"\u0027That\u0027s for you to climb out by, after you\u0027ve taken a bath. For you to go abroad in Summer with a coat like yours would mean certain death. So I\u0027m going to dye you black.\u0027 \"\u0027Jumping Cheese!\u0027 I cried. \u0027Dye me black!\u0027 \"\u0027Just that,\u0027 says he. \u0027It\u0027s quite simple. Scale up that middle vat now—on to the edge—and dive right in. Don\u0027t be afraid. There\u0027s a string there for you to climb out by.\u0027 \"Well, I was always adventurous by nature. And, plucking up my courage, I scrambled up the vat, on to the edge of it. It was awful dark and I could just see the dye, glimmering murky and dim, far down inside. \"\u0027Go ahead,\u0027 said the old rat. \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid—and be sure you dip your head and all under.\u0027 \"Well, it took an awful lot of nerve to take that plunge. And if I hadn\u0027t been in love I don\u0027t suppose I\u0027d ever have done it. But I did—I dove right down into the dye. \"I thought I\u0027d never come up again, and even when I did I nearly drowned before I found the string in the dark and scrambled, gasping for breath, out of the vat. \"\u0027Fine!\u0027 says the old rat. \u0027Now run around the shed a few times, so you won\u0027t take a chill. And then go to bed and cover up. In the morning when it\u0027s light you\u0027ll find yourself very different.\u0027 \"Well—tears come to my eyes when I think of it—the next day, when I woke up, expecting to find myself a smart, decent black, I found instead that I had dyed myself a bright and gaudy blue! That stupid old rat had made a mistake in the vats!\" The white mouse paused a moment in his story, as though overcome with emotion. Presently he went on: \"Never have I been so furious with anyone in my life as I was with that old rat. \"\u0027Look! Look what you\u0027ve done to me now!\u0027 I cried. \u0027It isn\u0027t even a navy blue. You\u0027ve made me just hideous!\u0027 \"\u0027I can\u0027t understand it,\u0027 he murmured. \u0027The middle vat used to be the black one, I know. They must have changed them. The blue one was always the one on the left.\u0027 \"\u0027You\u0027re a stupid old duffer!\u0027 I said. And I left the dye shed in great anger and never went back to it again. \"Well, if I had been conspicuous before, now I was a hundred times more so. Against the black earth, or the green grass, or the white snow, or brown floors my loud, sky-blue coat could be seen as plain as a pikestaff. The minute I got outside the shed a cat jumped for me. I gave her the slip and got out into the street. There some wretched children spotted me and, calling to their friends that they had seen a blue mouse, they hunted me along the gutter. At the corner of the street two dogs were fighting. They stopped their fight and joined the chase after me. And very soon I had the whole blessed town at my heels. It was awful. I didn\u0027t get any peace till after night had fallen, and by that time I was so exhausted with running I was ready to drop. \"About midnight I met the lady mouse with whom I was in love, beneath a lamp-post. And, would you believe it? She wouldn\u0027t speak to me! Cut me dead, she did. \"\u0027It was for your sake I got myself into this beastly mess,\u0027 I said, as she stalked by me with her nose in the air. \u0027You\u0027re an ungrateful woman, that\u0027s what you are.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, la, la, la!\u0027 said she, smirking. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t expect any self-respecting person to keep company with a blue mouse, would you?\u0027 \"Later, when I was trying to find a place to sleep, all the mice I met, wherever there was any light at all, made fun of me and pointed at me and jeered. I was nearly in tears. Then I went down to the river, hoping I might wash the dye off and so get white again. That, at least, would be better than the way I was now. But I washed and I swam and I rinsed, all to no purpose. Water made no impression on me. \"So there I sat, shivering on the river bank, in the depths of despair. And presently I saw the sky in the east growing pale and I knew that morning was coming. Daylight! That for me meant more hunting and running and jeering, as soon as the sun should show my ridiculous color. \"And then I came to a very sad decision—probably the saddest decision that a free mouse ever made. Rather than be hunted and jeered at any more I decided that I would sooner be back in a cage, a pet mouse! Yes, there at least I was well treated and well fed by the snub-nosed miller lad. I would go back and be a captive mouse. Was I not spurned by my lady love and jeered at by my friends? Very well then, I would turn my back upon the world and go into captivity. And then my lady love would be sorry—too late! \"So, picking myself up wearily, I started off for the miller\u0027s shop. On the threshold I paused a moment. It was a terrible step I was about to take. I gazed miserably down the street, thinking upon the hardness of life and the sadness of love, and there, coming toward me, with a bandage around his tail, was my own brother! \"As he took a seat beside me on the doorstep I burst into tears and told him all that had happened to me since we left our parents\u0027 home. \"\u0027I am terribly sorry for your bad luck,\u0027 said he when I had ended. \u0027But I\u0027m glad I caught you before you went back into captivity. Because I think I can guide you to a way out of your troubles.\u0027 \"\u0027What way is there?\u0027 I said. \u0027For me life is over!\u0027 \"\u0027Go and see the Doctor,\u0027 said my brother. \"\u0027What doctor?\u0027\" I asked. \"\u0027There is only one Doctor,\u0027 he answered. \u0027You don\u0027t mean to say you\u0027ve never heard of him!\u0027 \"And then he told me all about Doctor Dolittle. This was around the time when the Doctor first began to be famous among the animals. But I, living alone with the old rat at the dyer\u0027s shed, had not heard the news. \"\u0027I\u0027ve just come from the Doctor\u0027s office,\u0027 said my brother. \u0027I got my tail caught in a trap and he bandaged it up for me. He\u0027s a marvelous man—kind and honest. And he talks animals\u0027 language. Go to him and I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll know some way to clean blue dye off a mouse. He knows everything.\u0027 \"So that is how I first came to John Dolittle\u0027s house in Puddleby. The Doctor, when I told my troubles to him, took a very small pair of scissors and cut off all my fur, so I was as bald and as pink as a pig. Then he rubbed me with some special hair restorer for mice—a patent invention of his own. And very soon I grew a brand new coat of fur, as white as snow! \"The Doctor cut off all my fur\" \"And then, hearing what difficulty I had had keeping away from cats, the Doctor gave me a home in his own house—in his own piano, in fact. And no mouse could wish for more than that. He even offered to send for the lady I was in love with, who would, no doubt, think differently about me, now that I was white again. But I said: \"\u0027No, Doctor. Let her be. I\u0027m through with women for good.\u0027\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2938/80693.html","bookId":1091,"book":{"id":1091,"title":"Doctor Dolittle\u0027s Post Office","description":"简介： Nearly all of the history of Doctor Dolittle\u0027s post office took place when he was returning from a voyage to West Africa.
