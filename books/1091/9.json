{"id":24095,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VI NO-MAN\u0027S-LAND","content":"As soon as he was dressed and shaved the Doctor went down to his ship and met the Skimmer. \"I am terribly sorry, Speedy,\" said he, \"to hear what a lot of trouble I have been giving you birds by my delay here. But I really feel that the business of the post office ought to be attended to, you know. It\u0027s in a shocking state—honestly, it is.\" \"I know,\" said Speedy. \"And if we could we would have nested right here in this country to oblige you, and not bothered about going to England this year. It wouldn\u0027t have mattered terribly much to miss one summer in the North. But, you see, we swallows can\u0027t nest very well in trees. We like houses and barns and buildings to nest in.\" \"Couldn\u0027t you use the houses of Fantippo?\" asked the Doctor. \"Not very well,\" said Speedy. \"They\u0027re so small and noisy—with the native children playing around them all day. The eggs and young ones wouldn\u0027t be safe for a minute. And, then, they\u0027re not built right for us—mostly made of grass, the roofs sloping wrong, the eaves too near the ground, and all that. What we like are solid English buildings, where the people don\u0027t shriek and whoop and play drums all day—quiet buildings, like old barns and stables, where, if people come at all, they come in a proper, dignified manner, arriving and leaving at regular hours. We like people, you understand—in their right place. But nesting mother birds must have quiet.\" \"Humph! I see,\" said the Doctor. \"Of course, myself, I rather enjoy the jolliness of these Fantippos. But I can quite see your point. By the way, how would my old ship do? This ought to be quiet enough for you here. There\u0027s nobody living on it now. And, look, it has heaps of cracks and holes and corners in it where you could build your nests. What do you think?\" \"That would be splendid,\" said Speedy—\"if you think you won\u0027t be needing the boat for some weeks. Of course, it would never do if, after we had the nests built and the eggs laid, you were to pull up the anchor and sail away—the young ones would get seasick.\" \"No, of course not,\" said the Doctor. \"But there will be no fear of my leaving for some time yet. You could have the whole ship to yourselves and nobody will disturb you.\" \"All right,\" said Speedy. \"Then I\u0027ll tell the swallows to get on with the nest building right away. But, of course, we\u0027ll go on to England with you when you are ready, to show you the way—and also to teach the young birds how to get there, too. You see, each year\u0027s new birds make their first trip back from England to Africa with us grown ones. They have to make the first journey under our guidance.\" \"Very good,\" said the Doctor. \"Then that settles that. Now I must get back to the post office. The ship is yours. But as soon as the nesting is over come and let me know, because I have a very special idea I want to tell you about.\" So the Doctor\u0027s boat was now turned into a nesting ship for the swallows. Calmly she stood at anchor in the quiet waters of Fantippo harbor, while thousands and thousands of swallows built their nests in her rigging, in her ventilators, in her portholes and in every crack and corner of her. \"Thousands of swallows built their nests in her rigging\" No one went near her and the swallows had her to themselves. And they agreed afterward that they found her the best place for nesting they had ever used. In a very short time the ship presented a curious and extraordinary sight, with the mud nests stuck all over her and birds flying in thousands round her masts, coming and going, building homes and feeding young ones. And the farmers in England that year said the coming winter would be a hard one because the swallows had done their nesting abroad before they arrived and only spent a few weeks of the autumn in the North. And later, after the nesting was all over, there were more than twice as many birds as there were before, of course. And you simply couldn\u0027t get on to the ship for the tons and tons of mud on her. But the parent birds, as soon as the young ones were able to fly, set their children to work clearing up the mess. And all that mud was taken off and dropped into the harbor, piece by piece. And the Doctor\u0027s ship was left in a cleaner state than it had ever been before in its whole life. Now, it happened one day that the Doctor came to the post office, as usual, at nine o\u0027clock in the morning. (He had to get there at that time, because if he didn\u0027t the postmen didn\u0027t start working.) And outside the post office he found Jip, gnawing a bone on the pavement. Something curious about the bone struck the Doctor, who was, of course, being a naturalist, quite a specialist in bones. He asked Jip to let him look at it. \"Why, this is extraordinary!\" said the Doctor, examining the bone with great care. \"I did not know that this class of animals were still to be found in Africa. Where did you get this bone, Jip?\" \"Over in No-Man\u0027s-Land,\" said Jip. \"There are lots of bones there.\" \"And where might No-Man\u0027s-Land be?\" said John Dolittle. \"No-Man\u0027s-Land is that round island just outside the harbor,\" said Jip—\"you know, the one that looks like a plum pudding.\" \"Oh, yes,\" said the Doctor. \"I know the island you mean. It\u0027s only a short distance from the mainland. But I hadn\u0027t heard that that was the name of it. Humph! If you\u0027ll lend me this bone a while, Jip, I think I\u0027ll go to see the King about it.\" So, taking the bone, John Dolittle went off to call on King Koko, and Jip asked if he might come along. They found the King sitting at the palace door, sucking a lollipop—for he, like all the Fantippos, was very fond of sweetmeats. \"Good morning, Your Majesty,\" said the Doctor. \"Do you happen to know what kind of animal this bone belongs to?\" The King examined it, then shook his head. He didn\u0027t know much about bones. \"Maybe it\u0027s a cow\u0027s bone,\" said he. \"Oh, certainly not,\" said John Dolittle. \"No cow ever had a bone like that. That\u0027s a jaw—but not a cow\u0027s jaw. Listen, Your Majesty, would you mind lending me a canoe and some paddlers? I want to go over to visit No-Man\u0027s-Land.\" To the Doctor\u0027s astonishment the King choked on his lollipop and nearly fell over his chair backwards. Then he ran inside the palace and shut the door. \"How extraordinary!\" said John Dolittle, entirely bewildered. \"What ails the man?\" \"Oh, it\u0027s some humbug or other,\" growled Jip. \"They\u0027re a superstitious lot, these natives. Let\u0027s go down to the harbor, Doctor, and try to hire a canoe to take us.\" So they went down to the water\u0027s edge and asked several of the canoesmen to take them over to No-Man\u0027s-Land. But every one they asked got dreadfully frightened and refused to talk when the Doctor told them where he wanted to go. They wouldn\u0027t even let him borrow their canoes to go there by himself. At last they found one very old boatman who loved chatting so much that, although he got terribly scared when John Dolittle mentioned No-Man\u0027s-Land, he finally told the Doctor the reason for all this extraordinary behavior. \"That island,\" said he—\"we don\u0027t even mention its name unless we have to—is the land of Evil Magic. It is called (the old man whispered it so low the Doctor could scarcely hear him) No-Man\u0027s-Land, because no man lives there. No man ever even goes there.\" \"But why?\" asked the Doctor. \"Dragons live there!\" said the old boatman, his eyes wide and staring.—\"Enormous horned dragons, that spit fire and eat men. If you value your life never go near that dreadful island.\" \"But how do you know all this,\" asked the Doctor, \"if nobody has ever been there to see if it\u0027s true or not?\" \"A thousand years ago,\" said the old man, \"when King Kakaboochi ruled over this land, he put his mother-in-law upon that island to live, because she talked too much and he couldn\u0027t bear her around the palace. It was arranged that food should be taken to her every week. But the first week that the men went there in canoes they could find no trace of her. While they were seeking her about the island a dragon suddenly roared out from the bushes and attacked them. They only just escaped with their lives and got back to Fantippo and told King Kakaboochi. A famous wizard was consulted, and he said it must have been the King\u0027s mother-in-law herself who had been changed into a dragon by some magic spell. Since then she has had many children and the island is peopled with dragons—whose food is men! For whenever a canoe approaches, the dragons come down to the shores, breathing flame and destruction. But for many hundreds of years now no man has set foot upon it. That is why it is called—well, you know.\" After he had told this story the old man turned away and busied himself with his canoe, as though he were afraid that the Doctor might again ask him to paddle him to the island. \"Look here, Jip,\" said John Dolittle, \"you said you got this bone from No-Man\u0027s-Land. Did you see any dragons there?\" \"No,\" said Jip. \"I swam out there—just to get cool. It was a hot day yesterday. And then I didn\u0027t go far inland on the island. I found many bones on the beach. And as this one smelled good to me, I picked it up and swam back here with it. I was more interested in the bone and the swim than I was in the island, to tell you the truth.\" \"It\u0027s most extraordinary,\" murmured the Doctor—\"this legend about the island. It makes me more anxious than ever to go there. That bone interests me, too, immensely. I\u0027ve seen only one other like it—and that was in a natural history museum. Do you mind if I keep it, Jip? I\u0027d like to put it in my own museum when I get back to Puddleby.\" \"Not at all,\" said Jip. \"Look here, Doctor, if we can\u0027t raise a canoe, let\u0027s you and I swim out to the island. It\u0027s not over a mile and a half and we\u0027re both good swimmers.\" \"That\u0027s not a bad idea, Jip,\" said the Doctor. \"We\u0027ll go down the shore a way till we\u0027re opposite the island, then we won\u0027t have so far to swim.\" So off they went. And when they had come to the best place on the shore the Doctor took off his clothes and, tying them up in a bundle, he fastened them on his head, with the precious high hat on the top of all. Then he waded into the surf and, with Jip beside him, started swimming for the island. Now this particular stretch of water they were trying to cross happened to be a bad place for swimming. And after about a quarter of an hour Jip and the Doctor felt themselves being carried out to sea in the grip of a powerful current. They tried their hardest to get to the island. But without any success. \"Let yourself drift, Doctor,\" panted Jip. \"Don\u0027t waste your strength fighting the current. Let yourself drift. Even if we\u0027re carried past the island out to sea we can land on the mainland further down the coast, where the current isn\u0027t so strong.\" But the Doctor didn\u0027t answer. And Jip could see from his face that his strength and breath were nearly gone. Then Jip barked his loudest, hoping that possibly Dab-Dab might hear him on the mainland and fly out and bring help. But, of course, they were much too far from the town for anyone to hear. \"Turn back, Jip,\" gasped the Doctor. \"Don\u0027t bother about me. I\u0027ll be all right. Turn back and try and make the shore.\" \"\u0027Turn back, Jip!\u0027 gasped the Doctor\" But Jip had no intention of turning back and leaving the Doctor to drown—though he saw no possible chance of rescue. Presently John Dolittle\u0027s mouth filled with water and he began to splutter and gurgle and Jip was really frightened. But just as the Doctor\u0027s eyes were closing and he seemed too weak to swim another stroke a curious thing happened. Jip felt something come up under the water, right beneath his feet, and lift him and the Doctor slowly out of the sea, like the rising deck of a submarine. Up and up they were lifted, now entirely out of the water. And, gasping and sprawling side by side, they gazed at one another in utter astonishment. \"What is it, Doctor?\" said Jip, staring down at the strange thing, which had now stopped rising and was carrying them like a ship, right across the strong course of the current, in the direction of the island. \"I haven\u0027t the—hah—remotest—hah—idea,\" panted John Dolittle. \"Can it be a whale? No, because the skin isn\u0027t a whale\u0027s. This is fur,\" he said, plucking at the stuff he was sitting on. \"Well, it\u0027s an animal of some kind, isn\u0027t it?\" said Jip. \"But where\u0027s its head?\" and he gazed down the long sloping back that stretched in a flat curve in front of them for a good thirty yards. \"Its head is under water,\" said the Doctor. \"But there\u0027s its tail, look, behind us.\" And turning around Jip saw the longest tail that mortal beast ever had, thrashing the water and driving them toward the island. \"I know!\" cried Jip. \"It\u0027s the dragon! This is King Kakaboochi\u0027s mother-in-law we\u0027re sitting on!\" \"Well anyway thank goodness she rose in time!\" said the Doctor, shaking the water out of his ears. \"I was never so near drowning in my life. I suppose I\u0027d better make myself a little more presentable before she gets her head out of water.\" And, taking down his clothes off his own head, the Doctor smartened up his high hat and dressed himself, while the strange thing that had saved their lives carried them steadily and firmly toward the mysterious island.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2938/80679.html","bookId":1091,"book":{"id":1091,"title":"Doctor Dolittle\u0027s Post Office","description":"简介： Nearly all of the history of Doctor Dolittle\u0027s post office took place when he was returning from a voyage to West Africa.
