And he was some sort of policeman, which explained the gun and the handcuffs. It was while he was using those handcuffs to anchor the intruder to the chest of drawers that he remembered where he’d heard that name before, and realized why the man had looked familiar. He’d been the police commissioner once.\n And how had he found his way to the Nancy Dee? That was something he might ask the man, if he ever came to. And if it wasn’t necessary to kill him right away.\n When the fifth case of bottles had been filled and transferred to the open deck, the Carpenter cast off the lines securing the boat to the pier and maneuvered the Nancy Dee out of the Boat Basin.\n When he was perhaps twenty yards from the nearest of the moored vessels, he cut the engine and let the boat drift. Then, with a match, he lit the little kerosene lantern.\n It was a handy thing, a black sphere eight inches in diameter, flattened on the bottom so it would stay upright, with an adjustable wick at the top. The Carpenter had taken it home from a construction site, where it burned at night to keep trespassers from stumbling into a pit. Now, lit and properly positioned, it greatly simplified the process of lighting the wicks of his firebombs.\n He checked his watch. The hour was right, getting on to three in the morning. The Boat Basin was dark and silent. The party had ended in the large houseboat at the southern end of the basin, and the celebrants, like the other houseboaters, were tucked into their bunks. The owners of the other vessels, who lived elsewhere, were either awake or asleep, but in any event they were not here, and thus were of no concern to the Carpenter.\n Who picked up a gasoline-filled beer bottle, lit its fuse, and lobbed it high in the air, aimed at a ramshackle houseboat some thirty yards distant.\n Before it landed, he had a second bottle in hand.\n H E W A S O N T H E verge of consciousness when the first explosion roused him. He opened his eyes, blinked, registered that he was naked, with his right hand cuffed, the other bracelet hooked to the brass pull of the bottommost drawer in a brassbound chest of drawers.\n He pulled, but the drawer wouldn’t move, and he saw why. The vertical sides of the chest had extensions that were locked in place to keep the drawers from rolling free in uneven seas. By the time he figured this out there had already been a second explosion, and now there was a third.\n And something was burning. He could smell it, and the cabin was unevenly illuminated by the flames.\n What the hell was going on?\n Molotov cocktails, of course. He’d seen the makings earlier, the bottles and rags and cans of gas. He didn’t see them now, but he heard them, exploding one after the other.\n He had to do something. He swung around, braced his feet against the chest of drawers, tried to pull hard enough to break the drawer loose, or yank the handle from the drawer. All he got for his troubles was a sore wrist.\n Where were his clothes?\n He saw them, on the deck at the far end of the cabin. He stretched out full length, levering himself along the deck with his left hand, reaching out with his feet. He caught hold of a piece of clothing, pinning it between his two bare feet, and drew his legs back, trying to reel in the garment. He lost his purchase on it but then regained it and brought it close enough to grab with his free hand, and it was his jacket, and he went through the pockets and didn’t find a thing. His cell phone had been in one of those pockets, and it would have been useful now, but it was gone.\n He stretched out again as far as he could, hurting his right wrist in the process, reaching with his feet, wishing he could see more clearly what he was doing. He caught hold of more cloth, brought it closer, grabbed it with his left hand. His pants, and one pocket held some coins, and what the hell was he supposed to do with them? But another pocket contained his key ring, and he was almost certain he had a handcuff key with him. He held the key ring in front of his face, dropped it, picked it up again, and yes, there was the key, and—\n And the explosions had stopped, he realized that, even as the hatch opened. Scrambling, he tucked the key ring under his backside, kicked the trousers away.\n And lay there, naked and unable to move, as the Carpenter came into the cabin.\n “Y O U ’ R E A W A K E , ” T H E C A R P E N T E R said. “I thought you might be dead.”\n “What were the explosions?”\n “You know what they were.”\n “I saw the bottles, the gasoline. But what was the target?”\n “Oh,” said the Carpenter, surprised at the question. But you couldn’t really see much from where the man was lying. You could see that something was on fire, but wouldn’t know what it was.\n “The boats,” he said.\n “At the Boat Basin? Why would you want to burn them?” The answer was too complicated, and the Carpenter decided not to waste time on it. The man’s trousers lay by his feet, not where he’d left them. He asked the man what he was looking for.\n “My cell phone.”\n The Carpenter pointed to the dresser top. “Right next to the pistol. Mr. Shevlin’s pistol, I was going to shoot you, but there must be something wrong with it.” He drew the revolver from the holster.\n “I hope there’s nothing wrong with yours,” he said, and pointed it at the man, interested in seeing what his reaction would be.\n But there was no reaction. He might as well have been pointing a flower at him. Instead he asked another question. “Why are you doing this? Not just the boats. Everything. Why?” Now that was an interesting question. Maybe he wouldn’t shoot the man, not yet. Maybe it would be interesting to have a conversation with him. He was, after all, an important man. Or had been important, running the police department of the world’s greatest city. He might have interesting things to say. And then he could play a role in the last sacrifice.\n But all of that would have to wait. “I have to move the boat,” he told the man, and, holstering the gun, he made his way back on deck.\n A S S O O N A S T H E hatch closed behind the Carpenter, Buckram retrieved the ring of keys from under his buttock. He rolled over on his side, reaching with his left hand for his imprisoned right wrist, wishing that at least it could have been the other way around, with his less agile left hand immobilized and his right hand free.\n Jesus, he told himself, you can always find something to complain about, can’t you?\n He heard the boat’s engine turn over, heard sirens in the distance as fire engines sped toward the burning Boat Basin. The boat was moving now, away from the raging fire, and toward what?\n The man had set a trap for him and he’d stumbled right into it.\n And he’d be dead right now if the pistol hadn’t misfired. Peter Shevlin’s pistol, according to the Carpenter, and it was supposed to be on top of the chest of drawers, and so was his cell phone, and if only he could get the little key into the little hole, which he couldn’t quite see but it had to be right about there, and—\n The catch released and the cuff fell away from his wrist. He flexed his fingers, willed feeling and circulation back into the hand. The Carpenter had cuffed him too tight, an easy mistake to make, and safer from the Carpenter’s point of view than too loose.\n What he hadn’t done, and Buckram was glad of that, was cuff him correctly, with a cuff on each wrist and his hands behind his back.\n The way Susan had cuffed him, for example.\n But he didn’t have time to think about Susan. Didn’t have time to think. His hand was cramped, as if he’d slept on it, but he’d be able to use it. He got his feet under him, found a handhold, and managed to hoist himself into a standing position. Then his head spun, and he sagged against the chest of drawers. It was all he could do to stay on his feet.\n There was the gun. A .22, from the looks of it, with a three-inch barrel and crosshatched black rubber grips. He went to pick it up but it stayed where it was, resisting him.\n What was holding it, magnets? No, some sort of gripping devices, and if you pulled a little harder it came loose. His right hand had trouble getting a grip on it so he transferred it to his left hand.\n Great. He was armed with a gun that wouldn’t fire, and that his opponent knew wouldn’t fire. And the boat had stopped moving, and the hatch was opening.\n His mobility was his one asset, his foe’s ignorance of it the closest thing he had to an edge. He couldn’t lose it.\n So he got back down onto the floor and slipped his hand into the cold steel cuff. With his left hand he closed the cuff, but just a little way, fastening it loosely enough that he could slip his whole hand right out of it.\n At least he hoped he could.\n T H E C A R P E N T E R H E A D E D T H E Nancy Dee south, just as he’d done when he circled the island. Manhattan was on his left, his port side, and he stayed as close to shore as he conveniently could, past the old railroad yards. The first pier he came to was that of the Sanitation Department, at Fifty-ninth Street, and he stepped away from the tiller and lobbed two of his firebombs onto it. They exploded with a satisfying roar, and he kept heading south, not waiting to see what effect they had.\n More piers, and he had the tiller locked so he didn’t have to tend it, he could go on lighting and hurling his bombs whenever he drew abreast of a likely target. Once he missed, and a bottle, its wick aflame, fell harmlessly into the water, neither breaking nor exploding. No matter—he had plenty of bombs left.\n Ah, and now he’d come to where the cruise ships docked. There was only one berthed there tonight, and it was enormous, rising as high as an apartment house, holding as many people as a small village. He sailed as close to it as he dared, saw an opening on one of the lower decks, and scored a direct hit with one of his firebombs. The explosion echoed, the flames leaped. Oh, they’d probably put it out, they’d probably keep it from spreading, but they’d have their work cut out for them.\n And then Pier Eighty-three, where the Circle Line vessels were berthed.\n And this ship was not so tall, not so forbidding, and there was a vast amount of open deck space. The Carpenter rained bombs on the ship, setting fires everywhere. There’d be no human sacrifice, not unless they had a night watchman aboard, but the ship itself was sacrifice enough. Such a powerful symbol . . .\n Enough for now. The Carpenter headed for open water, set the Nancy Dee on a course to cruise south at a leisurely pace in the middle of the river. And went to check on his passenger.\n T H E C A R P E N T E R S E E M E D I N an exalted state, as if the flames he’d created had borne him aloft. He didn’t seem to notice that the handcuff was loose on Buckram’s wrist, and so far he hadn’t noticed the gun.\n Would the gun fire? According to the Carpenter, it had jammed. That was possible, automatics were notoriously subject to jamming, but it wasn’t the Carpenter’s gun and the Carpenter didn’t know a lot about guns. It was at least as possible that the gun had been loaded with a cartridge clip but, for safety’s sake, didn’t have a round in the chamber. The Carpenter, squeezing the trigger a single time, would have succeeded in chambering a round. If he’d pulled it a second time, he’d have put a bullet in Buckram.\n Well, it was possible. And, unless he could come up with something better, any minute now he’d get to bet his life on it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-town/page-75.html","bookId":2317,"book":{"id":2317,"title":"Small Town","description":"Storyline: \n A beautiful young woman called Marilyn picks up a stranger in a bar and takes him home to her Manhattan apartment.
