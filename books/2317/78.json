The next morning her housekeeper discovers Marilyn\u0027s body. Marilyn\u0027s life and death have far-reaching effects on others, even people she has never met: a charismatic former police commissioner on the verge of a breakdown; a struggling writer; a folk art dealer plumbing the depths of her own fierce sexuality; a lawyer who prefers murder trials because there\u0027s one witness fewer. And in a city reeling from 9/11, an unlikely mass murderer wages a one-man war against everyone. In this gripping, multi-faceted story, Block not only brings to life in brilliant detail the city of New York, but proves he is one of the most talented, innovative and surprising crime writers in the business.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/small-town.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/small-town.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:25 PM"}}
