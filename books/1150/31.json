{"id":16614,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXX MISCELLANEOUS ROMANCE","content":"In addition to the stories that centre round Cuchulain and round Finn there are a number of miscellaneous ones dealing with episodes or characters in Irish history; some are in short groups or minor cycles, but others are completely independent tales. All are built upon lines similar to those which we have been considering, and they are composed for the most part in a mixture of both verse and prose. Some of these sagas deal with pre-Christian times, and others with the early medi?val period. Very few, if any, deal with post-Danish and still fewer with post-Norman subjects. The seventh century was the golden era of the Irish saga, and nothing that the race did in later times improved on it. Out of the hundred and eighty-seven stories whose names are preserved in the Book of Leinster, in a list which must have been, as D\u0027Arbois de Jubainville points out, drawn up in the seventh century, about one hundred and twenty seem to have utterly perished. Of the others—many of which, however, are preserved only in the baldest and most condensed form—some four or five relate to the Fenian Cycle, some eighteen are Red Branch stories, and some eight or nine, mostly preserved in the colourless digests of the Book of Invasions, are mythological. About twenty-one of the others[Pg 388] belong to minor groups, or are miscellaneous single tales. Some of them are of the highest interest and antiquity. Of these the storming of the Bruidhean [Bree-an] or Court of Dá Derga is, after the Táin Bo Chuailgne, probably the oldest and most important saga in the whole range of Irish literature. \\n\\n \\n\\n These two stories substantially dating from the seventh century, and perhaps formed into shape long before that time, are preserved in the oldest miscellaneous MSS. which we possess, and throw more light upon pagan manners, customs, and institutions than perhaps any other.[1] \\n\\n \\n\\n The period in which the Court-of-Dá-Derga story is laid is about coincident with that of the Red Branch Cycle, only it does not deal with Emania, and the Red Branch, but with Leinster, Tara, and the High-king of Erin, who was there resident. The High-king at this time was the celebrated Conairè the \"Great,\" and rightly, if we may believe our Annals, was he so called, for he had been a just, magnanimous, and above all fortunate ruler of all Ireland for fifty years.[2] So just was he, and so strict, that he had sent into banishment a number of lawless and unworthy persons who troubled his[Pg 389] kingdom. Among these were his own five foster brothers whom he was reluctantly compelled to send into exile along with the others. These people all turned to piracy, and plundered the coasts of England, Scotland, and even Ireland, wherever they found an opportunity of making a successful raid upon the unarmed inhabitants.[3] It so happened that the son of the King of Britain, one Ingcel, also of Irish extraction, had been banished by his father for his crimes, and was now making his living in much the same way as the predatory Irishmen. These two parties having met, being drawn together by a fellow-feeling and their common lawlessness, struck up a friendship, and made a league with one another, thus doubling the strength of each. Soon after this the High-king found himself in Clare, called thither to settle, according to his wont, some dispute between rival chiefs. His business ended, he was leisurely taking his way with his retinue back to his royal seat at Tara, when on entering the borders of Meath he beheld the whole country in the direction of his city a sheet of flame and rolling smoke. Terrified at this, and divining that the banished pirates had made a descent on his capital during his absence, he turned aside and took the great road that, leading from Tara to Dublin, passed thence into the heart of Leinster. Pursuing this road the King crossed the Liffey in safety and made for the Bruighean [Bree-an] or Court of Dá Derg on the road close to the river Dothar or Dodder, called ever since Boher-na-breena,[4] the \"road of the Court,\" close to Tallacht, not far from Dublin. This was one of the six great courts of universal hospitality[5] in Erin, and Dá Derg, its master, was delighted and honoured by the visit from the High-king. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 390] \\n\\n \\n\\n The pirates having plundered Tara, took to their vessels, and having laden them with their spoils were now under a favourable breeze running along the sea coast towards the Hill of Howth, when they perceived from afar the King\u0027s company making in their chariots for Dublin along the great high road. One of his own foster brothers was the first to recognise that it was the High-king who was there. He was kept in view and seen at last to enter Dá Derg\u0027s great court of hospitality. The pirates ran their ships ashore to the south of the Liffey, and Ingcel the Briton set off as a spy to examine the court and the number of armed men about it; to see if it might not be possible to surprise and plunder it during the night. On his return he is questioned by his companions as to what he saw, and by this simple device—familiar to all poets from Homer down—we are introduced to the principal characters of his court, and are shown what the retinue of a High-king consisted of in the sixth or seventh century, about which time the saga probably took definite shape on parchment, or in the second or third century if we are to suppose the traits to be more archaic than the composition of the tale. We have here a minute account of the King and the court and the company, with their costumes, insignia, and appearance. We see the King and his sons, his nine pipers or wind-instrument players, his cupbearers, his chief druid-juggler, his three principal charioteers, their nine apprentice charioteers, his hostages the Saxon princes, his equerries and outriders, his three judges, his nine harpers, his three ordinary jugglers, his three cooks, his three poets, his nine guardsmen, and his two private table attendants. We see Dá Derg, the lord of the court, his three doorkeepers, the British outlaws, and the king\u0027s private drink-bearers. Here is the description of the King himself— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I saw there a couch,\u0027[6] continued Ingcel, \u0027and its ornamentation was more beautiful than all the other couches of the Court, it is curtained[Pg 391] round with silver cloth, and the couch itself is richly ornamented. I saw three persons on it. The outside two of them were fair both hair and eyebrows, and their skin whiter than snow. Upon the cheek of each was a beautiful ruddiness. Between them in the middle was a noble champion. He has in his visage the ardour and action of a sovereign, and the wisdom of an historian. The cloak which I saw upon him can be likened only to the mist of a May morning. A different colour and complexion are seen on it each moment, more splendid than the other is each hue. I saw in the cloak in front of him a wheel broach of gold, that reaches from his chin to his waist. Like unto the sheen of burnished gold is the colour of his hair. Of all the human forms of the world that I have seen his is the most splendid.[7] I saw his gold-hilted sword laid down near him. There was the breadth of a man\u0027s hand of the sword exposed out of the scabbard. From that hand\u0027s breadth the man who sits at the far end of the house could see even the smallest object by the light of that sword.[8] More melodious is the melodious sound of that sword than the melodious sounds of the golden pipes which play music in the royal house.... The noble warrior was asleep with his legs upon the lap of one of the men, and his head in the lap of the other. He awoke up afterwards out of his sleep and spake these words— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027\"I have dreamed of danger-crowding phantoms, \\n\\n A host of creeping treacherous enemies, \\n\\n A combat of men beside the Dodder, \\n\\n And early and alone the King of Tara was killed.\"\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This man whom Ingcel had seen was no other than the High-king. \\n\\n \\n\\n The account of the juggler is also curious— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I saw there,\u0027 continued Ingcel, \u0027a large champion in the middle of the house. The blemish of baldness was upon him. Whiter than the cotton of the mountains is every hair that grows upon his head.[Pg 392] He had ear-clasps of gold in his ears and a speckled white cloak upon him. He had nine swords in his hand and nine silvery shields and nine balls of gold. He throws every one of them up into the air and not one falls to the ground, and there is but one of them at a time upon his palm, and like the buzzing of bees on a beautiful day was the motion of each passing the other.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 said Ferrogain [the foster brother], \u0027I recognise him, he is Tulchinne, the Royal druid of the King of Tara; he is Conairè\u0027s juggler,[9] a man of great power is that man.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dá Derg himself is thus described— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I saw another couch there and one man on it, with two pages in front of him, one fair, the other black-haired. The champion himself had red hair and had a red cloak near him. He had crimson cheeks and beautiful deep blue eyes, and had on him a green cloak. He wore also a white under-mantle and collar beautifully interwoven, and a sword with an ivory hilt was in his hand, and he supplies every couch in the Court with ale and food, and he is incessant in attending upon the whole company. Identify that man.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I know that man,\u0027 said he, \u0027that is Da Derg himself. It was by him the Court was built, and since he has taken up residence in it, its doors have never been closed except on the side to which the wind blows; it is to that side only that a door is put. Since he has taken to house-keeping his boiler has never been taken off the fire, but continues ever to boil food for the men of Erin. And the two who are in front of him are two boys, foster sons of his, they are the two sons of the King of Leinster.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Not less interesting is the true Celtic hyperbole in Ingcel\u0027s description of the jesters: \"I saw then three jesters at the fire. They wore three dark grey cloaks, and if all the men of Erin were in one place and though the body of the mother or the father of each man of them were lying dead before him, not one of them could refrain from laughing at them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In the end the pirates decide on making their attack. They marched swiftly and silently across the Dublin mountains, surrounded and surprised the court, slew the High-king caught there, as in a trap, and butchered most of his attendants. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 393] \\n\\n \\n\\n After this tale of Dá Derg come a host of sagas, all calling for a recognition, which with our limited space it is impossible to grant them. Of these one of the most important, though neither the longest nor the most interesting, is the account of the Boromean or Boru tribute, a large fragment of which is preserved in the Book of Leinster, a MS. of about the year 1150. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Tuathal or Toole, called Techtmhar, or the Possessor, was High-king of Ireland, at the close of the first century, he had two handsome daughters, and the King of Leinster asked one of them in marriage and took and brought home to his palace the elder as his wife. This was as it should be, for at that time it was not customary for the younger to be married \"before the face of the elder.\" The Leinster men, however, said to their king that he had left behind the better girl of the two. Nettled at this the King went again to Tara and told Tuathal that his daughter was dead and asked for the other. The High-king then gave him his second daughter, with the courteous assurance \"had I one and fifty daughters they were thine.\" When he brought back the second daughter to his palace in Leinster she, like another Philomela, discovered her sister alive and before her. Both died, one of shame the other of grief. When news of this reached Tara steps were taken to punish the King of Leinster. Connacht and Ulster led a great hosting with 12,000 men into Leinster to plunder it. The High-king too marched from Tara through Maynooth to Naas and encamped there. The Leinstermen were at first successful; they beat the Ultonians and killed their prince; but at last all the invading forces having combined defeated them and slew the bigamist king. They then levied the blood-tax, which was as follows:—Fifteen thousand cows, fifteen thousand swine, fifteen thousand wethers, the same number of mantles, silver chains, and copper cauldrons, together with one great copper reservoir to be set up in Tara\u0027s house itself, in which would fit twelve pigs and twelve kine. In addition to[Pg 394] this they had to pay thirty red-eared cows with calves of the same colour, with halters and spancels of bronze and bosses of gold. \\n\\n \\n\\n The consequences of this unfortunate tribute were to the last degree disastrous for Ireland. The High-kings of Ireland continued for ages to levy it off Leinster, and the Leinstermen continued to resist. The Fenians took part in the conflict, for they followed Finn mac Cúmhail in behalf of the men of Leinster against their own master the High-king. The tribute continued to be levied, off and on, during the reigns of forty kings, whenever Leinster seemed too weak to resist, or whenever the High-king deemed himself strong enough to raise it: until King Finnachta at last remitted it at the close of the seventh century, at the request of St. Molling.[10] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is beyond the testimony of angels, \\n\\n It is beyond the word of recording saints, \\n\\n All the kings of the Gaels \\n\\n That make attack upon Leinster.\"[11] \\n\\n \\n\\n Of course the unfortunate province, thus plundered during generations, lost in some measure its nationality, and no doubt it was partly owing to this that it seemed more ready than any other district to ally itself with the Danes. The great Brian is said to have gained his title of Borumha or Boru through his having reimposed the tribute on Leinster, but though he conquered that province and plundered it, I am aware of no good authority for his actually re-imposing the Boru tribute. \\n\\n \\n\\n Some of the early saints\u0027 lives, too, may be considered as belonging almost as much to historico-romantic as to hagiological literature. From one of these, at least, we must give an extract, so that this voluminous side of Irish literature may not remain unrepresented. Here is a fragment of the life of St. Ceallach [Kal-lach] which is preserved in that ample repository[Pg 395] of ecclesiastical lore the Leabhar Breac, a great vellum manuscript written shortly after the year 1400. The story[12] deals with the dispute between Guairé [Goo-ǎr-yǎ], a well-known king of Connacht, and St. Ceallach, the latter of whom had during his student life left St. Ciaran and his studies, and thus drawn down upon himself the prediction of that great saint that he would die by point of weapon. \\n\\n \\n\\n Guairé having banished Ceallach, against whom his mind had been poisoned by lying tongues, the fugitive took refuge in an island in Loch Con, where he remained for a long time. Guairé, still excited against him through the lies of go-betweens, invited him to a feast with intent to kill him. He refuses however to go. The King\u0027s messengers then requested him to at least allow his four condisciples, the only ones who had remained with him in his solitude, to go with them to the feast, saying that they would bear the king\u0027s messages to him when they returned. \"I will neither prevent them from going nor yet constrain them to go,\" answered Ceallach, the result of which was that the four condisciples returned along with the envoys, and the king was greatly pleased to see them come, and meat and drink, with good welcome, were provided for them. After this the saga proceeds. \\n\\n \\n\\n DEATH OF CEALLACH. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then a banqueting-house apart was set in order for them, and thither for their use the fort\u0027s best liquor was conveyed. On Guairé\u0027s either side were set two of them, and—with an eye to win them that they might leave Ceallach—great gifts were promised to them; all the country of Tirawley, four unmarried women such as themselves should choose out of the province, and, with these, horses and kine, sufficient marriage dowry for their wives (such gifts by covenant to be secured to them), and an adequate equipment of arms to be furnished to each one. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That night they abode there, but, at the morning\u0027s meal, with one accord they consented to kill Ceallach. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 396] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thence they departed to Loch Con, and where they had left the boat they found it, and pulling off they reached Ceallach. They found him with his psalter spread out before him, as he said the psalms, nor did he speak to them. When he had made an end of his psalmody he looked at them, and marked their eyes unsteady in their heads, and clouded with the hue of parricide. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Young men,\u0027 said Ceallach, \u0027ye have an evil aspect, since ye went from me your natures ye have changed, and I perceive in you that for King Guairé\u0027s sake ye have agreed to murder me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never a tittle they denied, and he went on, \u0027An ill design it is, but follow now no longer your own detriment, and from me shall be had gifts, which far beyond all Guairé\u0027s promises shall profit you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They rejoined, \u0027By no means shall we do as thou wouldst have us, Ceallach, seeing that if we acted so, not in all Ireland might we harbour anywhere.\u0027 And, even as they spoke, at Ceallach they drave with their spears in unison; yet he made shift to thrust his psalter in between him and his frock. They stowed him then in the boat amidships, two of themselves in the bow, and so gained a landing-place. Thence they carried him into the great forest and into the dark recesses of the wood. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ceallach said: \u0027This that ye would do I count a wicked work indeed, for in Clonmacnois [if ye spared me] ye might find shelter for ever, or should it please you to resort rather to Bláthmac and to Dermot, sons of Aedh Sláine, who is now King of Ireland [ye would be secure].\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Then Ceallach utters a poem of twenty-four lines.] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027To advise us further in the matter is but idle,\u0027 they retorted, \u0027we will not do it for thee.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Well then,\u0027 he pleaded, \u0027this one night\u0027s respite grant to me for God\u0027s sake.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Loath though we be to concede it, we will yield thee that,\u0027 they said. Then they raised their swords which in their clothes they carried hidden, and at the sight of them a mighty fear took Ceallach. They ransacked the wood until they found a hollow oak having one narrow entrance, and to this Ceallach was committed, they sitting at the hole to watch him till the morning. They were so to the hour of night\u0027s waning end, when drowsy longing came to them, and deep sleep fell on them then. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ceallach, in trouble for his violent death, slept not at all, at which time it was in his power to have fled had it so pleased him, but in his heart he said that it were misbelief in him to moot evasion of the living God\u0027s designs. Moreover, he reflected that even were he so to flee they must overtake him, he being but emaciated and feeble, after the Lent. Morning shone on them now, and he (for[Pg 397] fear to see it and in terror of his death) shut to the door, yet he said: \u0027to shirk God\u0027s judgment is in me a lack of faith, Ciaran, my tutor, having promised me that I must meet this end,\u0027 and as he spoke he flung open the tree\u0027s door. The Raven called then, and the Scallcrow, the Wren, and all the other birds. The Kite of Cluain-Eó\u0027s yew tree came, and the red Wolf of Drum-mic-dar, the deceiver whose lair was by the island\u0027s landing-place. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027My dream of Wednesday\u0027s night last past was true,\u0027 said Ceallach, \u0027that four wild dogs rent me and dragged me through the bracken, and that down a precipice I then fell, nor evermore came up,\u0027 and he uttered this lay:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027HAIL to the Morning, that as a flame falls on the ground; hail to Him, too, that sends her, the Morning many-virtued, ever-new![13] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027O Morning fair, so full of pride, O sister of the brilliant Sun, hail to the beauteous morning that lightest for me my little book! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Thou seest the guest in every dwelling, and shinest on every tribe and kin; hail O thou white-necked beautiful one, here with us now, golden-fair, wonderful! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027My little book with chequered page tells me that my life has not been right. Maelcróin, \u0027t is he whom I do well to fear; he it is who comes to smite me at the last. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027O Scallcrow, and O Scallcrow, small grey-coated, sharp-beaked fowl, the intent of thy desire is apparent to me, no friend art thou to Ceallach. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027O Raven that makest croaking, if hungry thou art now, O bird, depart not from this same homestead until thou eatest a surfeit of my flesh! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Fiercely the Kite of Cluain-Eó\u0027s yew tree will take part in the scramble, the full of his grey talons he will carry off, he will not part from me in kindness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027To the blow [that fells me] the fox that is in the darkling wood will make response at speed, he too in cold and trackless confines shall devour a portion of my flesh and blood. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027The wolf that is in the rath upon the eastern side of Drum-mic-dar, he on a passing visit comes to me, that he may rank as chieftain of the meaner pack. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Upon Wednesday\u0027s night last past I beheld a dream, I saw the wild dogs dragging me together eastward and westward through the russet ferns. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 398] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I beheld a dream, that into a green glen they took me, four there were that bore me thither, but methought, ne\u0027er brought me out again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I beheld a dream, that to their house my condisciples brought me, for me they poured out a drink, and to me did they a drink quaff. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027O tiny Wren most scant of tail, dolefully hast thou piped prophetic lay, surely thou art come to betray me and to curtail my gift of life![14] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027O Maelcróin and O Maelcróin, thou hast resolved upon an unrighteous deed, for ten hundred golden ingots Owen\u0027s son[15] had ne\u0027er consented into thy death! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027O Maelcróin and O Maelcróin, pelf it is that thou hast taken to betray me; for this world\u0027s sake thou hast accepted it, accepted it for the sake of hell! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027All precious things that ever I had, all sleek-coated grey horses, on Maelcróin I would have bestowed them, that he should not do me this treason. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027But Mary\u0027s great Son up above me, thus addresses speech to me, \"Thou must leave earth, thou shalt have heaven; welcome awaits thee, Ceallach.\"\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The saint is then, as soon as the morning had fully risen, taken out of the tree by the four traitors, and put to death. The kite and the wolf and the scallcrow tear his flesh. The remainder of what is really a fine saga describes the hunt for the murderers and their final death at the hands of Ceallach\u0027s brother, who wrested for himself all the territory that Guairé had given them, marries Guairé\u0027s daughter, and is, like Ceallach his brother, finally himself put to death by Guairé\u0027s treachery. \\n\\n \\n\\n It would be quite impossible within the limits of a volume like this to give any adequate study of the evolution of Irish saga. All Irish romances are compositions upon which more or less care had evidently been bestowed, in ancient times, as is evidenced by their being all shot through and through with verse. These verses amount to a considerable portion of the[Pg 399] saga, often to nearly a quarter or even a third of the whole, and Irish versification is usually very elaborate, and not the work of any mere inventor or story-teller, but of a highly-trained technical poet. Very few pieces indeed, and these mostly of the more modern Fenian tales, are written in pure prose. It may be that the reciter of the ancient sagas actually sang these verses, or certainly gave them in a different tone from the prose narrative with which he filled up the gap between them. Whether the same man was both the composer of the verse and the framer of the prose narrative, in each particular story, is a difficult question to answer, but I should think that in most cases, at least in the older saga, incidents had been taken up by the bards and poets as themes for their verses, for perhaps ages before they were brought together by somebody and woven into one complete épopée with a prose intermixture. Dr. Sullivan thought that the Táin Bo Chuailgne was all originally written in verse, and has his own interpretation for the account given in the curious tale, the \"Proceedings of the Great Bardic Institution,\" which tells us that the story was at one time lost, and that the Bardic Association was commanded to search for and recover it. This, according to him, meant that the verses had been lost, and that only a fragmentary form of it had been saved, the gaps being filled with prose. I do not quite know how far this is a probable suggestion, because it would appear to be reversing the processes which produce epic poetry in other literatures. The complete versified epic, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Mahābhārata, are indeed \"the hatch and brood of time,\" embodying not the first but the last results of a long series of national poetry. But to this last result, so close to them, so easily attainable, the Irish never arrived, and hence the various ballads that compose the books of their Red Branch Iliad, or Fenian Odyssey, remains separate to this day, and find their unity, if at all, only by means of a bridge of prose thrown across from poem to poem, by men who were not poets. Had[Pg 400] the internal development of the Irish not been so rudely arrested by the Northmen towards the close of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth century, there is every reason to believe that both the Red Branch and the Fenian Cycle would have undergone a further development and appeared in poems of continuous verse. \\n\\n \\n\\n The poems with which these sagas are intermixed are mostly of two kinds, one kind, speeches in the form of lays, placed in the mouths of the actors, prefaced by such words as \"and he sang,\" \"so that he spake the lay,\" or the like, and the other kind, which occurs less often, is as it were a résumé in verse of what had been just told in prose. In almost every case I should imagine that the narrative poems are the oldest, and of them the prose is not unfrequently, as it were, an explanation and an extension. \\n\\n \\n\\n That the Irish had already made some approach to the construction of a great epic is evident from the way in which they attempted, from a very early date, to group a number of minor sagas, which were evidently independent in their origin, round their great saga the Táin Bo Chuailgne. There are twelve minor tales which the Irish called preface-stories to the Táin and which they worked into it by links, some of which, at least, were evidently forged long after the story which they were wanted to connect. Especially remarkable in this way is the story of the metempsychosis of the two swineherds, whose souls passed into the two bulls who occasioned the great war of the Táin,—a story which is of a distinctly independent origin, and which was forced to do duty as an outlying book, as it were, of the Táin Bo Chuailgne. \\n\\n \\n\\n How very great the number of Irish sagas must have been can be conjectured from the fact that out of the list of one hundred and eighty-seven contained in the Book of Leinster, at least one hundred and twenty have completely disappeared, and of the majority of the remainder we have only brief digests, whilst very many of the ones still preserved, are not[Pg 401] mentioned in the Book of Leinster at all, thus proving that the list given in that manuscript is an imperfect one. A perfect one would have contained at the very least two hundred and fifty prime stories and one hundred secondary ones, for this was the number which every ollamh or chief poet was obliged, by law, to know. The following are some of the best known and most accessible of the earlier sagas which we have not yet mentioned, and which do not belong to any of the greater cycles. This list is drawn up, not according to the age of the texts or the manuscripts which contain them, but according to the date of the events to which they refer, and round which they are constructed. \\n\\n \\n\\n SIXTH CENTURY B.C—The destruction of Dinn Righ, otherwise called the exile of Labhraidh [Lowry] the Mariner. This appears to have been one of a group of lost romances which centred round the children of Ugony the Great,[16] of some of which Keating has given a résumé in his history.[17] \\n\\n \\n\\n SECOND CENTURY B.C—The King of the Leprechanes\u0027 journey to Emania, and how the death of Fergus mac Léide, King of Ulster, was brought about.[18] \\n\\n \\n\\n The triumphs of Congal Clàringneach, which deals with a revolution in the province of Ulster, the death of the King of Tara, and accession of Congal to the throne.[19] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Courtship of Etain by Eochaidh Aireach, King of Ireland, who came to the throne 134 years B.C., according to the \"Four Masters.\"[20] \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 402] \\n\\n \\n\\n FIRST CENTURY B.C.—The Courtship of Crunn\u0027s wife.[21] To this century belong the Red Branch tales. \\n\\n \\n\\n FIRST CENTURY A.D.—The Battle of Ath Comair, fought by the three Finns, brothers of Mève, Queen of Connacht.[22] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Destruction of the Bruidhean [Bree-an] Da Choga, in West Meath, where Cormac Conloingeas, the celebrated son of King Conor mac Nessa, was killed about the year 33.[23] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Revolution of the Aitheach Tuatha, and the Death of Cairbré Cinn-cait by the free clans of Ireland.[24] \\n\\n \\n\\n SECOND CENTURY A.D.—The Death of Eochaidh [Yohy], son of Mairid.[25] \\n\\n \\n\\n The progress of the Deisi from Tara.[26] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Courtship of Moméra, by Owen Mór.[27] (The Fenian tales and tales of Conn of the Hundred Battles, and Cormac mac Art, relate to this and the following century.) \\n\\n \\n\\n THIRD CENTURY.—The Adventures of Teig, son of Cian [Kee-an], son of Oilioll Olum.[28] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Siege of Drom Damhgaire, where Cormac mac Art attempted to lay a double tribute on the two provinces of Munster.[29] \\n\\n \\n\\n FOURTH CENTURY.—The History of the Sons of Eochaidh Muighmheadhon [Mwee-va-on] father of Niall of the Nine Hostages.[30] \\n\\n \\n\\n Death of King Criomhthann [Criv-ban or Criffan] and of Eochaidh Muighmheadhon\u0027s three sons.[31] \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 403] \\n\\n \\n\\n FIFTH CENTURY.—The Expedition or Hosting of Dáithi, the last pagan king of Ireland, who was killed by lightning at the foot of the Alps.[32] \\n\\n \\n\\n SIXTH CENTURY.—Death of Aedh Baclamh.[33] \\n\\n \\n\\n Death of King Diarmuid—he who was cursed by St. Ruadhan.[34] \\n\\n \\n\\n The birth of Aedh [Ae] Sláine,[35] the son of Diarmuid, who came to the throne in 595, according to the \"Four Masters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Wooing of Becfola, in the reign of Aedh Sláine\u0027s son.[36] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Voyage of the Sons of Ua Corra.[37] \\n\\n \\n\\n SEVENTH CENTURY.—The Proceedings of the Great Bardic Institution.[38] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Battle of Moyrath.[39] \\n\\n \\n\\n Suibhne\u0027s Madness, a sequel to the last.[40] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Feast of Dún na ngedh,[41] a preface tale to the Battle of Moyrath. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Voyage of Snedgus and Mac Riaghla.[42] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Love of Dubhlacha for Mongan.[43] \\n\\n \\n\\n The Death of Maelfathartaigh, son of Ronán,[44] who was King of Leinster about the year 610. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 404] \\n\\n \\n\\n EIGHTH CENTURY.—The Voyage of Maelduin.[45] \\n\\n \\n\\n There are very few sagas, indeed, which deal with events posterior to the eighth century, and among those which do (like the stories about Callaghan of Cashel and the Danes, or the Leeching of Cian\u0027s leg, which relates to the reign of Brian Boru, or O\u0027Donnell\u0027s Kerne, which seems as late as the sixteenth century) there are not many whose literary merits stand high. It is evident from this, that, apart from the poets, almost all the genuine literary activity of Ireland centred around the days of her freedom, and embraced a vast range of time, from the mythical De Danann period down to the birth of Christ, and from that to the eighth century, and that after this period and the invasions of the Northmen and Normans, Irish national history produced few subjects stimulating to the national muse; so that the literary production which still continued, though in narrower channels and in feebler volume, looked for inspiration not to contemporaneous history, but to the glories of Tara, the exploits of Finn mac Cúmhail, and the past ages of Irish greatness. \\n\\n \\n\\n The number of sagas still surviving, though many of them are mere skeletons, may be conjectured from the fact that O\u0027Curry, in his manuscript lectures on Irish history, quotes from or alludes to ninety different tales, all of considerable antiquity, whilst M. d\u0027Arbois de Jubainville, in his \"Essai d\u0027un Catalogue de la littérature épique de l\u0027Irlande,\" gives the names of no less than about 540 different pieces. \\n\\n ******** \\n\\n [1] There is an almost complete copy of this saga in the Leabhar na h-Uidhre. Like the Táin Bo Chuailgne, it has never been published in a translation. The language is much harder and more archaic than that of the Táin. I have principally drawn upon O\u0027Curry\u0027s description of it, for I can only guess at the meaning of a great part of the original. Were all Europe searched the scholars who could give an adequate translation of it might be counted on the fingers of both hands—if not of one. \\n\\n \\n\\n [2] According to the \"Four Masters\" he was slain in AM. 5161 [i.e., 43 B.C.], after a reign of seventy years. \"It was in the reign of Conairè,\" the \"Four Masters\" add, \"that the Boyne annually cast its produce ashore at Inver Colpa. Great abundance of nuts were annually found upon the Boyne and the Buais. The cattle were without keeping in Ireland in his reign on account of the greatness of the peace and concord. His reign was not thunder-producing nor stormy. It was little but the trees bent under the greatness of their fruit.\" It is from Conairè the Ernaan tribes were descended. They were driven by the Rudricians, i.e., the Ultonians of the Red Branch, into Munster, and from thence they were driven by the race of Eber [the Mac Carthys, etc. of Munster], into the western islands. \\n\\n \\n\\n [3] It appears to have been partly in order to check raids like this, that the High-kings maintained the Fenians a couple of centuries later, for their chief duty was \"to watch the harbours.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [4] A constant rendezvous for pedestrians and bicyclists from Dublin, not one in ten thousand of whom knows the origin of the name or its history. \\n\\n \\n\\n [5] For a description of another of these courts see above p. 355. \\n\\n \\n\\n [6] Here is the original as given by O\u0027Curry, \"Manners and Customs,\" vol. iii. p. 141. This will show the exceeding difficulty of the language: \"Atcondarc and imdae acas bacáimiu acomthach oldáta imdada in tigi olchena. Seolbrat nairgdidi impe acas cumtaige isin dimdae. Atcondarc triar ninni,\" etc. \\n\\n \\n\\n [7] Keating says that according to some Conairè reigned only 30 years. \\n\\n \\n\\n [8] The allusion appears to be to a bright steel sword in an age of bronze. Perhaps the music referred to means the vibration of the steel when struck. The \"Sword of light\" is a common feature in Gaelic folk-lore. Of course iron was common in Ireland centuries before this time, but the primitive description of Sword of light, transmitted itself from age to age. \\n\\n \\n\\n [9] \"Cleasamhnach,\" from cleas, \"a trick,\" a living word still. \\n\\n \\n\\n [10] See above p. 236. \\n\\n \\n\\n [11] Broccan\u0027s poem in the Book of Leinster translated by O\u0027Neill Russell, in an American periodical. \\n\\n \\n\\n [12] Translated by Standish Hayes O\u0027Grady in \"Silva Gadelica,\" whose vigorous rendering I have closely followed. \\n\\n \\n\\n [13] \"Is mochean in maiten bán \\n\\n No taed for lár, mar lasán, \\n\\n Is mochean do\u0027n té rusfói \\n\\n In maiten buadach bithnói\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [14] Compare the legend of the wren\u0027s having betrayed the Irish to the English, whence the universal pursuit of him made by boys on St. Stephen\u0027s day. \\n\\n \\n\\n [15] Ceallach himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n [16] For him, see above, p. 25. \\n\\n \\n\\n [17] Some account of this saga is given in O\u0027Curry\u0027s MS. Materials, p. 256, and by Keating, p. 253, of O\u0027Mahony\u0027s translation. The entire saga is preserved in the Yellow Book of Lecan. My friend, the late Father James Keegan, made me a translation of another version, which he afterwards published in a St. Louis paper. \\n\\n \\n\\n [18] Translated and edited by Standish Hayes O\u0027Grady, p. 269 of his \"Silva Gadelica.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [19] Only one copy of this tale was known to O\u0027Curry in 205, Hodges and Smith, R. I. A. \\n\\n \\n\\n [20] Edited without a translation by Windisch, in his \"Irische Texte,\" i. p. 117, and referred to at length by O\u0027Curry, \"Manners and Customs,\" vol. ii. pp. 192-4; and summarised and examined by Alfred Nutt, in his \"Voyage of Bran.\" See for this saga, p. 102, above. \\n\\n \\n\\n [21] This was Macha who pronounced the curse on the Ultonians. See above, ch. XXIV note 3. The story is preserved in the Harleian MS. 5280, British Museum. \\n\\n \\n\\n [22] There is a long extract from this battle given by O\u0027Curry in his \"Manners and Customs,\" vol. ii. pp. 261-3. \\n\\n \\n\\n [23] Preserved in the Leabhar na h-Uidhre. See O\u0027Curry, \" Manners and Customs,\" vol. iii. p. 254. There is a full copy in H. 3. 18, T. C., D. \\n\\n \\n\\n [24] In H. 3. 18, T. C., D. See above, p. 27. \\n\\n \\n\\n [25] Edited from the Leabhar na h-Uidhre by O\u0027Beirne Crowe, in the \"Journal of the Royal Irish Historical and Arch?ological Association, 1870,\" and by Standish Hayes O\u0027Grady, \"Silva Gadelica,\" p. 265. \\n\\n \\n\\n [26] See O\u0027Curry, \"Manners and Customs,\" vol. ii. p. 205. I think Kuno Meyer has translated this saga somewhere. See p. 40. \\n\\n \\n\\n [27] Published by O\u0027Curry for the Celtic Society as an appendage to the Battle of Moy Léana. See above, p. 368. \\n\\n \\n\\n [28] Translated by O\u0027Grady, \"Silva Gadelica,\" p. 385, and studied at length by Alfred Nutt, in his \"Voyage of Bran,\" vol. i. p. 201. \\n\\n \\n\\n [29] See O\u0027Curry\u0027s \"Manners and Customs,\" vol. ii. p. 212, and MS. Materials p. 271. This saga is contained at length in the Book of Lismore. \\n\\n \\n\\n [30] Translated in O\u0027Grady\u0027s \"Silva Gadelica,\" p. 368. Ibid., p. 373. \\n\\n \\n\\n [31] Ibid., p. 373. \\n\\n \\n\\n [32] This is one of the tales in the Book of Leinster list. Modern versions are common. \\n\\n \\n\\n [33] See above, ch. XVIII, note 6, translated in \"Silva Gadelica,\" p. 70. \\n\\n \\n\\n [34] Ibid., p. 76. \\n\\n \\n\\n [35] Ibid., p. 88. \\n\\n \\n\\n [36] A short tale, translated in \"Silva Gadelica,\" p. 91. \\n\\n \\n\\n [37] Translated in the \"Revue Celtique.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [38] Published by Professor Connellan for the Ossianic Society in 1860, vol. v. \\n\\n \\n\\n [39] Published by O\u0027Donovan in 1842 for the Irish Arch?ological Society. \\n\\n \\n\\n [40] MS. 60, Hodges and Smith, R. I. A. \\n\\n \\n\\n [41] Published by O\u0027Donovan in 1842 for the Irish Arch?ological Society. \\n\\n \\n\\n [42] Edited, with English translation, by Whitley Stokes, in \"Revue Celtique,\" vol. ix., and translated into modern Irish by Father O\u0027Growney in the \"Gaelic Journal,\" vol. iv. p. 85, from the Yellow Book of Lecan. \\n\\n \\n\\n [43] Edited by Kuno Meyer in \"Voyage of Bran,\" vol. i. p. 58, from the Book of Fermoy. This version seems to have escaped the notice of D\u0027Arbois de Jubainville, who says in his \"Essai d\u0027un Catalogue,\" \"Cette pièce parait perdue.\" I have in my own possession a copy in a MS. written by a scribe named O\u0027Mahon in the last century, which is at least twice as long as that published by Kuno Meyer. \\n\\n \\n\\n [44] The story of an Irish Hippolytus, whose death at his father\u0027s hands is compassed by his step-mother, spret? injuria form?. O\u0027Curry mentions this tale, MS. Materials, p. 277. It is one of the stories in the catalogue of the Book of Leinster, under the head of Tragedies. Another Hippolytus story is that of the death of Comgan, son of the King of the Decies, quoted by O\u0027Curry, \"Manners and Customs,\" vol. ii. p. 204, but I do not know from what MS. \\n\\n \\n\\n [45] Translated, but not very literally, by Joyce in his \"Early Celtic Romances,\" and by M. Lot in D\u0027Arbois de Jubainville\u0027s \"épopée Celtique,\" critically edited by Whitley Stokes in the \"Revue Celtique,\" t. ix. p. 446, and x. pp. 50-95. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703/50197.html","bookId":1150,"book":{"id":1150,"title":"A Literary History of Ireland","description":"简介： The present volume has been styledin order to make it a companion book to other of Mr. Unwin\u0027s publicationsa Literary History of Ireland, but a Literary History of Irish Ireland would be a more correct title, for I have abstained altogether from any...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM"}}
