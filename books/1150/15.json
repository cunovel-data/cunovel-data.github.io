{"id":16598,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV ST. BRIGIT","content":"St. Brigit was—after St. Patrick himself—probably the most noted figure amongst Irish Christians in the fifth century. She must have attained her extraordinary influence through sheer ability and intellectuality, for she appears to have been the daughter of a slave-woman,[1] employed in the mansion of a chief called Dubhthach [Duv-hach, or Duffach], who was himself tenth in descent from Felimidh, the lawgiver monarch of Ireland in the second century. The king\u0027s wife, jealous of her husband\u0027s liking for his slave, threatened him with these words, \"Unless thou sellest yon bondmaid in distant lands I will exact my dowry from thee and I will leave thee,\" and so had her driven from the place and sold to a druid, in whose house her daughter, Dubhthach\u0027s offspring, soon afterwards saw the light. She was thus born into slavery, though not quite a slave; for Dubhthach, in selling the mother into slavery, expressly reserved for himself her offspring, whatever it might be. She must have been, at least, early inured to hardship, as St. Patrick had been. The druid, however, did[Pg 157] not prevent her from being baptized. She grew up to be a girl of exceeding beauty, and many suitors sought her in marriage. She returned to her father\u0027s house, but refused all offers of matrimony. She aroused the jealousy of her father\u0027s wife, as her mother had done before her, and Dubhthach, indignant at her unbounded generosity with his goods, decided upon selling her to the king of North Leinster. Her father\u0027s abortive attempt to get rid of her on this occasion is thus quaintly described in her Irish life in the Leabhar Breac. \n \n \"Thereafter,\" says the life, \"Dubhthach and his consort were minded to sell the holy Brigit into bondage, for Dubhthach liked not his cattle and his wealth to be dealt out to the poor, and that is what Brigit used to do. So Dubhthach fared in his chariot and Brigit along with him. \n \n \"Said Dubhthach to Brigit, \u0027Not for honour or reverence to thee art thou carried in a chariot, but to take thee, to sell thee to grind the quern for Dunlang mac Enda, King of Leinster.\u0027 \n \n \"When they came to the King\u0027s fortress Dubhthach went in to the king, and Brigit remained in her chariot at the fortress door. Dubhthach had left his sword in the chariot near Brigit. A leper came to Brigit to ask an alms. She gave him Dubhthach\u0027s sword. \n \n \"Said Dubhthach to the King, \u0027Wilt thou buy a bondmaid, namely, my daughter?\u0027 says he. \n \n \"Said Dunlang, \u0027Why sellest thou thine own daughter?\u0027 \n \n \"Said Dubhthach, \u0027She stayeth not from selling my wealth and from giving it to the poor.\u0027 \n \n \"Said the King, \u0027Let the maiden come into the fortress.\u0027 \n \n \"Dubhthach went to Brigit, and was enraged against her because she had given his sword to the poor man. \n \n \"When Brigit came into the King\u0027s presence the King said to her, \u0027Since it is thy father\u0027s wealth that thou takest, much more wilt thou take my wealth and my cattle and give them to the poor.\u0027 \n \n \"Said Brigit, \u0027The Son of the Virgin knoweth if I had thy might, with all Leinster, and with all thy wealth, I would give them to the Lord of the Elements.\u0027 \n \n \"Said the King to Dubhthach, \u0027Thou art not fit on either hand to bargain about this maiden, for her merit is higher before God than before men,\u0027 and the King gave Dubhthach an ivory-hilted sword (Claideb dét), et sic liberata est sancta Virgo Brigita a captivititate.[2]\" \n \n [Pg 158] \n \n She at length succeeded in assuming the veil of a nun at the hands of a bishop called Mucaille, along with seven virgin companions. With these she eventually retired into her father\u0027s territory and founded a church at Kildare, beside an ancient oak-tree, which existed till the tenth century, and which gives its name to the spot.[3] Even at this early period Kildare seems to have been a racecourse, and St. Brigit is described in the ancient lives as driving across it in her chariot. \n \n It is remarkable that there is scarcely any mention of St. Brigit in the lives of St. Patrick, although, according to the usual chronology they were partly contemporaries, St. Brigit having become a nun about the year 467, and St. Patrick having lived until 492. About the only mention of her in the saint\u0027s life is that which tells how she once listened to Patrick preaching for three nights and days, and fell asleep, and as she dreamt she saw first white oxen in white corn-fields, and then darker ones took their place, and lastly black oxen. And thereafter, she beheld sheep and swine, and dogs and wolves quarrelling with each other, and upon her waking up, St. Patrick explained her dream as being symbolical of the history of the Irish Church present and future. The life of Brigit herself in the Book of Lismore tells the vision somewhat differently: \n \n \"\u0027I beheld,\u0027 said she, to Patrick, when he asked her why she had fallen asleep, \u0027four ploughs in the north-east which ploughed the whole island, and before the sowing was finished the harvest was ripened, and clear well-springs and shiny streams came out of the furrows. White garments were on the sowers and ploughmen. I beheld four other ploughs in the north which ploughed the island athwart and turned the harvest again, and the oats which they had sown grew up at once and were ripe, and black streams came out of the furrows, and there were black garments on the sowers and on the ploughmen.\u0027\" \n \n [Pg 159] \n \n This vision Patrick explained to her, saying— \n \n \"\u0027The first four ploughs which thou beheldest, those are I and thou, who sow the four books of the gospel with a sowing of faith and belief and piety. The harvest which thou beheldest are they who come unto that faith and belief through our teaching. The four ploughs which thou beheldest in the north are the false teachers and the liars which will overturn the teaching which we have sown.\u0027\" \n \n St. Brigit\u0027s small oratory at Kildare, under the shadow of her branching oak, soon grew into a great institution, and within her own lifetime two considerable religious establishments sprang up there, one for women and the other for men. She herself selected a bishop to assist her in governing them, and another to instruct herself and her nuns. Long before her death, which occurred about the year 525, a regular city and a great school rivalling the fame of Armagh itself, had risen round her oak-tree. Cogitosus, himself one of the Kildare monks, who wrote a Latin life of St. Brigit at the desire of the community, gives us a fine description of the great church of Kildare in his own day, which was evidently some time prior to the Danish invasion at the close of the eighth century,[4] but how long before is doubtful. He tells us that the church was both large and lofty, with many pictures and hangings, and with ornamental doorways, and that a partition ran across the breadth of the church near the chancel or sanctuary: \n \n \"At one of its extremities there was a door which admitted the bishop and his clergy to the sanctuary and to the altar; and at the[Pg 160] other extremity on the opposite side there was a similar door by which Brigit and her virgins and widows used to enter to enjoy the banquet of the Body and Blood of Christ. Then a central partition ran down the nave, dividing the men from the women, the men being on the right and the women on the left, and each division having its own lateral entrance. These partitions did not rise to the roof of the church, but only so high as to serve their purpose. The partition at the sanctuary or chancel was formed with boards of wood decorated with pictures and covered with linen hangings which might, it seems, be drawn aside at the consecration, to give the people in the nave a better view of the holy mysteries.\"[5] \n \n The two institutions—nuns and monks—planted by St. Brigit continued long to flourish side by side, and Kildare is the only religious establishment in Ireland, says Dr. Healy, which down to a comparatively recent period preserved the double line of succession, of abbot-bishops and of abbesses. The annalists always took care to record the names of the abbesses with the same accuracy as those of the abbots, and to the last the abbesses as successors of St. Brigit, were credited with, in public opinion, and probably enjoyed in fact, a certain supremacy over the bishops of Kildare themselves. \n \n Amongst other occupations the monks and scholars of Kildare seem to have given themselves up to decorative art, and a school of metal work under the supervision of Brigit\u0027s first bishop soon sprang into existence, producing all kinds of artistically decorated chalices, bells, patens, and shrines; and the impulse given thus early to artistic work and to beautiful creations seems to have long propagated itself in Kildare, as the description of the church by Cogitosus shows, and as we may still conjecture from the exquisite round tower with its unusually ornamented doorway and its great height of over 130 feet, the loftiest tower of the kind in Ireland. \n \n [Pg 161] \n \n No doubt several attributes of the pagan Brigit,[6] who, as we have seen, was accounted by the ancient Irish to have been the goddess of poets, passed over to her Christian namesake, who was also credited with being the patroness of men of learning. On this, her life in the Book of Lismore contains the following significant and rather obscure passage: \n \n \"Brigit was once with her sheep on the Curragh, and she saw running past her a son of reading,[7] to wit Nindid the scholar was he. \n \n \"\u0027What makes thee unsedate, O son of reading?\u0027 saith Brigit, \u0027and what seekest thou in that wise?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027O nun,\u0027 saith the scholar, \u0027I am going to heaven.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027The Virgin\u0027s son knoweth,\u0027 said Brigit, \u0027happy is he that goeth that journey, and for God\u0027s sake make prayer with me that it may be easy for me to go.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027O nun,\u0027 said the scholar, \u0027I have no leisure, for the gates of heaven are open now and I fear they may be shut against me. Or, if thou art hindering me pray the Lord that it may be easy for me to go to heaven, and I will pray the Lord for thee, that it may be easy for thee, and that thou mayest bring many thousands with thee, into heaven.\u0027 \n \n [Pg 162] \n \n \"Brigit recited a paternoster with him. And he was pious thenceforward, and it is he that gave her communion and sacrifice when she was dying. Wherefore thence it came to pass that the comradeship of the world\u0027s softs of reading is with Brigit, and the Lord gives them through Brigit every perfect good they ask.\"[8] \n \n As St. Patrick is pre-eminently the patron saint of Ireland, so is Brigit its patroness, and with the Irish people no Christian name is more common for their boys than Patrick, or for their girls than Brigit.[9] She was universally known as the \"Mary of the Gael,\" and reverenced with a certain chivalric feeling which seems to have been always present with the Gaelic nation in the case of women, for, says her Irish life, her desire \"was to satisfy the poor, to expel every hardship, to spare every miserable man.... It is she that helpeth every one who is in a strait or a danger; it is she that abateth the pestilences; it is she that quelleth the anger and the storm of the sea. She is the prophetess of Christ: she is the queen of the south: She is the Mary of the Gael.\" The writer closes thus in a burst of eloquence: \n \n [Pg 163] \n \n \"Her relics are on earth, with honour and dignity and primacy, with miracles and marvels. Her soul is like a sun in the heavenly kingdom, among the choir of angels and archangels. And though great be her honour here at present, greater by far will it be when she shall arise like a shining lamp, in completeness of body and soul at the great Assembly of Doomsday, in union with cherubim and seraphim, in union with the Son of Mary the Virgin, in the union that is nobler than every union, in the union of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\" \n \n As of St. Patrick, so of his great co-evangeliser St. Brigit, there exist quite a number of various lives; the most ancient being probably a metrical life in Irish contained in the Book of Hymns, of which there still exists an eleventh century MS. It consists of fifty-three stanzas of four lines each, and is ascribed to St. Broccan or Brogan Cloen, who seems to have lived at the beginning of the seventh century.[10] This life does little more than expatiate upon Brigit\u0027s miracles and virtues. The next life of importance is that already mentioned, by Cogitosus, the Kildare monk, whose date is uncertain, but is clearly prior to the Danish invasions. This life, which is in very creditable Latin, and four others, were printed by Colgan. The first of these four is—probably falsely—attributed to St. Ultan, who died in the middle of the seventh century; the next is by a monk who is called Animosus, but of whom[Pg 164] nothing is known, though, as St. Donatus, who became bishop of Fiesole in 824, alludes to his works, he must have been an early author; the third is a twelfth-century work, by Laurence of Durham, an Englishman; and the last is in Latin verse, taken from a MS. which the unwearied Colgan procured from Monte Cassino, and which is attributed to Coelan, a monk of Iniscaltra, who probably lived in the eighth century, while a prologue to this life is prefixed by a later writer, the celebrated Irish bishop of Fiesole, Donatus, who, in the early part of the ninth century, worked with great success in Italy. There is something touching in the language with which this great and successful child of the Gael reverts in his prologue to the home of his childhood:— \n \n \"Far in the west they tell of a matchless land,[11] which goes in ancient books by the name of Scotia [i.e., Ireland]; rich in resources this land, having silver, precious stones, vestures and gold, well suited to earth-born creatures as regards its climate, its sun, and its arable soil; that Scotia of lovely fields that flow with milk and honey, hath skill in husbandry, and raiments, and arms, and arts, and fruits. There are no fierce bears there, nor ever has the land of Scotia brought forth savage broods of lions. No poisons hurt, no serpent creeps through the grass, nor does the babbling frog croak and complain by the lake. In this land the Scottish race are worthy to dwell, a renowned race of men in war, in peace, in fidelity.\" \n \n Whitley Stokes has published the Irish lives of St. Brigit from the Leabhar Breac and the Book of Lismore, and Donatus alludes to other lives by St. Ultan[12] and St. Eleran,[Pg 165] so that Brigit has not lacked biographers. She herself is said to have written a rule for her nuns and some other things, and O\u0027Curry prints one Irish poem ascribed to her—in which she prays for the family of heaven to be present at her feast: \"I should like the men of heaven in my own house, I should like rivers of peace to be at their disposal,\" etc.—which appears to be alluded to in the preface to the Litany of Angus the Culdee, as the \"great feast which St. Brigit made for Jesus in her heart.\"[13] \n ******** \n [1] Cogitosus, who probably wrote in the beginning of the eighth century, makes no allusion to her slave-parentage, but this was to be expected. \n \n [2] See Stokes, \"Three Middle Irish Homilies.\" \n \n [3] Cill-dara, the \"Church of the Oak-tree,\" now Kildare. \n \n [4] He himself says, \"Et quis sermone explicare potest maximum decorem hujus ecclesi? et innumera illius civitatis qu? dicemus miracula ... [hic] nullus carnalis adversarius nec concursus timetur hostium, sed civitas est refugii tutissima ... et quis ennumerare potest diversas turbas et innumerabiles populos de omnibus provinciis affluentes, alii ad epularum abundantiam, alii languidi propter sanitates, alii ad spectaculum turbarum, alii cum magnis donis venientes ad solemnitatem Nativitatis S. Brigit? qu? in die Calendarum est,\" etc. These are the evident outcome of the piping times of peace which Ireland enjoyed in the seventh and eighth centuries. It would have been impossible to have written in this way after the close of the eighth century. See chap. 36 of Cogitosus\u0027s life, \"Trias Thaumaturga,\" p. 524 of the Louvain edition. \n \n [5] Thus well summarised by Dr. Healy from the more diffuse Latin of Cogitosus. His description of the church is as follows: It was \"solo spatiosa et in altum minaci proceritate porrecta ac decorata pictis tabulis, tria intrinsecus habens oratoria ampla, et divisa parietibus tabulatis.\" One of the walls was \"decoratus, et imaginibus depictus, ac linteaminibus tectus.\" \n \n [6] This has not escaped Windisch. \"W?hrend,\" he writes, \"Patrick nur der christlichen Hagiologie angeh?rt, scheint Brigit zugleich die Erbin einer alten heidnischen Gottheit zu sein. Ihr Wesen enth?lt Ziige die mehr als eine heilig gesprochen Nonne hinter ihr vermuthen lassen.\" Windisch bases this chiefly upon the expressions in Broccan\u0027s hymn, which calls her the mother of Christ, and calls Christ her son, and equates her with Mary. The passage which I have adduced from the Irish life is even more remarkable: \n \n \"Brigit,\" writes Whitley Stokes \"(cp. Skr. bhargas) was born at sunrise neither within nor without a house, was bathed in milk, her breath revives the dead, a house in which she is staying flames up to heaven, cow-dung blazes before her, oil is poured on her head; she is fed from the milk of a white red-eared cow; a fiery pillar rises over her head; sun rays support her wet cloak; she remains a virgin; and she was one of the two mothers of Christ the Anointed. She has, according to Giraldus Cambrensis, a perpetual ashless fire watched by twenty nuns, of whom herself was one, blown by fans or bellows only, and surrounded by a hedge within which no male could enter\" (\"Top. Hib.\" chaps. 34, 35 and 36), from all which Stokes declares that one may without much rashness pick out certain of her life-incidents, as having \"originally belonged to the myth or the ritual of some goddess of fire.\" (See preface to \"Three Middle Irish Homilies.\") \n \n [7] \"Mac-léighinn,\" which is to this day a usual Irish term for student. \n \n [8] Thus translated by Dr. Whitley Stokes in his \"Lives of the Saints from the Book of Lismore,\" p. 194. In the original: \"Conid assein dorala cumthanus mac leighinn in domuin re Brigit, co tabair in coimdhi doibh tria atach Brigte gach maith fhoirbhthi chuinghid.\" \n \n [9] Or to speak more accurately no names were more common, but owing to the action of various influences, particularly of the National Board, with unsympathetic persons at its head, and of the men who direct the modern education of the Irish, the people who are not allowed by the National Board to learn history, and who are taught to despise the Irish language, are gradually being made ashamed of any names that are not English, and Patrick and Brigit almost bid fair to follow the way of Cormac, Conn, Felim, Art, Donough, Fergus, Diarmuid, and a score of other Christian names of men in common use a century ago, but now almost wholly extinct, and of Mève, Sive, Eefi, Sheela, Nuala, and as many more female names now nearly or completely obsolete. A woman of some education said to me lately, \"God forbid I should handicap my daughter in life by calling her Brigit;\" and a Catholic bishop said the other day that too often when an Irish parent abroad did pluck up courage to christen his son \"Patrick,\" he put it in, in a shamefaced whisper, at the end of several other names. This is the direct result of the teaching given by the National Board. \n \n [10] He is said to have written this hymn at the instigation of Ultan, who died in 653, but, as Windisch remarks, mention is probably made of Ultan only because he is said to have been the first to collect the miracles of Brigit—\"die Sprache,\" adds Windisch, \"ist alterthümlich; besonders beachtenswerth sind die ziemlich zahlreichen Perfectformen.\" It is remarkable that the miracles attributed to Brigit are given in the same order in this hymn and in Cogitosus\u0027 life of her. The metre is irregular. \n \n \"Ni bu Sanct Brigit suanach \n Ni bu húarach im seirc Dé, \n Sech ni chiuir ni cossena \n Ind nóeb dibad bethath che.\" \n \n The life by Cogitosus is evidently pre-Danish, and it is more likely to be an extension of the short metrical one, than that the metrical one should be a résumé of it. If this is so it bespeaks a considerable antiquity for the Irish verses. \n \n [11] There is a fragment in the Irish MS. Rawlinson, B. 512, quoted somewhere by Kuno Meyer, which reminds one of this passage. It begins: \"Now the island of Ireland, Inis Herenn, has been set in the west. As Adam\u0027s Paradise stands at the sunrise, so Ireland stands at the sunset, and they are alike in the nature of their soil,\" etc. \n \n [12] St. Ultan wrote a beautiful Irish hymn and also a Latin hymn to her—at least they are attributed to him—beginning— \n \n \"Christus in nostra insola \n Que vocatur hibernia \n Ostensus est hominibus \n Maximis mirabilibus. \n \n Que perfecit per felicem \n Celestis vite virginem \n Precellentem pro merito \n Magno in mundi circulo.\" \n \n See Todd\u0027s \"Liber Hymnorum,\" vol. ii. p. 58. The Latin orthography of the Irish is seldom quite perfect. \n \n [13] This poem begins: \n \n \"Ropadh maith lem corm-lind mór \n Do righ na righ \n Ropadh maith lem muinnter nimhe \n Acca hol tre bithe shír.\" \n \n I.e., \"I would like a great lake of ale for the King of the kings, I would like the people of heaven to be drinking it through eternal ages,\" which sounds curious, but Brigit probably meant it allegorically. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703/50181.html","bookId":1150,"book":{"id":1150,"title":"A Literary History of Ireland","description":"简介： The present volume has been styledin order to make it a companion book to other of Mr. Unwin\u0027s publicationsa Literary History of Ireland, but a Literary History of Irish Ireland would be a more correct title, for I have abstained altogether from any...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM"}}
