{"id":16597,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII ST. PATRICK AND THE EARLY MISSIONARIES","content":"Even supposing the Ogam alphabet to have been used in pre-Christian times, though it may have been employed by ollavs and poets to perpetuate tribal names and genealogies, still it was much too cumbrous and clumsy an invention to produce anything deserving the name of real literature. It is, so far as we know, only with the coming of Patrick that Ireland may be said to have become, properly speaking, a literary country. The churches and monasteries established by him soon became so many nuclei of learning, and from the end of the fifth century a knowledge of letters seems to have entirely permeated the island. So suddenly does this appear to have taken place, and so rapidly does Ireland seem to have produced a flourishing literature of laws, poems, and sagas, that it is very hard to believe that the inhabitants had not, before his coming, arrived at a high state of indigenous culture. This aspect of the case has been recently strongly put by Dr. Sigerson. \"I assert,\" said he, speaking of the early Brehon laws, at the revision of which in a Christian sense St. Patrick is said to have assisted, \"that, speaking biologically, such laws could not[Pg 134] emanate from any race whose brains have not been subject to the quickening influence of education for many generations.\"[1] \\n\\n \\n\\n The usual date assigned for St. Patrick\u0027s landing in Ireland in the character of a missionary is 432, and his work among the Irish is said to have lasted for sixty years, during which time he broke down the idol Crom Cruach, burnt the books of the druids at Tara, ordained numerous missionaries and bishops, and succeeded in winning over to Christianity a great number of the chiefs and sub-kings, who were in their turn followed by their tribesmen. \\n\\n \\n\\n St. Patrick did not work alone, nor did he come to Ireland as a solitary pioneer of a new religion; he was accompanied, as we learn from his life in the Book of Armagh, by a multitude of bishops, priests, deacons, readers, and others,[2] who had crossed over along with him for the service. Several were his own blood relations, one was his sister\u0027s son. Many likely youths whom he met on his missionary travels he converted to Christianity, taught to read, tonsured, and afterwards ordained. These new priests thus appointed worked in all directions, establishing churches and getting together congregations from amongst the neighbouring heathen. Unable to give proper attention to the teaching of the youths whom he elected as his helpers, so long as he himself was engaged in journeying through Ireland from point to point, he, after about twenty years of peripatetic teaching, established at Armagh about the year 450 the first Christian school ever founded in Ireland, the progenitor of that long line of colleges which made Ireland famous throughout Europe, and to which, two hundred years later, her Anglo-Saxon neighbours flocked in thousands.[3] \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 135] \\n\\n \\n\\n The equipments of these newly-made priests was of the scantiest. Each, as he was sent forth, received an alphabet-of-the-faith or elementary-explanation of the Christian doctrine, frequently written by Patrick himself, a \"Liber ordinis,\" or \"Mass Book,\" a written form for the administration of the sacraments, a psaltery, and, if it could be spared, a copy of the Gospels.[4] A good-sized retinue followed Patrick in all his journeyings, ready to supply with their own hands all things necessary for the new churches established by the saint, as well as to minister to his own wants. He travelled with his episcopal coadjutor, his psalm-singer, his assistant priest, his judge—originally a Brehon by profession, whom he found most useful in adjudicating on disputed questions—a personal champion to protect him from sudden attack and to carry him through floods and other obstacles, an attendant on himself, a bellringer, a cook, a brewer, a chaplain at the table, two waiters, and others who provided food and accommodation for himself and his household. He had in his company three smiths, three artificers, and three ladies who embroidered. His smiths and artificers made altars, book-covers, bells, and helped to erect his wooden churches; the ladies, one of them his own sister, made vestments and altar linens.[5] \\n\\n \\n\\n St. Patrick was essentially a man of work and not of letters, and yet it so happens that he is the earliest Irish writer of whom we can say with confidence that what is ascribed to him is really his. And here it is as well to say something about the genuineness of St. Patrick\u0027s personality and the authenticity of his writings, for the opinion started by Ledwich has gone abroad, and has somehow become prevalent, that St. Patrick\u0027s personality is nearly as nebulous as that of King Arthur or of Finn mac Cúmhail, and at the best is made up of a number of little Patricks lumped into one great one. That[Pg 136] there was more than one Patrick[6] is certain,[7] and that the great Saint Patrick who wrote the \"Confession\" may have got credit in the early Latin and later Irish lives for the acts of others, is perfectly possible, but that most of the essential features of his life are true, is beyond all doubt, and we have a manuscript 1091 years old, apparently copied from his own handwriting, and containing his own confession and apologia. \\n\\n \\n\\n How this exquisite manuscript, consisting of 216 vellum leaves, written in double columns, has happily been preserved to us, we shall not lose time in inquiring; but how its exact date has been ascertained through what Dr. Reeves has characterised as \"one of the most elegant and recondite demonstrations[Pg 137] which any learned society has on record, is worth mentioning.\" The Rev. Charles Graves, the present Bishop of Limerick, made a thorough examination of the whole codex when, after many vicissitudes and hair-breadth escapes from destruction, it had been temporarily deposited in the Royal Irish Academy. Knowing, as O\u0027Curry pointed out, that it was the custom for Irish scribes to sign their own names, with usually some particulars about their writing, at the end of each piece they copied, he made a careful search and discovered that this had actually been done in the Book of Armagh, and in no less than eight places, but that on every spot where it occurred it had been erased for some apparently inscrutable reason, with the greatest pains. In the last place but one,[Pg 138] however, where the colophon occurred, the process of erasure had been less thorough than in the others, and after long consideration, and treatment of the erasure with gallic acid and spirits of wine, Dr. Graves discovered that the words so carefully rubbed out were Pro Ferdomnacho ores, \"Pray for Ferdomnach.\" Turning to the other places, he found that the erased words in at least one other place were evidently the same. This settled the name of the scribe; he was Ferdomnach. The next step was to search the \"Four Masters,\" who record the existence of two scribes of that name who died at Armagh, one in 726 and the other in 844. One of these it must have been who wrote the Book of Armagh,—but which? This also Dr. Graves discovered, with the greatest ingenuity. At the foot of Fols. 52-6 he was, with extreme difficulty, able to decipher the words ... ach hunc ... e dictante ... ach herede Patricii scripsit. From these stray syllables he surmised that Ferdomnach had written the book at the bidding of some Archbishop of Armagh whose name ended in ach. For this the Psalter of Cashel, Leabhar Breac, and \"Four Masters,\" were consulted, and it was found that one Archbishop Senaach died in 609; it could not then have been by his commands the book was written by the first Ferdomnach; then came, after a long interval, Faoindealach, who died in 794, Connmach, who died in 806, and Torbach, who held the primacy for one year after him. On examining the hiatus it was found that the letter which preceded the fragment ach could not have been either an l or an m, but might have been a b, thus putting out of the question the names of Connmach and Faoindealach. Besides the vacant space before the ach was just sufficient to admit of the letters Tor, but not Conn, much less Faoindea. The conclusion was obvious: the passage ran, Ferdomnach hunc librum e dictante Torbach herede Patricii scripsit, \"Ferdomnach wrote this book at the dictation (or command) of Torbach, Patrick\u0027s heir (successor).\" Torbach, as we have[Pg 139] seen, became Archbishop in 806 and died in 807. The date was in this way recovered.[8] \\n\\n \\n\\n I have been thus particular in tracing the steps by which the age of this manuscript came to light, because it contains the earliest piece of certain Irish literature we have, the \"Confession of St. Patrick.\" Now the usually accepted date of St. Patrick\u0027s death, as given in the Annals of Ulster, is 492, about three hundred years before that, and Ferdomnach, the scribe, after copying it, added these words: \"Huc usque volumen quod patricius manu conscripsit sua. Septimadecima martii die translatus est patricius ad c?los,\" i.e., \"thus far the volume which Patrick wrote with his own hand. On the seventeenth day of March was Patrick translated to the heavens.\" It would appear highly probable from this that Ferdomnach actually copied from St. Patrick\u0027s autograph,[9] which had become so defaced or faded during the three previous centuries, that the scribe has written in many places incertus liber hic, \"the book is uncertain here,\" or else put a note[10] of[Pg 140] interrogation to indicate that he was not sure whether he had copied the text correctly. It will be seen from this that there was not the slightest trace of any concealment on the part of the scribe as to who he himself was, or what he was copying; there was no attempt to antedate his own writing, or to suggest that his copy was an original. But long after the scribe\u0027s generation had passed away and the origin of his work been forgotten, the volume which at first had been regarded only as a fine transcript of early documents, became known as \"Canon Phádraig,\" or Patrick\u0027s Testament, and popular opinion, relying on the colophon \"thus far the book which Patrick wrote with his own hand,\" set down the work as the saint\u0027s autograph. The belief that the volume was St. Patrick\u0027s own autograph of course enhanced enormously its value, and with it the dignity of its possessors, and the unscrupulous plan was resolved on of erasing the signature of the actual scribe. The veneration of the public was thus secured by interested persons at the cost of truth, and the deception probably lasted so long as the possession of such a volume brought with it either credit or dignity. This same volume[11] has another interest attaching to it, so that we cannot but felicitate ourselves that out of the wreck of so many thousands of volumes, it has been spared to us—it was brought to Brian Boru, when in the year 1004 he went upon his royal progress through Ireland, the first man of the race of Eber who had attained the proud position of monarch or Ard-righ for many centuries, and he, by the hand of his secretary, made an entry which may still be seen to-day, confirming the primacy of Armagh, and re-granting to it[Pg 141] the episcopal supremacy of Ireland which it had always enjoyed.[12] \\n\\n \\n\\n It is now time to glance at St. Patrick\u0027s \"Confession,\" as it is usually called, though in reality it is much more of the nature of an apologia pro vita sua. The evidence in favour of its authenticity is overwhelming, and is accepted by such cautious scholars as Stokes,[13] Todd, and Reeves, no first-rate critic, with perhaps one exception, having so far as I know ever ventured to question its genuineness. It is impossible to assign any motive for a forgery, and casual references to Decuriones, Slave-traffic, and to the \"Brittani?,\" or Britains, bear testimony to its antiquity. Again, the Latin in which it is written is barbarous in the extreme, the periods are rude, sometimes ungrammatical, often nearly unintelligible. He begins by telling us that his object in writing this confession in his old age was to defend himself from the charge of presumptuousness in undertaking the work he tried to perform amongst the Irish. He tells us that he had many toils and perils to surmount, and much to endure while engaged upon it. He never received one farthing for all his preaching and teaching. The people indeed were generous, and offered many gifts, and cast precious things upon the altar, but he would not receive them lest he might afford the unrighteous an occasion to cavil. He was still encompassed about with dangers, but he heeded them not, looking to the success which had attended his efforts, how \"the sons of the Scots and the[Pg 142] daughters of their princes became monks and virgins of Christ,\" and \"the number of holy widows and of continent maidens was countless.\" It would be tedious were he to recount even a portion of what he had gone through. Twelve times had his life been endangered, but God had rescued him, and brought him safe from all plots and ambuscades and rewarded him for leaving his parents, and friends, and country, heeding neither their prayers nor their tears, that he might preach the gospel in Ireland. He appeals to all he had converted, and to all who knew him, to say whether he had not refused all gifts—nay, it was he himself who gave the gifts, to the kings and to their sons, and oftentimes was he robbed and plundered of everything, and once had he been bound in fetters of iron for fourteen days until God had delivered him, and even still while writing this confession he was living in poverty and misery, expecting death or slavery, or other evil. He prays earnestly for one thing only, that he may persevere, and not lose the people whom God has given to him at the very extremity of the world. \\n\\n \\n\\n Unhappily this \"Confession\" is a most unsatisfying composition, for it omits to mention almost everything of most interest relating to the saint himself and to his mission. What floods of light might it have thrown upon a score of vexed questions, how it might have set at rest for ever theories on druidism, kingship, social life, his own birthplace, his mission from Rome,[14] his captors. Even of himself he tells us next to nothing, except that his father\u0027s name was Calpornus,[15] the son of[Pg 143] Potitus, the son of Odissus, a priest, and that he dwelt in the vicus or township of Benaven Taberni?; he had also a small villa not far off, where he tells us he was made captive at the age of about sixteen years. Because his Christian training was bad, and he was not obedient to the priests when they admonished him to seek for salvation, therefore God punished him, and brought him into captivity in a strange land at the end of the world. When he was brought to Ireland he tells us that his daily task was to feed cattle, and then the love of God entered into his heart, and he used to rise before the sun and pray in the woods and mountains, in the rain, the hail, and the snow. Then there came to him one night a voice in his sleep saying to him \"Your ship is ready,\" and he departed and went for two hundred miles, until he reached a port where he knew no one. This was after six years\u0027 captivity. The master of the ship would not take him on board, but afterwards he relented just as Patrick was about to return to the cottage where he had got lodging. He succeeded at last in reaching the home of his parents in Britannis [i.e., in some part of Britain, including Scotland], and his parents besought him, now that he had returned from so many perils, to remain with them always. But the angel Victor came in the guise of a man from Ireland, and gave him a letter, in which the voice of the Irish called him away, and the voices of those who dwelt near the wood of Focluth called him to walk amongst them, and the spirit of God, too, urged him to return.[16] \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 144] \\n\\n \\n\\n He says nothing of his training, or his ordination, or his long sojourn in Gaul, or of St. Germanus, with whom he studied according to the \"Lives,\" but he alludes incidentally to his wish to see his parents and his native Britain, and to revisit the brethren in Gaul, and to see the face of God\u0027s saints there; but though he desired all this, he would not leave his beloved converts, but would spend the rest of his life amongst them.[17] \\n\\n \\n\\n From this brief résumé of the celebrated \"Confession\" it will be seen that it is the perfervid outpouring of a zealous early Christian, anxious only to clear himself from the charges of worldliness or carelessness, and absolutely devoid of those appeals to general interest which we meet with in most of such memoirs, but there is a vein of warm piety running through the whole, and an abundance of scriptural quotations—all, of course, from the ante-Hieronymian or pre-Vulgate version, another proof of antiquity—which has caused it to be remarked that a forger might, perhaps, write equally bad Latin, but could hardly \"forge the spirit that breathes in the language which is the manifest outpourings of a heart like unto the heart of St. Paul.\"[18] \\n\\n \\n\\n There are two other pieces of literature assigned to St. Patrick, as well as the \"Confession\"; these are the \"Epistle to Coroticus\" in Latin, and the \"Deer\u0027s Cry\" in Irish. The[Pg 145] Epistle is not found in the Book of Armagh, but it is found in other MSS. as old as the tenth or eleventh century, and bears such close resemblance in style and language to the \"Confession,\" whole phrases actually occurring in both, that it also has generally been regarded as genuine.[19] There is some doubt as to who Coroticus was, but he seems to have been a semi-Christian king of Dumbarton who, along with some Scots, i.e., Irish, and the Southern Picts who had fallen away from Christianity, raided the eastern shores of Ireland and carried off a number of St. Patrick\u0027s newly-converted Christians, leaving the white garments of the neophytes stained with blood, and hurrying into captivity numbers upon whose foreheads the holy oil of confirmation was still glistening. The first letter was to ask Coroticus to restore the captives, and when this request was derided the next was sent, excommunicating him and all his aiders and abettors, calling upon all Christians neither to eat nor drink in their company until they had made expiation for their crimes. Patrick himself had, he here explains, preached the gospel to the Irish nation for the sake of God, though they had made him a captive and destroyed the men-servants and maids of his father\u0027s house. He had been born a freedman and a noble, the son of a decurio or prefect, but he had sold his nobility for others and regretted it not. His lament over the loss of his converts is touching: \"Oh! my most beautiful and most loving brothers and children whom in countless numbers I have begotten in Christ, what shall I do for you? Am I so unworthy before God and men that I cannot help you? Is it a crime to have been born in Ireland?[20] And have we not the same God as they have? I sorrow for you, yet I rejoice, for if ye are taken from the world ye are believers through me, and are gone to Paradise.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 146] \\n\\n \\n\\n The \"Cry of the Deer,\" or \"Lorica,\" as it is also called, is in Irish. The saint is said to have made it when on his way to visit King Laoghaire [Leary] at Tara, and the assassins who had been planted by the king to slay him and his companions thought as he chanted this hymn that it was a herd of deer that passed them by, and thus they escaped. The metre of the original is a kind of unrhymed or half-rhymed rhapsody, called in Irish a Rosg, and is perfectly unadorned. The language, however, though very old, has of course been modified in the process of transcription. Patrick calls upon the Trinity to protect him that day at Tara, and to bind to him the power of the elements. \\n\\n \\n\\n I bind me to-day[21] \\n\\n God\u0027s might to direct me, \\n\\n God\u0027s power to protect me, \\n\\n God\u0027s wisdom for learning, \\n\\n God\u0027s eye for discerning, \\n\\n God\u0027s ear for my hearing, \\n\\n God\u0027s word for my clearing, \\n\\n God\u0027s hand for my cover, \\n\\n God\u0027s path to pass over, \\n\\n God\u0027s buckler to guard me, \\n\\n God\u0027s army to ward me, \\n\\n Against snares of the devils, \\n\\n Against vices, temptations, \\n\\n [Pg 147]Against wrong inclinations, \\n\\n Against men who plot evils \\n\\n To hurt me anew, \\n\\n Anear or afar with many or few. \\n\\n \\n\\n * * * * * \\n\\n \\n\\n Christ near, Christ here, \\n\\n Christ be with me, \\n\\n Christ beneath me, \\n\\n Christ within me, \\n\\n Christ behind me, \\n\\n Christ be o\u0027er me, \\n\\n Christ before me, \\n\\n Christ in the left and the right, \\n\\n Christ hither and thither, \\n\\n Christ in the sight, \\n\\n Of each eye that shall seek me,[22] etc. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the Book of Armagh, in the last chapter of Tirechan\u0027s life, St. Patrick is declared to be entitled to four honours in every church and monastery of the island. One of these honours was that the hymn written by St. Seachnall, his nephew, in praise of himself, was to be sung in the churches during the days when his festival was being celebrated, and another was that \"his Irish canticle\" was to be always sung,[23] apparently all the year through, in the liturgy, but perhaps only during the week of his festival. The Irish canticle is evidently[Pg 148] this \"Lorica,\" which was, as we see from this notice in the Book of Armagh, believed to be his in the seventh century, and it has been sung under that belief from that day almost to our own.[24] \\n\\n \\n\\n The other hymn, the singing of which at his festival is alluded to as one of St. Patrick\u0027s \"honours,\" was composed by Seachnall [Shaughnal],[25] a nephew of St. Patrick\u0027s, in laudation of the saint himself. It is a very interesting piece of rough latinity, and is generally regarded as genuine. The occasion of its composition deserves to be told, for it casts a ray of light on the prudential and self-restrained side of St. Patrick\u0027s character, which no doubt contributed largely to his success when working in the midst of his wavering converts. Seachnall said that Patrick\u0027s preaching would be perfect if he only insisted a little more on the necessity of giving, for then more property and land would be at the disposal of the Church for pious uses. This remark of his nephew was repeated to St. Patrick, who was very much annoyed at it, and said beautifully, that \"for the sake of charity he forbore to preach charity,\" and intimated that the holy men who should come after him might benefit by the offerings of the faithful which he had left untouched. Then Seachnall, grieved at having thus pained his uncle, and anxious to win his regard again,[Pg 149] composed a poem of twenty-two stanzas each beginning with a different letter, with four lines of fifteen syllables in each verse.[26] When he had done this he asked permission of Patrick to recite to him a poem which he had composed in praise of a holy man, and when Patrick said that he would gladly hear the praises of any of God\u0027s household, the poet adroitly suppressing Patrick\u0027s name which occurs in the first verse, recited it for him. Patrick was pleased, but interupted the poet at one stanza when he said that the subject of his laudations was maximus in regno c?lorum,[27] \"the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,\" asking how could that be said of any[Pg 150] man. Maximus, ingeniously replied Seachnall, does not here mean \"greatest,\" but only \"very great.\" He then disclosed to his uncle that he himself was the object of the poem, and asked—like all bards—for the reward for it, whereupon Patrick promised that to all who recited the hymn piously morning and evening, God in His mercy might give the glory of heaven. \"I am content with that award,\" said the poet, \"but as the hymn is long and difficult to be remembered I wish you would obtain the same reward for whosoever recites even a part of it.\" Whereupon St. Patrick promised that the recitation of the last three verses would be sufficient, and his nephew was satisfied, having proved himself the first poet of Christian Ireland, and having obtained such a reward for his verses as neither bard nor ollav had ever obtained before him. It was probably this same Seachnall who was the author of the much finer hymn of eleven verses which used to be sung in the old Irish churches at communion— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sancti venite \\n\\n Christi corpus sumite, \\n\\n Sanctum bibentes \\n\\n Quo redempti sanguinem. \\n\\n \\n\\n Salvati Christi \\n\\n Corpore et sanguine, \\n\\n A quo refecti \\n\\n Laudes dicamus Deo. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hoc Sacramento \\n\\n Corporis et sanguinis \\n\\n Omnes exuti \\n\\n Ab inferni faucibus,\" etc. \\n\\n \\n\\n The legend in the Leabhar Breac has it that this hymn was first chanted during the holy communion by the angels in his church, on the reconciliation between himself and Saint Patrick, whence the origin of chanting it during the communion service. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Book of Armagh contains the two earliest lives of the national saint that we have, probably the two earliest[Pg 151] biographies of any size ever composed in Ireland. They are written in rude Latin, with a good deal of Irish place-names and Irish words intermixed, the first by one Muirchu Maccu Machteni,[28] who tells us that he wrote at the instigation of Aed, bishop of Sletty, who, as we know from the \"Four Masters,\" died about 698, and the second by Tirechan, who says he received his knowledge of the saint from the lips and writings of Bishop Ultan,[29] his tutor, who died in 656, and who, supposing him to have been seventy or eighty years old at the time of his death, must have been born only eighty or ninety years after the death of St. Patrick himself. Both of these writers appear to have had older memoirs to draw on, for Muirchu says that many had before them endeavoured to write the history of St. Patrick from what their fathers and those who were ministers of the Word from the beginning had told them, though none had ever succeeded in producing a proper biography,[30] and in Tirechan\u0027s life of him in the Book of Armagh—an evident patchwork—we read that all his godly doings had been brought together[31] and collected by the[Pg 152] most skilful of the ancients. The first of these lives consists of two books containing twenty-eight and thirteen short chapters, respectively, the second, Tirechan\u0027s, of one book containing fifty-seven chapters, in addition to which there are a number of minor notes referring to St. Patrick in Latin and in Irish, which Ferdomnach, who transcribed the book in 807, appears to have taken from other old lives or memoirs of the saint. The Irish portions of these notes are of peculiar interest, as showing what the Irish language was, as written about the year 800.[32] \\n\\n \\n\\n If it is genuine the earliest life of Patrick ever written would probably be the brief metrical life ascribed to Fiacc of Sletty, the sixth or seventh in descent from Cáthaoir [Cauheer] Mór, who was king of Leinster at the close of the second century.[33] His mother was a sister of Dubhthach\u0027s [Duv-hach], the chief poet and Brehon of Ireland, who, we are told, helped St. Patrick to review and revise the Brehon Laws. Fiacc was a youthful poet in Dubhthach\u0027s train at Tara. Afterwards he was tonsured by St. Patrick, became Bishop of Sletty, and on Patrick\u0027s death is said to have written his life, and not forgetful of his former training, to have written it in elaborate verse.[34] So famous a critic as Zimmer believed half the poem to be genuine, but Thurneysen rejects[Pg 153] it because it does not fall in with his theories of Irish metre.[35] \\n\\n \\n\\n But the longest and most important life of St. Patrick is that known as the Tripartite, or Triply-divided Life, which is really a series of three semi-historical homilies, or discourses, which were probably delivered in honour of the saint on the three festival days devoted to his memory, that is, the Vigil, the Feast itself, on March 17th, and the day after, or else the Octave. This Tripartite life, which is a fairly complete one, is written in ancient Irish, with many passages of Latin interspersed. The monk Jocelin, who wrote a life of the saint in the twelfth century, tells us that St. Evin[36]—from whom Monasterevin, in Queen\u0027s County, is called, a saint of the early sixth century—wrote a life of Patrick partly in Latin and partly in Gaelic, and Colgan, the learned Franciscan who translated the Tripartite in his \"Trias Thaumaturga,\"[37] believed that this was the very life which St. Evin wrote. Colgan found the Tripartite life in three very ancient Gaelic MSS., procured for him, no doubt, by the unwearied research of Brother Michael O\u0027Clery in the early part of the seventeenth century, which he collated one with the other, and of which he gives the following noteworthy account:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The first thing to be observed is that it has been written by its first author and in the aforesaid manuscript, partly in Latin, partly[Pg 154] in Gaelic, and this in very ancient language, almost impenetrable by reason of its very great antiquity, exhibiting not only in the same chapter, but also in the same line, alternate phrases now in the Latin, now in the Gaelic tongue. In the second place, it is to be noticed that this life, on account of the very great antiquity of its style, which was held in much regard, used to be read in the schools of our antiquarians in the presence of their pupils, being elucidated and expounded by the glosses of the masters, and by interpretations of and observations on the more abstruse words; so that hence it is not to be wondered at that some words—which certainly did happen—gradually crept from these glosses into the texts, and thus brought a certain colour of newness into this most ancient and faithful author, some things being turned from Latin into Gaelic, some abbreviated by the scribes, and some altogether omitted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Colgan further tells us that, \"of the three MSS. above mentioned, the first and chief is from very ancient vellums of the O\u0027Clerys, antiquarians in Ulster; the second from the O\u0027Deorans, of Leinster; the third taken from I know not what codex; and they differ from each other in some respects; one relating more diffusely what is more close in the others, and one relating in Latin what in the others was told in Gaelic; but we have followed the authority of that which relates the occurrences more diffusely and in Latin.\" O\u0027Curry discovered in the British Museum a copy of this life, made in the fifteenth century, and it has since been admirably edited by Dr. Whitley Stokes, who, however, does not believe for philological and other reasons, that it could have been written before the middle of the tenth century. If so it is no doubt a compilation of all the pre-existing lives of the saint, and it mentions distinctly that six different writers, not counting Fiacc the poet, had collected the events of St. Patrick\u0027s life and his miracles, amongst whom were St. Columcille, who died in 592, and St. Ultan, who died in 656.[38] It is hardly[Pg 155] necessary, however, to say that in the matter of all anonymous Gaelic writings like the present, it is difficult to decide with any certainty as to age or date. The occurrence, indeed, of very old forms, shows that the sentences containing those old forms were first written at an early period; the occurrence of more modern forms, however, is no proof that the passages containing them were first written in modern times, for the words may have been altered by later transcribers into the language they spoke themselves; nor are allusions to events which we know were later than the date of an alleged writer, always conclusive proofs that the work which contains them cannot be his work, for such allusions constantly creep into the margin of books at the hands of copyists, especially if those books were—as Colgan says the Tripartite life was—annotated and explained in schools. In cases of this kind there is always considerable latitude to be allowed to destructive and constructive criticism, and at the end matters must still remain doubtful.[39] \\n\\n \\n\\n So much for the more important lives of St. Patrick, the first known littérateur of Ireland. \\n\\n ******** \\n\\n [1] \"Contemporary Review.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [2] So Tirechan, in Book of Armagh, fol. 9. \"Et secum fuit multitudo episcoporum sanctorum et presbiterorum, et diaconorum, ac exorcistarum, hostiarium, lectorumque, necnon filiorum quos ordinavit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [3] So many English were attracted to Armagh in the seventh century that the city was divided into three wards, or thirds, one of which was called the Saxon Third. \\n\\n \\n\\n [4] See Dr. Healy\u0027s \"Ireland\u0027s Ancient Schools and Scholars,\" p. 64. \\n\\n \\n\\n [5] There is a curious poem on St. Patrick\u0027s family of artificers quoted in the \"Four Masters\" under A.D. 278. \\n\\n \\n\\n [6] There were no less than twenty-two saints of the name of Colum, yet that does not detract one iota from the genuineness of the life of the great Colum, called Columcille. There were fourteen St. Brendans, there were twenty-five St. Ciarans, and fifteen St. Brigits. \\n\\n \\n\\n How Ledwich—who, however, as O\u0027Donovan remarks, looks at everything Irish with a jaundiced eye—could have written down St. Patrick as a myth is inconceivable, in the face of the fact that he was already recognised in the sixth century as a great saint. The earliest mention of him is probably St. Columba\u0027s subscription to the Book of Durrow, in the sixth century, which runs: \"Rogo beatitudinem tuam Sancte Presbyter Patrici, ut quicumque hunc libellum manu tenuerit Columb? Scriptoris, qui hoc scripsi ... met evangelium per xii. dierum spatium.\" Here we see a prayer already addressed to him as a national saint. \\n\\n \\n\\n [7] This is clearly shown by the 56th chap. of Tirechan\u0027s life fol. 16aa of the Book of Armagh, where he makes the following statement: \"XIII. Anno Teothosii imperatoris a Celestino episcopo papa Rom? Patricius episcopus ad doctrinam Scottorum mittitur. Qui Celestinus XLVII episcopus fuit a Petro apostolo in urbe Roma. Paladius episcopus primus mittitur [in the year 430, according to Bede] qui Patricius alio nomine appellabatur, qui martirium passus est apud Scottos, ut tradunt sancti antiqui. Deinde Patricius secundus ab anguelo Dei, Victor nomine, et a Celestino papa mittitur, cui Hibernia tota credidit, qui eam pene totam bab[titzavit].\" Also it is to be observed that St. Patrick\u0027s life according to the usual computations, covers 120 years, which seems an improbably long period. According to the Brussels Codex of Muirchu Maccu Machteni\u0027s life, he died a passione Domini nostri 436; the author, no doubt, imagined the passion to have taken place in A.D. 34; this would fix Patrick\u0027s death as in 470. See p. 20 of Father Hogan\u0027s \"Documenta ex Libro Armachano,\" and with this Tirechan also agrees, saying \"A passione autem christi colleguntur anni ccccxxxvi. usque ad mortem Patricii.\" Tirechan curiously contradicts himself in saying, \"Duobus autem vel v annis regnavit Loiguire post mortem Patricii, omnis autem regni illius tempus xxxvi. ut putamus,\" in chap. ii., and in chap. liii. he says that Patrick taught (i.e., in Ireland) for 72 years! He evidently compiled badly from two different documents. \\n\\n \\n\\n The only cogent reason for doubting about the reality of St. Patrick is that he is not mentioned in the Chronicon of Prosper, which comes down to the year 455, and which ascribes the conversion of Ireland to Palladius, as does Bede afterwards. It is the silence of Prosper and Bede about any one of the name of Patrick which has cast doubt upon his existence. A most ingenious theory has been propounded by Father E. O\u0027Brien in the \"Irish Ecclesiastical Record\" to explain this. According to him Patrick is the Palladius of Prosper and Bede. The earliest lives, and the scholiast on Fiacc\u0027s hymn, tell us that Patrick had four names; one of these was Succat \"qui est deus belli,\" but Palladius is the Latin of Patrick\u0027s name (succat). The Deus belli could only be rendered into Latin by the words Arius Martius or Palladius, these being the only names drawn from war-gods, and of these Palladius was the commonest. It seems not unlikely that the Patrick who wrote the \"Confession\" and converted Ireland is the Palladius of Bede and Prosper, who also converted Ireland. The Paladius of Tirechan who failed to convert Ireland is evidently another person altogether. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is to be remarked that although Bede never mentions Patrick in his \"Ecclesiastical History,\" nevertheless in the \"Martyrology\"—found by Mabillon at Rheims, and attributed to Bede, Patrick is distinctly commemorated— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Patricius Domini servus conscendit ad aulam, \\n\\n Cuthbertus ternas tenuit denasque Kalendas.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [8] For the full particulars of this acute discovery, which sets the date of the codex beyond doubt or cavil, see Dr. Graves\u0027 paper read before the Royal Irish Academy, vol. iii. pp. 316-324, and a supplementary paper giving other cogent reasons, vol. iii. p. 358. According to O\u0027Donovan, the \"Four Masters\" antedate here by five years. It is worth remarking that Torbach, who caused this copy to be made, was himself a noted scribe. His death in 807 is recorded in the \"Four Masters\" and in the \"Annals of Ulster,\" we read \"Torbach, son of Gorman, scribe, lector, and Abbot of Armagh, died.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [9] There are several passages omitted in the Book of Armagh, which are found in an ancient Brussels MS. of the eleventh century. These were probably omitted from the Book of Armagh because they were undecipherable. The Brussels MS. and others contain nearly as much again as it, and there are many proofs that this extra matter is not of later or spurious origin; thus Tirechan refers to Patrick\u0027s own records, \"ut in scriptione sua affirmat,\" for evidence of a fact not mentioned in the \"Confession\" as given in the Book of Armagh, but which is supplied by the other MSS., namely, that Patrick paid the price of fifteen \"souls of men,\" or slaves, for protection on his missionary journey across Ireland. The frequent occurrence of deest, et cetera, et reliqua, show that the Armagh copy of the \"Confession\" is nothing like a full one. The Brussels MS. formerly belonged to the Irish monastery of Würzburg. \\n\\n \\n\\n [10] See ch. III, note 31. \\n\\n \\n\\n [11] The other contents of the Book of Armagh, besides the Patrician documents, are a copy of the New Testament, enriched with concordance tables and illustrative matter from Jerome, Hilary, and Pelagius. It includes the Epistle to the Laodiceans attributed to St. Paul, but it is mentioned that Jerome denied its authenticity. There are some pieces relating to St. Martin of Tours, and the Patrician pieces—the Life, the Collectanea, the Book of the Angel, and the \"Confession.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [12] \"Sanctus Patricus iens ad c?lum mandavit totum fructum laboris sui tam baptismi tam causarum quam elemoisinarum deferendum esse apostolic? urbi quae scotice nominatur ardd-macha. Sic reperi in Bibliothics Scotorum. Ego scripsi, id est Caluus Perennis, in conspectu Briain imperatoris Scotorum, et quod scripsi finituit pro omnibus regibus Maceriae [i.e., Cashel].\" \"Calvus Perennis\" is the Latin translation of Mael-suthain, Brian\u0027s scribe and secretary. For a curious story about this Mael-suthain, see p. 779 O\u0027Curry\u0027s MS. Materials. \\n\\n \\n\\n [13] See above Ch. XI, note 13. It has been printed in Haddan and Stubb\u0027s, \"Councils,\" etc., vol. ii. p. 296, and also admirably in Gilbert\u0027s facsimiles of National MSS. \\n\\n \\n\\n [14] It has often been said that the life of the saint in the Book of Armagh ignores the Roman Mission. But while the life of Muirchu Maccu Machteni does ignore it, Tirechan\u0027s his contemporary\u0027s, life, in the same book, distinctly acknowledges it, in these words, \"deinde Patricius secundus ab anguelo dei, Victor nomine, et a Celestino papa mittitur cui Hibernia tota credidit, qui eam pene totam bap[titzavit].\" (See chap. 56 of Tirechan\u0027s life.) \\n\\n \\n\\n [15] In Irish he is usually called Son of Alprann or Alplann, the C of Calpornus being evidently taken as belonging to the Mac, thus Mac Calprainn became Mac Alprainn. In the Brussels Codex of Muirchu Maccu Machteni\u0027s life, however, he is called Alforni filius, and the place of his birth is called Ban navem thabur indecha, supposed to be Killpatrick, near Dumbarton, in Scotland, which is evidently a corruption of his own Bannaven Taberni?, which seems to mean River-head Tavern; it may be from the two words navem thabur that St. Fiacc\u0027s hymn says that he was born in nemthur. Patrick himself only gives us two generations of his ancestry, and it is very significant of Irish ways to find Flann of Monasterboice, running it up to fourteen! \\n\\n \\n\\n [16] It is worth while to transcribe this passage as a fair specimen of St. Patrick\u0027s style and latinity. \"Et ibi scilicet in sinu noctis virum venientem quasi de Hiberione cui nomen Victoricus, cum ?pistulis innumerabilibus vidi; et dedit mihi unam ex his et legi principium ?pistol? continentem \u0027Uox Hiberionacum.\u0027 Et dum recitabam principium ?pistol?, putabam enim ipse in mente audire vocem ipsorum qui erant juxta silvam Focluti [in the county Mayo] qu? est prope mare occidentale. Et sic exclamaverunt: \u0027Rogamus te sancte puer ut venias et adhuc ambulas inter nos.\u0027 Et valde compunctus sum corde, et amplius non potui legere. Et sic expertus [i.e. experrectus] sum. Deo gratias quia post plurimos annos pr?stitit illis Dominus secundum clamorum illorum\" (Folio 23, 66, Book of Armagh, p. 126 of Father Hogan\u0027s Bollandist edition). \\n\\n \\n\\n [17] The \"Confession\" ends with a certain rough eloquence: \"Christus Dominus pauper fuit pro nobis; ego vero miser et infelix, et si opes voluero jam non habeo; neque me ipsum judico quia quotidie spero aut internicionem aut circumveniri, aut redigi in servitatem, sive occassio cujus-libet.... Et h?c est confessio mea antequam moriar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [18] Dr. Healy\u0027s \"Ireland\u0027s Ancient Schools and Scholars,\" p. 68. \\n\\n \\n\\n [19] It is printed by Haddan and Stubbs, \"Councils,\" etc., vol. ii. p. 314. \\n\\n \\n\\n [20] This is certainly the first time on record that this question—so often repeated since in so many different forms—was asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n [21] See the original in Windsch\u0027s \"Irische Texte,\" 1. p. 53, and Todd\u0027s \"Liber Hymnorum\"— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Atomrigh indiu niurt Dé dom luamaracht \\n\\n Cumachta Dé dom chumgabail \\n\\n Ciall Dé domm imthús \\n\\n Rose Dé dom reimcíse, \\n\\n Cluas Dé dom éstecht \\n\\n Briathar Dé dom erlabrai, \\n\\n Lám De domm imdegail \\n\\n Intech Dé dom remthechtas. \\n\\n Sciath Dé dom dítin \\n\\n Sochraite Dé domm anucul \\n\\n Ar intledaib demna \\n\\n Ar aslaigthib dualche \\n\\n Ar cech nduine míduthrastar dam, \\n\\n ícéin ocus i n-ocus \\n\\n i n-uathed ocus hi sochaide,\" etc. \\n\\n \\n\\n [22] Thus translated almost literally by Dr. Sigerson, \"Bards of the Gael and Gall,\" p. 138. This is not the only poem attributed to St. Patrick, several others are ascribed to him in the \"Tripartite Life,\" and a MS. in the Bibliothèque Royale contains three others. Eight lines of one of them is found in the Vatican Codex of Marianus Scotus and are given by Zeuss in his \"Grammatica Celtica,\" p. 961, second edition. The lines there given refer to St. Brigit. There is also a rann attributed to St. Patrick quoted by the \"Four Masters,\" and the \"Chronicon Scotorum\" attributes to him a rann on Bishop Erc. \\n\\n \\n\\n [23] \"Canticum ejus scotticum semper canere,\" which a marginal note in the book explains as Ymnus Comanulo, which Father Hogan interprets as protectio Clamoris, adding \"ac proinde synonyma voci Faith Fiada,\" which has been interpreted clamor custodis or \"The Guardsman\u0027s Cry\" by Stokes. The poem, then, was extant in the seventh century, was attributed to St. Patrick, and was sung in the churches—a strong argument for its authenticity. \\n\\n \\n\\n [24] \"Even to this day,\" says Dr. Healy, in \"Ireland\u0027s Ancient Schools and Scholars,\" p. 77, \"the original is chanted by the peasantry of the south and west in the ancestral tongue, and it is regarded as a strong shield against all dangers natural or supernatural.\" I, myself, however, in collecting the \"Religious Songs of Connacht,\" have found no trace of this, and I am not sure that the learned Bishop of Clonfert, led astray by Petrie, is not here confounding it with the \"Marainn Phadraig,\" which mysterious piece is implicitly believed to be the work of St. Patrick, and is still recited all over the west, with the belief that there is a peculiar virtue attached to it. I have even known money to have been paid for its recital in the west of Galway, as a preventive of evil. For this curious piece, which is to me at least more than half unintelligible, see my \"Religious Songs of Connacht.\" It appears to have been founded upon an incident similar to that recorded by Muirchu Maccu Machteni, book i. chap. 26. \\n\\n \\n\\n [25] Of Dunshaughlin recté Dunsaughnil (Domhnach Seachnaill) in Meath. \\n\\n \\n\\n [26] As this was probably the first poem in Latin ever composed in Ireland, it deserves some consideration. It is a sort of trochaic tetrameter catalectic, of the very rudest type. The ictus, or stress of the voice, which is supposed to fall on the first syllable of the first, third, fifth, and seventh feet, seldom corresponds with the accent. The elision of \"m\" before a vowel is disregarded, no quantities are observed, and the solitary rule of prosody kept is that the second syllable of the seventh foot is always short, with the exception of one word, indutus, which the poet probably pronounced as ind?tus. The third verse runs thus, with an evident effort at vowel rhyme (\"Liber Hymnorum,\" vol. i. p. 11). \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Beati Christi custodit mandata in omnibus \\n\\n Cujus opera refulgent clara inter homines.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Muratori printed this hymn, from the so-called Antiphonary of Bangor, a MS. of the eight century preserved in the Ambrosian Library. The rude metre is that employed by Hilary in his hymn beginning— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ymnum dicat turba fratrum, ymnum cantus personet,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n which, as Stokes points out, is the same as that of the Roman soldiers, preserved in Suetonius, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"C?sar Gallias subégit, Nicomedes C?sarem.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The internal evidence of the antiquity of this hymn is \"strong,\" says Stokes, \"first, the use of the present tense in describing the saint\u0027s actions; secondly, the absence of all reference to the miracles with which the Tripartite and other lives are crowded; and, thirdly, the absence of all allusion to the Roman mission on which many later writers from Tirechan downwards insist with much persistency.\" We may then, I think, receive this hymn as authentic. \\n\\n \\n\\n [27] \"Maximus namque in regno c?lorum vocabitur, \\n\\n Qui quod verbis docet sacris factis adimplet bonis; \\n\\n Bono procedit exemplo formamque fidelium \\n\\n Mundoque in corde habet ad Deum fiduciam.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [28] In the \"Martyrology of Tallaght\" this curious name is written Mac hui Machteni, i.e., the son of the grandson of Machtenus, or Muirchu, i.e., Murrough, descendant of Machtenus, and the Leabhar Breac has this note at the name of Muirchu: \"civitas ejus in uib Foelan, i.e., mac hui Mathcene,\" thereby giving us to understand that he was a native of what is the present county of Waterford. Maccumachteni is not a surname, for these were not introduced into Ireland for three centuries later. \\n\\n \\n\\n [29] \"Omnia qu? scripsi a principio libri hujus scitis quia in vestris regionibus gesta sunt, nizi de eis pauca inveni in utilitatem laboris mei a senioribus multis, ac ab illo Ultano episcopo Conchubernensi qui nutrivit me, retulit sermo!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [30] \"Multos jam conatos esse ordinare narrationem istam secundum quod patres eorum et qui ministri ab initio fuerunt sermonis tradiderunt illis; sed propter difficillimum narrationis opus diversasque opiniones et plurimorum plurimas suspiciones nunquam ad unum certumque historiae tramitem pervenisse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [31] \"Omnia in Deo gesta ab antiquis peritissimis adunata atque collecta sunt;\" and again: \"Post exitum Patricii alumpni sui valde ejusdem libros conscripserunt;\" but this may mean that they made copies of the books left behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n [32] Here is a specimen: \"Dulluid patricc othemuir hicr?ch Laigen conrancatar ocus dubthach mucculugir uccdomnuch mar criathar la auu censelich. áliss patricc dubthach imdamnae .n. epscuip diadesciplib dilaignib id?n fer soêr socheni?il cenon cenainim nadip ru becc nadipromar bedasommae, toisclimm fer ?insêtche dunarructhae actoentuistiu,\" which would run some way thus in the modern language: \"Do luid (i.e., Chuaidh) Pádraic ó Theamhair i gcrích Laighean go rancadar [fein] agus Dubhthach Mac Lugair ag Domhnach Mór Criathair le uibh Ceinnsealaigh.

It scarcely differs in most parts from Little Rannaigheacht. \\n\\n \\n\\n [35] See \"Keltische Studien,\" Heft ii., and the \"Revue Celtique.\" The first verses run thus:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Genair Patraicc in Nemthur \\n\\n Is ed atfet hi scélaib \\n\\n Maccan se mbliadan déac \\n\\n In tan dobreth fo deraib. \\n\\n \\n\\n Succat a ainm itubrad \\n\\n Ced a athair ba fissi \\n\\n Mac Calpairn maic Otide \\n\\n Hoa deochain Odissi.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [36] He was tenth in descent from that Owen M?r who wrested half the sovereignty of Ireland from Conn of the Hundred Battles. \\n\\n \\n\\n [37] I.e., \"The wonder-working Three,\" containing the lives of Patrick, Brigit, and Columcille, translated by Colgan from Irish into Latin. \\n\\n \\n\\n [38] Also St. Aileran the Wise, whose \"Fragments\" are published by Migne; St. Adamnan, the author of the \"Life of Columcille\"; St. Ciaran of Belach-Duin; and St. Colman. Jocelyn says that Benignus, who died in 468, wrote another life of Patrick, but of it nothing is known. \\n\\n \\n\\n [39] Here is a short passage from the Tripartite, which will show the language in which it is written: \"Fecht ann occ tuidhecht do Patraic do Chlochur antuaith da fuarcaib a thren-fher dar doraid and, i.e., Epscop mac Cairthind. Issed adrubart iar turcbail Patraic: uch uch. Mu Debroth, ol Patraic ni bu gnath in foculsin do rad duitsiu. Am senoir ocus am lobur ol Epscop Mac Cairthind,\" which would run some way thus in the modern language: \"Feacht [uair] do bhi ann, ag tigheacht do Phádraig go Clochar (i gcondae, Tir-Eóghain) ón tuaidh, d\u0027 iomchair a threán-fhear é thar sruth do bhi ann, eadhoin Easbog Mac Cairthind.
