{"id":16593,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX DRUIDISM","content":"Although Irish literature is full of allusions to the druids it is extremely difficult to know with any exactness what they were. They are mentioned from the earliest times. The pre-Milesian races, the Nemedians and Fomorians, had their druids, who worked mutual spells against each other. The Tuatha De Danann had innumerable druids amongst them, who used magic. The invading Milesians had three druids with them in their ships, Amergin the poet and two others. In fact, druids are mentioned in connection with all early Irish fiction and history, from the first colonising of Ireland down to the time of the saints. It seems very doubtful, however, whether there existed in Ireland as definitely established an order of druids as in Britain and on the Continent.[1][Pg 83] They are frequently mentioned in Irish literature as ambassadors, spokesmen, teachers, and tutors. Kings were sometimes druids, so were poets. It is a word which seems to me to have been, perhaps from the first, used with great laxity and great latitude. The druids, so far as we can ascertain, do not seem to be connected with any positive rites or worship; still less do they appear to have been a regular priesthood, and there is not a shadow of evidence to connect them with any special worship as that of the sun or of fire. In the oldest saga-cycle the druid appears as a man of the highest rank and related to kings. King Conor\u0027s father was according to some—probably the oldest—accounts a druid; so was Finn mac Cool\u0027s grandfather. \n \n Before the coming of St. Patrick there certainly existed images, or, as they are called by the ancient authorities, \"idols\" in Ireland, at which or to which sacrifice used to be offered, probably with a view to propitiating the earth-gods, possibly the Tuatha De Danann, and securing good harvests and abundant kine. From sacrificial rites spring, almost of necessity, a sacrificial caste, and this caste—the druids—had arrived at a high state of organisation in Gaul and Britain when observed by C?sar, and did not hesitate to sacrifice whole hecatombs of human beings. \"They think,\" said C?sar, \"that unless a man\u0027s life is rendered up for a man\u0027s life, the will of the immortal God cannot be satisfied, and they have sacrifices of this kind as a national institution.\" \n \n There appears nothing, however, that I am aware of, to connect the druids in Ireland with human sacrifice, although such sacrifice appears to have been offered. The druids, however, appear to have had private idols of their own. We find a very minute account in the tenth-century glossary of King Cormac as to how a poet performed incantations with his[Pg 84] idols. The word \"poet\" is here apparently equivalent to druid, as the word \"druid\" like the Latin vates is frequently a synonym for \"poet.\" Here is how the glossary explains the incantation called Imbas Forosnai:— \n \n \"This,\" says the ancient lexicographer, \"describes to the poet whatsoever thing he wishes to discover,[2] and this is the manner in which it is performed. The poet chews a bit of the raw red flesh of a pig, a dog, or a cat, and then retires with it to his own bed behind the door,[3] where he pronounces an oration over it and offers it to his idol gods. He then invokes the idols, and if he has not received the illumination before the next day, he pronounces incantations upon his two palms and takes his idol gods unto him [into his bed] in order that he may not be interrupted in his sleep. He then places his two hands upon his two cheeks and falls asleep. He is then watched so that he be not stirred nor interrupted by any one until everything that he seeks be revealed to him at the end of a nomad,[4] or two or three, or as long as he continues at his offering, and hence it is that this ceremony is called Imbas, that is, the two hands upon him crosswise, that is, a hand over and a hand hither upon his cheeks. And St. Patrick prohibited this ceremony, because it is a species of Teinm Laeghdha,[5] that is, he declared that any one who performed it should have no place in heaven or on earth.\" \n \n These were apparently the private images of the druid himself which are spoken of, but there certainly existed public idols in pagan Ireland before the evangelisation of the island. St. Patrick himself, in his \"Confession,\" asserts that before his coming the Irish worshipped idols—idola et immunda—and we have preserved to us more than one account of the great gold-covered image which was set up in Moy Slaught[6] [i.e., the[Pg 85] Plain of Adoration], believed to be in the present county of Cavan. It stood there surrounded by twelve lesser idols ornamented with brass, and may possibly have been regarded as a sun-god ruling over the twelve seasons. It was called the Crom Cruach or Cenn Cruach,[7] and certain Irish tribes considered it their special tutelary deity. The Dinnseanchas, or explanation of the name of Moy Slaught, calls it \"the King Idol of Erin,\" \"and around him were twelve idols made of stones, but he was of gold. Until Patrick\u0027s advent he was the god of every folk that colonised Ireland. To him they used to offer the firstlings of every issue and the chief scions of every clan;\" and the ancient poem in the Book of Leinster declares that it was \"a high idol with many fights, which was named the Cromm Cruaich.\"[8] \n \n The poem tells us that \"the brave Gaels used to worship it, and would never ask from it satisfaction as to their portion of the hard world without paying it tribute.\" \n \n [Pg 86] \n \n \"He was their God,[9] \n The withered Cromm with many mists, \n The people whom he shook over every harbour, \n The everlasting kingdom they shall not have. \n \n To him without glory \n Would they kill their piteous wailing offspring, \n With much wailing and peril \n To pour their blood around Cromm Cruaich. \n \n Milk and corn \n They would ask from him speedily \n In return for one-third of their healthy issue, \n Great was the horror and scare of him. \n \n To him \n Noble Gaels would prostrate themselves, \n From the worship of him, with many manslaughters \n The Plain is called Moy Sleacht. \n \n * * * * * \n \n In their ranks (stood) \n Four times three stone idols \n To bitterly beguile the hosts, \n The figure of Cromm was made of gold. \n \n Since the rule \n Of Heremon,[10] the noble man of grace, \n There was worshipping of stones \n Until the coming of good Patrick of Macha [Ardmagh].\" \n \n There is not the slightest reason to distrust this evidence as far as the existence of Crom Cruach goes. \n \n [Pg 87] \n \n \"This particular tradition,\" says Mr. Nutt, \"like the majority of those contained in it [the Dinnseanchas] must be of pre-Christian origin. It would have been quite impossible for a Christian monk to have invented such a story, and we may accept it as a perfectly genuine bit of information respecting the ritual side of insular Celtic religion.\"[11] \n \n St. Patrick overthrew this idol, according both to the poem in the Book of Leinster and the early lives of the saint. The life says that when St. Patrick cursed Crom the ground opened and swallowed up the twelve lesser idols as far as their heads, which, as Rhys acutely observes, shows that when the early Irish lives of the saint were written the pagan sanctuary had so fallen into decay, that only the heads of the lesser idols remained above ground, while he thinks that it was at this time from its bent attitude and decayed appearance the idol was called Crom, \"the Stooper.\"[12] There is, however, no[Pg 88] apparent or recorded connection between this idol and the druids, nor do the druids appear to have fulfilled the functions of a public priesthood in Ireland, and the Introduction to the Seanchas Mór, or ancient Book of the Brehon Laws, distinctly says that, \"until Patrick came only three classes of persons were permitted to speak in public in Erin, a chronicler to relate events and to tell stories, a poet to eulogise and to satirise, and a Brehon to pass sentence from precedents and commentaries,\" thus noticeably omitting all mention of the druids as a public body. \n \n The idol Crom with his twelve subordinates may very well have represented the sun, upon whom both season and crops and consequently the life both of man and beast depend. The gods to whom the early Irish seem to have sacrificed, were no doubt, as I think Mr. Nutt has shown, agricultural powers, the lords of life and growth, and with these the sun, who is at the root of all growth, was intimately connected, \"the object of that worship was to promote increase, the theory of worship was—life for life.\"[13] That the Irish swore by the sun and the moon and the elements is certain; the oath is quoted in many places,[14][Pg 89] and St. Patrick appears to allude to sun-worship in that passage of his \"Confession,\" where he says, \"that sun which we see rising daily at His bidding for our sake, it will never reign, and its splendour will not last for ever, but those who adore it will perish miserably for all eternity:\" this is also borne out by the passage in Cormac\u0027s Glossary of the images the pagans used to adore, \"as, for instance, the form or figure of the sun on the altar.\"[15] \n \n Another phase of the druidic character seems to have been that he was looked upon as an intermediary between man and the invisible powers. In the story which tells us how Midir the De Danann, carries off the king\u0027s wife, we are informed that the druid\u0027s counsel is sought as to how to recover her, which he at last is enabled to do \"through his keys of science and Ogam,\" after a year\u0027s searching. \n \n The druids are represented as carrying wands of yew, but there is nothing in Irish literature, so far as I am aware of, about their connection with the oak, from the Greek for which, δρ??,[16] they are popularly supposed to derive their name. They used to be consulted as soothsayers upon the probable success of expeditions, as by Cormac mac Art, when he was thinking about extorting a double tribute from Munster,[17] and by Dáthi, the last pagan king of Ireland, when[Pg 90] setting out upon his expedition abroad; they took auguries by birds, they could cause magic showers and fires, they observed stars and clouds, they told lucky days,[18] they had ordeals of their own,[19] but, above all, they appear to have been tutors or teachers. \n \n Another druidic practice which is mentioned in Cormac\u0027s Glossary is more fully treated of by Keating, in his account of the great pagan convention at Uisneach, a hill in Meath, \"where the men of Ireland were wont to exchange their goods and their wares and other jewels.\" This convention was held in the month of May, \n \n \"And at it they were wont to make a sacrifice to the arch-god, whom they adored, whose name was Bél. It was likewise their usage to light two fires to Bél in every district in Ireland at this season, and to drive a pair of each herd of cattle that the district contained between these two fires, as a preservative, to guard them against all the diseases of that year. It is from that fire thus made that the day on which the noble feast of the apostles Peter and James is held has been called Bealtaine [in Scotch Beltane], i.e., Bél\u0027s fire.\" \n \n Cormac, however, says nothing about a god named Bél—who, indeed, is only once mentioned elsewhere, so far as I know[20]—but explains the name as if it were Bil-tene, \"goodly fire,\" from the fires which the druids made on that day through which to drive the cattle.[21] \n \n [Pg 91] \n \n Post-Christian accounts of the druids as a whole, and or individual druids differ widely. The notes on St. Patrick, in the Book of Armagh, present them in the worst possible light as wicked wizards and augurs and people of incantations,[22] and the Latin lives of the Saints nearly always call them \"magi.\" Yet they are admitted to have been able to prophecy. King Laoghaire\u0027s [Leary\u0027s] druids prophesied to him three years before the arrival of Patrick that \"adze-heads would come over a furious sea,\" \n \n \"Their mantles hole-headed, \n Their staves crook-headed, \n Their tables in the east of their houses.\"[23] \n \n In the lives of the early saints we find some of them on fair terms with the druids. Columcille\u0027s first teacher was a druid, whom his mother consulted about him. It is true that in the Lismore text he is called not a druid but a fáidh, i.e., vates or prophet, but this only confirms the close connection between druid, prophet, and teacher, for his proceedings are distinctly druidical, the account runs: \"Now when the time for reading came to him the cleric went to a certain prophet[Pg 92] who abode in the land to ask him when the boy ought to begin. When the prophet had scanned the sky, he said \u0027Write an alphabet for him now.\u0027 The alphabet was written on a cake, and Columcille consumed the cake in this wise, half to the east of a water, and half to the west of a water. Said the prophet through grace of prophecy, \u0027So shall this child\u0027s territory be, half to the east of the sea, and half to the west of the sea.\u0027\"[24] Columcille himself is said to have composed a poem beginning, \"My Druid is the son of God.\" Another druid prophesies of St. Brigit before she was born,[25] and other instances connecting the early saints with druids are to be found in their lives, which at least show that there existed a sufficient number of persons in early Christian Ireland who did not consider the druids wholly bad, but believed that they could prophecy, at least in the interests of the saints. \n \n From what we have said, it is evident that there were always druids in Ireland, and that they were personages of great importance. But it is not clear that they were an organised body like the druids of Gaul,[26] or like the Bardic body in later times in Ireland, nor is it clear what their exact functions were, but they seem to have been teachers above everything else. It is clear, too, that the ancient Irish—at least in some cases—possessed and worshipped images. That they sacrificed to them, and even offered up human beings, is by no means so certain, the evidence for this resting upon the single passage in the Dinnseanchas, and the poem (in a modern style of metre) in the Book of Leinster, which we have just given, and which though it is evidence for the existence of the idol Crom Cruach, known to us already from other sources, may possibly have had the trait of human sacrifice added as a heightening touch by a Christian chronicler familiar with the[Pg 93] accounts of Moloch and Ashtar?th. The complete silence which, outside of these passages,[27] exists in all Irish literature as to a proceeding so terrifying to the popular imagination, seems to me a proof that if human sacrifice was ever resorted to at all, it had fallen into abeyance before the landing of the Christian missionaries. \n ******** \n [1] C?sar\u0027s words are worth repeating. He says that there were two sorts of men in Gaul both numerous and honoured—the knights and the Druids, \"equites et druides,\" because the people counted for nothing and took the initiative in nothing. As for the Druids, he says: \"Rebus divinis intersunt, sacrificia publica et privata procurant, religiones interpretantur ... nam fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt, et si quod est admissum facinus, si c?des facta, si de hereditate, de finibus controversia est iidem decernunt pr?mia, p?nasque constituunt.\" All this seems very like the duties of the Irish Druids, but not what follows: \"si qui, aut privatus aut populus eorum decreto non stetit, sacrificiis interdicunt. H?c p?na apud eos est gravissima.\" Nor do the Irish appear to have had the over-Druid whom C?sar talks of. (See \"De Bello Gallico,\" book vi. chaps. 13, 14). \n \n [2] \"Cach raet bid maith lasin filid agus bud adla(i)c dó do fhaillsiugad.\" \n \n [3] Thus O\u0027Curry (\"Miscellany of the Celtic Society,\" vol. ii. p. 208); but Stokes translates, \"he puts it then on the flagstone behind the door.\" See the original in Cormac\u0027s Glossary under \"Himbas.\" I have not O\u0027Donovan\u0027s translation by me. \n \n [4] O\u0027Curry translates this by \"day.\" It is at present curiously used, I suppose by a kind of confusion with the English \"moment,\" in the sense of a minute or other short measure of time. At least I have often heard it so used. \n \n [5] Another species of incantation mentioned in the glossary. \n \n [6] In Irish Magh Sleacht. \n \n [7] In O\u0027Donovan\u0027s fragmentary manuscript catalogue of the Irish MSS., in Trinity College, Dublin, he writes apropos of the life of St. Maedhog or Mogue, contained in H. 2, 6: \"I searched the two Brefneys for the situation of Moy Sleacht on which stood the chief pagan Irish idol Crom Cruach, but have failed, being misled by Lanigan, who had been misled by Seward, who had been blinded by the impostor Beauford, who placed this plain in the county of Leitrim. It can, however, be proved from this life of St. Mogue that Magh Sleacht was that level part of the Barony of Tullaghan (in the county of Cavan) in which the island of Inis Breaghwee (now Mogue\u0027s Island), the church of Templeport, and the little village of Ballymagauran are situated.\" I have been told that O\u0027Donovan afterwards found reason to doubt the correctness of this identification. \n \n [8] M. de Jubainville connects the name with cru (Latin, cruor), \"blood,\" translating Cenn Cruach by tête sanglante and Crom Cruach by Courbe sanglante, or Croissant ensanglanté; but Rhys connects it with Cruach, \"a reek\" or \"mound,\" as in Croagh-Patrick, St. Patrick\u0027s Reek. Cenn Cruach is evidently the same name as the Roman station Penno-Crucium, in the present county of Stafford, the Irish \"c\" being as usual the equivalent of the British \"p.\" This would make it appear that Cromm was no local idol. Rhys thinks it got its name Crom Cruach, \"the stooped one of the mound,\" from its bent attitude in the days of its decadence. \n \n [9] Observe the exquisite and complicated metre of this in the original, a proof, I think, that the lines are not very ancient. It has been edited from the Book of Leinster, Book of Ballymote, Book of Lecan, and Rennes MS., at vol. i. p. 301 of Mr. Nutt\u0027s \"Voyage of Bran,\" by Dr. Kuno Meyer— \n \n \"Ba hé a nDia \n In Cromm Crín co n-immud cia \n In lucht ro Craith ós each Cúan \n In flaithius Búan nochos Bia.\" \n \n [10] I.e., Eremon or Erimon, Son of Milesius, see above, p. 59. \n \n [11] The details of this idol, and, above all, the connection in which it stands to the mythic culture-king Tighearnmas, could not, as Mr. Nutt well remarks, have been invented by a Christian monk; but nothing is more likely, it appears to me, than that such a one, familiar with the idol rites of Jud?a from the Old Testament, may have added the embellishing trait of the sacrifice of \"the firstlings of every issue.\" \n \n [12] Sir Samuel Ferguson\u0027s admirable poem upon the death of Cormac refers to the priests of the idol, but there is no recorded evidence of any such priesthood— \n \n \"Crom Cruach and his sub-gods twelve, \n Saith Cormac, are but carven treene. \n The axe that made them haft or helve, \n Had worthier of your worship been. \n \n But he who made the tree to grow, \n And hid in earth the iron stone, \n And made the man with mind to know \n The axe\u0027s use is God alone. \n \n Anon to priests of Crom were brought— \n Where girded in their service dread, \n They ministered in red Moy Slaught— \n Word of the words King Cormac said. \n \n They loosed their curse against the king, \n They cursed him in his flesh and bones, \n And daily in their mystic ring \n They turned the maledictive stones.\" \n \n D\u0027Arcy McGee also refers to Crom Cruach in terms almost equally poetic, but equally unauthorised:— \n \n \"Their ocean-god was Manannán Mac Lir, \n Whose angry lips \n In their white foam full often would inter \n Whole fleets of ships. \n Crom was their day-god and their thunderer, \n Made morning and eclipse; \n Bride was their queen of song, and unto her \n They prayed with fire-touched lips!\" \n \n [13] Nutt\u0027s \"Voyage of Bran,\" vol. ii. p. 250. \n \n [14] The elements are recorded as having slain King Laoghaire because he broke the oath he had made by them. In the Lament for Patrick Sarsfield as late as the seventeenth century, the unknown poet cries: \n \n \"Go mbeannaigh\u0027 an ghealach gheal\u0027s an ghrian duit, \n O thug tu an lá as láimh Righ \u0027Liam leat.\" \n \n I.e., May the white Moon and the Sun bless you, since thou hast taken the Day out of the hand of King William. \n \n And a little later we find the harper Carolan swearing \"by the light of the sun.\" \n \n \"Molann gach aon an té bhíos cráibhtheach cóir, \n Agus molann gach aon an té bhíos páirteach leó, \n Dar solas na gréine sé mo rádh go deó \n Go molfad gan spéis gan bhréig an t-áth mar geóbhad.\" \n \n [15] See above, ch. V, note 18. \n \n [16] The genitive of drai, the modern draoi (dhree) is druad, from whence no doubt the Latin druidis. It was Pliny who first derived the name from δρ??. The word with a somewhat altered meaning was in use till recently. The wise men from the East are called druids (draoithe) in O\u0027Donnell\u0027s translation of the New Testament. The modern word for enchantment (draoidheacht) is literally \"druidism,\" but an enchanter is usually draoidheadóir, a derivation from draoi. \n \n [17] See above, ch. III, note 14. \n \n [18] Cathbad, Conor mac Nessa\u0027s Druid, foretold that any one who took arms—the Irish equivalent for knighthood—upon a certain day, would become famous for ever, but would enjoy only a brief life. It was Cuchulain who assumed arms upon that day. \n \n [19] O\u0027Curry quotes a druidic ordeal from the MS. marked H. 3. 17 in Trinity College, Dublin. A woman to clear her character has to rub her tongue to a red-hot adze of bronze, which had been heated in a fire of blackthorn or rowan-tree. \n \n [20] \"Revue Celt.,\" vol. ii. p. 443. Is Bel to be equated with what Rhys calls in one place \"the chthonian divinity Beli the Great,\" of the Britons, and in another \"Beli the Great, the god of death and darkness\"? (See \"Hibbert Lectures,\" pp. 168 and 274.) \n \n [21] The Christian priests, apparently unable to abolish these cattle ceremonies, took the harm out of them by transferring them to St. John\u0027s Eve, the 24th of June, where they are still observed in most districts of Ireland, and large fires built with bones in them, and occasionally cattle are driven through them or people leap over them. The cattle were probably driven through the fire as a kind of substitute for their sacrifice, and the bones burnt in the fire are probably a substitute for the bones of the cattle that should have been offered up. Hence the fires are called \"teine cnámh\" (bone-fire) in Irish, and bōne-fire (not b?nfire) in English. \n \n [22] St. Patrick is there stated to have found around the king \"scivos et magos et auruspices, incantatores et omnis mal? artis inventores.\" \n \n [23] This means tonsured men, with cowls, with pastoral staves, with altars in the east end of the churches. The ancient Irish rann is very curious:—- \n \n \"Ticcat Tailcinn \n Tar muir meirceann, \n A mbruit toillceann. \n A crainn croimceann. \n A miasa n-airrter tige \n Friscerat uile amen.\" \n \n [24] I.e., one half in Ireland, the other in Scotland, alluding to his work at Iona and among the Picts. \n \n [25] Stokes, \"Lives of the Saints, from the Book of Lismore,\" p. 183. \n \n [26] Who were, according to Ammianus Marcellinus, quoting the Greek historian, Timagenes, \"sodaliciis adstricti consortiis.\" \n \n [27] There is one other instance of human sacrifice mentioned in the Book of Ballymote, but this is recorded in connection with funeral games, and appears to have been an isolated piece of barbarity performed \"that it might be a reproach to the Momonians for ever, and that it might be a trophy over them.\" Fiachra, a brother of Niall of the Nine Hostages, in the fourth century, carried off fifty hostages from Munster, and dying of his wounds, the hostages were buried alive with him, round his grave: \"ro hadnaicead na geill tucadh a neass ocus siad beo im fheart Fiachra comba hail for Mumain do gres, ocus comba comrama forra.\" For another allusion to \"human sacrifice\" see O\u0027Curry\u0027s \"Manners and Customs,\" vol. i. p. dcxli and cccxxxiii. The \"Dinnseanchas,\" quoted from above, is a topographical work explaining the origin of Irish place-names, and attributed to Amergin mac Amhalgaidh, poet to King Diarmuid mac Cearbaill, who lived in the sixth century. \"There seems no reason,\" says Dr. Atkinson, in his preface to the facsimile Book of Leinster, \"for disputing his claims to be regarded as the original compiler of a work of a similar character—the original nucleus is not now determinable.\" The oldest copy is the Book of Leinster and treats of nearly two hundred places and contains eighty-eight poems. The copy in the Book of Ballymote contains one hundred and thirty-nine, and that in the Book of Lecan even more. The total number of all the poems contained in the different copies is close on one hundred and seventy. The copy in the Bodleian Library was published by Whitley Stokes in \"Folk-lore,\" December, 1892, and that in the Advocates Library, in Edinburgh, in \"Folk-lore,\" December, 1893. The prose tales, from a copy at Rennes, he published in the \"Revue Celtique,\" vols. xv. and xvi. An edition of the oldest copy in the Book of Leinster is still a desideratum. The whole work is full of interesting pagan allusions, but the different copies, in the case of many names, vary greatly and even contradict each other. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703/50176.html","bookId":1150,"book":{"id":1150,"title":"A Literary History of Ireland","description":"简介： The present volume has been styledin order to make it a companion book to other of Mr. Unwin\u0027s publicationsa Literary History of Ireland, but a Literary History of Irish Ireland would be a more correct title, for I have abstained altogether from any...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM"}}
