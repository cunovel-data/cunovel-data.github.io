{"id":16616,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII THE DANISH PERIOD","content":"The first onfall of the Danes seems to have been made about the year 795, and for considerably over two centuries Erin was shaken from shore to shore with ever-recurring alarms, and for many years every centre of population lived in a state of terror, not knowing what a day might bring forth. Monasteries and colleges were burnt again and again, and built again and again, only to be reburnt. Numbers of invaluable books were destroyed, gold and silver work was carried off in quantities, and a state of unrest produced, which must have made learning in many parts of the island well-nigh impossible. \n \n Strange to say, despite the troubled condition of Ireland during these two or three centuries, she produced a large number of poets and scholars, the impulse given by the enthusiasm of the sixth and seventh centuries being still strong upon her. Unquestionably the greatest name amongst her men of learning during this period is that of the statesman, ecclesiastic, poet and scholar, Cormac mac Culinan, who was at once king and bishop of Cashel,[1] and one of the most[Pg 420] striking figures in both the literary and political history of these centuries. \n \n To him we owe that valuable compilation, so often quoted already under the title of \"Cormac\u0027s Glossary,\" which is by far the oldest attempt at a comparative vernacular dictionary made in any language of modern Europe.[2] Of course it has been enlarged by subsequent writers, but the idea and much of the matter remains Cormac\u0027s. In its original conception, it was meant to explain and interpret words and phrases which in the ninth century had become obscure to Irish scholars, and as might be expected, it throws light on many pagan customs, on history, law, romance, and mythology. Cormac\u0027s other literary effort was the compilation of the Saltair of Cashel, now most unhappily lost, but it appears to have been a great work. In it was contained the Book of Rights,[3] drawn up for the readjustment of the relations existing between princes and tribes, and still preserved. St. Benignus was said to have originally composed in verse a complete statement of the various rights, privileges, and duties of the High-king, the provincial kings, and the local chieftains. This, like so much of ancient and primitive law, was drawn up in verse so as to be thus stereotyped for the future, and easily remembered at a time when books were scarce. Cormac seems to have enlarged, modified, and brought it up to date to suit the changing times, and it was subsequently redacted again in Brian Boru\u0027s day in a sense favourable to Munster.[4] The king-bishop was a most remarkable man and an excellent scholar. He appears to have known Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Danish, and to have been one of the finest Old Gaelic scholars of his day, and withal an accomplished poet, though his verses are now lost. He was slain in battle in the year[Pg 421] 908,[5] under circumstances so curiously described in the fragmentary annals edited by O\u0027Donovan that it may be worth repeating here. He was, as we know from other sources, betrothed to the Princess Gormfhlaith or Gormly, daughter of Flann Sionna [Shinna], king of Meath and High-king of Ireland, but determining to enter the Church he returned her with her dowry to her father without consummating the marriage; after this he took orders, and rose in time to be archbishop of Cashel as well as king of Munster. Gormly, however, was married against her will to Cearbhall [Caroll], king of Leinster. It was in the year 908 that Flann, the High-king, with Caroll king of Leinster, now his son-in-law, prepared to meet Munster and to assert by arms his right to the presentation of the ancient church of Monasterevan, but it seems probable that he also bore the king-archbishop a grudge for his treatment of his daughter Gormly. Here is the annalistic account of the sequel:— \n \n DEATH OF CORMAC MAC CULINAN.[6] \n \n \"The great host of Munster was assembled by the same two, that is, Flaherty,[7] [abbot of Scattery Island, in the Shannon], and Cormac [mac Culinan], to demand hostages of Leinster and Ossory, and all the men of Munster were in the same camp.... And noble ambassadors came from Leinster from Caroll, son of Muirigan [king of that province], to Cormac first, and they delivered a message of peace from the Leinstermen, i.e., one peace to be in all Erin until May following (it being then the second week in autumn), and to give hostages into the keeping of Maenach, a holy, wise, and pious man, and of other pious men, and to give jewels and much property to Cormac and Flaherty. \n \n \"Cormac was much rejoiced at being offered this peace, and he afterward went to tell it to Flaherty and how he was offered it from[Pg 422] Leinster. When Flaherty heard this he was greatly horrified, and \u0027t was what he said, \u0027This shows,\u0027 said he, \u0027the littleness of thy mind and the feebleness of thy nature, for thou art the son of a plebeian,\u0027 and he said many other bitter and insulting words, which it would be too long to repeat. \n \n \"The answer which Cormac made him was, \u0027I am certain,\u0027 Cormac said, \u0027of what the result of this [obstinacy of yours] will be, a battle will be fought, O holy man,\u0027 said he, \u0027and [I] Cormac shall be under a curse for it, and it is likely that it will be the cause of death to thee [also].\u0027 And when he had said this he came into his own tent, afflicted and sorrowful. And when he sat down he took a basketful of apples and proceeded to divide them amongst his people and said, \u0027My dear people,\u0027 he said, \u0027I shall never give you apples again from this out for ever.\u0027 \u0027Is it so, O dear earthly lord?\u0027 said his people; \u0027why art thou sorrowful and melancholy with us; it is often thou hast boded evil for us?\u0027 \u0027It is,\u0027 [said Cormac,] \u0027as I say, and yet, dear people, what melancholy thing have I said, for though I should not distribute apples to you with my own hand, yet there shall be some one of you in my place who will.\u0027 He afterwards ordered a watch to be set, and he called to him the holy, pious, and wise man, Maenach, son of Siadhal [Shiel], the chief co-arb or successor of Comhghall, and he made his confession and will in his presence, and he took the body of Christ from his hand, and he resigned the world in the presence of Maenach, for he knew that he would be killed in battle, but he did not wish that many others should know it. He also ordered that his body should be brought to Cloyne if convenient, but if not to convey it to the cemetery of Diarmuid, [grand]son of Aedh Roin, where he had studied for a long time. He was very desirous, however, of being interred at Cloyne of Mac Lenin. Maenach, however, was better pleased to have him interred at Disert Diarmada, for that was one of [Saint] Comhghall\u0027s towns, and Maenach was Comhghall\u0027s successor. This Maenach, son of Shiel, was the wisest man of his time, and he now exerted himself much to make peace, if it were possible, between the men of Leinster and Munster. \n \n \"Many of the forces of Munster deserted unrestrained. There was great noise, too, and dissension in the camp of the men of Munster at this time, for they heard that Fiann, son of Malachy [High-king of Ireland], was in the camp of the Leinster men [helping them] with great forces of foot and horse. It was then Maenach said, \u0027Good men of Munster,\u0027 said he, \u0027you ought to accept of the good hostages I have offered you to be placed in the custody of pious men till May next, namely, the son of Caroll, king of Leinster, and the son of the king of Ossory.\u0027 All the men of Munster were saying[Pg 423] that it was Flaherty [the abbot], son of Inmainên alone who compelled them to go [to fight] into Leinster. \n \n \"After this great complaint which they made, they came over Slieve Mairgé from the west to Leithglinn Bridge. But Tibraidé, successor of Ailbhé [of Emly], and many of the clergy along with him tarried at Leithglinn, and also the servants of the army and the horses which carried the provisions. \n \n \"After this trumpets were blown and signals for battle were given by the men of Munster, and they went forward till they came to Moy-Ailbhé.[8] Here they remained with their back to a thick wood awaiting their enemies. The men of Munster divided themselves into three equally large battalions, Flaherty, son of Inmainên, and Ceallach, son of Caroll, king of Ossory, over the first division; Cormac mac Culinan, king of Munster, over the middle division; Cormac, son of Mothla, King of the Deisi, and the King of Kerry, and the kings of many other tribes of West Munster, over the third division. They afterwards came on in this order to Moy-Ailbhe. They were querulous on account of the numbers of the enemy and their own fewness. Those who were knowledgeable, that is those who were amongst themselves, state that the Leinstermen and their forces amounted to three times or four times the number of the men of Munster or more. Unsteady was the order in which the men of Munster came to the battle. Very pitiful was the wailing which was in the battle—as the learned who were in the battle relate—the shrieks of the one host in the act of being slaughtered and the shouts of the other host exulting over that slaughter. There were two causes for which the men of Munster suffered so sudden a defeat; for Céileachar, the brother of Cingégan, suddenly mounted his horse and said, \u0027Nobles of Munster,\u0027 said he, \u0027fly suddenly from this abominable battle, and leave it between the clergy themselves who could not be quiet without coming to battle,\u0027 and afterwards he suddenly fled accompanied by great hosts. The other cause of the defeat was: When Ceallach, son of Caroll, saw the battalion in which were the chieftains of the King of Erin cutting down his own battalion he mounted his horse and said to his own people, \u0027Mount your horses and drive the enemy before you.\u0027 And though he said this, it was not to really fight he said so but to fly. Howsoever it resulted from these causes that the Munster battalion fled together. Alas! pitiful and great was the slaughter throughout Moy-Ailbhe afterwards. A cleric was not spared more than a layman, there[Pg 424] they were all equally killed. When a layman or a clergyman was spared it was not out of mercy, it was done but out of covetousness, to obtain a ransom from them, or to bring them into servitude. King Cormac, however, escaped in the van of the first battalion, but the horse leaped into a trench and he fell off it. When a party of his people who were flying perceived this, they came to the King and put him up on his horse again. It was then he saw a foster son of his own, a noble of the Eoghanachts, Aedh by name, who was an adept in wisdom and jurisprudence and history and Latin; and the King said to him, \u0027Beloved son,\u0027 said he, \u0027do not cling by me, but take thyself out of it as well as thou canst; I told thee that I should be killed in this battle.\u0027 A few remained along with Cormac, and he came forward along the way on horseback, and the way was besmeared throughout with much blood of men and horses. The hind feet of his horse slipped on the slippery way in the track of blood, and the horse fell right back and [Cormac\u0027s] back and neck were both broken, and he said, when falling, \u0027In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum,\u0027 and he gave up the ghost; and the impious sons of malediction came and thrust spears through his body, and cut off his head. \n \n \"Although much was the slaying on Moy-Ailbhe to the east of the Barrow, yet the prowess of Leinster was not satiated with it, but they followed up the rout westwards across Slieve Mairgé, and slew many noblemen in that pursuit. \n \n \"In the very beginning of the battle Ceallach, son of Caroll, king of Ossory, and his son were killed at once. Dispersedly, however, others were killed from that out, both laity and clergy. There were many good clergymen killed in this battle, as were also many kings and chieftains. In it was slain Fogartach, son of Suibhne [Sweeny], an adept in philosophy and divinity, King of Kerry, and Ailell, son of Owen, the distinguished young sage and high-born nobleman, and Colman, Abbot of Cenn-Etigh, Chief Ollav of the judicature of Erin, and hosts of others also, quos longum est scribere.... \n \n \"Then a party came up to Fiann, having the head of Cormac with them, and \u0027t was what they said to Fiann, \u0027Life and health, O powerful victorious king, and Cormac\u0027s head to thee from us; and as is customary with kings raise thy thigh and put this head under it and press it with thy thigh.\u0027 Howsoever Flann spoke evil to them, it was not thanks he gave them. \u0027It was an enormous act,\u0027 said he, \u0027to have taken off the head of the holy bishop, but, however, I shall honour it instead of crushing it.\u0027 Fiann took the head into his hand and kissed it, and carried thrice round him the consecrated head of the holy bishop and martyr. The head was afterwards honourably carried away from him to the body where Meaenach, son of Shiel,[Pg 425] successor of Comhghall, was, and he carried the body of Cormac to Castledermot, where it was honourably interred, and where it performs signs and miracles. \n \n \"Why should not the heart repine and the mind sicken at this enormous deed; the killing and the mangling with horrid arms of this holy man, the most learned of all who came or shall come of the men of Erin for ever? The complete master in Gaedhlic and Latin, the archbishop most pious, most pure, miraculous in chastity and prayer, a proficient in law and in every wisdom, knowledge, and science, a paragon of poetry and learning, a head of charity and every virtue, a sage of education, and head-king of the whole of the two Munster provinces in his time!\" \n \n Gormly, the betrothed, but afterwards repudiated wife of Cormac, was also a poet, and there are many pieces ascribed to her. She was, as I mentioned, married to Caroll king of Leinster, who was severely wounded in this battle. He was carried home to be cured in his palace at Naas, and Gormly the queen was constant in her attendance on him. One day, however, as Caroll was becoming convalescent he fell to exulting over the mutilation of Cormac at which he had been present. The queen, who was sitting at the foot of his bed, rebuked him for it, and said that the body of a good man had been most unworthily desecrated. At this Caroll, who was still confined to bed, became angry and kicked her over with his foot in the presence of all her attendants and ladies. \n \n As her father, the High-king, would do nothing for her when she besought him to wipe out the insult, and procure her reparation from so unworthy a husband, her young kinsman Niall Glún-dubh, or the Black-Kneed, took up her cause, and obtained for her a separation from her husband and restoration of her dowry. When her husband was killed, the year after this, by the Danes, she married Niall, who in time succeeded to the throne as High-king of all Ireland, and who was one of the noblest of her monarchs. He was slain in the end by the Danes, and the monarchy passed away from the houses both of her father and her husband, and she, the daughter of one High-king, the wife of another, bewails in[Pg 426] her old age the poverty and neglect into which she had fallen. She dreamt one night that King Niall stood beside her, and she made a leap forwards to clasp him in her arms, but struck herself against the bed-post, and received a wound from which she never recovered.[9] Many of her poems are lamentations on her kinsman and husband Niall. They seem to have been current amongst the Highland as well as the Irish Gaels, for here is a specimen jotted down in phonetic spelling by the Scotch Dean Macgregor about the year 1512: \n \n \"Take, grey monk, thy foot away, \n Lift it off the grave of Neill! \n Too long thou heapest up the clay \n On him who cannot feel.[10] \n \n Monk, why must thou pile the earth \n O\u0027er the couch of noble Neill? \n Above my friend of gentle birth \n Thou strik\u0027st a churlish heel. \n \n Let him be, at least to-night, \n Mournful monk of croaking voice, \n Beneath thee lies my heart\u0027s delight, \n Who made me to rejoice. \n [Pg 427] \n Monk, remove thy foot, I say! \n Tread not on the sacred ground \n Where he is shut from me away, \n In cold and narrow bound! \n \n I am Gormly—king of men \n Was my father, Flann the brave. \n I charge thee, stand thou not again, \n Bald monk, upon his grave.\" \n \n Another poet of the ninth century was Flanagan, son of Ceallach, king of Bregia. He is quoted by the \"Four Masters.\"[11] One poem of his, of 112 lines, on the deaths of the kings of Ireland, is preserved in the Yellow Book of Lecan. \n \n Mailmura, of Fahan, whom the \"Four Masters\" call a great poet, was a contemporary of his, and wrote a poem on the Milesian Migrations.[12] \n \n Several other poets lived in the ninth century, the chief of whom was probably Flann mac Lonáin, for the \"Four Masters\" in recording his death style him \"the Virgil of the Scottic race, the chief ollamh of all the Gaels, the best poet that was in Ireland in his time.\" Eight of his poems, containing about one thousand lines, have survived. He was from the neighbourhood of Slieve Echtgé, or Aughty, in South Connacht. One of his poems records how Ilbrechtach the harper was travelling over these barren[Pg 428] mountains along with the celebrated poet Mac Liag, and, as they paused to rest on Croghan Head, Mac Liag surveyed the prospect beneath him, and said, \"Many a hill and lake and fastness is in this range; it were a great topographical knowledge to know them all.\" \"If Mac Lonáin were here,\" said the harper, \"he could name them all, and give the origin of their names as well.\" \"Let this fellow be taken and hanged,\" said Mac Liag. The harper begged respite till next day, and in the meantime Mac Lonáin comes up and recites a poem of one hundred and thirty-two lines beginning—Aoibhinn aoibhinn Echtgé árd. \n \n Amongst other things, he relates that he met a Dalcassian—i.e., one of Brian Boru\u0027s people from Clare—at Moy Finé in Galway, who had just finished serving twelve months with a man in that place, from whom he had received a cow and a cloak for payment. On his way home to the Dalcassians with his cloak and his cow he met the poet, and said to him— \n \n \"\u0027Sing to me the history of my country, \n It is sweet to my soul to hear it. \n \n Thereupon I sang for him the poem, \n Nor did he show himself the least loath: \n All that he had earned—not mean nor meagre— \n To me he gave it without deduction. \n \n The upright Dalcassians heard of this, \n They received him with honour in their assembly; \n They gave to him—the noble race— \n Ten cows for every quarter of his own cow.\u0027\" \n \n Mac Lonáin was the contemporary of Cormac mac Culinan, whom he eulogises. \n \n Some other poets of great note flourished during the Danish period, such as Cormac \"an Eigeas,\" who composed the celebrated poem to Muircheartach, or Murtagh of the Leather Cloaks,[13] son of the Niall so bitterly lamented by Gormly, on the occasion of his marching round Ireland, when he set out[Pg 429] from his palace at ancient Aileach near Derry, and returned to it again after levying tribute and receiving hostages from every king and sub-king in Ireland. This great O\u0027Neill well deserved a poet\u0027s praise, for having taken Sitric, the Danish lord of Dublin, Ceallachan of Munster, the king of Leinster, and the royal heir of Connacht as hostages, he, understanding well that in the interests of Ireland the High-kingship should be upheld, positively refused to follow the advice of his own clan and march on Tara, as they urged, to take hostages from Donagh the High-king. On the contrary, he actually sent of his own accord all those that had been given him during his circuit to this Donagh as supreme governor of Ireland. Donagh, on his part, not to be out-done in magnanimity, returned them again to Murtagh with the message that he, into whose hands they had been delivered, was the proper person to keep them. It was to commemorate this that Cormac wrote his poem of two hundred and fifty-six lines:— \n \n \"A Mhuircheartaigh Mheic Néill náir \n Ro ghabhais giallu Inse-Fáil.\"[14] \n \n But the names of the poets Cinaeth or Kenneth O\u0027Hartigan, and Eochaidh O\u0027Flynn, are the most celebrated amongst those of the tenth century. Allusions to and quotations from the first, who died in 975, are frequent, and nine or ten of his poems, containing some eight hundred lines, have been preserved perfect for us. Of O\u0027Flynn\u0027s pieces, fourteen are enumerated by O\u0027Reilly, containing in the aggregate between seventeen and eighteen hundred lines. In them we find in verse the whole early and mythical history of Ireland. We have, for instance, one poem on the invasion of Partholan; one on the invasion of the Fomorians; another on the division of Ireland between the sons of Partholan; another on the destruction of the tower of Conaing and the battles between[Pg 430] the Fomorians and the Nemedians; another on the journey of the Nemedians from Scithia and how some emigrated to Greece and others to Britain after the destruction of Conairé\u0027s tower; another on the invasion of the sons of Milesius; another on the history of Emania built by Cimbaeth some three hundred years before Christ, up to its destruction by the Three Collas in the year 331. This poet in especial may be said to have crystallised into verse the mythic history of Ireland with the names and reigns of the Irish kings, and to have thrown them into the form of real history. O\u0027Clery, in his celebrated Book of Invasions, has drawn upon him very largely, quoting, often at full length, no less than twelve of his poems. Hence many people believe that he was one of the first to collect the floating tribe-legends of very early Irish kings, and the race-myths of the Tuatha De Danann and their contemporaries, and that he cast them into that historical shape in which the later annalists record them, by fitting them into a complete scheme of genealogical history like that of the Old Testament. But whether all these things had taken solid shape and form before he versified them anew we cannot now decide. According to O\u0027Reilly and O\u0027Curry this poet died in 984, nine years after O\u0027Hartigan; but M. d\u0027Arbois de Jubainville remarks that he has been unable to find out any evidence for fixing upon this date. \n \n A little later lived Mac Liag, whom Brian Boru elevated to the rank of Arch-Ollamh of Erin, and who lived at his court at Kincora in the closest relationship to him and his sons. He has been credited—erroneously according to O\u0027Curry—with the authorship of a Life of Brian Boru, which unfortunately has perished, only a single ancient leaf, in the hand-writing of the great antiquary Mac Firbis, surviving. Several of his poems, however, are preserved,[15] containing[Pg 431] between twelve and thirteen hundred lines in all, and are of the highest value as throwing light both on the social state and the policy of Ireland under Brian. One of his poems gives a graphic description of the tribute of Ireland being driven to Brian at his palace in Kincora in the present county of Clare. The poet went out from the court to have a look at the flocks and herds, and when he returned he said to the King, \"Here comes Erin\u0027s tribute of cows to thee, many a fat cow and fat hog on the plain before thee.\" \"Be they ever so many,\" said the King, \"they shall be all thine, thou noble poet.\" Amongst the other part of the tribute which the poet describes as coming in to Brian were one hundred and fifty butts of wine from the Danes of Dublin, and a tun of wine for every day in the year from the Danes of Limerick. He describes Brian as sitting at the head of the great hall of Kincora,[16] the king of Connacht sat on his right hand and the king of Ulster on his left; the king of Tir-Eóghain [Tyrone] sat opposite to him. At the door-post nearest to Brian sat the king of Leinster, and at the other post of the open door sat Donough, son of Brian, and Malachy,[17] king of Meath. Murrough, the king\u0027s eldest son who died so valiantly at Clontarf, sat in front of his father with his back turned to him, with Angus, a prince of Meath, and the king of Tirconnell on his left. One of his poems ends with two complimentary stanzas to Brian Boru, his son Murrough, his nephew Conaing, and Tadhg [Teig] O\u0027Kelly, the king of Ui Máine—all four of whom a short time afterwards were left stiff and stark upon the field of Clontarf. \n \n The shadow of the bloody tragedy there enacted hangs heavily over all Mac Liag\u0027s later poems and those of his contemporaries, and there are few more pathetic pieces in the language than his wail over Kincora left desolate by the death[Pg 432] of almost every chieftain who had gone forth from it to meet the Danes. \n \n \"Oh where, Kincora, is Brian the great! \n Oh, where is the beauty that once was thine! \n Oh, where are the princes and nobles that sate \n At the feast in thy halls, and drank the red wine.[18] \n Where, oh, Kincora? \n \n * * * * * \n \n And where is the youth of majestic height, \n The faith-keeping prince of the Scots? Even he \n As wide as his fame was, as great as his might, \n Was tributary, oh, Kincora, to me! \n Me, oh, Kincora. \n \n They are gone, those heroes of royal birth, \n Who plundered no churches, who broke no trust; \n \u0027Tis weary for me to be living on earth \n When they, oh, Kincora, lie low in the dust! \n Low, oh, Kincora.\"[19] \n \n In the same strain does Mac Gilla Keefe,[20] another contemporary poet, lament, in a piece which, according to a manuscript quoted by Hardiman, called the \"Leabhar Oiris,\"[Pg 433] he composed when in the north of Greece, whither he had travelled in the itinerant Milesian manner on his way to try if he could find the site of Paradise. The poem begins:— \n \n \"Mournful night! and mournful WE! \n Men we BE who know no peace. \n We no GOLD for STRAINS of PRIDE \n HOLD this SIDE the PLAINS of Greece.\"[21] \n \n \"\u0027I remember my setting my face to pay a visit to Brian (Boru) and he at that time feasting with Cian, the son of Mulloy,[22] and he thought it long my being absent from him.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027God welcome you back to us,\u0027 cried Cian, \u0027O learned one, who comest [back from the north] from the House of O\u0027Neill. Poet, your wife is saying that you have almost altogether forsaken your own house.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027You have been away for three quarters of year, except from yesterday to to-day.\u0027 \u0027Why that,\u0027 said Murrough, son of Brian, \u0027is the message of the raven from the ark!\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027[Come now] tell us all the wealth you have brought from the north,\u0027 said Brian, the High-king of the host of Carn i Neid, \u0027tell the nobles of the men of Innisfail, and swear by my hand that you tell no lie.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027By the King who is above me,\u0027 [said I], \u0027this is what I brought from the north, twenty steeds, ten ounces of gold, and ten score cows of cattle.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027[Why] we, the two of us, shall give him more steeds and more cattle [than that] without speaking of what Brian will give,\u0027 said Cian, the son of Mulloy. \n \n \"\u0027[And] by the King of Heaven who has brought me into silence this night, and who has darkened my brightness, I got ten times as much as that at the banquet before Brian lay down. \n \n [Pg 434] \n \n \"\u0027I got seven town-lands, Oh, King of the Kings, who hast sent me from the west, and a half town-land [besides] near every palace in which Brian used to be.\u0027 \n \n \"Said Murrough, good son of Brian, \u0027To-morrow\u0027—and it was scarce sensible for him—\u0027as much as you have got last night you shall get from me myself, and get it with my love.\u0027\"[23] \n \n Mag Liag was not at Clontarf himself, but his friend and fellow-poet, Errard mac Coisé [C?sha] was in the train of Malachy, king of Meath, to whom he was then attached. This poet gave Mac Liag a minute account of the battle, and Mac Liag himself visited the spot before the slain had been interred, as we see from another of his poems. In a kind of dialogue between him and Mac Coisé he makes the latter relate to him the names of the fallen, and describe the positions in which their dead bodies were found upon the battlefield. It is exceedingly probable that it was Mac Liag, perhaps with Mac Coisé\u0027s aid, who compiled that most valuable chronicle called the \"Wars of the Gael with the Gaill,\" i.e., of the Irish with the Northmen.[24] This narrative bears both external and internal evidence of its antiquity, for there is a portion of it preserved in the Book of Leinster, a MS. of about the year 1150. \"The author,\" says Dr. Todd, who has edited it,[25] \"was either[Pg 435] himself an eye-witness of the battle of Clontarf, or else compiled his narrative from the testimony of eye-witnesses.\" It is edited in 121 chapters, and is sufficiently long to fill over a hundred of these pages. Beginning with the earliest Danish invasion at the close of the eighth century, it traces the progress of the Northmen in forty chapters up to the time when Mathgamhain [Mahon] and Brian were ruling over the Dalcassians. After that the book concerns itself chiefly with the history of Brian, describing the deaths of his brother Mahon, and the revenge he took, and his gradual but irregular attainment of the High-kingship, he being the first of the race of Eber who had reached this dignity for hundreds of years. The distress suffered by the Irish at the hands of the white foreigners (the Norwegians) and the black foreigners (the Danes)—who, by the way, were bitter enemies and often fought with each other, even on Irish soil—is graphically described. The Northmen put, says the writer, \n \n \"a king [of their own] over every territory, and a chief over every chieftaincy, and an abbot over every church, and a steward over every village, and a soldier in every house, so that none of the men of Erin had power to give even the milk of his cow, or as much as the clutch[Pg 436] of eggs of one hen in succour or in kindness to an aged man or to a friend, but was forced to preserve them for this foreign steward or bailiff or soldier. And though there were but one milk-giving cow in the house, she durst not be milked for an infant of one night, nor for a sick person, but must be kept for the steward or bailiff or soldier of the foreigners. And however long he might be absent from the house his share or his supply durst not be lessened: although there were in the house but one cow, it must be killed for the meal of one night, if the means of supply could not be otherwise procured.... \n \n \"In a word,\" continues the writer in a strain of characteristic hyperbole, \"although there were an hundred sharp, ready, cool, never-resting, brazen tongues in each head, and a hundred garrulous, loud-unceasing voices from each tongue, they could not recount nor narrate, nor enumerate, nor tell, what all the Gael suffered in common, both men and women, laity and clergy, old and young, noble and ignoble, of hardship and of injury, and of oppression in every house, from these valiant, wrathful, foreign, purely-pagan people. \n \n \"And though numerous were the oft-victorious clans of the many-familied Erin,\" yet could they do nothing against the \"untamed, implacable hordes by whom that oppression was inflicted, because of the excellence of their polished, ample, treble-heavy, trusty, glittering corslets, and their hard, strong, valiant swords, and well-rivetted long spears, and ready brilliant arms of valour, besides; and because of the greatness of their achievements and of their deeds, their bravery, their valour, their strength, their venom, and their ferocity, and because of the excess of their thirst and their hunger for the brave, fruitful, nobly-inhabited, smooth-plained, sweet-grassy land of Erin, full of cataracts, rivers, bays.\" \n \n The book ends with the battle of Clontarf and the \"return from Fingall,\" i.e., the march of the Dalcassians to their homes in Munster. The death of Brian in this great battle fought on Good Friday, the 23rd of April,[26] 1014, is thus described:— \n \n [Pg 437] \n \n DEATH OF BRIAN BORUMHA AT CLONTARF. \n \n \"As for Brian, son of Cenneidigh [Kennedy], when the battalions joined arms in the battle, his skin was spread for him, and he opened his psalter and joined his hands, and began to pray after the battle had commenced, and there was no one with him but his own attendant, whose name was Latean (from whom are the O\u0027Lateans still in Munster.)[27] Brian said to the attendant, \u0027Look thou at the battalions and the combat whilst I sing the psalms.\u0027 He sang fifty psalms and fifty prayers and fifty paternosters, and after that he asked the attendant how were the battalions. And the attendant answered, \u0027Mixed and closely confronted are the battalions, and each of them has come within the grasp of the other, and not louder on my ears would be the echo of blows from Tomar\u0027s wood if seven battalions were cutting it down, than the thud-blows on heads and bones and sculls between them.\u0027 And he asked how was Murchadh\u0027s [Murrough\u0027s son\u0027s] standard, and the attendant said, \u0027It stands, and many of the banners of the Dál Cais [North Munster, i.e., Brian\u0027s own men] around it, and many heads thrown to it, and a multitude of trophies and spoils with heads of foreigners are along with it.\u0027 \u0027That is good news indeed,\u0027 said Brian. \n \n \"His skin cushion was readjusted beneath him, and he sang the psalms and the prayers and the paters as before, and he again asked the attendant how the battalions were, and the attendant answered and said, \u0027There is not living on earth the man who could distinguish one from the other, for the greater part of the hosts on each side are fallen, and those who are alive are so covered with spatterings of crimson blood and armour, that a man could not know his own son—they are so intermingled.\u0027 He then asked how was Murchadh\u0027s standard. The attendant said it was far from him, and that it passed through the battalions westward, and was still standing. Brian said, \u0027The men of Erin will be well,\u0027 said he, \u0027so long as that standard stands, for their courage and valour shall remain in them all, so long as they can see that standard.\u0027 \n \n \"His cushion was readjusted under Brian, and he sang fifty psalms and fifty prayers and fifty paters, and all that time the fighting continued. After that he again asked the attendant how went the battalions, and the attendant answered, \u0027It is like as if Tomar\u0027s wood were after burning its undergrowth and young trees, and that seven battalions had been for six weeks cutting them down, and it with its stately trees and huge oaks still standing, just so are the battalions on both sides, after the greater part of them have fallen leaving but a few valiant heroes and great chieftains still standing. So are[Pg 438] the battalions on both sides pierced and wounded and scattered, and they are disorganised all round like the grindings of a mill turning the wrong way; and the foreigners are now defeated, and Murchadh\u0027s standard is fallen.\u0027 \u0027That is piteous news,\u0027 said Brian; \u0027by my word,\u0027 said he, \u0027the generosity and valour of Erin fell when that standard fell; and truly Erin has fallen of that, for there shall never come after him a champion like him. And what the better were I though I should escape this, and though it were the sovereignty of the world I should attain, after the fall of Murchadh and Conaing and the other nobles of the Dál Cais.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Woe is me,\u0027 said the attendant, \u0027if thou wouldst take my advice thou wouldst get thee to thy horse, and we would go to the camp and remain there amongst the gillies, and every one who comes out of the battle will come to us, and round us they will rally, for the battalions are now mixed in confusion, and a party of the foreigners have rejected the idea of retreating to the sea, and we know not who shall come to us where we now are.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Oh God; boy,\u0027 said Brian, \u0027flight becomes me not, and I myself know that I shall not go from here alive, and what should it profit me though I did, for Aoibheall [Eevil][28] of Craig Liath [Lee-a], came to me last night,\u0027 said he, \u0027and she told me that the first of my sons whom I should see this day would be he who should succeed me in the sovereignty, and that is Donough,[29] and go thou OLatean,\u0027 said he, \u0027and take these steeds with thee, and receive my blessing and carry out my will after me, that is to say, my body and soul to God and to St. Patrick, and that I am to be carried to Armagh, and my blessing to Donough for discharging my last bequests after me, that is to say, twelve score cows to be given to the co-arb of Patrick and the Society of Armagh, and their own proper dues to Killaloe and the Churches of Munster, and he knows that I have not wealth of gold or silver, but he is to pay them in return for my blessing and for his succeeding me. Go this night to Sord [Swords] and desire them to come to-morrow early for my body, and to convey it thence to Damhliag of Cianan, and then let them carry it to Lughmhagh [Loo-wā, i.e., Louth], and let Maelmuiré mac Eochadha, the co-arb of Patrick and the Society of Armagh come to meet me at Lughmhagh.\u0027 \n \n \"While they were engaged in this conversation the attendant perceived a party of the foreigners approaching them. The Earl Brodar was there and two warriors along with him. \n \n \"\u0027There are people coming towards us here,\u0027 said the attendant. \n \n [Pg 439] \n \n \"\u0027What kind of people?\u0027 said Brian. \n \n \"\u0027Blue stark-naked people,\u0027 said the attendant. \n \n \"\u0027My woe,\u0027 said Brian, \u0027they are the foreigners of the armour, and it is not for good they come.\u0027 \n \n \"While he was saying this he arose and stepped off his cushion and unsheathed his sword. Brodar passed him by and noticed him not. One of the three who were there and who had been in Brian\u0027s service said \u0027Cing, Cing!\u0027 said he, that is, \u0027This is the king.\u0027 \u0027No, no! but príst príst,\u0027 says Brodar, \u0027not he,\u0027 said he, \u0027but a noble priest.\u0027 \u0027By no means,\u0027 said the soldier, \u0027but it is the great king Brian.\u0027 Brodar then turned round and appeared with a bright gleaming battle-axe in his hand, with the handle set in the middle [of the head]. When Brian saw him he looked intently at him, and gave him a sword-blow that cut off the left leg at the knee and the right leg at the foot. The foreigner gave Brian a stroke which crushed his head utterly, and Brian killed the second man that was with Brodar, and they fell mutually by each other. \n \n \"There was not done in Erin, since Christianity—except the beheading of Cormac mac Culinan—any greater deed than this. He was, in sooth, one of the three best that ever were born in Erin, and one of the three men who most caused Erin to prosper, namely, Lugh the Long-handed, and Finn mac Cúmhail [Cool], and Brian, son of Kennedy; for it was he that released the men of Erin and its women from the bondage and iniquity of the foreigners and the pirates. It was he that gained five-and-twenty battles over the foreigners, and who killed them and banished them.... In short, Erin fell by the death of Brian.\" \n \n The \"War of the Gael with the Gaill\" appears to me to be a book which throws a strong light upon the genesis and value of the historical saga of Ireland. Here is a real historical narrative of unquestionable authority, and of the very highest value for the history of these countries, which is contemporaneous,[30] or almost so, with the events which it relates. Its accuracy on matters of fact have been abundantly proved from Danish as well as from Irish sources. And yet the whole[Pg 440] account is dressed up and bedizened in that peculiarly Irish garb which had become stereotyped as the dress of Irish history. It contains the exaggeration, the necessary touch of the marvellous, and above all the poetry, without which no Irish composition could hope for a welcome. \n \n First as to the exaggeration: the whole piece is full of it. A good example is the description of the armies meeting on Clontarf:— \n \n \"It will be one of the wonders of the day of judgment to relate the description of this tremendous onset. There arose a wild, impetuous, precipitate, furious, dark, frightful, voracious, merciless, combative, contentious vulture, screaming and fluttering over their heads. There arose also the Bocanachs and the Bananachs and the wild people of the glens, and the witches and the goblins and the ancient birds, and the destroying demons of the air and firmament, and the feeble demoniac phantom host, and they were screaming and comparing the valour and combat of both parties.\" \n \n The reader expected some traditional flourish such as this, and the essential truth of the narrative is no whit impaired by it. \n \n Nor does the miraculous episode of Dunlang O\u0027Hartigan, fresh from the embraces of the fairy queen, foretelling to Murrough that he must fall, detract from the truth that he does fall. Dunlang had promised Murrough not to abandon him, and he appears beside him on the very eve of the battle. Murrough gently reproaches him and says:— \n \n \"\u0027Great must be the love and attachment of some woman for thee which has induced thee to abandon me.\u0027 \u0027Alas, O King,\u0027 answered Dunlang, \u0027the delight which I have abandoned for thee is greater, if thou didst but know it, namely, life without death,[31] without cold,[Pg 441] without thirst, without hunger, without decay, beyond any delight of the delights of the earth to me, until the judgment, and heaven after the judgment, and if I had not pledged my word to thee I would not have come here, and, moreover, it is fated for me to die on the day that thou shalt die.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Shall I receive death this day then?\u0027 said Murrough. \n \n \"\u0027Thou shalt, indeed,\u0027 said Dunlang, \u0027and Brian and Conaing shall receive it, and almost all the nobles of Erin, and Turlough thy son.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027That is no good encouragement to fight,\u0027 said Murrough, \u0027and if we had had such news we would not have told it to thee, and moreover,\u0027 said Murrough, \u0027often was I offered in hills, and in fairy mansions, this world and these gifts, but I never abandoned for one night my country nor mine inheritance for them.\u0027\" \n \n Some such touch as this, of the weird and the miraculous, the reader also expected. \n \n As for poetry, the whole piece is full of it. It contains over five hundred lines of verse, in poems attributed to Brian Boru himself and his brother Mahon, to Maelmhuadh or Molloy, who so treacherously slew Mahon, to the sister of Aedh Finnliath [Finleea], king of Ireland in 869;[32] to Cormac mac Culinan, the king-bishop; to Cuan O\u0027Lochain, a great poet who died in 1024; to Beg mac Dé the prophet, and to Columcille, his contemporary; to Colman mac Lenin, the poet-saint; to Gilla Mududa O\u0027Cassidy, a poet contemporaneous with Mac Liag; to Mac Liag himself; to Gilla Comgaill O\u0027Slevin, inciting O\u0027Neill against Brian; to a poet called Mahon\u0027s blind man; to St. Bercan the prophet; to an unnamed cleric, and to at least six anonymous poets. \n \n I have dwelt at some length upon these peculiarities of composition, because I wish to lay stress on the fact that the narrative form and the romantic dress in which the early history of Ireland is preserved (through the medium of sagas) need not[Pg 442] detract from its substantial veracity. We can prove the minute accuracy of the Clontarf story and there seems scarcely more reason to doubt that of the battle of Moyrath, fought in Adamnan\u0027s time, or possibly the substantial accuracy of the battles of Cnoca, or of Moy Léana; we must, however, remember that with each fresh redaction, fresh miraculous agencies, and fresh verbiage were added. \n \n The battle of Clontarf put an end to the dream of a Danish kingdom in Ireland, and though numerous bodies of the Northmen remained in their sea-coast settlements, and continued for many years after this to give much trouble, yet it put a stop to all further invasion from their mother country, and once more the centres of Irish learning and civilisation could breathe freely. \n ******** \n [1] It was not he, however, who built Cormac\u0027s Chapel at Cashel, but Cormac Mac Carthy, in the twelfth century. I am not sure whether Cashel had been formed into an archiepiscopal see at this time, but he is certainly called bishop of Cashel. \n \n [2] The celebrated Vocabularius S. Galli was, according to Zimmer, the work of an Irish monk. \n \n [3] Leabhar na gCeart. \n \n [4] It has been most carefully edited and translated in a large volume by O\u0027Donovan for the Celtic Society, in 1847. \n \n [5] 903 according to the \"Four Masters.\" \n \n [6] From the fragment copied by Duald Mac Firbis in 1643 from a vellum MS. of Mac Egan of Ormond, a chief professor of the old Brehon Law, a MS. which was so worn as to be in places illegible at the time Mac Firbis copied it; published by O\u0027Donovan for the Arch?ological Society. I have altered O\u0027Donovan\u0027s translation very slightly. \n \n [7] In Irish, \"Flaithbheartach.\" \n \n [8] The plain where this battle of Bealach Múghna or Ballaghmoon was fought is in the very south of the county Kildare, about 2? miles to the north of the town of Carlow. \n \n [9] So it is stated in Mac Echagain\u0027s Annals of Clonmacnois, but O\u0027Curry thinks this is a mistake and that she did recover. \n \n [10] The first verse runs thus in modern Gaelic: \n \n \"Beir a mhanaigh leat do chos \n Tóg anois i de thaoibh Néill \n Is ró mhór chuiris de chré \n Ar an té le\u0027 luidhinn féin.\" \n \n See p. 75 of the Gaelic part of the book of the Dean of Lismore. \n \n Literally: \"Monk, remove thy foot, lift it off the grave of Niall, too long heapest thou the earth on him by whom I fain would lie! \n \n \"Too long dost thou, O monk there, heap the earth on noble Niall. Go gently, brown friend, press not the earth with thy sole. \n \n \"Do not firmly close the grave; sorrowful, cleric, is thy office; lift [thy foot] off the bright Niall Black-knee; monk, remove thy foot! \n \n \"The son of the descendant of Niall of the white gold, \u0027tis not of my will that he is bound [in the grave]; let his grave and stone be left: monk, remove thy foot! \n \n \"I am Gormly, who compose the verse; daughter of hardy Flann. Stand not upon his grave! Monk, remove thy foot!\" \n \n [11] One of his pieces, quoted by the \"Four Masters,\" shows he was a true poet. It is on the death of the king, Aedh Finnliath, who died in 877, and runs thus:— \n \n \"Long is the wintry night, \n With fierce gusts of wind, \n Under pressing grief we have to encounter it, \n Since the red-speared king of the noble house lives no longer. \n \n It is awful to observe \n The waves from the bottom heaving, \n To these may be compared \n All those who with us lament him.\" \n \n See O\u0027Curry\u0027s \"Manners and Customs,\" vol. ii. p. 96, and \"Four Masters\" sub anno. \n \n [12] Published by the Irish Arch?ological Society in the \"Irish Nennius,\" in 1847. \n \n [13] Na gcochal croicinn. \n \n [14] \"O Muircheartach, son of noble Niall, \n Thou hast taken hostages of Inisfail.\" \n \n [15] The \"Four Masters\" thought so highly of Mac Liag\u0027s poetry that they actually go out of their way to record both the first verse he ever composed and the last. An extraordinary compliment! \n \n [16] Or Kancora, in Irish Ceann Coradh—i.e., \"the head of the weir.\" \n \n [17] In Irish \"Maelsheachlainn,\" often contracted into the sound of \"M\u0027louglinn,\" and now always Anglicised Malachy. \n \n [18] Thus Mangan; in the original— \n \n \"A Chinn-Choradh, caidhi Brian, \n No caidhi an sciamh do bhi ort; \n Caidhi maithe no meic righ \n Ga n-ibhmís fín ad port?\" \n \n [19] Literally: \"O Kincora, where is Brian? or where is the splendour that was upon thee? Where are the nobles and the sons of kings with whom we used to drink wine in thy halls.... Where is the man most striking of size, the son of the king of Alba who never forsook us? Although great were his valour and his deeds, he used to pay tribute to me (the poet), O Kincora.... They have gone, side by side, the sons of kings who never plundered church; there shall never be their like in the world again, so in my wisdom I testify, O Kincora.\" \n \n See Hardiman\u0027s \"Irish Minstrelsy,\" vol. ii. p. 196, where the text of this poem is published, with a fearful metrical translation which, under the influence of Macpherson, calls the Dalcassian princes \"the flower of Temora\"! which, however, is advantageously used to rhyme with Kincora! \n \n [20] In Irish: \"Mac Giolla Caoimh.\" \n \n [21] This verse is an imitation of the original, which runs— \n \n \"Uathmhar [i] an oidhche anocht \n A chuideacht [fhíor-]bhocht gan bhréig, \n Crodh ni SA[O]ILT? dh[ao]ibh air DHUAN \n Air an TTAOIBHSI THUAIDH do\u0027n nGréig.\" \n \n See Hardiman\u0027s \"Irish Minstrelsy,\" vol. ii. p. 202, where a poetical version of this lyric is given in the metre of Campbell\u0027s \"Exile of Erin\"! He does not say from what MS. he has taken this poem. O\u0027Curry is silent on Mac Gilla Keefe, but O\u0027Reilly mentions another poem of his on the provinces of Munster. \n \n [22] In Irish, \"Maolmhuadh.\" \n \n [23] I am not sure that I have translated this correctly. \n \n \"Do rádh Murchadh deagh-mhac Bhriain \n Air na mhárach, \u0027s níor chiall uaidh \n Uiriod a bhfuairís aréir \n Geabhair uaim féin\u0027s ni air th-fhuath.\" \n \n [24] Charles O\u0027Conor ascribes it to him, but neither Keating, the \"Four Masters,\" nor Colgan, who all make use of it, mention a word about the author. \n \n [25] In the \"Master of the Rolls\" Series, in 1867. \"That the work was compiled from contemporary materials,\" says Dr. Todd, \"may be proved by curious incidental evidence. It is stated in the account given of the Battle of Clontarf that the full tide in Dublin Bay on the day of the battle (23rd April, 1014) coincided with sunrise, and that the returning tide at evening aided considerably in the defeat of the enemy. It occurred to the editor, on considering this passage, that a criterion might be derived from it to test the truth of the narrative and of the date assigned by the Irish Annals to the Battle of Clontarf. He therefore proposed to the Rev. Samuel Haughton, M.D., Fellow of Trinity College, and Professor of Geology in the University of Dublin, to solve for him this problem: \u0027What was the hour of high water at the shore of Clontarf in Dublin Bay on the 23rd of April, 1014.\u0027 The editor did not make known to Dr. Haughton the object he had in view in this question, and the coincidence of the result obtained with the ancient narrative is therefore the more valuable and curious.\" \n \n Dr. Haughton read a paper on the mathematics of this complex and difficult question before the Royal Irish Academy, in May, 1861, in which he proved that the tide—a neap tide—was full along the Clontarf shore at about 5h. 30m. a.m., and that the evening tide was full in about 5h. 55m. p.m. \"The truth of the narrative,\" says Dr. Todd, \"is thus most strikingly established. In the month of April the sun rises at from 5h. 30m. to 4h.30m. The full tide in the morning therefore coincided nearly with sunrise; a fact which holds a most important place in the history of the battle, and proves that our author if not himself an eye-witness, must have derived his information from those who were. \u0027None others,\u0027 as Dr. Haughton observes, \u0027would have invented the fact that the battle began at sunrise and that the tide was then full in. The importance of the time of tide became evident at the close of the day, when the returned tide prevented the escape of the Danes from the Clontarf shore to the north bank of the Liffey.\u0027\" \n \n [26] An ancient Irish missal preserved in the Bodleian contains this petition for the Irish king and his army, in its Litany for Easter Eve: \"Ut regem Hibernensium et exercitum ejus conservare digneris—ut eis vitam et sanctitatem atque victoriam dones.\" If this missal is posterior to 1014 it must have been the reminiscence of Clontarf which inspired the prayer for the day following the battle. If the missal is older than the battle, then the coincidence is curious. The prayer was just a day late. The same missal mentions in its Litanies the names Patrick, Brendan, Brigit, Columba, Finnian, Ciaran, and St. Fursa, and contains collect, secret and post communion pro rege [for the Irish king]. \n \n [27] Evidently the interpolation of a copyist. \n \n [28] The family banshee of the Royal house of Munster. \n \n [29] In Irish, Donnchadh, pronounced \"Dunn?χa,\" as Murchadh is pronounced \"Murr?χa,\" in English Murrough. \n \n [30] It is edited from the Book of Leinster, a MS. which was copied about 1150, which contains the first 28 chapters, from a vellum of about two centuries later, which wants five chapters at the beginning and eight at the end, and from a perfect transcript made by the indefatigable Brother Michael O\u0027Clery in 1635 \"out of the book of Cuconnacht O\u0027Daly,\" who died according to the \"Four Masters,\" in 1139. \n \n [31] I.e., Beside his fairy lover. This incident is greatly expanded in the modern MS. story of the Battle of Clontarf, of which there exist numerous copies; in these the gliding of history into romance is very apparent. In the modern version the fairy Aoibheall is introduced begging O\u0027Hartigan not to fight and promising him life and happiness for two hundred years if he will put off fighting for only one day. \n \n \"A Dhunlaing seachain an cath \n Gus an mhaidin amárach. \n Geobhair da chéad bliadhan de ré \n Agus seachain cath aon-laé.\" \n \n [32] This is genuine, and is also quoted by the \"Four Masters\" and O\u0027Clery in his Book of Invasions. Probably all the poems are genuine except the prophecies and the pieces put into the mouths of the actors, that is of Brian, Mahon, Molloy, and the cleric. These were probably composed by the writer of the history. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703/50199.html","bookId":1150,"book":{"id":1150,"title":"A Literary History of Ireland","description":"简介： The present volume has been styledin order to make it a companion book to other of Mr. Unwin\u0027s publicationsa Literary History of Ireland, but a Literary History of Irish Ireland would be a more correct title, for I have abstained altogether from any...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM"}}
