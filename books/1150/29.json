{"id":16612,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII OTHER SAGAS OF THE RED BRANCH","content":"Another saga belonging to this cycle affords so curious a picture of pagan customs that it is worth while to give here some extracts from it. This is the story of Mac Dáthó\u0027s Pig and Hound, which is contained in the Book of Leinster, a MS. copied about the year 1150. It was first published without a translation by Windisch in his \"Irische Texte,\" from the Book of Leinster copy collated with two others. It has since been translated by Kuno Meyer from a fifteenth-century vellum.[1] The story runs as follows. Mac Dáthó was a famous landholder in Leinster, and he possessed a hound so extraordinarily strong and swift that it could run round Leinster in a day. All Ireland was full of the fame of that hound, and every one desired to have it. It struck Mève and Oilioll, king and queen of Connacht, to send an embassy to Mac Dáthó to ask him for his hound, at the same time that the notion came to Conor, king of Ulster, that he also would like to possess it. Two embassies reach Mac Dáthó\u0027s house at the same time, the one from Connacht and the other from Ulster, and both ask for the hound for their respective masters. Mac Dáthó\u0027s house was one of those open[Pg 355] hostelries[2] of which there were five at that time in Ireland. \"Seven doors,\" says the saga, \"there were in each hostelry, seven roads through it, and seven fireplaces therein. Seven caldrons in the seven fireplaces. An ox and a salted pig would go into each of these caldrons, and the man that came along the road would (i.e., any traveller who passed the way was entitled to) thrust the flesh fork into the caldron, and whatever he brought up with the first thrust, that he would eat, and if nothing were brought up with the first thrust there was no other for him.\" The messengers are brought before Mac Dáthó to his bed, and questioned as to the cause of their coming. \"\u0027To ask for the hound are we come,\u0027 said the messengers of Connacht, \u0027from Oilioll and from Mève, and in exchange for it there shall be given three score hundred milch cows at once, and a chariot with the two horses that are best in Connacht under it, and as much again at the end of the year besides all that.\u0027 \"\u0027We, too, have come to ask for it,\u0027 said the messengers of Ulster, \u0027and Conor is no worse a friend than Oilioll and Mève, and the same amount shall be given from the north (i.e., from the Ultonians) and be added to, and there will be good friendship from it continually.\u0027 \"Mac Dáthó fell into a great silence, and was three days and nights without sleeping, nor could he eat food for the greatness of his trouble, but was moving about from one side to another. It was then his wife addressed him and said, \u0027Long is the fast in which thou art,\u0027 said she; \u0027there is plenty of food by thee, though thou dost not eat it.\u0027 \"And then she said— \"\u0027Sleeplessness was brought To Mac Dáthó into his house. There was something on which he deliberated Though he speaks to none.[3] He turns away from me to the wall, The Hero of the Féne of fierce valour, His prudent wife observes That her mate is without sleep.\u0027\" A dialogue in verse follows. The wife advises her husband[Pg 356] to promise the hound to both sets of messengers. In his perplexity he weakly decides to do this. After the messengers had stayed with him for three nights and days, feasting, he called to him first the envoys of Connacht and said to them— \"\u0027I was in great doubt and perplexity, and this is what is grown out of it, that I have given the hound to Oilioll and Mève, and let them come for it splendidly and proudly, with as many warriors and nobles as they can get, and they shall have drink and food and many gifts besides, and shall take the hound and be welcome.\u0027 \"He also went with the messengers of Ulster and said to them, \u0027After much doubting I have given the hound to Conor, and let him and the flower of the province come for it proudly, and they shall have many other gifts and you shall be welcome.\u0027 But for one and the same day he made his tryst with them all.\" Accordingly on the appointed day the warriors and men of each province arrive at his hostelry in great state and pomp. \"He himself went to meet them and bade them welcome. \u0027\u0027Tis welcome ye are, O warriors,\u0027 said he, \u0027come within into the close.\u0027 \"Then they went over, and into the hostelry; one half of the house for the men of Connacht and the other half for the men of Ulster. That house was not a small one. Seven doors in it and fifty beds between (every) two doors. Those were not faces of friends at a feast, the people who were in that house, for many of them had injured other. For three hundred years before the birth of Christ there had been war between them.[4] \"\u0027Let the pig be killed for them,\u0027 said Mac Dáthó.\" This celebrated pig had been fed for seven years on the milk of three score milch cows, and it was so huge that it took sixty men to draw it when slain. Its tail alone was a load for nine men. \"\u0027The pig is good,\u0027\" said Conor, king of Ulster. \"\u0027It is good,\u0027\" said Oilioll, king of Connacht. Then there arose a difficulty about the dividing of the pig. As in the case of the \"heroes\u0027 bit\" the best warrior was to[Pg 357] divide it. King Oilioll asked King Conor what they should do about it, when suddenly the mischievous, ill-minded Bricriu spoke from a chamber overhead and asked, \"How should it be divided except by a contest of arms seeing that all the valorous warriors of Connacht were there.\" \"\u0027Let it be so,\u0027 said Oilioll. \"\u0027We like it well,\u0027 said Conor, \u0027for we have lads in the house who have many a time gone round the border.\u0027 \"\u0027There will be need of thy lads to-night, O Conor,\u0027 said a famous old warrior from Cruachna Conalath in the west. \u0027The roads of Luachra Dedad have often had their backs turned to them (as they fled). Many, too, the fat beeves they left with me.\u0027 \"\u0027\u0027Twas a fat beef thou leftest with me,\u0027 said Munremar mac Gerrcind, \u0027even thine own brother, Cruithne mac Ruaidlinde from Cruachna Conalath of Connacht.\u0027 \"\u0027He was no better,\u0027 said Lewy mac Conroi, \u0027than Irloth, son of Fergus, son of Leite, who was left dead by Echbél, son of Dedad, at Tara Luachra.\u0027 \"\u0027What sort of man do ye think,\u0027 said Celtchair mac Uthechair, \u0027was Conganchnes, son of (that same) Dedad, who was slain by myself, and me to strike the head off him?\u0027 \"Each of them brought up his exploits in the face of the other, till at last it came to one man who beat every one, even Cet mac Mágach of Connacht.[5] \"He raised his prowess over the host, and took his knife in his hand, and sat down by the pig. \u0027Now let there be found,\u0027 said he, \u0027among the men of Ireland one man to abide contest with me, or let me divide the pig.\u0027 \"There was not at that time found a warrior of Ulster to stand up to him, and great silence fell upon them. \"\u0027Stop that for me, O Laeghaire [Leary],\u0027 said Conor, [King of Ulster, i.e., \u0027Delay, if you can, Cet\u0027s dividing the pig\u0027]. [Pg 358] \"Said Leary, \u0027It shall not be—Cet to divide the pig before the face of us all!\u0027 \"\u0027Wait a little, Leary,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027that thou mayest speak with me. For it is a custom with you men of Ulster that every youth among you who takes arms makes us his first goal.[6] Thou, too, didst come to the border, and thus leftest charioteer and chariot and horses with me, and thou didst then escape with a lance through thee. Thou shalt not get at the pig in that manner!\u0027 \"Leary sat down upon his couch. \"\u0027It shall not be,\u0027 said a tall, fair warrior of Ulster, coming out of his chamber above, \u0027that Cet divide the pig.\u0027 \"\u0027Who is this?\u0027 said Cet. \"\u0027A better warrior than thou,\u0027 say all, \u0027even Angus, son of Hand-wail of Ulster.\u0027 \"\u0027Why is his father called Hand-wail?\u0027 said Cet. \"\u0027We know not indeed,\u0027 say all. \"\u0027But I know,\u0027 said Cet; \u0027once I went eastward (i.e., crossed the border into Ulster), an alarm-cry is raised around me, and Hand-wail came up with me, like every one else. He makes a cast of a large lance at me. I make a cast at him with the same lance, which struck off his hand, so that it was (i.e., fell) on the field before him. What brings the son of that man to stand up to me?\u0027 said Cet. \"Then Angus goes to his couch. \"\u0027Still keep up the contest,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027or let me divide the pig.\u0027 \"\u0027It is not right that thou divide it, O Cet,\u0027 said another tall, fair warrior of Ulster. \"\u0027Who is this?\u0027 said Cet. \"\u0027Owen Mór, son of Durthacht,\u0027 say all, \u0027king of Fernmag.\u0027[7] \"\u0027I have seen him before,\u0027 said Cet. \"\u0027Where hast thou seen me,\u0027 said Owen. \"\u0027In front of thine own house when I took a drove of cattle from thee; the alarm cry was raised in the land around me, and thou didst meet me and didst cast a spear at me, so that it stood out of my shield. I cast the same spear at thee, which passed through thy[Pg 359] head and struck thine eye out of thy head, and the men of Ireland see thee with one eye ever since.\u0027 \"He sat down in his seat after that. \"\u0027Still keep up the contest, men of Ulster,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027or let me divide the pig.\u0027 \"\u0027Thou shalt not divide it,\u0027 said Munremar, son of Gerrcend. \"\u0027Is that Munremar?\u0027 said Cet. \"\u0027It is he,\u0027 say the men of Ireland. \"\u0027It was I who last cleaned my hands in thee, O Munremar,\u0027 said Cet; \u0027it is not three days yet since out of thine own land I carried off three warriors\u0027 heads from thee, together with the head of thy first son.\u0027 \"Munremar sat down on his seat. \"\u0027Still the contest,\u0027 said Cet,\u0027 or I shall divide the pig.\u0027 \"\u0027Verily thou shalt have it,\u0027 said a tall, grey, very terrible warrior of the men of Ulster. \"\u0027Who is this?\u0027 said Cet. \"\u0027That is Celtchair, son of Uithechar,\u0027 say all. \"\u0027Wait a little, Celtchair,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027unless thou comest to strike me. I came, O Celtchair, to the front of thy house. The alarm was raised around me. Every one went after me. Thou comest like every one else, and going into a gap before me didst throw a spear at me. I threw another spear at thee, which went through thy loins, nor has either son or daughter been born to thee since.\" \"After that Celtchair sat down on his seat. \"\u0027Still the contest,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027or I shall divide the pig.\u0027 \"\u0027Thou shalt have it,\u0027 said Mend, son of Sword-heel. \"\u0027Who is this?\u0027 said Cet. \"\u0027Mend,\u0027 say all. \"\u0027What! deem you,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027that the sons of churls with nicknames should come to contend with me? for it was I was the priest,[8] who christened thy father by that name, since it is I that cut off his heel, so that he carried but one heel away with him. What should bring the son of that man to contend with me?\u0027 \"Mend sat down in his seat. \"\u0027Still the contest,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027or I shall divide the pig.\u0027 \"\u0027Thou shalt have it,\u0027 said Cumscraidh, the stammerer of Macha, son of Conor. \"\u0027Who is this?\u0027 \"\u0027That is Cumscraidh,\u0027 say all. \"He is the makings of a king, so far as his figure goes.... [Pg 360] \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027thou madest thy first raid on us. We met on the border. Thou didst leave a third of thy people with me, and camest away with a spear through thy throat, so that no word comes rightly over thy lips, since the sinews of thy throat were wounded, so that Cumscraidh, the stammerer of Macha, is thy name ever since.\u0027 \"In that way he laid disgrace and a blow on the whole province. \"While he made ready with the pig and had his knife in his hand, they see Conall Cearnach [the Victorious], coming towards them into the house. He sprang on to the floor of the house. The men of Ulster gave him great welcome. \u0027Twas then [King] Conor threw his helmet from his head and shook himself [for joy] in his own place. \u0027We are glad,\u0027 said Conall, \u0027that our portion is ready for us, and who divides for you?\u0027 said Conall. \"One man of the men of Ireland has obtained by contest the dividing of it, to wit, Cet mac Mágach. \"\u0027Is that true, Cet?\u0027 said Conall, \u0027art thou dividing the pig?\u0027\" There follows here an obscure dialogue in verse between the warriors. \"\u0027Get up from the pig, Cet,\u0027 said Conall. \"\u0027What brings thee to it?\u0027 said Cet. \"\u0027Truly [for you] to seek contest from me,\u0027 said Conall, \u0027and I shall give you contest; I swear what my people swear since I [first] took spear and weapons, I have never been a day without having slain a Connachtman, nor a night without plundering, nor have I ever slept without the head of a Connachtman under my knee.\u0027 \"\u0027It is true,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027thou art even a better warrior than I, but if Anluan mac Mágach [my brother] were in the house,\u0027 said Cet, \u0027he would match thee contest for contest, and it is a pity that he is not in the house this night.\u0027 \"\u0027Aye, is he, though,\u0027 said Conall, taking the head of Anluan from his belt and throwing it at Cet\u0027s chest, so that a gush of blood broke over his lips. After that Conall sat down by the pig and Cet went from it. \"\u0027Now let them come to the contest,\u0027 said Conall. \"Truly there was not then found among the men of Connacht a warrior to stand up to him in contest, for they were loath to be slain on the spot. The men of Ulster made a cover around him with their shields, for there was an evil custom in the house, the people of one side throwing stones at the other side. Then Conall proceeded to divide the pig, and he took the end of the tail in his mouth until he had finished dividing the pig.\" [Pg 361] The men of Connacht, as might be expected, were not pleased with their share. The rest of the piece recounts the battle that ensued both in the hostelry, whence \"seven streams of blood burst through its seven doors,\" and outside in the close or liss after the hosts had burst through the doors, the death of the hound, the flight of Oilioll and Mève into Connacht, and the curious adventures of their charioteer. The Conception of Cuchulain,[9] the Conception of Conor,[10] the Wooing of Emer,[11] the Death of Conlaoch,[12] the Siege of Howth,[13] the Intoxication of the Ultonians,[14] Bricriu\u0027s Banquet,[15] Emer\u0027s Jealousy and Cuchulain\u0027s Pining,[16] the Battle of Rosnaree,[17] Bricriu\u0027s Feast and the Exile of the Sons of Dael Dermuit,[18] Macha\u0027s Curse on the[Pg 362] Ultonians,[19] the Death of King Conor,[20] the Wooing of Ferb,[21] the Cattle Spoil of Dartaid, the Cattle Spoil of Flidais, the Cattle Spoil of Regamon, the Táin bé Aingen, the Táin Bo Regamna,[22] the Conception of the two Swineherds[23] the Deaths of Oilioll (King of Connacht) and Conall Cearnach,[24] the Demoniac Chariot of Cuchulain,[25] the Cattle Spoil of Fraich,[26] are some of the most available of the many remaining sagas belonging to this cycle. ******** [1] \"Hibernica Minora,\" p. 57, from Rawlinson B. 512, in the Bodleian Library. I have followed his excellent translation nearly verbatim. [2] In Old Irish, Bruiden; in modern, Bruidhean (Bree-an). [3] \"Tucad turbaid chotulta / do Mac Dáthó co a thech. Ros bói ni no chomairled / cen co labradar fri nech.\" [4] But especially since Fergus mac Róigh or Roy had deserted Ulster and gone over to Connacht on the death of Déirdre. [5] He is well known in the Ultonian saga. Keating describes him in his history as a \"mighty warrior of the Connachtmen, and a fierce wolf of evil to the men of Ulster.\" It was he who gave King Conor the wound of which, after nine years, he died. He was eventually slain by Conall Cearnach as he was returning in a heavy fall of snow from a plundering excursion in Ulster, carrying three heads with him. See O\u0027Mahony\u0027s Keating, p. 274, and Conall Cearnach was taken up for dead and brought away by the Connacht men after the fight, but recovered. This evidently formed the plot of another saga now I think lost. [6] This is what Cuchulain also does the day he assumes arms for the first time. The story of his doings on that day and his foray into Connacht as recited by Fergus to Oilioll and Mève forms one of the most interesting episodes of the Táin Bo Chuailgne. Every young Ultonian on assuming arms made a raid into Connacht. [7] It was he who, in the oldest version of the Déirdre saga, slew Naoise, and it was to him Conor made Déirdre over at the end of a year. See above p. 317. [8] This phrase, introduced by a Christian reciter or copyist, need not in the least take away from the genuine pagan character of the whole.
