{"id":16603,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX THE BARDIC SCHOOLS","content":"We must now, leaving verifiable history behind us, attempt a cautious step backwards from the known into the doubtful, and see what in the way of literature is said to have been produced by the pagans. We know that side by side with the colleges of the clergy there flourished, perhaps in a more informal way, the purely Irish schools of the Brehons and the Bards. Unhappily however, while, thanks to the great number of the Lives of the Saints,[1] we know much about the Christian colleges, there is very little to be discovered about the bardic institutions. These were almost certainly a continuation of the schools of the druids, and represented something far more antique than even the very earliest schools of the Christians, but unlike them they were not centred in a fixed locality nor in a cluster of houses, but seem to have been peripatetic. The bardic scholars grouped themselves not round a locality but round a personality, and wherever it pleased their master to wander—and that was pretty much all[Pg 240] round Ireland—there they followed, and the people seem to have willingly supported them. \n \n There seems to be some confusion as to the forms into which what must have been originally the druidic school disintegrated itself in the fifth and succeeding centuries, but from it we can see emerging the poet, the Brehon, and the historian, not all at once, but gradually. In the earliest period the functions of all three were often, if not always, united in one single person, and all poets were ipso facto judges as well. We have a distinct account of the great occasion upon which the poet lost his privilege of acting as a judge merely because he was a poet. It appears that from the very earliest date the learned classes, especially the \"f?lès,\" had evolved a dialect of their own, which was perfectly dark and obscure to every one except themselves. This was the Béarla Féni, in which so much of the Brehon law and many poems are written, and which continued to be used, to some extent, by poets down to the very beginning of the eighteenth century. Owing to their predilection for this dialect, the first blow, according to Irish accounts, was struck at their judicial supremacy by the hands of laymen, during the reign of Conor mac Nessa, some time before the birth of Christ. This was the occasion when the sages Fercertné and Neidé contended for the office of arch-ollav of Erin, with its beautiful robe of feathers, the Tugen.[2] Their discourse, still extant in at least three MSS. under the title of the \"Dialogue of the Two Sages,\"[3] was so learned, and they contended with one another in terms so abstruse that, as the chronicler in the Book of Ballymote puts it:— \n \n \"Obscure to every one seemed the speech which the poets uttered in that discussion, and the legal decision which they delivered was not clear to the kings and to the other poets. \n \n \"\u0027These men alone,\u0027 said the kings, \u0027have their judgment and[Pg 241] their skill, and their knowledge. In the first place we do not understand what they say.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Well, then,\u0027 said Conor, \u0027every one shall have his share therein from to-day for ever.\u0027\"[4] \n \n This was the occasion upon which Conor made the law that the office of poet should no longer carry with it, of necessity, the office of judge, for, says the ancient writer, \"poets alone had judicature from the time that Amairgin Whiteknee delivered the first judgment in Erin\" until then. \n \n That the Bardic schools, which we know flourished as public institutions with scarcely a break from the Synod of Drumceat in 590 (where regular lands were set apart for their endowment) down to the seventeenth century, were really a continuation of the Druidic schools, and embodied much that was purely pagan in their curricula, is, I think, amply shown by the curious fragments of metrical text-books preserved in the Books of Leinster and Ballymote, in a MS. in Trinity College, and in a MS. in the Bodleian, all four of which have been recently admirably edited by Thurneysen as a continuous text.[5] He has not however ventured upon a translation, for the scholar would be indeed a bold one who in the present state of Celtic scholarship would attempt a complete interpretation of tracts so antique and difficult. That they date, partially at least, from pre-Christian times seems to me certain from their prescribing amongst other things for the poet\u0027s course in one of his years of study a knowledge of the magical incantations called Tenmlaida, Imbas forosnai,[6] and Dichetal do chennaib na tuaithe, and making him in another year learn a certain poem or incantation called Cétnad, of which the text says that— \n \n \"It is used for finding out a theft. One sings it, that is to say, through the right fist on the track of the stolen beast\" [observe the antique assumption that the only kind of wealth to be stolen is cattle][Pg 242] \"or on the track of the thief, in case the beast is dead. And one sings it three times on the one [track] or the other. If, however, one does not find the track, one sings it through the right fist, and goes to sleep upon it, and in one\u0027s sleep the man who has brought it away is clearly shown and made known. Another virtue [of this lay]: one speaks it into the right palm and rubs with it the quarters of the horse before one mounts it, and the horse will not be overthrown, and the man will not be thrown off or wounded.\" \n \n Another Cétnad to be learned by the poet, in which he desires length of life, is addressed to \"the seven daughters of the sea, who shape the thread of the long-lived children.\" \n \n Another with which he had to make himself familiar was the Glam dichinn,[7] intended to satirise and punish the prince who refused to a poet the reward of his poem. The poet— \n \n \"was to fast upon the lands of the king for whom the poem was to be made, and the consent of thirty laymen, thirty bishops\"—a Christian touch to make the passage pass muster—\"and thirty poets should be had to compose the satire; and it was a crime to them to prevent it when the reward of the poem was withheld\"—a pagan touch as a make-weight on the other side! \"The poet then, in a company of seven, that is, six others and himself, upon whom six poetic degrees had been conferred, namely a focloc, macfuirmedh, doss, cana, clí, anradh, and ollamh, went at the rising of the sun to a hill which should be situated on the boundary of seven lands, and each of them was to turn his face to a different land, and the ollamh\u0027s (ollav\u0027s) face was to be turned to the land of the king, who was to be satirised, and their backs should be turned to a hawthorn which should be growing upon the top of a hill, and the wind should be blowing from the north, and each man was to hold a perforated stone and a thorn of the hawthorn in his hand, and each man was to sing a verse of this composition for the king—the ollamh or chief poet to take the lead with his own verse, and the others in concert after him with theirs; and each then should place his stone and his thorn under the stem of the hawthorn, and if it was they that were in the wrong in the case, the ground of the hill would swallow them, and if it was the king that was in the wrong, the ground would swallow him and his wife, and his son and his steed, and his robes and his hound. The satire of the macfuirmedh fell on the hound, the satire[Pg 243] of the focloc on the robes, the satire of the doss on the arms, the satire of the cana on the wife, the satire of the clí on the son, the satire of the anrad on the steed,[8] the satire of the ollamh on the king.\" \n \n These instances that I have mentioned occurring in the books of the poets\u0027 instruction, are evidently remains of magic incantations and terrifying magic ceremonies, taken over from the schools and times of the druids, and carried on into the Christian era, for nobody, I imagine, could contend that they had their origin after Ireland had been Christianised.[9] And the occurrence in the poets\u0027 text-books of such evidently pagan passages, side by side with allusions to Athairné the poet—a contemporary of Conor mac Nessa, a little before the birth of Christ, Caoilte, the Fenian poet of the third century, Cormac his contemporary, Laidcend mac Bairchida about the year 400, and others—seems to me to be fresh proof for the real objective existence of these characters. For if part of the poets\u0027 text-books can be thus shown to have preserved things taught in the pre-Christian times—to be in fact actually pre-Christian—why should we doubt the reality of the pre-Christian persons mixed up with them? \n \n The first poem written in Ireland by a Milesian is said to be the curious rhapsody of Amergin the brother of Eber, Ir, and Erimon, who on landing broke out in a strain of exultation:— \n \n \"I am the wind which breathes upon the sea, \n I am the wave of the ocean, \n I am the murmur of the billows, \n I am the ox of the seven combats, \n I am the vulture upon the rock, \n I am a beam of the sun, \n [Pg 244]I am the fairest of plants, \n I am a wild boar in valour, \n I am a salmon in the water, \n I am a lake in the plain, \n I am a word of science, \n I am the point of the lance of battle, \n I am the god who creates in the head [i.e., of man] the fire [i.e., the thought] \n Who is it who throws light into the meeting on the mountain? \n Who announces the ages of the moon [if not I]? \n Who teaches the place where couches the sea [if not I]?\"[10] \n \n There are two more poems attributed to Amergin of much the same nature, very ancient and very strange. Irish tradition has always represented these poems as the first made by our ancestors in Ireland, and no doubt they do actually represent the oldest surviving lines in the vernacular of any country in Europe except Greece alone. \n \n The other pre-Christian poets[11] of whom we hear most, and to whom certain surviving fragments are ascribed, are Feirceirtné, surnamed filé, or the poet, who is usually credited with the authorship of the well-known grammatical treatise called Uraicept na n-éigeas or \"Primer of the Learned.\"[12] It was he[Pg 245] who contended with Neidé for the arch-poet\u0027s robe, causing King Conor to decide that no poet should in future be also of necessity a judge. The Uraicept begins with this preface or introduction: \"The Book of Feirceirtné here. Its place Emania; its time the time of Conor mac Nessa; its person Feirceirtné the poet; its cause to bring ignorant people to knowledge.\" There is also a poem attributed to him on the death of Curoi mac Daire, the great southern chieftain, whom Cuchulain slew, and the Book of Invasions contains a valuable poem ascribed to him, recounting how Ollamh Fódla, a monarch who is said to have flourished many centuries before, established a college of professors at Tara. \n \n There was a poet called Adhna, the father of that Neidé with whom Feirceirtné contended for the poet\u0027s robe, who also lived at the court of Conor mac Nessa, and his name is mentioned in connection with some fragments of laws. \n \n Athairné, the overbearing insolent satirist from the Hill of Howth, who figures largely in Irish romance, was contemporaneous with these, though I do not know that any poem is attributed to him. But he and a poet called Forchern, with Feirceirtné and Neidé, are said to have compiled a code of laws, now embodied with others under the title of Breithe Neimhidh in the Brehon Law Books. \n \n There was a poet Lughar at the Court of Oilioll and Mève in Connacht about the same time, and a poem on the descendants of Fergus mac Róigh [Roy] is ascribed to him, but as he was contemporaneous with that warrior he could not have written about his descendants. \n \n [Pg 246] \n \n There is a prose tract called Moran\u0027s Will,[13] ascribed to Moran, a well-known jurist who lived at the close of the first century. \n \n Several other authors, either of short poems or law fragments, are mentioned in the second and third centuries, such as Feradach king of Ireland, Modan, Ciothruadh the poet, Fingin, Oilioll Olum himself, the great king of Munster, to whom are traced so many of the southern families. Fithil, a judge, and perhaps some others, none of whom need be particularised. \n \n At the end of the third century we come upon three or four names of vast repute in Irish history, into whose mouths a quantity of pieces are put, most of which are evidently of later date. These are the great Cormac mac Art himself, the most striking king that ever reigned in pagan Ireland, he who built those palaces on Tara Hill whose ruins still remain; Finn mac Cúmhail his son-in-law and captain; Ossian, Finn\u0027s son; Fergus, Ossian\u0027s brother; and Caoilte [Cweeltya] mac Ronáin. \n \n The poetry ascribed to Finn mac Cúmhail, Ossian, and the other Fenian singers we will not examine in this place, but we must not pass by one of the most remarkable prose tracts of ancient Ireland with which I am acquainted, the famous treatise ascribed to King Cormac, and well known in Irish literature as the \"Teagasg ríogh,\" or Instruction of a Prince, which is written in a curious style, by way of question and answer. Cairbré, Cormac\u0027s son, he who afterwards fell out with and overthrew the Fenians, is supposed to be learning kingly wisdom at his father\u0027s feet, and that experienced monarch instructs him in the pagan morality of the time, and gives him all kinds of information and advice. The piece, which is heavily glossed in the Book of Ballymote, on account of the antiquity of the language, is of some length, and is far too interesting to pass by without quoting from it. \n \n [Pg 247] \n \n THE INSTRUCTION OF A PRINCE. \n \n \"\u0027O grandson of Con, O Cormac,\u0027 said Cairbré, \u0027what is good for a king.\u0027[14] \n \n \"\u0027That is plain,\u0027 said Cormac, \u0027it is good for him to have patience and not to dispute, self-government without anger, affability without haughtiness, diligent attention to history, strict observance of covenants and agreements, strictness mitigated by mercy in the execution of laws.... It is good for him [to make] fertile land, to invite ships to import jewels of price across sea, to purchase and bestow raiment, [to keep] vigorous swordsmen for protecting his territories, [to make] war outside his own territories, to attend the sick, to discipline his soldiers ... let him enforce fear, let him perfect peace, [let him] give much of metheglin and wine, let him pronounce just judgments of light, let him speak all truth, for it is through the truth of a king that God gives favourable seasons.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027O grandson of Con, O Cormac,\u0027 said Cairbré, \u0027what is good for the welfare of a country?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027That is plain,\u0027 said Cormac, \u0027frequent convocations of sapient and good men to investigate its affairs, to abolish each evil and retain each wholesome institution, to attend to the precepts of the elders; let every assembly be convened according to law, let the law be in the hands of the nobles, let the chieftains be upright and unwilling to oppress the poor,\u0027\" etc., etc. \n \n A more interesting passage is the following:— \n \n \"\u0027O grandson of Con, O Cormac, what are the duties of a prince at a banqueting-house?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027A Prince on Samhan\u0027s [now All Souls] Day, should light his lamps, and welcome his guests with clapping of hands, procure comfortable seats, the cupbearers should be respectable and active in the distribution of meat and drink. Let there be moderation of music, short stories, a welcoming countenance, a welcome for the learned, pleasant conversations, and the like, these are the duties of the prince, and the arrangement of the banqueting-house.\u0027\" \n \n After this Cairbré puts an important question which was asked often enough during the period of the Brehon law, and[Pg 248] which for over a thousand years scarce ever received a different answer. He asks, \"For what qualifications is a king elected over countries and tribes of people?\" \n \n Cormac in his answer embodies the views of every clan in Ireland in their practical choice of a leader. \n \n \"From the goodness of his shape and family, from his experience and wisdom, from his prudence and magnanimity, from his eloquence and bravery in battle, and from the number of his friends.\" \n \n After this follows a long description of the qualifications of a prince, and Cairbré having heard it puts this question:—\"O grandson of Con, what was thy deportment when a youth;\" to which he receives the following striking answer: \n \n \"\u0027I was cheerful at the Banquet of the Midh-chuarta [Mee-cuarta, \"house of the circulation of mead\"], fierce in battle, but vigilant and circumspect. I was kind to friends, a physician to the sick, merciful towards the weak, stern towards the headstrong. Although possessed of knowledge, I was inclined towards taciturnity.[15] Although strong I was not haughty. I mocked not the old although I was young. I was not vain although I was valiant. When I spoke of a person in his absence I praised, not defamed him, for it is by these customs that we are known to be courteous and civilised (riaghalach).\u0027\" \n \n There is an extremely beautiful answer given later on by Cormac to the rather simple question of his son: \n \n \"\u0027O grandson of Con, what is good for me?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027If thou attend to my command,\u0027 answers Cormac, \u0027thou wilt not[Pg 249] mock the old although thou art young, nor the poor although thou art well-clad, nor the lame although thou art agile, nor the blind although thou art clear-sighted, nor the feeble although thou art strong, nor the ignorant although thou art learned. Be not slothful, nor passionate, nor penurious, nor idle, nor jealous, for he who is so is an object of hatred to God as well as to man.\u0027\" \n \n \"\u0027O grandson of Con,\u0027 asks Cairbré, in another place, \u0027I would fain know how I am to conduct myself among the wise and among the foolish, among friends and among strangers, among the old and among the young,\u0027 and to this question his father gives this notable response. \n \n \"\u0027Be not too knowing nor too simple; be not proud, be not inactive, be not too humble nor yet haughty; be not talkative but be not too silent; be not timid neither be severe. For if thou shouldest appear too knowing thou wouldst be satirised and abused; if too simple thou wouldst be imposed upon; if too proud thou wouldst be shunned; if too humble thy dignity would suffer; if talkative thou wouldst not be deemed learned; if too severe thy character would be defamed; if too timid thy rights would be encroached upon.\u0027\" \n \n To the curious question, \"O grandson of Con, what are the most lasting things in the world?\" the equally curious and to me unintelligible answer is returned, \"Grass, copper, and yew.\" \n \n Of women, King Cormac, like so many monarchs from Solomon down, has nothing good to say, perhaps his high position did not help him to judge them impartially. At least, to the question, \"O grandson of Con, how shall I distinguish the characters of women?\" the following bitter answer is given: \n \n \"\u0027I know them, but I cannot describe them. Their counsel is foolish, they are forgetful of love, most headstrong in their desires, fond of folly, prone to enter rashly into engagements, given to swearing, proud to be asked in marriage, tenacious of enmity, cheerless at the banquet, rejectors of reconciliation, prone to strife, of much garrulity. Until evil be good, until hell be heaven, until the sun hide his light, until the stars of heaven fall, women will remain as we have stated. Woe to him, my son, who desires or serves a bad woman, woe to every one who has got a bad wife\u0027\"! \n \n This Christian allusion to heaven and hell, and some others of the same sort, show that despite a considerable pagan flavouring[Pg 250] the tract cannot be entirely the work of King Cormac, though it may very well be the embodiment and extension of an ancient pagan discourse, for, as we have seen, after Christianity had succeeded in getting the upper hand over paganism, a kind of tacit compromise was arrived at, by means of which the bards and f?lès and other representatives of the old pagan learning, were allowed to continue to propagate their stories, tales, poems, and genealogies, at the price of incorporating with them a small share of Christian alloy, or, to use a different simile, just as the vessels of some feudatory nations are compelled to fly at the mast-head the flag of the suzerain power. But so badly has the dovetailing of the Christian and the pagan parts been managed in most of the older romances, that the pieces come away quite separate in the hands of even the least skilled analyser, and the pagan substratum stands forth entirely distinct from the Christian accretion. \n ******** \n [1] O\u0027Clery notices, in his Féil?rè na Naomh, the lives of thirty-one saints written in Irish, all extant in his time, not to speak of Latin ones. I fancy most of them still survive. Stokes printed nine from the Book of Lismore; Standish Hayes O\u0027Grady four more from various sources. \n \n [2] See Cormac\u0027s glossary sub voce. \n \n [3] See \"Irische Texte,\" Dritte Serie, 1 Heft, pp. 187 and 204. \n \n [4] Agallamh an da Suadh. \n \n [5] \"Irische Texte,\" Dritte serie, Heft i. \n \n [6] See above, p. 84. \n \n [7] See O\u0027Curry\u0027s \"Manners and Customs,\" vol. ii. p. 217, and \"Irische Texte,\" Dritte serie, Heft. i. pp. 96 and 125. \n \n [8] It is curious to thus make the steed rank apparently next to the king himself, and above the wife and son, for the anrad who curses the steed ranks next to the ollamh. \n \n [9] Thurneysen expresses some doubt about the antiquity of the last citation. \n \n [10] See Text 1. paragraph 123 of Thurneysen\u0027s \"Mittelirische Verslehren\" for three versions of this curious poem, printed side by side from the Books of Leinster and Ballymote, and a MS. in the Bodleian. The old Irish tract for the instruction of poets gives it as an example of what it calls Cetal do chendaib. I have followed D\u0027Arbois de Jubainville\u0027s interpretation of it. He sees in it a pantheistic spirit, but Dr. Sigerson has proved, I think quite conclusively, that it is liable to a different interpretation, a panegyric upon the bard\u0027s own prowess, couched in enigmatic metaphor. (See \"Bards of the Gael and Gaul,\" p. 379.) \n \n [11] A number of names are mentioned—chiefly in connection with law fragments—of kings and poets who lived centuries before the birth of Christ, including an elegy by Lughaidh, son of Ith (from whom the Ithians sprang), on his wife\u0027s death, Cimbaeth the founder of Emania, before whose reign Tighearnach the Annalist considered omnia monumenta Scotorum to be incerta, Roigne, the son of Hugony the Great, who lived nearly three hundred years before Christ, and some others. \n \n [12] The \"Uraicept\" or \"Uraiceacht\" is sometimes ascribed to Forchern. It gives examples of the declensions of nouns and adjectives in Irish, distinguishing feminine nouns from masculine, etc. It gives rules of syntax, and exemplifies the declensions by quotations from ancient poets. A critical edition of it from the surviving manuscripts that contain it in whole or part is a desideratum. \n \n [13] Udacht Morain, H. 2, 7, T.
