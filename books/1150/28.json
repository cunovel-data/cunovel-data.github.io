{"id":16611,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII THE DEATH OF CUCHULAIN","content":"Although Cuchulain won for himself in this war an imperishable fame, yet he was not destined to enjoy it long, for he perished before arriving at middle age.[1] The account of his death is preserved in the Book of Leinster, a manuscript of the middle of the twelfth century, which quotes incidentally from an Irish poet[2] of the seventh century, thus showing that Cuchulain was at this early age the hero of the poets. Unfortunately the opening of the story in the Book of Leinster is lost, but many modern extensions of the saga still exist, from one of which in my possession I shall supply what is missing.[3] \n \n Cuchulain had three formidable enemies, who were bent upon his life, these were Lughaidh [Lewy] the son of the[Pg 342] Momonian king Curigh,[4] whom Cuchulain had slain, Erc, the son of Cairbré Niafer king of all Ireland, who was slain in the battle of Rosnaree,[5] and the descendants of the wizard Calatin, who with his twenty sons and his son-in-law fell by Cuchulain in one of the combats at the Ford, during the raid of the Táin. His wife, however, brought into the world three posthumous children, daughters.[6] These unhappy creatures Mève mutilated by cutting off their right legs and left arms, so that they might be odious and horrible, and all the fitter for the dread profession she proposed for them—evil wizardry. She reared them carefully, and so soon as they were of a fitting age she sent them into the world to gain a knowledge of charms and spells, and druidism, and witchcraft, and incantations. In pursuit of this knowledge they roamed throughout the world, and at last returned to the queen as perfect adepts as might be. \n \n Thereupon she convened a second muster of the men of the four provinces, and joined by Lewy the son of Curigh, and Erc the son of Cairbré Niafer, both of whose parents had fallen by Cuchulain, and having with her the odious but powerful children of Calatin, eager to avenge the death of their father and their family, she again marched upon Ulster[Pg 343] during the sickness of their warriors, and began to plunder and to burn and to drive away a mighty prey. King Conor immediately surmised that it was against Cuchulain the expedition was prepared, and without a moment\u0027s delay he depatched Lavarcam his female messenger, to desire him instantly to leave his palace and his patrimony at Dundealgan[7] in the plain of Muirtheimhne, and come to himself at Emania, there to be under the King\u0027s immediate orders. This command he gave, thinking to rescue Cuchulain from the possible effects of his own valour and rashness, for there was scarcely a man of distinction in any of the four provinces of Erin some of whose relatives had not been slain by him. \n \n Lavarcam found the hero upon the shore, between sea and land, intent upon the slaying of sea-fowl with his sling, but though birds many flew over him and past him, not one could he bring down—they all escaped him. And this was to him the first bad omen. Very reluctantly did he obey the call of Conor, and sorely loath was he to leave his patrimony. He accompanied Lavarcam, however, to Emania, and abode there in his own bright-lighted crystal grianán. Then Conor consulted with his druids as to how best to keep him there, and they sent the bright ladies of Emania, and his wife Emer, and the poets and the musicians, and the men of science, to surround and distract and amuse him, with conversation and music and banquets. \n \n In the meantime, however, Mève\u0027s army had advanced upon and burned Dundealgan, and the children of Calatin had promised that within three days and three nights they would bring Cuchulain to his doom. \n \n And now ensues what is to my mind one of the most powerful incidents in all this saga—the malignant ghoulish efforts of the children of Calatin to draw forth Cuchulain from his place of safety, and on the other side the anxiety of the druids and ladies, and the frenzied heart-sick efforts of his[Pg 344] wife, and his mistress, to detain him. The loathsome wizards flew through the air and stationed themselves upon the plain outside Emania— \n \n \"They smote the soil and beat and tore it up around them, so that they made of fuz-balls, and of stalks of sanna, and of the fine foliage of the oaks, as it were ordered battalions, and hosts, and multitudes of men, and the confused shoutings of the battalions and of the war-bands, and the battle array, were heard on all sides, as it were striking and attacking the fortress.\" \n \n Geanan the druid, the son of old Cathbadh, was watching Cuchulain this day. As soon as the sounds of war and shouting reached him Cuchulain rose and \"looked forth, and he saw the battalions smiting each other unsparingly,\" as he thought, and he burned at once with fury and shame; but the druid cast his two arms round him in time to prevent him from bursting forth to relieve the apparently foe-beleaguered town. Over and over again must the druid assure him that all he saw was blind-work and magic, and unreal phantoms, employed by the clan Calatin to lure him forth to his destruction.[8] It was impossible, however, to keep Cuchulain from at least looking, and, the next time he looked forth, \n \n \"he thought he beheld the battalions drawn up upon the plains, and the next time he looked after that he thought he saw Gradh son of Lir upon the plain, and it was a geis (tabu) to him to see that, and then he thought moreover that he heard the harp of the son of Mangur playing musically, ever-sweetly, and it was a geis to him to listen to those pleasing fairy sounds, and he recognised from these things that his virtue was indeed overcome, and that his geasa (tabus) were broken, and that the end of his career had arrived, and that his valour and prowess were destroyed by the children of Calatin.\" \n \n After that one of the daughters of the wizard Calatin,[Pg 345] assuming the form of a crow, came flying over him and incited him with taunts to go and rescue his homestead and his patrimony from the hands of his enemies. And although Cuchulain now understood that these were enchantments that were working against him, yet was he none the less anxious to rush forth and oppose them, for he felt moved and troubled in himself at the shouting of the imaginary hosts, and his memory, and his senses, and his right mind were afflicted by the sounds of that ever-thrilling harp. \n \n Then the druid used all his influence, explaining to him that if he would only remain for three days more in Emania the spells would have no power, and he would go forth again, \"and the whole world would be full of his victories and his lasting renown,\" and thereafter the ladies of Emania and the musicians closed round him, and they sang sweet melodies, and they distracted his mind, and the day drew to a close:—the clan Calatin retired baffled, and Cuchulain was himself once more. \n \n During that night the ladies and the druids took council together and determined to carry him away to a glen so remote and lonely that it was called the Deaf Valley, and to hide him there, preparing for him a splendid banquet, with music, and poets, and delights of every kind. \n \n Next morning came the accursed wizards and inspected the city, and they marvelled that they saw not Cuchulain, and that he was neither beside his wife, nor yet amongst the other heroes of the Red Branch. Then they understood that he had been hidden away by Cathbadh the druid, \"and they raised themselves aloft, lightly and airily, upon a blast of enchanted wind, which they created to lift them,\" and went soaring over the entire province of Ulster to discover his retreat. This they do by perceiving Cuchulain\u0027s grey steed, the Liath Macha, standing outside at the entrance to the glen. Then the three begin their wizardry anew, and made, as it were, battalions of warriors to appear round the glen,[Pg 346] and they raised anew the sounds of arms and the shouts of war and conflict, as they had done at Emania. \n \n The instant the ladies round Cuchulain heard it they also shouted, and the musicians struck up—but in vain; Cuchulain had caught the sound. They succeeded, however, in calming his mind, and in inducing him to pay no heed to the false witcheries of the clan Calatin. These continued for a long time waiting and filling the air with their unreal battle tumult, but Cuchulain did not appear. Then they understood that the druids had been more powerful than they. Mad with impotent fury one of them enters the glen, and pushes her way right into the very fortress where Cuchulain was feasting. Once there she changes herself into the form of the beautiful Niamh [Nee-av], Cuchulain\u0027s love and sweetheart. First she stood at the door in the likeness of an attendant damsel, and beckoned to the lady to come to her outside. Niamh, thinking she has something to communicate, follows her through the door and out into the valley, and the other ladies follow Niamh. Instantly she raises an enchanted fog between them and the dún, so that they wander astray, and their minds are troubled. But she, assuming the form of the lady Niamh herself, slips back into the fortress, comes to Cuchulain, and cries to him: \"Up, O Cuchulain, and meet the men of Erin, or thy fame shall be lost for ever, and the province shall be destroyed.\" At this speech Cuchulain is astounded, for Niamh had bound him by an oath that he would not go forth or take arms until she herself should give him leave, and this leave he never thought to receive of her until the fatal time was over. \"I shall go,\" said Cuchulain, \"and that is a pity, O Niamh,\" said he, \"and after that it is difficult to trust to woman, for I had thought thou hadst not given me that leave for the gold of the world, but since it is thou who dost let me go to face the men of Erin, I shall go.\" After that he rose and left the dún. \"I have no reason for preserving my life longer,\" said Cuchulain, \"for the end of my time is come, and all my[Pg 347] geasa (tabus) are lost, and Niamh has let me go to face the men of Erin; and since she has let me, I shall go.\" \n \n Afterwards the real Niamh overtakes him at the entrance to the glen, and assured him with torrents of tears, and wild sobs, that it was not she who had given him leave, but the vile enchantress who had assumed her form, and she conjured him with prayers and piteous entreaties to remain with her. But Cuchulain would not believe her, and urged Laeg to catch his steeds and yoke them, for he thought that he beheld— \n \n \"The great battle-battalions ranged upon the green of Emania, and the whole plain filled up and crowded with broad bands of hundreds of men, with champions, and steeds, and arms, and armour, and he thought he heard the awful shoutings, and [saw] the burnings extending, widely-let-loose through the buildings of Conor\u0027s city, and him-seemed that there was nor hill nor rising ground about Emania that was not full of spoils, and it appeared to him that Emer\u0027s sunny-house was overthrown and had fallen out over the ramparts of Emania, and that the House of the Red Branch was in one blaze, and that all Emania was one meeting-place of fire, and of black, dark, spacious, brown-red smoke.\"[9] \n \n Then Cuchulain\u0027s brooch fell from his hand and pierced his foot, another omen of ill. Nor would his noble grey war-horse allow himself to be caught. It was only when Cuchulain addressed him with persuasive words of verse that he consented to let himself be harnessed to the chariot, and even then \"he[Pg 348] lets fall upon his fore feet, from his eyes, two large tears of blood.\" In vain did the ladies of Emania try to bar his passage, in vain did fifty queens uncover their bosoms before him in supplication. \"He is the first,\" says the saga, \"of whom it is recounted that women uncovered before him their bosoms.\"[10] \n \n Thereafter another evil omen overtook him, for as he pursued the high road leading to the south, \n \n \"and had passed the plain of Mogna, he perceived something, three hags of the half-blind race,[11] who were on the track before him cooking a poisoned dog\u0027s flesh upon spits of holly. Now it was a geis (tabu) to Cuchulain to pass a cooking-fire without visiting it and accepting food. It was another geis to eat of his own name\" [i.e., a hound, he is Cu-Chulain or Culan\u0027s hound], \"so he pauses not, but passes the three hags. Then one of them cries to him— \n \n \"\u0027Come, visit us, Cuchulain.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I shall not visit you,\u0027 said Cuchulain. \n \n \"\u0027There is something to eat here,\u0027 replied the hag; \u0027we have a dog to offer thee. If our cooking-place were great,\u0027 said she, \u0027thou wouldst come, but because it is small thou comest not; a great man who despises the small, deserves no honour.\u0027 \n \n \"Cuchulain then moved over to the hag, and she with her left hand offered him half the dog. Cuchulain ate, and it was with his left hand he took the piece, and he placed part of it under his left thigh, and his left hand and his left thigh were cursed, and the curse reached all his left side, which from his head to his feet lost a great part of its power.\" \n \n At last Cuchulain meets the enemy on his ancestral patrimony of Moy Muirtheimhne, drawn up in battle array, with shield to shield as though it were one solid plank that was around them. Cuchulain displays his feats from his chariot, especially \"his three thunder-feats—the thunder of an hundred, the thunder of three hundred, the thunder of thrice nine men.\" \n \n [Pg 349] \n \n \"He played equally with spear, shield, and sword, he performed all the feats of a warrior. As many as there are of grains of sand in the sea, of stars in the heaven, of dewdrops in May, of snowflakes in winter, of hailstones in a storm, of leaves in a forest, of ears of corn in the plains of Bregia, of sods beneath the feet of the steeds of Erin on a summer\u0027s day, so many halves of heads, and halves of shields, and halves of hands and halves of feet, so many red bones were scattered by him throughout the plain of Muirtheimhne, it became grey with the brains of his enemies, so fierce and furious was Cuchulain\u0027s onslaught.\" \n \n The plan which Erc, son of the late High-king Cairbré Niafer had adopted was to place two men pretending to fight with one another upon each flank of the army and a druid standing near who should first make Cuchulain separate the combatants, and should then demand from him his spear, since there ran a prophecy to the effect that Cuchulain\u0027s spear should kill a king, but if they could get the spear from him they at least would be safe from the prophecy; it would not be one of them who should be slain by it. \n \n Cuchulain separates the fighters as the druid asks him, by killing each of them with a blow. \n \n \"\u0027You have separated them,\u0027 said the druid, \u0027they shall do each other no more harm.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027They would not be so silenced,\u0027 said Cuchulain, \u0027hadst thou not prayed me to interfere between them.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Give me thy spear, O Cuchulain,\u0027 said the druid. \n \n \"\u0027I swear by the oath which my nation swears,\u0027 said Cuchulain, \u0027you have no greater need of the spear than I. All the warriors of Erin are come together against me, and I must defend myself.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027If thou refuse me,\u0027 said the druid, \u0027I shall solemnly utter against thee a magic curse.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027Up to this time,\u0027 replied Cuchulain, \u0027no curse has ever been levelled against me for any act of refusal on my part.\u0027\" \n \n And with that he reversed his spear and threw it at the druid butt foremost, killing him and nine more. Lewy, the son of Curigh, immediately picked it up. \n \n \"\u0027Whom,\u0027 said he to the children of Calatin, \u0027is this to overthrow?\u0027 \n \n [Pg 350] \n \n \"\u0027It is a king whom that spear shall slay,\u0027 said they. \n \n \"Lewy hurled it at Cuchulain\u0027s chariot, and it pierced Laeg, his charioteer. \n \n \"Cuchulain bade his charioteer farewell. \n \n \"\u0027To-day,\u0027 said Cuchulain, \u0027I shall be both warrior and charioteer.\u0027\" \n \n The same incident happens again. Cuchulain kills the second druid in the same way, and his spear is picked up by Erc. \n \n \"\u0027Children of Calatin,\u0027 said Erc, \u0027what exploit shall this spear perform?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027It shall overthrow a king,\u0027 said they. \n \n \"\u0027You said this spear would overthrow a king when Lewy hurled it some time ago,\u0027 said Erc. \n \n \"\u0027Nor were we deceived,\u0027 said they, \u0027that spear has brought down the king of the charioteers of Ireland, Laeg, the son of Riangabhra, Cuchulain\u0027s charioteer.\u0027\" \n \n Erc hurls the spear and it passes through the side of Cuchulain\u0027s noble steed, the Liath Macha. Cuchulain took a fond farewell of the animal who galloped with half the yoke around its neck to the lake from whence he had first taken it, on the mountain of Fuad in far-off Armagh. \n \n The third time a druid demands his spear, and is killed by Cuchulain, who throws it to him handle foremost. The spear is picked up this time by Lewy son of Curigh. \n \n \"\u0027What feat shall this spear perform, ye children of Calatin?\u0027 said Lewy. \n \n \"It shall overthrow a king,\u0027 said they. \n \n \"\u0027Ye said as much when Erc hurled it this morning,\u0027 answered Lewy. \n \n \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 answered the children of Calatin, \u0027and our word was true. The spear which Erc hurled has wounded mortally the king of the steeds of Ireland, the Liath Macha.\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027I swear then,\u0027 said Lewy, \u0027by the oath which my nation swears, that Erc\u0027s blow smote not the king which this spear is to slay.\u0027\" \n \n Then Lewy hurls the spear, and this time pierces Cuchulain through the body, and Cuchulain\u0027s other steed burst the yoke[Pg 351] and rushed off and never ceased till he, too, had plunged into the lake from which Cuchulain had taken him in far-off Munster.[12] Cuchulain remained behind, dying in his chariot. With difficulty and holding in his entrails with one hand, he advanced to a little lake hard by, and drank from it, and washed off his blood. Then he propped himself against a high stone a few yards from the lake, and tied himself to it with his girdle. \"He did not wish to die either sitting or lying, it was standing,\" says the saga, \"that he wished to meet death.\" \n \n But his grey steed, the Liath Macha,[13] returned once more to defend his lord, and made three terrible charges, scattering with tooth and hoof all who would approach the stone where Cuchulain was dying. At last a bird was seen to alight upon his shoulder. \"Yon pillar used not to be a settling place for birds,\" said Erc. They knew then that he was dead. Lewy, the son of Curigh, seized him by the back hair and severed his head from his body. \n \n But Cuchulain was too important an epic hero to thus finish with him. Another very celebrated, but probably later épopée tells of how his friend Conall Cearnach pursued the retreating army and exacted vengeance for his death. A brief digest of Conall\u0027s revenge is contained in the Book of Leinster, but modern copies of much longer and more literary versions exist, and there was no more celebrated poem amongst the later Gael than that[Pg 352] called the Lay of the Heads in which Conall Cearnach returns to Emer, Cuchulain\u0027s wife, to Emania, with a large bundle of heads strung upon a gad, or withy-wand, thrust through their mouths from cheek to cheek, and there explains in a lay to Emer who they were. \n \n In the ancient version in the Book of Leinster it is only Lewy who is slain by Conall. In my more modern recension he slays Erc and the children of Calatin as well, and recovers the head of Cuchulain, which he found being used as a football by two men near Tara. \"If this city,\" said he of Tara, \"were Erc\u0027s own lordship and patrimony I would burn it down, but since it is the very navel and meeting-point of the men of Ireland, I shall affront it no more.\" \n \n Emer\u0027s joy and her grief on recovering her husband\u0027s head are touchingly described. \n \n \"She washed clean the head and she joined it on to its body, and she pressed it to her heart and her bosom, and fell to lamenting and heavily sorrowing over it, and began to suck in its blood and to drink it,[14] and she placed around the head a lovely satin cloth. \u0027Ochone!\u0027 said she, \u0027good was the beauty of this head, although it is low this day, and it is many of the kings and princes of the world would be keening it if they thought it was like this; and the men who demand gold and treasure, and ask petitions of the men of Erin and Alba [i.e., the poets and druids] thou wast their one love and their one choice of the men of the earth, and woe for me that I remain behind this day; for there was not of the women of Erin, nor in the whole great world, a woman mated with a husband, or unmated, not a single one, who, until this day, was not envious of me; for many were the goods and jewels and rents and tributes from the countries of the world that thou broughtest to me, with the valour and strength of thy hand,\u0027 and she took his hand in hers and fell to making lamentations over it, and to telling of its fame and its exploits, and \u0027t was what she said, \u0027Alas!\u0027 said she, \u0027it is many of the kings and of the chieftains and of the strong men of the world that fell by this hand, and it is[Pg 353] many of the goods and treasures of this world that were scattered by it upon poets and men of knowledge,\u0027 and she spake the lay, \n \n \"\u0027Ochone O head, Ochone O head,\u0027\" etc. \n \n Afterwards Conall Cearnach arrives with his pile of heads and planted them carefully \"all round about the wide grass-green lawn\" upon pointed sticks, and relates to Emer who they were and how they fell.[15] \n \n \"Thereafter,\" says the saga, \"Emer desired Conall to make a wide very deep tomb for Cuchulain,\" and she laid herself down in it along with her gentle mate, and she set her mouth to his mouth, and she spake— \n \n \"\u0027Love of my soul,\u0027 she said, \u0027O friend, O gentle sweetheart, and O thou one choice of the men of the earth, many is the woman envied me thee until now, and I shall not live after thee;\u0027 and her soul departed out of her, and she herself and Cuchulain were laid in the one grave by Conall, and he raised their stone over their tomb, and he wrote their names in Ogam, and their funeral games were performed by him and by the Ultonians. \n \n \"THUS FAR THE RED ROUT OF CONALL CEARNACH.\" \n ******** \n [1] He died at the age of twenty-seven years, according to the Annals of Tighearnach, and also according to a note in the Book of Ballymote, which Charles O\u0027Conor of Belinagare identifies as an extract from the Synchronisms of Flann of Monasterboice, who died in 1056. But an account in a MS. H. 3. 17, in Trinity College, Dublin, which was copied about the year 1460, asserts that Cuchulain died in his fifty-ninth year. (See O\u0027Curry\u0027s MS. Mat., p. 507.) \n \n [2] Cennfaelad, son of Ailill. \n \n [3] This MS., which contains many of the Cuchulain sagas, was copied about a hundred years ago by a scribe named Seághain O\u0027Mathghamhna on an island in the Shannon. \n \n [4] The older form of this name is Curoi. A detailed account of this saga is given by Keating. See p. 282 of O\u0027Mahony\u0027s edition. The saga is also told under the title of Aided Conrui, in Egerton 88, British Museum. \n \n [5] The saga of the battle of Rosnaree has recently been published with a translation by Rev. Ed. Hogan, S.J. \n \n [6] Some say six children—three daughters and three sons. The MS. H. i. 8, in Trinity College, which dates from about 1460, according to O\u0027Curry, relates thus: \"And the sons of Cailitin were eight years after the Táin before they went to pursue their learning, for they were but infants in cradles at the time their father was killed. Nine years for them after that pursuing their learning. Seven years after finishing their learning was spent in making their weapons, because there could be found but one day in the year to make their spears. And three years after that did the sons of Cailitin spend in assembling and marching the men of Erin to Belach Mic Uilc in Magh Muirtheimhne (Cuchulain\u0027s patrimony).\" \n \n [7] Now Dundalk in the County Louth. \n \n [8] \"Ni bhfuil acht saobh-lucht siabhartha ann súd, sian-sgarrtha duaibh-siocha draoidheachta do dhealbhadar clann cuirpthe Chailitin go claon-mhillteach fad\u0027 chómhair-se, dod\u0027 chealgadh, agus dod\u0027 chomh-bhuaidh-readh, a churaidh chalma chath-bhuadhaigh.\" \n \n [9] Up to this I have followed the version of my own modern manuscript. From this out, however, the version in the twelfth-century Book of Leinster is used. Monsieur d\u0027Arbois de Jubainville, in his introduction to the fragment of the saga in the Book of Leinster, seems to think that Emania was really besieged, and women and children slaughtered round its walls by the men of Erin, whereas it would appear that the lost part of the saga refers to some such version as I have given from my manuscript, and that it was only the wizardry and sorcery of the children of Calatin, who raised these phantasms. This is the more evident because Cuchulain, when he issues forth, meets no enemy until he has arrived at the plain of Muirtheimhne. Jubainville\u0027s words are, \"Cependant les cris de douleur des femmes et des enfants qu\u0027on massacrait jusqu\u0027au pied des remparts d\u0027Emain macha [Emania] parvinrent à son oreille: on en verra un peu plus bas les conséquences, dont la dernière fut la mort du heros.\" \n \n [10] It was geis, or tabu, to him to behold the exposed breast of a woman. See above, p. 301. \n \n [11] These are in my version the three daughters of Calatin. \n \n [12] The belief in water-horses is quite common even still amongst the old people in all parts of Connacht, and, I think, over the most of Ireland. \n \n [13] With the Liath Macha so renowned throughout the whole Cuchulain saga compare Areiōn, the celebrated steed of Adrastus, who saved his master at the rout of the Argeian chiefs round Thebes. The Liath Macha returns to the water from whence it came, and Areiōn, too, was believed to have been the offspring of Poseidōn. He is alluded to by Nestor in the Iliad xxiii. 346: \n \n κ ?σθ? ?? κ? σ??λ?σι μετ?λμενο? ?υδ? παρ?λθ?, \n ο?δ? ε? κεν μετ?πιφσθεν ?ρε?ονα δ?ον ?λαυνοι, \n ?δρ?στου ταχ?ν ?ππον ?? ?κ θε?φιν γ?νο? ?εν. \n \n He appears, however, to have been black not grey. Hesiod alludes to him as μ?γαν ?ππον ?ρε?ονα κυανοχα?την. \n \n [14] \"Do rinne an ceann do niamhghlanadh agus do chuir ar a chollain féin é, agus do dhruid re na h-ucht agus n-a h-urbhruinne é, agus do ghaibh ag tuirse agus ag trom-mhéala os a chionn, agus do ghaibh ag sughadh a choda fola agus ag a h-ól,\" etc. This was to express affection. Déirdre does the same when her husband is slain, she laps his blood. \n \n [15] This is the celebrated Laoi na gceann, or Lay of the Heads, which begins by Emer asking— \n \n \"A Chonaill cia h-iad na cinn? \n Is dearbh linn gar dheargais h-airm, \n Na cinn o thárla ar an ngad \n Slointear leat na fir d\u0027ar baineadh.\" \n \n It was popular in the Highlands also. There is a copy in the book of the Dean of Lismore, published by Cameron in his \"Reliqui? Celtic?,\" vol. i. p. 66. Also in the Edinburgh MSS. 36 and 38. See ibid. pp. 113 and 115. The piece consists of 116 lines. The oldest form of Emer\u0027s lament over Cuchulain, \"Nuallguba Emire,\" is in the Book of Leinster, p. 123, a. 20. It is a kind of unrhymed chant. The lament I have given is from my own modern manuscript. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703/50194.html","bookId":1150,"book":{"id":1150,"title":"A Literary History of Ireland","description":"简介： The present volume has been styledin order to make it a companion book to other of Mr. Unwin\u0027s publicationsa Literary History of Ireland, but a Literary History of Irish Ireland would be a more correct title, for I have abstained altogether from any...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1703","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM"}}
