{"id":26846,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII AWARDS—SOME PERSONAL NOTES","content":"September opened for us with a minor success. The enemy on the night of the 1st attacked the works under construction by the sailors on Long Hill; during the attack one of their columns moved across a mine between Long Hill and Divisional Hill. The effect was terrific; of a whole mass of live men, in a moment nothing remained. On September 3 the early morning passed quietly. From 2.30 a.m. the Japanese bombarded the Old Town, and from five o\u0027clock they fired on the New Town, and were seen to be hard at work in Redoubt No. 1, whilst other works were quickly rising from Ta-ku-shan and Palidjuan. A great parade was held in honour of General St?ssel\u0027s rewards. In the evening, a submarine mine was seen to explode under the starboard bow of the Itsukushima; the cruiser listed some ten degrees, and a fire burst out, but she was able to steam away. That night 500 dead bodies were buried by the Gendarmes and the Chinese, in front of Eagle\u0027s Nest and Kuropatkin Lunette. While thus employed one Gendarme and three Chinamen were wounded. On the 4th an ineffective assault was made on Water Supply Redoubt. From the 4th to the 6th the enemy were very busy at work on Nos. 1 and 2 Redoubts. On[Pg 187] the night of the 6th we made a successful sortie with the bayonet from Water Supply Redoubt, and 600 more dead were buried on the north-eastern front. On September 6, the following extract of District Orders was issued by General St?ssel: \u0027I have to-day, the 5th, had the great honour to receive from the Tsar the following telegram, sent via Liao-yang, and dated Liao-yang, August 28: \u0027\"As a reward for the gallantry of the Port Arthur garrison, I have given orders that all ranks of the Military and Naval Services defending Port Arthur shall from May 1 till the end of the siege, count every month\u0027s service as one year. I promote you to be a Cavalier of the Order of St. George of the 3rd Class, and I await your recommendations for rewards for those who have distinguished themselves in battle. \u0027\"(Signed) Nicholas.\"\u0027 \u0027The following telegram was received to-day from the Viceroy: \u0027\"Prince Ukhtomsky is to hand over the command of the battleships and cruisers to Captain Wiren, and as soon as the ships are repaired the latter is to endeavour to break through to Vladivostock. \u0027\"Rear Admiral Loschinsky is appointed to command the sea and mining defences.\"\u0027 This question of the fleet forcing its way to Vladivostock was discussed at a conference of flag officers and captains, and they came to the conclusion that it was an absolute impossibility owing to the state of the ships, the shortage of ammunition and men, and to the general conditions being three times as unfavourable as they were at the time of the sortie of August 10. The squadron had indeed been greatly weakened by the transfer of guns to the land defences, by the casualties among the sailors during the assaults in August, by the impossibility of going into dock for below-water repairs, and by its inequality in speed, all of which deprived it of chances[Pg 188] of success. The attempt must have resulted in the destruction of all our ships, as for a whole month the Japanese had been able to repair and rest. An encounter at sea with a force of double its strength, fresh, and with superior speed, to say nothing of the preponderance in destroyers, must have entailed the absolute annihilation of the fleet, and the loss to Arthur of ammunition and several thousand men, whose value had already been well proved. The appointments of Loschinsky and Wiren met with warm approval. During the siege both had equally distinguished themselves, and had shown themselves to be the most energetic, gallant, and capable of the senior naval officers. Notwithstanding his weak state of health, Smirnoff to-day went out to see the work on the third artillery line of defence, which had been newly armed with the naval guns. It ran from the northern part of the town wall to Stonebroken Ridge, Spur Hill, and Big Hill. Roads were being made, trees cut down, and the scene was a confusion of digging, blasting, levelling, building. He remarked: \u0027As soon as this line is finished I shall be happy. I am quite easy about the rest.\u0027 On our way back we met St?ssel. \u0027Aha! so that\u0027s it? Wherever we find the war correspondent we find the Commandant, eh ...?\u0027 was the rude welcome he gave the man whose energies and capabilities had gained for him the reward of Aide-de-camp to the Tsar! pic COLONEL RASCHEVSKY. Aye, and not only was he an aide-de-camp, but he was now a hero, for had he not been promoted to the St. George of the Third Class? Alas! how that Order for gallantry fell in our eyes. It was dreadful to think of the Tsar and the millions of people in Russia who had been deceived by[Pg 189] his false reports. But for this I was forced to go and congratulate him, as for his former honour. After a few moments\u0027 conversation he turned to me. \u0027Who writes the \"News\" in the Novy Kry?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 I had every right to say this, for, though it was not signed, I well knew that St?ssel was aware I wrote it. \u0027What are you doing with yourself?\u0027 \u0027I am collecting materials with which to write a book.\u0027 The General frowned, and his manner changed. \u0027And you will, I suppose, only write the truth in it?\u0027 \u0027Only the truth.\u0027 \u0027Ah! all you correspondents are liars! The one who pays most gets the truth.\u0027 \u0027At present and till the end of the campaign, sir, I am in the power of the censors; but later, taking advantage of the Tsar\u0027s promise to the press representative of the capital, I shall consider it my duty to write the truth—the whole truth, in order that Russia and the Tsar may be spared another Port Arthur. \u0027And I wish to remind you, sir, that my name is an unsullied one, and I belong to one of the oldest of the \"noble\" families.\u0027 Two days later the following District Order appeared: \u0027As the Novy Kry, although warned more than once, continues to publish information of the distribution and movement of our troops which would be better kept secret, the offices of the paper will be closed for one month.\u0027 Colonel Raschevsky wrote as follows in his diary of that date: \u0027St?ssel has published a stupid order about closing the Novy Kry offices on the pretext that it publishes informa[Pg 190]tion about the sorties, patrols, etc., which might be of use to the enemy. It is utterly absurd! The paper passes through the hands of two censors—the Commander of the Port and the Fortress Staff—and suddenly to deprive us, from pure caprice and out of an evident desire to make himself unpleasant to the Commandant, of the only source of information and news from without is,\u0027 etc., etc. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3326/91078.html","bookId":386,"book":{"id":386,"title":"The Truth About Port Arthur","description":"简介： The siege of Port Arthur was the event of the late war in the Far East which most attracted the attention and interest of the rest of the world.
