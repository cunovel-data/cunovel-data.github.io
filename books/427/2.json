{"id":11600,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. HERBERT\u0027S CHANCE.","content":"Herbert left the house of Squire Walsingham in a sober frame of mind. He saw clearly that his mother would not long remain in office, and without her official income they would find it hard to get along. To be sure, she received a pension of eight dollars a month, in consideration of her husband\u0027s services in the war, but eight dollars would not go far towards supporting their family, small as it was. There were other means of earning a living, to be sure, but Wayneboro was an agricultural town mainly, and unless he hired out on a farm there seemed no way open to him, while the little sewing his mother might be able to procure would probably pay her less than a dollar a week. The blow fell sooner than he expected. In the course of the next week Mrs. Carr was notified that Ebenezer Graham had been appointed her successor, and she was directed to turn over the papers and property of the office to him. She received the official notification by the afternoon mail, and in the evening she was favored by a call from her successor. Ebenezer Graham was a small man, with insignificant, mean-looking features, including a pair of weazel-like eyes and a turn-up nose. It did not require a skillful physiognomist to read his character in his face. Meanness was stamped upon it in unmistakable characters. “Good-evening, Mr. Graham,” said the widow, gravely. “Good-evening, ma\u0027am,” said the storekeeper. “I\u0027ve called to see you, Mrs. Carr, about the post office, I presume you have heard—” “I have heard that you are to be my successor.” “Just so. As long as your husband was alive, I didn\u0027t want to step into his shoes.” “But you are willing to step into mine,” said Mrs. Carr, smiling faintly. “Just so—that is, the gov\u0027ment appear to think a man ought to be in charge of so responsible a position.” “I shall be glad if you manage the office better than I have done.” “You see, ma\u0027am, it stands to reason that a man is better fitted for business than a woman,” said Ebenezer Graham, in a smooth tone for he wanted to get over this rather awkward business as easily as possible. “Women, you know, was made to adorn the domestic circles, et cetery.” “Adorning the domestic circle won\u0027t give me a living,” said Mrs. Carr, with some bitterness, for she knew that but for the grasping spirit of the man before her she would have been allowed to retain her office. “I was comin\u0027 to that,” said the new postmaster. “Of course, I appreciate your position as a widder, without much means, and I\u0027m going to make you an offer; that is, your boy, Herbert.” Herbert looked up from a book he was reading, and listened with interest to hear the benevolent intentions of the new postmaster. “I am ready to give him a place in my store,” proceeded Ebenezer. “I always keep a boy, and thinks I to myself, the wages I give will help along the widder Carr. You see, I like to combine business with consideration for my feller creeters.” Mrs. Carr smiled faintly, for in spite of her serious strait she could not help being amused at the notion of Ebenezer Graham\u0027s philanthropy. “What\u0027s going to become of Tom Tripp?” asked Herbert, abruptly. “Thomas Tripp isn\u0027t exactly the kind of boy I want in my store,” said Mr. Graham. “He\u0027s a harum-scarum sort of boy, and likes to shirk his work. Then I suspect he stops to play on the way when I send him on errands. Yesterday he was five minutes longer than he need to have been in goin\u0027 to Sam Dunning\u0027s to carry some groceries. Thomas doesn\u0027t seem to appreciate his privileges in bein\u0027 connected with a business like mine.” Tom Tripp was hardly to blame for not recognizing his good luck in occupying a position where he received a dollar and a half a week for fourteen hours daily work, with half a dozen scoldings thrown in. “How do you know I will suit you any better than Tom?” asked Herbert, who did not think it necessary to thank Mr. Graham for the proffered engagement until he learned just what was expected of him, and what his pay was to be. “You\u0027re a different sort of a boy,” said Ebenezer, with an attempt at a pleasant smile. “You\u0027ve been brought up different. I\u0027ve heard you\u0027re a smart, capable boy, that isn\u0027t afraid of work.” “No, sir, I am not, if I am fairly paid for my work.” The new postmaster\u0027s jaw fell, and he looked uneasy, for he always grudged the money he paid out, even the paltry dollar and a half which went to poor Tom. “I always calkerlate to pay fair wages,” he said; “but I ain\u0027t rich, and I can\u0027t afford to fling away money.” “How much do you pay Tom Tripp?” asked Herbert. He knew, but he wanted to draw Mr. Graham out. “I pay Thomas a dollar and fifty cents a week,” answered the storekeeper, in a tone which indicated that he regarded this, on the whole, as rather a munificent sum. “And he works from seven in the morning till nine o\u0027clock at night,” proceeded Herbert. “Them are the hours,” said Ebenezer, who knew better how to make money than to speak grammatically. “It makes a pretty long day,” observed Mrs. Carr. “So it does, ma\u0027am, but it\u0027s no longer than I work myself.” “You get paid rather better, I presume.” “Of course, ma\u0027am, as I am the proprietor.” “I couldn\u0027t think of working for any such sum,” said Herbert, decidedly. Mr. Graham looked disturbed, for he had reasons for desiring to secure Herbert, who was familiar with the routine of post-office work. “Well,” he said, “I might be able to offer you a leetle more, as you know how to tend the post office. That\u0027s worth somethin\u0027! I\u0027ll give you—lemme see—twenty-five cents more; that is, a dollar and seventy-five cents a week.” Herbert and his mother exchanged glances. They hardly knew whether to feel more amused or disgusted at their visitor\u0027s meanness. “Mr. Graham,” said Herbert, “if you wish to secure my services, you will have to pay me three dollars a week.” The storekeeper held up both hands in dismay. “Three dollars a week for a boy!” he exclaimed. “Yes, sir; I will come for a short time for that sum, till you get used to the management of the post office, but I shall feel justified in leaving you when I can do better.” “You must think I am made of money,” said Ebenezer hastily. “I think you can afford to pay me that salary.” For twenty minutes the new postmaster tried to beat down his prospective clerk, but Herbert was obstinate, and Ebenezer rather ruefully promised to give him his price, chiefly because it was absolutely necessary that he should engage some one who was more familiar with the post-office work than he was. Herbert agreed to go to work the next morning. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2962/81506.html","bookId":427,"book":{"id":427,"title":"Do and Dare A Brave Boy\u0027s Fight for Fortune","description":"简介： If we could only keep the post office, mother, we should be all right, said Herbert Carr, as he and his mother sat together in the little sitting room of the plain cottage which the two had occupied ever since he was a boy of five....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2962","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
