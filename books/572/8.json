{"id":12311,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII UPS AND DOWNS","content":"We left Lucy in tears and Philip in the grasp of the hateful Pretenderette, who, seated on the Hippogriff, was bearing him away across the smooth blueness of the wide sea. \n \n \u0027Oh, Mr. Noah,\u0027 said Lucy, between sniffs and sobs, \u0027how can she! You did say the Hippogriff could only carry one!\u0027 \n \n \u0027One ordinary human being,\u0027 said Mr. Noah gently; \u0027you forget that dear Philip is now an earl.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But do you really think he\u0027s safe?\u0027 Lucy asked. \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027And now, dear Lucy, no more questions. Since your arrival on our shores I have been gradually growing more accustomed to being questioned, but I still find it unpleasant and fatiguing. Desist, I entreat.\u0027 \n \n So Lucy desisted and every one went to[219] bed, and, for crying is very tiring, to sleep. But not for long. \n \n Lucy was awakened in her bed of soft dry seaweed by the sound of the castle alarm bell, and by the blaring of trumpets and the shouting of many voices. A bright light shone in at the window of her room. She jumped up and ran to the window and leaned out. Below lay the great courtyard of the castle, a moving sea of people on which hundreds of torches seemed to float, and the sound of shouting rose in the air as foam rises in the wind. \n \n \u0027The Fear! The Fear!\u0027 people were shouting. \u0027To the ark! to the ark!\u0027 And the black night that pressed round the castle was loud with the wild roar of waves and the shriek of a tumultuous wind. \n \n Lucy ran to the door of her room. But suddenly she stopped. \n \n \u0027My clothes,\u0027 she said. And dressed herself hastily. For she perceived that her own petticoats and shoes were likely to have better wearing qualities than seaweed could possess, and if they were all going to take refuge in the ark, she felt she would rather have her own clothes on. \n \n \u0027Mr. Noah is sure to come for me,\u0027 she most sensibly told herself. \u0027And I\u0027ll get as many clothes on as I can.\u0027 Her own dress, of[220] course, had been left at Polistopolis, but the ballet dress would be better than the seaweed tunic. When she was dressed she ran into Philip\u0027s room and rolled his clothes into a little bundle and carried it under her arm as she ran down the stairs. Half-way down she met Mr. Noah coming up. \n \n \u0027Ah! you\u0027re ready,\u0027 he said; \u0027it is well. Do not be alarmed, my Lucy. The tide is rising but slowly. There will be time for every one to escape. All is in train, and the embarkation of the animals is even now in progress. There has been a little delay in sorting the beasts into pairs. But we are getting on. The Lord High Islander is showing remarkable qualities. All the big animals are on board; the pigs were being coaxed on as I came up. And the ant-eaters are having a late supper. Do not be alarmed.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I can\u0027t help being alarmed,\u0027 said Lucy, slipping her free hand into Mr. Noah\u0027s, \u0027but I won\u0027t cry or be silly. Oh, I do wish Philip was here.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Most unreasonable of girl children,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027we are in danger and you wish him to be here to share it?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, we are in danger, are we?\u0027 said Lucy quickly. \u0027I thought you said I wasn\u0027t to be alarmed.\u0027[221] \n \n \u0027No more you are,\u0027 said Mr. Noah shortly; \u0027of course you\u0027re in danger. But there\u0027s me. And there\u0027s the ark. What more do you want?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 Lucy answered in a very small voice, and the two made their way to a raised platform overlooking the long inclined road which led up to the tower on which the ark had been built. A long procession toiled slowly up it of animals in pairs, urged and goaded by the M.A.\u0027s under the orders of the Lord High Islander. \n \n The wild wind blew the flames of the torches out like golden streamers, and the sound of the waves was like thunder on the shore. \n \n Down below other M.A.\u0027s were busy carrying bales tied up in seaweed. Seen from above the busy figures looked like ants when you kick into an ant-hill and the little ant people run this way and that way and every way about their little ant businesses. \n \n The Lord High Islander came in pale and serious, with all the calm competence of Napoleon at a crisis. \n \n \u0027Sorry to have to worry you, sir,\u0027 he said to Mr. Noah, \u0027but of course your experience is invaluable just now. I can\u0027t remember what bears eat. Is it hay or meat?\u0027 \n \n \u0027It\u0027s buns,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027I beg your pardon,[222] Mr. Noah. Of course I ought to have waited for you to say.\u0027 \n \n \u0027In my ark,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027buns were unknown and bears were fed entirely on honey, the providing of which kept our pair of bees fully employed. But if you are sure bears like buns we must always be humane, dear Lucy, and study the natural taste of the animals in our charge.\u0027 \n \n \u0027They love them,\u0027 said Lucy. \n \n \u0027Buns and honey,\u0027 said the Lord Islander; \u0027and what about bats?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t know what bats eat,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027I believe it was settled after some discussion that they don\u0027t eat cats. But what they do eat is one of the eleven mysteries. You had better let the bats fast.\u0027 \n \n \u0027They are, sir,\u0027 said the Lord High Islander. \n \n \u0027And is all going well? Shall I come down and lend a personal eye?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I think I\u0027m managing all right, sir,\u0027 said the Lord High Islander modestly. \u0027You see it\u0027s a great honour for me. The M.A.\u0027s are carrying in the provisions, the boys are stowing them and also herding the beasts. They are very good workers, sir.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Are you frightened?\u0027 Lucy whispered, as he turned to go back to his overseeing.[223] \n A long procession toiled slowly up it of animals in pairs. A long procession toiled slowly up it of animals in pairs. \n \n [224] \n [225] \n \n \u0027Not I,\u0027 said the Lord High Islander. \u0027Don\u0027t you understand that I\u0027ve been promoted to be Lord Vice-Noah of Polistarchia? And of course the hearts of all Vice-Noahs are strangers to fear. But just think what a difficult thing Fear would have been to be a stranger to if you and Philip hadn\u0027t got us the ark!\u0027 \n \n \u0027It was Philip\u0027s doing,\u0027 said Lucy; \u0027oh, do you think he\u0027s all right?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I think his heart is a stranger to fear, naturally,\u0027 said the Lord High Islander, \u0027so he\u0027s certain to be all right.\u0027 \n \n When the last of the animals had sniffed and snivelled its way into the ark—it was a porcupine with a cold in its head—the islanders, the M.A.\u0027s, Lucy and Mr. Noah followed. And when every one was in, the door of the ark was shut from inside by an ingenious mechanical contrivance worked by a more than usually intelligent M.A. \n \n You must not suppose that the inside of the ark was anything like the inside of your own Noah\u0027s ark, where all the animals are put in anyhow, all mixed together and wrong way up as likely as not. That, with live animals and live people, would, as you will readily imagine, be quite uncomfortable. The inside of the ark which had been built under the[226] direction of Mr. Noah and Mr. Perrin was not at all like that. It was more like the inside of a big Atlantic liner than anything else I can think of. All the animals were stowed away in suitable stalls, and there were delightful cabins for all those for whom cabins were suitable. The islanders and the M.A.\u0027s retired to their cabins in perfect order, and Lucy and Mr. Noah, Mr. Perrin and the Lord High Islander gathered in the saloon, which was large and had walls and doors of inlaid mother-of-pearl and pink coral. It was lighted by glass globes filled with phosphorus collected by an ingenious process invented by another of the M.A.\u0027s. \n \n \u0027And now,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027I beg that anxiety may be dismissed from every mind. If the waters subside, they leave us safe. If they rise, as I confidently expect them to do, our ark will float, and we still are safe. In the morning I will take soundings and begin to steer a course. We will select a suitable spot on the shore, land and proceed to the Hidden Places, where we will consult the oracle. A little refreshment before we retire for what is left of the night? A captain\u0027s biscuit would perhaps not be inappropriate?\u0027 He took a tin from a locker and handed it round. \n \n \u0027That\u0027s A1, sir,\u0027 said the Lord High[227] Islander, munching. \u0027What a head you have for the right thing.\u0027 \n \n \u0027All practice,\u0027 said Mr. Noah modestly. \n \n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Lucy, taking a biscuit; \u0027I wish. . . .\u0027 \n \n The sentence was never finished. With a sickening suddenness the floor of the saloon heaved up under their feet, a roaring surging battering sound broke round them; the saloon tipped over on one side and the whole party was thrown on the pink silk cushions of the long settee. A shudder seemed to run through the ark from end to end, and \u0027What is it? Oh! what is it?\u0027 cried Lucy as the ark heeled over the other way and the unfortunate occupants were thrown on to the opposite set of cushions. (It really was, now, rather like what you imagine the inside of your Noah\u0027s ark must be when you put in Mr. Noah and his family and a few hastily chosen animals and shake them all up together.) \n \n \u0027It\u0027s the sea,\u0027 cried the Lord High Islander; \u0027it\u0027s the great Fear come upon us! And I\u0027m not afraid!\u0027 He drew himself up as well as he could in his cramped position, with Mr. Noah\u0027s elbow pinning his shoulder down and Mr. Perrin\u0027s boot on his ear. \n \n With a shake and a shiver the ark righted itself, and the floor of the saloon got flat again.[228] \n \n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Mr. Perrin, resuming control of his boot; \u0027good workmanship, it do tell. She ain\u0027t shipped a drop, Mr. Noah, sir.\u0027 \n \n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, taking his elbow to himself and standing up rather shakily on his yellow mat. \n \u0027We\u0027re afloat, we\u0027re afloat \n On the dark rolling tide; \n The ark\u0027s water-tight \n And the crew are inside. \n \n \u0027Up, up with the flag \n Let it wave o\u0027er the sea; \n We\u0027re afloat, we\u0027re afloat— \n And what else should we be?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Lucy; \u0027but there isn\u0027t any flag, is there?\u0027 \n \n \u0027The principle\u0027s the same,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027but I\u0027m afraid we didn\u0027t think of a flag.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I did,\u0027 said Mr. Perrin; \u0027it\u0027s only a Jubilee hankey\u0027—he drew it slowly from his breast-pocket, a cotton union Jack it was—\u0027but it shall wave all right. But not till daylight, I think, sir. Discretion\u0027s the better part of—don\u0027t you think, Mr. Noah, sir? Wouldn\u0027t do to open the ark out of hours, so to speak!\u0027 \n \n \u0027Just so,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027One, two, three! Bed!\u0027 \n \n The ark swayed easily on a sea not too[229] rough. The saloon passengers staggered to their cabins. And silence reigned in the ark. \n * * * * * * \n \n I am sorry to say that the Pretenderette dropped the wicker cage containing the parrot into the sea—an unpardonable piece of cruelty and revenge; unpardonable, that is, unless you consider that she did not really know any better. The Hippogriff\u0027s white wings swept on; Philip, now laid across the knees of the Pretenderette (a most undignified attitude for any boy, and I hope none of you may be placed in such a position), screamed as the cage struck the water, and, \u0027Oh, Polly!\u0027 he cried. \n \n \u0027All right,\u0027 the parrot answered; \u0027keep your pecker up!\u0027 \n \n \u0027What did it say?\u0027 the Pretenderette asked. \n \n \u0027Something about peck,\u0027 said Philip upside down. \n \n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said the Pretenderette with satisfaction, \u0027he won\u0027t do any more pecking for some time to come.\u0027 And the wide Hippogriff wings swept on over the wide sea. \n \n Polly\u0027s cage fell and floated. And it floated alone till the dawn, when, with wheelings and waftings and cries, the gulls came from far and near to see what this new strange thing might be that bobbed up and down in their waters in the light of the new-born day.[230] \n \n \u0027Hullo!\u0027 said Polly in bird-talk, clinging upside down to the top bars of the cage. \n \n \u0027Hullo, yourself,\u0027 replied the eldest gull; \u0027what\u0027s up? And who are you? And what are you doing in that unnatural lobster pot?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I conjure you,\u0027 said the parrot earnestly, \u0027I conjure you by our common birdhood to help me in my misfortune.\u0027 \n \n \u0027No gull who is a gull can resist that appeal,\u0027 said the master of the sea birds; \u0027what can we do, brother-bird?\u0027 \n \n \u0027The matter is urgent,\u0027 said Polly, but quite calmly. \u0027I am getting very wet and I dislike salt water. It is bad for my plumage. May I give an order to your followers, bird-brother?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Give,\u0027 said the master gull, with a graceful wheel and whirl of his splendid wings. \n \n \u0027Let four of my brothers raise this detested trap high above the waves,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027and let others of you, with your brave strong beaks, break through the bars and set me free.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Delighted,\u0027 said the master gull; \u0027any little thing, you know,\u0027 and his own high-bred beak was the first to take hold of the cage, which presently the gulls lifted in the air and broke through, setting the parrot free. \n \n \u0027Thank you, brother-birds,\u0027 the parrot said, shaking wet wings and spreading them; \u0027one[231] good turn deserves another. The beach yonder was white with cockles but yesterday.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Thank you, brother-bird,\u0027 they all said, and flew fleetly cocklewards. \n \n And that was how the parrot got free from the cage and went back to the shore to have that little talk with the blugraiwee which I told you about in the last chapter. \n * * * * * * \n \n The ark was really very pleasant by daylight with the sun shining in at its windows. The sun shone outside as well, of course, and the union Jack waved cheerfully in the wind. Breakfast was served on the terrace at the end of the ark—you know—that terrace where the boat part turns up. It was a very nice breakfast, and the sea was quite smooth—a quite perfect sea. This was rather fortunate, for there was nothing else. Sea on every side of the ark. No land at all. \n \n \u0027However shall we find the way,\u0027 Lucy asked the Lord High Islander, \u0027with nothing but sea?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh,\u0027 he answered, \u0027that\u0027s all the better, really. Mr. Noah steers much better when there\u0027s no land in sight. It\u0027s all practice, you know.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And when we come in sight of land, will he steer badly then?\u0027[232] \n \n \u0027Oh, anybody can steer then,\u0027 said Billy; \u0027you if you like.\u0027 So it was Lucy who steered the ark into harbour, under Mr. Noah\u0027s directions. Arks are very easy to steer if you only know the way. Of course arks are not like other vessels; they require neither sails nor steam engines, nor oars to make them move. The very arkishness of the ark makes it move just as the steersman wishes. He only has to say \u0027Port,\u0027 \u0027Starboard,\u0027 \u0027Right ahead,\u0027 \u0027Slow\u0027 and so on, and the ark (unlike many people I know) immediately does as it is told. So steering was easy and pleasant; one just had to keep the ark\u0027s nose towards the distant domes and pinnacles of a town that shone and glittered on the shore a few miles away. And the town grew nearer and nearer, and the black streak that was the people of the town began to show white dots that were the people\u0027s faces. And then the ark was moored against a quay side, and a friendly populace cheered as Mr. Noah stepped on to firm land, to be welcomed by the governor of the town and a choice selection of eminent citizens. \n \n \u0027It\u0027s quite an event for them,\u0027 said Mr. Perrin. \u0027They don\u0027t have much happening here. A very lazy lot they be, almost as bad as Somnolentia.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What makes them lazy?\u0027 Lucy asked.[233] \n \n \u0027It\u0027s owing to the onions and potatoes growing wild in these parts, I believe,\u0027 said the Lord High Islander. \u0027They get enough to eat without working. And the onions make them sleepy.\u0027 \n \n They talked apart while Mr. Noah was arranging things with the Governor of the town, who had come down to the harbour in a hurry and a flurry and a furry gown. \n \n \u0027I\u0027ve arranged everything,\u0027 said Mr. Noah at last. \u0027The islanders and the M.A.\u0027s and the animals are to be allowed to camp in the public park till we\u0027ve consulted the oracle and decided what\u0027s to be done with them. They must live somewhere, I suppose. Life has become much too eventful for me lately. However there are only three more deeds for the Earl of Ark to do, and then perhaps we shall have a little peace and quietness.\u0027 \n \n \u0027The Earl of Ark?\u0027 Lucy repeated. \n \n \u0027Philip, you know. I do wish you\u0027d try to remember that he\u0027s an earl now. Now you and I must take camel and be off.\u0027 \n \n And now came seven long days of camel travelling, through desert and forest and over hill and through valley, till at last Lucy and Mr. Noah came to the Hidden Place where the oracle is, and where that is I may not tell you—because it\u0027s one of the eleven mysteries. And I must[234] not tell you what the oracle is because that is another of the mysteries. But I may tell you that if you want to consult the oracle you have to go a long way between rows of round pillars, rather like those in Egyptian tombs. And as you go it gets darker and darker, and when it is quite dark you see a little, little light a very long way off, and you hear very far away, a beautiful music, and you smell the scent of flowers that do not grow in any wood or field or garden of this earth. Mixed with this scent is the scent of incense and of old tapestried rooms, where no one has lived for a very long time. And you remember all the sad and beautiful things you have ever seen or heard, and you fall down on the ground and hide your face in your hands and call on the oracle, and if you are the right sort of person the oracle answers you. \n \n Lucy and Mr. Noah waited in the dark for the voice of the oracle, and at last it spoke. Lucy heard no words, only the most beautiful voice in the world speaking softly, and so sweetly and finely and bravely that at once she felt herself brave enough to dare any danger, and strong enough to do any deed that might be needed to get Philip out of the clutches of the base Pretenderette. All the tiredness of her long journey faded away, and but for the thought that Philip needed her, she[235] would have been content to listen for ever to that golden voice. Everything else in the world faded away and grew to seem worthless and unmeaning. Only the soft golden voice remained and the grey hard voice that said, \u0027You\u0027ve got to look after Philip, you know!\u0027 And the two voices together made a harmony more beautiful than you will find in any of Beethoven\u0027s sonatas. Because Lucy knew that she should follow the grey voice, and remember the golden voice as long as she lived. \n \n But something was tiresomely pulling at her sleeve, dragging her away from the wonderful golden voice. Mr. Noah was pulling her sleeve and saying, \u0027Come away,\u0027 and they turned their backs on the little light and the music and the enchanting perfumes, and instantly the voice stopped and they were walking between dusky pillars towards a far grey speck of sunlight. \n \n It was not till they were once more under the bare sky that Lucy said: \n \n \u0027What did it say?\u0027 \n \n \u0027You must have heard,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \n \n \u0027I only heard the voice and what it meant. I didn\u0027t understand the words. But the voice was like dreams and everything beautiful I\u0027ve ever thought of.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I thought it a wonderfully straight-forward[236] business-like oracle,\u0027 said Mr. Noah briskly; \u0027and the voice was quite distinct and I remember every word it said.\u0027 \n \n (Which just shows how differently the same thing may strike two people.) \n \n \u0027What did it say?\u0027 Lucy asked, trotting along beside him, still clutching Philip\u0027s bundle, which through all these days she had never let go. \n \n And Mr. Noah gravely recited the following lines. I agree with him that, for an oracle, they were extremely straightforward. \n \u0027You had better embark \n Once again in the Ark, \n And sailing from dryland \n Make straight for the Island.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Did it really say that?\u0027 Lucy asked. \n \n \u0027Of course it did,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027that\u0027s a special instruction to me, but I daresay you heard something quite different. The oracle doesn\u0027t say the same thing to every one, of course. Didn\u0027t you get any special instruction?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Only to try to be brave and good,\u0027 said Lucy shyly. \n \n \u0027Well, then,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027you carry out your instructions and I\u0027ll carry out mine.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But what\u0027s the use of going to the island if you can\u0027t land when you get there?\u0027 Lucy[237] insisted. \u0027You know only two people can land there, and we\u0027re not them, are we?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, if you begin asking what\u0027s the use, we shan\u0027t get anywhere,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027And more than half the things you say are questions.\u0027 \n * * * * * * \n \n I\u0027m sorry this chapter is cut up into bits with lines of stars, but stars are difficult to avoid when you have to tell about a lot of different things happening all at once. That is why it is much better always to keep your party together if you can. And I have allowed mine to get separated so that Philip, the parrot and the rest of the company are going through three sets of adventures all at the same time. This is most trying for me, and fully accounts for the stars. Which I hope you\u0027ll excuse. However. \n \n We now come back by way of the stars to Philip wrong way up in the clutches of the Pretenderette. She had breathed the magic word in the Hippogriff\u0027s ear, but she had not added any special order. So the Hippogriff was entirely its own master as far as the choice of where it was to go was concerned. It tossed its white mane after circling three times between air and sky, made straight for the Island-where-you-mayn\u0027t-go. The Pretender[238]ette didn\u0027t know that it was the Island-where-you-mayn\u0027t-go, and as they got nearer and she could see plainly its rainbow-coloured sands, its palms and its waterfalls, its cool green thickets and many tinted flowers and glowing fruits, it seemed to her that she might do worse than land there and rest for a little while. For even the most disagreeable people get tired sometimes, and the Pretenderette had had a hard day of it. So she made no attempt to check the Hippogriff or alter its course. And when the Hippogriff was hovering but a few inches from the grass of the most beautiful of the island glades, she jerked Philip roughly off her knee and he fell all in a heap on the ground. With great presence of mind our hero—if he isn\u0027t a hero by now he never will be—picked himself up and bolted into the bushes. No rabbit could have bolted more instantly and fleetly. \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll teach you,\u0027 said the furious Pretenderette, preparing to alight. She looked down to find a soft place to jump on. And then she saw that every blade of grass was a tiny spear of steel, and every spear was pointed at her. She made the Hippogriff take her to another glade—more little steel spears. To the rainbow sands—but on looking at them she saw that they were quivering quicksands.[239] Wherever green grass had grown the spears now grew; and wherever the sand was it was a terrible trap of quicksand. She tried to dismount in a little pool, but fortunately for her she noticed in time that what shone in it so silvery was not water but white-hot molten metal. \n \n \u0027What a nasty place,\u0027 said the Pretenderette; \u0027I don\u0027t know that I could have chosen a nastier place to leave that naughty child in. He\u0027ll know who\u0027s master by the time I send to fetch him back to prison. Here, you, get back to Polistopolis as fast as you can. See? Please, I mean,\u0027 she added, and then she spoke the magic word. \n \n Philip was peeping through the bushes close by, and he heard that magic word (I dare not tell you what it is) and he saw for the first time the face of the Pretenderette. And he trembled and shivered in his bushy lurking-place. For the Pretenderette was the only really unpleasant person Philip had ever met in the world. It was Lucy\u0027s nurse, the nurse with the grey dress and the big fat feet, who had been so cross to him and had pulled down his city. \n \n \u0027How on earth,\u0027 Philip wondered to himself, \u0027did she get here? And how on earth shall I get away from her?\u0027 He had not seen[240] the spears and the quicksands and the molten metal, and he was waiting unhappily for her to alight, and for a game of hide and seek to begin, which he was not at all anxious to play. \n \n Even as he wondered, the Hippogriff spread wings and flew away. And Philip was left alone on the island. But what did that matter? It was much better to be alone than with that Pretenderette. And for Philip there were no white-hot metal and spears and snares of quicksand, only dewy grass and sweet flowers and trees and safety and delight. \n \n \u0027If only Lucy were here,\u0027 he said. \n Walked straight into the arms of Helen. Walked straight into the arms of Helen. \n \n When he was quite sure that the Pretenderette was really gone, he came out and explored the island. It had on it every kind of flower and fruit that you can think of, all growing together. There were gold oranges and white orange flowers, pink apple-blossom and red apples, cherries and cherry-blossom, strawberry flowers and strawberries, all growing together, wild and sweet. \n \n At the back of his mind Philip remembered that he had, at some time or other, heard of an island where fruit and blossoms grew together at the same time, but that was all he could remember. He passed through the lovely orchards and came to a lake. It was frozen. And he remembered that, in the island he had[241] heard of, there was a lake ready for skating even when the flowers and fruit were on the trees. Then he came to a little summer-house built all of porcupine quills like Helen\u0027s pen-box. \n \n And then he knew. All these wonders were on the island that he and Helen had invented long ago—the island that she used to draw maps of. \n \n \u0027It\u0027s our very own island,\u0027 he said, and a glorious feeling of being at home glowed through him, warm and delightful. \u0027We said no one else might come here! That\u0027s why the Pretenderette couldn\u0027t land. And why they call it the Island-where-you-mayn\u0027t-go. I\u0027ll find the bun tree and have something to eat, and then I\u0027ll go to the boat-house and get out the Lightning Loose and go back for Lucy. I do wish I could bring her here. But of course I can\u0027t without asking Helen.\u0027 \n \n The Lightning Loose was the magic yacht Helen had invented for the island. \n \n He soon found a bush whose fruit was buns, and a jam-tart tree grew near it. You have no idea how nice jam tarts can taste till you have gathered them yourself, fresh and sticky, from the tree. They are as sticky as horse-chestnut buds, and much nicer to eat. \n \n As he went towards the boat-house he grew[242] happier and happier, recognising, one after the other, all the places he and Helen had planned and marked on the map. He passed by the marble and gold house with King\u0027s Palace painted on the door. He longed to explore it: but the thought of Lucy drove him on. As he went down a narrow leafy woodland path towards the boat-house, he passed the door of the dear little thatched cottage (labelled Queen\u0027s Palace) which was the house Helen had insisted that she liked best for her very own. \n \n \u0027How pretty it is; I wish Helen was here,\u0027 he said; \u0027she helped to make it. I should never have thought of it without her. She ought to be here,\u0027 he said. With that he felt very lonely, all of a sudden, and very sad. And as he went on, wondering whether in all this magic world there might not somehow be some magic strong enough to bring Helen there to see the island that was their very own, and to give her consent to his bringing Lucy to it, he turned a corner in the woodland path, and walked straight into the arms of—Helen. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2055/58506.html","bookId":572,"book":{"id":572,"title":"The Magic City","description":"简介： Philip Haldane and his sister lived in a little red-roofed house in a little red-roofed town.
