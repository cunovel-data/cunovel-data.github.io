{"id":12306,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III LOST","content":"Philip went to sleep, and dreamed that he was at home again and that Helen had come to his bedside to call him, leading a white pony that was to be his very own. It was a pony that looked clever enough for anything, and he was not surprised when it shook hands with him; but when it said, \u0027Well, we must be moving,\u0027 and began to try to put on Philip\u0027s shoes and stockings, Philip called out, \u0027Here, I say, stop that,\u0027 and awoke to a room full of sunshine, but empty of ponies. \u0027Oh, well,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027I suppose I\u0027d better get up.\u0027 He looked at his new silver watch, one of Helen\u0027s parting presents, and saw that it marked ten o\u0027clock. \u0027I say, you know,\u0027 said he to the watch, \u0027you can\u0027t be right.\u0027 And he shook it to encourage it to think over the matter. But[66] the watch still said \u0027ten\u0027 quite plainly and unmistakably. Now the Grange breakfast time was at eight. And Philip was certain he had not been called. \u0027This is jolly rum,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027It must be the watch. Perhaps it\u0027s stopped.\u0027 But it hadn\u0027t stopped. Therefore it must be two hours past breakfast time. The moment he had thought this he became extremely hungry. He got out of bed as soon as he knew exactly how hungry he was. There was no one about, so he made his way to the bath-room and spent a happy hour with the hot water and the cold water, and the brown Windsor soap and the shaving soap and the nail brush and the flesh brush and the loofahs and the shower bath and the three sponges. He had not, so far, been able thoroughly to investigate and enjoy all these things. But now there was no one to interfere, and he enjoyed himself to that degree that he quite forgot to wonder why he hadn\u0027t been called. He thought of a piece of poetry that Helen had made for him, about the bath; and when he had done playing he lay on his back in water that was very hot indeed, trying to remember the poetry. The water was very nearly cold by the time he had remembered the[67] poetry. It was called Dreams of a Giant Life, and this was it. DREAMS OF A GIANT LIFE What was I once—in ages long ago? I look back, and I see myself. We grow So changed through changing years, I hardly see How that which I look back on could be me?[1] Glorious and splendid, giant-like I stood On a white cliff, topped by a darkling wood. Below me, placid, bright and sparkling, lay The equal waters of a lovely bay. White cliffs surrounded it—and calm and fair It lay asleep, in warm and silent air. I stood alone—naked and strong, upright My limbs gleamed in the clear pure golden light. I saw below me all the water lie Expecting something, and that thing was I.[2] I leaned, I plunged, the waves splashed over me. I lay, a giant in a little sea. White cliffs all round, wood-crowned, and as I lay I saw the glories of the dying day; No wind disturbed my sea; the sunlight was As though it came through windows of gold glass. The white cliffs rose above me, and around The clear sea lay, pure, perfect and profound; And I was master of the cliffs, the sea, And the gold light that brightened over me. Far miles away my giant feet showed plain, Rising, like rocks out of the quiet main. On them a lighthouse could be built, to show [68]Wayfaring ships the way they must not go. I was the master of that cliff-girt sea. I splashed my hands, the waves went over me, And in the dimples of my body lay Little rock-pools, where small sea-beasts might play. I found a boat, its deck was perforate; I launched it, and it dared the storms of fate. Its woollen sail stood out against the sky, Supported by a mast of ivory. Another boat rode proudly to my hand, Upon its deck a thousand spears did stand; I launched it, and it sped full fierce and fast Against the boat that had the ivory mast And woollen sail and perforated deck. The two went down in one stupendous wreck! Beneath the waves I chased with joyous hand Upon the bed of an imagined sand The slippery brown sea mouse, that still escaped, Where the deep cave beneath my knee was shaped. Caught it at last and caged it into rest Upon the shallows of my submerged breast. Then, as I lay, wrapped as in some kind arm By the sweet world of waters soft and warm, A great voice cried, from some far unseen shore, And I was not a giant any more. \u0027Come out, come out,\u0027 cried out the voice of power, \u0027You\u0027ve been in for a quarter of an hour. The water\u0027s cold—come, Master Pip—your head \u0027S all wet, and it is time you were in bed.\u0027 I rose all dripping from the magic sea And left the ships that had been slaves to me— The soap-dish, with its perforated deck, The nail-brush, that had rushed to loss and wreck, The flannel sail, the tooth-brush that was mast, [69]The sleek soap-mouse—I left them all at last. I went out of that magic sea and cried Because the time came when I must be dried And leave the splendour of a giant\u0027s joy And go to bed—a little well-washed boy. When he had quite remembered the poetry he had another shower-bath, and then when he had enjoyed the hot rough towels out of the hot cupboard he went back to his room to dress. He now felt how deeply he wanted his breakfast, so he dressed himself with all possible speed, even forgetting to fasten his bootlaces properly. He was in such a hurry that he dropped his collar-stud, and it was as he stooped to pick it up that he remembered his dream. Do you know that was really the first time he had thought of it. The dream—that indeed would be something to think about. Breakfast was the really important thing. He went down very hungry indeed. \u0027I shall ask for my breakfast directly I get down,\u0027 he said. \u0027I shall ask the first person I meet.\u0027 And he met no one. There was no one on the stairs, or in the hall, or in the dining-room, or in the drawing-room. The library and billiard-room were empty of living people, and the door of the nursery was locked. So then Philip made his way into the regions beyond the baize door, where the servants\u0027 quarters were. And there was no[70] one in the kitchen, or in the servants\u0027 hall, or in the butler\u0027s pantry, or in the scullery, or the washhouse, or the larder. In all that big house, and it was much bigger than it looked from the front because of the long wings that ran out on each side of its back—in all that big house there was no one but Philip. He felt certain of this before he ran upstairs and looked in all the bedrooms and in the little picture gallery and the music-room, and then in the servants\u0027 bedrooms and the very attics. There were interesting things in those attics, but Philip only remembered that afterwards. Now he tore down the stairs three at a time. All the room doors were open as he had left them, and somehow those open doors frightened him more than anything else. He ran along the corridors, down more stairs, past more open doors and out through the back kitchen, along the moss-grown walk by the brick wall and so round by the three yew trees and the mounting block to the stable-yard. And there was no one there. Neither coachman nor groom nor stable-boys. And there was no one in the stables, or the coach-house, or the harness-room, or the loft. Philip felt that he could not go back into the house. Something terrible must have happened. Was it possible that any one could[71] want the Grange servants enough to kidnap them? Philip thought of the nurse and felt that, at least as far as she was concerned, it was not possible. Or perhaps it was magic! A sort of Sleeping-Beauty happening! Only every one had vanished instead of just being put to sleep for a hundred years. He was alone in the middle of the stable-yard when the thought came to him. \u0027Perhaps they\u0027re only made invisible. Perhaps they\u0027re all here and watching me and making fun of me.\u0027 He stood still to think this. It was not a pleasant thought. Suddenly he straightened his little back, and threw back his head. \u0027They shan\u0027t see I\u0027m frightened anyway,\u0027 he told himself. And then he remembered the larder. \u0027I haven\u0027t had any breakfast,\u0027 he explained aloud, so as to be plainly heard by any invisible people who might be about. \u0027I ought to have my breakfast. If nobody gives it to me I shall take my breakfast.\u0027 He waited for an answer. But none came. It was very quiet in the stable-yard. Only the rattle of a halter ring against a manger, the sound of a hoof on stable stones, the cooing of[72] pigeons and the rustle of straw in the loose-box broke the silence. \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I don\u0027t know what you think I ought to have for breakfast, so I shall take what I think.\u0027 He drew a long breath, trying to draw courage in with it, threw back his shoulders more soldierly than ever, and marched in through the back door and straight to the larder. Then he took what he thought he ought to have for breakfast. This is what he thought: 1 cherry pie, 2 custards in cups, 1 cold sausage, 2 pieces of cold toast, 1 piece of cheese, 2 lemon cheese-cakes, 1 small jam tart (there was only one left), Butter, 1 pat. \u0027What jolly things the servants have to eat,\u0027 he said. \u0027I never knew. I thought that nothing but mutton and rice grew here.\u0027 He put all the food on a silver tray and carried it out on to the terrace, which lies between the two wings at the back of the house. Then he went back for milk, but there was none to be seen so he got a white jug full of water. The spoons he couldn\u0027t find, but he[73] found a carving-fork and a fish-slice. Did you ever try to eat cherry pie with a fish-slice? \u0027Whatever\u0027s happened,\u0027 said Philip to himself, through the cherry pie, \u0027and whatever happens it\u0027s as well to have had your breakfast.\u0027 And he bit a generous inch off the cold sausage which he had speared with the carving-fork. And now, sitting out in the good sunshine, and growing less and less hungry as he plied fish-slice and carving-fork, his mind went back to his dream, which began to seem more and more real. Suppose it really had happened? It might have; magic things did happen, it seemed. Look how all the people had vanished out of the house—out of the world too, perhaps. \u0027Suppose every one\u0027s vanished,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027Suppose I\u0027m the only person left in the world who hasn\u0027t vanished. Then everything in the world would belong to me. Then I could have everything that\u0027s in all the toy shops.\u0027 And his mind for a moment dwelt fondly on this beautiful idea. Then he went on. \u0027But suppose I vanished too? Perhaps if I were to vanish I could see the other people who have. I wonder how it\u0027s done.\u0027 He held his breath and tried hard to vanish. Have you ever tried this? It is not at all[74] easy to do. Philip could not do it at all. He held his breath and he tried and he tried, but he only felt fatter and fatter and more and more as though in one more moment he should burst. So he let his breath go. \u0027No,\u0027 he said, looking at his hands; \u0027I\u0027m not any more invisible than I was before. Not so much I think,\u0027 he added thoughtfully, looking at what was left of the cherry pie. \u0027But that dream——\u0027 He plunged deep in the remembrance of it that was, to him, like swimming in the waters of a fairy lake. He was hooked out of his lake suddenly by voices. It was like waking up. There, away across the green park beyond the sunk fence, were people coming. \u0027So every one hasn\u0027t vanished,\u0027 he said, caught up the tray and took it in. He hid it under the pantry shelf. He didn\u0027t know who the people were who were coming and you can\u0027t be too careful. Then he went out and made himself small in the shadow of a red buttress, heard their voices coming nearer and nearer. They were all talking at once, in that quick interested way that makes you certain something unusual has happened. He could not hear exactly what they were saying, but he caught the words: \u0027No.\u0027[75] \u0027Of course I\u0027ve asked.\u0027 \u0027Police.\u0027 \u0027Telegram.\u0027 \u0027Yes, of course.\u0027 \u0027Better make quite sure.\u0027 Then every one began speaking all at once, and you could not hear anything that anybody said. Philip was too busy keeping behind the buttress to see who they were who were talking. He was glad something had happened. \u0027Now I shall have something to think about besides the nurse and my beautiful city that she has pulled down.\u0027 But what was it that had happened? He hoped nobody was hurt—or had done anything wrong. The word police had always made him uncomfortable ever since he had seen a boy no bigger than himself pulled along the road by a very large policeman. The boy had stolen a loaf, Philip was told. Philip could never forget that boy\u0027s face; he always thought of it in church when it said \u0027prisoners and captives,\u0027 and still more when it said \u0027desolate and oppressed.\u0027 \u0027I do hope it\u0027s not that,\u0027 he said. And slowly he got himself to leave the shelter of the red-brick buttress and to follow to the house those voices and those footsteps that had gone by him.[76] He followed the sound of them to the kitchen. The cook was there in tears and a Windsor arm-chair. The kitchenmaid, her cap all on one side, was crying down most dirty cheeks. The coachman was there, very red in the face, and the groom, without his gaiters. The nurse was there, neat as ever she seemed at first, but Philip was delighted when a more careful inspection showed him that there was mud on her large shoes and on the bottom of her skirt, and that her dress had a large three-cornered tear in it. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have had it happen for a twenty-pun note,\u0027 the coachman was saying. \u0027George,\u0027 said the nurse to the groom, \u0027you go and get a horse ready. I\u0027ll write the telegram.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027d best take Peppermint,\u0027 said the coachman. \u0027She\u0027s the fastest.\u0027 The groom went out, saying under his breath, \u0027Teach your grandmother,\u0027 which Philip thought rude and unmeaning. Philip was standing unnoticed by the door. He felt that thrill—if it isn\u0027t pleasure it is more like it than anything else—which we all feel when something real has happened. But what had happened. What? \u0027I wish I\u0027d never come back,\u0027 said the nurse. \u0027Then nobody could pretend it was my fault.\u0027[77] \u0027It don\u0027t matter what they pretend,\u0027 the cook stopped crying to say. \u0027The thing is what\u0027s happened. Oh, my goodness. I\u0027d rather have been turned away without a character than have had this happen.\u0027 \u0027And I\u0027d rather anything,\u0027 said the nurse. \u0027Oh, my goodness me. I wish I\u0027d never been born.\u0027 And then and there, before the astonished eyes of Philip, she began to behave as any nice person might—she began to cry. \u0027It wouldn\u0027t have happened,\u0027 said the cook, \u0027if the master hadn\u0027t been away. He\u0027s a Justice of the Peace, he is, and a terror to gipsies. It wouldn\u0027t never have happened if——\u0027 Philip could not bear it any longer. \u0027What wouldn\u0027t have happened if?\u0027 he asked, startling everybody to a quick jump of surprise. The nurse stopped crying and turned to look at him. \u0027Oh, you!\u0027 she said slowly. \u0027I forgot you. You want your breakfast, I suppose, no matter what\u0027s happened?\u0027 \u0027No, I don\u0027t,\u0027 said Philip, with extreme truth. \u0027I want to know what has happened?\u0027 \u0027Miss Lucy\u0027s lost,\u0027 said the cook heavily, \u0027that\u0027s what\u0027s happened. So now you know. You run along and play, like a good little boy,[78] and don\u0027t make extry trouble for us in the trouble we\u0027re in.\u0027 \u0027Lost?\u0027 repeated Philip. \u0027Yes, lost. I expect you\u0027re glad,\u0027 said the nurse, \u0027the way you treated her. You hold your tongue and don\u0027t let me so much as hear you breathe the next twenty-four hours. I\u0027ll go and write that telegram.\u0027 Philip thought it best not to let any one hear him breathe. By this means he heard the telegram when nurse read it aloud to the cook. \u0027Peter Graham, Esq., Hotel Wagram, Brussels. Miss Lucy lost. Please come home immediately. Philkins. That\u0027s all right, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t see why you sign it Philkins. You\u0027re only the nurse—I\u0027m the head of the house when the family\u0027s away, and my name\u0027s Bobson,\u0027 the cook said. There was a sound of torn paper. \u0027There—the paper\u0027s tore. I\u0027d just as soon your name went to it,\u0027 said the nurse. \u0027I don\u0027t want to be the one to tell such news.\u0027 \u0027Oh, my good gracious, what a thing to happen,\u0027 sighed the cook. \u0027Poor little darling!\u0027 Then somebody wrote the telegram again,[79] and the nurse took it out to the stable-yard, where Peppermint was already saddled. \u0027I thought,\u0027 said Philip, bold in the nurse\u0027s absence, \u0027I thought Lucy was with her aunt.\u0027 \u0027She came back yesterday,\u0027 said the cook. \u0027Yes, after you\u0027d gone to bed. And this morning that nurse went into the night nursery and she wasn\u0027t there. Her bed all empty and cold, and her clothes gone. Though how the gipsies could have got in without waking that nurse is a mystery to me and ever will be. She must sleep like a pig.\u0027 \u0027Or the seven sleepers,\u0027 said the coachman. \u0027But what would gipsies want her for?\u0027 Philip asked. \u0027What do they ever want anybody for?\u0027 retorted the cook. \u0027Look at the heirs that\u0027s been stolen. I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s a titled family in England but what\u0027s had its heir stolen, one time and another.\u0027 \u0027I suppose you\u0027ve looked all over the house,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I suppose we ain\u0027t deaf and dumb and blind and silly,\u0027 said the cook. \u0027Here\u0027s that nurse. You be off, Mr. Philip, without you want a flea in your ear.\u0027 And Philip, at the word, was off. He went into the long drawing-room, and shut the door. Then he got the ivory chessmen out of the[80] Buhl cabinet, and set them out on that delightful chess-table whose chequers are of mother-of-pearl and ivory, and tried to play a game, right hand against left. But right hand, who was white, and so moved first, always won. He gave up after awhile, and put the chessmen away in their proper places. Then he got out the big book of photographs of pictures, but they did not seem interesting, so he tried the ivory spellicans. But his hand shook, and you know spellicans is a game you can\u0027t play when your hand shakes. And all the time, behind the chess and the pictures and the spellicans, he was trying not to think about his dream, about how he had climbed that ladder stair, which was really the yard-stick, and gone into the cities that he had built on the tables. Somehow he did not want to remember it. The very idea of remembering made him feel guilty and wretched. He went and looked out of the window, and as he stood there his wish not to remember the dream made his boots restless, and in their shuffling his right boot kicked against something hard that lay in the folds of the blue brocade curtain. He looked down, stooped, and picked up little Mr. Noah. The nurse must have dropt it there when she cleared away the city.[81] And as he looked upon those wooden features it suddenly became impossible not to think of the dream. He let the remembrance of it come, and it came in a flood. And with it the remembrance of what he had done. He had promised to be Lucy\u0027s noble friend, and they had run together to escape from the galloping soldiers. And he had run faster than she. And at the top of the ladder—the ladder of safety—he had not waited for her. \u0027Any old hero would have waited for her, and let her go first,\u0027 he told himself. \u0027Any gentleman would—even any man—let alone a hero. And I just bunked down the ladder and forgot her. I left her there.\u0027 Remorse stirred his boots more ungently than before. \u0027But it was only a dream,\u0027 he said. And then remorse said, as he had felt all along that it would if he only gave it a chance: \u0027But suppose it wasn\u0027t a dream—suppose it was real. Suppose you did leave her there, my noble friend, and that\u0027s why she\u0027s lost.\u0027 Suddenly Philip felt very small, very forlorn, very much alone in the world. But Helen would come back. That telegram would bring her. Yes. And he would have to tell her that perhaps it was his fault.[82] It was in vain that Philip told himself that Helen would never believe about the city. He felt that she would. Why shouldn\u0027t she? She knew about the fairy tales and the Arabian Nights. And she would know that these things did happen. \u0027Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?\u0027 he said, quite loud. And there was no one but himself to give the answer. \u0027If I could only get back into the city,\u0027 he said. \u0027But that hateful nurse has pulled it all down and locked up the nursery. So I can\u0027t even build it again. Oh, what shall I do?\u0027 And with that he began to cry. For now he felt quite sure that the dream wasn\u0027t a dream—that he really had got into the magic city, had promised to stand by Lucy, and had been false to his promise and to her. He rubbed his eyes with his knuckles and also—rather painfully—with Mr. Noah, whom he still held. \u0027What shall I do?\u0027 he sobbed. And a very very teeny tiny voice said: \u0027Put me down.\u0027 \u0027Eh?\u0027 said Philip. \u0027Put me down,\u0027 said the voice again. It was such a teeny tiny voice that he could only just hear it. It was unlikely, of course, that the voice could have been Mr. Noah\u0027s; but then whose else could it be? On the bare chance[83] that it might have been Mr. Noah who spoke—more unlikely things had happened before, as you know—Philip set the little wooden figure down on the chess-table. It stood there, wooden as ever. \u0027Put who down?\u0027 Philip asked. And then, before his eyes, the little wooden figure grew alive, stooped to pick up the yellow disc of wood on which Noah\u0027s Ark people stand, rolled it up like a mat, put it under his arm and began to walk towards the side of the table where Philip stood. He knelt down to bring his ears nearer the little live moving thing. \u0027What did you say?\u0027 he asked, for he fancied that Mr. Noah had again spoken. \u0027I said, what\u0027s the matter?\u0027 said the little voice. \u0027It\u0027s Lucy. She\u0027s lost and it\u0027s my fault. And I can only just hear you. It hurts my ears hearing you,\u0027 complained Philip. \u0027There\u0027s an ear-trumpet in a box on the middle of the cabinet,\u0027 he could just hear the teeny tiny voice say; \u0027it belonged to a great-aunt. Get it out and listen through it.\u0027 Philip got it out. It was an odd curly thing, and at first he could not be sure which end he ought to put to his ear. But he tried both ends, and on the second trial he heard quite a loud, strong, big voice say: \u0027That\u0027s better.\u0027[84] \u0027Then it wasn\u0027t a dream last night,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027Of course it wasn\u0027t,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027Then where is Lucy?\u0027 \u0027In the city, of course. Where you left her.\u0027 \u0027But she can\u0027t be,\u0027 said Philip desperately. \u0027The city\u0027s all pulled down and gone for ever.\u0027 \u0027The city you built in this room is pulled down,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027but the city you went to wasn\u0027t in this room. Now I put it to you—how could it be?\u0027 \u0027But it was,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027or else how could I have got into it.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a little difficult, I own,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027But, you see, you built those cities in two worlds. It\u0027s pulled down in this world. But in the other world it\u0027s going on.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I thought you wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027but it\u0027s true, for all that. Everything people make in that world goes on for ever.\u0027 \u0027But how was it that I got in?\u0027 \u0027Because you belong to both worlds. And you built the cities. So they were yours.\u0027 \u0027But Lucy got in.\u0027 \u0027She built up a corner of your city that the nurse had knocked down.\u0027[85] He heard quite a loud, strong, big voice say, \u0027That\u0027s better.\u0027 He heard quite a loud, strong, big voice say, \u0027That\u0027s better.\u0027 [86] [87] \u0027But you,\u0027 said Philip, more and more bewildered. \u0027You\u0027re here. So you can\u0027t be there.\u0027 \u0027But I am there,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027But you\u0027re here. And you\u0027re alive here. What made you come alive?\u0027 \u0027Your tears,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027Tears are very strong magic. No, don\u0027t begin to cry again. What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 \u0027I want to get back into the city.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s dangerous.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t care.\u0027 \u0027You were glad enough to get away,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027I know: that\u0027s the worst of it,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027Oh, isn\u0027t there any way to get back? If I climbed in at the nursery windows and got the bricks and built it all up and——\u0027 \u0027Quite unnecessary, I assure you. There are a thousand doors to that city.\u0027 \u0027I wish I could find one,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027but, I say, I thought time was all different there. How is it Lucy is lost all this time if time doesn\u0027t count?\u0027 \u0027It does count, now,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027you made it count when you ran away and left Lucy. That set the clocks of the city to the time of this world.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027but it[88] doesn\u0027t matter. Show me the door and I\u0027ll go back and find Lucy.\u0027 \u0027Build something and go through it,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027That\u0027s all. Your tears are dry on me now. Good-bye.\u0027 And he laid down his yellow mat, stepped on to it and was just a little wooden figure again. Philip dropped the ear-trumpet and looked at Mr. Noah. \u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 he said. But this at least he understood. That Helen would come back when she got that telegram, and that before she came he must go into the other world and find the lost Lucy. The gigantic porch lowered frowningly above him. The gigantic porch lowered frowningly above him. \u0027But oh,\u0027 he said, \u0027suppose I don\u0027t find her. I wish I hadn\u0027t built those cities so big! And time will go on. And, perhaps, when Helen comes back she\u0027ll find me lost too—as well as Lucy.\u0027 But he dried his eyes and told himself that this was not how heroes behaved. He must build again. Whichever way you looked at it there was no time to be lost. And besides the nurse might occur at any moment. He looked round for building materials. There was the chess-table. It had long narrow legs set round it, rather like arches. Something might be done with it, with books and candlesticks and Japanese vases.[89] Something was done. Philip built with earnest care, but also with considerable speed. If the nurse should come in before he had made a door and got through it—come in and find him building again—she was quite capable of putting him to bed, where, of course, building is impossible. In a very little time there was a building. But how to get in. He was, alas, the wrong size. He stood helpless, and once more tears pricked and swelled behind his eyelids. One tear fell on his hand. \u0027Tears are a strong magic,\u0027 Mr. Noah had said. And at the thought the tears stopped. Still there was a tear, the one on his hand. He rubbed it on the pillar of the porch. And instantly a queer tight thin feeling swept through him. He felt giddy and shut his eyes. His boots, ever sympathetic, shuffled on the carpet. Or was it the carpet? It was very thick and—— He opened his eyes. His feet were once more on the long grass of the illimitable prairie. And in front of him towered the gigantic porch of a vast building and a domino path leading up to it. \u0027Oh, I am so glad,\u0027 cried Philip among the grass. \u0027I couldn\u0027t have borne it if she\u0027d been lost for ever, and all my fault.\u0027[90] The gigantic porch lowered frowningly above him. What would he find on the other side of it? \u0027I don\u0027t care. I\u0027ve simply got to go,\u0027 he said, and stepped out bravely. \u0027If I can\u0027t be a hero I\u0027ll try to behave like one.\u0027 And with that he stepped out, stumbling a little in the thick grass, and the dark shadow of the porch received him. . . . . . . \u0027Bother the child,\u0027 said the nurse, coming into the drawing-room a little later; \u0027if he hasn\u0027t been at his precious building game again! I shall have to give him a lesson over this—I can see that. And I will too—a lesson he won\u0027t forget in a hurry.\u0027 She went through the house, looking for the too bold builder that she might give him that lesson. Then she went through the garden, still on the same errand. Half an hour later she burst into the servants\u0027 hall and threw herself into a chair. \u0027I don\u0027t care what happens now,\u0027 she said. \u0027The house is bewitched, I think. I shall go the very minute I\u0027ve had my dinner.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s up now?\u0027 the cook came to the door to say.[91] \u0027Up?\u0027 said the nurse. \u0027Oh, nothing\u0027s up. What should there be? Everything\u0027s all right[93] and beautiful, and just as it should be, of course.\u0027 \u0027Miss Lucy\u0027s not found yet, of course, but that\u0027s all, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027All? And enough too, I should have thought,\u0027 said the nurse. \u0027But as it happens it\u0027s not all. The boy\u0027s lost now. Oh, I\u0027m not joking. He\u0027s lost I tell you, the same as the other one—and I\u0027m off out of this by the two thirty-seven train, and I don\u0027t care who knows it.\u0027 \u0027Lor!\u0027 said the cook. . . . . . . Before starting for the two thirty-seven train the nurse went back to the drawing-room to destroy Philip\u0027s new building, to restore to their proper places its books, candlesticks, vases, and chessmen. There we will leave her.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2055/58501.html","bookId":572,"book":{"id":572,"title":"The Magic City","description":"简介： Philip Haldane and his sister lived in a little red-roofed house in a little red-roofed town.
