{"id":12314,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI THE NIGHT ATTACK","content":"The Halma men were not naturally lazy. They were, in the days before the coming of the Great Sloth, a most energetic and industrious people. Now that the Sloth was obliged to work eight hours a day, the weight of its constant and catching sleepiness was taken away, and the people set to work in good earnest. (I did explain, didn\u0027t I, that the Great Sloth\u0027s sleepiness really was catching, like measles?) \\n\\n \\n\\n So now the Halma men were as busy as ants. Some dug the channel for the new stream, some set to work to restore the buildings, while others weeded the overgrown gardens and ploughed the deserted fields. The head Halma man painted in large letters on a column in the market-place these words: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This city is now called by its ancient name of Briskford. Any citizen found calling it[303] Somnolentia will not be allowed to wash in water for a week.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The head-man was full of schemes, the least of which was the lighting of the town by electricity, the power to be supplied by the Great Sloth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He can\u0027t go on pumping eight hours a day,\u0027 said the head-man; \u0027I can easily adjust the machine to all sorts of other uses.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n In the evening a banquet was (of course) given to the Deliverers. The banquet was all pine-apple and water, because there had been no time to make or get anything else. But the speeches were very flattering; and Philip and Lucy were very pleased, more so than Brenda, who did not like pine-apple and made but little effort to conceal her disappointment. Max accepted bits of pine-apple, out of politeness, and hid them among the feet of the guests so that nobody\u0027s feelings should be hurt. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know how we\u0027re to get back to the island,\u0027 said Philip next day, \u0027now we\u0027ve lost the Lightning Loose.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I think we\u0027d better go back by way of Polistopolis,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027and find out who\u0027s been opening the books. If they go on they may let simply anything out. And if the worst comes to the worst, perhaps we could get some[304] one to help us to open the Teal book again and get the Teal out to cross to the island in.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Lu,\u0027 said Philip with feeling, \u0027you\u0027re clever, really clever. No, I\u0027m not kidding. I mean it. And I\u0027m sorry I ever said you were only a girl. But how are we to get to Polistopolis?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a difficult problem. The head-man could offer no suggestions. It was Brenda who suggested asking the advice of the Great Sloth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He is such a fine figure of an animal,\u0027 she said admiringly; \u0027so handsome and distinguished-looking. I am sure he must have a really great mind. I always think good looks go with really great minds, don\u0027t you, dear Lucy?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We might as well,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027if no one can think of anything else.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n No one could. So they decided to take Brenda\u0027s advice. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now that the Sloth worked every day it was not nearly so disagreeable as it had been when it slept so much. \\n\\n \\n\\n The children approached it at the dinner hour and it listened patiently if drowsily to their question. When it had quite done, it reflected—or seemed to reflect; perhaps it had fallen asleep—until the town clock struck one, the time for resuming work. Then it got up and slouched towards its machine.[305] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Cucumbers,\u0027 it said, and began to turn the handle of its wheel. They had to wait till tea-time to ask it what it meant, for in that town the rule about not speaking to the man at the wheel was strictly enforced. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Cucumbers,\u0027 the Sloth repeated, and added a careful explanation. \u0027You sit on the end of any young cucumber which points in the desired direction, and when it has grown to its full length—say sixteen inches—why, then you are sixteen inches on your way.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s not much,\u0027 said Lucy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Every little helps,\u0027 said the Sloth; \u0027more haste less speed. Then you wait till the cucumber seeds, and, when the new plants grow, you select the earliest cucumber that points in the desired direction and take your seat on it. By the end of the cucumber season you will be another sixteen—or with luck seventeen—inches on your way. Thirty-two inches in all, almost a yard. And thus you progress towards your goal, slowly but surely, like in politics.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Thank you very much,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027we will think it over.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n But it did not need much thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If we could get a motor car!\u0027 said Philip. \u0027If you can get machines by wishing for them. . . .\u0027[306] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The very thing,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027let\u0027s find the head-man. We mustn\u0027t wish for a motor or we should have to go on using it. But perhaps there\u0027s some one here who\u0027d like to drive a motor—for his living, you know?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was. A Halma man, with an inborn taste for machinery, had long pined to leave the gathering of pine-apples to others. He was induced to wish for a motor and a B.S.A. sixty horse-power car snorted suddenly in the place where a moment before no car was. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, the luxury! This is indeed like home,\u0027 sighed Brenda, curling up on the air-cushions. \\n\\n \\n\\n And the children certainly felt a gloriously restful sensation. Nothing to be done; no need to think or bother. Just to sit quiet and be borne swiftly on through wonderful cities, all of which Philip vaguely remembered to have seen, small and near, and built by his own hands and Helen\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n [307]And so, at last, they came close to Polistopolis. Philip never could tell how it was that he stopped the car outside the city. It must have been some quite unaccountable instinct, because naturally, you know, when you are not used to being driven in motors, you like to dash up to the house you are going to, and enjoy your friends\u0027 enjoyment of the grand way in which you have travelled. But Philip felt[309]—in that quite certain and quite unexplainable way in which you do feel things sometimes—that it was best to stop the car among the suburban groves of southernwood, and to creep into the town in the disguise afforded by motor coats, motor veils and motor goggles. (For of course all these had come with the motor car when it was wished for, because no motor car is complete without them.) \\n\\n Philip felt that it was best to stop the car among the suburban groves of southernwood. Philip felt that it was best to stop the car among the suburban groves of southernwood. \\n\\n \\n\\n They said good-bye warmly to the Halma motor man, and went quietly towards the town, Max and Brenda keeping to heel in the most praiseworthy way, and the parrot nestling inside Philip\u0027s jacket, for it was chilled by the long rush through the evening air. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now the scattered houses and spacious gardens gave place to the streets of Polistopolis, the capital of the kingdom. And the streets were strangely deserted. The children both felt—in that quite certain and unexplainable way—that it would be unwise of them to go to the place where they had slept the last time they were in that city. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole party was very tired. Max walked with drooping tail, and Brenda was whining softly to herself from sheer weariness and weak-mindedness. The parrot alone was happy—or at least contented. Because it was asleep.[310] \\n\\n \\n\\n At the corner of a little square planted with southernwood-trees in tubs, Philip called a halt. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where shall we go?\u0027 he said; \u0027let us put it to the vote.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And even as he spoke, he saw a dark form creeping along in the shadow of the houses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Who goes there?\u0027 Philip cried with proper spirit, and the answer surprised him, all the more that it was given with a kind of desperate bravado. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I go here; I, Plumbeus, Captain of the old Guard of Polistopolis.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s you!\u0027 cried Philip; \u0027I am glad. You can advise us. Where can we go to sleep? Somehow or other I don\u0027t care to go to the house where we stayed before.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain made no answer. He simply caught at the hands of Lucy and Philip, dragged them through a low arched doorway and, as soon as the long lengths of Brenda and Max had slipped through, closed the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Safe,\u0027 he said in a breathless way, which made Philip feel that safety was the last thing one could count on at that moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now, speak low, who knows what spies may be listening? I am a plain man. I speak as I think. You came out of the unknown. You may be the Deliverer or the Destroyer.[311] But I am a judge of faces—always was from a boy—and I cannot believe that this countenance of apple-cheeked innocence is that of a Destroyer.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip was angry and Lucy was furious. So he said nothing. And she said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Apple-cheeked yourself!\u0027 which was very rude. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I see that you are annoyed,\u0027 said the captain in the dark, where, of course, he could see nothing; \u0027but in calling your friend apple-cheeked I was merely offering the highest compliment in my power. The absence of fruit in this city is, I suppose, the reason why our compliments are like that. I believe poets say \"sweet as a rose\"—we say \"sweet as an orange.\" May I be allowed unreservedly to apologise?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, that\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Philip awkwardly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And to ask whether you are the Deliverer?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I hope so,\u0027 said Philip modestly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course he is,\u0027 said the parrot, putting its head out from the front of Philip\u0027s jacket; \u0027and he has done six deeds out of the seven already.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is time that deeds were done here,\u0027 said the captain. \u0027I\u0027ll make a light and get you some supper. I\u0027m in hiding here; but the walls are thick and all the shutters are shut.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He bolted a door and opened the slide of a dark lantern.[312] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Some of us have taken refuge in the old prison,\u0027 he said; \u0027it\u0027s never used, you know, so her spies don\u0027t infest it as they do every other part of the city.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Whose spies?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The Destroyer\u0027s,\u0027 said the captain, getting bread and milk out of a cupboard; \u0027at least, if you\u0027re the Deliverer she must be that. But she says she\u0027s the Deliverer.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He lighted candles and set them on the table as Lucy asked eagerly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What Destroyer? Is it a horrid woman in a motor veil?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve guessed it,\u0027 said the captain gloomily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s that Pretenderette,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027Does Mr. Noah know? What has she been doing?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Everything you can think of,\u0027 said the captain; \u0027she says she\u0027s Queen, and that she\u0027s done the seven deeds. And Mr. Noah doesn\u0027t know, because she\u0027s set a guard round the city, and no message can get out or in.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The Hippogriff?\u0027 said Lucy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, of course I thought of that,\u0027 said the captain. \u0027And so did she. She\u0027s locked it up and thrown the key into one of the municipal wells.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But why do the guards obey her?\u0027 Philip asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re not our guards, of course,\u0027 the[313] captain answered. \u0027They\u0027re strange soldiers that she got out of a book. She got the people to pull down the Hall of Justice by pretending there was fruit in the gigantic books it\u0027s built with. And when the book was opened these soldiers came marching out. The Sequani and the Aedui they call themselves. And when you\u0027ve finished supper we ought to hold a council. There are a lot of us here. All sorts. Distinctions of rank are forgotten in times of public peril.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Some twenty or thirty people presently gathered in that round room from whose windows Philip and Lucy had looked out when they were first imprisoned. There were indeed all sorts, match-servants, domino-men, soldiers, china-men, Mr. Noah\u0027s three sons and his wife, a pirate and a couple of sailors. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What book,\u0027 Philip asked Lucy in an undertone, \u0027did she get these soldiers out of?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Caesar, I think,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027And I\u0027m afraid it was my fault. I remember telling her about the barbarians and the legions and things after father had told me—when she was my nurse, you know. She\u0027s very clever at thinking of horrid things to do, isn\u0027t she?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The council talked for two hours, and nobody said anything worth mentioning. When every one was quite tired out, every one went to bed.[314] \\n\\n \\n\\n It was Philip who woke in the night in the grasp of a sudden idea. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 asked Max, rousing himself from his warm bed at Philip\u0027s feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve thought of something,\u0027 said Philip in a low excited voice. \u0027I\u0027m going to have a night attack.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Shall I wake the others?\u0027 asked Max, ever ready to oblige. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip thought a moment. Then: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said, \u0027it\u0027s rather dangerous; and besides I want to do it all by myself. Lucy\u0027s done more than her share already. Look out, Max; I\u0027m going to get up and go out.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He got up and he went out. There was a faint greyness of dawn now which showed him the great square of the city on which he and Lucy had looked from the prison window, a very long time ago as it seemed. He found without difficulty the ruins of the Hall of Justice. \\n\\n \\n\\n And among the vast blocks scattered on the ground was one that seemed of grey marble, and bore on its back in gigantic letters of gold the words De Bello Gallico. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip stole back to the prison and roused the captain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I want twenty picked men,\u0027 he said, \u0027without boots—and at once.\u0027[315] \\n\\n \\n\\n He got them, and he led them to the ruins of the Justice Hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now,\u0027 he said, \u0027raise the cover of this book; only the cover, not any of the pages.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The men set their shoulders to the marble slab that was the book\u0027s cover and heaved it up. And as it rose on their shoulders Philip spoke softly, urgently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Caesar,\u0027 he said, \u0027Caesar!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And a voice answered from under the marble slab. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Who calls?\u0027 it said. \u0027Who calls upon Julius Caesar?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And from the space below the slab, as it were from a marble tomb, a thin figure stepped out, clothed in toga and cloak and wearing on its head a crown of bays. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I called,\u0027 said Philip in a voice that trembled a little. \u0027There\u0027s no one but you who can help. The barbarians of Gaul hold this city. I call on great Caesar to drive them away. No one else can help us.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Caesar stood for a moment silent in the grey twilight. Then he spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I will do it,\u0027 he said; \u0027you have often tried to master Caesar and always failed. Now you shall be no more ashamed of that failure, for you shall see Caesar\u0027s power. Bid your slaves raise the leaves of my book to the number of fifteen.\u0027[316] \\n\\n \\n\\n It was done, and Caesar turned towards the enormous open book. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Come forth!\u0027 he said. \u0027Come forth, my legions!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then something in the book moved suddenly, and out of it, as out of an open marble tomb, came long lines of silent armed men, ranged themselves in ranks, and, passing Caesar, saluted. And still more came, and more and more, each with the round shield and the shining helmet and the javelins and the terrible short sword. And on their backs were the packages they used to carry with them into war. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The Barbarians of Gaul are loose in this city,\u0027 said the voice of the great commander; \u0027drive them before you once more as you drove them of old.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Whither, O Caesar?\u0027 asked one of the Roman generals. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Drive them, O Titus Labienus,\u0027 said Caesar, \u0027back into that book wherein I set them more than nineteen hundred years ago, and from which they have dared to escape. Who is their leader?\u0027 he asked of Philip. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The Pretenderette,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027a woman in a motor veil.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Caesar does not war with women,\u0027 said the man in the laurel crown; \u0027let her be taken prisoner and brought before me.\u0027[317] \\n\\n \\n\\n Low-voiced, the generals of Caesar\u0027s army gave their commands, and with incredible quietness the army moved away, spreading itself out in all directions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027She has caged the Hippogriff,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027the winged horse, and we want to send him with a message.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027See that the beast is freed,\u0027 said Caesar, and turned to Plumbeus the captain. \u0027We be soldiers together,\u0027 he said. \u0027Lead me to the main gate. It is there that the fight will be fiercest.\u0027 He laid a hand on the captain\u0027s shoulder, and at the head of the last legion, Caesar and the captain of the soldiers marched to the main gate. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2055/58509.html","bookId":572,"book":{"id":572,"title":"The Magic City","description":"简介： Philip Haldane and his sister lived in a little red-roofed house in a little red-roofed town.
