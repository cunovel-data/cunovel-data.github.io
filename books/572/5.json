{"id":12308,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V ON THE CARPET","content":"The Princess was just Lucy. \u0027It\u0027s too bad,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I do think.\u0027 Then he stopped short and just looked cross. \u0027The Princess and the Champion will now have their teas,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027Right about face, everybody, please, and quick march.\u0027 Philip and Lucy found themselves marching side by side through the night made yellow with continuous fireworks. You must picture them marching across a great plain of grass where many coloured flowers grew. You see a good many of Philip\u0027s buildings had been made on the drawing-room carpet at home, which was green with pink and blue and yellow and white flowers. And this carpet had turned into grass and growing flowers, following that strange law which caused things to change into other things,[132] like themselves, but larger and really belonging to a living world. No one spoke. Philip said nothing because he was in a bad temper. And if you are in a bad temper, nothing is a good thing to say. To circumvent a dragon and then kill it, and to have such an adventure end in tea with Lucy, was too much. And he had other reasons for silence too. And Lucy was silent because she had so much to say that she didn\u0027t know where to begin; and besides, she could feel how cross Philip was. The crowd did not talk because it was not etiquette to talk when taking part in processions. Mr. Noah did not talk because it made him out of breath to walk and talk at the same time, two things neither of which he had been designed to do. So that it was quite a silent party which at last passed through the gateway of the town and up its streets. Philip wondered where the tea would be—not in the prison of course. It was very late for tea, too, quite the middle of the night it seemed. But all the streets were brilliantly lighted, and flags and festoons of flowers hung from all the windows and across all the streets. It was in the front of a big building in one of the great squares of the city that an extra display of coloured lamps disclosed open doors[133] and red-carpeted steps. Mr. Noah hurried up them, and turned to receive Philip and Lucy. \u0027The City of Polistopolis,\u0027 he said, \u0027whose unworthy representative I am, greets in my person the most noble Sir Philip, Knight and Slayer of the Dragon. Also the Princess whom he has rescued. Be pleased to enter.\u0027 They went up the red-cloth covered steps and into a hall, very splendid with silver and ivory. Mr. Noah stooped to a confidential question. \u0027You\u0027d like a wash, perhaps?\u0027 he said, \u0027and your Princess too. And perhaps you\u0027d like to dress up a little? Before the banquet, you know.\u0027 \u0027Banquet?\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I thought it was tea.\u0027 \u0027Business before pleasure,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027first the banquet, then the tea. This way to the dressing-rooms.\u0027 There were two doors side by side. On one door was painted \u0027Knight\u0027s dressing-room,\u0027 on the other \u0027Princess\u0027s dressing-room.\u0027 \u0027Look out,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027the paint is wet. You see there wasn\u0027t much time.\u0027 Philip found his dressing-room very interesting. The walls were entirely of looking-glass, and on tables in the middle of the room lay all sorts of clothes of beautiful colours and[134] odd shapes. Shoes, stockings, hats, crowns, armour, swords, cloaks, breeches, waistcoats, jerkins, trunk hose. An open door showed a marble bath-room. The bath was sunk in the floor as the baths of luxurious Roman Empresses used to be, and as nowadays baths sometimes are, in model dwellings. (Only I am told that some people keep their coals in the baths—which is quite useless because coals are always black however much you wash them.) Philip undressed and went into the warm clear water, greenish between the air and the marble. Why is it so pleasant to have a bath, and so tiresome to wash your hands and face in a basin? He put on his shirt and knickerbockers again, and wandered round the room looking at the clothes laid out there, and wondering which of the wonderful costumes would be really suitable for a knight to wear at a banquet. After considerable hesitation he decided on a little soft shirt of chain-mail that made just a double handful of tiny steel links as he held it. But a difficulty arose. \u0027I don\u0027t know how to put it on,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027and I expect the banquet is waiting. How cross it\u0027ll be.\u0027 He stood undecided, holding the chain mail in his hands, when his eyes fell on a bell handle. Above it was an ivory plate, and on[135] it in black letters the word Valet. Philip rang the bell. Instantly a soft tap at the door heralded the entrance of a person whom Philip at the first glance supposed to be a sandwich man. But the second glance showed that the oblong flat things which he wore were not sandwich-boards, but dominoes. The person between them bowed low. \u0027Oh!\u0027 said Philip, \u0027I rang for the valet.\u0027 \u0027I am not the valet,\u0027 said the domino-enclosed person, who seemed to be in skintight black clothes under his dominoes, \u0027I am the Master of the Robes. I only attend on really distinguished persons. Double-six, at your service, Sir. Have you chosen your dress?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d like to wear the armour,\u0027 said Philip, holding it out. \u0027It seems the right thing for a Knight,\u0027 he added. \u0027Quite so, sir. I confirm your opinion.\u0027 He proceeded to dress Philip in a white tunic and to fasten the coat of mail over this. \u0027I\u0027ve had a great deal of experience,\u0027 he said; \u0027you couldn\u0027t have chosen better. You see, I\u0027m master of the subject of dress. I am able to give my whole mind to it; my own dress being fixed by law and not subject to changes of fashion leaves me free to think for others.[136] And I think deeply. But I see that you can think for yourself.\u0027 You have no idea how jolly Philip looked in the mail coat and mailed hood—just like a Crusader. At the doorway of the dressing-room he met Lucy in a short white dress and a coronal of pearls round her head. \u0027I always wanted to be a fairy,\u0027 she said. \u0027Did you have any one to dress you?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Oh no!\u0027 said Lucy calmly. \u0027I always dress myself.\u0027 \u0027Ladies have the advantage there,\u0027 said Double-six, bowing and walking backwards. \u0027The banquet is spread.\u0027 It turned out to be spread on three tables, one along each side of a great room, and one across the top of the room, on a dais—such a table as that high one at which dons and distinguished strangers sit in the Halls of colleges. Mr. Noah was already in his place in the middle of the high table, and Lucy and Philip now took their places at each side of him. The table was spread with all sorts of nice-looking foods and plates of a pink-and-white pattern very familiar to Philip. They were, in fact, as he soon realised, the painted wooden plates from his sister\u0027s old dolls\u0027 house. There was no[137] food just in front of the children, only a great empty bowl of silver. Philip fingered his knife and fork; the pattern of those also was familiar to him. They were indeed the little leaden ones out of the dolls\u0027 house knife-basket of green and silver filagree. He hungrily waited. Servants in straight yellow dresses and red masks and caps were beginning to handle the dishes. A dish was handed to him. A beautiful jelly it looked like. He took up his spoon and was just about to help himself, when Mr. Noah whispered ardently, \u0027Don\u0027t!\u0027 and as Philip looked at him in astonishment he added, still in a whisper, \u0027Pretend, can\u0027t you? Have you never had a pretending banquet?\u0027 But before he had caught the whisper, Philip had tried to press the edge of the leaden spoon into the shape of jelly. And he felt that the jelly was quite hard. He went through the form of helping himself, but it was just nothing that he put on his plate. And he saw that Mr. Noah and Lucy and all the other guests did the same. Presently another dish was handed to him. There was no changing of plates. \u0027They needn\u0027t,\u0027 Philip thought bitterly. This time it was a fat goose, not carved, and now Philip saw that it was attached to its dish with glue. Then he understood.[138] (You know the beautiful but uneatable feasts which are given you in a white cardboard box with blue binding and fine shavings to pack the dishes and keep them from breaking? I myself, when I was little, had such a banquet in a box. There were twelve dishes: a ham, brown and shapely; a pair of roast chickens, also brown and more anatomical than the ham; a glazed tongue, real tongue-shape, none of your tinned round mysteries; a dish of sausages; two handsome fish, a little blue, perhaps; a joint of beef, ribs I think, very red as to the lean and very white in the fat parts; a pork pie, delicately bronzed like a traveller in Central Africa. For sweets I had shapes, shapes of beauty, a jelly and a cream; a Swiss roll too, and a plum pudding; asparagus there was also and a cauliflower, and a dish of the greenest peas in all this grey world. This was my banquet outfit. I remember that the woodenness of it all depressed us wonderfully; the oneness of dish and food baffled all make-believe. With the point of nurse\u0027s scissors we prised the viands from the platters. But their wooden nature was unconquerable. One could not pretend to eat a whole chicken any better when it was detached from its dish, and the sausages were one solid block. And when you licked the jelly it only tasted of glue and paint. And[139] when we tried to re-roast the chickens at the nursery grate, they caught fire, and then they smelt of gasworks and india-rubber. But I am wandering. When you remember the things that happened when you were a child, you could go on writing about them for ever. I will put all this in brackets, and then you need not read it if you don\u0027t want to.)[141] Mr. Noah whispered ardently, \u0027Don\u0027t!\u0027 Mr. Noah whispered ardently, \u0027Don\u0027t!\u0027 But those painted wooden foods adhering firmly to their dishes were the kind of food of which the banquet now offered to Philip and Lucy was composed. Only they had more dishes than I had. They had as well a turkey, eight raspberry jam tarts, a pine-apple, a melon, a dish of oysters in the shell, a piece of boiled bacon and a leg of mutton. But all were equally wooden and uneatable. Philip and Lucy, growing hungrier and hungrier, pretended with sinking hearts to eat and enjoy the wooden feast. Wine was served in those little goblets which they knew so well, where the double glasses restrained and contained a red fluid which looked like wine. They did not want wine, but they were thirsty as well as hungry. Philip wondered what the waiters were. He had plenty of time to wonder while the long banquet went on. It was not till he saw a group of them standing stiffly together at the[142] end of the hall that he knew they must be the matches with which he had once peopled a city, no other inhabitants being at hand. When all the dishes had been handed, speeches happened. \u0027Friends and fellow-citizens,\u0027 Mr. Noah began, and went on to say how brave and clever Sir Philip was, and how likely it was that he would turn out to be the Deliverer. Philip did not hear all this speech. He was thinking of things to eat. Then every one in the hall stood and shouted, and Philip found that he was expected to take his turn at speech-making. He stood up trembling and wretched. \u0027Friends and fellow-citizens,\u0027 he said, \u0027thank you very much. I want to be the Deliverer, but I don\u0027t know if I can,\u0027 and sat down again amid roars of applause. Then there was music, from a grated gallery. And then—I cannot begin to tell you how glad Lucy and Philip were—Mr. Noah said, once more in a whisper, \u0027Cheer up! the banquet is over. Now we\u0027ll have tea.\u0027 \u0027Tea\u0027 turned out to be bread and milk in a very cosy, blue-silk-lined room opening out of the banqueting-hall. Only Lucy, Philip and Mr. Noah were present. Bread and milk is very good even when you have to eat it with[143] the leaden spoons out of the dolls\u0027-house basket. When it was much later Mr. Noah suddenly said \u0027good-night,\u0027 and in a maze of sleepy repletion (look that up in the dicker, will you?) the children went to bed. Philip\u0027s bed was of gold with yellow satin curtains, and Lucy\u0027s was made of silver, with curtains of silk that were white. But the metals and colours made no difference to their deep and dreamless sleep. And in the morning there was bread and milk again, and the two of them had it in the blue room without Mr. Noah. \u0027Well,\u0027 said Lucy, looking up from the bowl of white floating cubes, \u0027do you think you\u0027re getting to like me any better?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Philip, brief and stern like the skipper in the song. \u0027I wish you would,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027Well, I can\u0027t,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027but I do want to say one thing. I\u0027m sorry I bunked and left you. And I did come back.\u0027 \u0027I know you did,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027I came back to fetch you,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027and now we\u0027d better get along home.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve got to do seven deeds of power before you can get home,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027Oh! I remember, Perrin told me,\u0027 said he. \u0027Well,\u0027 Lucy went on, \u0027that\u0027ll take ages. No one can go out of this place twice unless he\u0027s[144] a King-Deliverer. You\u0027ve gone out once—without me. Before you can go again you\u0027ve got to do seven noble deeds.\u0027 \u0027I killed the dragon,\u0027 said Philip, modestly proud. \u0027That\u0027s only one,\u0027 she said; \u0027there are six more.\u0027 And she ate bread and milk with firmness. \u0027Do you like this adventure?\u0027 he asked abruptly. \u0027It\u0027s more interesting than anything that ever happened to me,\u0027 she said. \u0027If you were nice I should like it awfully. But as it is——\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry you don\u0027t think I\u0027m nice,\u0027 said he. \u0027Well, what do you think?\u0027 she said. Philip reflected. He did not want not to be nice. None of us do. Though you might not think it to see how some of us behave. True politeness, he remembered having been told, consists in showing an interest in other people\u0027s affairs. \u0027Tell me,\u0027 he said, very much wishing to be polite and nice. \u0027Tell me what happened after I—after I—after you didn\u0027t come down the ladder with me.\u0027 \u0027Alone and deserted,\u0027 Lucy answered promptly, \u0027my sworn friend having hooked it[145] and left me, I fell down, and both my hands were full of gravel, and the fierce soldiery surrounded me.\u0027 \u0027I thought you were coming just behind me,\u0027 said Philip, frowning. \u0027Well, I wasn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027And then.\u0027 \u0027Well, then—— You were silly not to stay. They surrounded me—the soldiers, I mean—and the captain said, \"Tell me the truth. Are you a Destroyer or a Deliverer?\" So, of course, I said I wasn\u0027t a destroyer, whatever I was; and then they took me to the palace and said I could be a Princess till the Deliverer King turned up. They said,\u0027 she giggled gaily, \u0027that my hair was the hair of a Deliverer and not of a Destroyer, and I\u0027ve been most awfully happy ever since. Have you?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Philip, remembering the miserable feeling of having been a coward and a sneak that had come upon him when he found that he had saved his own skin and left Lucy alone in an unknown and dangerous world; \u0027not exactly happy, I shouldn\u0027t call it.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s beautiful being a Princess,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027I wonder what your next noble deed will be. I wonder whether I could help you with it?\u0027 She looked wistfully at him. \u0027If I\u0027m going to do noble deeds I\u0027ll do[146] them. I don\u0027t want any help, thank you, especially from girls,\u0027 he answered. \u0027I wish you did,\u0027 said Lucy, and finished her bread and milk. Philip\u0027s bowl also was empty. He stretched arms and legs and neck. \u0027It is rum,\u0027 he said; \u0027before this began I never thought a thing like this could begin, did you?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she said, \u0027everything\u0027s very wonderful. I\u0027ve always been expecting things to be more wonderful than they ever have been. You get sort of hints and nudges, you know. Fairy tales—yes, and dreams, you can\u0027t help feeling they must mean something. And your sister and my daddy; the two of them being such friends when they were little, and then parted and then getting friends again;—that\u0027s like a story in a dream, isn\u0027t it? And your building the city and me helping. And my daddy being such a dear darling and your sister being such a darling dear. It did make me think beautiful things were sort of likely. Didn\u0027t it you?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027I mean yes,\u0027 he said, and he was in that moment nearer to liking Lucy than he had ever been before; \u0027everything\u0027s very wonderful, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Ahem!\u0027 said a respectful cough behind them.[147] They turned to meet the calm gaze of Double-six. \u0027If you\u0027ve quite finished breakfast, Sir Philip,\u0027 he said, \u0027Mr. Noah would be pleased to see you in his office.\u0027 \u0027Me too?\u0027 said Lucy, before Philip could say, \u0027Only me, I suppose?\u0027 \u0027You may come too, if you wish it, your Highness,\u0027 said Double-six, bowing stiffly. They found Mr. Noah very busy in a little room littered with papers; he was sitting at a table writing. \u0027Good-morning, Princess,\u0027 he said, \u0027good-morning, Sir Philip. You see me very busy. I am trying to arrange for your next labour.\u0027 \u0027Do you mean my next deed of valour?\u0027 Philip asked. \u0027We have decided that all your deeds need not be deeds of valour,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, fiddling with a pen. \u0027The strange labours of Hercules, you remember, were some of them dangerous and some merely difficult. I have decided that difficult things shall count. There are several things that really need doing,\u0027 he went on half to himself. \u0027There\u0027s the fruit supply, and the Dwellers by the sea, and—— But that must wait. We try to give you as much variety as possible. Yesterday\u0027s was an out-door adventure. To-day\u0027s shall be an indoor amusement. I say to-[148]day\u0027s but I confess that I think it not unlikely that the task I am now about to set the candidate for the post of King-Deliverer, the task, I say, which I am now about to set you, may, quite possibly, occupy some days, if not weeks of your valuable time.\u0027 \u0027But our people at home,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027It isn\u0027t that I\u0027m afraid, really and truly it isn\u0027t, but they\u0027ll go out of their minds, not knowing what\u0027s become of us. Oh, Mr. Noah! do let us go back.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027However long you stay here time won\u0027t move with them. I thought I\u0027d explained that to you.\u0027 \u0027But you said——\u0027 \u0027I said you\u0027d set our clocks to the time of your world when you deserted your little friend. But when you had come back for her, and rescued her from the dragon, the clocks went their own time again. There\u0027s only just that time missing that happened between your coming here the second time and your killing the dragon.\u0027 \u0027I see,\u0027 said Philip. But he didn\u0027t. I only hope you do. \u0027You can take your time about this new job,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027and you may get any help you like. I shan\u0027t consider you\u0027ve failed till you\u0027ve been at it three months. After[149] that the Pretenderette would be entitled to her chance.\u0027 \u0027If you\u0027re quite sure that the time here doesn\u0027t count at home,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027what is it, please, that we\u0027ve got to do?\u0027 \u0027The greatest intellects of our country have for many ages occupied themselves with the problem which you are now asked to solve,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027Your late gaoler, Mr. Bacon-Shakespeare, has written no less than twenty-seven volumes, all in cypher, on this very subject. But as he has forgotten what cypher he used, and no one else ever knew it, his volumes are of but little use to us.\u0027 \u0027I see,\u0027 said Philip. And again he didn\u0027t. Mr. Noah rose to his full height, and when he stood up the children looked very small beside him. \u0027Now,\u0027 he said, \u0027I will tell you what it is that you must do. I should like to decree that your second labour should be the tidying up of this room—all these papers are prophecies relating to the Deliverer—but it is one of our laws that the judge must not use any public matter for his own personal benefit. So I have decided that the next labour shall be the disentangling of the Mazy Carpet. It is in the Pillared Hall of Public Amusements. I will[150] get my hat and we will go there at once. I can tell you about it as we go.\u0027 And as they went down streets and past houses and palaces all of which Philip could now dimly remember to have built at some time or other, Mr. Noah went on: \u0027It is a very beautiful hall, but we have never been able to use it for public amusement or anything else. The giant who originally built this city placed in this hall a carpet so thick that it rises to your knees, and so intricately woven that none can disentangle it. It is far too thick to pass through any of the doors. It is your task to remove it.\u0027 \u0027Why that\u0027s as easy as easy,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I\u0027ll cut it in bits and bring out a bit at a time.\u0027 \u0027That would be most unfortunate for you,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027I filed only this morning a very ancient prophecy: \u0027He who shall the carpet sever, By fire or flint or steel, Shall be fed on orange pips for ever, And dressed in orange peel. You wouldn\u0027t like that, you know.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Philip grimly, \u0027I certainly shouldn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027The carpet must be unravelled, unwoven, so that not a thread is broken. Here is the hall.\u0027[151] They went up steps—Philip sometimes wished he had not been so fond of building steps—and through a dark vestibule to an arched door. Looking through it they saw a great hall and at its end a raised space, more steps, and two enormous pillars of bronze wrought in relief with figures of flying birds. \u0027Father\u0027s Japanese vases,\u0027 Lucy whispered. The floor of the room was covered by the carpet. It was loosely but difficultly woven of very thick soft rope of a red colour. When I say difficultly, I mean that it wasn\u0027t just straight-forward in the weaving, but the threads went over and under and round about in such a determined and bewildering way that Philip felt—and said—that he would rather untie the string of a hundred of the most difficult parcels than tackle this. \u0027Well,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027I leave you to it. Board and lodging will be provided at the Provisional Palace where you slept last night. All citizens are bound to assist when called upon. Dinner is at one. Good-morning!\u0027 Philip sat down in the dark archway and gazed helplessly at the twisted strands of the carpet. After a moment of hesitation Lucy sat down too, clasped her arms round her knees, and she also gazed at the carpet. They had all the appearance of shipwrecked mariners[152] looking out over a great sea and longing for a sail. \u0027Ha ha—tee hee!\u0027 said a laugh close behind them. They turned. And it was the motor-veiled lady, the hateful Pretenderette, who had crept up close behind them, and was looking down at them through her veil. \u0027What do you want?\u0027 said Philip severely. \u0027I want to laugh,\u0027 said the motor lady. \u0027I want to laugh at you. And I\u0027m going to.\u0027 \u0027Well go and laugh somewhere else then,\u0027 Philip suggested. \u0027Ah! but this is where I want to laugh. You and your carpet! You\u0027ll never do it. You don\u0027t know how. But I do.\u0027 \u0027Come away,\u0027 whispered Lucy, and they went. The Pretenderette followed slowly. Outside, a couple of Dutch dolls in check suits were passing, arm in arm. \u0027Help!\u0027 cried Lucy suddenly, and the Dutch dolls paused and took their hats off. \u0027What is it?\u0027 the taller doll asked, stroking his black painted moustache. \u0027Mr. Noah said all citizens were bound to help us,\u0027 said Lucy a little breathlessly. \u0027But of course,\u0027 said the shorter doll, bowing with stiff courtesy. \u0027Then,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027will you please take that motor person away and put her somewhere[153] where she can\u0027t bother till we\u0027ve done the carpet?\u0027 \u0027Delighted,\u0027 exclaimed the agreeable Dutch strangers, darted up the steps and next moment emerged with the form of the Pretenderette between them, struggling indeed, but struggling vainly. \u0027You need not have the slightest further anxiety,\u0027 the taller Dutchman said; \u0027dismiss the incident from your mind. We will take her to the hall of justice. Her offence is bothering people in pursuit of their duty. The sentence is imprisonment for as long as the botheree chooses. Good-morning.\u0027 \u0027Oh, thank you!\u0027 said both the children together. When they were alone, Philip said—and it was not easy to say it: \u0027That was jolly clever of you, Lucy. I should never have thought of it.\u0027 \u0027Oh, that\u0027s nothing,\u0027 said Lucy, looking down. \u0027I could do more than that.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 he asked. \u0027I could unravel the carpet,\u0027 said Lucy, with deep solemnity. \u0027But it\u0027s me that\u0027s got to do it,\u0027 Philip urged. \u0027Every citizen is bound to help, if called in,\u0027 Lucy reminded him. \u0027And I suppose a princess is a citizen.\u0027[154] \u0027Perhaps I can do it by myself,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027Try,\u0027 said Lucy, and sat down on the steps, her fairy skirts spreading out round her like a white double hollyhock. He tried. He went back and looked at the great coarse cables of the carpet. He could see no end to the cables, no beginning to his task. And Lucy just went on sitting there like a white hollyhock. And time went on, and presently became, rather urgently, dinner-time. So he went back to Lucy and said: \u0027All right, you can show me how to do it, if you like.\u0027 But Lucy replied: \u0027Not much! If you want me to help you with this, you\u0027ll have to promise to let me help in all the other things. And you\u0027ll have to ask me to help—ask me politely too.\u0027 \u0027I shan\u0027t then,\u0027 said Philip. But in the end he had to—politely also. \u0027With pleasure,\u0027 said Lucy, the moment he asked her, and he could see she had been making up what she should answer, while he was making up his mind to ask. \u0027I shall be delighted to help you in this and all the other tasks. Say yes.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Philip, who was very hungry. \u0027\"In this and all the other tasks\" say.\u0027[155] \u0027In this and all the other tasks,\u0027 he said. \u0027Go on. How can we do it?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s crochet,\u0027 Lucy giggled. \u0027It\u0027s a little crochet mat I\u0027d made of red wool; and I put it in the hall that night. You\u0027ve just got to find the end and pull, and it all comes undone. You just want to find the end and pull.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s too heavy for us to pull.\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 said Lucy, who had certainly had time to think everything out, \u0027you get one of those twisty round things they pull boats out of the sea with, and I\u0027ll find the end while you\u0027re getting it.\u0027 She ran up the steps and Philip looked round the buildings on the other three sides of the square, to see if any one of them looked like a capstan shop, for he understood, as of course you also have done, that a capstan was what Lucy meant. On a building almost opposite he read, \u0027Naval Necessaries Supply Company,\u0027 and he ran across to it. \u0027Rather,\u0027 said the secretary of the company, a plump sailor-doll, when Philip had explained his needs. \u0027I\u0027ll send a dozen men over at once. Only too proud to help, Sir Philip. The navy is always keen on helping valour and beauty.\u0027 \u0027I want to be brave,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027but I\u0027d rather not be beautiful.\u0027[156] \u0027Of course not,\u0027 said the secretary; and added surprisingly, \u0027I meant the Lady Lucy.\u0027 \u0027Oh!\u0027 said Philip. So, all down the wide clear floor, Lucy danced. So, all down the wide clear floor, Lucy danced. So twelve bluejackets and a capstan outside the Hall of Public Amusements were soon the centre of a cheering crowd. Lucy had found the end of the rope, and two sailors dragged it out and attached it to the capstan, and then—round and round with a will and a breathless chanty—the carpet was swiftly unravelled. Dozens of eager helpers stood on the parts of the carpet which were not being unravelled, to keep it steady while the pulling went on. The news of Philip\u0027s success spread like wild-fire through the city, and the crowds gathered thicker and thicker. The great doors beyond the pillars with the birds on them were thrown open, and Mr. Noah and the principal citizens stood there to see the end of the unravelling. \u0027Bravo!\u0027 said every one in tremendous enthusiasm. \u0027Bravo! Sir Philip.\u0027 \u0027It wasn\u0027t me,\u0027 said Philip difficultly, when the crowd paused for breath; \u0027it was Lucy thought of it.\u0027 \u0027Bravo! Bravo!\u0027 shouted the crowd louder than ever. \u0027Bravo, for the Lady Lucy! Bravo for Sir Philip, the modest truth-teller!\u0027[157] [159] \u0027Bravo, my dear,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, waving his hat and thumping Lucy on the back. \u0027I\u0027m awfully glad I thought of it,\u0027 she said; \u0027that makes two deeds Sir Philip\u0027s done, doesn\u0027t it? Two out of the seven.\u0027 \u0027Yes, indeed,\u0027 said Mr. Noah enthusiastically. \u0027I must make him a baronet now. His title will grow grander with each deed. There\u0027s an old prophecy that the person who finds out how to unravel the carpet must be the first to dance in the Hall of Public Amusements. \u0027The clever one, the noble one, Who makes the carpet come undone, Shall be the first to dance a measure Within the Hall of public pleasure. I suppose public amusement was too difficult a rhyme even for these highly-skilled poets, our astrologers. You, my child, seem to have been well inspired in your choice of a costume. Dance, then, my Lady Lucy, and let the prophecy be fulfilled.\u0027 So, all down the wide clear floor of the Hall of Public Amusement, Lucy danced. And the people of the city looked on and applauded, Philip with the rest.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2055/58503.html","bookId":572,"book":{"id":572,"title":"The Magic City","description":"简介： Philip Haldane and his sister lived in a little red-roofed house in a little red-roofed town.
