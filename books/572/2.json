{"id":12305,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II DELIVERER OR DESTROYER","content":"Philip stood in the shadow of the dark arch and looked out. He saw before him a great square surrounded by tall irregular buildings. In the middle was a fountain whose waters, silver in the moonlight, rose and fell with gentle plashing sound. A tall tree, close to the archway, cast the shadow of its trunk across the path—a broad black bar. He listened, listened, listened, but there was nothing to listen to, except the deep night silence and the changing soft sound the fountain made. \n \n His eyes, growing accustomed to the dimness, showed him that he was under a heavy domed roof supported on large square pillars—to the right and left stood dark doors, shut fast. \n \n \u0027I will explore these doors by daylight,\u0027 he said. He did not feel exactly frightened. But he did not feel exactly brave either. But[31] he wished and intended to be brave, so he said, \u0027I will explore these doors. At least I think I will,\u0027 he added, for one must not only be brave but truthful. \n \n And then suddenly he felt very sleepy. He leaned against the wall, and presently it seemed that sitting down would be less trouble, and then that lying down would be more truly comfortable. A bell from very very far away sounded the hour, twelve. Philip counted up to nine, but he missed the tenth bell-beat, and the eleventh and the twelfth as well, because he was fast asleep cuddled up warmly in the thick quilted dressing-gown that Helen had made him last winter. He dreamed that everything was as it used to be before That Man came and changed everything and took Helen away. He was in his own little bed in his own little room in their own little house, and Helen had come to call him. He could see the sunlight through his closed eyelids—he was keeping them closed just for the fun of hearing her try to wake him, and presently he would tell her he had been awake all the time, and they would laugh together about it. And then he awoke, and he was not in his soft bed at home but on the hard floor of a big, strange gate-house, and it was not Helen who was shaking him and saying, \u0027Here—I say, wake[32] up, can\u0027t you,\u0027 but a tall man in a red coat; and the light that dazzled his eyes was not from the sun at all, but from a horn lantern which the man was holding close to his face. \n \n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 said Philip sleepily. \n \n \u0027That\u0027s the question,\u0027 said the man in red. \u0027Come along to the guard-room and give an account of yourself, you young shaver.\u0027 \n \n He took Philip\u0027s ear gently but firmly between a very hard finger and thumb. \n \n \u0027Leave go,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027I\u0027m not going to run away.\u0027 And he stood up feeling very brave. \n \n The man shifted his hold from ear to shoulder and led Philip through one of those doors which he had thought of exploring by daylight. It was not daylight yet, and the room, large and bare, with an arch at each end and narrow little windows at the sides, was lighted by horn lanterns and tall tapers in pewter candlesticks. It seemed to Philip that the room was full of soldiers. \n \n Their captain, with a good deal of gold about him and a very smart black moustache, got up from a bench. \n \n \u0027Look what I\u0027ve caught, sir,\u0027 said the man who owned the hand on Philip\u0027s shoulder. \n \n \u0027Humph,\u0027 said the captain, \u0027so it\u0027s really happened at last.\u0027[33] \n \u0027Here—I say, wake up, can\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Here—I say, wake up, can\u0027t you?\u0027 \n \n [34] \n [35] \n \n \u0027What has?\u0027 said Philip. \n \n \u0027Why, you have,\u0027 said the captain. \u0027Don\u0027t be frightened, little man.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I\u0027m not frightened,\u0027 said Philip, and added politely, \u0027I should be so much obliged if you\u0027d tell me what you mean.\u0027 He added something which he had heard people say when they asked the way to the market or the public gardens, \u0027I\u0027m quite a stranger here,\u0027 he said. \n \n A jolly roar of laughter went up from the red-coats. \n \n \u0027It isn\u0027t manners to laugh at strangers,\u0027 said Philip. \n \n \u0027Mind your own manners,\u0027 said the captain sharply; \u0027in this country little boys speak when they\u0027re spoken to. Stranger, eh? Well, we knew that, you know!\u0027 \n \n Philip, though he felt snubbed, yet felt grand too. Here he was in the middle of an adventure with grown-up soldiers. He threw out his chest and tried to look manly. \n \n The captain sat down in a chair at the end of a long table, drew a black book to him—a black book covered with dust—and began to rub a rusty pen-nib on his sword, which was not rusty. \n \n \u0027Come now,\u0027 he said, opening the book, \u0027tell me how you came here. And mind you speak the truth.\u0027[36] \n \n \u0027I always speak the truth,\u0027 said Philip proudly. \n \n All the soldiers rose and saluted him with looks of deep surprise and respect. \n \n \u0027Well, nearly always,\u0027 said Philip, hot to the ears, and the soldiers clattered stiffly down again on to the benches, laughing once more. Philip had imagined there to be more discipline in the army. \n \n \u0027How did you come here?\u0027 said the captain. \n \n \u0027Up the great bridge staircase,\u0027 said Philip. \n \n The captain wrote busily in the book. \n \n \u0027What did you come for?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I didn\u0027t know what else to do. There was nothing but illimitable prairie—and so I came up.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You are a very bold boy,\u0027 said the captain. \n \n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I do want to be.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What was your purpose in coming?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I didn\u0027t do it on purpose—I just happened to come.\u0027 \n \n The captain wrote that down too. And then he and Philip and the soldiers looked at each other in silence. \n \n \u0027Well?\u0027 said the boy. \n \n \u0027Well?\u0027 said the captain. \n \n \u0027I do wish,\u0027 said the boy, \u0027you\u0027d tell me what you meant by my really happening after all. And then I wish you\u0027d tell me the way home.\u0027[37] \n \n \u0027Where do you want to get to?\u0027 asked the captain. \n \n \u0027The address,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027is The Grange, Ravelsham, Sussex.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Don\u0027t know it,\u0027 said the captain briefly, \u0027and anyhow you can\u0027t go back there now. Didn\u0027t you read the notice at the top of the ladder? Trespassers will be prosecuted. You\u0027ve got to be prosecuted before you can go back anywhere.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I\u0027d rather be persecuted than go down that ladder again,\u0027 he said. \u0027I suppose it won\u0027t be very bad—being persecuted, I mean?\u0027 \n \n His idea of persecution was derived from books. He thought it to be something vaguely unpleasant from which one escaped in disguise—adventurous and always successful. \n \n \u0027That\u0027s for the judges to decide,\u0027 said the captain, \u0027it\u0027s a serious thing trespassing in our city. This guard is put here expressly to prevent it.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Do you have many trespassers?\u0027 Philip asked. The captain seemed kind, and Philip had a great-uncle who was a judge, so the word judges made him think of tips and good advice, rather than of justice and punishment. \n \n \u0027Many trespassers indeed!\u0027 the captain almost snorted his answer. \u0027That\u0027s just it. There\u0027s never been one before. You\u0027re the[38] first. For years and years and years there\u0027s been a guard here, because when the town was first built the astrologers foretold that some day there would be a trespasser who would do untold mischief. So it\u0027s our privilege—we\u0027re the Polistopolitan guards—to keep watch over the only way by which a trespasser could come in.\u0027 \n \n \u0027May I sit down?\u0027 said Philip suddenly, and the soldiers made room for him on the bench. \n \n \u0027My father and my grandfather and all my ancestors were in the guards,\u0027 said the captain proudly. \u0027It\u0027s a very great honour.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I wonder,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027why you don\u0027t cut off the end of your ladder—the top end I mean; then nobody could come up.\u0027 \n \n \u0027That would never do,\u0027 said the captain, \u0027because, you see, there\u0027s another prophecy. The great deliverer is to come that way.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Couldn\u0027t I,\u0027 suggested Philip shyly, \u0027couldn\u0027t I be the deliverer instead of the trespasser? I\u0027d much rather, you know.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I daresay you would,\u0027 said the captain; \u0027but people can\u0027t be deliverers just because they\u0027d much rather, you know.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And isn\u0027t any one to come up the ladder bridge except just those two?\u0027 \n \n \u0027We don\u0027t know; that\u0027s just it. You know what prophecies are.\u0027[39] \n \n \u0027I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t—exactly.\u0027 \n \n \u0027So vague and mixed up, I mean. The one I\u0027m telling you about goes something like this. \n Who comes up the ladder stair? \n Beware, beware, \n Steely eyes and copper hair \n Strife and grief and pain to bear \n All come up the ladder stair. \n You see we can\u0027t tell whether that means one person or a lot of people with steely eyes and copper hair.\u0027 \n \n \u0027My hair\u0027s just plain boy-colour,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027my sister says so, and my eyes are blue, I believe.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I can\u0027t see in this light;\u0027 the captain leaned his elbows on the table and looked earnestly in the boy\u0027s eyes. \u0027No, I can\u0027t see. The other prophecy goes: \n From down and down and very far down \n The king shall come to take his own; \n He shall deliver the Magic town, \n And all that he made shall be his own. \n Beware, take care. Beware, prepare, \n The king shall come by the ladder stair. \n \n \u0027How jolly,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027I love poetry. Do you know any more?\u0027 \n \n \u0027There are heaps of prophecies of course,\u0027 said the captain; \u0027the astrologers must do something to earn their pay. There\u0027s rather a nice one:[40] \n Every night when the bright stars blink \n The guards shall turn out, and have a drink \n As the clock strikes two. \n And every night when no stars are seen \n The guards shall drink in their own canteen \n When the clock strikes two. \n To-night there aren\u0027t any stars, so we have the drinks served here. It\u0027s less trouble than going across the square to the canteen, and the principle\u0027s the same. Principle is the great thing with a prophecy, my boy.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Philip. And then the far-away bell beat again. One, two. And outside was a light patter of feet. \n \n A soldier rose—saluted his officer and threw open the door. There was a moment\u0027s pause; Philip expected some one to come in with a tray and glasses, as they did at his great-uncle\u0027s when gentlemen were suddenly thirsty at times that were not meal-times. \n \n But instead, after a moment\u0027s pause, a dozen greyhounds stepped daintily in on their padded cat-like feet; and round the neck of each dog was slung a roundish thing that looked like one of the little barrels which St. Bernard dogs wear round their necks in the pictures. And when these were loosened and laid on the table Philip was charmed to see that the roundish things were not barrels but cocoa-nuts. \n \n The soldiers reached down some pewter[41] pots from a high shelf—pierced the cocoa-nuts with their bayonets and poured out the cocoa-nut milk. They all had drinks, so the prophecy came true, and what is more they gave Philip a drink as well. It was delicious, and there was as much of it as he wanted. I have never had as much cocoa-nut milk as I wanted. Have you? \n \n Then the hollow cocoa-nuts were tied on to the dogs\u0027 necks again and out they went, slim and beautiful, two by two, wagging their slender tails, in the most amiable and orderly way. \n \n \u0027They take the cocoa-nuts to the town kitchen,\u0027 said the captain, \u0027to be made into cocoa-nut ice for the army breakfast; waste not want not, you know. We don\u0027t waste anything here, my boy.\u0027 Philip had quite got over his snubbing. He now felt that the captain was talking with him as man to man. Helen had gone away and left him; well, he was learning to do without Helen. And he had got away from the Grange, and Lucy, and that nurse. He was a man among men. And then, just as he was feeling most manly and important, and quite equal to facing any number of judges, there came a little tap at the door of the guard-room, and a very little voice said: \n \n \u0027Oh, do please let me come in.\u0027[42] \n \n Then the door opened slowly. \n \n \u0027Well, come in, whoever you are,\u0027 said the captain. And the person who came in was—Lucy. Lucy, whom Philip thought he had got rid of—Lucy, who stood for the new hateful life to which Helen had left him. Lucy, in her serge skirt and jersey, with her little sleek fair pig-tails, and that anxious \u0027I-wish-we-could-be-friends\u0027 smile of hers. Philip was furious. It was too bad. \n \n \u0027And who is this?\u0027 the captain was saying kindly. \n \n \u0027It\u0027s me—it\u0027s Lucy,\u0027 she said. \u0027I came up with him.\u0027 \n \n She pointed to Philip. \u0027No manners,\u0027 thought Philip in bitterness. \n \n \u0027No, you didn\u0027t,\u0027 he said shortly. \n \n \u0027I did—I was close behind you when you were climbing the ladder bridge. And I\u0027ve been waiting alone ever since, when you were asleep and all. I knew he\u0027d be cross when he knew I\u0027d come,\u0027 she explained to the soldiers. \n \n \u0027I\u0027m not cross,\u0027 said Philip very crossly indeed, but the captain signed to him to be silent. Then Lucy was questioned and her answers written in the book, and when that was done the captain said: \n \n \u0027So this little girl is a friend of yours?\u0027[43] \n \n \u0027No, she isn\u0027t,\u0027 said Philip violently; \u0027she\u0027s not my friend, and she never will be. I\u0027ve seen her, that\u0027s all, and I don\u0027t want to see her again.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You are unkind,\u0027 said Lucy. \n \n And then there was a grave silence, most unpleasant to Philip. The soldiers, he perceived, now looked coldly at him. It was all Lucy\u0027s fault. What did she want to come shoving in for, spoiling everything? Any one but a girl would have known that a guard-room wasn\u0027t the right place for a girl. He frowned and said nothing. Lucy had smuggled up against the captain\u0027s knee, and he was stroking her hair. \n \n \u0027Poor little woman,\u0027 he said. \u0027You must go to sleep now, so as to be rested before you go to the Hall of Justice in the morning.\u0027 \n \n They made Lucy a bed of soldiers\u0027 cloaks laid on a bench; and bearskins are the best of pillows. Philip had a soldier\u0027s cloak and a bench, and a bearskin too—but what was the good? Everything was spoiled. If Lucy had not come the guard-room as a sleeping-place would have been almost as good as the tented field. But she had come, and the guard-room was no better now than any old night-nursery. And how had she known? How had she come? How had she made her way to that illimitable prairie where he had found the mysterious[44] beginning of the ladder bridge? He went to sleep a bunched-up lump of prickly discontent and suppressed fury. \n \n When he woke it was bright daylight, and a soldier was saying, \u0027Wake up, Trespassers. Breakfast——\u0027 \n \n \u0027How jolly,\u0027 thought Philip, \u0027to be having military breakfast.\u0027 Then he remembered Lucy, and hated her being there, and felt once more that she had spoiled everything. \n \n I should not, myself, care for a breakfast of cocoa-nut ice, peppermint creams, apples, bread and butter and sweet milk. But the soldiers seemed to enjoy it. And it would have exactly suited Philip if he had not seen that Lucy was enjoying it too. \n \n \u0027I do hate greedy girls,\u0027 he told himself, for he was now in that state of black rage when you hate everything the person you are angry with does or says or is. \n \n And now it was time to start for the Hall of Justice. The guard formed outside, and Philip noticed that each soldier stood on a sort of green mat. When the order to march was given, each soldier quickly and expertly rolled up his green mat and put it under his arm. And whenever they stopped, because of the crowd, each soldier unrolled his green mat, and stood on it till it was time to go on[45] again. And they had to stop several times, for the crowd was very thick in the great squares and in the narrow streets of the city. It was a wonderful crowd. There were men and women and children in every sort of dress. Italian, Spanish, Russian; French peasants in blue blouses and wooden shoes, workmen in the dress English working people wore a hundred years ago. Norwegians, Swedes, Swiss, Turks, Greeks, Indians, Arabians, Chinese, Japanese, besides Red Indians in dresses of skins, and Scots in kilts and sporrans. Philip did not know what nation most of the dresses belonged to—to him it was a brilliant patchwork of gold and gay colours. It reminded him of the fancy-dress party he had once been to with Helen, when he wore a Pierrot\u0027s dress and felt very silly in it. He noticed that not a single boy in all that crowd was dressed as he was—in what he thought was the only correct dress for boys. Lucy walked beside him. Once, just after they started, she said, \u0027Aren\u0027t you frightened, Philip?\u0027 and he would not answer, though he longed to say, \u0027Of course not. It\u0027s only girls who are afraid.\u0027 But he thought it would be more disagreeable to say nothing, so he said it. \n \n When they got to the Hall of Justice, she caught hold of his hand, and said:[46] \n \n \u0027Oh!\u0027 very loud and sudden, \u0027doesn\u0027t it remind you of anything?\u0027 she asked. \n \n Philip pulled his hand away and said \u0027No\u0027 before he remembered that he had decided not to speak to her. And the \u0027No\u0027 was quite untrue, for the building did remind him of something, though he couldn\u0027t have told you what. \n \n The prisoners and their guard passed through a great arch between magnificent silver pillars, and along a vast corridor, lined with soldiers who all saluted. \n \n \u0027Do all sorts of soldiers salute you?\u0027 he asked the captain, \u0027or only just your own ones?\u0027 \n \n \u0027It\u0027s you they\u0027re saluting,\u0027 the captain said; \u0027our laws tell us to salute all prisoners out of respect for their misfortunes.\u0027 \n \n The judge sat on a high bronze throne with colossal bronze dragons on each side of it, and wide shallow steps of ivory, black and white. \n \n Two attendants spread a round mat on the top of the steps in front of the judge—a yellow mat it was, and very thick, and he stood up and saluted the prisoners. (\u0027Because of your misfortunes,\u0027 the captain whispered.) \n \n The judge wore a bright yellow robe with a green girdle, and he had no wig, but a[47] very odd-shaped hat, which he kept on all the time. \n \n The trial did not last long, and the captain said very little, and the judge still less, while the prisoners were not allowed to speak at all. The judge looked up something in a book, and consulted in a low voice with the crown lawyer and a sour-faced person in black. Then he put on his spectacles and said: \n \n \u0027Prisoners at the bar, you are found guilty of trespass. The punishment is Death—if the judge does not like the prisoners. If he does not dislike them it is imprisonment for life, or until the judge has had time to think it over. Remove the prisoners.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, don\u0027t!\u0027 cried Philip, almost weeping. \n \n \u0027I thought you weren\u0027t afraid,\u0027 whispered Lucy. \n \n \u0027Silence in court,\u0027 said the judge. \n \n Then Philip and Lucy were removed. \n \n They were marched by streets quite different from those they had come by, and at last in the corner of a square they came to a large house that was quite black. \n \n \u0027Here we are,\u0027 said the captain kindly. \u0027Good-bye. Better luck next time.\u0027 \n \n The gaoler, a gentleman in black velvet, with a ruff and a pointed beard, came out and welcomed them cordially.[48] \n \n \u0027How do you do, my dears?\u0027 he said. \u0027I hope you\u0027ll be comfortable here. First-class misdemeanants, I suppose?\u0027 he asked. \n \n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said the captain. \n \n \u0027Top floor, if you please,\u0027 said the gaoler politely, and stood back to let the children pass. \u0027Turn to the left and up the stairs.\u0027 \n \u0027Top floor, if you please,\u0027 said the gaoler politely. \u0027Top floor, if you please,\u0027 said the gaoler politely. \n \n The stairs were dark and went on and on, and round and round, and up and up. At the very top was a big room, simply furnished with a table, chairs, and a rocking-horse. Who wants more furniture than that? \n \n \u0027You\u0027ve got the best view in the whole city,\u0027 said the gaoler, \u0027and you\u0027ll be company for me. What? They gave me the post of gaoler because it\u0027s nice, light, gentlemanly work, and leaves me time for my writing. I\u0027m a literary man, you know. But I\u0027ve sometimes found it a trifle lonely. You\u0027re the first prisoners I\u0027ve ever had, you see. If you\u0027ll excuse me I\u0027ll go and order some dinner for you. You\u0027ll be contented with the feast of reason and the flow of soul, I feel certain.\u0027 \n \n The moment the door had closed on the gaoler\u0027s black back Philip turned on Lucy. \n \n \u0027I hope you\u0027re satisfied,\u0027 he said bitterly. \u0027This is all your doing. They\u0027d have let me off if you hadn\u0027t been here. What on earth did you want to come here for?[49] Why did you come running after me like that? You know I don\u0027t like you?\u0027[51] \n \n \u0027You\u0027re the hatefullest, disagreeablest, horridest boy in all the world,\u0027 said Lucy firmly—\u0027there!\u0027 \n \n Philip had not expected this. He met it as well as he could. \n \n \u0027I\u0027m not a little sneak of a white mouse squeezing in where I\u0027m not wanted, anyhow,\u0027 he said. \n \n And then they stood looking at each other, breathing quickly, both of them. \n \n \u0027I\u0027d rather be a white mouse than a cruel bully,\u0027 said Lucy at last. \n \n \u0027I\u0027m not a bully,\u0027 said Philip. \n \n Then there was another silence. Lucy sniffed. Philip looked round the bare room, and suddenly it came to him that he and Lucy were companions in misfortune, no matter whose fault it was that they were imprisoned. So he said: \n \n \u0027Look here, I don\u0027t like you and I shan\u0027t pretend I do. But I\u0027ll call it Pax for the present if you like. We\u0027ve got to escape from this place somehow, and I\u0027ll help you if you like, and you may help me if you can.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Lucy, in a tone which might have meant anything. \n \n \u0027So we\u0027ll call it Pax and see if we can[52] escape by the window. There might be ivy—or a faithful page with a rope ladder. Have you a page at the Grange?\u0027 \n \n \u0027There\u0027s two stable-boys,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027but I don\u0027t think they\u0027re faithful, and I say, I think all this is much more magic than you think.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Of course I know it\u0027s magic,\u0027 said he impatiently; \u0027but it\u0027s quite real too.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s real enough,\u0027 said she. \n \n They leaned out of the window. Alas, there was no ivy. Their window was very high up, and the wall outside, when they touched it with their hand, felt smooth as glass. \n \n \u0027That\u0027s no go,\u0027 said he, and the two leaned still farther out of the window looking down on the town. There were strong towers and fine minarets and palaces, the palm trees and fountains and gardens. A white building across the square looked strangely familiar. Could it be like St. Paul\u0027s which Philip had been taken to see when he was very little, and which he had never been able to remember? No, he could not remember it even now. The two prisoners looked out in a long silence. Far below lay the city, its trees softly waving in the breeze, flowers shining in a bright many-coloured patchwork, the canals that intersected the big squares gleamed in the sunlight, and[53] crossing and recrossing the squares and streets were the people of the town, coming and going about their business. \n \n \u0027Look here!\u0027 said Lucy suddenly, \u0027do you mean to say you don\u0027t know?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Know what?\u0027 he asked impatiently. \n \n \u0027Where we are. What it is. Don\u0027t you?\u0027 \n \n \u0027No. No more do you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Haven\u0027t you seen it all before?\u0027 \n \n \u0027No, of course I haven\u0027t. No more have you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027All right. I have seen it before though,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027and so have you. But I shan\u0027t tell you what it is unless you\u0027ll be nice to me.\u0027 Her tone was a little sad, but quite firm. \n \n \u0027I am nice to you. I told you it was Pax,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027Tell me what you think it is.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t mean that sort of grandish standoffish Pax, but real Pax. Oh, don\u0027t be so horrid, Philip. I\u0027m dying to tell you—but I won\u0027t if you go on being like you are.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I\u0027m all right,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027out with it.\u0027 \n \n \u0027No. You\u0027ve got to say it\u0027s Pax, and I will stand by you till we get out of this, and I\u0027ll always act like a noble friend to you, and I\u0027ll try my best to like you. Of course if you can\u0027t like me you can\u0027t, but you ought to try. Say it after me, won\u0027t you?\u0027 \n \n Her tone was so kind and persuading that[54] he found himself saying after her, \u0027I, Philip, agree to try and like you, Lucy, and to stand by you till we\u0027re out of this, and always to act the part of a noble friend to you. And it\u0027s real Pax. Shake hands.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Now then,\u0027 said he when they had shaken hands, and Lucy uttered these words: \n \n \u0027Don\u0027t you see? It\u0027s your own city that we\u0027re in, your own city that you built on the tables in the drawing-room? It\u0027s all got big by magic, so that we could get in. Look,\u0027 she pointed out of the window, \u0027see that great golden dome, that\u0027s one of the brass finger-bowls, and that white building\u0027s my old model of St. Paul\u0027s. And there\u0027s Buckingham Palace over there, with the carved squirrel on the top, and the chessmen, and the blue and white china pepper-pots; and the building we\u0027re in is the black Japanese cabinet.\u0027 \n \n Philip looked and he saw that what she said was true. It was his city. \n \n \u0027But I didn\u0027t build insides to my buildings,\u0027 said he; \u0027and when did you see what I built anyway?\u0027 \n \n \u0027The insides are part of the magic, I suppose,\u0027 Lucy said; \u0027and I saw the cities you built when Auntie brought me home last night, after you\u0027d been sent to bed. And I did love them. And oh, Philip, I\u0027m so glad it\u0027s Pax[55] because I do think you\u0027re so frightfully clever, and Auntie thought so too, building those beautiful things. And I knew nurse was going to pull it all down. I begged her not to, but she was addymant, and so I got up and dressed and came down to have another look by moonlight. And one or two of the bricks and chessmen had fallen down. I expect nurse knocked them down. So I built them up again as well as I could—and I was loving it all like anything; and then the door opened and I hid under the table, and you came in.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Then you were there—did you notice how the magic began?\u0027 \n \n \u0027No, but it all changed to grass; and then I saw you a long way off, going up a ladder. And so I went after you. But I didn\u0027t let you see me. I knew you\u0027d be so cross. And then I looked in at the guard-room door, and I did so want some of the cocoa-nut milk.\u0027 \n \n \u0027When did you find out it was my city?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I thought the soldiers looked like my lead ones somehow. But I wasn\u0027t sure till I saw the judge. Why he\u0027s just old Noah, out of the Ark.\u0027 \n \n \u0027So he is,\u0027 cried Philip; \u0027how wonderful! How perfectly wonderful! I wish we weren\u0027t prisoners. Wouldn\u0027t it be jolly to go all over it—into all the buildings, to see what the insides[56] of them have turned into? And all the other people. I didn\u0027t put them in.\u0027 \n \n \u0027That\u0027s more magic, I expect. But—Oh, we shall find it all out in time.\u0027 \n \n She clapped her hands. And on the instant the door opened and the gaoler appeared. \n \n \u0027A visitor for you,\u0027 he said, and stood aside to let some one else come in, some one tall and thin, with a black hooded cloak and a black half-mask, such as people wear at carnival time. \n \n When the gaoler had shut the door and gone away the tall figure took off its mask and let fall its cloak, showing to the surprised but recognising eyes of the children the well-known shape of Mr. Noah—the judge. \n \n \u0027How do you do?\u0027 he said. \u0027This is a little unofficial visit. I hope I haven\u0027t come at an inconvenient time.\u0027 \n \n \u0027We\u0027re very glad,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027because you can tell us——\u0027 \n \n \u0027I won\u0027t answer questions,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, sitting down stiffly on his yellow mat, \u0027but I will tell you something. We don\u0027t know who you are. But I myself think that you may be the Deliverer.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Both of us,\u0027 said Philip jealously. \n \n \u0027One or both. You see the prophecy says that the Destroyer\u0027s hair is red. And your[57] hair is not red. But before I could get the populace to feel sure of, that my own hair would be grey with thought and argument. Some people are so wooden-headed. And I am not used to thinking. I don\u0027t often have to do it. It distresses me.\u0027 \n \n The children said they were sorry. Philip added: \n \n \u0027Do tell us a little about your city. It isn\u0027t a question. We want to know if it\u0027s magic. That isn\u0027t a question either.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I was about to tell you,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027and I will not answer questions. Of course it is magic. Everything in the world is magic, until you understand it. \n \n \u0027And as to the city. I will just tell you a little of our history. Many thousand years ago all the cities of our country were built by a great and powerful giant, who brought the materials from far and wide. The place was peopled partly by persons of his choice, and partly by a sort of self-acting magic rather difficult to explain. As soon as the cities were built and the inhabitants placed here the life of the city began, and it was, to those who lived it, as though it had always been. The artisans toiled, the musicians played, and the poets sang. The astrologers, finding themselves in a tall tower evidently designed for[58] such a purpose, began to observe the stars and to prophesy.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I know that part,\u0027 said Philip. \n \n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said the judge. \u0027Then you know quite enough. Now I want to ask a little favour of you both. Would you mind escaping?\u0027 \n \n \u0027If we only could,\u0027 Lucy sighed. \n \n \u0027The strain on my nerves is too much,\u0027 said Mr. Noah feelingly. \u0027Escape, my dear children, to please me, a very old man in indifferent health and poor spirits.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But how——\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, you just walk out. You, my boy, can disguise yourself in your dressing-gown which I see has been placed on yonder chair, and I will leave my cloak for you, little girl.\u0027 \n \n They both said \u0027Thank you,\u0027 and Lucy added: \u0027But how?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Through the door,\u0027 said the judge. \u0027There is a rule about putting prisoners on their honour not to escape, but there have not been any prisoners for so long that I don\u0027t suppose they put you on honour. No? You can just walk out of the door. There are many charitable persons in the city who will help to conceal you. The front-door key turns easily, and I myself will oil it as I go out. Good-bye—thank you so much for falling in with my little idea.[59] Accept an old man\u0027s blessing. Only don\u0027t tell the gaoler. He would never forgive me.\u0027 \n \n He got off his mat, rolled it up and went. \n \n \u0027Well!\u0027 said Lucy. \n \n \u0027Well!\u0027 said Philip. \n \n \u0027I suppose we go?\u0027 he said. But Lucy said, \u0027What about the gaoler? Won\u0027t he catch it if we bolt?\u0027 \n \n Philip felt this might be true. It was annoying, and as bad as being put on one\u0027s honour. \n \n \u0027Bother!\u0027 was what he said. \n \n And then the gaoler came in. He looked pale and worried. \n \n \u0027I am so awfully sorry,\u0027 he began. \u0027I thought I should enjoy having you here, but my nerves are all anyhow. The very sound of your voices. I can\u0027t write a line. My brain reels. I wonder whether you\u0027d be good enough to do a little thing for me? Would you mind escaping?\u0027 \n \n \u0027But won\u0027t you get into trouble?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Nothing could be worse than this,\u0027 said the gaoler, with feeling. \u0027I had no idea that children\u0027s voices were so penetrating. Go, go. I implore you to escape. Only don\u0027t tell the judge. I am sure he would never forgive me.\u0027 \n \n After that, what prisoner would not immediately have escaped?[60] \n \n The two children only waited till the sound of the gaoler\u0027s keys had died away on the stairs, to open their door, run down the many steps and slip out of the prison gate. They walked a little way in silence. There were plenty of people about, but no one seemed to notice them. \n \n \u0027Which way shall we go?\u0027 Lucy asked. \u0027I wish we\u0027d asked him where the Charitables live.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I think,\u0027 Philip began; but Lucy was not destined to know what he thought. \n \n There was a sudden shout, a clattering of horses\u0027 hoofs, and all the faces in the square turned their way. \n \n \u0027They\u0027ve seen us,\u0027 cried Philip. \u0027Run, run, run!\u0027 \n \n He himself ran, and he ran toward the gate-house that stood at the top of the ladder stairs by which they had come up, and behind him came the shouting and clatter of hot pursuit. The captain stood in the gateway alone, and just as Philip reached the gate the captain turned into the guard-room and pretended not to see anything. Philip had never run so far or so fast. His breath came in deep sobs; but he reached the ladder and began quickly to go down. It was easier than going up.[61] \n And behind him the clatter of hot pursuit. And behind him the clatter of hot pursuit. \n \n He was nearly at the bottom when the[63] whole ladder bridge leapt wildly into the air, and he fell from it and rolled in the thick grass of that illimitable prairie. \n \n All about him the air was filled with great sounds, like the noise of the earthquakes that destroy beautiful big palaces, and factories which are big but not beautiful. It was deafening, it was endless, it was unbearable. \n \n Yet he had to bear that, and more. And now he felt a curious swelling sensation in his hands, then in his head—then all over. It was extremely painful. He rolled over in his agony, and saw the foot of an enormous giant quite close to him. The foot had a large, flat, ugly shoe, and seemed to come out of grey, low-hanging, swaying curtains. There was a gigantic column too, black against the grey. The ladder bridge, cast down, lay on the ground not far from him. \n \n Pain and fear overcame Philip, and he ceased to hear or feel or know anything. \n \n When he recovered consciousness he found himself under the table in the drawing-room. The swelling feeling was over, and he did not seem to be more than his proper size. \n \n He could see the flat feet of the nurse and the lower part of her grey skirt, and a rattling and rumbling on the table above told him that she was doing as she had said she would, and[64] destroying his city. He saw also a black column which was the leg of the table. Every now and then the nurse walked away to put back into its proper place something he had used in the building. And once she stood on a chair, and he heard the tinkling of the lustre-drops as she hooked them into their places on the chandelier. \n \n \u0027If I lie very still,\u0027 said he, \u0027perhaps she won\u0027t see me. But I do wonder how I got here. And what a dream to tell Helen about!\u0027 \n \n He lay very still. The nurse did not see him. And when she had gone to her breakfast Philip crawled out. \n \n Yes, the city was gone. Not a trace of it. The very tables were back in their proper places. \n \n Philip went back to his proper place, which, of course, was bed. \n \n \u0027What a splendid dream,\u0027 he said, as he cuddled down between the sheets, \u0027and now it\u0027s all over!\u0027 \n \n Of course he was quite wrong. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2055/58500.html","bookId":572,"book":{"id":572,"title":"The Magic City","description":"简介： Philip Haldane and his sister lived in a little red-roofed house in a little red-roofed town.
