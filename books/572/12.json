{"id":12315,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII THE END","content":"Philip tore back to the prison, to be met at the door by Lucy. \u0027I hate you,\u0027 she said briefly, and Philip understood. \u0027I couldn\u0027t help it,\u0027 he said; \u0027I did want to do something by myself.\u0027 And Lucy understood. \u0027And besides,\u0027 he said, \u0027I was coming back for you. Don\u0027t be snarky about it, Lu. I\u0027ve called up Caesar himself. And you shall see him before he goes back into the book. Come on; if we\u0027re sharp we can hide in the ruins of the Justice Hall and see everything. I noticed there was a bit of the gallery left standing. Come on. I want you to think what message to send by the Hippogriff to Mr. Noah.\u0027 \u0027Oh, you needn\u0027t trouble about that,\u0027 said Lucy in an off-hand manner. \u0027I sent the parrot off ages ago.\u0027[319] \u0027And you never told me! Then I think that\u0027s quits; don\u0027t you?\u0027 Lucy had a short struggle with herself (you know those unpleasant and difficult struggles, I am sure!) and said: \u0027Right-o!\u0027 And together they ran back to the Justice Hall. The light was growing every moment, and there was now a sound of movement in the city. Women came down to the public fountains to draw water, and boys swept the paths and doorsteps. That sort of work goes on even when barbarians are surrounding a town. And the ordinary sounds of a town\u0027s awakening came to Lucy and Philip as they waited; crowing cocks and barking dogs and cats mewing faintly for the morning milk. But it was not for those sounds that Lucy and Philip were waiting. So through those homely and familiar sounds they listened, listened, listened; and very gradually, so that they could neither of them have said at any moment \u0027Now it has begun,\u0027 yet quite beyond mistake the sound for which they listened was presently loud in their ears. And it was the sound of steel on steel; the sound of men shouting in the breathless moment between sword-stroke and sword-stroke; the cry of victory and the wail of defeat.[320] And, presently, the sound of feet that ran. And now a man shot out from a side street and ran across the square towards the Palace of Justice where Lucy and Philip were hidden in the gallery. And now another and another all running hard and making for the ruined hall as hunted creatures make for cover. Rough, big, blond, their long hair flying behind them, and their tunics of beast-skins flapping as they ran, the barbarians fled before the legions of Caesar. The great marble-covered book that looked like a marble tomb was still open, its cover and fifteen leaves propped up against the tall broken columns of the gateway of the Justice Hall. Into that open book leapt the first barbarian, leapt and vanished, and the next after him and the next, and then, by twos and threes and sixes and sevens, they leapt in and disappeared, amid gasping and shouting and the nearing sound of the bucina and of the trumpets of Rome. Then from all quarters of the city the Roman soldiers came trooping, and as the last of the barbarians plunged headlong into the open book, the Romans formed into ordered lines and waited, while a man might count ten. Then, advancing between their ranks, came the spare form and thin face of the man with the laurel crown.[321] They leapt in and disappeared. They leapt in and disappeared. [323] Twelve thousand swords flashed in air and wavered a little like reeds in the breeze, then steadied themselves, and the shout went up from twelve thousand throats: \u0027Ave Caesar!\u0027 And without haste and without delay the Romans filed through the ruins to the marble-covered book, and two by two entered it and disappeared. Each as he passed the mighty conqueror saluted him with proud mute reverence. When the last soldier was hidden in the book, Caesar looked round him, a little wistfully. \u0027I must speak to him; I must,\u0027 Lucy cried; \u0027I must. Oh, what a darling he is!\u0027 She ran down the steps from the gallery and straight to Caesar. He smiled when she reached him, and gently pinched her ear. Fancy going through the rest of your life hearing all the voices of the world through an ear that has been pinched by Caesar! \u0027Oh, thank you! thank you!\u0027 said Philip; \u0027how splendid you are. I\u0027ll swot up my Latin like anything next term, so as to read about you.\u0027 \u0027Are they all in?\u0027 Lucy asked. \u0027I do hope nobody was hurt.\u0027 Caesar smiled.[324] \u0027A most unreasonable wish, my child, after a great battle!\u0027 he said. \u0027But for once the unreasonable is the inevitable. Nobody was hurt. You see it was necessary to get every man back into the book just as he left it, or what would the schoolmasters have done? There remain now only my own guard who have in charge the false woman who let loose the barbarians. And here they come.\u0027 Surrounded by a guard with drawn swords the Pretenderette advanced slowly. \u0027Hail, woman!\u0027 said Caesar. \u0027Hail, whoever you are!\u0027 said the Pretenderette very sulkily. \u0027I hail,\u0027 said Caesar, \u0027your courage.\u0027 Philip and Lucy looked at each other. Yes, the Pretenderette had courage: they had not thought of that before. All the attempts she had made against them—she alone in a strange land—yes, these needed courage. \u0027And I demand to know how you came here?\u0027 \u0027When I found he\u0027d been at his building again,\u0027 she said, pointing a contemptuous thumb at Philip, \u0027I was just going to pull it down, and I knocked down a brick or two with my sleeve, and not thinking what I was doing I built them up again; and then I got a bit giddy and the whole thing seemed to begin to grow—candle[325]sticks and bricks and dominoes and everything, bigger and bigger and bigger, and I looked in. It was as big as a church by this time, and I saw that boy losing his way among the candlestick pillars, and I followed him and I listened. And I thought I could be as good a Deliverer as anybody else. And the motor veil that I was going to catch the 2.37 train in was a fine disguise.\u0027 \u0027You tried to injure the children,\u0027 Caesar reminded her. \u0027I don\u0027t want to say anything to make you let me off,\u0027 said the Pretenderette, \u0027but at the beginning I didn\u0027t think any of it was real. I thought it was a dream. You can let your evil passions go in a dream and it don\u0027t hurt any one.\u0027 \u0027It hurts you,\u0027 Caesar said. \u0027Oh! that\u0027s no odds,\u0027 said the Pretenderette scornfully. \u0027You sought to injure and confound the children at every turn,\u0027 said Caesar, \u0027even when you found that things were real.\u0027 \u0027I saw there was a chance of being Queen,\u0027 said the Pretenderette, \u0027and I took it. Seems to me you\u0027ve no occasion to talk if you\u0027re Julius Caesar, the same as the bust in the library. You took what you could get right enough in your time, when all\u0027s said and done.\u0027[326] \u0027I hail,\u0027 said Caesar again, \u0027your courage.\u0027 \u0027You needn\u0027t trouble,\u0027 she said, tossing her head; \u0027my game\u0027s up now, and I\u0027ll speak my mind if I die for it. You don\u0027t understand. You\u0027ve never been a servant, to see other people get all the fat and you all the bones. What you think it\u0027s like to know if you\u0027d just been born in a gentleman\u0027s mansion instead of in a model workman\u0027s dwelling you\u0027d have been brought up as a young lady and had the openwork silk stockings and the lace on your under-petticoats.\u0027 \u0027You go too deep for me,\u0027 said Caesar, with the ghost of a smile. \u0027I now pronounce your sentence. But life has pronounced on you a sentence worse than any I can give you. Nobody loves you.\u0027 \u0027Oh, you old silly,\u0027 said the Pretenderette in a burst of angry tears, \u0027don\u0027t you see that\u0027s just why everything\u0027s happened?\u0027 \u0027You are condemned,\u0027 said Caesar calmly, \u0027to make yourself beloved. You will be taken to Briskford, where you will teach the Great Sloth to like his work and keep him awake for eight play-hours a day. In the intervals of your toil you must try to get fond of some one. The Halma people are kind and gentle. You will not find them hard to love. And when the Great Sloth loves his work and the Halma[327] people are so fond of you that they feel they cannot bear to lose you, your penance will be over and you can go where you will.\u0027 \u0027You know well enough,\u0027 said the Pretenderette, still tearful and furious, \u0027that if that ever happened I shouldn\u0027t want to go anywhere else.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Caesar slowly, \u0027I know.\u0027 Lucy would have liked to kiss the Pretenderette and say she was sorry, but you can\u0027t do that when it is all other people\u0027s fault and they aren\u0027t sorry. And besides, before all these people, it would have looked like showing off. You know, I am sure, exactly how Lucy felt. The Pretenderette was led away. And now Caesar stood facing the children, his hands held out in farewell. The growing light of early morning transfigured his face, and to Philip it suddenly seemed to be most remarkably like the face of That Man, Mr. Peter Graham, whom Helen had married. He was just telling himself not to be a duffer when Lucy cried out in a loud cracked-sounding voice, \u0027Daddy, oh, Daddy!\u0027 and sprang forward. And at that moment the sun rose above the city wall, and its rays gleamed redly on the helmet and the breastplate and the shield and the sword of Caesar. The light struck at the children\u0027s eyes like a blow. Dazzled, they[328] closed their eyes and when they opened them, blinking and confused, Caesar was gone and the marble book was closed—for ever. . . . . . . Three days later Mr. Noah arrived by elephant, and the meeting between him and the children is, as they say, better imagined than described. Especially as there is not much time left now for describing anything. Mr. Noah explained that the freeing of Polistopolis from the Pretenderette and the barbarians counted as the seventh deed and that Philip had now attained the rank of King, the deed of the Great Sloth having given him the title of Prince of Pine-apples. His expression of gratitude and admiration were of the warmest, and Philip felt that it was rather ungrateful of him to say, as he couldn\u0027t help saying: \u0027Now I\u0027ve done all the deeds, mayn\u0027t I go back to Helen?\u0027 \u0027All in good time,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027I will at once set about the arrangements for your coronation.\u0027 The coronation was an occasion of unexampled splendour. There was a banquet (of course) and fireworks, and all the guns fired salutes and the soldiers presented arms, and the ladies presented bouquets. And at the end Mr. Noah, with a few well-chosen words which[329] brought tears to all eyes, placed the gold crown of Polistarchia upon the brow of Philip, where its diamonds and rubies shone dazzlingly. There was an extra crown for Lucy, made of silver and pearls and pale silvery moonstones. You have no idea how the Polistarchians shouted. \u0027And now,\u0027 said Mr. Noah when it was all over, \u0027I regret to inform you that we must part. Polistarchia is a Republic, and of course in a republic kings and queens are not permitted to exist. Partings are painful things. And you had better go at once.\u0027 He was plainly very much upset. \u0027This is very sudden,\u0027 said Philip. And Lucy said, \u0027I do think it\u0027s silly. How shall we get home? All in a hurry, like this?\u0027 \u0027How did you get here?\u0027 \u0027By building a house and getting into it.\u0027 \u0027Then build your own house. Oh, we have models of all the houses you were ever in. The pieces are all numbered. You only have to put them together.\u0027 He led them to a large room behind the hall of Public Amusements and took down from a shelf a stout box labelled \u0027The Grange.\u0027 On another box Philip saw \u0027Laburnum Cottage.\u0027 Mr. Noah, kneeling on his yellow mat,[330] tumbled the contents of the box out on the floor, and Philip and Lucy set to work to build a house with the exquisitely finished little blocks and stones and beams and windows and chimneys. \u0027I cannot bear to see you go,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027Good-bye, good-bye. Remember me sometimes!\u0027 \u0027We shall never forget you,\u0027 said the children, jumping up hugging him. \u0027Good-bye!\u0027 said the parrot who had followed them in. \u0027Good-bye, good-bye!\u0027 said everybody. \u0027I wish the Lightning Loose was not lost,\u0027 Philip even at this parting moment remembered to say. \u0027She isn\u0027t,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027She flew back to the island directly you left her. Sails are called wings, are they not? White wings that never grow weary, you know. Relieved of your weight, the faithful yacht flew home like any pigeon.\u0027 \u0027Hooray!\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I couldn\u0027t bear to think of her rotting away in a cavern.\u0027 \u0027I wish Max and Brenda had come to say good-bye,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027It is not needed,\u0027 said Mr. Noah mysteriously. And then everybody said good-bye again, and Mr. Noah rolled up his yellow mat, put it under his arm again, and went—for ever.[331] The children built the Grange, and when the beautiful little model of that house was there before them, perfect, they stood still a moment, looking at it. \u0027I wish we could be two people each,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027and one of each of us go home and one of each of us stay here. Oh!\u0027 she cried suddenly, and snatched at Philip\u0027s arm. For a slight strange giddiness had suddenly caught her. Philip too swayed a little uncertainly and stood a moment with his hand to his head. The children gazed about them bewildered and still a little giddy. The room was gone, the model of the Grange was gone. Over their heads was blue sky, under their feet was green grass, and in front stood the Grange itself, with its front door wide open and on the steps Helen and Mr. Peter Graham. That telegram had brought them home. . . . . . . You will wonder how Lucy explained where she had been when she was lost. She never did explain. There are some things, as you know, that cannot be explained. But the curious thing is that no one ever asked for an explanation. The grown-ups must have thought they knew all about it, which, of course, was very far from being the truth. When the four people on the doorstep of the[332] Grange had finished saying how glad they were to see each other—that day on the steps when Philip and Lucy came back from Polistarchia, Helen and Mr. Peter Graham came back from Belgium—Helen said: \u0027And we\u0027ve brought you each the loveliest present. Fetch them, Peter, there\u0027s a dear.\u0027 Mr. Peter Graham went to the stable-yard and came back followed by two long tan dachshunds, who rushed up to the children frisking and fawning in a way they well knew. \u0027Why Max! why Brenda!\u0027 cried Philip. \u0027Oh, Helen! are they for us?\u0027 \u0027Yes, dear, of course they are,\u0027 said Helen; \u0027but how did you know their names?\u0027 That was one of the things which Philip could not tell, then. But he told Helen the whole story later, and she said it was wonderful, and how clever of him to make all that up, and that when he was a man he would be able to be an author and to write books. \u0027And do you know,\u0027 she said, \u0027I did dream about the island—quite a long dream, only when I woke up I could only remember that I\u0027d been there and seen you. But no doubt I dreamed about Mr. Noah and all the rest of it as well, only I forgot it.\u0027 . . . . . . And Max and Brenda of course loved every one. Their characters were quite unchanged. Only the children had forgotten the language of animals, so that conversation between them and the dogs was for ever impossible. But Max and Brenda understand every word you say—any one can see that. . . . . . . You want to know what became of the redheaded, steely-eyed nurse, the Pretenderette, who made so much mischief and trouble? Well, I suppose she is still living with the Halma folk, teaching the Great Sloth to like his work and learning to be fond of people—which is the only way to be happy. At any rate no one that I know of has ever seen her again anywhere else.
