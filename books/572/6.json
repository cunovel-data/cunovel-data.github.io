{"id":12309,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI THE LIONS IN THE DESERT","content":"\\n\\n \u0027But why?\u0027 asked Philip at dinner, which was no painted wonder of wooden make-believe, but real roast guinea-fowl and angel pudding, \u0027Why do you only have wooden things to eat at your banquets?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Banquets are extremely important occasions,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027and real food—food that you can eat and enjoy—only serves to distract the mind from the serious affairs of life. Many of the most successful caterers in your world have grasped this great truth.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But why,\u0027 Lucy asked, \u0027do you have the big silver bowls with nothing in them?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Noah sighed. \u0027The bowls are for dessert,\u0027 he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But there isn\u0027t any dessert in them,\u0027 Lucy objected. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, sighing again, \u0027that\u0027s just it. There is no dessert. There has never[161] been any dessert. Will you have a little more angel pudding?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was quite plain to Lucy and Philip that Mr. Noah wished to change the subject, which, for some reason, was a sad one, and with true politeness they both said \u0027Yes, please,\u0027 to the angel pudding offer, though they had already had quite as much as they really needed. \\n\\n \\n\\n After dinner Mr. Noah took them for a walk through the town, \u0027to see the factories,\u0027 he said. This surprised Philip, who had been taught not to build factories with his bricks because factories were so ugly, but the factories turned out to be pleasant, long, low houses, with tall French windows opening into gardens of roses, where people of all nations made beautiful and useful things, and loved making them. And all the people who were making them looked clean and happy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wish we had factories like those,\u0027 Philip said. \u0027Our factories are so ugly. Helen says so.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s because all your factories are money factories,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027though they\u0027re called by all sorts of different names. Every one here has to make something that isn\u0027t just money or for money—something useful and beautiful.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Even you?\u0027 said Lucy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Even I,\u0027 said Mr. Noah.[162] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What do you make?\u0027 the question was bound to come. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Laws, of course,\u0027 Mr. Noah answered in some surprise. \u0027Didn\u0027t you know I was the Chief Judge?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But laws can\u0027t be useful and beautiful, can they?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They can certainly be useful,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027and,\u0027 he added with modest pride, \u0027my laws are beautiful. What do you think of this? \"Everybody must try to be kind to everybody else. Any one who has been unkind must be sorry and say so.\"\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It seems all right,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027but it\u0027s not exactly beautiful.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, don\u0027t you think so?\u0027 said Mr. Noah, a little hurt; \u0027it mayn\u0027t sound beautiful perhaps—I never could write poetry—but it\u0027s quite beautiful when people do it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, if you mean your laws are beautiful when they\u0027re kept,\u0027 said Philip. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Beautiful things can\u0027t be beautiful when they\u0027re broken, of course,\u0027 Mr. Noah explained. \u0027Not even laws. But ugly laws are only beautiful when they are broken. That\u0027s odd, isn\u0027t it? Laws are very tricky things.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I say,\u0027 Philip said suddenly, as they climbed one of the steep flights of steps between trees in pots, \u0027couldn\u0027t we do another of the deeds[163] now? I don\u0027t feel as if I\u0027d really done anything to-day at all. It was Lucy who did the carpet. Do tell us the next deed.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The next deed,\u0027 Mr. Noah answered, \u0027will probably take some time. There\u0027s no reason why you should not begin it to-day if you like. It is a deed peculiarly suited to a baronet. I don\u0027t know why,\u0027 he added hastily; \u0027it may be that it is the only thing that baronets are good for. I shouldn\u0027t wonder. The existence of baronets,\u0027 he added musingly, \u0027has always seemed to the thoughtful to lack justification. Perhaps this deed which you will begin to-day is the wise end to which baronets were designed.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, I daresay,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027but what is the end?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Mr. Noah owned, \u0027but I\u0027ll tell you what the deed is. You\u0027ve got to journey to the land of the Dwellers by the Sea and, by any means that may commend itself to you, slay their fear.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip naturally asked what the Dwellers by the Sea were afraid of. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That you will learn from them,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027but it is a very great fear.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is it something we shall be afraid of too?\u0027 Lucy asked. And Philip at once said, \u0027Oh, then she really did mean to come, did she?[164] But she wasn\u0027t to if she was afraid. Girls weren\u0027t expected to be brave.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They are, here,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027the girls are expected to be brave and the boys kind.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Philip doubtfully. And Lucy said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course I meant to come. You know you promised.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n So that was settled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And now,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, rubbing his hands with the cheerful air of one who has a great deal to do and is going to enjoy doing it, \u0027we must fit you out a proper expedition, for the Dwellers by the Sea are a very long way off. What would you like to ride on?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A horse,\u0027 said Philip, truly pleased. He said horse, because he did not want to ride a donkey, and he had never seen any one ride any animal but these two. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 Mr. Noah said, patting him on the back. \u0027I was so afraid you\u0027d ask for a bicycle. And there\u0027s a dreadful law here—it was made by mistake, but there it is—that if any one asks for machinery they have to have it and keep on using it. But as to a horse. Well, I\u0027m not sure. You see, you have to ride right across the pebbly waste, and it\u0027s a good three days\u0027 journey. But come along to the stables.\u0027[165] \\n\\n \\n\\n You know the kind of stables they would be? The long shed with stalls such as you had, when you were little, for your little wooden horses and carts? Only there were not only horses here, but every sort of animal that has ever been ridden on. Elephants, camels, donkeys, mules, bulls, goats, zebras, tortoises, ostriches, bisons, and pigs. And in the last stall of all, which was not of common wood but of beaten silver, stood the very Hippogriff himself, with his long, white mane and his long, white tail, and his gentle, beautiful eyes. His long, white wings were folded neatly on his satin-smooth back, and how he and the stall got here was more than Philip could guess. All the others were Noah\u0027s Ark animals, alive, of course, but still Noah\u0027s Arky beyond possibility of mistake. But the Hippogriff was not Noah\u0027s Ark at all. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He came,\u0027 Mr. Noah explained, \u0027out of a book. One of the books you used to build your city with.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t we have him?\u0027 Lucy said; \u0027he looks such a darling.\u0027 And the Hippogriff turned his white velvet nose and nuzzled against her in affectionate acknowledgment of the compliment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not if you both go,\u0027 Mr. Noah explained. \u0027He cannot carry more than one person at a[166] time unless one is an Earl. No, if I may advise, I should say go by camel.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Can the camel carry two?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course. He is called the ship of the desert,\u0027 Mr. Noah informed them, \u0027and a ship that wouldn\u0027t carry more than one would be simply silly.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n So that was settled. Mr. Noah himself saddled and bridled the camel, which was a very large one, with his own hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Let me see,\u0027 he said, standing thoughtful with the lead rope in his hand, \u0027you\u0027ll be wanting dogs—\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I always want dogs,\u0027 said Philip warmly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027—to use in emergencies.\u0027 He whistled and two Noah\u0027s Ark dogs leaped from their kennels to their chains\u0027 end. They were dachshunds, very long and low, and very alike except that one was a little bigger and a little browner than the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This is your master and that\u0027s your mistress,\u0027 Mr. Noah explained to the dogs, and they fawned round the children. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Then you\u0027ll want things to eat and things to drink and tents and umbrellas in case of bad weather, and—— But let\u0027s turn down this street; just at the corner we shall find exactly what we want.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a shop that said outside \u0027Universal[167] Provider. Expeditions fitted out at a moment\u0027s notice. Punctuality and dispatch.\u0027 The shopkeeper came forward politely. He was so exactly like Mr. Noah that the children knew who he was even before he said, \u0027Well, father,\u0027 and Mr. Noah said, \u0027This is my son: he has had some experience in outfits.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What have you got to start with?\u0027 the son asked, getting to business at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Two dogs, two children, and a camel,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027Yes, I know it\u0027s customary to have two of everything, but I assure you, my dear boy, that one camel is as much as Sir Philip can manage. It is indeed.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Noah\u0027s son very dutifully supposed that his father knew best and willingly agreed to provide everything that was needed for the expedition, including one best-quality talking parrot, and to deliver all goods, carefully packed, within half an hour. \\n\\n . . . . . . \\n\\n \\n\\n So now you see Philip, and Lucy who still wore her fairy dress, packed with all their belongings on the top of a very large and wobbly camel, and being led out of the city by the usual procession, with seven bands of music all playing \u0027See the Conquering Hero goes,\u0027 quite a different tune from the one you know, which has a name a little like that.[168] \\n\\n \\n\\n The camel and its load were rather a tight fit for the particular gateway that they happened to go out by, and the children had to stoop to avoid scraping their heads against the top of the arch. But they got through all right, and now they were well on the road which was really little more than a field path running through the flowery meadow country where the dragon had been killed. They saw the Stonehenge ruins and the big tower far away to the left, and in front lay the vast and interesting expanse of the Absolutely Unknown. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sun was shining—there was a sun, and Mr. Noah had told the children that it came out of the poetry books, together with rain and flowers and the changing seasons—and in spite of the strange, almost-tumble-no-it\u0027s-all-right-but-you\u0027d-better-look-out way in which the camel walked, the two travellers were very happy. The dogs bounded along in the best of spirits, and even the camel seemed less a prey than usual to that proud melancholy which you must have noticed in your visits to the Zoo as his most striking quality. \\n\\n \\n\\n [169]It was certainly very grand to ride on a camel, and Lucy tried not to think how difficult it would be to get on and off. The parrot was interesting too. It talked extremely well. Of course you understand that, if you can only[171] make a parrot understand, it can tell you everything you want to know about other animals; because it understands their talk quite naturally and without being made. The present parrot declined ordinary conversation, and when questioned only recited poetry of a rather dull kind that went on and on. \u0027Arms and the man I sing\u0027 it began, and then something about haughty Juno. Its voice was soothing, and riding on the camel was not unlike being rocked in a very bumpety cradle. The children were securely seated in things like padded panniers, and they had had an exciting day. As the sun set, which it did quite soon, the parrot called out to the nearest dog, \u0027I say, Max, they\u0027re asleep.\u0027 \\n\\n On the top of a very large and wobbly camel. On the top of a very large and wobbly camel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t wonder,\u0027 said Max. \u0027But it\u0027s all right. Humpty knows the way.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Keep a civil tongue in your head, you young dog, can\u0027t you?\u0027 said the camel grumpily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be cross, darling,\u0027 said the other dog, whose name was Brenda, \u0027and be sure you stop at a really first-class oasis for the night. But I know we can trust you, dear.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The camel muttered that it was all very well, but his voice was not quite as cross as before. \\n\\n \\n\\n After that the expedition went on in silence through the deepening twilight.[172] \\n\\n \\n\\n A tumbling, shaking, dumping sensation, more like a soft railway accident than anything else, awakened our travellers, and they found that the camel was kneeling down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Off you come,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027and make the fire and boil the kettle.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Polly put the kettle on,\u0027 Lucy said absently, as she slid down to the ground; to which the parrot replied, \u0027Certainly not. I wish you wouldn\u0027t rake up that old story. It was quite false. I never did put a kettle on, and I never will.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Why should I describe to you the adventure of camping at an oasis in a desert? You must all have done it many times; or if you have not done it, you have read about it. You know all about the well and the palm trees and the dates and things. They had cocoa for supper. It was great fun, and they slept soundly and awoke in the morning with a heart for any fate, as a respectable poet puts it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next day was just the same as the first, only instead of going through fresh green fields, the way lay through dry yellow desert. And again the children slept, and again the camel chose an oasis with remarkable taste and judgment. But the second night was not at all the same as the first. For in the middle of it the parrot awakened Philip by biting his ear, and[173] then hopping to a safe distance from his awakening fists and crying out, \u0027Make up the camp fire—look alive. It\u0027s lions.\u0027 The dogs were whining and barking, and Brenda was earnestly trying to climb a palm tree. Max faced the danger, it is true, but he seemed to have no real love of sport. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip sprang up and heaped dead palm scales and leaves on the dying fire. It blazed up and something moved beyond the bushes. Philip wondered whether those pairs of shining things, like strayed stars, that he saw in the darkness, could really be the eyes of lions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What a nuisance these lions are to be sure,\u0027 said the parrot. \u0027No, they won\u0027t come near us while the fire\u0027s burning, but really, they ought to be put down by law.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Why doesn\u0027t somebody kill them?\u0027 Lucy asked. She had wakened when Philip did, and, after a meditative minute, had helped with the palm scales and things. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not so easy,\u0027 said the parrot; \u0027nobody knows how to do it. How would you kill a lion?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Philip; but Lucy said, \u0027Are they Noah\u0027s Ark lions?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course they are,\u0027 said Polly; \u0027all the books with lions in them are kept shut up.\u0027[174] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know how you could kill Noah\u0027s Ark lions if you could catch them,\u0027 Lucy said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s easy enough to catch them,\u0027 said Polly; \u0027an hour after dawn they go to sleep, but it\u0027s unsportsmanlike to kill game when it\u0027s asleep.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going to think, if you don\u0027t mind,\u0027 Lucy announced, and sat down very near the fire. \u0027It\u0027s just the opposite of the dragon,\u0027 she said after a minute. The parrot nodded and there was a long silence. Then suddenly Lucy jumped up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 she cried, \u0027oh—I really do know. And it won\u0027t hurt them either. I don\u0027t a bit mind killing things, but I do hate hurting them. There\u0027s plenty of rope, I know.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Then when it\u0027s dawn we\u0027ll tie them up and then you\u0027ll see.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I think you might tell me,\u0027 said Philip, injured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No—they may understand what we say. Polly does.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip made a natural suggestion. But Lucy replied that it was not manners to whisper, and the parrot said that it should think not indeed. \\n\\n \\n\\n So, sitting by the fire, all faces turned to where those strange twin stars shone and those strange hidden movements and rustlings[175] stirred, the expedition waited for the dawn. Brenda had given up the tree-climbing idea, and was cuddling up as close to Lucy as possible. The camel, who had been trembling with fear all the while, tried to cuddle up to Philip, which would have been easier if it had been a smaller kind instead of being, as it was, what Mr. Noah\u0027s son, the Universal Provider, had called, \u0027an out size in camels.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And presently dawn came, not slow and silvery as dawns come here, but sudden and red, with strong level lights and the shadows of the palm trees stretching all across the desert. \\n\\n \\n\\n In broad daylight it did not seem so hard to have to go and look for the lions. They all went—even the camel pulled himself together to join the lion-hunt, and Brenda herself decided to come rather than be left alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n The lions were easily found. There were only two of them, of course, and they were lying close together, each on its tawny side on the sandy desert at the edge of the oasis. \\n\\n \\n\\n Very gently the ropes, with slip knots, were fitted over their heads, and the other end of the rope passed round a palm tree. Other ropes round the trees were passed round what would have been the waists of the lions if lions had such things as waists.[176] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now!\u0027 whispered Lucy, and at once all four ropes were pulled tight. The lions struggled, but only in their sleep. And soon they were still. Then with more and more ropes their legs and tails were made fast. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And that\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Lucy, rather out of breath. \u0027Where\u0027s Polly?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 replied that bird from a neighbouring bush. \u0027I thought I should only be in the way if I kept close to you. But I longed to lend a claw in such good work. Can I help now?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Will you please explain to the dogs?\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027It\u0027s their turn now. The only way I know to kill Noah\u0027s Ark lions is to lick the paint off and break their legs. And if the dogs lick all the paint off their legs they won\u0027t feel it when we break them.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Polly hastened to explain to the dogs, and then turned again to Lucy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They asked if you\u0027re sure the ropes will hold, and I\u0027ve told them of course. So now they\u0027re going to begin. I only hope the paint won\u0027t make them ill.\u0027 \\n\\n It was heavy work turning the lions over. It was heavy work turning the lions over. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It never did me,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027I sucked the dove quite clean one Sunday, and it wasn\u0027t half bad. Tasted of sugar a little and eucalyptus oil like they give you when you\u0027ve got a cold. Tell them that, Polly.\u0027[177] \\n\\n \\n\\n Polly did, and added, \u0027I will recite poetry to them to hearten them to their task.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do,\u0027 said Philip heartily, \u0027it may make them hurry up. But perhaps you\u0027d better tell them that we shall pinch their tails if they happen to go to sleep.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the children had a cocoa-and-date breakfast. (All expeditions seem to live mostly on cocoa, and when they come back they often write to the cocoa makers to say how good it was and they don\u0027t know what they would have done without it.) And the noble and devoted dogs licked and licked and licked, and the paint began to come off the lions\u0027 legs like anything. It was heavy work turning the lions over so as to get at the other or unlicked side, but the expedition worked with a will, and the lions resisted but feebly, being still asleep, and, besides, weak from loss of paint. And the dogs had a drink given them and were patted and praised, and set to work again. And they licked and licked for hours and hours. And in the end all the paint was off the lions\u0027 legs, and Philip chopped them off with the explorer\u0027s axe which that experienced Provider, Mr. Noah\u0027s son, had thoughtfully included in the outfit of the expedition. And as he chopped the chips flew, and Lucy picked one up, and it was wood, just wood and nothing[178] else, though when they had tied it up it had been real writhing resisting lion-leg and no mistake. And when all the legs were chopped off, Philip put his hand on a lion body, and that was wood too. So the lions were dead indeed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It seems a pity,\u0027 he said. \u0027Lions are such jolly beasts when they are alive.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I never cared for lions myself,\u0027 said Polly; and Lucy said, \u0027Never mind, Phil. It didn\u0027t hurt them anyway.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And that was the first time she ever called him Phil. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027All right, Lu,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027It was jolly clever of you to think of it anyhow.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And that was the first time he ever called her Lu. \\n\\n . . . . . . \\n\\n \\n\\n [179]They saw the straight pale line of the sea for a long time before they came to the place of the Dwellers by the Sea. For these people had built their castle down on the very edge of the sea, and the Pebbly Waste rose and rose to a mountain that hid their castle from the eyes of the camel-riders who were now drawing near to the scene of their next deed. The Pebbly Waste was all made of small slippery stones, and the children understood how horrid a horse would have found it. Even the camel went[181] very slowly, and the dogs no longer frisked and bounded, but went at a foot\u0027s pace with drooping ears and tails. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I should call a halt, if I were you,\u0027 said Polly. \u0027We shall all be the better for a cup of cocoa. And besides——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Polly refused to explain this dark hint and only added, \u0027Look out for surprises.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I thought,\u0027 said Philip, draining the last of his second mug of cocoa, \u0027I thought there were no birds in the desert except you, and you\u0027re more a person than a bird. But look there.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Far away across the desert a moving speck showed, high up in the blue air. It grew bigger and bigger, plainly coming towards the camp. It was as big as a moth now, now as big as a teacup, now as big as an eagle, and—— \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But it\u0027s got four legs,\u0027 said Lucy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the parrot; \u0027it would have, you know. It is the Hippogriff.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was indeed that magnificent wonder. Flying through the air with long sweeps of his great white wings, the Hippogriff drew nearer and nearer, bearing on his back—what? \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the Pretenderette,\u0027 cried Lucy, and at the same moment Philip said, \u0027It\u0027s that nasty motor thing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was. The Hippogriff dropped from the[182] sky to the desert below as softly as a butterfly alighting on a flower, and stood there in all his gracious whiteness. And on his back was the veiled motor lady. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027So glad I\u0027ve caught you up,\u0027 she said in that hateful voice of hers; \u0027now we can go on together.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t see what you wanted to come at all for,\u0027 said Philip downrightly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, don\u0027t you?\u0027 she said, sitting up there on the Hippogriff with her horrid motor veil fluttering in the breeze from the now hidden sea. \u0027Why, of course, I have a right to be present at all experiments. There ought to be some responsible grown-up person to see that you really do what you\u0027re sure to say you\u0027ve done.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do you mean that we\u0027re liars?\u0027 Philip asked hotly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t mean to say anything about it,\u0027 the Pretenderette answered with an unpleasant giggle, \u0027but a grown-up person ought to be present.\u0027 She added something about a parcel of birds and children. And the parrot ruffled his feathers till he looked twice his proper size. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip said he didn\u0027t see it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, but I do,\u0027 said the Pretenderette; \u0027if you fail, then it\u0027s my turn, and I might very likely succeed the minute after you\u0027d failed.[183] So we\u0027ll all go on comfortably together. Won\u0027t that be nice?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n A speechless despair seemed to have fallen on the party. Nobody spoke. The children looked blank, the dogs whined, the camel put on his haughtiest sneer, and the parrot fidgeted in his fluffed-out feather dress. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s be starting,\u0027 said the motor lady. \u0027Gee-up, pony!\u0027 A shiver ran through every one present. That a Pretenderette should dare to speak so to a Hippogriff! \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly the parrot spread its wings and flew to perch on Philip\u0027s shoulder. It whispered in his ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Whispering is not manners, I know,\u0027 it said, \u0027but your own generous heart will excuse me. \"Parcel of birds and children.\" Doesn\u0027t your blood boil?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip thought it did. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, then,\u0027 said the bird impatiently, \u0027what are we waiting for? You\u0027ve only got to say the word and I\u0027ll take her back by the ear.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wish you would,\u0027 said Philip from the heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nothing easier,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027the miserable outsider! Intruding into our expedition! I advise you to await my return here. Or if I am not back by the morning[184] there will be no objection to your calling, about noon, on the Dwellers. I can rejoin you there. Good-bye.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It stroked his ear with a gentle and kindly beak and flew into the air and circled three times round the detested motor lady\u0027s head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Get away,\u0027 she cried, flapping her hands furiously; \u0027call your silly Poll-parrot off, can\u0027t you?\u0027 And then she screamed, \u0027Oh! it\u0027s got hold of my ear!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, don\u0027t hurt her,\u0027 said Lucy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I will not hurt her;\u0027 the parrot let the ear go on purpose to say this, and the Pretenderette covered both ears with her hands. \u0027You person in the veil, I shall take hold again in a moment. And it will hurt you much less if the Hippogriff and I happen to be flying in the same direction. See? If I were you I should just say \"Go back the way you came, please,\" to the Hippogriff, and then I shall hardly hurt you at all. Don\u0027t think of getting off. If you do, the dogs will have you. Keep your hands over your ears if you like. I know you can hear me well enough. Now I am going to take hold of you again. Keep your hands where they are. I\u0027m not particular to an ear or so. A nose will do just as well.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The person on the Hippogriff put both hands[185] to her nose. Instantly the parrot had her again by the ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Go back the way you came,\u0027 she cried; \u0027but I\u0027ll be even with you children yet.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The Hippogriff did not move. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Let go my ear,\u0027 screamed the lady. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll have to say please, you know,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027not to the bird, I don\u0027t mean that: that\u0027s no good. But to the Hippogriff.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Please then,\u0027 said the lady in a burst of temper, and instantly the white wings parted and spread and the Hippogriff rose in the air. Polly let the ear go for the moment to say: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I shan\u0027t hurt her so long as she behaves,\u0027 and then took hold again and his little grey wings and the big white wings of the Hippogriff went sailing away across the desert. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What a treasure of a parrot?\u0027 said Philip. But Lucy said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Who is that Pretenderette? Why is she so horrid to us when every one else is so nice?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027hateful old thing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t help feeling as if I knew her quite well, if I could only remember who she is.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do you?\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I say, let\u0027s play noughts and crosses. I\u0027ve got a notebook and a bit of pencil in my pocket. We might play till it\u0027s time to go to sleep.\u0027[186] \\n\\n \\n\\n So they played noughts and crosses on the Pebbly Waste, and behind them the parrot and the Hippogriff took away the tiresome one, and in front of them lay the high pebble ridge that was like a mountain, and beyond that was the unknown and the adventure and the Dwellers and the deed to be done. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2055/58504.html","bookId":572,"book":{"id":572,"title":"The Magic City","description":"简介： Philip Haldane and his sister lived in a little red-roofed house in a little red-roofed town.
