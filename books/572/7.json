{"id":12310,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII THE DWELLERS BY THE SEA","content":"You soon get used to things. It seemed quite natural and homelike to Philip to be wakened in bright early out-of-door\u0027s morning by the gentle beak of the parrot at his ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You got back all right then,\u0027 he said sleepily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It was rather a long journey,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027but I thought it better to come back by wing. The Hippogriff offered to bring me; he is the soul of courteous gentleness. But he was tired too. The Pretenderette is in gaol for the moment, but I\u0027m afraid she\u0027ll get out again; we\u0027re so unused to having prisoners, you see. And it\u0027s no use putting her on her honour, because——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Because she hasn\u0027t any,\u0027 Philip finished. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t say that,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027of anybody. I\u0027d only say we haven\u0027t come across it. What about breakfast?\u0027[188] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027How meals do keep happening,\u0027 said Lucy, yawning; \u0027it seems only a few minutes since supper. And yet here we are, hungry again!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027that\u0027s what people always feel when they have to get their meals themselves!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n When the camel and the dogs had been served with breakfast, the children and the parrot sat down to eat. And there were many questions to ask. The parrot answered some, and some it didn\u0027t answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But there\u0027s one thing,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027I do most awfully want to know. About the Hippogriff. How did it get out of the book?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a long story,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027so I\u0027ll tell it shortly. That\u0027s a very good rule. Tell short stories longly and long stories shortly. Many years ago, in repairing one of the buildings, the masons removed the supports of one of the books which are part of the architecture. The book fell. It fell open, and out came the Hippogriff. Then they saw something struggling under the next page and lifted it, and out came a megatherium. So they shut the book and built it into the wall again.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But how did the megawhatsitsname and the Hippogriff come to be the proper size?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah! that\u0027s one of the eleven mysteries. Some sages suppose that the country gave itself[189] a sort of shake and everything settled down into the size it ought to be. I think myself that it\u0027s the air. The moment you breathe this enchanted air you become the right size. You did, you know.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But why did they shut the book?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It was a book of beasts. Who knows what might have come out next? A tiger perhaps. And ravening for its prey as likely as not.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027and of course beasts weren\u0027t really needed, because of there being all the Noah\u0027s Ark ones.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027so they shut the book.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But the weather came out of books?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That was another book, a poetry book. It had only one cover, so everything that was on the last page got out naturally. We got a lot out of that page, rain and sun and sky and clouds, mountains, gardens, roses, lilies, flowers in general, \"Blossoms of delight\" they were called in the book and trees and the sea, and the desert and silver and iron—as much of all of them as anybody could possibly want. There are no limits to poets\u0027 imaginations, you know.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Lucy, and took a large bite of cake. \u0027And where did you come from, Polly, dear?\u0027[190] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I,\u0027 said the parrot modestly, \u0027came out of the same book as the Hippogriff. We were on the same page. My wings entitled me to associate with him, of course, but I have sometimes thought they just put me in as a contrast. My smallness, his greatness; my red and green, his white.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Lucy again, \u0027and please will you tell us——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Enough of this,\u0027 said the parrot; \u0027business before pleasure. You have begun the day with the pleasures of my conversation. You will have to work very hard to pay for this privilege.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n So they washed up the breakfast things in warm water obligingly provided by the camel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And now,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027we must pack up and go on our way to destroy the fear of the Dwellers by the Sea.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wonder,\u0027 Brenda said to Max in an undertone, \u0027I wonder whether it wouldn\u0027t be best for dear little dogs to lose themselves? We could turn up later, and be so very glad to be found.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But why?\u0027 Max asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve noticed,\u0027 said Brenda, sidling up to him with eager affectionateness, \u0027that wherever there\u0027s fear there\u0027s something to be afraid of, even if it\u0027s only your fancy. It would be[191] dreadful for dear little dogs to be afraid, Max, wouldn\u0027t it? So undignified.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My dear,\u0027 said Max heavily, \u0027I could give seven noble reasons for being faithful to our master. But I will only give you one. There is nothing to eat in the desert, and nothing to drink.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You always were so noble, dearest,\u0027 said Brenda; \u0027so different from poor little me. I\u0027ve only my affectionate nature. I know I\u0027m only a silly little thing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n So when the camel lurched forward and the parrot took wing, the dogs followed closely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Dear faithful things,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027Brenda! Max! Nice dogs!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And the dogs politely responding, bounded enthusiastically. \\n\\n \\n\\n The journey was not long. Quite soon they found a sort of ravine or gully in the cliff, and a path that led through it. And then they were on the beach, very pebbly with small stones, and there was the home of the Dwellers by the Sea; and beyond it, broad and blue and beautiful, the sea by which they dwelt. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Dwelling seemed to be a sort of town of rounded buildings more like lime-kilns than anything else, with arched doors leading to dark insides. They were all built of tiny stones, such as lay on the beach. Beyond the[192] huts or houses towered the castle, a vast rough structure with towers and arches and buttresses and bastions and glacis and bridges and a great moat all round it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But I never built a city like that, did you?\u0027 Lucy asked as they drew near. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Philip answered; \u0027at least—do you know, I do believe it\u0027s the sand castle Helen and I built last summer at Dymchurch. And those huts are the moulds I made of my pail—with the edges worn off, you know.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Towards the castle the travellers advanced, the camel lurching like a boat on a rough sea, and the dogs going with cat-like delicacy over the stones. They skirted large pools and tall rocks seaweed covered. Along a road broad enough for twelve chariots to have driven on it abreast, slowly they came to the great gate of the castle. And as they got nearer, they saw at every window heads leaning out; every battlement, every terrace, was crowded with figures. And when they were quite near, by throwing their heads very far back, so that their necks felt quite stiff for quite a long time afterwards, the children could see that all those people seemed quite young, and seemed to have very odd and delightful clothes—just a garment from shoulder to knee made, as it seemed, of dark fur.[193] \\n\\n Slowly they came to the great gate of the castle. Slowly they came to the great gate of the castle. \\n\\n \\n\\n [194] \\n\\n [195] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What lots of them there are,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027where did they come from?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Out of a book,\u0027 said the parrot; \u0027but the authorities were very prompt that time. Only a line and a half got out. \\n\\n \u0027Happy troops \\n\\n Of gentle islanders. \\n\\n \\n\\n Those are the islanders.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Then why,\u0027 asked Philip naturally, \u0027aren\u0027t they on an island?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s only one island, and no one is allowed on that except two people who never go there. But the islanders are happy even if they don\u0027t live on an island—always happy, except for the great fear.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Here the travellers began to cross one of the bridges across the moat, the bridge, in fact, which led to the biggest arch of all. It was a very rough arch, like the entrance to a cave. \\n\\n \\n\\n And from out its dark mouth came a little crowd of people. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re savages,\u0027 said Lucy, shrinking till she seemed only an extra hump on the camel\u0027s back. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were indeed of a dark complexion, sunburnt in fact, but their faces were handsome and kindly. They waved friendly hands and smiled in the most agreeable and welcoming way.[196] \\n\\n \\n\\n The tallest islander stepped out from the crowd. He was about as big as Philip. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re not savages,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027don\u0027t be a donkey. They\u0027re just children.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hush!\u0027 said the parrot; \u0027the Lord High Islander is now about to begin the state address of welcome!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He was. And this was the address. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027How jolly of you to come. Do get down off that camel and come indoors and have some grub. Jim, you might take that camel round to the stable and rub him down a bit. You\u0027d like to keep the dogs with you, of course. And what about the parrot?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Thanks awfully,\u0027 Philip responded, and slid off the camel, followed by Lucy; \u0027the parrot will make his own mind up—he always does.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They all trooped into the hall of the castle which was more like a cave than a hall and very dark, for the windows were little and high up. As Lucy\u0027s eyes got used to the light she perceived that the clothes of the islanders were not of skins but of seaweed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I asked you in,\u0027 said the Lord High Islander, a jolly-looking boy of about Philip\u0027s age, \u0027out of politeness. But really it isn\u0027t dinner time, and the meet is in half an hour. So, unless you\u0027re really hungry——?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The children said \u0027Not at all!\u0027[197] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You hunt, of course?\u0027 the Lord High Islander said; \u0027it\u0027s really the only sport we get here, except fishing. Of course we play games and all that. I do hope you won\u0027t be dull.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We came here on business,\u0027 the parrot remarked—and the happy islanders crowded round to see him, remarking—\u0027these are Philip and Lucy, claimants to the Deliverership. They are doing their deeds, you know,\u0027 the parrot ended. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy whispered, \u0027It\u0027s really Philip who is the claimant, not me; only the parrot\u0027s so polite.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The Lord High Islander frowned. \u0027We can talk about that afterwards,\u0027 he said; \u0027it\u0027s a pity to waste time now.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What do you hunt?\u0027 Philip asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027All the different kinds of graibeeste and the vertoblancs; and the blugraiwee, when we can find him,\u0027 said the Lord High Islander. \u0027But he\u0027s very scarce. Pinkuggers are more common, and much bigger, of course. Well, you\u0027ll soon see. If your camel\u0027s not quite fresh I can mount you both. What kind of animal do you prefer?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What do you ride?\u0027 Philip asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n It appeared that the Lord High Islander rode a giraffe, and Philip longed to ride another.[198] But Lucy said she would rather ride what she was used to, thank you. \\n\\n \\n\\n When they got out into the courtyard of the castle, they found it full of a crowd of animals, any of which you may find in the Zoo, or in your old Noah\u0027s ark if it was a sufficiently expensive one to begin with, and if you have not broken or lost too many of the inhabitants. Each animal had its rider and the party rode out on to the beach. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What is it they hunt?\u0027 Philip asked the parrot, who had perched on his shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027All the little animals in the Noah\u0027s ark that haven\u0027t any names,\u0027 the parrot told him. \u0027All those are considered fair game. Hullo! blugraiwee!\u0027 it shouted, as a little grey beast with blue spots started from the shelter of a rock and made for the cover of a patch of giant seaweed. Then all sorts of little animals got up and scurried off into places of security. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There goes a vertoblanc,\u0027 said the parrot, pointing to a bright green animal of uncertain shape, whose breast and paws were white, \u0027and there\u0027s a graibeeste.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The graibeeste was about as big as a fox, and had rabbit\u0027s ears and the unusual distinction of a tail coming out of his back just half-way between one end of him and the other. But there are graibeestes of all sorts and shapes.[199] \\n\\n \u0027If your camel\u0027s not quite fresh I can mount you both.\u0027 \u0027If your camel\u0027s not quite fresh I can mount you both.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n [200] \\n\\n [201] \\n\\n \\n\\n You know when people are making the animals for Noah\u0027s arks they make the big ones first, elephants and lions and tigers and so on, and paint them as nearly as they can the right colours. Then they get weary of copying nature and begin to paint the animals pink and green and chocolate colour, which in nature is not the case. These are the chockmunks, and vertoblancs and the pinkuggers. And presently the makers get sick of the whole business and make the animals any sort of shape and paint them all one grey—these are the graibeestes. And at the very end a guilty feeling of having been slackers comes over the makers of the Noah\u0027s arks, and they paint blue spots on the last and littlest of the graibeestes to ease their consciences. This is the blugraiwee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Tally Ho! Hark forrad! Yoicks!\u0027 were some of the observations now to be heard on every side as the hunt swept on, the blugraiwee well ahead. Dogs yapped, animals galloped, riders shouted, the sun shone, the sea sparkled, and far ahead the blugraiwee ran, extended to his full length like a grey straight line. He was killed five miles from the castle after a splendid run. And when a pinkugger had been secured and half a dozen graibeeste, the hunt rode slowly home.[202] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We only hunt to kill and we only kill for food,\u0027 the Lord High Islander said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027I thought Noah\u0027s ark animals turned into wood when they were dead?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not if you kill for food. The intention makes all the difference. I had a plum-cake intention when we put up the blugraiwee, the pinkugger I made a bread and butter intention about, and the graibeestes I intended for rice pudding and prunes and toffee and ices and all sorts of odd things. So, of course, when we come to cut them up they\u0027ll be what I intended.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Philip, jogging along on his camel. \u0027I say,\u0027 he added, \u0027you don\u0027t mind my asking—how is it you\u0027re all children here?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said the Lord High Islander, \u0027it\u0027s ancient history, so I don\u0027t suppose it\u0027s true. But they say that when the government had to make sure that we should always be happy troops of gentle islanders, they decided that the only way was for us to be children. And we do have the most ripping time. And we do our own hunting and cooking and wash up our own plates and things, and for heavy work we have the M.A.\u0027s. They\u0027re men who\u0027ve had to work at sums and history and things at College so hard that they want a holiday. So they come here and work for us, and if any of us do[203] want to learn anything, the M.A.\u0027s are handy to have about the place. It pleases them to teach anything, poor things. They live in the huts. There\u0027s always a long list waiting for their turn. Oh yes, they wear the seaweed dress the same as we do. And they hunt on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. They hunt big game, the fierce ambergris who is grey with a yellow stomach and the bigger graibeestes. Now we\u0027ll have dinner the minute we get in, and then we must talk about It.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The game was skinned and cut up in the courtyard, and the intentions of the Lord High Islander had certainly been carried out. For the blugraiwee was plum-cake, and the other animals just what was needed. \\n\\n \\n\\n And after dinner the Lord High Islander took Lucy and Philip up on to the top of the highest tower, and the three lay in the sun eating toffee and gazing out over the sea at the faint distant blue of the island. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The island where we aren\u0027t allowed to go,\u0027 as the Lord High Islander sadly pointed out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now,\u0027 said Lucy gently, \u0027you won\u0027t mind telling us what you\u0027re afraid of? Don\u0027t mind telling us. We\u0027re afraid too; we\u0027re afraid of all sorts of things quite often.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Speak for yourself,\u0027 said Philip, but not[204] unkindly. \u0027I\u0027m not so jolly often afraid as you seem to think. Go ahead, my Lord.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You might as well call me Billy,\u0027 said the Lord High Islander; \u0027it\u0027s my name.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, Billy, then. What is it you\u0027re afraid of?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I hate being afraid,\u0027 said Billy angrily. \u0027Of course I know no true boy is afraid of anything except doing wrong. One of the M.A.\u0027s told me that. But the M.A.\u0027s are afraid too.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What of?\u0027 Lucy asked, glancing at the terrace below, where already the shadows were lengthening; \u0027it\u0027ll be getting dark soon. I\u0027d much rather know what you\u0027re afraid of while it\u0027s daylight.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What we\u0027re afraid of,\u0027 said Billy abruptly, \u0027is the sea. Suppose a great wave came and washed away the castle, and the huts, and the M.A.\u0027s and all of us?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But it never has, has it?\u0027 Lucy asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, but everything must have a beginning. I know that\u0027s true, because another of the M.A.\u0027s told it me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But why don\u0027t you go and live somewhere inland?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Because we couldn\u0027t live away from the sea. We\u0027re islanders, you know; we couldn\u0027t bear not to be near the sea. And we\u0027d rather be afraid of it, than not have it to be afraid of.[205] But it upsets the government, because we ought to be happy troops of gentle islanders, and you can\u0027t be quite happy if you\u0027re afraid. That\u0027s why it\u0027s one of your deeds to take away our fear.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It sounds jolly difficult,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027I shall have to think,\u0027 he added desperately. So he lay and thought with Max and Brenda asleep by his side and the parrot preening its bright feathers on the parapet of the tower, while Lucy and the Lord High Islander played cat\u0027s cradle with a long thread of seaweed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s supper time,\u0027 said Billy at last. \u0027Have you thought of anything?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not a single thing,\u0027 said Philip. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, don\u0027t swat over it any more,\u0027 said Billy; \u0027just stay with us and have a jolly time. You\u0027re sure to think of something. Or else Lucy will. We\u0027ll act charades to-night.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They did. The rest of the islanders were an extremely jolly lot, and all the M.A.\u0027s came out of their huts to be audience. It was a charming evening, and ended up with hide-and-seek all over the castle. \\n\\n \\n\\n To wake next morning on a bed of soft, dry, sweet-smelling seaweed, and to know that the day was to be spent in having a good time with the jolliest set of children she had ever met, was delightful to Lucy. Philip\u0027s delight was[206] dashed by the knowledge that he must, sooner or later, think. But the day passed most agreeably. They all bathed in the rock pools, picked up shell-fish for dinner, played rounders in the afternoon, and in the evening danced to the music made by the M.A.\u0027s who most of them carried flutes in their pockets, and who were all very flattered at being asked to play. \\n\\n \\n\\n So the pleasant days went on. Every morning Philip said to himself, \u0027Now to-day I really must think of something,\u0027 and every night he said, \u0027I really ought to have thought of something.\u0027 But he never could think of anything to take away the fear of the gentle islanders. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was on the sixth night that the storm came. The wind blew and the sea roared and the castle shook to its very foundations. And Philip, awakened by the noise and the shaking, sat up in bed and understood what the fear was that spoiled the happiness of the Dwellers by the Sea. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Suppose the sea did sweep us all away,\u0027 he said; \u0027and they haven\u0027t even got a boat.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And then, when he was quite far from expecting it, he did think of something. And he went on thinking about it so hard that he couldn\u0027t sleep any more. \\n\\n \\n\\n And in the morning he said to the parrot: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve thought of something. And I\u0027m not[207] going to tell the others. But I can\u0027t do it all by myself. Do you think you could get Perrin for me?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I will try with pleasure,\u0027 replied the obliging bird, and flew off without further speech. \\n\\n \\n\\n That afternoon, just as a picnic tea was ending, a great shadow fell on the party, and next moment the Hippogriff alighted with Mr. Perrin and the parrot on its back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, thank you,\u0027 said Philip, and led Mr. Perrin away and began to talk to him in whispers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, sir,\u0027 Mr. Perrin answered suddenly and aloud. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but I couldn\u0027t think of it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you know how?\u0027 Philip asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know everything as is to be known in my trade,\u0027 said Mr. Perrin, \u0027but carpentry\u0027s one thing, and manners is another. Not but what I know manners too, which is why I won\u0027t be a party to no such a thing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But you don\u0027t understand,\u0027 said Philip, trying to keep up with Mr. Perrin\u0027s long strides. \u0027What I want to do is for you to build a Noah\u0027s ark on the top of the highest tower. Then when the sea\u0027s rough and the wind blows, all the Sea-Dwellers can just get into their ark and then they\u0027ll be quite safe whatever happens.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You said all that afore,\u0027 said Mr. Perrin, \u0027and I wonder at you, so I do.\u0027[208] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I thought it was such a good idea,\u0027 said poor Philip in gloom. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, the idea\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Mr. Perrin; \u0027there ain\u0027t nothing to complain of \u0027bout the idea.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Then what is wrong?\u0027 Philip asked impatiently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve come to the wrong shop,\u0027 said Mr. Perrin slowly. \u0027I ain\u0027t the man to take away another chap\u0027s job, not if he was to be in the humblest way of business; but when it comes to slapping the government in the face, well, there, Master Pip, I wouldn\u0027t have thought it of you. It\u0027s as much as my place is worth.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look here,\u0027 said Philip, stopping short in despair, \u0027will you tell me straight out why you won\u0027t help me?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not a-going to go building arks, at my time of life,\u0027 said Mr. Perrin. \u0027Mr. Noah\u0027d break his old heart, so he would, if I was to take on his job over his head.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, you mean I ought to ask him?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027\u0027Course you ought to ask him. I don\u0027t mind lending a hand under his directions, acting as foreman like, so as to make a good job of it. But it\u0027s him you must give your order to.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The parrot and the Hippogriff between them managed to get Mr. Noah to the castle by noon of the next day.[209] \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Would you have minded,\u0027 Philip immediately asked him, \u0027if I\u0027d had an ark built without asking you to do it?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Mr. Noah mildly, \u0027I might have been a little hurt. I have had some experience, you know, my Lord.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Why do you call me that?\u0027 Philip asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Because you are, of course. Your deed of slaying the lions counts one to you, and by virtue of it you are now a Baron. I congratulate you, Lord Leo,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \\n\\n \\n\\n He approved of Philip\u0027s idea, and he and Perrin were soon busy making plans, calculating strains and selecting materials. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Philip made a speech to the islanders and explained his idea. There was a great deal of cheering and shouting, and every one agreed that an ark on the topmost tower would meet a long-felt want, and that when once that ark was there, fear would for ever be a stranger to every gentle island heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now the great work of building began. Mr. Perrin kindly consented to act as foreman and set to work a whole army of workmen—the M.A.\u0027s of course. And soon the sound of saw and hammer mingled with the plash of waves and cries of sea-birds, and gangs of stalwart M.A.\u0027s in their seaweed tunics bent themselves to the task of shaping great timbers and[210] hoisting them to the top of the highest tower, where other gangs, under Mr. Noah\u0027s own eye, reared a scaffolding to support the ark while the building went on. \\n\\n \\n\\n The children were not allowed to help, but they loved looking on, and almost felt that, if they looked on earnestly enough, they must, in some strange mysterious way, be actually helping. You know the feeling, I daresay. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Hippogriff, who was stabled in the castle, flew up to wherever he was wanted, to assist in the hauling. Mr. Noah only had to whisper the magic word in his ear and up he flew. But what that magic word was the children did not know, though they asked often enough. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now at last the ark was finished, the scaffolding was removed, and there was the great Noah\u0027s ark, firmly planted on the topmost tower. It was a perfect example of the ark-builder\u0027s craft. Its boat part was painted a dull red, its sides and ends were blue with black windows, and its roof was bright scarlet, painted in lines to imitate tiles. No least detail was neglected. Even to the white bird painted on the roof, which you must have noticed in your own Noah\u0027s ark. \\n\\n They loved looking on. They loved looking on. \\n\\n \\n\\n [211]A great festival was held, speeches were made, and every one who had lent a hand in[213] the building, even the humblest M.A., was crowned with a wreath of fresh pink and green seaweed. Songs were sung, and the laureate of the Sea-Dwellers, a young M.A. with pale blue eyes and no chin, recited an ode beginning— \\n\\n Now that we have our Noble Ark \\n\\n No more we tremble in the dark \\n\\n When the great seas and the winds cry out, \\n\\n For we are safe without a doubt. \\n\\n \\n\\n At undue risings of the tide \\n\\n Within our Ark we\u0027ll safely hide, \\n\\n And bless the names of those who thus \\n\\n Have built a painted Ark for us. \\n\\n \\n\\n There were three hundred and seventeen more lines, very much like these, and every one said it was wonderful, and the laureate was a genius, and how did he do it, and what brains, eh? and things like that. \\n\\n \\n\\n And Philip and Lucy had crowns too. The Lord High Islander made a vote of thanks to Philip, who modestly replied that it was nothing, really, and anybody could have done it. And a spirit of gladness spread about among the company so that every one was smiling and shaking hands with everybody else, and even the M.A.\u0027s were making little polite old jokes, and slapping each other on the back and calling each other \u0027old chap,\u0027 which was[214] not at all their habit in ordinary life. The whole castle was decorated with garlands of pink and green seaweed like the wreaths that people were wearing, and the whole scene was the gayest and happiest you can imagine. \\n\\n \\n\\n And then the dreadful thing happened. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip and Lucy were standing in their seaweed tunics, for of course they had, since the first day, worn the costume of the country, on the platform in the courtyard. Mr. Noah had just said, \u0027Well, then, we will enjoy this enjoyable day to the very end and return to the city to-morrow,\u0027 when a shadow fell on the group. It was the Hippogriff, and on its back was—some one. Before any one could see who that some one was, the Hippogriff had flown low enough for that some one to catch Philip by his seaweed tunic and to swing him off his feet and on to the Hippogriff\u0027s back. Lucy screamed, Mr. Perrin said, \u0027Here, I say, none of that,\u0027 and Mr. Noah said, \u0027Dear me!\u0027 And they all reached out their hands to pull Philip back. But they were all too late. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I won\u0027t go. Put me down,\u0027 Philip shouted. They all heard that. And also they heard the answer of the person on the Hippogriff—the person who had snatched Philip on to its back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, won\u0027t you, my Lord? We\u0027ll soon see about that,\u0027 the person said.[215] \\n\\n \\n\\n Three people there knew that voice, four counting Philip, six counting the dogs. The dogs barked and growled, Mr. Noah said \u0027drop it;\u0027 and Lucy screamed, \u0027Oh no! oh no! it\u0027s that Pretenderette.\u0027 The parrot, with great presence of mind, flew up into the air and attacked the ear of the Pretenderette, for, as old books say, it was indeed that unprincipled character who had broken from prison and once more stolen the Hippogriff. But the Pretenderette was not to be caught twice by the same parrot. She was ready for the bird this time, and as it touched her ear she caught it in her motor veil which she must have loosened beforehand, and thrust it into a wicker cage that hung ready from the saddle of the Hippogriff who hovered on his wide white wings above the crowd of faces upturned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now we shall see her face,\u0027 Lucy thought, for she could not get rid of the feeling that if she could only see the Pretenderette\u0027s face she would recognise it. But the Pretenderette was too wily to look down unveiled. She turned her face up, and she must have whispered the magic word, for the Hippogriff rose in the air and began to fly away with incredible swiftness across the sea. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, what shall I do?\u0027 cried Lucy, wringing her hands. You have often heard of people[216] wringing their hands. Lucy, I assure you, really did wring hers. \u0027Oh! Mr. Noah, what will she do with him? Where will she take him? What shall I do? How can I find him again?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I deeply regret, my dear child,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027that I find myself quite unable to answer any single one of your questions.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But can\u0027t I go after him?\u0027 Lucy persisted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am sorry to say,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027that we have no boats; the Pretenderette has stolen our one and only Hippogriff, and none of our camels can fly.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But what can I do?\u0027 Lucy stamped her foot in her agony of impatience. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nothing, my child,\u0027 Mr. Noah aggravatingly replied, \u0027except to go to bed and get a good night\u0027s rest. To-morrow we will return to the city and see what can be done. We must consult the oracle.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But can\u0027t we go now,\u0027 said Lucy, crying. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No oracle is worth consulting till it\u0027s had its night\u0027s rest,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027It is a three days\u0027 journey. If we started now—see it is already dusk—we should arrive in the middle of the night. We will start early in the morning.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n But early in the morning there was no starting from the castle of the Dwellers by the Sea. There was indeed no one to start, and there was no castle to start from.[217] \\n\\n \\n\\n A young blugraiwee, peeping out of its hole after a rather disturbed night to see whether any human beings were yet stirring or whether it might venture out in search of yellow periwinkles, which are its favourite food, started, pricked its spotted ears, looked again, and, disdaining the cover of the rocks, walked boldly out across the beach. For the beach was deserted. There was no one there. No Mr. Noah, no Lucy, no gentle islanders, no M.A.\u0027s—and what is more there were no huts and there was no castle. All was smooth, plain, bare sea-combed beach. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the sea had at last risen. The fear of the Dwellers had been justified. Whether the sea had been curious about the ark no one knows, no one will ever know. At any rate the sea had risen up and swept away from the beach every trace of the castle, the huts and the folk who had lived there. \\n\\n \\n\\n A bright parrot, with a streamer of motor veiling hanging to one claw, called suddenly from the clear air to the little blugraiwee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027 the parrot asked; \u0027where\u0027s everything got to?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said the little blugraiwee; \u0027these human things are always coming and going. Have some periwinkles? They\u0027re very fine this morning after the storm,\u0027 it said. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2055/58505.html","bookId":572,"book":{"id":572,"title":"The Magic City","description":"简介： Philip Haldane and his sister lived in a little red-roofed house in a little red-roofed town.
