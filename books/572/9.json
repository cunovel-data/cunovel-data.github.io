{"id":12312,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX ON THE \u0027LIGHTNING LOOSE\u0027","content":"\u0027But how did you get here?\u0027 said Philip in Helen\u0027s arms on the island. \n \n \u0027I just walked out at the other side of a dream,\u0027 she said; \u0027how could I not come, when the door was open and you wanted me so?\u0027 \n \n And Philip just said, \u0027Oh, Helen!\u0027 He could not find any other words, but Helen understood. She always did. \n \n \u0027Come,\u0027 she said, \u0027shall we go to your Palace or mine? I want my supper, and we\u0027ll have our own little blue-and-white tea-set. Yes, I know you\u0027ve had your supper, but it\u0027ll be fun getting mine, and perhaps you\u0027ll be hungry again before we\u0027ve got it.\u0027 \n \n They went to the thatched cottage that was Helen\u0027s palace, because Philip had had almost as much of large buildings as he wanted for a little while. The cottage had a wide chimney[246] and an open hearth; and they sat on the hearth and made toast, and Philip almost forgot that he had ever had any adventures and that the toast was being made on a hearth whose blue wood-smoke curled up among the enchanting tree-tops of a magic island. \n \n And before they went to bed he had told her all about everything. \n \n \u0027Oh, I am so glad you came!\u0027 he said over and over again; \u0027it is so easy to tell you here, with all the magic going on. I don\u0027t think I ever could have told you at the Grange with the servants all about, and the—I mean Mr. Graham, and all the things as not magic as they could possibly be. Oh, Helen! where is Mr. Graham; won\u0027t he hate your coming away from him?\u0027 \n \n \u0027He\u0027s gone through a dream door too,\u0027 she said, \u0027to see Lucy. Only he doesn\u0027t know he\u0027s really gone. He\u0027ll think it\u0027s a dream, and he\u0027ll tell me about it when we both wake up.\u0027 \n \n \u0027When did you go to sleep?\u0027 said Philip. \n \n \u0027At Brussels. That telegram hasn\u0027t come yet.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t understand about time,\u0027 said Philip firmly, \u0027and I never shall. I say, Helen, I was just looking for the Lightning Loose, to go off in her on a voyage of discovery and find Lucy.\u0027[247] \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t think you need,\u0027 she said; \u0027I met a parrot on the island just before I met you and it was saying poetry to itself.\u0027 \n \n \u0027It would be,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027if it was alive. I\u0027m glad it is alive, though. What was it saying?\u0027 \n \n \u0027It was something like this,\u0027 she said, putting a log of wood on the fire: \n \u0027Philip and Helen \n Have the island to dwell in, \n Hooray. \n They said of the island, \n \"It\u0027s your land and my land!\" \n Hooray. Hooray. Hooray. \n \n \u0027And till the ark \n Comes out of the dark \n There those two may stay \n For a happy while, and \n Enjoy their island \n Until the Giving Day. \n Hooray. \n \n \u0027And then they will hear the giving voice, \n They will hear and obey, \n And when people come \n Who need a home, \n They\u0027ll give the island away. \n Hooray. \n \n \u0027The island with flower \n And fruit and bower, \n Forest and river and bay, \n Their very own island \n They\u0027ll sigh and smile and \n They\u0027ll give their island away.\u0027 \n \n [248] \n \n \u0027What nonsense!\u0027 said Philip, \u0027I never will.\u0027 \n \n \u0027All right, my Pipkin,\u0027 said Helen cheerfully; \u0027I only told you just to show that you\u0027re expected to stay here. \"Philip and Helen have the island to dwell in.\" And now, what about bed?\u0027 \n \n They spent a whole week on the island. It was exactly all that they could wish an island to be; because, of course, they had made it themselves, and of course they knew exactly what they wanted. I can\u0027t describe that week. I only know that Philip will never forget it. Just think of all the things you could do on a magic island if you were there with your dearest dear, and you\u0027ll know how Philip spent his time. \n \n He enjoyed every minute of every hour of every day, and, best thing of all, that week made him understand, as nothing else could have done, that Helen still belonged to him, and that her marriage to Mr. Graham had not made her any the less Philip\u0027s very own Helen. \n \n And then came a day when Philip, swinging in a magnolia tree, looked out to sea and cried out, \u0027A sail! a sail! Oh, Helen, here\u0027s the ark! Now it\u0027s all over. Let\u0027s have Lucy to stay with us, and send the other people away,\u0027[249] he added, sliding down the tree-trunk with his face very serious. \n \n \u0027But we can\u0027t, dear,\u0027 Helen reminded him. \u0027The island\u0027s ours, you know; and as long as it\u0027s ours no one else can land on it. We made it like that, you know.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Then they can\u0027t land?\u0027 \n \n \u0027No,\u0027 said Helen. \n \n \u0027Can\u0027t we change the rule and let them land?\u0027 \n \n \u0027No,\u0027 said Helen. \n \n \u0027Oh, it is a pity,\u0027 Philip said; \u0027because the island is the place for islanders, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Helen, \u0027and there\u0027s no fear of the sea here; you remember we made it like that when we made the island?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027Oh, Helen, I don\u0027t want to.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Then don\u0027t,\u0027 said Helen. \n \n \u0027Ah, but I do want to, too.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Then do,\u0027 said she. \n \n \u0027But don\u0027t you see, when you want to and don\u0027t want to at the same time, what are you to do? There are so many things to think of.\u0027 \n \n \u0027When it\u0027s like that, there\u0027s one thing you mustn\u0027t think of,\u0027 she said. \n \n \u0027What?\u0027 Philip asked. \n \n \u0027Yourself,\u0027 she said softly. \n \n There was a silence, and then Philip suddenly hugged his sister and she hugged him.[250] \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll give it to them,\u0027 he said; \u0027it\u0027s no use. I know I ought to. I shall only be uncomfortable if I don\u0027t.\u0027 \n \n Helen laughed. \u0027My boy of boys!\u0027 she said. And then she looked sad. \u0027Boy of my heart,\u0027 she said, \u0027you know it\u0027s not only giving up our island. If we give it away I must go. It\u0027s the only place that there\u0027s a door into out of my dreams.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I can\u0027t let you go,\u0027 he said. \n \n \u0027But you\u0027ve got your deeds to do,\u0027 she said, \u0027and I can\u0027t help you in those. Lucy can help you, but I can\u0027t. You like Lucy now, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t mind her,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027but it\u0027s you I want, Helen.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Don\u0027t think about that,\u0027 she urged. \u0027Think what the islanders want. Think what it\u0027ll be to them to have the island, to live here always, safe from the fear!\u0027 \n \n \u0027There are three more deeds,\u0027 said Philip dismally; \u0027I don\u0027t think I shall ever want any more adventures as long as I live.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You\u0027ll always want them,\u0027 she said, laughing at him gently, \u0027always. And now let\u0027s do the thing handsomely and give them a splendid welcome. Give me a kiss and then we\u0027ll gather heaps of roses.\u0027 \n \n So they kissed each other. But Philip was[251] very unhappy indeed, though he felt that he was being rather noble and that Helen thought so too, which was naturally a great comfort. \n \n There had been a good deal more of this talk than I have set down. Philip and Helen had hardly had time to hang garlands of pink roses along the quayside where the Lightning Loose, that perfect yacht, lay at anchor, before the blunt prow of the ark bumped heavily against the quayside—and the two, dropping the rest of the roses, waved and smiled to the group on the ark\u0027s terrace. \n \n The first person to speak was Mr. Perrin, who shouted, \u0027Here we are again!\u0027 like a clown. \n \n Then Lucy said, \u0027We know we can\u0027t land, but the oracle said come and we came.\u0027 She leaned over the bulwark to whisper, \u0027Who\u0027s that perfect duck you\u0027ve got with you?\u0027 \n \n Philip answered aloud: \n \n \u0027This is my sister Helen—Helen this is Lucy.\u0027 \n \n The two looked at each other, and then Helen held out her hands and she and Lucy kissed each other. \n \n \u0027I knew I should like you,\u0027 Lucy whispered, \u0027but I didn\u0027t know I should like you quite so much.\u0027 \n \n Mr. Noah and Mr. Perrin were both bow[252]ing to Helen, a little stiffly but very cordially all the same, and quite surprisingly without surprise. And the Lord High Islander was looking at her with his own friendly jolly schoolboy grin. \n \n \u0027If you will embark,\u0027 said Mr. Noah politely, \u0027we can return to the mainland, and I will explain to you your remaining deeds.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Tell them, Pip,\u0027 said Helen. \n \n \u0027We don\u0027t want to embark—at present,\u0027 said Philip shyly. \u0027We want you to land.\u0027 \n \n \u0027No one may land on the island save two,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027I am glad you are the two. I feared one of the two might be the Pretenderette.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Not much,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027It\u0027s Helen\u0027s and mine. We made it. And we want to give it to the islanders to keep. For their very own,\u0027 he added, feeling that it would be difficult for any one to believe that such a glorious present was really being made just like that, without speeches, as if it had been a little present of a pencil sharpener or a peg-top. \n \n He was right. \n \n \u0027To keep?\u0027 said the Lord High Islander; \u0027for our very own? Always?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027And there\u0027s no fear here. You\u0027ll really be \"happy troops\" now.\u0027 \n \n For a moment nobody said anything, though[253] all the faces were expressive. Then the Lord High Islander spoke. \n \n \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, \u0027of all the brickish bricks——\u0027 and could say no more. \n \n \u0027There are lots of houses,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027and room for all the animals, and the island is thirty miles round, so there\u0027s lots of room for the animals and everything.\u0027 He felt happier than he had ever done in his life. Giving presents is always enjoyable, and this was such a big and beautiful present, and he loved it so. \n \n \u0027I always did say Master Pip was a gentleman, and I always shall,\u0027 Mr. Perrin remarked. \n \n \u0027I congratulate you,\u0027 said Mr. Noah, \u0027and I am happy to announce that your fifth deed is now accomplished. You remember our empty silver fruit-dishes? Your fifth deed was to be the supplying of Polistarchia with fruit. This island is the only place in the kingdom where fruit grows. The ark will serve to convey the fruit to the mainland, and the performance of this deed raises you to the rank of Duke.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Philip, you\u0027re a dear,\u0027 said Lucy in a whisper. \n \n \u0027Shut up,\u0027 said Philip fiercely. \n \n \u0027Three cheers,\u0027 said a familiar voice, \u0027for the Duke of Donors.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Three cheers,\u0027 repeated the Lord High Islander, \u0027for the Duke of Donors.\u0027[254] \n \n What a cheer! All the islanders cheered and the M.A.\u0027s and Lucy and Mr. Perrin and Mr. Noah, and from the inside of the ark came enthusiastic barkings and gruntings and roarings and squeakings—as the animals of course joined in as well as they could. Thousands of gulls, circling on white wings in the sun above, added their screams to the general chorus. And when the sound of the last cheer died away, a little near familiar voice said: \n \n \u0027Well done, Philip! I\u0027m proud of you.\u0027 \n \n It was the parrot who, perched on the rigging of the Lightning Loose, had started the cheering. \n \n \u0027So that\u0027s all right,\u0027 it said, fluttered on to Philip\u0027s shoulder and added, \u0027I\u0027ve heard you calling for me on the island all the week. But I felt I needed a rest. I\u0027ve been talking too much. And that Pretenderette. And that cage. I assure you I needed a little time to get over my adventures.\u0027 \n \n \u0027We have all had our adventures,\u0027 said Mr. Noah gently. And Helen said: \n \n \u0027Won\u0027t you land and take possession of the island? I\u0027m sure we are longing to hear each other\u0027s adventures.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You first,\u0027 said Mr. Noah to the Lord High Islander, who stepped ashore very gravely.[255] \n \n When Helen saw him come forward, she suddenly kissed Philip, and as the Lord High Islander\u0027s foot touched the shore of that enchanted island, she simply and suddenly vanished. \n \n \u0027Oh!\u0027 cried Philip, \u0027I wish I hadn\u0027t.\u0027 And his mouth trembled as girls\u0027 mouths do if they are going to cry. \n \n \u0027The more a present costs you, the more it\u0027s worth,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027This has cost you so much, it\u0027s the most splendid present in the world.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I know,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027make yourselves at home, won\u0027t you?\u0027 he just managed to say. And then he found he could not say any more. He just turned and went into the forest. And when he was alone in a green glade, he flung himself down on his face and lay a long time without moving. It had been such a happy week. And he was so tired of adventures. \n \n When at last he sniffed with an air of finality and raised his head, the first thing he saw was Lucy, sitting quite still with her back to him. \n \n \u0027Hullo!\u0027 he said rather crossly, \u0027what are you doing here?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Saying the multiplication table,\u0027 said Lucy promptly and turned her head, \u0027so as not even to think about you. And I haven\u0027t even once[256] turned round. I knew you wanted to be alone. But I wanted to be here when you\u0027d done being alone. See? I\u0027ve got something to say to you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Fire ahead,\u0027 said Philip, still grumpy. \n \n \u0027I think you\u0027re perfectly splendid,\u0027 said Lucy very seriously, \u0027and I want it to be real pax for ever. And I\u0027ll help you in the rest of the adventures. And if you\u0027re cross, I\u0027ll try not to mind. Napoleon was cross sometimes, I believe,\u0027 she added pensively, \u0027and Julius Caesar.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, that\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Philip very awkwardly. \n \n \u0027Then we\u0027re going to be real chums?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh yes, if you like. Only—I don\u0027t mind just this once; and it was decent of you to come and sit there with your back to me—only I hate gas.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Lucy obediently, \u0027I know. Only sometimes you feel you must gas a little or burst of admiration. And I\u0027ve got your proper clothes in a bundle. I\u0027ve been carrying them about ever since the islanders\u0027 castle was washed away. Here they are.\u0027 \n \n She produced the bundle. And this time Philip was really touched. \n \n \u0027Now I do call that something like,\u0027 he said. \u0027The seaweed dress is all right here, but you[257] never know what you may have to go through when you\u0027re doing adventures. There might be thorns or snakes or anything. I\u0027m jolly glad to get my boots back too. I say, come on. Let\u0027s go to Helen\u0027s palace and get a banquet ready. I know there\u0027ll have to be a banquet. There always is, here. I know a first-rate bun-tree quite near here.\u0027 \n \n \u0027The cocoa-nut-ice plants looked beautiful as I came along,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027What a lovely island it is. And you made it!\u0027 \n \n \u0027No gas,\u0027 said Philip warningly. \u0027Helen and I made it.\u0027 \n \n \u0027She\u0027s the dearest darling,\u0027 said Lucy. \n \n \u0027Oh, well,\u0027 said Philip with resignation, \u0027if you must gas, gas about her.\u0027 \n \n The banquet was all that you can imagine of interesting and magnificent. And Philip was, of course, the hero of the hour. And when the banquet was finished and the last guest had departed to its own house—for the houses on the island were of course all ready to be occupied, furnished to the last point of comfort, with pin-cushions full of pins in every room, Mr. Noah and Lucy and Philip sat down on the terrace steps among the pink roses for a last little talk. \n \n \u0027Because,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027we shall start the first thing in the morning. So please will you[258] tell me now what the next deed is that I have to do?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Will you go by ark?\u0027 Mr. Noah asked, rolling up his yellow mat to make an elbow rest and leaning on it; \u0027I shall be delighted.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I thought,\u0027 said Philip, \u0027we might go in the Lightning Loose. I\u0027ve never sailed her yet, you know. Do you think I could?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Of course you can,\u0027 said Mr. Noah; \u0027and if not, Lucy can show you. Your charming yacht is steered on precisely the same principle as the ark. And in this land all the winds are favourable. You will find the yacht suitably provisioned. And I may add that you can go most of the way to your next deed by water—first the sea and then the river.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And what,\u0027 asked Philip, \u0027is the next deed?\u0027 \n \n \u0027In the extreme north of Polistarchia,\u0027 said Mr. Noah instructively, \u0027lies a town called Somnolentia. It used to be called Briskford in happier days. A river then ran through the town, a rapid river that brought much gold from the mountains. The people used to work very hard to keep the channel clear of the lumps of gold which continually threatened to choke it. Their fields were then well-watered and fruitful, and the inhabitants were cheerful and happy. But when the Hippogriff was let[259] out of the book, a Great Sloth got out too. Evading all efforts to secure him, the Great Sloth journeyed northward. He is a very large and striking animal, and by some means, either fear or admiration, he obtained a complete ascendancy over the inhabitants of Briskford. He induced them to build him a temple of solid gold, and while they were doing this the river bed became choked up and the stream was diverted into another channel far from the town. Since then the place is fallen into decay. The fields are parched and untilled. Such water as the people need for drinking is drawn by great labour from a well. Washing has become shockingly infrequent.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Are we to teach the dirty chaps to wash?\u0027 asked Philip in disgust. \n \n \u0027Do not interrupt,\u0027 said Mr. Noah. \u0027You destroy the thread of my narrative. Where was I?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Washing infrequent,\u0027 said Lucy; \u0027but if the fields are dried up, what do they live on?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Pine-apples,\u0027 replied Mr. Noah, \u0027which grow freely and do not need much water. Gathering these is the sole industry of this degraded people. Pine-apples are not considered a fruit but a vegetable,\u0027 he added hastily, seeing another question trembling on Philip\u0027s lips. \u0027Whatever of their waking time[260] can be spared from the gathering and eating of the pine-apples is spent in singing choric songs in honour of the Great Sloth. And even this time is short, for such is his influence on the Somnolentians that when he sleeps they sleep too, and,\u0027 added Mr. Noah impressively, \u0027he sleeps almost all the time. Your deed is to devise some means of keeping the Great Sloth awake and busy. And I think you\u0027ve got your work cut out. When you\u0027ve disposed of the Great Sloth you can report yourself to me here. I shall remain here for some little time. I need a holiday. The parrot will accompany you. It knows its way about as well as any bird in the land. Good-night. And good luck! You will excuse my not being down to breakfast.\u0027 \n \n And the next morning, dewy-early, Philip and Lucy and the parrot went aboard the yacht and loosed her from her moorings, and Lucy showed Philip how to steer, and the parrot sat on the mast and called out instructions. \n \n [261]They made for the mouth of a river. (\u0027I never built a river,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027No,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027it came out of the poetry book.\u0027) And when they were hungry they let down the anchor and went into the cabin for breakfast. And two people sprang to meet them,[263] almost knocking Lucy down with the violence of their welcome. The two people were Max and Brenda. \n He induced them to build him a temple of solid gold. He induced them to build him a temple of solid gold. \n \n \u0027Oh, you dear dogs,\u0027 Lucy cried, and Philip patted them, one with each hand, \u0027how did you get here?\u0027 \n \n \u0027It was a little surprise of Mr. Noah\u0027s,\u0027 said the parrot. \n \n Max and Brenda whined and barked and gushed. \n \n \u0027I wish we could understand what they\u0027re saying,\u0027 said Lucy. \n \n \u0027If you only knew the magic word that the Hippogriff obeys,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027you could say it, and then you\u0027d understand all animal talk. Only, of course, I mustn\u0027t tell it you. It\u0027s one of the eleven mysteries.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But I know it,\u0027 said Philip, and at once breathed the word in the tiny silky ear of Brenda and then in the longer silkier ear of Max, and instantly— \n \n \u0027Oh, my dears!\u0027 they heard Brenda say in a softly shrill excited voice; \u0027oh, my dearie dears! We are so pleased to see you. I\u0027m only a poor little faithful doggy; I\u0027m not clever, you know, but my affectionate nature makes me almost mad with joy to see my dear master and mistress again.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Very glad to see you, sir,\u0027 said Max with[264] heavy politeness. \u0027I hope you\u0027ll be comfortable here. There\u0027s no comfort for a dog like being with his master.\u0027 \n \n And with that he sat down and went to sleep, and the others had breakfast. It is rather fun cooking in yachts. And there was something new and charming in Brenda\u0027s delicate way of sitting up and begging and saying at the same time, \u0027I do hate to bother my darling master and mistress, but if you could spare another tiny bit of bacon—Oh, thank you, how good and generous you are!\u0027 \n \n They sailed the yacht successfully into the river which presently ran into the shadow of a tropical forest. Also out of a book. \n \n \u0027You might go on during the night,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027if the dogs would steer under my directions. You could tie one end of a rope to their collars and another to the helm. It\u0027s easier than turning spits.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Delighted!\u0027 said Max; \u0027only, of course, it\u0027s understood that we sleep through the day?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said everybody. So that was settled. And the children went to bed. \n \n It was in the middle of the night that the parrot roused Philip with his usual gentle beak-touch. Then— \n \n \u0027Wake up,\u0027 it said; \u0027this is not the right river. It\u0027s not the right direction. Nothing\u0027s[265] right. The ship\u0027s all wrong. I\u0027m very much afraid some one has been opening a book and this river has got out.\u0027 \n \n Philip hurried out on deck, and by the light of the lamps from the cabin, gazed out at the banks of the river. At least he looked for them. But there weren\u0027t any banks. Instead, steep and rugged cliffs rose on each side, and overhead, instead of a starry sky, was a great arched roof of a cavern glistening with moisture and dark as a raven\u0027s feathers. \n \n \u0027We must turn back,\u0027 said Philip. \u0027I don\u0027t like this at all.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Unfortunately,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027there is no room to turn back, and the Lightning Loose is not constructed for going backwards.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, dear,\u0027 whispered Brenda, \u0027I wish we hadn\u0027t come. Dear little dogs ought to be taken comfortable care of and not be sent out on nasty ships that can\u0027t turn back when it\u0027s dangerous.\u0027 \n \n \u0027My dear,\u0027 said Max with slow firmness, \u0027dear little dogs can\u0027t help themselves now. So they had better look out for chances of helping their masters.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But what can we do, then?\u0027 said Philip impatiently. \n \n \u0027I fear,\u0027 said the parrot, \u0027that we can do nothing but go straight on. If this river is in[266] a book it will come out somewhere. No river in a book ever runs underground and stays there.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I shan\u0027t wake Lucy,\u0027 said Philip; \u0027she might be frightened.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You needn\u0027t,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027she\u0027s awake, and she\u0027s no more frightened than you are.\u0027 \n \n (\u0027You hear that,\u0027 said Max to Brenda; \u0027you take example by her, my dear!\u0027) \n \n \u0027But if we are going the wrong way, we shan\u0027t reach the Great Sloth,\u0027 Lucy went on. \n \n \u0027Sooner or later, one way or another, we shall come to him,\u0027 said the parrot; \u0027and time is of no importance to a Great Sloth.\u0027 \n \n It was now very cold, and our travellers were glad to wrap themselves in the flags of all nations with which the yacht was handsomely provided. Philip made a sort of tabard of the union Jack and the old Royal Arms of England, with the lilies and leopards; and Lucy wore the Japanese flag as a shawl. She said the picture of the sun on it made her feel warm. But Philip shivered under his complicated crosses and lions, as the Lightning Loose swept on over the dark tide between the dark walls and under the dark roof of the cavern. \n \n \u0027Cheer up,\u0027 said the parrot. \u0027Think what a lot of adventures you\u0027re having that no one else has ever had: think what a lot of things[267] you\u0027ll have to tell the other boys when you go to school.\u0027 \n \n \u0027The other boys wouldn\u0027t believe a word of it,\u0027 said Philip in gloom. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t unless I knew it was true.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What I think is,\u0027 said Lucy, watching the yellow light from the lamps rushing ahead along the roof, \u0027that we shan\u0027t want to tell people. It\u0027ll be just enough to know it ourselves and talk about it, just Philip and me together.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Well, as to that——\u0027 the parrot was beginning doubtfully, when he broke off to exclaim: \n \n \u0027Do my claws deceive me or is there a curious vibration, and noticeable acceleration of velocity?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Eh?\u0027 said Philip, which is not manners, and he knew it. \n \n \u0027He means,\u0027 said Max stolidly, \u0027aren\u0027t we going rather fast and rather wobbly?\u0027 \n \n We certainly were. The Lightning Loose was going faster and faster along that subterranean channel, and every now and then gave a lurch and a shiver. \n \n \u0027Oh!\u0027 whined Brenda; \u0027this is a dreadful place for dear little dogs!\u0027 \n \n \u0027Philip!\u0027 said Lucy in a low voice, \u0027I know something is going to happen. Something dreadful. We are friends, aren\u0027t we?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Philip firmly.[268] \n \n \u0027Then I wish you\u0027d kiss me.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I can like you just as much without that,\u0027 said Philip uneasily. \u0027Kissing people—it\u0027s silly, don\u0027t you think?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Nobody\u0027s kissed me since daddy went away,\u0027 she said, \u0027except Helen. And you don\u0027t mind kissing Helen. She said you were going to adopt me for your sister.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh! all right,\u0027 said Philip, and put his arm round her and kissed her. She felt so little and helpless and bony in his arm that he suddenly felt sorry for her, kissed her again more kindly and then, withdrawing his arm, thumped her hearteningly on the back. \n Plunged headlong over the edge. Plunged headlong over the edge. \n \n \u0027Be a man,\u0027 he said in tones of comradeship and encouragement. \u0027I\u0027m perfectly certain nothing\u0027s going to happen. We\u0027re just going through a tunnel, and presently we shall just come out into the open air again, with the sky and the stars going on as usual.\u0027 \n \n He spoke this standing on the prow beside Lucy, and as he spoke she clutched his arm. \n \n \u0027Oh, look,\u0027 she breathed, \u0027oh, listen!\u0027 \n \n [269]He listened. And he heard a dull echoing roar that got louder and louder. And he looked. The light of the lamps shone ahead on the dark gleaming water, and then quite suddenly it did not shine on the water because there was no longer any water for it to shine[271] on. Only great empty black darkness. A great hole, ahead, into which the stream poured itself. And now they were at the edge of the gulf. The Lightning Loose gave a shudder and a bound and hung for what seemed a long moment on the edge of the precipice down which the underground river was pouring itself in a smooth sleek stream, rather like poured treacle, over what felt like the edge of everything solid. \n \n The moment ended, and the little yacht, with Philip and Lucy and the parrot and the two dogs, plunged headlong over the edge into the dark unknown abyss below. \n \n \u0027It\u0027s all right, Lu,\u0027 said Philip in that moment. \u0027I\u0027ll take care of you.\u0027 \n \n And then there was silence in the cavern—only the rushing sound of the great waterfall echoed in the rocky arch. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2055/58507.html","bookId":572,"book":{"id":572,"title":"The Magic City","description":"简介： Philip Haldane and his sister lived in a little red-roofed house in a little red-roofed town.
