When all things repose, do you alone Awake to hear the sweet harps play To Love before him on his way, And the night wind answering in antiphon Till night is overgone? Play on, invisible harps, unto Love, Whose way in heaven is aglow At that hour when soft lights come and go, Soft sweet music in the air above And in the earth below. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3264/89348.html","bookId":561,"book":{"id":561,"title":"Chamber Music","description":"简介： Strings in the earth and airMake music sweet;Strings by the river whereThe willows meet....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:57 AM"}}
