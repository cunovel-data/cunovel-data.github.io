What are you doing tonight?\" \"Tonight?\" \"Tonight. Why don\u0027t you join us for dinner? We\u0027ll drink some champagne, have a few laughs. Tomorrow\u0027s for business but there\u0027s no reason we can\u0027t be social tonight.\" \"I can\u0027t.\" \"Why not?\" \"I have plans made.\" \"Cancel them! What\u0027s so important you can\u0027t reschedule it, eh?\" \"I have to go to an AA meeting.\" He laughed long and hard. \"Oh, that\u0027s marvelous,\" he said. \"Yes, now that you mention it, we all have plans. Olga\u0027s chaperoning a CYO dance and I have to go to, uh-\" \"The Boy Scout Council,\" I suggested. \"That\u0027s it exactly, the annual award dinner of the Boy Scout Area Council. They\u0027re going to give me a merit badge for buggery, it\u0027s one of the most sought-after awards. You\u0027re a funny man, Scudder. You\u0027re costing me a great deal of money, but at least I get a few laughs out of it.\" AFTER I got off the phone with Stettner I called a car rental agency in the neighborhood and reserved a car. I didn\u0027t pick it up right away but walked instead to Coliseum Books, where I picked up a Hagstrom map of Queens. On my way out of the bookstore I realized I was just down the street from the gallery where I\u0027d left the original Ray Galindez sketches for framing. They had done a nice job, and as I looked at the pencil drawings behind their shield of non-glare glass I tried to see them purely as art. I wasn\u0027t entirely successful. I kept seeing two dead boys and the man who killed them. They wrapped them for me and I paid with my credit card and carried the package back to my hotel. I stowed it in the closet and spent a few minutes studying the map of Queens. I went out for a sandwich and a cup of coffee and read a newspaper, then came back and looked at the map some more. Around seven I walked over to the car-rental place and used my credit card again, and they put me behind the wheel of a gray Toyota Corolla with sixty-two hundred miles on the clock. The gas tank was full and the ashtrays were empty, but whoever had vacuumed the interior had done a less than perfect job. I had the map with me but I got there without referring to it, taking the Midtown Tunnel and the Long Island Expressway and exiting just after the BQE interchange. There was some traffic on the LIE but not too much of it, with most of the commuters in front of their television sets by now. I cruised around the area, and when I reached the New Maspeth Arena I circled the block slowly once and found a place to park. I sat there for an hour or more like a lazy old cop on a stakeout. At one point I had to take a leak, and I hadn\u0027t brought along an empty quart jar, the way I\u0027d learned to do years ago. The fact that the neighborhood was deserted and I hadn\u0027t seen a soul in the past half hour made me positively reckless, and I drove two blocks and got out of the car to pee with abandon against a brick wall. I went around the block and parked in another spot across the street from the arena. The whole street was a car owner\u0027s dream, just one empty parking space after another. Around nine or a little past it I left the Toyota and walked over to the arena. I took my time, paying close attention, and when I got back in the car I got out my notebook and made some sketches. I had the dome light on, but not for very long. At ten I took a different route and drove back to the city. The kid at the garage said he had to charge me for a full day. \"Might as well keep her overnight,\" he said. \"Bring her back tomorrow afternoon, won\u0027t cost you a nickel more.\" I told him I had no further use for it. The garage was on Eleventh Avenue between Fifty-seventh and Fifty-eighth. I walked a block east, then south. I checked at Armstrong\u0027s but didn\u0027t see anyone I recognized, and just for the hell of it I looked in the door of Pete\u0027s All-American to see if Durkin was there. He wasn\u0027t. I\u0027d spoken to him a few days earlier, and he\u0027d said he hoped he hadn\u0027t said anything out of line. I\u0027d assured him he was a perfect gentleman. \"Then that\u0027s a first for me,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t make a habit of it, but once in a while a man has to go and let the devil out.\" I told him I knew what he meant. MICK wasn\u0027t at Grogan\u0027s. \"He\u0027ll probably be in later,\" Burke said. \"Sometime between now and closing.\" I sat at the bar with a Coke, and when I\u0027d finished it I switched to club soda. After a while Andy Buckley came in and Burke drew him a pint of the draft Guinness, and Andy took the stool next to mine and talked about basketball. I used to follow the game but I haven\u0027t paid much attention to it in the past few years. That was all right because he was prepared to carry the whole conversation himself. He had gone to the Garden the night before and the Knicks had covered the spread with a three-pointer at the buzzer, winning his bet for him in the process. I let him talk me into a game of darts, but I wasn\u0027t fool enough to bet with him. He could have played left-handed and beat me. We played a second game, and then I went back to the bar and drank another Coke and watched television and Andy stayed at the dart board sharpening his game. At one point I thought about going to the midnight meeting. When I first got sober there was a meeting every night at twelve at the Moravian church at Lexington and Thirtieth. Then they lost the meeting place and the group moved to Alanon House, an AA clubhouse that has had various locations in the theater district and is currently housed in a third-floor apartment on West Forty-sixth. At one point Alanon House was between locations, and some people started a new midnight meeting downtown on Houston Street near Varick, where the Village butts up against SoHo. The downtown group has added other meetings, including an insomniac\u0027s special every morning at two. So I had a choice of midnight meetings, and I could tell Burke to let Mick know I was looking for him, and that I\u0027d be back by one-thirty at the latest. But something stopped me, something kept me on my stool and led me to order another Coke when my glass was empty. I was in the john when Mick finally showed up a little before one. When I emerged he was at the bar with his bottle of JJ\u0026S and his Waterford tumbler. \"Good man,\" he said. \"Burke told me you were here and I said he should put on a pot of coffee. I hope you\u0027re up for a long night.\" \"Just a short night tonight,\" I said. \"Ah, well,\" he said. \"Maybe I can get you to change your mind.\" We sat at our usual table and he filled his glass and held it to the light. \"By God that\u0027s a good color,\" he said, and he took a drink. \"If you ever quit drinking,\" I said, \"they make a cream soda that\u0027s just about the same shade.\" \"Is that a fact?\" \"Of course you\u0027d have to let it go flat,\" I said, \"or it\u0027d have a head on it.\" \"Spoil the effect, wouldn\u0027t it?\" He took a drink and sighed. \"Cream soda indeed,\" he said. We talked about nothing much, and then I leaned forward and said, \"Do you still need money, Mick?\" \"I\u0027ve not got holes in my shoes,\" he said. \"No.\" \"But I always need money. I told you that the other night.\" \"You did.\" \"Why?\" \"I know where you can get some,\" I said. \"Ah,\" he said. He sat in silence for a moment, and a slight smile came and went, came and went. \"How much money?\" \"A minimum of fifty thousand. Probably a lot more than that.\" \"Whose money?\" A good question. Joe Durkin had reminded me that money knows no owner. It was, he\u0027d said, a principle of law. \"A couple named Stettner,\" I said. \"Drug dealers?\" \"Close. He deals in currencies, launders money for a pair of Iranian brothers from Los Angeles.\" \"Eye-ranians,\" he said, with relish. \"Well, now. Maybe you should tell me more.\" I must have talked for twenty minutes. I took out my notebook and showed him the sketches I\u0027d made in Maspeth. There wasn\u0027t that much to tell, but he took me back over various points, covering everything thoroughly. He didn\u0027t say anything for a minute or two, and then he filled his glass with whiskey and drank it down as if it were cool water on a hot afternoon. \"Tomorrow night,\" he said. \"Four men, I\u0027d say. Two men and myself, and Andy for the driving. Tom would do for one of them, and either Eddie or John. You know Tom. You don\u0027t know Eddie or John.\" Tom was the day bartender, a pale tight-lipped man from Belfast. I\u0027d always wondered what he did with his evenings. \"Maspeth,\" he said. \"Can any good thing come out of Maspeth? By God, there we sat watching the niggers punching each other and all the time there\u0027s a money laundry beneath our feet. Is that why you went out there then? And brought me along for company?\" \"No, it was work took me out there, but I was working on something else at the time.\" \"But you kept your eyes open.\" \"You could say that.\" \"And put two and two together,\" he said. \"Well, it\u0027s just the kind of situation I can use. I don\u0027t mind telling you, you\u0027ve surprised me.\" \"How?\" \"By bringing this to me. It seems unlike you. It\u0027s more than a man does out of friendship.\" \"You pay a finder\u0027s fee,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t you?\" \"Ah,\" he said, and a curious light came into his eyes. \"That I do,\" he said. \"Five percent.\" He excused himself to make a phone call. While he was gone I sat there and looked at the bottle and the glass. I could have had some of the coffee Burke had made but I didn\u0027t want any. I didn\u0027t want the booze either. When he came back I said, \"Five percent\u0027s not enough.\" \"Oh?\" His face hardened. \"By God, you\u0027re full of surprises tonight, aren\u0027t you? I thought I knew ye. What\u0027s the matter with five percent, and how much is it you think you ought to have?\" \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with five percent,\" I said. \"For a finder\u0027s fee. I don\u0027t want a finder\u0027s fee.\" \"You don\u0027t? Well, what in hell do you want?\" \"A full share,\" I said. \"I want to be a player. I want to go in.\" He sat back and looked at me. He poured a drink but didn\u0027t touch it, breathed in and breathed out and looked at me some more. \"Well, I\u0027ll be damned,\" he said finally. \"Well, I\u0027ll be fucking damned.\" Chapter 22 In the morning I finally got around to stowing The Dirty Dozen in my safe-deposit box. I bought an ordinary copy to take to Maspeth, then began to imagine some of the things that might go wrong. I returned to the bank and retrieved the genuine article, and I left the replacement cassette in the box so I wouldn\u0027t mix them up later on. If I got killed out in Maspeth, Joe Durkin could watch the cassette over and over, searching for a hidden meaning. All day long I kept thinking that I ought to go to a meeting. I hadn\u0027t been to one since Sunday night. I thought I\u0027d go at lunch hour but didn\u0027t, and then I thought about a Happy Hour meeting around five-thirty, and finally figured I\u0027d catch at least the first half of my usual meeting at St. Paul\u0027s. But I kept finding other things to do. At ten-thirty I walked over to Grogan\u0027s. Mick was there, and we went into his office in the back. There\u0027s an old wooden desk there, and a safe, along with a pair of old-fashioned wooden office chairs and a Naugahyde recliner. There\u0027s an old green leather sofa, too, and sometimes he\u0027ll catch a few hours on it. He told me once he has three apartments around town, each of them rented in a name other than his own, and of course he has the farm upstate.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-40.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
