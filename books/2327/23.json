{"id":63546,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\"We\u0027re not thinking of redecorating, Jon. This is about identification, not redoing the breakfast nook.\" Another man, his face wasted with AIDS, said, \"I\u0027ve seen this man. I\u0027ve seen him in here and I\u0027ve seen him on West Street. Maybe half a dozen times over the past two years. On a couple of occasions he was with a woman.\" \"What did she look like?\" \"Like a Doberman pinscher. Black leather from the toes up, high-heeled boots, and I think she was wearing spiked cuffs on her wrists.\" \"Probably his mother,\" someone said. \"They were definitely hunting,\" the man with AIDS said. \"They were on the prowl for a playmate. Did he kill those boys? Is that why you\u0027re looking for him?\" The question startled me into an unguarded response. \"One of them,\" I said. \"How did you know?\" \"They looked like killers,\" he said simply. \"I had that thought the first time I saw them together. She was Diana, goddess of the hunt. I don\u0027t know who he was.\" \"Cronus,\" I suggested. \"Cronus? Well, that would fit, wouldn\u0027t it, but it\u0027s not the thought I had. I remember he was wearing a floor-length leather coat and he looked like a Gestapo agent, somebody who\u0027d come knocking on your door at three in the morning. You know what I mean, you\u0027ve seen those movies.\" \"Yes.\" \"I thought, these two are killers, they\u0027re looking for someone to take home and kill. You\u0027re being silly, I told myself, but I was right, wasn\u0027t I?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"You were right.\" I took the subway to Columbus Circle and picked up the early edition of the Times on my way home. There were no messages at the desk and nothing interesting in the mail. I turned the TV on and watched the news on CNN and read the paper during the commercials. Somewhere along the way I got interested in a long article on drug gangs in Los Angeles and reached to switch off the television set. It was past midnight when the phone rang. A soft voice said, \"Matt, it\u0027s Gary at Paris Green. I don\u0027t know if you care, but the fellow you asked about the other night just walked in and took a seat at the bar. He might drink up and walk out the minute I hang up, but if I were guessing I\u0027d say he\u0027ll stay put for a while.\" I\u0027d taken my shoes off, but other than that I was ready to roll. I was tired, I\u0027d had a late night last night, but to hell with that. I said I\u0027d be right over. THE cab ride couldn\u0027t have taken more than five minutes, but before it was half over I was wondering what the hell I was doing. What was I going to do, watch the man drink and figure out if he was a killer? The absurdity of the whole thing became still more evident when I opened the door and went in. There were just two people in the whole place, Gary behind the bar and Richard Thurman in front of it. The kitchen was closed, and before they\u0027d left the waiters had put the chairs on top of the tables. Paris Green wasn\u0027t a late joint, and Gary usually closed down the bar around the time the waiters finished and went home. I had the feeling he was staying open tonight on my account, and I only wished there was more sense in it. Thurman turned at my approach. Some people barely show their drink. Mick Ballou is like that. He can take on a heavy load and the only outward sign of it is a slight hardening in the gaze of his green eyes. Richard Thurman was just the opposite. One look at him and I knew he\u0027d been making a night of it. It showed in the glassiness of the hard blue eyes, the suggestion of bloat in the lower part of the face, the softening around the pouty mouth. He nodded shortly and went back to his own drink. I couldn\u0027t see what it was. Something on the rocks, neither his usual light beer nor his pre-dinner martini. I picked a spot eight or ten feet down the bar from him and Gary brought me a glass of club soda without asking. \"Double vodka tonic,\" he said. \"Want this on your tab, Matt?\" It wasn\u0027t vodka and I didn\u0027t have a tab there. Gary was one of the few bartenders in the neighborhood who wasn\u0027t trying to make it as an actor or writer, but he had a head for drama all the same. \"That\u0027ll be fine,\" I told him, and I took a long drink of my soda water. \"That\u0027s a summer drink,\" Thurman said. \"I guess it is,\" I agreed. \"I got in the habit of drinking it year round.\" \"The Brits invented tonic. They colonized the tropics and started drinking it. You know why?\" \"To keep cool?\" \"As a malaria preventive. Preventative. You know what tonic is? What\u0027s another name for it?\" \"Quinine water?\" \"Very good. And you take quinine to prevent malaria. You worried about malaria? You see any mosquitoes?\" \"No.\" \"Then you\u0027re drinking the wrong drink.\" He raised his own glass. \" \u0027Claret for boys, port for men, and for heroes it\u0027s nothing but brandy.\u0027 You know who said that?\" \"Some drunk, it sounds like.\" \"Samuel Johnson, but you probably think he plays right field for the Mets.\" \"You\u0027re talking about Darryl Strawberry now. He a brandy drinker?\" \"Jesus Christ,\" Thurman said. \"What am I doing here? What the hell is the matter with me?\" He put his head in his hands. I said, \"Hey, cheer up. Is that brandy you\u0027re drinking?\" \"Brandy and cr–∏me de menthe. It\u0027s a stinger.\" No wonder he was shitfaced. \"A hero\u0027s drink,\" I said. \"Gary, give my father here another hero\u0027s drink.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Thurman said. \"Oh, come on,\" I said. \"You can handle one more.\" Gary brought him another stinger and set up another glass of soda for me, whisking away the one I\u0027d barely touched. Thurman and I raised our glasses at each other, and I said, \"Absent friends.\" \"Jesus,\" he said. \"Not that one.\" \"How\u0027s this, then? \u0027Here\u0027s to crime.\u0027 \" His shoulders drooped and he looked at me. His full lips were slightly parted. He looked as though he was about to say something, but then he changed his mind and took a long swallow of his drink. He made a face and shuddered a little as it went down. He said, \"You know me, don\u0027t you?\" \"Hell, we\u0027re practically old friends.\" \"I\u0027m serious. Don\u0027t you know who I am?\" I looked at him. \"Wait a minute,\" I said. He was waiting for me to recognize him from his picture in the papers. I let him wait another beat. Then I said, \"Maspeth Arena. The Thursday night fights. Am I right?\" \"I don\u0027t believe this.\" \"You were the cameraman. No, I\u0027m wrong. You were in the ring telling the cameraman what to do.\" \"I produce the telecast.\" \"On cable.\" \"Five Borough Cable, right. I don\u0027t believe this. We give the seats away and we can\u0027t get people to sit in them. Nobody even knows where Maspeth is. The only subway anywhere near there is the M and nobody in Manhattan can figure out where you go to catch it. If you saw me there, it\u0027s no wonder you recognized me. We were just about the only people there.\" \"Pretty good job,\" I said. \"You think so, huh?\" \"You get to watch the fights. Get to grab a pretty girl by the ass.\" \"Who, Chelsea? Just a tramp, my friend. Take my word for it.\" He downed some more of his stinger. \"What brought you out there? You a big fight fan, never miss a bout?\" \"I was working.\" \"You too, huh? What are you, a reporter? I thought I knew all the press guys.\" I gave him one of my cards, and when he pointed out that it had only my name and address I showed him the card I used when I worked for Wally, a business card for Reliable Investigations with their address and phone number and my name. \"You\u0027re a detective,\" he said. \"That\u0027s right.\" \"And you were working the other night when you came out to Maspeth.\" I nodded. \"What are you doing now? This all part of the job?\" \"This? Drinking and bullshitting? No, they don\u0027t pay me for this. I wish they did, I\u0027ll tell you.\" I had put the card from Reliable away, but I\u0027d let him keep the other and he was looking at it now. He read my name aloud and looked at me. He asked me if I knew his name. \"No,\" I said. \"How would I?\" \"It\u0027s Richard Thurman. Does that ring a bell?\" \"Just the obvious. Thurman Munson.\" \"I get that a lot.\" \"Yankees haven\u0027t been the same since the plane crash.\" \"Yeah, well, I haven\u0027t been the same myself. Since the crash.\" \"I don\u0027t follow you.\" \"Never mind. It\u0027s not important.\" He was silent for a moment. Then he said, \"You were starting to tell me what you were doing in Maspeth.\" \"Oh, you know.\" \"No, I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s why I\u0027m asking.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t be interested.\" \"Are you kidding? A private detective, everybody\u0027s fantasy job, of course I\u0027d be interested.\" He dropped a friendly hand onto my shoulder. \"What\u0027s the bartender\u0027s name?\" \"Gary.\" \"Hey, Gary, another stinger, another double vee-tee. So what brought you to Maspeth, Matt?\" \"You know,\" I said, \"the funny thing is you might be able to help.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"Well, you were there,\" I said. \"You might have seen him. He was right at ringside.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"The guy I was supposed to follow.\" I got out a copy of a sketch and made sure it was the right one. \"Here we go. He was sitting up front, had his son with him. I picked him up there the way I was supposed to and then I lost him. You happen to know who he is?\" He looked at the sketch and I looked at him. \"This is a drawing,\" he said after a moment. I agreed that it was. \"You do this? \u0027Raymond Galindez.\u0027 That\u0027s not you.\" \"No.\" \"Where\u0027d you get this?\" \"They gave it to me,\" I said. \"So I would recognize him.\" \"And you were supposed to follow him?\" \"Right. And I went to take a leak and when I got back he was gone. Him and the boy both, like they disappeared while my back was turned.\" \"Why were you following him?\" \"They don\u0027t tell me everything. Do you recognize him? Do you know who he is? He was right in the front row, you must have seen him.\" \"Who\u0027s your client? Who told you to follow him?\" \"I couldn\u0027t tell you that even if I knew. Confidentiality, it\u0027s everything in this business, you know.\" \"Hey, c\u0027mon,\" he said winningly. \"We\u0027re all alone here. Who\u0027m I gonna tell?\" \"I don\u0027t even know who the client is,\" I said, \"or why I was supposed to follow him. I caught hell for losing the sonofabitch, believe me.\" \"I can imagine.\" \"So do you recognize him? Do you know who he is?\" \"No,\" he said. \"I never saw him before.\" HE left shortly thereafter. I slipped out myself and crossed to the downtown side of the intersection so I could watch him walking toward Eighth Avenue. When he had a good lead I tagged along after him, just keeping him in sight. He went into his own building, and a few minutes later I saw the lights go on in the fourth-floor windows.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-23.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
