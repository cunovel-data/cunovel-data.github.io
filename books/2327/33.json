{"id":63556,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"I called my hotel to see if there had been any calls. There hadn\u0027t. I got Five Borough\u0027s number from Information and got a secretary who would tell me only that he was not in the office. She didn\u0027t know where he was or when he was expected back.\n I went back to Thurman\u0027s building and rang the bell of the travel agent on the second floor. The buzzer sounded immediately and I walked up a flight, waiting for someone to come out on the landing and challenge me. No one did. I went on up the stairs. The Gottschalks\u0027 door had been secured since the break-in, with the doorframe reinforced and the locks replaced. I climbed another flight to the fifth floor and listened at Thurman\u0027s door. I couldn\u0027t hear anything. I rang the bell and heard it sound within the apartment. I knocked on the door anyway. There was no response.\n I tried the door and it didn\u0027t budge. There were three locks, although there was no way to tell how many of them were engaged. Two had pickproof Medeco cylinders, and all were secured by escutcheon plates. An angle iron installed at the juncture of door and frame rendered the door secure against jimmying.\n I stopped at the two second-floor offices, the travel agent and the ticket broker, and asked if they\u0027d seen Richard Thurman that day, if by any chance he\u0027d left any sort of message with them. They hadn\u0027t and he hadn\u0027t. I asked the same question in Radicchio\u0027s and got the same answer. I went back to my post across the street, and at five o\u0027clock I called the Northwestern again and learned that I hadn\u0027t had any calls, from Thurman or from anyone else. I hung up and spent another quarter to call Durkin.\n \"He never showed,\" I said.\n \"Shit. What is he, an hour late?\"\n \"He hasn\u0027t tried to call me, either.\"\n \"The cocksucker\u0027s probably on his way to Brazil.\"\n \"No, that doesn\u0027t figure,\" I said. \"He\u0027s probably stuck in traffic or hung up with some client or sports promoter or sponsor.\"\n \"Or giving Mrs. Stettner a farewell hump.\"\n \"An hour\u0027s nothing. Remember, he hired me. I\u0027m working for him, so I suppose he can stand me up or run late without worrying that I\u0027m going to throw a fit. I know where he\u0027s going to be this evening. I was supposed to go out to Maspeth with him for the boxing telecast. I\u0027ll give him another hour or so and if he still doesn\u0027t show I\u0027ll look for him at the arena.\"\n \"You\u0027ll keep on wearing the wire.\"\n \"Sure. It won\u0027t start recording until I turn it on and I haven\u0027t done that yet.\"\n He thought it over. \"I guess that\u0027s okay,\" he said.\n \"Except there\u0027s one thing.\"\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\n \"I was wondering if you could send somebody over to open his apartment.\"\n \"Now?\"\n \"Why not? I don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to show in the next hour. If he does I\u0027ll cut him off downstairs, drag him someplace for a drink.\"\n \"What do you expect to find?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n After a short silence he said, \"No, I couldn\u0027t get a court order. What am I gonna tell a judge? He had an appointment with a guy and he didn\u0027t show so I wanta kick his door in? Besides, time it took to get a court order you\u0027d be out in Maspeth.\"\n \"Suppose you forget to get a court order.\"\n \"No way. Worst thing in the world. Say we find something, it\u0027s fruit of the poisoned tree. Could be a signed confession plus an eight-by-ten glossy of him strangling her and we couldn\u0027t do shit with it. It\u0027s not admissible because we got it through an unauthorized search and seizure.\" He sighed. \"Now if you were to go in on your own and I didn\u0027t know about it-\"\n \"I haven\u0027t got the skills. He\u0027s got pickproof cylinders. I could spend a week and not get in the door.\"\n \"Then forget it. It\u0027s his confession\u0027s gonna hang the bunch of them, not any evidence sitting in his apartment.\"\n I said what I\u0027d been thinking about. \"Suppose he\u0027s in there.\"\n \"Dead, you mean. Well, dead\u0027s dead, you know? If he\u0027s dead now he\u0027ll be just as dead tomorrow, and if you still haven\u0027t heard from him by then I\u0027ll have enough grounds to hunt up a judge and get in legally. Matt, if he\u0027s already dead he can\u0027t say anything to you that he can\u0027t say tomorrow.\" When I was silent he said, \"Tell me straight out. You were standing in front of his door. Did you get the sense that he was dead on the other side of it?\"\n \"Come on,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not a psychic.\"\n \"No, but you got cop instincts. How would you call it? Was he in there?\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"No, the place felt empty to me.\"\n BY six he still hadn\u0027t shown and I was tired of lurking in doorways. I called my hotel again, and while I was at it I wasted two more quarters on calls to Paris Green and Grogan\u0027s. Not surprisingly, he wasn\u0027t at either of those places.\n Three cabdrivers in a row made it clear that they weren\u0027t going to Maspeth. I went into the subway station at Fiftieth and Eighth and studied the map. The M would get me to Maspeth, but it seemed enormously complicated to get to it and I wouldn\u0027t know which way to walk when I got off it. Instead I took the E train two stops into Queens, getting off at Queens Plaza where I figured there would be taxis waiting. I got a driver who not only knew how to get to Maspeth but was able to find the arena. He pulled up in front of the entrance and I could see the FBCS vans parked where I\u0027d seen them a week ago.\n The sight was reassuring. I paid my cabby and walked over to the vans but didn\u0027t see Thurman. I bought a ticket and went through the turnstile and found a seat in the same spot where Mick and I had sat a week earlier. The first prelims were under way and a couple of listless middleweights were swinging at each other in the middle of the ring. I scanned the ringside seats of the center section, where I\u0027d seen Bergen Stettner. I didn\u0027t see him now, or the boy either.\n The four-rounder went to a decision. While the official was collecting the scorecards from the judges I went over to ringside and got the cameraman\u0027s attention. I asked him where Richard Thurman was.\n \"I don\u0027t know where the hell he is,\" he said. \"He supposed to be here tonight? Maybe he\u0027s in the truck.\"\n I went outside and nobody knew where Thurman was. One man watching the telecast on a monitor said he heard the producer was going to show up late, and another man said he had the impression Thurman wasn\u0027t coming in at all. Nobody seemed greatly concerned over his absence.\n I showed my stub and went through the turnstile again and returned to my seat. The next bout matched two local featherweights, a pair of scrappy young Hispanics. One was from nearby Woodside, and he got a big hand. They both threw a lot of punches but neither of them seemed capable of doing much damage, and the fight went six rounds to a decision. It went to the kid from Brooklyn, which seemed fair to me, but the crowd didn\u0027t like it.\n There were two eight-rounders scheduled before the ten-round main event. The first one didn\u0027t go any distance at all; the fighters were heavyweights, both carrying far too much flab, both given to telegraphing their punches. About a minute into the first round one of them missed with a roundhouse right, spun around full circle, and caught a left hook right on the button. He went down like a felled ox and they had to throw water on him to revive him. The crowd loved it.\n The fighters on the top of the undercard were in the ring waiting for the introduction when I glanced up the aisle toward the entrance. And there was Bergen Stettner.\n He wasn\u0027t wearing the Gestapo coat a few people had described, or the blazer I\u0027d seen him in last week. His jacket was suede, light brown in color, and beneath it he wore a dark brown shirt and a paisley ascot.\n He didn\u0027t have the boy with him.\n I watched as he chatted with another man a few yards from the turnstile. They finished the introductions, rang the opening bell. I went on watching Stettner. After another minute or two he clapped the other man on the shoulder and left the arena.\n I walked out after him, but when I got outside I didn\u0027t see him anywhere. I drifted over to where the FBCS vans were parked and looked around for Richard Thurman, but he wasn\u0027t there to be seen and I didn\u0027t really think he was coming. I stood in the shadows and saw Bergen Stettner come around the side of the building and approach the vans. He talked with someone inside the van for a minute, then returned in the direction he\u0027d come from.\n I waited a few minutes before approaching the van. I stuck my head in the back and said, \"Where the hell is Stettner? I can\u0027t find him anywhere.\"\n \"He was just here,\" the man said without turning around. \"You just missed him, he was here not five minutes ago.\"\n \"Shit,\" I said. \"Say, did he happen to say where Thurman went to?\"\n Now he turned. \"Oh, right,\" he said. \"You were looking for him earlier. No, Stettner wanted to know where he was, too. Looks like Thurman\u0027s gonna catch hell.\"\n \"You don\u0027t know the half of it,\" I said.\n I showed my stub and went through the turnstile again. They were in the fourth round now. I didn\u0027t know anything about the fighters, I\u0027d missed the introductions, and I didn\u0027t bother to reclaim my seat. I went over to the refreshment stand and got a Coke in a paper cup and stood in back drinking it. I looked around for Stettner but couldn\u0027t find him. I turned toward the entrance again and saw a woman, and for a second or two I thought she was Chelsea, the placard girl. I looked again and realized I was looking at Olga Stettner.\n She had her long hair pulled back off her face and done up in a sort of bun on the back of her head. I think it\u0027s called a chignon. The style accented her prominent cheekbones and gave her a severe look, but she probably would have looked fairly stern anyway. She was wearing a short jacket of some dark fur and a pair of suede boots that reached to the tops of her calves. I watched as she scanned the room. I didn\u0027t know who she was looking for, her husband or Thurman. She wasn\u0027t looking for me; her eyes passed right over me with no flicker of recognition.\n I wonder how I\u0027d have reacted to her if I hadn\u0027t known who she was. She was an attractive woman, certainly, but there was something about her, some magnetism, that may have owed a lot to what I already knew about her. And I knew too goddamned much about her. What I knew made it impossible to look at her, and impossible not to.\n BY the end of the fight they were both standing there, Bergen and Olga, looking out over the big room as if they owned it. The ring announcer gave the decision and each fighter in turn, along with a three- or four-man retinue, made his way from the ring to the stairwell off to the left of the entrance doors. After they\u0027d dropped from sight two other fighters emerged via the same set of basement stairs, fresh where the outgoing fighters had been spent, making their way in turn down the main aisle to the ring. They were middleweights and they had both had a good number of fights in the area. I knew them from the Garden. They were both black, both had won almost all of their bouts, and the shorter and darker of the two had knockout power in either hand. The other kid wasn\u0027t as strong a puncher but he was very quick and had a reach advantage. It figured to be a very good matchup.\n Like the previous week, they introduced a handful of boxing figures, including both scheduled participants in next week\u0027s main bout. A politician, the deputy borough president of Queens, got introduced and received a chorus of boos, which in turn sparked some laughter. Then they cleared the ring and introduced the fighters, and I glanced over at the Stettners and saw them making their way toward the stairs. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-33.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: \n A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
