{"id":63530,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Chapter 4 That evening I met Elaine Mardell in front of a theater on Forty-second Street west of Ninth Avenue. She was wearing tight jeans and square-toed boots and a black leather motorcycle jacket with zippered pockets. I told her she looked great. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"I was trying for off-Broadway, but I think I may have achieved off-off-Broadway.\" We had good seats down front, but the theater was too small to have any bad seats. I don\u0027t remember the title of the play, but it was about homelessness, and the playwright was against it. One of the actors, Harley Ziegler, was a regular at Keep It Simple, an AA group that meets evenings at St. Paul the Apostle, just a couple of blocks from my hotel. In the play Harley was a wino who lived in a cardboard packing case. He gave a convincing performance, and why not? A few years ago he\u0027d been playing the role in real life. We went backstage afterward to congratulate Harley and ran into half a dozen other people I knew from meetings. They invited us to join them for coffee. Instead we walked ten blocks up Ninth to Paris Green, a restaurant we both liked. I had the swordfish steak and Elaine ordered linguini al pesto. \"I don\u0027t know about you,\" I said. \"It seems to me you wear a lot of leather for a heterosexual vegetarian.\" \"It\u0027s one of those wacky little inconsistencies wherein lies the secret of my charm.\" \"I was wondering about that.\" \"Now you know.\" \"Now I know. There was a woman killed half a block from here a few months ago. She and her husband interrupted burglars in their downstairs neighbors\u0027 apartment and she wound up raped and murdered.\" \"I remember the case.\" \"Well, it\u0027s my case now. Her brother hired me yesterday, he thinks the husband did it. The couple whose apartment it was, the downstairs neighbors, he\u0027s this Jewish lawyer, retired, lots of dough, and she didn\u0027t have any furs stolen. You know why?\" \"She was wearing them all at once.\" \"Uh-uh. She\u0027s an animal-rights activist.\" \"Oh yeah? Good for her.\" \"I suppose. I wonder if she wears leather shoes.\" \"Probably. Who cares?\" She leaned forward. \"Look,\" she said, \"you could refuse to eat bread because yeast give their lives to make it. You could pass up antibiotics because what right do we have to murder germs? So she wears leather but she doesn\u0027t wear fur. So what?\" \"Well-\" \"Besides,\" she said, \"leather\u0027s neat and fur\u0027s tacky.\" \"Well, that settles it.\" \"Good. Did the husband do it?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I walked past the building earlier today. I can point it out to you later, it\u0027s on our way if I walk you home. Maybe you\u0027ll pick up some vibrations, solve the case just by walking past the murder site.\" \"But you didn\u0027t.\" \"No. He had a million and a half reasons to kill her.\" \"A million and a half-\" \"Dollars,\" I supplied. \"Between insurance and her own holdings.\" I told her about the Thurmans and what I\u0027d learned from Joe Durkin and Lyman Warriner. \"I\u0027m not sure what I can do that the police haven\u0027t already done,\" I said. \"Just poke around, I guess. Knock on doors, talk to people. Be nice if I could find out he\u0027s been having an affair, but of course that was the first thing Durkin looked for and he couldn\u0027t turn up a thing.\" \"Maybe he\u0027s got a boyfriend.\" \"That would fit with my client\u0027s theory, but gay people have a tendency to think the whole world is gay.\" \"While you and I know the whole world is morose.\" \"Uh-huh. You want to go to Maspeth tomorrow night?\" \"Speaking of what? Moroseness?\" \"No, I just-\" \"Or should it be morosity? Because Maspeth does sound pretty morose, although I shouldn\u0027t say that because I don\u0027t actually think I\u0027ve ever been there. What\u0027s in Maspeth?\" I told her and she said, \"I don\u0027t like boxing much. It\u0027s not a moral issue, I don\u0027t care if two grown men want to stand around and hit each other, but I\u0027d just as soon change the channel. Anyway, I\u0027ve got a class tomorrow night.\" \"What is it this semester?\" \"Contemporary Latin American Fiction. All the books I\u0027ve been telling myself I really ought to read, and now I have to.\" In the fall she\u0027d studied urban architecture, and I\u0027d gone with her a couple of times to look at buildings. \"You\u0027ll be missing the architecture of Maspeth,\" I said. \"Although I haven\u0027t really got a good reason to go myself, to tell you the truth. I don\u0027t have to travel that far to get a look at him. He lives right here in the neighborhood and his office is at Forty-eighth and Sixth. I think I\u0027m just looking for an excuse to go to the fights. If the New Maspeth Arena had squash matches instead of boxing I\u0027d probably stay home.\" \"You don\u0027t like squash?\" \"I like Orange Squash okay. I\u0027ve never actually seen squash played, so what do I know? Maybe I\u0027d like it.\" \"Maybe you would. I met a fellow once who\u0027s a nationally ranked squash player. A clinical psychologist from Schenectady, he was in town for a tournament at the New York Athletic Club. I never saw him play, though.\" \"I\u0027ll let you know if I run into him in Maspeth.\" \"Well, you never know. It\u0027s a small world. Did you say the Thurmans lived just a block from here?\" \"Half a block.\" \"Maybe they used to come here. Maybe Gary knows them.\" She frowned. \"Knew them. Knows him, knew her.\" \"Maybe. Let\u0027s ask him.\" \"You ask,\" she said. \"I can\u0027t seem to get the verbs right.\" AFTER we\u0027d settled the tab we went over to the bar. Gary was behind it, a tall lanky man with a droll manner and a beard that hung from his lower jaw like an oriole\u0027s nest. He said it was good to see us and asked when I would have some work for him. I told him it was hard to say. \"Once this gentleman entrusted me with a matter of grave importance,\" he told Elaine. \"It was an undercover assignment and I acquitted myself well.\" \"I\u0027m not surprised,\" she said. I asked about Richard and Amanda Thurman. They came in occasionally, he said, sometimes with another couple, sometimes just the two of them. \"He\u0027d have a vodka mart before dinner,\" he said. \"She\u0027d have a glass of wine. Sometimes he\u0027d come in by himself and have a quick beer at the bar. I don\u0027t remember the brand. Bud Light, Coors Light. Something light.\" \"Has he been in since the murder?\" \"Only once that I saw him. A week, two weeks ago, he and another fellow came in and had dinner one night. That\u0027s the only time I\u0027ve seen him since it happened. He lives very near here, you know.\" \"I know.\" \"Just halfway down the block.\" He leaned over the bar, dropped his voice. \"What\u0027s the story? Is there a suspicion of foul play?\" \"There\u0027d have to be, don\u0027t you think? The woman was raped and strangled.\" \"You know what I mean. Did he do it?\" \"What do you think? Does he look like a killer to you?\" \"I\u0027ve been in New York too long,\" he said. \"Everybody looks like a killer to me.\" ON our way out Elaine said, \"You know who might like to go to the fights tomorrow? Mick Ballou.\" \"He might at that. You want to stop at Grogan\u0027s for a minute?\" \"Sure,\" she said. \"I like Mick.\" He was there, and glad to see us, and enthusiastic at the idea of driving out to Maspeth to watch grown men stand around hitting each other. We didn\u0027t stay long at Grogan\u0027s, and when we left I flagged a cab, so we didn\u0027t walk past the building where Amanda Thurman had died, to her husband\u0027s horror or with his complicity. I stayed the night at Elaine\u0027s apartment, and I spent the next day starting to poke into the corners of Richard Thurman\u0027s life. I was back at my hotel in time to watch the five o\u0027clock news on CNN. Then I took a shower and got dressed, and when I went downstairs Mick\u0027s silver Cadillac was parked out front next to a fire hydrant. \"Maspeth,\" he said. I asked him if he knew how to get there. \"I do,\" he said. \"There was a man who had a factory out there, a Romanian Jew he was. He had a dozen women working for him, putting together bits of metal and plastic, making staple removers.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Say you\u0027ve stapled some papers together and you want to take them apart. You take one of his things and it nips the staple and draws it right out. He had some women assembling the creatures and others packing them a dozen to a box and shipping them all over the country.\" He sighed. \"He was a gambler, though, and he borrowed money and couldn\u0027t pay it back.\" \"What happened?\" \"Ah, that\u0027s a long story,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll have to tell it to you one of these days.\" NOW, five hours later, we were heading back to Manhattan on the Queensboro Bridge. He hadn\u0027t said anything more about the factory owner in Maspeth. Instead, I was telling him about the Cable TV executive. He said, \"The things people do to each other.\" He had done his share. One of the things he\u0027d done, according to neighborhood legend, was kill a man named Farrelly and carry his head around in a bowling bag, lugging it in and out of a dozen Hell\u0027s Kitchen saloons. Some people said he never opened the bag, just told everybody what it contained, but there were others who swore they\u0027d been there to see him haul out the head by the hair, saying, \"Will you look at poor Paddy Farrelly? And isn\u0027t he the ugliest bastard you ever saw?\" In the newspapers they say he\u0027s known as the Butcher Boy, but it\u0027s only the newspapers that call him that, just as no one but a ring announcer ever called Eldon Rasheed the Bulldog. The Farrelly story probably has something to do with the sobriquet, but so does the bloodstained butcher\u0027s apron Mick likes to wear. The apron belonged to his father. The senior Ballou had come over from France and worked cutting up carcasses in the wholesale meat markets on West Fourteenth Street. Mick\u0027s mother was Irish, and he got his speech from her and his looks from the old man. He is a big man, tall and heavily built, with a massive monolithic quality to him that suggests a prehistoric monument, a stone head from Easter Island. His own head is like a boulder, the skin scarred by acne and violence, the cheeks starting to show the broken capillaries that years of drinking will earn you. His eyes are a startling green. He is a hard drinker, a career criminal, and a man with blood on his hands as well as his apron, and there are people, he and I among them, who wonder at our friendship. I would be hard put to explain it, but neither could I easily explain my relationship with Elaine. It may be that all friendships are ultimately inexplicable, although some of them are harder to figure than others. MICK invited me back to Grogan\u0027s for coffee or a Coke but I begged off. He admitted he was tired himself. \"But one night next week we\u0027ll make a night of it,\" he said. \"And at closing time we\u0027ll lock the doors and sit in the dark telling old stories.\" \"That sounds good to me.\" \"And go to mass in the morning.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that part of it,\" I said. \"But the rest sounds good.\" He dropped me in front of the Northwestern and I stopped at the desk on my way upstairs. There weren\u0027t any messages. I went on up and went to bed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-7.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
