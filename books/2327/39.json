It\u0027s wonderful to wear tight leather pants and no underwear and get all wet inside the leather. Do you want to come upstairs with me? I could fuck you stupid. You remember what I did to that boy?\"\\n\\n \"You killed him.\"\\n\\n \"You think he had it so bad?\" She moved closer, took the lobe of my ear between her teeth. \"For three days we fucked his brains out, Bergen and I. We fucked him and sucked him and let him have whatever drugs he wanted. He had a lifetime of pleasure.\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t like the ending much.\"\\n\\n \"So he had pain. So what?\" Her hand stroked me in rhythm with her words. \"So he didn\u0027t live a hundred years, he didn\u0027t get to be an old man. Who wants to be an old man?\"\\n\\n \"I guess he died happy.\"\\n\\n \"That was his name, Happy.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"You knew that? You know a lot, Scudder. You think you give a shit about the boy? If you care so much about him, how come you got a hard-on?\"\\n\\n A good question. \"I never said I cared about him.\"\\n\\n \"What do you care about?\"\\n\\n \"Getting money for the tape. And living long enough to spend it.\"\\n\\n \"And what else?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough for now.\"\\n\\n \"You want me, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"People in hell want ice water.\"\\n\\n \"But they can\u0027t have it. You could have me if you wanted. We could go upstairs right now.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\\n\\n She sat back. \"Jesus, you\u0027re tough,\" she said. \"You\u0027re a hard case, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Not particularly.\"\\n\\n \"Richard would be under the table by now. He\u0027d be trying to eat me through the leather pants.\"\\n\\n \"Look where it got him.\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t have it so bad.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" I said. \"Who wants to be an old man? Look, just because you can give me a hard-on doesn\u0027t mean you can lead me around by it. Of course I want you. I wanted you when I first saw the tape.\" I picked up her hand, put it back in her own lap. \"After we\u0027ve done our business,\" I said, \"then I\u0027ll have you.\"\\n\\n \"You think so?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"You know who you remind me of? Bergen.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t look good in black rubber.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be so sure.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m circumcised.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you can get a transplant. No, you\u0027re like him on the inside, you both have the same hardness. You were a cop.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Did you ever kill anybody?\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"You did. You don\u0027t have to answer, I can feel it in you. Did you like it?\"\\n\\n \"Not particularly.\"\\n\\n \"Are you so sure that\u0027s the truth?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027What is truth?\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Ah, an age-old question. But I think I will sit across the table from you. If we are going to talk business it\u0027s better if we can look at each other.\"\\n\\n I told her I wasn\u0027t greedy. I wanted a single payment of fifty thousand dollars. They had paid that much to Leveque, although they hadn\u0027t allowed him to keep it. They could pay the same to me. \"You could be like him,\" she said. \"He had a copy, even though he swore he didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"He was stupid.\"\\n\\n \"To keep a copy?\"\\n\\n \"To lie about it. Of course I\u0027ve made a copy. I\u0027ve made two of them. One\u0027s with a lawyer. The other\u0027s in the safe of a private detective. Just in case I get mugged in an alley, or fall out a window.\"\\n\\n \"If you have copies you could extort more money from us.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"The copies are my insurance. And my own intelligence is your insurance. By selling you the tape once I\u0027m not extorting money from you. I\u0027m doing you a favor. If I tried it a second time you\u0027d be better off killing me, and I\u0027m smart enough to know that.\"\\n\\n \"And if we don\u0027t pay the first time? You go to the police?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because the tape\u0027s not enough to put you away. No, I\u0027d go to the press. The tabloids could run with the story. They\u0027d know you\u0027ve got too much blood on your hands to bring a libel suit. They\u0027d make things awfully hot for you. You might never face a criminal charge, but you\u0027d get more attention than you\u0027d ever be comfortable with. Your husband\u0027s friends in California wouldn\u0027t be very happy to see you in the limelight that way, and your neighbors might look at you funny in the elevator. You\u0027d pay fifty grand to avoid that kind of publicity, wouldn\u0027t you? Hell, anybody would.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a lot of money.\"\\n\\n \"You really think so? I don\u0027t know if I could get that much from a tabloid, but I could get half that. If they can\u0027t sell papers with a story like that they\u0027re in the wrong business. I could walk into an office this afternoon and walk out with a check for twenty-five thousand and nobody\u0027d say I was a blackmailer, either. They\u0027d call me a hero investigator, and they\u0027d probably give me an assignment to go out and dig up more dirt.\"\\n\\n \"I will have to talk to Bergen. You say it\u0027s not so much money, but it will take time to get it together.\"\\n\\n \"The hell it will,\" I said. \"When a man runs a money laundry it\u0027s not terribly hard for him to put his hands on some cash. You probably keep five times that sitting around the apartment.\"\\n\\n \"You have some funny ideas about how business works.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you can have the money tomorrow night,\" I said. \"That\u0027s when I want it.\"\\n\\n \"God,\" she said, \"you\u0027re so much like Bergen.\"\\n\\n \"Our tastes are different.\"\\n\\n \"You think so? Don\u0027t be so sure what your tastes are until you\u0027ve sampled everything on your plate. And you haven\u0027t yet, have you?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t missed too many meals.\"\\n\\n \"Bergen will want to meet you.\"\\n\\n \"Tomorrow night, when we carry out the transaction. I\u0027ll bring the tape so you can see what you\u0027re buying. Do you have a VCR in Maspeth?\"\\n\\n \"You want to make the exchange there? At the arena?\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s the safest spot for both sides.\"\\n\\n \"God knows it\u0027s private,\" she said. \"Except for Thursday nights the whole area is a wasteland. And even Thursdays it\u0027s not so busy. Tomorrow is what, Wednesday? I think perhaps that\u0027s possible. Of course I\u0027ll have to talk with Bergen.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"What time would you prefer?\"\\n\\n \"Late,\" I said. \"But I can call you later on and we\u0027ll work out the details.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" She looked at her watch. \"Call me around four.\"\\n\\n \"I will.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\" She opened her purse, put money on the table for our drinks. \"I\u0027ll tell you something, Scudder. I really wanted to go upstairs with you before. I was sopping wet. I wasn\u0027t just putting on an act.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t think you were.\"\\n\\n \"And you wanted me just as much. But I\u0027m glad we didn\u0027t do anything. You know why?\"\\n\\n \"Tell me.\"\\n\\n \"Because this way we\u0027ve still got the sexual tension going between us. Can you feel it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"It won\u0027t go away, either. It will still be there tomorrow night. Maybe I\u0027ll wear the crotchless pants to Maspeth. Would you like that?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n \"And long gloves, and high heels.\" She looked at me. \"And no shirt.\"\\n\\n \"And lipstick on your nipples.\"\\n\\n \"Rouge.\"\\n\\n \"But the same shade as your lipstick and nail polish.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps we\u0027ll play,\" she said. \"After we\u0027ve made the switch. Perhaps we\u0027ll have some fun, the three of us.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"You think we\u0027d try to take the money back? You\u0027d still have the copies. One with the lawyer, one with the private detective.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not it.\"\\n\\n \"What then?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027The three of us.\u0027 I was never one for crowds.\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t be crowded,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll have all the room you need.\"\\n\\n Chapter 21\\n\\n I called at four o\u0027clock. She must have been sitting right next to the phone. She picked it up the second it rang.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Scudder,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re punctual,\" she said. \"That\u0027s a good sign.\"\\n\\n \"Of what?\"\\n\\n \"Of punctuality. I spoke to my husband. He\u0027s agreed to your terms. Tomorrow night is acceptable. As far as the time is concerned, he suggests midnight.\"\\n\\n \"Make it one.\"\\n\\n \"One A.M.? Just a moment.\"\\n\\n There was a pause, and then Stettner took the phone. He said, \"Scudder? Bergen Stettner. One in the morning is fine.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m eager to meet you. You made quite an impression on my wife.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s pretty impressive herself.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve always thought so. I understand we already met, in a manner of speaking. You were the boxing fan looking for the lavatory in all the wrong places. I have to admit I don\u0027t have any recollection of what you look like.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll know me when you see me.\"\\n\\n \"I feel I know you already. I have one problem with our arrangement, as Olga explained the situation. You have extra copies with a lawyer and an agent, is that correct?\"\\n\\n \"A lawyer and a private investigator.\"\\n\\n \"To be opened by them in the event of your death, and certain specified wishes of yours to be carried out. Is that correct?\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"An understandable precaution. I could assure you it\u0027s unnecessary, but that might not put your mind at rest.\"\\n\\n \"Not entirely, no.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Trust everybody but cut the cards.\u0027 Isn\u0027t that what they say? Here\u0027s my dilemma, Scudder. Suppose we conclude our transaction to the satisfaction of all concerned and you go your way and we go ours, and five years from now you step off a curb and get run over by a bus. You see what I\u0027m getting at?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Because if I keep faith with you-\"\\n\\n \"I get the point,\" I said. \"I knew someone in a similar situation once. Give me a minute, I want to see if I can remember how he handled it.\" I thought for a moment. \"All right,\" I said. \"See how this sounds to you. I\u0027ll instruct both parties that, if I should die a year or more after today\u0027s date, they are to destroy the material left with them unless special circumstances exist.\"\\n\\n \"What sort of special circumstances?\"\\n\\n \"If there\u0027s a strong suspicion that I\u0027ve died as a result of foul play, and if the murderer has not been either identified or apprehended. In other words, you\u0027re clear if I\u0027m run over by a bus, or shot by a jealous lover. If I\u0027m murdered by person or persons unknown, then you\u0027re in the soup.\"\\n\\n \"And if you die within the first year?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got a problem.\"\\n\\n \"Even if it\u0027s a bus?\"\\n\\n \"Even if it\u0027s a heart attack.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t like that much.\"\\n\\n \"Best I can do.\"\\n\\n \"Shit. How\u0027s your health?\"\\n\\n \"Not bad.\"\\n\\n \"I hope you don\u0027t do a lot of coke.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t drink too much of it because of the bubbles.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s funny. You don\u0027t do skydiving or hang gliding, do you? Don\u0027t fly your own plane? God, will you listen to this? It sounds like an insurance examination. Well, you take good care of yourself, Scudder.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-39.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \\n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
