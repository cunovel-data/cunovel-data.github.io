{"id":63536,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"Better than I expected. How was your class?\" \"Great, but there\u0027s a ton of stuff I\u0027ve got to read. And there\u0027s one little airhead in the class who gets her hand up every time the instructor comes to the end of a sentence. If he doesn\u0027t find a way to shut her up I may have to kill her.\" I asked if I could come over. \"I\u0027d like to use your VCR for about an hour,\" I said. \"That\u0027s fine,\" she said, \"if you come over right away, and if it\u0027s really not much more than an hour. And if it\u0027s more fun than the last cassette you brought me.\" \"I\u0027ll be right over,\" I said. I hung up and stepped to the curb and caught a cab right away. When I got there she took my coat and said, \"Well, how did it go last night? Did you see the killer?\" I must have stared, and she said, \"Richard Thurman. Wasn\u0027t he supposed to be there? Isn\u0027t that why you went to Maspeth?\" \"I wasn\u0027t thinking about him. He was there, yes, but I\u0027m no closer to knowing if he killed her. I think I saw another killer.\" \"Oh?\" \"The man in the rubber suit. I saw a man and I think it was him.\" \"Was he wearing the same outfit?\" \"He was wearing a blue blazer.\" I told her about the man, and the boy he\u0027d had with him. \"So it\u0027s the same tape as last time,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll want to watch it again.\" \"Not for anything. What I think I\u0027ll do, I was figuring I might do this anyway, I\u0027ll run out and buy books for my class. It shouldn\u0027t take me more than an hour. You know how to work the VCR, don\u0027t you?\" I said I did. \"And I\u0027ll be back in time to get ready for my appointment. I\u0027ve got somebody coming at eleven-thirty.\" \"I\u0027ll be out of here by then.\" I waited until she was out the door, then got the VCR going and fast-forwarded past the Dirty Dozen footage. She let herself back in a few minutes before eleven, almost exactly an hour after she\u0027d left. By then I\u0027d watched the show twice. It ran a half hour, but the second time around I\u0027d worked the Fast Forward button, getting through it in half the time. I\u0027d rewound the thing and was standing at the window when she came back. She said, \"I just spent a hundred dollars on books. And I couldn\u0027t find half of what\u0027s on the list.\" \"Couldn\u0027t you get paperbacks?\" \"These are paperbacks. I don\u0027t know when I\u0027m going to find time to read all of these.\" She upended the shopping bag on the couch, picked up a book and tossed it back onto the pile. \"At least they\u0027re in English,\" she said, \"which is a good thing, since I don\u0027t happen to read Spanish or Portuguese. But are you really reading something if you read it in translation?\" \"If it\u0027s a good translation.\" \"I suppose so, but isn\u0027t it like seeing a movie with subtitles? What you\u0027re reading just isn\u0027t the same as what they\u0027re saying. Did you watch that thing?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"And? Was it him?\" \"I think so,\" I said. \"It would be a lot easier to say if he hadn\u0027t had that goddam hood on. He must have been sweltering in a skintight rubber suit and a rubber hood.\" \"Maybe the open crotch had a cooling effect.\" \"He looked right to me,\" I said. \"The one gesture, his hand on the boy\u0027s hair, that\u0027s what finally rang a bell for me, but there were other points of correspondence. The way he held himself, the way he moved, these are things you can\u0027t cover up with a costume. The hands looked right. The gesture, stroking the boy\u0027s hair, that was just as I remembered it.\" I frowned. \"I think it was the same girl, too.\" \"What girl? You didn\u0027t mention a girl. You mean his partner in crime, the one with the little tits?\" \"I think she was the placard girl. Strutting around the ring between rounds with a sign telling what round was coming up.\" \"I don\u0027t suppose she was wearing her leather drag.\" I shook my head. \"She was dressed for the beach, showing a lot of leg. I didn\u0027t pay much attention to her.\" \"I\u0027ll bet.\" \"I mean it. There was something faintly familiar about her but I didn\u0027t study her face.\" \"Of course not. You were too busy looking at her ass.\" She put a hand on my arm. \"I\u0027d love to hear more,\" she said. \"But you\u0027re expecting company. I\u0027ll clear out. Do you mind if I leave the tape? I don\u0027t want to carry it around all day or make a special trip to get rid of it.\" \"No problem. And I hate to rush you, but-\" I gave her a kiss and left. WHEN I got out to the street I had the urge to plant myself in a doorway and see who showed up. She hadn\u0027t come right out and said that her appointment was with a john, but neither had she said otherwise, and I had been careful not to ask. Nor did I really want to lurk in the shadows trying to spot her lunch date, and speculating just what he would have her do to earn the price of all those translations from the Spanish and Portuguese. Sometimes it bothered me. Sometimes it didn\u0027t, and sometimes I thought that it ought to bother me more or less than it did. Someday, I thought, not for the first time, I would have to get it all sorted out. In the meantime I walked over to Madison and took a bus thirty blocks uptown. Chance\u0027s gallery was one flight up over a shop that sold expensive clothing for children. The window featured a charming scene from Wind in the Willows, with the animals wearing the shop\u0027s fashions. Rat wore a moss-green jumper that probably cost as much as a whole shelf full of contemporary Latin American fiction. The brass plate downstairs read, L. CHANCE COULTER/AFRICANA. I climbed a flight of carpeted stairs. The gilt-edged black lettering on the door bore the same legend, along with BY APPOINTMENT ONLY. I didn\u0027t have an appointment, but maybe I wouldn\u0027t need one. I rang, and after a moment the door was opened by Kid Bascomb. He was wearing a three-piece suit, and he smiled broadly when he saw who it was. \"Mr. Scudder!\" he said. \"It\u0027s good to see you. Is Mr. Coulter expecting you?\" \"Not unless he has a crystal ball. I took a chance he\u0027d be in.\" \"He\u0027ll be glad to see you. He\u0027s on the telephone but come right in, Mr. Scudder, and make yourself comfortable. I\u0027ll just tell him you\u0027re here.\" I made my way around the room, looking at the masks and statues. I didn\u0027t know the field, but you didn\u0027t need much expertise to sense the quality of the pieces on display. I was standing in front of what the label identified as a Senufo mask from the Ivory Coast when the Kid returned to tell me that Chance would be with me in a minute. \"He\u0027s on the phone with a gentleman in Antwerp,\" he said. \"I believe that\u0027s in Belgium.\" \"I believe you\u0027re right. I didn\u0027t know you were working here, Kid.\" \"Oh, for some time now, Mr. Scudder.\" Last night in Maspeth I\u0027d told him to call me Matt, but it was a lost cause. \"You know I retired from the ring. I wasn\u0027t good enough.\" \"You were damned good.\" He grinned. \"Well, I met three in a row who was better. Were better. I retired, and then I looked for something to do, and Mr. Chance said to see if I liked working for him. Mr. Coulter, I mean.\" It was an easy mistake for him to make. When I first met Chance that one syllable was the only name he had, and it wasn\u0027t until he went into the art business that he added an initial in front and a surname after. \"And do you like it?\" \"It beats getting hit in the face. And yes, I like it very much. I\u0027m learning things. There\u0027s never a day I don\u0027t learn something.\" \"I wish I could say the same,\" Chance said. \"Matthew, it\u0027s about time you came to see me. I thought you were going to join us last night, you and your friend. We all trooped downstairs to Eldon\u0027s dressing room and when I turned around to introduce you you weren\u0027t there.\" \"We decided not to make a long night of it.\" \"And it did turn out to be a long night. Do you still have a taste for good coffee?\" \"Do you still get that special blend?\" \"Jamaican Blue Mountain. The price is outrageous, of course, but look around you.\" He indicated the masks and statues. \"The price of everything is ridiculous. Black, right? Arthur, could you bring us some coffee? And then you\u0027ll want to get at those invoices.\" He had first served me Jamaican coffee at his home, a converted firehouse on a quiet street in Greenpoint. His Polish neighbors thought the house belonged to a housebound retired physician named Levandowski, and that Chance was the good doctor\u0027s houseman and chauffeur. Instead Chance lived there alone in a house with a full weight gym and an eight-foot pool table and walls lined with museum-quality African art. I asked if he still had the firehouse. \"Oh, I couldn\u0027t bear to move,\" he said. \"I thought I\u0027d have to sell in order to open this place, but I found a way. After all, I didn\u0027t have to purchase stock. I had a house jammed full of it.\" \"Do you still have a collection?\" \"Better than ever. In a sense it\u0027s all my collection, and in another sense everything I have is for sale, so it\u0027s all store stock. Do you remember that Benin bronze? The queen\u0027s head?\" \"With all the necklaces.\" \"I overpaid for her at auction, and every three months when she didn\u0027t sell I raised the price. It finally got so high somebody couldn\u0027t resist her. I hated to see her go, but then I took the money and bought something else.\" He took my arm. \"Let me show you some things. I was in Africa for a month this spring, I spent two full weeks in Mali, in the Dogon country. A sweetly primitive people, their huts reminded me of the Anasazi dwellings at Mesa Verde. See, that piece is Dogon. Square holes for eyes, everything very straightforward and unapologetic.\" \"You\u0027ve come a long way,\" I said. \"Oh, my,\" he said. \"Haven\u0027t I just?\" When I first met Chance he was successful, but in another line of work. He had been a pimp, though hardly the traditional figure with the pink Cadillac and the floppy purple hat. He\u0027d hired me to find out who killed one of his girls. \"I owe it all to you,\" he said. \"You put me out of business.\" That was true in a sense. By the time I\u0027d done what he hired me to do, another of his girls was dead and the rest were off his string. \"You were ready for a career change anyway,\" I told him. \"You were having a mid-life crisis.\" \"Oh, I was too young for that. I\u0027m still too young for that. Matthew? You didn\u0027t just drop in to be sociable.\" \"No.\" \"Or for the coffee.\" \"Or that either. There was somebody I saw at the fights last night. I thought maybe you might be able to tell me who he is.\" \"Somebody with me? Somebody in Rasheed\u0027s corner?\" I shook my head. \"Somebody sitting first row ringside in the center section.\" I sketched a diagram in midair. \"Here\u0027s the ring, here\u0027s where you were sitting right by the blue corner. Here\u0027s where Ballou and I were. The guy I\u0027m interested in was sitting right about here.\" \"What did he look like?\" \"White man, balding, say five-eleven, say a hundred and ninety pounds.\" \"Cruiserweight. How was he dressed?\" \"Blue blazer, gray trousers. Blue polka-dot tie with large dots on it.\" \"The tie\u0027s the first thing that doesn\u0027t sound like everybody else. I might have noticed a tie like that, but I don\u0027t believe I ever saw it.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-13.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
