Whenever I went to a bar I told myself I was looking to meet somebody. Generally all I got was drunk, but now and then I got lucky. Sometimes I even remembered it.\"\n \"And sometimes you\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t.\"\n \"Well, sure. The point is I didn\u0027t give that up completely when I first came into the program. The marriage almost ended during the worst of the drinking, but I bottomed out and sobered up and we worked things out. She started going to Al-Anon, started dealing with her own issues, and we hung together. I would still have something going on the side, you know.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know.\"\n \"No?\" He thought about it. \"Well, I guess that was before I knew you, before you got sober. Because I stopped fooling around after a couple of years. It was no great moral decision to reform. I just didn\u0027t seem to be doing that anymore. I don\u0027t know, the health thing may have been a factor, first herpes and then AIDS, but I don\u0027t think I got scared off. I think I lost interest.\" He took a sip of tea. \"And now I\u0027m one of Father Feeney\u0027s ninety percent, and she\u0027s out there.\"\n \"Well, maybe it\u0027s her turn. To have a little fling.\"\n \"This isn\u0027t the first time.\"\n \"Oh,\" I said.\n \"I don\u0027t know how I feel about it.\"\n \"Does she know that you know?\"\n \"Who knows what she knows? Who knows what I know? I just wanted things to stay the way they were, you know? And they never do.\"\n \"I know,\" I said. \"I was with Elaine last night and she said the M word.\"\n \"What\u0027s that, motherfucker?\"\n \"Marriage.\"\n \"Same thing,\" he said. \"Marriage is a motherfucker. She wants to get married?\"\n \"She didn\u0027t say that. She said if we were to get married, then she\u0027d stop seeing clients.\"\n \"Clients?\"\n \"Johns.\"\n \"Oh, right. That\u0027s the condition? Marry me and I\u0027ll stop?\"\n \"No, nothing like that. Just speaking hypothetically, and then she apologized for saying the word and we both agreed we want things to stay the way they are.\" I looked down into my teacup the way I used to look into a glass of whiskey. \"I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s going to be possible. It seems to me that when two people want something to stay just the way it is, that\u0027s when it changes.\"\n \"Well,\" he said, \"you\u0027ll have to see how it goes.\"\n \"And take it a day at a time, and don\u0027t drink.\"\n \"I like that,\" he said. \"It has a nice ring to it.\"\n WE sat there a long while, talking about one thing and another. I talked about my cases, the legitimate one that I couldn\u0027t seem to come to grips with and the other one that I couldn\u0027t seem to leave alone. We talked about baseball and how spring training might be delayed by an owners\u0027 lockout. We talked about a kid in our home group with a horrendous history of drugs and alcohol who\u0027d gone out after four months of sobriety.\n Around eight he said, \"What I think I\u0027ll do tonight, I think I\u0027ll go to some meeting where I won\u0027t run into anybody I know. I want to talk about all this shit with Bev at a meeting and I can\u0027t do that around here.\"\n \"You could.\"\n \"Yeah, but I don\u0027t want to. I\u0027m an old-timer, I\u0027ve been sober since the Flood, I wouldn\u0027t want the newcomers to realize I\u0027m not a perfect model of serenity.\" He grinned. \"I\u0027ll go downtown and give myself permission to sound as confused and fucked-up as I feel. And who knows? Maybe I\u0027ll get lucky, find some sweet young thing looking for a father figure.\"\n \"That\u0027s a good idea,\" I said. \"Find out if she\u0027s got a sister.\"\n I went to a meeting myself. There\u0027s no meeting at St. Paul\u0027s on Sundays, so I went to one at Roosevelt Hospital. A fair number of the people who showed up were in-patients from the detox ward. The speaker had started out as a heroin addict, kicked that in a twenty-eight-day residential program in Minnesota, and devoted the next fifteen years to alcoholic drinking. Now she was almost three years sober.\n They went around the room after she was done, and most of the patients just said their names and passed. I decided I\u0027d say something, if just to tell her I enjoyed her story and was glad she was sober, but when it got to me I said, \"My name is Matt and I\u0027m an alcoholic. I\u0027ll just listen tonight.\"\n Afterward I went back to the hotel. No messages. I sat in my room reading for two hours. Someone had passed along a paperback volume called The Newgate Calendar, a case-by-case report on British crimes of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. I\u0027d had it around for a month or so, and at night I would read a few pages before I went to sleep.\n It was mostly interesting, although some cases were more interesting than others. What got to me some nights, though, was the way nothing changed. People back then killed each other for every reason and for no reason, and they did it with every means at their disposal and all the ingenuity they could bring to bear.\n Sometimes it provided a good antidote for the morning paper, with its deadening daily chronicle of contemporary crime. It was easy to read the paper each day and conclude that humanity was infinitely worse than ever, that the world was going to hell and that hell was where we belonged. Then, when I read about men and women killing each other centuries ago for pennies or for love, I could tell myself that we weren\u0027t getting worse after all, that we were as good as we\u0027d ever been.\n On other nights that same revelation brought not reassurance but despair. We had been ever thus. We were not getting better, we would never get better. Anyone along the way who\u0027d died for our sins had died for nothing. We had more sins in reserve, we had a supply that would last for all eternity.\n WHAT I read that night didn\u0027t pick me up, and neither did it ready me for sleep. Around midnight I went out. It had turned colder, and there was a raw wind blowing off the Hudson. I walked over to Grogan\u0027s Open House, the old Irish saloon Mick owns, although there\u0027s another name than his on the license and ownership papers.\n The place was almost empty. Two solitary drinkers sat well apart at the long bar, one drinking a bottle of beer, the other nursing a black pint of Guinness. Two old men in long thrift-shop overcoats shared a table along the wall. Burke was behind the bar. Before I could ask he volunteered that Mick hadn\u0027t been in all evening. \"He could come in any time,\" he said, \"but I don\u0027t expect him.\"\n I ordered a Coke and sat at the bar. The TV was tuned to a cable channel that broadcasts old black-and-white films uninterrupted by commercials. They were showing Little Caesar, with Edward G. Robinson.\n I watched for half an hour or so. Mick didn\u0027t come in, and neither did anyone else. I finished my Coke and went home.\n Chapter 10\n The cops at the Twentieth Precint weren\u0027t overly impressed that I\u0027d been on the job once myself. They were courteous all the same, and would have been happy to fill me in on the circumstances of Arnold Leveque\u0027s death. There was only one problem. They had never heard of him.\n \"I don\u0027t know the date,\" I said, \"but it happened sometime between April nineteenth and June fourth, and if I were guessing I\u0027d say early May.\"\n \"That\u0027s of last year.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"That\u0027s Arnold Leveque? You want to spell the last name again, make sure I got it right?\"\n I did, and supplied the Columbus Avenue address. \"That\u0027s here in the Two-oh,\" he said. \"Lemme see if anybody heard of the guy.\" No one had. He came back and we puzzled over it for a few minutes, and then he excused himself again. He came back with a bemused expression on his face.\n \"Arnold Leveque,\" he said. \"Male Caucasian, died nine May. Multiple stab wounds. Not in our files because it wasn\u0027t our case. He was killed on the other side of Fifty-ninth Street. You want Midtown North, that\u0027s on West Fifty-fourth.\"\n I told him I knew where it was.\n THAT explained why Herta Eigen got the runaround from the cops at her local precinct- they hadn\u0027t known what she was talking about. I\u0027d walked up to the Twentieth first thing after breakfast, and it was mid-morning when I got to Midtown North. Durkin wasn\u0027t in, but I didn\u0027t need him to run interference for me on this. Anybody could give me the information.\n There was a cop named Andreotti whom I\u0027d met a few times over the past year or two. He was at a desk catching up on his paperwork and didn\u0027t mind an interruption. \"Leveque, Leveque,\" he said. He frowned and ran a hand through a mop of shaggy black hair. \"I think I caught that one, me and Bellamy. A fat guy, right?\"\n \"So they tell me.\"\n \"You see so many stiffs in a week you can\u0027t keep \u0027em straight. He musta been murdered. Natural causes, you can\u0027t even remember their names.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Except if it\u0027s the kind of name you can\u0027t forget. There was a woman two, three weeks back, Wanda Plainhouse. I thought, yeah, I wouldn\u0027t mind playin\u0027 house with you.\" He smiled at the memory, then said, \"Of course she was alive, Wanda, but it\u0027s an example of how one name\u0027ll stick in your mind.\"\n He pulled Leveque\u0027s file. The film buff had been found in a narrow alley between two tenements on Forty-ninth Street west of Tenth Avenue. The body had been discovered after an anonymous call to 911 logged in at 6:56 on the morning of May 9th. The medical examiner estimated the time of death at around eleven the previous night. The deceased had been stabbed seven times in the chest and abdomen with a long, narrow-bladed knife. Any of several of the wounds would have been sufficient to cause death.\n \"Forty-ninth between Tenth and Eleventh,\" I said.\n \"Closer to Eleventh. The buildings on either side were scheduled for demolition, X\u0027s on the windows and nobody living in \u0027em. I think they might have come down by now.\"\n \"I wonder what he was doing there.\"\n Andreotti shrugged. \"Looking for something and unlucky enough to find it. Looking to buy dope, looking for a woman or a man. Everybody\u0027s out there looking for something.\"\n I thought of TJ. Everybody\u0027s got a jones, he\u0027d said, or what would they be doing on the Deuce?\n I asked if Leveque had been a drug user. No outward signs of it, he said, but you never knew. \"Maybe he was drunk,\" he offered. \"Staggering around, didn\u0027t know where he was. No, that\u0027s not it. Blood alcohol\u0027s not much more than a trace. Well, whatever he was looking for, he picked the wrong place to look for it.\"\n \"You figured robbery?\"\n \"No money in his pockets, no watch and wallet. Sounds like a killer with a crack habit and a switchblade.\"\n \"How\u0027d you ID him?\"\n \"The landlady where he lived. She was some piece of work, man. About this high, but she wasn\u0027t taking no shit. Let us into his room and stood there watching us like a hawk, like we\u0027ll clean the place out if she turns her back. You\u0027d think it was her stuff, which it probably wound up being, because I don\u0027t think we ever did turn up any next of kin.\" He flipped through the few sheets of paper. \"No, I don\u0027t think we did. Anyway, she ID\u0027d him. She didn\u0027t want to go. \u0027Why I got to look at a dead body? I seen enough in my life, believe me.\u0027 But she took a good look and said it was him.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-18.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: \n A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
