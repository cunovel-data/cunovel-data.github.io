If present trends continued, the News announced, that record could fall in mid-September.\n On Park Avenue, a handful of blocks from Chance\u0027s gallery, a man had leaned out the window of an unmarked white van to snatch the handbag of a middle-aged woman who was waiting for the light to change. She\u0027d had the bag\u0027s strap looped around her neck, presumably to make it harder to steal, and when the van sped off she was dragged and strangled. A sidebar to the main article advised women to carry their bags in a manner that would minimize physical risk if the bag were stolen. \"Or don\u0027t carry a purse at all,\" one expert suggested.\n In Queens, a group of teenagers walking across the Forest Park golf course had come upon the body of a young woman who had been abducted several days earlier in Woodhaven. She\u0027d been doing her grocery shopping on Jamaica Avenue when another van, a light blue one, pulled up at the curb. Two men jumped out of the back, grabbed her, hustled her into the van, and climbed in after her. The van was gone before anyone could think to get the number. A preliminary medical examination disclosed evidence of sexual assault and multiple stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.\n Don\u0027t watch television, don\u0027t carry a purse, don\u0027t walk down the street. Jesus.\n I got to the video store at nine-thirty. The owner, freshly shaved and wearing a clean shirt, led me to his office in the back. He remembered my name and introduced himself as Phil Fielding. We shook hands, and he said, \"Your business card didn\u0027t say, but are you some kind of investigator? Something like that?\"\n \"Something like that.\"\n \"Just like in the movies,\" he said. \"I\u0027d like to help if there was anything I could do, but I didn\u0027t know anything the last time I saw you and that was six months ago. I stayed around last night after we closed and checked the books on the chance that I might have the woman\u0027s name somewhere, but it was no go. Unless you\u0027ve got an idea, something I haven\u0027t thought of-\"\n \"The tenant,\" I said.\n \"You mean her tenant? The one who owned the tapes?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"She said he died. Or did he skip out on the rent? My memory\u0027s a little vague, it wasn\u0027t a high-priority thing for me to remember. I\u0027m pretty sure she said she was selling his things to recoup back rent that he owed.\"\n \"That\u0027s what you said in July.\"\n \"So if he died or just left town-\"\n \"I\u0027d still like to know who he was,\" I said. \"Do many people own that many films on videocassette? I had the impression that most people rented them.\"\n \"You\u0027d be surprised,\" he said. \"We sell a lot. Children\u0027s classics, especially, even in this neighborhood where not that many people have kids. Snow White, The Wizard of Oz. We sold a ton of E.T. and we\u0027re selling Batman now, but it\u0027s not as strong as I would have predicted. A lot of people will buy the occasional favorite film. And of course there\u0027s a big market for exercise videos and instructional stuff, but that\u0027s a whole other area, that\u0027s not movies.\"\n \"Do you think many people would own as many as thirty films?\"\n \"No,\" he said. \"I\u0027m guessing, but I\u0027d say it\u0027d be rare to own more than half a dozen. That\u0027s not counting exercise videos and football-highlight films. Or pornography, which I don\u0027t carry.\"\n \"What I\u0027m getting at is that the tenant, the owner of these thirty cassettes, was probably a film buff.\"\n \"Oh, no question,\" he said. \"This guy had all three versions of The Maltese Falcon. The original 1931 version with Ricardo Cortez-\"\n \"You told me.\"\n \"Did I? I\u0027m not surprised, it was fairly remarkable. I don\u0027t know where he got that stuff on video, I\u0027ve never been able to find it in the catalogs. Yeah, he was a buff.\"\n \"So he probably rented films besides the ones he owned.\"\n \"Oh, I see what you\u0027re getting at. Yeah, I think that\u0027d be a sure bet. A lot of people buy an occasional film, but everybody rents them.\"\n \"And he lived in the neighborhood.\"\n \"How do you know that?\"\n \"If his landlady lived around here-\"\n \"Oh, right.\"\n \"So he could have been a customer of yours.\"\n He thought about it. \"Sure,\" he said, \"it\u0027s possible. It\u0027s even possible we had conversations about film noir, but I can\u0027t remember anything.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got all your members programmed into your computer system, haven\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yeah, it makes life a whole lot simpler.\"\n \"You said she brought in the bag of cassettes the first week in June. So if he was a customer, his account would have been inactive for the past seven or eight months.\"\n \"I could have a lot of accounts like that,\" he said. \"People move, they die, some kid on crack breaks in and steals their VCR. Or they start doing business with somebody down the block and stop coming here. I\u0027ve had people, I don\u0027t see them for months, and then they start coming in again.\"\n \"How many accounts do you figure you have that have been inactive since June?\"\n \"I have no idea whatsoever,\" he said. \"But I can certainly find out. Why don\u0027t you have a seat? Or browse around, maybe you\u0027ll find a movie you want to see.\"\n It was past ten by the time he was finished, but no one had come knocking on the door. \"I told you the mornings were slow,\" he said. \"I came up with twenty-six names. These are people whose accounts have been inactive since the fourth of June, but who did rent at least one tape from us during the first five months of the year. Of course if he was sick a long time, stuck in the hospital-\"\n \"Let me start with what you\u0027ve got.\"\n \"All right. I copied the names and addresses for you, and phone numbers when they gave them. A lot of people won\u0027t give out phone numbers, especially women, and I can\u0027t say I blame them. I also have credit-card numbers, but I didn\u0027t copy those down because I\u0027m supposed to keep that information confidential, although I suppose I could stretch a point if there\u0027s someone you can\u0027t trace any other way.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll need it.\" He had copied the names on two sheets of lined notebook paper. I scanned them and asked if any of the names had struck a chord.\n \"Not really,\" he said. \"I see so many people all day every day that I only remember the regulars, and I don\u0027t always recognize them or remember their names. With these twenty-six people I looked up what they\u0027d checked out during the last year, that\u0027s what took me so long. I thought maybe one person would shape up very definitely as a film buff, with rental choices that made sense in terms of what he owned, but I couldn\u0027t find anything that looked like a buff profile.\"\n \"It was worth a try.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I thought. I\u0027m pretty sure it was a man, that the landlady referred to her tenant as him, and some of the twenty-six are women, but I put everybody down.\"\n \"Good.\" I folded the sheets of paper, tucked them into my breast pocket. \"I\u0027m sorry to have put you to so much trouble,\" I said. \"I appreciate it.\"\n \"Hey,\" he said, \"when I think of all the pleasure you guys have brought me on the screen, how could I turn you down?\" He grinned, then turned serious. \"Are you trying to bust a porn ring? Is that what this is all about?\" When I hesitated he assured me that he understood if I couldn\u0027t talk about it. But would I at least drop by when it was all over and tell him how it had turned out?\n I said I would.\n I had twenty-six names, only eleven with phone numbers. I tried the phone numbers first, because it\u0027s so much easier when you can do this sort of thing without walking all over the city. It was frustrating, though, because I couldn\u0027t seem to complete a call, and when I did I succeeded only in getting a recording. I got three answering machines, one with a cute message, the others simply repeating the last four digits of the number and inviting me to leave a message. Four times I got the NYNEX computer-generated voice telling me that the number I had reached was no longer in service. On one occasion it supplied a new number; I wrote it down and called it, and nobody answered.\n When I finally got a human voice I barely knew how to respond. I looked quickly at my list and said, \"Uh, Mr. Accardo? Joseph Accardo?\"\n \"Speaking.\"\n \"You\u0027re a member of the video-rental club\"- what was its name?- \"at Broadway and Sixty-first.\"\n \"Broadway and Sixty-first,\" he said. \"Which one\u0027s that?\"\n \"Next to Martin\u0027s.\"\n \"Oh, right, sure. What did I do, not bring something back?\"\n \"Oh, no,\" I said. \"I just noticed there\u0027s been no activity in your account in months, Mr. Accardo, and I wanted to invite you to come in and check out our selection.\"\n \"Oh,\" he said, surprised. \"Well, that\u0027s very nice of you. I\u0027ll be sure and do that. I got in the habit, going to this place near where I work, but I\u0027ll stop by one of these nights.\"\n I hung up the phone and crossed Accardo off the list. I had twenty-five names left and it looked as though I was going to have to do them on foot.\n I called it a day around four-thirty, by which time I\u0027d managed to cross off ten more names. It was a slow process, slower than I might have expected. The addresses were all pretty much within walking distance, so I could get around without too much trouble, but that didn\u0027t mean I could establish whether or not a particular person still lived at a particular address.\n I was back in my hotel room by five. I showered and shaved and sat in front of the TV. At seven I met Elaine at a Moroccan place on Cornelia Street in the Village. We both ordered the couscous. She said, \"If the food tastes as good as the room smells, we\u0027re in for a treat. What\u0027s the best place in the world to get couscous?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Casablanca?\"\n \"Walla Walla.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"Get it? Couscous, Walla Walla. Or, if you wanted couscous in Germany, you\u0027d go to Baden-Baden.\"\n \"I think I get the premise.\"\n \"I knew you would, you\u0027ve got that kind of mind. Where would you get couscous in Samoa?\"\n \"Pago Pago. Excuse me, will you? I\u0027ll be back in a minute, I have to make peepee.\"\n The couscous was terrific and the portions were large. While we ate, I told her how I\u0027d spent the day. \"It was frustrating,\" I said, \"because I couldn\u0027t just check the doorbells to determine whether or not the person I was looking for lived there.\"\n \"Not in New York.\"\n \"Of course not. A lot of people leave the slot next to their bell blank on general principles. I suppose I should understand that, I\u0027m in a program that places a premium on anonymity, but some people might find it a little strange. Other people have names on the doorbell but the names aren\u0027t theirs, because they\u0027re living in an illegal sublet and they don\u0027t want anybody to find out. So if I\u0027m looking for Bill Williams, say-\"\n \"That\u0027s William Williams,\" she said. \"The couscous king of Walla Walla.\"\n \"That\u0027s the guy. If his name\u0027s not on the bell, that doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027s not there. And if his name is on the bell, that doesn\u0027t mean anything either.\"\n \"Poor baby. So what do you do, call the super?\"\n \"If there\u0027s a resident super, but in most of the smaller buildings there isn\u0027t. And the super\u0027s no more likely to be home than anybody else. And a superintendent doesn\u0027t necessarily know the names of the tenants, as far as that goes. You wind up ringing bells and knocking on doors and talking to people, most of whom don\u0027t know much about their neighbors and are very cautious about disclosing what they do know.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-15.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: \n A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
