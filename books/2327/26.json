So why not do any bloody thing we please with each other? Is that it? Is that how the world works?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know how the world works.\"\n \"No, and neither do I. And I don\u0027t know how you get through it on fucking coffee, I swear I don\u0027t. If I didn\u0027t have this-\"\n He filled his glass.\n LATER we were talking about black men. He had little use for them and I let him tell me why. \"Now there\u0027s some who are all right,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll grant you that. What was the name of that fellow we met at the fights?\"\n \"Chance.\"\n \"I liked him,\" he said, \"but you\u0027d have to say he\u0027s another type entirely from the usual run. He\u0027s educated, he\u0027s a gentleman, he\u0027s a professional man.\"\n \"Do you know how I got to know him?\"\n \"At his place of business, I would suppose. Or didn\u0027t you say you met him at the fights?\"\n \"That\u0027s where we met, but there was a business reason for the meeting. That was before Chance was an art dealer. He was a pimp then. One of his whores got killed by a lunatic with a machete, and he hired me to look into it.\"\n \"He\u0027s a pimp, then.\"\n \"Not anymore. Now he\u0027s an art dealer.\"\n \"And a friend of yours.\"\n \"And a friend of mine.\"\n \"You have an odd taste in friends. What\u0027s so funny?\"\n \" \u0027An odd taste in friends.\u0027 A cop I know said that to me.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"He was talking about you.\"\n \"Was he now?\" He laughed. \"Ah, well. Hard to argue with that, isn\u0027t it?\"\n ON a night like that the stories come easy, and the silences between the stories are easy, too. He talked about his father and mother, both long gone, and about his brother Dennis who had died in Vietnam. There were two other brothers, one a lawyer and real estate broker in White Plains, the other selling cars in Medford, Oregon.\n \"At least he was the last I heard of him,\" he said. \"He was going to be a priest, Francis was, but he lasted less than a year at the seminary. \u0027I learned I liked the girls and the gargle too much.\u0027 Hell, there\u0027s priests that have their share of both. He tried one thing and another and two years ago he was in Oregon selling Plymouths. \u0027It\u0027s great here, Mickey, come out and see me.\u0027 But I never did, and he\u0027s likely gone somewhere else by now. I think the poor bastard still wishes he was a priest, even though his faith\u0027s long since lost. Can you understand that?\"\n \"I think so.\"\n \"Were you raised Catholic? You weren\u0027t, were you?\"\n \"No. There were Catholics and Protestants in the family but nobody worked at it very hard. I grew up not going to church and wouldn\u0027t have known which one to go to. I even had one grandparent who was half-Jewish.\"\n \"Is that so? You could have been a lawyer like Rosenstein.\"\n He told the story he\u0027d started Thursday night, about the man who owned the factory in Maspeth where they assembled staple removers. The man had incurred gambling debts and wanted Mick to burn the place so he could collect the insurance. The arsonist Mick used had made a mistake and torched the place directly across the street instead. When Mick told the arsonist of his error the man insisted it was no problem, he\u0027d go back the next night and do it right. And he\u0027d include an extra for goodwill, he offered. He\u0027d burn the man\u0027s house down and not charge him for it.\n I told a story I hadn\u0027t thought of in years. \"I was fresh out of the Academy,\" I said, \"and they teamed me up with an old hairbag named Vince Mahaffey. He must have had thirty years in and he never made plainclothes and never wanted to. He taught me plenty, including things they probably didn\u0027t want me to learn, like the difference between clean graft and dirty graft and how to get as much of the first kind as you can. He drank like a fish and ate like a pig and he smoked those little Italian cigars. Guinea stinkers, he called them. I thought you had to be in one of the five families to smoke those things. He was a hell of a role model, Vince was.\n \"One night we caught one, a domestic disturbance, the neighbors called it in. This was in Brooklyn, in Park Slope. It\u0027s all gentrified there now, but this was before any of that got started. It was an ordinary white working-class neighborhood then.\n \"The apartment was a fifth-floor walk-up, and Mahaffey had to stop a couple of times along the way. Finally we\u0027re standing in front of the door and you can\u0027t hear a thing. \u0027Ah, shit,\u0027 Vince said. \u0027What do you bet he killed her? Now he\u0027ll be crying and yanking his hair out and we\u0027ll have to take him in.\u0027\n \"But we rang the bell and they both answered it, a man and a woman. He was a big guy around thirty-five, a construction worker, and she looked like a girl who\u0027d been pretty in high school and let herself go. And they were surprised to hear that we\u0027d had a complaint. Oh, had they been making too much noise? Well, maybe they\u0027d been playing the TV a little loud. It wasn\u0027t even on now, the whole place was silent as a grave. Mahaffey pushed it the least little bit, said we\u0027d had a report of sounds of a struggle and a loud argument, and they looked at each other and said, well, yeah, they\u0027d had a discussion that turned into a little bit of an argument, maybe they shouted at each other some, and maybe he\u0027d pounded on the kitchen table to make a point, and they\u0027d be careful to keep it down for the rest of the evening, because they certainly didn\u0027t want to disturb anybody.\n \"He\u0027d been drinking but I wouldn\u0027t have said he was drunk, and they were both calm and anxious to please, and I was ready to wish \u0027em goodnight and get on to something else. But Vince had been to hundreds of domestics and this one smelled and he could tell. I might have picked up on it myself if I hadn\u0027t been so new. Because they were hiding something. Otherwise they\u0027d have said there was no fight and no problem and told us to go to hell.\n \"So he stalled, talking about this and that, and I\u0027m wondering what\u0027s the matter with him, is he waiting for the husband to break out the bottle and offer us drinks. And then we both heard a noise, like a cat but not like a cat. \u0027Oh, it\u0027s nothing,\u0027 they said, but Mahaffey pushed them out of the way and opened a door, and we found a little girl there, seven years old but small for her age, and now you could see why the domestic disturbance hadn\u0027t left any marks on the wife. All of the marks were on the girl.\n \"The father had beaten the shit out of her. Bruises all over her, one eye closed, and marks on one arm where they burned her with cigarettes. \u0027She fell down,\u0027 the mother insisted. \u0027He never touched her, she fell down.\u0027\n \"We took them to the station house and parked them in a holding cell. Then we took the kid to a hospital, but first Mahaffey dragged her into an empty office and borrowed somebody\u0027s camera. He undressed the kid except for her underpants and took a dozen pictures of her. \u0027I\u0027m a shit photographer,\u0027 he said. \u0027If I take enough shots maybe something\u0027ll come out.\u0027\n \"We had to let the parents go. The doctors at the hospital confirmed what we already knew, that the child\u0027s injuries could only have been the result of a beating, but the husband was swearing he didn\u0027t do it and the wife was backing him up, and you weren\u0027t going to get testimony out of the kid. And they were very reluctant to prosecute child abuse in those days anyway. It\u0027s a little better now. At least I think it is. But we had no choice but to cut the parents loose.\"\n \"You must have wanted to kill the bastard,\" Mick said.\n \"I wanted to put him away. I couldn\u0027t believe that he could do something like that and get away with it. Mahaffey told me it happened all the time. You hardly ever got a case like that to court, not unless the child died and sometimes not then. Then why, I asked, had he bothered taking the pictures? He patted me on the shoulder and told me the pictures were worth a thousand words apiece. I didn\u0027t know what he was talking about.\n \"Middle of the next week we\u0027re in the car. \u0027It\u0027s a nice day,\u0027 he said. \u0027Let\u0027s go for a ride, let\u0027s go to Manhattan.\u0027 I didn\u0027t know where the hell he was taking me. We wound up on Third Avenue in the Eighties. It was a construction site, they\u0027d knocked down a batch of small buildings and were putting up a big one. \u0027I found out where he drinks,\u0027 Mahaffey said, and we went into this neighborhood tavern, Carney\u0027s or Carty\u0027s or something, it\u0027s long gone now. The place was full of guys with work shoes and hard hats, construction workers on their break or at the end of their shift, having a ball and a beer and unwinding.\n \"Well, we were both in uniform, and the conversation stopped when we walked in. The father was at the bar in the middle of a knot of his buddies. It\u0027s funny, I don\u0027t remember his name.\"\n \"Why should you? As many years ago as it was.\"\n \"You would think I would remember. Anyway, Mahaffey walked right through them all and went up to the guy, and he turned to the men standing around and asked them if they knew him. \u0027You think he\u0027s all right? You think he\u0027s a decent sort of a guy?\u0027 And they all said sure, he\u0027s a good man. What else are they going to say?\n \"So Mahaffey opens his blouse, his blue shirt, and he takes out a brown envelope, and it\u0027s got all the pictures he took of the kid. He had them blow them up to eight-by-ten, and they all came out perfect. \u0027This is what he did to his own fucking child,\u0027 Mahaffey says, and he passes the pictures around. \u0027Take a good look, this is what the bastard does to a defenseless child.\u0027 And, when they\u0027ve all had a good look, he tells them we\u0027re cops, we can\u0027t put this man in jail, we can\u0027t lay a finger on this man. But, he says, they aren\u0027t cops, and once we\u0027re out the door we can\u0027t stop them from doing whatever they think they have to do. \u0027And I know you\u0027re good American working men,\u0027 he tells them, \u0027and I know you\u0027ll do the right thing.\u0027 \"\n \"What did they do?\"\n \"We didn\u0027t hang around to watch. Driving back to Brooklyn Mahaffey said, \u0027Matt, there\u0027s a lesson for you. Never do something when you can get somebody else to do it for you.\u0027 Because he knew they\u0027d do it, and we found out later that they damn near killed the sonofabitch in the process. Lundy, that was his name. Jim Lundy, or maybe it was John.\n \"He wound up in the hospital and he stayed a full week. Wouldn\u0027t make a complaint, wouldn\u0027t say who did it to him. Swore he fell down and it was his own clumsiness.\n \"He couldn\u0027t go back to that job when he got out of the hospital because there was no way those men would work with him again. But I guess he stayed in construction and was able to get jobs, because a few years later I heard he went in the hole. That\u0027s what they call it when you\u0027re working high steel and you fall off a building, they call it going in the hole.\"\n \"Did someone push him?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. He could have been drunk and lost his balance, or he could have done the same thing cold sober, as far as that goes. Or maybe he gave somebody a reason to throw him off the building. I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know what happened to the kid, or to the mother. Probably nothing good, but that would just give them something in common with most of the rest of the world.\"\n \"And Mahaffey? I suppose he\u0027s gone by now.\"\n I nodded. \"He died in harness. They kept trying to retire him and he kept fighting it, and one day- I wasn\u0027t partnered with him by then, I had just made detective on the strength of a terrific collar that was ninety-eight percent luck- anyway, one day he was climbing the stairs of another tenement and his heart cut out on him. He was DOA at Kings County. At his wake everybody said that was the way he would have wanted it, but they got that wrong. I knew what he wanted. What he wanted was to live forever.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-26.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: \n A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
