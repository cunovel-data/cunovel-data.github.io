Gottschalk said he thought they had adhesive tape, and there wasn\u0027t any in the bathroom. They didn\u0027t leave the roll behind, or the twine either.\"\n \"I wonder why not.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. String savers, I guess. They took the pry bar, too. If I just left a woman dead in an apartment, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d want to walk down the street carrying burglar\u0027s tools, but if they were geniuses-\"\n \"They\u0027d be in some other line of work.\"\n \"Right. Why take the stuff? If Thurman was in on it, and if he was the one who bought the stuff, maybe they were afraid it could be traced. If they used what they found in the apartmentâ€¦ I don\u0027t know, Matt, the whole thing\u0027s so fucking speculative, you know?\"\n \"I know. You bat around the whys and what ifs, though, and sometimes something shakes loose.\"\n \"Which is why we\u0027re batting them around.\"\n \"Did he describe the burglars?\"\n \"Oh, sure. A little hazy on the details, but consistent from one interrogation to another. He didn\u0027t contradict himself enough to amount to anything. The descriptions are in the files, you\u0027ll see them for yourself. What they were, they were two big white guys about the same age as Thurman and his wife. They both had mustaches, and the bigger one had his hair long in the back, the way some of them wear it, with like a little tail growing down there?\"\n \"I know how you mean.\"\n \"A really classy style, marks you right away as a member of the upper crust. Like the spades with those high flattops, looks like they got a fez stuck on their heads, like they trim it with hedge clippers. Class all the way. What was I saying?\"\n \"The two burglars.\"\n \"Yeah, right. He went through the books of mug shots, very cooperative, very eager, but he didn\u0027t spot them. I sat him down with a police artist. I think you know him. Ray Galindez?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"He\u0027s good, but his sketches always come out looking Hispanic to me. There\u0027s copies in the file. I think one of the papers ran them.\"\n \"I must have missed it.\"\n \"I think it was Newsday. We got a couple calls and wasted a little time checking them out. Nothing. You know what I think?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think he did it all by himself.\"\n \"No, neither do I.\"\n \"I mean you can\u0027t positively rule it out, because he could have found a way to tie himself up, and he could have managed to lose the pry bar and the tape and the twine. But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what happened. I think he had help.\"\n \"I think you\u0027re right.\"\n \"He makes arrangements with a couple of skells, says here\u0027s a key to the front door, make it easy on yourselves, walk on in and go up three flights and bust into the fourth-floor apartment. Not to worry, there\u0027s nobody home, there won\u0027t be anybody home upstairs either. Make yourselves at home, dump the drawers, throw the books on the floor, and help yourselves to all the cash and jewelry you can find. Just so you\u0027re ready to go at twelve-thirty or one, whatever time we get home from the party.\"\n \"And they walk home because he doesn\u0027t want to get there too early.\"\n \"Maybe, or maybe they just walk home because it\u0027s a nice night. Who knows? They get to the Gottschalks\u0027 floor and she says, \u0027Oh, look, Ruth and Alfred\u0027s door is open,\u0027 and he shoves her through it and they grab her and knock her out and fuck her and kill her. Then he says, \u0027Hey, asshole, you don\u0027t want to walk down the street middle of the night carrying a television set, you can buy ten TVs with what I\u0027m paying you for this.\u0027 So they leave the set, but they take the twine and tape and pry bar because maybe they can be traced. No, that\u0027s bullshit, how do you trace drugstore and hardware store shit like that?\"\n \"They take the stuff because that way we\u0027ll know he couldn\u0027t have done it himself, because how could the twine and tape walk out of there under their own power?\"\n \"Right, okay. But first before they take anything out of there they knock him around a little, and they do some fairly impressive superficial damage, you\u0027ll see photos we took of him in the file. Then they tie him up and tape him up, his mouth, and maybe they rip it halfway off for him so he\u0027ll be able to make the call when it\u0027s time.\"\n \"Or maybe they\u0027ve got him tied loosely enough that he can get a hand free and do what he has to do and then slip it back under the twine.\"\n \"I was coming to that. Jesus, don\u0027t I wish those blues had been a little slower to cut him loose.\"\n I said, \"Anyway, they clear out and he waits as long as he can and then calls 911.\"\n \"Right. I don\u0027t see any holes in that.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"I mean, show me some other way it makes sense that he\u0027s alive. They just killed her, she\u0027s lying there dead, so why would they tie him up when it\u0027s so much easier to kill him?\"\n \"They already tied him up and taped his mouth before they did her.\"\n \"Oh, right, that\u0027s his story. Even so, why leave him alive? He can ID the both of them all day long, and they\u0027re already going to hang for doing her-\"\n \"Not in this state.\"\n \"Don\u0027t remind me, will you? Point is they\u0027re already down for Murder Two for doing her, they don\u0027t make it any worse for themselves by doing him while they\u0027re at it. They got the pry bar, all they gotta do is hit him a lick upside the head, as our little brown brothers would say.\"\n \"Maybe they did.\"\n \"Did what?\"\n \"Hit him hard enough so that they thought he was dead. Remember, they just killed her, and maybe they didn\u0027t plan on it, so-\"\n \"You mean if he\u0027s telling the truth.\"\n \"Right, playing devil\u0027s advocate for a minute. They killed her unintentionally-\"\n \"Just happened to get her panty hose accidentally wrapped around her throat-\"\n \"- and they don\u0027t exactly panic, but they\u0027re in a hurry, they hit him a shot and he\u0027s unconscious and they think he\u0027s probably dead, that hard a shot with a steel bar ought to kill a man, and all they want to do is get the fuck out, they don\u0027t want to take his pulse, see if he\u0027s got enough breath left to fog a mirror.\"\n \"Shit.\"\n \"You see what I mean.\"\n He sighed. \"Yeah, I see what you mean. That\u0027s why it\u0027s an open file. The evidence is inconclusive and the facts we\u0027ve got\u0027ll support any theory you want.\" He stood up. \"I want some coffee,\" he said. \"Can I get you some?\"\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"Why not?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know why the coffee\u0027s so bad,\" he said. \"I really don\u0027t. We used to have this machine, you know, coin-operated, and you can never get a halfway decent cup of coffee out of one of them. But we chipped in and bought one of these electric drip pots, and we use premium coffee, and it comes out tasting like this. I think there must be some law of nature, you\u0027re in a station house, the coffee has to taste like shit.\"\n It didn\u0027t taste that bad to me. He said, \"If we ever clear this one, you know how it\u0027ll happen.\"\n \"A snitch.\"\n \"A snitch hears something and passes it on, or one of the geniuses steps on his cock and we pick him up for something heavy, and he tries to do himself some good by ratting out his partner. And Thurman, assuming we\u0027re right and it was his game.\"\n \"Or even if it wasn\u0027t.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n I said, \" \u0027She was alive and kicking when we left there, man. We put the pork to her but I swear she liked that part of it, an\u0027 we sure didn\u0027t wrap no stockings around her neck. Musta been her husband, decided to get hisself an instant divorce.\u0027 \"\n \"Jesus, that\u0027s just how they\u0027d say it.\"\n \"I know. That\u0027s what they\u0027d say if Thurman was a hundred percent innocent. \u0027Wasn\u0027t me killed her, she was alive when I left.\u0027 And it could even be true.\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"Say it was a crime of opportunity. The Thurmans come home, walk in on a robbery in progress. The skells rob them and beat him up and rape her because they\u0027re animals, so why not act like it? Then they leave, and Thurman gets a hand free, and his wife\u0027s unconscious and he thinks she\u0027s dead-\"\n \"But she\u0027s not dead, but it gives him an idea-\"\n \"- and her panty hose is right there on the bed next to her, and next thing you know it\u0027s around her neck and this time she really is dead.\"\n He thought about it. \"Sure,\" he said. \"Could be. The medical examiner set the time of death at around one o\u0027clock, which squares with Thurman\u0027s story, but if he did her right after they left and then stalled a while, the time he was supposed to be unconscious and then struggling to free himself, well, that would all fit.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"And nobody could implicate him. They could say she was alive when they left, but that\u0027s something they\u0027d say anyway.\" He finished his coffee and threw the Styrofoam cup at the wastebasket. \"Fuck this,\" he said. \"You can go around and around. I think he did it. Whether he planned it or it fell in his lap, I think he did it. All that money.\"\n \"She inherited better than half a million, according to the brother.\"\n He nodded. \"Plus the insurance.\"\n \"He didn\u0027t say anything about insurance.\"\n \"It\u0027s possible nobody told him. They took out policies payable to each other shortly after they were married. Hundred-thousand-dollar straight life, double indemnity for accidental death.\"\n \"Well, that sweetens it a little,\" I said. \"Raises the ante by two hundred kay.\"\n He shook his head.\n \"Am I figuring wrong?\"\n \"Uh-huh. She got pregnant in September. Soon as they found out, he got in touch with his insurance agent and raised the amount of their coverage. A baby coming, increased responsibilities. Makes sense, right?\"\n \"What did he raise it to?\"\n \"A million on his own life. After all, he\u0027s the breadwinner, his income\u0027s gonna be tough to replace. Still, her role\u0027s important, so he boosted her coverage to a half mil.\"\n \"So her death-\"\n \"Meant an even million in insurance, because they still had the double-indemnity clause, plus all of her property that he\u0027ll inherit. Round it off, call it a total of a million and a half.\"\n \"Jesus.\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"Jesus Christ.\"\n \"Yeah, right. He\u0027s got means and motive and opportunity, and he\u0027s a heartless little fuck if I ever saw one, and I couldn\u0027t find a shred of evidence to show that he\u0027s guilty of a single fucking thing.\" He closed his eyes for a moment, then looked up at me. \"Can I ask you something?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"Do you use the dental floss?\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"Aspirin and dental floss, you said that\u0027s all you\u0027ve got in your medicine chest. Do you ever use it?\"\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"When I remember. My dentist nagged me into buying it.\"\n \"Same here, but I never use it.\"\n \"Neither do I, really. The good news is we\u0027ll never run out.\"\n \"That\u0027s it,\" he said. \"We got a fucking lifetime supply.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-6.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: \n A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
