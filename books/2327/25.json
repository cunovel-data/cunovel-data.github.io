{"id":63548,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"I thought of Durkin and the hundred dollars I\u0027d given him. \"I shouldn\u0027t take this from you,\" he\u0027d said. But he hadn\u0027t given it back. \"I never touched cocaine again,\" Mick said. \"And do you know why? Because it was too fucking good. I don\u0027t ever want to feel that good again.\" He brandished the bottle. \"This lets me feel as good as I need to feel. Anything more than that is unnatural. It\u0027s worse than that, it\u0027s fucking dangerous. I hate the stuff. I hate the rich bastards with their jade snuff bottles and gold spoons and silver straws. I hate the ones who smoke it on the streetcorners. My God, what it\u0027s doing to the city. There was a cop on television tonight saying you should lock your doors when you\u0027re riding in a taxi. Because when your cab stops for a light they\u0027ll come in after you and rob you. Can you imagine?\" \"It keeps getting worse out there.\" \"It does,\" he said. He took a drink and I watched him savor the whiskey in his mouth before he swallowed it. I knew what the JJ\u0026S twelve-year-old tasted like. I used to drink it with Billie Keegan years ago when he tended bar for Jimmy. I could taste it now, but somehow the sense-memory didn\u0027t make me crave a drink, nor did it make me fear the dormant thirst within me. A drink was the last thing I wanted on nights like this. I had tried to explain it to Jim Faber, who was understandably uncertain of the wisdom of my spending long nights in a saloon watching another man drink. The best I could do was to suggest that somehow Ballou was drinking for both of us, that the whiskey that went down his throat quenched my thirst as well as his own, and left me sober in the process. HE said, \"I went to Queens again Sunday night.\" \"Not to Maspeth.\" \"No, not to Maspeth. Another part entirely. Jamaica Estates. Do you know it?\" \"I have a vague idea of where it is.\" \"You go out Grand Central Parkway and get off at Utopia. The house we were looking for was on a little street off Croydon Road. I couldn\u0027t tell you what the neighborhood looked like. It was full dark when we went out there. Three of us, and Andy driving. He\u0027s a grand driver, did I tell you?\" \"You told me.\" \"They were expecting us, but they didn\u0027t expect we\u0027d have guns in our hands. Spanish they were, from somewhere in South America. A man and his wife and the wife\u0027s mother. They were dope dealers, they sold cocaine by the kilo. \"We asked him where his money was. No money, he said. They had cocaine to sell, they didn\u0027t have any cash. Now I knew they had money in the house. They\u0027d had a big sale the day before and they still had some of the money around.\" \"How did you know?\" \"From the lad who gave me the address and told me how to get through the door. Well, I took the man in a bedroom and tried to talk sense to him. Talked with my hands, you might say. He stuck fast to his story, the little greaseball. \"And then one of the lads comes in with a baby. \u0027Get up off the money,\u0027 he tells the man, \u0027or I\u0027ll cut the wee bastard\u0027s throat.\u0027 And the babe\u0027s screaming through all this. No one\u0027s hurting him, you understand, but he\u0027s hungry or he wants his mother. You know how it is with babies.\" \"What happened?\" \"If you can believe this,\" he said, \"the father as much as says we can go to hell. \u0027I don\u0027t think you do thees,\u0027 he says, looking me right in the eye. \" \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 I told him. \u0027I don\u0027t kill babies.\u0027 And I told my man to take the babe to its mother and have her change his diaper or give him a bottle, whatever would stop his crying.\" He straightened up in his chair. \"And then I took the father,\" he said, \"and I put him in a chair, and I left the room and came back wearing my father\u0027s apron. One of the lads- Tom it was, you know Tom, behind the bar most afternoons.\" \"Yes.\" \"Tom had a gun to his head, and I had the big cleaver that was my father\u0027s also. I went over and tried it out on the bedside table, just took a good whack at it and it collapsed into a pile of kindling. Then I took hold of his arm just above the wrist, pinning it to the arm of the chair, and with my other hand I raised up the cleaver. \" \u0027Now, you spic bastard,\u0027 I said, \u0027where\u0027s your money, or don\u0027t you theenk I\u0027ll take your fucking hand off?\u0027 \" He smiled with satisfaction at the memory. \"The money was in the laundry room, in the vent pipe for the dryer. You could have turned the house upside down and never found it. We were out of there in no time, and Andy had us safely home. I\u0027d have been lost out there, but he knew all the turns.\" I got up and went behind the bar to pour myself another cup of coffee. When I got back to the table Mick was gazing off to one side. I sat down and waited for the coffee to cool and we both let the silence stretch for a while. Then he said, \"We left them alive, the whole household. I don\u0027t know, that could have been a bad idea.\" \"They wouldn\u0027t call the police.\" \"They couldn\u0027t do that, and they weren\u0027t well connected, so I didn\u0027t think they\u0027d come back at us. And we left the cocaine. There was ten kilos of it that we found, shaped like little footballs. \u0027I\u0027m leaving you your coca,\u0027 I told him, \u0027and I\u0027m leaving you alive. But if you ever come back at me,\u0027 I said, \u0027then I\u0027ll come back here. And I\u0027ll wear this\u0027- pointing to the apron- \u0027and I\u0027ll carry this\u0027- the cleaver- \u0027and I\u0027ll lop off your hands and feet and whatever else I can think of.\u0027 I\u0027d do no such thing, of course. I\u0027d just kill him and be done with it. But you can\u0027t scare a drug dealer by telling him you\u0027ll kill him. They all know somebody will kill them sooner or later. Tell them you\u0027ll leave them with some pieces missing, though, and the picture sticks in their mind.\" He filled his glass and took a drink. \"I didn\u0027t want to kill him,\" he said, \"because I\u0027d have had to kill the wife too, and the old woman. I\u0027d leave the baby because a baby can\u0027t pick you out of a lineup, but what kind of a life would I be leaving it? It\u0027s got a bad enough life already, with that for a father. \"Because look how he called my bluff. \u0027I don\u0027t think you do thees.\u0027 The bastard didn\u0027t care if I did it. Go ahead, kill the baby, he can always start another one. But when it was a question of his hand winding up on the floor, why, he wasn\u0027t so fucking tough then, was he?\" A little later he said, \"Sometimes you have to kill them. One runs for the door and you drop him, and then you have to take out all the rest of them. Or you know they\u0027re not people who will let it go, and it\u0027s kill them or watch your back for the rest of your life. What you do then is scatter the drugs all over the place. Grind the bricks to powder, pour it on the bodies, tread it into the rug. Let it look like dealers killing each other. The cops don\u0027t break their necks to solve that kind of killing.\" \"Don\u0027t you ever take the drugs along?\" \"I don\u0027t,\" he said, \"and I\u0027m giving up a fortune, and I just don\u0027t care. There\u0027s so much money in it. You wouldn\u0027t have to deal in it, you could sell the lot to someone. It wouldn\u0027t be hard to find someone who wanted to buy it.\" \"No, I don\u0027t suppose it would.\" \"But I\u0027ll have no part of it, and I won\u0027t work with anyone who\u0027ll use it or traffic in it. The cocaine I left behind the other night, I could have got more for it than I took in cash from the dryer vent. There was only eighty thousand there.\" He lifted his glass, set it down again. \"There should have been more. I know he had another stash somewhere in the fucking house, but I\u0027d have had to chop off his hand to get it. And that would have meant killing him after, and killing the lot of them. And calling the police later, telling them there was a baby crying in a house on such-and-such a street.\" \"Better to take the eighty thousand.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought,\" he said. \"But there\u0027s four thousand right off the top for the lad who told us where to go and how to get in. A finder\u0027s fee, you call it. Five percent, and I shouldn\u0027t wonder he thought we got more and were cheating him. Four thousand for him, and a good night\u0027s pay for Tom and Andy and the fourth fellow, whom you don\u0027t know. And what\u0027s left for myself is a little less than what I paid to get Andy off the hook for the hijacking.\" He shook his head. \"I always need money,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t understand it.\" I talked some about Richard Thurman and his dead wife, and about the man we\u0027d seen at the fights in Maspeth. I took out the sketch and he looked at it. \"It\u0027s very like him,\" he said. \"And the man who drew it never saw the man he was drawing? You wouldn\u0027t think it could be done.\" I put the sketch away and he said, \"Do you believe in hell?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Ah, you\u0027re fortunate. I believe in it. I believe there\u0027s a place reserved for me there, a chair by the fire.\" \"Do you really believe that, Mick?\" \"I don\u0027t know about the fire, or little devils with fucking pitchforks. I believe there\u0027s something for you after you die, and if you lead a bad life you\u0027ve got a bad lot ahead of you. And I don\u0027t lead the life of a saint.\" \"No.\" \"I kill people. I only do it out of need, but I lead a life that makes killing a requirement.\" He looked hard at me. \"And I don\u0027t mind the killing,\" he said. \"There are times I have a taste for it. Can you understand that?\" \"Yes.\" \"But to kill a wife for the insurance money, or to kill a child for pleasure.\" He frowned. \"Or taking a woman against her will. There\u0027s more men than you\u0027d think who\u0027ll do that last. You\u0027d think it was just the twisted ones but sometimes I think it\u0027s half the human race. Half the male sex, anyway.\" \"I know,\" I said. \"When I was at the Academy they taught us that rape was a crime of anger toward women, that it wasn\u0027t sexual at all. But over the years I stopped believing that. Half the time nowadays it seems to be a crime of opportunity, a way to have sex without taking her to dinner first. You\u0027re committing a robbery or a burglary, there\u0027s a woman there, she looks good to you, so why not?\" He nodded. \"Another time,\" he said. \"Like last night, but over the river in Jersey. Dope dealers in a fine house out in the country, and we were going to have to kill everybody in the house. We knew that before we went in.\" He drank whiskey and sighed. \"I\u0027ll go to hell for sure. Oh, they were killers themselves, but that\u0027s no excuse, is it?\" \"Maybe it is,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"It\u0027s not.\" He put the glass down and wrapped his hand around the bottle but didn\u0027t lift it from the table. \"I\u0027d just shot the man,\" he said, \"and one of the lads was searching for more cash, and I heard cries coming from another room. So I went in there, and there\u0027s one of the boys on top of the woman, with her skirt up and her clothes ripped, and she\u0027s fighting him and crying out.\" \" \u0027Get off her,\u0027 I told him, and he looked at me like I was mad. She was choice, he said, and we were going to kill her anyway, so why shouldn\u0027t he have her before she was no use to anybody?\" \"What did you do?\" \"I kicked him,\" he said. \"I kicked him hard enough to break three ribs, and then before I did anything else I shot her between the eyes, because she shouldn\u0027t have to put up with more of it. And then I picked him up and threw him against the wall, and when he came stumbling off it I hit him in the face. I wanted to kill him, but there were people who knew he\u0027d worked for me and it would be like leaving a calling card behind. I took him away from there and paid him his share and got a closemouthed doctor to bandage his ribs, and then I packed him off. He was from Philadelphia, and I told him to go back there, that he was finished in New York. I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t know to this day what he did that was wrong. She was going to die anyway, so why not have the use of her first? And why not roast her liver and eat it, why let the flesh go to waste?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-25.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
