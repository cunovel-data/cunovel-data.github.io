That I see clients.\"\n \"Sometimes it does. Most of the time it doesn\u0027t.\"\n \"I\u0027ll probably stop sooner or later,\" she said. \"You can only keep on pitching for so long. Even Tommy John had to pack it in, and he had a bionic arm.\" She rolled onto her side to face me, put a hand on my leg. \"If you asked me to stop, I probably would.\"\n \"And then resent me for it.\"\n \"You think so? Am I that neurotic?\" She thought it over. \"Yeah,\" she said, \"I probably am.\"\n \"Anyway, I wouldn\u0027t ask you.\"\n \"No, you\u0027d rather have the resentment.\" She rolled over and lay on her back, gazing up at the ceiling. After a moment she said, \"I\u0027d give it up if we got married.\"\n There was silence, and then a cascade of descending notes and a surprising atonal chord from the stereo.\n \"If you pretend you didn\u0027t hear that,\" Elaine said, \"I\u0027ll pretend I didn\u0027t say it. We never even say the L word and I went and said the M word.\"\n \"It\u0027s a dangerous place,\" I said, \"out there in the middle of the alphabet.\"\n \"I know. I should learn to stay in the F\u0027s where I belong. I don\u0027t want to get married. I like things just the way they are. Can\u0027t they just stay that way?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"I feel sad. That\u0027s crazy, what the hell have I got to feel sad about? All of a sudden I\u0027m all weepy.\"\n \"That\u0027s okay.\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to cry. But hold me for a minute, okay? You big old bear. Just hold me.\"\n Chapter 9\n Sunday afternoon I found my film buff.\n His name, according to Phil Fielding\u0027s records, was Arnold Leveque, and he lived on Columbus Avenue half a dozen blocks north of the video store. His building was a tenement that had thus far escaped gentrification. Two men sat on the stoop drinking beer out of cans in brown paper bags. One of them had a little girl on his lap. She was drinking orange juice out of a baby bottle.\n None of the doorbells had Leveque\u0027s name on it. I went out and asked the two men on the stoop if Arnold Leveque lived there. They shrugged and shook their heads. I went inside and couldn\u0027t find a bell for the super, so I rang bells on the first floor until someone buzzed me in.\n The hallway smelled of mice and urine. At the far end a door opened and a man stuck his head out. I walked toward him, and he said, \"What do you want? Don\u0027t come too close now.\"\n \"Easy,\" I said.\n \"You take it easy,\" he said. \"I got a knife.\"\n I held my hands at my sides, showing the palms. I told him I was looking for a man named Arnold Leveque.\n He said, \"Oh, yeah? I hope he don\u0027t owe you money.\"\n \"Why\u0027s that?\"\n \" \u0027Cause he\u0027s dead,\" he said, and he laughed hard at his joke. He was an old man with wispy white hair and deep eye sockets, and he looked as though he\u0027d be joining Leveque before too many months passed. His pants were loose and he held them up with suspenders. His flannel shirt hung on him, too. Either he got his clothes at a thrift shop or he\u0027d lost a lot of weight recently.\n Reading my mind, he said, \"I been sick, but don\u0027t worry. It ain\u0027t catching.\"\n \"I\u0027m more afraid of the knife.\"\n \"Ah, Jesus,\" he said. He showed me a French chef\u0027s knife with a wooden handle and a ten-inch carbon-steel blade. \"Come on in,\" he said. \"I ain\u0027t about to cut you, for Christ\u0027s sake.\" He led the way, setting the knife down on a little table near the door.\n His apartment was tiny, two narrow little rooms. The only illumination came from a three-bulb ceiling fixture in the larger room. Two of the bulbs had burned out and the remaining one couldn\u0027t have been more than forty watts. He kept the place tidy but it had a smell to it, an odor of age and illness.\n \"Arnie Leveque,\" he said. \"How\u0027d you know him?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t.\"\n \"No?\" He yanked a handkerchief out of his back pocket and coughed into it. \"Dammit,\" he said. \"The bastards cut me from asshole to appetite but it didn\u0027t do no good. I waited too long. See, I was afraid of what they\u0027d find.\" He laughed harshly. \"Well, I was right, wasn\u0027t I?\"\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"He was okay, Leveque. French Canadian, but he musta been born here because he talked like anybody else.\"\n \"Did he live here a long time?\"\n \"What\u0027s a long time? I been here forty-two years. Can you believe that? Forty-two years in this shithole. Be forty-three years in September, but I expect to be out of here by then. Moved to smaller quarters.\" He laughed again and it turned into a coughing fit and he reached for the handkerchief. He got the cough under control and said, \"Smaller quarters, like a box about six feet long, you know what I mean?\"\n \"I guess it helps to joke about it.\"\n \"Naw, it don\u0027t help,\" he said. \"Nothing helps. I guess Arnie lived here about ten years. Give or take, you know? He kept to his room a lot. Of course the way he was you wouldn\u0027t expect him to go tap-dancing down the street.\" I must have looked puzzled, because he said, \"Oh, I forgot, you didn\u0027t know him. He was fat as a pig, Arnie was.\" He put his hands out in front of him and drew them apart as he lowered them. \"Pear-shaped. Waddled like a duck. He was up on three, too, so he had two flights of stairs to climb if he went anywhere.\"\n \"How old was he?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Forty? It\u0027s hard to tell when somebody\u0027s fat like that.\"\n \"What did he do?\"\n \"For a living? I don\u0027t know. Had a job he went to. Then he wasn\u0027t going out so much.\"\n \"I understand he liked movies.\"\n \"Oh, he sure did. He had one of those things, what the hell do they call it, you watch movies on your TV set.\"\n \"A VCR.\"\n \"It woulda come to me in a minute.\"\n \"What happened to him?\"\n \"Leveque? Ain\u0027t you paying attention? He died.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"They killed him,\" he said. \"What do you think?\"\n IT was a generic they, as it turned out. Arnold Leveque had died on the street, presumably the victim of a mugging. It was getting worse every year, the old man told me, what with people smoking crack and living on the street. They would kill you for subway fare, he said, and think nothing of it.\n I asked when all this had happened, and he said it must have been a year ago. I said that Leveque had still been alive in April- Fielding\u0027s records indicated his most recent transaction had been on the nineteenth of that month- and he said he didn\u0027t have that good a head for dates anymore.\n He told me how to find the super. \"She don\u0027t do much,\" he said. \"She collects the rents, that\u0027s about all.\" When I asked his name he said it was Gus, and when I asked his last name a sly look came over his face. \"Just Gus is good enough. Why tell you my name when you ain\u0027t told me yours?\"\n I gave him one of my cards. He held it at arm\u0027s length and squinted at it, reading my name aloud. He asked if he could keep the card and I said he could.\n \"When I meet up with Arnie,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll tell him you was looking for him.\" And he laughed and laughed.\n GUS\u0027s last name was Giesekind. I found that out by checking his mailbox, which shows I\u0027m no slouch as a detective. The super\u0027s name was Herta Eigen, and I found her two doors up the street where she had a basement apartment. She was a small woman, barely five feet tall, with a Central European accent and a wary, suspicious little face. She flexed her fingers as she talked. They were misshapen by arthritis but moved nimbly enough.\n \"The cops came,\" she said. \"Took me downtown somewhere, made me look at him.\"\n \"To identify him?\"\n She nodded. \" \u0027That\u0027s him,\u0027 I said. \u0027That\u0027s Leveque.\u0027 They bring me back here and I got to let them into his room. They walked in and I walked in after them. \u0027You can go now, Mrs. Eigen.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s all right,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027ll stay.\u0027 Because some of them are all right but some of them would steal the money off a dead man\u0027s eyes. Is that the expression?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"The pennies off a dead man\u0027s eyes. Pennies, not money.\" She sighed. \"So they finish poking around and I let them out and lock up after them, and I ask what do I do now, will somebody come for his things, and they say they\u0027ll be in touch. Which they never were.\"\n \"You never heard from them?\"\n \"Nothing. Nobody tells me if his people are coming for his belongings, or what I\u0027m supposed to do. When I didn\u0027t hear from them I called the precinct. They don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about. I guess so many people get murdered nobody can bother to keep track.\" She shrugged. \"Me, I got an apartment, I got to rent it, you know? I left the furniture, I brought everything else down here. When nobody came I got rid of it.\"\n \"You sold the videocassettes.\"\n \"The movies? I took them over on Broadway, he gave me a few dollars. Was that wrong?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t stealing. If he had family I would give it all to them, but he had nobody. He lived here for many years, Mr. Leveque. He was here already when I got this job.\"\n \"When was that?\"\n \"Six years ago. Wait a minute, I\u0027m wrong, seven years.\"\n \"You\u0027re just the superintendent?\"\n \"What else should I be, the queen of England?\"\n \"I knew a woman who was a landlady but she let on to the tenants that she was only the super.\"\n \"Oh, sure,\" she said. \"I own the building, that\u0027s why I live in the basement. I\u0027m a rich woman, I just have this love for living in the ground like a mole.\"\n \"Who does own the building?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" I looked at her and she said, \"Sue me, I don\u0027t know. Who knows? There\u0027s a management company that hired me. I collect the rent, I give it to them, they do whatever they want with it. The landlord I never met. Does it matter who it is?\"\n I couldn\u0027t see how. I asked when Arnold Leveque had died.\n \"Last spring,\" she said. \"Closer than that I couldn\u0027t tell you.\"\n I went back to my hotel room and turned on the TV. Three different channels had college basketball games. It was too frenzied and I couldn\u0027t bear to watch. I found a tennis match on one of the cable channels and it was restful by comparison. I don\u0027t know that it would be accurate to say that I watched it, but I did sit in front of the set with my eyes open while they hit the ball back and forth over the net.\n I met Jim for dinner at a Chinese restaurant on Ninth Avenue. We often had Sunday dinner there. The place never filled up and they didn\u0027t care how long we sat there or how many times they had to refill our teapot. The food\u0027s not bad, and I don\u0027t know why they don\u0027t do more business.\n He said, \"Did you happen to read the Times today? There was an article, an interview with this Catholic priest who writes hot novels. I can\u0027t think of his name.\"\n \"I know who you mean.\"\n \"He had this telephone poll to back him up, and he said how only ten percent of the married population of this country have ever committed adultery. Nobody cheats, that\u0027s his contention, and he can prove it because somebody called a bunch of people on the phone and that\u0027s what they told him.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-17.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: \n A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
