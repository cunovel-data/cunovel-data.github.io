He said, \"I\u0027d say they deserved killing.\" \"Do you think so?\" \"If anyone ever did.\" \"I guess we all deserve killing,\" I said. \"Maybe that\u0027s why nobody ever gets out of here alive. I don\u0027t know where I get off deciding who deserves killing and who doesn\u0027t. We left four people dead back there and two of them I never even met. Did they deserve killing?\" \"They had guns in their hands. Nobody drafted them, not for that war.\" \"But did they deserve it? If we all got what we deserved-\" \"Oh, Jesus forbid it,\" he said. \"Matt, I have to ask you this. Why did you shoot the woman?\" \"Somebody had to.\" \"It needn\u0027t have been yourself.\" \"No.\" I took a moment and thought about it. \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I said at last. \"There\u0027s only one thing I can think of.\" \"Let\u0027s hear it, man.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know,\" I said, \"but I think maybe I wanted to get some blood on my apron.\" SUNDAY I had dinner with Jim Faber. I told him the whole story all the way through, and we never did get to a meeting that night. We were still in the Chinese restaurant when they were saying the Lord\u0027s Prayer. \"Well, it\u0027s a hell of a story,\" he said. \"And I guess you could say it has a happy ending, because you didn\u0027t drink and you aren\u0027t going to go to jail. Or are you?\" \"No.\" \"It must be an interesting feeling, playing judge and jury, deciding who gets to live and who deserves to die. Like playing God, I guess you could say.\" \"You could say that.\" \"You think you\u0027ll make a habit of it?\" I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever do it again. But I never thought I would do it at all. I\u0027ve done unorthodox things over the years, both on and off the force. I\u0027ve fabricated evidence, I\u0027ve distorted situations.\" \"This was a little different.\" \"It was a lot different. See, I saw that tape during the summer and I never really did get it out of my mind. And then I ran into the son of a bitch by pure chance, recognized him from a gesture, the way he smoothed a boy\u0027s hair back on his head. Probably something his own father used to do.\" \"Why do you say that?\" \"Because something or other turned him into a monster. Maybe his father abused him, maybe he was raped in childhood. That\u0027s one of the ways it works. It wouldn\u0027t have been all that hard to understand Stettner. To sympathize with him.\" \"That\u0027s something I noticed,\" he said. \"When you were talking about him. I never got the feeling that you hated him.\" \"Why should I hate him? He was quite charming. His manners were good, he was witty, he had a sense of humor. If you want to divide the world into good men and bad men, he was certainly one of the bad ones. But I don\u0027t know if you can do that. I used to be able to. It\u0027s harder than it once was.\" I leaned forward. \"They would have kept on doing it,\" I said. \"They were recreational killers, they did it for the sport of it. They enjoyed it. I can\u0027t understand that, but there are plenty of people who can\u0027t understand how I can enjoy watching a boxing match. Maybe what people do and don\u0027t enjoy is yet another area that\u0027s beyond judgment. \"But here\u0027s the point. They were doing this and getting away with it, and I got on their case and got lucky and figured out what they did and how they did it and who they did it to, and it didn\u0027t mean squat. No indictment, no arrest, no charges brought, not even an investigation. A pretty good cop found the whole thing so frustrating he drank himself stupid. I wasn\u0027t prepared to do that myself.\" \"Well, you got that part right,\" he said. \"And then you decided, well, letting the Universe work this out on its own is just not something I can safely do. God\u0027s in deep shit, you told yourself, unless He\u0027s got me to help Him out.\" \"God,\" I said. \"Well, whatever the hell you want to call it. Your Higher Power, the creative force of the Universe, the Great Perhaps. That\u0027s what Rabelais called it. The Great Perhaps. You didn\u0027t figure the Great Perhaps was equal to the task confronting Him, so it was up to you to take over.\" \"No,\" I said. \"That\u0027s not how it was.\" \"Tell me.\" \"I thought, I can let go of this, I can turn this over, and it will all work out the way it\u0027s supposed to. Because everything always does. I know that on the days when I seem to believe in the Great Perhaps, and I still know it when my Higher Power is the Great Perhaps Not. And one thing I always know for sure- whether or not there\u0027s a God, I\u0027m not it.\" \"Then why did you do what you did?\" \"Because I just plain wanted them dead,\" I said. \"And I just flat out wanted to be the sonofabitch who did it to them. And no, I\u0027m not going to do it again.\" \"You took the money.\" \"Yes.\" \"Thirty-five, you said it was?\" \"Thirty-five a man. Mick\u0027s end must have run to a quarter of a million. Of course there was a lot of foreign currency. I don\u0027t know how he\u0027ll make out when he unloads it.\" \"He gets the lion\u0027s share.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"And what do you do with yours?\" \"I don\u0027t know. For now it\u0027s in the safe-deposit box, along with the cassette that got the whole thing started. I\u0027ll probably give a tenth of it to Testament House. That seems like a logical place to donate it.\" \"You could give it all to Testament House.\" \"I could,\" I agreed, \"but I don\u0027t think I will. I think I\u0027ll keep the rest of it. Why the hell shouldn\u0027t I? I worked for it.\" \"I guess you did at that.\" \"And I ought to have a little money of my own if I marry Elaine.\" \"Are you going to marry Elaine?\" \"How the hell do I know?\" \"Uh-huh. Why\u0027d you go to mass?\" \"I\u0027ve gone with Ballou before. I guess the current term for it is \u0027male bonding.\u0027 All I know is it seems to be an occasional part of our friendship.\" \"Why\u0027d you take Communion?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"You must have some idea.\" \"No,\" I said, \"I really don\u0027t. There are lots of things I do without knowing why the hell I do them. Half the time I don\u0027t know why I stay sober, if you want to know the truth, and back when I drank all the time I didn\u0027t know why I did that either.\" \"Uh-huh. What happens next?\" \"Stay tuned,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t change the channel.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-44.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
