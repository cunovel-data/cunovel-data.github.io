{"id":63565,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"I handed him the cassette and he read the title aloud and laughed. \"So Leveque was not without a sense of humor after all,\" he said. \"He kept it well hidden during his lifetime. If you want to authenticate your end of the proceedings, just open the attachй case.\" I worked the snaps and raised the lid. The case held stacks of twenty-dollar bills secured with rubber bands. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind twenties,\" he said. \"You didn\u0027t specify denomination.\" \"That\u0027s fine.\" \"Fifty stacks, fifty bills to a stack. Why don\u0027t you count it?\" \"I\u0027ll trust your count.\" \"I should be as gracious and trust that this is the tape Leveque made. But I think I\u0027ll play it to make sure.\" \"Why not? I opened the case.\" \"Yes, that would have been an act of faith, wouldn\u0027t it? To accept the attachй case unopened. Olga, you were right. I like this man.\" He clapped a hand on my shoulder. \"You know something, Scudder? I think we will be friends, you and I. I think we are destined to become very close.\" I remembered what he had told Richard Thurman. \"We are closer than close, you and I. We are brothers in blood and semen.\" He played the cassette and turned the sound off. He fast-forwarded through the opening in fits and starts, and there was a moment when I thought I\u0027d got everything ass-backward at the bank and we were going to be watching the standard unimproved version of The Dirty Dozen. It wouldn\u0027t have mattered what was on the tape if Mick Ballou would get off his ass and hit the door, but things seemed to be dragging out. \"Ah,\" Stettner said. And I relaxed, because we were watching their home movie now. Stettner stood with his hands on his hips, gazing attentively at the screen. The set was larger than Elaine\u0027s, and the image somewhat more compelling as a result. I found my own attention drawn to it in spite of myself. Olga, drawing closer to her husband\u0027s side, was staring at it as if hypnotized. \"What a beautiful woman you are,\" Stettner told her. To me he said, \"Here she is in the flesh, but I have to see her on the screen to appreciate how beautiful she is. Curious, don\u0027t you think?\" Whatever my reply might have been, it was lost forever when gunfire rang out somewhere in the building. There were two shots close together, then a brace of answering shots. Stettner said, \"Jesus Christ!\" and spun around to face the door. I was moving the minute the sounds registered for what they were. I stepped backward, yanked the tail of my suit jacket aside with my left hand, went for my gun with my right. I had it in my hand and got my finger on the trigger and my thumb on the hammer. The wall was at my back, and I could cover them and see the door to the hall all at the same time. \"Freeze,\" I said. \"Nobody move.\" On the screen, Olga had mounted the boy, impaling herself upon his penis. She rode him furiously in utter silence. I could see her performance out of the corner of my eye, but Bergen and Olga were no longer watching. They stood side by side and looked at me and the gun in my hand, and all three of us were as silent as the pair on the screen. A single gunshot broke the silence. Then it returned, and then it was broken again by footsteps on the stairs. THERE were more footsteps in the hall, and the sounds of doors being opened and closed. Stettner seemed about to say something. Then I heard Ballou call my name. \"In here,\" I shouted back. \"End of the hall.\" He came flying into the room, the big automatic looking like a child\u0027s toy in his huge hand. He was wearing his father\u0027s apron. His face was twisted with rage. \"Tom\u0027s shot,\" he said. \"Bad?\" \"Not so bad, but he\u0027s down. \u0027Twas a fucking trap, we came through the door and there was two of \u0027em in the shadows with guns in their hands. Good job they were bad shots, but Tom caught a bullet before I could take them down.\" He was breathing heavily, taking in great gulps of air. \"I shot one dead and put the other down with two shots in his gut. Just now I stuck the pistol in his mouth and blew the back of his fucking head off. Dirty bastard, shooting a man from ambush.\" That\u0027s why Stettner had seemed to be performing when he opened the door for me. He\u0027d had an audience after all, guards hidden in the shadows. \"Where\u0027s the money, man? Let\u0027s get it and get Tom to a doctor.\" \"There\u0027s your money,\" Stettner said grimly. He pointed at the still-open attachй case. \"All you had to do was take it and go. There was no need for any of this.\" \"You had guards posted,\" I said. \"Purely as a precautionary measure, and it seems I was right to be cautious. Though it didn\u0027t do much good, did it?\" He shrugged. \"There\u0027s your money,\" he said again. \"Take it and get out of here.\" \"It\u0027s fifty thousand,\" I told Ballou. \"But there\u0027s more in the safe.\" He looked at the big Mosler, then at Stettner. \"Open it,\" he said. \"There\u0027s nothing in it.\" \"Open the fucking safe!\" \"Nothing but more tapes, though none as successful as the one playing now. It\u0027s interesting, don\u0027t you think?\" Ballou glanced at the television set, seeing it for the first time. He took a second or two to register the action unfolding in silence, then pointed the SIG Sauer and squeezed off a shot, his hand rock-solid against the gun\u0027s considerable recoil. The set\u0027s picture tube exploded and the noise was immense. \"Open the safe,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t keep money here. I keep some in safe-deposit boxes and the rest in the safe at my office.\" \"Open it or you\u0027re dead.\" \"I don\u0027t think I can,\" Stettner said coolly. \"I can never remember the combination.\" Ballou grabbed him by his shirtfront and threw him against the wall, backhanding him across the face. Stettner never lost his composure. A little blood trickled from one nostril, but if he was aware of it he gave no sign. \"This is silly,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not going to open the safe. If I open it we\u0027re dead.\" \"You\u0027re dead if you don\u0027t,\" Ballou said. \"Only if you\u0027re an idiot. If we\u0027re alive we can get you more money. If we\u0027re dead you\u0027ll never get into that safe.\" \"We\u0027re dead anyway,\" Olga said. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Stettner told her. To Ballou he said, \"You can beat us if you want. You have the gun, you\u0027re in charge. But don\u0027t you see it\u0027s pointless? And meanwhile your man Tom lies bleeding upstairs. He\u0027ll die while you waste your time trying to persuade me to open an empty safe. Why not save time and take your fifty thousand and get your man the medical attention he requires?\" Mick looked at me. He asked me what I figured was in the safe. \"Something good,\" I said, \"or he would have opened it by now.\" He nodded slowly, then turned and set down the SIG Sauer next to the attachй case. I was still covering the two of them with the.38 Smith. From a pocket in the butcher\u0027s apron he produced a cleaver, its blade snug in a leather sheath. He drew it from the sheath. The blade was carbon steel, discolored through years of use. It looked intimidating enough to me, but Stettner eyed it with apparent contempt. \"Open the safe,\" Ballou told him. \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"I\u0027ll hack her fine tits off,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll chop her into cat meat.\" \"That won\u0027t put money in your pocket, will it?\" I thought of the drug dealer in Jamaica Estates, and the bluff he\u0027d felt safe enough to call. I didn\u0027t know if Mick was bluffing and I wasn\u0027t eager to find out. He grabbed her by the forearm, yanked her toward him. \"Wait,\" I said. He looked at me, fury glinting in his eyes. \"The pictures,\" I said. \"What are you talking about, man?\" I pointed at the little Corot. \"That\u0027s worth more than he\u0027s got in the safe,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t want to try to sell a fucking painting.\" \"Neither do I,\" I said, and I swung the gun around and snapped off a shot that caromed off the wall just inches to the side of the painting. It chipped the concrete, and it put a dent in Stettner\u0027s sangfroid. \"I\u0027ll shoot the shit out of it,\" I told him. \"And the others.\" I swung the gun toward the pair of portraits and squeezed the trigger without actually aiming. The bullet went through the portrait of the woman, making a small round hole just inches from her forehead. \"My God,\" Stettner said. \"You are vandals.\" \"It\u0027s just paint and canvas,\" I said. \"My God. I\u0027ll open the safe.\" He worked the combination swiftly and surely. The turning of the dial was the only sound you could hear. I was holding on to the Smith and breathing in the smell of cordite. The gun was heavy and my hand ached slightly from the gun\u0027s recoil. I longed to put it down. There was no reason to point it at anyone. Stettner was busy with the safe, Olga frozen with dread and incapable of movement. Stettner hit the last number, turned the handle, drew open the twin doors. We all looked within at the stacks of bills. I was to the side, my view partly screened by the other two men. I saw Stettner\u0027s hand dart into the open safe and I cried out, \"Mick, he\u0027s got a gun!\" In a film they would show the scene in slow motion, and what\u0027s curious is that\u0027s the way I remember it. Stettner\u0027s hand reaching in, fastening on a little blued-steel automatic pistol. Mick\u0027s hand, gripping the huge cleaver, poised high overhead, then flashing down in a deadly arc. The blade biting cleanly, surgically, through the wrist. The hand appearing to leap forward, away from the blade, as if liberated from its arm. Stettner spun around, away from the open safe, facing toward us. His face was white, his mouth wide with horror. He held his arm in front of him like a shield. Arterial blood, bright as sunrise, spurted wildly from his mutilated arm. He lurched forward, his mouth working soundlessly, his arm spraying blood at us, until Ballou let out an awful sound from deep in his throat and swung the cleaver a second time, burying it in the juncture of Stettner\u0027s neck and shoulder. The blow drove the man to his knees and we stepped back out of the way. He sprawled forward and lay still, pouring out blood onto the gray broadloom. Olga was standing still. I don\u0027t think she had moved at all. Her mouth was slack and she had her hands poised at the sides of her breasts, her nail polish a perfect match for the color on her nipples. I looked from her to Ballou. He was turning toward her now, his apron crimson with fresh blood, his hand locked on the handle of the cleaver. I swung the Smith around. I didn\u0027t hesitate. I squeezed the trigger, and the gun bucked in my hand. Chapter 23 The first shot was rushed, and wide of the mark. It took her in the right shoulder, I tucked my elbow in against my ribs and fired a second shot, and a third. Both entered the center of her chest, between the rouged breasts. The light was gone from her eyes before she hit the floor. \"MATT.\" I was standing there, looking down at her, and Mick was saying my name. I felt his hand on my shoulder. The room reeked of death, the smells of gunfire and blood and body wastes merging to foul the air. I felt an awful weariness, and there was a dull cramp at the back of my throat, as if something was trapped there and wanted to get out. \"Come on, man. We\u0027ve got to get out of here.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-42.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
