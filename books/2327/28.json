The denim jacket that had looked too warm for the summer now appeared unequal to the winter\u0027s cold. His high-top sneakers looked new, and he had added a royal-blue watch cap.\n I handed him the sketches. He glanced at the top one and looked up at me, his eyes wary. He said, \"You want to draw my picture? Why you laughin\u0027?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027d make a fine model,\" I said, \"but I\u0027m no artist.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t draw these here?\" He looked at each in turn, examined the signature. \"Raymond something. What do you say, Ray? What\u0027s happenin\u0027?\"\n \"Do you recognize any of them?\"\n He said he didn\u0027t, and I ran it down for him. \"The older boy\u0027s name is Happy,\" I said. \"I think he\u0027s dead.\"\n \"You think they both be dead. Don\u0027t you?\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\n \"What you want to know about them?\"\n \"Their names. Where they\u0027re from.\"\n \"You already know his name, you said. Happy, you said.\"\n \"I figure his name is Happy like your name is TJ.\"\n He gave me a look. \"You say TJ,\" he said, \"everybody gone know who you be referrin\u0027 to.\" He looked at the sketch again. \"You sayin\u0027 Happy\u0027s his street name.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"If that\u0027s his name on the street, that the only name the street gone know. Who give you that name, Testament House?\"\n I nodded. \"They said he didn\u0027t live there but he stayed there a couple of nights.\"\n \"Yeah, well, they be good people, but not everybody can handle the rules an\u0027 shit, you know what I\u0027m sayin\u0027?\"\n \"Did you ever stay there, TJ?\"\n \"Shit, why\u0027d I do that? I don\u0027t need no place like that. I got a place where I live, man.\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"Never mind where. Long as I can find it, that\u0027s all that matters.\" He shuffled through the sketches. Casually he said, \"I seen this man.\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"I dunno. On the Deuce, but don\u0027t be askin\u0027 me where or when.\" He sat down on the edge of the bed, yanked his cap off, turned it over in his hands. He said, \"What you want from me, man?\"\n I took a twenty from my wallet and held it out to him. He didn\u0027t move to take it, and his eyes repeated his question. What did I want from him?\n I said, \"You know the Deuce and the bus terminal and the kids on the street. You could go places I don\u0027t know about and talk to people who wouldn\u0027t talk to me.\"\n \"Tha\u0027s a lot for twenty dollars.\" He grinned. \"Other time I seen you, you gimme fi\u0027 dollars and I didn\u0027t do nothin\u0027.\"\n \"You haven\u0027t done anything this time either,\" I said.\n \"Could take a lot of time, though. Jivin\u0027 with the people, goin\u0027 here an\u0027 there.\" I started to take back the twenty and his hand moved to snatch it from me. \"Don\u0027t be doin\u0027 that,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t say no, did I? Just tuggin\u0027 you \u0027round some is all.\" He looked around the room. \"But I don\u0027t guess you\u0027s rich, huh?\"\n I had to laugh. \"No,\" I said. \"Not quite.\"\n CHANCE called. He had asked a few people in the fight crowd, and some had recalled an apparent father and son at ringside Thursday. No one remembered having seen the pair before, in Maspeth or elsewhere. I said the man would probably not have had the boy along on other occasions, and he said it was the two of them that people remembered. \"So it\u0027s not like the people I talked to recognized him,\" he said. \"Are you going back out there tomorrow night?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Or you could watch it on television. You might see him if he\u0027s in the first row again.\"\n We didn\u0027t stay on the phone long because I wanted to keep the line open. I hung up and waited, and Danny Boy Bell was the next to call. \"I\u0027ll be having dinner at Poogan\u0027s,\" he said. \"Why don\u0027t you join me? You know how I hate to eat alone.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got something?\"\n \"Nothing remarkable,\" he said, \"but you have to eat dinner sometime, don\u0027t you? Eight o\u0027clock.\"\n I hung up and checked the time. It was five o\u0027clock. I turned on the TV and watched the opening of the news and turned it off when I realized I wasn\u0027t paying attention. I picked up the phone and dialed Thurman\u0027s number. When the machine picked up I didn\u0027t say anything but I didn\u0027t hang up, either. I sat there with the line open for thirty seconds or so before I finally broke the connection.\n I picked up The Newgate Calendar and the phone rang almost immediately. I grabbed it and said hello and it was Jim Faber.\n \"Oh, hi,\" I said.\n \"You sound disappointed.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been waiting on a call all afternoon,\" I said.\n \"Well, I won\u0027t keep you,\" he said. \"It\u0027s not important. Will you be going to St. Paul\u0027s tonight?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so. I have to meet somebody at eight on Seventy-second Street and I don\u0027t know how long that\u0027ll last. Anyway, I went last night.\"\n \"That\u0027s funny, I looked for you and didn\u0027t see you there.\"\n \"I was downtown, I went to Perry Street.\"\n \"Oh, did you? That\u0027s where I wound up Sunday night. The perfect choice, you can say anything there and nobody gives a rat\u0027s ass. I said terrible things about Bev and felt a hundred percent better for it. Was Helen there last night? Did she tell you about the holdup?\"\n \"What holdup?\"\n \"At Perry Street. Look, you\u0027re expecting a call, I don\u0027t want to keep you.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" I said. \"Somebody held up Perry Street? What could they get? They don\u0027t even have coffee there anymore.\"\n \"Well, it wasn\u0027t a brilliantly conceived crime. It was their Friday night step meeting a week or two ago. A fellow named Bruce was speaking. I don\u0027t know if you know him and it\u0027s not important. Anyway, he gave his qualification for twenty minutes, and then some wacko stood up and announced that he had come to that meeting a year earlier and put forty dollars in the basket by mistake, and he had a gun in his pocket, and if he didn\u0027t get his forty dollars back he was going to start blowing people away.\"\n \"Jesus.\"\n \"Wait, here\u0027s the good part. Bruce told him, \u0027I\u0027m sorry, you\u0027re out of order, we can\u0027t interrupt the meeting for something like that. You\u0027ll have to wait until the break at a quarter of nine.\u0027 The guy starts to say something and Bruce bangs the gavel on that sort of podium they have there and tells him to sit down and calls on somebody else, and the meeting goes on.\"\n \"And the nut just sits there?\"\n \"I guess he figured he had no choice. Rules are rules, right? Then another fellow, a guy named Harry, went over to him and asked him if he wanted some coffee or some cigarettes, and the nut allowed as to how coffee would be nice. \u0027I\u0027ll just slip out and get you some,\u0027 Harry whispered, and he slipped out and around the corner to the police station, I think there\u0027s one fairly close-\"\n \"The Sixth Precinct\u0027s just a couple blocks away on West Tenth.\"\n \"Then that\u0027s where he went, and he came back with a couple of New York\u0027s Finest, and they bundled up the lunatic and took him away. \u0027Wait a minute,\u0027 he said. \u0027Where\u0027s my forty dollars? Where\u0027s my coffee?\u0027 Only at Perry Street.\"\n \"Oh, that could happen anywhere, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"I\u0027m not so sure of that. I can think of an Upper East Side meeting where they would have taken up a collection for the sonofabitch and then tried to see if they could find him an apartment. Well, I won\u0027t keep you, I know you\u0027re expecting a call. But I had to pass that on.\"\n \"Thanks for sharing,\" I said.\n JUST sitting still can drive you crazy. But I didn\u0027t want to go anywhere. I knew he was going to call and I didn\u0027t want to miss it.\n The phone rang at six-thirty. I grabbed it and said hello and there was no answer. I said hello again and waited. I could tell the line was open. I said hello a third time and the connection was broken.\n I picked up my book and put it down again, and then I looked in my notebook and dialed Lyman Warriner in Cambridge. \"I know I told you I wouldn\u0027t be filing any progress reports,\" I said, \"but I wanted to let you know that there\u0027s been some progress. I have a pretty good idea at this point of what happened.\"\n \"He\u0027s guilty, isn\u0027t he?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any question of that,\" I said. \"Not in my mind and not in his.\"\n \"In his?\"\n \"Something\u0027s working on him, guilt or fear or both. He called here a minute ago. He didn\u0027t say a word. He\u0027s scared to talk but he\u0027s also scared not to talk and that\u0027s why he called. I\u0027m positive he\u0027ll call again.\"\n \"You sound as though you expect him to confess.\"\n \"I think he wants to. At the same time I\u0027m sure he\u0027s afraid to. I\u0027m not sure why I called you, Lyman. I probably should have waited until everything\u0027s resolved.\"\n \"No, I\u0027m glad you called.\"\n \"I have a feeling once things start to move they\u0027re going to move fast.\" I hesitated. \"Your sister\u0027s murder is only part of it.\"\n \"Really.\"\n \"That\u0027s how it looks at this stage. I\u0027ll let you know when I have something more concrete. But in the meantime I wanted to keep you in the picture.\"\n THERE was another call at seven. I picked it up and said hello and there was a click right away as he hung up. I called back right away, dialing the number of the phone at his apartment. It rang four times and his machine picked up. I hung up.\n At seven-thirty he called again. I said hello and when there was no reply I said, \"I know who you are. You can go ahead and talk, it\u0027s all right.\"\n Silence.\n \"I have to go out now,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll be back here at ten o\u0027clock. Call me at ten.\"\n I could hear him breathing.\n \"Ten o\u0027clock,\" I said, and broke the connection. I waited for ten minutes on the off chance that he\u0027d call back right away and be ready to spill it, but no, that was it for now. I grabbed my coat and went to keep my dinner date with Danny Boy.\n Chapter 15\n \"Five Borough Cable,\" Danny Boy said. \"A good idea, based on the premise that New Yorkers might go for sports programming with a little more local interest than celebrity bass fishing and Australian rules football. But they had a slow start and they made a very common mistake. They were undercapitalized.\n \"Just about a year ago they solved that problem by selling a substantial share to a pair of brothers with a last name I can\u0027t pronounce, but which I\u0027ve been assured is Iranian. That\u0027s all anyone knows about them, aside from the fact that they live in Los Angeles, and are represented by an attorney in that city.\n \"For Five Borough, it\u0027s business as usual. They\u0027re not making money but they\u0027re not getting killed, and the new investors are willing to lose money for a few years. In fact they might be willing to lose money forever.\"\n \"I see.\"\n \"Do you? Interestingly enough, the new investors seem content to play a very passive role. You\u0027d think they might make changes in the company\u0027s management, but they kept all the old people on and didn\u0027t bring in anybody new. Except that there\u0027s someone now who\u0027s around a lot. He doesn\u0027t work for Five Borough, he doesn\u0027t draw a salary, but if you look at the company you\u0027ll always see him out of the corner of your eye.\"\n \"Who is he?\"\n \"Now that,\" he said, \"is an interesting question. His name is Bergen Stettner, which sounds German, or at least Teutonic, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the name he was born with. He lives with his wife in an apartment on a high floor in that hotel of Trump\u0027s on Central Park South. Keeps an office in the Graybar Building on Lexington. He deals in foreign currencies, and he also buys and sells precious metals. What does this begin to suggest to you?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-28.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: \n A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
