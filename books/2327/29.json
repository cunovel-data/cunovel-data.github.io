How or why or for whom or to what extent are questions I wouldn\u0027t presume to answer.\" He poured himself some vodka. \"So I don\u0027t know if this does you any good at all, Matthew. I couldn\u0027t find out anything at all about young Richard Thurman. If he hired some street scum to tie him up and savage his wife, either he picked a remarkably closemouthed pair or their fee included passage to New Zealand, because the word on the street is no word at all.\"\\n\\n \"That figures.\"\\n\\n \"Does it?\" He knocked back the Stoly. \"I hope the news about Five Borough isn\u0027t completely useless to you. I didn\u0027t want to say anything over the phone. That\u0027s never something I like to do, and your calls go through the hotel switchboard, don\u0027t they? Isn\u0027t that a nuisance?\"\\n\\n \"I can dial out direct,\" I said. \"And they take messages.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure they do, although I don\u0027t like to leave them if I can help it. I\u0027d offer to find out more about Stettner, but I might have a hard time doing that. He keeps a low profile. What have you got there?\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s his picture,\" I said, and unfolded the sketch. Danny Boy looked at it, then at me.\\n\\n \"You already knew about him,\" he said.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"You just happened to have his pencil portrait tucked in your jacket pocket. It\u0027s signed, for God\u0027s sake. Who, pray tell, is Raymond Galindez?\"\\n\\n \"The next Norman Rockwell. Is that Stettner?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, Matthew. I never set eyes on the man.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m ahead of you there. I had a good look at him. I just didn\u0027t happen to know who I was looking at.\" I folded the sketch and put it away. \"Keep this to yourself for now,\" I said, \"but if things break right, he\u0027s going to go away for a long long time.\"\\n\\n \"For running a laundry?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"That\u0027s what he does for a living. What\u0027s going to put him away is what he does for a hobby.\"\\n\\n MY walk home took me past St. Paul\u0027s. It was nine-thirty when I got there, and I stopped in for the last half hour of the meeting. I got a cup of coffee and dropped into a chair in the back row. I noticed Will Haberman a few rows in front of me and imagined bringing him up to date. In that version of The Dirty Dozen you lent me, Will, we\u0027ve so far learned that the part of Rubber Man was played by Bergen Stettner. A young fellow with no previous acting experience played the male ingenue. He was using the stage name of Happy. We\u0027re not sure yet about Leather Woman, but there\u0027s a possibility her name is Chelsea.\\n\\n That was the name Thurman had dropped last night. \"Who, Chelsea? Just a tramp, my friend. Take my word for it.\" I was willing enough to take his word, but I was less and less persuaded that the girl who\u0027d strutted around the ring with the numbered cards was the masked woman in leather.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t pay any real attention to the meeting. The discussion went on around me while my mind spun off in circles of its own. I\u0027d come down into the church basement not for what I might hear but just to be in a safe place for a few minutes.\\n\\n I ducked out early and got back to my room with two minutes to spare. Ten o\u0027clock came and went, and at five minutes after the hour the phone rang and I grabbed it. \"Scudder,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You know who this is?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t say my name. Just say where you know me from.\"\\n\\n \"Paris Green,\" I said. \"Among other places.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, right. I didn\u0027t know how much you were drinking last night, how much you\u0027d remember.\"\\n\\n \"I have a pretty good memory.\"\\n\\n \"So do I, and I\u0027ll tell you something, there\u0027s times I wish I didn\u0027t. You\u0027re a detective.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Is that straight? I couldn\u0027t find you in the book.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not listed.\"\\n\\n \"You work for some agency. You showed me a card but I didn\u0027t get the name.\"\\n\\n \"I just free-lance for them. Mostly I\u0027m on my own.\"\\n\\n \"So I could hire you directly.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"You could do that.\"\\n\\n There was a pause while he thought it over. \"The thing is,\" he said, \"I think I\u0027m in trouble.\"\\n\\n \"I can see where you\u0027d think that.\"\\n\\n \"What do you know about me, Scudder?\"\\n\\n \"What everybody knows.\"\\n\\n \"Last night you didn\u0027t recognize my name.\"\\n\\n \"That was then.\"\\n\\n \"And this is now, huh? Look, I think we ought to talk.\"\\n\\n \"I think so, too.\"\\n\\n \"Where, though? That\u0027s the question. Not Paris Green.\"\\n\\n \"How about your place?\"\\n\\n \"No. No, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea. Someplace public, but not where somebody might recognize me. All the places that come to my mind are out, because they\u0027re the places I go all the time.\"\\n\\n \"I know a place,\" I said.\\n\\n HE said, \"You know this is perfect, and I never would have thought of a place like this. This is what you\u0027d call your basic Irish neighborhood tavern, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"You could.\"\\n\\n \"Just a few blocks from where I live and I never knew it existed, but then I could walk past it every day and never notice it, never pay any attention, you know? Different worlds. Here you got your decent working-class people, honest as the day is long, real salt-of-the-earth types. And look, you got your tin ceiling, tile floor, dart board on the wall. This is perfect.\"\\n\\n We were in Grogan\u0027s, of course, and I wondered if anyone had ever described its owner as the salt of the earth, or honest as the day was long. Still, it seemed to suit our purpose. It was quiet and nearly empty, and no one who knew Thurman was likely to put in an appearance.\\n\\n I asked him what he wanted to drink. He said he guessed a beer would be good, and I went to the bar for a bottle of Harp and a glass of Coke. \"You missed the big fellow,\" Burke told me. \"He was in an hour ago, said you kept him up all night.\"\\n\\n I went back to the table and Thurman noticed my Coke. \"That\u0027s not what you were drinking last night,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You were drinking stingers.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t remind me. The thing is, I\u0027m not that much of a drinker ordinarily. A martini before dinner, and maybe a couple of beers. Last night I was hitting it. Matter of fact, I\u0027m not sure how much I said to you. Or how much you know.\"\\n\\n \"I know more than I did last night.\"\\n\\n \"And you knew more then than you let on.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you\u0027d better just tell me what\u0027s bothering you.\"\\n\\n He thought about it, then nodded shortly. He patted his pockets and found the sketch I\u0027d given him the night before. He unfolded it and looked from it to me. He asked if I knew who it was.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you tell me?\"\\n\\n \"His name is Bergen Stettner.\"\\n\\n Good, I thought.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s going to kill me.\"\\n\\n \"Why? Has he ever killed anyone before?\"\\n\\n \"God,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know where to start.\"\\n\\n HE said, \"I never met anyone like Bergen before. He started to come around after the buy-in and we hit it off right away. I thought he was fantastic. Very strong, very sure of himself, and when you\u0027re with him it\u0027s very easy to believe that the ordinary rules don\u0027t apply. The first time I met him he took me back to his apartment. We drank champagne on the terrace with all of Central Park spread out below us like our private backyard.\\n\\n \"The next time I was over there I met his wife. Olga. Beautiful woman, and there was so much sexual energy around her it was dizzying. He went to the bathroom and she sat down next to me and put her hand in my lap and started stroking me through my pants. \u0027I want to suck your cock,\u0027 she said. \u0027I want you to fuck me in the ass. I want to sit on your face.\u0027 I couldn\u0027t believe what was happening. I was sure he\u0027d walk in and catch us like that, but by the time he came back she was sitting in a chair on the other side of the room, talking about one of the paintings.\\n\\n \"The next day he kept telling me how much Olga liked me, how she said they should see more of me. A few days later we went out to dinner with them, my wife and I. It was awkward, because there was this whole thing going on between me and Olga. At the end of the evening Bergen kissed Amanda\u0027s hand, very Continental, but with a self-mocking quality to it at the same time. And Olga gave me her hand to kiss, and it smelled of, well, it smelled of pussy. She must have touched herself. And I looked up at her, you know, and there was this expression on her face, it got to me as much as the smell did.\\n\\n \"Of course he knew everything that was going on, they planned it together, I know all that now. The next time I was over at their apartment he said he had something to show me, it wasn\u0027t something I\u0027d be likely to see on cable but he thought it would interest me. He put on a videocassette, and it was porno, an amateur video. Two men sharing a woman. Halfway through Olga came in and sat down next to me. I hadn\u0027t even known she was in the apartment, I\u0027d thought Bergen and I were there alone.\\n\\n \"When the cassette ended Bergen took it off and put on another one. This one featured two women, one black and one white. The black woman was a slave. It took me a minute to realize that the white woman was Olga. I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off the screen.\\n\\n \"After it ended I looked around and Bergen had left the room. Olga and I tore our clothes off and got on the couch. At some point I realized Bergen was in the room, watching us. Then we all got up and went into the bedroom together.\"\\n\\n ALONG with the sex Stettner fed him a steady diet of philosophy. Rules were for those who lacked the imagination to break them. Superior men and women made their own rules, or lived with none at all. He quoted Nietzsche often, and Olga put a New Age gloss on the old German. There were truly no victims when you claimed your power, because their fate was just a manifestation of their own desire for subjugation. They created their destiny even as you created yours.\\n\\n One day Stettner called him at the office. \"Stop what you\u0027re doing,\" he said. \"Go downstairs, wait on the corner, I\u0027ll pick you up in fifteen minutes.\" Stettner took him for a long drive, telling him only that he had a gift for him. He parked in an unfamiliar neighborhood and led Thurman down a flight of stairs into a basement chamber. There he beheld a naked woman manacled to a metal frame, her mouth stopped with a gag. \"She\u0027s yours,\" Stettner told him. \"Do whatever you want with her.\"\\n\\n He had sex with the woman. It would have been discourteous to refuse, like turning down a drink or a meal or any other offer of hospitality. Besides, the woman\u0027s utter helplessness was fiercely exciting to him. When he had finished having intercourse with her Stettner asked him if there was anything else he wanted to do to the woman. He said there wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n They left the building and got back into Stettner\u0027s car. The older man told him to wait a minute, that there was something he had forgotten to do. He was back shortly and began driving. He asked Thurman if he\u0027d ever been a woman\u0027s first lover. Thurman said that he had.\\n\\n \"But not your wife.\"\\n\\n No, Thurman acknowledged. Amanda had not been a virgin when they met.\\n\\n \"Well, I have given you a gift,\" Stettner said. \"You have already been a woman\u0027s first lover, and now you have been this one\u0027s last. That girl you were just with, no one will ever have her again, no one but the worms. Do you know what I did when I went back? I killed her for you. I took the gag out of her mouth, and I said, \u0027Goodbye, darling,\u0027 and I cut her throat.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-29.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \\n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
