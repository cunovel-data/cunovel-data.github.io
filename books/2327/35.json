That\u0027s not quite the same thing as yes, is it?\"\n \"There\u0027s a possibility that he was murdered by an accomplice. The police are pursuing that possibility, but they don\u0027t expect to get anywhere. At the present time there\u0027s no evidence that contradicts a verdict of suicide.\"\n \"But you don\u0027t believe that\u0027s what happened.\"\n \"I don\u0027t, but what I believe\u0027s not terribly important. I spent a couple of hours with Thurman last night and I got what you were hoping I\u0027d get. He admitted murdering your sister.\"\n \"He actually admitted it.\"\n \"Yes, he did. He tried to make his accomplice the heavy, but he admitted his own role in what happened.\" I decided to stretch a point. \"He said she was unconscious for virtually all of it, Lyman. She got a blow on the head early on and never knew what happened to her.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to believe that.\"\n \"I was scheduled to meet with him yesterday afternoon,\" I went on. \"I was hoping to talk him into a full confession, but failing that I was prepared to record our conversation and turn it over to the police. But before I could do that-\"\n \"He killed himself. Well, I\u0027ll say one thing. I\u0027m certainly glad I hired you.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you say your investigation precipitated his actions?\"\n I thought about it. \"I guess you could say that,\" I said.\n \"And I\u0027m just as glad it ended as it did. It\u0027s quicker and cleaner than suffering through a court trial, and a lot of the time they walk away, don\u0027t they? Even when everybody knows they\u0027re guilty.\"\n \"It happens.\"\n \"And even when it doesn\u0027t the sentences are never long enough, or they behave themselves, they\u0027re model prisoners and after four or five years they\u0027re out on parole. No, I\u0027m more than satisfied, Matthew. Do I owe you any money?\"\n \"You probably have a refund coming.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous. Don\u0027t you dare send me anything. I wouldn\u0027t accept it if you did.\"\n Speaking of money, I told him he might be able to institute proceedings to recover his sister\u0027s estate and the insurance payment. \"You\u0027re not legally entitled to profit from the commission of a crime,\" I explained. \"If Thurman murdered your sister, he can\u0027t inherit and he can\u0027t collect the insurance money. I\u0027m not familiar with the terms of your sister\u0027s will, but I assume everything comes to you in the event that he\u0027s out of the picture.\"\n \"I believe it does.\"\n \"He hasn\u0027t been legally implicated in her death,\" I said, \"and there won\u0027t be charges brought against him now because he\u0027s dead. But I think you can institute civil proceedings, and the rules are different from criminal court. For instance, I might be able to testify to the substance of my conversation with him the night before he died. That\u0027s hearsay, but it\u0027s not necessarily inadmissible. You would want to talk to your attorney. In a case like this I don\u0027t think you have to prove guilt to the same degree as in a criminal trial, beyond a reasonable doubt. I think there\u0027s a different standard that applies. As I said, you\u0027ll want to talk to your lawyer.\"\n He was silent for a moment. Then he said, \"I don\u0027t think I will. Where would the money go if I don\u0027t? I doubt that he\u0027s redrawn his will since Amanda\u0027s death. He would have left everything to her, and to his own relatives in the event she predeceased him.\" He coughed, got control of himself. \"I don\u0027t want to fight with his sisters and his cousins and his aunts. I don\u0027t care if they get the money. What difference does it make?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"I have more money than I\u0027ll ever have time to spend. Time is worth more to me than money, and I don\u0027t want to spend it in courtrooms and lawyers\u0027 offices. You can understand that, can\u0027t you?\"\n \"Of course I can.\"\n \"It may seem cavalier of me, but-\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n AT five-thirty that afternoon I went to a meeting in a Franciscan church around the corner from Penn Station. The crowd was an interesting mix of commuters in suits and low-bottom drunks in the early stages of recovery. Neither element seemed at all uncomfortable with the other.\n During the discussion I raised my hand and said, \"I\u0027ve felt like drinking all day today. I\u0027m in a situation that I can\u0027t do anything about and it feels as though I ought to be able to. I already did everything I could and everybody else is perfectly happy with the results, but I\u0027m an alcoholic and I want everything to be perfect and it never is.\"\n I went back to the hotel and there were two messages, both that TJ had called. I didn\u0027t have a number for him. I walked over to Armstrong\u0027s and had a bowl of the black bean chili, then caught the eight-thirty step meeting at St. Paul\u0027s. We were on the Second Step, the one about coming to believe in the capacity of a power greater than ourselves to restore us to sanity. When it was my turn to say something I said, \"My name is Matt and I\u0027m an alcoholic, and all I know about my Higher Power is he works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform.\" I was sitting next to Jim Faber, and he whispered to me that if the detective business went to hell I could always get a job writing fortune cookies.\n Another member, a woman named Jane, said, \"If a normal person gets up in the morning and his car\u0027s got a flat tire, he calls Triple A. An alcoholic calls Suicide Prevention League.\"\n Jim nudged me significantly in the ribs.\n \"It can\u0027t possibly apply to me,\" I told him. \"I haven\u0027t even got a car.\"\n WHEN I got back to the hotel there was another message from TJ and still no way to get in touch with him. I showered and went to bed, and I was starting to doze off when the phone rang.\n \"You hard to reach,\" he said.\n \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s hard to reach. You left all these messages.\"\n \"That\u0027s \u0027cause last time you said I didn\u0027t leave no message.\"\n \"This time you did, but I didn\u0027t have any way to get in touch with you.\"\n \"You mean like a number to call.\"\n \"Something like that.\"\n \"Well, I ain\u0027t got no phone.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t figure you did.\"\n \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Well, we work it out one of these days. Thing is, I found out what I supposed to find out.\"\n \"The pimp.\"\n \"Yeah, I learned a whole bunch of shit.\"\n \"Let\u0027s hear it.\"\n \"On the phone, Joan? I mean I will if that be what you want, but-\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Because it don\u0027t seem too cool.\"\n \"No, probably not.\" I sat up. \"There\u0027s a coffee shop called the Flame, corner of Fifty-eighth and Ninth, it would be the southwest corner-\"\n \"It be anywhere on that corner, I gone find it.\"\n \"Yeah, I guess you will,\" I said. \"Half an hour.\"\n HE met me outside the place and we went in and got a booth. He sniffed the air theatrically and announced that something smelled good, and I laughed and handed him the menu and told him to have whatever he wanted. He ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and an order of fries and a double-rich chocolate shake. I had a cup of coffee and a toasted English.\n \"Found this chick,\" he said, \"livin\u0027 way over in Alphabet City. Say she used to be with this pimp name of Juke. Prob\u0027ly his pimpin\u0027 name. Man, she was scared shit! She cut out on Juke last summer, like she \u0027scaped from where he had her livin\u0027, an\u0027 she still lookin\u0027 over her shoulder for him to catch up with her. Told her once she ever pulled any shit on him he be cuttin\u0027 her nose off, and whole time I\u0027m there with her she be touchin\u0027 her nose, like she want to make sure it still there.\"\n \"If she left him last summer she wouldn\u0027t have known Bobby.\"\n \"Yeah, right,\" he said. \"But what it is, this kid I found who knew Bobby, all he knew about the pimp was it was the dude used to pimp-\" He caught himself and said, \"I told her I wouldn\u0027t say her name. I guess it be all right to tell you, but-\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t have to know her name. They both had the same pimp but not at the same time, so if you found out who her pimp was, then you knew who was pimping Bobby.\"\n \"Yeah, right.\"\n \"And it was somebody named Juke.\"\n \"Yeah. She don\u0027t know his last name. Box, most likely.\" He laughed. \"Don\u0027t know where he lived, either. Had her livin\u0027 up in Washington Heights, but she said how he got a few different apartments, got kids stashed here an\u0027 there.\" He picked up a French fry, dipped it in ketchup. \"He always lookin\u0027 for new kids, Juke is.\"\n \"Business is that good, huh?\"\n \"What she say, he always lookin\u0027 for new kids \u0027cause the old ones don\u0027t last long.\" He cocked his head, trying to look on top of what he was telling me, unaffected by it. He didn\u0027t quite bring it off. \"He tell her, tell everybody, there two ways they can go on a date. Date can be a round trip or a one-way rental. You know what that means?\"\n \"Tell me.\"\n \"Round trip is you come back. One-way is you don\u0027t. Like if the john buys you one-way, he don\u0027t have to return you. He can, like, do what he want.\" He looked down at his plate. \"He can kill you, that be what he want, an\u0027 everything be cool with Juke. She say he tell her, \u0027You be good or I send you out on a one-way ticket.\u0027 An\u0027 she say the thing is you don\u0027t never know you goin\u0027 out one-way. He say, \u0027Oh, this john, he a easy trick, he prob\u0027ly buy you some nice clothes, treat you fine.\u0027 Then she out the door an\u0027 he say to the other kids, \u0027Now you ain\u0027t never gone see that bitch again, \u0027cause I done sent her out on a one-way ticket.\u0027 An\u0027 they cry some, you know, if she be a good friend of theirs, but they never see her again.\"\n WHEN he had finished his meal I gave him three twenties and told him I hoped that would cover the meter. He said, \"Yeah, that be cool. \u0027Cause I know you ain\u0027t rich, man.\"\n Outside I said, \"Don\u0027t take it any further, TJ. Don\u0027t try to find out anything more about Juke.\"\n \"I could just ask a few dudes, see what they say.\"\n \"No, don\u0027t.\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t cost you nothing.\"\n \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m worried about. I wouldn\u0027t want Juke to know somebody was looking for him. He might turn around and start looking for you.\"\n He rolled his eyes. \"Don\u0027t want that,\" he said. \"Girl say he a mean motherfucker. Say he be big, too, but everybody be lookin\u0027 big to that girl.\"\n \"How old is she?\"\n \"She twelve,\" he said. \"But she small for her age.\"\n Chapter 19\n I stayed close to home on Saturday, leaving during the day only to eat a sandwich and drink a cup of coffee and catch a noon meeting across the street from Phil Fielding\u0027s video store. At ten to eight I met Elaine in front of the Carnegie Recital Hall on Fifty-seventh. She had tickets for a series of chamber music concerts and felt well enough to use them. The group that night was a string quartet. The cellist was a black woman with a shaved head. The other three were Chinese-American males, all of them dressed and groomed like management trainees.\n At intermission we made plans to go to Paris Green afterward, with maybe a quick stop at Grogan\u0027s, but by the time the second half ended we were less energetic. We went back to her apartment and ordered in Chinese food. I stayed over, and in the morning we went out for brunch.\n Sunday I had dinner with Jim and went to the eight-thirty meeting at Roosevelt. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-35.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: \n A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
