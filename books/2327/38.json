{"id":63561,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"\"Give me a moment,\" she said. She took a full minute. Then she said, \"Do you know where I live? You must, you even have the number. How did you get the number? It\u0027s supposed to be impossible to get an unlisted number.\" \"I guess they made a mistake.\" \"They wouldn\u0027t make that sort of mistake. Oh, of course, you got it from Richard. But-\" \"What?\" \"Nothing. You know the address. There is a cocktail lounge right here in the building, it\u0027s always quiet during the day. Meet me there in an hour.\" \"Fine.\" \"Wait a minute. How will I recognize you?\" \"I\u0027ll recognize you,\" I said. \"Just wear the mask. And leave your shirt off.\" THE cocktail lounge was called Hadrian\u0027s Wall. Hadrian was a Roman emperor, and the wall named for him was a fortified stone barrier built across the north of England to protect Roman settlements there from barbarous tribes. Any significance the name may have had was lost on me. The decor was expensive and understated, running to red leather banquettes and black mica tables. The lighting was subdued and indirect, the music barely audible. I got there five minutes early, sat at a table and ordered a Perrier. She arrived ten minutes late, entering from the lobby, standing just inside the archway and trying to scan the room. I stood up to make it easier for her and she walked without hesitation to my table. \"I hope you haven\u0027t been waiting long,\" she said. \"I\u0027m Olga Stettner.\" \"Matthew Scudder.\" She held out her hand and I took it. Her hand was smooth and cool to the touch, her grip strong. I thought of an iron hand in a velvet glove. Her fingernails were long, and the scarlet polish matched her lipstick. In the video she\u0027d had the same color on the tips of her breasts. We both sat down, and almost immediately the waiter was at our table. She called him by name and asked for a glass of white wine. I told him he could bring me another Perrier. Neither of us said a word until he had brought the drinks and gone away again. Then she said, \"I\u0027ve seen you before.\" \"I told you we\u0027d met.\" \"Where?\" She frowned, then said, \"Of course. At the arena. Downstairs. You were skulking around.\" \"I was looking for the men\u0027s room.\" \"So you said.\" She lifted her wine glass and took a small sip, really just wetting her tongue. She was wearing a dark silk blouse and a patterned silk scarf, fastened at her throat with a jeweled pin. The stone looked like lapis and her eyes looked blue, but it was hard to tell colors in the dimly lit lounge. \"Tell me what you want,\" she said. \"Why don\u0027t I tell you what I have first.\" \"All right.\" I started by saying that I was an ex-cop, which didn\u0027t seem to astonish her. I guess I have the look. I had met a man named Arnold Leveque when we\u0027d pulled him in on a sweep designed to clean up Times Square. Leveque had been a clerk in an adult bookstore, I said, and we\u0027d arrested him for possession and sale of obscene materials. \"Later on,\" I said, \"something came up and I had occasion to leave the NYPD. Last year I heard from Leveque, who got the word I was working private. Well, I hadn\u0027t seen Arnie in years. He was the same. Fatter, but pretty much the same.\" \"I never knew the man.\" \"Suit yourself. We got together, and he was being cagey. He told me a story about making a film in somebody\u0027s basement, a home movie with a professional touch in that they hired him to be the cameraman. Personally I don\u0027t think I could get into the mood with a creepy guy like Arnie watching, but I guess it didn\u0027t put you off stride, did it?\" \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" I wasn\u0027t wearing a wire, but I could have been miked like a soundstage and it wouldn\u0027t have made any difference. She wasn\u0027t giving away a thing. Her eyes made it very clear she was following everything I was saying, but she was very careful not to get caught speaking for the record. \"Like I said,\" I went on, \"Arnie was cagey. He had a copy of the tape and he was making arrangements to sell it for a lot of money, but of course he was careful not to say how much. At the same time he was afraid the buyer might pull a fast one, and that was where I came in. I was supposed to back him up, make sure the buyer didn\u0027t take him out.\" \"And did you do this?\" \"That\u0027s where Arnie outsmarted himself,\" I said. \"See, he wanted a backup man but he didn\u0027t want a partner. He wanted it all for himself. Maybe he\u0027d give me a grand for my troubles. So he kept me in the dark to protect himself from me, and in the meantime he forgot to protect himself from his buyer, because he got knifed to death in an alley in Hell\u0027s Kitchen.\" \"How sad for him.\" \"Well, these things happen. You know what they say, sometimes it\u0027s a dog-eat-dog world and the rest of the time it\u0027s the other way around. Soon as I heard what happened I went over to his apartment, flashed some tin at the super and had a look around. I didn\u0027t expect to find much because the cops had already been there, and I don\u0027t think they were the first ones in, either, because Arnie\u0027s keys were missing when they found his corpse. So I don\u0027t think I even got sloppy seconds, if you\u0027ll pardon the sexual innuendo, Mrs. Stettner.\" She looked at me. \"The thing is,\" I said, \"I knew Arnie kept a copy of the tape, because he already told me as much. So I gathered up every cassette in his place. There must have been forty of them, all these old movies that you\u0027d turn off if they were on television. He ate that stuff up. What I did, I sat in front of my set and cranked up my VCR and went through the lot of them. And surprise, one of \u0027em wasn\u0027t what it was supposed to be. I was zooming through it with the Fast Forward, same as all the others, when all of a sudden the regular picture\u0027s gone and we\u0027re in a room with a teenage boy all hooked up to a metal frame like something out of the Spanish Inquisition, and there\u0027s a beautiful woman in leather pants and gloves and high heels and nothing else. I notice you\u0027re wearing leather pants again today but I don\u0027t suppose they\u0027re the same ones, because the ones on the tape were crotchless.\" \"Tell me about the film.\" I recounted enough of it to make it clear I\u0027d seen it. \"It wasn\u0027t much on plot,\" I said, \"but the ending was a pip, and there was this symbolic last shot of blood flowing across the floor and down the drain. That was Arnie at his most creative, you have to give him that, and the black-and-white checkerboard floor was the same as the basement of the arena in Maspeth, and isn\u0027t that a hell of a coincidence?\" She pursed her lips and blew out a stream of air in a soundless whistle. She had half a glass of wine left but she didn\u0027t touch it, reaching instead for my glass of Perrier. She took a sip and put the glass back where she\u0027d found it. The act managed to be curiously intimate. \"You mentioned Richard Thurman,\" she said. \"Well, that\u0027s the thing,\" I said. \"See, I had Arnie\u0027s tape, but what was I going to do with it? The devious bastard never got to the point of saying who the people were. Here I got a tape the principals would be happy to get back, and it would be very much worth my while to perform them the valuable service of recovering it, but how do I find them? I went around with my eyes and ears open, but short of bumping into a man walking down the street in a rubber suit with his dick hanging out, how was I going to get anywhere?\" I picked up my Perrier and turned the glass so that I was sipping from where her lips had touched the glass. A kiss by proxy, you could call it. \"Then Thurman turns up,\" I said. \"With a dead wife, and public opinion pretty much divided as to whether or not he had anything to do with it. I run into him in a ginmill and because he\u0027s in television we get on the subject of Arnie, who worked for one of the nets before I ever knew him. And strangely enough your name came up.\" \"My name?\" \"You and your husband. Very distinctive names, easy to remember even after a long night in a saloon. Thurman put away more booze than I did, but he got very cute, lots of hints, lots of innuendo. I figured we\u0027d talk more, but the next thing you knew he was dead. They say he killed himself.\" \"It\u0027s very sad.\" \"And tragic, like you said over the phone. The same day he got killed I was out in Maspeth. I was going to meet him at the fights and he was going to point out your husband. Thurman didn\u0027t make it, I guess he was already dead by then, but I didn\u0027t need him to point out your husband, because I recognized the two of you. Then I went downstairs and recognized the floor. I couldn\u0027t find the room where you made the movie, but maybe it was one of the locked ones. Or maybe you redecorated since the taping session.\" I shrugged. \"Doesn\u0027t matter. Doesn\u0027t matter what Thurman was getting at, either, and it doesn\u0027t matter what kind of help he might have had going out the window. What matters is I\u0027m in the fortunate position of being able to do something useful for someone in a position to make it all worth my while.\" \"What do you want?\" \"What do I want? That\u0027s easy. I want basically the same thing Arnie wanted. Isn\u0027t that pretty much what everybody wants?\" Her hand was on the table, inches from mine. I extended a finger and reached to touch the back of her hand. \"But I don\u0027t want to get what he got,\" I said. \"That\u0027s all.\" FOR a long moment she sat looking down at our hands on the tabletop. Then she covered my hand with hers and fastened her eyes on mine. I could see the blue of her eyes now, and the intensity of her gaze held me. \"Matthew,\" she said, testing my name on her tongue. \"No, I think I will just call you Scudder.\" \"Whatever you like.\" She stood up. I thought for a second she was going to leave, but instead she came around the table and motioned for me to inch over to my left. She sat down beside me on the banquette and again put her hand on top of mine. \"Now we\u0027re on the same side,\" she said. She was wearing a lot of perfume. It was musky, which was no great surprise. I hadn\u0027t figured her to go around smelling like a pine tree. \"It was hard to talk,\" she said. \"You know what I mean, Scudder?\" I don\u0027t know that she had an accent, but there was the slightest European inflection to her speech. \"How can I say anything? You could be tricking me, all wired up so that anything I say would be recorded.\" \"I\u0027m not wearing a wire.\" \"How do I know this?\" She turned toward me and put her hand on my necktie just below the knot. She ran her hand the length of my tie, slipping it inside the front of my suit jacket. She stroked my shirtfront thoroughly. \"I told you,\" I said. \"Yes, you told me,\" she murmured. Her mouth was close to my ear and her breath was warm on the side of my face. Her hand dropped to my leg and swept upward along the inside of my thigh. \"Did you bring the tape?\" \"It\u0027s in a bank vault.\" \"That\u0027s a pity. We could go upstairs and watch it. How did it make you feel when you saw it?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"You don\u0027t know? What kind of an answer is that? Of course you know. It made you hot, didn\u0027t it?\" \"I suppose so.\" \"You suppose so. You\u0027re hot now, Scudder. You\u0027re hard. I could make you come right now, just by touching you. How would you like that?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-38.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
