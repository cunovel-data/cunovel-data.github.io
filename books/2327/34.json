{"id":63557,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"I gave them a minute\u0027s head start. Then they rang the bell for the start of the fight and I walked down the stairs to the basement.\n At the foot of the stairs was a broad hallway with walls on either side of unfinished concrete block. The first door I came to was open, and inside I could see the winner of the previous bout. He had a pint bottle of Smirnoff in his hand and he was pouring drinks for his friends and taking quick nips from the bottle for himself.\n I walked a little further and listened at a closed door, tried the knob. It was locked. The next door was open but the light was out and the room empty. It had the same interior walls as the hallway, the same floor of black and white tiles. I walked on, and a male voice called, \"Hey!\"\n I turned around. It was Stettner, with his wife a few steps behind him. He was fifteen or twenty yards behind me and he walked slowly toward me, a slight smile on his lips. \"Can I help you?\" he asked. \"Are you looking for something?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I said. \"The men\u0027s room. Where the hell is it?\"\n \"Upstairs.\"\n \"Then why did that clown send me down here?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said, \"but this is a private area down here. Go upstairs, the men\u0027s room is right next door to the refreshment stand.\"\n \"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"I know where that is.\"\n I moved past him and mounted the stairs. I could feel his eyes on my back all the way to the top.\n I went back to my seat and tried to watch the fight. They were mixing it up and the crowd loved it but after two rounds I realized I wasn\u0027t paying any attention. I got up and left.\n Outside, the air was colder and a wind had blown up. I walked a block and tried to get my bearings. I didn\u0027t know the neighborhood and there was no one to ask. I wanted a taxi or a telephone and had no idea where to find either.\n I wound up flagging down a gypsy cab on Grand Avenue. He didn\u0027t have a meter or a city medallion and wasn\u0027t supposed to pick up fares on the street, but once you get outside of Manhattan nobody pays too much attention to that rule. He wanted a flat twenty dollars to take me anywhere in Manhattan. We settled on fifteen and I gave him Thurman\u0027s address, then changed my mind at the thought of spending another hour in a doorway. I told him to take me to my hotel.\n The cab was a wreck, with exhaust fumes coming up through the floorboards. I cranked down both rear windows as far as they would go. The driver had the radio tuned to a broadcast of polka music, with a disc jockey who chattered away gaily in what I took to be Polish. We got onto Metropolitan Avenue and went over the Williamsburg Bridge to the Lower East Side, which struck me as the long way around, but I kept my mouth shut. There was no meter ticking away so it wasn\u0027t costing me extra, and for all I knew his way was shorter.\n The only message waiting for me was from Joe Durkin. He\u0027d left his home phone number. I went upstairs and tried Thurman first and hung up when the machine answered. I called Joe and his wife answered and called him to the phone, and when he came on the line I said, \"He didn\u0027t show in Maspeth but Stettner did. Both Stettners. They were looking for him the same as I was, so I guess I wasn\u0027t the only person who got stood up tonight. Nobody on the TV crew had a clue where he went to. I think he flew the coop.\"\n \"He tried. His wings fell off.\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"There\u0027s a restaurant downstairs. I forget the name, it means radish in Italian.\"\n \"Radicchio\u0027s not radish. It\u0027s a kind of lettuce.\"\n \"Well, whatever it is. Six-thirty or so, you must of just got on your way to Maspeth, guy goes out back with a load of kitchen garbage. Way in the back behind two of the cans there\u0027s a body. Guess who.\"\n \"Oh, no.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid so. No question about the ID. He went out a fifth-floor window so he\u0027s not as pretty as he used to be, but there\u0027s enough of his face left so you know right away who you\u0027re looking at. Are you sure it doesn\u0027t mean radish? It was Antonelli told me. You\u0027d think he\u0027d know, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\n Chapter 18\n The papers loved it. Richard Thurman had fallen to his death just a matter of yards from where his wife had been brutally raped and murdered less than three months previously. One potential Pulitzer Prize winner theorized that his last sight in this life might have been a glimpse of the Gottschalk apartment as he sailed past its window on the way down. That seemed unlikely, since you generally draw the blinds when you leave town for six months and a day, but I didn\u0027t have strong enough feelings on the subject to write a letter to the editor.\n Nobody was questioning the suicide, although opinion seemed to be divided on the motive. Either he was despondent over the loss of his wife and unborn child or he was guilt-ridden over having caused their deaths. An editorial page columnist in the News saw the case as epitomizing the failure of the greed of the eighties. \"You used to hear a lot of talk about Having It All,\" he wrote. \"Well, three months ago Richard Thurman had it all- money in the bank, a great apartment, a beautiful wife, a glamorous job in the booming cable TV industry, and a baby on the way. In no time at all it turned to ashes, and the job and the money weren\u0027t enough to fill the void in Richard Thurman\u0027s heart. You may think he was a villain, that he engineered the unholy scenario enacted in November at that house on West Fifty-second Street. Or you may see him as a victim. Either way, he turned out to be a man who had had it all- and who had nothing left to cling to when he lost it.\"\n \"YOUR instincts were on target,\" Durkin told me. \"You were afraid something happened to him and you wanted to get into the apartment. Same time, you didn\u0027t really think he was in there. Well, he wasn\u0027t. The ME\u0027s guess on time of death is seven to nine A.M., which would figure, because from ten in the morning you had kitchen staff in the joint downstairs and they probably would have heard the impact when he landed. Why nobody noticed the body during lunch hour is hard to figure, except that it was way over at one end of the courtyard and their service door was at the other end, and nobody got close enough to notice anything. You got your arms full of leftover eggplant, I guess you just want to dump it and get back inside, especially on a cold day.\"\n It was Friday morning now and we were in Thurman\u0027s apartment. The lab crew had been all through the place the previous evening, while I was chasing shadows in Maspeth. I walked around the place, moving from room to room, not knowing what I was looking for. Maybe not looking for anything at all.\n \"Nice place,\" Joe said. \"Modern furniture, looks stylish but a person could live with it. Everything overstuffed, built for comfort. You usually hear them say that about a woman, don\u0027t you? \u0027Built for comfort, not for speed.\u0027 Where does speed come into it, do you happen to know?\"\n \"I think they once said it about horses.\"\n \"Yeah? Makes sense. Assuming you get a more comfortable ride on a fat horse. I\u0027ll have to ask one of the guys in TPF. When I was a kid, first wanted to be a cop, that\u0027s what I wanted to do, you know. I\u0027d see the cops on horseback and that\u0027s what I wanted to be. Of course I got over it by the time I got to the Academy. Still, you know, it\u0027s not a bad life.\"\n \"If you like horses.\"\n \"Well, sure. If you didn\u0027t like \u0027em in the first place-\"\n \"Thurman didn\u0027t kill himself,\" I said.\n \"Hard to be sure of that. Guy spills his guts, comes home, wakes up early, realizes what he\u0027s done. Sees he\u0027s got no way out, which he didn\u0027t, because you were gonna bag him for doing his wife. Maybe his conscience starts working for real. Maybe he just happens to realize he\u0027s looking at some real time upstate, and he knows what it\u0027s gonna be like in the joint, a pretty boy like him. Out the window and your troubles are over.\"\n \"He wasn\u0027t the type. And he wasn\u0027t afraid of the law, he was afraid of Stettner.\"\n \"Only his prints on the window, Matt.\"\n \"Stettner wore gloves when he did Amanda. He could put them on again to throw Richard out the window. Thurman lived here, his prints would already be there. Or Stettner gets him to open the window. \u0027Richard, it\u0027s roasting in here, could we have a little air?\u0027 \"\n \"He left a note.\"\n \"Typewritten, you said.\"\n \"Yeah, I know, but some bona fide suicides type their notes. It was pretty much your generic suicide note. \u0027God forgive me, I can\u0027t take it anymore.\u0027 Didn\u0027t say he did it, didn\u0027t say he didn\u0027t.\"\n \"That\u0027s because Stettner wouldn\u0027t have known how much we already knew.\"\n \"Or because Thurman wasn\u0027t taking any chances. Suppose he falls four stories and lives? He\u0027s in the hospital with twenty bones broken, last thing he wants is to face murder charges on the basis of his fucking suicide note.\" He put out a cigarette in a souvenir ashtray. \"It so happens I agree with you,\" he said. \"I think the odds are he had help going out the window. That\u0027s one reason I had the lab boys do a real thorough job last night and it\u0027s why we\u0027re looking for a witness who saw anybody going in or out of here yesterday morning. It\u0027d be nice to turn one up, and it\u0027d be nice if you could put Stettner at the scene, but I can tell you now it ain\u0027t gonna happen. And even if it did there\u0027s no case against him. So he was here, so what? Thurman was alive when he left. He was despondent, he seemed upset, but who ever thought the poor man would take his own life? Horseshit on the half shell, but let\u0027s see you go and prove it.\"\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"Besides,\" he said, \"is it so bad this way? We know Thurman killed his wife and we know he didn\u0027t get away with it. True, he had help, and maybe it was Stettner-\"\n \"Of course it was Stettner.\"\n \"What of course? All we got for that is Thurman\u0027s word, which he said to you in a private unrecorded conversation a few hours before he fell to his death. Maybe he was jerking you around, did you stop to think of that?\"\n \"I know he was jerking me around, Joe. He was trying to make himself look as good as possible and trying to make Stettner look like a combination of Svengali and Jack the Ripper. So what?\"\n \"So maybe it wasn\u0027t Stettner. Maybe Thurman had some other accomplices, maybe he had some business reason to do a number on Stettner. Look, I\u0027m not saying that\u0027s what happened. I know it\u0027s farfetched. The whole fucking case is farfetched. What I\u0027m saying is that Thurman set up his wife\u0027s killing and he\u0027s dead now, and if every murder case I ever had worked out this well I wouldn\u0027t sit around eating my heart out, you know what I mean? If Stettner did it and he skates, well, I live with worse than that every day of my life. If he was as bad as Thurman made him out to be he would have got his dick in the wringer somewhere along the line, and it never once happened. Man\u0027s never been arrested, hasn\u0027t got a sheet on him anywhere. Far as I can tell he never even got a speeding ticket.\"\n \"You checked around.\"\n \"Of course I checked around, for Christ\u0027s sake. What do you expect me to do? If he\u0027s a bad guy I\u0027d love to put him away. But he doesn\u0027t look so bad, not on the record.\"\n \"He\u0027s another Albert Schweitzer.\"\n \"No,\" he said, \"he\u0027s probably a real prick, I\u0027ll grant you that. But that\u0027s not a crime.\"\n I called Lyman Warriner in Cambridge. I didn\u0027t have to break the news to him. Some sharp-witted reporter had done that for me, calling Amanda\u0027s brother for his reaction. \"Of course I declined to comment,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t even know if it was true. He killed himself?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-34.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: \n A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) \n A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
