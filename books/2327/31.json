{"id":63554,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\"Right around the first of November I mentioned that our downstairs neighbors would be spending the next six months in Florida. \u0027Good,\u0027 Bergen said. \u0027That\u0027s where we\u0027ll kill Amanda. It\u0027s a natural site for a burglary, with the owners in Florida. And it\u0027s convenient, she won\u0027t have to travel far, and it\u0027s better than doing it in your apartment because you wouldn\u0027t want police parading in and out of your place. They make a mess, sometimes they even steal things.\u0027 \"I thought it was a joke. \u0027Oh, you\u0027re going to a party? When you come home we\u0027ll be waiting in the Jews\u0027 apartment downstairs. You\u0027ll walk right in on a burglary in progress. I hope I can still remember how to break in. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s like swimming, once you learn it you never forget it.\u0027 \"The night of the party I didn\u0027t know if it was a joke or not. This is hard to explain. I knew but I didn\u0027t know. The two sides of my life were so far apart it\u0027s as if I didn\u0027t really believe something on one side could touch something on the other. It\u0027s like I knew they would be waiting there for us but I couldn\u0027t really believe it. \"When we left the party I wanted to walk home because I wanted to delay getting there for fear that they\u0027d be there, that it would be real this time. And on the way home she started talking about her brother, how she was worried about his health, and I made a nasty crack. So we had an argument, and I thought, all right, bitch, in an hour you\u0027ll be history. And the thought was exciting. \"Walking up the stairs I saw the door to the Gottschalks\u0027 apartment was closed and I felt relieved, and then I saw that the doorframe was splintered and there were jimmy marks around the lock so I knew they were there. But I thought if we were quiet we could get past the closed door and upstairs to our own apartment and we\u0027d be safe. Of course we could have turned around and gone back down the stairs, but I didn\u0027t even think of that at the time. \"Then we got to the top of the flight of stairs and the door opened and they were waiting for us. Olga had on a leather outfit she wears sometimes and Bergen was wearing a long leather coat. They looked as though they\u0027d stepped out of a comic book. Amanda didn\u0027t recognize them at first. She was just staring at them, not knowing what to make of it, and before she could say anything Bergen said, \u0027You\u0027re dead, bitch,\u0027 and punched her in the face. He was wearing thin leather driving gloves. He made a fist and hit her full force in the jaw. \"Bergen grabbed her and dragged her inside with his hand clamped over her mouth. Olga got Amanda\u0027s hands behind her back and handcuffed her. They taped her mouth and Olga tripped her and kicked her in the face when she fell. \"They stripped her and dragged her into the bedroom and threw her on the bed. Bergen raped her and turned her over and raped her again. Olga hit her in the face with a crowbar and I think that may have knocked her out. I don\u0027t think she was conscious for most of it. \"I hope not. \"They told me I had to have sex with her. And this is the worst part. I thought I was going to be sick to my stomach, I thought I was going to puke, but get this, I was excited. I was hard. I didn\u0027t want to have sex, I didn\u0027t want to, but my cock wanted to. God, it makes me sick to think about it. I couldn\u0027t finish. I was on top of her and I couldn\u0027t finish and I just wanted to come so I could stop but I couldn\u0027t. \"Then I was standing over her and Bergen had her panty hose wrapped around her neck and he made me take an end in each hand. He told me I had to do it and I just stood there. Olga was on her knees blowing me and Bergen\u0027s gloved hands were holding my hands, and I was holding the ends of the panty hose, I couldn\u0027t let go because of his grip. And he pulled his hands apart, and that pulled my hands apart, and her eyes were staring up at me, staring, you know. And Olga was doing what she was doing, you know, and Bergen was holding me very tight, and there was the smell of the blood and the leather and the sex. \"And I had an orgasm. \"And Amanda was dead.\" Chapter 16 \"The rest was pretty much the way we figured,\" I told Durkin. \"They tied him up and knocked him around a little to make it look good, set the stage so it fit the profile of a bungled burglary. They walked out and went home, and he called it in an hour or so later, whenever it was. He had his story all ready. He\u0027d had days to work it out, all the while he was telling himself it was a joke.\" \"And now he wants to hire you.\" \"He did hire me,\" I said. \"Last night, before we parted company.\" \"What for?\" \"He\u0027s afraid of the Stettners. Afraid they\u0027ll kill him.\" \"Why would they do that?\" \"To cover their asses. His conscience has been bothering him.\" \"I should fucking hope so.\" \"Well, according to him, it has. He keeps having the thought that she really loved him and she was the only person who ever did or ever will.\" \"Only person damn fool enough.\" \"And he wants to believe that she died without realizing he was a part of her murder. That she was unconscious when he had sex with her, that she was either unconscious or already dead when Stettner made him strangle her.\" \"He wants the answer to that one, he doesn\u0027t need a detective, he needs a medium.\" It was midmorning, Thursday. I had gone to Midtown North after breakfast and waited for Joe to show, and we were at his desk now. He had a cigarette going. He must have quit smoking a dozen times that I knew about. He couldn\u0027t seem to stay off it. I said, \"He thinks his conscience is showing. And he thinks Stettner doesn\u0027t need him anymore.\" \"How did Stettner need him in the first place, Matt? It sounds to me like he\u0027s making Stettner the heavy when he was the one using Stettner instead of the other way around. Way I figure it he got a mil and a half out of the deal, and what did Stettner get? A quick piece of ass with a woman who\u0027s half-dead?\" \"So far,\" I said, \"Stettner got four hundred thousand dollars.\" \"I must have missed that part.\" \"I was just getting to it. After it was all over, after she was buried and the press coverage had died down, Stettner had a talk with him. He said their little joint venture had been a great success, but of course if it was indeed a joint venture it was only fair that the proceeds be shared jointly.\" \"In other words, come up with half the dough.\" \"That\u0027s the idea. Not the money he inherited from his wife, Stettner was willing to overlook that, but certainly the insurance proceeds. As soon as the insurance company paid up, he wanted half. It was a million with the double indemnity, since murder is accidental death-\" \"Which I never understood.\" \"Neither did I, but I guess it\u0027s an accident from the point of view of the victim. Anyway, it came to a million tax-free, and Stettner wanted half of it. The insurance company paid up late last month, which seems pretty quick in a case like this.\" \"They had a guy over here,\" he said. \"Wanted to know if Thurman was a suspect. Officially he wasn\u0027t, which is what I had to tell him. I was convinced he did it, I told you that-\" \"Yes.\" \"- but the only motive we had was the money, and we couldn\u0027t establish any need for the money, or anybody else he was mixed up with, or any reason to kill her.\" He frowned. \"What you\u0027ve been telling me is he really didn\u0027t have a reason.\" \"Not the way he tells it. But the insurance company paid, and Stettner wanted his, and the way they worked it was that Thurman would turn over cash to Stettner in increments of a hundred thousand dollars that would ostensibly be used to purchase foreign currencies. The money would just go in Stettner\u0027s pocket, but Thurman would get memos of nonexistent transactions and they\u0027d be structured in such a way that he would ultimately be able to write off most of it as losses for tax purposes. I think that may be my favorite part, Joe. Split the proceeds with your partner in crime and write it off on your taxes.\" \"It\u0027s not bad. He\u0027s made four of these payments?\" \"At one-week intervals. The final payment\u0027s due tonight. He\u0027ll be meeting Stettner in Maspeth, he\u0027s producing a telecast at a boxing arena out there. He\u0027ll turn over a briefcase with a hundred grand in it and that\u0027ll be that.\" \"And then he thinks Stettner\u0027ll kill him. Because he\u0027ll have the money and he won\u0027t need Thurman anymore, and Thurman\u0027s just a loose end and is starting to develop a conscience, so why not close the account?\" \"Right.\" \"And he wants you to protect him,\" he said. \"Did he happen to say how?\" \"We left it open. I\u0027m meeting him this afternoon to figure all that out.\" \"And then you go out to whatchacallit, Maspeth?\" \"Probably.\" He stubbed out his cigarette. \"Why you?\" \"He knows me.\" \"He knows you? How does he know you?\" \"We met in a bar.\" \"So you said, last night in that shithole your friend Ballou owns. Incidentally, I don\u0027t know what the hell you\u0027re doing keeping company with a guy like that.\" \"He\u0027s a friend of mine.\" \"One of these days he\u0027s gonna step on his cock and you don\u0027t want to be there when it happens. He\u0027s a good dancer, he\u0027s slippery as a fucking eel, but one of these days the Feds\u0027ll put a RICO case together and he\u0027s got free room and board in Atlanta.\" \" \u0027Mother of mercy, is this the end of RICO?\u0027 \" \"Huh?\" \"Nothing,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not important. We met at Grogan\u0027s last night because we needed a quiet place to talk. The reason he called me is we ran into each other the night before in another bar, a place in his neighborhood.\" \"You ran into him because you\u0027re on his case. Did he know that?\" \"No. He thought I was on Stettner\u0027s case.\" \"Why would you be on Stettner\u0027s case?\" I hadn\u0027t told him anything about the tape of Happy\u0027s murder, or about the killing of Arnold Leveque. All of that seemed extraneous. The case in Joe\u0027s open file was the murder of Amanda Thurman, and that was the case I\u0027d been hired for and the one that looked to be breaking. \"It was a way to hook him,\" I said. \"I\u0027d managed to connect him with Stettner, and that turned out to be the shoe in the door. If he can hang it all on Bergen and Olga, maybe he can get off the hook himself.\" \"You think you can get him to come in, Matt?\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m hoping. That\u0027s what I\u0027ll be working on when I see him this afternoon.\" \"I want you wearing a wire when you see him.\" \"Fine.\" \" \u0027Fine.\u0027 I wish to God you\u0027d been wearing a wire when you saw him last night. You can get lucky, a guy feels like talking, he spills his guts and feels better. Then he gets up the next morning and wonders what got into him, and for the rest of his life he never gets the urge to open up again. Why the hell didn\u0027t you come in and get a wire before you saw him?\" \"Come on,\" I said. \"He called out of the blue at ten and wanted to meet me right away. Were you even here last night?\" \"There\u0027s other people could have fitted you with a wire.\" \"Sure, and it only would have taken two hours and ten phone calls to clear it, and I had no realistic reason to think he was going to open up like that in the first place.\" \"Yeah, you\u0027re right.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-31.html","bookId":2327,"book":{"id":2327,"title":"A Dance at the Slaughter House (Matthew Scudder #9)","description":"Storyline: A Dance At The Slaughterhouse (Matthew Scudder #9) A Dance At The SlaughterhouseIn Matt Scudder\u0027s mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law.
