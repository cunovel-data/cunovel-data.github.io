{"id":84470,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"\"So...aren\u0027t you going to wish me good luck?\" he said, coming over to stand close beside me. He leaned back against the table as he waited.\n I relaxed my face and then grinned at him. \"You don\u0027t need my luck to do great up there.\"\n He smiled widely and I felt a little dizzy. \"True, but I like it.\"\n I laughed and gave him a swift hug. \"Well, good luck then.\"\n He pouted charmingly. \"I generally get more than a grandmotherly hug from girls when they wish me luck.\" He raised an eyebrow at me suggestively.\n I laughed again and smacked his shoulder. \"Well, I\u0027m not just any girl.\"\n He smiled adoringly and shook his head. \"No...no you\u0027re not.\" He turned and hopped up on the stage and I had to lean against the table for a second, as I felt dizzy again.\n As per usual, the band was amazing. The bar seemed to double in size as the band played on, and I didn\u0027t have as much time as I would have liked to watch Kellan play. But in-between orders, I did steal a glance or two. It thrilled me when I caught him watching me. It also concerned me a little, but I quickly pushed that to the back of my mind. I had to admit to myself, I liked his attention.\n I sang along softly to the songs that I knew, as I helped the many thirsty people in the bar. Near the end of their set, a song the band was playing caught my attention. I hadn\u0027t heard the intense song before, but the crowd was singing along so it must have been an old one. I glanced over at Jenny and she was singing along too. The lyrics were intensely serious and so was Kellan\u0027s face. He almost looked mad.\n \u0027\u0027I\u0027ve seen what you\u0027ve done to her...I know your secret. You may break her, but it won\u0027t last, you won\u0027t last. She holds herself tight, waits for the pain to be over. It won\u0027t be long now, until the angels hover.\"\n He concentrated more on his guitar than the crowd while he played, and I couldn\u0027t help but shake the feeling that the song had nothing to do with a woman.\n \"You took everything, left her with nothing. She was supposed to be loved. What\u0027s wrong with you? She\u0027ll find strength, she\u0027ll be free. It won\u0027t be long...for her...for me...\"\n I felt the sudden inexplicable need to hold him, comfort him. I watched him from the corner of my eye as I tended to my customers. Eventually the song ended, and he switched to a happy, upbeat one. All trace of the emotion in the previous song evaporated from his face, but I couldn\u0027t shake the image of his ire.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, babe.\" Denny was looking at me dejectedly as he sat on the edge of the bed. He was removing his shoes and rubbing his feet.\n \"It\u0027s fine, Denny. It\u0027s just one weekend. Really, I can handle that.\"\n \"It\u0027s really just one night apart. I\u0027ll be back late the next night, probably before you get home from work.\" He sighed and put his feet on the carpet. \"I am sorry though.\" He rolled his eyes. \"It\u0027s ridiculous, the only reason Max is making me go to this conference instead of him, is because he\u0027s flying to Vegas for a bachelor party.\" He shook his head, irritated. \"If his Uncle knew, he\u0027d be racked off.\"\n I shrugged. \"Why don\u0027t you tell him?\"\n He looked at me with a wry smile and shook his head. \"I really don\u0027t need to make my job any worse.\" I cringed a bit, remembering why he had this job in the first place and noticing, he immediately said, \"Sorry.\"\n I shook my head, clearing away the memory. \"So you\u0027re leaving Friday morning and you\u0027ll be back late Saturday, right?\"\n He came over to sit beside me on the bed. \"Yeah. I\u0027ll miss you.\" He smiled at me and leaned over to kiss my neck.\n My thoughts started drifting as his lips ran down my skin. I\u0027d have an entire afternoon alone with Kellan. Maybe we could go somewhere...take a drive somewhere people didn\u0027t know us, where our flirting didn\u0027t have to be quite so contained behind closed doors. He had spent nearly all last weekend with Denny and I. The three of us had gone exploring downtown, Kellan showing us all of his favorite places. Kellan would sneak my hand when Denny wasn\u0027t looking, or hold me close in a quick embrace. We would gaze at each other discreetly and we smiled...a lot.\n Denny\u0027s lips were trailing down past my neck. It was jarring me from my pleasant memories and I pushed him away a little. \"Are you hungry? I could make dinner this time?\" I had a feeling that wasn\u0027t what he was \"hungry\" for, but I really wasn\u0027t in the mood.\n He frowned slightly, but pulled away. \"Yeah...sure.\"\n \"Okay,\" I said cheerily, as I hopped up and kissed his forehead quickly.\n I glanced at Kellan\u0027s room as I exited our room, but he wasn\u0027t there. His band was playing tonight at a small club in Pioneer Square. I had racked my brain, wondering how I could go without making Denny suspicious. It was my night off, and I rarely got to see Kellan play anywhere but Pete\u0027s. I remembered the one time I had watched him at Razors. He was amazing in a smaller, more intimate setting like that...not that he wasn\u0027t always amazing when he sang.\n I sighed as I stepped off the last stair and walked through the empty living room. The house was so quiet without him. He was constantly playing or humming or singing. He filled our home with music, with his presence. It felt a little empty here with him gone. I had considered telling Denny that I was spending the evening with Jenny...but that would require a lot of lying. For one, Jenny was actually at work, and if Denny got bored and went to Pete\u0027s...well, that wouldn\u0027t be good.\n I sighed again as I entered the kitchen and started rummaging for food. I didn\u0027t want to be a liar anyway. That wasn\u0027t me. I could wait. I would see Kellan soon. We\u0027d have almost all this coming weekend together. I frowned a bit, as I realized that we\u0027d also have a whole evening alone together too. I shook my head. That didn\u0027t matter. We were just friends. We weren\u0027t going any further than that.\n My smile returned as I thought back over the last few days with Kellan. I found something intricate to make for dinner and let my mind wander back through the memories, as I started the process of preparing our meal. Not only had our weekend been great, he had been sweet and charming this whole week too. He always took me to school and walked me to class. Women now looked at the door expectantly to see him enter with me, which now made me laugh a little. He usually picked me up too, and either took me home, or to Pete\u0027s if I wanted to go in early to study. I usually didn\u0027t, I preferred to study with him on the couch, although, sometimes it was just too distracting to lie on his lap and try and read Pride and Prejudice while he stroked my hair. I usually found myself staring into his eyes instead, making him laugh and point at the book. Then I\u0027d hand the novel over to him and make him read it to me. He\u0027d happily do it, his voice nearly lulling me to sleep it was so smooth, and at times, I swear, purposely husky.\n Denny joined me downstairs right as I finished, and we ate our dinner together at the table. He told me some more details about this conference he had to go to and I told him about my classes. We talked about my Econ class for an absurdly long amount of time (I really never needed to study for that class, since I learned more just talking it over with Denny, than from reading the books or my notes). After dinner, he cleaned up while I answered the ringing phone. It was my sister, and we talked long into the night. She was excited to come up and wanted to make sure Kellan was still coming when we all went out together. I sighed and swallowed my frustrations at that -it would be fine - and then we moved on to her current flings.\n I was still chatting with her on the phone when Denny came up and kissed my cheek to say goodnight. I don\u0027t know if I was waiting for Kellan to come home from the bar or not, but I stayed on the phone with my sister for hours after Denny went to bed. Kellan did finally come home, and I finally hung up with her, melting into his warm embrace.\n \"So, Denny\u0027s gone tonight?\" Kellan asked, holding my hand over the kitchen table while we drank our coffee.\n I eyed him suspiciously. \"Yes...he\u0027s in Portland until tomorrow night. Why?\"\n He looked down, considering something, then spoke without looking back up at me. \"Stay with me tonight.\"\n \"I stay here with you every night?\" I asked, confused. We did share a house after all.\n He looked up at me, amused. \"No...sleep with me tonight.\"\n \"Kellan! That is not going to-\"\n He interrupted me. \"I meant literally...fall asleep with me on my bed.\" He laughed at my assumption.\n I blushed and looked away, making him laugh some more. Finally my embarrassment cooled, and I looked back over to him. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s such a good idea, Kellan.\"\n He cocked his head and smiled brilliantly. \"Why not? Completely innocent, I won\u0027t even get under the covers.\"\n I raised an eyebrow. \"Completely dressed too?\" Why was I even considering this? It was not a good idea.\n \"Sure.\" He laughed again. \"If that is what you\u0027d prefer.\" He stroked my hand with his thumb.\n I laughed, and then smiled at the thought of falling asleep in his arms. \"It is.\" I frowned, it really wasn\u0027t a good idea though...too many things could go horribly wrong. \"You\u0027ll let me know the moment it gets too hard.\"\n He chuckled and looked away, barely containing his laughter. Immediately, I realized how that sounded and blushed deeply. \"You know what I mean.\" I whispered, mortified.\n Laughing softly, he said, \"Yes, I know what you mean...and yes, I will.\" He sighed. \"You really are adorable...do you know that?\" His face seemed sincere when he said that, so I smiled and looked away.\n \"Okay...we\u0027ll try it.\" I whispered, thinking this was a really bad idea.\n Denny came downstairs awhile later, looking freshly showered and holding one of our duffel bags. His normally warm brown eyes looked flat with sadness. He seemed reluctant to leave and I gave him a long kiss goodbye, hoping to cheer him up a bit. He did give me a half-smile when he finally left the house. Oddly, my stomach was fine as I watched him drive off at the window near the kitchen. I decided it was because he was only going to be gone for one night. It was a finite period, unlike the last time he\u0027d left me. But then Kellan came up behind me, putting his arms around my waist as he stared out the kitchen window with me. I melted back into his embrace and wondered why I was really okay with Denny being gone?\n Later at Pete\u0027s, I stopped wiping down a table and listened without looking to a song I\u0027d never heard the guys play before. It was the closest thing to a love song I\u0027d ever heard from the band. It was catchy and upbeat, with lyrics about \u0027not being alone now\u0027 and \u0027feeling happy when you\u0027re around\u0027. I wondered if the song was new, and my heart raced a little at the thought of Kellan writing something just for me. I was smiling contently as I continued wiping down the table, lost in dreamy thoughts.\n \"Huh.\" Jenny came up beside me and I startled as I looked over at her. She was watching the band curiously. I glanced over at them too, worried that maybe Kellan had looked at me inappropriately and she was suspicious. Kellan flicked a glance in our direction, but was mainly smiling at the crowd of girls near him, like he usually did.\n I relaxed. \"What?\"\n Jenny turned and smiled at me. \"Evan must be in love again.\"\n \"Oh...why?\" I asked curiously.\n She laughed a little and nodded her head towards the stage. \"This song, they always play it whenever he\u0027s swooning over some girl.\" She looked over the crowd. \"I wonder which lucky lady it is?\"\n My spirit deflated a bit. \"Hmmm...don\u0027t know.\" Okay, so Kellan didn\u0027t write it for me. That\u0027s probably for the best anyway. I really don\u0027t need him gushing over me. He had a hard enough time with just being attracted to me (for some odd reason), no need to throw love on top of that. We\u0027re just friends anyway. Flirty friends, who were snuggling in bed later tonight. I frowned. It really was not a good idea.\n \"Do you need a ride home tonight?\" Jenny asked politely.\n \"No, Kellan\u0027s giving me a ride back.\" I smiled and tried hard to not look overly excited about that. \"Thank you though.\"\n \"No problem.\" Someone paged Jenny on the other side of the bar and she politely excused herself.\n I took a few more orders. A nearby couple, obviously on a first date, the man horribly nervous, the woman cutely shy, made me smile. While I was waiting at the bar for their drinks, Kellan\u0027s song ended and upon hearing his speaking voice, I glanced up at the stage. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thoughtless-thoughtless-1/page-38.html","bookId":1887,"book":{"id":1887,"title":"Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1) \n For almost two years now, Kiera\u0027s boyfriend, Denny, has been everything she\u0027s ever wanted: loving, tender and endlessly devoted to her.
