His arms were locked firmly around his legs and his head was slung down between his knees. His whole body shook...but not from the cold. He shook, because he was softly crying. He said nothing as I sat down next to his dripping body, he didn\u0027t look at me, and he didn\u0027t stop crying either. Emotions flooded through me - hate, guilt, grief...even desire. I settled on sympathy, and put an arm around his shoulders. A sob escaped him and turning into me, he slipped his arms around my waist and laid his head on my lap. He completely lost it. He clutched at me like I might vanish at any moment. He sobbed so hard he could barely breathe. I leaned over him, stroking his hair and rubbing his back, as new tears sprang to my eyes. The hurt of his words evaporated in my mind at his pain. Guilt at what I had driven him to flooded through me. He was right...in a crude, vulgar way. I was a tease. I did lead him on. I continually brought him to the brink, then left him for another. It obviously had hurt him. I was obviously hurting him. He blew up at me, and I had kind of deserved it...and he hated himself for it. He was shaking uncontrollably. His chill was seeping into me, so some of his trembling must be because he was soaked through. I reached behind me, and he clutched me tighter, like he was afraid I was leaving. Grabbing the edge of a blanket nearly falling off his messy bed, I pulled it up and wrapped it around the both of us. I laid myself over his back, slipping my arms around him. My body eventually started to warm, in turn warming his body, and his shaking slowed. After what felt like an eternity, his sobs eased to gentle crying, and then those eased as well. I continued to silently hold him to me, surprised to realize that I was lightly rocking him, like he was a child. After a moment, his arms around me loosened, his breath became smooth and regular, and I realized that, also like a child, he had cried himself to sleep on my legs. My heart ached with so many emotions, I couldn\u0027t keep track of them all. I tried to forget our horrid night, but it started replaying itself in my mind. I shook my head to clear the bad memories, and softly kissed his hair, running my hand down his back. Gently, I shifted out from under him. He stirred, but didn\u0027t wake up. As I pulled away from him, he instinctively reached out for me, grabbing my legs again and holding me tight, still asleep. That stirred my heart again, and swallowing, I gently released his hold on me. He cringed and said \"no\" and for a moment, I thought he was awake, but after another minute of watching him, he didn\u0027t move again or speak again. I sighed and ran a hand through his hair. Tears sprang, yet again, and I desperately needed out of that room. I fixed the blanket around him so he would stay warm, and then slipped from his room and into mine. Chapter 17 Like It Should Be The next morning, Kellan came into the kitchen after me. He was wearing the same clothes, and his hair was styled back from how it had dried overnight. His eyes were dreadfully tired and still a little red; he had cried an awful lot last night. I looked over at him uncertainly. He stopped in the doorway and paused, looking at me equally uncertain. Finally, he sighed and came up to the coffee pot where I was standing, waiting for it to finish brewing. He held his hands up in front of him. \"Truce?\" I nodded slowly. \"Truce.\" He leaned back against the counter, putting his hands behind him. \"Thank you...for staying with me last night,\" he whispered, staring at the floor. \"Kellan-\" He interrupted me. \"I shouldn\u0027t have said what I did, that\u0027s not who you are. I\u0027m sorry if I scared you. I was so angry, but, I wouldn\u0027t ever hurt you, Kiera...not intentionally.\" He met my gaze, his voice was calm, but his eyes looked worried. \"I was way out of line. I never should have put you in that position. You\u0027re not... You are in no way a...\" he looked away, embarrassed, \"...a whore,\" he finished softly. \"Kellan-\" He interrupted me again. \"I never would have...\" He sighed and in a barely audible whisper, he said, \"I wouldn\u0027t ever force you, Kiera. That\u0027s not... I\u0027m not...\" He froze and stopped talking, looking at the ground again. \"I know you wouldn\u0027t.\" I suddenly didn\u0027t know what else to say. I was equally responsible, and I felt horrible for my part in what had happened. \"I\u0027m sorry. You were right. I...I led you on.\" I lightly grabbed his cheek and forced him to look at me fully. His gorgeous face was horribly sad and equally remorseful. \"I\u0027m sorry for all of it, Kellan.\" His pained eyes broke my heart. He looked at me oddly. \"No...I was just mad. I was wrong. You didn\u0027t do anything. You don\u0027t need to apologize for-\" I cut him off. \"Yes, I do.\" I lowered my already low voice. \"We both know I did just as much as you. I went just as far as you did.\" He frowned slightly. \"You clearly told me no...repeatedly. I didn\u0027t listen... repeatedly.\" He sighed again and pulled my hand away from his cheek. \"I was horrible. I went too far, much too far.\" He ran a hand down his face. \"I\u0027m...I\u0027m so sorry.\" \"Kellan...no, I wasn\u0027t being clear. I sent mixed signals.\" My words may have been telling him no, but my body certainly had been telling him something else. How can he feel responsible for that? His voice heated. \"No, is clear, Kiera. Stop, is pretty damn clear.\" \"You\u0027re not a monster, Kellan. You never would have-\" He cut me off again. \"I\u0027m no angel either, Kiera...remember? And you have no idea what I\u0027m capable of,\" he finished quietly, eyeing me warily. I didn\u0027t know what he meant by that, but I refused to believe that he would ever, that he could ever...force me. \"We both messed up, Kellan,\" I said, softly reaching out for his cheek again. \"But you would never force yourself on me.\" He watched me with a torn look on his face, and then he pulled me to his chest in a tight embrace. I threw my arms around his neck and for just a moment, let myself believe that it was months ago, and we were just two friends giving one another a moment\u0027s comfort. But...we weren\u0027t. Our friendship had enflamed into passion, and once ignited, that burn was impossible to turn back down. \"You were right. We have to end this, Kiera.\" He took a hand and brushed aside a tear on one side, then the other; I hadn\u0027t even realized I was crying. Then he cupped my face, stroking my cheek with his thumb. It was such a tender gesture that my heart sped, but I knew he was right. I had known it awhile ago. \"I know.\" I closed my eyes and more tears dropped to my cheeks. His lips brushed mine softly. I half-sobbed and pulled him harder against me. He kissed me back, but not in the way I expected. It was so different, soft and tender, in a way our kiss had never been before. It terrified and thrilled me. His thumb continued to stroke my cheek softly. He kissed me tenderly for a minute more, then sighing, he pulled away. He moved his hand from my cheek and ran his fingers through my hair and down my back. \"You were right, you made your choice.\" He pulled me close to him, almost touching my lips. \"I still want you,\" he growled intensely, then his voice softened, and he pulled away again. \"But not while you\u0027re his. Not like this, not like last night.\" He said it wistfully, his eyes looking even more tired. \"This,\" he ran a finger down my lips lightly, as more tears fell on my cheeks, \"...is over.\" He exhaled heavily, his own eyes glistening. \"I don\u0027t seem to be very good at leaving you alone.\" He dropped his hand from my lips and swallowed. \"I won\u0027t let last night happen again. I won\u0027t touch you again. This time...I promise.\" His tone rang with finality. Then, smiling sadly, he turned to leave. He stopped and paused at the doorway, turning to face me again. \"You and Denny are good together. You should stay with him.\" He looked down and tapped the doorway with his hand a couple times, and then nodding his head, he looked back up at my face, a tear dropping to his cheek. \"I\u0027ll make this right. It will be like it should be.\" Then he turned and left. I watched him leave, confused, tears dripping from my eyes. Once I couldn\u0027t hear him anymore, I sighed and put my head in my hands. Isn\u0027t this exactly what I wanted? Why do I feel so sad then, like I had suddenly just lost everything? Kellan stayed true to his word, he never again made any inappropriate moves towards me. In fact, he tried to never touch me. He stayed as far from me in a room as possible, without being obvious about it. He would make sure we never brushed against each other, and he would even apologize whenever we accidentally did touch each other. He still watched my every move though. I could seemingly always feel his intense eyes on me. In some ways, I would have preferred his touch to the intensity of those stares. I tried to focus on school, but my heart was only half in it. The lectures, while still interesting and thought provoking, weren\u0027t as captivating as they once were, and my mind drifted on more than one occasion. I tried to focus more on Denny. He had perked up some since our evening at the club, which made me feel horribly guilty, but he was still miserably trudging through his work day. I listened as he went on and on about Max and the meaningless tasks he had him doing, but in all honesty, I wasn\u0027t really hearing a word of it. My mind continually drifted. I tried to focus on Jenny and Kate, on being closer friends with them. We sometimes all met for coffee before work, and they would chat about the guys they were seeing. Not really having a whole lot to add to that conversation, I would listen half-heartedly, and my mind would drift...to Kellan. I even tried to focus on my family, on calling them more often. My mom picked up on my mood, and immediately wanted me to come home and see her. My dad blamed Denny for breaking my heart when he left, which I assured him he didn\u0027t. If anything, I broke his, when I dumped him for ditching me, even though that had never his intention. And my sister...well, I couldn\u0027t even talk to her yet. I wasn\u0027t mad at her or anything. I\u0027d even grudgingly forgiven Kellan in my head. Well, maybe not forgiven him, but I had forced the memory to the very back corner of my mind. But I couldn\u0027t speak to Anna yet. I couldn\u0027t even bear to hear his name pass her lips. Not yet...or ever. As the days went by, I found myself missing Kellan - missing his touch, missing our quiet conversations, as we cuddled in the kitchen over coffee, missing his laugh, as he would relay a funny story while driving me all over town. I began to wonder if we should try again. Maybe this time, we could find a way to make it work... \"Kellan,\" I said softly, as he walked by me one morning when I came down for coffee. \"Please don\u0027t leave. We should be able to be alone together.\" He paused and looked back at me, his blue eyes sad. \"It\u0027s better if we\u0027re not, Kiera. It\u0027s safer.\" I frowned. \"Safer? You say that like we\u0027re time bombs or something.\" He half-smiled and raised his eyebrows. \"Aren\u0027t we?\" His smile dropped and he suddenly looked exhausted. \"Look what happened. I\u0027ll never forgive myself for talking to you like that.\" I blushed at the horrible memory and looked down. \"Don\u0027t...you were right. Horribly rude, but right.\" I peeked up at him under my eyebrows. He cringed and took a step towards me. \"Kiera, you\u0027re not-\" I cut him off, not wanting to start that horrid conversation again. \"Can\u0027t we have just some of our friendship back? Can\u0027t we talk?\" I made a move towards him, until we were only a step apart. \"Can\u0027t we ever touch?\" He immediately took two steps back and swallowed, shaking his head. \"No, Kiera. You were right. We can\u0027t go back to that. It was stupid to even try.\" I felt tears stinging. I missed how it used to be, so much. \"But, I want to. I want to touch you, just hold you...no more.\" I was in withdrawals from my addiction. I wanted his warm arms to slip around me. I wanted to put my head on his shoulder. It was all I wanted. His tired eyes closed and he took a deep breath before opening them. \"You shouldn\u0027t. You should only hold Denny. He\u0027s a good guy for you...I\u0027m not.\" \"You\u0027re a good guy too.\" I couldn\u0027t stop the thought of him sobbing in my arms. I\u0027d never seen someone more remorseful. \"I\u0027m really not,\" he whispered, as he walked out of the room.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thoughtless-thoughtless-1/page-49.html","bookId":1887,"book":{"id":1887,"title":"Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1)","description":"Storyline: Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1) For almost two years now, Kiera\u0027s boyfriend, Denny, has been everything she\u0027s ever wanted: loving, tender and endlessly devoted to her.
