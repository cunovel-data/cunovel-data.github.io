I wanted to cringe away from him, and then felt guilty for feeling that. It wasn\u0027t Denny\u0027s fault that I was miserable. Aside from how much time he had to commit to his job, which I constantly reminded myself was not his fault either, Denny hadn\u0027t done anything wrong since he\u0027d come back to me. He was warm, sweet, funny, charming, and constantly trying to make me happy. His moods were near constant, his love and loyalty never wavering. I was always sure of how he felt about me...unlike Kellan. So why did I feel such loss for losing Kellan? And can you lose something that was never yours to begin with? I debated that as Denny sat beside me and kissed me softly.\n \"Hey, I was thinking...\"\n I startled as I realized Denny was speaking to me. \"What?\" I asked, forcing my mind back to the present.\n He half-grinned. \"You\u0027re not quite awake yet are you?\" He shook his head lightly as he slipped his shoes on. \"It can wait, why don\u0027t you go back to sleep.\" He looked over and smiled warmly. \"You don\u0027t have to get up with me every morning, you know. I know you come in late.\" He leaned over and kissed me softly again. \"You need your sleep too.\"\n I cringed, knowing that Denny wasn\u0027t really the reason I woke up early every morning. Wanting to fight off painful thoughts, that I shouldn\u0027t be having in the first place, I made Denny continue on his original train of thought. \"No, go ahead, I\u0027m awake...what were you thinking?\"\n He tied his shoes and then sat on the bed with his elbows on his knees. He looked over at me a little sheepishly and ran a hand along his jaw. Insanely curious over what was making him so uncomfortable, and a little worried about what he knew that would make him look that way, I hesitantly asked, \"What is it?\"\n Not noticing the reluctance in my question, he shyly said, \"Have you thought about your winter break next month?\"\n I instantly relaxed. \"No, not really. I guess I figured we\u0027d go home Christmas Eve and stay for the weekend.\" I looked over at him concerned. \"Can you not get the time off?\"\n He grinned widely at me. \"I actually demanded the whole week off.\"\n I eyed him warily. Denny wasn\u0027t the demanding type. \"You demanded?\" I cocked an eyebrow at him.\n He laughed at my expression. \"Okay...apparently the office shuts down that week. Nobody works it...not even Max.\" He grinned sheepishly again. \"So I\u0027m truly free for a week...and...\" he looked down and laced his fingers together, \"I\u0027d like to take you home.\"\n I blinked, confused. Isn\u0027t that what I just said? \"Okay, I kind of figured...\"\n He looked over at me, his face serious. \"My home, Kiera...Australia. I\u0027d like you to meet my parents.\"\n I looked down, surprised. \"Oh.\" I had always wanted to meet them, even though that thought terrified me. But so much had changed since then. They would know. Somehow, the parental sixth sense would kick in, and with just a glance, they would declare me a harlot and denounce me in front of him. I just knew it. I couldn\u0027t go. He wouldn\u0027t understand that though.\n \"But Christmas, Denny? I\u0027ve never missed one with my family.\" I sighed brokenly, from my previous thought and the thought of the holidays away from my loved ones. \"Couldn\u0027t we go another time?\"\n He sighed and I looked back to where he was studying his hands. \"I don\u0027t know when that will be, Kiera. Who knows when I\u0027ll be free from Max again?\" He sighed a second time, and ran a hand through his hair before turning his head to look at me. \"Will you just think about it?\"\n I could only nod. Great, one more thing for me to think about. As if my mind wasn\u0027t full enough. Denny looked at me thoughtfully, then stood and finished getting ready. I was still sitting on the bed, thinking, when he kissed me goodbye.\n A big chunk of me was worried about what his parents would think of me, but watching Kellan at work that night brought a different heartbreak closer to the surface. I would miss him...horrifically. Watching him sit at his table with his friends, watching me, I thought maybe I should just talk to him about it. But I didn\u0027t. I knew what his answer would be anyway - go with Denny, the time apart will be good for us, you should be with him, he\u0027s the guy for you, etc. etc. etc. Most of it was what my head was already telling me, but my heart? We could possibly stretch Denny\u0027s time off to almost two weeks with the weekends, and two weeks away from Kellan\u0027s piercing blue eyes...well, just the thought made my addictive withdrawals go into hyper drive.\n A couple of days after Denny\u0027s proposition, I awoke from a deep sleep, feeling confused. I felt odd, and I didn\u0027t know why. I must have been dreaming again. I had dreamt about the last painful kiss I had shared with Kellan all this week. Our amazingly tender kiss, I had never wanted it to end. But then afterwards, there was the sadness in his eyes, that final devastating tear on his cheek as he left the room, and his ominous last words. I sighed softly, conflicted.\n Light fingers trailed down my hair, my back. I cringed a bit. I always felt so guilty when Denny touched me while I was thinking about Kellan, and lately, I was usually thinking about Kellan. I was still turning over the thought of leaving with Denny or not. Even if we didn\u0027t end up going to Australia, we\u0027d still go home to my parents\u0027 place, and Anna would be there. It was an almost lose-lose situation for me. I\u0027m either going to another Country, to face people who will surely see straight to the heart of my deception towards their son, or I\u0027m going to face Anna, who won\u0027t be able to contain the horrid affair she\u0027d with Kellan for an entire week. That brought me full circle to the fact that, either way, I was going to have to leave Kellan for a time. And, god was I going to miss him, even if we had ended things...\n \"Mornin\u0027.\" A familiar non-accented voice pierced my heart.\n Instantly snapping out of my thoughts, I spun around to come face to face with a very sexy, very satisfied looking Kellan, staring right back at me. I instantly became more aware of my surroundings. I glanced down to the strange sheet barely covering my naked chest, barely above Kellan\u0027s naked waist. I glanced around the room...his room. My heart raced as I watched the late-morning light filter through the window.\n \"Oh god...\" I whispered, as he casually brought a hand to my cheek and pulled me in for a kiss.\n He laughed, deep in his throat. \"No...just me,\" he teased, kissing me softly.\n I pushed him back, all too aware of his naked chest under my fingertips, the rest of his bare body just inches from mine. \"What happened? I don\u0027t remember. Why are we...? Did we...?\" Great, now I wasn\u0027t forming complete thoughts.\n He pulled farther back, looking confused. \"Are you okay?\" He grinned mischievously. \"I know this morning was pretty intense, but did I break you or something?\" He winked at me and went in for another kiss.\n Panic swept through me. \"Oh god, we did. Kellan, we ended this. We aren\u0027t... We can\u0027t...\"\n \"Kiera, you\u0027re starting to freak me out.\" His brow scrunched together in concern.\n \"Just tell me what\u0027s going on!\" My voice was a little too high, and loud. I quieted it with great effort. \"Where\u0027s Denny?\"\n \"He\u0027s at work, Kiera. We always do this when he\u0027s at work.\" He sat up on his elbow and looked at me, frowning. \"You really don\u0027t remember this?\"\n \"No...\" I whispered. \"What do you mean...always?\"\n He leaned over me, lightly stroking my cheek with his finger. \"Kiera, Denny leaves for work, we come in here, we have...\" he bit his lip and smiled seductively, \"...hot...sweaty...sex...before you have to leave for school.\" He ran his fingers back through my hair. \"Sometimes, like today, you skip school, and stay in bed with me for most of the day.\" He kissed me gently, tenderly. \"We\u0027ve been doing this for weeks. How can you forget something like that?\"\n I stared at him, shocked. \"But...but, no. After the fight in the car, we ended things. You ended things. You promised...\"\n He smiled wryly. \"I also said I wasn\u0027t good at staying away from you. We\u0027re meant to be, Kiera. We need each other. Staying away was, impossible. It\u0027s been so much better since we gave in.\" He kissed me again, slowly, even more tenderly. \"I\u0027ll show you...\"\n Confusion overwhelmed me, froze me. I had no memory of anything intimate, other than our last painful embrace in the kitchen. Wouldn\u0027t I remember sleeping with him every day? Was he drugging me or something? I could no longer ponder it, as he was kissing me so lovingly and cupping my cheek in his hand. I relaxed into it. I returned his kiss fully, eagerly. I did miss this. He leaned over me, forcing me to my back and slid his hand down my neck, my chest, my waist. My breath quickened, my heart raced.\n He smiled and kissed my cheek, my jaw, my neck. \"See...you do remember...\"\n I closed my eyes, trying to have some recollection of how I got here. He moved on top of me, his knee sliding between mine. He brought his lips back to my mouth and his kiss intensified. I gasped at the sensations running through my body. I didn\u0027t know how to stop this. I didn\u0027t know if I should. I considered caving, and giving in to something I was apparently frequently giving in to anyway, when suddenly, the door burst open.\n Denny stood there, watching us in horror, his eyes enraged. \"Kiera?\"\n I sat up quickly and pushed a very calm looking Kellan off of me. \"Denny...wait, I can explain.\" I had no idea how to explain any of this.\n He strode over to the bed, eyes wild with fury. \"Explain?\" He leaned over me. \"There is no need for you to explain that you\u0027re a whore! I can clearly see that for myself!\"\n I started to sob. Kellan slowly sat up on the bed, looking at me amused.\n Denny grabbed my arm and shook it. \"Kiera?\" His voice was gentle and tender, but his eyes were still enraged. He did it again and I gaped at him in confusion, his soft voice, in no way matched his enraged face. \"Kiera?\"\n I woke up with a start. It was night. I was in my pajamas. I was in my room...and Denny was calmly lying beside me in bed, lightly shaking my arm. \"You\u0027re having a nightmare, it\u0027s all right.\" His accent was warm and comforting.\n I blinked back tears. Oh thank god...just a dream. Suddenly, I blinked back tears of sadness. Just a dream...\n \"You want to talk about it?\" he asked sleepily.\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t... I don\u0027t remember.\" I looked over at him cautiously. \"Did I say anything?\"\n He shook his head. \"No...you were just whimpering, shaking. You looked scared.\"\n Relief washed through me. \"Oh.\" I sat up on the bed, and he started to rise with me. \"No, go back to bed. I\u0027m just going to get some water.\"\n He nodded and slumped back down, closing his eyes. I leaned over and kissed his forehead, making him smile, and then I stood and made my way quietly out the door. That had been one hell of an intense dream. I couldn\u0027t even look at Kellan\u0027s door as I walked past it. What had brought that on? I wasn\u0027t sure, that worried me...\n I quietly walked into the kitchen, still thinking about the dream, and stopped dead in my tracks in the doorway. Kellan was in there and surprisingly, not alone. He was pushing a tall, leggy brunette up against the fridge. One bare, feminine leg was wrapped around one of his and Kellan\u0027s hand was sliding up her short skirt. They were voraciously kissing, the woman completely lost in her thrill of being with him. He was more aware; he glanced over at me as I entered the room.\n Shock passed his face for a second, as the woman turned her attentions to his neck, his jaw, his ear. Her hand stroked down his chest coming to rest on his jeans. Her hand slid firmly down and back up the front of his jeans and she moaned, rather loudly. My stomach rose and I wanted to leave the room, but I couldn\u0027t stop staring at them.\n Composing himself, he turned to the woman. She tried to kiss him, but he deftly pulled away from her. \"Sweetheart...\" he cooed at her, and she gazed at him adoringly, biting her lip. \"Could you wait upstairs for me? I need to speak with my roommate.\"\n She never once even looked at me. She never took her eyes off of him, only nodded and gasped as he leaned in to kiss her deeply again. She looked about ready to lose herself in him again, but he pulled away from her and led her firmly to the entryway. \"The one on the right. I\u0027ll be up in a second,\" he cooed again and she giggled, practically fleeing the room to get to his bed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thoughtless-thoughtless-1/page-50.html","bookId":1887,"book":{"id":1887,"title":"Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1) \n For almost two years now, Kiera\u0027s boyfriend, Denny, has been everything she\u0027s ever wanted: loving, tender and endlessly devoted to her.
