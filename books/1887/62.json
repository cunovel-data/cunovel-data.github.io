{"id":84494,"no":62,"title":"Page 62","content":"After an eternity, that was entirely too short, he pulled back and quietly said, \"We should get going.\"\\n\\n \"Wait, you brought me all the way up to this highly romantic...vacant...spot, and all you wanted to do, was talk?\" I raised an eyebrow at him suggestively.\\n\\n He grinned and shook his head. \"My, my - look how I\u0027ve corrupted you.\"\\n\\n I smirked and laughed.\\n\\n \"Come on, I\u0027ll take us home.\" He started leading me to the elevators while I pouted. Noticing my expression, he said, \"Kiera, it\u0027s getting late...well, early, and you don\u0027t want to be late from your ball.\" He frowned as he looked at me. \"It\u0027s not your carriage that will turn into a pumpkin.\"\\n\\n I rolled my eyes at his analogy, but he was right, I did need to get home. I pushed aside my disappointment, and my surprise that I actually was disappointed. I had kind of expected... I blushed, and didn\u0027t bother finishing that thought.\\n\\n We finished our circular walk back to the elevators, and I took one last look at the spectacular city below us and the spectacular man before me. I smiled as he pushed the button and we waited for the doors to open.\\n\\n \"Fine, your loss though.\" I pulled him through the now open elevator door by his t-shirt. \"I\u0027ve been told that we\u0027re amazing,\" I teased. He grinned wickedly and pulled me in for a deep kiss, as the doors closed behind us and we descended.\\n\\n On our way out of the Needle, he looked over to me with a somber expression. I looked back at him curiously, and butterflies tickled my stomach. He stopped us, as we stepped up to his car, and cocked his head to the side as he regarded me.\\n\\n \"There is one more thing I wanted to talk to you about.\"\\n\\n The butterflies tickling my stomach were doing somersaults now. \"What?\" The word was barely more than a whisper.\\n\\n Abruptly, his grim expression changed to a wry grin and a cocked eyebrow. \"I can\u0027t believe you stole my car...really?\"\\n\\n I laughed at my remembered joy ride...then I remembered why I had taken it, and gave him a sour face. \"You had kind of deserved it at the time.\" I lightly poked him in the chest. \"You\u0027re lucky it came back to you in one piece.\"\\n\\n He frowned as he opened my door. \"Hmmmm...in the future, could you just slap me again, and leave my baby alone?\"\\n\\n I grabbed his chin, as I put my foot in the car. \"In the future, could you not go on anymore \u0027dates\u0027.\"\\n\\n His look was somber again, until he grinned and kissed me lightly. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" He lightly shook his head at me, as I sat down. I smiled to myself as he closed the door and walked around to his side of the car.\\n\\n I snuggled into his shoulder as we silently drove home. The comfort of our silence was as palpable to me as the warmth of his skin as he held my hand in his. It was only now, freely touching him, freely giving myself over to him, that I could fully comprehend how much I had missed him. How severe my addiction had been. I smiled inwardly, at the memory of him saying that I was his addiction. It pleased me tremendously that we felt the same draw towards each other. Although, I still didn\u0027t see what he saw in me.\\n\\n Even after we pulled into the driveway and he turned the engine off, we stayed locked together in the car, my head on his shoulder, and his arm around my waist, pulling me in tight. Neither one of us wanted to face the cold reality of life outside this cozy vehicle.\\n\\n Kissing my head, Kellan broke our comfortable silence. \"I dream about you sometimes...about what it would have been like, if Denny hadn\u0027t come back, if you were mine. Holding your hand, walking into the bar with you on my arm...not having to hide anything anymore. Telling the world that I love you.\"\\n\\n I smiled and looked up at him. \"You mentioned that you dreamt about me once. You never said about what though.\" I kissed his cheek and smiled warmly at him. \"I dream about you too sometimes.\" I immediately blushed, remembering some of my steamier dreams of him.\\n\\n \"Really? Huh, we\u0027re kind of pathetic, aren\u0027t we?\" He laughed, then noticing my blush he half-smiled adorably at me. \"And what are your dreams about?\"\\n\\n I giggled like an idiot. \"Honestly, I mostly dream about sleeping with you.\"\\n\\n He laughed for a good minute, while I blushed and laughed with him. \"God...is that all I am to you?\" he teased, grabbing my hand and lacing our fingers together.\\n\\n I stopped laughing and gazed at him. \"No...no, you\u0027re so much more.\" My tone got serious on me.\\n\\n He nodded, not laughing anymore as well. \"Good, because you mean everything to me.\"\\n\\n Feelings flooded through me for him, and I snuggled closer and clutched his hand tightly in mine. I never wanted to leave this car. I never wanted Kellan to leave this car. But I knew we couldn\u0027t stay like this forever.\\n\\n Kellan broke through my thoughts, with a question I didn\u0027t want him to ask. \"What did you tell Denny?\"\\n\\n I cringed a bit, knowing my lie probably wasn\u0027t as good as what he would have come up with. And the thought of him being the better liar, didn\u0027t entirely thrill me. \"That you slept with my sister and broke her heart. That\u0027s believable, everyone saw you at the bar together. He seemed to buy it.\"\\n\\n Kellan was looking at me with his brow furrowed. \"That won\u0027t work, Kiera,\" he said slowly.\\n\\n My heart rate started increasing. \"Yes, it will. I\u0027ll talk to Anna, she\u0027ll back me up. I\u0027ve had to lie for her before. I won\u0027t tell her why, of course...and Denny probably will never ask her about it anyway.\"\\n\\n His brow still furrowed, he shook his head. \"I wasn\u0027t thinking of your sister, that\u0027s not why that won\u0027t work.\"\\n\\n I looked at him, confused, until a sudden realization hit me. \"Oh god...Griffin.\"\\n\\n His brow furrowed more and he nodded. \"Yeah...Griffin, he really does tell everyone.\" His brow relaxed and he looked at me amused. \"I don\u0027t know how you managed to miss that. You\u0027ve gotten good at tuning him out.\" His amusement didn\u0027t last long and he frowned. \"When Denny hears that it isn\u0027t true...\"\\n\\n \"What was I supposed to tell him, Kellan? I had to come up with something.\" I looked down at my hands. \"You know, it\u0027s possible that you both...\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I looked back up to where he was smiling warmly at me. \"It\u0027s not possible.\" His frown returned. \"Griffin is very...specific on what he tells people. It\u0027s not just that he slept with her. It\u0027s that he slept with her, and I didn\u0027t, like he stole her away from me or something. He\u0027s got this weird competitive thing-\"\\n\\n I cut him off. \"I\u0027ve noticed that.\" I sighed and lay my head back on the seat. \"God, I didn\u0027t even think about that.\"\\n\\n He sighed. \"I can\u0027t guarantee you anything, but I could try talking to Griffin. Maybe get him to alter the story. I\u0027ll probably have to threaten to kick him out of the band. Actually, I may just do that anyway.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" I exclaimed, a little loudly, and I slapped a hand over my mouth and looked fearfully at the door.\\n\\n Kellan looked at me oddly. \"You want me to keep him in the band?\"\\n\\n I looked at him wryly, a faint smile coming to my lips, until I remembered my real objection. \"No, I don\u0027t want him to know - ever! He won\u0027t stay silent about that. He\u0027d tell everyone, in horrifying detail. He\u0027d tell Denny! Please, don\u0027t ever-\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" He put his hands on my shoulders, as I was starting to panic. \"It\u0027s okay. I won\u0027t tell him anything, Kiera.\" I breathed out in relief and he sighed again. \"It wouldn\u0027t matter anyway. He\u0027s told too many people already.\" He looked at me sadly, as he brushed a lock of hair behind my ear. \"I\u0027m sorry, but Denny will find out that you lied to him...and then he\u0027ll start to wonder why.\"\\n\\n I gazed up at him, swallowing roughly. \"And then what? After he knows I lied, how long do you think we have?\" I asked quietly.\\n\\n \"How long before Denny figures out that we\u0027ve slept together?\" He grabbed my hand and interlaced our fingers. \"Well, if you stay out here with me all night, he\u0027ll probably have it figured out by morning.\" He chuckled and rested his cheek against my head. Sighing, he said, \"I don\u0027t know, Kiera. A few hours, maybe? A couple of days at the most.\"\\n\\n I pulled back and looked up at him, alarmed. \"Hours? But...he has no real proof. He couldn\u0027t possibly think... \"\\n\\n \"Kiera...\" He released my hand and stroked my cheek. \"He has all the proof he needs, right here.\" He brushed a lock of hair behind my ear again.\\n\\n \"What do we do, Kellan?\" I whispered, suddenly afraid that Denny could somehow hear us, all the way out here in the car.\\n\\n He looked at me thoughtfully for a moment. \"I can start the car, and we can be in Oregon before the sun comes up.\"\\n\\n Run away? He wants to run away with me? My insides tightened. I could imagine it - running off into the night with him and never looking back. Giving up school, work, and my friends, everything...but leaving Denny. A sharp pain wrenched through me, and I thought I might get sick, right there in the car. The thought of never seeing him again, of never seeing those warm, brown eyes sparkling at me...\\n\\n \"Hey.\" Kellan\u0027s hand stroked my hair. \"Breathe, Kiera, it\u0027s okay...breathe.\" He cupped my cheek as I struggled to do what he asked. \"Look at me...breathe.\"\\n\\n I stared into his deep blue eyes and focused only on my breathing. I hadn\u0027t realized I was starting to hyperventilate. I shook my head, as tears started to fall. \"Not like that. He\u0027s too much a part of me. I need time. I can\u0027t talk about this yet.\" He nodded, and his eyes started to glisten. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Kellan.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be...\" he whispered. \"Don\u0027t be sorry for loving someone.\" He pulled me into his shoulder and kissed the top of my head. \"Don\u0027t worry, Kiera. I\u0027ll think of something. I\u0027ll fix this, I promise.\"\\n\\n Chapter 21\\n\\n I Love You\\n\\n He held me in his arms in his chilly car, our breath making small clouds of steam but neither of us willing to leave the safety and solitude of that vehicle, and eventually the first morning rays did poke through the sky. There was a fog in the air that hovered just above the pavement, making the entire world seem ethereal and dreamlike. I wanted this moment to be a dream, one I would never have to wake up from, but those golden morning rays brought more than just light to my world, they brought reality as well.\\n\\n \"You should go inside,\" he whispered, hugging me tight.\\n\\n I pulled back and looked at him. \"What about you? Aren\u0027t you coming?\" I tried to keep the panic from my voice when I said that.\\n\\n He looked at me calmly. \"There\u0027s something I need to do first.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n He smiled, but didn\u0027t answer my question. \"Go on...it will be okay.\" He kissed me softly on the lips, and then leaned way over me to unlatch the door. As I got out, he whispered, \"I love you,\" then he slid over to my side and tilted his head up, wanting me to kiss him again.\\n\\n I nodded and bent down to softly press my lips to his, unable to speak through the lump in my throat. Then he slid back over, started the car and pulled away, while I brushed a couple of tears off of my cheeks.\\n\\n Denny was sound asleep when I came into our room. Guilt flooded through me as I grabbed a change of clothes and quietly went to the bathroom to freshen up. I glanced at Kellan\u0027s door as I finished, and had an odd desire to lie on his bed. I didn\u0027t. That would be a little unexplainable, if Denny woke up and found me there. I made my way downstairs to make some coffee, and sat at the table processing everything that had happened in the past several hours. What a difference one day can make. I sipped my coffee and stared at the empty chair that Kellan usually sat at. Where was he? Why wouldn\u0027t he want to spend today with me?\\n\\n Denny kissed me tenderly goodbye when he came down awhile later, all ready for his normal day of work. Guilt washed through me again as his lips brushed mine. I had an odd feeling of betrayal flash through me, and not betrayal for being with Kellan, no betrayal for being with Denny. I\u0027d felt guilty before, but nothing quite as strong as pure betrayal. It took me by surprise, but I firmly pushed it back. I couldn\u0027t think about that yet. For right now, Denny was my boyfriend, but, I suppose...Kellan was too.\\n\\n What do I do? This decision suddenly overwhelmed my now simple seeming question of where to spend winter break. Can\u0027t I just go back to worrying about that instead? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thoughtless-thoughtless-1/page-62.html","bookId":1887,"book":{"id":1887,"title":"Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1)","description":"Storyline: Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1) \\n For almost two years now, Kiera\u0027s boyfriend, Denny, has been everything she\u0027s ever wanted: loving, tender and endlessly devoted to her.
