That made me feel...well, it was almost as good as the sex.\" He grinned devilishly and I laughed, feeling my face heat.\\n\\n He sighed and looked away from me. \"I wish I had been strong enough to stay...but I wasn\u0027t. I chickened out. I couldn\u0027t tell you what I had just figured out.\" He looked back to me with wistful eyes. \"That I desperately loved you.\"\\n\\n I curled my fingers through the back of his hair, wishing I had something profound to say. \"Kellan...I...\"\\n\\n He continued, not letting me finish the thought I didn\u0027t have any way. \"I wanted to leave when you went back to him. After having you...it was so hard to watch you with him. To watch you love him, how I wanted you to love me. It made me so angry. I\u0027m so sorry.\"\\n\\n I felt my eyes water as I remembered that time, and hugged him tight against me. I hadn\u0027t known. I had assumed I was just another conquest to him. I had hurt him...deeply. \"I\u0027m the one who\u0027s sorry, Kellan...\" My voice trailed off.\\n\\n He sighed and smiling, looked down. \"And then, when I finally got the strength to leave...you asked me to stay, and I got my hopes up. I started to believe that maybe...at the very least, you cared for me.\" He looked at me crookedly for a second. \"You seemed to really want me to stay.\"\\n\\n My face heated in embarrassment at just how \"badly\" I had wanted him to stay. He smiled at my reaction and then his face smoothed into seriousness. \"You probably didn\u0027t hear me, but I told you I loved you that night. I couldn\u0027t seem to stop it from slipping out.\"\\n\\n \"Kellan, I-\"\\n\\n He interrupted me. \"Then you cried for Denny, and I wanted to die again.\" I felt more tears drip down my cheeks, at hurting him, yet again. He watched my tears thoughtfully. \"That night was so...intense for me. I wanted so badly to hold you after, but you were so upset...you looked ill.\" He swallowed a lump in his throat. \"I made you feel ill. You hated what we had done, and it had meant so much to me.\" He peered at me from the corner of his eye, as he nearly looked away. \"I hated you after that,\" he whispered.\\n\\n More tears fell on my cheeks, and I sniffled a bit. He sighed and fully looked away. \"I almost left that night. I wanted to...\" He turned to look back at me, and grabbed my cheeks softly with his hands. His expression softened and his eyes gazed into mine adoringly. I felt my eyes dry up, watching his perfect face stare at me. \"I couldn\u0027t leave you. I remembered the look on your face, when I told you I was leaving. No one\u0027s looked at me that way before. No one\u0027s ever cried for me before. No one\u0027s asked me to stay before...no one. I convinced myself you cared for me.\" He shook his head lightly and smiled. \"I knew then, that I would stay with you...even if it killed me.\"\\n\\n He pulled me to him for a deep kiss. I eagerly kissed him back, wanting to make up for hurting him, in some small way. When I was nearly breathless, he pulled away and grabbing my hand, we started walking again.\\n\\n He looked over to me as we walked stories above the peaceful-looking city below. \"I am sorry about being so...amorous with you. I never wanted to hurt you. I simply...wanted you.\" He smiled crookedly at me, making me miss a step. He laughed softly and continued. \"When you asked, I did try to keep it...well, you had to know on some level that we were never innocent, right?\" He looked over at me with an eyebrow raised, and I grudgingly nodded. He smiled. \"Well, I tried to keep it less...sinful then.\"\\n\\n He glared down at me. \"You made that shockingly hard to do.\"\\n\\n \"Me?\" I asked, confused. He was the absurdly sensual one.\\n\\n He shook his head in mock exasperation. \"Yes, you. If you weren\u0027t dressed provocatively, or throwing yourself on me provocatively, or...\" he grinned at me indecently, \"making very provocative noises...\" I blushed very deeply and he laughed. \"If you weren\u0027t doing all that, then you were simply just too adorable to resist.\" He glared at me again. \"I am only a man after all.\"\\n\\n I shook my head at him. I hadn\u0027t done any of those things, well, except for the unfortunate noises part. \"You\u0027re absurd, Kellan.\" I rolled my eyes and he laughed charmingly.\\n\\n \"Again...you don\u0027t realize how attractive you are to me.\" He grinned mischievously. \"After all this time, I would think that was painfully obvious,\" he murmured, and I playfully elbowed him. He laughed, then more seriously said, \"I am sorry, I took it too far.\" I looked up into his suddenly sad again eyes as we continued walking. \"I should have let you end it...you were right to stop it. Everything that happened later was my fault. I should have let you go. I just, couldn\u0027t...\"\\n\\n \"Kellan, no, it-\"\\n\\n He interrupted me again. \"The club, that was...intense. I wanted you so bad, and you wanted me too. I considered pulling you into a bathroom and taking you right there. I think you may have even let me?\" He looked down at me, and I could only nod speechlessly; he could have taken me anywhere. He started to smile, but frowned instead. \"I saw Denny coming. I couldn\u0027t do it. I pushed you away, praying desperately, that you would tell him you wanted me. That you would choose to leave with me. You...didn\u0027t, and it killed me.\"\\n\\n I stopped walking again and he took a step, then slowly turned to look back at me. He looked hurt again. I stepped up to him and put a hand on his cheek. How badly had I repeatedly hurt him? I felt horrible inside.\\n\\n He gazed at me, lost in the memory. \"I couldn\u0027t even come home. I took your sister to Griffin\u0027s. I think I bored her. I wasn\u0027t much fun, moping on the couch all night like I did. Eventually, she gave up on me and turned her attention to Griffin.\" He shrugged. \"And well, you know how that ended.\"\\n\\n I swallowed roughly. I had assumed so much that was not true about that night.\\n\\n \"I was...I am, really freaked out about what happened...in the car,\" he said quietly. \"What I said. What I did. I didn\u0027t know you thought I slept with Anna, until that moment, and I was so angry at you for...Denny, I let you believe it. I...embellished it.\" He looked down, embarrassed. \"Being angry with you, almost made me want you even more.\"\\n\\n I had to swallow three times, before I could speak. \"Kellan...you have no idea how difficult that was for me. How hard that was to ask you to stop, when my whole body was begging for you not to.\" I stroked his cheek and considered kissing him, when he swallowed roughly.\\n\\n \"You have no idea how hard it was to stop myself. I wasn\u0027t lying, about what I had been thinking.\" I swallowed nosily at the look on his face, and remembered what he had crassly said to me. He watched my face intensely. \"Do you think less of me now?\"\\n\\n Stubbornly, I shook my head and he sighed and looked away. \"I\u0027m so sorry I yelled at you, Kiera.\" His eyes glistened as he faced me again, and I ran my hand back through his hair.\\n\\n Swallowing loudly, I found my voice again. \"I know you are sorry...I remember.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes, me sobbing like a baby...not my finest hour.\" He tried to look away again, but I brought my hand back to his cheek and made him look at me.\\n\\n \"I disagree. If you hadn\u0027t, if I hadn\u0027t seen that remorse, I probably would never have spoken to you again.\"\\n\\n He spoke very softly, \"It wasn\u0027t just remorse. True, I felt horrible for speaking to you like that...but mostly, I was sure that I had just completely severed the only loving relationship I\u0027ve ever had. I knew I\u0027d lost you. I knew you were completely Denny\u0027s then. I saw it in your eyes, and I knew I\u0027d never have a chance with you - none.\" A tear did finally escape his eye then, and I brushed it aside with my thumb. \"I never expected you to...comfort...me. No one\u0027s ever done that...ever. You don\u0027t know how much that meant to me.\"\\n\\n He swallowed roughly again, and again I thought to kiss him, but he pulled back a little and stared at me intently. \"I was so scared to be near you after that. I allowed myself one last goodbye with you in the kitchen, but I didn\u0027t want to touch you anymore.\" He scanned my eyes, like he was searching for forgiveness in them. \"I\u0027m sorry that I hurt you, but I needed to be distracted from you, to make sure I never took things so far again.\" He pulled my hand off his cheek and looked away, out over the city again. The lights sparkled in his still overly moist eyes. \"I\u0027m so sorry about all the women, Kiera. I never should have hurt you like that. I didn\u0027t want to...well, maybe a part of me did. I just-\"\\n\\n I interrupted him. \"You don\u0027t...you already apologized for that, Kellan.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" He looked back to me, another tear threatening to spill. \"I just really feel like I messed up. But, you didn\u0027t want me, in the same way that I wanted you...and I couldn\u0027t bring myself to leave you anymore. I did the only thing I knew, that I\u0027ve ever known, for blocking out the pain.\" He shook his head remorsefully, and the tear fell down his cheek. \"To feel...wanted,\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"Women,\" I stated, watching pain flash through his features.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" His face looked bleak and desolate, like he had just confessed to multiple murders, and not being a single guy who slept around with perfectly willing women.\\n\\n \"Lots and lots of women.\" I added a note of sarcasm, hoping to lighten his mood.\\n\\n \"Yeah...I\u0027m sorry.\" He did fractionally raise his lips in a smile.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay. Well, it\u0027s not okay, you still shouldn\u0027t use people...but, I think I understand.\"\\n\\n He looked up at me from under his eyebrows, an adorable expression of hope on his face. I couldn\u0027t resist anymore, I leaned up and kissed him for a moment.\\n\\n \"So...\" he asked, pulling away, all too soon.\\n\\n \"What?\" I asked, confused and mildly irritated. I wasn\u0027t done kissing him. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever be done kissing him.\\n\\n He half-smiled in a charming way. \"Was I right? Did you use me?\"\\n\\n \"Kellan...\" Guilt flashed through me, and I looked away.\\n\\n His smile left him and he very seriously said, \"It\u0027s okay if you did, Kiera. I just, I would like to know.\"\\n\\n I sighed. \"I have always felt...something for you, but...yes, the first time I did use you, and I\u0027m so sorry, that was incredibly wrong of me. If I\u0027d have known that you loved me, I never would have-\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay, Kiera.\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not,\" I whispered, and then softly added, \"The second time, I didn\u0027t. That had nothing to do with Denny. That was about us. That was real. Every touch after that, was real.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s surprisingly good to hear,\" he whispered, not looking at me, but smiling softly, and then suddenly he frowned. \"You should be with Denny...not me. He\u0027s a good man.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a good man too,\" I said, searching his perfect, but still frowning face.\\n\\n He shook his head lightly and I ran my fingers through his hair and sighed. \"Don\u0027t let our relationship, make you think that you\u0027re a bad person. You and I are...complicated.\"\\n\\n \"Complicated...\" He repeated, cupping my cheek and running his thumb along my cheekbone. \"I suppose we are.\" He dropped his hand. \"That\u0027s my fault-\"\\n\\n I cut him off with, \"Don\u0027t, Kellan. I\u0027m just as culpable as you. I\u0027ve made mistakes...\"\\n\\n \"But,\" he started to interrupt.\\n\\n \"No, we both messed this up, Kellan. It takes two to...you know. I wanted you just as badly as you wanted me. I needed you as much. I wanted to be near you just as much. I wanted to touch you as much. I care for you...\" I couldn\u0027t quite finish that thought, and I let it hang in the air between us, unfinished.\\n\\n Tears welled in his eyes again. \"I\u0027ve never been very clear with you. Maybe, if I had just told you that I loved you from the beginning? I\u0027m so sorry, Kiera. I hurt you, so many times. There\u0027s so much I wish I could take back. I-\"\\n\\n I stopped him with a deep kiss. I understood better now. It still hurt, but I could see just how badly I had hurt him as well. He did the only thing he knew how to do, to cope with his pain. Right or wrong, it was all he knew. He brought his hand to my cheek again and returned my kiss just as deeply, both of us forgetting for a moment, our emotional conversation. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thoughtless-thoughtless-1/page-61.html","bookId":1887,"book":{"id":1887,"title":"Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1)","description":"Storyline: Thoughtless (Thoughtless #1) \\n For almost two years now, Kiera\u0027s boyfriend, Denny, has been everything she\u0027s ever wanted: loving, tender and endlessly devoted to her.
