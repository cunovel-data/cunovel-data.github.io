When they head off to a new city to start their lives together, Denny at his dream job and Kiera at a top-notch university, everything seems perfect. Then an unforeseen obligation forces the happy couple apart. \n Feeling lonely, confused, and in need of comfort, Kiera turns to an unexpected sourceâ€”a local rock star named Kellan Kyle. At first, he\u0027s purely a friend that she can lean on, but as her loneliness grows, so does their relationship. And then one night everything changes...and none of them will ever be the same.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/thoughtless-thoughtless-1.jpg","author":"S.C.
