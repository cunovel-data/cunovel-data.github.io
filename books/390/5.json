{"id":12222,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 6 The Throwing Nets","content":"She walked quickly away from the river, because the embankment was wide and well lit. There was a tangle of narrow streets between there and the Royal Arctic Institute, which was the only place Lyra was sure of being able to find, and into that dark maze she hurried now.\n If only she knew London as well as she knew Oxford! Then she would have known which streets to avoid; or where she could scrounge some food; or, best of all, which doors to knock on and find shelter. In that cold night, the dark alleys all around were alive with movement and secret life, and she knew none of it.\n Pantalaimon became a wildcat and scanned the dark all around with his night-piercing eyes. Every so often he\u0027d stop, bristling, and she would turn aside from the entrance she\u0027d been about to go down. The night was full of noises: bursts of drunken laughter, two raucous voices raised in song, the clatter and whine of some badly oiled machine in a basement. Lyra walked delicately through it all, her senses magnified and mingled with Pantalaimon\u0027s, keeping to the shadows and the narrow alleys.\n From time to time she had to cross a wider, well-lit street, where the tramcars hummed and sparked under their anbaric wires. There were rules for crossing London streets, but she took no notice, and when anyone shouted, she fled.\n It was a fine thing to be free again. She knew that Pantalaimon, padding on wildcat paws beside her, felt the same joy as she did to be in the open air, even if it was murky London air laden with fumes and soot and clangorous with noise. Sometime soon they\u0027d have to think over the meaning of what they\u0027d heard in Mrs. Coulter\u0027s flat, but not yet. And sometime eventually they\u0027d have to find a place to sleep.\n At a crossroads near the corner of a big department store whose windows shone brilliantly over the wet pavement, there was a coffee stall: a little hut on wheels with a counter under the wooden flap that swung up like an awning. Yellow light glowed inside, and the fragrance of coffee drifted out. The white-coated owner was leaning on the counter talking to the two or three customers.\n It was tempting. Lyra had been walking for an hour now, and it was cold and damp. With Pantalaimon a sparrow, she went up to the counter and reached up to gain the owner\u0027s attention.\n \"Cup of coffee and a ham sandwich, please,\" she said.\n \"You\u0027re out late, my dear,\" said a gentleman in a top hat and white silk muffler.\n \"Yeah,\" she said, turning away from him to scan the busy intersection. A theater nearby was just emptying, and crowds milled around the lighted foyer, calling for cabs, wrapping coats around their shoulders. In the other direction was the entrance of a Chthonic Railway station, with more crowds pouring up and down the steps.\n \"Here you are, love,\" said the coffee stall man. \"Two shillings.\"\n \"Let me pay for this,\" said the man in the top hat.\n Lyra thought, why not? I can run faster than him, and I might need all my money later. The top-hatted man dropped a coin on the counter and smiled down at her. His daemon was a lemur. It clung to his lapel, staring round-eyed at Lyra.\n She bit into her sandwich and kept her eyes on the busy street. She had no idea where she was, because she had never seen a map of London, and she didn\u0027t even know how big it was or how far she\u0027d have to walk to find the country.\n \"What\u0027s your name?\" said the man.\n \"Alice.\"\n \"That\u0027s a pretty name. Let me put a drop of this into your coffee...warm you up...\"\n He was unscrewing the top of a silver flask.\n \"I don\u0027t like that,\" said Lyra. \"I just like coffee.\"\n \"I bet you\u0027ve never had brandy like this before.\"\n \"I have. I was sick all over the place. I had a whole bottle, or nearly.\"\n \"Just as you like,\" said the man, tilting the flask into his own cup. \"Where are you going, all alone like this?\"\n \"Going to meet my father.\"\n \"And who\u0027s he?\"\n \"He\u0027s a murderer.\"\n \"He\u0027s what?\"\n \"I told you, he\u0027s a murderer. It\u0027s his profession. He\u0027s doing a job tonight. I got his clean clothes in here, \u0027cause he\u0027s usually all covered in blood when he\u0027s finished a job.\"\n \"Ah! You\u0027re joking.\"\n \"I en\u0027t.\"\n The lemur uttered a soft mewing sound and clambered slowly up behind the man\u0027s head, to peer out at her. She drank her coffee stolidly and ate the last of her sandwich.\n \"Goodnight,\" she said. \"I can see my father coming now. He looks a bit angry.\"\n The top-hat man glanced around, and Lyra set off toward the theater crowd. Much as she would have liked to see the Chthonic Railway (Mrs. Coulter had said it was not really intended for people of their class), she was wary of being trapped underground; better to be out in the open, where she could run, if she had to.\n On and on she walked, and the streets became darker and emptier. It was drizzling, but even if there\u0027d been no clouds the city sky was too tainted with light to show the stars. Pantalaimon thought they were going north, but who could tell?\n Endless streets of little identical brick houses, with gardens only big enough for a dustbin; great gaunt factories behind wire fences, with one anbaric light glowing bleakly high up on a wall and a night watchman snoozing by his brazier; occasionally a dismal oratory, only distinguished from a warehouse by the crucifix outside. Once she tried the door of one of these places, only to hear a groan from the bench a foot away in the darkness. She realized that the porch was full of sleeping figures, and fled.\n \"Where we going to sleep, Pan?\" she said as they trudged down a street of closed and shuttered shops.\n \"A doorway somewhere.\"\n \"Don\u0027t want to be seen though. They\u0027re all so open.\"\n \"There\u0027s a canal down there....\"\n He was looking down a side road to the left. Sure enough, a patch of dark glimmer showed open water, and when they cautiously went to look, they found a canal basin where a dozen or so barges were tied up at the wharves, some high in the water, some low and laden under the gallows-like cranes. A dim light shone in one window of a wooden hut, and a thread of smoke rose from the metal chimney; otherwise the only lights were high up on the wall of the warehouse or the gantry of a crane, leaving the ground in gloom. The wharves were piled with barrels of coal spirit, with stacks of great round logs, with rolls of cauchuc-covered cable.\n Lyra tiptoed up to the hut and peeped in at the window. An old man was laboriously reading a picture\u0027Story paper and smoking a pipe, with his spaniel daemon curled up asleep on the table. As she looked, the man got up and brought a blackened kettle from the iron stove and poured some hot water into a cracked mug before settling back with his paper.\n \"Should we ask him to let us in, Pan?\" she whispered, but he was distracted; he was a bat, an owl, a wildcat again; she looked all round, catching his panic, and then saw them at the same time as he did: two men running at her, one from each side, the nearer holding a throwing net.\n Pantalaimon uttered a harsh scream and launched himself as a leopard at the closer man\u0027s daemon, a savage-looking fox, bowling her backward and tangling with the man\u0027s legs. The man cursed and dodged aside, and Lyra darted past him toward the open spaces of the wharf. What she mustn\u0027t do was get boxed in a corner.\n Pantalaimon, an eagle now, swooped at her and cried, \"Left! Left!\"\n She swerved that way and saw a gap between the coal-spirit barrels and the end of a corrugated iron shed, and darted for it like a bullet.\n But those throwing nets!\n She heard a hiss in the air, and past her cheek something lashed and sharply stung, and loathsome tarred strings whipped across her face, her arms, her hands, and tangled and held her, and she fell, snarling and tearing and struggling in vain.\n \"Pan! Pan!\"\n But the fox daemon tore at the cat Pantalaimon, and Lyra felt the pain in her own flesh, and sobbed a great cry as he fell. One man was swiftly lashing cords around her, around her limbs, her throat, body, head, bundling her over and over on the wet ground. She was helpless, exactly like a fly being trussed by a spider. Poor hurt Pan was dragging himself toward her, with the fox daemon worrying his back, and he had no strength left to change, even; and the other man was lying in a puddle, with an arrow through his neck-\n The whole world grew still as the man tying the net saw it too.\n Pantalaimon sat up and blinked, and then there was a soft thud, and the net man fell choking and gasping right across Lyra, who cried out in horror: that was blood gushing out of him!\n Running feet, and someone hauled the man away and bent over him; then other hands lifted Lyra, a knife snicked and pulled and the net strings fell away one by one, and she tore them off, spitting, and hurled herself down to cuddle Pantalaimon.\n Kneeling, she twisted to look up at the newcomers. Three dark men, one armed with a bow, the others with knives; and as she turned, the bowman caught his breath.\n \"That en\u0027t Lyra?\"\n A familiar voice, but she couldn\u0027t place it till he stepped forward and the nearest light fell on his face and the hawk daemon on his shoulder. Then she had it. A gyptian! A real Oxford gyptian!\n \"Tony Costa,\" he said. \"Remember? You used to play with my little brother Billy off the boats in Jericho, afore the Gobblers got him.\"\n \"Oh, God, Pan, we\u0027re safe!\" she sobbed, but then a thought rushed into her mind: it was the Costas\u0027 boat she\u0027d hijacked that day. Suppose he remembered?\n \"Better come along with us,\" he said. \"You alone?\"\n \"Yeah. I was running away....\"\n \"All right, don\u0027t talk now. Just keep quiet. Jaxer, move them bodies into the shadow. Kerim, look around.\"\n Lyra stood up shakily, holding the wildcat Pantalaimon to her breast. He was twisting to look at something, and she followed his gaze, understanding and suddenly curious too: what had happened to the dead men\u0027s daemons? They were fading, that was the answer; fading and drifting away like atoms of smoke, for all that they tried to cling to their men. Pantalaimon hid his eyes, and Lyra hurried blindly after Tony Costa.\n \"What are you doing here?\" she said.\n \"Quiet, gal. There\u0027s enough trouble awake without stirring more. We\u0027ll talk on the boat.\"\n He led her over a little wooden bridge into the heart of the canal basin. The other two men were padding silently after them. Tony turned along the waterfront and out onto a wooden jetty, from which he stepped on board a narrowboat and swung open the door to the cabin.\n \"Get in,\" he said. \"Quick now.\"\n Lyra did so, patting her bag (which she had never let go of, even in the net) to make sure the alethiometer was still there. In the long narrow cabin, by the light of a lantern on a hook, she saw a stout powerful woman with gray hair, sitting at a table with a paper. Lyra recognized her as Billy\u0027s mother.\n \"Who\u0027s this?\" the woman said. \"That\u0027s never Lyra?\"\n \"That\u0027s right. Ma, we got to move. We killed two men out in the basin. We thought they was Gobblers, but I reckon they were Turk traders. They\u0027d caught Lyra. Never mind talk-we\u0027ll do that on the move.\"\n \"Come here, child,\" said Ma Costa.\n Lyra obeyed, half happy, half apprehensive, for Ma Costa had hands like bludgeons, and now she was sure: it was their boat she had captured with Roger and the other collegers. But the boat mother set her hands on either side of Lyra\u0027s face, and her daemon, a hawk, bent gently to lick Pantalaimon\u0027s wildcat head. Then Ma Costa folded her great arms around Lyra and pressed her to her breast.\n \"I dunno what you\u0027re a doing here, but you look wore out. You can have Billy\u0027s crib, soon\u0027s I\u0027ve got a hot drink in you. Set you down there, child.\"\n It looked as if her piracy was forgiven, or at least forgotten. Lyra slid onto the cushioned bench behind a well-scrubbed pine table top as the low rumble of the gas engine shook the boat.\n \"Where we going?\" Lyra asked.\n Ma Costa was setting a saucepan of milk on the iron stove and riddling the grate to stir the fire up.\n \"Away from here. No talking now. We\u0027ll talk in the morning.\"\n And she said no more, handing Lyra a cup of milk when it was ready, swinging herself up on deck when the boat began to move, exchanging occasional whispers with the men. Lyra sipped the milk and lifted a corner of the blind to watch the dark wharves move past. A minute or two later she was sound asleep.\n \n She awoke in a narrow bed, with that comforting engine rumble deep below. She sat up, banged her head, cursed, felt around, and got up more carefully. A thin gray light showed her three other bunks, each empty and neatly made, one below hers and the other two across the tiny cabin. She swung over the side to find herself in her underclothes, and saw the dress and the wolfskin coat folded at the end of her bunk together with her shopping bag. The alethiometer was still there.\n She dressed quickly and went through the door at the end to find herself in the cabin with the stove, where it was warm.\n There was no one there. Through the windows she saw a gray swirl of fog on each side, with occasional dark shapes that might have been buildings or trees.\n Before she could go out on deck, the outer door opened and Ma Costa came down, swathed in an old tweed coat on which the damp had settled like a thousand tiny pearls.\n \"Sleep well?\" she said, reaching for a frying pan. \"Now sit down out the way and I\u0027ll make ye some breakfast. Don\u0027t stand about; there en\u0027t room.\"\n \"Where are we?\" said Lyra.\n \"On the Grand Junction Canal. You keep out of sight, child. I don\u0027t want to see you topside. There\u0027s trouble.\"\n She sliced a couple of rashers of bacon into the frying pan, and cracked an egg to go with them.\n \"What sort of trouble?\"\n \"Nothing we can\u0027t cope with, if you stay out the way.\"\n And she wouldn\u0027t say any more till Lyra had eaten. The boat slowed at one point, and something banged against the side, and she heard men\u0027s voices raised in anger; but then someone\u0027s joke made them laugh, and the voices drew away and the boat moved on.\n Presently Tony Costa swung down into the cabin. Like his mother, he was pearled with damp, and he shook his woollen hat over the stove to make the drops jump and spit.\n \"What we going to tell her, Ma?\"\n \"Ask first, tell after.\"\n He poured some coffee into a tin cup and sat down. He was a powerful, dark-faced man, and now that she could see him in daylight, Lyra saw a sad grimness in his expression.\n \"Right,\" he said. \"Now you tell us what you was doing in London, Lyra. We had you down as being took by the Gobblers.\"\n \"I was living with this lady, right...\"\n Lyra clumsily collected her story and shook it into order as if she were settling a pack of cards ready for dealing. She told them everything, except about the alethiometer.\n \"And then last night at this cocktail party I found out what they were really doing. Mrs. Coulter was one of the Gobblers herself, and she was going to use me to help her catch more kids. And what they do is-\"\n Ma Costa left the cabin and went out to the cockpit. Tony waited till the door was shut, and cut in:\n \"We know what they do. Least, we know part of it. We know they don\u0027t come back. Them kids is taken up north, far out the way, and they do experiments on \u0027em. At first we reckoned they tried out different diseases and medicines, but there\u0027d be no reason to start that all of a sudden two or three years back. Then we thought about the Tartars, maybe there\u0027s some secret deal they\u0027re making up Siberia way; because the Tartars want to move north just as much as the rest, for the coal spirit and the fire mines, and there\u0027s been rumors of war for even longer than the Gobblers been going. And we reckoned the Gobblers were buying off the Tartar chiefs by giving \u0027em kids, cause the Tartars eat \u0027em, don\u0027t they? They bake children and eat \"em.\"\n \"They never!\" said Lyra.\n \"They do. There\u0027s plenty of other things to be told, and all. You ever heard of the Nalkainens?\"\n Lyra said, \"No. Not even with Mrs. Coulter. What are they?\"\n \"That\u0027s a kind of ghost they have up there in those forests. Same size as a child, and they got no heads. They feel their way about at night and if you\u0027re a sleeping out in the forest they get ahold of you and won\u0027t nothing make \u0027em let go. Nalkainens, that\u0027s a northern word. And the Windsuckers, they\u0027re dangerous too. They drift about in the air. You come across clumps of \u0027em floated together sometimes, or caught snagged on a bramble. As soon as they touch you, all the strength goes out of you. You can\u0027t see \u0027em except as a kind of shimmer in the air. And the Breathless Ones...\"\n \"Who are they?\"\n \"Warriors half-killed. Being alive is one thing, and being dead\u0027s another, but being half-killed is worse than either. They just can\u0027t die, and living is altogether beyond \u0027em. They wander about forever. They\u0027re called the Breathless Ones because of what\u0027s been done to \u0027em.\"\n \"And what\u0027s that?\" said Lyra, wide-eyed.\n \"The North Tartars snap open their ribs and pull out their lungs. There\u0027s an art to it. They do it without killing \u0027em, but their lungs can\u0027t work anymore without their daemons pumping \u0027em by hand, so the result is they\u0027re halfway between breath and no breath, life and death, half-killed, you see. And their daemons got to pump and pump all day and night, or else perish with \u0027em. You come across a whole platoon of Breathless Ones in the forest sometimes, I\u0027ve heard. And then there\u0027s the panserbj0rne-you heard of them? That means armored bears. They\u0027re great white bears, and-\"\n \"Yes! I have heard of them! One of the men last night, he said that my uncle, Lord Asriel, he\u0027s being imprisoned in a fortress guarded by the armored bears.\"\n \"Is he, now? And what was he doing up there?\"\n \"Exploring. But the way the man was talking I don\u0027t think my uncle\u0027s on the same side as the Gobblers. I think they were glad he was in prison.\"\n \"Well, he won\u0027t get out if the armored bears are guarding him. They\u0027re like mercenaries, you know what I mean by that? They sell their strength to whoever pays. They got hands like men, and they learned the trick of working iron way back, meteoric iron mostly, and they make great sheets and plates of it to cover theirselves with. They been raiding the Skraelings for centuries. They\u0027re vicious killers, absolutely pitiless. But they keep their word. If you make a bargain with a panserbj0m, you can rely on it.\"\n Lyra considered these horrors with awe.\n \"Ma don\u0027t like to hear about the North,\" Tony said after a few moments, \"because of what might\u0027ve happened to Billy. We know they took him up north, see.\"\n \"How d\u0027you know that?\"\n \"We caught one of the Gobblers, and made him talk. That\u0027s how we know a little about what they\u0027re doing. Them two last night weren\u0027t Gobblers; they were too clumsy. If they\u0027d been Gobblers we\u0027d\u0027ve took \u0027em alive. See, the gyptian people, we been hit worse than most by these Gobblers, and we\u0027re a coming together to decide what to do about it. That\u0027s what we was doing in the basin last night, taking on stores, \u0027cause we\u0027re going to a big muster up in the fens, what we call a roping. And what I reckon is we\u0027re a going to send out a rescue party, when we heard what all the other gyptians know, when we put our knowledge together. That\u0027s what I\u0027d do, if I was John Faa.\"\n \"Who\u0027s John Faa?\"\n \"The king of the gyptians.\"\n \"And you\u0027re really going to rescue the kids? What about Roger?\"\n \"Who\u0027s Roger?\"\n \"The Jordan College kitchen boy. He was took same as Billy the day before I come away with Mrs. Coulter. I bet if I was took, he\u0027d come and rescue me. If you\u0027re going to rescue Billy, I want to come too and rescue Roger.\"\n And Uncle Asriel, she thought; but she didn\u0027t mention that.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/52/191.html","bookId":390,"book":{"id":390,"title":"The Golden Compass黄金罗盘","description":"简介： If Pullman\u0027s imagination dazzled in the Victorian thrillers that culminated with The Tin Princess, in this first volume of a fantasy trilogy it is nothing short of breathtaking.
