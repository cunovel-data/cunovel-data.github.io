{"id":12224,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 8 Frustration","content":"Lyra had to adjust to her new sense of her own story, and that couldn\u0027t be done in a day. To see Lord Asriel as her father was one thing, but to accept Mrs. Coulter as her mother was nowhere near so easy. A couple of months ago she would have rejoiced, of course, and she knew that too, and felt confused.\n But, being Lyra, she didn\u0027t fret about it for long, for there was the fen town to explore and many gyptian children to amaze. Before the three days were up she was an expert with a punt (in her eyes, at least) and she\u0027d gathered a gang of urchins about her with tales of her mighty father, so unjustly made captive.\n \"And then one evening the Turkish Ambassador was a guest at Jordan for dinner. And he was under orders from the Sultan hisself to kill my father, right, and he had a ring on his finger with a hollow stone full of poison. And when the wine come round he made as if to reach across my father\u0027s glass, and he sprinkled the poison in. It was done so quick that no one else saw him, but-\"\n \"What sort of poison?\" demanded a thin-faced girl.\n \"Poison out of a special Turkish serpent,\" Lyra invented, \"what they catch by playing a pipe to lure out and then they throw it a sponge soaked in honey and the serpent bites it and can\u0027t get his fangs free, and they catch it and milk the venom out of it. Anyway, my father seen what the Turk done, and he says, Gentlemen, I want to propose a toast of friendship between Jordan College and the College of Izmir, which was the college the Turkish Ambassador belonged to. And to show our willingness to be friends, he says, we\u0027ll swap glasses and drink each other\u0027s wine.\n \"And the Ambassador was in a fix then, \u0027cause he couldn\u0027t refuse to drink without giving deadly insult, and he couldn\u0027t drink it because he knew it was poisoned. He went pale and he fainted right away at the table. And when he come round they was all still sitting there, waiting and looking at him. And then he had to either drink the poison or own up.\"\n \"So what did he do?\"\n \"He drunk it. It took him five whole minutes to die, and he was in torment all the time.\"\n \"Did you see it happen?\"\n \"No, \u0027cause girls en\u0027t allowed at the High Table. But I seen his body afterwards when they laid him out. His skin was all withered like an old apple, and his eyes were starting from his head. In fact, they had to push \u0027em back in the sockets....\"\n And so on.\n Meanwhile, around the edges of the fen country, the police were knocking at doors, searching attics and outhouses, inspecting papers and interrogating everyone who claimed to have seen a blond little girl; and in Oxford the search was even fiercer. Jordan College was scoured from the dustiest boxroom to the darkest cellar, and so were Gabriel and St. Michael\u0027s, till the heads of all the colleges issued a joint protest asserting their ancient rights. The only notion Lyra had of the search for her was the incessant drone of the gas engines of airships crisscrossing the skies. They weren\u0027t visible, because the clouds were low and by statute airships had to keep a certain height above fen country, but who knew what cunning spy devices they might carry? Best to keep under cover when she heard them, or wear the oilskin sou\u0027wester over her bright distinctive hair.\n And she questioned Ma Costa about every detail of the story of her birth. She wove the details into a mental tapestry even clearer and sharper than the stories she made up, and lived over and over again the flight from the cottage, the concealment in the closet, the harsh-voiced challenge, the clash of swords-\n \"Swords? Great God, girl, you dreaming?\" Ma Costa said. \"Mr. Coulter had a gun, and Lord Asriel knocked it out his hand and struck him down with one blow. Then there was two shots. I wonder you don\u0027t remember; you ought to, little as you were. The first shot was Edward Coulter, who reached his gun and fired, and the second was Lord Asriel, who tore it out his grasp a second time and turned it on him. Shot him right between the eyes and dashed his brains out. Then he says cool as paint, \u0027Come out, Mrs. Costa, and bring the baby,\u0027 because you were setting up such a howl, you and that daemon both; and he took you up and dandled you and sat you on his shoulders, walking up and down in high good humor with the dead man at his feet, and called for wine and bade me swab the floor.\"\n By the end of the fourth repetition of the story Lyra was perfectly convinced she did remember it, and even volunteered details of the color of Mr. Coulter\u0027s coat and the cloaks and furs hanging in the closet. Ma Costa laughed.\n And whenever she was alone, Lyra took out the alethiome-ter and pored over it like a lover with a picture of the beloved. So each image had several meanings, did it? Why shouldn\u0027t she work them out? Wasn\u0027t she Lord Asriel\u0027s daughter?\n Remembering what Farder Coram had said, she tried to focus her mind on three symbols taken at random, and clicked the hands round to point at them, and found that if she held the alethiometer just so in her palms and gazed at it in a particular lazy way, as she thought of it, the long needle\n would begin to move more purposefully. Instead of its wayward divagations around the dial it swung smoothly from one picture to another. Sometimes it would pause at three, sometimes two, sometimes five or more, and although she understood nothing of it, she gained a deep calm enjoyment from it, unlike anything she\u0027d known. Pantalaimon would crouch over the dial, sometimes as a cat, sometimes as a mouse, swinging his head round after the needle; and once or twice the two of them shared a glimpse of meaning that felt as if a shaft of sunlight had struck through clouds to light up a majestic line of great hills in the distance-something far beyond, and never suspected. And Lyra thrilled at those times with the same deep thrill she\u0027d felt all her life on hearing the word North.\n So the three days passed, with much coming and going between the multitude of boats and the Zaal. And then came the evening of the second roping. The hall was more crowded than before, if that was possible. Lyra and the Costas got there in time to sit at the front, and as soon as the flickering lights showed that the place was crammed, John Faa and Farder Coram came out on the platform and sat behind the table. John Faa didn\u0027t have to make a sign for silence; he just put his great hands flat on the table and looked at the people below, and the hubbub died.\n \"Well,\" he said, \"you done what I asked. And better than I hoped. I\u0027m a going to call on the heads of the six families now to come up here and give over their gold and recount their promises. Nicholas Rokeby, you come first.\"\n A stout black-bearded man climbed onto the platform and laid a heavy leather bag on the table.\n \"That\u0027s our gold,\" he said. \"And we offer thirty-eight men.\"\n \"Thank you, Nicholas,\" said John Faa. Farder Coram was making a note. The first man stood at the back of the platform as John Faa called for the next, and the next, and each came up, laid a bag on the table, and announced the number of men he could muster. The Costas were part of the Stefanski family, and naturally Tony had been one of the first to volunteer. Lyra noticed his hawk daemon shifting from foot to foot and spreading her wings as the Stefanski money and the promise of twenty-three men were laid before John Faa.\n When the six family heads had all come up, Farder Coram showed his piece of paper to John Faa, who stood up to address the audience again.\n \"Friends, that\u0027s a muster of one hundred and seventy men. I thank you proudly. As for the gold, I make no doubt from the weight of it that you\u0027ve all dug deep in your coffers, and my warm thanks go out for that as well.\n \"What we\u0027re a going to do next is this. We\u0027re a going to charter a ship and sail north, and find them kids and set \u0027em free. From what we know, there might be some fighting to do. It won\u0027t be the first time, nor it won\u0027t be the last, but we never had to fight yet with people who kidnap children, and we shall have to be uncommon cunning. But we en\u0027t going to come back without our kids. Yes, Dirk Vries?\"\n A man stood up and said, \"Lord Faa, do you know why they captured them kids?\"\n \"We heard it\u0027s a theological matter. They\u0027re making an experiment, but what nature it is we don\u0027t know. To tell you all the truth, we don\u0027t even know whether any harm is a coming to \u0027em. But whatever it is, good or bad, they got no right to reach out by night and pluck little children out the hearts of their families. Yes, Raymond van Gerrit?\"\n The man who\u0027d spoken at the first meeting stood up and said, \"That child, Lord Faa, the one you spoke of as being sought, the one as is sitting in the front row now. I heard as all the folk living around the edge of the fens is having their\n houses turned upside down on her account. I heard there\u0027s a move in Parliament this very day to rescind our ancient privileges on account of this child. Yes, friends,\" he said, over the babble of shocked whispers, \"they\u0027re a going to pass a law doing away with our right to free movement in and out the fens. Now, Lord Faa, what we want to know is this: who is this child on account of which we might come to such a pass? She en\u0027t a gyptian child, not as I heard. How comes it that a landloper child can put us all in danger?\"\n Lyra looked up at John Faa\u0027s massive frame. Her heart was thumping so much she could hardly hear the first words of his reply.\n \"Now spell it out, Raymond, don\u0027t be shy,\" he said. \"You want us to give this child up to them she\u0027s a fleeing from, is that right?\"\n The man stood obstinately frowning, but said nothing.\n \"Well, perhaps you would, and perhaps you wouldn\u0027t,\" John Faa continued. \"But if any man or woman needs a reason for doing good, ponder on this. That little girl is the daughter of Lord Asriel, no less. For them as has forgotten, it were Lord Asriel who interceded with the Turk for the life of Sam Broekman. It were Lord Asriel who allowed gyptian boats free passage on the canals through his property. It were Lord Asriel who defeated the Watercourse Bill in Parliament, to our great and lasting benefit. And it were Lord Asriel who fought day and night in the floods of \u002753, and plunged headlong in the water twice to pull out young Ruud and Nellie Koopman. You forgotten that? Shame, shame on you, shame.\n \"And now that same Lord Asriel is held in the farthest coldest darkest regions of the wild, captive, in the fortress of Svalbard. Do I need to tell you the kind of creatures a guarding him there? And this is his little daughter in our care, and Raymond van Gerrit would hand her over to the authorities for a bit of peace and quiet. Is that right, Raymond? Stand up and answer, man.\"\n But Raymond van Gerrit had sunk to his seat, and nothing would make him stand. A low hiss of disapproval sounded through the great hall, and Lyra felt the shame he must be feeling, as well as a deep glow of pride in her brave father.\n John Faa turned away, and looked at the other men on the platform.\n \"Nicholas Rokeby, I\u0027m a putting you in charge of finding a vessel, and commanding her once we sail. Adam Stefanski, I want you to take charge of the arms and munitions, and command the fighting. Roger van Poppel, you look to all the other stores, from food to cold-weather clothing. Simon Hartmann, you be treasurer, and account to us all for a proper apportionment of our gold. Benjamin de Ruyter, I want you to take charge of spying. There\u0027s a great deal we ought to find out, and I\u0027m a giving you the charge of that, and you\u0027ll report to Farder Coram. Michael Canzona, you\u0027re going to be responsible for coordinating the first four leaders\u0027 work, and you\u0027ll report to me, and if I die, you\u0027re my second in command and you\u0027ll take over.\n \"Now I\u0027ve made my dispositions according to custom, and if any man or woman seeks to disagree, they may do so freely.\"\n After a moment a woman stood up.\n \"Lord Faa, en\u0027t you a taking any women on this expedition to look after them kids once you found \u0027em?\"\n \"No, Nell. We shall have little space as it is. Any kids we free will be better off in our care than where they\u0027ve been.\"\n \"But supposing you find out that you can\u0027t rescue \u0027em without some women in disguise as guards or nurses or whatever?\"\n \"Well, I hadn\u0027t thought of that,\" John Faa admitted. \"We\u0027ll consider that most carefully when we retire into the parley room, you have my promise.\"\n She sat down and a man stood up.\n \"Lord Faa, I heard you say that Lord Asriel is in captivity. Is it part of your plan to rescue him? Because if it is, and if he\u0027s in the power of them bears as I think you said, that\u0027s going to need more than a hundred and seventy men. And good friend as Lord Asriel is to us, I don\u0027t know as there\u0027s any call on us to go as far as that.\"\n \"Adriaan Braks, you\u0027re not wrong. What I had it in my mind to do was to keep our eyes and ears open and see what knowledge we can glean while we\u0027re in the North. It may be that we can do something to help him, and it may not, but you can trust me not to use what you\u0027ve provided, man and gold, for any purpose outside the stated one of finding our children and bringing \u0027em home.\"\n Another woman stood up.\n \"Lord Faa, we don\u0027t know what them Gobblers might\u0027ve been doing to our children. We all heard rumors and stories of fearful things. We hear about children with no heads, or about children cut in half and sewn together, or about things too awful to mention. I\u0027m truly sorry to distress anyone, but we all heard this kind of thing, and I want to get it out in the open. Now in case you find anything of that awful kind, Lord Faa, I hope you\u0027re a going to take powerful revenge. I hope you en\u0027t going to let thoughts of mercy and gentleness hold your hand back from striking and striking hard, and delivering a mighty blow to the heart of that infernal wickedness. And I\u0027m sure I speak for any mother as has lost a child to the Gobblers.\"\n There was a loud murmur of agreement as she sat down. Heads were nodding all over the Zaal.\n John Faa waited for silence, and said:\n \"Nothing will hold my hand, Margaret, save only judgment. If I stay my hand in the North, it will only be to strike the harder in the South. To strike a day too soon is as bad as striking a hundred miles off. To be sure, there\u0027s a warm passion behind what you say. But if you give in to that passion, friends, you\u0027re a doing what I always warned you agin: you\u0027re a placing the satisfaction of your own feelings above the work you have to do. Our work here is first rescue, then punishment. It en\u0027t gratification for upset feelings. Our feelings don\u0027t matter. If we rescue the kids but we can\u0027t punish the Gobblers, we\u0027ve done the main task. But if we aim to punish the Gobblers first and by doing so lose the chance of rescuing the kids, we\u0027ve failed.\n \"But be assured of this, Margaret. When the time comes to punish, we shall strike such a blow as\u0027ll make their hearts faint and fearful. We shall strike the strength out of \u0027em. We shall leave them ruined and wasted, broken and shattered, torn in a thousand pieces and scattered to the four winds. Don\u0027t you worry that John Faa\u0027s heart is too soft to strike a blow when the time comes. And the time will come under judgment. Not under passion.\n \"Is there anyone else who wants to speak? Speak if you will.\"\n But no one did, and presently John Faa reached for the closing bell and rang it hard and loud, swinging it high and shaking the peals out of it so that they filled the hall and rang the rafters.\n John Faa and the other men left the platform for the parley room. Lyra was a little disappointed. Didn\u0027t they want her there too? But Tony laughed.\n \"They got plans to make,\" he said. \"You done your part, Lyra. Now it\u0027s for John Faa and the council.\"\n \"But I en\u0027t done nothing yet!\" Lyra protested, as she followed the others reluctantly out of the hall and down the cobbled road toward the jetty. \"All I done was run away from Mrs. Coulter! That\u0027s just a beginning. I want to go north!\"\n \"Tell you what,\" said Tony, \"I\u0027ll bring you back a walrus tooth, that\u0027s what I\u0027ll do.\"\n Lyra scowled. For his part, Pantalaimon occupied himself by making monkey faces at Tony\u0027s daemon, who closed her tawny eyes in disdain. Lyra drifted to the jetty and hung about with her new companions, dangling lanterns on strings over the black water to attract the goggle-eyed fishes who swam slowly up to be lunged at with sharp sticks and missed.\n But her mind was on John Faa and the parley room, and before long she slipped away up the cobbles again to the Zaal. There was a light in the parley room window. It was too high to look through, but she could hear a low rumble of voices inside.\n So she walked up to the door and knocked on it firmly five times. The voices stopped, a chair scraped across the floor, and the door opened, spilling warm naphtha light out on the damp step.\n \"Yes?\" said the man who\u0027d opened it.\n Beyond him Lyra could see the other men around the table, with bags of gold stacked neatly, and papers and pens, and glasses and a crock of jenniver.\n \"I want to come north,\" Lyra said so they could all hear it. \"I want to come and help rescue the kids. That\u0027s what I set out to do when I run away from Mrs. Coulter. And before that, even, I meant to rescue my friend Roger the kitchen boy from Jordan who was took. I want to come and help. I can do navigation and I can take anbaromagnetic readings off the Aurora, and I know what parts of a bear you can eat, and all kind of useful things. You\u0027d be sorry if you got up there and then found you needed me and found you\u0027d left me behind. And like that woman said, you might need women to play a part-well, you might need kids too. You don\u0027t know. So you oughter take me, Lord Faa, excuse me for interrupting your talk.\"\n She was inside the room now, and all the men and their daemons were watching her, some with amusement and some with irritation, but she had eyes only for John Faa. Pantalaimon sat up in her arms, his wildcat eyes blazing green.\n John Faa said, \"Lyra, there en\u0027t no question of taking you into danger, so don\u0027t delude yourself, child. Stay here and help Ma Costa and keep safe. That\u0027s what you got to do.\"\n \"But I\u0027m learning how to read the alethiometer, too. It\u0027s coming clearer every day! You\u0027re bound to need that-bound to!\"\n He shook his head.\n \"No,\" he said. \"I know your heart was set on going north, but it\u0027s my belief not even Mrs. Coulter was going to take you. If you want to see the North, you\u0027ll have to wait till all this trouble\u0027s over. Now off you go.\"\n Pantalaimon hissed quietly, but John Faa\u0027s daemon took off from the back of his chair and flew at them with black wings, not threateningly, but like a reminder of good manners; and Lyra turned on her heel as the crow glided over her head and wheeled back to John Faa. The door shut behind her with a decisive click.\n \"We will go,\" she said to Pantalaimon. \"Let \u0027em try to stop us. We will!\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/52/193.html","bookId":390,"book":{"id":390,"title":"The Golden Compass黄金罗盘","description":"简介： If Pullman\u0027s imagination dazzled in the Victorian thrillers that culminated with The Tin Princess, in this first volume of a fantasy trilogy it is nothing short of breathtaking.
