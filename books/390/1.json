{"id":12218,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1 The Decanter Of Tokay","content":"Lyra and her daemon moved through the darkening hall, taking care to keep to one side, out of sight of the kitchen. The three great tables that ran the length of the hall were laid already, the silver and the glass catching what little light there was, and the long benches were pulled out ready for the guests. Portraits of former Masters hung high up in the gloom along the walls. Lyra reached the dais and looked back at the open kitchen door, and, seeing no one, stepped up beside the high table. The places here were laid with gold, not silver, and the fourteen seats were not oak benches but mahogany chairs with velvet cushions.\\n\\n Lyra stopped beside the Master\u0027s chair and flicked the biggest glass gently with a fingernail. The sound rang clearly through the hall.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not taking this seriously,\" whispered her daemon. \"Behave yourself.\"\\n\\n Her daemon\u0027s name was Pantalaimon, and he was currently in the form of a moth, a dark brown one so as not to show up in the darkness of the hall.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re making too much noise to hear from the kitchen,\" Lyra whispered back. \"And the Steward doesn\u0027t come in till the first bell. Stop fussing.\"\\n\\n But she put her palm over the ringing crystal anyway, and Pantalaimon fluttered ahead and through the slightly open door of the Retiring Room at the other end of the dais. After a moment he appeared again.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no one there,\" he whispered. \"But we must be quick.\"\\n\\n Crouching behind the high table, Lyra darted along and through the door into the Retiring Room, where she stood up and looked around. The only light in here came from the fireplace, where a bright blaze of logs settled slightly as she looked, sending a fountain of sparks up into the chimney. She had lived most of her life in the College, but had never seen the Retiring Room before: only Scholars and their guests were allowed in here, and never females. Even the maidservants didn\u0027t clean in here. That was the Butler\u0027s job alone.\\n\\n Pantalaimon settled on her shoulder.\\n\\n \"Happy now? Can we go?\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be silly! I want to look around!\"\\n\\n It was a large room, with an oval table of polished rosewood on which stood various decanters and glasses, and a silver smoking stand with a rack of pipes. On a sideboard nearby there was a little chafing dish and a basket of poppy heads.\\n\\n \"They do themselves well, don\u0027t they, Pan?\" she said under her breath.\\n\\n She sat in one of the green leather armchairs. It was so deep she found herself nearly lying down, but she sat up again and tucked her legs under her to look at the portraits on the walls. More old Scholars, probably; robed, bearded, and gloomy, they stared out of their frames in solemn disapproval.\\n\\n \"What d\u0027you think they talk about?\" Lyra said, or began to say, because before she\u0027d finished the question she heard voices outside the door.\\n\\n \"Behind the chair-quick!\" whispered Pantalaimon, and in a flash Lyra was out of the armchair and crouching behind it. It wasn\u0027t the best one for hiding behind: she\u0027d chosen one in the very center of the room, and unless she kept very quiet...\\n\\n The door opened, and the light changed in the room; one of the incomers was carrying a lamp, which he put down on the sideboard. Lyra could see his legs, in their dark green trousers and shiny black shoes. It was a servant.\\n\\n Then a deep voice said, \"Has Lord Asriel arrived yet?\"\\n\\n It was the Master. As Lyra held her breath, she saw the servant\u0027s daemon (a dog, like all servants\u0027 daemons) trot in and sit quietly at his feet, and then the Master\u0027s feet became visible too, in the shabby black shoes he always wore.\\n\\n \"No, Master,\" said the Butler. \"No word from the aerodock, either.\"\\n\\n \"I expect he\u0027ll be hungry when he arrives. Show him straight into Hall, will you?\"\\n\\n \"Very good, Master.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ve decanted some of the special Tokay for him?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Master. The 1898, as you ordered. His Lordship is very partial to that, I remember.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Now leave me, please.\"\\n\\n \"Do you need the lamp, Master?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, leave that too. Look in during dinner to trim it, will you?\"\\n\\n The Butler bowed slightly and turned to leave, his daemon trotting obediently after him. From her not-much-of-a-hiding place Lyra watched as the Master went to a large oak wardrobe in the corner of the room, took his gown from a hanger, and pulled it laboriously on. The Master had been a powerful man, but he was well over seventy now, and his movements were stiff and slow. The Master\u0027s daemon had the form of a raven, and as soon as his robe was on, she jumped down from the wardrobe and settled in her accustomed place on his right shoulder.\\n\\n Lyra could feel Pantalaimon bristling with anxiety, though he made no sound. For herself, she was pleasantly excited.\\n\\n The visitor mentioned by the Master, Lord Asriel, was her uncle, a man whom she admired and feared greatly. He was said to be involved in high politics, in secret exploration, in distant warfare, and she never knew when he was going to appear. He was fierce: if he caught her in here she\u0027d be severely punished, but she could put up with that.\\n\\n What she saw next, however, changed things completely.\\n\\n The Master took from his pocket a folded paper and laid it on the table beside the wine. He took the stopper out of the mouth of a decanter containing a rich golden wine, unfolded the paper, and poured a thin stream of white powder into the decanter before crumpling the paper and throwing it into the fire. Then he took a pencil from his pocket, stirred the wine until the powder had dissolved, and replaced the stopper.\\n\\n His daemon gave a soft brief squawk. The Master replied in an undertone, and looked around with his hooded, clouded eyes before leaving through the door he\u0027d come in by.\\n\\n Lyra whispered, \"Did you see that, Pan?\"\\n\\n \"Of course I did! Now hurry out, before the Steward comes!\"\\n\\n But as he spoke, there came the sound of a bell ringing once from the far end of the hall.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the Steward\u0027s bell!\" said Lyra. \"I thought we had more time than that.\"\\n\\n Pantalaimon fluttered swiftly to the hall door, and swiftly back.\\n\\n \"The Steward\u0027s there already,\" he said. \"And you can\u0027t get out of the other door...\"\\n\\n The other door, the one the Master had entered and left by, opened onto the busy corridor between the library and the Scholars\u0027 common room. At this time of day it was thronged with men pulling on their gowns for dinner, or hurrying to leave papers or briefcases in the common room before moving nto the hall. Lyra had planned to leave the way she\u0027d come, banking on another few minutes before the Steward\u0027s bell rang.\\n\\n And if she hadn\u0027t seen the Master tipping that powder into the wine, she might have risked the Steward\u0027s anger, or hoped to avoid being noticed in the busy corridor. But she was confused, and that made her hesitate.\\n\\n Then she heard heavy footsteps on the dais. The Steward was coming to make sure the Retiring Room was ready for the Scholars\u0027 poppy and wine after dinner. Lyra darted to the oak wardrobe, opened it, and hid inside, pulling the door shut just as the Steward entered. She had no fear for Pantalaimon: the room was somber colored, and he could always creep under a chair.\\n\\n She heard the Steward\u0027s heavy wheezing, and through the crack where the door hadn\u0027t quite shut she saw him adjust the pipes in the rack by the smoking stand and cast a glance over the decanters and glasses. Then he smoothed the hair over his ears with both palms and said something to his daemon. He was a servant, so she was a dog; but a superior servant, so a superior dog. In fact, she had the form of a red setter. The daemon seemed suspicious, and cast around as if she\u0027d sensed an intruder, but didn\u0027t make for the wardrobe, to Lyra\u0027s intense relief. Lyra was afraid of the Steward, who had twice beaten her.\\n\\n Lyra heard a tiny whisper; obviously Pantalaimon had squeezed in beside her.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to have to stay here now. Why don\u0027t you listen to me?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t reply until the Steward had left. It was his job to supervise the waiting at the high table; she could hear the Scholars coming into the hall, the murmur of voices, the shuffle of feet.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a good thing I didn\u0027t,\" she whispered back. \"We wouldn\u0027t have seen the Master put poison in the wine otherwise. Pan, that was the Tokay he asked the Butler about! They\u0027re going to kill Lord Asriel!\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know it\u0027s poison.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, of course it is. Don\u0027t you remember, he made the Butler leave the room before he did it? If it was innocent, it wouldn\u0027t have mattered the Butler seeing. And I know there\u0027s something going on-something political. The servants have been talking about it for days. Pan, we could prevent a murder!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never heard such nonsense,\" he said shortly. \"How do you think you\u0027re going to keep still for four hours in this poky wardrobe? Let me go and look in the corridor. I\u0027ll tell you when it\u0027s clear.\"\\n\\n He fluttered from her shoulder, and she saw his little shadow appear in the crack of light.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s no good, Pan, I\u0027m staying,\" she said. \"There\u0027s another robe or something here. I\u0027ll put that on the floor and make myself comfortable. I\u0027ve just got to see what they do.\"\\n\\n She had been crouching. She carefully stood up, feeling around for the clothes hangers in order not to make a noise, and found that the wardrobe was bigger than she\u0027d thought. There were several academic robes and hoods, some with fur around them, most faced with silk.\\n\\n \"I wonder if these are all the Master\u0027s?\" she whispered. \"When he gets honorary degrees from other places, perhaps they give him fancy robes and he keeps them here for dressing-up....Pan, do you really think it\u0027s not poison in that wine?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"I think it is, like you do. And I think it\u0027s none of our business. And I think it would be the silliest thing you\u0027ve ever done in a lifetime of silly things to interfere. It\u0027s nothing to do with us.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" Lyra said. \"I can\u0027t sit in here and watch them give him poison!\"\\n\\n \"Come somewhere else, then.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a coward, Pan.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly I am. May I ask what you intend to do? Are you going to leap out and snatch the glass from his trembling fingers? What did you have in mind?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t have anything in mind, and well you know it,\" she snapped quietly. \"But now I\u0027ve seen what the Master did, I haven\u0027t got any choice. You\u0027re supposed to know about conscience, aren\u0027t you? How can I just go and sit in the library or somewhere and twiddle my thumbs, knowing what\u0027s going to happen? I don\u0027t intend to do that, I promise you.\"\\n\\n \"This is what you wanted all the time,\" he said after a moment. \"You wanted to hide in here and watch. Why didn\u0027t I realize that before?\"\\n\\n \"All right, I do,\" she said. \"Everyone knows they get up to something secret. They have a ritual or something. And I just wanted to know what it was.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s none of your business! If they want to enjoy their little secrets you should just feel superior and let them get on with it. Hiding and spying is for silly children.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly what I knew you\u0027d say. Now stop nagging.\"\\n\\n The two of them sat in silence for a while, Lyra uncomfortable on the hard floor of the wardrobe and Pantalaimon self-righteously twitching his temporary antennae on one of the robes. Lyra felt a mixture of thoughts contending in her head, and she would have liked nothing better than to share them with her daemon, but she was proud too. Perhaps she should try to clear them up without his help.\\n\\n Her main thought was anxiety, and it wasn\u0027t for herself. She\u0027d been in trouble often enough to be used to it. This time she was anxious about Lord Asriel, and about what this all meant. It wasn\u0027t often that he visited the college, and the fact that this was a time of high political tension meant that he hadn\u0027t come simply to eat and drink and smoke with a few old friends. She knew that both Lord Asriel and the Master were members of the Cabinet Council, the Prime Minister\u0027s special advisory body, so it might have been something to do with that; but meetings of the Cabinet Council were held in the palace, not in the Retiring Room of Jordan College. Then there was the rumor that had been keeping the College servants whispering for days. It was said that the Tartars had invaded Muscovy, and were surging north to St. Petersburg, from where they would be able to dominate the Baltic Sea and eventually overcome the entire west of Europe. And Lord Asriel had been in the far North: when she\u0027d seen him last, he was preparing an expedition to Lapland...\\n\\n \"Pan,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Do you think there\u0027ll be a war?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet. Lord Asriel wouldn\u0027t be dining here if it was going to break out in the next week or so.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought. But later?\" \"Shh! Someone\u0027s coming.\"\\n\\n She sat up and put her eye to the crack of the door. It was the Butler, coming to trim the lamp as the Master had ordered him to. The common room and the library were lit by anbar-ic power, but the Scholars preferred the older, softer naphtha lamps in the Retiring Room. They wouldn\u0027t change that in the Master\u0027s lifetime.\\n\\n The Butler trimmed the wick, and put another log on the fire as well, and then listened carefully at the hall door before helping himself to a handful of leaf from the smoking stand. He had hardly replaced the lid when the handle of the other door turned, making him jump nervously. Lyra tried not to laugh. The Butler hastily stuffed the leaf into his pocket and turned to face the incomer.\\n\\n \"Lord Asriel!\" he said, and a shiver of cold surprise ran down Lyra\u0027s back. She couldn\u0027t see him from where she was, and she tried to smother the urge to move and look.\\n\\n \"Good evening, Wren,\" said Lord Asriel. Lyra always heard that harsh voice with a mixture of pleasure and apprehension. \"I arrived too late to dine. I\u0027ll wait in here.\"\\n\\n The Butler looked uncomfortable. Guests entered the Retiring Room at the Master\u0027s invitation only, and Lord Asriel knew that; but the Butler also saw Lord Asriel looking pointedly at the bulge in his pocket, and decided not to protest.\\n\\n \"Shall I let the Master know you\u0027ve arrived, my lord?\"\\n\\n \"No harm in that. You might bring me some coffee.\"\\n\\n \"Very good, my lord.\"\\n\\n The Butler bowed and hastened out, his daemon trotting submissively at his heels. Lyra\u0027s uncle moved across to the fire and stretched his arms high above his head, yawning like a lion. He was wearing traveling clothes. Lyra was reminded, as she always was when she saw him again, of how much he frightened her. There was no question now of creeping out unnoticed: she\u0027d have to sit tight and hope.\\n\\n Lord Asriel\u0027s daemon, a snow leopard, stood behind him.\\n\\n \"Are you going to show the projections in here?\" she said quietly.\\n\\n \"Yes. It\u0027ll create less fuss than moving to the lecture theater. They\u0027ll want to see the specimens too; I\u0027ll send for the Porter in a minute. This is a bad time, Stelmaria.\"\\n\\n \"You should rest.\"\\n\\n He stretched out in one of the armchairs, so that Lyra could no longer see his face.\\n\\n \"Yes, yes. I should also change my clothes. There\u0027s probably some ancient etiquette that allows them to fine me a dozen bottles for coming in here dressed improperly. I should sleep for three days. The fact remains that-\"\\n\\n There was a knock, and the Butler came in with a silver tray bearing a coffeepot and a cup. \\n\\n \"Thank you, Wren,\" said Lord Asriel. \"Is that the Tokay I can see on the table?\"\\n\\n \"The Master ordered it decanted especially for you, my I lord,\" said the Butler. \"There are only three dozen bottles left I of the\u002798.\"\\n\\n \"All good things pass away. Leave the tray here beside me. Oh, ask the Porter to send up the two cases I left in the Lodge, would you?\"\\n\\n \"Here, my lord?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, here, man. And I shall need a screen and a projecting lantern, also here, also now.\"\\n\\n The Butler could hardly prevent himself from opening his mouth in surprise, but managed to suppress the question, or the protest.\\n\\n \"Wren, you\u0027re forgetting your place,\" said Lord Asriel. \"Don\u0027t question me; just do as I tell you.\"\\n\\n \"Very good, my lord,\" said the Butler. \"If I may suggest it, I should perhaps let Mr. Cawson know what you\u0027re planning, my lord, or else he\u0027ll be somewhat taken aback, if you see what I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Tell him, then.\"\\n\\n Mr. Cawson was the Steward. There was an old and well-established rivalry between him and the Butler. The Steward was the superior, but the Butler had more opportunities to ingratiate himself with the Scholars, and made full use of them. He would be delighted to have this chance of showing the Steward that he knew more about what was going on in the Retiring Room.\\n\\n He bowed and left. Lyra watched as her uncle poured a cup of coffee, drained it at once, and poured another before sipping more slowly. She was agog: cases of specimens? A projecting lantern? What did he have to show the Scholars that was so urgent and important?\\n\\n Then Lord Asriel stood up and turned away from the fire. She saw him fully, and marveled at the contrast he made with the plump Butler, the stooped and languid Scholars. Lord Asriel was a tall man with powerful shoulders, a fierce dark face, and eyes that seemed to flash and glitter with savage laughter. It was a face to be dominated by, or to fight: never a face to patronize or pity. All his movements were large and perfectly balanced, like those of a wild animal, and when he appeared in a room like this, he seemed a wild animal held in a cage too small for it.\\n\\n At the moment his expression was distant and preoccupied. His daemon came close and leaned her head on his waist, and he looked down at her unfathomably before turning away and walking to the table. Lyra suddenly felt her stomach lurch, for Lord Asriel had taken the stopper from the decanter of Tokay, and was pouring a glass.\\n\\n \"No!\"\\n\\n The quiet cry came before she could hold it back. Lord Asriel heard and turned at once.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s there?\"\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t help herself. She tumbled out of the wardrobe and scrambled up to snatch the glass from his hand. The wine flew out, splashing on the edge of the table and the carpet, and then the glass fell and smashed. He seized her wrist and twisted hard.\\n\\n \"Lyra! What the hell are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"Let go of me and I\u0027ll tell you!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll break your arm first. How dare you come in here?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve just saved your life!\"\\n\\n They were still for a moment, the girl twisted in pain but grimacing to prevent herself from crying out louder, the man bent over her frowning like thunder.\\n\\n \"What did you say?\" he said more quietly.\\n\\n \"That wine is poisoned,\" she muttered between clenched teeth. \"I saw the Master put some powder in it.\"\\n\\n He let go. She sank to the floor, and Pantalaimon fluttered anxiously to her shoulder. Her uncle looked down with a restrained fury, and she didn\u0027t dare meet his eyes.\\n\\n \"I came in just to see what the room was like,\" she said. \"I know I shouldn\u0027t have. But I was going to go out before anyone came in, except that I heard the Master coming and got ^ trapped. The wardrobe was the only place to hide. And I saw him put the powder in the wine. If I hadn\u0027t...\" \\n\\n There was a knock on the door.\\n\\n \"That\u0027ll be the Porter,\" said Lord Asriel. \"Back in the wardrobe. If I hear the slightest noise, I\u0027ll make you wish you were dead.\"\\n\\n She darted back there at once, and no sooner had she pulled the door shut than Lord Asriel called, \"Come in.\"\\n\\n As he\u0027d said, it was the Porter.\\n\\n \"In here, my lord?\"\\n\\n Lyra saw the old man standing doubtfully in the doorway, and behind him, the corner of a large wooden box.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, Shuter,\" said Lord Asriel. \"Bring them both in and put them down by the table.\"\\n\\n Lyra relaxed a little, and allowed herself to feel the pain in her shoulder and wrist. It might have been enough to make her cry, if she was the sort of girl who cried. Instead she gritted her teeth and moved the arm gently until it felt looser.\\n\\n Then came a crash of glass and the glug of spilled liquid.\\n\\n \"Damn you, Shuter, you careless old fool! Look what you\u0027ve done!\"\\n\\n Lyra could see, just. Her uncle had managed to knock the\\n\\n decanter of Tokay off the table, and made it look as if the Porter had done it. The old man put the box down carefully and began to apologize.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m truly sorry, my lord-I must have been closer than I thought-\"\\n\\n \"Get something to clear this mess up. Go on, before it soaks into the carpet!\"\\n\\n The Porter hurried out. Lord Asriel moved closer to the wardrobe and spoke in an undertone.\\n\\n \"Since you\u0027re in there, you can make yourself useful. Watch the Master closely when he comes in. If you tell me something interesting about him, I\u0027ll keep you from getting further into the trouble you\u0027re already in. Understand?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Uncle.\"\\n\\n \"Make a noise in there and I won\u0027t help you. You\u0027re on your own.\"\\n\\n He moved away and stood with his back to the fire again as the Porter came back with a brush and dustpan for the glass and a bowl and cloth.\\n\\n \"I can only say once again, my lord, I do most earnestly beg your pardon; I don\u0027t know what-\"\\n\\n \"Just clear up the mess.\"\\n\\n As the Porter began to mop the wine from the carpet, the Butler knocked and came in with Lord Asriel\u0027s manservant, a man called Thorold. They were carrying between them a heavy case of polished wood with brass handles. They saw what the Porter was doing and stopped dead.\\n\\n \"Yes, it was the Tokay,\" said Lord Asriel. \"Too bad. Is that the lantern? Set it up by the wardrobe, Thorold, if you would. I\u0027ll have the screen up at the other end.\"\\n\\n Lyra realized that she would be able to see the screen and whatever was on it through the crack in the door, and wondered whether her uncle had arranged it like that for the purpose. Under the noise the manservant made unrolling the stiff linen and setting it up on its frame, she whispered:\\n\\n \"See? It was worth coming, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"It might be,\" Pantalaimon said austerely, in his tiny moth voice. \"And it might not.\"\\n\\n Lord Asriel stood by the fire sipping the last of the coffee and watching darkly as Thorold opened the case of the projecting lantern and uncapped the lens before checking the oil tank.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s plenty of oil, my lord,\" he said. \"Shall I send for a technician to operate it?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027ll do it myself. Thank you, Thorold. Have they finished dinner yet, Wren?\"\\n\\n \"Very nearly, I think, my lord,\" replied the Butler. \"If I understand Mr. Cawson aright, the Master and his guests won\u0027t be disposed to linger once they know you\u0027re here. Shall I take the coffee tray?\"\\n\\n \"Take it and go.\"\\n\\n \"Very good, my lord.\"\\n\\n With a slight bow, the Butler took the tray and left, and Thorold went with him. As soon as the door closed, Lord Asriel looked across the room directly at the wardrobe, and Lyra felt the force of his glance almost as if it had physical form, as if it were an arrow or a spear. Then he looked away and spoke softly to his dasmon.\\n\\n She came to sit calmly at his side, alert and elegant and dangerous, her tawny eyes surveying the room before turning, like his black ones, to the door from the hall as the handle turned. Lyra couldn\u0027t see the door, but she heard an intake of breath as the first man came in.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/52/187.html","bookId":390,"book":{"id":390,"title":"The Golden Compass黄金罗盘","description":"简介： If Pullman\u0027s imagination dazzled in the Victorian thrillers that culminated with The Tin Princess, in this first volume of a fantasy trilogy it is nothing short of breathtaking.
