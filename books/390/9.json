{"id":12226,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 10 The Consul And The Bear","content":"John Faa and the other leaders had decided that they would make for Trollesund, the main port of Lapland. The witches had a consulate in the town, and John Faa knew that without their help, or at least their friendly neutrality, it would be impossible to rescue the captive children.\n He explained his idea to Lyra and Farder Coram the next day, when Lyra\u0027s seasickness had abated slightly. The sun was shining brightly and the green waves were dashing against the bows, bearing white streams of foam as they curved away. Out on the deck, with the breeze blowing and the whole sea a-sparkle with light and movement, she felt little sickness at all; and now that Pantalaimon had discovered the delights of being a seagull and then a stormy petrel and skimming the wave tops, Lyra was too absorbed by his glee to wallow in landlubberly misery.\n John Faa, Farder Coram, and two or three others sat in the stern of the ship, with the sun full on them, talking about what to do next.\n \"Now, Farder Coram knows these Lapland witches,\" John Faa said. \"And if I en\u0027t mistaken, there\u0027s an obligation there.\"\n \"That\u0027s right, John,\" said Farder Coram. \"It were forty years back, but that\u0027s nothing to a witch. Some of \u0027em live to many times that.\"\n \"What happened to bring this obligation about, Farder Coram?\" said Adam Stefanski, the man in charge of the fighting troop.\n \"I saved a witch\u0027s life,\" Farder Coram explained. \"She fell out of the air, being pursued by a great red bird like to nothing I\u0027d seen before. She fell injured in the marsh and I set out to find her. She was like to drowning, and I got her on board and shot that bird down, and it fell into a bog, to my regret, for it was as big as a bittern, and flame-red.\"\n \"Ah,\" the other men murmured, captured by Farder Coram\u0027s story.\n \"Now, when I got her in the boat,\" he went on, \"I had the most grim shock I\u0027d ever known, because that young woman had no daemon.\"\n It was as if he\u0027d said, \"She had no head.\" The very thought was repugnant. The men shuddered, their daemons bristled or shook themselves or cawed harshly, and the men soothed them. Pantalaimon crept into Lyra\u0027s arms, their hearts beating together.\n \"At least,\" Farder Coram said, \"that\u0027s what it seemed. Being as she\u0027d fell out of the air, I more than suspected she was a witch. She looked exactly like a young woman, thinner than some and prettier than most, but not seeing that daemon gave me a hideous turn.\"\n \"En\u0027t they got daemons then, the witches?\" said the other man, Michael Canzona.\n \"Their daemons is invisible, I expect,\" said Adam Stefanski. \"He was there all the time, and Farder Coram never saw him.\"\n \"No, you\u0027re wrong, Adam,\" said Farder Coram. \"He weren\u0027t there at all. The witches have the power to separate their-selves from their daemons a mighty sight further\u0027n what we can. If need be, they can send their daemons far abroad on the wind or the clouds, or down below the ocean. And this witch I found, she hadn\u0027t been resting above an hour when her daemon came a flying back, because he\u0027d felt her fear and her injury, of course. And it\u0027s my belief, though she never admitted to this, that the great red bird I shot was another witch\u0027s daemon, in pursuit. Lord! That made me shiver, when I thought of that. I\u0027d have stayed my hand; I\u0027d have taken any measures on sea or land; but there it was. Anyway, there was no doubt I\u0027d saved her life, and she gave me a token of it, and said I was to call on her help if ever it was needed. And once she sent me help when the Skraelings shot me with a poison arrow. We had other connections, too....I haven\u0027t seen her from that day to this, but she\u0027ll remember.\"\n \"And does she live at Trollesund, this witch?\"\n \"No, no. They live in forests and on the tundra, not in a seaport among men and women. Their business is with the wild. But they keep a consul there, and I shall get word to her, make no doubt about that.\"\n Lyra was keen to know more about the witches, but the men had turned their talk to the matter of fuel and stores, and presently she grew impatient to see the rest of the ship. She wandered along the deck toward the bows, and soon made the acquaintance of an able seaman by flicking at him the pips she\u0027d saved from the apple she\u0027d eaten at breakfast. He was a stout and placid man, and when he\u0027d sworn at her and been sworn at in return, they became great friends. He was called Jerry. Under his guidance she found out that having something to do prevented you from feeling seasick, and that even a job like scrubbing a deck could be satisfying, if it was done in a seamanlike way. She was very taken with this notion, and later on she folded the blankets on her bunk in a seamanlike way, and put her possessions in the closet in a seamanlike way, and used \"stow\" instead of \"tidy\" for the process of doing so.\n After two days at sea, Lyra decided that this was the life for her. She had the run of the ship, from the engine room to the bridge, and she was soon on first-name terms with all the crew. Captain Rokeby let her signal to a Hollands frigate by pulling the handle of the steam whistle; the cook suffered her help in mixing plum duff; and only a stern word from John Faa prevented her from climbing the foremast to inspect the horizon from the crow\u0027s nest.\n All the time they were steaming north, and it grew colder daily. The ship\u0027s stores were searched for oilskins that could be cut down for her, and Jerry showed her how to sew, an art she learned willingly from him, though she had scorned it at Jordan and avoided instruction from Mrs. Lonsdale. Together they made a waterproof bag for the alethiometer that she could wear around her waist, in case she fell in the sea, she said. With it safely in place she clung to the rail in her oilskins and sou\u0027wester as the stinging spray broke over the bows and surged along the deck. She still felt seasick occasionally, especially when the wind got up and the ship plunged heavily over the crests of the gray-green waves, and then it was Pantalaimon\u0027s job to distract her from it by skimming the waves as a stormy petrel; because she could feel his boundless glee in the dash of wind and water, and forget her nausea. From time to time he even tried being a fish, and once joined a school of dolphins, to their surprise and pleasure. Lyra stood shivering in the fo\u0027c\u0027sle and laughed with delight as her beloved Pantalaimon, sleek and powerful, leaped from the water with half a dozen other swift gray shapes. He had to stay close to the ship, of course, for he could never go far from her; but she sensed his desire to speed as far and as fast as he could, for pure exhilaration. She shared his pleasure, but for her it wasn\u0027t simple pleasure, for there was pain and fear in it too. Suppose he loved being a dolphin more than he loved being with her on land? What would she do then?\n Her friend the able seaman was nearby, and he paused as he adjusted the canvas cover of the forward hatch to look out at the little girl\u0027s daemon skimming and leaping with the dolphins. His own daemon, a seagull, had her head tucked under her wing on the capstan. He knew what Lyra was feeling.\n \"I remember when I first went to sea, my Belisaria hadn\u0027t settled on one form, I was that young, and she loved being a porpoise. I was afraid she\u0027d settle like that. There was one old sailorman on my first vessel who could never go ashore at all, because his daemon had settled as a dolphin, and he could never leave the water. He was a wonderful sailor, best navigator you ever knew; could have made a fortune at the fishing, but he wasn\u0027t happy at it. He was never quite happy till he died and he could be buried at sea.\"\n \"Why do daemons have to settle?\" Lyra said. \"I want Pantalaimon to be able to change forever. So does he.\"\n \"Ah, they always have settled, and they always will. That\u0027s part of growing up. There\u0027ll come a time when you\u0027ll be tired of his changing about, and you\u0027ll want a settled kind of form for him.\"\n \"I never will!\"\n \"Oh, you will. You\u0027ll want to grow up like all the other girls. Anyway, there\u0027s compensations for a settled form.\"\n \"What are they?\"\n \"Knowing what kind of person you are. Take old Belisaria. She\u0027s a seagull, and that means I\u0027m a kind of seagull too. I\u0027m not grand and splendid nor beautiful, but I\u0027m a tough old thing and I can survive anywhere and always find a bit of food and company. That\u0027s worth knowing, that is. And when your daemon settles, you\u0027ll know the sort of person you are.\"\n \"But suppose your daemon settles in a shape you don\u0027t like?\"\n \"Well, then, you\u0027re discontented, en\u0027t you? There\u0027s plenty of folk as\u0027d like to have a lion as a daemon and they end up with a poodle. And till they learn to be satisfied with what they are, they\u0027re going to be fretful about it. Waste of feeling, that is.\"\n But it didn\u0027t seem to Lyra that she would ever grow up.\n \n One morning there was a different smell in the air, and the ship was moving oddly, with a brisker rocking from side to side instead of the plunging and soaring. Lyra was on deck a minute after she woke up, gazing greedily at the land: such a strange sight, after all that water, for though they had only been at sea a few days, Lyra felt as if they\u0027d been on the ocean for months. Directly ahead of the ship a mountain rose, green flanked and snow-capped, and a little town and harbor lay below it: wooden houses with steep roofs, an oratory spire, cranes in the harbor, and clouds of gulls wheeling and crying. The smell was of fish, but mixed with it came land smells too: pine resin and earth and something animal and musky, and something else that was cold and blank and wild: it might have been snow. It was the smell of the North.\n Seals frisked around the ship, showing their clown faces above the water before sinking back without a splash. The wind that lifted spray off the white-capped waves was monstrously cold, and searched out every gap in Lyra\u0027s wolfskin, and her hands were soon aching and her face numb. Pantalaimon, in his ermine shape, warmed her neck for her, but it was too cold to stay outside for long without work to do, even to watch the seals, and Lyra went below to eat her breakfast porridge and look through the porthole in the saloon.\n Inside the harbor the water was calm, and as they moved past the massive breakwater Lyra began to feel unsteady from the lack of motion. She and Pantalaimon avidly watched as the ship inched ponderously toward the quayside. During the next hour the sound of the engine died away to a quiet background rumble, voices shouted orders or queries, ropes were thrown, gangways lowered, hatches opened.\n \"Come on, Lyra,\" said Farder Coram. \"Is everything packed?\"\n Lyra\u0027s possessions, such as they were, had been packed ever since she\u0027d woken up and seen the land. All she had to do was run to the cabin and pick up the shopping bag, and she was ready.\n The first thing she and Farder Coram did ashore was to visit the house of the witch consul. It didn\u0027t take long to find it; the little town was clustered around the harbor, with the oratory and the governor\u0027s house the only buildings of any size. The witch consul lived in a green-painted wooden house within sight of the sea, and when they rang the bell it jangled loudly in the quiet street.\n A servant showed them into a little parlor and brought them coffee. Presently the consul himself came in to greet them. He was a fat man with a florid face and a sober black suit, whose name was Martin Lanselius. His dsmon was a little serpent, the same intense and brilliant green as his eyes, which were the only witchlike thing about him, though Lyra was not sure what she had been expecting a witch to look like.\n \"How can I help you, Farder Coram?\" he said.\n \"In two ways, Dr. Lanselius. First, I\u0027m anxious to get in touch with a witch lady I met some years ago, in the fen country of Eastern Anglia. Her name is Serafina Pekkala.\"\n Dr. Lanselius made a note with a silver pencil.\n \"How long ago was your meeting with her?\" he said.\n \"Must be forty years. But I think she would remember.\"\n \"And what is the second way in which you seek my help?\"\n \"I\u0027m representing a number of gyptian families who\u0027ve lost children. We\u0027ve got reason to believe there\u0027s an organization capturing these children, ours and others, and bringing them to the North for some unknown purpose. I\u0027d like to know whether you or your people have heard of anything like this a going on.\"\n Dr. Lanselius sipped his coffee blandly.\n \"It\u0027s not impossible that notice of some such activity might have come our way,\" he said. \"You realize, the relations between my people and the Northlanders are perfectly cordial. It would be difficult for me to justify disturbing them.\"\n Farder Coram nodded as if he understood very well.\n \"To be sure,\" he said. \"And it wouldn\u0027t be necessary for me to ask you if I could get the information any other way. That was why I asked about the witch lady first.\"\n Now Dr. Lanselius nodded as if he understood. Lyra watched this game with puzzlement and respect. There were all kinds of things going on beneath it, and she saw that the witch consul was coming to a decision.\n \"Very well,\" he said. \"Of course, that\u0027s true, and you\u0027ll realize that your name is not unknown to us, Farder Coram. Serafina Pekkala is queen of a witch clan in the region of Lake Enara. As for your other question, it is of course understood that this information is not reaching you through me.\"\n \"Quite so.\"\n \"Well, in this very town there is a branch of an organization called the Northern Progress Exploration Company, which pretends to be searching for minerals, but which is really controlled by something called the General Oblation Board of London. This organization, I happen to know, imports children. This is not generally known in the town; the Norroway government is not officially aware of it. The children don\u0027t remain here long. They are taken some distance inland.\"\n \"Do you know where, Dr. Lanselius?\"\n \"No. I would tell you if I did.\"\n \"And do you know what happens to them there?\"\n For the first time, Dr. Lanselius glanced at Lyra. She looked stolidly back. The little green serpent daemon raised her head from the consul\u0027s collar and whispered tongue-flickeringly in his ear.\n The consul said, \"I have heard the phrase the M.aystadt process in connection with this matter. I think they use that in order to avoid calling what they do by its proper name. I have also heard the word intercision, but what it refers to I could not say.\"\n \"And are there any children in the town at the moment?\" said Farder Coram.\n He was stroking his daemon\u0027s fur as she sat alert in his lap. Lyra noticed that she had stopped purring.\n \"No, I think not,\" said Dr. Lanselius. \"A group of about twelve arrived a week ago and moved out the day before yesterday.\"\n \"Ah! As recent as that? Then that gives us a bit of hope. How did they travel, Dr. Lanselius?\"\n \"By sledge.\"\n \"And you have no idea where they went?\"\n \"Very little. It is not a subject we are interested in.\"\n \"Quite so. Now, you\u0027ve answered all my questions very fairly, sir, and here\u0027s just one more. If you were me, what question would you ask of the Consul of the Witches?\"\n For the first time Dr. Lanselius smiled.\n \"I would ask where I could obtain the services of an armored bear,\" he said.\n Lyra sat up, and felt Pantalaimon\u0027s heart leap in her hands.\n \"I understood the armored bears to be in the service of the Oblation Board,\" said Farder Coram in surprise. \"I mean, the Northern Progress Company, or whatever they\u0027re calling themselves.\"\n \"There is at least one who is not. You will find him at the sledge depot at the end of Langlokur Street. He earns a living there at the moment, but such is his temper and the fear he engenders in the dogs, his employment might not last for long.\"\n \"Is he a renegade, then?\"\n \"It seems so. His name is lorek Byrnison. You asked what I would ask, and I told you. Now here is what I would do: I would seize the chance to employ an armored bear, even if it were far more remote than this.\"\n Lyra could hardly sit still. Farder Coram, however, knew the etiquette for meetings such as this, and took another spiced honey cake from the plate. While he ate it, Dr. Lanselius turned to Lyra.\n \"I understand that you are in possession of an alethiome-ter,\" he said, to her great surprise; for how could he have known that?\n \"Yes,\" she said, and then, prompted by a nip from Pantalaimon, added, \"Would you like to look at it?\"\n \"I should like that very much.\"\n She fished inelegantly in the oilskin pouch and handed him the velvet package. He unfolded it and held it up with great care, gazing at the face like a Scholar gazing at a rare manuscript.\n \"How exquisite!\" he said. \"I have seen one other example, but it was not so fine as this. And do you possess the books of readings?\"\n \"No,\" Lyra began, but before she could say any more, Farder Coram was speaking.\n \"No, the great pity is that although Lyra possesses the alethiometer itself, there\u0027s no means of reading it whatsoever,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just as much of a mystery as the pools of ink the Hindus use for reading the future. And the nearest book of readings I know of is in the Abbey of St. Johann at Heidelberg.\"\n Lyra could see why he was saying this: he didn\u0027t want Dr. Lanselius to know of Lyra\u0027s power. But she could also see something Farder Coram couldn\u0027t, which was the agitation of Dr. Lanselius\u0027s daemon, and she knew at once that it was no good to pretend.\n So she said, \"Actually, I can read it,\" speaking half to Dr. Lanselius and half to Farder Coram, and it was the consul who responded.\n \"That is wise of you,\" he said. \"Where did you obtain this one?\"\n \"The Master of Jordan College in Oxford gave it to me,\" she said. \"Dr. Lanselius, do you know who made them?\"\n \"They are said to originate in the city of Prague,\" said the consul. \"The Scholar who invented the first alethiometer was apparently trying to discover a way of measuring the influences of the planets, according to the ideas of astrology. He intended to make a device that would respond to the idea of Mars or Venus as a compass responds to the idea of North. In that he failed, but the mechanism he invented was clearly responding to something, even if no one knew what it was.\"\n \"And where did they get the symbols from?\"\n \"Oh, this was in the seventeenth century. Symbols and emblems were everywhere. Buildings and pictures were designed to be read like books. Everything stood for something else; if you had the right dictionary, you could read Nature itself. It was hardly surprising to find philosophers using the symbolism of their time to interpret knowledge that came from a mysterious source. But, you know, they haven\u0027t been used seriously for two centuries or so.\"\n He handed the instrument back to Lyra, and added:\n \"May I ask a question? Without the books of symbols, how do you read it?\"\n \"I just make my mind go clear and then it\u0027s sort of like looking down into water. You got to let your eyes find the right level, because that\u0027s the only one that\u0027s in focus. Something like that,\" she said.\n \"I wonder if I might ask to see you do it?\" he said.\n Lyra looked at Farder Coram, wanting to say yes but waiting for his approval. The old man nodded.\n \"What shall I ask?\" said Lyra.\n \"What are the intentions of the Tartars with regard to Kamchatka?\"\n That wasn\u0027t hard. Lyra turned the hands to the camel, which meant Asia, which meant Tartars; to the cornucopia, for Kamchatka, where there were gold mines; and to the ant, which meant activity, which meant purpose and intention. Then she sat still, letting her mind hold the three levels of meaning together in focus, and relaxed for the answer, which came almost at once. The long needle trembled on the dolphin, the helmet, the baby, and the anchor, dancing between them and onto the crucible in a complicated pattern that Lyra\u0027s eyes followed without hesitation, but which was incomprehensible to the two men.\n When it had completed the movements several times, Lyra looked up. She blinked once or twice as if she were coming out of a trance.\n \"They\u0027re going to pretend to attack it, but they\u0027re not really going to, because it\u0027s too far away and they\u0027d be too stretched out,\" she said.\n \"Would you tell me how you read that?\"\n \"The dolphin, one of its deep-down meanings is playing, sort of like being playful,\" she explained. \"I know it\u0027s the fifteenth because it stopped fifteen times and it just got clear at that level but nowhere else. And the helmet means war, and both together they mean pretend to go to war but not be serious. And the baby means-it means difficult-it\u0027d be too hard for them to attack it, and the anchor says why, because they\u0027d be stretched out as tight as an anchor rope. I just see it all like that, you see.\"\n Dr. Lanselius nodded.\n \"Remarkable,\" he said. \"I am very grateful. I shall not forget that.\"\n Then he looked strangely at Farder Coram, and back at Lyra.\n \"Could I ask you for one more demonstration?\" he said. \"If you look out of this window, you\u0027ll see a shed with forty or more sprays of cloud-pine hanging on the wall. One of them has been used by Serafina Pekkala, and the others have not. Could you tell which is hers?\"\n \"Yeah!\" said Lyra, always ready to show off, and she took the alethiometer and hurried out. She was eager to see cloud-pine, because the witches used it for flying, and she\u0027d never seen any before.\n The two men stood by the window and watched as she kicked her way through the snow, Pantalaimon bouncing beside her as a hare, to stand in front of the wooden shed, head down, manipulating the alethiometer. After a few seconds she reached forward and unhesitatingly picked out one of the many sprays of pine and held it up.\n Dr. Lanselius nodded.\n Lyra, intrigued and eager to fly, held it above her head and jumped, and ran about in the snow trying to be a witch. The consul turned to Farder Coram and said: \"Do you realize who this child is?\"\n \"She\u0027s the daughter of Lord Asriel,\" said Farder Coram.\n \"And her mother is Mrs. Coulter, of the Oblation Board.\"\n \"And apart from that?\"\n The old gyptian had to shake his head. \"No,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t know any more. But she\u0027s a strange innocent creature, and I wouldn\u0027t have her harmed for the world. How she comes to read that instrument I couldn\u0027t guess, but I believe her when she talks of it. Why, Dr. Lanselius? What do you know about her?\"\n \"The witches have talked about this child for centuries past,\" said the consul. \"Because they live so close to the place where the veil between the worlds is thin, they hear immortal whispers from time to time, in the voices of those beings who pass between the worlds. And they have spoken of a child such as this, who has a great destiny that can only be fulfilled elsewhere-not in this world, but far beyond. Without this child, we shall all die. So the witches say. But she must fulfill this destiny in ignorance of what she is doing, because only in her ignorance can we be saved. Do you understand that, Farder Coram?\"\n \"No,\" said Farder Coram, \"I\u0027m unable to say that I do.\"\n \"What it means is that she must be free to make mistakes. We must hope that she does not, but we can\u0027t guide her. I am glad to have seen this child before I die.\"\n \"But how did you recognize her as being that particular child? And what did you mean about the beings who pass between the worlds? I\u0027m at a loss to understand you, Dr. Lanselius, for all that I judge you\u0027re an honest man....\"\n But before the consul could answer, the door opened and Lyra came in bearing a little branch of pine.\n \"This is the one!\" she said. \"I tested \u0027em all, and this is it, I\u0027m sure. But it won\u0027t fly for me.\"\n The consul said, \"Well, Lyra, that is remarkable. You are lucky to have an instrument like that, and I wish you well with it. I would like to give you something to take away with you....\"\n He took the spray and broke off a twig for her.\n \"Did she really fly with this?\" Lyra said.\n \"Yes, she did. But then she is a witch, and you are not. I can\u0027t give you all of it, because I need it to contact her, but this will be enough. Look after it.\"\n \"Yes, I will,\" she said. \"Thank you.\"\n And she tucked it into her purse beside the alethiometer. Farder Coram touched the spray of pine as if for luck, and on his face was an expression Lyra had never seen before: almost a longing. The consul showed them to the door, where he shook hands with Farder Coram, and shook Lyra\u0027s hand too.\n \"I hope you find success,\" he said, and stood on his doorstep in the piercing cold to watch them up the little street.\n \"He knew the answer about the Tartars before I did,\" Lyra told Farder Coram. \"The alethiometer told me, but I never said. It was the crucible.\"\n \"I expect he was testing you, child. But you done right to be polite, being as we can\u0027t be sure what he knows already. And that was a useful tip about the bear. I don\u0027t know how we would a heard otherwise.\"\n They found their way to the depot, which was a couple of concrete warehouses in a scrubby area of waste ground where thin weeds grew between gray rocks and pools of icy mud. A surly man in an office told them that they could find the bear off duty at six, but they\u0027d have to be quick, because he usually went straight to the yard behind Einarsson\u0027s Bar, where they gave him drink.\n Then Farder Coram took Lyra to the best outfitter\u0027s in town and bought her some proper cold-weather clothing. They bought a parka made of reindeer skin, because reindeer hair is hollow and insulates well; and the hood was lined with wolverine fur, because that sheds the ice that forms when you breathe. They bought underclothing and boot liners of reindeer calf skin, and silk gloves to go inside big fur mittens. The boots and mittens were made of skin from the reindeer\u0027s forelegs, because that is extra tough, and the boots were soled with the skin of the bearded seal, which is as tough as walrus hide, but lighter. Finally they bought a waterproof cape that enveloped her completely, made of semitransparent seal intestine.\n With all that on, and a silk muffler around her neck and a woollen cap over her ears and the big hood pulled forward, she was uncomfortably warm; but they were going to much colder regions than this.\n John Faa had been supervising the unloading of the ship, and was keen to hear about the witch consul\u0027s words, and even keener to learn of the bear.\n \"We\u0027ll go to him this very evening,\" he said. \"Have you ever spoken to such a creature, Farder Coram?\"\n \"Yes, I have; and fought one, too, though not by myself, thank God. We must be ready to treat with him, John. He\u0027ll ask a lot, I\u0027ve no doubt, and be surly and difficult to manage; but we must have him.\"\n \"Oh, we must. And what of your witch?\" \"Well, she\u0027s a long way off, and a clan queen now,\" said Farder Coram. \"I did hope it might be possible for a message to reach her, but it would take too long to wait for a reply.\" \"Ah, well. Now let me tell you what I\u0027ve found, old friend.\" For John Faa had been fidgeting with impatience to tell them something. He had met a prospector on the quayside, a New Dane from the country of Texas, and this man had a balloon, of all things. The expedition he\u0027d been hoping to join had failed for lack of funds even before it had left Amsterdam, so he was stranded.\n \"Think what we might do with the help of an aeronaut, Farder Coram!\" said John Faa, rubbing his great hands together. \"I\u0027ve engaged him to sign up with us. Seems to me we struck lucky a coming here.\"\n \"Luckier still if we had a clear idea of where we were going,\" said Farder Coram, but nothing could damp John Faa\u0027s pleasure in being on campaign once more.\n \n After darkness had fallen, and when the stores and equipment had all been safely unloaded and stood in waiting on the quay, Farder Coram and Lyra walked along the waterfront and looked for Einarsson\u0027s Bar. They found it easily enough: a crude concrete shed with a red neon sign flashing irregularly over the door and the sound of loud voices through the condensation-frosted windows.\n A pitted alley beside it led to a sheet-metal gate into a rear yard, where a lean-to shed stood crazily over a floor of frozen mud. Dim yellow light through the rear window of the bar showed a vast pale form crouching upright and gnawing at a haunch of meat which it held in both hands. Lyra had an impression of bloodstained muzzle and face, small malevolent black eyes, and an immensity of dirty matted yellowish fur. As it gnawed, hideous growling, crunching, sucking noises came from it.\n Farder Coram stood by the gate and called:\n \"lorek Byrnison!\"\n The bear stopped eating. As far as they could tell, he was looking at them directly, but it was impossible to read any expression on his face.\n \"lorek Byrnison,\" said Farder Coram again. \"May I speak to you?\"\n Lyra\u0027s heart was thumping hard, because something in the bear\u0027s presence made her feel close to coldness, danger, brutal power, but a power controlled by intelligence; and not a human intelligence, nothing like a human, because of course bears had no daemons. This strange hulking presence gnawing its meat was like nothing she had ever imagined, and she felt a profound admiration and pity for the lonely creature.\n He dropped the reindeer leg in the dirt and slumped on all fours to the gate. Then he reared up massively, ten feet or more high, as if to show how mighty he was, to remind them how useless the gate would be as a barrier, and he spoke to them from that height.\n \"Well? Who are you?\"\n His voice was so deep it seemed to shake the earth. The rank smell that came from his body was almost overpowering.\n \"I\u0027m Farder Coram, from the gyptian people of Eastern Anglia. And this little girl is Lyra Belacqua.\"\n \"What do you want?\"\n \"We want to offer you employment, lorek Byrnison.\"\n \"I am employed.\"\n The bear dropped on all fours again. It was very hard to detect any expressive tones in his voice, whether of irony or anger, because it was so deep and so flat.\n \"What do you do at the sledge depot?\" Farder Coram asked.\n \"I mend broken machinery and articles of iron. I lift heavy objects.\"\n \"What kind of work is that for a panserbjorn?\"\n \"Paid work.\"\n Behind the bear, the door of the bar opened a little way and a man put down a large earthenware jar before looking up to peer at them.\n \"Who\u0027s that?\" he said.\n \"Strangers,\" said the bear.\n The bartender looked as if he was going to ask something more, but the bear lurched toward him suddenly and the man shut the door in alarm. The bear hooked a claw through the handle of the jar and lifted it to his mouth. Lyra could smell the tang of the raw spirits that splashed out.\n After swallowing several times, the bear put the jar down and turned back to gnaw his haunch of meat, heedless of Farder Coram and Lyra, it seemed; but then he spoke again.\n \"What work are you offering?\"\n \"Fighting, in all probability,\" said Farder Coram. \"We\u0027re moving north until we find a place where they\u0027ve taken some children captive. When we find it, we\u0027ll have to fight to get the children free; and then we\u0027ll bring them back.\"\n \"And what will you pay?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what to offer you, lorek Byrnison. If gold is desirable to you, we have gold.\"\n \"No good.\"\n \"What do they pay you at the sledge depot?\"\n \"My keep here in meat and spirits.\"\n Silence from the bear; and then he dropped the ragged bone and lifted the jar to his muzzle again, drinking the powerful spirits like water.\n \"Forgive me for asking, lorek Byrnison,\" said Farder Coram, \"but you could live a free proud life on the ice hunting seals and walruses, or you could go to war and win great prizes. What ties you to Trollesund and Einarsson\u0027s Bar?\"\n Lyra felt her skin shiver all over. She would have thought a question like that, which was almost an insult, would enrage the great creature beyond reason, and she wondered at Farder Coram\u0027s courage in asking it. lorek Byrnison put down his jar and came close to the gate to peer at the old man\u0027s face. Farder Coram didn\u0027t flinch.\n \"I know the people you are seeking, the child cutters,\" the bear said. \"They left town the day before yesterday to go north with more children. No one will tell you about them; they pretend not to see, because the child cutters bring money and business. Now, I don\u0027t like the child cutters, so I shall answer you politely. I stay here and drink spirits because the men here took my armor away, and without that, I can hunt seals but I can\u0027t go to war; and I am an armored bear; war is the sea I swim in and the air I breathe. The men of this town gave me spirits and let me drink till I was asleep, and then they took my armor away from me. If I knew where they keep it, I would tear down the town to get it back. If you want my service, the price is this: get me back my armor. Do that, and I shall serve you in your campaign, either until I am dead or until you have a victory. The price is my armor. I want it back, and then I shall never need spirits again.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/52/195.html","bookId":390,"book":{"id":390,"title":"The Golden Compass黄金罗盘","description":"简介： If Pullman\u0027s imagination dazzled in the Victorian thrillers that culminated with The Tin Princess, in this first volume of a fantasy trilogy it is nothing short of breathtaking.
