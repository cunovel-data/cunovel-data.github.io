{"id":110466,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"It was easier said than done, and once Hugh and Roman gave me some space, the full impact of what had taken place really and truly hit me.\n Seth was Kyriakos.\n Kyriakos was Seth.\n Even after witnessing what I had with my own eyes, I don\u0027t think I would have believed it if something inside me . . . some gut instinct . . . hadn\u0027t told me it was all true. Not that I\u0027d ever suspected it. Not that I\u0027d ever dreamed it. The draw that I\u0027d felt to Seth had been strong, no question, just as the draw to his other incarnations had been. I\u0027d always felt there was something special about Seth in particular, though, and wondered now what might have set this life apart from the rest. Did some part of me - or some part of him? - recognize that this was the last chance for us to be together? Was that where the urgency was coming from? Or was it more about the passage of time and whom I had become? Recent years had made me more jaded about life as a succubus, and I wondered if perhaps that was what made him and our love so precious to me at this point in time.\n Our love, which had just blown up before my eyes.\n I called in sick to work the next day, something that didn\u0027t really go over all that well. It was Christmas Eve, one of the busiest days for Santa and his mall team, but I didn\u0027t care. There was no way I could face that chaos, not after what had happened with Seth. I was told curtly that if I didn\u0027t come into work, then I shouldn\u0027t expect to be rehired next year. I almost laughed and only barely managed to cling to some shred of professionalism, as I gravely informed my manager that I\u0027d take that risk. Next Christmas, I\u0027d most likely be in Las Vegas. Even if I wasn\u0027t, I was pretty sure I could manage to get by without minimum wage and my foil dress.\n Finding Seth proved trickier. He didn\u0027t answer my phone calls, and when I went to his condo, no one answered. Neither his nor Margaret\u0027s car was parked out front, leading me to believe they were either doing last-minute Christmas shopping or visiting Terry and Andrea. If it was the former, I had no way of locating Seth easily. If it was the latter, I certainly wasn\u0027t going to barge into Terry\u0027s house and demand Seth speak to me. The situation might be dire, but I still had my boundaries.\n It would\u0027ve been so easy to use these obstacles as the means to dodge talking to Seth altogether. Despite my assurances to Hugh and Roman, I really didn\u0027t want to see Seth. Well, the part of me that was in love with him did. That part was in agony every moment we weren\u0027t together. But the rest of me didn\u0027t want to face that expression again, that terrible hurt on his face. I didn\u0027t want to confront the reality of what I was.\n Despite agreeing to see Seth, I really hadn\u0027t been able to truly convey to Roman and Hugh just how agonizing the thought of facing up to my sins was. I hadn\u0027t been able to handle the wrongness of what I\u0027d done then; I could barely do it now. I\u0027d sold my soul, blighted away the memories of all those I\u0027d loved . . . all because I didn\u0027t want to accept the responsibility of what a terrible thing I\u0027d done. You\u0027d think after almost a millennium and a half, that fear and self-preservation would have changed. I guess it hadn\u0027t.\n Or maybe it had. The fact that I was trying to find Seth now was proof that I had changed a little, enough to attempt another conversation after his adamant rejection of me.\n \"Kincaid?\"\n I glanced behind me. I was standing in line at a coffee shop Seth occasionally patronized to sit and write. Coming here had been a long shot, and I hadn\u0027t been all that surprised to see he wasn\u0027t around. Last I knew, he hadn\u0027t been here in ages, especially with everything going on in his family. Apparently, this place had other patrons I hadn\u0027t known about.\n \"Doug,\" I said in surprise. I quickly placed my order for a white chocolate mocha and then waved as Doug strolled over to me. He\u0027d just come in, and fine drops of water covered his black hair. \"What are you having?\" I gestured to the barista. Doug looked a little surprised but only hesitated a moment before ordering an inhumanly sized cup of drip.\n \"Thanks,\" he told me, when I handed it over to him.\n \"You want to sit a minute?\" I asked. My original intention had been to grab the mocha and go. I didn\u0027t know what Doug\u0027s plan was, but some perverse urge made me want to try to get a moment with him.\n \"Sure,\" he said, looking a little uncertain. \"But just for a minute. I\u0027ve got to be at work in an hour.\"\n \"We don\u0027t want you to be late for that,\" I agreed, settling down at a small table that gave us a fine view of the sleet outside. Seattle wasn\u0027t really known for white Christmases. \"All those last-minute shoppers trying to get their boxed sets.\"\n The ghost of a smile crossed his face. \"You know it. I\u0027m surprised you aren\u0027t at work. Is it true? I heard you were, uh, working elf duty at a mall on the Eastside.\"\n I grimaced. \"Painfully true. But I quit today.\"\n His eyebrows rose. \"On Christmas Eve? That\u0027s cold, Kincaid. Think of the children.\"\n \"I know. But, well, something came up. . . .\" I glanced away, unable to meet his eyes as all my troubled feelings threatened to surface.\n \"Yeah, I can tell,\" he said.\n I dared a look back. \"What do you mean?\"\n Doug shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. Just this vibe I always got off of you when you were feeling blue. You put on a good face for most of the world, but when something hurts you, your energy changes. Christ.\" He took a big drink of coffee. \"Now I\u0027m sounding all New Agey and shit.\"\n \"Well, whatever it is, your instincts are right.\" I reconsidered. \"Though \u0027blue\u0027 is kind of an understatement. More like navy. Or even black.\"\n \"Mortensen?\" he guessed.\n I shook my head and glanced away again. \"You don\u0027t want to hear about that.\" Although, perhaps some part of him would be glad to know Seth and I were through. It\u0027d be vindication after what we did to Maddie.\n \"Try me,\" said Doug. When I didn\u0027t answer, he sighed. \"Kincaid, I don\u0027t hate you. I\u0027m not happy about what went down, but in some weird, twisted way, I do still care about you. If something\u0027s wrong, you can tell me. Did Mortensen hurt you?\"\n \"No,\" I said. Then: \"Well, yes, but not without cause. I hurt him first.\"\n \"Ah.\"\n I dragged my gaze back to Doug. His eyes were dark and serious, no trace of enjoyment in my suffering. \"I\u0027ve been trying to find him today . . . trying to get a hold of him. But I think he\u0027s avoiding me. No, I know he\u0027s avoiding me.\"\n \"You\u0027ll patch it up,\" said Doug.\n \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think we can this time.\"\n \" \u0027This time,\u0027 \" he scoffed. \"Kincaid, the first moment I saw you and Mortensen together, there was something there. I don\u0027t know how to describe it. I was always surprised you guys never went out. I was surprised when he started going out with Maddie, though they seemed happy enough until . . . well, you know. Until he figured out he should be going out with you.\" He paused, thinking. \"Anyway, I talk a good talk about love in my songs but really don\u0027t know shit about it in real life. From what I do know, though, I feel like it\u0027s going to take more than whatever argument this is to keep you guys apart.\"\n \"Thanks,\" I said. \"That\u0027s nice of you . . . but you don\u0027t know. What I did was pretty terrible.\"\n \"What you guys did to Maddie was pretty terrible,\" said Doug. \"But I\u0027ve forgiven you.\"\n \"You have?\" I asked, startled.\n \"Yeah.\" He seemed a little surprised by the admission. \"I mean, it helps that this neurosurgeon asked her out last week. I can forgive a lot if it means having a doctor brother-in-law. But in all seriousness? I know you guys didn\u0027t mean to hurt her, just like you didn\u0027t mean to hurt Mortensen here. What you did do is screw up majorly in the forthcomingness department.\"\n \"Forthcomingness?\" I repeated.\n He waved me off. \"Whatever. It\u0027s a word. If you guys had been honest with yourselves and with her, you could\u0027ve saved everyone a world of hurt. Keep that in mind now.\"\n \"You\u0027re a regular relationship guru,\" I said, earning me another scoff. Yet, as wise as his words sounded, I still didn\u0027t think there was any way to fix this thousand-year-old hurt. Before I could muster another comment, my phone rang. I looked down at the display in surprise. \"It\u0027s Seth.\"\n \"You better answer it, then,\" said Doug.\n With a gulp, I did.\n \"Hello? Yeah. Uh-huh . . . sure. Okay . . . I understand. Okay. Bye.\"\n I disconnected and Doug gave me a questioning look. \"That didn\u0027t sound all that warm and fuzzy.\"\n \"Seth wants me to come to Christmas dinner tomorrow,\" I said disbelievingly.\n \"Well, that\u0027s a good sign,\" said Doug.\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t think it is. He said he doesn\u0027t want to create more upset in the girls\u0027 lives and just wants me there for appearances, to make them happy. He made it clear that nothing\u0027s changed, nor does he expect it to.\"\n \"I guess it\u0027s more of a lukewarm sign, then,\" said Doug.\n I sighed, and Doug gently chucked my chin.\n \"Cheer up, Kincaid. You wanted to talk to him. Here\u0027s your chance, no matter what he said. Don\u0027t waste it.\"\n I mustered a smile. \"How\u0027d you get so wise, Doug?\"\n He finished his coffee in a gulp. \"Fuck if I know.\"\n Doug\u0027s words were the kind that you hear in movies and books, the kind that power the against-all-odds comeback we love to see. It was my one chance, my chance to break through Seth\u0027s walls and surmount the insurmountable problems between us.\n But Seth made sure I never had the chance.\n I arrived on my own, laden with presents, and was immediately directed to entertain the girls. Seth made the request, since he and most of the other adults (except Ian, who only marginally counted as an adult anyway) were dug in inside the kitchen, and it seemed very reasonable. Normally, I wouldn\u0027t have minded either, except I had the gut feeling Seth was purposely keeping us far apart and constantly surrounded by people.\n So, I played with the girls, only half-listening as they excitedly told me about what they\u0027d gotten for Christmas. The only time my brooding thoughts shifted from Seth was when Brandy remarked about how more presents had shown up under their tree this morning than could be accounted for.\n \"No one will own up to having gotten some of the presents. Mom and Dad think Uncle Seth did it. He thinks Grandma did it,\" Brandy said in a soft voice, so the littler ones wouldn\u0027t overhear her.\n \"What kind of presents?\" I asked.\n She shrugged. \"Just toys . . . but lots of them. Like, Mom and Dad got Morgan some Princess Ponies. But this morning ? There were some Power Prism Ponies there too.\"\n I vaguely remembered Carter and Morgan discussing those very ponies. \"Maybe Santa came by,\" I said.\n Brandy rolled her eyes, looking skeptical. \"Maybe.\"\n When dinner came, there was no avoiding being near Seth. Everyone expected us to sit together, and he could hardly ask to move somewhere else. But again, with so many people around, it didn\u0027t matter. I wasn\u0027t going to bring up any dangerous topics in the middle of Christmas dinner, and Seth knew that. Both of us were silent, simply listening as the others talked excitedly about the day and how happy they were that Andrea was feeling better.\n When dinner ended, Seth was the first one up and made a big deal about how all the guys should do dishes tonight while the ladies of the household retired to the living room. Everyone was pleased with this idea, except for Ian and me.\n \"What is it with you guys and Christmas?\" asked Andrea conspiratorially.\n I was sitting with her on the loveseat watching as Kendall directed Morgan\u0027s ponies into an epic battle to the death. \"Huh?\" I asked, glancing away from the battlefield.\n \"You and Seth,\" said Andrea. \"I remember last Christmas, you guys were the same. Isn\u0027t this supposed to be the happiest day of the year?\"\n I repressed a grimace. Last Christmas, I\u0027d found out that Seth had slept with Maddie in an effort to \"protect me\" from a relationship with him. Yeah. That hadn\u0027t been a great holiday either.\n \"We\u0027ve got nothing against Christmas,\" I said bleakly. \"Just . . . some issues to sort out.\"\n She frowned. \"Is it about his tour? I figured you\u0027d be for that.\"\n \"What tour?\"\n \"His publisher wants him to go traveling right after New Year\u0027s. Seth had originally refused because of . . . well, me. But I\u0027ve felt so good lately, I told him he shouldn\u0027t waste the chance.\"\n I hadn\u0027t known about that. I wondered if it was something that had just come up in the last day or if Seth simply hadn\u0027t told me beforehand. The tour would fall before my Las Vegas transfer, and I wouldn\u0027t have put it past Seth to decline it in order to maximize his time with me. Well, at least before things went bad.\n \"That\u0027s not it,\" I said after several seconds, when I realized she was expecting an answer from me. \"It\u0027s . . . complicated.\"\n \"It always is,\" she said wisely.\n I looked past her, toward the kitchen, where I could just barely see the Mortensen men moving around with the dishes. \"For now, I\u0027d just settle for a few moments alone.\"\n She made no comment about that, but later, when the guys returned to the living room, she said very casually, \"Seth, would you mind going upstairs to get my red cardigan? I left it on the foot of the bed.\"\n Seth was about to sit down - far away from me, of course - but sprang up instantly at the request. As soon as he\u0027d disappeared up the stairs, Andrea nudged me with her elbow. I turned to her, startled, and she jerked her head toward the stairs.\n Go, she mouthed. I glanced around, saw no one was paying much attention to me, and hurried after Seth.\n I found him in the bedroom, staring around curiously for the sweater that most likely didn\u0027t even exist. When he saw me in the doorway, he sighed heavily, realizing he\u0027d been tricked.\n \"I don\u0027t have time for this,\" he said, attempting to move past me.\n I put out my arm to block the door. \"Seth, please. Just listen to me. Just for a few minutes.\"\n He stood there, only a few inches away, and then backed up. Since he apparently didn\u0027t want to push past and risk touching me, he must have decided distance was better, even at the risk of being trapped in the room. \"Georgina, there is nothing you can say. Nothing that can change what happened between us.\"\n \"I know that,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not going to try.\"\n He eyed me suspiciously. \"You aren\u0027t?\"\n I swallowed, all words and thoughts fading from me as I stared into his eyes. There it was - that look. That same look of hurt and utter devastation that Kyriakos had worn so many centuries ago. It was looking out at me through Seth\u0027s eyes.\n I nodded. \"We need to know about your contract. We just want to know some details.\"\n \"To help you?\" he asked.\n \"To help both of us. From what we\u0027ve gathered, Hell violated my contract when it wrote yours. And that makes the conditions of yours contradictory. We might be able to get them both invalidated . . . but we need to understand yours better.\"\n Seth leaned against the wall, eyes staring vacantly ahead as his thoughts turned inward. \"I don\u0027t even understand the details of my contract. I barely remember it. . . . I mean, I do and don\u0027t. What went down . . . with the hypnosis . . . it\u0027s real and it\u0027s not.\"\n I started to take a step forward, wanting badly to touch him and comfort him since he was clearly distraught. Caution held me back. \"You have to try. Right now, if you don\u0027t, then you\u0027re going to go to Hell when you die. Doesn\u0027t matter if you become a saint before then. That contract brands your soul . . . unless, well . . . we\u0027re not sure if there was some condition that if you and I got back together, then you\u0027d be free. That\u0027s what we need to know.\"\n \"Does it matter?\" he asked. \"Seeing as that doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s going to happen - doesn\u0027t look like it was ever going to happen, if all those lives were any indication.\"\n \"Well, I mean, yeah . . . it matters in that the more information we have, the better our case.\"\n \"Can\u0027t you just have Hugh look it up?\"\n I shook my head. \"Not without raising attention. It\u0027d be better if we can get the details from you.\"\n \"Well, sorry, then. I don\u0027t remember anything more than what I told you. And honestly? I don\u0027t care.\"\n \"How can you not care?\" I asked incredulously. \"It\u0027s your soul we\u0027re talking about!\"\n \"I\u0027ll take my chances,\" he said.\n A spark of anger permeated the sorrow that had clung to me these last couple days. \"There are no \u0027chances.\u0027 It\u0027s a done deal. Your soul belongs to Hell. Nothing\u0027s going to change it.\"\n \"Does it really matter? You gave your soul to Hell.\"\n \"For you!\" I cried. \"I did it for you. To save you. I would do it a hundred times over if I had to.\"\n Seth scoffed. \"Why didn\u0027t you just not cheat on me one time?\"\n \"I was young, and I was stupid,\" I said, amazed at how levelly I could acknowledge that. \"I was scared, and I felt like you were so far away from me. Like I wasn\u0027t part of your priorities anymore. It was all about work and music for you.\"\n \"And you never thought about talking to me about any of that first? You know you can always bring anything up to me.\"\n I sighed. \"To you, maybe. Not to Kyriakos. He . . . you . . . may have meant well but wasn\u0027t always so easy to get through to.\"\n \"But I am him,\" argued Seth, though he sound a little unsure. \"Er, was.\"\n \"Yes and no,\" I said. \"Look, I\u0027m no expert on reincarnation, but from what I know, even though the soul and some parts of the character are constant, there\u0027s still, like . . . evolving taking place. You grow and change. That\u0027s the point of reincarnation. You\u0027re the same person, but you aren\u0027t. You weren\u0027t perfect back then. Hell, you aren\u0027t now. Maybe you - Seth - can handle talking about this . . . maybe after ten lives, you\u0027ve developed enough relationship maturity. Back then? I\u0027m not so sure. I obviously didn\u0027t have it either.\"\n \"Obviously,\" he repeated. His gaze held me for a long time, and this time, I couldn\u0027t tell what he was feeling. At least there was no overt hate or anything. Either that, or he\u0027d simply learned to conceal it. Finally, he said, \"I meant it. I don\u0027t remember the contract details. . . . Just that I would be allowed to keep finding you.\"\n \"That\u0027s it?\" I said. \"Nothing else? If there\u0027s anything more . . . I mean, the stakes here are huge, Seth. I know you said you\u0027d take your chances, but remember when we\u0027re talking about your soul, we\u0027re looking beyond the scope of one human life. We\u0027re looking at eternity.\"\n \"There you go again,\" he said, with a small, rueful smile. \"Making an argument for the sanctity of the soul, a soul you threw away.\"\n \"And I told you before, I\u0027d do it again.\"\n \"So you wouldn\u0027t have to face me and look me in the eye after what you\u0027d done.\"\n \"In part,\" I said. \"But also to save your life. To give you a chance at happiness. Because at that moment . . . that was more important than my eternity.\"\n Seth took a long time to answer, and I again wished I knew what was happening behind those brown eyes. Whose thoughts were stirring in there? His or Kyriakos\u0027s? Or any of the other men I\u0027d had turbulent romances with?\n \"You didn\u0027t want to face me then,\" he said at last. \"But here you are. Why? To save your own soul?\"\n \"To save both our souls,\" I said.\n Seth straightened up from his slouch against the wall and moved toward the door. \"I can\u0027t help you. I mean it - I don\u0027t remember anything else. Now. If you\u0027d please make some polite excuse to the others and leave, I\u0027d really appreciate it.\"\n He came to stand in front of me in the doorway, and for a half a second, time stood still as we studied each other, only a few inches apart. A thousand feelings warred within me, powered by a thousand years\u0027 worth of lifetimes. With a slow nod, I yielded and let him walk past me.\n He didn\u0027t look back.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-revealed-georgina-kincaid-6/page-15.html","bookId":2059,"book":{"id":2059,"title":"Succubus Revealed (Georgina Kincaid #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 6: Succubus Revealed \n After everyone finds out about Georgina\u0027s phase with Seth during his and Maddie\u0027s engagement, things degenerate at Georgina\u0027s workplace and she quits.
