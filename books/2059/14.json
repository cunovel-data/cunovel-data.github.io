{"id":110465,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Seth shot up from the chair, face filled with hurt and fury. It was surreal. For a moment, he looked like a stranger . . . and yet, he also looked like everyone I\u0027d ever known. Everyone I\u0027d loved. Everyone I\u0027d hurt.\\n\\n \"You,\" he exclaimed, striding toward me. \"How could you do that to me? How could you do that to me?\"\\n\\n I had never heard Seth yell like that. I cringed against my chair, too stunned to react. Meanwhile, Hugh seemed to come to life. He had been as shocked by Seth\u0027s initial reaction as me, particularly since Hugh understood even less than I did about what was going on. He was still undoubtedly confused, but some instinct spurred him to action when he saw Seth advance. I didn\u0027t think Seth would\u0027ve hurt me, but he was kind of scary just then. Hugh grabbed a hold of Seth\u0027s arm.\\n\\n \"Whoa, whoa,\" said Hugh. \"Easy there. Everyone calm down.\"\\n\\n Roman likewise seemed to suddenly realize something was wrong here. He\u0027d been so excited by the developments, his face aglow as all his theories fell into place. Now events were moving in a direction he hadn\u0027t foreseen. He rose, mirroring Hugh\u0027s fighter\u0027s stance. Only, Roman was doing it defensively, coming to stand in front of me, in case Seth broke Hugh\u0027s hold. That didn\u0027t seem very likely. The imp was strong.\\n\\n \"How could you do that to me?\" repeated Seth, voice still roaring with fury. \"I trusted you! I trusted you and I loved you!\"\\n\\n I had witnessed all of this unfolding but hadn\u0027t dared allow myself to really and truly accept it. I had seen the impossible. I had seen Seth relive the lives of men he hadn\u0027t known - men he couldn\u0027t have known - walking back through the centuries of my long existence. Some voice inside of me kept saying, No, no, this isn\u0027t happening. This can\u0027t be real. It\u0027s some trick of Hell\u0027s. I was working hard not to process what I\u0027d heard because processing it meant accepting it. But with those last words, Seth penetrated something inside of my numb self. He broke through, and I snapped.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t! I didn\u0027t do anything to you!\" I cried. I had to peer around Roman to meet Seth\u0027s eyes and almost wished I hadn\u0027t. They were cold. So terribly cold and hurt.\\n\\n \"You cheated on me,\" said Seth, straining against Hugh. \"Cheated on me with my best friend. . . .\" Yet, even as he spoke, I could see him falter. The feelings he\u0027d felt as Kyriakos were real, but he was examining it now as Seth Mortensen. The mixed realities were confusing him. It was understandable. They confused me.\\n\\n \"Seth,\" I said desperately. \"I didn\u0027t do that to you. Think about it. I love you. I love you so much.\"\\n\\n Seth stopped struggling, though Hugh didn\u0027t relinquish his grip. Seth\u0027s features were still filled with hurt and confusion. \"Not to me . . . to him. But I am him. I\u0027m all of them.\" Seth closed his eyes and took a deep breath. What had been reasonable and clear under hypnosis was becoming more difficult to grasp. \"How? How is that possible?\"\\n\\n \"Past lives,\" said Roman. \"You\u0027re right. You were all of them. You lived all of those lives, long before you were born into this one.\"\\n\\n \"Reincarnation? That . . . that\u0027s impossible,\" said Seth.\\n\\n \"Is it?\" asked Roman, regaining some of his confidence now that the situation was no longer escalating. \"How do you know? Do you have a direct line into the way the universe works?\"\\n\\n \"So, wait . . . what about you guys?\" asked Seth. \"Are Heaven and Hell not real?\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Hugh wryly, \"they\u0027re real.\"\\n\\n \"All of it is real,\" said Roman. \"And vastly more complex than any faulty human system can understand.\" He turned to me, expression softening. I must have looked terrified. \"What Seth saw . . . what he lived through. You knew all of them, didn\u0027t you? All of those identities?\"\\n\\n I focused on Roman, afraid I\u0027d lose my nerve if I looked at Seth again. I nodded. \"Yes . . . they were all people . . . all men I knew in my life.\"\\n\\n Hugh frowned. \"How is that possible? I can get on board with reincarnation. I\u0027ve seen enough to believe it can happen. But him always being reborn around you? You running into him - what was it, ten times? That\u0027s statistically impossible.\"\\n\\n \"The things we\u0027re dealing with aren\u0027t really governed by statistics and probability,\" said Roman. \"There are other forces at work here, forces that guide his rebirth. It was part of his contract, the deal you made as Kyriakos. What can you tell us about it?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. . . . I don\u0027t remember . . . I . . .\" Seth shook his head, the anger returning. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about this anymore. Let me go. I need to get out of here. I need to get away from her!\"\\n\\n \"Seth . . .\" I said.\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re the key!\" exclaimed Roman. \"The key to unlocking Georgina\u0027s problems. You\u0027re the other contract, the one Erik was talking about. You\u0027re tied to her, tied to everything that\u0027s been going on with her.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" said Seth. He seemed to just barely be able to keep his emotions in check. \"I don\u0027t care about your various and sundry plots! Do you have any idea what I just saw? What I just went through? I\u0027m still not even sure I understand any of it! I don\u0027t understand who I am! All I know is her - and what she did to me.\"\\n\\n \"Seth,\" I tried again. Or should I address him as Kyriakos? I didn\u0027t know. \"Please . . . I love you. I\u0027ve always loved you. What happened . . . it was . . . it was an accident. . . .\"\\n\\n The look Seth gave me was dark and wary. \"It sure didn\u0027t seem like an accident when I walked in on you.\"\\n\\n \"I never meant to . . .\"\\n\\n \"To rip my heart out?\" he cried. \"To destroy my world? My life?\"\\n\\n \"Roman,\" said Hugh carefully. \"Maybe we should give him some time to process this.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have time,\" said Roman. \"Hell can move fast - especially if they find out what we know. If we\u0027re going to save Georgina - \"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care!\" said Seth again, this time with more vehemence. \"I don\u0027t care what happens to any of you, and I certainly don\u0027t care about what happens to her. It\u0027s probably less than she deserves.\"\\n\\n \"She didn\u0027t do anything to you,\" said Roman. \"She\u0027s been a pretty solid girlfriend, from what I\u0027ve seen.\"\\n\\n \"Seth,\" I pleaded, knowing Roman wasn\u0027t quite getting it yet. \"I . . . I\u0027m sorry. It was a long time ago.\" My words were terribly, terribly inadequate, but Seth was tapping into things I\u0027d forced myself to block out - because they were too painful.\\n\\n \"For you, maybe,\" said Seth. \"It happened over the course of centuries. One life for you. But for me . . . whatever you guys did with the hypnosis, it\u0027s all here now. All of those lives . . . those memories. Here in my head at the same time. It didn\u0027t happen \u0027a long time ago\u0027 for me. It\u0027s like it just happened yesterday! All those feelings, all that pain . . .\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll fade,\" said Hugh, not sounding as though he was certain. \"What you regressed through is still fresh, and you weren\u0027t brought out of the trance properly. Give it time. Or . . . if you want, I can put you back under and make you forget this.\"\\n\\n \"And forget her?\" demanded Seth. \"So I can forget what a faithless, conniving bitch she\u0027s been to me?\"\\n\\n \"Seth . . .\" I could feel tears forming in my eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m so sorry. If I could take it back, I would.\"\\n\\n \"Which part?\" he asked. \"The part where you proved our marriage meant nothing to you? Or the countless other times you lied to me and broke my heart? Do you have any idea how I feel? What it feels like to be experiencing all of that at the same time? Maybe you\u0027ve moved past it all and don\u0027t care anymore, but it\u0027s real for me!\"\\n\\n \"It is for me too. I . . . I love you.\" They were the only words I managed to get out, and they still weren\u0027t enough. Where was all my usual glib charm? My ability to talk my way out of anything? I was still too choked up on my emotions, still reeling from the fact that looking into Seth\u0027s eyes meant looking into the eyes of every man I\u0027d ever loved. I wanted to convince him how sorry I was and explain that having a long life hadn\u0027t dulled the feelings inside me. If anything, it had only provided more time for those feelings to sink in and punish me. I wanted to explain to him how I\u0027d felt during that first transgression and how it had been a poor reaction to feelings I didn\u0027t know how to process as a scared young woman. I wanted to explain that most of my actions since then, especially the times I\u0027d pushed away other lovers, had been weak attempts at protecting them.\\n\\n There was so much I wanted to say, but I just didn\u0027t have the words - or courage - to get any of it out. So, I remained silent, and the tears spilled out of my eyes.\\n\\n Seth took a deep breath, forcing. \"Let me go, Hugh. I won\u0027t hurt her. I don\u0027t want anything to do with her. I just want to go home. I need to get out of here.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t,\" said Roman. \"We need him. We need more answers, so that we can understand the contracts.\"\\n\\n \"Hugh, let him go.\" I barely recognized the voice as my own. Roman looked at me incredulously.\\n\\n \"We need him,\" he repeated.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s done enough,\" I said flatly. In my head, Seth\u0027s words echoed: I don\u0027t want anything to do with her. \"We\u0027ve done enough to him.\" When nobody reacted, I met Hugh\u0027s gaze squarely. \"Do it. Let him go.\"\\n\\n Hugh glanced between Roman and me and then made a decision. Still keeping hold of Seth\u0027s arm, Hugh steered him away from us and walked him to the door. Roman made more protests and took a few steps toward them, but I remained frozen where I was. I didn\u0027t look behind me, not even when I heard the door slam. Hugh returned, and Roman slumped back into his chair, sighing with frustration.\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said. \"Once he calms down, we\u0027ll get him back and talk things out.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to calm down,\" I said, staring off at nothing. I don\u0027t want anything to do with her.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just in shock,\" said Roman.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer. Roman didn\u0027t know. Roman didn\u0027t understand the full scope of our history together. He hadn\u0027t seen Kyriakos\u0027s face after my betrayal, the grief that had been so deep it had nearly driven him to suicide. That was part of why I\u0027d become a succubus, using my soul to purchase peace for him in the form of forgetfulness. It was the only way to save him. But if he remembered everything now, if he really was Kyriakos reborn . . . then, no. He wasn\u0027t \"just in shock.\" I had done a terrible, terrible thing to him, and his outrage wasn\u0027t unfounded.\\n\\n A shiver ran through me as I thought about the instant connection I\u0027d had with Seth, the feeling like I\u0027d always known him. It was because I had always known him. Life after life. I\u0027d always felt like we were bound into something greater than ourselves . . . and we were. Something great and terrible.\\n\\n Hugh dragged up a chair and sat across from me. He caught hold of one of my hands. \"Sweetie, I swear to you, I had no clue any of that would happen.\"\\n\\n I gave him a halfhearted squeeze back. \"What . . . what did you think would happen?\"\\n\\n Hugh glanced at Roman. \"He asked me if I could hypnotize Seth and attempt some past life regression. I had no idea what it was for. Fuck, I had no idea it would really work, let alone walk us through nine emotionally damaged lives. Ten, since we now seemed to have fucked up this one.\"\\n\\n I felt hollow inside, hollow and aching. I turned to Roman, astonished I could manage any sort of reasonable discussion when my world had just been destroyed. \"How did you know it would happen? How did you figure all of this out?\"\\n\\n \"I only figured some of it out,\" said Roman. \"It was actually your stupid Santa stuff that tipped me off. About how that guy was worried about Santa being in two places at once?\" He scoffed and raked a hand through his hair. \"I started thinking about how everyone says your contract is fine and how Erik had mentioned a second contract. We\u0027d already deduced Hell wanted you and Seth apart, but why? And I thought, what if it\u0027s like the Santa thing? There\u0027s nothing wrong with your contract or Seth\u0027s in and of themselves, but together, something goes wrong.\"\\n\\n \"How did you even know Seth had a contract?\" asked Hugh.\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s the thing. I didn\u0027t. And since Seth had never mentioned it before, it seemed he didn\u0027t know he had one either. And how could that be? I started thinking maybe it was because he hadn\u0027t made the contract in this life. I thought maybe Hell had a long game going on with him across lives, and hence . . . the hypnosis.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus Christ,\" said Hugh, shaking his head. \"You made a fuckload of deductions there.\"\\n\\n \"And they were right,\" said Roman. \"Georgina and Seth both have contracts with Hell. And those contracts don\u0027t work together.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" I asked.\\n\\n That zealous gleam was back in Roman\u0027s eye. \"What were we able to deduce about Seth\u0027s contract? What did he get?\"\\n\\n The only thing I\u0027d deduced was that Seth was never going to speak to me again. When I refused to answer, Hugh obligingly played student to Roman\u0027s teacher. \"He got ten lives instead of one. The gift of reincarnation.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" asked Roman.\\n\\n \"To find Georgina,\" said Hugh. He paused, and I guessed he was replaying what Seth had described. \"It sounds like he died in that first life, and when the time came for his soul to move on, he was aware of missing her. I\u0027m guessing Hell wouldn\u0027t have gotten his soul then, so they made the deal to give him nine more chances to find Georgina and be reunited with her.\"\\n\\n \"He did find me,\" I said flatly. \"Over and over.\" Betrayal after betrayal.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Roman. \"And you were drawn to him without even realizing it. He certainly seemed to fit your dreamy artistic type each time. But you never made it work out.\"\\n\\n \"Which Hell was probably hoping for,\" said Hugh. The imp in him was coming out, puzzling over how a contract like this would have been designed. \"Hell has to be fair, but they always want an advantage. So, they probably went into the deal thinking a guy hoping to make amends with his soul mate could never do it if she was a succubus. Seth - or whoever - certainly didn\u0027t know that. He only knew that he was supposed to have forgotten her.\" He thought about it a few moments more. \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with that, though. That\u0027s hedging your bets on a contract. There\u0027s no violation.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right,\" said Roman. \"And that\u0027s not the problem.\" He focused back on me. \"What was your deal? What was your contract for becoming a succubus?\"\\n\\n \"You already know it,\" I said wearily. I was tired of the scheming and fallout. I want to crawl off, curl up in my bed, and sleep for the next five centuries. I wanted to renegotiate my contract and have my memory and heart purged of all pain.\\n\\n \"Humor me,\" he said. \"Just tell me the basics again. The deal Niphon made with you.\"\\n\\n \"Roman, leave her alone,\" said Hugh.\\n\\n I waved him off. \"Fine. I sold my soul and became a succubus in exchange for everyone I knew as a mortal forgetting about me.\"\\n\\n Roman looked so supremely satisfied and triumphant that I wanted to punch him just then. He nodded to Hugh. \"And tell me Seth\u0027s again, to the best of your guessing.\"\\n\\n \"At a guess? He gets to live ten lives, all of which will put him near her, giving him the chance to find her and make amends with her. Hell gets his soul at the end of the tenth life.\"\\n\\n \"And why did Seth make the deal?\" prompted Roman, practically trembling with excitement.\\n\\n \"Because he remembered that - \" Hugh cut himself off, eyes widening.\\n\\n \"Exactly,\" said Roman. He shook me in his excitement when I didn\u0027t react right away. \"Don\u0027t you get it? Your contracts contradict each other! In fact, Seth\u0027s should never have even been written! He remembered you. He knew that you were gone from his life.\"\\n\\n \"He knew his \u0027soul mate\u0027 was gone,\" I said bitterly. \"I don\u0027t think he remembered specifics. You saw how much trouble he had.\"\\n\\n Roman shook his head. \"Doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m guessing your contract specifies forgetting you entirely. He remembered. By that happening, Hell violated your contract. Then, they wrote an impossible contract for him, claiming he\u0027d have the chance to reunite with you - which again, implies a degree of remembering you.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know that exactly,\" warned Hugh. \"We haven\u0027t seen the contract and didn\u0027t get all the details from him. I couldn\u0027t follow if he got anything for patching things up with her or not.\"\\n\\n \"We know enough,\" said Roman. \"Seth wanted to be reunited with her and make amends. For that to happen, it would contradict Georgina\u0027s contract - specifying he forget her.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d want to see the wording,\" said Hugh. \"I\u0027m not trying to dash your hopes. I just know how these things work.\"\\n\\n \"Fair enough,\" said Roman. \"But can you deny that when Seth called her \u0027Letha\u0027 last month, that was most definitely in violation of her contract? He remembered. Not consciously. But some part of him, deep inside, remembered her.\"\\n\\n My thoughts were still moving sluggishly, but something clicked into place. \"The transfer . . . the transfer came through the morning after I told Jerome about Seth calling me Letha.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Roman. \"That\u0027s why things were mucked up with it. I guarantee my dear father has always known about your contracts and has accepted them grudgingly, especially if Seth\u0027s contract allows for you two to keep running into each other. But, when you told the gang about the name, Jerome had a serious problem. He recognized the violation and tattled to his superiors as fast as he could, making them panic and act quickly - too quickly - to get you out of here.\"\\n\\n \"But . . . it already happened. Seth remembered. The violation took place,\" I said, scarcely able to believe it.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like a tree in the woods,\" remarked Hugh. \"It only happens if they\u0027re called on it. Neither you nor Seth would have known about the contracts or any violation. You were oblivious. Jerome needed to keep it that way, get you guys apart and kill any chance of you figuring out what had happened.\"\\n\\n \"Hence the Vegas dream job,\" said Roman. \"It\u0027s like we talked about before. Forbidding you guys to be together would\u0027ve drawn too much attention. A run-of-the-mill transfer, however, would\u0027ve seemed like business as usual - if not for the screwup. Hell was so anxious to get it going that they sent you the memo before Jerome had a chance to meet with you. I guarantee everything you saw in Vegas was thrown together on a day\u0027s notice.\"\\n\\n I drew my hand back from Hugh\u0027s and buried my face in my palm. \"Oh God.\"\\n\\n Roman patted my shoulder in a way that was probably supposed to be comforting but mostly made me grit my teeth. \"God\u0027s not the one you\u0027ve got to look to right now. Do you realize what you\u0027ve got here, Georgina? A once in a millennium opportunity to thwart Hell! You can challenge them, call your contract into dispute. And Seth\u0027s. All you need to do is talk to him, get the exact details of - \"\\n\\n I jumped up from my chair, finally giving way to all my own grief and fury. \"No! Didn\u0027t you see his face? Didn\u0027t you hear him? He won\u0027t talk to me! Not now, not ever. And don\u0027t say he\u0027s just in shock again,\" I warned, seeing Roman about to speak. \"You don\u0027t know what I did, what it was like for him . . . back then. There\u0027s a reason I made him forget! He\u0027s not going to forgive me for this. Never. He didn\u0027t then and isn\u0027t going to now. Oh Lord. Why did we have to do this? Why did we have to make him remember? We should\u0027ve just let him forget. . . . Everything was fine. . . .\" My frantic pacing led me over to the living room window, where I drew back the curtains. It was late in the day now, the sunset turning the clouds orange.\\n\\n \"Fine?\" asked Roman, coming to stand beside me. \"Hell was creating elaborate ploys to separate you and cover their asses! And they were killing his sister-in-law to do it. That is not fine. You and Seth have done nothing but play into Hell\u0027s hands all these centuries. Over and over, you find each other and lose each other, you bicker and fight, throw it all away on mistrust and lack of communication. Are you going to let that continue? Especially when they didn\u0027t even give you what you were promised?\"\\n\\n I rested my cheek against the glass, taking comfort in the coolness, refusing to listen to Roman\u0027s logic. \"But Seth didn\u0027t remember until we made him.\"\\n\\n \"Not true. He remembered before that,\" said Roman. \"On his own, when he called you Letha. That\u0027s how this all started. Nothing we did here changed that.\"\\n\\n \"He hates me,\" I said, fully aware of how whiny I sounded.\\n\\n Roman didn\u0027t try to deny it. \"People forgive.\"\\n\\n I scoffed. \"Do they?\"\\n\\n \"They do,\" said Hugh, coming to stand on my other side. \"Seth must have - or whomever he used to be. Your husband. Why else would he have made that bargain in the first place to find you?\"\\n\\n \"Because he didn\u0027t remember what I\u0027d done,\" I said. I met Hugh\u0027s eyes. \"He only knew that I was missing from his life.\"\\n\\n \"You answered your own question, sweetie. His love for you was stronger than his hate, if he was able to remember the one and not the other.\"\\n\\n I wanted to argue with that but didn\u0027t know how. \"I can\u0027t . . . I can\u0027t face him. You don\u0027t know what this is like. It\u0027s . . .\" My lifelong fear? My greatest sin? \"I just can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"We need to know about the rest of his contract,\" said Roman. \"We need all the details if we\u0027re going to see this through.\"\\n\\n Hugh sniffed. \"You keep saying \u0027we,\u0027 but somehow I don\u0027t see you being the one filing the paperwork with Hell to challenge her contract.\" When Roman didn\u0027t answer, Hugh added, \"Which, by my estimate, we don\u0027t need any more of Seth\u0027s information for. We already have enough to question her contract\u0027s integrity.\"\\n\\n \"Question its integrity?\" exclaimed Roman. \"We have enough evidence to blow it wide open.\" There was that metaphor again. Roman loved the dramatic. \"Hell failed to hold up their end of the bargain. They told you they\u0027d make everyone forget. Obviously, they didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"It may not be quite that simple. Hell will question what you call evidence,\" said Hugh.\\n\\n \"But it can be done, right?\" asked Roman. \"You know how to do it - to file the necessary paperwork?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ve never done it before,\" said Hugh. \"Jesus. I don\u0027t know anyone who\u0027s done it.\"\\n\\n I dragged my gaze from the window. \"Don\u0027t,\" I told Hugh. \"It\u0027s not worth it. You don\u0027t know anyone who\u0027s done it because no imp who values his job or his life would ever try to get a contract revoked. I don\u0027t want you doing that for me.\"\\n\\n \"Hugh,\" said Roman, looking over me like I wasn\u0027t even there. \"You could free her. You could get her soul back for her. You could end this life she has - sleeping with strangers for eternity.\"\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" I snapped. \"Stop trying to guilt him into it. I made this choice. No one tricked me into being a succubus. They told me what it entailed and what I\u0027d get.\"\\n\\n \"And you didn\u0027t get it,\" said Hugh quietly.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" I said. If I didn\u0027t have Seth, one form of Hell was as bad as another.\\n\\n \"I would do it for you,\" said Hugh. \"I\u0027ll file the paperwork. Maybe you knew what you were getting into, but that doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t have the right to change your mind - especially if you were played. If you want it, I\u0027ll help you do it.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" I asked, recalling all the times Hugh had become uneasy whenever we\u0027d talked of challenging the status quo. \"Why would you risk it?\"\\n\\n \"Because you\u0027re my friend,\" Hugh said, his lips twisting into a bitter half smile. \"And that still means something to me. Besides, give your pal Hugh some credit here. I might be able to pull this off with minimal punishment for myself.\"\\n\\n A strange feeling welled within my chest, tight at first and then loosening. This day had become one impossible thing after another. Somehow, hearing Hugh say it made it more real. I was so used to Roman\u0027s ideas and dreams for undermining Hell that at times, it was easy to ignore them. But to hear Hugh saying this might actually work . . .\\n\\n I swallowed, feeling more tears were on the way. \"I can\u0027t even imagine that. A world where I don\u0027t belong to Hell. I don\u0027t know what my life would look like.\"\\n\\n \"Like anything you want it to,\" said Hugh, wrapping me in a hug. Behind me, I heard Roman sigh.\\n\\n \"Well. I\u0027ll settle for one contract blowing up in Hell\u0027s face. I mean, Seth was already Hell-bound anyways, wasn\u0027t he? With or without any of this?\"\\n\\n I winced. It was true. Seth\u0027s soul - once so bright and shining - had darkened when he cheated on Maddie with me. He\u0027d come to my bed out of love but had still felt guilty over what he\u0027d done. The mark of sin had tainted his soul enough that were he to die right now, Seth would go to Hell.\\n\\n Hugh cleared his throat and let go of me, suddenly looking uncomfortable. \"It\u0027s funny you mention that. . . .\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I hadn\u0027t seen him in a while and nearly didn\u0027t notice . . . but today when he was here, his soul . . .\" Hugh shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know what all he\u0027s done, but it\u0027s lightened. It\u0027s not the spotlight it used to be, but something\u0027s changed. Enough of the taint\u0027s gone now that I don\u0027t think he\u0027s marked for Hell anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Except, he is because of his contract,\" I realized. \"That was the price for all those lives. It doesn\u0027t matter how good he is.\" I felt my legs grow weak again and had to struggle to stay up. Seth had redeemed himself for his sin. How? Probably through the sacrifices he\u0027d made for his family. He\u0027d given up the things he loved most for them - writing, even me. It was a remarkable feat, something few humans were able to rebound from. Usually, those who were damned stayed damned.\\n\\n But it didn\u0027t matter. Seth\u0027s soul could shine like a supernova and he would still go to Hell, because it was the same soul he\u0027d had as Kyriakos, the one that had made the bargain to come and find me.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know for sure,\" I said. \"He didn\u0027t make it clear if he definitely signed his soul over or if there was a wager, like he\u0027d get to keep it if he made amends with me.\"\\n\\n \"Which doesn\u0027t really seem like it\u0027s going to happen at the moment,\" said Roman. \"So either way, he\u0027s damned.\"\\n\\n \"Unless we can break his contract too,\" I said. \"And we need his help for it.\"\\n\\n Hugh gave me a sympathetic look. \"Do you want me to try to talk to him?\"\\n\\n I had hated myself for what I\u0027d done to Kyriakos all those years ago, hated myself so much that I\u0027d paid the ultimate price to be wiped from his memory. And after seeing the look in Seth\u0027s eyes earlier . . . well, honestly, if given the chance, I might very well have asked to be erased again. I couldn\u0027t stand seeing that hate, that disappointment in the eyes of someone I\u0027d loved. I\u0027d hurt him. I\u0027d let him down. I wanted to hide and never see him again because if I faced him, I would have to face the failings within myself.\\n\\n That had always been a problem for me, I realized. I hated confrontation - especially when I was the one at fault. I\u0027d continually run away from that my entire life.\\n\\n I forced a weak smile for Hugh, who stood there offering me a cowardly way out. No, I decided. If we were going to get Seth\u0027s help, it would be better coming from me. Would he talk to me? I didn\u0027t know, but I had to try. For nothing else would I have risked facing that hate and sorrow again . . . but for Seth\u0027s soul, I would.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go to him,\" I said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-revealed-georgina-kincaid-6/page-14.html","bookId":2059,"book":{"id":2059,"title":"Succubus Revealed (Georgina Kincaid #6)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 6: Succubus Revealed \\n After everyone finds out about Georgina\u0027s phase with Seth during his and Maddie\u0027s engagement, things degenerate at Georgina\u0027s workplace and she quits.
