{"id":110471,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"I thought about it for half a heartbeat, and even that was too long. There was no question what my decision could be. Seth and I were bound together. Even if it had been for Jerome\u0027s convenience, Seth had found my soul across the incredible reaches of the dream world. Seth and I had found each other, life after life, and continually fallen in love. Even if we didn\u0027t consciously remember each other, some inner part of ourselves had connected. I remembered Roman\u0027s words. Over and over, you find each other and lose each other, you bicker and fight, throw it all away on mistrust and lack of communication. Are you going to let that continue? No, the cycle was going to end. On my terms. These lives we\u0027d lived . . . the pain we\u0027d suffered . . . it wouldn\u0027t be for nothing. It didn\u0027t matter if Seth hated me and never wanted to see me again. I wouldn\u0027t abandon him - not now, not ever. \"No deal,\" I said to Roman. \"Seth and I are doing this together, whether he knows it or not.\" Roman didn\u0027t try to talk me out of it. He simply said, \"You understand what\u0027s at stake?\" \"I do.\" If we failed here, I wouldn\u0027t just lose my soul. I would also be looking forward to an eternity in Hell\u0027s service, with superiors none-too-pleased that I\u0027d shaken up the status quo. I didn\u0027t doubt that there was some article or clause somewhere that said I couldn\u0027t be penalized for this, but as I\u0027d noted before, Hell had plenty of ways of punishing people off the record. The Las Vegas position would probably no longer exist, forcing me to relocate to some truly terrible location. Hannibal called the court back to order, and Roman relayed my decision. Hannibal clicked his tongue disapprovingly. \"Risking it all for the new car, eh? Well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it falls in your hands now. You\u0027ve heard the evidence - and lack thereof. Do you believe there is enough \u0027proof\u0027 to support the petitioner\u0027s case? Should both contracts - that these individuals willingly signed - be invalidated?\" So much for justice being blind. The jury cast votes anonymously, which I found interesting. It was a small nod toward impartiality, theoretically providing protection to those who voted against their side\u0027s best interests. From what both Roman and Marcel had told me, I could see it happening among the angels. But did it ever happen with demons? Even if they knew the right or wrong of a situation, their ultimate goal was to accrue souls for Hell. Would any of them be moved by a case enough to go with their conscience? Was it possible that some spark of goodness could still endure in the darkness of this place? Judging from the quick way everyone scrawled their responses on the pieces of paper given, it didn\u0027t look like it. There was no hesitation. The demons wore cocky, self-assured expressions. Angels and demons came from the same stock, but I\u0027d been told that once they spent enough time in Hell, that angelic nature was eroded away. These demons weren\u0027t going to lose any sleep about what became of my soul. The votes were collected by the bailiff. He sorted them into two suspiciously similarly sized piles and handed them to the judge. Hannibal did a quick count and nodded to himself before addressing us. A new stillness fell over the room. \"Here we go,\" murmured Roman. \"The jury has spoken,\" said Hannibal. \"Six to six. We have a tie.\" There was a collective exhalation in the room, and then the tension ramped back up as everyone waited for the next step. I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised by the tie, but some part of me had been hoping maybe, just maybe, a wayward demon would\u0027ve voted in my favor. I had my answer. There was no spark of goodness here. It couldn\u0027t survive in Hell. \"In accordance with article . . . fuck, I don\u0027t know . . . article something-or-other, we\u0027ll be going to a tiebreaker vote,\" said Hannibal. The bailiff returned with an ornate vase, which he handed to the judge. Hannibal dumped out the contents, revealing a white marble and a black marble. \"In this case, it really is as simple as black and white. If the black one\u0027s drawn, a demon casts the deciding vote. If it\u0027s white, an angel will.\" He paused, looking bemused. \"That\u0027s so cliched. I don\u0027t suppose we could switch the colors around? Just this once? No? Okay, let\u0027s get on with it.\" He scanned the jury and pointed to an angel with curly red hair and long-lashed blue eyes. \"You. You\u0027ll do the draw.\" She nodded her acceptance and approached the bench gracefully. Again, another attempt at justice. If Hannibal had drawn the marbles, I would have been suspicious of the outcome. The fairness of the matter was future solidified when he made her swear to draw fairly, without using her powers to advantage. \"I swear,\" she said, placing the marbles in the vase. She shook them up and reached her hand in, casting a brief and - unless I was mistaken - sympathetic look at me. Her hand emerged, closed in a fist. When she opened it, no one could see the marble right away, but her face told the story. \"Shit,\" said Roman. The angel\u0027s palm revealed a black marble. She handed it to the judge who made no pretense at hiding his joy. He thanked her as she returned to her seat and then held the marble up for all the room to see. There was a murmur of excitement among the demons, delighted at having won the gamble he\u0027d laid before us. I had a moment of regret, but only a small one. I could\u0027ve walked away from here with my soul and life intact. I could\u0027ve never brought this up and continued my life as a succubus undisturbed, living out the dream scenario in Las Vegas. Instead, I\u0027d risked everything for the chance to free myself and Seth. And I\u0027d lost for both of us. Had it been worth it? Yes. \" \u0027Fate\u0027 has spoken,\" said Hannibal, still admiring the marble. \"Per the rules, the decision now falls to a thirteenth juror, who will be randomly selected from a pool of Hell\u0027s illustrious servants. Doris?\" Doris began clicking away at her laptop. After a few moments, she gave a nod toward the bailiff. He walked toward the back exit, presumably to escort in the thirteenth juror. My heart felt heavy and leaden, and I was startled when Roman again placed his hand on mine. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said in a low voice. \"I should have fought harder. Or pushed you to take the deal - \" I squeezed his hand back. \"No. You were perfect. The only thing you shouldn\u0027t have done was get involved with this mess.\" It was impossible to believe, but whatever fate awaited me after my suit was denied wouldn\u0027t be half as bad as his. He gave me a playful smile. \"What, and miss the chance to laugh in the face of Heaven and Hell? Besides, there\u0027s no way I could leave you to - \" The courtroom had given way to chatter when the bailiff left, and now silence resumed upon his return. Whatever sentiments Roman had been about to say were lost, as he joined me in looking back to see the demon who would cast the last condemning vote on me. When I did, I had to do a double take. It was Yasmine. I almost didn\u0027t recognize her. It had been a year since I\u0027d seen her, a year since I\u0027d watched her fall from grace, transforming from an angel to a demon. Yasmine had committed a number of grave sins as an angel, starting when she\u0027d fallen in love. That alone was forbidden for her kind, but it had gone one step further - she\u0027d fallen for a nephilim named Vincent. Vince was a great guy, but like Roman, the standard reaction from angels and demons alike had been prompt destruction. One angel had finally acted on that impulse, and Yasmine had rushed to defend Vince - killing the other angel in the process. And with that, she had been condemned to Hell. I had seen it. It had been terrible. One angel\u0027s death, another\u0027s fall. It had all gone down the night Nyx had been found and recaptured. Vince and I had been in the cross fire of it. I\u0027d done what I could for him, but there was nothing I could do to stop Heaven\u0027s punishment. Before leaving town, Vince had told me that it didn\u0027t matter what I thought I knew about Yasmine. He\u0027d said that once she had spent enough time in Hell and around other demons, she\u0027d become like them. It was what happened to all of them, how someone like Carter could become someone like Jerome. I hadn\u0027t believed it at the time but could understand it better after being surrounded in the despair and wrongness of this place. And when I studied her now, I could see it had happened to her too. I remembered a smiling, laughing young woman with sparkling dark eyes and shining black hair. The hair and eyes were ostensibly the same, but there was no light or laughter in them. Her eyes seemed fathomless, dark and cold as she stared straight ahead and walked to the front of the courtroom. She was wearing a gauzy black dress, reminding me of some Goth courtesan, and her long, flowing hair blended into the silken fabric. Even if I\u0027d never met her or known her history, I would have instantly identified her as a demon. Just like the others in the room, there was something in the way she looked and carried herself. I was about to be condemned by someone who had once been my friend. Yasmine reached the front of the courtroom and was gestured toward the witnesses\u0027 table. She sat down, gazing around the room with an unreadable expression. \"You\u0027ve been following the trial?\" asked Judge Hannibal. \"Yes,\" she said, in a voice as expressionless as her face. How she\u0027d been watching, I couldn\u0027t say. With Hell, it could\u0027ve been closed-circuit TV or a magic mirror for all I knew. \"And you understand your duty?\" asked Hannibal. \"Yes,\" she replied. Hannibal was trying to maintain some semblance of formality and procedure, but the self-satisfied smirk on his face was kind of negating that. He was too goddamned pleased with himself and this turn of events. \"Cast your vote then, based on the evidence and arguments you\u0027ve witnessed. If you believe the two contracts are both sound and have not contradicted each other, then cast your vote against the petitioner.\" When silence followed, Roman spoke up. \"And if she thinks the two contracts aren\u0027t valid?\" \"Yes, yes.\" Hannibal made a dismissive gesture, annoyed at this obvious waste of his time. \"If you believe the contracts do contradict each other, then cast your vote for the petitioner.\" Yasmine was given a piece of paper and pen, just like the other jurors. And just like the others, she wasted no time in writing her vote, her markings swift and certain. When she finished, she looked up serenely, no change in her expression, no sign that we\u0027d ever once known each other. As terrible as I felt about my own fate, I couldn\u0027t help but feel nearly as bad for what Hell had done to someone as good and kind as her. No, I thought. Not just Hell. Really, Heaven was just as guilty. What kind of group could advocate goodness and not allow its members to love? Hannibal took the paper from her with a flourish and held it out before him to read. \"In accordance with the laws of this court, and the infallible Kingdom of Hell, the jury finds - \" There was a pause, and the next part came out as a question. \"In favor of the petitioner?\" A spark of goodness in the darkness. . . . For a moment, nothing happened. The courtroom was silent, frozen in time. Then, several things happened right on top of each other. From behind me, I heard Jerome say, \"Shit.\" Yasmine winked at me. Roman hugged me. Hannibal reread the slip of paper, looked at Yasmine, and then swallowed before speaking. \"Both contracts are declared invalid, null and void.\" Most of the room was on its feet, voices raised in fury. I had no time to process what they were saying, though, because I was disintegrating away. \"No, not yet!\" I exclaimed. I reached desperately for Roman, whose arms had been around me, but couldn\u0027t get ahold of him anymore. I was becoming nothing, a will-o\u0027-the-wisp, unable to grasp anything of substance. I tried, though. I tried to grab him and take him with me because there was no way I could leave him here, not in the midst of a bunch of demons pissed off over having just lost two souls. I even tried to say his name, but it didn\u0027t work. I had no mouth, no voice anymore. I was leaving this place, and he was staying. The last thing I saw was his sea green eyes regarding me with both happiness and sorrow. I thought I heard him saying something about \"a far, far greater thing,\" and then I perceived nothing. I would have screamed in fury if I could have, but I was gone. I was nothing. Only darkness.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-revealed-georgina-kincaid-6/page-20.html","bookId":2059,"book":{"id":2059,"title":"Succubus Revealed (Georgina Kincaid #6)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 6: Succubus Revealed After everyone finds out about Georgina\u0027s phase with Seth during his and Maddie\u0027s engagement, things degenerate at Georgina\u0027s workplace and she quits.
