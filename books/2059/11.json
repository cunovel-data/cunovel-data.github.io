{"id":110462,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"It was hard leaving Seth\u0027s side in the morning. We\u0027d had too few nights together recently, and each day that passed only served to remind me I was that much closer to the transfer. Lying in his arms, watching him sleep in the early sunlight, I thought back to what he\u0027d said about Andrea getting better. If that was true, if she was healing, then there was a chance the ties keeping Seth here might lessen. I felt selfish even thinking that way, but surely it wasn\u0027t too terrible a thing to wish we could all get a happy ending. After a leisurely breakfast, Seth and I went over to the Mortensens\u0027. He was on babysitting duty while Andrea went to a doctor\u0027s appointment, and I was there to pick up Brandy. Chaos met us at the door, and Brandy practically flew outside, breathless and laughing. \"Don\u0027t go in there,\" she warned me, after I gave Seth a quick kiss good-bye. She and I headed toward my car. \"It\u0027s crazy. Mom and Dad slept in, and Grandma let Kendall and the twins \u0027help\u0027 with breakfast.\" \"What are they making?\" \"Waffles,\" she said. \"From scratch. I don\u0027t know which was scarier: Kendall mixing the batter or Morgan and McKenna on duty with the waffle iron. They set the smoke detector off twice.\" I couldn\u0027t help but laugh as I pulled out of the driveway. \"And you and Kayla didn\u0027t help?\" \"No way,\" Brandy replied. \"I stayed away from that mess, and Kayla was in one of her silent moods today.\" \"Aw.\" I kind of wished now that I\u0027d taken a moment to go inside. Tiny Kayla had a special place in my heart. Though she was better than she used to be, she still had a tendency to simply watch her world without a word, and it could be difficult coaxing conversation from her. Some of this was shyness, and some of this - I suspected - was from the fact that Kayla was psychic. Her skills were still undeveloped, but she was sensitive to the workings of the supernatural world, which I had to imagine would make anyone of any age silent at times. \"She\u0027ll be fine. She loves waffles.\" Brandy smiled, and I was happy to see her so upbeat for a change. She shouldered just as much stress as the adults. \"If any actually get made.\" We drove downtown, and I quizzed Brandy about what she was looking for in a dress. She had little to offer, which was both charming and kind of heartbreaking. Brandy wasn\u0027t a tomboy, but with all of her family drama, dresses had been understandably off her radar. In fact, when her face lit up at all the downtown lights and decorations, it became clear that family had really been the only thing in her life recently. \"I haven\u0027t seen any of the holiday stuff this year,\" she told me, gazing out the windows. A pang in my heart reminded me that this would be my last year to see Seattle in all its holiday finery. \"We usually always come down here so that the girls can see Santa. There\u0027s been no time.\" \"The girls haven\u0027t seen Santa?\" I asked, snapping out of my moment of self-pity. \"That\u0027s not fair, especially considering I see a little too much of him.\" It made me wonder how many drinks it would take to coax Walter into a house call. It also convinced me more than ever to make this a special day for Brandy. I couldn\u0027t expect her not to worry about her mom, but today, with Andrea on the mend and Seattle\u0027s shopping wonderland ready to explore, Brandy was entitled to worry just a little less than usual. She deserved to think about herself. I took her on a whirlwind tour of designer stores, chastising her for looking at price tags. I wanted this to be about more than the dress itself. I wanted her to have an experience, to feel like a princess. I made sure the salespeople were falling all over themselves to help her, which wasn\u0027t always so easy to do at such a busy time of the year. Brandy\u0027s radiant expression told me it was worth the effort, and we finally hit gold at our third store, finding what was unquestionably the dress. It was made of dark pink satin wrapped around to create a sheath silhouette that could still show off her figure without being pornographically tight. Satin flowers near the top added a whimsical edge, and the straps and knee-length made me feel it wouldn\u0027t get her kicked out of a church function. We spent the next hour finding the perfect shoes and jewelry for it, and although each new purchase clearly made her uneasy, she stopped questioning me about the cost. She didn\u0027t know about Margaret\u0027s funding, but it had long since been spent. Exhausted and triumphant with our purchases, we went to lunch at an Italian restaurant frequented by other ladies of leisure. It was inside a larger, elegant shopping complex, and just as we were about to enter the restaurant, I saw a familiar face emerge from a nearby store. Something in my chest clenched, and I spoke before I could help myself. \"Doug!\" It took him a moment to figure out who\u0027d called to him. When he did, a series of emotions played over his face. I wondered then how the encounter would have been different if Brandy hadn\u0027t been there. Would he have even acknowledged me? Maybe. Maybe not. But Brandy\u0027s presence guaranteed politeness. No matter how angry Doug might be at me, he wouldn\u0027t snub her. \"Kincaid,\" he said, strolling over to us. \"And little Brandy. How\u0027s it going?\" \"Good,\" she said cheerfully. The two of them, I realized, could have been related if Seth and Maddie had ended up getting married. The weird fallout from their breakup hadn\u0027t had as big an effect on Brandy as the rest of us, though, and she was genuinely happy to see him. \"We\u0027re shopping.\" He favored her with a smile, and I wondered if he was avoiding eye contact with me. \"Last minute Christmas gifts?\" he asked. \"Not a chance,\" I said. \"This is all for Brandy. She\u0027s going to a dance tonight.\" \"Oh, I see how it is,\" he said. \"Getting ready to break some hearts for the holidays, huh?\" She turned bright red. \"No! It\u0027s at my church!\" Teasing girls was familiar and easy territory for Doug. \"Yeah?\" he said, forcibly keeping a straight face. \"Then why are you blushing? Church boys\u0027 hearts break just as easily as us sinners\u0027, you know. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll leave a trail of hundreds in your wake.\" \"No,\" she protested. \"Not hundreds - \" \"Just one?\" he asked slyly. Brandy looked to me for help, and I laughed. \"I knew there was someone.\" \"You guys are terrible,\" she said, though she didn\u0027t look that upset. \"Can I go put our name on the list?\" \"Sure,\" I said, still laughing. But the instant she was inside the restaurant, Doug\u0027s playful manner vanished. \"Well, I\u0027ve got to go,\" he said, starting to turn away. \"Wait, Doug, I . . .\" He looked back at me, but I was at a loss. What could I say? That I was sorry for sleeping with his sister\u0027s fiance? That I was sorry for lying to all of them and breaking her heart? How could you apologize for something like that? \"It . . . it was good to see you,\" I said at last. \"You too,\" he said, though he didn\u0027t sound convincing. He nodded toward the restaurant. \"And her. I hope she has fun.\" \"Me too. She deserves it, what with everything else going on.\" He had attempted to leave again, but my words made him pause. \"How\u0027s her mom?\" I shrugged. \"Good days and bad days. It\u0027s up and down. . . . sometimes it seems hopeless, sometimes it\u0027s like everything\u0027s fixed. Wreaks havoc on everyone. . . . you just can\u0027t assume anything, you know? She\u0027s having some good days right now, but it\u0027s been a hard road for all of them. We just never know what\u0027s going to happen next and have to hang in there as best we can. I\u0027m trying to help, but I don\u0027t know. . . . I don\u0027t feel like it\u0027s enough. But what could be?\" I promptly shut up, realizing I was rambling. Doug said nothing, his dark eyes studying me for several heavy seconds. Then, his gaze shifted to Brandy, speaking to the hostess, for a few more moments before returning to me. \"You\u0027re a good person, Kincaid,\" he said softly. And this time, he did leave. Nothing else he might have said could have surprised me more. In all the imagined conversations I\u0027d had with Doug, I\u0027d expected frigid politeness at best - and that had seemed like a long shot. More often than not, I\u0027d envisioned him telling me terrible, hurtful things, things I deserved. As much as a secret part of me yearned for him to forgive me so that we could be friends again, I really didn\u0027t think I deserved that forgiveness. I watched him walk away until Brandy stuck her head out from the restaurant door and called that they had a table. Despite how pensive my meeting with Doug left me, I was still able to enjoy the rest of the afternoon with Brandy. We were both in good spirits when we arrived back at the Mortensen home, and mine soared even higher when I saw Seth\u0027s car in the driveway. I hurried inside, eager to see him, only to have my mood shatter when I saw his face. Margaret and Terry wore similar expressions. Brandy, normally so observant, was too keyed up over her purchases to notice that there had been a significant mood shift in the house, compared to the bubbly chaos of this morning. \"We had such a great time,\" Brandy told them, face shining. \"I got the best dress.\" Margaret gave her a tight smile. \"Why don\u0027t you try it on for us?\" Brandy didn\u0027t need to be told twice, and Kendall and the twins followed her uproariously to the bedroom, offering to \"help.\" The instant they were gone, I turned to the adults. \"What happened?\" \"Bad prognosis at the doctor\u0027s,\" said Seth, when no one else spoke right away. \"But she was improving,\" I argued. I looked at them all for confirmation. \"Right?\" \"We thought so,\" said Terry. \"At the very least, she seemed to be feeling better. But in these situations . . . well, cancer tricks you that way. It\u0027s why people go so long without ever knowing they have it. She woke up feeling bad this morning, and the doctor confirmed our fears.\" I was kind of in awe at how calmly he managed to deliver that. I wasn\u0027t sure I could have without breaking down. Honestly, I didn\u0027t know how he\u0027d been able to handle any of this with as much strength and determination as he had. If this were happening to the love of my life, I was pretty sure I\u0027d crawl into in a corner and cry. Or would I? Looking at Seth, at those beloved features and compassionate expression, I suddenly knew that wasn\u0027t true. If the one I loved needed my strength, then I would give all I had within me. \"We\u0027re not telling Brandy yet,\" said Seth. \"We\u0027re not going to keep it from her, but we figured it would be best to wait until after tonight.\" I nodded slowly, having no words. I was usually so quick with a quip or soothing line, but what response could I make to that? Especially when, moments later, Brandy came bounding back down the stairs in the pink dress. Each twin held a shoe, and Kendall carried the glittering chandelier earrings we\u0027d found just before lunch. I was reminded of Cinderella\u0027s mouse retainers. Brandy\u0027s tastes had been foremost in my mind while shopping, but I\u0027d also had half an eye on what I thought her family would approve of in fashion. As she spun around for them, however, I realized it didn\u0027t matter. I could\u0027ve brought her home in rags, and they would\u0027ve loved it so long as she wore the look of radiance on her face that she did now. That was what sold it, one spot of pure joy in the dark cloud that kept hanging over this family. The adults were too overcome with emotion to speak, so Kendall did it for us. \"Doesn\u0027t she look like a princess?\" She kept trying to smooth nonexistent wrinkles out of the skirt, much to Brandy\u0027s dismay. \"I want a dress like this.\" Morgan sat down on the floor and tried to forcibly push the shoe on Brandy\u0027s foot while she still stood, furthering my Cinderella images. McKenna joined in as well, and both nearly succeeded in knocking their older sister over. \"Well?\" Brandy laughed. \"What do you think?\" \"It\u0027s beautiful,\" said Margaret. \"You\u0027re beautiful,\" said Terry. Having successfully dislodged the twins, Brandy stepped into the shoes, flushing under the praise of her family. \"I hope I don\u0027t fall in these. How stupid would that look?\" \"I don\u0027t think anything could make you look stupid,\" said Seth. \"You\u0027re perfect from head to toe.\" \"Okay, you guys,\" said Brandy, growing embarrassed. \"Now you\u0027re just pushing it.\" The \"head to toe\" comment suddenly reminded me of something. \"Oh. I won\u0027t be here to do your hair. I have to go to work soon.\" At that moment, calling in sick seemed like a reasonable idea. Nothing seemed more important than giving her a perfect night. \"That\u0027s okay,\" said Brandy. \"I can do it. Or maybe Mom can.\" \"She\u0027s been kind of tired today,\" said Terry neutrally. \"But I know she\u0027ll want to see you before you leave.\" \"I can do a French twist,\" said Margaret, surprising us all. \"If you want to wear it up.\" \"Will you show me?\" asked Brandy. Margaret nodded. \"Sure, let\u0027s go upstairs.\" Before they did, Brandy paused to give me a giant hug. \"Thank you so much, Georgina. For everything.\" They went upstairs, followed by the littler girls, all of whom thought there was nothing so wonderful as dressing up their older sister. Actually, I realized, that wasn\u0027t entirely true. Not all of them felt that way. \"Where\u0027s Kayla?\" I asked. She hadn\u0027t been in the entourage. Terry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, in a way similar to what I\u0027d often seen Seth do. \"In the living room, I think. She\u0027s been out of sorts today. Sometimes I think she can figure out what\u0027s going on, even when we don\u0027t tell her.\" With Kayla\u0027s abilities, I didn\u0027t doubt it was true. I remembered Brandy saying Kayla had been in a \"silent mood\" since this morning and wondered just how much of her mother\u0027s illness the little girl was in tune with. I left the brothers to seek her out and found her curled up in a corner of the overstuffed sofa, making herself so small that she was almost lost in the cushions. \"Hey, you,\" I said, sitting down beside her. \"How\u0027s it going? Don\u0027t you want to see Brandy\u0027s dress?\" Kayla shifted her face, looking at me with huge blue eyes. \"Georgina,\" she said. \"You have to make it stay away.\" My thoughts were on the dress, so it took a moment for me to follow what she was saying. \"Make what stay away, honey?\" \"The Darkness.\" There was something in the way she said the word that let me know she wasn\u0027t referring to shadows. When she said \"Darkness,\" I could feel the personification in her word, the looming threat of something - or someone - tangible. With a pang, I remembered that Kayla had been able to sense Nyx when she\u0027d escaped her angelic captors. I leaned toward Kayla, glad Seth and Terry were preoccupied. \"Kayla, are you talking about . . . about the creature you felt before? The one you could sense on me?\" Nyx\u0027s return would be a complication I most certainly didn\u0027t need in my life right now. She shook her head. \"A different one. The Darkness comes here, to my house. To see my mommy. Will you make it go away?\" \"Is it here now?\" I asked uneasily. \"No. Just sometimes.\" \"How many times?\" Kayla thought about it. \"Two.\" A cold feeling crept over me. \"Was last night one of those times?\" She nodded. \"Have you seen it?\" I asked her. \"No. But I feel it. I can tell where it\u0027s at when it\u0027s here.\" She peered at me beseechingly. \"Will you make it stop?\" I had no clue what this Darkness was or what I could do to stop it, but theories were running wild in my head. I kissed her forehead. \"I\u0027ll do what I can, baby. I promise. I\u0027ve got to leave now, but I\u0027ll see what I can find out for you, okay? We\u0027ll make sure the Darkness doesn\u0027t come back.\" Like the flip of a switch, Kayla\u0027s whole demeanor changed. Whereas she\u0027d been sad and withdrawn moments ago, she was now beaming and hopeful. All that faith - in me. With my empty assurance to take on something I didn\u0027t understand, she was able to put aside all of her fears and worries. All was right in her world now, thanks to me. She put her arms around me and kissed me back, and I felt like my heart would break when I finally untangled myself from her. Holiday cheer was calling, as well as a burning need to suddenly talk to Roman. Seeing as how we kept missing each other lately, I sent him a text with a reminder of when I\u0027d be home tonight and that I had important information for him. He was so caught up in his conspiracy theories that I wasn\u0027t sure if he\u0027d want to make time for what he\u0027d probably see as a little girl\u0027s fantasies. Kayla\u0027s perceptions - despite her difficulties in articulating them - had proven accurate before. I didn\u0027t know what she was sensing this time, but if there was a force inside the Mortensen household, I intended to stop it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-revealed-georgina-kincaid-6/page-11.html","bookId":2059,"book":{"id":2059,"title":"Succubus Revealed (Georgina Kincaid #6)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 6: Succubus Revealed After everyone finds out about Georgina\u0027s phase with Seth during his and Maddie\u0027s engagement, things degenerate at Georgina\u0027s workplace and she quits.
