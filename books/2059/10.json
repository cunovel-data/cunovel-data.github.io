{"id":110461,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"In centuries? I thought that was kind of an exaggeration. But I wasn\u0027t going to argue any further with him, not when he had that zealous look in his eyes. It was one I knew all too well, which in its mildest form resulted in recipe experimentation and in its severest led to immortal killing sprees.\n With all the schools on winter vacation now, Santa was no longer just doing evening duty at the mall. I had drawn a day shift for Monday and finally left Roman for bed so that I could get an early start. He acknowledged my good night with a nod, lost in his own brooding. Despite how hard he\u0027d grilled me, I knew he was thinking about the same question I\u0027d demanded of him: why would Hell want me out of Seattle so badly that they were willing to create a dream scenario for me?\n I had no answers for it that night or the next morning. I arrived at the mall bright and early, in my foil dress, only to find a mob of parents and kids already lined up there waiting for us to open shop. Walter-Santa, I was pleased to see, was actually drinking straight coffee this morning, with no mention of alcohol. Of course, he was most likely getting rid of a hangover from last night, and I didn\u0027t doubt that the requests for \"something harder\" would start by noon.\n \"Santa wishes his pavilion wasn\u0027t under the mall\u0027s skylight,\" he remarked, furthering my hangover suspicions. He settled himself into his chair - much to the gathered children\u0027s delight - and winced unhappily up at the sunlight spilling through the latticed roof of the \"holiday gazebo.\" He turned back to me and Grumpy. \"I don\u0027t suppose we could get a tarp for that?\"\n Grumpy and I exchanged looks. \"I don\u0027t think they sell tarps at this mall, Walt - Santa,\" I told him. \"But maybe on my break I can score some sheets from Pottery Barn for you.\"\n \"Yeah,\" said Grumpy, repressing an eye roll. \"I\u0027m sure we can find something very tasteful.\"\n Santa nodded solemnly. \"Santa is grateful to have such dutiful elves.\"\n We opened the floodgates. I was working right next to Santa today, meaning I got a front row seat for some of the more outlandish requests. I was also the one who got to remove screaming children, despite parental protests and pleadings to \"just keep her there until I get the picture!\" All the while, I kept thinking that instead of doing this, I could be in Las Vegas right now, working through Matthias\u0027s routines and listening to Phoebe\u0027s jokes along the way.\n Of course, that isn\u0027t to say I was entirely scornful of the whole experience. I liked Christmas, and I liked children. I wouldn\u0027t have signed on for this job if either of those weren\u0027t true. But in watching these families - especially little girls with their mothers - I just couldn\u0027t shake my worries for the Mortensens. If I thought too much about them, I started to tear up. So . . . yeah. Cynicism was preferable at times. It kept me from getting lost in my own despair.\n When my shift ended later in the day, I discovered I wasn\u0027t the only one going home. Grumpy put up a SANTA ON 10-MINUTE BREAK sign, much to the dismay of those waiting in line, and Walter followed me as I headed out to the mall offices. It was hard not to smile at the reaction of kids who just happened to be out shopping with parents and hadn\u0027t come to specifically see Santa. Children came to a standstill, mouths gaping and fingers pointing.\n \"You\u0027ve been pretty good today,\" I told Walter.\n \"It\u0027s easier when Santa knows he can go out for a drink at dinnertime,\" he told me.\n I frowned. \"Are you going home? Oh. Of course you are. You\u0027ve been here as long as me.\" Elves had always moved in and out of shifts, but Santa had stayed constant. Now, with us pulling longer hours, Walter couldn\u0027t be on the clock all the time. \"Do you have a replacement?\"\n He put a finger to his lips and winked at me, refusing to say anything while we were in public. Once we were out of sight, in the administrative offices, I got my answer when we found another Santa sitting in a chair, leafing through a Victoria\u0027s Secret catalog. He looked up at our approach and set the magazine down.\n \"Is it time?\"\n Walter nodded and turned to me. \"Vixen, do we look the same?\"\n \"Of course,\" I said. \"You\u0027re both men in red suits and white beards.\"\n \"Look closely,\" he scolded. The other Santa rose, and they stood side by side. \"Details matter. Anything a child waiting in line might notice when Bob goes out to take my place. Beard alignment, glasses, fit of the coat . . . it all matters. One small detail is all it takes for those kids to realize they\u0027ve been played, that there are two of us.\"\n \"And if they realize that,\" added Bob, using the same British accent Walter always did, \"then the illusion is over. They\u0027ll know they\u0027ve been tricked, that there is no one, true Santa.\"\n \"Wow, you guys take this seriously,\" I said, a little astonished. So, I did a closer assessment, making a few minor adjustments. I straightened Bob\u0027s hat and fixed the way some of his beard\u0027s curls were arranged. At last, I nodded. \"You\u0027re good to go.\"\n Bob looked at Walter expectantly. Walter took off his hat, beard, and glasses, revealing an ordinary-looking man with thinning salt-and-pepper hair. \"Only one Santa can exist outside this room,\" explained Walter mysteriously, watching Bob go. \"It\u0027s part of the magic.\"\n \"This was kind of sweet,\" I remarked. Off the clock now, Walter immediately produced a flask from his locker and began guzzling it. I wondered if the two Santas shared the same addiction. \"Creepy, but sweet.\"\n After a wardrobe change of my own and a brief stop home, I eventually made my way to Burt\u0027s Bowling Alley. Roman had chosen it for our immortal league practice. It was also the site of a date he and I had had way back when, during our ill-fated romance. Living with him day to day, coping with the mundane absurdities of roommate life, it was easy to forget about that part of our history. There had been a time when I thought I was falling in love with Roman, though eventually my feelings for Seth had won out. Learning Roman\u0027s true nature - and about his plot to kill Carter - hadn\u0027t helped our fledgling relationship. He\u0027d given all that up, thankfully, but there were times I wondered just how much Roman still cared for me.\n There was no sign of our illustrious teacher yet, but Seth was already there, along with Cody, Peter, and Hugh. Seeing me enter, Seth shot me a desperate, grateful look. I could only imagine what conversation he\u0027d been subjected to while trapped with them. As I approached, the four guys\u0027 shirts instantly caught my eye. Seth was wearing a Say Anything T-shirt. That was typical of him. What wasn\u0027t so typical was that my three immortal friends were all wearing identical light blue shirts. Before I could get a good look at them, Cody leaped up and thrust a folded-up blue shirt toward me.\n \"Here,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t wait to see what all four of us look like together in these.\"\n The shirt was a standard bowling style, short-sleeved and button-down. My name was embroidered on the front. Flipping it over, I found THE UNHOLY ROLLERS done in elaborate, flaming letters. I arched an eyebrow.\n \"Really?\" I said. \"This is what we\u0027re going with?\"\n \"It\u0027s clever on so many levels,\" Peter said excitedly. \"It\u0027s a take on \u0027holy rollers,\u0027 and then when you think about the fact that we\u0027re rolling balls - \"\n \"Yeah, yeah,\" I said, putting the bowling shirt on over my turtleneck. The size was off a little, and I shape-shifted to adjust it. \"I know what the definition of a pun is, Peter. I just didn\u0027t realize we were going with something so . . . blatant.\"\n \"It was either that or the Sinsationals,\" said Hugh.\n I made a face and settled into the crook of Seth\u0027s arm. \"I think you went with the right choice. And at least they\u0027re in a tasteful color.\"\n Hugh and Cody exchanged pleased, triumphant looks. Peter scowled.\n \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with pink,\" he said. \"I think it would have made a statement.\"\n \"Yeah,\" said Hugh. \"A statement that we\u0027re pansy-asses that Nanette\u0027s team could clean the floor with.\"\n Peter gave a long-suffering sigh. \"Why must you be so insecure about your masculinity? If Georgina had been around when we voted, I bet she would\u0027ve gone with pink too.\"\n At once, his words reminded all of them of why I\u0027d been gone. Their faces fell. \"Is it true then?\" said Cody. \"You\u0027re leaving?\"\n \"Afraid so,\" I told him, attempting cheerfulness I didn\u0027t feel. \"Next month, I\u0027m Vegas-bound.\"\n \"But that\u0027s not fair,\" Cody protested. \"We need you here.\"\n Hugh gave him a rueful smile. \"You haven\u0027t been in this business long enough, kid. \u0027Fair\u0027 doesn\u0027t enter into it.\"\n Cody didn\u0027t like the reference to his lack of experience, but Hugh was right. Cody hadn\u0027t been immortal long enough to go through a transfer or the organizational machinations of HR. Peter and Hugh had, and while they might be sad at the thought of leaving me, they also knew that there were some things you just can\u0027t fight.\n \"Don\u0027t feel too bad for me,\" I said breezily. \"Bastien\u0027s working there now. And I\u0027ve already got a job as a dancer.\"\n \"You can\u0027t even get a job here,\" pointed out Peter.\n \"Like a topless dancer?\" asked Hugh.\n \"No,\" I said. \"But scantily clad in sequins.\"\n Hugh nodded in approval. \"That\u0027ll work.\"\n Cody was still wearing his heart on his sleeve. His gaze fell on Seth. \"Well. I guess one good thing is that with your job, you can live anywhere. Easy enough relocation.\"\n I didn\u0027t know what Seth\u0027s thoughts on that were exactly, but he managed a brave smile. \"We\u0027ll see.\" Suddenly all I could think about was my last conversation with Andrea, when we were talking about Seth. He\u0027s the rock supporting us all right now.\n An uncomfortably warm feeling spread over me, tinged with the scent of brimstone. The other immortals and I looked up as Jerome entered, trailed by a pensive-looking Roman. I saw my surprise mirrored on my friends\u0027 faces.\n \"I didn\u0027t know you were coming,\" I said to Jerome, when the father-and-son duo reached us. \"I thought you\u0027d made it clear you weren\u0027t part of the team.\"\n \"I\u0027m not,\" he said, eyeing the worn leather chairs with disgust. \"But seeing as my honor is riding on this so-called team, I figured I\u0027d best make sure you\u0027re on the right track.\"\n \"Thanks for the vote of confidence in my abilities,\" said Roman, entering our names into the lane\u0027s computer.\n \"I don\u0027t doubt your abilities,\" said Jerome, deigning to sit at last. \"But I also know a little encouragement can sometimes go a long way in furthering success.\"\n \"I assume by \u0027encouragement,\u0027 you\u0027re referring to your extreme displeasure if we fail,\" I noted.\n Jerome\u0027s lips twitched. \"Exactly, Georgie. Besides, I also wanted to hear - \"\n Jerome fell silent as his gaze rested on Seth\u0027s T-shirt, depicting John Cusack\u0027s iconic stance with the boom box over his head.\n \"Nice shirt,\" said Jerome at last.\n \"Um, thanks,\" said Seth.\n Jerome turned back to me, like nothing had happened. \"As I was saying, I wanted to hear about your Las Vegas weekend.\"\n \"How considerate,\" I said. Beside me, I felt Seth shift restlessly. I knew my other immortal friends made him uncomfortable in just a weird sort of way, but Jerome unnerved Seth in a whole other way. No, it was more than unnerving. Jerome scared Seth, which made sense because half the time, Jerome scared us too. \"I\u0027m sure you have enough eyes and ears to tell you exactly how my weekend went.\"\n \"True,\" said Jerome. \"But that doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t enjoy getting your insight.\"\n \"Right,\" I said. \"Because my happiness means so much to you.\"\n Roman crossed his arms over his chest and fixed us with an irritated look. \"Sorry to interrupt, but do you want to practice or not?\" He gave no indication that he\u0027d grilled me on every detail of the aforementioned weekend. From his expression now, you\u0027d think that was the last thing on his mind.\n \"Certainly,\" said Jerome magnanimously. He gesture toward the lane, like some monarch kicking off a celebration. \"Begin.\"\n Roman rolled his eyes and then turned to us Unholy Rollers. \"Okay, first, let\u0027s see what level you\u0027re all at.\"\n Roman\u0027s lessons hadn\u0027t stuck with me over the last year, though I acquitted myself well with six pins on my first roll and two on the next. Cody surprised everyone with a spare, and Hugh, after first rolling a gutter ball, matched my eight. Peter created a perfect split on his first roll and hit nothing on the second. Seth, in a rare moment of bravery, leaned toward Jerome.\n \"Are there going to be handicaps in this tournament?\"\n \"That,\" said Jerome, dark eyes on the gaping hole Peter had made, \"is an excellent question.\"\n Even Roman seemed a little surprised at how all over the map we were. He jumped into his role as coach, helping each of us with our own specific problems. Cody was the only one of us who needed little assistance and threw strikes and spares pretty regularly. I proved surprisingly correctable and was soon throwing spares about two-thirds of the time, which I thought was a decent rate. No amount of instruction seemed to help Peter, whose rolls were increasingly bizarre and erratic. Hugh improved slightly but still had a tendency to always throw right, which he just couldn\u0027t shake.\n \"Here,\" said Seth, standing up as Hugh was about to finish a frame. \"Can I do it? I used to roll exactly like you do.\"\n Hugh relinquished the ball willingly, and Seth stepped up to the line. I sat up with interest, never having seen Seth bowl. He showed Hugh his technique first, miming a throw that curved slightly left. Then Seth threw for real, releasing a fast, neat ball that cleaned up Hugh\u0027s leftover pins.\n \"Jesus Christ,\" said Jerome in disgust. \"I\u0027m going to have to see if Nanette will let me put mortals on the team. It\u0027s the only way I\u0027m going to save face.\"\n \"Hey,\" said Roman. \"Give them a chance. I can work miracles in a week.\"\n Jerome stood up. \"Miracles generally aren\u0027t in our repertoire. I\u0027ve seen all I need to. I\u0027m going to go drink now in a futile effort to wipe away the memory of this debacle. When I show up for your next practice, I expect to see significant improvement in all of you. If I don\u0027t, you\u0027re all going to learn a new definition of teamwork through your shared misery and suffering.\" He turned abruptly on his heels and nearly ran into a waitress approaching us. She yelped in surprise when she saw the furious look on his face. \"Do not serve them alcohol,\" he warned her. \"We can\u0027t risk any chance of this getting worse - not that that\u0027s probably possible.\"\n We watched them both hurry away. Once Jerome left the bowling alley, Roman exhaled in relief and sat down with us. \"Okay, now that he\u0027s gone, can we dispense with this bowling nonsense and get down to business? Cody, we need to talk to you about Milton.\"\n \"Whoa, whoa,\" said Peter. \"Was I the only one who heard that part about \u0027shared misery and suffering\u0027? We need to practice.\"\n Roman waved a dismissive hand. \"We\u0027ll get back to that.\"\n \"What about Milton?\" asked Cody, looking puzzled for any number of reasons.\n \"You told him,\" said Hugh. \"Shit.\"\n \"What\u0027d you expect?\" I asked. \"You had to have known I\u0027d do something about it.\"\n \"Milton\u0027s a hit man for Hell,\" said Roman.\n \"Milton . . . not Milton that asshole vampire that was here a while ago?\" asked Peter incredulously. \"A hit man? Come on. He was a fashion nightmare, but that\u0027s about it.\"\n \"We have good reason to think he really is an assassin,\" I said slowly. \"He travels a lot, and when he\u0027s in town . . . people die. Like Erik.\"\n \"Erik was killed by a robber,\" said Cody. \"There was no sign of a vampire.\"\n \"Well, of course not,\" said Roman. \"Hell doesn\u0027t want its murders to look obvious.\"\n \"Yeah,\" said Peter, \"but that implies Hell had a reason for killing Erik.\"\n \"Hell did,\" said Roman. He nodded toward me. \"Her. Erik was investigating Georgina\u0027s contract when he was killed.\"\n I swallowed, taking a moment to find my voice. There was a small, small comfort in thinking there was a reason for Erik\u0027s death and not just some random chance of the universe. But that comfort was negated by the fact that I was the reason.\n \"Roman thinks there\u0027s some nefarious explanation for me being transferred. Some larger plot. And that Erik\u0027s death was part of it,\" I said at last.\n Seth stared at me in astonishment. \"I thought you said this was routine.\"\n I shrugged, unable to meet his eyes. \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn\u0027t.\"\n \"It isn\u0027t,\" said Roman fiercely. \"There are too many things going on, too many things that don\u0027t add up. Erik got too close to something, and Hell got rid of him. Which brings me back to my original point. Cody. You and Gabrielle followed Milton around, right?\"\n \"I . . . yeah . . .\" Cody was still in shock. \"But I mean, we didn\u0027t see him kill Erik! We didn\u0027t see anything like that.\"\n \"Did you ever see him in Lake City?\" I asked. That was where Erik\u0027s store had been.\n Cody shook his head. \"Never that far out. We just followed him mostly to some clubs. It was a game, that\u0027s all. She wanted to see a vampire, so we watched him for a while. We never followed him outside of downtown.\"\n \"I did.\"\n Everyone turned to stare at Peter.\n \"Why are you looking at me like that?\" he demanded.\n \"I didn\u0027t know about that,\" said Cody. \"Why did you follow him?\"\n Peter snorted. \"Why do you think? He was in our territory. I was seeing if he was really just on vacation like he claimed. I had to make sure he wasn\u0027t out hunting victims.\"\n I grew so complacent sometimes with the idea of my silly, laid-back friends that it was easy to forget their true natures. Peter and Cody were the most deceptive of all sometimes. They were goofy and absurd in most of their normal living, but at the end of the day, they were vampires.\n \"And?\" asked Roman, getting that zealous look again. \"Did you see him in Lake City?\"\n \"No. I followed him once to the Eastside and once to West Seattle.\"\n A chill ran down my spine. \"West Seattle? What was he doing there?\"\n \"Nothing,\" said Peter. \"He drove though some neighborhoods, sat in his car for a while. I figured he was stalking prey but saw me and gave up. Which he was smart to do.\"\n \"He might very well have been stalking prey,\" I murmured. \"Erik lived in West Seattle. Do you remember the neighborhood?\"\n \"If I saw it, maybe,\" said Peter. \"But I couldn\u0027t lead you back there. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" said Roman. \"This is all we need. This is enough proof.\"\n \"It\u0027s circumstantial at best,\" argued Hugh. \"Which I told Georgina initially. And it doesn\u0027t explain why Hell would want him killed - especially after he helped Jerome. I know, I know.\" Both Roman and I had started to protest, and Hugh held up a silencing hand. \"The contract. But remember, Kristin checked it for you. She said there was nothing wrong with your contract.\"\n Kristin was an imp who worked in Vancouver. I\u0027d done her a favor, and in return, she\u0027d dared to look in Hell\u0027s archives and review my contract for me, back when I\u0027d clung to the hope that there might be an error. The imp who\u0027d brokered my contract, Niphon, had been in town behaving suspiciously, and I\u0027d been certain we\u0027d learn that the contract was faulty. Kristin had come back with disappointing news: everything was in order.\n \"Erik said it wasn\u0027t mine that was the problem, though. He said it was a different one,\" I said.\n \"What other contract? And how is this connected to your transfer?\" asked Hugh. When none of us had an answer, he sighed. \"Look, sweetie. I\u0027m as much for a good caper as any of you, but not at the expense of being stupid.\" He glared at Roman. \"You\u0027ve been around for a while, I\u0027ll give you credit for that, but you haven\u0027t lived our lives. You haven\u0027t had to answer to the system. We do. Don\u0027t fuck things up for her with some far-fetched, crazy-ass theory.\"\n \"What if it\u0027s more than a theory?\" asked Roman. \"What if it\u0027s true?\"\n Hugh met his gaze squarely. \"Then make damned sure uncovering it is worth the consequences.\"\n Silence fell over us. At long last, Cody said, \"How much do you think Jerome scared that waitress? Because I could really use a drink.\"\n Roman resumed his coaching, but a weird mood had descended upon us in the wake of the Milton and Erik revelation. We went through the motions, but it was clear no one\u0027s heart was really in bowling. When we finally called it a night, Roman declared that we\u0027d all improved but were still in need of more practice. Since that wasn\u0027t a mystery to any of us, we set up a schedule for the rest of the week before dispersing. Roman caught a hold of my arm as I was walking out.\n \"I won\u0027t be home tonight,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got some . . . things to do.\"\n \"Things that are going to get you in trouble?\" I asked warily.\n \"No more than I already am. Just figured I\u0027d let you know in case . . .\" He glanced at Seth, then me. \"You know, just in case you wanted to know.\"\n \"Thanks,\" I said. Taking the hint, I turned to Seth once we were alone in the parking lot. \"What do you think? Do you want to come have a sleepover? Or do you have to go back to Terry\u0027s?\"\n Seth put his hands around my waist and drew me close. \"Actually, I have the night off. Andrea was having a good day today.\"\n I remembered yesterday, how, despite her fatigue, it had been clear she\u0027d significantly improved. I felt a flutter of hope in my chest and rejoiced at finally having something that was clear-cut and good in the world for a change. \"Do you think she\u0027s really healing? That the treatment\u0027s working?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said wistfully. \"I\u0027d like to believe it. It would be . . . amazing. More than I could hope for.\"\n My heart ached for him and for the whole family. I didn\u0027t know what to say, so I simply brushed a light kiss across his lips. They were warm in the chill air.\n \"Georgina,\" he said, when I\u0027d pulled back. \"All this other stuff . . . about your contract and the transfer. This is the first I\u0027m hearing about it.\"\n \"I know,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sorry. I wasn\u0027t trying to keep anything from you. It\u0027s just . . . so much is still unknown. I didn\u0027t want to bring it up when I don\u0027t even fully understand what\u0027s happening.\"\n \"And I understand even less than you,\" said Seth.\n I nodded. \"I didn\u0027t want you to worry.\"\n He gazed down at me, eyes honest and full of affection. \"You have to stop that. I\u0027m not going to break. You can always talk to me about anything. We won\u0027t get anywhere without things being open between us. We\u0027re in this together, Thetis. What happens to you affects me. I want to be there for you.\"\n \"I know,\" I said. \"It\u0027s a hard habit to break . . . wanting to protect you.\"\n \"One thing struck me . . . what Hugh said. Are you doing something dangerous? He\u0027s right about Roman, isn\u0027t he? That Roman doesn\u0027t face the same consequences as the rest of you? I hate the thought . . . I hate the thought of you getting caught up in one of his schemes, that you might suffer for his rash actions.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure they\u0027re so rash,\" I said. \"At first, I did. But now, I think he really might be onto something. About Erik. About my transfer.\"\n \"And if he is? What is there for you to gain? I mean, from what I know about Roman and nephilim, it\u0027ll be enough for him if he can catch Hell in a cover-up. That\u0027s what he gets his kicks from. But you . . . you answer to Hell. What do you get for uncovering some grand plan of theirs? Unhappy employers.\"\n I leaned against his chest, staring off into the night. The sky was clear, but we were too close to downtown to see much in the way of stars.\n \"I get the truth,\" I said at last. \"I don\u0027t know how my transfer plays into Erik\u0027s death - or if it even does - but if it\u0027s true that Erik wasn\u0027t killed by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, then yeah. I need to know that. I need to know the truth.\"\n \"It\u0027s worth it?\" He squeezed me tight. \"Worth the risk to yourself?\"\n \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"It\u0027s worth it.\"\n Yet, even as I spoke, I thought of Erik - kind and wise Erik who did so much for others, with little regard for himself. Generous, wonderful Erik who had done so much for me and possibly lost his life for it. Finding out the truth of that, what he\u0027d died for . . . yes, I\u0027d meant what I said. It was worth any risk to me, but that didn\u0027t negate the terribleness of it all. It couldn\u0027t change what had happened to Erik. He was still dead, and the intrigue around us was only growing thicker and thicker.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Seth. Without even thinking about it, I\u0027d closed my eyes and buried my face closer to his chest, perhaps in some subconscious effort to hide from the storm I felt was brewing around me and my immortal world.\n I opened my eyes and sighed. \"Nothing. Everything. I don\u0027t . . . I don\u0027t want to think about any of it. At least for a little while. Tomorrow . . . this is all going to be waiting, I know. But please . . .\" I pressed myself even closer to him, keeping my lips only a couple inches away. \"Let\u0027s go home. Help me to forget about this . . . just for tonight.\"\n Seth didn\u0027t need to be told twice. His lips found mine, and we locked in a kiss that was both hungry and desperate. Heat and electricity coursed through me, making me oblivious to the winter night. When we broke away, both breathless, I just barely managed to say, \"Meet you at my place.\"\n We each headed off for our own cars, which was a good thing since we probably would have been hazardous together if attempting to drive home in the same vehicle. As it was, I was kind of amazed at my ability to get back to my condo on Alki Beach without breaking any traffic laws. But once we reached my place, pulling into the lot at almost the same moment, that was it. We were all over each other and just barely had the sense to make it through my door before letting go completely.\n I\u0027d tried to put up a good front about resisting sex, but the truth was, I\u0027d missed it as badly as Seth. All the flings in the world couldn\u0027t make up for not doing it with him, the one I loved. My succubus duties were becoming even emptier and more hollow than usual. I still believed rationing our sex life was the smart and safe thing to do, but right now, I was willing to bend the rules.\n He swept me into his arms as soon as we stepped inside my condo, still managing to kiss me at the same time. The cats, normally ready to pounce with love on anyone who came through the door, had enough sense to give us our space as we stumbled back toward the bedroom. Seth lost his balance while carrying me and only barely managed to make it to my bed when he stumbled, depositing us both in an unceremonious heap.\n Had it really only been a month? As my mouth tasted his and my hands grew reacquainted with his body, I couldn\u0027t help but think it felt more like years. I\u0027d been in a drought. I\u0027d been starving for him. I couldn\u0027t get his T-shirt off fast enough and luxuriated in the feel of his bare skin under my fingertips. Seth was busy working on my shirt, which was a little difficult. The Unholy Rollers shirt didn\u0027t go over my head so well, meaning each button had to be undone individually. He did it with infinite patience and skill, soon making quick work of the shirt underneath.\n Once I was stripped, he gazed at me with the same longing and hunger I felt for him. He ran his hands over the length of my body, reverently tracing the curve of my hips and breasts. \"So beautiful,\" he murmured, drawing me on top of him. He then stretched back and shifted so that my breasts hung over his face, allowing him to take one of my nipples into his mouth. I gasped, not just because of the touch of his tongue - which was exquisite - but because it was Seth.\n His lips and tongue teased my nipple until it was aching and tender. Then, he switched breasts, giving my other nipple the same adoration. Fire flared through me again, along with the silvery sweet high of his life energy. With it came his feelings - his love and passion for me - and the combination of it all was intoxicating. I cried out softly, and he slid me down so that our mouths could meet again, this time in a kiss so deep and crushing, it made the parking lot seem chaste.\n As we kissed, I felt him slide a hand down the side of my body, moving toward my inner thighs. His fingers moved deftly as they explored me, slowly moving farther and farther until they slid inside of me. I exclaimed again, but the cry was swallowed in the kiss, which was so deep I felt as though I could hardly breathe. Patiently, those fingers danced around, testing me until he found the place that got the biggest reaction. Starting slowly, he stroked me over and over, playing with how wet I was, while intense pleasure lit all my nerve endings. I could easily put off my own climax as long as I needed, but there was no need tonight. I wanted to lose myself in him and let my body do whatever it wanted. What it wanted, as it turned out, was to come quickly. Seth and I had been apart too long, and my body has missed his touch.\n A few more skillful touches, and I felt my lower body explode with bliss, the sensation so overwhelming that I wasn\u0027t certain I could handle being touched anymore . . . even though I craved it. Seth continued teasing me until my orgasm finally subsided, and only then did he remove his fingers. He finally broke the kiss too, and we both gasped for breath, our eyes locked on each other.\n \"Come here,\" I said, pulling him back toward me. Like me, Seth could\u0027ve easily dragged out more foreplay . . . and like me, he didn\u0027t want to. I guess this was the cost of \"rationing.\" It didn\u0027t leave much room for patience.\n His body pressed against mine, and I felt him push inside me, hard and ready. I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him again as he began to thrust in and out of me. I wanted as much of him as I could get, wanted to make contact with as much of his body as I could. As we made love, though, I had the same sense I always did: even with him in me, pushing as hard as he could, he would never be close enough to me. I always wanted more of him. Our bodies were meant to be together, I decided. There was something so wonderfully, agonizingly right about the feel of him inside of me.\n \"Georgina,\" he gasped, as his motions grew faster and more intense. \"You\u0027re amazing. Beyond amazing. . . .\"\n If any more sentiments were there, I never found out. His face transformed as his orgasm seized him, his body surging forward into mine with a new intensity. He let out a soft groan as he came, still thrusting as he took every last bit of pleasure that he could. And as he came, I felt the full surge of his stolen life force. It was glorious and heady, and I tried to accept it as part of the rest of the experience. I didn\u0027t want to ruin this moment with guilt.\n When Seth\u0027s body finally slowed, he collapsed onto me, resting his head on my chest. He exhaled heavily and planted a kiss between my breasts. \"Did I mention that you\u0027re amazing ?\" he asked.\n I sighed contentedly and ran my hand through his hair, which was now even more messed up than usual. \"Not that amazing,\" I remarked. \"I feel like you did all the work.\"\n He kissed me again. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s great about you, Thetis. You don\u0027t even know when you\u0027re being amazing.\"\n I felt a smile creeping over my face, and it had nothing to do with the compliments. Georgina. Thetis. The old, familiar nicknames. After the last time we\u0027d had sex, some frightened part of me had worried I was in for a repeat and that he\u0027d call me Letha again. But, no. That memory, that name . . . they were all gone, just like the person I used to be.\n \"I love you,\" I said, because it seemed the only adequate response.\n \"Mmm.\" He snuggled closer. \"Let\u0027s not wait so long next time, okay?\"\n I laughed softly. \"We\u0027re going to wait even longer. I don\u0027t think monthly sex is going to work if we ration for a lifetime. It\u0027s still too frequent.\"\n He groaned. \"Come on. I don\u0027t mind the risks. It\u0027s worth it. I could be content with biweekly sex. Tonight was proof you can\u0027t hold out very long either.\"\n \"Biweekly! That\u0027s definitely too frequent. You only got it tonight because I suddenly had a moment of crisis.\"\n He chuckled, though it was soon lost in a yawn. \"If I got sex every time you had \u0027a moment of crisis,\u0027 then I\u0027d probably be getting it every night.\"\n I gently elbowed him. \"That\u0027s not true.\" I thought about it. \"Much.\"\n He laughed again and wrapped his arms around me, keeping us close. \"Oh, Georgina. You make everything we go through worthwhile. Everything.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-revealed-georgina-kincaid-6/page-10.html","bookId":2059,"book":{"id":2059,"title":"Succubus Revealed (Georgina Kincaid #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 6: Succubus Revealed \n After everyone finds out about Georgina\u0027s phase with Seth during his and Maddie\u0027s engagement, things degenerate at Georgina\u0027s workplace and she quits.
