{"id":110460,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"It wasn\u0027t until I landed in Seattle on Sunday evening that the full surreal nature of my weekend in Las Vegas hit me. Being there had felt so . . . natural. I suppose part of that was just having old friends like Bastien and Luis around. Yet I\u0027d been pleasantly surprised at how easily I got along with my newer acquaintances, like Phoebe and Matthias. I\u0027d even grown to like Jamie, though I never did see him after that night. Despite my efforts to find him and ask him about Milton, the imp had remained elusive for the rest of my trip.\\n\\n And the show . . . how had that happened? I couldn\u0027t even get a solid job here in my current hometown, yet hours after walking off the plane in a strange city, I\u0027d landed what was, in many ways, my dream job. By the time we\u0027d finished our second practice, Matthias was already talking about a special part he planned on creating for me, and several of the other dancers were so disappointed at me leaving for a month, you\u0027d think we\u0027d known each other for years.\\n\\n It had, in spite of my misgivings, been a fantastic weekend.\\n\\n Reality set in when I walked into my condo. Roman was out, with only a note reading Bowling practice tomorrow night to mark his passage. Naturally, the cats were as happy to see me as always. Scratching their heads in turn, I began to think about the logistics of moving both of them with me across state lines. I\u0027d be taking them away from Roman, whom they loved, but there was nothing to be done for that. He couldn\u0027t come with us. As a nephilim, he was in constant danger of being hunted down by other immortals, and it was only Jerome\u0027s protection that allowed him to have a seminormal life in Seattle. Roman certainly wasn\u0027t going to give that up, and besides, Las Vegas was probably the worst place in the world for him to attempt to hide out.\\n\\n A vase of pink-tipped white roses sat on the kitchen table, filling the air with sweetness. I opened up the card and read Seth\u0027s scrawled writing:\\n\\n Welcome home. I\u0027ve been counting the minutes.\\n\\n - S\\n\\n I texted him that I was back and received an answer urging me to come over to Terry and Andrea\u0027s for dinner. After leaving a note for Roman assuring him I\u0027d be at practice, I headed out, my mind still spinning with more of the consequences of moving. The condo. I\u0027d have to sell it. Unless I wanted to rent it to Roman? Hell would likely compensate any moving costs, but it\u0027d be up to me to start making the actual arrangements now for things like movers and whatnot.\\n\\n I was good at making plans and organizing things, but all of my skills were useless against the one thing I wanted to bring with me to Las Vegas the most: Seth. I still had no solution for what to do with him.\\n\\n I was met with the usual outpouring of love from his nieces when I arrived, just in time for a chaotic family dinner. With the additional family members, they\u0027d given up any pretense of eating at the kitchen table and had simply taken their paper plates and homemade pizza off to the living room. The casualties of food and furniture were ones Terry and Andrea were long since used to, but Margaret couldn\u0027t focus on her dinner for fear of constantly watching the girls and what she perceived as imminent tomato-stained disaster.\\n\\n I was happy to see Andrea out with the family, which wasn\u0027t something that happened very often lately. She looked tired but was in good spirits, and from the way the girls vied for position next to her, it was clear they were delighted to have her up and around too.\\n\\n \"Seth says you were out of town,\" she told me. \"Anywhere fun?\"\\n\\n \"Las Vegas,\" I replied. \"Visiting friends.\"\\n\\n \"Man,\" said Ian. \"I wish I had friends in Las Vegas.\"\\n\\n \"I figured it\u0027d be too commercial for you,\" said Seth, deadpan.\\n\\n Ian swallowed a bite of his pizza - it apparently wasn\u0027t a vegan day - before responding. \"Only if you stay on the Strip and their overpriced luxury hotels. If you poke around in some of the out-of-the-way places, you could find some really cool and obscure dives.\"\\n\\n It took nine-year-old Kendall to say what the rest of us were thinking. \"I\u0027d rather stay in luxury. Why would you want to stay in a dive, Uncle Ian?\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s nonmainstream,\" he told her. \"Everyone stays at the nice places.\"\\n\\n \"But I like nice things,\" she argued. \"Don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Well, yes,\" he said, frowning. \"But that\u0027s not the point - \"\\n\\n \"Then why would you want to stay at bad places?\" she pressed.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re too young to understand,\" he said.\\n\\n Seth chuckled. \"Actually, I think she understands perfectly.\"\\n\\n Andrea decided to rest shortly after that, but not before extracting a promise that someone deliver her dessert later on. After doing dishes (which was pretty easy with paper plates), our group dispersed into separate activities. Kendall, Brandy, Margaret, and Terry started up a game of Monopoly while Kayla and the twins settled down to watch The Little Mermaid. Ian joined them, excited for the chance to show how the movie was an example of capitalism destroying America. Seth and I curled up on a nearby loveseat, ostensibly to watch the movie, but instead used the time to catch up.\\n\\n \"How was it, really?\" he asked me in a low voice. \"I\u0027ve been worried about you. Was it as bad as you thought?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said, leaning my head against his chest. \"It was actually . . . pretty good. Would you believe I have a job already ? Like . . . one that\u0027s not on Hell\u0027s payroll.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t even get one of those here,\" remarked Seth.\\n\\n \"Yeah, the irony\u0027s not lost on me. I\u0027m going to be a Vegas showgirl, complete with sequins.\"\\n\\n Seth trailed his fingers through my hair. \"That\u0027s actually kind of awesome. And hot. If you want to practice, I\u0027d be more than happy to give you some constructive criticism.\"\\n\\n I smiled. \"We\u0027ll see.\"\\n\\n There was a long pause. \"So . . . it\u0027s real. This whole thing.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said in a small voice. \"It\u0027s real.\" I felt him tense and sensed the worry radiating off of him. \"It\u0027s okay. We\u0027ll figure this out. It\u0027s still a month away.\"\\n\\n \"I know we will,\" he said. \"You and I have overcome crazier things than this, right?\"\\n\\n \"Crazier doesn\u0027t always mean harder,\" I pointed out. \"I mean, when Peter tried to make a \u0027retro candle sconce\u0027 out of a Pringles can last month, that was pretty crazy - but it was also pretty easy to deal with once we found his fire extinguisher.\"\\n\\n \"You see?\" said Seth. \"This is what I love about you. I don\u0027t even consider that crazy. I consider that ordinary life with you, Georgina. You change all the definitions.\"\\n\\n He pressed a kiss to my forehead. We fell silent and watched the movie, though I suspected Seth was paying as little attention as I was. We were both lost in our own thoughts, and I didn\u0027t really snap out of it until I heard Ian telling Morgan, \"I like the original fairy tale better. It\u0027s pretty alternative, so you\u0027ve probably never heard of it.\"\\n\\n I glanced at the clock and sat up. \"I\u0027m going to go check on Andrea and see if she wants her dessert.\" Both Margaret and Terry were quick to offer to do it instead, but I waved them off, assuring them I was fine and that they should return to their game.\\n\\n Andrea was awake, propped up on pillows and reading a book when I came in with the pie. \"You didn\u0027t have to do that,\" she told me. \"You should\u0027ve asked Terry.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s busy buying and selling property,\" I told her, helping her settle the plate on her lap. \"I couldn\u0027t ask him to interrupt that. Besides, he does plenty.\"\\n\\n \"He does,\" she agreed, smiling wistfully. \"They all do. Even you. It\u0027s so strange, having others take care of me. I\u0027m too used to looking after everyone else.\"\\n\\n I settled down on a chair near her bed, wondering how often it must be filled lately. Andrea always had someone watching over her. \"It\u0027s just for a little while longer,\" I said.\\n\\n That got me another smile as she chewed a bite of pie. \"You\u0027re very optimistic.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, why shouldn\u0027t I be? You look great today.\"\\n\\n \"Great \u0027ironically,\u0027 as Ian would say.\" She ran a hand through her limp blond hair. \"But I do feel better than I have for a while. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s deceptive, Georgina. There are days I feel confident I\u0027ve beat every cancer cell in my body and others when I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m still managing to walk this earth.\"\\n\\n \"Andrea - \"\\n\\n \"No, no, it\u0027s true.\" She paused for more pie, but her eyes took on a vast, knowing look that reminded me eerily of Carter. \"I\u0027ve accepted it, come to terms with the fact that there\u0027s still a good chance I\u0027ll die. No one else has. No one else will talk about it. I\u0027m okay with that. If that\u0027s what God wills for me, then so be it.\"\\n\\n I felt a knot clench in my stomach. I couldn\u0027t say much about God, but I\u0027d seen enough of Heaven and Hell to get angry when I heard humans accept their fate as part of some higher purpose. Half the time, it seemed to me the divine powers were making up this game as they went along.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not worried about me,\" Andrea continued. \"But I am worried about them.\" That serenity faded, replaced by very real human concern, a mother\u0027s fear for her children. \"Terry\u0027s strong. So wonderfully strong. But this is hard on him. He can\u0027t do it alone, which is why I\u0027m so glad Seth\u0027s here. I don\u0027t know what we would have done without him. He\u0027s the rock supporting us all right now.\"\\n\\n The anxiety inside me eased for a few moments, replaced by a spreading warmth as I thought about Seth. \"He\u0027s wonderful.\"\\n\\n Andrea set down the fork, finished, and extended her hand to me. \"So are you. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re part of our family, Georgina. If something happens to me - \"\\n\\n \"Stop - \"\\n\\n \"No, listen. I mean it. If something happens to me, I\u0027ll rest easy knowing the girls have you in their lives. Seth and Terry are great, but the girls still need a strong woman role model. Someone to help them through growing up.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not that good of a role model,\" I said, not meeting her eyes. I was a creature of Hell, someone full of weakness and fear. What could I possibly have to offer such bright, promise-filled creatures like the Mortensen girls?\\n\\n \"You are,\" said Andrea adamantly, squeezing my hand. \"They love you and admire you so much. I know they\u0027re in good hands.\"\\n\\n I swallowed back tears that were threatening to overwhelm me. \"Well,\" I said. \"They\u0027re in even better hands with you, since we all know you\u0027re going to get well soon.\"\\n\\n Andrea nodded, giving me an indulgent smile that I suspected she\u0027d perfected after weeks of listening to others insist she was on the verge of recovery. A yawn soon betrayed her, and I carefully took the plate away and asked if she needed anything else. She assured me she didn\u0027t.\\n\\n I crept back downstairs and returned the plate to the kitchen, where I found Brandy and Margaret eating pie of their own. I did a double take back toward the living room. \"What happened to Monopoly?\"\\n\\n \"Kendall bought us out,\" said Margaret.\\n\\n \"Man, I hate playing with her,\" grumbled Brandy. \"No one her age should be that good.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t knock it,\" said Seth, strolling in. \"She\u0027s going to be supporting us all in fifteen years.\" He rested a hand on Brandy\u0027s shoulder. \"Did you ask Georgina?\"\\n\\n Brandy looked at her feet. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Ask me what?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nothing,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Clearly it\u0027s something,\" I replied, exchanging looks with Seth. \"What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"Is this the Christmas dance you were talking about before ?\" asked Margaret.\\n\\n Brandy flushed. \"A holiday dance. It\u0027s nothing.\"\\n\\n \"No way,\" I said. \"I\u0027m a big fan of dances. But isn\u0027t school out?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but this is at church. It\u0027s a formal they have every year.\" She was using a It\u0027s no big deal tone, but her expression betrayed how interested she was.\\n\\n The church part surprised me, since last I knew, the Mortensens didn\u0027t attend one. But obviously that had changed. Maybe Andrea\u0027s illness had played a role. Whatever it was, I could see faith wasn\u0027t on the line here, so much as a teenage girl\u0027s simple desire to participate in something fun with other people her age. It was a normal rite of passage, one I was guessing she didn\u0027t feel worthy of, in light of everything else going on right now with her family. No wonder she was hesitant to mention it. I wondered if maybe there was a boy involved too but certainly wasn\u0027t going to ask. She looked mortified enough to be having this discussion in front of her uncle and grandmother.\\n\\n \"You need to shop for a dress?\" I guessed. People always called me for shopping. I used to be bothered by that but then figured I should accept what I\u0027m good at. Brandy nodded, still looking embarrassed. \"When is it?\"\\n\\n \"Tuesday.\"\\n\\n \"Tuesday . . .\" I frowned, thinking of my schedule. Tomorrow, Monday, was taken up with work and bowling practice. That didn\u0027t leave a lot of time. \"We might be cutting it close.\"\\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t have time, it\u0027s fine,\" Brandy assured me. \"Really.\"\\n\\n \"No way,\" I told her. \"We can do it Tuesday morning.\"\\n\\n Brandy looked down again. \"My dad can pay you back.... I\u0027ll ask him how much we can spend.\"\\n\\n \"Forget it,\" said Seth, rustling her hair. She squirmed out of his reach. \"Send the bill to me. You know where I live.\"\\n\\n Brandy protested this, but Seth was firm in his offer - as well as his urging that Brandy not mention it to her father. But once Brandy and Seth were in the other room, Margaret caught hold of my sleeve and pulled me back into the kitchen before I could follow. Our interactions hadn\u0027t exactly been antagonistic (aside from our initial meeting with the baseball bat), but they hadn\u0027t always been pleasant either. I braced myself for some admonishment about dressing Brandy like a whore.\\n\\n \"Here,\" said Margaret, shoving some cash into my hands. I looked down and found two fifty-dollar bills. \"Seth\u0027s not the only with income around here. He can\u0027t keep funding the whole family. Is that enough for what she needs?\"\\n\\n \"Er, yes,\" I said, trying to hand it back. I\u0027d actually planned on cutting Seth out as well and carrying the bill myself. \"Definitely. You don\u0027t have to do this.\"\\n\\n Margaret\u0027s response was to give me another bill. \"Get her shoes too.\" She closed my hand around the cash. \"I don\u0027t know what girls her age need when it comes to clothes, but I know you do. The money I can provide. The rest I rely on you for.\"\\n\\n That sentiment - that faith in me - was too much, too fast on the heels of the conversation I\u0027d just had with Andrea. \"It\u0027s not enough,\" I blurted out. \"What I\u0027m doing, compared to everyone else. They\u0027re all giving so much. What\u0027s a shopping trip next to that?\"\\n\\n Margaret fixed me with a piercing gaze that bore no resemblance to the conservative, sweatshirt-wearing matron I\u0027d categorized her as. \"For a girl growing up too fast, whose life is crumbling around her? Everything.\"\\n\\n \"I hate this,\" I said. \"I hate that this is happening to them.\"\\n\\n \"God only gives us what we have the strength to endure,\" she said. I\u0027d always hated that saying, largely because it too seemed to go along with the idea of a universe having a plan for everyone, something I\u0027d seen no evidence of. \"They have the strength to get through this. And they have our strength to help them.\"\\n\\n I smiled at that. \"You\u0027re a remarkable woman, Margaret. They\u0027re lucky you\u0027re here.\" I meant it. She and I might have different philosophies about premarital sex, but her love for them was undiminished. I wasn\u0027t the only role model in the girls\u0027 lives.\\n\\n She shrugged, looking both flattered and embarrassed by my praise. \"Like you, I\u0027m just trying to do enough - without wearing out my welcome at Seth\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"He loves having you,\" I said promptly.\\n\\n She rolled her eyes. \"I\u0027m not stupid. I want to keep helping, but I know I can\u0027t stay with him forever. He\u0027s a grown man, no matter how much I\u0027d like to pretend otherwise.\"\\n\\n That made me smile even more. \"Don\u0027t worry. I won\u0027t tell him you said so.\"\\n\\n Nonetheless, I went home with a heavy heart that night. Seth expected to be up late and hadn\u0027t wanted me waiting around for him. We were both conscious of how little time we\u0027d had together recently, though, so he told me he\u0027d join me for tomorrow night\u0027s bowling practice. As a general rule, he tried to avoid immortal goings-on, but I think he had a morbid fascination with the idea of bowling for Hellish honor.\\n\\n \"Thank God,\" said Roman, when I walked in the door. \"I thought you were going to stay at Seth\u0027s. There\u0027s soup on the stove.\"\\n\\n \"No, thanks,\" I said. \"I already ate.\"\\n\\n \"Your loss,\" he said. Judging from the way the cats were circling him for handouts as he settled down on the couch with a bowl, I guess they agreed with him. \"How was it?\"\\n\\n My mind was still on the Mortensens, and for a moment, I thought that\u0027s what he meant. Then I remembered his single-minded focus and knew he was referring to Las Vegas.\\n\\n \"Surprisingly good,\" I told him, sitting down in an armchair.\\n\\n His eyebrows rose. He hadn\u0027t expected that answer. \"Oh? Tell me about it.\"\\n\\n I did, and he listened attentively while eating his soup. When I\u0027d finished the weekend\u0027s recap, he grilled me on nearly everyone I\u0027d met there, immortal and mortal alike. In two days, I didn\u0027t have that much life history to report but gave him what I could.\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, \"isn\u0027t that lovely.\" He made no effort to hide his sarcasm.\\n\\n I sighed. \"You still think this was part of some greater conspiracy ?\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s terribly convenient that this seemingly routine transfer is fulfilling every possible wish you might have.\"\\n\\n I scoffed. \"Aside from the fact that I\u0027m being transferred in the first place. That\u0027s hardly something I wanted.\"\\n\\n Roman straightened up, and the cats ran for his abandoned bowl. He ticked off points on his right hand. \"Well, let\u0027s do a tally, shall we? When I first met you, I asked what your dream job would be. What did you say? A Vegas dancer. And wow! Look what conveniently falls into your lap. And who put it there? In a city full of conniving, backstabbing succubi, you were fortunate to find one as levelheaded as you, complete with the same sense of humor and interests. Funny thing . . . did you even run into any other succubi that entire weekend? In a city packed with them?\"\\n\\n \"Roman - \"\\n\\n \"No, no, wait. There\u0027s more. How\u0027d you meet this wonder succubus anyway? Through your closest immortal friend, who just happened to have been coincidentally transferred to Las Vegas, hired on by your favorite boss of all time. Are you following this fantasy so far?\"\\n\\n \"But why would - \"\\n\\n \"And,\" he continued, \"lest you grow homesick for the wacky idiosyncrasies of your friends back here, Vegas is ready to supply you with new ones. A zany drunken imp. Seth 2.0. If you\u0027d stayed longer, they probably would have unearthed an angel and a couple of vampires for you. And let\u0027s not discount the fact that you\u0027re going to Las Vegas in the first place! The single easiest place for a succubus to get by.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, I get what you\u0027re saying.\" I threw up my hands in exasperation. \"It is perfect. Maybe too perfect. But you\u0027re missing one fundamental point. Supposing this is true, that someone has set up the most perfect scenario for me ever, a situation designed to keep me happy, why would they do it at all when the thing that would make me the most happy is to stay in Seattle? Why bother with this alternative? Why not leave me as I am?\"\\n\\n Roman\u0027s eyes gleamed. \"Because that\u0027s the one thing they don\u0027t want you to have. They want you out of Seattle, Georgina. They want you out, and they don\u0027t want you to complain or look back.\"\\n\\n \"But why?\" I protested. \"That\u0027s what I can\u0027t figure out.\"\\n\\n \"Give me something else to work with,\" he said. \"Hell\u0027s not that good. Even the most picture perfect setup has to have a flaw. Was there anything, anything at all this weekend, that felt disingenuous? That smacked of a lie?\"\\n\\n I gave him a wry look. \"I was in Las Vegas, hanging out with servants of Hell. Everything was disingenuous.\"\\n\\n \"Georgina, think! Anything that seemed legitimately odd. Any contradiction.\"\\n\\n I started to deny it but then paused. \"The timeline.\"\\n\\n He leaned forward even more. \"Yes? What about it?\"\\n\\n I thought back to my first hours in Las Vegas. \"Luis and Bastien both went out of their way to act as though my transfer and Bastien\u0027s had been in the works for a while - like Jerome said. But once, Bastien slipped. He sounded like he hadn\u0027t been there for very long at all - not nearly as long as they\u0027d said before.\"\\n\\n \"Like that maybe he was suddenly pulled in on a moment\u0027s notice - to coincide with your transfer?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, not liking the thought of Bastien being part of some potential conspiracy centered around me. \"He corrected himself, said he misspoke.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he would say that.\" Roman leaned back now, letting all of this sink in.\\n\\n \"Bastien wouldn\u0027t lie to me,\" I snapped. \"He\u0027s my friend. I trust him. He cares about me.\"\\n\\n \"I believe you,\" said Roman. \"And I believe that he wouldn\u0027t lie to you about something that he thought might harm you. But if his higher-ups asked him to tell a white lie - fudge a few days here and there - don\u0027t you think he would?\"\\n\\n I nearly denied it - but then had to wonder. Bastien had been in trouble off and on with our superiors, his Seattle venture last year a desperate attempt to restore status. If he were pressured enough - threatened, even - to tell me he\u0027d been transferred longer than he actually had, would he? Especially if he thought it was harmless and knew of no nefarious reason behind it?\\n\\n \"But what nefarious reason would be behind all this?\" I muttered, not realizing I\u0027d spoken my thoughts aloud until Roman straightened up again.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what we have to figure out. We have to figure out what\u0027s happened to you that would\u0027ve gotten someone\u0027s attention - and that happened recently, to spur such a fast response. We know about your slacker record. And we know about Erik looking into your contract.\"\\n\\n I blinked. \"Milton.\"\\n\\n I quickly told Roman about Hugh\u0027s information, about Milton\u0027s secret assassin status and trip to Seattle lining up with Erik\u0027s death. I also told him about briefly mentioning Milton to Jamie. Roman leaped to his feet.\\n\\n \"Jesus Christ! Why didn\u0027t you tell me about this sooner? I could\u0027ve investigated Milton while you were gone. Shit. Now I\u0027m trapped here under bowling duty.\" Nephilim had the same travel limitations as lesser immortals. They had to physically travel to places. No teleportation like greater immortals.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"I wasn\u0027t thinking. I didn\u0027t connect it. And I didn\u0027t get a chance to ask Jamie more about Milton. He wasn\u0027t around the rest of the time I was in town.\"\\n\\n Roman was nodding along with me as he paced. \"Of course he wasn\u0027t. I\u0027m sure they made certain he was unavailable before he could tell you any more. And explain again why your initial conversation with him didn\u0027t go that far?\"\\n\\n I shrugged. \"He was drunk. He got distracted by a debate over gin with Luis.\"\\n\\n \"One that Luis initiated, no doubt.\"\\n\\n \"I - \" I thought about it. \"Yeah. I guess he did. But you\u0027re not saying . . . I mean, that\u0027s idiotic. Using gin as a distraction to cover up some plot?\"\\n\\n Roman\u0027s sea green eyes were gazing off in the distance, thoughtful. \"It\u0027s not the most ridiculous distraction I\u0027ve known a demon to use. He could\u0027ve brought up bowling.\"\\n\\n \"Not that again.\"\\n\\n Roman snapped his attention back to me, frustration all over his face. \"Georgina, how can you be in denial about this? How can you refuse to believe that Hell is playing some larger game here? After all you\u0027ve seen and been a part of?\"\\n\\n I shot up, angry at the insinuation that had been creeping along here, that I was too oblivious to see what was going on. \"I know! I know they\u0027re capable of it. I know they can use means both ingenuous and simple - like gin and bowling - to get what they want. I\u0027m not denying that, Roman. What I just can\u0027t grasp yet is the why. Show me that, and I\u0027ll get on board with any crazy scheme you want. I need to know why.\"\\n\\n Roman came to stand in front of me, resting his hands on my shoulders as he leaned close. \"That is exactly what I intend to find out. And when we do, I have a feeling we\u0027ll have blown the lid off of the biggest conspiracy Hell\u0027s had in centuries.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-revealed-georgina-kincaid-6/page-9.html","bookId":2059,"book":{"id":2059,"title":"Succubus Revealed (Georgina Kincaid #6)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 6: Succubus Revealed \\n After everyone finds out about Georgina\u0027s phase with Seth during his and Maddie\u0027s engagement, things degenerate at Georgina\u0027s workplace and she quits.
