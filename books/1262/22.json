{"id":39505,"no":22,"title":"ANTIQUARIAN DISCUSSION.","content":"Clifford.—Why, this is the best story I have heard for many a day, for it has both salmon and salmon fishing in it. Author.—The secret is out now about the fairies and the peel-tower, and, for my own part, I shall never in future doubt the prévoyance and judgment of these good people. Aware, as they must have been, that fate had decreed the lands of Tullochcarron to be merged in those of Ballindalloch, and seeing that this coming event would render the commanding site of Ballindalloch’s proposed peel-tower utterly valueless, as he would no longer have any enemy’s territory to overlook, their regard for his interest induced them to drive him out of his fancy, and to compel him to descend into the delightful repose and shelter of the beautiful haugh below. Dominie.—’Pon my word, sir, there is much reason in that observe of yours. That is, always premeesing that the story I told had been a tale of reasonable and probable fack. Author.—But as you yourself remarked at the conclusion of it, Mr. Macpherson, the wild faery tale connected with the ancient foundations of the peel-tower may have some matter of truth wrapped up in it; and why may we not suppose then, that Ballindalloch, having commenced some small exploratory building there, had afterwards discontinued it when the prospect of his succession to the lands of Tullochcarron opened to him. Dominie.—Troth, I’m thinking you have guessed it sir,—that wull just be it. Grant.—The conjecture is at least as good as those of most antiquaries. Clifford.—It would certainly seem to have some foundation in the old site. Author.—If that was meant as a pun, Mr. Secretary, I think you should be immediately condemned to tell us a long story, in expiation of so grave an offence. [256] Clifford.—The first time, certainly, that I ever heard a pun called a grave offence; but, to bury all further controversy, I will tell you a legend which I learned when I was on a visit to some of my relations in Ross-shire; and since you think that my offence is so very heavy, I shall impose on myself a long penance, of which I pray the gods that you, my good auditors, may not suffer any share. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2815/77833.html","bookId":1262,"book":{"id":1262,"title":"Highland Legends","description":"简介： The scenery of the less cultivated parts of our native Scotland may, generally speaking, be said to be checkered, as human life is with its events; for as, during our pilgrimage here on earth, evil continually succeeds good, and good evil, so are bea...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2815","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:44 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:44 AM"}}
