{"id":8743,"no":40,"title":"CHAPTER XL — THE BANK ROBBER IS FOUND","content":"Tony Denton lost no time in going up to the city with the second bond he had extracted from the fears of Prince Duncan. He went directly to the office of his brokers, Gay \u0026 Sears, and announced that he was prepared to deposit additional margin. The bond was received, and taken to the partners in the back office. Some four minutes elapsed, and the clerk reappeared. \"Mr. Denton, will you step into the back office?\" he said. \"Certainly,\" answered Tony cheerfully. He found the two brokers within. \"This is Mr. Denton?\" said the senior partner. \"Yes, sir.\" \"You offer this bond as additional margin on the shares we hold in your name?\" \"Yes, of course.\" \"Mr. Denton,\" said Mr. Gay searchingly, \"where did you get this bond?\" \"Where did I get it?\" repeated Denton nervously. \"Why, I bought it.\" \"How long since?\" \"About a year.\" The two partners exchanged glances. \"Where do you live, Mr. Denton?\" \"In Groveton.\" \"Ahem! Mr. Sears, will you be kind enough to draw out the necessary papers?\" Tony Denton felt relieved. The trouble seemed to be over. Mr. Gay at the same time stepped into the main office and gave a direction to one of the clerks. Mr. Sears drew out a large sheet of foolscap, and began, in very deliberate fashion, to write. He kept on writing for some minutes. Tony Denton wondered why so much writing should be necessary in a transaction of this kind. Five minutes later a young man looked into the office, and said, addressing Mr. Gay. \"All right!\" Upon that Mr. Sears suspended writing. \"Mr. Denton,\" said Mr. Gay, \"are you aware that this bond which you have brought us was stolen from the Groveton Bank?\" \"I—don\u0027t—believe—it,\" gasped Denton, turning pale. \"The numbers of the stolen bonds have been sent to all the bankers and brokers in the city. This is one, and the one you brought us not long since is another. Do you persist in saying that you bought this bond a year ago?\" \"No, no!\" exclaimed Denton, terrified. \"Did you rob the bank?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t!\" ejaculated the terrified man, wiping the perspiration from his brow. \"Where, then, did you get the bonds?\" \"I got them both from Prince Duncan, president of the bank.\" Both partners looked surprised. One of them went to the door of the office, and called in Mr. Armstrong, who, as well as a policeman, had been sent for. Tony Denton\u0027s statement was repeated to him. \"I am not surprised,\" he said. \"I expected it.\" Tony Denton now made a clean breast of the whole affair, and his words were taken down. \"Are you willing to go to Groveton with me, and repeat this in presence of Mr. Duncan?\" asked Mr. Armstrong. \"Yes.\" \"Will you not have him arrested?\" asked Mr. Gay. \"No, he has every reason to keep faith with me.\" It was rather late in the day when Mr. Armstrong, accompanied by Tony Denton, made their appearance at the house of Prince Duncan. When the banker\u0027s eyes rested on the strangely assorted pair, his heart sank within him. He had a suspicion of what it meant. \"We have called on you, Mr. Duncan, on a matter of importance,\" said Mr. Armstrong. \"Very well,\" answered Duncan faintly. \"It is useless to mince matters. I have evidence outside of this man\u0027s to show that it was you who robbed the bank of which you are president, and appropriated to your own use the bonds which it contained.\" \"This is a strange charge to bring against a man in my position. Where is your proof?\" demanded Duncan, attempting to bluster. \"I have Mr. Denton\u0027s evidence that he obtained two thousand-dollar bonds of you.\" \"Very well, suppose I did sell him two such bonds?\" \"They were among the bonds stolen.\" \"It is not true. They were bonds I have had for five years.\" \"Your denial is useless. The numbers betray you.\" \"You did not have the numbers of the bonds.\" \"So you think, but I have obtained them from an old book-keeper of mine, now at the West. I sent a special messenger out to obtain the list from him. Would you like to know who the messenger was?\" \"Who was it?\" \"Luke Larkin.\" \"That boy!\" exclaimed Duncan bitterly. \"Yes, that boy supplied me with the necessary proof. And now, I have a word to say; I can send you to prison, but for the sake of your family I would prefer to spare you. But the bonds must be given up.\" \"I haven\u0027t them all in my possession.\" \"Then you must pay me the market price of those you have used. The last one given to this man is safe.\" \"It will reduce me to poverty,\" said Prince Duncan in great agitation. \"Nevertheless, it must be done!\" said Mr. Armstrong sternly. \"Moreover, you must resign your position as president of the bank, and on that condition you will be allowed to go free, and I will not expose you.\" Of course, Squire Duncan was compelled to accept these terms. He saved a small sum out of the wreck of his fortune, and with his family removed to the West, where they were obliged to adopt a very different style of living. Randolph is now an office boy at a salary of four dollars a week, and is no longer able to swagger and boast as he has done hitherto. Mr. Tomkins, Linton\u0027s father, was elected president of the Groveton Bank in place of Mr. Duncan, much to the satisfaction of Luke. Roland Reed, much to the surprise of Luke, revealed himself as a cousin of Mr. Larkin, who for twenty-five years had been lost sight of. He had changed his name, on account of some trouble into which he had been betrayed by Prince Duncan, and thus had not been recognized. \"You need be under no anxiety about Luke and his prospects,\" he said to Mrs. Larkin. \"I shall make over to him ten thousand dollars at once, constituting myself his guardian, and will see that he is well started in business. My friend Mr. Armstrong proposes to take him into his office, if you do not object, at a liberal salary.\" \"I shall miss him very much,\" said Mrs. Larkin, \"though I am thankful that he is to be so well provided for.\" \"He can come home every Saturday night, and stay until Monday morning,\" said Mr. Reed, who, by the way, chose to retain his name in place of his old one. \"Will that satisfy you?\" \"It ought to, surely, and I am grateful to Providence for all the blessings which it has showered upon me and mine.\" There was another change. Mr. Reed built a neat and commodious house in the pleasantest part of the village and there Mrs. Larkin removed with his little daughter, of whom she still had the charge. No one rejoiced more sincerely at Luke\u0027s good fortune than Linton, who throughout had been a true and faithful friend. He is at present visiting Europe with his mother, and has written an earnest letter, asking Luke to join him. But Luke feels that he cannot leave a good business position, and must postpone the pleasure of traveling till he is older. Mr. J. Madison Coleman, the enterprising drummer, has got into trouble, and is at present an inmate of the State penitentiary at Joliet, Illinois. It is fortunate for the traveling public, so many of whom he has swindled, that he is for a time placed where he can do no more mischief. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3006/83001.html","bookId":285,"book":{"id":285,"title":"Struggling Upward or Luke Larkin\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： One Saturday afternoon in January a lively and animated group of boys were gathered on the western side of a large pond in the village of Groveton.
