{"id":8706,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III — RANDOLPH GETS THE WATCH","content":"\"It is true,\" said the teacher, slowly. \"Randolph has won the race.\" Randolph\u0027s face lighted up with exultation. \"But it is also evident,\" continued Mr. Hooper, \"that he would not have succeeded but for the unfortunate collision between Luke Larkin and Tom Harper.\" Here some of Luke\u0027s friends brightened up. \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" said Randolph. \"At any rate, I came in first.\" \"I watched the race closely,\" said the teacher, \"and I have no doubt on the subject. Luke had so great a lead that he would surely have won the race.\" \"But he didn\u0027t,\" persisted Randolph, doggedly. \"He did not, as we all know. It is also clear that had he not stopped to ascertain the extent of Tom\u0027s injuries he still might have won.\" \"That\u0027s so!\" said half a dozen boys. \"Therefore I cannot accept the result as indicating the superiority of the successful contestant.\" \"I think I am entitled to the prize,\" said Randolph. \"I concede that; but, under the circumstances, I suggest to you that it would be graceful and proper to waive your claim and try the race over again.\" The boys applauded, with one or two exceptions. \"I won\u0027t consent to that, Mr. Hooper,\" said Randolph, frowning. \"I\u0027ve won the prize fairly and I want it.\" \"I am quite willing Randolph should have it, sir,\" said Luke. \"I think I should have won it if I had not stopped with Tom, but that doesn\u0027t affect the matter one way or the other. Randolph came in first, as he says, and I think he is entitled to the watch.\" \"Then,\" said Mr. Hooper, gravely, \"there is nothing more to be said. Randolph, come forward and receive the prize.\" Randolph obeyed with alacrity, and received the Waterbury watch from the hands of Mr. Hooper. The boys stood in silence and offered no congratulations. \"Now, let me say,\" said the teacher, \"that I cannot understand why there was any collision at all. Tom Harper, why did you get in Luke\u0027s way?\" \"Because I was a fool, sir,\" answered Tom, smarting from his injuries, and the evident indifference of Randolph, in whose cause he had incurred them. \"That doesn\u0027t answer my question. Why did you act like a fool, as you expressed it?\" \"I thought I could get out of the way in time,\" stammered Tom, who did not dare to tell the truth. \"You had no other reason?\" asked the teacher, searchingly. \"No, sir. What other reason could I have?\" said Tom, but his manner betrayed confusion. \"Indeed, I don\u0027t know,\" returned the teacher, quietly. \"Your action, however, spoiled Luke\u0027s chances and insured the success of Randolph.\" \"And got me a broken head,\" muttered Tom, placing his hand upon the swelling at the back of his head. \"Yes, you got the worst of it. I advise you to go home and apply cold water or any other remedy your mother may suggest.\" Randolph had already turned away, meaning to return home. Tom joined him. Randolph would gladly have dispensed with his company, but had no decent excuse, as Tom\u0027s home lay in the same direction as his. \"Well, Randolph, you\u0027ve won the watch,\" said Tom, when they were out of hearing of the other boys. \"Yes,\" answered Randolph, indifferently. \"I don\u0027t care so much for that as for the ten dollars my father is going to give me.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought. You\u0027ve got another watch, you know—more valuable.\" \"Well, what of it?\" said Randolph, suspiciously. \"I think you might give me the Waterbury. I haven\u0027t got any.\" \"Why should I give it to you?\" answered Randolph, coldly. \"Because but for me you wouldn\u0027t have won it, nor the ten dollars, neither.\" \"How do you make that out?\" \"The teacher said so himself.\" \"I don\u0027t agree to it.\" \"You can\u0027t deny it. Luke was seven or eight rods ahead when I got in his way.\" \"Then it was lucky for me.\" \"It isn\u0027t lucky for me. My head hurts awfully.\" \"I\u0027m very sorry, of course.\" \"That won\u0027t do me any good. Come, Randolph, give me the watch, like a good fellow.\" \"Well, you\u0027ve got cheek, I must say. I want the watch myself.\" \"And is that all the satisfaction I am to get for my broken head?\" exclaimed Tom, indignantly. Randolph was a thoroughly mean boy, who, if he had had a dozen watches, would have wished to keep them all for himself. \"I\u0027ve a great mind to tell Luke and the teacher of the arrangement between us.\" \"There wasn\u0027t any arrangement,\" said Randolph, sharply. \"However, as I\u0027m really sorry for you, I am willing to give you a quarter. There, now, don\u0027t let me hear any more about the matter.\" He drew a silver quarter from his vest pocket and tendered it to Tom. Tom Harper was not a sensitive boy, but his face flushed with indignation and shame, and he made no offer to take the money. \"Keep your quarter, Randolph Duncan,\" he said scornfully. \"I think you\u0027re the meanest specimen of a boy that I ever came across. Any boy is a fool to be your friend. I don\u0027t care to keep company with you any longer.\" \"This to me!\" exclaimed Randolph, angrily. \"This is the pay I get for condescending to let you go with me.\" \"You needn\u0027t condescend any longer,\" said Tom, curtly, and he crossed to the other side of the street. Randolph looked after him rather uneasily. After all, he was sorry to lose his humble follower. \"He\u0027ll be coming round in a day or two to ask me to take him back,\" he reflected. \"I would be willing to give him ten cents more, but as for giving him the watch, he must think me a fool to part with that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3006/82964.html","bookId":285,"book":{"id":285,"title":"Struggling Upward or Luke Larkin\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： One Saturday afternoon in January a lively and animated group of boys were gathered on the western side of a large pond in the village of Groveton.
