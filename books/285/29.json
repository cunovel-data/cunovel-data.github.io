{"id":8732,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX — MR. COLEMAN IS FOILED IN HIS ATTEMPT","content":"Luke looked from Coleman to the clerk in some surprise. He saw from their looks that they were discussing some matter which concerned him. \"You left some money in my charge yesterday, Mr. Larkin,\" said the clerk. \"Yes.\" \"Your friend here claims it. Am I to give it to him?\" Luke\u0027s eyes lighted up indignantly. \"What does this mean, Mr. Coleman?\" he demanded, sternly. \"It means,\" answered Coleman, throwing off the mask, \"that the money is mine, and that you have no right to it.\" If Luke had not witnessed Coleman\u0027s search of his pockets during the night, he would have been very much astonished at this brazen statement. As it was, he had already come to the conclusion that his railroad acquaintance was a sharper. \"I will trouble you to prove your claim to it,\" said Luke, not at all disturbed by Coleman\u0027s impudent assertion. \"I gave it to you yesterday to place in the safe. I did not expect you would put it in in your own name,\" continued Coleman, with brazen hardihood. \"When did you hand it to me?\" asked Luke, calmly. \"When we first went up into the room.\" This change in his original charge Coleman made in consequence of learning the time of the deposit. \"This is an utter falsehood!\" exclaimed Luke, indignantly. \"Take care, young fellow!\" blustered Coleman. \"Your reputation for honesty isn\u0027t of the best. I don\u0027t like to expose you, but a boy who has served a three months\u0027 term in the penitentiary had better be careful how he acts.\" Luke\u0027s breath was quite taken away by this unexpected attack. The clerk began to eye him with suspicion, so confident was Coleman\u0027s tone. \"Mr. Lawrence,\" said Luke, for he had learned the clerk\u0027s name, \"will you allow me a word in private?\" \"I object to this,\" said Coleman, in a blustering tone. \"Whatever you have to say you can say before me.\" \"Yes,\" answered the clerk, who did not like Coleman\u0027s bullying tone, \"I will hear what you have to say.\" He led the way into an adjoining room, and assumed an air of attention. \"This man is a stranger to me,\" Luke commenced. \"I saw him yesterday afternoon for the first time in my life.\" \"But he says he is your guardian.\" \"He is no more my guardian than you are. Indeed, I would much sooner select you.\" \"How did you get acquainted?\" \"He introduced himself to me as a traveler for H. B. Claflin, of New York. I did not doubt his statement at the time, but now I do, especially after what happened in the night.\" \"What was that?\" asked the clerk, pricking up his ears. Luke went on to describe Coleman\u0027s search of his pockets. \"Did you say anything?\" \"No. I wished to see what he was after. As I had left nearly all my money with you, I was not afraid of being robbed.\" \"I presume your story is correct. In fact, I detected him in a misstatement as to the time of giving you the money. But I don\u0027t want to get into trouble.\" \"Ask him how much money I deposited with you,\" suggested Luke. \"He has no idea, and will have to guess.\" \"I have asked him the question once, but will do so again.\" The clerk returned to the office with Luke. Coleman eyed them uneasily, as if he suspected them of having been engaged in a conspiracy against him. \"Well,\" he said, \"are you going to give me my money?\" \"State the amount,\" said the clerk, in a businesslike manner. \"I have already told you that I can\u0027t state exactly. I handed the money to Luke without counting it.\" \"You must have some idea, at any rate,\" said the clerk. \"Of course I have. There was somewhere around seventy-five dollars.\" This he said with a confidence which he did not feel, for it was, of course, a mere guess. \"You are quite out in your estimate, Mr. Coleman. It is evident to me that you have made a false claim. You will oblige me by settling your bill and leaving the hotel.\" \"Do you think I will submit to such treatment?\" demanded Coleman, furiously. \"I think you\u0027ll have to,\" returned the clerk, quietly. \"You can go in to breakfast, if you like, but you must afterward leave the hotel. John,\" this to a bellboy, \"go up to number forty-seven and bring down this gentleman\u0027s luggage.\" \"You and the boy are in a conspiracy against me!\" exclaimed Coleman, angrily. \"I have a great mind to have you both arrested!\" \"I advise you not to attempt it. You may get into trouble.\" Coleman apparently did think better of it. Half an hour later he left the hotel, and Luke found himself alone. He decided that he must be more circumspect hereafter.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3006/82990.html","bookId":285,"book":{"id":285,"title":"Struggling Upward or Luke Larkin\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： One Saturday afternoon in January a lively and animated group of boys were gathered on the western side of a large pond in the village of Groveton.
