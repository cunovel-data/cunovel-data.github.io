{"id":8742,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIX — HOW LUKE WAS RECEIVED","content":"Luke\u0027s return to Groveton was received with delight by his mother and his true friend Linton. Naturally Randolph displayed the same feelings toward him as ever. It so chanced that he met Luke only an hour after his arrival. He would have passed him by unnoticed but for the curiosity he felt to know where he had been, and what he was intending to do. \"Humph! so you\u0027re back again!\" he remarked. \"Yes,\" answered Luke, with a smile. \"I hope you haven\u0027t missed me much, Randolph.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ve managed to live through it,\" returned Randolph, with what he thought to be cutting sarcasm. \"I am glad of that.\" \"Where were you?\" asked Randolph, abruptly. \"I was in New York a part of the time,\" said Luke. \"Where were you the rest of the time?\" \"I was traveling.\" \"That sounds large. Perhaps you were traveling with a hand-organ.\" \"Perhaps I was.\" \"Well, what are you going to do now?\" \"Thank you for your kind interest in me, Randolph. I will tell you as soon as I know.\" \"Oh, you needn\u0027t think I feel interest in you.\" \"Then I won\u0027t.\" \"You are impertinent,\" said Randolph, scowling. It dawned upon him that Luke was chaffing him. \"I don\u0027t mean to be. If I have been, I apologize. If you know of any situation which will pay me a fair sum, I wish you would mention me.\" \"I\u0027ll see about it,\" said Randolph, in an important tone. He was pleased at Luke\u0027s change of tone. \"I don\u0027t think you can get back as janitor, for my father doesn\u0027t like you.\" \"Couldn\u0027t you intercede for me, Randolph?\" \"Why, the fact is, you put on so many airs, for a poor boy, that I shouldn\u0027t feel justified in recommending you. It is your own fault.\" \"Well, perhaps it is,\" said Luke. \"I am glad you acknowledge it. I don\u0027t know but my father will give you a chance to work round our house, make fires, and run errands.\" \"What would he pay?\" asked Luke, in a businesslike tone. \"He might pay a dollar and a half a week.\" \"I\u0027m afraid I couldn\u0027t support myself on that.\" \"Oh, well, that\u0027s your lookout. It\u0027s better than loafing round doing nothing.\" \"You\u0027re right there, Randolph.\" \"I\u0027ll just mention it to father, then.\" \"No, thank you. I shouldn\u0027t wonder if Mr. Reed might find something for me to do.\" \"Oh, the man that robbed the bank?\" said Randolph, turning up his nose. \"It may soon be discovered that some one else robbed the bank.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" Here the two boys parted. \"Luke,\" said Linton, the same day, \"have you decided what you are going to do?\" \"Not yet; but I have friends who, I think, will look out for me.\" \"Because my father says he will find you a place if you fail to get one elsewhere.\" \"Tell your father that I think he is very kind. There is no one to whom I would more willingly be indebted for a favor. If I should find myself unemployed, I will come to him.\" \"All right! I am going to drive over to Coleraine\"—the next town—\"this afternoon. Will you go with me?\" \"I should like nothing better.\" \"What a difference there is between Randolph and Linton!\" thought Luke. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3006/83000.html","bookId":285,"book":{"id":285,"title":"Struggling Upward or Luke Larkin\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： One Saturday afternoon in January a lively and animated group of boys were gathered on the western side of a large pond in the village of Groveton.
