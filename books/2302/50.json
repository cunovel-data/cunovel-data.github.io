Sitting up, he switched on the bedside lamp, then turned to see if Mara was asleep, only to find her side of the bed was empty.\n “Mara?”\n Gaining his feet, he prowled through the hotel suite, turning on the lights as he went. There was no sign of her. Frowning, he returned to the living room and sank down on the sofa. Where would she have gone at this time of the night?\n Mara. She was a mystery wrapped in an enigma. True, he had only known her a short time, but she surprised him on a daily basis. She looked to be about twenty years old, but there were times when he would have sworn she was older. Much older. He sometimes found himself studying her, looking for some sign that she’d had a face-lift or other cosmetic surgery, but her body was toned and taut, her skin flawless.\n And then there were the people he had met earlier that night. It had been all he could do to hide his astonishment when he overheard one of the Cordova brothers call Vince Cordova “Dad.” Until then, Kyle had assumed that Vince was another brother. Impossible as it seemed, all of them—men and women alike—appeared to be in their late twenties or early thirties.\n His thoughts turned to Mara again. Since the day he met her, he had thought of little else. She was like an addiction he couldn’t shake, a thirst he couldn’t quench. A riddle he couldn’t solve.\n He remembered a conversation they’d had while still in Egypt. They had been in his hotel room, watching an old movie about Antony and Cleopatra. They had discussed the movie when it was over. Kyle had made a comment about Cleopatra. He couldn’t remember now what he’d said, but Mara had corrected him and then, her expression wistful, she had told him about Egypt’s most famous queen. Kyle was no expert on the subject. He’d had no way of knowing if what Mara had told him was historically correct or not, yet everything she had said carried the ring of truth. It was almost as if she had known the Egyptian queen personally. It reminded him of an old Twilight Zone episode in which a beautiful woman mesmerized men, then, with the help of a beetle, took their life force, thereby keeping herself forever young.\n Chiding himself for his fanciful thoughts, he turned off the lights and went back to bed. If there was one thing he did know about Mara, it was that she loved the night. No doubt she had just gone out for a walk in the moonlight.\n Chapter Forty-Two\n It was late afternoon when Savanah awoke. Sitting up, she glanced around the guest room. Rane’s mother had quite a knack for decorating; the room, done in shades of gray and blue with red accents, looked like it had been taken from the pages of House and Home magazine.\n Savanah glanced at her watch. Since staying here with Rane’s parents, she found herself waking later and later each day. She supposed she would have to adjust her hours to Rane’s, though now that he could come and go as he pleased during the day, finding time to be together was no longer a problem.\n She wondered if he was awake yet, and if he was as nervous as she was.\n Today was their wedding day. She had always dreamed of a big wedding, always imagined herself walking down a flower-strewn aisle on her father’s arm, but that wasn’t possible now.\n “Oh, Daddy,” she murmured, “I wish you were here.”\n Rising, she ran her hand over the gown hanging on the back of the closet door. The dress made her feel beautiful. Would Rane think the same when he saw her?\n After showering, she pulled on a pair of shorts and a shirt and went into the kitchen. The house was quiet, leading her to believe that everyone else was still asleep. She poured herself a glass of orange juice, then stood at the sink, staring out the window. She had avenged her father’s death. Tonight, she would ask Mara if she knew the name of the Vampire who had destroyed her mother. Strange thoughts for a bride-to-be, she mused, yet these days her life was nothing if not strange.\n Rane and his parents rose just before sunset. Since Savanah had decided to get dressed at the house, Cara shooed the men away, insisting it was bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her gown before the wedding. That simple little superstition somehow set Savanah’s mind at ease. Rane’s family might be Vampires, but they had managed to retain their humanity.\n It wasn’t until she was dressed and realized there were no mirrors in the house that Savanah regretted her decision to get dressed at home instead of at the church.\n “You look lovely,” Cara said, arranging the folds of Savanah’s veil. “Rane is a lucky man.”\n Clad in a tea-length dress of mauve silk with her hair piled artfully atop her head, Rane’s mother looked pretty enough to be a bride herself.\n “You’ve been so good for him,” Cara said, taking Savanah’s hands in hers. “You do love him, don’t you?” she asked, her gaze searching Savanah’s. “If you’re not sure, if you’re having any doubts, tell him now, before it’s too late.”\n “I love him more than anything. I’ve had my doubts,” Savanah admitted, “but I can’t imagine my life without him.”\n “What about children? You do know that Rane can’t give you any?”\n “Yes, of course.”\n “Adoption is always an alternative,” Cara said with a wink. “I don’t know if Rane told you, but I was adopted.”\n Savanah nodded. She and Rane had talked about it one night. She was tempted to ask his mother what it had been like, having Vampires for parents, but she didn’t quite have the nerve. Perhaps another time, when she knew Rane’s mother better.\n Cara squeezed her hand. “Welcome to the family, daughter. I hope you and Rane will be as happy as his father and I have been.”\n “Thank you.” Savanah accepted her mother-in-law’s embrace.\n “Do you have everything?” Cara asked. “Something old?”\n “My future husband?” Savanah said, grinning.\n Cara laughed. “Something new?”\n “Everything I have on.”\n “Something borrowed?”\n “You’ve got me there.”\n “Here.” Removing her pearl necklace, Cara fastened it around Savanah’s neck. “Something blue?”\n “My garter.”\n “Perfect!” Cara exclaimed.\n “Thank you for everything.”\n “You’re more than welcome. Shall we go? Our chariot awaits.”\n The chariot turned out to be a white stretch limo. Feeling like Cinderella going to the ball, Savanah gathered her skirts around her and ducked inside.\n “Well, isn’t this nice?” Cara asked, sitting across from Savanah.\n “Very. Thank you.”\n “It was Rane’s idea,” Cara said, her expression softening.\n “You must have missed him very much.”\n “You can’t imagine! It’s wonderful to have them both home again. Sometimes I can’t help wishing they were still my little boys. They grow up so fast,” she said with a wistful smile. “Too fast.”\n Not knowing what to say, Savanah stared out the window. Not for the first time, she wished her father was there beside her.\n It was late when the limo turned down a long, winding road lined by ancient oaks and pines. Savanah hadn’t known quite what to expect from a church frequented by Vampires. Something dark and gloomy, decorated with leering gargoyles and fallen angels. Her expectations couldn’t have been farther from the truth. Tall trees and lush greenery surrounded the old church, which looked almost ghostly in the light of the full moon. The air was filled with the fragrant scent of evergreens and dew-dampened earth. The sweet song of a night bird blended with the cheerful chirp of crickets and the croaking bass of a bullfrog, their evening songs combining in a moonlight serenade.\n “It’s lovely,” Savanah murmured as she followed Cara up the walkway to the entrance.\n “It is, isn’t it? It’s pretty during the day, but it’s even more beautiful in the moonlight.”\n Savanah clutched her bouquet, her heart skipping a beat when Rafe opened the door leading into the vestibule. Once again, Savanah was taken aback by how much Rane and his brother looked alike. She wasn’t sure how she knew it was Rafe. She would have to ask Rane about that later. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that not only did she love Rane, but she had shared her blood with him.\n After telling his mother how nice she looked, Rafe took her by the hand and escorted her down the aisle to her seat, and then came back for Savanah.\n With a wink and a smile, he placed her hand on his forearm. “Ready?”\n Savanah nodded. She had a brief glimpse of the chapel as Rafe walked her down the aisle. The altar and the pews were carved from burnished oak. Moonlight streamed through the red, blue, and gold stained-glass window above the altar. The carpet was a deep blue. A sad-faced Madonna stood in one corner, her arm outstretched.\n Rane’s parents and grandparents sat in the first pew on one side of the aisle; Kathy sat behind Rane’s parents, along with a man and a woman Savanah didn’t recognize. Mara and Kyle sat holding hands in the front row on the other side of the aisle. Mara looked resplendent in a silver gown that shimmered in the candlelight. Her hair, as black as ink, stood out in sharp contrast to her gown.\n And then Savanah saw Rane waiting for her at the altar, and everything else faded into the background. He had always been the most handsome of men, but now, dressed in a black tux, his hair shining like ebony, he fairly took her breath away.\n Rafe gave his brother a wink, then placed Savanah’s hand in Rane’s, and took his seat. Turning, Rane and Savanah faced the priest.\n Father Lanzoni was of medium height. His hair was black and wavy, laced with silver at his temples. He smiled down at the two of them, his hazel eyes filled with warmth. “Welcome, my children.” His gaze moved over Rane’s family. “It gives me great pleasure to see you all again, and to share this sacred moment with your family.”\n The priest focused his attention on Rane and Savanah. “Marriage is a holy institution ordained by God for the blessing of His children. If you wish to have a happy marriage, one that will last, you have only to put the happiness and welfare of your spouse above your own. It is something easily said and yet not always easy to do. As you look into each other’s eyes, as you repeat your vows, I urge you to remember how you feel this night, and to hold the memory close in times of struggle and sacrifice. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-pleasure-children-of-the-night-4/page-50.html","bookId":2302,"book":{"id":2302,"title":"Night\u0027s Pleasure (Children of The Night #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Night\u0027s Pleasure (Children of The Night #4) \n Desire Casts a Dark Spell... \n Savanah Gentry’s life was so much simpler when she was a reporter for the local newspaper.
