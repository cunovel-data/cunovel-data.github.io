The car was like the man, she thought. Smooth and sleek and a little bit dangerous.\n Savanah eased off the gas as she turned onto the main street. She hadn’t been able to see much of the town when they stopped at the store last night; this afternoon, she noticed how quaint the buildings were. The streets were clean, lined with tall pines. A pretty park made a splash of green at the end of the town; several young women and children were frolicking in a pool located near the center of the park. A number of people were standing in line at the corner Cineplex. On the spur of the moment, Savanah decided to take in a movie. It was one she had been wanting to see, a remake of an old John Wayne flick, and she couldn’t think of a better way to forget her troubles than to lose herself in a good, old-fashioned, shoot-’em-up.\n As it turned out, the movie wasn’t as good as she’d hoped, but then she wasn’t surprised. Remakes were rarely as good as the original. After leaving the theater, she stopped at a small café for a tuna salad sandwich and a chocolate shake, then browsed a couple of gift shops. At the Bon Ton Ladies Shoppe, she bought a green polka-dot sundress, a pair of white sandals, a bathing suit, and a beach towel. She added a hot pink T-shirt and a pair of jeans for good measure, and headed for home.\n Only, the cabin in the woods wasn’t home. Sadness fell over her like a dark cloud. Her father was gone and home would never be the same again. Perhaps she would sell the house….\n Shaking off her maudlin thoughts, she focused on the scenery. Tall trees and lacy ferns grew on both sides of the winding road. Wildflowers in rainbow hues grew intermittently, adding splashes of color to the edge of the roadway. She hit the brake when a doe bounded across the road. Slowing down, Savanah took a deep breath, thinking the winding mountain road was just as dangerous, in its own way, as the five o’clock traffic back home….\n Home. Tears burned her eyes and she let them fall, hoping they would help to wash away the grief that welled up from deep inside.\n It was just after sunset when Savanah pulled up in front of Mara’s house. She sat in the car for a few minutes; then, shaking off her melancholy, she grabbed her purse and shopping bags and went inside.\n Rane was waiting for her just inside the front door. “Where have you been?”\n “I went into town.”\n “Do you think that was wise?” A muscle throbbed in his jaw as he fought to control his temper. “Have you forgotten why I brought you here?”\n “I thought it would be all right during the day. The Vampire…”\n “Isn’t working alone,” he reminded her. “Werewolves have no aversion to the sun.”\n “I guess I just wasn’t thinking.”\n “Well, you’d damn well better start! These people are playing for keeps, Savanah, remember that.” He muttered an oath as her eyes filled with tears. Drawing her into his arms, he said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you, but you’ve got to be more careful. I can’t protect you if you’re not here.”\n She dashed the tears from her eyes. She wouldn’t cry. Rane was right. She had to keep her wits about her.\n “So, what did you buy?” he asked.\n “Nothing much. A sundress and some shoes, a bathing suit…”\n He looked down at her, a roguish grin playing over his lips. “You didn’t wear one this afternoon.”\n “How do you know?”\n “I watched you swimming in the pool.”\n She blinked at him. “I knew someone was watching me.”\n “Did you?”\n “Where were you? I didn’t see you?”\n “Up in the attic.”\n “Is that where you…ah, slept?”\n “No. I slept in Mara’s lair.”\n “What were you doing in the attic, then?”\n “Watching you.” He ran his fingertips over her cheek. “It would be a shame to hide that beautiful body under a bathing suit.”\n Knowing he had been watching her swim and that he found her beautiful unleashed a flurry of butterflies in her stomach.\n “Maybe we could go skinny-dipping together sometime,” she suggested.\n “I’m game if you are.”\n Heat pooled low in her belly as she visualized the two of them swimming naked in the moonlight. What would it be like, to feel the length of his body pressed against her own, wet skin sliding intimately over wet skin?\n His grin told her he was thinking along the same lines. “Perhaps in an hour or so,” he said, “after we’ve both had time to dine.”\n His words were like a splash of cold water in her face, reminding her anew that although they sometimes thought alike, they were worlds apart.\n He kissed the tip of her nose. “Keep the doors and windows closed and locked. I won’t be gone long.”\n She nodded, her mind shying away from the image of Rane bending over some poor unsuspecting woman, his fangs piercing the tender flesh of her throat, stealing her life’s essence, and perhaps her life, as well. What was she doing, spending time with a Vampire, when she was supposed to be hunting them, killing them? It was a question she had asked herself before, a question with only one answer, foolish as it was: she was in love with him. It gave new meaning to the phrase “dying for love.” And yet, even if she didn’t have deep feelings for Rane, she knew she would never be able to destroy him. He had comforted her when she needed comfort most, looked after her, brought her here to protect her. She laughed softly. Maybe love really was blind.\n For Savanah, dinner was a chicken Caesar salad, a thick slice of cantaloupe, and a glass of iced tea. For some reason, swallowing the tea made her think of Rane, out prowling the shadows looking for prey. What was it like, to exist on a warm liquid diet? Did he ever miss real food, or think about sinking his teeth into a tart apple or a juicy orange instead of living flesh?\n Repulsed by her thoughts, she put the glass aside, washed up her few dishes, and went downstairs to watch a movie. If she had thought to forget about Vampires, she had picked the wrong night to watch the tube. It seemed every movie channel was featuring films about the Undead, from the old black-and-white Spanish version of Dracula to the latest remake of Dark Shadows.\n She was flipping through the stations when Rane materialized on the sofa beside her.\n “Sheesh!” she exclaimed, startled by his sudden appearance. “Give a girl a little warning, will ya?”\n “Sorry.”\n She looked at him, wondering who he had fed on and if he had left his prey alive.\n He cocked his head to one side under her perusal. “Want to tell me what that look is for?” he asked, then grunted softly. “Never mind, I’ll bet I can guess.”\n “I’ll bet you can, too, since you read my mind so well, so often.”\n “I don’t have to read your mind, Savanah. It’s written all over your face. You’re wondering who I fed on, and how I picked her, or him, and if they’re dead or alive.”\n “You can see all that in my expression?”\n “Am I wrong?”\n “No,” she admitted.\n Rane blew out a sigh. “She was a middle-aged woman with sad blue eyes and pretty brown hair and I left her where I found her, none the worse for wear. Happy?”\n “I’m sorry,” she said, her voice tinged with frost. “It’s none of my business.”\n “Savanah, I can’t change what I am. I wouldn’t if I could. I love you. I think you love me. Do you want to try and work through our differences? If not, I’ll protect you as best I can, but you won’t see me anymore.”\n She stared up at him, her mind running in a dozen directions at once. What did she want? How could she be a hunter and have a Vampire lover? Did she want to face the future without him in it? He might be a Vampire and loving him might be dangerous, but her life had definitely been more exciting since they met. Could she live with the differences between them? Would those differences bring them closer together, or eventually drive them apart? He would never look any older than he did now. How would she feel when she was wrinkled and gray and he still looked the same? Would their relationship even last that long? Would it be better to end it now?\n “Savanah?”\n “I don’t know what I want.” Her gaze slid away from his. “This is all so new…. Sometimes I want to grab a stake and a bottle of holy water and conquer the world, and other times I just want to crawl into a hole and hide. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do! How could my parents keep such a secret from me?”\n Rane swore softly. She was so young, so damn young. And remarkably innocent for this day and age. She worked at a newspaper, she had covered stories of rape and murder and incest, and yet she seemed strangely untouched by the ugliness in the world around her. Or she had been, until he came along.\n Beside him, Savanah squared her shoulders, lifted her head, and met his gaze. “Yes, I want to try and work things out between us.”\n “You’re sure?”\n “Yes.”\n He cocked his head to the side. “What changed your mind?”\n “My mom and dad were nothing alike, and yet they were happy together. If they could get along, why can’t we?”\n “Your father wasn’t a Vampire.”\n “Well, everyone has a quirk of some kind….”\n “A quirk?” He almost choked on the word. A quirk was a funny habit, an odd trait. There was nothing remotely funny about being a Vampire.\n “We’ll just have to work around it,” Savanah said. “There’s just one thing. You have to stop reading my mind. It isn’t fair, since I can’t read yours. And you can’t take my blood without telling me.”\n “That’s two things,” he mused, stifling the urge to laugh.\n She stuck her tongue out at him. “Don’t quibble. Do we have a deal or not?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-pleasure-children-of-the-night-4/page-27.html","bookId":2302,"book":{"id":2302,"title":"Night\u0027s Pleasure (Children of The Night #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Night\u0027s Pleasure (Children of The Night #4) \n Desire Casts a Dark Spell... \n Savanah Gentry’s life was so much simpler when she was a reporter for the local newspaper.
