It’s easier to rake cheap suckers over the coals than to pick the big-money boys.\\n\\n “Who played in the game?”\\n\\n “Two or three of the sharps. And Dad. And some oil and cattlemen.”\\n\\n It figured. Texans with too much money and too much faith.\\n\\n “Even the oilmen didn’t do badly,” she said. “Dad took the money straight from the crooks. He had the time of his life. And then…then they must have figured out what happened. For a few weeks everything was fine. Then we got a note in the mail. It wasn’t signed. It said Jack Blake better give back the twenty grand he won or he would get what was coming to him. He just laughed it off, Ed. He said he was surprised they had figured it out but he wasn’t going to let it worry him.”\\n\\n “And then they killed him?”\\n\\n “Yes.” She finished her drink. “I was over at a friend’s house. I got home and found him lying on the living-room floor. There was blood all over. I went to him and touched him and…and he was still warm—”\\n\\n I picked up her hand and held on to it. Her skin was white. She took a quick breath and squeezed my hand. “I’m all right, Ed.”\\n\\n “Sure.”\\n\\n We sat there. It was pushing 4:30 and the bar was starting to draw lushes. A tough little dyke in tight slacks strode over to the jukebox and played something noisy. I looked at Rhona again.\\n\\n “How do you fit in?” I asked.\\n\\n “They want to kill me.”\\n\\n “Why?”\\n\\n “They want their money back.”\\n\\n I shook my head. “I won’t buy it. You’re in New York, not Cleveland. You were busy paying off a blackmailer who caught a load of lead in Canarsie. I don’t buy it at all, Rhona. They wouldn’t chase you that hard just because your father took them with a few fancy cuts and shuffles. They might run him down and kill him, but they wouldn’t bother you.”\\n\\n “It’s true, Ed.”\\n\\n “It is like hell. Where does the blackmailer fit?”\\n\\n “He was blackmailing me. I told you.”\\n\\n “How? Why? With what?”\\n\\n She thought about it. The juke was still too noisy and the bar was filling up. I was beginning to dislike the place.\\n\\n She said: “All right.”\\n\\n I waited.\\n\\n “I’m Jack Blake’s daughter,” she said. “I’m not a weeper and I don’t throw in the towel when somebody hits me. I’m pretty tough, Ed.”\\n\\n I could believe it. She looked the part. Her green eyes were warm enough to throw sparks now.\\n\\n “I came to New York to get them,” she said. “They killed my father, Ed. Those rotten bastards killed him. They beat him and he died, and I’m not the kind of girl who can sit on her behind in Cleveland and write it off to profit and loss. I flew to New York to get something good on Abe Zucker, something good enough to put him on death row at Sing Sing. That’s why they want me out of the way, Ed. Because they know I won’t give up unless they kill me.”\\n\\n “And the blackmailer?” I asked. “How did he fit in?”\\n\\n “Klugsman,” she corrected. “Milton Klugsman. He got in touch with me, told me he could prove that Zucker had my dad killed. I…I guess I let you think he was blackmailing me just to make things simpler. He called me and told me he had evidence to sell. The price was five grand.”\\n\\n “He might have been conning you, Rhona.”\\n\\n She raised an eyebrow. “Don’t you think I thought of that? He could have been looking for some easy money or he could have been setting me up for Zucker. That’s why I wouldn’t meet him myself, why I hired you. I decided it was worth risking five grand, Ed. Five grand was just an ante in a game this size—”\\n\\n She stopped, shrugged. “I guess Klugsman was telling the truth. Whatever he had, I won’t get it now. He’s dead. They killed him, and now they want to kill me. If I had any sense I’d get out of town until they forgot all about me.”\\n\\n “Why don’t you?”\\n\\n “Because I’m Jack Blake’s daughter. Because I’m a stubborn girl. I always have been. Well, where do we go from here, Ed?”\\n\\n I put a dollar on the table for the barmaid. “For a starter,” I said, “we get the hell out of here.”\\n\\n FIVE\\n\\n We took my Chevy. I drove uptown on Eighth Avenue as far as Twentieth, then cut east. There was a parking spot in front of a swanky five-story brick building on Gramercy Park. I coaxed the Chevy into it, with a Caddy in front of us and a Lincoln behind. The Chevy felt outclassed. We got out of the car, walked past a stiff doorman and into a self-service elevator.\\n\\n “I didn’t want a hotel room,” she said as we entered her place. “I thought it would be too easy for them to find me. This apartment was listed in the Times. It’s a sublet, all furnished and ready. It costs a lot of money but it’s worth it.”\\n\\n “What name did you rent it under?”\\n\\n “I don’t remember,” she said. “Not mine.”\\n\\n She said there was scotch if I wanted a drink. I didn’t. I wandered around the living room, a brazenly modern room. Rhona sat down on an orange couch and crossed her legs.\\n\\n “What do we do next, Ed?”\\n\\n “Go back to Cleveland.”\\n\\n “And forget about it?”\\n\\n “Uh-huh.”\\n\\n She looked away. I studied her legs, then let my eyes move slowly up her body. I remembered last afternoon, in my apartment, in my bedroom. I took a quick breath, then crammed some tobacco into a pipe and scratched a match on a box.\\n\\n “He was my father, Ed.”\\n\\n “I know.”\\n\\n “I can’t quit.”\\n\\n “Hell,” I said, “you absolutely can’t do anything else. You know how Zucker took care of your father? Zucker didn’t go there himself, Rhona. He picked up a telephone—or he hired somebody to pick up a phone. And then a bunch of hired muscle from Detroit or Chicago or Vegas got on a plane to Cleveland and beat your father to death and flew back on the next plane. You couldn’t pin something like that to Zucker in a hundred years. All you can do is take a gun and shoot a hole in his head.”\\n\\n “That’s not such a bad idea, is it?”\\n\\n I didn’t answer her.\\n\\n “No,” she said finally. “You’re wrong, Ed. Why is he scared of me? Why can’t he just ignore me? He had this lawyer offer you ten thousand dollars? If he’s in the clear, why am I worth that kind of money to him?”\\n\\n “You must have him scared.”\\n\\n She swung a small fist into the palm of her other hand. A startling gesture from a girl, especially a feminine one like her. “You are goddamned right. I’ve got him scared,” she said. “I’ve got the son of a bitch turning green. And there has to be evidence, Ed. Klugsman had evidence.”\\n\\n “Unless he was conning you.”\\n\\n “Then why did they kill him?”\\n\\n She was right. Abe Zucker was in enough trouble to work up a sweat, enough to make him spray Canarsie with machine-gun slugs and paper Manhattan with ten-grand rewards. It didn’t quite mesh yet. Something was wrong somewhere, something didn’t ring true. But for the time being she was right and I had to ride with her.\\n\\n I drew on my pipe. “What do you know about Klugsman?”\\n\\n “Nothing but his name. And that he’s dead.”\\n\\n “You never met him?”\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n “You know where he lives?”\\n\\n She shook her head. “He called me on the phone, Ed. He said his name was Milton Klugsman and he told me he had the information I needed. He said he could prove who killed my father. He didn’t give his address or his phone number or anything.”\\n\\n “The phone. Is it in your name?”\\n\\n “No, it’s in the name of the people I’m subletting from.”\\n\\n “Then how did he reach you?”\\n\\n “I have no idea.”\\n\\n We kept running into walls and up blind alleys. I wondered if she was lying to me. So far she’d fed me enough nonsense to earn her a Pathological Liar Merit Badge, but the latest version had a plausible ring to it.\\n\\n “Somebody knew you were in town. Who?”\\n\\n “I don’t know.”\\n\\n “Phillip Carr showed me a picture of you. Any idea where he got it?”\\n\\n “None.”\\n\\n “It was a head-and-shoulder shot, Rhona. You had your hair swept back and you were smiling, but not too broadly.”\\n\\n Her face clouded. “That…sounds like a picture Dad carried in his wallet. They could have stolen it when they killed him.” She bit her lip. “But that doesn’t make sense, does it?”\\n\\n It didn’t. I poked at my memory, brushed the snapshot away, and brought a different picture into focus. A face I’d seen a day ago in Canarsie. I described Klugsman as well as I could, told her how tall he was and what kind of a face he had and what clothes he was wearing. The description rang no bells for her.\\n\\n I stood up, leaned over to knock the dottle from my pipe, and walked over to her. “We have to start with Klugsman,” I said. “Klugsman may have had some evidence. Without it we’re nowhere. I can try getting a line on him. Maybe I can find out who he was, where he lived, and who his friends were. If he had anything around the house, it’s probably gone by now. But maybe he’s got a friend or a relative who knows something. It’s worth a try.”\\n\\n “You’re going now?”\\n\\n She seemed sad about it. She was standing just a few feet from me, her hands at her sides, her shoulders back, her breasts in sharp relief against the front of her dress. Her mouth was pouting a little and her eyes were unhappy. I looked at her and didn’t want to go anywhere. I wanted to stay awhile.\\n\\n “I’d better get going,” I said.\\n\\n “Wait a few minutes, Ed.”\\n\\n The voice was soft as a pillow. Her eyes were moist. She took a short step toward me, stopped. I put out my hands and caught her shoulders and she pressed against me, hard.\\n\\n “Ed—”\\n\\n I kissed her. Her mouth tasted of Rob Roys and cigarettes and she put her arms around me and clung to me like a morning glory on a wire fence. Her body was on fire. I kissed her eyes, her cheeks, her throat.\\n\\n “I’m all alone,” she said. “All alone and afraid. Stay with me, Ed.”\\n\\n “Sure,” I said, leading her into the bedroom, decorated in various shades of green. She stood there like a statue, but who likes statues dressed? I took off her clothes and ran my hands over her body. She vibrated like a tuning fork, purred like a kitten.\\n\\n The mattress was firm. I put a pillow under her head and spread that ash blond hair over it. I touched her, kissed her. She breathed jaggedly and her eyes were wild.\\n\\n “Ed—”\\n\\n To hell with Klugsman. He was dead. He could wait awhile…\\n\\n I LEFT HER IN BED, face pressed to pillow, eyes closed, body curled like a fetus. I told her not to leave the apartment, not to answer the door, not to pick up the telephone unless it rang once, stopped, then rang again. That would be my signal. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-night-stands-and-lost-weekends/page-36.html","bookId":2318,"book":{"id":2318,"title":"One Night Stands and Lost Weekends","description":"Storyline: In the era before he created moody private investigator Matthew Scudder, burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, sleepless spy Evan Tanner, and the amiable hit man Keller—and years before his first Edgar Award—a young writer named Lawrence Block submitted a story titled \"You Can\u0027t Lose\" to Manhunt magazine.
