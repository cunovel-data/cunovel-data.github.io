{"id":2318,"title":"One Night Stands and Lost Weekends","description":"Storyline: In the era before he created moody private investigator Matthew Scudder, burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, sleepless spy Evan Tanner, and the amiable hit man Keller—and years before his first Edgar Award—a young writer named Lawrence Block submitted a story titled \"You Can\u0027t Lose\" to Manhunt magazine. It was published, and the rest is history. One Night Stands and Lost Weekends is a sterling collection of short crime fiction and suspense novelettes penned between 1958 and 1962 by a budding young master and soon-to-be Grand Master—an essential slice of genre history, and more fun than a high-speed police chase following a bank job gone bad.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/one-night-stands-and-lost-weekends.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":59,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
