I went home and took a hot shower and fell asleep the minute I hit the bed.\\n\\n Homicide is rugged. There are good things about it—we don’t take bribes, we stay clean. There are also bad things.\\n\\n Because there are only three types of murder, and of the three there is only one that we solve. There is the amateur killing with a motive, the husband who strangles his wife, the tavern brawl, the grudge murder. There you have your suspect at the start and you look around for the proof. And find it, no matter how clever a job they do of burying it. That is the kind that gets solved.\\n\\n There is also the silly killing. The bum beaten to death on the Bowery. The hustler with a knife in her belly. The fag killed in his own apartment by a casual conquest. The mugging victim with a crushed skull. These we don’t solve. Not without a break.\\n\\n And there is the professional murder. And those we never solve.\\n\\n I met Fischer at five in the afternoon. He was carrying a folded copy of an afternoon tabloid. The headline ran GANGLAND SLAYING IN HELL’S KITCHEN. I could have guessed it word for word. I took the paper from him and gave the story a quick run-through. It was about the same as the morning papers had it.\\n\\n It didn’t say we had nothing to work with. It didn’t say we had anything to work with. It said that Johnny Blue had been found in a parked car with holes in him, and that he was dead. Then there were a few paragraphs trying to turn the career of a fourth-rater into something notorious, and then there was some nonsense to the effect that the cops were keeping mum.\\n\\n Mum?\\n\\n “We’re on Calder,” I told him. “No other assignment until we nail him. Got that?”\\n\\n “Sure.”\\n\\n “I wanted it that way. I want to get Calder. I want to get him good.”\\n\\n “I thought you said it was impossible.”\\n\\n “It is.”\\n\\n “Then—”\\n\\n “You talk too much,” I said. I waited for him to get mad but he didn’t. He was hurt—it showed in his face, in the way he wouldn’t look at me. But he wouldn’t get mad. And this made me like him that much less. He never got mad at anything. He didn’t know how to hate.\\n\\n I don’t like college cops. I don’t like people who are up to their ears in understanding and sympathy and sweetness and sunshine. I don’t like people who don’t know how to hate.\\n\\n Maybe it’s just the way a person is. If I were Calder I would hate cops. I’m a cop. I hate Calder. I hate him because he breaks laws and shoots people. I hate him because he gets away with it. I hated Johnny Blue. He used to get away with things too. Now he was dead and Calder had killed him and I hated Calder.\\n\\n I was going to get him.\\n\\n “Look it over again,” I said, sliding Calder’s file over to Fischer again. “Skip the record. Look at the picture.”\\n\\n Dark black hair. A flat face, not too bad-looking. Hard eyes, a long nose, a little scar on the chin. I don’t know how he got the scar. Maybe he cut himself shaving.\\n\\n “You said we pick him up today. Were you kidding?”\\n\\n “I don’t kid. I was serious.”\\n\\n “They found evidence?”\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n He looked at me. He was afraid to open his mouth. Gutless.\\n\\n “We worry him a little. Don’t bother your head about it. Go get the car and meet me out front. And wear a gun.”\\n\\n He didn’t say anything, just went off for the car. I checked my gun, then stuck it back in the holster. I picked up Calder’s file, and took a good long look at it. I let the face burn into my brain. I stood there for a minute or two and hated.\\n\\n Then I went out to the car where Fischer was waiting.\\n\\n The building was fancy. A uniformed doorman stood at attention out in front. I had to show him my shield before he let us inside. He was there to keep out undesirables. Unless they lived in the penthouse.\\n\\n The carpet was deep in the lobby. The elevator rose in silence. I stood there and hated Calder.\\n\\n He had the whole top floor. I got out of the elevator and took my gun out of its holster, wondering whether or not the doorman had called Calder yet. Probably.\\n\\n I rang the bell.\\n\\n “Yeah?”\\n\\n A penthouse overlooking the park didn’t get Hell’s Kitchen out of his speech. Nothing would.\\n\\n “Police.”\\n\\n “Whattaya want?”\\n\\n “Open the door and shut up.”\\n\\n A few seconds later the door opened. He was short, five-six or five-seven. He was wearing a silk bathrobe and slippers that looked expensive. The apartment was well-furnished but for what he had paid he could have used an interior decorator. There was a shoddiness about the place. Maybe the shoddiness was Calder.\\n\\n “Come on in,” he said. “You use a drink?”\\n\\n I ignored him. “You’re under arrest,” I told him.\\n\\n “What for?”\\n\\n “Murder.”\\n\\n “Yeah?” A wide smile. “Somebody got killed?”\\n\\n “Johnny Blue.”\\n\\n “I’m covered,” he said. No I’m innocent but I’m covered. “I was playing cards with some fellows.”\\n\\n “Uh-huh.”\\n\\n He shrugged heroically. “You want, we can go down to the station. My lawyer’ll have me out right away. I’m clean.”\\n\\n “You’re never clean,” I said. “You were born filthy.”\\n\\n The smile widened. But there was uncertainty behind it. I was getting to him.\\n\\n “You’re cheap and rotten,” I said. “You’re a punk. You spend a fortune on cologne and it still doesn’t cover the smell.”\\n\\n Now the smile was gone.\\n\\n “Your sister sleeps with bums,” I said. “Your mother was the cheapest whore on the West Side. She died of syphilis.”\\n\\n That did it. He was a few feet away—then he lowered his head and charged. I could have clubbed him with the gun. I didn’t.\\n\\n I shot him.\\n\\n He gave a yell like a wounded steer and fell to his knees. The bullet had taken him in the right shoulder. I guess it hurt. I hoped so.\\n\\n “You shot him.” It was Fischer talking.\\n\\n “Good thinking,” I told him. “You’re on the ball.”\\n\\n “Now what?”\\n\\n I shrugged. “We can take him in,” I suggested. “We can book him for resisting arrest and a few other things.”\\n\\n “Not murder?”\\n\\n “You heard him,” I said. “He’s clean.”\\n\\n I looked at Fischer. That was the answer to my college cop, my buddy. Here was a murderer, a murderer with a shoulder wound. Now we would be nice to him. Get him to a hospital quick before he lost too much blood. Maybe drop the resisting arrest charge because, after all, he was a sick man.\\n\\n I had my gun in my hand. I stepped back a few feet and aimed. I watched the play of expressions on Calder’s face. He didn’t know whether or not to believe it.\\n\\n I shot him in the face.\\n\\n I talked to Fischer while I found a gun in a drawer, picked it up in a towel, and wrapped Calder’s fingers around it. It made it look good—he had drawn on me, I shot him in the shoulder, he went on and held onto the gun, and I shot him dead. It would look good enough—there wasn’t going to be any investigation.\\n\\n “Maybe thirty killings,” I said. “That’s what this animal had to his credit. He made beating the law a business. He didn’t fool around. And there was no way to get him.”\\n\\n No answer from my partner.\\n\\n “So this time he lost. He doesn’t fool around. Well, neither do I.”\\n\\n I knew Fischer wasn’t satisfied. He wouldn’t blab, but it would worry him. He would feel uncomfortable with me. I don’t fit into his moral scheme of things. Maybe he’ll put in for a transfer.\\n\\n I hope so.\\n\\n JUST WINDOW SHOPPING\\n\\n I CLIMBED OVER THE BACK FENCE and hurried down the driveway. They probably hadn’t seen me at the window, but I couldn’t afford to take chances. The police had caught me once. I certainly did not want to be picked up again.\\n\\n It was horrible when the police caught me. I admitted everything but that wasn’t enough for them. They put me in a chair with the light shining in my eyes so that I could barely see. Then they started hitting me. They used rubber hoses so there wouldn’t be any marks. They hit me so much I nearly fainted.\\n\\n The beating wasn’t the worst of it, though. They called me names. They called me a sex fiend and a pervert. That hurt me more than the beatings.\\n\\n Because I’m not a pervert, you see. All I want to do is watch people. There’s no harm in that, is there? I don’t hurt anyone, and I never really bother anybody. Sometimes someone sees me watching them, and they get frightened or angry, but that’s only once in a great while. I’ve been very careful lately, ever since they caught me.\\n\\n And if they think I am a pervert, you should see some of the things I’ve seen. You wouldn’t believe the things some of these normal people do. It’s enough to make you sick to your stomach. Yet they are normal, and they call me a pervert, a Peeping Tom. I can’t quite understand it. All I do is watch.\\n\\n Ever since they caught me I have been very careful. That is why I left the window when the man looked at me. I’m almost sure he didn’t see me, but he glanced toward the window and I hopped the fence and got away from there. Besides, it wasn’t much fun watching at his window. The woman with him was old and fat and I was getting bored with the whole thing. There was no sense in taking chances for that.\\n\\n When I got out to the street I didn’t know where to go. I used to have a perfect spot. A pretty young prostitute over on Tremont Avenue who saw at least ten men a night. I could spend night after night watching her. The backyard was dark and I had a perfect view. But one night she saw me watching.\\n\\n She was nice about it and sensible, too. She didn’t call me a pervert. But she said the men might notice me, that they wouldn’t like it. She told me to stay away. It was a shame that I had to give up the spot, but at least she didn’t call the police or anything.\\n\\n But I couldn’t watch there anymore, and I had to find a new spot. I walked down the street looking for a lighted window. I stopped at several places, but there was nothing much to see. There were just people sitting or reading or watching television.\\n\\n Finally I found a house with a light on that looked promising. The backyard was dark, too, which was important. It’s harder to see out from a lighted room when there is no light in the backyard.\\n\\n I stood close to the window and watched. A man and woman were sitting on the bed, taking their clothes off. I watched them. The man wasn’t bad looking but my attention was confined to the woman. I’m not queer, you understand.\\n\\n She certainly wasn’t beautiful. Better than average, though. Her face was nothing to write home about, her breasts were rather small, but she had beautiful legs and a generally nice shape all in all. I watched her undress and began to get excited. This was going to be a good night after all.\\n\\n They undressed quickly, which is not the way I like it. It’s better when they take a good long time about it. But they just pulled off their clothes and turned down the bedcovers. I guess they had been married for some time.\\n\\n I was really excited by this time, and my eyes were practically glued to the window. Then the man stood up and walked over to the wall. He touched a switch, and the room was suddenly plunged into complete darkness. I was so mad I could have killed him. Why did he have to do a thing like that? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-night-stands-and-lost-weekends/page-14.html","bookId":2318,"book":{"id":2318,"title":"One Night Stands and Lost Weekends","description":"Storyline: In the era before he created moody private investigator Matthew Scudder, burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, sleepless spy Evan Tanner, and the amiable hit man Keller—and years before his first Edgar Award—a young writer named Lawrence Block submitted a story titled \"You Can\u0027t Lose\" to Manhunt magazine.
