{"id":9351,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. WHAT MARK OVERHEARD.","content":"\"Now, captain, there are no two ways about it, this business has got to stop, and stop right where it is.\" The speaker was Colonel Harvey, superintendent of the West Point Military Academy. He was sitting in the guardhouse tent of the camp and talking to Captain Quincey. \"Yes,\" he repeated, slapping his leg for emphasis, \"it\u0027s got to stop.\" \"I quite agree with you, colonel,\" responded the other, deprecatingly. \"Quite. But the only question is to find out the offenders.\" \"If the offenders are not found out,\" cried the other, \"I shall punish the whole class until they confess. Discipline shall not be laughed at while I am in command of this academy. And that is just exactly what that matter amounts to.\" \"It certainly does seem,\" admitted the other, \"that the yearling class has such an idea in mind.\" \"Never since I have been here has a class of yearlings dared to celebrate their release from plebehood by such a set of lawless acts. It began the very first night that[Pg 47] the plebes entered camp. I do not know what had been going on before that, but the yearlings had evidently become entirely reckless of consequences, and careless of discovery. They woke the camp by a series of outrageous noises; one of them fired off a gun, I believe.\" \"Lieutenant Allen,\" put in the other, \"told me that he made an investigation on the spot and could find nothing suspicious.\" \"The yearlings had probably seen to it that he wouldn\u0027t. Then night before last Lieutenant Allen, who was again on duty, reported to me personally that he was awakened about midnight by a shout, and going outside of his tent found that about half the cadets had been out of bed and over in Fort Clinton, probably hazing some one. They were all rushing back to camp; he says that it was so dark he could recognize no one.\" \"It is perfectly outrageous!\" exclaimed the commandant. \"It has got to be stopped, too,\" vowed the other. \"That incident of the gun last night capped the climax. I have heard of the cadets playing that prank before, loading one of the guns and firing it at night. But this time they did it for the evident purpose of breaking up the entertainment, and moreover, they fired three so as to make people think it was an alarm of fire. I think myself that[Pg 48] was carrying the matter a trifle too far. And as I said, I propose to see that it is punished.\" The above was meant to be private. Neither the superintendent nor the commandant meant that their conversation should reach any one but themselves. There was one other auditor, however, and it was Mark. He was a sentry and his beat lay by the tent. As he paced up and down every word that was said was audible to him. Early that same morning, after having been spruced up and polished by his friends, he had turned out and received an elaborate set of instructions from a yearling corporal. Now he was putting them into effect during his two hours\u0027 turn \"on guard.\" One of his instructions had been silence. Yet he was only human—and as the angry remarks of the high and mighty Colonel Harvey reached his ears it must be confessed that between chuckles and grins he was far from silent indeed. And a few minutes later when he was relieved from duty till his next turn, he rushed off with unconcealed excitement to his tent. There were three seated therein; and Mark greeted them with a burst of long-repressed merriment. \"Hello, fellows!\" he cried. \"Oh, say, I\u0027ve got the greatest news of the century!\" \"What\u0027s up?\" they inquired eagerly. [Pg 49]\"I thought I\u0027d die laughing,\" responded Mark. \"You know all the tricks we\u0027ve been playing on the yearlings? Well, I just overheard the superintendent talking to the commandant of cadets and he\u0027s blamed it all on the yearlings.\" \"What?\" \"Yes, I heard it. And he may punish them. You see, it\u0027s always the yearlings who have played pranks before. The plebes have never dared. And so the superintendent doesn\u0027t think of blaming us. Isn\u0027t that fine? And, oh, say! won\u0027t the yearlings be mad!\" The Parson arose solemnly to his feet. \"Yea, by Zeus,\" said he. \"Gentlemen, I propose three cheers for the Banded Seven.\" They were given with a will—and in a whisper. \"Wow!\" roared Texas. \"An\u0027 to think that the ole man—Colonel Harvey, if you please—went an\u0027 blamed the firin\u0027 o\u0027 them guns on the yearlin\u0027s! Whoop! Say, didn\u0027t it come out great? It scared the place most blue; an\u0027 that coward, Bull Harris, the feller that wanted to lick Mark when he was tied to a tree, had his ole speech busted up in the middle, too. Whoop!\" \"I think,\" laughed Mark, \"I shall have to go around and carry this news to Grace Fuller.\" That remark started Texas on another speech no less vehement. [Pg 50]\"I tell you, sah, she\u0027s a treasure!\" he vowed. \"Jes\u0027 think of a girl that had sense enough to think up that air scheme fo\u0027 firin\u0027 the gun an\u0027 nerve enough to offer to do it, too. An\u0027 she\u0027s jined with us to bust them ole yearlings. Whoop! It\u0027s all on account o\u0027 Mark, though.\" \"Yea, by Zeus,\" put in the Parson, gravely. \"As I have said before, our friend is much smitten, and she likewise. I do not blame her, since he saved her life.\" A rattle of drums interrupted the conversation just then, summoning the plebes to drill. Mark alone had an hour of leisure, he having been on guard duty, and during that hour having secured a permit, he set out for the hotel in search for the object of all their talk. Grace Fuller was sitting on the piazza as he approached. She was dressed in white and the color just seemed to set off the brightness and beauty of her complexion. She greeted her friend with one of her pleasant smiles that seemed to make every one near her feel happy. \"Come up and sit down,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve been waiting for you all morning. I\u0027m just dying to have some one to talk to about our adventure last night.\" Mark ascended the steps with alacrity and took a seat. And for the next half hour the two talked about nothing else but their glorious triumph, and the way they had fooled everybody, and how mad the commandant was, and how puzzled the cadets. [Pg 51]\"I suppose you noticed,\" said the girl, \"that George was about two minutes late? Well, it seems there were two people sitting on one of the guns, and he didn\u0027t know what to do. He waited and waited, and finally crept up and lit the fuse and ran. The gun went off while those two were sitting on it.\" There was a hearty laugh over this rather ludicrous picture. And then a few moment\u0027s silence, during which the girl gazed thoughtfully into space. \"I\u0027ve got something important to tell you, by the way,\" she said, suddenly. \"Last night the cadets all thought one of themselves had played the joke. Well, it seems that they\u0027ve found out since.\" \"They have! How do you know?\" \"I was talking to Corporal Jasper this morning. Jasper\u0027s a mighty nice boy, only he thinks he\u0027s a man. All the yearlings are that way, so pompous and self-conscious! I think plebes are delicious for a change. I told Mr. Jasper that and he didn\u0027t like it a bit. Anyhow, they must have inquired among themselves and found out that nobody in their class had anything to do with it. For the \u0027corporal\u0027—ahem!—was pretty sure you were the guilty one, and he said the class was mad as hops about it.\" \"That\u0027s good,\" laughed Mark, rubbing his hands gleefully. \"Perhaps we\u0027ll have some fun now.\" [Pg 52]\"You will. That\u0027s just the point. I don\u0027t know that I ought to tell you this, but I didn\u0027t promise Mr. Jasper I wouldn\u0027t, and I suppose my duties as a member of the Seven are paramount to all others.\" \"Yes,\" responded Mark, \"we\u0027ll expel you if you play us false. But don\u0027t keep me in suspense. What\u0027s all this about?\" \"I like to get you excited,\" laughed the girl, teasingly. \"I think I\u0027ll hold off a while so as to be sure you\u0027re interested, so as to make you realize the importance of what I have to say. For you must know that this is a really important plot that I\u0027ve discovered, a plot that will——\" \"I think it is going to rain,\" remarked the cadet, gazing off dreamily into space. \"I hope it will not, because it is liable to damage the corn crop, the farmers say that——\" \"I\u0027ll give up,\" laughed the girl. \"I\u0027ll tell you right away. You are to be on sentry duty to-night, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Yes,\" said Mark, \"I am. I wouldn\u0027t be here now if I were not.\" \"And your post is No. 3, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes! How did you know?\" \"All this is what my small boy friend the corporal told me. You see that my information comes right from head[Pg 53]quarters. I suppose you know that Post No. 3 runs along Fort Clinton ditch.\" \"But what\u0027s that got to do with the plot?\" cried Mark. \"Everything. The plot is to \u0027dump\u0027 you, as the slang has it.\" \"Dump me?\" \"Yes; take away your gun and roll you head over heels into the mud.\" \"Oh!\" responded Mark, thoughtfully, \"I see. Take my gun away and roll me head over heels into the mud. Well, well!\" There was a silence for a few moments after that during which Mark tapped the chair reflectively. \"Are you going to let them do it?\" inquired Grace at last. \"From what you know of me,\" inquired he, \"do you suppose I will?\" \"Hardly.\" \"And I won\u0027t, either. I think the yearlings that try it will have some fun. I only hope there are enough of them.\" \"There will be,\" said the girl. \"There\u0027ll be three.\" \"I\u0027m very glad you told me,\" said Mark, \"very. I\u0027m beginning to perceive that our ally will be a very serviceable ally indeed.\" \"She will be faithful anyway,\" said the girl. \"The[Pg 54] Daughters of the Revolution always are. She has a debt of gratitude to pay to the chief rebel which she will not very soon forget; and she hopes he will not, either.\" Whereupon Mark bowed and arose to take his leave. \"I must get back to camp,\" he explained, \"to tell the Seven about this new plan. We shall find a way to circumvent it, I think; we always do. And I\u0027ll promise you that the yearlings who \u0027dump\u0027 me will have a very lively evening of it. Good-by.\" And Mark left. Now it must be explained that the plebes had lately been given guns. The instruction in marching, halting, etc., which they had gotten in barracks was supplemented by all sorts of evolutions, and by drill in the manual of arms. This latter of course necessitated guns; and great was the joy of the ambitious and warlike plebe on the momentous day that \"guns\" were given out. The guns were regulation army muskets, heavy beyond imagination. So the plebe soon wished he hadn\u0027t wished for them. Besides drilling with them, which he found harder work than digging trenches, he had to clean them daily; and cleaning a gun under the watchful eye of a merciless yearling proved to be a matter of weeping and gnashing of teeth. It had to be done; for he had a number on his gun, so that he couldn\u0027t steal his neighbor\u0027s[Pg 55] well-cleaned one; and if his own wasn\u0027t clean he got into trouble at the very next inspection. Besides the three drills a day, there were other duties galore. There was policing twice a day, \"policing\" meaning the sweeping clean of the acre or two of ground within the limits of Camp McPherson. Then also there was \"guard-mounting.\" Guard-mounting is the daily ceremony of placing the sentries about the camp; the cadets who go on duty then remain until the following morning. This ceremony has already been described within the pages of this series; it will have much to do with our present story. The plebes of course were not put on guard until they had been fairly well trained in other duties. They had to know how to march, halt, salute, present arms, etc. Also they had to be accoutered in their dress uniforms, which were issued about this time. Mark Mallory had been notified to report for guard duty that morning, greatly to the joy of his friends, the Seven, who had rubbed and polished him till he shone. He had \"fallen in\" at the summons and received a long and appalling list of instructions from his corporal. Then he had been put on Post No. 3 for his first tour of duty. The sentries about the camp march for two hours, and then have four hours off duty, thus having eight hours \"on\" in the twenty. During this time they speak to no[Pg 56] one, except to challenge parties who cross their beats. This last duty is where the yearlings have all the fun with the new plebe. \"Deviling\" sentries is an old, old amusement at West Point. The plebe goes on duty, solemn and anxious, awed to silence and gravity by the sternness of his superiors. He is proud of his important office and thoroughly resolved to do his duty, come what may, and to die in the last ditch. He seizes his gun resolutely; feels of the bayonet point valiantly; puts on his sternest and most forbidding look; strides forth with a step that is bold and unwavering. And the yearlings \"don\u0027t do a thing\" to him. What they did to Mark and his friends will be described later on.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88960.html","bookId":641,"book":{"id":641,"title":"On Guard","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, handsome lad, a plebe at the West Point Military Academy.
