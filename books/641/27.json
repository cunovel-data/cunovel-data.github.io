{"id":9372,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. A PLOT TO BEAT \"THE GENERAL.\"","content":"Now the adventures of Texas were wild and exciting, to him, anyway. But up at camp in the meantime another plebe was having adventures that fairly put Texas into the shade. The plebe was \"Indian,\" and you may listen and judge for yourself of the adventures. \\n\\n \\n\\n Indian had been rather less credulous of late, but the yearlings were still anxiously watching for another chance to have some fun with him. The chance came that day. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nelson A. Miles is a hero of a hundred fights, and as major general he commands the United States army. The more they considered the importance of that mighty visitor, the more the yearlings began to think of that plan. There were a dozen of them got together that morning and swore they\u0027d fool Indian or die in the effort. \\n\\n \\n\\n Indian of course had seen the review and had been mightily impressed in his innocent soul. From the distance he had admired the military figure and imposing features of the great man. And then, filled with resolves to fight loyally under him and perhaps some day to be like him, he had turned away and strolled solemnly back to camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 233]He entered his tent, still in that serious, that really heroic mood. There was no one in the tent, and so Indian had it all alone for his meditations philosophical. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, what a fine thing it must be to be a great hero like that!\" he mused. \"To gaze upon the world from a large, ethereal standpoint\"—an ethereal standpoint would have made unsteady standing even for a hero; but Indian did not think of that. \"I can have no higher ambition in life than to imitate that man. As the poet has said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Lives of great men all remind us, \\n\\n We can make our lives sublime, \\n\\n And departing, leave behind us \\n\\n Footprints——\u0027 \\n\\n \"Bless my soul!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indian had stopped his meditations with startling suddenness; and this was the reason thereof. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had heard mysterious sounds in the Company B tent next door. It was a yearling tent. Two cadets had crept into it silently; and Indian heard one of them mutter a subdued \"S-sh!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Have you seen a pointer dog prick up his ears suddenly? That was the way Indian did. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A plot?\" said one of the yearlings. \"A plot did you say? What is it? Tell me? I\u0027ll come in!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"S-sh!\" said the other. \"Do you swear eternal secrecy, swear it by the bones of the saints?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 234]\"I swear!\" growled the other in a low, sepulchral voice. \"Out with it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All the fellows know,\" continued the other. \"They\u0027ll all help. But not the plebes! Do you hear? Not a word to the plebes! If any plebe should hear he\u0027d surely tell on us, and that would ruin us. He might do it, you know, for he\u0027d get no end of reward. They might even promote him, make him a yearling.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indian\u0027s little fat heart was bounding with delight. A plot! And he knew it! Ye gods! Bless my soul! He crept close to the wall of his tent, straining eyes and ears to listen, not to lose the faintest sound of this most important news. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It must be something desperate,\" gasped the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, it is. S-sh! You\u0027ll nearly drop I know when I tell you. We\u0027re——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indian\u0027s eyes were like walnuts, half out of his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027re going,\" continued the yearling, slowly, \"we\u0027re going to beat the general!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Beat the general!\" echoed the other. \"By George, I\u0027ll help! I\u0027m glad of it. I——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indian heard no more. Quietly he had arisen from the tent floor, glancing about like a serpent rearing his glittering head from the grass. He arose; he crept to the tent door; and a moment later he was striding down the street as fast as his little legs could carry him. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 235]So that was the plot! Those wicked and reckless cadets who had hazed him so much were now going to beat the general! The general could, of course, mean only one general, the great general. There was no general at West Point but Major General Miles. \\n\\n \\n\\n Indian never once stopped until he was well out of camp, out of the enemies\u0027 hands. A man with so mighty a secret as that could afford to take no risks; he must lurk in the shadows until he saw his chance to reveal the whole daring conspiracy. Visions rose up before his delighted mind, visions of himself a hero like Mark, congratulated by all, even made a yearling as the cadets had hinted. Indian even imagined himself already as hazing the rest of the plebes. \\n\\n \\n\\n These thoughts in his mind, he was suddenly startled by seeing two yearlings coming near. Were they after him? Indian trembled. Nearer and nearer. No, they had passed him. And then, once more, he heard the words: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, yes! We\u0027re going to beat the general!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! Heavens, suppose some one should find it out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That settled it. Indian sprang up boldly and strode away, determination in his very waddle. He knew! And he would tell! \\n\\n \\n\\n At that moment Indian saw Cadet Fischer crossing the parade ground. Surely, thought Indian, so high and[Pg 236] responsible an officer as this had nothing to do with the plot! Why not tell him? And so at him Indian made a dash. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Fischer! Oh, Captain Fischer!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The officer turned in surprise. Hailed by a common plebe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Fischer!\" gasped Indian. \"Bless my soul! I hear they\u0027re going to beat the general!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said the other. \"In half an hour. But why——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Good heavens, he knew it too! And like a flash, the frightened plebe wheeled and dashed away. There was only one resource left now. He would tell the general himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n Across the parade ground dashed Indian, panting, gasping. Down by the headquarters building, he saw a group of horses standing. One charger he recognized instantly. The general was inside the building, and a moment later a group of officers appeared in the doorway. The handsome, commanding figure in front. Indian\u0027s heart bounded for joy; and then suddenly the amazed General Miles was greeted by a gasping, excited cadet in plebe fatigue uniform. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"General, oh, general! Bless my soul!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The officer stared at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A plot!\" panted Indian. \"Oh, general, please don\u0027t go\"—puff—\"near the camp—bless my soul! A plot!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 237]\"A plot!\" echoed the other. \"A plot! What do you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re going to hurt you—bless my soul!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hurt me! Who?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The cadets, sir! Bless my soul, I—puff—heard them say, they were—puff—oh!—going to b-b-beat the general.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a moment of silence, then a perfect roar of laughter came from the staff officers. The general laughed too, for a moment, but when he saw the plebe\u0027s alarm and perplexity he stopped and gazed at him with a kindly expression. \"My boy,\" he said, \"you\u0027ve been letting the yearlings fool you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fool me!\" echoed Indian in horror. \"Bless my soul!—how?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Beating the general means,\" answered the officer, \"beating the general assembly, which is a drum call.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The officers shook with laughter again, and as for poor Indian, he was thunderstruck. So he had been fooled again! So he had let those mean cadets haze him once more! And—and—— \\n\\n \\n\\n Poor Indian\u0027s eyes began to fill with tears. And he choked down a great big sob. The old officer saw his look of misery. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do they fool you often that way, my boy?\" he asked, sympathetically. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 238]\"Ye—yes!\" answered Indian, at the verge of a weeping spell. \"Ye—yes, th-they do. And I think it\u0027s real mean.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So do I,\" said the general, smiling. \"I tell you how we\u0027ll fix it. Don\u0027t you let on they succeeded.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t help it,\" moaned Indian. \"They know! L-look!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With trembling finger he pointed across the street to where in the shadow of the sally port of the academy stood a group of hilarious yearlings, fully half the class, wild with glee. The general shook his head as he looked, and poor Indian got out his handkerchief as a precaution. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Too bad!\" said the former. \"Too bad, I declare! We\u0027ll have to turn that joke on them somehow or other. Let me see. Let me see. How would you like it for me to help you get square, as you boys say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indian gazed up at the stalwart and kindly form confidingly; he was all smiles in a moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you,\" said the general at last, \"you and I\u0027ll take a walk. And when they see you with me, they\u0027ll be sorry they sent you. Come on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He took the arm of the delighted Indian, who was scarcely able to realize the extent of his good fortune. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll excuse me a short while, gentlemen,\" said General Miles to his military staff. \"I\u0027ll return shortly. And[Pg 239] now,\" to Indian, \"where shall we go? I guess I\u0027ll let you show me about camp.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And sure enough, pinching himself to make sure if he really were awake, Indian, on the arm of the mighty guest of West Point, commander of Uncle Sam\u0027s whole army, marched away up the road past the parade ground and all through Camp McPherson. \\n\\n \\n\\n The general was enjoying the joke hugely, but he affected not to notice it, and plied the plebe with questions. \\n\\n \\n\\n Why did the yearlings haze him so much? Was he B. J.? Oh, it was because he was a friend of Mark Mallory\u0027s, was it! General Miles had heard of Mark Mallory. He was the plebe who had saved the life of the general\u0027s friend, Judge Fuller\u0027s daughter. A beautiful girl that! And a splendid act! Indian had seen it, had he? Colonel Harvey had described it to the general. The general would like to meet Mark Mallory. No, he was not joking; he really would. Mr. Mallory was in hospital, was he? Too bad! Had been too B. J., had he? The general liked B. J. plebes. He hoped Mark was not badly hurt. And—— \\n\\n \\n\\n Then suddenly the conversation was interrupted by a cry of joy from Indian. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s Mark now! He\u0027s out of hospital!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That handsome lad down the street there?\" inquired the general, \"let us go down by all means.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 240]A moment later, Mark, to his great amazement, was confronted by the curiously contrasted pair. Indian was beaming like a sunflower. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Mallory,\" he said, with a flourish, \"allow me to present my friend, General Miles.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark bowed, and the general took the hand he held out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Mallory,\" he said, \"I am proud to meet you. I have heard of what you have done. The service needs such men as you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And the whole corps heard him say so, too. The general had been very careful to say those words in a loud and clear voice that made the camp ring. Then he turned and spoke to an orderly who was passing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell my staff to ride up here for me,\" he said, and added, turning to the two radiant plebes: \"Now, my young friends, I must ask you to excuse me. I am very pleased to have met you both. Good-morning, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Mallory.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With which he turned and strode away up the street again, smiling at the recollection of the incident. And Mark stood and stared at his grinning friend Indian. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said he, \"you blessed idiot, you certainly do beat the Dutch!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then he turned and went into the tent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88981.html","bookId":641,"book":{"id":641,"title":"On Guard","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, handsome lad, a plebe at the West Point Military Academy.
