{"id":9370,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. MARK IN THE HOSPITAL.","content":"\"General Miles here? Who told you so?\" \"I saw him myself. He just got off the train. And there\u0027s going to be a review of the corps and a whole lot of stuff. Don\u0027t you hear those guns. That\u0027s the salute, b\u0027gee!\" Texas and Dewey paused in their excited conversation to listen to the booming of the cannon to the west of the camp. And scarcely had the sound ceased before the roll of a drum was heard coming from the guard tent at the head of the A Company Street. \"That\u0027s the call to quarters, b\u0027gee,\" continued the bearer of the news excitedly. \"I bet we\u0027re going to see some fun, Texas.\" That \"call to quarters\" brought cadets from every direction hurrying into camp to \"spruce up,\" and \"fall in;\" but the two, who were seated on a bench over by Trophy Point, did not even offer to move. For that call to quarters had nothing to do with them; that was for old cadets, the first classmen, and the yearlings. When the battalion turned out for review in honor of[Pg 217] its distinguished guest nobody thought of putting them on exhibition. The two sat looking at the line forming over by camp, and also at a group of figures way down at the other end of the parade ground, a group of blue-uniformed officers, with the West Point band at the head. It was evidently the superintendent and his staff and the distinguished visitor with him. \"Looks as if there\u0027s goin\u0027 to be high jinks roun\u0027 hyar,\" observed Texas. \"It\u0027s a shame Mark ain\u0027t hyar to see it.\" Dewey assented to that emphatically, and Texas after a few moments of moody thoughtfulness, continued: \"Hang them ole cadets!\" he growled. \"It makes me want to git up and slash round some whenever I think of half o\u0027 that whole battalion pitchin\u0027 in to punch a feller, because not one of \u0027em was man enough to lick him in a square, stand-up fight. Tell you, it makes my blood boil! An\u0027 they broke his shoulder, an\u0027 sent him to hospital, an\u0027 he too much of a man to tell on \u0027em at that! The cowards!\" \"That\u0027s what I say, too, b\u0027gee!\" chimed in Dewey. \"Mark\u0027s the spunkiest man that ever they laid eyes on.\" \"That\u0027s what he is,\" growled Texas. \"Jes\u0027 think o\u0027 whar we\u0027d be ef twan\u0027t for him. We\u0027d be lettin\u0027 them cadets haze us, that\u0027s what we would.\" [Pg 218]\"Never mind,\" said Dewey, prophetically. \"Just wait till he\u0027s well again, b\u0027gee! And we\u0027ll stick by him meanwhile.\" \"Will we?\" echoed Texas. \"I couldn\u0027t tell in a thousands years what that aire feller\u0027s done fo\u0027 me. An\u0027 I know one other besides us that\u0027ll stand by him, too.\" \"Grace Fuller, you mean?\" \"That\u0027s what I do! Ever since Mark swam out and near killed himself savin\u0027 her from drownin\u0027 that girl\u0027s been the best friend ever he had. You jes\u0027 ought to go over to the hospital an\u0027 see how she sends him flowers an\u0027 fruit an\u0027 things. They let her in to sit with him an\u0027 talk to him where they won\u0027t let us plebes near him.\" \"B\u0027gee, I don\u0027t blame \u0027em!\" laughed Dewey. \"They\u0027re afraid of you over there, since they had to nurse you after you rode out and \u0027held up\u0027 the artillery squadron at drill. But I tell you, Mark\u0027s in luck to have Grace spooney over him. She\u0027s the most beautiful girl I ever saw, and she\u0027s the belle of this place. I declare I can hardly believe it, that she\u0027s joined with us plebes to fool the yearlings.\" \"She\u0027s jes\u0027 full o\u0027 fun,\" laughed Texas, \"but I reckon the great reason\u0027s cause she\u0027s so fond o\u0027 Mark. I wish I had his luck. I jes\u0027 stand off, \u0027n look at her and wonder s\u0027posin\u0027 \u0027twas me—dog gone it!\" Texas saw an amused smile begin to flit about his com[Pg 219]panion\u0027s merry face; he suspected he was about to \"remind\" that cheerful recounter of a yarn; so he stopped. \"Tell you what,\" he continued after some more thinking. \"I know \u0027nother girl that\u0027s dead gone on Mark.\" \"B\u0027gee!\" cried Dewey in surprise. \"Who\u0027s that?\" \"\u0027Moll\u0027 Adams.\" \"Who on earth is she?\" \"I reckon she came in afore you met us,\" mused Texas. \"Yes, \u0027twas \u0027fore you joined the Banded Seven. You know Bull Harris?\" \"B\u0027gee!\" laughed Dewey. \"Didn\u0027t I lick the cuss once?\" \"That\u0027s so,\" said Texas. \"I forgot. Well, Bull—\u0027twas jes\u0027 like him—was botherin\u0027 this girl down on the road to Highland Falls one day. He had hold of her arm an\u0027 she was fightin\u0027 to git away or somethin\u0027. Anyhow Mark knocked him down, which was the beginnin\u0027 of all this hazin\u0027 business. Bull got all his yearlin\u0027 gang after Mark. After that Mark did her \u0027nother favor, got her brother out of a terrible scrape. An\u0027 I think she\u0027s been mighty fond of him ever since.\" \"B\u0027gee!\" laughed Dewey. \"This is real romantic. What makes you think so?\" \"I\u0027ve seen her hangin\u0027 roun\u0027 the hospital inquirin\u0027 fo\u0027 Mark. An\u0027 I can tell by the way she looks at him. I don\u0027t think she likes to see him so chummy with Grace.\" [Pg 220]\"That\u0027s more romantic yet,\" chuckled Dewey. \"Why don\u0027t Mark care for her?\" \"You see,\" said Texas, \"some o\u0027 the cadets, one of \u0027em a pretty decent feller, a friend o\u0027 Mark\u0027s, told him that she waren\u0027t—she waren\u0027t quite right. She\u0027s somethin\u0027 of a flirt, you know. I don\u0027t like girls that kind much myself an\u0027 I\u0027m sure Mark don\u0027t. He\u0027s kep\u0027 pretty shy o\u0027 her, an\u0027 I kinder think she\u0027s noticed it.\" \"Is she pretty?\" inquired the other. \"She\u0027s mos\u0027 as pretty as Grace,\" responded Texas. \"An\u0027 that\u0027s sayin\u0027 a deal. She\u0027s what you call a brunette—black hair an\u0027 eyes. There\u0027s some girls a feller feels are all right; he feels he\u0027s a better feller when he\u0027s with them. Grace Fuller\u0027s one of \u0027em. She\u0027s jes\u0027 the angel we call her. Then there\u0027s some that ain\u0027t, an\u0027 this girl\u0027s one of them.\" \"Quite a character analysis,\" laughed the other. \"But I guess, b\u0027gee, you\u0027re right, all the same. And speaking of unpleasant characters, there\u0027s that Bull Harris. We haven\u0027t heard from him for a long time.\" \"I reckon,\" said Texas, \"Bull\u0027s been wantin\u0027 to see what the first class\u0027d do to Mark since he\u0027d failed to haze him. I reckon the durty ole rascal\u0027s right well satisfied now.\" \"You don\u0027t love him much,\" observed the other. \"Why should I? Ain\u0027t he tried every mean kid trick he could think of on Mark an\u0027 me, too? He\u0027s all right to[Pg 221] bully girls but when he tried Mark now, he found he\u0027d hit a snag. He\u0027s been doin\u0027 nothin\u0027 ever since but tryin\u0027 to get us into scrapes. An\u0027 I was thinkin\u0027 to-day, \u0027tain\u0027t no lucky sign he\u0027s quiet. I jes\u0027 reckon he\u0027s plottin\u0027 some new durnation trick.\" \"I wish he\u0027d come on with it,\" laughed Dewey. \"Life is getting really monotonous the last two days since Mark\u0027s been in hospital. We\u0027ve been having so many lively and interesting brushes with the cadets, b\u0027gee, that I can\u0027t get along without some excitement at least every day.\" \"I reckon it\u0027ll come soon enough,\" observed Texas. \"An\u0027 they say when you speak of angels they flap their wings. I wonder how \u0027bout devils. There\u0027s ole Bull Harris now, the third feller from the right in the front rank of A.\" \"And he\u0027s going out to salute the general,\" observed Dewey. \"I wish we had another bloodhound now so\u0027s we could put it on his trail the way we did once. B\u0027gee, but he was mad!\" As the two had been talking the battalion had formed on the company ground; roll call had passed quickly, and the cadet adjutant had turned the parade over to the charge of the tactical officer, Lieutenant Allen. The latter\u0027s sharp commands had rung out a moment later and the firmly-stepping lines had swung around and were now[Pg 222] well on their way down the parade ground, at the other end of which stood the famous general and his staff. It was an inspiring moment. The air seemed fairly to shake with the gay music of the band. The cadet\u0027s uniforms and equipments were glittering in the sunlight, their banners waving on the breeze. They wheeled like so many splendid pieces of mechanism and in a few moments more were standing at \"present arms\" in one long line that extended the width of the field. The officers brought their swords up to the salute and the spectators cheered, as a handsome figure rode out from the group of officers and cantered down the line. It was General Miles himself, a fine military figure, striking and imposing. The cadets would have cheered him, too, if they had dared. During this interesting ceremony our two friends of the plebe class had gotten up and started on a run for the scene. They had been so much interested in their discussion of \"Meg\" Adams and Bull Harris that they had forgotten all about watching this. But by the time they got there the review was over, and the cadets had scattered once more. This time to prepare for exhibition drill of the afternoon. The two wandered about disconsolately after that, Texas growling at Dewey for having talked too much.[Pg 223] And then suddenly the former stopped short and stared at his friend. \"I know what I\u0027m going to do!\" he declared. \"What?\" \"I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to see Mark.\" \"I thought they wouldn\u0027t let you in,\" laughed Dewey. \"I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 all the same,\" vowed the other. \"Ef they won\u0027t let me I\u0027ll make \u0027em. Jes\u0027 you watch me!\" And with that the impulsive Texan faced about and set out for the hospital in a hurry.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88979.html","bookId":641,"book":{"id":641,"title":"On Guard","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, handsome lad, a plebe at the West Point Military Academy.
