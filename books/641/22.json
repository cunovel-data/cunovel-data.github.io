{"id":9367,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. MARK RECEIVES A COMMITTEE.","content":"\"Oh, say, Mark, I wish you\u0027d fight that ole cadet! An\u0027 ef you do, jest won\u0027t we whoop her up! Gee whiz!\" \n \n The speaker was Texas. His quiet gray eyes were glistening as he spoke, and his face was alive with excitement. \n \n The two were resting from the morning\u0027s drill, and were lounging about a shady nook in the corner of the siege battery inclosure. Grouped about them, and equally interested in the important discussion were five plebes, the other members of the Banded Seven. \n \n It will be remembered that one of the \"hop managers,\" a first classman and an officer, Cadet Lieutenant Wright, had ventured in behalf of his class to request Mark to leave the floor. Mark, who was in the midst of a dance at the moment, had been justly indignant. He had informed the other that an apology would be demanded; and that as a cadet, having an invitation, he proposed to stay and dance. Whereupon the hop managers had stopped the music and \"busted up their ole hop\" and gone home in a rage. \n \n That was the end of the matter, except that there was a[Pg 184] fight on between Cadet Mallory and Lieutenant Wright. It was to that fight that Texas was alluding. \n \n \"An\u0027 ef you lick him,\" he repeated, \"won\u0027t we whoop her up!\" \n \n \"There will certainly be a fight,\" responded Mark, after a moment\u0027s thought. \"That is, unless Wright apologizes, which he will not do of course. I do not like to fight; I\u0027d a great deal rather get along without it; for it is a brutal sort of an amusement at best.\" \n \n \"Rats!\" growled Texas. \n \n \"But it\u0027s necessary all the same,\" continued the other. \"I do not see how I can keep my dignity otherwise. The notion that a plebe is a creature without any feelings who may be slammed about at will is altogether too prevalent to suit my taste; and I propose to have the cadets understand once and for all that they may haze me all they want to if they can, but that when they insult me they are going to get hurt.\" \n \n \"Bully, b\u0027gee!\" chimed in Dewey, with a chuckle of delight. \n \n \"Do you think you can do him?\" inquired one. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mark. \"And what is more I don\u0027t want to know. If I knew I could whip him I wouldn\u0027t want to fight. I mean to try.\" \n \n \"Wow!\" growled Texas, angry at the mere supposition of Mark\u0027s not being able to thrash any one on earth.[Pg 185] \"Didn\u0027t he whop Billy Williams? An\u0027 ain\u0027t he the best man in the yearlin\u0027 class?\" \n \n \"They said he was,\" said Mark. \"And I had a hard time with him. But Wright\u0027s been here two years longer and is trained to the top notch. He\u0027s stronger than Williams, but I doubt if he\u0027s so quick. And still he\u0027s captain of the football team, which means a good deal, I\u0027ll tell you.\" \n \n \"I wish \u0027twar my chance to fight him!\" exclaimed Texas. \"Say, Mark, you always were lucky.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t even know if he\u0027ll fight yet,\" laughed the other. \n \n \"B\u0027gee!\" chimed in Dewey, \"I think it\u0027s about time you began to think of getting ready to start to send over and find out. Reminds me of a story I once heard, b\u0027gee——\" \n \n \"Good Heavens!\" groaned Mark, with a look of anguish, \"I\u0027ll send at once. Everything I do seems to remind you of something. I\u0027ll send.\" \n \n \"You will, hey?\" laughed Dewey. \"B\u0027gee, that reminds me of another. There was a fellow lived in Kalamazoo, and he——\" \n \n \"You go!\" said Mark. \"I\u0027ll make you my ambassador to keep you quiet. Or at least you can tell your stories to the enemy. Hurry up now!\" \n \n Dewey arose from his seat and prepared to start upon his errand. Texas was on his feet in an instant. \n \n [Pg 186]\"Naow look a yere, Mark!\" he cried. \"Why kain\u0027t I go? I want some fun, too. You wouldn\u0027t let me go that time to Billy Williams!\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t let you go now for the same reason,\" laughed Mark. \"You\u0027d be in a free-for-all fight in half a minute yourself. You go ahead, Dewey. Tell Mr. Wright that I demand an apology or else that he name the time and place. Throw in a few \u0027b\u0027gees\u0027 for good measure, tell him a yarn or two, and make yourself charming and agreeable and handsome as usual. Tra, la, la.\" \n \n Dewey tossed him an effusive kiss by way of thanks for the compliment, and then vaulted over the embankment and set out for camp, marching right merrily to the tune of \"The Girl I Left Behind Me,\" hands at the side, chest out, palms to the front, little fingers on the seams of the trousers! \n \n The remainder of the Banded Seven waited in considerable anxiety for the return of the \"ambassador.\" They were one and all of them interested in their leader and hero; his triumph was theirs and theirs his. \n \n \"He\u0027ll take half an hour, anyway,\" said Mark. \"So there\u0027s no use beginning to get impatient yet. Let\u0027s take it easy.\" \n \n \"Yea, by Zeus!\" said the Parson. \"And in the meantime allow me to call your attention to a most interesting[Pg 187] and as yet unclassified fossil which I unearthed this very morning.\" \n \n The Parson cleared his throat with his usual \"Ahem!\" and Mark cast up his eyes. \n \n \"I wish I had found an embassy for the Parson, too,\" he groaned. \n \n But there was no necessity for Mark\u0027s alarm, as it proved. The Parson had barely time to give a few introductory bits of information about \"the pteroreptian genera of the Triassic and Jurassic periods,\" when the \"Girl I Left Behind Me\" once more made herself audible and Dewey appeared upon the scene, obviously excited. \n \n \"What are you back so soon for?\" inquired Mark. \n \n \"I hadn\u0027t anything to do,\" responded the other, hurriedly. \"Wright wouldn\u0027t see me.\" \n \n \"What! Why not?\" \n \n \"He says there\u0027s a committee from his class coming to see you about it, b\u0027gee.\" \n \n \"A committee!\" echoed Mark. \"I\u0027ve got nothing to do with any committee. It\u0027s my business to challenge him.\" \n \n \"I know. But that don\u0027t make any difference. He wouldn\u0027t talk about it, he just said the committee would see you about it and explain the situation. And to make it more exciting, b\u0027gee, they\u0027re coming now.\" \n \n \"How do you know?\" inquired Mark. \n \n [Pg 188]\"I saw \u0027em,\" answered Dewey, \"and I told \u0027em where you were and, b\u0027gee, they\u0027re on the way in a hurry. Something\u0027s up, b\u0027gee, and I\u0027m going to be right here to see it, too.\" \n \n Dewey dropped into his corner once more, and after that the Seven said nothing, but waited in considerable suspense for the arrival of the distinguished first classmen, wondering meanwhile what on earth they could want and why on earth they found it necessary to interfere in Mark\u0027s quarrel with the officer. \n \n They came, three of them, in due time. The Parson immediately arose to his feet. \n \n \"Hoi presbeis tou Basileos!\" he said in his mist stately tone, and with his most solemn bow. \"That\u0027s Greek,\" he added, condescendingly—to the six; he took it for granted that the learned cadets knew what it was. \"It\u0027s a quotation from the celebrated comedy, the Acharnians, and it——\" \n \n They were shockingly rude, that committee. They paid not the least attention to the Parson and his classical salutation, but instead, after a stiff, formal bow, proceeded right to their business with Mark. The Parson felt very much hurt, of course; he even thought of challenging to a duel at once. But a moment later he found himself listening with rapt attention to the amazing information which that committee had to give. \n \n [Pg 189]Mark did not know the names of the three cadets who confronted him. Their faces were familiar and he knew that they were first classmen. That was evidently all that the committee considered necessary, for they did not stop for an introduction. \n \n All of the Banded Seven\u0027s fun had, up to this point, been manifested against the yearlings, and it had been the yearlings, chiefly, whose wrath they had incurred. But that hop was too much; that had been an insult to every cadet, and Mark knew that he had made new and more powerful enemies. He could see that in the looks of the three stern and forbidding cadets who glared at him in silence, with folded arms. \n \n \"Mr. Mallory,\" said the spokesman. \n \n Mark arose and bowed politely. \n \n \"What is it you wish?\" said he. \n \n \"We have been sent to say a few words to you from the first class.\" \n \n Another bow. \n \n \"In the first place Mr. Mallory, the class instructs us to say that your conduct at the hop the other night deserves their severest censure. You had no business to go.\" \n \n \"As a cadet of this academy,\" responded Mark, calmly, \"I considered it my right.\" \n \n [Pg 190]\"It has not been customary, sir,\" said the other, \"for new cadets to go to the hops.\" \n \n \"Precedent may be changed,\" was Mark\u0027s answer. \"It should be when it is bad.\" \n \n There was a moment\u0027s silence after that and then he continued: \n \n \"Let us not discuss the point,\" he said. \"I always consider carefully the consequences of my acts beforehand. I am prepared for the consequences of this one.\" \n \n \"That is fortunate for you,\" returned the \"committee,\" with very mild sarcasm. \"To proceed however, Lieutenant Wright, one of our hop managers, acting, please understand, in behalf of the class, requested you to leave.\" \n \n \"To continue the story,\" said Mark, keeping up the sarcastic tone, \"I was naturally insulted by his unwarranted act. And I mean to demand an apology.\" \n \n \"And if you do not get it?\" inquired the other. \n \n \"Then I mean to demand a fight.\" \n \n \"Which is precisely what we were sent to see you about,\" responded the cadet. \n \n Mark was a trifle surprised at that. \n \n \"I thought,\" he said, \"that my second should arrange the matter with Mr. Wright\u0027s. However, I shall be glad to fix it with you.\" \n \n \"You will fix nothing with us,\" retorted the other. \"The class has instructed me to tell you that most em[Pg 191]phatically you will not be allowed to fight with the lieutenant.\" \n \n Mark stared at the three solemn cadets in amazement, and Texas gave vent to a muttered \"Wow!\" \n \n \"Not be allowed to fight!\" echoed Mark. \n \n \"No, sir, you will not. Mr. Wright was the class\u0027 delegate; your quarrel is with the class.\" \n \n \"B\u0027gee!\" put in Dewey, wriggling with excitement, \"let\u0027s lick the class, b\u0027gee!\" \n \n Mark was silent for a while, thinking over the strange turn of affairs; and then the committee continued: \n \n \"Mr. Wright will not do you the honor of a fight or of an apology.\" \n \n Mark flushed at that stinging remark. The speaker never turned a hair, but stared at him just as sternly as ever, seeing that his thrust had landed. \n \n Mark had a way of saying nothing when he was angry, of thinking carefully what it would be best to do. And now he gazed into space, his brows knitted, while his six friends leaned forward anxiously, wondering what was coming next. \n \n \"Suppose,\" the plebe inquired at last, \"suppose, sir, I were to force a fight with Mr. Wright?\" \n \n \"If you do,\" said the other, \"the class will take it upon itself to prevent that fight, using brute force if necessary, and punishing you severely for your impertinence. And[Pg 192] moreover you will be required to defend your right to resist their authority, to defend it against every member of the class.\" \n \n \"All at once?\" inquired Mark, with a tinge of irony. \n \n \"No, sir. Separately, and in fair fight.\" \n \n Mark was thoughtful and silent again. \n \n \"The consequences,\" he said, at last, \"are unpleasant. The consequences of swallowing so gross and unmerited an insult as Mr. Wright\u0027s, given before hundreds of people, are more unpleasant still. Dewey!\" \n \n That young man sprang to his feet with an excited \"B\u0027gee!\" \n \n \"Dewey,\" said Mark, in slow and measured tones, and never once taking his eyes off the three stern cadets, \"Dewey, you will return for me, please, to Mr. Wright\u0027s tent. Tell Mr. Wright for me that I demand an apology by this evening—or else that he name a time and place. And tell him finally that if he refuses I shall consider myself unfortunately obliged to knock him down the first time I see him.\" \n \n \"Bully, b\u0027gee!\" \n \n \"Wow!\" \n \n The six plebes had leaped to their feet as one man, with a wild hurrah! Oh, could anything have been better than that? Those three cadets had fairly quailed before Mark\u0027s bold and sudden, yet calm defiance. \n \n [Pg 193]\"I think, gentlemen,\" said he, \"that my purposes are clear to you now. And I bid you good-morning.\" \n \n Half a minute later Mark was buried in the wild embraces and congratulations of his hilarious friends; Texas was dancing a Spanish fandango about the inclosure, and Dewey, red and excited, was on his way to camp as fast as his delighted legs could carry him. \n \n \"B\u0027gee!\" he kept chuckling. \"B\u0027gee, we\u0027ll wipe the spots off of \u0027em, b\u0027gee. Whoop!\" The more excited Dewey got the more b\u0027gees he was accustomed to put in. \n \n He was back again at the Siege Battery ten minutes later, this time even more excited, more red, more breathless than ever. \n \n \"B\u0027gee!\" he gasped. \"I got it. He\u0027ll—he\u0027ll—b\u0027gee, he\u0027ll fight.\" \n \n \"Whoop!\" roared Texas. \n \n \"Yes,\" continued Dewey, \"and b\u0027gee, you can bet there\u0027ll be fun! You see, he wants to fight. He\u0027s no coward, I could see that, and he\u0027s mad as thunder because the class won\u0027t let him. And b\u0027gee, I chucked in a few hints about his being afraid, which made him madder still, so that when I fired out that last part about knocking him down if he didn\u0027t, b\u0027gee, he was wild. Oh, say! He hopped about that tent like—like Texas is doing now—and b\u0027gee he wanted to have it out right away.\" \n \n [Pg 194]\"Whoop!\" roared Texas. \"Let\u0027s go up now! I\u0027ll help! Let\u0027s——\" \n \n \"Sit on him and keep him quiet,\" laughed Mark, shoving Texas into a corner. \"Now go on.\" \n \n \"We couldn\u0027t fight at Fort Clinton, b\u0027gee,\" continued Dewey still gasping for breath, \"because the cadets would have learned. And so finally, b\u0027gee, he said we\u0027d get a boat and cross the Hudson. How\u0027s that?\" \n \n \"When?\" cried Mark. \n \n \"To-morrow morning first thing, b\u0027gee!\" \n \n Texas had escaped by this time and was dancing about once more. And the rest of the Seven were about ready to join him. This was the greatest bit of excitement of all. The most B. J. thing they had ever done, defying the whole first class and going out of cadet limits besides. There never were seven lads more full of fun than these boys; and never had they seen a chance for quite so much fun as in this daring venture. \n \n The seven adjourned for dinner soon after that. As they \"fell in\" on the company street it was evident to Mark that the story of his bold defiance, his desperate stroke, was all about the place even then. It was known to the first class, and to the yearling enemies, and even to the plebes, who stared at him in awe and wondered where on earth he had gotten the \"nerve\" to dare to do[Pg 195] what he had. For Mark Mallory stood pledged by his defiance to fight the whole corps of cadets. \n \n He bore his notoriety easily; he returned the stares of his enemies with cool and merry indifference, and as he cleaned his musket and turned out for drill, or made the dust about the camp fly while on \"police duty,\" there was nothing about him to lead any one to suspect that he was, of all West Point\u0027s plebes and even cadets, the most conspicuous, the most talked of. \n \n The story spread so far that it reached the ears of a certain very dear friend of his. An orderly handed him a note late that afternoon; he knew the handwriting well by this time and he opened the letter and read it hastily: \n \n \"Dear Mr. Mallory: Please come over to the hotel as soon as you can. I have some important news for the Seven, and for you particularly. \n \n \"Your friend, \n \"Grace Fuller.\" \n \n Mark went, wondering what could be \"up,\" and he found that it was about that same all-important affair that Grace wanted to see him. \n \n \"I hear you are going to fight,\" she began as soon as she saw him; there was a worried smile on her face which made Mark smile involuntarily. \n \n \"It\u0027s nothing very desperate,\" he answered. \"So you needn\u0027t be alarmed. You see it\u0027s necessary for me to[Pg 196] fight once in a while else you and I couldn\u0027t play all our beautiful B. J. tricks.\" \n \n \"I guess you\u0027d better go then,\" she laughed. \"But I don\u0027t like it a bit. You\u0027ll come home all bruised up and covered with court-plaster, and I shan\u0027t have anything to do with you until you get handsome again.\" \n \n \"Thanks for that last word \u0027again,\u0027\" responded he with a laugh. Then, he added, more seriously, \"How did you find all this out? I thought none of the cadets were going to speak to you since the hop?\" \n \n \"Pooh!\" said Grace. \"You didn\u0027t suppose they meant that, did you? Half of them are beginning to capitulate already. I knew they wouldn\u0027t hold out.\" \n \n \"I knew it too,\" thought Mark to himself; he was watching the girl\u0027s beautiful face, with its expression of action and life. \n \n \"It seems then that all my rivals are back again,\" he said, aloud. \n \n \"None of them are your rivals,\" answered the girl; and then she added, quickly: \"But that wasn\u0027t what I sent for you to tell you. I have been finding out some more secrets. I think if I keep on practicing on the cadets I\u0027ll be quite a diplomatist and confidence man by and by.\" \n \n \"What have you found out now?\" \n \n \"Simply that the whole first class proposes to keep you from fighting.\" \n \n [Pg 197]\"I knew that before,\" said Mark. \n \n \"Yes,\" answered Grace. \"But you didn\u0027t know that they knew you and Wright were going to cross the river to settle it.\" \n \n \"Do they know that, too?\" cried Mark. \n \n \"They do; and moreover they intend to keep watch on you, and if you leave camp to-night you\u0027ll have the whole class to follow you.\" \n \n Mark looked interested at that. \n \n \"I can see,\" he said, \"that I am going to have no small amount of fun out of this business. I wish you could manage to use a little of your diplomacy in helping me escape.\" \n \n \"And I wish,\" added Grace, gazing at him with the same anxious look he had noticed before, \"I wish I could help you do the fighting too. I hate to think of your being hurt.\" \n \n \"It hurts me to have you look so unhappy,\" said Mark, seriously. \"I can stand the other. As a fighter I don\u0027t think you would make much of a success. This is a case of \u0027angels for council; devils for war.\u0027\" \n \n \"Go ahead,\" sighed Grace, \"if you have to go to hospital I\u0027ll come over and nurse you.\" \n \n Mark took his departure soon after that; he set out for camp, revolving in his mind all sorts of impracticable schemes for outwitting the first classmen that night. His[Pg 198] thoughts were interrupted by hearing his name. He looked up; a cadet was addressing him. \n \n \"Mr. Mallory,\" he said, \"good-afternoon. My name is Harden. Mr. Wright has asked me to be his second.\" \n \n Mark bowed. \n \n \"Also to say that if you will be outside of your tent, dressed, at two to-morrow morning he will have a boat ready to take us to a quiet place.\" \n \n Mark bowed again. \n \n \"Bring one second with you,\" the cadet continued, \"Mr. Wright will have but one. And keep this very secret; tell no one, for the cadets will surely stop us if they learn. Mr. Wright has great doubts of our success anyway.\" \n \n \"I shall do my best,\" answered Mark. \"I am as anxious to succeed as he. And I\u0027m much obliged to you for your trouble.\" \n \n Mark turned away and entered his tent. \n \n \"There\u0027ll be fun to-night,\" he muttered; \"plenty of fun to-night.\" \n \n There was[Pg 199]. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88976.html","bookId":641,"book":{"id":641,"title":"On Guard","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, handsome lad, a plebe at the West Point Military Academy.
