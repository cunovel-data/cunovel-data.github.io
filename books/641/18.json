{"id":9363,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. A STRANGE ANNOUNCEMENT.","content":"\"Hey, fellows! What do you think? Mark Mallory\u0027s in disgrace.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In disgrace!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and he\u0027s going to be fired. Whoop!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The first speaker was Bull Harris. At the moment he was red in the face and breathless as the result of a long run across the parade ground. At the end of it he had burst suddenly into the midst of a crowd of his classmates with the excited exclamation above. \\n\\n \\n\\n The effect upon them of the startling announcement was electrical. To a man they had leaped to their feet, with expressions of delight they made no effort to conceal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you know it, Bull?\" demanded one of the crowd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The superintendent has sent for him right in the middle of drill,\" cried Bull. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What for?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s something he\u0027s been doing. One of the orderlies told me he heard the old man say he\u0027d fire him. And that\u0027s all I know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 150]The babel of confusion and excited voices that resulted from this bit of news lasted without interruption for several minutes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s too good to be true,\" they vowed. \"By George, just as we were talking about him, wondering how we could get square with the confounded plebe, for his tricks! And now he\u0027s going to be fired.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then suddenly Bull\u0027s voice rose above the excitement again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look! Look!\" he cried. \"If you don\u0027t believe me look and see for yourselves. There he goes now!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The cadets stared across the parade ground and then shouted aloud for joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Down on the road by the cavalry plain a single lone figure was walking, a figure clad in the \"plebe\" uniform. And the figure was that of Mallory! \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark as he walked did not observe the group of cadets who were glaring at him so angrily. It would not have worried him if he had, for he had something a good deal more important to occupy his mind just then. He was racking his brains to think of some plausible reason to account for his errand at the moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had been, along with the rest of the plebe company, lined up on one side of the camp for drill. A tactical officer had been rigidly putting them through the manual of arms, with half a dozen yearling corporals[Pg 151] and file closers aiding him. And then, breathless with running, an orderly had burst upon the scene. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had a note in his hand, and he handed it to the \"tac.\" The latter read it, then read it aloud—again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cadet Mallory will report to the superintendent at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That was all; the rest of the class stared and wondered, and Mark stepped out of the line, handed his gun to the orderly, and strode away from the scene. \\n\\n \\n\\n The yearlings, as we have seen, had a good deal clearer notion of why Mark was wanted than he had himself. To Mark it was an absolute mystery. He knew no reason on earth why the superintendent should want him, and he quickened his pace so as to get there and find out the sooner. \\n\\n \\n\\n Erect and firmly stepping as was the plebe\u0027s habit by this time, he marched down the road toward the academy building, between the parade ground and the Cavalry Plain. He passed the chapel, and then the headquarters building, his destination, lay before him. Mark had entered that building just three times before this. He could not help thinking of them then. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first time, he had felt, was the most momentous moment of all his life. Months of struggling were there crowned with a triumph that had seemed to leave no more worlds to conquer. For he had entered that build[Pg 152]ing then to take the oath of allegiance as a duly certified and admitted \"conditional\" cadet. \\n\\n \\n\\n What that had meant to Mark only those who have followed his history can appreciate. Poor and friendless, he had seen West Point as a heaven, the object of all his future hopes, an object far away from his home in Colorado, but one to be struggled for and hoped for none the less. He had earned the money to come by a sudden stroke of cleverness—one step. After that he had striven for the appointment, a step far longer and harder, yet one that must be taken. \\n\\n \\n\\n The congressman of that Colorado district had held a competitive examination. Mark had tried, and also his deadly enemy, one Benny Bartlett, a rather weak, malicious youth, spoiled by the old squire, his father. Benny had sworn to win, and was desperate when he realized he couldn\u0027t; he had bribed a printer\u0027s devil, gotten the examination papers, and so passed ahead of Mark, who was made alternate. But Mark had afterward beaten Benny at the West Point examination, where cheating was impossible, and had thus secured the long coveted cadetship. \\n\\n \\n\\n While we are talking about him he has gone inside. It would be well to stop and follow him, for momentous things were destined to result from that visit, too. It[Pg 153] was indeed true, as the yearlings so joyfully learned, Mark Mallory was in deep and serious danger. \\n\\n \\n\\n An orderly showed him promptly to the office of Colonel Harvey. Mark found that gentleman alone in the room, the same room where he had been received so kindly before. But this time the stern old officer seemed less cordial. There was a chilly air about it all that made the plebe feel rather uncomfortable. Colonel Harvey did not speak; he did not even look up from the paper on which he was writing; and Mark stood by at attention, waiting respectfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first movement did not come from either of them. Mark strove to keep his eyes to the front, which was in accordance with orders. But he could not help glancing about the room a little. And to his surprise he saw a side door open and another figure enter the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark did not see that just at the moment the colonel\u0027s glance was fixed upon him steadfastly; he was too busy staring at the stranger. The stranger was a young fellow with coarse features, evidently a workingman. He twisted his hat in his hand nervously, obviously ill at ease. He stared at Mark and at the officer alternately. Mark, who did not know him from Adam, turned away after the first glance, giving no more thought to the intruder except to wonder what he was doing in that office. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Mark turned his eyes upon Colonel Harvey[Pg 154] again he saw then that the latter was watching him. And a moment later the colonel laid down his pen and spoke: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cadet Mallory,\" he said sternly, \"I wish you to observe this man. Do you know him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark stared at the stranger in amazement. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir,\" he said. \"I never saw him before, to my knowledge.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perfectly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a moment\u0027s pause after that, and then the superintendent tapped a bell upon his desk. It was answered at once. The same door opened again, and two persons entered suddenly. Mark knew them, and he knew them well. He stared at them incredulously, gasping; and he sprang back in amazement. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Benny Bartlett!\" he cried. \"You here! And the squire!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was Benny Bartlett sure enough; Mark knew his sallow deceptive look too well to be mistaken. And the squire was the same stout and blustering, self-assertive old man. He banged his cane on the floor as he heard Mark\u0027s exclamation and saw his look of surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" he cried. \"It is the squire. And I observe you start with guilt when you see him, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark stared at the two all the harder then. And there was a brief silence during which every one stared at every[Pg 155] one else. Mark thought he saw the stranger twist his cap yet more nervously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Mallory,\" began the superintendent at last. \"Mr. Mallory, do you know why these three are here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir,\" said Mark, with evident emphasis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is this upon your honor as a gentleman?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is,\" was the answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Humph!\" snorted the squire. \"Your word of honor isn\u0027t worth much! I——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you please,\" interrupted Colonel Harvey with dignity, \"that question is for me to settle. Mr.—er—what did you say this man\u0027s name was?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nick,\" put in the squire. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nick,\" said the superintendent, turning toward the strange youth, \"will you please have the goodness to tell again the story which you told to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nick looked frightened and hesitated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, come!\" cried the squire, impatiently. \"Out with it now, and no lies about it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus enjoined Nick cleared his throat and began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m a printer\u0027s boy,\" he said, \"and I works for the Roberts in Denver. I was a-walking along the street one day, I was and up comes this feller—indicating Mark—and he says, says he to me, \u0027Your people are printing the examination papers for Congressman Wheeler, ain\u0027t they?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 says I, and then after that a little while he[Pg 156] says that he wants to win them examinations, \u0027cause there was a feller trying \u0027em that he wanted to beat. So he gimme a hundred—that was the next day; he said he\u0027d earned it in a railroad smash up, or something—and then I got them papers and gave \u0027em to him. And that\u0027s all I know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good,\" commented the squire, tapping his cane with approval. \"Very good! And what did he say about these West Point examinations?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He said, says he, \u0027If I win these here and git the appointment, I ain\u0027t a-going to do nothin\u0027 but skin through the others with cribs.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right!\" cried the squire, triumphantly. \"There now! What more do you want?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He glanced at the superintendent inquiringly, and the superintendent gazed at Mark. As for Mark, he was simply too dumfounded to move. He stood as if glued to the spot and stared in blank consternation from one to the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said the colonel at last, \"what have you to say for yourself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark was too amazed to say much. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So that is their plan!\" he gasped. \"So they seek to rob me of my cadetship by this—this——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He stopped then, unable to express his feelings. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 157]\"Colonel Harvey,\" he inquired at last, \"may I ask if you believe this story?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not see, Mr. Mallory,\" was the response, \"what else I am to believe. I do not like to accuse these three gentlemen of a plot to ruin you. And yet—and yet——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May I ask a question or two?\" inquired Mark, noticing the puzzled and worried look upon his superior\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Most certainly,\" was the answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the first place, if you please, according to this story, if I gave this man a hundred dollars, why did he tell about it afterward?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His conscience troubled him,\" cried the old squire excitedly. \"As yours would have if you had any. He knew that he had done wrong, robbed my son, and he came and told me. And I was wild, sir, wild with anger. I have brought this man on all the way from Colorado, and I propose to see my son into his rights, if I die for it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh!\" said Mark. \"So you want Benny made a cadet. But tell me how, if I had the papers, did Benny beat me so badly, anyhow?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My son always was brighter than you,\" sneered the old man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And all the examinations weren\u0027t from printed papers,\" chimed in Benny\u0027s crowing voice. \"There was[Pg 158] spelling, and reading and writing—that was where I beat you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see,\" responded Mark. \"It is a clever scheme. And I\u0027m told I passed here because I cheated; how came you to fail?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My son was sick at the time,\" cried Squire Bartlett, \"and I can prove it, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark smiled incredulously at that; Benny Bartlett nodded his head in support of his father\u0027s assertion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" inquired the squire. \"Is there anything more you want to know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Mark. \"Nothing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Satisfied now, are ye?\" sneered the other; and then he turned to Colonel Harvey. \"I think that is all, sir,\" he said. \"What more do you want?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The colonel stood gazing into space with a troubled look. He did not know what to say; he did not know what to think. He could not call these three men conspirators; and yet the handsome, sturdy lad who had done so much to win his approval, surely he did not look like a thief! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Mallory,\" he inquired at last. \"What have you to say to this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing,\" responded Mark. \"Nothing, except to denounce it as an absolute and unmitigated lie from beginning to end.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 159]\"But what proof can you bring?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"None whatever, except my word.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After that there was no more said for some minutes. The silence was broken by the superintendent\u0027s rising. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Mallory,\" he said, \"you may go now. I must think this matter over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And Mark went out of the door, his brain fairly reeling. He was lost! lost! West Point, his aim in life, his one and only hope, was going! He was to be dismissed in disgrace, sent home branded as a criminal! And all for a lie! An infamous lie! \\n\\n \\n\\n A few minutes later Benny and the printer\u0027s devil, his accomplice, came out of that same door. But it was with a far different look. Benny was chuckling with triumph. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It worked!\" he cried. \"By Heaven, it worked to perfection! Even the old man hasn\u0027t caught on!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Squire Bartlett\u0027s as blind as Mallory,\" laughed the other. \"And Mallory\u0027ll be out in a week. Remember, you owe me that hundred to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88972.html","bookId":641,"book":{"id":641,"title":"On Guard","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, handsome lad, a plebe at the West Point Military Academy.
