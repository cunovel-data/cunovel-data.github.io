{"id":9374,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. STRANGE CONDUCT.","content":"\"Say, fellows, what do you think?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mallory\u0027s given in!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Given in! How do you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s going to let himself be hazed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two more surprised cadets than the two who uttered this last exclamation it would be hard to imagine. They had been sitting on a bench near Trophy Point, and one of them had been carelessly tinkling a mandolin. He had dropped the instrument and leaped to his feet. Now he was staring with open mouth at the new arrival, who bore the extraordinary tidings. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mallory given up! Gus Murray, what on earth do you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The three were yearlings, all of them. The crowd which has usually been designated in these stories as \"Bull Harris\u0027 gang.\" There was Gus Murray, the new arrival, a low, brutal-looking chap. There was the sickly and disagreeable \"Merry\" Vance. And there was the little fellow \"Baby\" Edwards, the meanest of them all. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 251]\"You surely can\u0027t mean,\" cried Vance, \"that Mallory has consented to allow the fellows to haze him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Better than that even,\" chuckled Murray. \"Better than that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For Heaven\u0027s sake,\" gasped the other, \"sit down and tell us what you do mean. What is the use of talking riddles?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus enjoined, Gus Murray explained; he was nothing loath to tell the tale. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you how it was,\" he said. \"I was never more astounded in my life. I saw that plebe strolling down the street a while ago, holding his head high as ever and looking as if he owned the place.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Confound him!\" muttered Vance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know,\" the other continued, \"he\u0027s never done any work like the rest of the plebes. Usually we yearlings make them fix our tents and guns, and carry water, and so on. Mallory never has, and of course nobody\u0027s succeeded in making him. I thought I\u0027d guy him a little just now and see how he\u0027d take it. So I stopped and said, \u0027See here, plebe. Let me show you how to clean a gun.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what did he say?\" cried Vance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just as B. J. as ever,\" growled Murray. \"\u0027Thank you,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027ll go get mine and let you do it.\u0027 Of course he knew perfectly well that I wanted to show him[Pg 252] on mine and let him do the work. I said to him, \u0027I\u0027ve a gun to show you on, if you please.\u0027 And by George——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t mean he cleaned your gun for you!\" gasped Baby. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s just exactly what I do! You might have knocked me over with a feather. He said, \u0027Certainly, sir.\u0027 Yes, by jiminy, he actually said \u0027sir.\u0027 And when I left him he was working away like a beaver. He had the gun half cleaned. What do you think of that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gus finished and gazed at his two companions triumphantly. He felt that he had accomplished something that no other member of his class ever had. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bet Mallory was afraid of you,\" chirruped Baby Edwards. \"Don\u0027t you suppose that\u0027s it, Merry?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Vance picked up his mandolin and resumed his cynical smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what I think,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What?\" demanded Murray. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That you\u0027re a fool.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Simply,\" said Vance, \"that Mallory was playing some kind of a joke on you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he wasn\u0027t!\" cried the other. \"I went back after he was through and the gun was perfect. The wood was polished till it shone like a mirror. I actually did not like to touch it, it was so pretty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 253]\"And how about the rest of the tent?\" inquired Vance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He hadn\u0027t disturbed a thing. I looked particularly. I tell you, man, that Mallory has given in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s not much like him,\" said Merry, dubiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to look very far for the cause,\" began Murray. \"You remember how the first class gave him a licking the other day?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Vance admitted that might have something to do with it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s got everything,\" chuckled Murray. \"It\u0027s simply broken his spirit. Why look, man! He was black and blue all over. Even now one of his arms is in a sling. I tell you he\u0027s made up his mind that it isn\u0027t safe to carry on as he\u0027s been, and so he\u0027s decided to get meek and mild for a change.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And, oh, say, if it\u0027s true!\" cried Baby, excitedly. \"If it\u0027s true! Gee whiz, won\u0027t we have some fun!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just won\u0027t we!\" responded Murray, doubling up his fists and glaring as if the hated plebe were really in front of him. \"I just tell you I mean to make him wish he\u0027d never been born. I\u0027ve been waiting for a chance to get even with that confounded beast, and now I\u0027ll have him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For the next half hour there was joy unbounded among those three young gentlemen. Only those who are familiar with their dispositions can comprehend the amount of satisfaction they felt; and only those who know our[Pg 254] friend Mark Mallory\u0027s character as they did can appreciate their surprise at his \"flunk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish Bull were here to hear about it,\" remarked Baby at last. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is Bull anyhow?\" inquired Murray, who was chief lieutenant in Bull\u0027s gang and an invaluable assistant in all of Bull\u0027s schemes for revenge upon Mark. \\n\\n \\n\\n That question changed the topic of conversation for a few minutes. It was Vance who answered it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s something mysterious about Bull,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve been puzzling my head to think what it means. You know Bull was absent from taps last night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, he was. And you know that\u0027s a pretty serious offense. It may mean court-martial, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good gracious!\" gasped Baby. \"What would we do without Bull?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess we won\u0027t have to,\" laughed Vance. \"You needn\u0027t begin to worry. I was corporal of the guard last night when Bull came in to report. It was way after eleven.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where on earth had he been?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t tell me. He was very mysterious. It seems that he had been in the water somehow and was soaking wet; all I could get out of him was that the business had something to do with Mary Adams.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 255]\"Mary Adams!\" cried Gus. \"I thought she wouldn\u0027t speak to him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know,\" said Vance. \"That was what Bull told me. Anyhow he didn\u0027t seem a bit alarmed about his absence.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The superintendent sent for him this afternoon,\" put in Murray. \"I suppose that was to give him a chance to explain the matter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and I saw Bull with Mary a while ago,\" added the other, shrewdly. \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder if Bull were getting up some scheme. He hasn\u0027t said much about Mallory to-day. He\u0027s been very mysterious.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The mystery, whatever it was, was destined to remain unsolved, however, for just then the rattle of a drum echoed across the field, and the three sprang up hastily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s dress parade,\" said Murray. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" responded Vance, dryly. \"And now you\u0027ll have a chance to show off that beautifully cleaned gun of yours. Come on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88983.html","bookId":641,"book":{"id":641,"title":"On Guard","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, handsome lad, a plebe at the West Point Military Academy.
