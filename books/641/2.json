{"id":9347,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. MARK\u0027S IDEA.","content":"The yearling corporal who did the inspecting had done his criticising and gone his way, leaving four of the seven in their tent—Mark, Texas, the Parson and Sleepy—who, being the tallest, had been assigned to Company A. And the four sat down to await the signal to \"fall in\" for drill. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I reckon, Mark,\" said Texas, meditatively surveying his new uniform in the looking-glass. \"I reckon that we fellows kin say that hazing\u0027s most over now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Assuredly!\" said the Parson, gravely, \"for indeed we have completely broken the spirit of the enemy, and he knows not which way to turn. I think that, in words of the song of Miriam, we may say: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Sing, for the sword of the tyrant is broken! \\n\\n His chariots and horsemen are rent in twain.\u0027 \\n\\n \"Yea, by Zeus!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Parson said this with his usual classic solemnity. Mark smiled to himself as he sat down upon the locker and gazed at his friends. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got something to tell you fellows,\" said he. \"I think now\u0027s about as good a time as any. I haven\u0027t said[Pg 16] anything about it to the crowd yet. When I do they\u0027ll have their eyes opened, and realize that if we\u0027re going to subdue the yearlings, we\u0027ve got to start right at it all over again. We\u0027ve scarcely begun yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The three others looked at him in surprise; Texas rubbed his hands gleefully, seeing that Mark\u0027s statement, if true, meant lots more fun for the future. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You remember last night,\" Mark continued, \"about midnight, how the Parson shouted out in his sleep and woke the whole camp?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" added Texas, \"and scared me to death. I thought I was down home and the ole place was being run in by rustlers or somethin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You met me at the door of the tent,\" Mark went on. \"I didn\u0027t tell you where I\u0027d been; I\u0027ll tell you now. Last night a dozen or two of the yearlings took me out of camp—they surprised me, and held me so that I couldn\u0027t move. They tied me to a tree, and were just on the point of beating me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The three were staring at Mark in unutterable amazement. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Mark. \"They told me I\u0027d either have to promise to be a milk-and-water plebe after this or else be licked until I would. And Bull Harris took a big rope and——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 17]\"Did he hit ye?\" cried Texas, springing to his feet excitedly. \"Wow! I\u0027ll go out an\u0027 I\u0027ll——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sit down!\" said Mark. \"He didn\u0027t hit me, for the Parson yelled just then and scared \u0027em all back to camp. And you needn\u0027t tackle Bull anyhow, for I\u0027m going to do that myself pretty soon. The point just now is that the yearlings haven\u0027t given up. They\u0027re still fighting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know there were so many cowards in the place!\" muttered Texas. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re desperate,\" said Mark. \"They\u0027ve got to do something. Now we\u0027ll watch out for such surprises the next time, and meanwhile we\u0027ll show them that we\u0027re determined not to stop.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And Mark saw by the faces of the other three that that was just what they wanted. Texas especially was twitching his fingers nervously and looking as if he were wishing for some yearling to tackle right then and there. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you what we\u0027ll do, Mark,\" he broke out, suddenly. \"We\u0027ll tie ourselves together an\u0027 sleep that way, an\u0027 then if they take one they\u0027ll have to take all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s quite an idea,\" said the other, laughing. \"But the main point now is just this: We\u0027re to set out with only one idea in our heads to think of; perhaps it might be well to offer a prize to the fellow who thinks of the best scheme. We want to keep those cadets fairly on the jump from the start.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 18]\"Bully!\" cried Texas. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And it seems to me, moreover,\" continued the leader, \"that we make a big mistake if we let this day pass without doing something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yea, by Zeus!\" vowed the Parson, his solemn face glowing with interest. \"For this day is the day of all days in the calendar of Freedom. This day is the day when our immortal colonies did vow and declare that the dragon of tyranny they would trample beneath their feet. This day is the day when first the eagle screamed, when humanity cast off its fetters and stood in the light of God\u0027s truth. This day is the glorious Fourth of July!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Parson had arisen to his feet, the better to illustrate the casting off of the fetters, and his long black hair was waving wildly and his long white arms yet more so. Boston and Boston \"liberty\" were dangerous topics with him; he got more excited over them than he did when he found his immortal cyathophylloid coral \"in a sandstone of Tertiary origin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yea, by Zeus!\" he continued. \"Such are the auspices, the hallowed recollections of this immortal moment that I verily believe no revolution can fail on it. I say that if ever we strike boldly, we do it to-day. And I, as a citizen of Boston, pledge my aid to any plan.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yaas. An\u0027 we got a half holiday to-day, tew.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This rather prosaic peroration to the Parson\u0027s speech[Pg 19] came from one corner, where Sleepy sat lazily regarding the scene. That was the first hint that the \"farmer\" had offered, and it had corresponding weight. The four shook hands on it then and there, that by the time dinner was over they would have a brand new and startling plan to work for the yearlings\u0027 edification. The signal to fall in for drill found them still pledging themselves to that. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark said nothing more to any one upon the subject; he left his friends to think for themselves, and he, when he got a chance, started out likewise on his \"own hook.\" In the first place, it was necessary to find out just how the yearlings meant to spend that half-holiday afternoon; having found that, it would then be time to think up a plan for spoiling the fun. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a member of the plebe class who had been a plebe the year before, that is, who had failed on examinations and had not been advanced. Naturally, he knew all the yearlings, and, having been through camp once, knew also what would be apt to happen on the Fourth of July. Mark himself knew nothing about it, for no one thought it necessary to tell plebes about such things; and so to this \"hold-over\" Mark went to learn. \\n\\n \\n\\n That gentleman, in response to some diplomatic interrogation, emitted the information that there was nothing \"on.\" That a ball game had been intended, but prevented at the last moment. That probably most of the[Pg 20] cadets would go walking, or amuse themselves any way—some of them do a little hazing. That it was a pleasant custom to make the plebes dress up in masquerade and give a parade or something. And that finally there was to be an entertainment in the evening. \\n\\n \\n\\n What sort? Well, it was dignified and patriotic. There were programmes issued—not given to plebes, of course. Would Mallory like to see one? Perhaps he could get one, would see after drill, etc., etc. \"Much obliged. Good-morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The affable young gentleman did manage to get Mallory a programme. He gave it to him just before dinner. \"Thank you.\" \"Oh, not at all, only too glad to oblige you,\" etc. And Mark rushed into the tent and eagerly read the handsomely printed pasteboard: \\n\\n \\n\\n United States Military Academy. \\n\\n July 4th, 8.30 P. M. \\n\\n PROGRAMME. \\n\\n Overture. \\n\\n Prayer. \\n\\n Music. \\n\\n Reading of The Declaration of Independence. \\n\\n Cadet George T. Fischer, Pennsylvania. \\n\\n Music. \\n\\n Oration. \\n\\n Cadet Edmund S. Harris—— \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark read not another word; he stared at the paper in[Pg 21] amazement and incredulity, rapidly changing to glee. Harris! Bull Harris delivering an oration! Mark turned and faced his companions, feeling about ready to burst with hilarity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen here, fellows!\" he cried. \"Here\u0027s a chance, a chance of a lifetime! Oh, say! Bull\u0027s going to make a speech! Gee whiz! We\u0027ll——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t you fellows know about that?\" put in a voice in the doorway, as Dewey\u0027s face appeared there. \"I heard the yearlings talking about it. They say Bull\u0027s a fine orator, that he\u0027s been working at an elegant speech for months. And, b\u0027gee, he means to bring down the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mark\u0027s face was simply a picture of merriment at that. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fellows,\" he said, as soon as he could manage to get breath to say anything at all. \"Fellows, I\u0027ll go you just one bargain more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is it?\" cried the others. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s very simple. It\u0027s just that we spoil that beautiful speech of Bull Harris\u0027, if we have to bust to do it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And the seven cried \"Done!\" in one breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88956.html","bookId":641,"book":{"id":641,"title":"On Guard","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, handsome lad, a plebe at the West Point Military Academy.
