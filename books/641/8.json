{"id":9353,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. THE ATTACK ON MARK.","content":"There was confusion indescribable in a moment; cadets rushed out of their tents, and every one who chanced to be in the neighborhood started on a run for the scene of the trouble, most of them just in time to see the figure of the frightened plebe flying down a company street to the guard tent. Indian\u0027s hair was sailing out behind, his eyes were staring and his cheeks bulging with fright. \n \n In response to the first yell, Lieutenant Allen, the tactical officer in charge, had rushed to the tent door, followed by the corporal of the guard, the officer of the day, and a host of other cadet officials. The figure in blue, however, was the only one the plebe saw. That meant an army officer and safety for him. So to that figure he rushed with a gasp of fright. \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" cried Lieutenant Allen. \n \n \"Dynamite, sir, anarchists!\" \n \n \"What!\" \n \n \"Yes, sir, oh, please, sir, bless my soul, sir, I saw it, sir—puff—oh!\" \n \n It took the amazed officer several moments to take in the situation. \n \n [Pg 66]\"Anarchists,\" he repeated. \"Dynamite! Why, what on earth?\" \n \n And then suddenly the whole thing flashed across him. It was another prank of the yearlings! And, what was worse, a thousand times worse, here was a sentry off his beat, in direct violation of his orders of all military law. \n \n \"Didn\u0027t you receive a command, sir,\" he demanded severely, \"not to leave your post for any reason whatsoever? Don\u0027t you know that in time of war your offense would mean hanging?\" \n \n \"Bless my soul, sir!\" gasped the sorely perplexed plebe, frightful visions of gallows rising up before his bulging eyes. \"Yes, sir—er—that is, no, sir—bless my soul! They\u0027re going to attack the place!\" \n \n The officer gazed at the lad incredulously for a moment; he thought the plebe was trying to fool him. But that look on Indian\u0027s face could not possibly be feigned; and the officer when he spoke again was a trifle more consoling. \n \n \"Don\u0027t you know, my boy,\" he said, \"this is all a joke? It was not real dynamite.\" \n \n \"Not real dynamite!\" cried the other in amazement. \"Why, I saw it! It——\" \n \n \"It was the yearlings trying to fool you,\" said the lieutenant. \n \n \"Yearlings trying to fool me!\" echoed the other as if[Pg 67] unable to grasp the meaning. \"Why—er—bless my soul! Yearlings trying to fool me!\" \n \n The thought filtered through gradually, but it reached Indian\u0027s excited brain at last. The change it produced when it got there was marvelous to behold. The look of terror on his face vanished. So he had been fooled! So he had let the yearlings outwit him! Yearlings—his sworn enemies! And he a member of the Banded Seven at that! It was too awful to be true! It was—— \n \n And then suddenly before Lieutenant Allen could raise a hand or say a word the plebe wheeled, sprang forward and tore back down the company street. \n \n There was a look on Indian\u0027s face that his friends had seen there just once before. The yearlings had tied him to a stake that day to \"burn\" him, and they had set fire to his trousers by accident. Indian had broken loose, and it was then that the look was on his face, a look of the wildest fury of convulsive rage. Now it was there again, and Indian was too mad to speak, almost too mad to see. \n \n He rushed down the street, he tore in between two of the tents and burst out upon the path where the sentry beat lay. It was dark and he could see little, but off to one side he made out a group of cadets. He heard a sound of muffled laughter. Here were his tormentors! Here! And with a gasp and gurgle of rage Indian plunged into the midst of them. \n \n [Pg 68]After that there was just about as lively a time as those yearlings had ever seen. Indian\u0027s arms were windmills and sledge hammers combined, with the added quality of hitting the nail on the head every time they hit. The result ten eyes could not have followed, and as many pens could not describe it. Suffice it to say that the plebe plowed a path straight through the crowd, then whirled about and started on another tack. And that a few moments later he was in undisturbed possession of his post, the yearlings having fled in every direction. \n \n Then Indian picked up his musket, shouldered it, and strode away down the path. \n \n \"I guess they\u0027ll leave me alone now,\" he said. \n \n They did. Indian marched courageously after that, his head high and his step firm, conscious of having done his duty and signally retrieved his honor. \n \n Pacing patiently, he heard tattoo sound and saw the cadets line up in the company street beyond. He heard the roll call and the order to break ranks. He saw the cadets scatter to their tents, his own friends among them. Indian knew that it was half-past nine then and that he had but half an hour more. \n \n As he marched he was thinking about Mark. He was wondering if the yearlings had had the temerity to try their \"dumping\" so early in the evening. And he wondered, too, if Mark had prevailed, and if he had dared to[Pg 69] put into execution the daring act of retribution he had planned. \n \n Mark meantime was also walking his post, over on the other side of the camp. He had marched there in silence and solitude since eight. He, too, had heard tattoo; he had seen his five friends enter their tents which lay very close to his beat, and he had nodded to them and signaled that all was well. \n \n Time passed rapidly. He saw the cadets undressing, saw most of them extinguish their lights and lie down. And then suddenly came a roll upon the drum—ten o\u0027clock—\"lights out and all quiet.\" And at the same moment he heard the clank of a sword, and the tramp of marching feet coming down the path. It was the relief. \n \n They left another sentry there in Mark\u0027s stead and marched on around the camp, picking up the others. Among these was the weary fat Indian, who joined them with a sigh that it is no pun to call one of \"relief.\" A few minutes later they were in the guard tent, where Indian learned that the attack had not yet come, at which he sighed again. \n \n Cadets who are members of the guard sleep in the big \"guard tent,\" which is situated at the western end of the camp. Here they can be awakened and can fall in and join the relief when their time comes without disturbing the rest of the corps. Mark and Indian did not go[Pg 70] on duty again until two o\u0027clock in the morning, and so they \"turned in,\" in no time and were soon fast asleep. \n \n When they are awakened again we shall follow Mark to \"Post No. 3.\" Nothing more was done to poor Indian that night. \n \n It was the \"corporal of the relief,\" who touched Mark on the shoulder and brought him out of the land of dreams. He sprang up hastily and began to dress; cadets sleep in their underclothing, so that they may be ready to \"fall in\" promptly, all dressed in case of an emergency. Mark, gazing about him, saw a big white tent, with sleeping forms scattered about it. A yawning cadet officer sat at a table, a candle by his side. And five other sentries, about to go \"on\" like himself, were sleepily dressing. \n \n Promptly at the minute of two the six fell in, in response to the low command of the corporal. At the same time the sentry\u0027s call of the hour sounded: \n \n \"Two o\u0027clock and all\u0027s well!\" \n \n And then out into the cold night air marched the six and away to their posts of duty. There was a bright moon and the whole camp was light as day as they marched. At number three, in response to the corporal\u0027s order, Mallory fell out. And then \"Forward, march!\" and away down the dim vista of trees swept the rest and around a turn and were gone. Mark Mallory was alone, waiting for the enemy. \n \n [Pg 71]He was not afraid. He had made up his mind as to what he should do, and now he was here to do it. He realized that from the very first moment he set foot on this post, the word must be vigilance, vigilance! And he gritted his teeth and set his square, sunburned jaws and seized his rifle with a grip of determination, striding meanwhile on down the path. \n \n He had not gotten halfway down to the end, the tramp of the relief was still in the air, when suddenly came a low, faint whistle. Mark was expecting that, and he faced about, started off the other way. He heard a faint sound of hurrying feet and knew that his friends, the five, had crossed. He saw shadows flitting in the deep grass of the ditch beside him and knew that they were scattering to hide and wait in accordance with the agreement. And he set his teeth with a still more grinding snap and strode on. Vigilance, vigilance! \n \n The moon was high in the heavens by this time; one could almost have seen to read. \n \n \"They won\u0027t dare to try it,\" thought Mark. \"A snake couldn\u0027t creep up on me now. They\u0027ll have to come from the camp, too, for they can\u0027t cross any sentry beat. But I\u0027ll watch, all the same.\" \n \n His heart was beating fast then, he could almost regulate his step by it. Outside of that all was ghostly and silent, except for the breathing of the sleepers in the[Pg 72] nearest tents of Company A. Once, too, he heard the distant roar of a train as it whirled down the river valley, and once the faint chug chug of a steamboat that passed on the water. But for the most part the camp was unbroken in its peacefulness. \n \n Tramp, tramp. Down the path to the sentry box, right about, and back again. His post—number three—extended from the upper end of the colorline on which two and six were marching, down along the north side of the camp skirting the tents of Company A—his own—with the deep ditch of Fort Clinton right to the left, past the tent of Fischer, the first captain, and that of the adjutant, and ending near the water tank. Tramp! tramp! \n \n It was just a few minutes more before the corporal of the relief came around, testing the sentries\u0027 knowledge of the orders of the night. Later still came the cadet officer of the guard, with a clank of sword; and he passed on, too. Tramp, tramp. And still no sign of trouble. Mark\u0027s challenge, \"Who comes there?\" had been heard but once, and that by the corporal. \n \n \"Will they try it?\" he thought. \"Now\u0027s the time. Will they try it?\" \n \n The answer came soon. Peering ahead with the stealthiness of a cat, glancing back over his shoulder every minute, watching every moving shadow, listening for every faintest sound. Tramp, tramp. Eastward[Pg 73] toward the river; he reached the water tank, where the shade was the thickest, where stood the only bushes that could conceal a lurking foe. Opposite the tent of the bootblack he halted and started back again, where the path lay clear in the moonlight. Tramp, tramp. He could see number two, far down in the distance, his white trousers glistening as he marched. He saw the shadows of the trees waving, he heard the breathing of the sleepers. \n \n Then suddenly came the attack. There was a quick step behind him, and everything grew dark. A cloth was flung about his mouth, and two pair of hands about his writhing, sinewy body. Down he went to the ground, fighting with every ounce of muscle that was in him. And after that there was fun to spare. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88962.html","bookId":641,"book":{"id":641,"title":"On Guard","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, handsome lad, a plebe at the West Point Military Academy.
