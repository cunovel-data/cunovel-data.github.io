{"id":67587,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"Detective Max Hornung was thinking. The detective bureau was filled with the noise of typewriters clattering, voices raised in argument, telephones ringing, but Hornung saw and heard nothing of these things. He had the single-minded concentration of a computer. He was thinking about the charter of Roffe and Sons, as old Samuel had set it up, keeping control within the family. Ingenious, Max thought. And dangerous. It reminded him of the tontine, the Italian insurance plan devised by the banker Lorenzo Tonti in 1695. Every member of the tontine put in an equal amount of money, and as each member died, the survivors inherited his share. It provided a powerful motive to eliminate the other members. Like Roffe and Sons. It was too much of a temptation to let people inherit stock worth millions, and then tell them they could not sell it unless everyone agreed. Max had learned that Sam Roffe had not agreed. He was dead. Elizabeth Roffe had not agreed. She had narrowly escaped death twice. Too many accidents. Detective Max Hornung did not believe in accidents. He went to see Chief Inspector Schmied. The chief inspector listened to Max Hornung\u0027s report on Sam Roffe\u0027s climbing accident and growled, \"So there\u0027s been a mix-up about the name of a guide. That hardly constitutes a case for murder, Hornung. Not in my department, it doesn\u0027t.\" The little detective said patiently, \"I think there\u0027s more to it. Roffe and Sons is having big internal problems. Perhaps someone thought that getting rid of Sam Roffe would solve them.\" Chief Inspector Schmied sat back and eyed Detective Hornung. He was certain that there was nothing to his theories. But the idea of having Detective Max Hornung out of sight for a while filled Chief Inspector Schmied with a deep pleasure. His absence would be a boost to the morale of the entire department. And there was something else to consider: The people Max Hornung wanted to investigate. No less than the powerful Roffe family. Ordinarily, Schmied would have ordered Max Hornung to keep a million miles away from them. If Detective Hornung irritated them - and how could he not! - they had enough power to have him thrown off the force. And no one could blame Chief Inspector Schmied. Hadn\u0027t the little detective been forced on him? And so he said to Max Hornung, \"The case is yours. Take your time.\" \"Thank you,\" Max said happily. As Max was walking through the corridor toward his office, he ran into the coroner, \"Hornung! Can I borrow your memory for a minute?\" Max blinked. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"The river patrol has just fished a girl out of the river. Will you take a look at her?\" Max swallowed and said, \"If you wish.\" This was not a part of the job that Max enjoyed, but he felt that it was his duty. She lay in the impersonal metal drawer in the chill of the morgue. She had blond hair and was in her late teens or early twenties. Her body was bloated from the water, and naked, except for a red ribbon knotted around her neck. \"There are signs of sexual intercourse just before death. She was strangled and then dumped into the river,\" the coroner said. \"There\u0027s no water in her lungs. We can\u0027t get any fingerprints on her. Ever seen her before?\" Detective Max Hornung looked down at the girl\u0027s face and said, \"No.\" He left to catch his bus to the airport.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline/page-35.html","bookId":2356,"book":{"id":2356,"title":"Bloodline","description":"Storyline: Sheldon\u0027s sweeping saga of greed and betrayal, sabotage and danger, and the ties that can kill...
