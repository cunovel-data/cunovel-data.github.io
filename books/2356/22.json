{"id":67574,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Hamburg.\\n\\n Friday, October 1.\\n\\n Two a.m.\\n\\n The wind was blowing from the sea, and the early-morning air was chill and damp. In the Reeperbahn section of Hamburg the streets were crowded with visitors eager to experience the forbidden pleasures of the city of sin. The Reeperbahn catered to all tastes impartially. Drinks, drugs, girls or boys - they were all available at a price.\\n\\n The garishly lighted hostess bars were on the main street, while the Grosse Freiheit featured the lewd strip shows. The Herbertstrasse, one block away, was for pedestrians only, and both sides of the street were lined with prostitutes sitting in the windows of their flats, displaying their wares through flimsy soiled nightgowns that concealed nothing. The Reeperbahn was a vast market, a human butcher shop, where you could select any piece of meat you could afford to pay for. For the straitlaced there was simple sex, missionary style; for those who enjoyed a bit of variety there was cunnilingus and analingus and sodomy. On the Reeperbahn you could buy a twelve-year-old boy or girl, or get into bed with a mother and daughter. If you tastes ran that way, you could watch a woman being serviced by a Great Dane, or get yourself whipped until you achieved orgasm. You could hire a toothless crone to perform fellatio on you in a busy alley or buy yourself an orgy in an elaborately mirrorer bedroom with as many girls or boys as your libido required. The Reeperbahn prided itself on having something for everyone. Younger whores in short skirts and tight-fitting blouses cruised the pavements, propositioning men, women and couples impartially.\\n\\n The cameraman walked down the street slowly, the target for a dozen girls and brightly rouged boys. He ignored them all until he came to a girl who looked to be no more than eighteen. She had blond hair. She was leaning against a wall, talking to a girl friend. She turned as the man approached, and smiled. \"Would you like a party, liebchen? My friend and I will show you a good time.\"\\n\\n The man studied the girl and said, \"Just you.\"\\n\\n The other girl shrugged and moved off.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your name?\"\\n\\n \"Hildy.\"\\n\\n \"Would you like to be in the movies, Hildy?\" the cameraman asked.\\n\\n The young girl studied him with cold eyes. \"Herr-gott! You\u0027re not going to give that old Hollywood Scheiss?\"\\n\\n He smiled reassuringly. \"No, no. This is a genuine offer. It\u0027s a porno film. I make them for a friend of mine.\"\\n\\n \"It will cost you five hundred marks. In advance.\"\\n\\n \"Gut.\"\\n\\n She regretted instantly that she had not asked for more. Well, she would find some way to get a bonus out of him. \"What do I have to do?\" Hildy asked.\\n\\n Hildy was nervous.\\n\\n She lay sprawled out naked on the bed in the small, shabbily furnished apartment, watching the three people in the room, and thinking, There\u0027s something wrong here. Her instincts had been sharpened on the streets of Berlin and Munich and Hamburg. She had learned to rely on them. There was something about these people she did not trust. She would have liked to have walked out before it started, but they had already paid her five hundred marks, and promised her another five hundred if she did a good job. She would do a good job. She was a professional and she took pride in her work. She turned to the naked man in bed beside her. He was strong and well built; his body was hairless. What bothered Hildy was his face. He was too old for this sort of film. But it was the spectator who sat quietly at the back of the room who disturbed Hildy the most. The spectator wore a long coat, a large hat and dark glasses. Hildy could not even tell if it was a man or a woman. The vibrations were bad. Hildy fingered the red ribbon tied around her neck, wondering why they had asked her to wear it. The cameraman said, \"All right. We\u0027re ready now. Action.\"\\n\\n The camera began whirring. Hildy had been told what to do. The man was lying on his back. Hildy went to work.\\n\\n She started with a trip around the world, skillfully using her tongue and lips on the man\u0027s ears and neck, moving down across his chest and stomach and belly, Eghtly flicking her tongue in quick butterfly strokes against his groin and penis, then each leg, down to his toes, slowly licking each toe, watching his erection begin. She rolled him over on his stomach, and her tongue began to work its way back up his body, moving slowly, expertly, finding all the erotic crevices and sensitive areas and exploring them. The man was fully aroused now, rock-hard.\\n\\n \"Get inside her,\" the cameraman said. The man rolled her over and was on top of her, forcing her thighs apart, his penis swollen to an enormous tumescence, and as he entered her, Hildy forgot her earlier fears. It felt wonderful.\\n\\n \"Shove it in me, liebchen!\" she cried.\\n\\n The man was deep, deep inside her, rocking back and forth, and Hildy started to move with him, her hips writhing in quickening spasms. In the back of the room the spectator was leaning forward, watching every movement. The girl on the bed closed her eyes.\\n\\n She was spoiling it!\"\\n\\n \"Her eyes!\" the spectator shouted.\\n\\n The director called out, \"Offne die Augen!\"\\n\\n Startled, Hildy opened her eyes. She watched the man on top of her. He was good. It was the kind of sex she liked. Hard and thrusting. He was moving faster now, and she began to respond to him. Usually she did not have orgasms, except with her girl friend. With customers she always faked it, and they never knew the difference. But the cameraman had warned her that if she did not have an orgasm, she would not be paid the bonus. And so now she relaxed and let herself think about all the beautiful things she was going to buy with the money, and she felt herself beginning to climax.\\n\\n \"Schneller!\" she cried. \"Schneller!\"\\n\\n Her body began to shudder. \"Ah, jetzt!\" she screamed. Es kommt! Es kommt!\"\\n\\n The spectator nodded, and the cameraman cried, \"Now!\"\\n\\n The man\u0027s hands moved up toward the girl\u0027s neck. His enormous fingers closed over the windpipe and squeezed. She looked up into his eyes and saw what was there, and she was filled with terror. She tried to scream, but she was unable to breathe. She fought desperately to fight free, her body jerking in great, orgiastic spasms, but he had her pinned down. There was no escape.\\n\\n The spectator sat there drinking it in, feasting on it, looking into the dying girl\u0027s eyes, watching her being punished.\\n\\n The girl\u0027s body shuddered once, and then was still. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline/page-22.html","bookId":2356,"book":{"id":2356,"title":"Bloodline","description":"Storyline: Sheldon\u0027s sweeping saga of greed and betrayal, sabotage and danger, and the ties that can kill... \\n Roffe and Sons is a family firm, an international empire filled with desperate, cash-hungry family members.
