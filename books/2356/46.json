{"id":67598,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"\"Excuse me, Mrs. Williams,\" Henriette\u0027s voice said on the intercom, \"there\u0027s a Detective Hornung here to see you. He says it\u0027s urgent.\"\\n\\n Elizabeth turned to look up at Rhys, puzzled. They had just returned from Rio to Zurich the evening before, and they had only been in the office a few minutes. Rhys shrugged. \"Tell her to send the man in. Let\u0027s find out what\u0027s so important.\"\\n\\n A few moments later the three of them were seated in Elizabeth\u0027s office. \"What did you want to see me about?\" Elizabeth asked.\\n\\n Max Hornung had no small talk. He said, \"Someone is trying to murder you.\" As he watched the color drain from Elizabeth\u0027s face, Max was genuinely distressed, wondering if there might have been a more tactful way he could have phrased it.\\n\\n Rhys Williams said, \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\\n\\n Max continued to address himself to Elizabeth. \"There have already been two attempts on your life. There will probably be more.\"\\n\\n Elizabeth stammered, \"I - you must be mistaken.\"\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am. That elevator crash was meant to kill you.\"\\n\\n She stared at him in silence, her dark eyes filled with bewilderment, and some other emotion buried deeper, that Max could not define. \"So was the Jeep.\"\\n\\n Elizabeth found her voice again. \"You\u0027re wrong. That was an accident. There was nothing the matter with the Jeep. The police in Sardinia examined it.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I saw them,\" Elizabeth insisted.\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am. You saw them examine a Jeep. It wasn\u0027t yours.\"\\n\\n They were both staring at him now.\\n\\n Max went on, \"Your Jeep was never in that garage. I found it in an auto junkyard at Olbia. The bolt that sealed the master cylinder had been loosened, and the brake fluid had run out. That\u0027s why you had no brakes. The left front fender was still bashed in and there were green markings on it from the sap of the trees you ran into. The lab checked it out. It matches.\"\\n\\n The nightmare was back. Elizabeth felt it sweep through her, as though the floodgates of her hidden fears had suddenly opened, and she was filled again with the terror of that ride down the mountains.\\n\\n Rhys was saying, \"I don\u0027t understand. How could anyone - ?\"\\n\\n Max turned to look at Rhys. \"All Jeeps look alike. That\u0027s what they were counting on. When she crashed instead of going off the mountain, they had to improvise. They couldn\u0027t let anyone examine that Jeep because it had to look like an accident. They had expected it to be at the bottom of the sea. They probably would have finished her off there, but a maintenance crew came along, found her and took her to the hospital. They got hold of another Jeep, smashed it up a little and made the switch before the police came.\"\\n\\n Rhys said, \"You keep saying \u0027they.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Whoever was behind it had help.\"\\n\\n \"Who - who would want to kill me?\" Elizabeth asked.\\n\\n \"The same person who killed your father.\"\\n\\n She had a sudden feeling of unreality, as if none of this was happening. It was all a nightmare that would go away.\\n\\n \"Your father was murdered,\" Max went on. \"He was set up with a phony guide who killed him. Your father didn\u0027t go to Chamonix alone. There was someone with him.\"\\n\\n When Elizabeth spoke, her voice was a hollow whisper. \"Who?\"\\n\\n Max looked at Rhys and said, \"Your husband.\"\\n\\n The words echoed in her ears. They seemed to come from far away, fading in and out, and she wondered if she was losing her mind.\\n\\n \"Liz,\" Rhys said, \"I wasn\u0027t there with Sam when he was killed.\"\\n\\n \"You were in Chamonix with him, Mr. Williams,\" Max insisted.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true.\" Rhys was talking to Elizabeth now. \"I left before Sam went on his climb.\"\\n\\n She turned to look at him. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\\n\\n He hesitated a moment, then seemed to make a decision. \"It\u0027s something I couldn\u0027t discuss with anyone. For the past year someone has been sabotaging Roffe and Sons. It was done very cleverly, so that it seemed to be a series of accidents. But I began to see a pattern. I went to Sam with it, and we decided to hire an outside agency to investigate.\"\\n\\n Elizabeth knew then what was coming, and she was simultaneously filled with a deep sense of relief and a feeling of guilt. Rhys had known about the report all along. She should have trusted him enough to tell him about it, instead of keeping her fears to herself.\\n\\n Rhys turned to Max Hornung, \"Sam Roffe got a report that confirmed my suspicions. He asked me to go up to Chamonix to discuss it with him. I went. We decided to keep it just between the two of us until we could find out who was responsible for what was happening.\" When he continued, there was a note of bitterness in his voice. \"Obviously, it wasn\u0027t kept quiet enough. Sam was killed because someone knew we were getting on to him. The report is missing.\"\\n\\n \"I had it,\" Elizabeth said. Rhys looked at her in surprise. \"It was with Sam\u0027s personal effects.\" She said to Max, \"The report indicates that it was someone on the board of Roffe and Sons, but they all have stock in the company. Why would they want to destroy it?\"\\n\\n Max explained, \"They\u0027re not trying to destroy it, Mrs. Williams. They\u0027re trying to cause enough trouble to make the banks nervous enough to start calling in their loans. They wanted to force your father to sell the stock and go public. Whoever is behind this hasn\u0027t gotten what he wanted yet. Your life is still in danger.\"\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027ve got to give her police protection,\" Rhys demanded.\\n\\n Max blinked and said tonelessly, \"I wouldn\u0027t worry about that, Mr. Williams. She hasn\u0027t been out of our sight since she married you.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline/page-46.html","bookId":2356,"book":{"id":2356,"title":"Bloodline","description":"Storyline: Sheldon\u0027s sweeping saga of greed and betrayal, sabotage and danger, and the ties that can kill... \\n Roffe and Sons is a family firm, an international empire filled with desperate, cash-hungry family members.
