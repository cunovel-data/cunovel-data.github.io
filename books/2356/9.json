{"id":67561,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"After the warm winter sunshine of Sardinia, New York seemed like Siberia. The streets were filled with snow and slush, and the wind blowing off the East River was frigid; but Elizabeth did not mind. She was living in Poland, in another century, sharing the adventures of her great-great grandfather. Every afternoon after school, Elizabeth would rush up to her room, lock the door and take out the Book. She had thought of discussing it with her father, but she was afraid to, for fear he would take it away from her.\n In a wonderful, unexpected way, it was old Samuel who gave Elizabeth encouragement. It seemed to Elizabeth that they were so much alike. Samuel was a loner. He had no one to talk to. Like me, thought Elizabeth. And because they were almost the same age - even though a century apart - she could identify with him.\n Samuel wanted to be a doctor.\n Only three physicians were allowed to take care of the thousands of people crowded into the unsanitary, epidemic-ridden confines of the ghetto; and of the three, the most prosperous was Dr. Zeno Wal. His house stood among its poorer neighbors like a castle in the midst of a slum. It was three stories high, and through its windows could be seen freshly washed and starched white-lace curtains and glimpses of shining, polished furniture. Samuel could visualize the doctor inside, treating his patients, helping them, curing them: doing what Samuel longed to do. Surely, if someone like Dr. Wal took an interest in him, Samuel thought, he could help him become a doctor. But as far as Samuel was concerned, Dr. Wal was as inaccessible as any of the gentiles living in the city of Krakow, outside the forbidden wall.\n From time to time Samuel would catch glimpses of the great Dr. Zeno Wal walking along the street, engaged in earnest conversation with a colleague. One day, as Samuel was passing the Wal house, the front door opened and the doctor came out with his daughter. She was about Samuel\u0027s age, and she was the most beautiful creature Samuel had ever seen. The moment Samuel looked at her, he knew she was going to be his wife. He did not know how he was going to manage that miracle, he only knew that he had to.\n Every day after that, Samuel found an excuse to be near her house, hoping to get another glimpse of her.\n One afternoon, as Samuel was walking by the Wal house on an errand, he heard piano music coming from inside, and he knew that she was playing. He had to see her. Looking around to make sure no one was observing him, Samuel walked to the side of the house. The music was coming from upstairs, directly above his head. Samuel stepped back and studied the wall. There were enough handholds for him to climb it, and without a moment\u0027s hesitation he started up. The second floor was higher than he had realized, and before he reached the window he was ten feet above the ground. He looked down and felt a momentary sense of dizziness. The music was louder now, and he felt as if she were playing for him. He grabbed another handhold and pulled himself up to the window. Slowly he raised his head so he could peer over the sill. He found himself looking into an exquisitely furnished parlor. The girl was seated before a gold-and-white piano, playing, and behind her in an armchair, reading a book, was Dr. Wal. Samuel had no eyes for him. He could only stare at the beautiful vision just a few feet away from him. He loved her! He would do something spectacular and daring so that she would fall in love with him. He would - So engrossed was Samuel in his daydream that he loosened his grip and began to fall into space. He let out a cry and saw two startled faces staring at him just before he plunged to the ground.\n He woke up on an operating table in Dr. Wal\u0027s office, a spacious room outfitted with medical cabinets and an array of surgical equipment. Dr. Wal was holding an awful-smelling piece of cotton under Samuel\u0027s nose. Samuel choked and sat up.\n \"That\u0027s better,\" Dr. Wal said. \"I should remove your brain but I doubt if you have one. What were you planning to steal, boy?\"\n \"Nothing,\" Samuel replied indignantly.\n \"What\u0027s your name?\"\n \"Samuel Roffe.\"\n The doctor\u0027s fingers began to probe Samuel\u0027s right wrist, and the boy cried out with pain.\n \"Hm. You have a broken wrist, Samuel Roffe. Maybe we should let the police fix it\u0027\n Samuel groaned aloud. He was thinking about what would happen when the police brought him home in disgrace. His aunt Rachel\u0027s heart would be broken; his father would kill him. But, even more important, how could he ever hope to win Dr. Wal\u0027s daughter now? He was a criminal, a marked man. Samuel felt a sudden, agonizing jerk on his wrist, and he looked up at the doctor in shocked surprise.\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" Dr. Wal said. \"I\u0027ve set it.\" He went to work putting a splint on it. \"Do you live around here, Samuel Roffe?\"\n \"No, sir.\"\n \"Haven\u0027t I seen you hanging about?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"Why?\"\n Why? If Samuel told him the truth, Dr. Wal would laugh at him.\n \"I want to become a doctor,\" Samuel blurted out, unable to contain himself.\n Dr. Wal was staring at him in disbelief. \"That\u0027s why you climbed the wall of my house like a burglar?\"\n Samuel found himself telling his entire story. He told about his mother dying in the streets, and about his father, about his first visit to Krakow and his frustration at being locked inside the ghetto walls at night like an animal. He told how he felt about Dr. Wal\u0027s daughter. He told everything, and the doctor listened in silence. Even to Samuel\u0027s ears his story sounded ridiculous; and when he was finished, he whispered, \"I - I\u0027m sorry.\"\n Dr. Wal looked at him for a long time, and then said, \"I\u0027m sorry, too. For you, and for me, and for all of us. Every man is a prisoner, and the greatest irony of all is to be the prisoner of another man.\"\n Samuel looked up at him, puzzled. \"I don\u0027t understand, sir.\"\n The doctor sighed. \"One day you will.\" He rose to his feet, walked over to his desk, selected a pipe and slowly and methodically filled it. \"I\u0027m afraid this is a very bad day for you, Samuel Roffe.\"\n He put a match to the tobacco, blew it out and then turned to the boy. \"Not because of your broken wrist. That will heal. But I\u0027m going to have to do something to you that may not heal so quickly.\" Samuel was watching him, his eyes wide. Dr. Wal walked over to his side, and when he spoke his voice was gentle. \"Very few people ever have a dream. You have two dreams. And I\u0027m afraid I am going to have to break both of them.\"\n \"I don\u0027t - \"\n \"Listen to me carefully, Samuel. You can never be a doctor - not in our world. Only three of us are allowed to practice medicine in the ghetto. There are. dozens of skilled doctors here, waiting for one of us to retire or to die, so that they can take our place. There\u0027s no chance for you. None. You were born at the wrong time, in the wrong place. Do you understand me, boy?\"\n Samuel swallowed. \"Yes, sir.\"\n The doctor hesitated, then went on. \"About your second dream - I\u0027m afraid that one is just as impossible. There is no chance of your ever marrying Terenia.\"\n \"Why?\" Samuel asked.\n Dr. Wal stared at him. \"Why? For the same reason you can\u0027t become a doctor. We live by the rules, by our traditions. My daughter will marry someone of her own class, someone who can afford to keep her in the same style in which she has been raised. She will marry a professional man, a lawyer or a doctor or a rabbi. You - well, you must put her out of your mind.\"\n \"But - \"\n The doctor was ushering him toward the door. \"Have someone look at that splint in a few days. See that the bandage is kept clean.\"\n \"Yes, sir,\" Samuel said. \"Thank you, Dr. Wal.\"\n Dr. Wal studied the blond, intelligent-looking boy before him. \"Good-bye, Samuel Roffe.\"\n Early the next afternoon, Samuel rang the front doorbell of the Wal house. Dr. Wal watched him through the window. He knew that he should send him away.\n \"Send him in,\" Dr. Wal said to the maid.\n After that, Samuel came to Dr. Wal\u0027s house two or three times a week. He ran errands for the doctor, and in exchange Dr. Wal let him watch as he treated patients or worked in his laboratory, concocting medicines. The boy observed and learned and remembered everything. He had a natural talent. Dr. Wal felt a growing sense of guilt, for he knew that in a way he was encouraging Samuel, encouraging him to be something he could never be; and yet he could not bring himself to turn the boy away.\n Whether it was by accident or design, Terenia was almost always around when Samuel was there. Occasionally he would get a glimpse of her walking past the laboratory, or leaving the house, and once he bumped into her in the kitchen, and his heart began to pound so hard that he thought he would faint. She studied him for a long moment, a look of speculation in her eyes, then she nodded coolly and was gone. At least she had noticed him! That was the first step. The rest was only a matter of time. There was not the slightest doubt in Samuel\u0027s mind. It was fated. Terenia had become a major part of Samuel\u0027s dreams about the future. Where once he had dreamed for himself, he now dreamed for the two of them. Somehow he would get them both out of this terrible ghetto, this stinking, overcrowded prison. And he would become a great success. But now his success would not be for him alone, but for both of them.\n Even though it was impossible.\n Elizabeth fell asleep, reading about old Samuel. In the morning when she awakened, she carefully hid the Book and began to get dressed for school. She could not get Samuel off her mind. How did he marry Terenia? How did he get out of the ghetto? How did he become famous? Elizabeth was consumed by the Book, and she resented the intrusions that tore her away from it and forced her to return to the twentieth century.\n One of the classes that Elizabeth had to attend was ballet, and she loathed it. She would stuff herself into her pink tutu, and stare at her image in the mirror and try to tell herself that her figure was voluptuous. But the truth was there for her to see. She was fat. She would never be a ballet dancer.\n Shortly after Elizabeth\u0027s fourteenth birthday, Mme. Netturova, her dance teacher, announced that in two weeks the class would give its yearly dance recital in the auditorium, and that the students were to invite their parents. Elizabeth was in a state of panic. The mere thought of getting up on a stage in front of an audience filled her with dread. She could not go through with it.\n A child was running across a street in front of a car. Elizabeth saw her, raced out and snatched the child from the jaws of death. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, Elizabeth Roffe\u0027s toes were crushed by the wheels of the automobile, and she will not be able to dance at the recital this evening.\n A careless maid left a bar of soap at the top of the stairs. Elizabeth slipped and fell down the long flight, breaking her hip. Nothing to worry about, the doctor said. It will heal in three weeks.\n No such luck. On the day of the performance, Elizabeth was in perfect health, and in a state of hysteria. Again, it was old Samuel who helped her. She remembered how frightened he had been, but he had gone back to face Dr. Wal. She would not do anything to disgrace Samuel. She would face up to her ordeal.\n Elizabeth had not even mentioned the recital to her father. In the past she had often asked him to school meetings and parties which parents were requested to attend, but he had always been to busy.\n On this evening, as Elizabeth was getting ready to leave for the dance recital, her father returned home. He had been out of town for ten days.\n He passed her bedroom, saw her and said, \"Good evening, Elizabeth.\" Then, \"You\u0027ve put on some weight.\"\n She flushed and tried to pull in her stomach. \"Yes, Father.\"\n He started to say something, then changed his mind. \"How\u0027s school coming along?\"\n \"Fine, thank you.\"\n \"Any problems?\"\n \"No, Father.\"\n \"Good.\"\n It was a dialogue they had had a hundred times over the years, a meaningless litany that seemed to be their only form of communication. How\u0027s-school-coming-along-fine-thank-you-any-problems-no-Father-good. Two strangers discussing the weather, neither listening nor caring about the other\u0027s opinion. Well, one of us cares, Elizabeth thought.\n But this time Sam Roffe stood there, watching his daughter, a thoughtful expression on his face. He was used to dealing with concrete problems and although he sensed that there was a problem here, he had no idea what it was, and if anyone had told him, Sam Roffe\u0027s answer would have been, \"Don\u0027t be a fool. I\u0027ve given Elizabeth everything.\"\n As her father started to leave, Elizabeth heard herself say, \"My - my - ballet class is giving a recital. I\u0027m in it. You don\u0027t want to come, do you?\"\n And even as she said the words, she was filled with a sense of horror. She did not want him there to see her clumsiness. Why had she asked him? But she knew why. Because she was the only girl in the class whose parents would not be in that auditorium. It doesn\u0027t matter, anyway, she told herself, because he\u0027s going to say no. She shook her head, furious with herself, and turned away. And behind her, incredibly, she heard her father\u0027s voice saying, \"I\u0027d like that.\"\n The auditorium was crowded with parents, relatives and friends, watching the students dance to the accompaniment of two grand pianos on either side of the stage. Mme. Netturova stood off to one side, counting the beat aloud as the children danced, calling the attention of the parents to herself.\n A few of the children were remarkably graceful, and showed signs of real talent. The others went through their performances determined to substitute enthusiasm for ability. The mimeographed program announced three musical excerpts from Coppelia, Cinderella and, inevitably, Swan Lake. The piece de resistance was to be the solos, when each child would have her moment of glory, alone.\n Backstage, Elizabeth was in an agony of apprehension. She kept peering through the side curtain, and each time she saw her father sitting in the second row center, she thought what a fool she had been to ask him. So far during the show, Elizabeth had been able to lose herself in the background, hidden behind the other dancers. But now her solo was coming up. She felt gross in her tutu, like something in a circus. She was certain they would all laugh at her when she came out on the stage - and she had invited her father to watch her humiliation! Elizabeth\u0027s only consolation was that her solo lasted for only sixty seconds. Mme. Netturova was no fool. It would all be over so quickly that no one would even notice her. All Elizabeth\u0027s father had to do was to glance away for a minute, and her number would be finished.\n Elizabeth watched the other girls as they danced, one by one, and they seemed to her like Markova, Maximova, Fonteyn. She was startled by a cold hand on her bare arm, and Mme. Netturova hissed, \"On your toes, Elizabeth, you\u0027re next.\"\n Elizabeth tried to say, \"Yes, madame,\" but her throat was so dry that no words came out. The two pianists struck up the familiar theme of Elizabeth\u0027s solo. She stood there, frozen, incapable of moving, and Mme Netturova was whispering, \"Get out there!\" and Elizabeth felt a shove against her back, and she was out on the stage, half naked, in front of a hundred hostile strangers. She did not dare look at her father. All she wanted was to get this ordeal over with as quickly as possible and flee. What she had to do was simple, a few plies and jetes and leaps. She began to execute the steps, keeping time to the music, trying to think herself thin and tall and lithe. As she finished, there was a smattering of polite applause from the audience. Elizabeth looked down at the second row, and there was her father, smiling proudly and applauding - applauding her, and something inside Elizabeth snapped. The music had stopped. But Elizabeth kept on dancing, doing plies and jetes and battements and turns, carried away, transported beyond herself. The confused musicians began to pick up her beat, first one pianist, then the other, trying to keep up with her. Backstage. Mme. Netturova was signaling to Elizabeth wildly, her face filled with fury. But Elizabeth was blissfully unaware of her, transported beyond herself. The only thing that mattered to her was that she was onstage, dancing for her father.\n \"I am sure you understand, Mr. Roffe, that this school simply cannot tolerate that type of behavior.\" Mme. Netturova\u0027s voice was trembling with anger. \"Your daughter ignored everyone else and took over, as though - as though she were some kind of star.\"\n Elizabeth could feel her father turn to look at her, and she was afraid to meet his eyes. She knew that what she had done was unforgivable, but she had been unable to stop herself. For one moment on that stage she had tried to create something beautiful for her father, had tried to impress him, make him notice her, be proud of her. Love her.\n Now she heard him say, \"You\u0027re absolutely right, Madame Netturova. I will see to it that Elizabeth is suitably punished.\"\n Mme. Netturova gave Elizabeth a look of triumph, and said, \"Thank you, Mr. Roffe. I will leave it in your hands.\"\n Elizabeth and her father were standing outside the school. He had not said one word to her since leaving Mme. Netturova\u0027s office. Elizabeth was trying to compose a speech of apology - but what could she say? How could she ever make her father understand why she had done what she had done? He was a stranger, and she was afraid of him. She had heard him vent his terrible anger on others for making mistakes, or for having disobeyed him. Now she stood there waiting for his wrath to fall upon her.\n He turned to her and said, \"Elizabeth, why don\u0027t we drop in at Rumpelmayer\u0027s and get a chocolate soda?\"\n And Elizabeth burst into tears.\n She lay in her bed that night, wide awake, too stimulated to go to sleep. She kept re-playing the evening over and over in her mind. The excitement of it had been almost more than she could bear. Because this was no made-up daydream. It had happened, it was real. She could see herself and her father, seated at the table at Rumpelmayer\u0027s, surrounded by the large, colorful stuffed bears and elephants and lions and zebras. Elizabeth had ordered a banana split, which had turned out to be absolutely enormous, and her father had not criticized her. He was talking to her. Not how\u0027s-school-coming-along-fine-thank-you-any-problems-no-Father-good. But really talking. He told her about his recent trip to Tokyo, and how his host had served chocolate-covered grasshoppers and ants as a special treat for him, and how he had had to eat them in order not to lose face.\n When Elizabeth had scooped up the last drop of the ice cream, her father suddenly said, \"What made you do it, Liz?\"\n She knew that everything was going to be spoiled now, that he was going to reprimand her, tell her how disappointed he was in her.\n She said, \"I wanted to be better than everyone else.\" She could not bring herself to add, For you.\n He looked at her for what seemed a long time, and then he laughed. \"You certainly surprised the hell out of everybody.\" There was a note of pride in his voice.\n Elizabeth felt the blood rushing to her cheeks, and she said, \"You\u0027re not angry with me?\"\n There was a look in his eyes that she had never seen before. \"For wanting to be the best? That\u0027s what the Roffes are all about.\" And he reached over and squeezed her hand.\n Elizabeth\u0027s last thoughts as she drifted off to sleep were: My father likes me, he really likes me. From now on, we\u0027ll be together all the time. He\u0027ll take me on trips with him. We\u0027ll talk about things and we\u0027ll become good friends.\n The following afternoon her father\u0027s secretary informed her that arrangements had been made to send Elizabeth away to a boarding school in Switzerland. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline/page-9.html","bookId":2356,"book":{"id":2356,"title":"Bloodline","description":"Storyline: \n Sheldon\u0027s sweeping saga of greed and betrayal, sabotage and danger, and the ties that can kill... \n Roffe and Sons is a family firm, an international empire filled with desperate, cash-hungry family members.
