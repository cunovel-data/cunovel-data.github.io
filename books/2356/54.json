The operation had taken eight hours. In spite of everything the skilled surgeons had been able to do, she would never walk again. She woke in agonizing pain, whispering Alec\u0027s name over and over. She needed him, she needed to have him at her side, to have him promise that he would still love her. The hospital staff was unable to locate Alec. In Zurich, in the communications room of the Kriminal Polizei, an Interpol message was received from Australia. The former film purchasing agent for Roffe and Sons had been located in Sydney. He had died of a heart attack three days earlier. His ashes were being shipped home. Interpol had been unable to obtain any information regarding the purchase of the film. They were awaiting further instructions. In Berlin, Walther Gassner was seated in the discreet waiting room of an exclusive private sanatorium in a pleasant suburb outside the city. He had been there, motionless for almost ten hours. From time to time a nurse or an attendant would stop by to speak to him and offer him something to eat or drink. Walther paid no attention to them. He was waiting for his Anna. It would be a long wait In Olgiata, Simonetta Palazzi was listening to a woman\u0027s voice on the telephone. \"My name is Donatella Spolini,\" the voice said. \"We\u0027ve never met, Mrs. Palazzi, but we have a great deal in common. I suggest we meet for luncheon at the Bolognese in the Piazza del Popolo. Shall we say one o\u0027clock tomorrow?\" Simonetta had a conflicting appointment at the beauty parlor the next day, but she adored mysteries. \"I\u0027ll be there,\" she said. \"How will I know you?\" \"I\u0027ll have my three sons with me.\" In her villa in Le Vesinet, Helene Roffe-Martel was reading a note she had found waiting for her on the mantel-piece in the drawing room. It was from Charles. He had left her, run away. \"You will never see me again,\" the note said. \"Don\u0027t try to find me.\" Helene tore the note into small pieces. She would see him again. She would find him. In Rome, Max Hornung was at Leonardo da Vinci Airport. For the past two hours he had been trying to get a message through to Sardinia, but because of the storm all communications were down. Max went back to the flight operations office to talk to the airport manager again. \"You\u0027ve got to get me on a plane to Sardinia,\" Max said. \"Believe me, it\u0027s a matter of life and death.\" The airport manager said, \"I believe you, signore, but there is nothing I can do about it. Sardinia is shut up tight. The airports are closed. Even the boats have stopped running. Nothing is going in or out of that island until the scirocco is over.\" \"When will that be?\" Max asked. The airport manager turned to study the large weather map on the wall. \"It looks like it\u0027s good for at least another twelve hours.\" Elizabeth Williams would not be alive in twelve hours.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline/page-54.html","bookId":2356,"book":{"id":2356,"title":"Bloodline","description":"Storyline: Sheldon\u0027s sweeping saga of greed and betrayal, sabotage and danger, and the ties that can kill...
