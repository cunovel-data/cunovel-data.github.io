{"id":108131,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"St Michael\u0027s Psychiatric Hospital lies close to Darlington, in the north-east of the country, not far from Joe\u0027s native Newcastle. I toy with the idea of inviting Joe along for the journey - he knows the area and could serve as a guide - but that would mean telling him the truth, and I don\u0027t want to do that, not until I\u0027ve confirmed it.\n Gardiner walked me from the glade when he was finished talking. He made a phone call, gave our position, then sat with me on a stone wall to wait. We said little. When the car arrived, the driver gazed curiously at me but didn\u0027t ask who I was. Gardiner told him to find a town with a train station, where he left me to make my own way north. \u0027Remember,\u0027 he said in parting, \u0027you don\u0027t tell anyone and you never come back. This is my riddle now. I\u0027ll let people think Dash killed Mikis, but I know the truth and I won\u0027t forget. If you show your face in London again, you\u0027re dead.\u0027\n It wasn\u0027t an idle threat, but I can\u0027t let the matter drop. If my investigation draws me back to the Big Smoke, I\u0027ll take my chances where Bond Gardiner\u0027s concerned.\n I bought a ticket at the station, found a quiet carriage when the train pulled in and settled back to brood. That\u0027s where I am now, watching the countryside whip by, trying to make sense of what I was told. Gardiner promised to call ahead to the hospital and clear my visit, but even if he didn\u0027t, they won\u0027t be able to keep me out. Nothing will bar my way. I have to see. I have to know.\n Gardiner released me after dropping his bombshell. He stepped aside, a look of shame contorting his features. By that shame, I knew he wasn\u0027t lying.\n \u0027She isn\u0027t dead?\u0027 I croaked when I was able to make more than a thin gasping cry. \u0027What the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u0027\n He didn\u0027t reply straight away. He was disgusted with himself for revealing the truth. He waved me away, and although I wanted to grab him by the throat and choke answers out of him, I said nothing while he took deep breaths and sought control. Finally he calmed down enough to continue, but he couldn\u0027t get through the story without mauling his book of matches until it was pulp in his hands.\n \u0027There should never have been anything between Andeanna and me,\u0027 he began. \u0027The attraction was there a long time, but we were loyal to Mikis and knew the dangers of betraying him. For years we resisted. We spent a lot of time alone - Mikis trusted me with her - but we never acted on our feelings. Until . . .\n \u0027She made the first move. We were watching TV one night. Without warning, she leant over and kissed me. I should have pulled away, but I just sat there, stunned. She took off her blouse and . . . \u0027 He blushed. \u0027We needn\u0027t relive all the details. We did what we shouldn\u0027t have, regretted it the next morning, swore never to do it again.\u0027\n \u0027But you did,\u0027 I interjected quietly.\n His blush deepened. \u0027Yeah. We planned our encounters carefully, usually when Mikis was out of the country and we had the house to ourselves. A few other times we met when Andeanna was visiting her parents. We took no chances. I think we could have carried on indefinitely if . . . \u0027 He faltered to a stop.\n \u0027If the Turk hadn\u0027t found out?\u0027 I said, to get him going again.\n He shook his head. \u0027Mikis never knew. You think I\u0027d be alive if he\u0027d rumbled us? Our friendship wouldn\u0027t have mattered. He\u0027d have killed me.\u0027\n \u0027So what happened?\u0027 I asked.\n \u0027Madness,\u0027 he said, and stirred uncomfortably.\n I stir uncomfortably on the train as I recall this part of the conversation and think about my destination. I\u0027ve only been to an institute for the clinically insane once before, researching for Soul Vultures. It was a depressing experience. On the back of that visit, I cut out the scenes that were going to be set in an asylum. I wish I could cut out the forthcoming scenes as easily.\n \u0027I only realized later that our affair was a by-product of Andeanna\u0027s breakdown,\u0027 Gardiner told me dully. \u0027She was strong, not afraid of anything, but Mikis slowly crushed her. He loved her, but he was callous. He was a man of violence, the same as you and me. He let the brutality of his work spill over into his private life. He mellowed in the latter years of their marriage and tried to make amends - that\u0027s why she was allowed to visit her parents - but it was too late. Later than any of us imagined.\n \u0027You know Mikis cheated on her. Andeanna knew too. She never said anything, but she knew.\u0027\n \u0027What does that have to do with - \u0027 I began to ask.\n \u0027Her name was Christina Whiteoak, wife of Arnold. Know him?\u0027 I shook my head, bewildered. \u0027Arnold Whiteoak was a munitions baron, a total mercenary. He didn\u0027t care who he sold to. That\u0027s what did for him in the end - he spent so long playing one group off against the other that eventually . . .\n \u0027But this isn\u0027t about him. It\u0027s about his beautiful wife, Christina. She had an affair with Mikis. It was the only time he let his lust get in the way of business. Arnold Whiteoak was a shark, far more powerful than Mikis. If he\u0027d found out, he would have washed the streets with their blood, and Mikis knew it. But he couldn\u0027t stop.\n \u0027Mikis and Andeanna were due to spend Christmas and New Year in Scotland. They\u0027d been a couple of times before. Mikis loved the kilts, the bagpipes and the rivers of whisky. He used to say he was a Celt at heart. That year he made an excuse to return from the festivities early. Stayed for Christmas dinner, then tore down to London. Told Andeanna he had urgent business to attend to. That shouldn\u0027t have surprised her - he often cut holidays short - but this time she was suspicious. She followed him.\n \u0027She hit London on the twenty-seventh without telling anybody. Caught a train, then got a cab home from the station. She must have guessed what Mikis was up to, but whether she went in there intending to do what she did, or if it was a spur-of-the-moment reaction, I don\u0027t know. I doubt she knew herself.\u0027\n It\u0027s late when I reach Darlington. Dark, wet, miserable. As I step down from the train, my eight ghosts - a seething Mikis Menderes joined the parade while I was en route - drift out along the platform in a crescent and smile at me smugly, a cool welcoming committee. I\u0027m back to not being sure if they\u0027re real or figments of my imagination. I could do without that distraction at the moment - I\u0027m tense enough - but since I can\u0027t disperse or claim to understand the shades, I jam my head down and push through, doing my best to ignore them, looking for the taxi rank.\n The hospital isn\u0027t what I was expecting. A modern building backing on to an industrial estate, no signs out front to reveal its true purpose apart from a small plaque over the door and an ambulance parked in the drive.\n \u0027You want me to stick around to take you back?\u0027 the driver asks as I step out.\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure,\u0027 I mumble.\n \u0027I\u0027m only saying \u0027cos it might take a while to get a lad out here this late. It\u0027ll cost you a fair bit if I wait, but if I don\u0027t, you might be stuck here longer than you\u0027d like.\u0027\n I shove a handful of notes into his eager fist. \u0027Is that enough?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, aye,\u0027 he says. \u0027That\u0027ll keep me till morning if necessary.\u0027\n I walk to the door, stare nervously at the buzzer, then press it. Moments later I\u0027m stepping inside to face the living ghost of an undead past.\n \u0027It took her a while to find them.\u0027 Gardiner\u0027s face was dark as death, defying the glittering beams of the early-morning sun. \u0027They were in one of the spare bedrooms. Mikis told me, years later, that every door on the landing had been opened. She must have gone from room to room, opening the doors, checking, not closing them, moving on.\n \u0027We never found out where she got the knife. Maybe she bought it on the way home, or lugged it down from Scotland. I often imagine her sitting on that train with a bag on her lap, the knife inside, hand in the bag, clutching the handle, focused on what she was going to do. Her right hand was all cut up. She\u0027d been gripping the blade, either on the journey or while she stalked the halls. I don\u0027t think she felt the pain. The madness would have numbed her to it.\u0027\n He stopped, and his fingers squeezed around the remains of the book of matches. I could guess what was coming and was almost as apprehensive as Gardiner.\n \u0027She found them in the end. Mikis felt a draught when the door opened, but he took no notice. He thought he\u0027d forgotten to shut it properly. That was almost ten minutes before she screamed, so she must have been standing there all that time, watching, listening, grasping the knife.\u0027\n I wanted him to stop. Despite having forced the issue, risked my life, killed or been instrumental in the murder of four people, I wanted him to leave the story unfinished. I almost asked him to stop but my lips wouldn\u0027t form the words.\n \u0027Mikis got drunk a couple of years ago and told me that her scream was the most chilling thing he\u0027d ever heard. He said it was like the whistle of a steam engine, only filled with hate. He was crying. Said it was a sound he\u0027d never been able to block out. It echoed in his ears still, often driving him to the verge of suicide. If not for Greygo, he would have topped himself years ago.\n \u0027Christina was on top at the time - another detail Mikis only revealed long after the event - and she spun around when she heard the scream. She saw Andeanna framed in the doorway, one hand held to her head, the other hidden by her side. For a moment Christina stared at her, bewildered. Then she laughed.\u0027\n Gardiner dropped the destroyed book of matches, fished in his pockets for another, tore it open, lit a match and continued, letting it burn down to his fingers, not flinching when it quenched itself on his hard, callused flesh.\n \u0027If she hadn\u0027t laughed, it might have stopped with the scream. But this was Andeanna\u0027s house. Her home. Her husband. And here was this woman, this slut, fucking Mikis. And she was laughing.\u0027\n Gardiner lit another match, held it up and nodded at the flame. \u0027Andeanna flared into life. She moved so fast, Mikis barely saw what happened. She raced across the room. Christinawas still laughing. Andeanna sliced through the bitch\u0027s breasts with the knife, then whipped it across her throat.\n \u0027She didn\u0027t stop there,\u0027 Gardiner said as the match burnt out. \u0027She carried on hacking. Mikis lay on the bed, staring at the women, his body and face covered with blood, unable to raise a hand, knowing it wouldn\u0027t have mattered if he had. It was over after the second cut. The rest was mere butchery.\u0027\n \u0027Mere butchery,\u0027 I whisper to myself as I wait for Dr Jan Tressman. A young nurse has asked three times if I\u0027d like anything to drink. She looks worried. Maybe it\u0027s my appearance. I\u0027m not sure what I look like, but I\u0027m not my normal self. I can\u0027t remember the last time I shaved or washed. I spent several hours in the trunk of a car. There are bloodstains on my trousers from Dash\u0027s death spray. I\u0027ve had my world turned upside down, inside out, ripped to pieces and tacked back together with the glue of nightmarish madness. I\u0027m not, I think it\u0027s safe to say, at my dapper, dashing best.\n \u0027Mikis expected to die,\u0027 Gardiner continued. \u0027Once Andeanna had finished with Christina, he was sure she\u0027d attack him. He lay there anticipating death, doing nothing to avert it. He was hers for the taking. But she spared him.\n \u0027She stared at him hungrily, gripping the knife, her chest heaving. Maybe the fact that he made no move to defend himself saved him. Perhaps she was waiting for him to raise a hand or cringe or . . . laugh. But he just lay there, gazing at her desperately, and finally she got off the bed, walked to a corner, sank to her haunches and started to croon.\u0027\n \u0027What did she sing?\u0027 I asked.\n Gardiner looked at me incredulously. \u0027How the fuck do I know?\u0027 he roared. \u0027Does it matter?\u0027\n \u0027Just curious,\u0027 I replied, stung by his reaction.\n \u0027Why don\u0027t we find this mystic of yours and ask if she knows? Perhaps she has a spectral CD player.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027What a dumb fucking question.\n \u0027Anyway, she was crooning. Mikis couldn\u0027t lie there all night, much as he\u0027d have liked to. He got to his feet, checked to make sure Christina was dead, then edged past Andeanna and rushed for the phone to call the police.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d have thought they were the last people he\u0027d want to involve.\u0027\n \u0027They were. But he was so shaken, he didn\u0027t know what he was doing. He was two digits in before he stopped to consider the consequences. Calling the coppers would have been the end of both of them. Andeanna would have been carted away, taken into custody and subjected to the full process of the law. Details would have leaked to the press, Christina\u0027s name would have emerged, Arnold Whiteoak would have come gunning for Mikis.\n \u0027Going public was out of the question. Mikis put the phone down, sat naked on the floor and thought it through. His survival instincts kicked in and he rang me. He couldn\u0027t handle it alone. I was the only person he trusted. He knew I wouldn\u0027t milk the fuck-up for all it was worth, or hold it over his head for the rest of his life.\n \u0027He didn\u0027t tell me what happened over the phone, only said it was an emergency. When I walked in and saw Christina and Andeanna, I knew we were in deep shit. I wanted to rush to Andeanna and comfort her, but I managed to stop myself. Mikis would have known there was something between us if I had. The state he was in, he\u0027d have throttled me with his bare hands there and then.\n \u0027Mikis had dressed, but he hadn\u0027t washed off the blood. He gave me a rundown of what had happened, explained his basic plan and asked for my input.\u0027 Gardiner cracked a half-smile. \u0027Input,\u0027 he repeated with a snort.\n \u0027What was the plan?\u0027 I asked.\n \u0027Kill two birds with one stone,\u0027 Gardiner replied. \u0027If it had just been Christina, we\u0027d have dumped her body and prayed that Arnold never found out. But . . . \u0027\n He stalled, so I said it for him. \u0027There was Andeanna.\u0027\n \u0027Right. As much as he loved her, Mikis couldn\u0027t let her walk. We could see that she\u0027d passed way beyond reason. We couldn\u0027t help her. There was only one other solution - we had to kill her.\u0027\n A middle-aged, grey-haired, chubby doctor steps into the waiting room and casts an eye around. \u0027Mr Sieveking?\u0027 he asks, already stepping forward to shake my hand. \u0027I\u0027m Jan Tressman.\u0027\n \u0027Doctor,\u0027 I greet him.\n \u0027Please, call me Jan.\u0027 He studies my face and clothes. If the nurse didn\u0027t spot the bloodstains on my trousers, Tressman does, and his lips tighten. \u0027Do you need assistance, Mr Sieveking?\u0027\n \u0027No. I\u0027m fine. Never better.\u0027\n He grunts sceptically. \u0027So, you\u0027re here to visit one of my patients?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I whisper.\n \u0027Our mutual acquaintance - \u0027 he\u0027s careful not to mention Bond Gardiner\u0027s name - \u0027told me that Miss Emerson doesnot know you. Is that correct?\u0027\n Is it? Beats the hell out of me. But I go along with Gardiner\u0027s story. Less complicated that way. \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Tressman chews his lower lip. \u0027Miss Emerson is unaccustomed to visitors. She is docile most of the time, but reacts nervously to unfamiliar faces. When we have to introduce someone into her environment - a new nurse, for instance - we do so gradually. There is no direct contact to begin with. The nurse remains at a distance until Miss Emerson learns to accept his or her presence, then slowly moves closer and plays amore active role in her life over a period of concurrent days. A stranger walking straight in to see her . . . \u0027 He shakes his head.\n \u0027Has she never had a visitor?\u0027 I ask.\n Tressman hesitates, then says, \u0027Only her son.\u0027\n \u0027Greygo?\u0027 I gape.\n \u0027Gregory Menderes, yes. He first came several years ago, before I started here, and has been a regular visitor since.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t think Greygo knew about his mother. Then again, I didn\u0027t ask Gardiner about the Menderes heir. I know that Greygo was desperate to find out more about Andeanna. He must have tracked her down, probably through Mikis, who maybe told him the truth during a drunken bout of self-pity.\n \u0027What does Greygo do when he comes?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027Sits with her. Talks. Tells her about himself.\u0027\n \u0027Does she know who he is?\u0027\n Tressman sighs. \u0027Miss Emerson is beyond the realms of such recognition. Her fragile mental state, combined with her medication . . . You know about that?\u0027 I nod stiffly. \u0027She knows somewhere within the remains of her mind that she has a son - she plays with dolls and often pretends that one of them is her child - but she is incapable of recognizing him in the flesh. Gregory tried jogging her memory when he first visited - he would tell her who he was, bring photos of himself when he was younger, beg her to acknowledge him - but he now knows that can never be. He is satisfied just to come and sit with her.\u0027\n I think about that in silence. It\u0027s sad, but also troubling. Greygo told me he saw his mother\u0027s ghost when he was growing up, that he\u0027d spoken with her. If that had been a cover story, I could accept it, but he sent me to Etienne Anders, who not only backed up his claims but put me in touch with the ghost. An elaborate ruse to steer me away from the truth? Or a more calculated ploy? Might Greygo have set me up with 279 the Andeanna lookalike? Could he have masterminded the downfall of the father he claimed to love?\n All reports contradict that hypothesis - everyone says that Greygo was a model son - but the evidence is beginning to weigh against the Menderes heir. I may have to corner him again and put a few harsh questions his way.\n Focusing on the present, I consider the matter in hand. The last thing I want is to disturb Miss Emerson. If she\u0027s as wrapped up in her own world as Gardiner and Tressman have said, I can gain nothing by questioning her. I ask the doctor if it\u0027s possible to view her without revealing myself. \u0027Of course,\u0027 he beams. \u0027That would be best.\u0027 Smiling approvingly, he slips away to set things up, and I\u0027m left alone again, with nothing to do but think back upon the revelations in the glade.\n Gardiner couldn\u0027t kill her. Even though he agreed that execution was necessary, he\u0027d been Andeanna\u0027s secret lover, and when it came to placing a cushion over her face and smothering her, he faltered. He fetched a pillow from the bed, fluffed it up and started forward, but got no closer than a couple of feet. Her blank look, her trembling hands, her crooning, memories of their affair . . . In the end, he could only stand, pillow in hands, and shake his head.\n \u0027Mikis howled at me to kill her,\u0027 he said. \u0027In all our years together, that was the only time he turned on me. He struck me, threatened to kill me. I didn\u0027t fight back, just stood my ground and told him I couldn\u0027t do it.\u0027\n Eventually the Turk grabbed the pillow from Gardiner, determined to finish her off himself. He got right up to her, the pillow poised mere inches from her face, before he stalled.\n \u0027It was her expression,\u0027 Gardiner croaked. \u0027It never changed. She went on singing softly, no understanding in her eyes. You\u0027d think that would have made it easier to kill her, but it didn\u0027t.\u0027\n When Mikis tossed the pillow aside, he thought his world had come to an end. He would get rid of the corpse of Christina Whiteoak, confine his wife to home and hire a tight-lipped harridan to nurse her, but he was sure the truth would leak. It was too much to hope that Andeanna would remain comatose. She\u0027d return to consciousness and bring him to ruin. There was nothing he could do to prevent it.\n \u0027The idea to swap bodies was mine,\u0027 Gardiner said hollowly. \u0027It hit me when we were discussing ways to dispose of Christina. Mikis wanted to dump her where she\u0027d never be found, but I thought it would be better if we could arrange for her body to be discovered. If she disappeared, her husband wouldn\u0027t stop looking for her, but if we made it look like an accident . . . \u0027\n \u0027A bit of a problem, given the way she was killed,\u0027 I noted.\n Gardiner nodded. \u0027She\u0027d been hacked to pieces. Mikis asked if I meant to throw her down a flight of stairs and claim she\u0027d tripped while carrying a knife. I lost my temper and told him to stop acting like an idiot. It wouldn\u0027t be easy, but it could be done. If we started a fire, the flames would destroy the evidence of foul play. Her wounds were flesh deep. Get rid of the flesh, get rid of the wounds.\n \u0027Mikis was worried. Too much could go wrong. He didn\u0027t see the need to be so elaborate. He\u0027d almost won me over when a new plan struck. And struck is exactly the way to describe it. The scheme slammed into my mind in a single sickening second. You could say it was my one real moment of genius.\u0027\n It was a dreadfully simple idea - incinerate the corpse but pretend it was Andeanna. They\u0027d have to burn Christina beyond identification to get rid of the stab wounds. Such a body could be anyone\u0027s. If they dressed it in Andeanna\u0027s clothes, placed it in her car - even at that early stage he saw the need to stage a crash - and said that it was the Turk\u0027s wife, who would ever question them?\n \u0027Mikis thought I\u0027d lost my mind. The women looked nothing alike. They weren\u0027t the same height. They wouldn\u0027t have matching dental records. And Arnold Whiteoak - the whole reason we\u0027d considered burning Christina was to throw her husband off the scent. Without a corpse, he\u0027d keep searching for her, and Mikis thought we\u0027d be left with the threat of Andeanna one day blabbing and alerting Whiteoak to the truth. I convinced him that she wouldn\u0027t. That she couldn\u0027t.\u0027\n Gardiner talked him through it quickly and convincingly. They could smash the teeth to pieces and the police would believe it was a result of the crash. The ruse wouldn\u0027t stand close scrutiny, but if they staged the crash correctly, why should anyone suspect a swap? It would be Andeanna\u0027s car, clothes, jewellery. Mikis would say he\u0027d seen her leaving the house. Why would the police believe she was anybody other than who she appeared to be?\n \u0027He still couldn\u0027t see the point of swapping the bodies,\u0027 Gardiner muttered. \u0027It wasn\u0027t until I told him what we could do with Andeanna that he saw the light.\u0027\n At that, Gardiner\u0027s shame overwhelmed him and he practically shrivelled up.\n Tressman sticks his head into the waiting room and whistles for me. I get to my feet and follow him into a long white corridor. He leads the way to a small dark room that looks on to a larger area via a two-way mirror. There\u0027s a chair next to the mirror, positioned close to a loudspeaker. The room beyond is vacant.\n \u0027She will be here presently,\u0027 Tressman says. \u0027This is one of her recreational zones, so she will feel at ease. You can stay and watch as long as you wish. She cannot see you. A nurse will be waiting outside when you want to leave.\u0027\n \u0027You aren\u0027t staying?\u0027\n \u0027I am busy. I have papers to - \u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d prefer if you stayed,\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027I might have questions.\u0027\n \u0027What about?\u0027\n \u0027Her condition. Her history. Her state of mind.\u0027\n He laughs cynically. \u0027She has no mind. Her previous doctors were most successful in drugging that out of her.\u0027\n I stare at him curiously. \u0027You don\u0027t approve of how she\u0027s been treated.\u0027\n He shrugs sadly. \u0027I have two children in university and a third with special requirements. My predecessor knew of my need for additional income. He introduced me to Mr Gardiner and I snatched the thirty pieces of silver from his hand. I am all too aware of my faults, but I still know right from wrong, and the way that woman has been treated is as wrong as you can get. I would never have sanctioned what was done to her, at any price.\u0027\n \u0027Is there no way you could help her?\u0027 I ask softly.\n \u0027No. The damage was done long before she passed into my care. God himself could not reverse the effects of what they have pumped into her. Her personality has been erased and it can never be restored.\u0027\n The door to the room opens and he stops. We watch silently as a young black nurse leads in a wizened old woman. She shuffles forward with short, trembling steps, clutching a couple of dolls to her chest, lips moving wordlessly in rhythm with the twitching of her neck. With a mix of horror, disgust and pity, I watch.\n Gardiner\u0027s plan - awful simplicity itself if they could get away with faking the car crash - was to commit Andeanna to a mental asylum and keep her doped up for the rest of her life. They had contacts in the medical profession, doctors who owed them favours or who could be otherwise coerced into following orders.\n \u0027He warmed to the idea once I\u0027d explained it,\u0027 Gardiner said without pride. \u0027In a matter of minutes he was on the phone, first to a hospital in Kent, then Darlington, where she ended up. It was expensive, but Mikis didn\u0027t care. Anything was better than having to answer to Arnold Whiteoak for the death of his wife.\u0027\n \u0027You weren\u0027t afraid that he\u0027d find out some other way?\u0027 I asked.\n \u0027No. Nobody else knew about their affair. Andeanna was the only link.\u0027\n They had to act quickly. Early the next day, they bundled Christina\u0027s corpse into the trunk of Andeanna\u0027s car, having taken a hammer to her mouth and adorned her with Andeanna\u0027s clothes and personal items. Gardiner drove to the countryside and Menderes followed. They found a quiet stretch of road and pulled in. Together they prepared the body and the car - it wasn\u0027t the first time they\u0027d staged a crash - then Gardiner got in and aimed it down a hill at a group of trees. Once he\u0027d set the corpse on fire, he rode in the flaming car most of the way, taking a dive only when he was within sprinting distance of the trees. Dashing for cover, he hurried through the forest and down to the next stretch of road, where the Turk was waiting. Then it was back to London to collect Andeanna.\n \u0027We\u0027d tied her up before we left,\u0027 Gardiner said, \u0027but I spent the entire journey back thinking she\u0027d somehow clawed her way free and would be waiting for us with a knife. The idea didn\u0027t frighten me - I was already having regrets. Part of me wanted her to recover, longed to die at her hands.\u0027\n But she hadn\u0027t escaped. She never would.\n Andeanna didn\u0027t react when they bundled her into the back of Christina Whiteoak\u0027s car and covered her with a blanket. Menderes sobbed and vowed to scrap the plan, keep her with him, nurse her back to sanity and beg forgiveness. If the Turk had made a real attempt to stop Gardiner, he wouldn\u0027t have argued, but for all his tears and protests, the grief-stricken husband made no move to detain his partner, who was soon on the road north, leaving his boss to sit by the phone and wait for the police to break the tragic news of his wife\u0027s death.\n \u0027And that was that,\u0027 Gardiner finished gruffly. \u0027I switched cars along the way, leaving Christina\u0027s outside a hotel near Birmingham airport, then made sure Andeanna was safely tucked away. I signed the papers, used her mother\u0027s name and paid the first of what would prove to be many instalments. Her doctor - our doctor - knew what was expected of him and promised to take good care of her. I didn\u0027t ask what that entailed. If I live to be a hundred, I never will. There are some things you\u0027re better off not knowing.\u0027\n I agreed wholeheartedly with that. There was a lot about Andeanna Menderes, her marriage to the Turk and her life thereafter, that I\u0027d have been happier knowing nothing about. But having come so far and learnt so much, I couldn\u0027t stop now. So I pushed for more and asked which hospital she\u0027d been admitted to. Without even pausing, Bond Gardiner reeled off the address, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n Until that tired old woman walked into the room, I\u0027d been entertaining hopes that she might be my Andeanna. She could have recovered her sanity - perhaps under the guidance of a new doctor - and set out to destroy the man who\u0027d cheated her of so many years. I had visions of her looking through the glass, sensing me on the other side, smiling knowingly. \u0027Took your time getting here, Ed,\u0027 she might chuckle.\n Those faint hopes disappear as soon as she enters. This woman is Andeanna Menderes. As broken and haggard as she is, I\u0027ve studied the photos of her long enough to know the real deal when faced with it. But there isn\u0027t a chance in hell that she\u0027s the woman who seduced me. Her face is lined with pain and madness, marks that no amount of make-up could disguise. Her hands are thin, twisted spindles at the ends of her bony arms. She walks hunched over. Her hair is grey, poorly cut, the ends jagged and torn. This is the true, present-day Andeanna. My ghost was an illusion, a clever reconstruction of a face from the past. I see that now. More importantly, I accept it. Whoever - whatever - my lover was, she wasn\u0027t a rejuvenated, vengeful Mrs Menderes.\n Tears stream down my face. So many years of dry ducts, and now here I am, reduced to waterworks for the second time in twenty-four hours. Her beauty sets me off. Because despite her appearance, the empty eyes and the shuffling movements, she is beautiful. A woman old before her time, cruelly robbed of her mind and personality, a soul in suffering. But still a beauty to behold.\n Something waves at the corner of my vision - Dr Tressman offering a white handkerchief. Smiling sadly, I shake my head. I don\u0027t want to wipe away the tears. I enjoy the warmth of them on my cheeks. They\u0027re an assurance that in spite of all I\u0027ve done and been, I\u0027m still partly human.\n \u0027How could they do this to her?\u0027 I weep. \u0027Killing her would have been kinder. Leaving her like this . . . destroying her mind . . . \u0027\n \u0027I agree,\u0027 Tressman sighs. \u0027Death would have been a blessing.\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t there something you could do? An injection?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he murmurs. \u0027And I have considered it, not only for Miss Emerson, but others like her. But I have sworn an oath to protect life, not take it. Besides, who am I to decide such matters? Miracles do happen. I have seen people like Miss Emerson, in some cases worse, emerge from the depths of lost madness and resume their lives where they left off.\u0027\n \u0027But you said her brain has been destroyed.\u0027\n \u0027It has,\u0027 he nods. \u0027But while we know much about the brain, we know nothing of the soul. I do not expect Miss Emerson to recover. I would class it as an impossibility. But the chance, as slim as it is, exists. Where there is life, there is hope. That stays my hand, even in my darkest hours, when I bear witness to pain of the most horrendous degree.\u0027\n \u0027Give me the choice,\u0027 I whisper. \u0027I\u0027d put her out of her misery.\u0027\n \u0027That is why you will never be given such an option,\u0027 he says with a wry smile. \u0027We must trust our weak and damaged to those with the strength to endure their suffering, or else they would be at the mercy of those without.\u0027\n \u0027I can show mercy,\u0027 I growl, disliking the implication.\n \u0027Can you, Mr Sieveking? Can you really?\u0027\n I think of the people I\u0027ve killed. I run my gaze over the ghosts pressed close around me - they seem as fascinated by the woman in the room as I am. I don\u0027t answer.\n The nurse remains with Andeanna, but retires to a corner to read a creased novel. Andeanna wanders while I watch in hidden silence. She runs her fingers over colourful paintings on the walls (they look like they were painted by children, but are probably the work of the inmates) and smiles a ghostly, stop-start smile. She halts before a picture of a bright blue boy with a huge head and stares at it, her smile spreading, then presses her forehead against the figure\u0027s stomach and keens sharply.\n \u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027 I ask, startled.\n \u0027That was drawn by a man who has been here almost as long as Miss Emerson,\u0027 Tressman says. \u0027He is more balanced and experiences spells of clarity. He has a crush on her. When he learnt that she once had a child, he painted that picture for her. She recognizes it sometimes and mourns for what is lost.\u0027\n \u0027I thought you said she was beyond recognition.\u0027\n \u0027She remembers certain things, occasionally, in ways we do not understand.\u0027\n \u0027Then she\u0027s not entirely brain-dead?\u0027\n He shrugs. \u0027When her real son comes to see her, she does not know who he is. A man paints a surreal picture of a child he has never seen, and it stirs something inside her. Traces of her humanity remain, but they are subtle and impossible to define.\u0027 He rests a hand on my shoulder. \u0027She cannot be rescued, if that is what you are asking.\u0027\n Andeanna turns from the painting and shuffles into the middle of the room. Her eyes are wide-open pools of nothingness. She sits on the floor, clears a space and lays down her dolls. She cocks her head and studies them, then picks up the larger doll and plucks at its hair.\n \u0027She will play with that until we take her back to her room,\u0027 Tressman says. \u0027She will treat it as her son, feed it imaginary sweets, maybe bare a breast and suckle it.\u0027 He coughs discreetly. \u0027I will have to ask you to leave if that happens.\u0027\n As I watch, Andeanna lays the doll in her lap, picks up the other - a girl - and removes its dress, which she slides down over her surrogate son, smiling and gurgling. Next she rocks the doll in her arms and makes choked sounds.\n I want to leave but I can\u0027t tear myself away. It\u0027s not just that I feel sorry for her. Part of me wants to stay. It thinks that I belong here too. I can feel insanity stirring within myself. It would be so easy to surrender, abandon the real world, the quest for truth, the need for knowledge, and just join Andeanna in her aimless, carefree life. Sit in a room, gurgle over childish paintings, dress up dolls, let others do the worrying and planning. In a warped sort of way, it would be heaven.\n But this isn\u0027t a time for heaven. This is a time for hell. There can be no sanctuary until I\u0027ve stripped the lie of all its trimmings, revealed the truth of who I fell in love with and lost my soul to. If I gave up now, I\u0027d be haunted for ever. There could be no rest. I wouldn\u0027t be sitting with Andeanna, playing with dolls. I\u0027d be locked away where my screams couldn\u0027t frighten the rest of the patients.\n Andeanna slaps the floor with one hand, clutching the doll to her chest with the other. Her face contorts and she slaps the floor again. The nurse hurries over to a locked cupboard set high on one of the walls, opens it and produces a small bag.\n \u0027Drugs?\u0027 I ask, preparing to leave, unwilling to be a witness to the deliberate doping of Andeanna Menderes.\n \u0027Nothing so monstrous,\u0027 Tressman smiles.\n The nurse hands Andeanna the bag, the contents of which she shakes out on to the floor. I\u0027m relieved to see nothing more frightening than everyday cosmetics - lipstick, mascara, rouge. Andeanna\u0027s fingers scuttle over the tubes and cases, then settle on the lipstick, which she starts to apply with surprising care and precision to the doll\u0027s stiff plastic lips.\n \u0027Now there will be no shifting her,\u0027 Tressman notes. \u0027When she starts this, she loses herself for hours at a time.\u0027 He glances at me. \u0027If you like, I could take you in. She will not notice anything other than the doll now that she is focused on it.\u0027\n I shake my head. \u0027I\u0027ve seen enough,\u0027 I whisper.\n Tressman\u0027s lips purse. \u0027May I ask what your interest in Miss Emerson is? I know I am not meant to, and you do not have to answer, but . . . \u0027\n \u0027I was her lover,\u0027 I answer softly.\n He stares from me to Andeanna and back again. \u0027Before she was admitted?\u0027\n \u0027More recently than that.\u0027\n His features crease. \u0027I do not understand.\u0027\n \u0027Me neither,\u0027 I reply with a choked, bitter laugh.\n One last lingering look at Andeanna and her lifeless baby, then I turn away. \u0027I\u0027d like to leave now.\u0027\n \u0027You are sure?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve seen what I came for. There\u0027s nothing more for me here. I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s anything beyond either, but I can\u0027t stay here and hide, can I?\u0027 Tressman stares at me, confused. I laugh bitterly. \u0027It\u0027s OK. I don\u0027t expect an answer.\u0027\n \u0027Do you have somewhere to sleep tonight?\u0027 Tressman asks, opening the door.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I might head back to London. Is there a train this late?\u0027\n \u0027I doubt it. I can recommend a good hotel instead.\u0027\n \u0027Thanks. If you knew the day I\u0027ve had . . . \u0027 I manage a short smile. \u0027I\u0027m dead on my feet. I think I could sleep through a . . . \u0027\n I come to a standstill, not sure why I\u0027ve stopped. An image of a doll flashed through my mind, but it wasn\u0027t the doll Andeanna was holding. It was a doll of the boy in the painting, the one with the enormous blue head. Except the features were different. It was my face. And it was laughing at me.\n Tressman is closing the door to the viewing room. \u0027Wait,\u0027 I stop him and barge back in, the image seeming to will me on. I can almost hear the laughter. I can\u0027t leave without knowing what the doll is snickering at.\n \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 Tressman asks, following me back inside.\n I silence him with a sharp gesture. Thoughts collide like trains deep within my brain. Strands of the puzzle wrap together, unbidden, forming a picture. I can\u0027t see the whole of it yet, but I know it has something to do with the woman on the other side of the glass, and more crucially with the doll whose cheeks she is now reddening with rouge. What is it about the bloody doll that so disturbs me?\n Then, out of the dark waters of my consciousness, a question surfaces, and I intuitively know that it will lead to answers. I don\u0027t know what the question means, or how it acts as the key to the puzzle, but I voice it anyway, giving it the release it demands.\n \u0027If she thinks the doll is her son,\u0027 I mutter to a bemused Dr Tressman, \u0027why the hell is she treating it like a girl?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-21.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: \n Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
