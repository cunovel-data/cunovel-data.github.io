{"id":108126,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I ask Joe to find out everything he can about Andeanna Menderes, her background, family, associates. I tell him to track down distant relatives, old friends, anyone who was close to her. Try to find people who might have known the new version of her. \u0027Start with that beautician, Shar, who was celebrating her birthday the night we met,\u0027 I advise him. \u0027Talk to your friends who were at the party. Take a photo of Andeanna with you, show it round and ask if anyone remembers seeing a woman who looked like that.\u0027 While Joe is exploring the Andeanna angle, I check out Dash\u0027s safe house. It looks deserted. No car in the drive. Curtains open. I should stake it out for a day or two to be safe, but I don\u0027t feel like wasting time, so I slip around back and let myself in with the spare set of keys which I kept. I move cautiously through the rooms. No clear signs that Dash has been here - the bed is stripped, the chairs stacked neatly against the walls, the heating turned off - but there\u0027s a slab of cheese by the bread bin that wasn\u0027t there before, and a can of beans in a cupboard under the sink. Peculiar of Dash to leave behind even these slight reminders of his stay. Maybe he left in a panic. From the safe house I make my way north, where I spend the next three days doing the rounds of every seedy-looking pub and club, making contact with low-level gangsters. I call myself Edgar Sanders and pretend to be a journalist doing a piece about Mikis Menderes. I buy drinks for anyone who\u0027ll chat with me. Many are eager to add to the Menderes legend and be associated with him in some small way, so most talk with me freely. They tell me all sorts of juicy stories, how Mikis drove out into the countryside every once in a while to chop the heads off sheep, the time he ate the prize poodle of someone who was slow to repay a loan, his incredible sex drive. (\u0027He once had twelve women on the go at the same time,\u0027 a pickpocket called Ernie tells me. \u0027That\u0027s what I call a dirty dozen!\u0027) Entertaining tales, but nothing about who killed him or why he might have been executed. Finally, in the Star and Anchor, a grim, grey place that\u0027s at odds with its name, I run into a member of Bond Gardiner\u0027s gang, a youthful but grey-haired man called John Horan, who shoots a mean game of pool. After letting him thrash me a couple of times, I ask if he\u0027s heard any strange stories about how the Turk was killed. \u0027What sort of stories?\u0027 John snaps warily. \u0027I heard it was suicide and someone made it look like an assassination to big up the Turk\u0027s legend.\u0027 \u0027Bullshit.\u0027 \u0027I guessed as much,\u0027 I sigh. \u0027I mean, how can you trust a guy who builds a conspiracy theory out of a pair of shoes? I should have known he was - \u0027 \u0027What\u0027s that about shoes?\u0027 John interrupts. \u0027Some crazy shit about Menderes\u0027s laces. I shouldn\u0027t even have - \u0027 \u0027Go on,\u0027 John says tightly. \u0027Well, this guy said he knew a journalist who works for The Times, and he said he saw a pair of shoes in a photo and the lace on one of them wasn\u0027t tied.\u0027 \u0027So?\u0027 John sniffs, eyeing me beadily. \u0027According to him, it\u0027s something people do when they kill themselves, if they don\u0027t want to leave a note. They tie the lace on one shoe but not the other. It\u0027s a way of letting people know it wasn\u0027t an accident.\u0027 John laughs, at ease again. \u0027That\u0027s the dumbest thing I\u0027ve heard all week.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 I chuckle ruefully. \u0027But I figured I might as well ask.\u0027 \u0027You should be careful,\u0027 John warns me. \u0027Loose talk like that can earn you a slap round here. If I was you, I\u0027d keep shit about laces to myself.\u0027 And after that, I do, since I know by his reaction that the laces were noted. I\u0027m not sure what happened to Dash, whether he escaped or was taken down, but that\u0027s unimportant. It\u0027s enough to know that Bond and his men have swallowed the bait. I can forget about Dash and focus on hunting for the ghostlike Andeanna. Joe hasn\u0027t discovered a secret sister or daughter. He\u0027s done a remarkable job of assembling a family tree, filling half a scrapbook with names, dates of birth, photographs and details. I go through the photos several times, with a magnifying glass, but none of Andeanna\u0027s relatives is close enough in looks or age to pass for the woman I knew and loved. \u0027I called several of them,\u0027 Joe says, \u0027pretending to be a reporter, asking about her past, her life with the Turk. Most were happy to talk about her, but nobody had much contact with her after she married Menderes.\u0027 \u0027What about friends?\u0027 \u0027Plenty from the past, but not a one from her London years. It seems like the Turk kept her locked away from everybody.\u0027 I flick through the pages, admiring Joe\u0027s research skills, then thumb back to the first page and the photos of Andeanna\u0027s parents. Her mother died nine years ago. Her father is alive and living alone. \u0027Did you check if Deleena Emerson had any other children?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s no record of it,\u0027 Joe replies. \u0027But did you ask?\u0027 He shakes his head. \u0027It\u0027s not the sort of thing you can say to strangers. I asked if Andeanna had brothers or sisters and they all said she didn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027What about her father?\u0027 \u0027He wouldn\u0027t speak to me. He doesn\u0027t discuss his daughter.\u0027 \u0027If anyone knows, it would be him.\u0027 \u0027True. But if he doesn\u0027t want to talk about it . . . \u0027 \u0027He\u0027ll talk,\u0027 I grunt. Joe squints at me. \u0027Ed, you wouldn\u0027t . . . I mean, you aren\u0027t going to do anything illegal, are you? I don\u0027t want to be part of - \u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 I stop him. \u0027Violence isn\u0027t my style.\u0027 Joe snorts. \u0027This from an assassin?\u0027 \u0027Ex-assassin,\u0027 I grin bleakly. \u0027But even back then I didn\u0027t rough anyone up. I killed, I didn\u0027t torture.\u0027 \u0027Interesting distinction,\u0027 Joe mutters, but pushes the point no further. \u0027There was one other thing.\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027Andeanna\u0027s death. You know how the police say she veered off the road and crashed, the car burst into flames and she couldn\u0027t get out?\u0027 \u0027What about it?\u0027 \u0027There were no on-hand witnesses, but a few drivers in the distance saw the car careen down the bank. One of them, Marian Fitzgerald, said she saw flames in the car before it hit the trees and exploded.\u0027 \u0027So?\u0027 \u0027The forensic guys who examined the wreckage couldn\u0027t explain why the car left the road in the first place. Given the Marian Fitzgerald evidence, I got to thinking that maybe . . . \u0027 He stalls. \u0027Go on,\u0027 I quietly urge him. \u0027Could it have been SHC?\u0027 \u0027I thought we\u0027d dismissed that theory,\u0027 I snap impatiently. He shrugs. \u0027I know there\u0027s probably nothing to it. I was tossing out wild ideas the first time I brought this up. But when I read the report, it made me wonder. I started thinking about something you\u0027d said, about how the impostor had known you were an assassin.\u0027 \u0027People knew,\u0027 I mutter. \u0027Not many, but a few. One of them must have told Andeanna or whoever hired her to con me.\u0027 \u0027More than likely,\u0027 Joe says. \u0027But if we admit the possibility that she might be a ghost - I\u0027m only saying might, don\u0027t lose your temper!\u0027 \u0027Go on,\u0027 I sigh wearily. \u0027If she spontaneously combusted and came back as a ghost,\u0027 Joe continues, \u0027maybe she was drawn to you by the research you were doing. Your mind was fixated on the subject. She might have been able to tap into that. Or . . . hell, Ed, I know this is a long shot, but maybe you brought her back to life.\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 I gawp. \u0027If Pierre Vallance has the power to channel mental waves and convert them into voices, maybe you have a similar talent. Maybe you unwittingly gave form to Andeanna, the way you gave limited form to your other ghosts. She dies horribly, some residue of her circles the streets of London all these years, you hit town, her spirit gravitates towards you, you somehow give her back her body, she seizes her opportunity and uses you to take revenge on the man she hated.\u0027 I consider Joe\u0027s crazy proposal. Because he\u0027s my friend and I know he means well, I treat it seriously. \u0027What was the state of her corpse when they found it?\u0027 Joe checks his notes. \u0027Burnt beyond recognition.\u0027 \u0027It hadn\u0027t been reduced to ash?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 I smile thinly. \u0027There you are.\u0027 \u0027But SHC victims don\u0027t always burn away entirely,\u0027 Joe presses. \u0027And even if she didn\u0027t die of that, maybe you gave form to her spirit regardless. We should bear it in mind. If we can\u0027t find a plausible explanation - if there isn\u0027t a lookalike - we\u0027ll have to explore other angles, won\u0027t we?\u0027 \u0027I suppose,\u0027 I mutter, too tired to argue. \u0027I\u0027m not being obtuse,\u0027 Joe says. \u0027I\u0027m not confusing the world of the book we were working on with the real world. But if we eliminate all other possibilities and only this remains . . . \u0027 \u0027Then I\u0027ll investigate it. But I won\u0027t have to. Because she wasn\u0027t a ghost.\u0027 Saying it firmly, wanting to mean it. But not one hundred per cent positive. My gaze flickers to the seven supernatural shades in the room with us, and I wonder if Joe has hit on the answer to the riddle I\u0027ve been picking at all these years. If I\u0027m not crazy . . . if my ghosts are more than just the product of a deluded mind . . . then maybe I have the ability to give shape to disconnected spirits. Perhaps I\u0027ve subconsciously brought about my own haunting. If that\u0027s the case, and these seven ghosts gain their power from something in me, why shouldn\u0027t I be able to go even further and create a physical body for another? Andrew Moore lives in Birmingham. He\u0027s a loner who rarely entertains visitors. I make the long drive up early on Friday morning, locate the house, then call him from my car. I don\u0027t go with the Edgar Sanders approach, since Joe has already tried the faux-journalist gambit. \u0027Andrew Moore. How may I help you?\u0027 \u0027Good afternoon, Mr Moore. My name is Edward Sieveking. I\u0027m a novelist, doing some research. I\u0027d like to meet you, if - \u0027 \u0027What\u0027s this about?\u0027 he snaps. \u0027Are you a reporter?\u0027 \u0027No, Mr Moore, I\u0027m an author. I write books.\u0027 \u0027What sort of books?\u0027 \u0027Fiction. Horror, mostly.\u0027 He pauses. \u0027What\u0027s your interest in me, Mr Sieveking?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d like to talk with you about a new book I\u0027m working on.\u0027 \u0027Is it about Mikis Menderes?\u0027 \u0027Not directly, no.\u0027 \u0027But he\u0027s the reason you want to talk to me?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 I confess. \u0027But mostly I want to ask about your daughter.\u0027 \u0027My apologies, Mr Sieveking, but I have nothing to say about either of those people.\u0027 \u0027But - \u0027 \u0027Good day, Mr Sieveking. Good luck with your book.\u0027 He hangs up. I wait ten minutes before ringing again. Despite the delay, he\u0027s waiting for the call and answers on the second ring with a curt, \u0027Mr Sieveking?\u0027 \u0027Please, just give me a chance to - \u0027 \u0027My no means no.\u0027 End of conversation. When I ring a third time, he doesn\u0027t answer. I wait half an hour before trying again - no luck. Leaving the car, I march to the front door and ring the bell. It takes him a while to appear. When he does, the curtain covering the side window swishes aside and I glimpse a pair of angry eyes. \u0027Sieveking?\u0027 he snaps, dispensing with the formalities. \u0027I only want a few minutes of your time, Mr Moore.\u0027 \u0027Leave now or I\u0027ll call the police.\u0027 \u0027That would be unwise,\u0027 I caution him. \u0027If the police question me, I\u0027ll have to tell them why I\u0027m here, and if word of what I\u0027ve discovered leaks to the press, this place will be swarming with reporters.\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 he growls. \u0027I\u0027m talking about your daughter and the role she may have played in the death of Mikis Menderes.\u0027 The curtain slides back into place and the door is thrown open. Andrew Moore is a big man, broad and straight-backed despite his age, with a commanding face. \u0027My daughter died nearly twenty years ago. She had nothing to do with that bastard\u0027s death. Now get the hell out of here before - \u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not here to waste your time,\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027I drove up from London to speak with you in person. Give me five minutes. If I don\u0027t grab your interest, I\u0027ll leave voluntarily and I won\u0027t pester you again.\u0027 Moore glares at me, then takes a step to one side and waves me in. He points me towards an immaculately maintained living room, an old man\u0027s room filled with mementos and photographs of his life. I don\u0027t expect to find any of Andeanna, the daughter he cut off, but to my surprise there are several from her youth, set proudly next to pictures of his wife. We sit down and he asks if I\u0027d like anything to drink. \u0027I\u0027d rather get straight to my reason for coming,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027Good,\u0027 he nods, pleased by my directness. I show him a hazy photograph of Andeanna, one from the archives. I\u0027ve blanked out the faces of the other people. \u0027Your daughter?\u0027 I ask. He reaches for a pair of glasses and studies the photo. \u0027It\u0027s a poor shot, but yes, it\u0027s her.\u0027 \u0027That picture was taken a month before Menderes\u0027s death,\u0027 I lie. He shrugs. \u0027Then it\u0027s not Andeanna.\u0027 \u0027But they look alike, don\u0027t they?\u0027 I press. \u0027What of it?\u0027 he says. \u0027This woman was seen with Menderes during the weeks prior to his death. She may have been living with him.\u0027 Andrew starts to look interested. \u0027Do the police think she killed him?\u0027 \u0027They don\u0027t know. She vanished. Can\u0027t be found.\u0027 He processes that, then says, \u0027Why come to me? Because she\u0027s similar in appearance to my dead daughter?\u0027 \u0027And because she called herself Deleena Emerson.\u0027 He flinches. \u0027That was my wife\u0027s name.\u0027 He gazes at the photograph again, his wrinkled hands trembling slightly. \u0027I\u0027ve read nothing about this in the papers.\u0027 \u0027My brother-in-law works for the Metropolitan Police. He knows I\u0027m fascinated by ghost stories. He was the one who told me.\u0027 \u0027Ghost stories?\u0027 Moore echoes. \u0027A woman who looks like your daughter and uses the name of your dead wife enters Mikis Menderes\u0027s life, and within a couple of months he\u0027s been killed. It sounds like something a horror writer might concoct. My brother-in-law thought I might be amused by the idea.\u0027 The old man\u0027s face darkens. \u0027There was nothing amusing about Mikis Menderes.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t approve of him?\u0027 I ask glibly. \u0027Nothing to approve of,\u0027 Moore says. \u0027He was a pimp, a thief, a bully and a paedophile.\u0027 He leans forward, undisguised hatred in his expression. \u0027Do you know how old Andeanna was when he first laid his filthy paws on her? Seventeen! A child who should have had nothing on her mind except homework and teenage boys. Seventeen years old and he made a slut of her. That was Mikis Menderes.\u0027 \u0027Didn\u0027t you try to stop her seeing him?\u0027 \u0027It was too late!\u0027 he roars. \u0027We only found out when she came sobbing to us, telling us she was pregnant. We offered to help her raise the baby here, where we could love and care for it, but she insisted on returning to London. She said the child needed a father and she swore that she loved Menderes.\u0027 Tears of remorse and regret flood Moore\u0027s cheeks. I\u0027d like to walk away and let the past lie, but I can\u0027t. I have to know the truth about Andeanna. \u0027The child,\u0027 I say softly. \u0027Was that Gregory?\u0027 He nods. \u0027Did she have any other children?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027What about you and your wife?\u0027 \u0027Andeanna was our one and only.\u0027 Moore wipes tears from his cheeks and grimaces. \u0027Menderes\u0027s death has raked up the past. I\u0027m not normally this fragile.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d like that drink if the offer\u0027s still valid,\u0027 I murmur. \u0027A cup of tea would be great if it\u0027s going.\u0027 \u0027Of course.\u0027 He gratefully heads for the comfort of the kitchen, pausing only to ask if I take milk and sugar. I pass the time studying photos of Andeanna on the walls. Even as a teenager she was beautiful. I can see why the Turk fell for her, although what she saw in a beast like him escapes me. Moore looks more composed when he returns and hands me a steaming cup of tea. \u0027Can I ask why you\u0027re interested in this, Mr Sieveking?\u0027 \u0027When my brother-in-law jokingly mentioned the possibility of a ghost in the Turk\u0027s life, I was intrigued. I meant to take the germ of the idea and run with a story about a gangster whose dead wife returns from beyond the grave. But then I heard that the police think the woman with the Turk might have mimicked your daughter\u0027s looks to attract him and set him up for assassination.\u0027 Moore grunts. \u0027It would be poetic justice if it was true.\u0027 He glances at me shrewdly. \u0027But again I must ask, why come to me? I didn\u0027t hire a woman to masquerade as Andeanna, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re thinking.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 I smile. \u0027I\u0027m trying to get an angle on your daughter, what she was like, what kind of a marriage she had. If someone impersonated her, she must have done a lot of research. I\u0027m trying to get inside that woman\u0027s mind, to figure out how she ticks and nail her down if she exists.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027 \u0027If someone did use a ringer for your daughter to get at the Turk,\u0027 I explain, \u0027and if I can track down the pair of them and expose them, I can forget about the horror story and write a straight-up account.\u0027 \u0027I see.\u0027 His smile turns icy. \u0027You\u0027re looking to exploit my dead daughter.\u0027 I scowl. \u0027If Andeanna was indirectly instrumental in destroying the man who stole her childhood, you\u0027d like to know, wouldn\u0027t you?\u0027 He scratches an ear. \u0027I suppose. But won\u0027t the police tell me?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re not actively pursuing the lead. To be blunt, they\u0027re glad Menderes is dead. They\u0027re not too concerned about finding the person who killed him.\u0027 Moore studies me in silence, then chuckles drily. \u0027I don\u0027t know why, but I like you, Mr Sieveking. Go ahead. Tell me what you want to know.\u0027 I start with some background questions, confirming things that Joe turned up. Then I ask if anyone plugged Andrew for information on his daughter during the last few years. \u0027No,\u0027 he says. \u0027I never discuss Andeanna, except with Gregory.\u0027 \u0027Greygo?\u0027 I frown. The old man smiles. \u0027Menderes\u0027s legacy. The fool gave his son a name he couldn\u0027t pronounce, then made everyone use the abbreviated version. To me, he will always be Gregory.\u0027 \u0027He comes here?\u0027 \u0027Yes. He used to visit a lot when he was younger, eager to learn about his dead mother. He clicked instantly with Deleena, both of them being actors and having so much in common, but it took me a while to warm to him. I grew to love him over time. He helped me get through the long nights when Deleena died. Now he only drops by occasionally, but he rings often. He\u0027s a good boy.\u0027 \u0027You talk about Andeanna with him?\u0027 Andrew nods. \u0027He was ten when his mother died. He never really got to know her. To learn about her history, he came to Deleena and me.\u0027 I mull that over. Could Gregory Menderes have been behind the execution? The fake Andeanna told me that Greygo loved his father, but if Menderes Junior had put the woman up to the deceit, she would say that. Maybe this is a case of a greedy, neglected son doing away with his cruel, wealthy father. \u0027Did Gregory like the Turk?\u0027 I ask. Andrew grimaces. \u0027He adored him. Menderes used to hit Andeanna, but he never raised a finger to his son. I don\u0027t have much good to say about that man, even now that he\u0027s dead, but he was a first-rate father. Gregory loved him unreservedly.\u0027 \u0027What about the family business? Will Gregory get involved now that - \u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Andrew cuts in. \u0027He never wanted anything to do with that. As an adult he refused to let Menderes give him money. He was determined to make his own way in the world.\u0027 The old man puffs up with pride. \u0027Did you know that he won a scholarship to RADA?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 I remember Andeanna - or whoever she was - mentioning it. \u0027That\u0027s a big thing here, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027If you\u0027re an actor, RADA\u0027s the best,\u0027 Andrew beams. \u0027Deleena was over the moon when she heard. We all were. Except for Menderes.\u0027 \u0027Did it get nasty?\u0027 I ask, clutching at straws. \u0027Did he threaten to disinherit Greygo or cut him off?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 Andrew smiles begrudgingly. \u0027As I said, he was a great father. He grumbled about Gregory\u0027s choice of profession but never let it drive a wedge between them. He even forced himself to go and watch Gregory on stage a few times. The boy\u0027s a natural, and I\u0027m not saying that because he\u0027s my grandson. So versatile, able to take on any part and make it his own. He could be a star, but he turns down the movies and TV shows he gets offered. Menderes was always baffled by that. He couldn\u0027t understand that Gregory only hungers for roles that will stretch him as an actor. He doesn\u0027t care about fame or money.\u0027 So much for the conspiring son theory. I suppose, given the complex nature of this mystery, the solution was never going to be that simple. \u0027Who else stood to benefit from the Turk\u0027s death?\u0027 I ask. Andrew snorts. \u0027I don\u0027t know and couldn\u0027t care less.\u0027 \u0027Did you have any contact with Andeanna after her marriage? I know you and your wife disowned her, but did you keep tabs on her? Do you know if she had any close friends in London?\u0027 There\u0027s a long pause. Finally he sighs. \u0027She kept in touch with Deleena. Not right away - we both despised her to begin with, and rebuffed her efforts to re-establish contact - but after a few years Deleena\u0027s resolve melted and the pair of them began talking again. I didn\u0027t learn of their conversations until Gregory was eight. I found Deleena sobbing in the kitchen one day, clutching a photo of a boy at a birthday party. When I asked why she was crying, the truth came gushing out. \u0027I was furious. I made her call Andeanna so that I could tell her to sever all ties with her mother.\u0027 He smiles wryly. \u0027Of course once I got on the phone, I burst into tears and spent the better part of an hour catching up on all the years that I\u0027d missed.\u0027 Andrew falls silent, thinking about his daughter and the painful past. I grant him a few minutes of inward reflection, then touch his left knee. \u0027Did you speak to her much after that?\u0027 \u0027Not as often as I would have liked,\u0027 he sighs. \u0027It was difficult. She\u0027d changed. She was a live spark when she left home, afraid of nothing. Now she was scared and lonely, terrified of Menderes, captive to his demeaning whims.\u0027 \u0027Why didn\u0027t she leave him?\u0027 I ask angrily, although I already know - she was afraid the Turk would follow and kill her. \u0027We asked her to,\u0027 Andrew assures me. \u0027I told her there was a place for her here, that I\u0027d protect her from the monster, but he\u0027d broken her spirit. And there was Gregory to consider. The boy worshipped Menderes, and she feared losing his love if she separated them. \u0027We saw her a few times before the end,\u0027 Andrew says quietly. \u0027She came three times in the months before she died. Twice she stayed overnight. Once she stayed a whole weekend.\u0027 \u0027That must have been nice,\u0027 I remark. Andrew nods, but he looks troubled. \u0027She didn\u0027t come just to see us.\u0027 He stops, and glances around nervously. \u0027This next bit,\u0027 he croaks. \u0027You must swear never to repeat it.\u0027 I lean forward, fingers clenching with anticipation. \u0027OK.\u0027 \u0027Swear it!\u0027 he hisses. I stare at him solemnly. \u0027I swear.\u0027 There\u0027s no reason why he should trust me, but he chooses to, I think because he wants to tell someone about it, has wanted to for a long time. \u0027She was seeing someone,\u0027 he says in the barest of whispers. My heart quickens. \u0027Who?\u0027 Andrew shakes his head. \u0027She wouldn\u0027t say. It was a secret. Maybe she told Deleena, but I don\u0027t think so.\u0027 \u0027Was she having an affair?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. She wouldn\u0027t talk about it. All I know is that she came here three times, used this house as a base and met someone in private. She\u0027d slip out when she thought we were asleep, return early before we got up. We didn\u0027t ask any questions. We hoped she was going to pluck up the courage to leave Menderes. But she never got the chance, because a few weeks later . . . \u0027 Tears bring him to a halt. He\u0027s said all that he can. To press him further would be heartless. It would also be meaningless, because I\u0027ve uncovered the truth that I knew must be hidden somewhere. There was a lover. Someone who has flown a flag for Andeanna all these years, waiting for a chance to avenge her. I use the word avenge, because something Joe said comes back to me and makes sense in light of this new information. He spoke of a witness to the crash who\u0027d seen flames in the car before it hit the trees. I put it together while Andrew weeps. Andeanna Menderes had a lover. A few weeks after their final romantic tryst, she perished in a fatal car wreck, even though there was nothing wrong with the car, no ice or oil slick on the road, no reason for her to swerve down a bank and crash. Add that to the report of flames in the car before it exploded, and everything clicks neatly into place. Mikis Menderes murdered his wife. The Turk found out she was cheating. Enraged, he killed her and made it look like an accident. Years later, her lover gets around to wreaking revenge and plots the Turk\u0027s downfall, hiring a lookalike to drag me into his scheme, confident that his ghostly middlewoman will ensure there\u0027s no way to link the crime back to him. I have my motive. Now all I need is to find the vengeful lover and the woman who manipulated me. Then I\u0027ll show them how I deal with people who think they can fuck with my head and heart, and blithely set me up for a fall. I carry seven ghosts around with me wherever I go, the shades of those I\u0027ve killed. There\u0027s plenty of room for two more.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-16.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
