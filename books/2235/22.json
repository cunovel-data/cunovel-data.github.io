{"id":108132,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"I spend the night in the hotel recommended by the good doctor, but although it\u0027s peaceful and I\u0027m exhausted, I sleep fitfully, tormented by questions and murkily evolving answers. At first I can\u0027t believe what my instincts are telling me. I fear that the madness of the asylum has rubbed off on me, that these are the workings of a deluded mind. I waste hours denying theories I know in my heart to be true. I shy away from the revelations and desperately explore alternate solutions, but I\u0027m damned to return each time to the warped, crazy truth. I keep fixing on the image of the doll, how Andeanna dressed it in girl\u0027s clothes and smeared its face with make-up. If I could escape that image, perhaps I could seek false answers elsewhere. But I can\u0027t lie to myself, no matter how hard I try. The truth won\u0027t let itself be denied. By morning, I can fight no longer. I don\u0027t know the complete story, but it won\u0027t be difficult to fill in the gaps. Dangerous and awful, yes, but not difficult. I know who to turn to, how to find him, how to force a confession from him if he resists. No more screwing around with lies and ghosts. We\u0027re done with that shit. Only the hellish pit of the truth remains. On an express train back to London. Lack of sleep must be getting to me, because I don\u0027t remember buying a ticket or boarding. The last thing I recall, I was having an early breakfast at the hotel. I should be worried about Bond Gardiner\u0027s warning, but I\u0027m not. I\u0027m sure I can slip in and out of the city before anyone clocks me. Exhaustion troubles me more than Gardiner\u0027s threat. I don\u0027t want to spiral out of control. I need to stay focused. Leaning back in my seat, I close my eyes, tune out the world around me and try to sleep. But I have no more success here than I did in the hotel. The doll haunts me, fills my thoughts, lets nothing distract me. Maybe the mad don\u0027t need to sleep. Maybe their insanity is all they require to sustain them. In a taxi. I\u0027ve lost track of my movements again - I have no memory of getting off the train. I look out of the window and grunt softly. I\u0027m back in London. I feel a bulge in one of my pockets. Letting my fingers steal in to explore, I trace the outline of a gun. Axel Nelke\u0027s. I must have gone to Heathrow, broken into the car and reclaimed it. Leaning forward, I ask the driver if we\u0027ll be much longer. \u0027Ten minutes, guv,\u0027 he answers cheerfully. I don\u0027t need to ask for the destination. Sitting back, I smile softly. For the first time since the asylum, I can turn away from the image of the doll and all the questions and answers that go with it. No need to guess any longer. Ten minutes, give or take, and all will be made clear. I phase out again. Next thing I know, I\u0027m stealing through the grounds of the Menderes mansion. The ghosts trail along beside me, hunched over, expressions intent, as if homing in on a scent. They look like hounds. Hungry, hellish hounds about to be fed. I sneak around back, quietly break in through a window and glide through the familiar rooms, advancing silently, encountering no one. I find my target in the pool room, playing solo, a game where losing and winning are the same, where triumph goes hand in hand with despair. I wait for him to pot the black before stepping forward to clap slowly. Gregory Menderes looks up, startled, raising his cue defensively. When he sees me, the tip of the cue drops, then lifts again, as if he can\u0027t make up his mind whether I\u0027m a threat or not. Eventually he lays the cue aside and smiles warily. \u0027Mr Sanders. May I ask how you got in?\u0027 \u0027The name\u0027s Ed Sieveking,\u0027 I reply quietly. \u0027But you already knew that, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 Greygo\u0027s eyes narrow, but he says nothing. \u0027Who\u0027s in the house with us?\u0027 \u0027Nobody,\u0027 he says with a smile. I take out the gun and aim. His smile vanishes. \u0027Nobody,\u0027 he repeats, sullenly this time. \u0027No staff?\u0027 \u0027The cleaners work early. They\u0027re finished for the day. So are the gardeners. I cook for myself most nights. There\u0027s nobody else.\u0027 \u0027No guards?\u0027 \u0027Not since my father died. I kept some here for a while, to warn off the media, but now that interest in him has diminished, they\u0027re not needed.\u0027 That\u0027s a bonus. I keep the gun trained on him, readying myself for business. \u0027I\u0027ve just come back from Darlington.\u0027 The young man\u0027s face pales - he no longer has a tan, and I\u0027m sure he never did, that he sprayed it on ahead of our meeting to disguise the natural colour of his flesh - and his jaw drops. It\u0027s the reaction I anticipated. Confirmation that I\u0027m not crazy. \u0027We\u0027re going upstairs,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027You\u0027re going to take me to wherever you store the outfits. Then you\u0027re going to change. If you act like you don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about, I\u0027ll put a bullet through you where it will really hurt.\u0027 \u0027Ed . . . \u0027 he begins. \u0027Walk, Gregory. Don\u0027t talk.\u0027 He looks at the gun and my twitching finger, nods glumly and starts for the corridor. I let him pass, seeing so much now, telltale signs I must have subconsciously noted before but paid no heed to. Bile rises up my throat but I force it down as I fall into step behind him, careful not to get too close, taking no risks, not when I\u0027m so close to the truth that I can feel it sliding through the hairs of my nape like a snake. If Greygo is afraid - and he must be - he masks it well. That doesn\u0027t surprise me. He\u0027s used to hiding his emotions. His training in RADA, his years on the stage, his preference for character roles. I recall Andrew Moore telling me that his grandson could be a star, that fame was his for the taking. But Gregory Menderes was never interested in fame, only in honing his craft, perfecting the art of getting into the skin of the people he was pretending to be. I wish I\u0027d researched his background more thoroughly, looked into the roles he\u0027d taken over the years. I bet I would have found precursors. Joe and I focused on Andeanna and Mikis. We never dug into their son\u0027s past in great depth. Didn\u0027t think he was worth the study. Joe . . . What would he think of this? I can never tell him, whatever the outcome. I can never tell anyone. This is the sort of truth you carry deep in your heart and never reveal. If I walk out of this alive, I\u0027ll invent something for Joe. I\u0027m good at that. I carved a living out of stories once upon a time. Greygo leads me to his mother\u0027s bedroom and heads for a built-in wardrobe. \u0027Hold it,\u0027 I snap, edging ahead of him, sliding open the doors. There are four shelves loaded with clothes and boxes. \u0027Are these the costumes?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 he says. \u0027But there\u0027s also a bag stowed away beneath the lowest shelf. I\u0027ll need that to create the full effect.\u0027 I back out of the closet and tap the gun\u0027s trigger with my finger. \u0027Don\u0027t come up with anything that looks remotely like a weapon,\u0027 I warn him. Greygo gets down on his knees and reaches into the dark. He emerges with a stuffed plastic bag. I tell him to dump the contents on the floor in the middle of the room. A shower of padding, corsets, bras, tights, knickers. I stare at the undergarments, then clear my throat, forcing back the bile, which is rising again. \u0027Put them on,\u0027 I croak. He undresses without argument, revealing a smooth, shaven chest, arms and legs. He pauses at his boxer shorts. \u0027Would you mind looking away?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Ed, please, there\u0027s no need to - \u0027 \u0027Just do it.\u0027 Greygo sighs dolefully, then slides down his shorts. His genitals have been waxed bare. His nudity unsettles me. I\u0027m not homophobic, but seeing him like this, thinking of all that has passed between us, I feel nauseous. Though not as much as many men in my position might. I\u0027m surprised by that. I thought I\u0027d be more bothered by the gender side of things. Maybe I will be, later, when I\u0027ve had time to think and reflect. Right now, everything has the unreal quality of a dream. \u0027Get dressed,\u0027 I snarl, averting my gaze. It\u0027s a complicated process. Each step must be followed in exact order. It looks uncomfortable, especially around the groin, but Greygo seems at ease and takes no notice of the biting straps. With all the padding in place, in all the right places, he rolls on the tights and fastens the bra over the synthetic but real-looking breasts. Then he returns to the wardrobe. He picks a red dress, steps into it and slides it up over the tights, straps and padding. I expect him to turn and ask me to zip him up at the back, but he manages it himself, then slips into a pair of high-heeled shoes. Then there\u0027s just the wig. He takes it out of a box, fixes it in place, throws his head back and beams at me, turning on his full range of charms. My breath catches in my throat. I step backwards, shocked, almost dropping the gun. The disguise will need a few more touches before it\u0027s perfect. His features are incredibly similar to his mother\u0027s, but there\u0027s still something masculine about his face minus make-up and lipstick, earrings and eyelashes. And he needs to add coloured contacts. Yet even at this halfway stage, the figure is unmistakable. \u0027Andeanna,\u0027 I groan. Gregory Menderes raises an eyebrow, purses his lips and says in her voice, \u0027The one and only.\u0027 He grins sexily. \u0027A kiss for old times\u0027 sake, Ed?\u0027 I can\u0027t answer. I can only stare at the face of the man who is the woman I fell in love with and killed for, and wait for the furies of insanity to sweep down from the tormented heavens and take me. Greygo sits at the dressing table, working on his face. I watch Andeanna swim into being in the mirror, and I\u0027m amazed by the transformation. It isn\u0027t just the look. As he progresses, he becomes a woman - the way he moves his hands and arches his neck, the frame of his shoulders, the subtle sway of his hips as he leans forwards and backwards on the chair, the way he crosses his legs. Even knowing who it really is, I have to forcibly remind myself that this isn\u0027t Andeanna - a he, not a she, a cruel conspirator to be executed, not a restored lover to be adored. \u0027It was a set-up from the start, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 I mutter. \u0027Of course,\u0027 he answers in Andeanna\u0027s voice. \u0027Not like that,\u0027 I snap. \u0027Use your own voice.\u0027 \u0027This is my voice, darling,\u0027 he answers without changing key. \u0027Stop it,\u0027 I warn him, \u0027or so help me . . . \u0027 He sighs like Andeanna did when talking about her life with the Turk. \u0027You don\u0027t understand, Ed. When I\u0027m dressed like this, when I have this body and face, I am my mother. I can\u0027t alter my voice to suit you. If you want me to speak as Greygo, I\u0027ll have to shed these clothes. Do you want me to do that?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 It\u0027s difficult facing him in this guise, but if he took it off, I\u0027d spend the rest of the conversation wanting him to put it back on. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d be able to believe he\u0027s Andeanna - my Andeanna - without seeing him as her all the time. \u0027One question before we start. Did you arrange the murder of your father to get your hands on his money?\u0027 Andeanna shakes her . . . No. I must think of him as he really is. Greygo shakes his head. \u0027Nothing that venal,\u0027 he says. \u0027I\u0027m surprised you had to ask.\u0027 \u0027Just wanted to make sure.\u0027 Sitting on the bed, I rest the gun in my lap and nod for him to begin. \u0027I assume you know the full story, how my mother discovered my father in flagrante delicto and lost her head?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Good. That saves us a lot of time. Let\u0027s cut to my beginning. Love for my mother took precedence over all others. That included love for my father and you.\u0027 \u0027For me!\u0027 I snort. He smiles but doesn\u0027t press the point. \u0027My mother always knew that I was . . . shall we say special?\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s say bent as a boomerang,\u0027 I correct him. He shrugs. \u0027I was never overly bothered about sex, so it\u0027s a moot point. I wasn\u0027t afraid of what I was, but I was conscious of my father and how the truth would hurt him. It was hard enough telling him I was intent on becoming an actor, but if I\u0027d told him I was gay . . . I think he could have forced himself to accept me, but it would have stung him to his core. I didn\u0027t want to bring more misery into his life, not after what had happened with my mother, so I\u0027ve been mostly celibate. I even had a few flings with women, to make it look as if I was a hot-blooded hetero. Anyway, my sexual orientation isn\u0027t the issue here.\u0027 \u0027Isn\u0027t it?\u0027 He shakes his head. \u0027What my mother saw in me as a child wasn\u0027t a craving for cock - pardon me for being so crude - but a desire to be feminine. I loved dressing up, trying on beautiful clothes and undergarments. I wanted to be part of that world of glamour and disguise. Sex had nothing to do with it. \u0027She knew I used to sneak into her room and raid her wardrobe. In fact, sometimes I\u0027d find clothes that were too small for her, which I\u0027m sure she bought with me in mind. My father, on the other hand, knew nothing about it until he discovered me dressed in one of her outfits when I was nine years old. He thrashed me to within an inch of my life.\u0027 Greygo\u0027s face softens. \u0027I never blamed him. It\u0027s how people of his generation thought. Hell, it\u0027s how many of our generation think.\u0027 Greygo smirks at me. \u0027What about you, Ed? We never discussed it before. Where do you stand on the homosexual issue?\u0027 \u0027Live and let live,\u0027 I grunt. \u0027I\u0027ve no problem with gays. But I\u0027ve no interest in them either.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a shame,\u0027 he murmurs, pouting playfully. I stare at those lips. I think about all the times I\u0027ve kissed them. The hardcore hetero in me wants me to recoil, to maybe bash them to shreds, to make him pay for what he did. But in truth, I\u0027m not bothered. I should be, but I\u0027m not. I loved Andeanna so much that I don\u0027t think I would have cared if she\u0027d turned out to be a tranny, not if everything else had been on the level. I could have lived with that. It was an adjustment I would have been happy to make. For her. \u0027That was the only time he hit me,\u0027 Greygo continues. \u0027After that, I went underground, with the help of my mother. She took me under her wing and let me dress up when he wasn\u0027t around. She taught me how to apply make-up and wear the clothes, but also how to remove all traces of my alter ego when I left her room. Through her, I learnt the importance of separating one\u0027s identities. \u0027She was so brave,\u0027 he says softly. \u0027My father would have beaten her terribly if he\u0027d found out. It was the one time in her life that she betrayed him, and she did it for my sake.\u0027 \u0027Not the only time,\u0027 I contradict him. \u0027There was her affair, too.\u0027 He chuckles. \u0027With Axel Nelke? Surely you know better by now. I don\u0027t know where Andrew got the idea that she was having an affair. Bond played along with the lie for reasons of his own. So did I. But you must have come to understand how devoted and loyal she was. She could never have betrayed my father.\u0027 To my surprise, I realize he doesn\u0027t know about her fling with Gardiner. A spiteful part of me wants to immediately shatter his illusions, but that would mean a detour, and I don\u0027t want to waste time. I came here to learn, not enlighten. \u0027I was devastated when she died,\u0027 he continues, eyes cloudy. \u0027It wasn\u0027t just my mother I\u0027d lost, but my teacher, confidante and friend. She wasn\u0027t only a huge part of my regular life, but all of my secret life.\u0027 I start to say how hard it must have been, sympathizing with him out of habit, then stop and frown. \u0027But she isn\u0027t dead.\u0027 \u0027I know that now,\u0027 he says, \u0027but I didn\u0027t then. At the time I thought, along with the rest of the world, that she\u0027d perished in a car crash. I mourned for many years before I discovered she was still alive.\u0027 \u0027How did you find out?\u0027 I ask, then silently warn myself to be careful - he almost has me feeling sorry for him. I have to remember what he\u0027s done. Save the pity for myself. \u0027I\u0027d known for a long time that something wasn\u0027t right with my father, the way he responded when my mother\u0027s name was mentioned, the guarded looks he shared with Bond. I began to eavesdrop on conversations and search through his files when he was away, to no avail. \u0027The breakthrough came when I was arrested.\u0027 He laughs. \u0027I used to visit tranny bars and clubs - for the fashion, not casual sex. I was at a private party when it was raided. Since I was underage, I was taken into custody. I had to phone someone but I didn\u0027t dare call my father, so I rang Bond. I knew my mother had relied on him and hoped that I could too. He bailed me out and took me back to his place. \u0027Bond said nothing about what I\u0027d been up to - he didn\u0027t want to know. He mixed a drink for me, let me have a bath, lent me some of his clothes. Then he was summoned away on business. My snooping instincts got the better of me. I found letters from St Michael\u0027s Psychiatric Hospital referring to a patient by the name of Deleena Emerson. I got straight on the line to her doctor and demanded to know the truth. I threatened to expose him if he refused to cooperate. \u0027I was appalled,\u0027 Greygo mumbles. \u0027My father loved her. I couldn\u0027t understand how he could have done that to her. I didn\u0027t know about Christina Whiteoak at the time, and could think of no reason why he . . . \u0027 Greygo can\u0027t bring himself to say \u0027ruined her life\u0027 or \u0027destroyed her\u0027. It\u0027s the first true indication I\u0027ve seen that Gregory Menderes really did love his father. \u0027Did you go see her?\u0027 I ask. \u0027Of course. I fled, hailed the first cab I found and offered the driver as much as he wanted to drive me to Darlington. When I got there . . . \u0027 He stops, lips thinning. \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027You can skip this bit. I\u0027ve seen her. I can imagine.\u0027 He nods gratefully. \u0027Cutting a long story short, I sat down with Bond when I got back and forced the story out of him. I couldn\u0027t approach my father. I never did. To the very end he assumed that I thought she was dead. \u0027I didn\u0027t know what to do. I wanted to hate somebody, but who? Not Bond - he was only following orders. Not the staff at St Michael\u0027s - they were strangers who had been bullied or bribed. There was only one person I could truly hate, and that was the one person I could never bring myself to despise - my father.\u0027 \u0027Explain how you couldn\u0027t hate him,\u0027 I interject. Greygo shrugs. \u0027I loved him.\u0027 \u0027But he stole your mother from you. He wiped her mind and locked her away in a madhouse.\u0027 \u0027I know, but that aside . . . \u0027 He laughs sickly. \u0027What I mean is, I knew I should hate him, I knew I had to hate him, but I couldn\u0027t make myself. I wanted him to pay for what he\u0027d done, but I could no more attack him than I could cut out my own heart then sew it back in again. I couldn\u0027t hate or harm him, Ed. But Andeanna Menderes could.\u0027 Greygo rises from his chair at the dressing table and turns. He looks so feminine that for a moment I truly forget who he is and almost race across to clutch Andeanna and kiss her and tell her how much I\u0027ve missed her. I catch myself in time, but only just. \u0027This isn\u0027t a mere disguise,\u0027 Greygo says, taking several steps towards me. \u0027I\u0027m not just pretending to be a woman. When I transform, I transform completely. When I was with you as Andeanna, I didn\u0027t know where I ended and my mother began. I wasn\u0027t playing. I was Andeanna Menderes.\u0027 \u0027Are you pleading innocence?\u0027 I sneer. \u0027Copping some fucked-up schizophrenic plea? It wasn\u0027t me, it was my mummy. Is that what you\u0027re trying to pull?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he sighs. \u0027I planned the seduction and the assassination. I was behind it all, and self-aware every step of the way. But when I was immersed in the part, it was total immersion. It went beyond role-playing. Look at me. Listen to me.\u0027 He touches his throat and strokes it sensuously. \u0027I have to speak like this when I become her. I have no voice of my own right now. If my life depended on it, I couldn\u0027t do Greygo\u0027s voice or any of the others.\u0027 I stare at him blankly. \u0027What others?\u0027 He looks surprised. \u0027I thought you knew.\u0027 I think furiously and it hits me. \u0027Etienne Anders. You were the mystic.\u0027 \u0027Naturally. How else could she have replicated the voice? Etienne was my weakest creation. You would have seen through her if you hadn\u0027t been so preoccupied. I never really got under her skin. I threw on a lot of make-up and clothes, but I never felt like a true medium.\u0027 I grin grudgingly as I think back. He\u0027s right - I should have seen it. The forced joviality, the heavy make-up, the pitch-perfect voice when she summoned Andeanna, the facial similarities. Last night, when I was putting it all together, I assumed that the mystic was a paid cohort, but of course it was much safer for the master actor to simply assume another disguise and play the part himself. I frown as I think back to what Greygo said - others, plural. \u0027Who else were you?\u0027 I ask, running through all the faces I\u0027ve encountered recently, searching for any that might have been Greygo in drag. \u0027Only one more,\u0027 he says, his smile slipping. \u0027Who?\u0027 He hesitates. \u0027It\u0027s not relevant.\u0027 \u0027Tell me,\u0027 I growl. \u0027You won\u0027t like it. I had to get close to you, to know what made you tick, to keep tabs on you.\u0027 I don\u0027t know what he\u0027s getting at. Who could he have been? One of the staff at the Royal Munster? I think of Fred Lloyd and smile at the absurdity. I flash on more faces, as many as I can recall, but none matches. \u0027I give up,\u0027 I mutter. \u0027You really want to know?\u0027 I glare at him archly. \u0027OK,\u0027 he says, removing his wig and lowering his head. He rolls his shoulders and spreads his legs, instantly becoming more masculine, even in the dress and make-up. When he looks up again, he\u0027s smiling, and there\u0027s something hauntingly familiar in that smile. In spite of the feeling that I should recognize him, I can\u0027t place him until he speaks in a light northern brogue. \u0027Have a good trip up north, Ed? Should have taken me along. We could have gone to the footie. You haven\u0027t seen the beautiful game played properly till you\u0027ve seen it in the Stadium of Light.\u0027 Regardless of the face, I\u0027d know that voice anywhere. It\u0027s the voice of the one true friend I\u0027ve made since Belinda tricked me all those years ago, the one person apart from Andeanna who I let into my life. Joe. In an instant, the rest of the mystery clicks into place. Joe was the one I turned to when I ran into trouble with Andeanna. He was a sympathetic audience, always there for me, except when Andeanna was around. Greygo was both my lover and my best friend. What one couldn\u0027t find out about me, the other could. As shocked as I am, I have to admire the genius behind it. Gregory Menderes is in a different class. I\u0027ve known some sly bastards in my time, but Greygo puts them all in the shade. He played me with contemptuous ease. His only mistake was to not finish me off after I\u0027d killed his father. I wonder how he botched such a vital part of the plan. Were there others he wanted me to kill while I was at it? \u0027I spent months dressing up as her, slipping further into the disguise.\u0027 The words come suddenly out of the silence. Looking up, I see that Greygo is wiping away the make-up. He\u0027s still wearing the dress but is speaking as himself now, not as Andeanna or Joe. I must have blanked out for a while, but he hasn\u0027t seized the chance to turn on me. \u0027I\u0027d never tried so hard to become someone else. It had to be perfect if it was going to work. I went on holidays and masqueraded as my mother the whole time, sleeping as her, eating as her, flirting as her. I took men back to my room and made love to them, testing the bounds of my disguise. I made mistakes to begin with, but eventually I learnt to mask every last masculine trace. I discovered how to make a man love me but never know me, how to be and not just be like. Then I was ready.\u0027 He licks his lips. Small dabs of lipstick cling to them like faded bloodstains. \u0027You weren\u0027t the first,\u0027 he says sheepishly. \u0027There were two others before you, a couple of your fellow assassins. I approached them as I approached you, tried to make them fall in love with me. It didn\u0027t work. I could attract them, but I - \u0027 \u0027Wait,\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027I don\u0027t get it. Why not just hire someone to kill him?\u0027 \u0027I tried, several times, wheedled names out of Bond and my father, approached a variety of contacts openly and offered them a fortune to accept the hit. They wouldn\u0027t bite. In the guise of my mother, I had to be a woman with no history - they all thought that she was dead, so I had to use my Deleena Emerson alias. The trouble was, no assassin would take on a target like the Turk when their would-be employer was a nobody who couldn\u0027t offer them protection from the Turk\u0027s men when they came gunning for revenge. As Greygo I might have been able to convince one of them, but I couldn\u0027t authorize a hit as myself. It had to be as my mother. So I decided to create a scene.\u0027 \u0027A scene,\u0027 I grunt. \u0027That\u0027s it. You staged a film noir plot. A scheming femme fatale seduces a capable but gullible patsy, spins him a tale of woe involving life with her abusive husband, and . . . \u0027 I nod at the cunning of it. \u0027That\u0027s how it was,\u0027 Greygo agrees. \u0027Only it didn\u0027t work to begin with. I wasn\u0027t able to believe in the scene. I could calmly plot in the safety of my room, but out in the real world I had to become one with the story. I needed to be as convinced by the piece as those I sucked in. I couldn\u0027t do that with the first two assassins. I was beginning to think I could never do it with anyone. Then you fell into my life.\u0027 He crosses the room and kneels in front of me. Extends his hands and cups my face. If he dropped his fingers, he could wrench the gun from me and fire before I had a chance to react. But he doesn\u0027t. \u0027If it\u0027s any comfort, I really am a fan of your books. I read Nights of Fear and Summer\u0027s Shades before I learnt your true identity.\u0027 I blink. \u0027Do you really think this is the right time to be praising my work?\u0027 He giggles. \u0027It\u0027s relevant, because that\u0027s how it started. I found myself discussing your books with a friend of my father\u0027s at a party one night. That friend was Carter Phell.\u0027 \u0027Carter,\u0027 I groan. I should have known my old mentor would come back to haunt me. The past is never truly dead and buried. \u0027To Phell\u0027s credit, he changed the subject,\u0027 Greygo continues. \u0027It was only later, after he\u0027d had a few drinks, that he tracked me down and asked if I knew who you used to be. He wanted to share his juicy titbit with the one person he\u0027d met who\u0027d actually read Ed Sieveking\u0027s books. He didn\u0027t do it to drop you in the shit - he knew I wasn\u0027t part of my father\u0027s seedier affairs, that I wouldn\u0027t try to exploit the information. In his own strange way, he was proud of you and wanted me to know how far you\u0027d come. \u0027I\u0027d researched the other assassins as best I could, but there\u0027s only so much you can unearth about men who operate as hired killers. You can\u0027t get close to them. Writers are different. They welcome questions and love to share. It\u0027s much easier to get to know a writer, to learn about him, to consume.\u0027 Greygo tells me how he scoured the internet for interviews with me. He attended conventions where I was present, sometimes flying halfway round the world to hear me speak. He tracked down those who knew me, agents and publishers, and carefully pumped them for info about me. It wasn\u0027t enough. He couldn\u0027t get inside my head. He didn\u0027t want to approach me cold, as Andeanna, so he invented Joe to get close to me. He corresponded with me, taking his time, doing nothing to arouse my suspicions. He had no set plan for luring me to London. But he had a hunch that one day things would fall neatly into place. As they did when I got interested in spontaneous human combustion after he had mentioned it in a few emails. \u0027From that moment, you played into my hands,\u0027 he sighs. \u0027There was nothing odd about me inviting you to London then - it looked like I was doing it in response to your plans to write a book about a subject I had turned you on to. It was natural that, in my excitement, I\u0027d ask you to come here so that I could share the research with you. \u0027I made Joe a child of the Troubles, allowing me to cover up - because of his supposed scars, I was able to wear thick clothes and stick padding down the arms and legs to make me seem larger than I am. You accepted the beard because I had a good reason for wearing it. You also didn\u0027t look at my face too closely because you didn\u0027t want me thinking that you were searching for traces of my scars.\u0027 \u0027You thought of everything, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 I snort. \u0027I had to,\u0027 he mutters. \u0027I was nervous the first time we met, but the more time we spent together, the less acting I had to do, until by the end, Joe was every bit as real to me as my mother. You never thought of connecting either of them to Gregory Menderes, because both were real, individual, complete. \u0027I think you can work out the rest,\u0027 Greygo says, rocking back on his heels. \u0027I juggled the alter egos, careful never to cross my wires. It wasn\u0027t easy going from your arms as Andeanna to your side as Joe, remembering what you\u0027d told me as one and trying not to let that knowledge leak through the lips of the other.\u0027 \u0027A virtuoso performance,\u0027 I remark bitingly. He shrugs. \u0027I don\u0027t think you can summarize it that simply. I wasn\u0027t acting - like I told you already, I became those people. I created souls, not just faces and bodies, and carried them within me, as separate and whole as my own.\u0027 \u0027Fancy words,\u0027 I snort. \u0027The truth,\u0027 he insists. \u0027What do you know about truth?\u0027 I sneer. \u0027You\u0027re one big walking, talking, stalking fucking lie. Souls? You have to be human to comprehend the quality of a soul. I\u0027ll tell you this, though.\u0027 I raise the gun and press the muzzle to his forehead. \u0027Souls are real. They do move on. And when you die, yours is going all the way to hell, you sick, twisted fuck.\u0027 He doesn\u0027t display any fear, just gazes at me with a look that\u0027s half pity, half . . . what? \u0027Don\u0027t you understand?\u0027 I growl. \u0027I\u0027m going to kill you.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 he says. \u0027I know.\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t bother you?\u0027 He makes a gurgling sound. \u0027Life hasn\u0027t been much to speak of recently. Part of the reason I slipped so easily into character was because I preferred being Joe and Andeanna. They were sweet. They could sleep at night, untouched by nightmares. They didn\u0027t look into mirrors and see a monster. I was happier as them. If I could go on being them, maybe I\u0027d fear death. But I\u0027m Greygo now. It\u0027s just me. And I hate myself. That\u0027s why I\u0027m not afraid. Without my mother, my father, Joe, you . . . I\u0027m nothing, just an empty shadow of a man. Death will be a relief.\u0027 Tears trickle down his cheeks. It could be an act - he is, after all, an actor of the highest calibre - but I don\u0027t think so. I believe he\u0027s truly as miserable and lonely as he claims. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you kill me?\u0027 I sob, tears coming again to these once barren eyes. \u0027Wasn\u0027t that the plan, to set me up and have me murdered too?\u0027 He nods. \u0027Once you\u0027d killed my father, it would have been simple to step into his room and remove the evidence of Sebastian Dash, plant my own in its place. I had articles of yours stored away, to frame you with. And I was ruthless enough. I lured poor Axel to his death to test you, a trial run for the real thing. As Andeanna, I could be as brutal as I needed to be.\u0027 \u0027So why didn\u0027t you?\u0027 I scream. \u0027You know why,\u0027 he says. \u0027No. I don\u0027t. Why?\u0027 He looks down, tears blackening his face. When he looks up again, there\u0027s a world of wanting and pain in his eyes. \u0027I couldn\u0027t kill you,\u0027 he weeps. \u0027I turned somersaults to spare you. I knew we were finished as Ed and Andeanna, but I hoped we could continue as Ed and Joe. I wanted you to flee and carry on with your life. I would have followed. We could have been friends. Even though I knew it might backfire on me, I couldn\u0027t bring myself to finish you off. I had to . . . let you . . . go.\u0027 He\u0027s sobbing deeply. So am I. We\u0027re almost beyond words. But I have to know. Before the end, I must have it all explained. \u0027Tell me the truth. Why didn\u0027t you betray me?\u0027 He looks up, locks gazes and says in as close to silence as a whisper can ever be, \u0027Because I love you.\u0027 I thought I\u0027d fallen as far into the madness as I could. I was wrong. \u0027You love me?\u0027 I splutter, incensed by the disgraceful claim. \u0027Crazy, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 he croaks. \u0027You can\u0027t mean that. You can\u0027t!\u0027 \u0027But I do. I love you, Ed, and I know you\u0027re going to kill me anyway, but you forced me to say it, so I have.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t love. You\u0027re a monster.\u0027 \u0027I wish I was,\u0027 he says softly. \u0027But this was always about love. Love for my mother and father, then love for you. It wouldn\u0027t have been so fucked-up if I could have distanced myself emotionally from any one of you. Love\u0027s a bitch. You know love brought us here. Deny it all you like, but you know. It doesn\u0027t make sense any other way.\u0027 I look inside myself for a scathing remark, only to find to my dismay that he\u0027s right. About everything. I wish with all my being that he wasn\u0027t, that he was an evil, calculating bastard, or a sick fuck who\u0027d put me through hell for kicks, but he isn\u0027t. He\u0027s a lonely, hurt, resourceful, talented young man whose love for those closest to him has led to the ruin of us all. \u0027You know the really crazy thing?\u0027 I ask quietly. My lips lift in a self-mocking sneer. \u0027I love you too.\u0027 He stares at me wordlessly, not shocked by the revelation, but by my expression of it. \u0027After all you\u0027ve done, regardless of your sex, you\u0027re still the person I fell in love with, the one I would have given the world for.\u0027 \u0027Ed . . . \u0027 he moans. I look down at the gun, then toss it to the floor. Killing him isn\u0027t an option. Manipulator and liar though he is, he\u0027s Andeanna, he\u0027s Joe, he\u0027s all that has come to mean anything to me. I can hate him, but I can\u0027t kill him, just as I couldn\u0027t kill Belinda when she betrayed me. Gregory Menderes chose his patsy well. As if in a dream, I rise and face the door. \u0027Ed?\u0027 Greygo says behind me. \u0027So long, Andeanna.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re leaving?\u0027 I stop but don\u0027t look back. \u0027You want me to stay?\u0027 \u0027Of course!\u0027 He gets to his feet and shuffles towards me. \u0027No,\u0027 I murmur. He draws to a halt. \u0027Ed?\u0027 he says again, fearful this time. \u0027You\u0027ve destroyed me,\u0027 I whisper. \u0027But you said you love me.\u0027 \u0027I do.\u0027 \u0027Then you\u0027ve got to stay. We can make this work. We can save each other. It won\u0027t be easy, but if nothing good comes of this, we\u0027re finished, the two of us.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re finished already,\u0027 I sigh. \u0027No!\u0027 he protests. \u0027Is it because I\u0027m a man? I can change that. Everything\u0027s possible. If you\u0027re patient, I can alter my sex, become Andeanna for real.\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 I smile bitterly. \u0027Like I said, that isn\u0027t a problem for me. I thought it would be, but it\u0027s not. Guess I\u0027m more metrosexual than I assumed. Don\u0027t become someone else again. Be yourself. It\u0027s time.\u0027 \u0027But if you leave . . . \u0027 \u0027Goodbye, Greygo.\u0027 \u0027Ed!\u0027 he howls. \u0027You\u0027ve destroyed me,\u0027 I whisper again, only this time to myself, and I make for the door. \u0027Ed! No! We can . . . \u0027 he starts, but he\u0027s too late. It\u0027s over. I\u0027m gone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-22.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
