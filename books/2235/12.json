{"id":108122,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"My ghosts are my only company over the next couple of days and nights, keeping the same silent vigil they\u0027ve maintained these past six years. I don\u0027t know why they can\u0027t make noise. If they\u0027re creatures of my own creation, there\u0027s no reason why I shouldn\u0027t be capable of providing them with voices as well as faces. If they\u0027re real, in the course of my research I\u0027ve encountered plenty of other spirits that have no trouble causing a ruckus.\n Axel Nelke has settled in swiftly. Apart from his first sly attack on the Tube platform, he hasn\u0027t attempted to unnerve me, slotting into the cluster of ghosts as if he\u0027s been one of the gang for years. I\u0027m guessing (if they\u0027re real) that they have some means of communicating with each other, or else they just react instinctively when they come back from the dead.\n I truly thought I\u0027d left the killing behind, that nothing could drive me to murder again. I hoped I might one day be able to atone for my crimes, that the ghosts would see I\u0027d repented, forgive me and move on - or that I\u0027d forgive myself and disperse them if they were inner projections. But I was deluding myself. The killer is still alive and hungry within me. Part of me rejoiced when I killed Axel Nelke. Part of me had been waiting longingly for another chance to lash out and taste blood. And that dark, dreadful, needful part of me wants to do it again.\n When my cell phone rings in the middle of the night, I spring awake, lean over and answer instantly, \u0027Andeanna.\u0027\n A startled pause. \u0027How did you know it was me?\u0027\n \u0027Who else would be ringing - \u0027 I check my watch - \u0027at four in the morning?\u0027\n \u0027One of your other mistresses,\u0027 she teases.\n \u0027They never ring before nine,\u0027 I joke, sitting up in the darkness, joyous that she\u0027s called, but terrified too. What if she says she never wants to see me again?\n \u0027I\u0027ve missed you,\u0027 she sighs.\n \u0027Does that mean . . . ?\u0027 I ask hopefully.\n \u0027That I want to be with you? Yes.\u0027\n My heart glows hot. \u0027I love you,\u0027 I croak.\n \u0027I love you too,\u0027 she replies simply, wonderfully.\n \u0027So. What now?\u0027 I ask.\n She doesn\u0027t answer straight away. Maybe she has no answer. Or maybe she\u0027s just reluctant to voice it. Then, in a morose tone which might be funny under other circumstances, she says, \u0027We have to kill Mikis, don\u0027t we?\u0027\n \u0027If we want to be together, yes.\u0027\n \u0027We couldn\u0027t just run away?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027d always be looking over our shoulders, worrying, wondering. Fear would destroy us.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s Greygo\u0027s father,\u0027 she says.\n \u0027He\u0027s a worthless son of a bitch,\u0027 I retaliate. \u0027Your son is the only one who\u0027ll miss him. Apart from maybe a couple of his favourite whores.\u0027\n She sighs. \u0027We won\u0027t get away with it. His men are loyal, especially Bond. They\u0027d come after us.\u0027\n \u0027Not if we do it right.\u0027\n A long, long silence follows. Then, \u0027Tell me how.\u0027\n And our sinister pact is sealed.\n Killing Mikis Menderes is relatively easy. Making sure the finger of blame doesn\u0027t point at Andeanna is the hard part. His men won\u0027t rest until they\u0027ve flushed out the assassin and his employer. They\u0027ll suspect everyone, starting with her and her son, since they have the most to gain.\n \u0027Not me,\u0027 she snorts. \u0027Mikis has willed everything to Greygo. I get nothing.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s good,\u0027 I mutter. \u0027But it\u0027s not enough. We need to divert their attention. Make it look like an accident or throw them a scapegoat.\u0027\n \u0027How do we do that?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll have to think about it.\u0027\n When she hangs up, I head for the shower, where I can think more clearly under the rush of flowing water. The basic frame of a plan comes to me almost immediately. Before anything else, I need to acquire a gun. That might have been a problem previously, but Axel Nelke\u0027s pistol is waiting for me at Heathrow. I smile grimly at how I obeyed my instinct to leave it in the car. Part of me must have guessed this was where things were heading. I was thinking further ahead than I realized when I held on to the gun.\n Stepping out of the shower, I dry myself, then dress, slip a thin pair of gloves into the pockets of my jacket and catch the Tube to Heathrow. This time I stay well clear of the platform edges on the way.\n I buy a hat and sunglasses in a shop at the airport, put them on in a restroom, then catch a bus to the car park. In the lot, having pulled on the gloves, I stumble around for a while, acting lost in case the Turk\u0027s people have tracked down the car and set a team on watch. Spotting nobody suspicious, I stop and open the unlocked driver\u0027s door, digging into my pocket first and pretending to produce a set of keys. I get in.\n The air is stale and the seat is cold. I keep my hands on the wheel, staring ahead as if in deep contemplation. After a minute, my left hand sneaks down the side of the seat. My fingers touch cool metal. I drag it forward, hook a finger through the trigger guard and hoist it up. I glance down to make sure the safety\u0027s on, then jam it inside my jacket.\n If there were people around, I\u0027d make a show of starting the engine and letting it cut out, curse as I left the car, pretend to go off in search of a mechanic. But I\u0027m alone, so I simply step out, walk away, get the bus to the terminal then the Tube back to the Royal Munster, where I store the gun in my safe.\n Weapon secured, I sit down with a pen and writing pad and work on my plan. I jot down names - mine, Andeanna\u0027s, Axel Nelke\u0027s, the Turk\u0027s, Bond Gardiner\u0027s - and draw lines between them. I need to point the finger of blame at Nelke. Killing the Turk with Nelke\u0027s gun will be a good start, but the gun then has to fall into Bond Gardiner\u0027s hands, so he can trace it back to the missing guard. I can\u0027t post it to him or leave it at the scene of the crime. He won\u0027t accept Nelke as the villain of the piece if I frame him clumsily. There has to be a legitimate way of tying him to the hit . . .\n I smile tightly as the answer hits me. I add a new word to the page, in capitals - ASSASSIN. I operated anonymously when I was in the game, but others weren\u0027t so modest. Some signed their work like an artist. If I could drag one of those into the scheme, I\u0027d have an excuse to leave behind incriminating evidence. Gardiner could trace that to the assassin, then the gun through the assassin to Nelke.\n I wouldn\u0027t under normal circumstances think of double-crossing a hired killer - far too dangerous - but I have a man in mind who fits the criteria perfectly, who not only signs his kills but has a score to settle with the Turk. On top of that, he\u0027s a man I\u0027d love to drop in the shit. There are still a lot of details to iron out, but I can feel the plan taking firmer shape. It\u0027s only a matter of time before the tumblers of death click fatally into place.\n In the afternoon, my thoughts turn to Joe. The plot I\u0027m hatching is far from foolproof, and I don\u0027t want him getting sucked in if things go wrong. I have to sever the link between us. It won\u0027t be pleasant, but it\u0027s for his own good.\n He answers brightly when I call. \u0027Hi, Ed. What\u0027s up?\u0027\n \u0027Joe,\u0027 I reply tonelessly, \u0027we have a problem.\u0027\n \u0027What sort of problem?\u0027\n \u0027My agent told my editor about our partnership and she kicked up a stink. The publishers are afraid of getting caught in the middle of a legal war if we fall out with one another.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s crazy,\u0027 Joe grunts.\n \u0027I know. But I\u0027m just the writer. My opinion doesn\u0027t count.\u0027 Joe laughs. \u0027Tell them to send me a contract. I\u0027ll sign whatever they want.\u0027\n \u0027Jonathan suggested that, but they didn\u0027t bite. They say it\u0027s a straight-up Ed Sieveking book or the deal\u0027s off.\u0027\n Joe\u0027s sigh pains me, but there\u0027s worse to come and I steel myself against it. \u0027I guess that leaves me out in the cold,\u0027 he says, trying not to sound disappointed. \u0027Still, the most I hoped for when we began was a mention, so I can\u0027t be too upset.\u0027\n \u0027Actually, that\u0027s not possible either.\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027 he asks, bewildered.\n \u0027Jonathan wants to exclude you entirely. He wants me to say I did all the research and planning by myself. He thinks that if I mention you in the book or in interviews, you could stake a claim to royalties. I went ballistic at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I came round to his way of thinking.\u0027 Stunned silence greets that last statement. \u0027Joe? Are you there?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m here,\u0027 he says weakly.\n \u0027I mean, it\u0027s not as if you contributed substantial ideas,\u0027 I rush on. \u0027You certainly helped, and it\u0027s a shame we can\u0027t acknowledge that, but you only had the barest creative input, right?\u0027\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 he answers shakily.\n \u0027I\u0027d hate it if this got to court. You\u0027d hate that too, wouldn\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027I guess,\u0027 he says. He sounds dazed.\n \u0027So you\u0027ll sign away all claims to the book?\u0027\n \u0027Sign away? But I never made any in the first place. How can I - \u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ll send you a form,\u0027 I cut in. \u0027A disclaimer. Once you\u0027ve put your name to it, we can meet up again, share a few drinks and laugh about it all.\u0027\n \u0027You mean . . . \u0027 He clears his throat. \u0027You don\u0027t want to see me until the form\u0027s been signed?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t want to see you. I can\u0027t. It\u0027ll be for the best if we keep out of each other\u0027s way until the book\u0027s been in the shops a while.\u0027\n \u0027What if we don\u0027t talk about the book?\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, Joe. Lawyer\u0027s orders. I\u0027ve worked a long time for this break. You don\u0027t want to wreck it for me, do you?\u0027\n \u0027Of course not.\u0027\n \u0027So!\u0027 I boom hollowly. \u0027I\u0027m glad that\u0027s out of the way. It\u0027s a pain, but I guess that\u0027s part of the price of success.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Joe says sickly.\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 I chuckle, \u0027after all this fuss, the book probably won\u0027t sell shit.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Joe disagrees. \u0027It\u0027s going to be a great book. I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be a hit.\u0027\n I wince. This would be easier if he lost his rag and cursed the hell out of me. \u0027I\u0027ll let you go,\u0027 I say, jovial to the end. \u0027I\u0027ll send you an advance copy of the book when it\u0027s ready, no matter what those bastards say.\u0027\n \u0027That would be nice.\u0027\n \u0027See you around?\u0027\n \u0027Sure, Ed.\u0027\n And that\u0027s the end of my friendship with Joe.\n When Andeanna calls, I tell her we have to meet. She suggests Trafalgar Square, one of our favourite spots when we were courting innocently, so I head over at the agreed time. The square is teeming with tourists, even at this late hour. Everyone\u0027s making the most of the clear sky and warm breeze. This could be one of the last sweet nights of the summer, and nobody wants to waste it.\n Andeanna is sitting by a fountain. She kisses my cheek when I sit beside her. She looks more composed than last time. Her face has healed cleanly.\n \u0027You look good,\u0027 I compliment her.\n \u0027I know,\u0027 she laughs. \u0027It\u0027s crazy. I\u0027ve been a mess since we met in the park. But this morning I woke up and felt light, giddy, free. It\u0027s bizarre.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s because you made up your mind and committed yourself to killing him. You know you\u0027re in this to the end. Your choice has been lifted from you, so you feel unburdened.\u0027\n \u0027Hark at Mr Freud,\u0027 she smiles. \u0027How did you get to be so wise?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve seen this kind of reaction before.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m following a trend?\u0027 she shrieks mock-hysterically.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I smirk. \u0027First comes the vow - \"I\u0027ll kill him, no question about it.\" Then confusion - \"I can\u0027t kill him! He\u0027s my husband! But I must! But I can\u0027t!\"\u0027\n \u0027Stop,\u0027 she giggles.\n \u0027Then comes acceptance - \"I\u0027ll kill him. No big deal. Oh, look at the state of those nails. I need a manicure.\"\u0027\n Andeanna glances at her hands and blushes. \u0027Incredible. I\u0027ve got an appointment booked for the morning.\u0027\n \u0027I should write a book about it,\u0027 I say drily. \u0027How to Murder a Loved One.\u0027\n \u0027That should be How to Murder a Not So Loved One.\u0027\n \u0027I stand corrected.\u0027\n It feels wonderful to be here with her, to look into her eyes and find no trace of fear, doubt or hatred. She loves and accepts me, and I know she\u0027ll never again ask about my past or how I could have done such awful things. We\u0027ve reached an understanding.\n \u0027I hate the thought of killing Mikis,\u0027 she says, her smile fading. \u0027For all his faults, he always provided for me, and he\u0027s Greygo\u0027s father.\u0027\n \u0027I know.\u0027\n \u0027But three into two won\u0027t go,\u0027 she sighs. \u0027We can\u0027t carry on as we have been. He\u0027d find out eventually and kill us. I can\u0027t get a divorce. He\u0027d chase me if I ran. We can\u0027t wait for him to die of natural causes - he could live for decades. So it\u0027s this or nothing.\u0027\n \u0027And I can\u0027t settle for nothing.\u0027\n \u0027Me neither,\u0027 she agrees, taking my hand. \u0027But it has to be swift, as painless as possible. I don\u0027t want you choking him like you choked poor Axel.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027ll be clean. A bullet through the brain.\u0027\n She nods grimly. \u0027You can get a gun?\u0027\n \u0027I already have one - Nelke\u0027s.\u0027\n Her eyes narrow. \u0027Won\u0027t they be able to trace that to him from powder or bullet grooves or something like that?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re meant to. I want them thinking that Nelke set up the Turk.\u0027\n \u0027Axel? Why would he?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t have a motive, but I don\u0027t think we need one. Mikis suspects Axel of betraying him, right?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but Mikis always suspects the worst of people.\u0027\n \u0027So this time he was right,\u0027 I snort. \u0027It\u0027s the perfect set-up. Mikis has already cast Axel Nelke as a traitor. Bond and the others will be looking for someone to hang. If we throw them the hook of Nelke, they\u0027ll snap at it gratefully, so long as we don\u0027t make it look too much like a frame.\u0027\n \u0027So you\u0027ll kill Mikis with Axel\u0027s gun, then leave it by the body?\u0027\n \u0027That won\u0027t work. If Axel was smart enough to slip back into London unseen and carry out a hit, he\u0027d be smart enough not to incriminate himself. If we\u0027d acted swiftly, while we still had his body, we could have arranged a car crash and accounted for him that way - the gun would have been found in the wreckage and Bond would have put two and two together. Since it\u0027s too late for that, we have to give them someone else.\u0027\n A couple of Japanese tourists sit down close to us. I remain seated a while, so it won\u0027t look like we\u0027ve been frightened away, then rise and take Andeanna on a stroll around the square, speaking softly out of the side of my mouth. \u0027Assume Nelke\u0027s alive and wants to kill the Turk. He can\u0027t do it by himself while all the Turk\u0027s men are scouring London for him. So how does he go about it?\u0027\n \u0027He gets someone else to do it,\u0027 Andeanna answers promptly.\n \u0027Right. But he can\u0027t risk hiring a thug who\u0027ll make a meal of the job. He needs a professional. Also, since Mikis is well known and his death is going to create merry hell, it has to be someone who won\u0027t be put off by the measure of the assignment. Your average assassin, if there is such a thing, won\u0027t go after the likes of Mikis Menderes unless his employer is even more powerful. If we could pin this on one of the Turk\u0027s rivals, it would be plain sailing. But we only have Nelke, so he\u0027ll have to be the one who hires the assassin.\u0027\n \u0027Could Axel afford that?\u0027 Andeanna asks.\n \u0027He could if he\u0027d been skimming from the Turk,\u0027 I chuckle darkly. \u0027And you can bet Gardiner will draw those sorts of conclusions by himself, without hard evidence. But we need more than financial incentive. We need someone with another reason for accepting this particular hit.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027\n \u0027No professional would accept money from a guy as insignificant as Axel Nelke to take out someone as well connected as the Turk, unless it was personal.\u0027 We stop by one of the lions at the base of Nelson\u0027s column and I murmur, \u0027Does the name Sebastian Dash mean anything to you?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s an assassin. He\u0027s worked for the Turk in the past. Last time, something went wrong and the Turk refused to pay. They parted on bad terms.\u0027\n \u0027So we pay Dash to kill Mikis, then pretend to Bond that Axel put him up to it?\u0027\n \u0027No. Dash wouldn\u0027t accept the hit. He doesn\u0027t like the Turk, but he\u0027s not dumb enough to let that cloud his judgement.\u0027\n \u0027Then what good is he to us?\u0027\n \u0027We don\u0027t need to directly involve Dash. We only need to point the finger of blame at him. When the Turk turns up dead and Dash\u0027s signature is found, Bond Gardiner and the others will assume the worst.\u0027\n Andeanna looks blank. \u0027Signature?\u0027\n \u0027When Dash kills, he usually unties the lace on the victim\u0027s left shoe. If we can get him to London, so that he can be seen by people who\u0027ll recognize him, then connect him to Nelke\u0027s gun, I can kill the Turk and fake Dash\u0027s signature.\u0027\n She isn\u0027t convinced. \u0027What if Bond tracks down Dash and learns that he didn\u0027t do it?\u0027\n \u0027How? By asking politely?\u0027\n \u0027Bond could torture him.\u0027\n I shake my head. \u0027You don\u0027t fuck around with men like Sebastian Dash. If Gardiner catches up with Dash, he\u0027ll execute from a distance, not risk taking him alive. Not that I expect him to get that chance - when Dash learns that he\u0027s been framed, he\u0027ll go to ground.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t think he\u0027ll try to find out who set him up?\u0027\n \u0027How will he trace us? All roads will lead to Axel Nelke, and nobody\u0027s ever going to find him.\u0027\n \u0027And Axel\u0027s gun? How will we pin that on Dash?\u0027\n \u0027They might be able to identify the gun from the bullet. After the hit, I\u0027ll head out to Heathrow, where Nelke\u0027s car is parked, slide the gun under the front seat and leave it there. If they can ID the bullet, I\u0027ll retrieve the gun and dispose of it. If they can\u0027t link the bullet to the gun, I\u0027ll break into Nelke\u0027s car. A couple of weeks after the murder, I\u0027ll return to the car park with a crowbar, smash in the side window and - \u0027\n \u0027How likely is that?\u0027 she interrupts. \u0027Bond will know something\u0027s wrong if the car with the gun in it just happens to be broken into.\u0027\n \u0027Hear me out. Nelke obviously liked music, because there was a top-of-the-range CD player in the car. I\u0027ll rip that out and break into other cars as well. There\u0027s CCTV in the car park, so I\u0027ll have to get in and out in a hurry. The police probably won\u0027t find the gun, since they won\u0027t be looking for it. But they will trace the car back to Nelke and try to contact him, to inform him about the robbery. One of Gardiner\u0027s men will take a message, retrieve the car, find the gun, and there you have it.\u0027\n She ponders the plan. \u0027Why would the gun be in Axel\u0027s car?\u0027 she asks. \u0027If Dash was the killer, wouldn\u0027t he have got rid of the weapon?\u0027\n \u0027Sometimes your employer slips you a piece, then takes it back after the hit to dispose of. The break-in and plant are too neat, but this wouldn\u0027t be the first time a plan was undone by the meddling of amateurs. Gardiner will buy it.\u0027\n \u0027And if he doesn\u0027t?\u0027 she asks.\n I shrug. \u0027I can\u0027t make guarantees. I could simply kill the Turk and walk away, but if his murder isn\u0027t solved, you\u0027ll always be a suspect. What happens six months or a year from now when we move in together? People will wonder when we met and where I was the night the Turk was killed. But if the hit is considered a closed case, we\u0027re in the clear. If you can think of another way to frame Nelke, great, I\u0027m all ears.\u0027\n \u0027You know I can\u0027t,\u0027 she pouts, then asks, \u0027How will we set up Dash?\u0027\n I smile, pleased by her sharpness. \u0027I haven\u0027t worked that out yet. We have to come up with a pretext. Ideally we\u0027d fake a message from Nelke and supply Dash with a bogus target, but that won\u0027t work.\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\n \u0027Dash wouldn\u0027t accept an assignment without doing his homework. He\u0027d want to know who Nelke was, if he was reliable, how he was going to pay.\u0027\n \u0027So how do we lure him in?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I groan. \u0027Maybe pretend to be one of his other employers. I know people in England who\u0027ve used him in the past. I\u0027ll try to get a sample of their handwriting - Dash insists that correspondence be handwritten - so that I can forge a note asking him to fly in for a job. If I can convince him to come, I\u0027ll put him up in a safe house, then leave another note instructing him to wait, with a promise to slip him a weapon later.\u0027\n Andeanna turns away from me and strolls ahead. I follow patiently, waiting for her to work through whatever\u0027s troubling her. Finally she looks back. \u0027If Mikis asked Dash to do a job for him, would he?\u0027\n \u0027Mikis wouldn\u0027t hire Sebastian Dash. I told you they parted inamicably.\u0027\n \u0027But might Mikis want to make things right between them again?\u0027\n I think it over. \u0027Possibly. Business is business, and Dash is one of the best in his profession.\u0027\n \u0027So if Mikis offered him a job,\u0027 she pushes, \u0027would Dash feel compelled to accept?\u0027\n \u0027Maybe. The Turk would take it as an insult if he extended the hand of friendship and Dash blanked him.\u0027\n Andeanna stops. She\u0027s trembling, but with excitement, not fear. \u0027I can fake Mikis\u0027s handwriting. I learnt to copy it years ago. If I wrote to Dash, pretending to be Mikis . . . \u0027\n I stare at her, stunned by the simplicity of her plan.\n \u0027Would it work?\u0027 she asks.\n \u0027It . . . Andeanna . . . I . . . \u0027\n Unable to find the words, I wrap my arms around her and kiss her hotly. A kiss of pure delight. A kiss of promised death.\n We find a quiet cafe. Taking a table at the rear, we order cappuccinos and fall into a mumbled conversation. After a while, I take out my writing pad and pen and we experiment with notes to Dash.\n \u0027We can\u0027t make outright mention of the hit,\u0027 I mutter as I scribble. \u0027Dash demands handwritten letters from his clients, to use against them if they try to shaft him. But they must be ambiguous, so they won\u0027t tip anyone off if they go astray in the post.\u0027\n I finish my first draft and hand it to Andeanna. My wife has been cheating on me. I\u0027m not happy. I want to discuss it with you. I have lodgings set aside for you. If you can spare the time, please move in, make yourself comfortable and wait. I\u0027ll be in touch. Mikis Menderes.\n \u0027We\u0027ll include your address, as well as that of the safe house,\u0027 I tell her.\n \u0027Mikis\u0027s middle name is Theopolous,\u0027 Andeanna says. \u0027He always uses it when signing his name.\u0027\n \u0027OK. That\u0027s an easy adjustment. What about the rest?\u0027\n She reads it through a second time. \u0027We should take out my wife. Mikis refers to me as his woman. And I don\u0027t think he\u0027d say I\u0027d been cheating on him. He\u0027d be more likely to say something like I\u0027d been seen with another man. And . . . \u0027\n We go over it a few more times. Finally Andeanna is satisfied and reads it out softly, mimicking Mikis\u0027s accent. \u0027My woman has been seen on the arm of another man. Not happy. Want to talk with you about it. Lodgings set aside for you. If you\u0027re agreeable, move in and wait. I will be in touch.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re sure he\u0027d be this curt?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027That\u0027s a novel as far as Mikis\u0027s letters go.\u0027\n Smiling, I turn over the sheet of paper and write on the back.\n \u0027What are you doing now?\u0027 Andeanna asks.\n \u0027Adding the name of Dash\u0027s contact, a woman in Switzerland. She\u0027s the person you need to send the letter to.\u0027\n \u0027Me?\u0027 Andeanna reacts with alarm. \u0027I thought you were going to send it.\u0027\n I shake my head. \u0027The letter needs to be written on the Turk\u0027s own stationery and posted locally. It will be safer if you do it.\u0027\n Andeanna looks uncertain, but she nods and takes the note, folding it in half and tucking it away in her purse. \u0027What about fingerprints?\u0027\n \u0027Wear gloves at all stages, before you pick up the paper, before you touch the pen. Make sure it\u0027s a self-sealing envelope, so you don\u0027t have to lick the flap.\u0027\n \u0027When should I send it?\u0027\n \u0027As soon as we sort out a safe house.\u0027\n \u0027How long will it take him to respond?\u0027\n \u0027That depends on where he is and what his schedule\u0027s like. We haven\u0027t stressed a time frame, so he\u0027ll know we aren\u0027t in a rush, but he won\u0027t want to keep the Turk waiting too long. I\u0027d guess a few weeks. If it goes beyond that, I\u0027ll head out to Heathrow and move the car, so the security guards don\u0027t take an interest in it.\u0027\n \u0027If Dash doesn\u0027t accept? How will . . . \u0027 She stops, eyes widening. \u0027What if he calls Mikis?\u0027\n \u0027He won\u0027t. The note says to move in and wait. It doesn\u0027t say anything about direct contact. Where instructions aren\u0027t provided, Dash won\u0027t substitute his own.\u0027\n She doesn\u0027t look convinced. \u0027What about the safe house?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll visit estate agents tomorrow, tell them my name\u0027s Axel Nelke, that I need somewhere secluded for the next few months. I\u0027ll pay with cash.\u0027\n \u0027What about proof of identity? Credit checks? References?\u0027\n \u0027Cash buys discretion. Not everywhere, but you can always find people who are prepared to waive the rules if the price is right. I\u0027ll avoid the chains, hit independent agents, spin them some story about being in the middle of a messy divorce and not wanting to leave a paper trail. As long as I\u0027m paying up front, it shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\u0027\n \u0027Can you afford that?\u0027 Andeanna asks.\n \u0027Haven\u0027t you heard? I\u0027m hooking up with a wealthy widow-in-the-making.\u0027\n Andeanna waves a finger under my nose. \u0027That isn\u0027t funny. Besides, like I told you, everything goes to Greygo.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s OK,\u0027 I grin. \u0027We can kill Greygo too.\u0027 Her expression flattens. \u0027I\u0027m joking. You know I don\u0027t care about money. We\u0027ll get by.\u0027\n She takes my hand and squeezes. \u0027I\u0027m scared, Ed.\u0027\n \u0027You should be. This is a scary business. But it will all work out in the end.\u0027 I lean forward to kiss her, and whisper, \u0027Trust me.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-12.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: \n Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
