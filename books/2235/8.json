{"id":108118,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"We meet in a beer garden, find a table and sit down with two glasses of their finest brew. Andeanna is dressed in green, another of her high-collar, high-hem numbers. She sips from her glass. Her fingers are damp when she lets go. She runs them over the back of her neck and smiles. \u0027Hot,\u0027 she says. \u0027Yes.\u0027 I smile self-consciously and murmur, \u0027I\u0027ve sold my book.\u0027 She frowns. \u0027What book?\u0027 \u0027Spirit of the Fire. My agent - \u0027 \u0027Ed!\u0027 she squeals, and lunges across the table to hug me. \u0027That\u0027s wonderful! Who bought it? How much did you make? Have you started writing it? How can they buy a book that isn\u0027t written? What if you change your mind or get stuck?\u0027 I take her questions one at a time, loosening up while I answer, and by the end of the explanations we\u0027re almost back to where we were before Andeanna dropped her bombshell. She touches my hands with her fingertips when she wants to make a point, stroking my knuckles unconsciously. For a while we chat about work, my trip to Devon, what she\u0027s been up to. I\u0027d like to go on like this for ever but I can\u0027t. The elephant in the room has to be addressed. \u0027We need to talk about Mikis Menderes.\u0027 Andeanna sighs but doesn\u0027t drop her gaze. \u0027I know.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve been thinking about him constantly since we had our little disagreement.\u0027 She smiles at the understatement. \u0027It wasn\u0027t the lie that maddened me so much. It\u0027s what could have happened if he\u0027d found out. I don\u0027t know Menderes - \u0027 \u0027Call him the Turk,\u0027 she interrupts. \u0027Everyone else does.\u0027 \u0027 - but I know his reputation. He wouldn\u0027t have shrugged and made light of it if Bond Gardiner had seen us together, would he?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 she says. \u0027He\u0027d have torn into me, then gone after you.\u0027 \u0027And if he caught up with me?\u0027 She shrugs. \u0027A beating. Maybe worse. Mikis is a dangerous man.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s what infuriated me. It looked to me like you were playing games, toying with me, setting me up for - \u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 she begs. \u0027Don\u0027t think that. Please, Ed.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t,\u0027 I sigh. Then, leaning across the table, \u0027I love you, Andeanna.\u0027 Her eyes widen. \u0027No,\u0027 she whispers. \u0027I love you,\u0027 I repeat, louder this time. A couple at a nearby table glance at us and smile. \u0027I love you - \u0027 I lower my voice - \u0027and I don\u0027t care who you\u0027re married to. I\u0027ll take my chances with the Turk if you love me too.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not that simple,\u0027 she says miserably. \u0027You\u0027re a writer. Before that you sold computers. You can\u0027t defend yourself against Mikis or Bond.\u0027 \u0027I can deal with the Turk,\u0027 I grunt. \u0027How?\u0027 she asks sceptically. \u0027I\u0027m a black belt in karate,\u0027 I joke. She raises an eyebrow, but I don\u0027t blink. Finally she grimaces. \u0027Where does this leave us, Ed?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s down to you. Do you love me?\u0027 On the wings of a long, trembling breath, she says, \u0027Yes.\u0027 I take her hands and squeeze. \u0027Tell me about your marriage.\u0027 Her story unfolds over the course of the night. She keeps jumping between the present and the past, so I have to concentrate to piece it together. She was young when she married Mikis Menderes. It was a shotgun wedding - she was pregnant with their son, Gregory, now a grown man in his twenties. (That caught me off guard. It means she\u0027s quite a lot older than I originally guessed. But that\u0027s OK, I like older women.) It was an unhappy union from the start. She knew going in that it would be. Mikis was unpleasant even when they were dating. She endured the mild abuse in the beginning because he was older than her, he was a gangster, it was a thrill to be with him. Later, when he learnt of the pregnancy, she had no choice. He insisted she keep the baby and marry him. If she\u0027d had her parents to turn to, she might have defied him, but they\u0027d disowned her when she hooked up with Menderes, and she didn\u0027t dare approach them. \u0027He wouldn\u0027t let me wear white at the wedding,\u0027 she says, her eyes a pair of dark, bitter mirrors. \u0027I wanted to, even though I was five months pregnant, but he said white was for virgins, not whores. He called me a whore even though he was marrying me. He made me dress in red. It was a beautiful gown, but . . . \u0027 Mikis has no respect for her, no love, no compassion. She\u0027s his wife, the mother of his only son, so she wants for nothing - the finest clothes and jewellery are hers for the asking. But no kind words, no fond caresses, no gentle gestures. He\u0027s proud of her - he takes her with him when he wants to impress, shows her off like a prize dog - but jealous too. He regularly accuses her of flirting with men and beats her for it. He hits her for a variety of reasons - speaking back, not making a fuss of him, sometimes just for looking at him askance - but more often than not because he believes she\u0027s considering infidelity. \u0027He\u0027s obsessed with the idea,\u0027 she hisses. \u0027He makes me mingle when he takes me to parties, forces me to talk with his associates or friends, to make him look good, so they go away saying what a charming wife old Mikis has. But then he attacks me for coming on to them. He accuses me of flaunting myself.\u0027 She sniffs. \u0027I\u0027ve learnt not to argue. I stand and take it. It\u0027s easier that way. Once, I threw his accusations back in his face, said I\u0027d fucked one of the guys I\u0027d been talking with. I thought that might shut him up. \u0027I spent three weeks in hospital recovering. He\u0027s normally careful when he hits me, focuses on my shoulders, arms, breasts.\u0027 She touches the high collar of her dress. \u0027It\u0027s why I cover up so much, to hide the bruises. But that time he lost control and almost killed me. Since then I\u0027ve taken my punishment without complaint.\u0027 I would ask why she\u0027s stuck by him instead of fleeing, except I already know the answer - you don\u0027t run from men like Mikis Menderes. He\u0027d hunt her, find her, kill her. Besides, he\u0027s been her whole life since they married. I\u0027m sure she has no friends or allies of her own. Who could she turn to for help? \u0027Does he ever go after the men he accuses you of flirting with?\u0027 I ask. \u0027No,\u0027 she snorts. \u0027He knows I\u0027ve never betrayed him. He just likes to act as if I have. He\u0027s betrayed me plenty, though, and he doesn\u0027t bother to hide it. He\u0027s had so many women. He taunts me with them when he\u0027s bored, phones them when he knows I\u0027m listening, comes home with their lipstick all over him, moans their names while he\u0027s fucking me, tells me how much better they are.\u0027 \u0027Why doesn\u0027t he divorce you and marry one of his other women?\u0027 I snarl. \u0027He doesn\u0027t believe in divorce. I don\u0027t think he\u0027d marry again, even if I died. He\u0027s in love with the idea of family.\u0027 \u0027What does your son think? Does he stand by and - \u0027 \u0027Greygo?\u0027 she interrupts with a smile. \u0027That\u0027s what we call him. Mikis insisted on naming him Gregory, but he has trouble pronouncing it.\u0027 She shakes her head. \u0027He doesn\u0027t know. Mikis never hits me in front of Greygo, and has threatened terrible things if I turn informer. He won\u0027t have his son thinking ill of him.\u0027 She says that the beatings aren\u0027t the worst. The worst is when he makes love to her. Menderes believes that it\u0027s a wife\u0027s duty to satisfy her husband\u0027s every need. Even though he spends most of his nights with other women - hence her nocturnal freedom - he works in three or four \u0027shafting sessions\u0027 a month with his wife. He\u0027s horrible in bed and has grown more so with the passing years. \u0027In the early days our lovemaking was a comfort. He could be kind towards me. There were nights when he\u0027d make slow, gentle love, then lie beside me and talk softly. I used to tell myself that things were taking a turn for the better. Now I haven\u0027t even got that false hope. He comes into my room and - \u0027 \u0027Please,\u0027 I stop her. \u0027I don\u0027t want to know. Imagining\u0027s awful enough. If I have to listen to a blow-by-blow account . . . \u0027 \u0027Of course.\u0027 She looks away. \u0027I don\u0027t want to bother you with my problems. I\u0027m sorry. I shouldn\u0027t be waffling on like this.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s not what I meant.\u0027 I take her chin gently between my fingers and turn her face back towards me. \u0027I want to listen. I want you to be open with me. I just can\u0027t stomach a graphic description. I\u0027m not sure I could control myself.\u0027 She sneers automatically. \u0027What could you do about it, Ed? Track down Mikis and whack him over the head with your laptop?\u0027 \u0027Maybe,\u0027 I deadpan. \u0027Or I could throw copies of my books at him until he begs for mercy.\u0027 We share a smile. \u0027This is crazy,\u0027 she notes. \u0027There\u0027s nothing funny about Mikis or what he does to me.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 I chortle, \u0027but I can\u0027t stop grinning.\u0027 \u0027Me neither. Let\u0027s order more beer. I feel like getting tipsy.\u0027 The mood lightens after that, and even though Andeanna carries on describing her trials, the sting has gone from her tone and she talks blithely, as if about somebody else. She finds the humour in her situation. Mikis accused her of coming on to one of his uncles once, an elderly, incontinent, wheelchair-bound man. When she took driving lessons, he didn\u0027t trust her instructor, so he made one of his men accompany her and sit in the back seat, even during the test. And then, of course, he accused her of seducing her minder. I think, if dawn could be put off for a week, we\u0027d still be here talking about the Turk and his abuse of her. But the beer garden closes at midnight, and although we intend finding somewhere else to cuddle up, our legs turn to jelly when we stand and realize how much we\u0027ve drunk. \u0027I can\u0027t handle a nightclub,\u0027 Andeanna says. Her face and neck are flushed from the beer. Knowing the truth about her, I think she looks more beautiful than ever. It\u0027s incredible, having endured what she\u0027s had to, that she\u0027s held on to her looks and spirit. Most women would have crumpled years ago in her place. \u0027We could get a cab and drive around for a while,\u0027 I suggest. \u0027Would you mind if we left things as they are?\u0027 she asks. \u0027I\u0027d rather head home and get my head down. It\u0027s been a long night.\u0027 \u0027No problem. I feel the same way.\u0027 Our smiles fade as we stare at one another. \u0027What now, Mr Sieveking?\u0027 Andeanna asks. \u0027We catch some shut-eye.\u0027 \u0027I mean tomorrow and the next day and - \u0027 \u0027I know what you mean.\u0027 Leaning forward, I kiss her. \u0027I won\u0027t run away,\u0027 I whisper when we break. \u0027What about Mikis?\u0027 \u0027He doesn\u0027t matter. If you loved him, that would be different. But I won\u0027t let a monster come between us.\u0027 \u0027If he finds out . . . \u0027 She leaves the unspoken threat hanging in the air. \u0027Are you worried about what he might do?\u0027 I ask, and she nods silently. \u0027Will your fear drive us apart?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t want it to, but . . . \u0027 I kiss her again. \u0027A simple yes or no. Do you want to stop seeing me?\u0027 A long pause, then the softest of answers. \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027So we carry on, whatever the risks, and take it one day - one night - at a time. To hell with Mikis Menderes.\u0027 \u0027If you\u0027re sure . . . \u0027 \u0027I am.\u0027 \u0027Then so am I,\u0027 she says with a kiss, and our destiny is sealed. Now that we\u0027ve declared our love and reconciled ourselves to an uncertain future, I expect the physical side of our relationship to explode into passionate life. I\u0027m not sure how to react when a week passes and it doesn\u0027t. I understand Andeanna\u0027s initial sexual hesitancy, but now there should be nothing to come between us. I know about the Turk. We\u0027ve made a commitment to each other. So what\u0027s holding her back? Our petting has increased and her fingers roam more freely, but whenever I make heavy advances, she tacitly diverts me. When I ask about it, she shrugs and says she wants to take things slowly. \u0027This is a big step,\u0027 she mutters, nuzzling my neck. \u0027I\u0027ve become conditioned to the demands of sex. I\u0027m used to surrendering my body, not giving it freely. I want it to be special between us, not like it is with Mikis. Will you be patient?\u0027 I say that of course I will, but it\u0027s frustrating. I can feel the desire in her, the sexual longing. She wants me as much as I want her. So again I wonder - what\u0027s holding her back? I try not to let my personal life interfere with Spirit of the Fire, which is chugging along nicely. I\u0027ve been devoting a lot of time to the science side of the book and I\u0027ve got a good idea of how to blend it with the horror elements. Soon I\u0027ll be ready to start. Jonathan gets in touch to say he\u0027s in the process of finalizing the contract, but it might still take a few weeks. He\u0027s not going to rush them - he\u0027ll use the time to scout around for an American publisher. He asks if I\u0027m free to return to the States if needed. I say I\u0027ll let him know, then discuss it with Andeanna. I mention the possibility of her accompanying me, but she vetoes the idea. There\u0027s no way the Turk would let her travel to America without him. \u0027But go if you must,\u0027 she urges. \u0027I don\u0027t want to hold you here. If your work takes you away, I won\u0027t interfere.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t say things like that,\u0027 I scowl. \u0027You know I won\u0027t leave you.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 she smiles. \u0027But I don\u0027t want you thinking that you can\u0027t. It won\u0027t crush me if you call it quits. I\u0027ll survive. I\u0027m quite accomplished at surviving.\u0027 Though Andeanna rules out a trip to the States, Joe would love to go. I\u0027ve told Jonathan about my partner, and while he isn\u0027t keen on the idea of a collaborator, he\u0027s accepted my decision to involve Joe and is preparing a contract for him. I told Joe he shouldn\u0027t sign if he doesn\u0027t want to, and I urged him to seek legal advice, but I don\u0027t think he paid any attention. He\u0027s so excited at the thought of being involved, he\u0027d sign away all rights if a deal to that effect was placed before him. I\u0027m paging through a monstrously thick book about unusual deaths when my phone rings. It\u0027s Andeanna. \u0027Guess what?\u0027 \u0027Surprise me.\u0027 \u0027Mikis has been called away on business. He\u0027ll be gone for three days. I have the house to myself.\u0027 I lay the book aside. \u0027What about bodyguards? I thought he didn\u0027t leave you alone at home.\u0027 \u0027He doesn\u0027t. A guy called Axel Nelke is guarding me. But things aren\u0027t so hot between Axel and his wife. He could do with some extra time at home with her. I told him I wouldn\u0027t tell Mikis if he didn\u0027t.\u0027 She lowers her voice and does a pretty good Mae West impression. \u0027So why don\u0027t cha come up and see me some time?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 I reply solemnly. \u0027Why not?\u0027 she asks, perturbed. \u0027I don\u0027t have your address.\u0027 \u0027Funny guy,\u0027 she drawls, and tells me where she lives, describing the quickest route from my hotel. I jot down directions, grab my keys and hurry downstairs, not bothering to change my clothes. The Menderes mansion lies tucked off the main road in the northern suburbs of London, hidden behind a scattering of trees. The electrified gate opens as I approach and closes smoothly behind me. It\u0027s a short drive to the house, where Andeanna waits on the steps of the front porch. Rolling down the window, I ask where I should park. \u0027Here is fine,\u0027 she says, so I cut the engine and step out. She glides down the steps to greet me, wraps her arms around me and buries me in a long, eager kiss. It\u0027s a kiss I\u0027m in no hurry to break, but then I catch a glimpse of a security camera overhead. \u0027You have CCTV?\u0027 I snap. \u0027Of course,\u0027 she says. I stare at the camera, feeling my stomach drop. \u0027But you don\u0027t have to worry about it,\u0027 she smirks. \u0027How come?\u0027 I frown. \u0027I sneaked in and switched off the record function.\u0027 \u0027Won\u0027t somebody notice that when they check?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 she smiles. \u0027I\u0027ll turn it back on when you leave. I do this every time I slip in and out. It\u0027s second nature now.\u0027 I grunt uneasily. I trust her, but the camera sets me on edge all the same and I start thinking about other things that could go wrong. \u0027What about the staff?\u0027 I ask. \u0027All gone,\u0027 she says, tugging me up the steps. \u0027Mikis can\u0027t tolerate servants. He employs the slimmest of crews and gets them in and out as swiftly as possible. The maids, cleaners and gardeners come in the morning and are gone by early afternoon.\u0027 \u0027Who does the cooking?\u0027 I ask. \u0027Me. Except when we have guests. Then Mikis hires caterers. But when it\u0027s just us, he keeps the help at arm\u0027s length. That\u0027s one of the reasons I feel so lonely. I have to stay in all day with bodyguards who never talk with me. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d survive if I wasn\u0027t able to slip out at night and mix with real people.\u0027 \u0027Does the Turk know about your nightly escapades?\u0027 She shakes her head. \u0027He doesn\u0027t think I could be so bold. He believes I\u0027m locked away all the time.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t your guards tell him?\u0027 \u0027I retire early every night - I always have done, so there\u0027s no call for them to be suspicious - then disable the CCTV and sneak out.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll be caught eventually,\u0027 I warn her. She laughs. \u0027Not as long as there\u0027s sport on the telly for them to watch.\u0027 Taking my hand, Andeanna leads the way inside. She\u0027s nervous, and so am I. Regardless of her guarantees, I can\u0027t shake the thought from my head that this is the Turk\u0027s stronghold. I expect him to burst in on us at any moment. Andeanna takes me on a tour of the house. I feel edgy, and it\u0027s not just the feeling you get when you enter somebody\u0027s home without the owner\u0027s permission. There\u0027s a chill in the air. The rooms are larger than normal. Sounds echo through them. And there\u0027s a . . . I don\u0027t know if I can describe it . . . a solemnity to the atmosphere. This feels like a house of mourning. Even my ghosts look sombre. Each room is a hall of garish wonders. Crystal chandeliers, mounted heads of lions and deer, banisters studded with jewels, paintings by artists whose names are familiar even to me, leopard-skin rugs adorning the hearths, lots of marble and gold leaf. It\u0027s been a long time since I visited such a monument to lavish, vulgar taste. \u0027You don\u0027t like it,\u0027 Andeanna notes. \u0027No, it\u0027s lovely, I . . . \u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t lie,\u0027 she laughs. \u0027I hate the place too. It\u0027s Mikis\u0027s dream home, not mine. He took control of the plans. He even designed my bedroom and makes me keep it the way he wants.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a room I\u0027d like to see,\u0027 I mumble artlessly. Andeanna looks at me without saying a word, then turns on her heel and marches upstairs. I follow silently, eyes glued to her shapely calves as she climbs the stairs ahead of me. At the top she takes a left and escorts me to a room at the end of the corridor. Another huge chamber, soft blue wallpaper, billowing curtains, antique dressing table, walk-in wardrobe and an en suite bathroom. A four-poster bed occupies a full quarter of the floor. Several framed wedding photos of Andeanna and Mikis adorn the walls. She\u0027s hardly aged at all. While Andeanna stands just within the doorway, I stroll to the dressing table and study the few personal artefacts scattered across it - brushes, a compact, hair pins. A photo album rests next to a powder box. I pick it up and flick through. Snapshots of Andeanna and her son. He\u0027s young in most of them, but there\u0027s a recent shot of him near the back. He\u0027s shaved his hair off and the glow of his scalp creates a halo-like impression. \u0027Gregory?\u0027 I ask. \u0027Greygo. Yes.\u0027 She comes over and stares at the smiling young man. \u0027Handsome,\u0027 I note. \u0027He thinks so,\u0027 she laughs, \u0027but that bald head\u0027s awful! He\u0027s an actor. Very talented, and that\u0027s not just his mother talking, the critics have often said so too.\u0027 \u0027Have I seen him in anything?\u0027 \u0027I doubt it. He prefers the stage to movies or the telly, and he likes to take small, interesting character roles. That\u0027s why he shaved his head - he wears a lot of wigs, darting from one play to another.\u0027 My eyes flick from the photo to Andeanna. \u0027He favours you.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 she says proudly. \u0027He inherited my finer characteristics and hardly any of Mikis\u0027s lesser features. It drove Mikis mad. He hated the fact that his son looked more like me than him. I used to lie and tell him that Greygo has his eyes and mouth. Over the years he\u0027s come to believe that. But it isn\u0027t true. He\u0027s mine.\u0027 Her fingers brush across her son\u0027s face, then she takes the album from me and closes it. \u0027Mikis insisted on a blood test. When Greygo didn\u0027t look like him, he dragged us to our doctor to make sure he was the father. If there\u0027d been even a shadow of a doubt, we would have wound up at the bottom of the Thames. Mikis isn\u0027t the sort who\u0027d bring up another man\u0027s child, or allow him to live.\u0027 \u0027Where is Greygo?\u0027 I ask. \u0027On tour with a rep company. He spends a lot of time on the road. I think he finds it easier that way.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 She sighs. \u0027Greygo loves his father, and it\u0027s reciprocal, but he knows he\u0027s a disappointment. Mikis wanted his son to follow in his footsteps, but Greygo fell in love with acting when he was a child. Mikis tried to dissuade him, but Greygo was adamant. When Mikis refused to support him, he won a scholarship to RADA. Any other parent would have been bursting with pride - do you know how hard it is to get into RADA? - but Mikis went into depression. I think he was worried because so many actors are gay - at least that\u0027s the myth. He was afraid Greygo might go pink. To a man like Mikis, there\u0027s nothing worse than a gay son.\u0027 She\u0027s babbling because she\u0027s nervous. I gently bring her back to the point I was trying to make. \u0027So we\u0027re alone,\u0027 I remark. She nods tensely. \u0027Yes.\u0027 Then, trembling, she offers her lips. Our kiss is brief. When we separate, she looks troubled. \u0027I know you\u0027ve been patient, and I know how hard it\u0027s been. I don\u0027t want to keep you hanging in suspense, but I . . . \u0027 \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 I tell her. \u0027There are things I haven\u0027t told you, things . . . \u0027 I silence her with a kiss, but she\u0027s determined to say her piece. \u0027Mikis forces me to submit to gynaecological tests. My doctor is one of his oldest friends. She answers directly to him.\u0027 I stare at her, understanding at last why she\u0027s been keeping me at arm\u0027s length. \u0027He springs her on me without warning. Sometimes months pass between examinations. Then she\u0027ll test me three times in a week.\u0027 Andeanna looks up, tears forming. \u0027She\u0027s a godawful bitch and thorough as the devil. No matter what precautions we took, I couldn\u0027t be sure that she wouldn\u0027t find a trace of you. That\u0027s why . . . \u0027 \u0027Oh God,\u0027 I groan, embracing her. \u0027You should have told me. If I\u0027d known . . . Christ, I wouldn\u0027t . . . I\u0027d never have . . . \u0027 \u0027I want to give myself to you,\u0027 she cries. \u0027I want to be with you properly, but if she found out and told Mikis . . . \u0027 \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 I whisper, kissing her forehead. \u0027I can wait.\u0027 She sniffs. \u0027There\u0027s no wait. I love you, but I won\u0027t risk my life for you. If we could run away - if I thought he couldn\u0027t find us - I\u0027d light out in an instant. I\u0027d give it all up, this house, the lifestyle, everything. Even Greygo. I love you that much. But he\u0027d find us. He\u0027d kill us.\u0027 \u0027Not if we killed him first.\u0027 It\u0027s barely a whisper. She giggles. \u0027Right. With copies of Soul Vultures.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m serious. With a gun. A knife. Mikis Menderes is human. He can be killed. I could - \u0027 \u0027Stop,\u0027 she smiles. \u0027It\u0027s cute - no, not cute, volunteering to kill a man can\u0027t be cute - but you\u0027re being silly. You\u0027re a writer, not a thug. You couldn\u0027t kill anyone and I don\u0027t expect you to, so quit with the macho crap. It doesn\u0027t become you.\u0027 \u0027And if it wasn\u0027t crap? If I could really kill him?\u0027 She pinches the love handles I\u0027ve developed over the last few years. \u0027Stop.\u0027 \u0027OK.\u0027 I force a smile. \u0027I won\u0027t kill your husband.\u0027 She laughs, then grows serious and steps back. \u0027Now that you know. Now that you realize how impossible it is. Do you want to go on seeing me?\u0027 She stares at the floor. \u0027I\u0027ll understand if you don\u0027t. Our only hope is if Mikis drops dead of a heart attack or if one of his rivals eliminates him. I don\u0027t think that will happen. Although he\u0027s older than either of us, he\u0027s fit as a fiddle, and he leads a charmed life. He may live to be a hundred.\u0027 \u0027Andeanna.\u0027 She looks up, hopeful, fearful. \u0027I love you. Nothing can change that. If I can\u0027t have it all, I\u0027ll take whatever I can.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t mind?\u0027 She sounds doubtful. \u0027Of course I mind! Being with you and not having you tears me to pieces. But it\u0027s better than not being with you at all. Just to see you, to talk with you, to hold and kiss you . . . \u0027 I stop when I feel a lump in my throat. I haven\u0027t cried (except when drunk and pitiful) since I was a kid, and I don\u0027t want to embarrass myself by starting now. \u0027Oh, Ed,\u0027 she sobs, and throws herself on me. I hold her and whisper and tell her everything\u0027s fine, the sex doesn\u0027t matter, simply having her with me like this is enough. Eventually Andeanna pushes herself away, grabs tissues from the table and wipes around her eyes, then sits and applies make-up. I watch, amused. She notices my grin in the mirror and lowers her head. \u0027Force of habit,\u0027 she mutters, then stands and clears her throat. \u0027There are things we can do, if we\u0027re careful.\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 She blushes and whispers something beneath her breath. \u0027I can\u0027t hear you,\u0027 I tell her. She looks at me straight, defiant this time, and with a twinkle in her eye. \u0027I could give you a handjob.\u0027 I laugh out loud at the unexpected proposal. \u0027What?\u0027 Andeanna snaps, pretending to be offended. \u0027I\u0027ll have you know I have very skilled hands.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure you do,\u0027 I smirk. She wriggles her fingers. \u0027Kings would offer fortunes for a few quick jerks from me.\u0027 I explode in a fit of giggles, and I can\u0027t recall the last time that ever happened to me. \u0027Stop!\u0027 I gasp, clutching my sides. \u0027Well, I\u0027m glad I can make you laugh, even if I can\u0027t satisfy your carnal desires,\u0027 Andeanna sniffs, then flexes her fingers at me again. As I chuckle, she gets up, grabs hold of me and pulls me down on to the bed. We wrestle with each other, playfully. She tickles me. I kiss her and start to slide a hand up between her legs, drawing a delighted squeal. I stop before she pushes me away, respecting the boundaries the Turk has forced on her. After a while she falls still and rests her head on my shoulder. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she murmurs. \u0027I want you more than anything else in the world. I want to give myself to you. Not being able to . . . \u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t let it get you down,\u0027 I tell her, kissing the top of her head, running my hands through her hair, relishing even this much contact, content to have to stop here. \u0027Our time will come. Things will work out.\u0027 \u0027You really think so?\u0027 she asks sceptically. \u0027Sure,\u0027 I sigh. \u0027It happens in fairy tales all the time, and you\u0027re as beautiful as any fairy-tale princess, so . . . \u0027 \u0027Bullshitter,\u0027 she says, pinching me lovingly. Then we hold each other tight, smiling, kissing, letting our warm breath mingle. If I was to be truthful with her, I\u0027d have to admit that I don\u0027t know if I can settle for a chaste relationship in the long term. But for the time being, it doesn\u0027t matter. She has me and I have her. That\u0027s enough. For now.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-8.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
