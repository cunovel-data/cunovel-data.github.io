{"id":108120,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"PART THREE Chapter Nine I find Axel Nelke\u0027s Skoda less than half a mile past the gate, parked in the shade of a tree. I check both sides of the street for signs of life. Observing none, I pull on an old pair of the Turk\u0027s driving gloves which Andeanna found for me - I don\u0027t want to leave any fingerprints - open the driver\u0027s door, sit in and try to start it up, anticipating problems. The engine kicks into life immediately. I let it turn over for a few seconds, then complete a U-turn and head for the mansion, where Andeanna is waiting with Nelke inside the front door. He\u0027s wrapped in dark sheets and black plastic bags. We dragged him there after I\u0027d taken off his trousers and cleaned him up, so that his death stench wouldn\u0027t foul up the air of the car. I leave the engine running - I don\u0027t want to risk not being able to restart it - and duck inside. Andeanna is pale-faced. We haven\u0027t said much since I told her of my true past. I will explain everything, but not while there\u0027s work to be done. It\u0027s better to operate in silence and save the biography for later. \u0027Where will you take him?\u0027 Andeanna asks. \u0027I haven\u0027t decided. Any suggestions?\u0027 I\u0027m not being sarcastic. She shakes her head hopelessly. \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 I flash her a confident smile, trying to put her at ease. \u0027Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll sort it out.\u0027 She nods, but there\u0027s no warmth or thanks in the gesture, merely a cool acknowledgement that she trusts me to handle things. \u0027Can you drive?\u0027 I ask. She frowns. \u0027Of course. I passed my test years ago.\u0027 \u0027I mean can you drive now? Are your nerves up to it?\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 She looks at the bagged body and gulps. \u0027Why do you need a driver?\u0027 \u0027My car,\u0027 I explain patiently. \u0027Somebody has to drive it back to the Royal Munster. If you can\u0027t, I\u0027ll have to call Joe.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 she says quickly. \u0027I don\u0027t want to involve anyone else. I\u0027ll do it. It won\u0027t be easy, but I\u0027ll manage.\u0027 \u0027The keys are in the ignition. There\u0027s a car park beneath the hotel. Get a cab back here, but get it to drop you nearby, not at the house.\u0027 \u0027What about the keys? How will I return them to you?\u0027 \u0027Leave them under the seat. Don\u0027t lock the door.\u0027 \u0027But someone could steal it.\u0027 A time like this and she\u0027s worried about motor theft! \u0027Let them,\u0027 I snap. \u0027It\u0027s a rental. It doesn\u0027t matter. And don\u0027t forget to wipe the CCTV hard drive when you get back.\u0027 \u0027God, yes. I\u0027d forgotten.\u0027 She glances at the bag again. \u0027Will you come back when you\u0027re finished?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re fucking joking, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 She blinks, stung by my sharp tone, and I sigh. \u0027We won\u0027t be able to see one another for a while. I doubt the Turk will connect his guard\u0027s disappearance with you, but let\u0027s not take any chances. I want you to phone him when you return. Tell him Axel took a call and bailed. Act annoyed. Let the Turk worry about it after that.\u0027 I pick up the body by the shoulders. Andeanna takes the legs. I expect her to struggle with the weight, but she must be stronger than she looks, as she carries it with ease. We heave Nelke\u0027s corpse outside and into the trunk. I\u0027m about to close it when I stop and take out the jack, the bag of tools and the spare tyre, which I lump into the back seat. This way, if I get a puncture and have to stop by the side of the road, I needn\u0027t open the trunk, baring the body bag to the eyes of curious passers-by. I gaze at the mansion, wondering if I\u0027ve forgotten anything. I quickly go over the events of the night. Phone cable in place. Floor cleaned. No garments left behind. Fingerprints wiped clean. I could go back and deal personally with the CCTV, but I\u0027m keen to be out of here ASAP. I\u0027ll leave that to Andeanna, hope she doesn\u0027t forget again or screw it up. \u0027I\u0027ll keep out of London for a few days,\u0027 I tell her. \u0027It\u0027s best I don\u0027t ring while I\u0027m gone. Will you call me on my cell - my mobile - three days from now, if you\u0027re sure it\u0027s safe?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 Hard to tell if she means it. \u0027Andeanna.\u0027 She looks at me, slightly unfocused. \u0027I love you.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll call me when I get back?\u0027 \u0027Sure.\u0027 \u0027I had to kill him. It was for us. If he - \u0027 \u0027Just go, Ed. Do whatever you have to. I don\u0027t want to discuss it. I\u0027ll call you. Maybe not in three days, maybe not for a week, but eventually, when I\u0027ve got my head around what happened tonight.\u0027 I want to kiss her, one last kiss in case things go to hell and I never see her again. But I\u0027m sure she\u0027d pull away from me if I tried. I run through the checklist. Body bagged and trunked. Nelke\u0027s personal effects in a small plastic bag on the passenger seat. His gun tucked into the waist of my trousers - I\u0027ll slide it under the seat and hold on to it until I\u0027ve got rid of the body. Andeanna\u0027s been told what to do. I\u0027m not sure she won\u0027t crack when I leave - she looks composed now, but once she has time to dwell on the last hour, who knows how she\u0027ll react - but I have to trust her. \u0027See you soon,\u0027 I mutter. \u0027Soon,\u0027 she agrees, and turns back into the house. Getting into the car, closing the door, I face the driveway with the calm of a professional, blank the ghoulishly giggling ghosts who have spread across the back seat like revellers on their way to a party, switch on the air-con and go. I\u0027m not familiar with this country\u0027s road network, but I\u0027ve done a lot of driving around London, so I know enough to head north for the nearest freeway (they call them motorways here). On the M25, I circle west and south until I hit the road to a town called Southampton. It\u0027s quiet at this time of the day. If I wasn\u0027t afraid of being stopped, I\u0027d floor the accelerator. But a run-in with the police is the last thing I want, so I keep within the speed limit. I turn off before Southampton, into a gas station to fill up. I don\u0027t want to stop, in case the car dies, but the tank is almost empty. I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027ll do if I can\u0027t restart the engine. I think about my options as I\u0027m filling up. Push it out of the way, hire or steal another car, transfer the body? Just leave the corpse in the car and run, hope my face isn\u0027t captured on CCTV? Thankfully it\u0027s not a bridge I have to cross. The engine kicks in smoothly when I get back in and turn the key - the gods seem to be on my side - and I carry on. I continue in a westerly direction. I came this way when I visited Devon, so it seems as sensible a place as any to bolt for now. I stop off at a services restaurant an hour later. Park the car, leave the body in the trunk, pocket the gloves, go and order a full English breakfast. I find a window with a view of the car and eat in glum silence. Next I explore a newsagent\u0027s beside the restaurant and pick up a map and a booklet on the local area. I spend a long time leafing through both, searching for a quiet village or town on the coast. When I find one that fits the criteria, I head off, leaving the map open on the seat beside me so that I can check directions. (Nelke must have been old-school because he didn\u0027t have satnav. I suppose, given the car\u0027s age, I should be grateful even for the air-con.) I take my time, not wanting to arrive too early. I drive up and down the coast, enjoying the scenery, listening to the radio, forcing myself to slip into tourist mode, so that I don\u0027t stand out and draw attention. I don\u0027t make for the town until eleven. I\u0027m pleased with my choice when I arrive - a sleepy place, yet busy enough for nobody to take any notice of a stranger. It\u0027s littered with B\u0026B signs, but I make for a hotel on the outskirts. The girl at the registration desk pays no interest as I sign in, only smiles mechanically and wishes me a nice stay. Leaving the car parked in the nearby lot, I retire to my bedroom, undress and fall asleep as soon as I\u0027m under the covers. I sleep dreamlessly, until four in the afternoon, when my alarm goes off. After I\u0027m done on the toilet, I study myself in the bathroom mirror, silently, thoughtfully, not liking what I see but glad of it at the same time. I thought I\u0027d left the killing behind, but now I\u0027m back in the middle of bloodshed and it\u0027s like I\u0027ve never been away. Already I can see that ice-cold look I\u0027ve been trying to work out of my repertoire. It\u0027s scary how swiftly the past can catch up with you. The ghosts don\u0027t like my calm expression. They thought I\u0027d be more shaken. They stare at me sullenly, their hopes that I\u0027d suffer a mental breakdown fading away swiftly, exposed as wishful thinking on their part. I cracked before under the pressure and guilt, but this time it\u0027s different. This time I have the love of a good woman to fight for. That helps me hold my shape. I take dinner in my room, then go for a walk. I visit a couple of pubs and fall into conversation with crusty old-timers. I let them bore me with their tales and pretend to be interested. When they ask, I tell them I\u0027m in the computer business, but on holiday, taking things easy, doctor\u0027s orders. I enquire about boats and if it\u0027s possible to rent one and take it out by myself. An old guy called Jock asks if I have experience. I\u0027ve sailed solo before - I\u0027m fine on the sea as long as I\u0027m sober - and it doesn\u0027t take long to convince him that I\u0027m a confident skipper. I tell him I want something easy to handle, between eighteen and twenty-five feet. \u0027Well,\u0027 he drawls, \u0027I know a man who might let you have a wee gem of a boat for a day or two, assuming the price is right.\u0027 Jock takes me to see his friend, Peter, and we spend the tail-end of the evening on the bay, where I prove I can handle the patched-up, weather-beaten boat. A deal is struck over drinks in a pub, and I agree to leave my car keys as collateral before setting sail each day. After another consultation with the map and booklet, I drive to a town half an hour away - in case anyone is tracking my credit cards - and withdraw cash from an ATM. The next morning I head to the quay, buying a bale of rope along the way. I give Peter his money and the keys, then hit the waves. I\u0027d like to take the body out and dump it today, but I want to cast an eye over the terrain first. I check that the boat is equipped with binoculars, then set off up the coastline. I putter along, keeping close to the shore, faking an interest in the countryside. In reality I\u0027m clocking houses, scanning roads, searching for an isolated area, out of view of land, where nobody will see what I\u0027m up to. I discover the ideal place before midday. Cliffs shade the stretch of water, there are no nearby houses, the only road is shielded from the bay by a forest. Happy with my choice, I move on and devote the rest of the day to rest. I drift with the currents and watch fish flitting by, drop anchor in a secluded spot and pop in for a swim, naked as an eel. Later, I moor and enjoy a slap-up lunch in a pub. I get back about six, track down Peter, agree to take the yacht out again tomorrow, and collect my keys. I catch a few hours of sleep at the hotel, then head out late, having asked the clerk about the local nightlife. I drive to the quay, where I park and leave my car. I find a pub, have a couple of pints, return to the car and sit in darkness until I\u0027m sure I\u0027m alone. Getting out, I pop the trunk, extricate the wrapped corpse, toss him over my shoulder and take him to the boat, where I stash him, covered in burlap sacks and the rope I bought yesterday. I don\u0027t like leaving the body on the boat overnight, worried in case Peter pops back for some reason, but this is better than trying to move it in the morning, when people are at large. I\u0027m back at the hotel by two, asleep five minutes later, and again I sleep like an innocent child. Up early. I hurry to the boat. Peter isn\u0027t around, so I leave the keys and cash with one of his friends, then ease out on to the bay and retrace yesterday\u0027s route. I pull in to load up with stones from a rocky beach before heading for the drop-off point. Once I\u0027m in place, I unwrap the body and attach the stones with the rope. As the boat drifts, I raise the binoculars and study the coastline. When I\u0027m sure it\u0027s safe, I haul up the body and position it by the side of the deck. One last check, then I bend over and send Axel Nelke to a watery grave, sparing him neither a prayer nor a curse. His personal belongings follow, except for his gun, which I\u0027ve left under the seat in the car. I\u0027m holding on to that, in case I need it later. I scan the coast again - clear - then head out into the Channel, where I idle away the rest of the day, shedding the sheets and plastic bags as I go, in different places. With night drawing in, I meet up with Peter, make sure he got the money and thank him for the loan of the boat. He tries persuading me to stay another day, but I say that I have to move on. I buy him a couple of whiskies, then trudge back to the hotel, where I shower the scent of salt out of my hair. I\u0027m anxious to return to London, but it\u0027s late. Better to leave it until morning. Too many bad things can happen in the dark. The hotel\u0027s Wi-Fi is no good to me, since my laptop\u0027s in London and I don\u0027t own a smartphone, but there\u0027s a small business centre. I go online before I check out and investigate long-term parking options in London. I want to keep things straightforward, so I settle on the car park at Heathrow. I can see from their site that there\u0027s a twenty-five-day parking rate, so nobody should bother with the car for a month, by which time I\u0027ll hopefully be long gone. I also research shopping malls and choose WestQuay in Southampton, since it\u0027s on my way back. When I get there after an uneventful drive - I\u0027ve had far more luck with the Skoda than poor Axel Nelke - I buy a suitcase, a wide-brimmed hat and dark sunglasses, a pack of Handi Wipes, new shoes and a jacket. I remove all the labels on my way to the car and dump them. Slip on the shoes, stick the case in the trunk, lay the rest of the gear on the passenger seat, and I\u0027m set. With the help of the map I make Heathrow early in the afternoon, collect my ticket at the barrier and find a quiet parking spot. Opening the wipes, I quickly clean inside the car, wheel, handles, switches, anywhere I might have touched. I\u0027ve worn gloves all the time, but I\u0027m paranoid, worried that I maybe took them off for a few seconds at some point and forgot about it. When it comes to prints, you can\u0027t be too cautious, not in this day and age. Pulling on the hat, glasses and jacket, I get out - carefully wiping the side of the door and the outside handle as I go - and pull the suitcase out of the trunk, again taking the time to erase any prints as I close it. I think about taking the keys with me, but I don\u0027t want to be caught with them on my person, so I open the driver\u0027s door and stash them under the dashboard, leaving the door unlocked. Not the best way to dispose of a car, but it will suffice. If I need to, I can collect it later and lose it for good. Right now, I just want rid of the damn thing. I also leave the gun under the seat. I considered ditching it en route, but figured it might be useful to have a weapon where I can lay hands on it if things get messy. Taking off the gloves and pocketing them, I lug the case to the bus stop, acting as if it\u0027s packed with clothes, in case an eagle-eyed guard happens to be watching and thinks it strange that someone would park in long-term without a suitcase. This makes me look like just another tourist heading off to catch a flight to the sun. After a short wait, a bus takes me from the car park to the terminal. I keep the hat and glasses on the whole way, and my head down, all too conscious of the British predilection for CCTV - they have security cameras everywhere in this most watchful of countries. I wander around the airport a while, then catch the Tube into central London. It\u0027s crazy, returning like this. I should have paid someone to fetch my passport from the hotel - you can always find a willing gopher at an airport, backpackers who are happy to ask no questions if you flash enough cash - then caught the first flight out. But I can\u0027t run, not while there\u0027s hope that Andeanna still loves me. I think about her all the way in, staring down at my hands, wondering what the future holds in store for us. I have to change lines at Hammersmith. I get off and cross the platform to the District Line. As a train approaches, my attention is drawn to a man and his son. The boy can\u0027t be more than four or five. He\u0027s white-faced and crying - he seems to be scared of the incoming train. As his father tries to comfort him, the boy throws up. Feeling sorry for the child, I glance aside, wanting to afford the pair some privacy. As my head turns, I catch sight of someone rushing towards me. Before I can react, a man throws himself at me, hands waving furiously, eyes wide, mouth opened in a grotesque grimace. Instinct kicks in and I jerk away from my mad-looking assailant. My left heel catches and I start to topple backwards, on to the track, in front of the incoming train. It\u0027s slowing down, but won\u0027t be able to stop before it smashes into me. My arms flail as I try to regain my balance, but I can tell it\u0027s too late. I\u0027m done for. Then, as I\u0027m falling, a lost cause, a station guard grabs my arm and wheels me back on to my feet. \u0027Easy, sir,\u0027 he chuckles, as if it\u0027s no big thing, as if he hasn\u0027t just saved my life. \u0027Don\u0027t want to give the boy any more of a fright, do we?\u0027 \u0027Thank you,\u0027 I gasp, heart pounding, legs trembling as the train screeches past. I extend a hand, but the guard has already moved on. He doesn\u0027t have time to shake hands with stupid Americans who can\u0027t obey the simplest and most repeated of orders on the underground - stand away from the edge of the platform. I look around, searching for the man who almost sent me reeling to my doom. He\u0027s in front of me, glaring. Axel Nelke\u0027s ghost. \u0027Didn\u0027t take you long to make your presence known,\u0027 I mutter, glaring back at the real or imagined ghost as it\u0027s surrounded by the other shades, all seven bunching together to subject me to their combined blistering gaze. How happy the rest would have been if Axel\u0027s sneaky ploy had worked! Though I think there would have been an element of jealousy there too. The six of them have spent the last several years trying to drive me mad or shock me at a critical moment, to no avail. How small would they have felt if Nelke had swaggered on to the scene and got rid of me at the first attempt? \u0027Better luck next time,\u0027 I sneer, then board the train and head for home. Back in my room, I drop the jacket, shoes, hat, glasses and gloves into the suitcase - I\u0027ll get rid of it later - and head for the shower, where I soak for twenty minutes, then dry off and lie naked on the bed, staring at the ceiling. The phone rings as I\u0027m scratching an elbow. Not my cell, which I\u0027ve kept switched off the entire time I was away. The room phone. I stare at it suspiciously. Andeanna? Surely it\u0027s too soon for her to be calling. \u0027Hello?\u0027 I answer cautiously. \u0027Ed?\u0027 I breathe easily. \u0027Hi, Joe. How\u0027s tricks?\u0027 \u0027You son of a bitch!\u0027 He shouts down the line at me for a full minute. I hold the phone away from my ear, letting him blow off steam. When he pauses for breath, I ask if he\u0027s finished. \u0027Finished? I\u0027m only getting started! I was worried sick. I thought you\u0027d been in an accident. I rang the hospitals and police to find out if - \u0027 \u0027What did you say to the police?\u0027 I interrupt sharply. \u0027Nothing much. I just asked if they could tell me if you\u0027d been in a car crash or anything like that.\u0027 \u0027Did you file a missing-person report?\u0027 \u0027I was tempted to.\u0027 \u0027But you didn\u0027t?\u0027 Relaxing a little. \u0027No,\u0027 he grumbles. \u0027I thought it might have something to do with Andeanna.\u0027 Wise little Joe. \u0027Did you ring her?\u0027 I ask, trying to sound casual. \u0027I don\u0027t have her number. I looked in the directory but she isn\u0027t listed and you never told me the name of her husband.\u0027 \u0027Just as well. I can imagine you phoning to ask if his wife\u0027s lover was OK.\u0027 \u0027Please!\u0027 Joe snaps. \u0027Credit me with some common sense.\u0027 \u0027I credit you with a lot more than that.\u0027 I claim that I did leave on account of Andeanna, that I went to see her and we had a blazing row, after which I stormed out of London in a huff, not thinking about Joe, the book or anything else, even forgetting about my flight home. \u0027I should have called,\u0027 I admit humbly. \u0027It was wrong to leave you hanging. But my thoughts were all over the place. I just drove, slept in the car and ate when hunger dictated.\u0027 \u0027Is it really over?\u0027 Joe asks. \u0027I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll wait for her to ring. If she doesn\u0027t . . . \u0027 Joe says he came to the hotel the morning of my scheduled return to America, to see me off. Thinking he\u0027d missed me, he hurried to the airport, but there was no sign of me and I hadn\u0027t checked in. When the flight took off and I failed to show at the hotel, he started to worry. \u0027Where\u0027d you go?\u0027 he asks. \u0027I\u0027m not really sure,\u0027 I lie, trying to picture a map of the British Isles. \u0027I wandered randomly. I passed Birmingham on my way back, so I guess I must have gone north.\u0027 \u0027You should have taken me with you,\u0027 he says. \u0027I could have introduced you to my family. Some of them don\u0027t believe I\u0027m working with you on the book. They think I\u0027m making it up.\u0027 Talk turns to Spirit of the Fire and my future plans. Joe wants to know if I\u0027m still going back to the States. I tell him I\u0027m not sure. \u0027And the book?\u0027 he presses. \u0027I can\u0027t focus on that now. I\u0027m going to leave it for a while. Later, when I\u0027m thinking straight, I\u0027ll tackle it again.\u0027 \u0027OK,\u0027 Joe sighs. \u0027If that\u0027s the way you want it.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not what I want, but I\u0027m in no state of mind to deal with all the complications of a novel. We\u0027ll get round to it, I promise. I just don\u0027t know when.\u0027 He asks if I\u0027d like him to come over. I tell him I\u0027m a mess, tired, confused. I say I\u0027ll ring in a day or two and we\u0027ll meet up, sit down and discuss the matter over a bottle of wine, but for now I just want to be on my own. He wishes me well, makes me promise not to flee the city again, then hangs up and leaves me sitting naked on the edge of the bed. After a few minutes I switch on my cell phone and stare at it glumly, waiting for Andeanna to call, yearning to hear her voice, but dreading what she might have to say.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-10.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
