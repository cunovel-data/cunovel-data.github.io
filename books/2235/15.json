{"id":108125,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"PART FOUR\n Chapter Fourteen\n Eventually life returns to my limbs. Paper grasped in one sweaty hand, I stumble through the station to the taxi rank and tell a cabbie to drive me back to the Royal Munster. They\u0027re surprised to see me return, but not half as surprised as I am. I mumble a story about a friend being taken seriously ill. The receptionist is genuinely concerned. When she realizes I\u0027ve returned without my bags, she says she\u0027ll arrange for their retrieval. I mutter a subdued thank-you.\n In my new room, I sink on to the bed and stare at the photograph in the paper. Burnt to death. I clutch it close the entire night, even as I drift in and out of sleep over the course of the long, dark, crazy hours. The ghosts revel in my sickening bewilderment. They wrap themselves around me and coil and uncoil like snakes whenever my eyes flicker open.\n In the morning, I order breakfast and eat mechanically, forcing down the food. After that I phone Andeanna, even though it\u0027s dangerous, hoping the call will clear up the confusion. But the number has been disconnected. I want to try the house, but if the paper got it wrong (it must have) and Andeanna is alive and well (she must be), then ringing the mansion could be the biggest mistake of my life.\n I pace the room to get the blood flowing to my brain. There has to be a logical explanation. The journalist might have been misinformed. Perhaps the article was a huge screw-up. I need to check other sources.\n If it\u0027s not a mistake, maybe it\u0027s a smokescreen. Andeanna might not have wanted to face the press. Perhaps she faked a rumour that she died years ago, so reporters wouldn\u0027t come bothering her.\n No. No matter how hysterical I might be, I can see that I\u0027m clutching at straws with that one. You can\u0027t turn around, pretend to be dead and expect the press to buy it.\n What if Andeanna was the Turk\u0027s second wife? Maybe he was married before, and the paper mixed up the photographs. Or what if she was never married to him in the first place?\n I pause in the middle of my pacing. Maybe Andeanna was only a mistress. I scan the photo again. It looks like the woman I know, but the similarity might be what drew Menderes to her.\n I whip out my pad and pen and jot down Deleena Emerson. That could be her true name. Maybe the woman I initially fell for was the real deal, and Andeanna Menderes is the fake.\n Relief floods my system. For a mad, unhinged period, I thought I\u0027d fallen in love with a ghost. I knew it was lunacy, but I couldn\u0027t see any other explanation. Now I know better. Andeanna/Deleena is flesh and blood, like anybody else, but with some hidden, twisted agenda of her own. I hope she truly loves me, that she wasn\u0027t acting just to trick me into killing the Turk. I could forgive her anything if she loves me. But whatever her motives, she\u0027s real, she exists, she\u0027s alive.\n And I\u0027m going to find her.\n By the weekend, I don\u0027t know what to think. Was she real, a ghost, an impostor, a figment of my imagination? I can\u0027t even hazard a guess.\n I\u0027ve spent the last three days in the library. It hasn\u0027t been easy, especially with the ghosts continually taunting me, seeking to distract and further disorient me, but I forced myself to focus. First I worked through this week\u0027s papers and magazines, reading every published article about Mikis Menderes. I learnt more about the man than I ever cared to. There was plenty about Andeanna, too. She was born to a decent family. Her father was a successful accountant, her mother - Deleena Moore, nee Emerson - a housewife and amateur actress. Andeanna was a bright student with a promising future, but fell in love with Menderes and married him shortly after her eighteenth birthday, against the wishes of her parents. She was a dutiful wife who raised their son and had nothing to do with the Turk\u0027s business affairs. She died one month short of her twenty-seventh birthday.\n Twenty-seven. I recall how young I thought she was when we first met. I had her pegged for twenty-something. Later she convinced me that she was in her early forties, which is the age she would be. If she was alive.\n There were photos of the Turk with some of his lovers. None could pass for his wife\u0027s double. I went back further and found snaps of his old flames, but no one who looked like Andeanna.\n Maybe one of the Turk\u0027s foes found a doppelganger, briefed her on Andeanna\u0027s past and set her up to frame me. But why go to such lunatic lengths? There are far easier ways to kill a man. It makes no sense. Unless . . .\n Unless I was another Sebastian Dash. Perhaps the Turk\u0027s enemy was on the inside and needed a fall guy. That would explain how Andeanna was able to get in and out of the mansion. She might have been working for Bond Gardiner or one of the Turk\u0027s other trusted aides, someone who had to distance themselves from the murder, by weaving as complex a web as possible.\n So many theories, each more warped than the one before. I groan and push myself away from the photos, the papers, the computer, and head back to the hotel. On the way, I find myself digging out my phone and dialling Joe\u0027s number. I get his voicemail. As much as I hate leaving messages, I croak, \u0027It\u0027s Ed. I need to talk. Please call me or come to the hotel. It\u0027s important.\u0027\n It\u0027s wrong to involve Joe. However perilous the situation was before, it\u0027s ten times as likely to end in disaster now. But I need someone to bounce ideas off, a friend to steer me straight. I\u0027m going crazy on my own. Literally.\n In my room, I ignore the notes and photocopies which have consumed my last few days and nights, and instead of poring over them, I sit by the window and stare at the sky. For once, the ghosts leave me alone. I doubt they feel sorry for me. They probably just want to give me some quiet time, to soften me up, before launching a fresh offensive.\n A couple of hours later, I haven\u0027t moved. I\u0027m chewing on my fingernails when someone knocks on the door. I cross the room suspiciously and open the door a crack. For a split second I think it\u0027s Andeanna, and my hopes flare. Then my eyes focus and it\u0027s just Joe, looking bemused. \u0027You rang, m\u0027lord?\u0027\n \u0027Thanks for coming.\u0027 I let him in.\n Joe stares around at the mess. \u0027Is everything OK?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 I choke. \u0027Everything\u0027s fucking horrible.\u0027\n It\u0027s insanity, but I tell him the whole story, about my past, Andeanna, the Turk, Axel Nelke, Sebastian Dash, the murder. I tell him things that I didn\u0027t even tell the fake Andeanna, talking for the first time ever about my ghosts. Joe listens silently, asking no questions, though his eyes flicker nervously when I describe my ever-present shades. At the end, exhausted, I trickle to a halt and await his response.\n Without saying anything, he walks to the bathroom. He\u0027s in there ten minutes. When he returns, his face is damp, pearls of water glistening on his moustache and beard. He shakes his head and says, \u0027Was that the truth, Ed?\u0027\n \u0027You think I\u0027d make up something that crazy?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re a writer. Crazy plots are your life. Maybe this is a new idea for a book and you\u0027re testing it out on me to see how - \u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s true,\u0027 I stop him. \u0027Every word. No bullshit.\u0027\n He sinks into a chair. \u0027You killed people.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027That crap about not having my name associated with the book - was that to keep me out of this, to keep me safe?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 he says drily.\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t involve you. If something went wrong and you\u0027d been sucked in . . . \u0027\n \u0027So why involve me now?\u0027\n \u0027I had nobody else to turn to,\u0027 I answer honestly.\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Joe grins.\n \u0027You can leave if you want. You don\u0027t have to stay.\u0027\n \u0027After the story you\u0027ve spun? I couldn\u0027t walk away from a mystery like this, as you well know, you manipulative bastard.\u0027\n \u0027Do you hate me?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 He jumps to his feet. \u0027But we\u0027ll get into that another time. First we have to figure out what\u0027s going on. Show me your notes. Maybe there\u0027s something you\u0027ve missed. That is why you asked me over here, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I say, shamefaced.\n \u0027Then let\u0027s not dilly-dally, as the actress said to the bishop.\u0027 He strides to the nearest stack of papers then glances back at me. \u0027If it\u0027s any comfort, I\u0027d have called for help too in your shoes.\u0027\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 I smile.\n \u0027But that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s right,\u0027 he growls. \u0027It just means I\u0027m as dumb and selfish as you.\u0027\n With midnight approaching, we break for a coffee. Joe is as confused by now as I am. He favours the impostor theory, but proposes a new twist on who might have put her up to it. \u0027Maybe there was no middleman. What if this was personal, her looking to get even with Menderes? Let\u0027s say she was his mistress and he pissed her off. She finds out who you really are and - \u0027\n \u0027How?\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027I don\u0027t advertise it in the biography on my website.\u0027\n \u0027People have a way of discovering things when they go looking for answers,\u0027 he says. \u0027She learns the truth about you and cons you into falling in love with her and killing Menderes, having passed herself off as his dead wife to make sure the shit couldn\u0027t rebound and stick to her.\u0027\n \u0027But she looks so much like the woman in the photos,\u0027 I mutter.\n \u0027Maybe they were related,\u0027 Joe says, then his face lights up. \u0027Maybe that\u0027s it! A younger sister or daughter who wanted to kill Menderes for the way he treated his wife when she was alive.\u0027\n \u0027The papers said she was an only child, and they didn\u0027t mention any children apart from Gregory.\u0027\n \u0027Every family has secrets, Ed. Maybe she had another kid when she was too young to wed. The daughter grows up, finds out that Menderes used to bully her mother, comes looking for revenge.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re stretching, Joe.\u0027\n \u0027Sometimes the truth is so weird, you have to stand on your toes and reach at full stretch to touch it.\u0027\n \u0027Very poetic,\u0027 I commend him.\n \u0027You don\u0027t buy it?\u0027\n I sigh. \u0027It\u0027s thin.\u0027\n Joe thinks again. \u0027There\u0027s another explanation,\u0027 he says softly. \u0027She might have been . . . \u0027 He stops and pulls a face.\n \u0027A ghost?\u0027 I finish for him. Joe nods glumly and looks away. \u0027No,\u0027 I whisper. \u0027Ghosts aren\u0027t real.\u0027\n Joe gawps at me. \u0027How can you say that, having just told me about your own private posse?\u0027\n I chuckle sickly. \u0027Just because I see them, it doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re real.\u0027\n \u0027You think you\u0027re crazy?\u0027 Joe asks.\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to be,\u0027 I mutter. \u0027That\u0027s why I went down the investigative road in the first place, to try to prove they were real, that there is an afterlife, that the shades of the dead can come back. That seemed preferable to accepting the fact that I\u0027d lost my mind.\u0027\n \u0027Now you\u0027d rather be mad?\u0027 Joe sniffs.\n I shrug. \u0027No. But having searched for proof for so long without finding any, I can\u0027t believe that it would drop into my lap in such astonishing fashion. Besides, even if my ghosts are real, Andeanna was different. She was flesh and blood, not a phantom. Other people saw her.\u0027\n \u0027I never saw her,\u0027 Joe reminds me.\n \u0027Waiters saw her, cab drivers, Axel Nelke.\u0027\n Joe squints. \u0027Maybe she found a way to come back from the dead and take physical shape, like the guy in Spirit of the Fire.\u0027\n I laugh harshly. \u0027Don\u0027t be stupid.\u0027\n \u0027Hey, it\u0027s your theory,\u0027 he retorts. \u0027We know that Andeanna Menderes burnt to death. What if she was a victim of spontaneous human combustion? She dies traumatically, her spirit can\u0027t rest, she returns in a new body, seeking revenge on the husband she hated . . . \u0027\n \u0027That was a plot device,\u0027 I growl. \u0027I treated it seriously because when you write, you have to make the world of the story seem as real as possible. But I know what\u0027s real and what\u0027s not. If you can\u0027t tell the difference, maybe you should - \u0027\n \u0027Hold on,\u0027 Joe interrupts hotly. \u0027I never saw this dream lover of yours. For all I know, she never existed and you\u0027re completely gone in the head. You say that waiters and taxi drivers saw her, but maybe you imagined them as well. Hell, maybe I\u0027m not real. You could be sitting here arguing with yourself and . . . \u0027 He grinds to a halt and scratches an ear. \u0027I lost the run of that, didn\u0027t I?\u0027\n \u0027You were going good until you tried to write yourself off,\u0027 I smile.\n \u0027But you get my point. Logically I should disregard everything you say and call in the men in the white coats. But you\u0027re my friend. I\u0027d rather believe in a ghost than denounce you as a lunatic.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 I sigh. \u0027Sorry for snapping. Truth is, I\u0027m not so sure of my sanity. That\u0027s why I want to keep things as level as possible. If I head down crazy paths, I don\u0027t know where I\u0027ll end up.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 Joe says. \u0027I\u0027ll lay off the ghost angle. But can I ask you one more thing before I let it lie?\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027Did you . . . \u0027 His cheeks redden. \u0027Did you have sex with her?\u0027 I silently count to ten before replying. \u0027Why do you want to know?\u0027\n \u0027Your ghosts are silent, ineffective, insubstantial things, but that doesn\u0027t mean that every wandering spirit must be. I think a more advanced ghost could pass for human in all sorts of ways, fake the look, scent, maybe even the feel of a person. But in the most intimate of couplings, when it\u0027s just the two of you, everything\u0027s been laid bare and you\u0027re exploring every last inch of your lover\u0027s body? I can\u0027t imagine a phantasm managing to be that convincing.\u0027\n I think of my asexual relationship with Andeanna. The lines she fed me about the Turk and her gynaecologist. How I never even saw her naked.\n I call it a night. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-15.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: \n Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
