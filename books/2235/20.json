{"id":108130,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"PART FIVE\\n\\n Chapter Nineteen\\n\\n I\u0027m ready to transfer all of my savings across to Etienne Anders, but she only laughs when I mention a fee and says the first time is free. I protest vehemently, but she\u0027s adamant. She says the joy in my expression is payment enough and suggests I make a charitable donation if I feel strongly about it.\\n\\n \u0027It went well, didn\u0027t it?\u0027 she notes as I dry my face with a fistful of tissues. \u0027I could tell you were miserable. Your pain was dragging behind you like an anchor. Now I see plain sails blowing in a soft wind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A nice turn of phrase,\u0027 I compliment her.\\n\\n \u0027Guff like that is my forte, love,\u0027 she grins. \u0027But it did help, didn\u0027t it? You got through to her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 I lower the damp tissues and beam.\\n\\n \u0027She must have been very special, judging by the effect she has on the men in her life. Greygo bawled like a baby the first time he made contact.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t say I was bawling, exactly,\u0027 I grunt.\\n\\n \u0027Of course you wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 she laughs. \u0027Men like to act tough. But a man never truly fools a woman, not if he lives to be a hundred.\u0027\\n\\n She invites me to stay for a cup of tea, but I\u0027d rather be alone. I want to replay my conversation with Andeanna, commit every last word and nuance to memory. Etienne escorts me to the front door and tells me to come again any time. I know I won\u0027t be returning, but I thank her and promise to deal with her exclusively in future if I have need of a medium.\\n\\n Then I depart, heading out into the night and the rest of my life.\\n\\n I drive back slowly to the hotel through the misting London rain. I think I\u0027ll leave this city soon. It holds too many memories. I\u0027ll visit again one day, check out the restaurants and pubs that Andeanna and I frequented, take a boat ride down the Thames and reminisce about the wine glass that started it all, but for the moment I want to get far away and unwind. Maybe somewhere tropical, where I can relax on a beach, go for long swims and dream of Andeanna. Spirit of the Fire will have to wait. I\u0027ll call Jonathan in the morning and tell him to cancel the contract. I might trickle back to it a year or two from now, or to some other story, or maybe I won\u0027t. Maybe I\u0027m done writing. Why chase wonders in print when you\u0027ve experienced them first-hand in real life?\\n\\n I smile in my rear-view mirror at the glowering ghosts. I hold nothing against them. I feel sorry for the seven shades, seeing them for what they truly are, trapped, tormented souls. Now that I know they\u0027re real, I can look for some way to release them, to set them free from their earthly chains, so they can follow Andeanna\u0027s spirit into whatever lies beyond. My priority to this point has been proving my sanity. Now that I no longer doubt the stability of my mind, I can focus on helping those I\u0027ve unwittingly tied to this physical realm.\\n\\n The cheerful hotel doorman, Fred Lloyd, is sheltering from the rain inside the foyer. I wave to him as I drive past, but he doesn\u0027t see me. I must ask if he knows any good beaches. I\u0027m sure he\u0027d be able to make some interesting suggestions.\\n\\n The underground car park is quiet. Strong yellow lights press back the gloomy shadows, and the smell of gasoline is subtler than usual, which means the floors have been washed recently. I pull into an empty spot and slide out of my car. A sky-blue BMW slots into a space a little further up and a tall man gets out. He sees me approaching and nods politely. \u0027Evening.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good evening,\u0027 I reply, only barely glancing at him as I pass, mind dancing, marvelling at what the night has brought.\\n\\n When the man steps up behind me and trips me, I think it\u0027s an accident. I get ready to wave away his apology with a laugh. Then he shoves me to the ground and hurls himself on top of me.\\n\\n My first thought - he\u0027s a mugger. Then - no, he\u0027s driving a BMW. I don\u0027t waste any more time considering it. He has me pinned, but not securely. My right hand is free. Making a blade of my fingers, I drive them back over my shoulder and connect with his cheekbone. My nails cut into his flesh and slice up towards his eye. He jerks back a fraction. I throw him off and elbow him aside.\\n\\n While my assailant flounders, I leap to my feet and turn to kick him if he draws a gun or a knife. But he\u0027s just cowering, patting the scratch on his cheek, wincing like a child.\\n\\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 I snap, nudging his lower legs to attract his attention.\\n\\n \u0027Fuck off!\u0027 he shouts, kicking back.\\n\\n \u0027Tell me who you are or I\u0027ll - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s enough, Mr Sieveking,\u0027 a voice says behind me.\\n\\n I don\u0027t turn and gawp. I know better than that. Instead I swivel to my right, meaning to dive behind the nearest car for cover. A bullet spits up the floor in front of me.\\n\\n \u0027I won\u0027t miss with the next. Hands behind your head, Mr Sieveking, then drop to your knees.\u0027 Grimacing with disgust, I do as he orders. The decoy gets to his feet and steps forward, meaning to let me have a fist or knee in the face. \u0027There\u0027s no call for that, Officer Langbein.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said my name!\u0027 the officer yaps.\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter. He won\u0027t be telling anyone.\u0027\\n\\n Langbein glares at me, fingers flexing by his sides, but stays where he is.\\n\\n \u0027Fetch the chloroform, Alan,\u0027 the man with the gun says, and Langbein shuffles off to the BMW. \u0027We\u0027re going to put you to sleep for a while, Mr Sieveking. I\u0027d wish you pleasant dreams, but we both know it\u0027s only nightmares for you from here on in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who the fuck are you?\u0027 I ask, expecting no reply.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll see soon enough,\u0027 he purrs.\\n\\n Langbein returns with a small bottle, which he opens and tips into a cloth. A dark stain spreads from the centre.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll hold your breath and feign unconsciousness,\u0027 the man behind me says, \u0027but I won\u0027t lower my guard until I\u0027m sure you\u0027re out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If money\u0027s an issue . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027It isn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Care to tell me what is?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Soon, Mr Sieveking, soon.\u0027\\n\\n Langbein jams the handkerchief over my mouth and nose and holds it in place, clasping the back of my head with his other hand to stop me pulling away.\\n\\n As the fumes set my senses spinning, the man with the gun steps in front of me, revealing his face. It\u0027s a calculated move, designed to make me gasp and draw in the noxious fumes more quickly. The last thing I hear before blacking out is my captor murmuring, \u0027Night-night, Severs.\u0027 And the last thing I see through watery tears is the distorted face of Sebastian Dash as he bends over me and laughs.\\n\\n Then it\u0027s just blackness.\\n\\n Consciousness returns slowly. At first I think I\u0027m safe in bed. I wonder why it\u0027s so dark, why the bed is rocking and what the strange growling noise is. As my brain clicks into place, I recall the grinning face of Sebastian Dash, and moments later everything is clear.\\n\\n I\u0027m gagged and my hands are tied behind my back. I try rotating my fingers, in search of the slightest slack, but Dash knows his knots as well as I do. We learnt from the same teachers. I\u0027ll go on testing the ropes - nothing ventured, nothing gained - but Dash isn\u0027t the sort who lets a fish wriggle free once it\u0027s hooked.\\n\\n I\u0027m in the locked trunk of a moving car. I\u0027ve no idea how much time has passed since I was knocked out. I don\u0027t even begin to guess where he\u0027s taking me.\\n\\n As well as the rope around my hands, another binds my ankles. They\u0027re linked by a third length, further limiting my movements. There\u0027s also a long, thin noose around my neck, connected to the other ropes. It tightens when I struggle. I\u0027m certain Dash has rigged it so it won\u0027t choke me to death - he wants me alive until he\u0027s had time to play with me - but it could cut off my oxygen supply long enough to force another blackout.\\n\\n While I seek a weakness in the ropes, I probe the puzzle of how I\u0027ve fallen prey to Sebastian Dash. He must not have fled when the Turk was killed. He hung around, despite the danger, to search for the person who framed him. He couldn\u0027t do that personally while Bond Gardiner and his crew were hunting him. So he must have had help - the decoy, Alan Langbein. Dash probably recruited him to do the legwork, ask questions, stake out pubs. Langbein must have heard about the journalist who was writing a book, checked up on me, maybe followed me and took photos.\\n\\n I\u0027ve only myself to blame for this. I should have been more careful. I never looked for a tail. I thought Dash was out of the equation. I fucked up, plain and simple, and now I\u0027m going to pay with my life.\\n\\n I go on working at the knots and plotting ways out of this mess - I\u0027ll head-butt him in the stomach when he opens the trunk, spit in his eye, maybe latch on to his nose and bite. But I know it\u0027s hopeless. Hollywood heroes blast their way out of tight spots like this week in, week out, but that\u0027s not how it works in reality. When your arms and legs are tied, and there\u0027s a rope around your throat, and you\u0027re languishing in the trunk of a killer\u0027s car, you\u0027re finished, roll credits.\\n\\n My ghosts know it\u0027s the end of me. They\u0027re crouched close around. I can sense them, even though I can\u0027t see clearly, crowing with laughter, knowing their time of release is far closer than I believed it was. They don\u0027t need my help to escape the pull of this world. A bullet through my brain, courtesy of Sebastian Dash, and all their worries are behind them. Their ordeal is almost over. Mine, on the other hand, is just beginning. Where do the souls of the guilty go when they cast off their mortal coil? Nowhere good, I\u0027m guessing.\\n\\n The car slows and takes a left. By the bumping that follows, I figure we\u0027ve left the main road. Heading somewhere nice and quiet.\\n\\n Finally the car draws to a stop and I hear the driver getting out. No further sounds, meaning one of them is either still in the car or hasn\u0027t made the journey. A key is inserted into the lock of the trunk and it swings open. My captor nimbly steps back out of the way, in case I\u0027ve managed to work myself free of the ropes.\\n\\n Although it\u0027s brighter outside than in the trunk, it\u0027s a dark night and it takes my eyes a few moments to adjust and focus on Sebastian Dash, gun in hand. I glare at him, filled with loathing. He chuckles at my foul expression, makes sure I\u0027m still tied tight, then leans forward to remove my gag. \u0027It\u0027s been a long time, Brad.\u0027 I don\u0027t reply. \u0027You\u0027ve put on a bit of weight, but it suits you.\u0027 Silence. He sighs theatrically. \u0027Are you sour because of Antonia?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fuck you,\u0027 I snarl.\\n\\n \u0027Ah. He talks.\u0027 Dash laughs bitingly, then squats and locks gazes. \u0027You made the biggest mistake of your life involving me in this shit,\u0027 he says coldly. \u0027Did you think I wouldn\u0027t come looking for the son of a bitch who set me up?\u0027 He waits for me to answer. I let him go on waiting. \u0027What drove you to this madness, Brad? You\u0027ve hated me a long time, but you weren\u0027t dumb enough to come after me when you could have maybe taken me, when you were sharp and in shape, so I assumed you never would. I thought our quarrel was behind us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not a quarrel,\u0027 I retort.\\n\\n \u0027No?\u0027 His smile returns. \u0027What, then? A vendetta?\u0027 I don\u0027t answer. \u0027No matter. We\u0027ll find out soon enough. It will all come out in the wash.\u0027 Standing, he raises a cell phone - my phone - and dials one-handed. When he connects, he says, \u0027Are you ready?\u0027 A pause. \u0027Alone?\u0027 Another pause. \u0027If you pull anything stupid, the deal\u0027s off and you\u0027ll never know.\u0027 A long pause, then he grunts, hits disconnect and dials a new number. \u0027He\u0027s there. He says he\u0027s alone and unarmed. Remember what I told you. If it feels wrong . . . \u0027 Dash listens, grunts again, hangs up.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s going down?\u0027 I ask.\\n\\n \u0027You are,\u0027 he smirks. Then he slams shut the roof of the trunk and plunges me back into darkness.\\n\\n When the roof lifts again, Alan Langbein is standing beside Sebastian Dash. The two men haul me out of the trunk, Dash wisely taking my head in case I lash out with my bound feet. They drop me to the floor. We\u0027re in an oak-surrounded glade. As I roll on to my back, I spot a third figure behind the others - Bond Gardiner.\\n\\n \u0027This is the man you claim killed Mikis?\u0027 Gardiner rumbles.\\n\\n \u0027Ed Sieveking, the one and only,\u0027 Dash agrees.\\n\\n \u0027He told me his name was Edgar Sanders, that he was writing a book.\u0027\\n\\n Dash laughs. \u0027That might not have been total bullshit. This is the famous Ed Sieveking. Surely you\u0027ve read about his critically acclaimed work in the Times or the Guardian? Modern classics like Nights of Fear and Winter\u0027s Shades.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Summer\u0027s Shades,\u0027 I correct him automatically.\\n\\n \u0027A regular on the best-seller lists,\u0027 Dash presses on. \u0027The most successful horror writer of his generation.\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner grunts. \u0027I\u0027m not much of a reader.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve never heard of him either,\u0027 Langbein frowns. \u0027And I read a lot of horror. Are you sure he\u0027s a best-seller?\u0027\\n\\n Dash rolls his eyes. \u0027I was taking the piss, Alan. This poor fucker couldn\u0027t even give away copies of his lame potboilers, could you, Brad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fuck you,\u0027 I grunt.\\n\\n \u0027With a limited vocabulary like that, one hardly need wonder why,\u0027 Dash grins, then addresses Gardiner again. \u0027I didn\u0027t expect you to recognize his pen name. I bet you know this one, though - Elland Severin.\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner\u0027s eyes widen. \u0027The assassin?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bingo.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he retired years ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And swapped his gun for a typewriter - or is it a computer, Brad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A computer,\u0027 I sniff.\\n\\n \u0027Why do you keep calling him Brad?\u0027 Gardiner asks.\\n\\n \u0027That was his original name, Brad Severs, the name he went by in the army. We go back, Brad and me. Recruits together. He knew me as Simon Dale. Didn\u0027t have much time for me or my buddy, Parson McNally. A couple of his friends wound us up. There was a fight. Parson and one of Brad\u0027s compadres didn\u0027t walk away from it. I went to prison, Brad went free. A few years later we were hired by Carter Phell, though neither of us knew about the other. A woman brought us together. The beautiful Belinda Darnier - now the savagely scarred Antonia Smith.\\n\\n \u0027I paid Brad back for the mess he made of my life,\u0027 Dash continues. \u0027But I was merciful. I could have killed him, but I didn\u0027t. I thought that was the end of our feud. Obviously he had other ideas.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How\u0027s Belinda these days?\u0027 I sneer.\\n\\n \u0027Wealthy. Not as pretty as she used to be, though plastic surgery took care of the worst of the damage. She\u0027ll flip for joy when I tell her about this. She always wanted me to finish you off. She would have hired somebody else, except I told her I didn\u0027t think - \u0027\\n\\n Bond Gardiner coughs, cutting Dash short. \u0027I didn\u0027t come here to listen to you settle old scores. I don\u0027t know what the deal is between you two, and to be honest, I don\u0027t give a fuck. All I want to know is who killed Mikis and why.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Brad did!\u0027 Dash booms.\\n\\n \u0027Is that true?\u0027 Gardiner asks me.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I sigh.\\n\\n Gardiner\u0027s shoulders sag. \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Too long a story. Can\u0027t you just accept my confession and leave it at that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027 he barks, then eyes Dash. \u0027Do you know why he did it?\u0027\\n\\n Dash shakes his head. \u0027I haven\u0027t a clue.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell them what they want to know,\u0027 Langbein growls, kicking my left thigh.\\n\\n \u0027Might as well, Brad,\u0027 Dash says. \u0027We aren\u0027t leaving till you do. I\u0027m no sadist, but you know I can get nasty when I must, and hot-headed Alan here was born to dominate, weren\u0027t you, Alan?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Too fucking true,\u0027 Langbein laughs. He\u0027s acting tough, trying not to appear out of his depth, but I can tell he\u0027s new to this. I catch a quick look between Dash and Gardiner. I know what it means and take slight comfort in the knowledge that I won\u0027t be the only one joining the ranks of the dead today.\\n\\n I see no point in playing out the hand to the last. I\u0027d like to think I wouldn\u0027t crack under duress, but everybody does. There\u0027s only so much pain anyone can withstand before the tongue starts working by itself. I\u0027d rather go out with my dignity intact than wind up whimpering beneath the feet and fists of Alan Langbein. Besides, this way I can hold back the details I\u0027d rather not reveal, such as Joe\u0027s involvement. \u0027It started on a boat,\u0027 I begin, and take it from there.\\n\\n It\u0027s a long, convoluted story, even condensed, and the sun is rising by the time I finish. I tell them about my initial meeting with Andeanna, the name she gave, falling in love, learning her true identity, killing the guard, getting rid of the body, plotting to kill the Turk, finding the newspaper while I was waiting for my train, meeting with Andrew Moore, Gardiner, Greygo and the psychic. They listen in silence, bar a few hissed curses from Dash when I describe how I set him up.\\n\\n There\u0027s a long pause when I finish. I\u0027ve regaled them with a story that each of the trio will carry to his grave. When they\u0027ve forgotten my name, and maybe even their own, they\u0027ll remember Andeanna\u0027s and recall this tale of supernatural love, murder and deceit.\\n\\n Dash finally breaks the silence. \u0027The crazy bastard\u0027s telling the truth.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Gardiner says. \u0027He thinks he is, but he isn\u0027t. He can\u0027t be.\u0027\\n\\n Dash chuckles. \u0027You don\u0027t believe in ghosts?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How about you, Alan?\u0027\\n\\n Langbein shakes his head. \u0027This is too fucked to be true. He\u0027s mad as a hatter. We\u0027ll be doing him a favour when we kill him.\u0027\\n\\n Dash has been leaning against the car. Now he steps away from it and turns slowly, gazing around at the dawn shadows. \u0027Are your ghosts here with us?\u0027\\n\\n I glance at the shades of those I\u0027ve killed, standing in a line in front of me, sketched against the morning landscape, faces alight with expectation, but otherwise calm now that the end has come, waiting patiently, feeling no need to mock me in my final moments. \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where are they?\u0027\\n\\n I nod as much as I can. \u0027Over there.\u0027\\n\\n Dash squints. For long seconds he says nothing. Finally, disappointed, \u0027Nope. Can\u0027t see them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nobody can. Only me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe they\u0027re just in your head.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe,\u0027 I smile, knowing that that isn\u0027t so.\\n\\n He faces me, his expression oddly compassionate. \u0027I sometimes dream of the people I\u0027ve killed, and those are never easy nights. To face them every day when you\u0027re awake . . . \u0027 He shudders, then glances at Gardiner. \u0027Heard enough? I don\u0027t want to stick around any longer than we have to.\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner looks uncertain. My story has shaken him. He regards me warily, as if I\u0027m contagious. \u0027This isn\u0027t right,\u0027 he mutters.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t believe him?\u0027 Dash asks.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s told us all he can, but there\u0027s more to it. Someone set him up, just as he set you up. It couldn\u0027t have been a ghost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whatever,\u0027 Dash shrugs. \u0027I\u0027ve cleared my name and exposed the lunatic who framed me. If you want to chase it further, that\u0027s your business.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s do it!\u0027 Langbein hoots. \u0027Let\u0027s spill this fucker\u0027s guts!\u0027\\n\\n Dash and Gardiner share an amused smile. How can Langbein not see what\u0027s coming? I almost feel like warning him. If he wasn\u0027t such a dick, maybe I would. But anyone who\u0027ll kick a man when he\u0027s down doesn\u0027t deserve fair warning.\\n\\n \u0027What do you say?\u0027 Dash asks Gardiner. \u0027Are we done or not?\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner nods reluctantly. \u0027I guess we are.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re squared? You\u0027ll spread the word that I didn\u0027t kill Menderes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sweet.\u0027 Dash grins, raises his gun and fires twice.\\n\\n Two bullets shatter Alan Langbein\u0027s breastbone and make jagged red-white shards of his chest. He slams against the car, arms flying out Christ-like. Blood coughs from his mouth, spews over the ground in front of him, then he sinks to the floor, limp, broken, dead.\\n\\n \u0027Alas, poor Alan. I knew him, Horatio,\u0027 Dash deadpans.\\n\\n \u0027Show a bit of respect for the dead,\u0027 Gardiner scowls.\\n\\n \u0027You agreed to it,\u0027 Dash defends himself. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have cared if he\u0027d lived - he couldn\u0027t touch me - but you\u0027d have been a marked man. It was only a matter of time before he came looking for a pay-off. Men like Langbein get greedy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 Gardiner says, \u0027but I don\u0027t like it. Killing a cop\u0027s a messy business.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not this way,\u0027 Dash disagrees. \u0027It\u0027ll look like they shot each other. We don\u0027t have to worry about dumping the bodies or having them traced back to us. It\u0027s the perfect solution.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t think they\u0027ll tie Langbein or Sieveking to Mikis?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why should they? Alan wasn\u0027t working on the Menderes case, and Ed is just a writer. They\u0027ll wonder what it was about, turn over a lot of stones in an attempt to find out, but if we keep our mouths shut, who\u0027s to know but you and me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Andeanna,\u0027 I answer quietly.\\n\\n The two men stare at me, Dash contemptuously, Gardiner uneasily.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 Dash smirks. \u0027Apart from the ghost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whoever set him up,\u0027 Gardiner says. \u0027I can\u0027t slip away like you. I have to stay and deal with the fallout.\u0027\\n\\n Dash shrugs. \u0027We\u0027ve all got our crosses to bear. I doubt it will go any further than this, but it\u0027s your problem if it does. All I want to know is, are we done with Brad? Is it time to kiss the sweet prince good night?\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner thinks about it. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he says, and starts towards Langbein\u0027s cooling body.\\n\\n \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 Dash asks, the slightest hint of tension in his voice.\\n\\n \u0027Getting Langbein\u0027s gun,\u0027 Gardiner says without slowing. \u0027We\u0027ve got to make it look like they shot each other, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can fetch it,\u0027 Dash says quickly, taking a defensive step to his left.\\n\\n Gardiner looks over his shoulder, notes Dash\u0027s stance and turns, hands spread flat by his sides. \u0027This is very simple,\u0027 he growls, \u0027so I\u0027ll only say it once. This sack of shit killed Mikis Menderes. Mikis was like my brother. I swore revenge and I\u0027m gonna make good on that vow. If you have an issue with that, our relationship is about to take a very serious turn for the worse.\u0027\\n\\n I see Dash weighing up his options, deciding whether or not he can trust Bond Gardiner with a gun. For a moment it looks like he\u0027s going to object, and my heart leaps with the slightest tinge of hope - if these two start taking potshots at one another, I might walk away from this yet. Then Dash smiles. \u0027Be my guest,\u0027 he says magnanimously, and there goes my future.\\n\\n Gardiner makes his way to the sprawled body of Alan Langbein, pulls on a pair of thin plastic gloves, uses a nearby twig to swish back the corpse\u0027s jacket and prizes the dead officer\u0027s gun from its holster. Dash watches warily.\\n\\n Gardiner slips up behind me. I listen with resigned dread as he approaches, marking every step. I don\u0027t fear death, but now that it\u0027s upon me, I can\u0027t say that I welcome it either. The thought of entering the vast abyss fills me with fear. I know that Andeanna is waiting for me, but maybe I\u0027ll have to pay for my crimes. Perhaps my ghosts will attack my spirit, keep us separate, subject me to an eternity of torment.\\n\\n Gardiner towers above me. Turning my head, ignoring the rope about my throat, I watch as he cocks the pistol, then lays the tip of the barrel to my temple. I want to shut my eyes and wait for the end in darkness, but I can\u0027t. My eyelids won\u0027t work. I\u0027m forced to bear witness to my own death.\\n\\n \u0027Hey!\u0027 Dash snaps. I flinch, anticipating gunfire, but Gardiner\u0027s finger relaxes and he looks questioningly at Dash. \u0027You can\u0027t do it like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s supposed to look like they killed each other,\u0027 Dash says, exasperated, hurrying over. \u0027How\u0027s he meant to have shot Alan with a bullet plugged through his skull at point-blank range?\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner scowls. \u0027Sorry. I wasn\u0027t thinking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Dash agrees. \u0027You weren\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n He glares at me, then tucks his gun away and bends. \u0027Grab his feet,\u0027 he tells Gardiner. \u0027We don\u0027t want to leave tracks.\u0027\\n\\n They haul me away from Langbein and stand me up. I immediately drop to the floor. I\u0027m not going to make it easy for the bastards.\\n\\n \u0027Get up,\u0027 Dash snarls.\\n\\n \u0027Fuck you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hold him up for me,\u0027 Gardiner says to Dash.\\n\\n \u0027The fuck I will,\u0027 Dash snorts.\\n\\n Gardiner smiles. \u0027Still don\u0027t trust me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not that. Bullets can ricochet. The best marksman can miss. If you think I\u0027m going to stand next to him while you take aim, you\u0027ve got a fucking screw loose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK.\u0027 Gardiner kneels beside me. \u0027Sieveking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gardiner,\u0027 I reply politely, grinning in spite of everything.\\n\\n \u0027You made a good impression on me in the pub. I confided in you because I thought you were a man of honour. Now you\u0027ve made a fool of me. I don\u0027t like that. I want to take you back to my manor and let the boys play with you, put you through the kind of hell you don\u0027t even want to imagine. But Dash is right - killing you here, making it look like Langbein\u0027s work, is the simplest solution for all concerned, yourself included.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You want me to stand and take it like a man?\u0027 I sneer.\\n\\n \u0027If you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll pump a bullet through each of your knees, bundle you into the trunk and let you suffer the ride back to London, where the real pain will begin.\u0027\\n\\n I consider my options. A few more hours of life in exchange for a shitload of suffering. Not an attractive proposition. Of course, as long as I\u0027m alive, there\u0027s a chance I might escape. Gardiner could crash, or be pulled over by the police. The odds would be against me, but . . .\\n\\n No. One look at Gardiner\u0027s face and I know he doesn\u0027t make mistakes. All I\u0027d have to look forward to would be the shattered knees and torture. It isn\u0027t worth it. My number\u0027s up. \u0027Get on with it,\u0027 I growl, and let them drag me to my feet.\\n\\n While Gardiner retreats, measuring his paces as if fighting a duel, Dash studies me. \u0027This isn\u0027t what I wanted, Brad. You forced my hand. I couldn\u0027t let you - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go fuck yourself,\u0027 I cut in brusquely.\\n\\n Dash frowns. \u0027Anyone ever mention that chip on your shoulder?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m ready,\u0027 Gardiner says. He\u0027s standing sideways to us, right arm levelled in front of him, left arm bent slightly behind his back.\\n\\n \u0027So long,\u0027 Dash says, patting my cheek. \u0027It was fun while it lasted. I\u0027ll give your love to Antonia. Give mine to the ghosts.\u0027\\n\\n He steps away. He hasn\u0027t taken more than two strides when Bond Gardiner fires. My eyes snap shut and my stomach goes cold. I wait for the pain, but there isn\u0027t any. I don\u0027t dare hope he\u0027s missed, so I assume my nerve endings are slow to react. But then someone groans and it isn\u0027t me.\\n\\n Opening my eyes, I spot Sebastian Dash lying on the ground in a pool of blood, his stomach ripped open, gazing crookedly at the mess bulging out of the shredded gap with a look of agonized confusion. \u0027What the fuck?\u0027 he gasps, sticking a couple of fingers into the cavity to make sure it\u0027s real.\\n\\n Gardiner advances, never lowering his arm, ready to fire again if Dash goes for his gun. I stand rooted, as stunned as Dash. The assassin looks up. His eyes are wide, appealing for answers. \u0027You shot me. I think I\u0027m - \u0027\\n\\n A torrent of blood gushes up his throat and out of his mouth. Gardiner steps back quickly to avoid getting his shoes splashed. Dash seems to snap back to life at that, and scrabbles for his gun. He prizes it free of its holster, but his fingers are slow, and wet with blood. He doesn\u0027t stand a chance.\\n\\n Gardiner puts two more bullets through Dash\u0027s ribcage. The gun drops limply from the assassin\u0027s hand and he sinks into the grass, face white, body shuddering. He\u0027s suffering a more painful death than Langbein. I can\u0027t say I\u0027m sorry, though I don\u0027t exactly rejoice, knowing that a similar fate is surely in store for me.\\n\\n Dash tries to staunch the flow of blood, but even in his distressed state he knows it\u0027s a hopeless task. Giving up, he lets his head flop back and stares at the sky. An almost serene look passes over his face as he whispers, \u0027Antonia.\u0027\\n\\n Then he\u0027s dead, and it\u0027s my turn.\\n\\n Bond Gardiner casts a cold eye over me.\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 I ask quietly.\\n\\n The gangster\u0027s head cocks to the left. \u0027I had to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n He wipes the gun clean, strides across the glade and sticks it in Langbein\u0027s hand, then he pats down the officer and finds a Swiss army knife. He extends the longest blade and steps up behind me. I tense, expecting him to slit my throat, but instead he sets to work on the ropes. Within seconds I\u0027m free, my extremities tingling as blood flows back into them.\\n\\n \u0027If I hadn\u0027t killed Dash,\u0027 Gardiner says, snapping the knife shut and pocketing it, \u0027I\u0027d have had to kill you. And I didn\u0027t want to do that.\u0027\\n\\n I limp forward, rubbing my hands together, half afraid I\u0027m dreaming. \u0027You\u0027re going to spare me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not going to,\u0027 he corrects me. \u0027I have spared you. You\u0027re free. Get the fuck out of here before I change my mind.\u0027\\n\\n In a daze I start away, thinking he\u0027ll grab Dash\u0027s gun and shoot me in the back. When I reach the edge of the clearing and he still hasn\u0027t fired, I stop and slowly, against my better instincts, turn. My ghosts are howling silently, spitefully. If they could give voice to their fury, they\u0027d probably be screaming, \u0027Not fair!\u0027 I ignore them and study Bond Gardiner. He\u0027s standing over Dash\u0027s body, staring down with an unreadable expression.\\n\\n I return and take up a position to Gardiner\u0027s left. He doesn\u0027t notice me at first. When he does, his features darken. \u0027I told you to go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t, not until you tell me what\u0027s going on.\u0027\\n\\n He sighs, then nods sombrely. He turns away from Sebastian Dash and moves to the far side of the car, where he doesn\u0027t have to look at the corpses. I follow, lean against the hood of the engine next to him, and wait while he produces a book of matches and starts playing with it, the way he did in the pub. \u0027You really believe it was Andeanna\u0027s ghost you fell in love with?\u0027 he asks.\\n\\n \u0027I know that it was.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You accepted everything she told you through the mystic?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a fool,\u0027 he grunts. \u0027When you killed that bodyguard, Andeanna told you he was Axel Nelke?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then, at the seance, she said through the medium that Nelke was her lover from long ago and she didn\u0027t actually know the name of the bodyguard?\u0027 When I nod, Gardiner snorts. \u0027After you butchered the guy in the mansion, did you frisk him for ID, or did you simply leave his cards in his wallet and bury them at sea with him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course not. I went through his pockets and took . . . \u0027\\n\\n I stop, horrified. I\u0027d forgotten about the cards, but I can visualize them now that Gardiner has reminded me. Credit cards, a driver\u0027s licence, a membership card for Blockbuster. I only flicked through them, but I got a good look at the name, the same on every card. Axel Nelke.\\n\\n Gardiner chuckles as the penny - one of the pennies - drops. \u0027The guard you killed was Axel Nelke. He was one of my boys.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Andeanna . . . her lover . . . she said . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027She lied.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. There must have been another Axel Nelke, this guy\u0027s father or uncle or - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t insult yourself,\u0027 Gardiner snaps. \u0027She played you. She knew who he was. My guess is she lured him there on purpose. I think he was a guinea pig. She wanted to see if you still had a killer\u0027s touch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re lying. You want to torment me. You\u0027re saying this to . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Gardiner jeers.\\n\\n \u0027 . . . confuse me,\u0027 I finish lamely.\\n\\n \u0027Why should I?\u0027 he retorts.\\n\\n \u0027To throw me off the scent. To stop me . . . \u0027 I run out of ideas.\\n\\n \u0027If I wanted to stop you, I\u0027d have killed you. Even a lovesick lunatic like you must be able to see that. Right now, I\u0027m the one person in the world you can trust, because I in no way stand to benefit from lying to you.\u0027\\n\\n He\u0027s telling the truth. It would be easier if he wasn\u0027t, if this was part of some scam to sidetrack me, but it would have been far more straightforward for him to shoot me than set me free and lie to me. The guard was Axel Nelke. Andeanna lied about him.\\n\\n What else wasn\u0027t true?\\n\\n \u0027Did the Turk kill her?\u0027 I croak. Gardiner doesn\u0027t answer. He seems focused on the matches. \u0027Did he!\u0027 I shout.\\n\\n \u0027Do you have an address for Etienne Anders?\u0027 he asks.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I reply, befuddled.\\n\\n \u0027I want it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What does she have to do with - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were set up!\u0027 he barks. \u0027There was no ghost. I doubt if Anders was behind the scam, but she\u0027s part of it. If I find her, I might be able to wring the truth out of the bitch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Anders was only a channeller. Andeanna spoke through her.\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner slaps me. When I stare at him numbly, he slaps me again, then grabs my neck and pulls my face in close to his. \u0027Can\u0027t you get it straight, you fucking moron? There. Was. No. Ghost. It was a con job. Someone dressed up as Andeanna and tricked you into killing Mikis, then hired a clever psychic to make you believe she was a spirit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I moan, pulling away. The matches drop. He bends to pick them up. I use the few seconds to think of something to prove I\u0027m not a patsy. \u0027Greygo,\u0027 I gasp. \u0027He saw the ghost too. He\u0027d been to see Anders as well.\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner\u0027s expression softens. \u0027Poor Greygo. He was so anxious to learn about her, always asking questions, wanting to know. He must have been an easy mark.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner plucks loose a match, lights it, watches the flame flicker down, then blows it out. \u0027Greygo has an active imagination,\u0027 he says through the thin stream of smoke. \u0027Mikis used to say he was away with the fairies. Whoever manipulated you got to Greygo beforehand. I don\u0027t know how they did it, but if they fooled someone like you, it can\u0027t have been that hard to mesmerize a mixed-up kid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. You\u0027re wrong.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Think about it, Brad. Greygo went - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ed,\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027My name\u0027s Ed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whatever. Greygo went to lots of mediums. He missed his mother, and nothing we told him about her was enough. He always wanted more. Of all those psychics, only one could put him in touch with his mother? Only one could succeed where the others failed?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Logic doesn\u0027t work with ghosts. Sometimes shades can only speak through - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can it,\u0027 he snaps. \u0027You were conned. So was Greygo. If you can\u0027t see that, you\u0027re dumber than I thought, and maybe I should finish you off and leave you here with those two.\u0027 He jerks an angry thumb at the corpses behind us.\\n\\n \u0027Why haven\u0027t you killed me?\u0027 I ask, curious in spite of everything.\\n\\n \u0027Too complicated. The police won\u0027t believe that Langbein and Dash wiped each other out, but they\u0027ll accept it because they\u0027ll be glad to be rid of the pair. But if I throw in a third body, they won\u0027t be able to explain it away, so they\u0027ll have to investigate for real.\u0027\\n\\n I think about that, then shake my head. \u0027I don\u0027t buy it. You could have dumped me in the trunk and killed me elsewhere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Now you tell me,\u0027 he chuckles, pretending to groan, hoping I\u0027ll drop it.\\n\\n \u0027Why spare me?\u0027 I press. \u0027Why tell me about Nelke? I\u0027ve admitted to killing the Turk. Why aren\u0027t you carving your revenge out of my flesh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because you weren\u0027t to blame. You were a tool in some cunning fucker\u0027s hand. When I find him, I\u0027ll do plenty of carving, but I don\u0027t shoot messenger boys.\u0027\\n\\n It\u0027s a plausible excuse. Another time I might believe him. But Gardiner has been visibly shaken, and I can see through him as clearly as I can see Sebastian Dash\u0027s bloody remains through the windows of the car.\\n\\n \u0027The truth, Bond,\u0027 I say softly. \u0027Let\u0027s not bother with lies any more. There\u0027s no place for them here. Tell me why you spared me.\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner stares at the matches, runs a finger over them, speaks without looking up. \u0027Because I took pity on you.\u0027\\n\\n I almost laugh. It\u0027s his most pathetic lie yet. I open my mouth to berate him, then close it slowly, not having said a word. Because it isn\u0027t a lie.\\n\\n \u0027Why, for God\u0027s sake?\u0027 I mutter.\\n\\n \u0027Not for God\u0027s sake,\u0027 he says. \u0027For Andeanna\u0027s.\u0027 He lifts his head, and his eyes are hard but soft at the same time. \u0027You shocked me in the pub when you turned up with talk of Andeanna having a lover. Since you knew so much, I fed you a half-true story, hoping that would satisfy you. If I\u0027d known who you really were . . . \u0027 He steels himself and says, \u0027Andeanna had a lover, but Mikis never knew.\u0027\\n\\n My eyes narrow. As bewildered as I am, I understand what Gardiner is saying. \u0027It was you,\u0027 I whisper.\\n\\n He nods with ferocious sharpness. \u0027That\u0027s why you\u0027re alive. Because I see the love I felt for her mirrored in your eyes. And although it wasn\u0027t the real Andeanna you fell in love with, you thought it was and you were prepared to sacrifice everything for her. I respect that. You killed Mikis and Axel, so I shouldn\u0027t, but I can\u0027t help myself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Christ,\u0027 I groan. \u0027Mary fucking Mother of God.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t blaspheme,\u0027 he scolds me.\\n\\n \u0027It was all bullshit,\u0027 I mumble. \u0027The Turk didn\u0027t know about her affair.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He didn\u0027t kill her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought . . . even when I was convinced that she wasn\u0027t a ghost, when I assumed I\u0027d been set up . . . I thought only a vengeful lover or relative would go to such twisted lengths to kill a man.\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner grunts. \u0027I was closer to Mikis than anyone else on this shitball of a planet. Even if he\u0027d murdered Andeanna, I couldn\u0027t have retaliated. I could have hated him, but I couldn\u0027t have killed him or allowed someone else to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is crazy. Why would she lie to me? What does a ghost stand to gain by lying?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For fuck\u0027s sake!\u0027 Gardiner roars. \u0027When will you get it through your thick fucking skull? She wasn\u0027t a ghost. You were conned.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I disagree. \u0027You weren\u0027t there. You didn\u0027t hear the way Anders spoke, the way her face changed shape to become Andeanna\u0027s. It wasn\u0027t a charade. It was really her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You never met the real Andeanna!\u0027 he howls. \u0027Don\u0027t you get it? The woman who seduced you was an impostor. You have no idea how Andeanna talked or how her lips lifted when she was happy or how her nose twitched when she was mad. You know nothing about her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re wrong,\u0027 I defy him. \u0027It was Andeanna. She knew too much not to be. She had access to the mansion. She was there when I killed Nelke and the Turk. She knew about the affair and the story you told me about her husband killing her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anders could have learnt most of that from Greygo,\u0027 he says.\\n\\n \u0027Did Greygo know about the affair?\u0027 I challenge him.\\n\\n \u0027Well, no, I don\u0027t think so, but - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027But nothing. The ghost knew that Andeanna had been unfaithful. She didn\u0027t reveal her lover\u0027s real name, but that\u0027s because she wanted to protect you, like you\u0027d protected her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he growls. \u0027She wasn\u0027t a ghost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She was!\u0027 I yell, going face to face with him. He\u0027s a head taller and outweighs me by thirty pounds, but I don\u0027t care. I could take on the devil himself, the mood I\u0027m in. \u0027Stop denying it. It doesn\u0027t make sense any other way. She was a ghost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An impostor,\u0027 he mumbles, taking a step backwards.\\n\\n \u0027A ghost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Impossible.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 I follow him as he retreats. \u0027Why are you so set against the idea? Because you don\u0027t believe in ghosts?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then what?\u0027 He doesn\u0027t answer. \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n Gardiner stops backpedalling and lets me run into him. \u0027It can\u0027t have been a ghost,\u0027 he says flatly, then puts his lips to my ear and hits me with a thunderbolt that sets me adrift once again on the seas of bewildered madness. \u0027It can\u0027t have been a ghost because Andeanna isn\u0027t dead.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-20.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
