{"id":108114,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Deleena refuses to give me her phone number - she never gives it out to people she\u0027s just met, even if they are \u0027fabulously wonderful writers\u0027 - but she takes mine and promises to call sometime soon. I don\u0027t get to sleep until nearly three in the morning, thinking about her, replaying our conversation inside my head.\\n\\n A ringing phone startles me. The ghost of the girl is in my face when I jerk awake, hissing silently at me. I ignore her and glance quickly at my watch - I\u0027ve been asleep less than half an hour. Sitting up, I grab my cell, shake the worst of the wooziness from my head and answer.\\n\\n \u0027Did I wake you?\u0027 Deleena asks.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I yawn.\\n\\n \u0027I can call later if you\u0027d like.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I say quickly. \u0027Don\u0027t hang up.\u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s a long pause. Finally Deleena says, \u0027I had a good time tonight.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hope I didn\u0027t come across like a groupie. It was only when I got home that I realized how many questions I\u0027d asked about your books. I wanted to ring and say sorry. I was hoping to catch you before you went to bed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Please,\u0027 I chuckle. \u0027You don\u0027t have to apologize for fawning over me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have said I was fawning,\u0027 she mutters.\\n\\n \u0027Well you were,\u0027 I smirk.\\n\\n Running a hand through my hair, I discover a long piece of purple paper stuck to my scalp. Peeling it off, I ask Deleena if she\u0027d like to meet for breakfast or lunch.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t. I start work early, and I only get to do lunch if it\u0027s with a client. Every other day I\u0027m stuck at my desk till closing time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought you said you worked regular hours.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Regularly long,\u0027 she laughs. \u0027How about meeting up around eight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Great. Where?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The National Film Theatre? They\u0027re showing a season of eighties horror features. I think Killer Party is playing tonight. I know you love slasher flicks, so I thought we could - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027What gave you that idea?\u0027 I interrupt, then recall that Summer\u0027s Shades features a protagonist who is hooked on gory films.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t like horror?\u0027 Deleena asks, taken aback.\\n\\n \u0027Not really, apart from the classics like The Omen, Hellraiser, The Exorcist.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Summer\u0027s Shades . . . ?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My characters aren\u0027t me, Deleena.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it\u0027s so convincing. Shades reads like it was written by somebody truly in love with the genre.\u0027\\n\\n I laugh. \u0027Trust me, it wasn\u0027t!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You aren\u0027t a horror buff?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uh-uh.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank heaven for that,\u0027 she sighs. \u0027I can\u0027t stand horror films. I love to read nasty stuff but I can\u0027t bear to watch it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You only suggested the film to keep me happy?\u0027 I ask cockily.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t crow,\u0027 she warns. \u0027You don\u0027t know my phone number. If I disconnect and don\u0027t call back, you\u0027ll be trotting around London on your tod.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s a tod?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t change the subject,\u0027 she snaps.\\n\\n \u0027OK. Horror films are out. What does that leave?\u0027\\n\\n She hesitates. \u0027A meal?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anywhere particular?\u0027 She mentions a small restaurant in the West End. I agree to that, then ask, \u0027And after?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s wait and see,\u0027 she responds. \u0027Maybe I\u0027ll have had enough of you and will want to go home early.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Or maybe you\u0027ll want to take me home with you,\u0027 I whisper cheekily.\\n\\n A pause. It lengthens. Just when I\u0027m about to ask if she\u0027s still there, she whispers back, \u0027Maybe.\u0027 And hangs up.\\n\\n The next two nights are delicious. We dine by candlelight in snug restaurants, chatting easily, laughing freely. I\u0027m at ease around her, even more so than I am with Joe. I feel like a different, less complicated and reserved person.\\n\\n Later we go for slow walks around Piccadilly Circus, bustling with young, loud tourists as it always is, no matter what time of the day you visit. The Mall, the wide road running along St James\u0027s Park, quiet at night, peaceful, Buck Palace glittering at the end of it like a fairy princess\u0027s palace. Through the lovingly maintained expanse of Hyde Park and down by the casually meandering Thames, the green heart and dark blue soul of this grand old dame of a city.\\n\\n Sometimes we stroll hand in hand, other times with our arms around each other. We talk softly about our past and future, hopes and dreams, disappointments and failures. I don\u0027t tell her everything about myself, but I spill more than I have to anyone else recently. Details from my youth, my difficult teens in Detroit, how my parents died (mother of cancer when I was sixteen, father of what I hope was an accidental overdose two years later), some of my marital woes, how few friends I have, what a quiet guy I am.\\n\\n She works my past out of me effortlessly, charmingly. And I do the same with her, learning of her equally difficult teenage years, the time she spent in rehab, her fractured relationship with her parents, the way she retreated from the world after she split from her husband.\\n\\n For all our talking and sharing, we don\u0027t kiss. At the end of each night I expect her to offer her lips, but she doesn\u0027t. A quick peck on the cheek and that\u0027s it, she hops into a cab and slips away. I\u0027m confused but pleased - it\u0027s nice to be on the slow burn. I\u0027m sure there will be kissing and more later, but for the time being I\u0027m content to talk and walk, getting to know her, letting her get to know me.\\n\\n Joe returns to London. We meet at a cafe in Soho in the early afternoon. We order drinks and sit outside, baking in the severe July sun. Joe looks tired and drawn. His mother pulled through but the doctor told him it\u0027s only a matter of weeks before she succumbs to a fatal stroke.\\n\\n \u0027I knew she was close to the end,\u0027 he says, wrapped up tightly even though everybody else is in shorts and T-shirts, \u0027but to have it confirmed . . . to be taken aside and told . . . \u0027 He shakes his head. The glass trembles in his hand.\\n\\n \u0027You should have stayed with her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he says, tugging miserably at his beard. \u0027Two of my sisters have moved in with her and I\u0027ve got a brother three doors down. I\u0027d be in the way. I might miss the finale, but that\u0027s not such a bad thing. I\u0027m not sure I want to see her when . . . when she . . . \u0027 He comes to a halt. I glance down at the plastic table, ashamed to think of how great a time I\u0027ve been having while Joe\u0027s been up north preparing for death. \u0027My brother told me a good one,\u0027 Joe mutters, managing a thin smile.\\n\\n I groan. Joe loves terrible jokes. I almost tell him not to bother me, but I know he wants to distract himself from thoughts of his mother. \u0027Go on,\u0027 I growl.\\n\\n \u0027Sunday. Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday.\u0027 He pauses, then sighs wistfully. \u0027Those were the days.\u0027\\n\\n I chuckle despite myself. \u0027That\u0027s one of your worst ever.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why are you laughing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Damned if I know.\u0027\\n\\n We grin at one another, Joe managing to put the darkness of the last few days behind him for the time being.\\n\\n \u0027So what have you been up to?\u0027 he asks.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing much,\u0027 I lie.\\n\\n \u0027No developments on the plot front?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To be honest, I haven\u0027t paid a lot of attention to the book. I was waiting for you to return.\u0027 He perks up when he hears that. \u0027Also, I\u0027ve been seeing someone.\u0027 He waits for me to elaborate. \u0027A woman.\u0027\\n\\n He laughs. \u0027I didn\u0027t think it was a man.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I met her at the boat party.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shar\u0027s?\u0027 he interjects excitedly. \u0027You went?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you pulled?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Artful bastard,\u0027 he snorts, looking more like his old self. \u0027Didn\u0027t take you long to muscle in on the action. What\u0027s her name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Deleena Emerson. She works for a private bank in the City.\u0027\\n\\n I tell him a bit about Deleena, our nights together, how she looks in a black dress, a few morsels about her background. Joe smirks like a shark as I describe her long legs, soft hair and sparkling eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Tasty,\u0027 he purrs. \u0027Does she have a sister?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s an only child.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pity.\u0027 He taps the table admonishingly. \u0027But I\u0027m not impressed with the way you\u0027ve let it affect your work. I\u0027m all for romance, but it shouldn\u0027t interfere with your writing. What happened to your meeting with John Meyher? Did you go?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I postponed it in the end. I wanted you be there, given that you were the one who set it up. He said his diary was open and to simply give him a few hours\u0027 notice before dropping by.\u0027\\n\\n Joe wags a finger at me. \u0027Can\u0027t leave you alone for a minute,\u0027 he scolds, then digs out his cell phone and slides it across the table. \u0027Try and arrange something for this afternoon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you\u0027re tired, Joe. Let\u0027s wait until - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027No waiting,\u0027 he insists. \u0027When I return to work I\u0027ll be stuck in that bloody shop for most of the week, repairing toasters and microwave ovens. I\u0027ve got an excuse not to go in today - I\u0027m still on leave - but if we don\u0027t go and see him now, I\u0027ll be too busy to come.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK.\u0027 I pick up the phone and dial.\\n\\n \u0027You know the number off by heart?\u0027 Joe asks.\\n\\n \u0027I have an almost perfect memory for numbers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a man of hidden depths,\u0027 he grins.\\n\\n \u0027You have no idea,\u0027 I mutter.\\n\\n Meyher\u0027s wife answers and says that her husband\u0027s out but will be back in the afternoon. I check their address with her - numbers stick in my brain but nothing else - and schedule the meeting for four o\u0027clock.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re on?\u0027 Joe asks as I hand back his cell.\\n\\n \u0027Four.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excellent.\u0027 He drinks up and accompanies me to my hotel, where he steals a nap on the couch while I wash and dress. He\u0027s exhausted. I know how he feels. When my mother was dying, I rarely squeezed in more than a few hours of sleep a night. I\u0027d like to leave him slumbering but he\u0027d hate me if I went without him, so I shake him awake, ply him with coffee, then off we set in a cab hailed by the redoubtable Mr Lloyd.\\n\\n John Meyher lives in Roehampton, a quiet, nicely maintained suburb in south-west London, very different to the city I\u0027ve been getting to know, with more of a small-town feel. The air is actually halfway breathable out here. I like it. If I was to live in London, I\u0027d choose somewhere like this.\\n\\n John is pruning in a small garden in front of his house when we arrive. He\u0027s a large man, heavy and tall, thinning grey hair. He welcomes us with a warm smile and takes us inside for the obligatory British cup of tea and a lot of talk about spontaneous human combustion. John\u0027s an expert. He doesn\u0027t give many interviews. Like most SHC theorists, he\u0027s had to deal with ridicule and official denial over the years. He says it\u0027s worn him down. But when he sees how eager we are to learn, he comes alive and talks quickly and eagerly.\\n\\n After a brief history lesson and a swift but comprehensive overview of current trains of thought, John shows us photos of SHC victims, large piles of ash sitting on floors in the middle of kitchens, bedrooms or living rooms. In some a stray hand or foot rests nearby, as if sliced off prior to burning. A pipe lies in the middle of one pile, tobacco spilling out of it on to the human remains.\\n\\n John points out the surrounding areas, drawing our attention to the fact that although some of the walls and floors are spotted with soot, the floorboards aren\u0027t burnt through and the furniture stands unharmed.\\n\\n \u0027Do you know the kind of heat required to reduce a human body to ash?\u0027 he asks. \u0027It\u0027s in excess of nine hundred degrees Celsius. In a crematorium they use giant furnaces and pumps to generate the heat. Assuming you could start a fire that intense in an ordinary house, how could it incinerate a living human and do no other damage to the room in which they died?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do officials explain it?\u0027 I ask.\\n\\n \u0027They don\u0027t,\u0027 John snorts. \u0027They just ignore it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you?\u0027 I press. \u0027What do you think happens?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They burn from within. Even scientists opposed to the concept of SHC accept that possibility. Internal gases can build up and ignite. But an explosion like that should hurl shreds of the victim about, not just leave the odd cleanly amputated hand or foot. It\u0027s like these people generated a pillar of fire that spread from the centre outwards, and the only bits to survive were the limbs outside the pillar\u0027s circumference. I don\u0027t know how that can happen. Nobody does. It defies all known physical laws.\u0027\\n\\n I gaze at a photograph where a hand lies next to a mound of ashes. I think about what John has told us. I put it together with what I already had in mind coming into this meeting. And I start to smile.\\n\\n After our interview with John, we head to a pub - the Minotaur - and I down a couple of glasses of rum, my tipple of choice. Wine with a meal, beer if I fancy a casual drink, rum when I want to enjoy my liquor. I\u0027m buzzing. John was the last significant link in the chain. With what he told me, I\u0027ll soon be ready to write.\\n\\n Joe waits for me to explain myself. I catch his eye and grin, lifting my third glass of rum in salute. Joe scowls, half amused, half annoyed.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 I chuckle. \u0027I know I\u0027m acting like an ass, but this ties everything together. I\u0027ve been picking away at the strands of this story for a year, and today it finally fell fully formed into my lap. I don\u0027t have all the twists and turns worked out yet, but the core is there.\u0027\\n\\n Joe leans forward. \u0027Can you tell me, or is it still a secret?\u0027\\n\\n I stare at my hands and collect my thoughts. \u0027Remember Pierre Vallance telling us how he can convert mental waves into voices?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If that\u0027s true, and if you could convert the waves into images or objects, it would mean reality is subjective. Some people would have the power to change the world with their thoughts - as an example, if one of them imagined a unicorn or an alien, they could bring it into being.\u0027\\n\\n Joe tugs at his beard. \u0027You think?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not? If reality can be physically what we make of it, then someone like Vallance - but more powerful - could play God. Now, let\u0027s say a guy with that power drops a match. He panics and imagines himself going up in flames. Only, due to his ability to reshape reality, he doesn\u0027t just imagine himself catching fire, he unwittingly makes it - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Actually happen,\u0027 Joe interrupts.\\n\\n \u0027You got it. And because he\u0027s panicking, the flames don\u0027t act the natural way - they do what his fevered imagination tells them to do and burn through him like a pillar of unbelievably hot fire.\u0027\\n\\n I sit back, more pieces of the novel clicking together as I speak. \u0027If a person is unaware of their power and accidentally taps into it and burns to death, that\u0027s a tragedy. But if someone is aware of what they can do, and uses their talent to target other people . . . Hell, that\u0027s murder, prime material for an Ed Sieveking novel.\u0027 I raise my glass, finish off the last of my rum, then tell Joe to drink up. \u0027We can\u0027t sit around boozing all day. We\u0027ve got a book to write!\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-4.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
