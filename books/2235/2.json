{"id":108112,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"PART ONE Chapter One I wake abruptly from a troubled sleep to find the dead pressing in tightly around me. Half a dozen phantoms, teeth bared, snarling mutely, scratching at my face with their insubstantial fingernails. I stifle a scream and bury my face in a pillow, waiting for the last vestiges of the nightmare to pass. My heart is pounding and I don\u0027t move until it\u0027s back to normal. When I\u0027m in control, I push myself up and stare blankly at the six ghosts. They\u0027ve withdrawn now that I\u0027m awake and are simply glaring at me sullenly, the way they do most of the time. They only try to get under my skin when they think I\u0027m ripe for the freaking, choosing their moments with studious care, for maximum impact. Usually they strike on nights like this, when they see me whimpering and fidgeting in my sleep, when they know from experience that I\u0027ll more than likely bolt awake, disorientated and temporarily vulnerable. They can\u0027t physically assault me, or they would have ripped me apart years ago. They have to settle for mind games, and they\u0027re good at those. They should be. They\u0027ve had lots of practice. I get up and shower. The ghosts follow me into the bathroom, passing through the walls as if the blocks were made of mist. I ignore them as I turn the water on cold and shiver in its bite. I\u0027m adept at ignoring them. It\u0027s only when they occasionally catch me by surprise that they set my nerves jangling. Not like in the early days, when I was sure they were going to drive me mad. We\u0027ve fought a battle of the wills, the dead and I, and I\u0027ve won out. So far anyway. Though I suspect they\u0027ve got the rest of my life to chip away at me. And, if they\u0027re not just figments of my imagination, then maybe far beyond. I\u0027m in a foul mood. I wasn\u0027t able to get back to sleep, so the day dragged. I kept as busy as I could, walking the streets of London, researching, writing up notes. But I couldn\u0027t make time pass any faster or rid myself of the headache I often get after an interrupted night\u0027s sleep. I tried to avoid people, knowing what I\u0027m like in this frame of mind, apt to snap at the slightest irritation. As night fell, I thought about postponing my meeting with Joe. We were due to case a house in Kilburn, in north London. Joe wouldn\u0027t have cared if I\u0027d pushed it back. But that would have afforded the ghosts a minor victory, and they all add up. When you\u0027re fighting for your sanity, you can\u0027t cede even an inch of turf. Every slight setback empowers your foes, and there\u0027s no telling how little it might take to tip the scales. It\u0027s shortly after eleven p.m. on July 2nd. Joe and I have been camped out in the abandoned house for the past couple of hours, waiting for its alleged spectral inhabitant to make an appearance. Joe sensed my dark mood and has kept small talk to a minimum. I\u0027ve cheered up over the course of our watch. It\u0027s times like this, when I\u0027m immersing myself in the murky world of the dead, that I feel most at ease with my own situation. I\u0027m a man in search of answers, and I find a certain measure of relief and peace of mind when I\u0027m focused on my ghostly research. Joe\u0027s gone upstairs to the toilet. It doesn\u0027t work - no water in the cistern - but he\u0027s too polite to piss against a wall. I have no such qualms. Even if I had, I\u0027d rather risk my dignity than my life on those rickety stairs. I hope Joe doesn\u0027t expect me to haul him out of the rubble if he crashes through the planks. I don\u0027t risk my life for anyone. The stairs creak. I slide into the corridor to watch Joe make his descent. He\u0027s less optimistic coming down than he was going up. Keeps to the edges and tests each step several times before easing his weight on to it. The sight brightens my mood another few notches. \u0027You should hop over the banister,\u0027 I smirk. \u0027And plunge through the floor?\u0027 he snorts. \u0027No thanks. I\u0027ll take my chances on the stairs.\u0027 Joe\u0027s from northern England and has a thick accent. I had difficulty understanding him when we first met, but it\u0027s been four days now and my ear has adjusted. I even find myself unconsciously mimicking him sometimes. Joe makes it back safely and lets out a grateful breath, as if he\u0027d returned from a bombing raid on Berlin. \u0027I could murder a cup of tea,\u0027 he mutters. \u0027Then you\u0027d need to piss again.\u0027 He nods glumly. \u0027We should hire a Portaloo.\u0027 \u0027Or you could just piss against the wall.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m a Geordie,\u0027 Joe sniffs. \u0027We\u0027re more civilized than that.\u0027 We return to the drawing room. I used to think such rooms were so named because people drew in them. Joe put me right. It\u0027s short for \u0027withdrawing\u0027. Goes back to the time when men and women used to withdraw from the dining room to spend the night talking, reading and praying for the invention of television. \u0027Any action?\u0027 Joe asks, sensing the change in the air, feeling free to chat now that I\u0027m not scowling like Rasputin. I try my best Geordie. \u0027Norra bit\u0027ve it.\u0027 Joe winces. \u0027Do that again and I\u0027m off.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t think I could pass for a native?\u0027 \u0027In Australia, perhaps.\u0027 We settle down in a pair of busted chairs to wait for the ghost. The chairs had been dumped in the yard out back. We dragged them in during our first night on watch, when we grew tired of standing. We\u0027ve spent the last three nights waiting for the ghost to show. (My first night in London was devoted to a traditional pub crawl, which wasn\u0027t as rowdy as it sounds, since Joe only drinks non-alcoholic beer and I rarely allow myself more than four pints.) The restless spirit is meant to put in regular appearances - once or twice a week, according to the lady who owns the place - but so far it\u0027s been elusive. I\u0027m a writer. All of my books have been about ghosts. It\u0027s not because I can\u0027t think of anything else to write about, or because I have scores of fans hungering for my next supernatural tome. Each book has approached the nature of poltergeists in a different way. Each has been an attempt to explain how ghosts can exist. Or, more accurately, how my ghosts exist. I\u0027m not stupid. I know they\u0027re probably the workings of a deluded mind. I accept that I\u0027m most likely hovering over the abyss of an insane pit, and that the spirits are nothing more than the projections of a deeply troubled psyche. But I don\u0027t want to be crazy. I refuse to accept that I\u0027m a loon. I want to fight this thing and find my way back to normality. Most people would seek psychiatric help, but that\u0027s not an option in my case. So I\u0027ve gone a different route. I\u0027m trying to prove that ghosts are real. If I can do that, I can hopefully come to terms with my own retinue, maybe even find a way to banish them. The ghosts terrified me when they first began to appear. My world turned on its head. I had screaming fits. I sought escape through alcohol and drugs, but the ghosts followed me everywhere. I almost blew my brains out, just to get away from them. I\u0027m sure I would have, except that one night, in the middle of my mental anguish, I had the (probably crazy) idea that I might not be imagining the shades, that they might be real. That slim possibility gave me the strength to pull body and soul together, and my life since then has been a quest to prove to myself that we live in a world of wonders. When I first started looking for proof, I read lots of ghost stories, hoping to find something that might set me on the path of true understanding. I found myself having ideas for stories of my own, based on what I had read and my experiences in the field. Having a lot of dead time to fill (pun intended), I began tinkering with the ideas, fleshing them out. The writing helped me blank out the ghosts. It served as an anchor to reality, gave me the sense that I was doing something meaningful, let me believe I wasn\u0027t the raving lunatic that I fear I am. Short stories led to longer stories, then a rough draft of a novel. Out of curiosity, I submitted samples of my work to a few agents, to see what they\u0027d make of my ghostly ramblings. To my surprise, a couple reacted positively and I signed with one of them. Thus Edward Sieveking the author was born, though I wasn\u0027t known as that back then. Joe is one of my more avid fans. He\u0027s read all three of my books several times and remembers more about them than I do. In the pub that first night, he was talking about characters and events that I only dimly recalled. It\u0027s been six years since my first book saw print. I throw myself completely into a novel while I\u0027m working on it, but when it fails to produce any answers to the riddles that plague me, I publish it, put it behind me and move on. Joe thought that writers carried each and every book around with them for life. He doesn\u0027t understand how I can spend two or three years working on a story, then forget about the finer details overnight. He\u0027s a bit disappointed. I\u0027ll have to look through my old notes when I get home and email him a few background scraps and discarded plot lines, restore his faith in me. \u0027It\u0027s freezing,\u0027 Joe says, breathing warm air down the neck of his jumper. \u0027I noticed.\u0027 It shouldn\u0027t be. It\u0027s a balmy night outside. \u0027Maybe the ghost\u0027s coming. The temperature drops before an appearance, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Sometimes,\u0027 I nod. \u0027I was in a room once where it plunged twenty degrees in the space of a minute.\u0027 \u0027Did a ghost appear?\u0027 He\u0027s smiling. He\u0027s never seen a ghost. Doesn\u0027t really believe that we\u0027re going to find anything here. \u0027I don\u0027t know. I had to leave. It got too cold.\u0027 Joe rubs his hands together. He\u0027s wearing a chunky grey jumper and a duffel coat, but is shivering worse than me, even though I\u0027m only clad in a light shirt. I wouldn\u0027t have thought that someone with Joe\u0027s physique would feel the chill. He\u0027s as muscular as a wrestler. He looks odd, actually, because he\u0027s not a big man, with small hands and a neat, oval face. He notices me studying him and grins shakily. \u0027Old wounds,\u0027 he explains. \u0027They play up in the cold. You should see me in winter - if I leave the house in less than three jumpers and two pairs of jeans, I have to be thawed out by an open fire.\u0027 I smile sympathetically. Joe told me about his injuries a couple of days ago, when I asked why he was walking around in the middle of a heatwave fully dressed from neck to ankle. His mother grew up in Northern Ireland and they used to go back on regular visits. One day they were out shopping. There was an explosion. Joe was caught in the blast. He nearly died. Doctors patched up the worst of the damage, but his body is a mass of scars and broken skin. He never exposes his flesh in public, ashamed of how he looks. That\u0027s why he grew a thick beard - his lower face is scarred too. \u0027We can leave if you like,\u0027 I offer. Joe shakes his head. \u0027And miss my big moment? Not bloody likely.\u0027 Joe is intent on making this book work. He\u0027s thrilled at the thought of contributing to one of my novels. He\u0027s determined to assist me in every way possible. He\u0027d probably pump money into the venture if I let him. \u0027We could bring in an electric fire,\u0027 I suggest. \u0027No good. The ghost shies away from electrics.\u0027 That\u0027s what the owner of the house told us. It\u0027s why we\u0027re sitting by candlelight. Ghosts are shy creatures, loath to reveal themselves. I know from previous studies that they often choose the most inopportune moments to appear, when you\u0027re fiddling with your camera or pointing it in another direction. Sceptics mock such failures, but they don\u0027t realize how canny the spirits can be. Canny. I\u0027ve picked that up from Joe. The new book is set in London. I need to get to grips with the way the locals speak. I\u0027ll have to make sure I mix with some genuine Cockneys though - if Joe\u0027s my only reference, I won\u0027t know if I\u0027m using southern or northern terminology. \u0027You still haven\u0027t told me what the story\u0027s about,\u0027 Joe comments. \u0027I\u0027m not sure yet,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027I know some of what I want, but there are still large gaps to be filled in.\u0027 \u0027But you\u0027re going with the SHC angle, right?\u0027 \u0027I kind of have to, to keep you happy, don\u0027t I?\u0027 I chuckle. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter a damn to me,\u0027 Joe says. \u0027Honestly.\u0027 Joe was the one who got me interested in spontaneous human combustion. He\u0027d read a lot about it and mentioned SHC a few times in emails, told me how scientists were unable to explain how it happened, discussed a few of the differing theories with me. Intrigued, I started to do some research of my own - I\u0027ve tried to cover every supernatural angle over the years, seeking answers in the most unlikely and unrelated of places. That research eventually led me here. \u0027It\u0027s going to be a horror book, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Joe presses. \u0027Maybe,\u0027 I grunt. \u0027Come on,\u0027 Joe groans. \u0027You can tell me. It won\u0027t go any further.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll be the first to know. But you have to be patient. Sometimes plots come together quickly. More times they don\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s really not all there yet?\u0027 Joe asks. \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027So . . . \u0027 He blushes. \u0027If I came up with an idea, and it was really good, and you used it, could I get a credit?\u0027 \u0027Sure.\u0027 \u0027Imagine,\u0027 he sighs. \u0027An Edward Sieveking and Joe Rickard book. Your name at the top, mine below, slightly smaller print.\u0027 \u0027Maybe your name should be at the top,\u0027 I deadpan. Joe withers me with a look. \u0027No need to be cynical. I know the book\u0027s yours. I was only thinking how nice it would be to - \u0027 \u0027What was that?\u0027 I silence him with a sharp gesture. There\u0027s a low rumbling noise. My hopes rise. Joe dashes them. \u0027Just a cat.\u0027 He laughs. \u0027A tom on the make.\u0027 He\u0027s right, and I\u0027m annoyed with myself. I should have made the connection before him. I\u0027m the one with experience. We settle back into silence. I think about when I first made contact with Joe, nearly a year ago. I was promoting my most recent book, Soul Vultures. It was the first time I\u0027d released a novel under my own name. Before then I\u0027d called myself E.S. King. (My original agent thought that Stephen King fans might buy my work on the strength of the pseudonym, but in fact it worked against me and hampered sales.) With Soul Vultures and a new agent, Edward Sieveking finally saw the light of day. My first two books, Nights of Fear and Summer\u0027s Shades, were re-released and did better business second time round. I wasn\u0027t exactly haunting the best-seller charts, but after a stumbling start, I had a definite feeling that I was on my way. I took part in an internet chat-room session that turned out to be a damp squib. Several people lodged questions about the new book, but Joe was the only one who seemed familiar with my past work. I sent him a signed copy of Soul Vultures and the reprints of the other pair, and we became Facebook buddies. A few months ago, I told him about the start I\u0027d made on my next novel, mentioning the fact that I was exploring the field of SHC, and he talked me into setting it in London. \u0027This city\u0027s spookier than a graveyard,\u0027 he vowed. \u0027Plus I know people in the field who could be helpful.\u0027 It didn\u0027t take him long to persuade me. I\u0027d been to London a few times, but years ago, before I established myself as a writer. I\u0027d never explored it with a creative eye. My other novels were set in rural towns - two in America, one in Canada - but a city was vital to the framework this time, and London seemed as good a place as any. Besides, I was looking forward to meeting Joe. I\u0027m a loner and don\u0027t have many friends. I thought it would be good for me to team up with an assistant. My agent keeps telling me that I come across too stiffly in interviews. I was hoping that time spent with Joe might loosen me up and help me talk more freely about my work. Joe leans forward and taps my knee, interrupting my reverie. His dark brown eyes are wide. He points towards the opposite wall. As I turn, a wind gusts through the room and the candles blow out. Fortunately there are numerous holes and cracks in the boards covering the front windows, and enough light seeps in from the street lamps to see by. Mist is rising from the bare brick wall. No, not rising . . . emanating. It doesn\u0027t drift like normal mist would. It\u0027s bubbling out, as if blown from an invisible pair of lips. Dirty grey mist, coming from within the wall. \u0027Shit,\u0027 Joe gasps, getting to his feet. \u0027It\u0027s real.\u0027 He\u0027s trembling. This is his first time. Nothing can prepare you for that initial encounter, that moment of confirmation that there really is more to the world than what most people ever see. The bubble has reached its limits. About three feet in diameter, two thirds visible, one third obscured inside the wall. The mist eddies within the translucent boundaries, thick and thin tendrils overlapping, blending into one another. I lay my camera on my lap. According to the landlady, a flash frightens the apparition away and nothing develops, but I\u0027ve got to try. \u0027Can you hear popping sounds?\u0027 Joe asks, leaning towards the bubble, face aglow, eyes wide with wonder. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027What are they?\u0027 I shrug. \u0027Ghosts forming. The mist reacting with the atmosphere. Exploding air bubbles inside the wall. Take your pick.\u0027 I rise from my chair, walk around the ball of mist and study it from the sides. I can see through it, but only barely. Cold air radiates from it. \u0027Ed,\u0027 croaks Joe, and raises a trembling finger. \u0027Faces.\u0027 I return to my chair and stand by it. Within the mist, faces - or eerie simulacra - are forming. They aren\u0027t clearly defined, but they seem to be human. Glimpses of eyes and ears, open mouths, teeth. I think of the figures hovering behind me but I don\u0027t look back to compare their faces with those in the bubble. I don\u0027t need to. Those six faces are as familiar to me by now as my own. I don\u0027t show it, but I\u0027m excited. Apparitions are rarely this vivid. This is one of the most astonishing encounters I\u0027ve yet to experience. I turn towards Joe. \u0027Describe what you\u0027re seeing.\u0027 He gulps, tugs nervously at his beard, then whispers reverently, almost afraid to speak. \u0027A woman\u0027s face, maybe twenty years old. Long hair. The face is changing now. Losing its shape. Gone.\u0027 A few seconds of silence. \u0027Now another\u0027s forming.\u0027 \u0027A boy\u0027s,\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027Plump. Short hair, badly cut fringe, what looks like a bruise under his left eye?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s it,\u0027 Joe agrees. \u0027Great. We\u0027re seeing the same thing.\u0027 It\u0027s important to establish that fact. People don\u0027t always interpret apparitions the same way. The faces so far have been small, embedded within the heart of the mist. Now one forms closer to the surface of the bubble, larger than the rest. An old man. We\u0027ve been told that the other faces vary, but this one always returns. \u0027This is unreal,\u0027 Joe moans as the man\u0027s gaze sweeps the room. Joe is shaking badly. He glances at the door and I expect him to run. But then he bunches his fingers into fists and forces himself to stand firm. \u0027Do you see his pupils?\u0027 I ask. Joe stares, then nods. \u0027I couldn\u0027t see any on the others. Their features were blurred. This one\u0027s less ethereal.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re real,\u0027 Joe mutters. \u0027Ghosts are real.\u0027 \u0027So they\u0027d have us believe,\u0027 I say sourly, then press closer to the bubble. \u0027Tell me your name,\u0027 I whisper. \u0027Prove you are what you appear to be.\u0027 The ghost doesn\u0027t respond. None of them ever has. We spend a couple of minutes watching the old man\u0027s face as his eyes roam. When there are no further developments, I decide to try a snap. \u0027Seen all you want?\u0027 I ask Joe as I produce my camera. He nods reluctantly. \u0027Yeah.\u0027 I take a quick shot. The face dissipates instantly and the bubble loses its shape. Most of the mist is sucked back into the wall. A strong sulphurous stench fills the room. I cover my mouth with the mask I always bring along. Joe also has one - I gave it to him on our first night here - but he seems to have misplaced it. While he fumbles in his pockets and coughs, I take him by the elbow and guide him out into the corridor. Once the coughing subsides, he wipes tears from his eyes and grins weakly. \u0027Must have left the mask at home.\u0027 He stares through the open door at the last of the mist vanishing into thin air. \u0027You see shit like this all the time?\u0027 \u0027No two apparitions are the same, but yes.\u0027 \u0027Fuck.\u0027 He shivers. \u0027They\u0027re really real.\u0027 I arch an eyebrow at him. \u0027You reckon?\u0027 \u0027After what we\u0027ve just seen? Of course.\u0027 He squints at me. \u0027Are you saying you don\u0027t believe?\u0027 \u0027I want to,\u0027 I say softly. \u0027More than you could imagine. But . . . \u0027 I check the camera. Nothing in the picture except the wall and some mist. I show it to Joe. \u0027So?\u0027 He frowns. \u0027You said ghosts are almost impossible to photograph.\u0027 \u0027Yes. That\u0027s why I\u0027m sceptical.\u0027 I put the camera away, disappointed as I often am after a sighting, even one as spectacular as this. Joe is staring at me uncertainly. \u0027If that\u0027s not enough proof for you, what is?\u0027 I pull a face. \u0027I want one of them to tell me it\u0027s real. If that was truly the shade of a dead person, I want it to talk with me, answer my questions, confirm that it is what it seems.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s never happened?\u0027 Joe asks. I shake my head. \u0027I\u0027ve spoken with the dead many times through mediums and Ouija boards, but how can you trust a source like that? I know most of the tricks that fakes use to fool gullible customers. Even on the few occasions when I\u0027ve been surprised, when I\u0027ve not been able to explain what has happened, I haven\u0027t found concrete, one hundred per cent proof.\u0027 \u0027What about what we saw tonight?\u0027 Joe challenges me. I smile bitterly. \u0027It was incredible. But what does it prove? People used to think that the Northern Lights were dead spirits shimmering across the sky. Who\u0027s to say there isn\u0027t a scientific explanation for what we\u0027ve just seen?\u0027 Joe scratches at his beard. \u0027But in your books, you claim that ghosts are real.\u0027 \u0027And I want them to be. But I haven\u0027t found proof yet.\u0027 \u0027What would prove it to you, Ed?\u0027 Joe asks. \u0027A genuine encounter,\u0027 I reply. \u0027A ghost who\u0027ll address me directly, tell me its name, answer questions. One with a verifiable history, who can prove it\u0027s every bit as real as you are.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a big ask,\u0027 Joe notes. \u0027Not if they\u0027re real,\u0027 I laugh, then smirk at Joe. \u0027What do you reckon? Has that put you off ghost-hunting? Do you want to leave it here and not push on?\u0027 \u0027Are you shitting me?\u0027 Joe gasps. \u0027That was amazing! It scared me but I loved it. Back out now? Not on your nelly.\u0027 \u0027Not on my what?\u0027 He waves the question away. \u0027I\u0027ll explain later. Where next? I\u0027m hungry for more.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s enough for tonight,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027Let\u0027s go home. It\u0027s late.\u0027 Joe checks his watch and whistles. \u0027We\u0027ve missed closing time. Fancy coming back to my place for a few drinks?\u0027 \u0027Thanks, but no. I want to write this up while it\u0027s fresh in my mind.\u0027 \u0027No problem. Are we returning tomorrow?\u0027 \u0027No. This house has revealed all of its secrets. It\u0027s time to move on. There\u0027s a guy I\u0027m trying to arrange a meeting with. Pierre Vallance. He\u0027s a medium but he doesn\u0027t believe in ghosts.\u0027 \u0027How can a medium not believe in ghosts?\u0027 Joe frowns. \u0027That\u0027s what I want to find out,\u0027 I say drily, then lead Joe back to the security of the safe, boring, normal world. Behind us, my six shades glide along after me, as silent, observant and condemning as always.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-2.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
