{"id":108128,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Back at the Royal Munster, I tell Joe about my extraordinary meeting. He can\u0027t believe Gardiner was so forthcoming. \u0027How come he opened up to you? He thinks you\u0027re a journalist. I\u0027d have thought someone in his position wouldn\u0027t trust a journalist with the time, never mind admit to being an accomplice to murder.\u0027 \u0027It was . . . strange,\u0027 I agree, for want of a better word. \u0027He said he wanted to confess, and maybe that was partly true, but I think he was also worried about me stirring up interest among his associates. He had to stop me asking questions and taking this further. That meant coming clean or killing me. I guess telling me the truth was less of a hassle.\u0027 \u0027Maybe he knows something about the Andeanna impostor,\u0027 Joe suggests. \u0027He\u0027s profited most through Menderes\u0027s death. Maybe he arranged the set-up.\u0027 \u0027I considered that. But Gardiner was set to take over anyway when the Turk retired. Everyone says they were like brothers. I don\u0027t think he was involved.\u0027 Joe shrugs. \u0027So, where next?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s time I paid Greygo a visit. He might be able to give us the name of Andeanna\u0027s lover.\u0027 \u0027Andeanna\u0027s dead lover,\u0027 Joe corrects me. \u0027Alive, dead . . . \u0027 I grimace. \u0027It doesn\u0027t seem like there\u0027s much of a difference any more.\u0027 Gregory Menderes doesn\u0027t want to talk. I have his number - picked it up during the course of my investigations - but he\u0027s heard about me, the book I\u0027m meant to be writing, and once I identify myself, he hangs up every time I ring, sets the phone to voicemail if I persist. Joe suggests waiting outside the mansion, but I don\u0027t want to chase after him like an ignorant paparazzo. Instead, I leave him be for a while and kick my heels around the Royal Munster, thinking about Andeanna and all that I\u0027ve learnt about her, trying to piece the various links of the mystery together. I phone Greygo the following Wednesday and he cuts me off. When I call again and get directed to voicemail, I leave a message. \u0027I\u0027ve uncovered some alarming secrets about your mother. If you don\u0027t meet with me, I\u0027ll have to publish them unapproved and uncorroborated. I don\u0027t want to do a smear piece, but if you leave me no choice, I will.\u0027 A couple of minutes later the phone rings. \u0027If you\u0027re bullshitting me, you\u0027ll regret it.\u0027 Greygo has a strong Cockney accent, nothing like his father or mother. At least not the mother I knew. \u0027I\u0027m not bullshitting you,\u0027 I assure him. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t bother you if it wasn\u0027t important. I\u0027ve spoken with your grandfather, so I know how much - \u0027 \u0027Andrew?\u0027 he interrupts, surprised. \u0027I interviewed him in Birmingham. He told me about - \u0027 \u0027Andrew let you in?\u0027 Greygo interrupts again. \u0027He answered your questions?\u0027 \u0027Yes. I\u0027ve also been in contact with Bond Gardiner and others who knew your parents. I want to paint as complete a picture of your father\u0027s life as I can.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s why you\u0027re ringing? To get my opinion of him?\u0027 \u0027No. At first, yes, that was all. Now there\u0027s more. I learnt something yesterday that changes everything. This is personal, maybe nothing to do with the book. It\u0027s about your mother.\u0027 Greygo is silent. Finally, when I think he\u0027s going to cut me off, he snaps, \u0027Do you know where I live?\u0027 All too fucking well! \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Can you meet me this afternoon, two o\u0027clock?\u0027 \u0027I can.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027ll be guards. Come alone. You have two minutes to impress me, so start with the big revelation.\u0027 \u0027Thank . . . \u0027 He hangs up. \u0027 . . . you,\u0027 I finish, and grin victoriously. I call Joe to let him know of the development. He\u0027s worried - he talks about stepping into the lion\u0027s den - and asks if he should call the police if I haven\u0027t contacted him by evening. I tell him not to bother, just dial a good undertaker. He doesn\u0027t laugh. He wasn\u0027t meant to. I was being serious. It\u0027s weird returning to the Menderes mansion, feigning unfamiliarity. I\u0027m met at the gate by an armed guard who makes me leave my car outside and walk up the drive ahead of him to the front steps, where I\u0027m subjected to a body search by two of his colleagues. If Bond Gardiner was thorough, these guys are absolute, and stop just short of a rectal probe. Gregory Menderes, known to one and all as Greygo, awaits inside, seated in one of the mansion\u0027s smaller rooms, a leather-lined study. He\u0027s behind a desk. A thin layer of stubble crowns his shaven head. He\u0027s dressed in a white suit. His face is darkly tanned. He doesn\u0027t offer to shake hands. \u0027Sit down,\u0027 he growls. Even though the room is dimly lit, I can see his mother in his features. He looks a lot like her, same nose, mouth and eyes, although his are a soulful blue where hers were a vibrant green. The memory of Andeanna - my Andeanna - brings a lump to my throat. \u0027Get on with it,\u0027 he orders briskly, and I cough the lump away. \u0027Your mother was murdered.\u0027 Greygo stares at me coldly. \u0027Is that it?\u0027 he asks. I\u0027ve no answer to that. I can only nod dumbly, stunned by his nonchalant reaction. \u0027I don\u0027t know who filled your head with such nonsense, but they were wrong. If that\u0027s all you came to tell me, this meeting is at an end.\u0027 I stare at him wordlessly. \u0027That\u0027s your cue to leave, Mr Sanders.\u0027 Finding my tongue, I splutter, \u0027You don\u0027t understand. It was your father. He killed her.\u0027 \u0027Ridiculous,\u0027 Greygo snorts. \u0027My father loved my mother.\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 I sneer. \u0027He loved her so much, he knocked the shit out of her every time she looked sideways at another man.\u0027 Greygo\u0027s eyes narrow to slits. \u0027Did my grandfather tell you that?\u0027 \u0027Yes. But he wasn\u0027t the only one.\u0027 The Menderes heir nods slowly. \u0027They tried to hide it from me. They thought I didn\u0027t know. But children always . . . \u0027 He snaps back to attention. \u0027That\u0027s neither here nor there. My father didn\u0027t kill my mother, no matter how many times he hit her. Now, if that\u0027s all, I\u0027m a busy - \u0027 \u0027She had a lover,\u0027 I bark, determined to make an impact. He says nothing, but I can tell by the way he fidgets that I\u0027ve got to him. \u0027Your father killed them. He arranged the crash to look like an accident and had Bond Gardiner dispose of her lover\u0027s body.\u0027 Greygo lifts one of his hands and chews a fingernail. \u0027Since Bond is the only person in the world who could have told you that story, I assume you picked it up from him?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t reveal my sources,\u0027 I reply weakly. Greygo smiles thinly. \u0027It couldn\u0027t have been anybody else. I\u0027m shocked that he confided in you. He never told anyone about this, not even me. He thinks I don\u0027t know, and I\u0027m happy to let him go on thinking that.\u0027 \u0027You mean you knew about the murders?\u0027 \u0027I know about a murder,\u0027 he corrects me. \u0027Axel Nelke\u0027s.\u0027 My face grows ashen. \u0027That was the name of her lover,\u0027 Gregyo continues. \u0027The man my father murdered when he caught them betraying him.\u0027 I\u0027m glad I\u0027m sitting down. All the strength has drained from me. I feel like a sack of moon rock. \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 Greygo asks, something close to concern in his tone. \u0027Nelke,\u0027 I gasp. \u0027Do you want a glass of water? Some fresh air?\u0027 I wave away his offers. \u0027Did . . . one of your father\u0027s bodyguards . . . go missing shortly before his death?\u0027 I wheeze. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027I heard that one of your father\u0027s men disappeared. That he might be a suspect.\u0027 Greygo frowns. \u0027I haven\u0027t heard anything like that. I don\u0027t keep a close tab on everything that happens, but I\u0027d have been informed of something that important.\u0027 \u0027No guards have gone missing?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 I reflect on what that means, but my mind is a blank, and if there are conclusions to be drawn, I can\u0027t draw them. \u0027This Axel Nelke that your father killed,\u0027 I croak, staring at the smirking ghost in the room who went by that name before I strangled him with a telephone cable not too far from where I\u0027m sitting now. \u0027Describe him.\u0027 Greygo laughs. \u0027I was ten years old. All adults looked the same.\u0027 The ghost of Axel Nelke cackles silently and flips me the finger. \u0027Did he have any children?\u0027 I ask. \u0027I don\u0027t think so. He was single when he and my mother . . . \u0027 He grimaces. \u0027I don\u0027t understand this,\u0027 I moan as Nelke\u0027s ghost presses closer, puckering up his lips as if he\u0027s going to kiss me, then snapping at me with his fog-like fangs. \u0027It\u0027s like a nightmare, and the more I try to wake up, the further into it I slip.\u0027 Greygo stares at me uncomprehendingly. After a while he stands and starts for the door. Afraid that he plans to summon the guards, I lurch to my feet and block his way. As he takes a sharp step back, I raise my hands to show I mean no harm. \u0027I know how strangely I\u0027m behaving. I\u0027m sorry. This is the first book I\u0027ve written. It\u0027s stressing me out like you wouldn\u0027t believe.\u0027 \u0027Then drop it,\u0027 Greygo says drily. \u0027Maybe I will,\u0027 I sigh, pretending that\u0027s an option. \u0027It just seems to get crazier the further I run with it.\u0027 Keeping a wary eye on me, Greygo sits and points towards my chair. Once I\u0027m seated, he asks why I reacted that way to the name of Axel Nelke. Thinking quickly, ignoring the ghost of the man in question as it tries to distract me, I start talking. \u0027I began this book shortly after your father\u0027s death. At first I meant to tell his story in a traditional fashion. Then a man calling himself Axel Nelke told me that Mikis Menderes had been seen with a woman the spitting image of your mother in the weeks prior to his death, and that she\u0027d vanished afterwards. That fascinated me and led me to . . . \u0027 I stop. Greygo\u0027s face has misted over and he\u0027s smiling benignly. He gets up, heads for the door and beckons me to follow. Outside, he dismisses the guards and leads me on a tour of the mansion, although he doesn\u0027t talk about the rooms, just glides through them, touching the walls and furniture as he goes. \u0027Bond Gardiner lied to you about my mother,\u0027 he says as we mount the stairs. \u0027He wanted to misdirect you. This is what really happened. \u0027My mother enjoyed a short affair towards the end of her life, with Axel Nelke, one of her guards. My father suspected from the start. They had a couple of close calls, which should have been warning enough, but they persisted. Things came to a tragic but predictable head. He killed Nelke, I\u0027m not sure how, though I think he strangled him.\u0027 I flinch at that. Nelke\u0027s ghost raises his chin and smugly points to the mark around his neck. \u0027And your mother?\u0027 I ask. \u0027He gave her one hell of a beating, I\u0027m sure, but he loved her and would never - could never - have killed her.\u0027 \u0027But Gardiner said - \u0027 \u0027Mr Sanders,\u0027 he tuts, \u0027do you think I\u0027d have shared this house with my father all these years if he\u0027d murdered my mother?\u0027 \u0027If you didn\u0027t know about it . . . \u0027 I mutter. \u0027But I have known, for five years or more. Nobody murdered my mother.\u0027 He pauses. We\u0027re outside one of the guest bedrooms. The corridor is long and empty. Nevertheless, he lowers his voice and says, \u0027She killed herself.\u0027 He starts walking again. After a moment of horrid pause, I hurry after him, catch him by his right arm and spin him round so he\u0027s facing me. I\u0027m not surprised to see tears in his eyes. \u0027It was suicide?\u0027 I hiss. \u0027Yes. My father killed Axel Nelke. Bond got rid of the body. My mother lost her will to live. A few weeks later she went out driving, took a sharp turn off the road and deliberately rammed her car into a tree. Obviously that makes me feel sick every time I think about it, and yes, I blamed my father to an extent. I wish he\u0027d been gentler with her, more understanding, as he was with me. But she made the decision to give up. My father suffered when he lost her, more than he ever admitted. Hating him would have served no viable purpose.\u0027 I take in this latest twist, mind reeling. \u0027A witness said there were flames in the car before it crashed.\u0027 \u0027There couldn\u0027t have been. It was suicide.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t know that for sure,\u0027 I disagree. \u0027Nobody was in the car with her. You want it to be suicide, so you don\u0027t have to blame your father.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not a theory,\u0027 he replies softly. \u0027It\u0027s the truth.\u0027 \u0027How can you know?\u0027 I huff. \u0027Only one person really knows, and she\u0027s . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . dead,\u0027 he finishes calmly. \u0027But the dead can talk, and this came straight from the horse\u0027s mouth.\u0027 \u0027What the hell are you talking about?\u0027 Greygo looks me calmly in the eye. \u0027Do you believe in ghosts, Mr Sanders?\u0027 I take a step away from him and glance at the seven shades huddled around me. I expect them to snicker and mock me, as Nelke\u0027s ghost has been doing, but they only stare at me accusingly, still and serious. I almost run, for some reason afraid of what Gregory Menderes has to tell me, but I\u0027m compelled to hear him out. I have to know the truth, or at least his version of it. \u0027This used to be a haunted house,\u0027 Greygo says. \u0027People have often asked me what it\u0027s like to lose your mother at such a young age. I\u0027ve never been able to tell them, because until recently, I hadn\u0027t truly lost her.\u0027 He starts to walk again. I trail after him, listening numbly. The ghosts follow in a line, like mourners at a funeral, Nelke slipping into place among them, the sad little girl at the head of the procession. \u0027Her spirit came to me the night of her death,\u0027 Greygo says. \u0027I awoke to darkness, scared, somehow certain that my mother was dead, only to find her by my bed. She didn\u0027t speak, but in my head I heard her telling me it was OK, I had nothing to fear, she wasn\u0027t going to leave me. I fell back into a deep sleep. When my father came to break the news to me in the morning, I took it serenely, knowing she wasn\u0027t really gone. \u0027She\u0027s been patrolling the halls of this house ever since. Always at night. It\u0027s hard to describe her. She looks real, like when she was alive, but at the same time there\u0027s something insubstantial about her.\u0027 \u0027This is madness,\u0027 I croak. Greygo shrugs. We\u0027ve come to Andeanna\u0027s room. He stands in the doorway, gazing in. \u0027My father kept this room as she left it. She spent much of her time here, seated in her favourite chair or lying on the bed.\u0027 He closes the door gently, lovingly. \u0027I don\u0027t know if anyone else saw her. Our servants sensed something - so many refused to work nights that eventually we employed them only in the day - but I never heard them discussing her. I think my father knew. I suspect that\u0027s why he never married again.\u0027 \u0027And Axel Nelke?\u0027 I ask sceptically. \u0027Does he hang out here too?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 Greygo frowns. \u0027It\u0027s only ever been my mother. I don\u0027t know who the person you spoke with could have been, how he knew about her or why he told you what he did. Where did you meet him?\u0027 I open my mouth to answer, then shut it sharply. What can I tell him, that I met Nelke here? That I also met with his dead mother? Oh, and by the way, I\u0027m the guy who killed his father, but it\u0027s OK, I did it because Andeanna told me to? \u0027Show me your mother,\u0027 I say instead, challenging him to back up his wild story with proof. Greygo\u0027s face softens. \u0027She doesn\u0027t come any more. Not since my father died. I like to think she was waiting for him, that they\u0027re together now and have moved on to a better place.\u0027 \u0027Very romantic,\u0027 I scoff. \u0027Or perhaps she was hanging around to see him die. Maybe she was waiting for revenge. Maybe she set up his murder.\u0027 Greygo stares at me as if I\u0027m mad. Maybe I am. Right now I don\u0027t know where this world stops and all the other worlds begin. I\u0027ve criticized Joe for jumping to phantastical conclusions, but now I find myself leaping higher than he ever did. \u0027An eye for an eye, a life for a life. Perhaps she found a way to materialize outside of this house. Maybe she hired the assassin who . . . \u0027 Gregory Menderes bursts out laughing. \u0027That\u0027s insane.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re the one who claims to have lived with a ghost,\u0027 I remind him. \u0027A ghost, yes, the shade of a woman who died of extreme unhappiness. Not some zombie who arranges assassinations. Besides, as I said, my father didn\u0027t kill her, so there was no call for revenge.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re back to that again. How do you know? How can you stand here and claim to - \u0027 \u0027Does the name Etienne Anders mean anything to you?\u0027 he cuts in. I\u0027m about to tell him it doesn\u0027t, when I recall the mystic the fake Andeanna encouraged me to see when I was researching Spirit of the Fire. \u0027Yes,\u0027 I say cautiously. \u0027Do you know how to contact her?\u0027 \u0027I have her number.\u0027 \u0027Arrange a meeting. Tell her I sent you. Ask her to put you in touch.\u0027 \u0027In touch?\u0027 Now it\u0027s my turn to stare at him as if he\u0027s the mad one. \u0027In touch with who?\u0027 He smiles thinly. \u0027If you can\u0027t figure that out, you\u0027re not half the detective you think you are.\u0027 He offers his hand, and in a daze I take it. \u0027Good day, Mr Sanders. I should show you to the door, but I\u0027d like to be alone for a while. I\u0027m sure you understand.\u0027 \u0027But the ghost . . . your mother . . . the truth . . . \u0027 \u0027Etienne can explain better than I can,\u0027 he promises. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t believe me if I told you. Go see her. Call me when you\u0027re finished, if you like, though I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll need to.\u0027 He nods curtly, wheels away and heads back to his study. I stand on the landing, brain cranking creakily. Then, with the ghosts following, still in a sombre line, I shakily make my way down the stairs and stumble away from the house of madness and death, into the shadowy mysteries beyond.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-18.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
