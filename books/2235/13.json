{"id":108123,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"The next few days fly by. I alter my appearance slightly before hitting the estate agents, combing my hair a different way, pencilling in an array of freckles across the bridge of my nose, purchasing a cheap pair of glasses, along with a second-hand suit which is too short in the legs and sleeves. I print up business cards with Nelke\u0027s name, a fake address and the number of a second cell phone, which I buy, and I\u0027m ready to go.\n It\u0027s more difficult than I\u0027d anticipated. The agents here don\u0027t seem to be as open to bribes as those in America. Or else they don\u0027t believe my divorce story and think I\u0027m trying to set them up for a sting. But finally I find a dapper little man who bills himself as James Biesty Esq., who sympathizes with my predicament and says he has the perfect place for me, a small house that has been on his books for months with not even a sniff of an offer. The owner lives abroad, has a string of other properties which are making regular returns. He\u0027ll be none the wiser about our \u0027little arrangement\u0027.\n \u0027What\u0027s good for the goose is good for the gander,\u0027 Mr Biesty chuckles, and I smile as if I have a clue what he\u0027s talking about.\n We drive out to the property to give it the once-over. It\u0027s a bit run-down, and backs on to a busy railway line, but that doesn\u0027t bother me. I thought I\u0027d have to rent a flat, but a house is even better, so I\u0027m delighted. I barter James down - I think that\u0027s expected, even on a shady deal like this one - then return to the office to arrange payment. I pay for the first three months up front. James agrees to issue a refund if there are complications and I have to vacate prematurely, but as no receipt is proffered, I have only his word for that. I think he\u0027s probably good for it, but I\u0027m not bothered either way. If everything works out, Mr Biesty Esq. will be more than welcome to his profit.\n Once the keys are mine, I tell Andeanna to send the letter. Then the waiting begins.\n I spend a couple of days rattling around the rented house, cleaning and airing it. The radiators run off an oil tank, which I have filled. I check all the lights and replace those that have blown. I don\u0027t try to hook up the telephone. Instead I buy another cell and leave it there, fully charged, with credit on it. I also buy a bed, chairs, some other bits and pieces, and have the furniture delivered. I pay for everything with cash.\n When the house has been arranged to my satisfaction, I scout the neighbourhood, making notes of shops and supermarkets, which I later type up and leave lying on the kitchen table for Dash, along with spending money and a map of the area. After that, I sit back and ring the cell twice a day, waiting for him to answer.\n I try getting back into Spirit of the Fire, but the real-world intrigue proves too distracting. Instead I go for long walks, taking in museums and art galleries, and read a lot of books, old thrillers mostly.\n I wish I could call Joe. The time would pass quicker with him around to crack dumb jokes and accompany me on my tours. But I\u0027m determined not to involve him, not with things balanced the way they are.\n Two weeks drag by. I go back to Heathrow to move the car. I park it elsewhere for a couple of nights, in a lot with no CCTV or security guards, then return it to the airport.\n Another week ticks past. Autumn is sweeping the city. Leaves turn orange and brown. Dark clouds move in to stay, although it doesn\u0027t rain much. The nights draw in. The temperature dips. I invest in some sweaters and return to the house to heat it up and set the timer to come on at regular intervals. I also recharge the phone while I\u0027m there.\n Finally, almost a month after we posted the letter, I call the cell phone one day and a man answers. \u0027Hello?\u0027\n \u0027Good morning. Is Antonia there?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid you have the wrong number.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry to trouble you.\u0027\n \u0027No trouble at all.\u0027\n Game on!\n Dash has to be seen. It\u0027s no good bringing him all the way over to be our fall guy if we leave him sitting indoors, hidden from those who can identify him. At the same time, we don\u0027t want to place him in a situation where he might run into the Turk or his men. Andeanna recommends a small pub called the Purple Platypus. It\u0027s on the Turk\u0027s turf (they call it a manor here, a phrase I add to my lexicon in case I ever return to work on my book), but he fell out with the landlord years ago and shuns it these days.\n We send a second letter to the assassin. Glad you could make it. We must meet to discuss terms. It\u0027s a private matter. Only you and I must know about it. Be at the Purple Platypus between seven and nine every night this week and I will make contact.\n I\u0027m sure Dash will be recognized in the pub. I\u0027m just as sure he\u0027ll reject any overtures from the locals. He keeps his head down when he\u0027s on a job. By Friday, word will have spread that he\u0027s in town. Come Saturday morning, the Turk will be dead, his left shoelace left untied, and the gossipmongers will have tried and convicted Dash by midday.\n It has to be Friday, because that\u0027s when the Turk is throwing a dinner party for several of his more legitimate colleagues - bankers, stockbrokers and so on. He hosts the house parties three or four times a year. On such occasions he dispenses with his regular guards, not wanting to alarm any of his associates who might not know about his seedier business interests. If the timing hadn\u0027t been so perfect, we would have made other arrangements, but with Dash arriving shortly before a giltedged opportunity, we\u0027d be crazy to waste it.\n I spend the days before Friday worrying about the hit. The Turk might not stay on after the party. Or he might invite some of his guests to spend the night at the mansion. Or . . .\n To distract myself, I stake out the Purple Platypus on Thursday and take note of Sebastian Dash entering and leaving as scheduled. He looks a little longer in the tooth and greyer at the temples than the last time our paths crossed, but still in excellent shape. The sight of him stirs up bitter feelings, and any tinge of regret I might have felt at involving him evaporates in a mist of melancholy memories.\n Friday finally dawns. I spend the morning rehearsing, mentally putting myself through my paces, trying to ensure the margin of error is as narrow as possible. I dismantle the gun then put it back together, as I have done several times since retrieving it from Nelke\u0027s car. I\u0027m also packing a hunting knife in case the gun misfires.\n I haven\u0027t heard from Andeanna since Wednesday - the Turk or one of his men must have been with her last night. I want to call her to make sure everything\u0027s OK, but that would be foolish. I have to trust that the dinner party is going ahead and that the Turk will be alone afterwards. Except, of course, for Andeanna.\n I\u0027d rather she wasn\u0027t present. We discussed it. She could have spent the night with one of her friends, or gone to visit Greygo - he\u0027s on tour in the Midlands. But the Turk likes to have his wife by his side at business functions. It might have seemed suspicious if she\u0027d cried off. Andeanna suggested I slug her unconscious and make it look like she walked in on the killer. The trouble is, assassins don\u0027t knock out people who get in their way. They kill them.\n We\u0027ve settled on alcohol. Andeanna occasionally overindulges and blacks out. The Turk\u0027s crew know this and won\u0027t link it with his murder. We hope.\n Six o\u0027clock passes. Seven. Eight. Dash should be sitting in the Purple Platypus now, patient as the Sphinx. This could be his last night of freedom, perhaps his last of life, but I feel nothing for him. Nine. Ten.\n Time to move.\n I drive north and park close to the gates of the mansion. Lights off. Head down. No nerves now. Totally focused on the job. A killing machine, all doubts and fears forgotten.\n The first guests leave shortly after eleven, early birds. Then nobody until half twelve, when the rest trickle out.\n I wait an hour after the last car, to be absolutely sure. The Turk normally sends the caterers home before the meal starts (he likes to serve up the food himself), but sometimes they stay to clean. I don\u0027t want to run into them if they\u0027re still there.\n Two o\u0027clock. No signs of life. Sliding out of the car, I cross the street, hop the wall and hurry towards the mansion, avoiding the driveway, ready to drop to the ground at the slightest hint of human life.\n I circle the house. No unexpected cars or vans. I glance nervously at the CCTV cameras. Andeanna was supposed to disable the system earlier, while the caterers were setting up. If she did her job, Bond Gardiner and the others will assume that someone on the team was in league with the assassin, maybe even that one of the members of staff was the killer in disguise. But if she forgot about it, or made a mistake, I\u0027m screwed.\n I slip up to the back door and slam it open. Andeanna suggested leaving it unlocked, but it will look better if it\u0027s been forced. The Turk usually doesn\u0027t think to set the alarm after a party - he gets careless when he\u0027s had a few drinks. If he\u0027s broken with habit, our plan is dead in the water.\n No siren. The plan lives on.\n I advance through the dark rooms into the main hall, then pad up the stairs. I pause on the landing and check the gun. Ready to shoot. All I need is a target.\n A door opens. I drop and swivel, raising the gun automatically. I almost fire, but catch myself in time. Thank God I do - it\u0027s Andeanna, a bottle of vodka clutched in her hands, looking wretched.\n \u0027We mustn\u0027t do it,\u0027 she groans, staggering towards me. I clutch her before she topples down the stairs. \u0027He\u0027s my . . . they\u0027ll know . . . we can\u0027t . . . \u0027\n I silence her with a kiss, tasting vodka on her lips. She\u0027s sobbing when we part, but doesn\u0027t repeat her plea for clemency.\n \u0027You\u0027re supposed to be unconscious,\u0027 I chide her.\n \u0027I soon will be,\u0027 she sniffs, shaking the bottle. \u0027I drank all through dinner. Mikis sent me to my room in disgrace. I\u0027ll have hell to face tomorrow. He\u0027ll . . . \u0027 She stops. \u0027Oh. I forgot. There won\u0027t be a tomorrow for Mikis.\u0027\n \u0027But there will be for us,\u0027 I smile, kissing her again. \u0027Did you remember to disable the CCTV?\u0027\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n I kiss her a third and final time. \u0027In that case we\u0027re sweet. Go back to your room. Finish your bottle. Sleep.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe I should come . . . \u0027 She trails off even before I start shaking my head.\n \u0027Let\u0027s stick to the plan. The less you see or know, the better.\u0027\n \u0027Will I phone you in the morning?\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 I\u0027m angry now. \u0027No contact. Play the part of the grieving widow and play it damn well. I\u0027ll catch the Eurostar to Paris on Tuesday. You stay here, bury Mikis, tend to the formalities, then follow me in a few months. We\u0027ll meet, fall in love, everyone will say how romantic it is and no one will ever suspect.\u0027\n She forces a smile. \u0027I knew all that. It\u0027s the vodka. I never could handle hard liquor. I get weepy.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s OK. I understand. Now - bed.\u0027\n She nods and kisses my cheek, a fleeting brush of her lips, then slides back into her room and closes the door softly. Clicking back into killer mode, I clear my thoughts of Andeanna and Paris, and focus on the present, the Turk and the gun.\n I push on.\n I know where Mikis\u0027s room is - Andeanna included it in the tour the last time I roamed the corridors of this house. I halt at the door and press an ear to the wood. I hear light snoring. I turn the handle and enter.\n It\u0027s a shrine to masculinity. Photographs of beautiful women adorn the walls, every one a romantic conquest. Shots of Mikis fill the space between his lovers, most from when he was a young man in his prime, in the Turkish football strip, stooping from a polo horse with a mallet, clinging to the side of a mountain, in a gym with his bare chest glistening as he hoists weights high above his head.\n And there, on the bed, is the legend himself, the lady-killer, the wife-beater, Mikis Menderes, aka the Turk.\n I should shoot him while he sleeps. But I can\u0027t. If it was business, sure. But this is personal. It wouldn\u0027t feel right.\n I position myself at the foot of the bed, grab his ankle through the covers and tug sharply. The Turk comes awake with a startled grunt. He spots me. Confusion floods his expression, then anger, but not panic. He glares at me, and I know he knows that he\u0027s finished.\n \u0027Who the fuck are you?\u0027 he asks.\n \u0027Call me Ed.\u0027\n \u0027Who sent you?\u0027\n I don\u0027t answer.\n \u0027You gonna kill me?\u0027\n I don\u0027t answer.\n \u0027Fucking dummy. Can I light a cigarette?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Aw, c\u0027mon, surely you won\u0027t deny a - \u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s for Andeanna.\u0027\n His expression crumples, and I realize that this is what I want, this is why I woke him. I need to see guilt wash over the bastard\u0027s face. I want him to know that he\u0027s paying for the way he abused his wife.\n \u0027Andeanna?\u0027 he croaks. \u0027What the fuck does she have to do with - \u0027\n My finger jerks. The gun kicks once, twice, a third time. Mikis Menderes\u0027s face evaporates. The wall behind the bed blossoms with the bloody remains of his thoughts, memories and personality. His body shudders grotesquely, then goes still for ever.\n I lower the gun and study the havoc of my making. There can be no doubt that he\u0027s dead, but I start forward to check all the same. Then I stop, thinking of blood on the carpet, and footprints. I turn towards the door and hurry from the room.\n I\u0027m at the top of the stairs before I remember the laces.\n Grimacing, I retrace my steps and look for shoes. I find a closet full of them, and extract a pair. I tie the laces on the right shoe, leave those on the left undone, then lay them on the floor by the bed. The police will think they were put there by the Turk. They\u0027ll leave them as they are, along with the other items in the room. They won\u0027t notice the laces, but the Turk\u0027s henchmen will.\n Dash\u0027s signature successfully forged, I make my exit. The plan has a long way yet to run. Things could still unravel spectacularly. But I\u0027ve got a feeling they won\u0027t. The hit went perfectly. I\u0027m certain that fate is on our side. I could whistle as I trot down the stairs, out via the kitchen, through the trees, over the wall and back to the car. But I don\u0027t. It wouldn\u0027t be professional. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-13.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: \n Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
