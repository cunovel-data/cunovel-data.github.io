{"id":108113,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"It\u0027s been a long time since I last visited London. The city has changed in many ways, become more American with its new high-rises and franchised chains of stores and cafes. It\u0027s still a different world to mine, with its old grey buildings and its polite but oddly stiff people, but it\u0027s not as out of sync with the States as it used to be. There was a time when I felt completely alien here. Now it\u0027s almost like visiting any city Stateside. Globalization has a lot to answer for. Having said that, you can\u0027t find a chippy like Super Fish on Waterloo Road anywhere in the States. Or a van parked down a side street that serves jellied eels, like Tubby Isaacs in Aldgate. And I\u0027ve never seen anything like the Hunterian Museum, where you can find the bones of an Irish giant, pickled penises, old surgical instruments that look more like tools of torture, and a whole lot more. They\u0027re all places that Joe has introduced me to, steering me clear of the usual tourist hotspots, giving me an insider\u0027s taste of the city. The other thing I\u0027ve really noticed this time is that London\u0027s landscape is smudged with the fingerprints of the dead. I trudge the streets, lined with houses that date back hundreds of years, built on plague sites and Roman burial grounds, their foundations teeming with history, and it\u0027s as if I\u0027m taking a stroll through the largest mausoleum in the world, where phantoms jostle for space with the living. The hairs on my arms stand to attention, shapes flicker at the periphery of my vision and the air crackles with the whispered conversations of the dead. Whether they\u0027re imagined or real, it\u0027s an amazing place to visit, but I wouldn\u0027t be able to live here. A few months of this and I\u0027d be fit for Bedlam. I\u0027ve been exploring the city, either with Joe - he runs a small electrical repairs shop on a part-time basis, so has plenty of free time on his hands - or by myself. I use cabs, buses and the Tube more often than not, searching for shades of the dead among the detritus of the living. I didn\u0027t always believe in an afterlife. In truth, I\u0027m still not convinced. But I\u0027m open to the possibility of it now, and have been since I attracted my own coterie of other-worldly spirits. My ghosts follow me everywhere, four men, one woman and a nine-year-old girl, haunting my every waking step, standing guard while I sleep, ever vigilant, spitefully waiting for a chance to catch me unawares and shock me. I know they\u0027re probably delusional projections. The six are shades of people I knew, whose deaths darkened the corridors of my mind. The spectral figures are almost certainly products of a guilty subconscious. But I wanted them to be real. I needed them to be real. So I opened myself up to the possibility that there\u0027s a life after death, and I\u0027ve been searching for proof of that ever since. The quest for answers has helped keep me sane. Or as sane as someone who sees ghosts can be! All of my novels focus on where ghosts come from, how they form, why they exist. In my first three I looked at how souls could be bound to this realm by magical or spiritual forces. This time I want to take a more scientific approach. I\u0027ve pretty much exhausted the mystical angles, at least for the time being. Time to travel down another route in search of something that might explain how and why my ghosts came to haunt me, that might provide me with the means to banish them from my line of sight, back to whatever dark holes the army of the dead rest up in. I really am vague about the plot. That wasn\u0027t a lie. I know I\u0027m going to focus on spontaneous human combustion - because it lets me explore the concept that ghosts might be the result of a violent, unnatural death - but I\u0027m not sure where I want to go with it. I\u0027m relying heavily on research for inspiration and direction. Right now I have no idea where it\u0027s going to lead me. We meet Pierre Vallance in his local Starbucks. At first we chat about the States. I\u0027ve noticed that lots of people here like to discuss America with me when they hear my accent. The media keeps telling us that the US has lost its standing as the world\u0027s foremost superpower, that China, India and Russia are taking over, but from what I\u0027ve experienced in my travels, America is still the place that everyone wants to talk about. When Pierre\u0027s had his fix of Stateside tittle-tattle, he tells us about his life as a sceptical medium. Pierre has heard voices all his life. He doesn\u0027t believe in ghosts, but became a medium so that he could explore (and exploit) his talent. Over time he came to the conclusion that his brain acted as an amplifier for electromagnetic signals which the people close to him were transmitting. \u0027When people think, their brains generate waves,\u0027 he explains, sipping an espresso. \u0027I somehow pick up on those signals and convert them into voices.\u0027 \u0027You mean you can read minds?\u0027 Joe asks, squinting nervously - I guess we all have dark secrets we want to hide from the world at large. Pierre shrugs. \u0027To an extent. I always explain to my clients that I\u0027m using science to help reveal the workings of their subconscious, but many choose to ignore me. They\u0027d rather believe in an afterlife and ghosts whispering through me. And since the customer\u0027s always right, I don\u0027t argue with them too strenuously.\u0027 I come away from our meeting intrigued. If Pierre can transform brain waves into voices, maybe there are others who can turn them into visions or physical objects. In such a world, almost anything is possible. That gives me a whole universe of ideas to play with. I breeze through the next week, plot lines clicking together neatly, my muse trilling like a diva. To my surprise, I enjoy working with Joe. Although I willingly took him on as an assistant, I wasn\u0027t convinced it was the right move, and I thought I\u0027d have to cut him loose sooner rather than later. But he\u0027s been a real asset. Without forcing me, he\u0027s got me talking more than I have in years. Usually I grunt when people ask me questions, instinctively cautious around strangers and even warier of those who try to get close to me, but with Joe I\u0027ve started stringing whole sentences together. I\u0027m not sure what it is about him. I just like the guy. He brings out a lighter, warmer part of me, a part I thought I\u0027d lost a long time ago. To reward him for helping me connect with my positive vibes, I tell Joe where my story has been leading me. The book is going to be a supernatural thriller. My central character dies of spontaneous human combustion, then returns as a ghost and embarks on a quest to unearth the truth behind his demise. \u0027A ghost out for revenge,\u0027 Joe beams. \u0027I like it!\u0027 Trying to decide on locations, I check out the infamous Whitechapel area, haunt of Jack the Ripper. It\u0027s as eerie now as it must have been back then. I\u0027d love to set my book there, but I\u0027m worried that readers might dismiss it as a Ripper cash-in. Brixton appeals to me more. You come up out of the Tube to find street preachers set among hawkers and homeless people trying to flog copies of the Big Issue. A dark atmosphere. Brixton Market feels like something out of a horror film, maze-like, roofed-over, claustrophobic. I could have my ghostly hero burst into flames outside the Tube station, in front of a preacher. I look around and imagine a burning man stumbling through the market, women screaming, men trying to extinguish the fire, the stench of scorched flesh. I grin ghoulishly. Sometimes this job requires me to explore the sickest of scenarios. That\u0027s why it\u0027s so much fun! To afford me a different taste of London, Joe has arranged a night out on the river. One of his friends is holding a party on a boat. There\u0027ll be a meal and a disco, and the boat will sail up and down the Thames into the early hours of the morning. I\u0027m not keen on parties, and at first I gave Joe the brush-off. But he persisted, said I\u0027d been working hard and that it would be good for me to let my hair down. In the end I agreed just to shut him up. I\u0027m shaving when my cell phone (they call them mobiles here) rings. It\u0027s Joe. \u0027You\u0027re gonna kill me,\u0027 he groans. \u0027I can\u0027t make it. My mam took ill. I\u0027m catching the next train to Newcastle.\u0027 \u0027Is it serious?\u0027 I ask, concerned. \u0027Hopefully not. Mam\u0027s had a couple of bad turns these last few years and seen them off. She\u0027ll probably be fine, but I need to be with her, just in case.\u0027 \u0027Of course. I understand completely. It\u0027s not a problem.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ll be back,\u0027 he says. \u0027Don\u0027t rush on my account,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027Will you still meet up with John Meyher?\u0027 Joe asks. Meyher\u0027s an expert in the field of spontaneous human combustion. He doesn\u0027t give many interviews, but Joe pulled a few strings. \u0027Of course,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027Unless you\u0027d rather I wait until you\u0027re back?\u0027 \u0027No need to do that,\u0027 he says, but he sounds pleased that I offered. \u0027What about tonight? Will you go to the party?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll probably give it a miss. I don\u0027t know any of your friends.\u0027 \u0027So introduce yourself to them.\u0027 \u0027Maybe. I\u0027ll see how I feel. I might just pop out for dinner and a walk instead.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be a miserable old sod,\u0027 Joe growls. \u0027Go!\u0027 He hangs up on me. I sit on the edge of the bed rubbing the smooth half of my face, considering the night ahead. Missing the party doesn\u0027t concern me, but I liked the idea of sailing along the Thames in the dark. I decide to go. Even if I don\u0027t mingle, I can have a few drinks, sit on deck, enjoy the fresh air and the sights. I might pick up some ideas. I finish shaving. Slap on aftershave and deodorant. I sit half-naked by the TV for an hour, flicking through the channels. Then I dress and head out. I avoid the grander hotels when I travel, but I don\u0027t like roughing it either. The Royal Munster is typical of my hotel of choice, old and faded, situated close to Earls Court, anonymous among the scores of other hotels in the area. Dusty doormen and bellboys, family-friendly, favoured by tourists rather than business executives. The doorman is a white-haired guy in his sixties who tips his hat to customers and addresses them with exaggerated formality. I\u0027ve told him to call me Ed, but he only nods and smiles, then hits me with a hearty \u0027Mr Sieveking, sir!\u0027 His name\u0027s Fred, but he prefers Mr Lloyd. \u0027Nice night to be heading out, Mr Sieveking,\u0027 he wheezes, hailing a cab. \u0027Care to join me, Mr Lloyd?\u0027 He chuckles. \u0027I would if I was off duty. I\u0027d take you to see people you could use in your books. I know a man in the Queen\u0027s Guard who puts mustard on everything he eats. And there\u0027s a . . . \u0027 He rattles on for a few minutes, but I make no move to halt him. I like listening to Fred. He\u0027s one of the world\u0027s great liars, full of outrageous stories. He pauses to catch his breath and I make my excuses. \u0027Have to be loving and leaving you, Mr Lloyd,\u0027 I say, slipping him a tip. \u0027Maybe I\u0027ll catch you on the way back,\u0027 he says. \u0027Only if you\u0027re a late bird,\u0027 I laugh. The taxi driver heads for the Chelsea Embankment when I tell him where I\u0027m going, then it\u0027s a quick journey parallel to the river and we\u0027re at the Victoria Embankment about ten minutes later. I stroll down the gangplank to the deck, where a pretty stewardess in a revealing naval uniform welcomes the guests. She asks for my name, checks her list, hands me a whistle, a paper hat and party poppers. She says I can have my picture taken with her kissing my cheek, for a reasonable rate. I refuse politely. I\u0027m a camera-shy guy. I prefer not to be photographed even when giving interviews, which annoys reporters. My agent often argues with me about it, but I don\u0027t want shots of me to be freely circulated. The meal doesn\u0027t start for another hour, so I make my way to the bar and order a beer. I don\u0027t want to drink too much, not on a boat, or I\u0027ll be throwing up all night. Alcohol and boats don\u0027t mix. I learnt that lesson the hard way on a cruise of the African coast many years ago. I\u0027m surrounded by young party animals, all of whom seem to be in select groups. A couple of teenagers waylay me and ask who I am, what I do, how I know the birthday girl. I explain my connection to Joe, but they don\u0027t know him. My job description draws more of a response. \u0027A writer!\u0027 they hoot, impressed. One says, \u0027I always wanted to be a writer. Do you make much money?\u0027 I spend a quarter of an hour trying to convince them that my books don\u0027t sell by the millions. They don\u0027t accept it. They insist that I must be fabulously well-to-do, on a par with Stephen King, even though they\u0027ve never heard of me. Finally I concede that yes, I\u0027m stinking rich, and yes, I wrote The Exorcist. With that settled, they roll away to tell their friends about me, with the unexpected result that hours later, long after I\u0027ve forgotten about them, an irate gentleman jabs an angry finger into my chest and grunts, \u0027You didn\u0027t write The Exorcist. That bloke Blatty did. You\u0027re a fraud.\u0027 Dinner\u0027s a simple affair - mashed potatoes and sausages, some unsavoury-looking carrots, cheap wine. The other guests go at it with conviction. Maybe I\u0027m fussy because I\u0027m getting on in years. The birthday girl is celebrating her twenty-first, and most of her friends fall into the same age bracket. It\u0027s been a long time since I saw twenty-one. As the paper plates are collected and disposed of, the tables are removed and the dance floor opens up. The DJ hasn\u0027t taken up his post yet, but someone sticks on a track and the more avid revellers writhe to the beat. I stand watching the dancers before it strikes me that this is a sign of seedy middle age - enviously ogling scantily clad girls while they strut their funky stuff - and I scuttle away in search of a refill. I prop up the bar for a couple of hours, eavesdropping on the conversation of strangers. Most people ignore me, but at one point a girl with a blond bob shows interest. She can\u0027t be more than twenty, way too young for a man with a receding hairline, but the beers have stripped me of a decade and I\u0027m thinking about what it would be like to take her back to the Royal Munster for a night of merry debauchery. That\u0027s when I\u0027m accused of fraud by the testy William Peter Blatty fan. In the ensuing embarrassing silence, my pretty admirer coughs, says she ought to be mingling more, wishes me well and hastily takes her leave. Ordering another beer, I decide I\u0027ve had enough of the bar and head for the deck. The fresh air revives me. I stand alone at the stern and study the trail of churning water we leave in our wake. Leaning across, I peer towards the bow, which is packed. A couple emerge up the stairs and glare at me. I think they want the stern to themselves. Too bad. I\u0027m not moving. Grumbling softly, they stand with their backs to me, making out. A few more stagger up over the next half-hour, but the area remains relatively clear, emptying when the DJ plays a popular number, slowly half-filling as tired legs force temporary retreats from the action. I\u0027m not a dancer. I keep a vigil on the riverbanks instead, casting a curious eye over a variety of buildings, old and new, decrepit and abandoned, or simply closed for the night, trying to find ways to incorporate them into the slowly forming plot of the novel. There are plenty of recognizable landmarks nestled in among the mix, the Tower of London, the Globe, Tate Modern, the Oxo tower, but I don\u0027t want to use any of those - too well known. My ghosts share the deck with me, glittering lightly against the backdrop of the night sky. Two of them are floating over the Thames, treading air as if it was the most natural thing in the world. They ignore the sights, their eyes, as ever, trained on me. The thin bald man with a sharp beard drifts through me, resulting in a momentary chill. I could recall his name if I wanted - I\u0027ll never forget their names - but I don\u0027t. I try not to dwell on their identities. It reminds me of my past and why they haunt me. As we pass the London Eye and the historic Houses of Parliament, I glance at the buildings across the way and notice a hospital. I ask a young man for its name. \u0027St Thomas\u0027s,\u0027 he says, staring at me as if I\u0027m mad for asking. The hospital interests me. I could use it in my book. Perhaps my central character rematerializes there. It\u0027s a logical spot for a ghost to turn up. I picture the scene as his eyes emerge from an ethereal fog, opening for the first time since his death. He gazes around, wondering where the hell he is. When he realizes it\u0027s a hospital, he relaxes. He remembers burning in Brixton and assumes he\u0027s been brought here to recover. Digging out my notebook (it goes everywhere with me), I jot down ideas. Calmly he tries turning - can\u0027t - looks down at his body - there\u0027s nothing there!!! Tries to scream - can\u0027t - no lungs! - fades away again. I like it. Later he re-forms, and this time he has a body and knows something is seriously wrong, although he doesn\u0027t yet accept that he\u0027s dead. While I\u0027m working on plot lines, a woman comes up the stairs and steps to the rail, close to where I\u0027m standing. She perches her wine glass on the rail, fingers lightly cupping the stem, and stares off into space. I study her out of the corner of my eye. Older than most of the guests, mid to late twenties. Light auburn hair, straight cut, pageboy fashion, long at the back. Slender build, tightly clad in a stunning black dress which reveals plenty of leg but little cleavage. Her fingernails have been painted silver and she wears soft silver tights. There\u0027s some sort of silver glitter around her eyes too, so the lids sparkle every time she blinks. I\u0027m paying attention to her because she\u0027s the first unaccompanied female I\u0027ve seen up here. The rest have been with boyfriends. Although I\u0027ve been concentrating on work, I now remember why Joe pressed me to come to the party - to unwind and have fun - and turn my thoughts to chat-up lines. I was never good at this kind of thing. I\u0027m not a natural charmer. Women are sometimes attracted to me because of the curt, moody front I present to the world, but I usually struggle if I\u0027m the one who has to do the chasing. While I\u0027m pondering my approach, destiny lends a hand. The woman sighs and rolls her head from side to side. Her hand twitches while she\u0027s not looking and she inadvertently knocks her wine glass overboard. She gasps, dives after it, misses. As it sails over the side, I lean across, fingers outstretched. I almost grab it - if I was the hero in one of my books, I\u0027d catch it - but it eludes me, plummets downwards and vanishes into the dark water of the Thames. \u0027Oh dear,\u0027 the woman says as I pull myself back from the rail. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 I smile. \u0027Not your fault,\u0027 she assures me, and glances around semi-guiltily. \u0027Do you think the crew saw?\u0027 \u0027I doubt it.\u0027 \u0027Maybe I should offer to pay for it just the same.\u0027 I laugh lightly. \u0027I\u0027m sure it happens all the time. A hazard of river life. Yours won\u0027t be the only glass lost to the tide tonight.\u0027 She relaxes and leans against the rail. \u0027I suppose you\u0027re right. I always panic when I break something. It\u0027s the way I was brought up.\u0027 She speaks in soft, measured tones. \u0027Are you American?\u0027 she asks. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Which part?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve travelled around a lot, but I live in Montana now.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve never been to Montana. It\u0027s somewhere I always meant to visit.\u0027 \u0027You should. It\u0027s spectacular.\u0027 We\u0027re standing, elbows to the rail, facing one another. She gives me a speculative once-over. I hold my gaze steady. \u0027Are you a friend of Shar\u0027s?\u0027 she asks. \u0027Shar?\u0027 I echo blankly. Then I remember the birthday girl. \u0027No. I\u0027m a FOAF.\u0027 \u0027A foaf?\u0027 She blinks, and her eyelids glitter silver confusion. \u0027FOAF - friend of a friend.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 She giggles. \u0027I thought you meant you were in the forces.\u0027 There\u0027s a moment of nice silence. \u0027I\u0027m a friend of Joe\u0027s,\u0027 I explain, not wanting to let the silence develop. \u0027Joe Rickard?\u0027 She shakes her head. \u0027I know hardly anyone here. I\u0027m a client of Shar\u0027s. She works in a beauty salon.\u0027 She drums her fingernails on the rail, then holds them up in the air and waves. \u0027Ta-da!\u0027 \u0027Did Shar paint those?\u0027 I ask. \u0027No. But she gave me the manicure.\u0027 She studies her nails and frowns. \u0027You don\u0027t think I went a bit heavy on the silver, do you? I thought it would look good under disco lights, but out here in the open . . . \u0027 I shrug. I like the way they look, but if I said so it\u0027d sound lame, like I was hitting on her. Which I am, but I don\u0027t want to be obvious about it. \u0027I\u0027m sorry I came,\u0027 she says, lowering her voice. \u0027Shar invited me, but she invited lots of her clients and I\u0027m about the only one who turned up. I think I was supposed to give her a card and a big tip and make my excuses.\u0027 There\u0027s another pause, during which we smile awkwardly at each other and try thinking of things to say. This time she breaks it by holding out a hand. \u0027Deleena Emerson.\u0027 \u0027Ed Sieveking,\u0027 I respond, touching my hand to hers. \u0027Pleased to meet you.\u0027 As our hands part I say, \u0027Deleena? I haven\u0027t heard that name before. Where does it come from?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not a real name,\u0027 Deleena says. \u0027Just something my mother thought up.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s nice. I like it.\u0027 \u0027Me too,\u0027 she says, and blushes sweetly. \u0027Ed Sieveking,\u0027 she murmurs, running the backs of her fingernails down her left cheek, as if trying to wipe the rosy glow away. \u0027Did you know there\u0027s a writer called Edward Sieveking?\u0027 I stare at her, momentarily thrown. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027A horror writer. Worth checking out if you like that sort of thing.\u0027 I\u0027m caught off guard. I\u0027m not used to strangers recognizing my name, unless it\u0027s at a convention. Deleena stares at me uncertainly as I gawp at her. I think about saying nothing, letting the moment pass. For some ridiculous reason I\u0027m almost ashamed to admit to my identity. But then I take a deep breath and squeeze it out. \u0027I\u0027m Edward Sieveking. The writer.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 she frowns, suspecting a joke. \u0027Yes,\u0027 I grin, gaining in confidence. \u0027You wrote Soul Vultures?\u0027 The disbelief - as if no mere mortal could have been responsible for such a wonderful book - makes me preen like a peacock. \u0027Yes,\u0027 I drawl. \u0027And Nights of Fear and Summer\u0027s Shades. I used to write under a pseudonym . . . \u0027 \u0027 . . . E.S. King!\u0027 she finishes, whooping with delight. \u0027That\u0027s how I discovered Summer\u0027s Shades. I mistook it for a Stephen King book. When I realized it wasn\u0027t, I decided I might as well buy it anyway, since there was nothing else I was interested in.\u0027 She covers her mouth with a hand. \u0027Oh, what an awful thing to say! Like I only bought your book because I was desperate.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s OK,\u0027 I laugh. \u0027I\u0027ll take any sale I can get.\u0027 Licking my lips, I fish blatantly for a compliment. \u0027Did you like it?\u0027 \u0027I bought the other two, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 she replies impishly. \u0027Actually, I wasn\u0027t too keen on Shades - I think it\u0027s your weakest - but it interested me enough to make me pick up Nights of Fear, then Soul Vultures when it came out.\u0027 She studies me again. \u0027This is weird. I\u0027ve met plenty of writers at parties and functions but I\u0027ve never bumped into one of my favourites by accident. And to think I was regretting coming.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t regret it any more?\u0027 I smile. \u0027No,\u0027 she says. \u0027I\u0027m only sorry I didn\u0027t know in advance that you\u0027d be here. I could have brought my books to be signed.\u0027 \u0027Maybe I can sign them for you another time,\u0027 I suggest. \u0027Maybe,\u0027 she agrees, eyes half-slit as she considers that. We talk about my books and what it\u0027s like to be a writer. As much as I love discussing my work, I try steering the conversation on to other topics a couple of times, afraid she\u0027ll think I\u0027m in love with myself. But she won\u0027t have it. She asks about sales and royalties, how long it takes to write a novel, how I research my stories. She\u0027s dismayed when she learns how little I make. \u0027That\u0027s terrible!\u0027 she cries, resting a sympathetic hand on mine. The heat almost moulds the flesh of my palm to the rail. \u0027I knew you weren\u0027t on the best-seller lists but I\u0027d no idea your sales were that poor.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re not that bad,\u0027 I demur. \u0027Those are actually pretty good figures. And sales have picked up a lot this last year or two.\u0027 \u0027Still,\u0027 she mutters, \u0027how can you afford to write full-time?\u0027 \u0027My parents left me an inheritance,\u0027 I lie, as I always do whenever that question is asked. \u0027And I was in business - computers - before striking out as an author. I\u0027ve enough set by to see me through the lean years. Besides, I can live frugally when I have to. Money isn\u0027t everything.\u0027 \u0027Nice to see someone dedicated to his craft,\u0027 she says. \u0027I don\u0027t know about dedication,\u0027 I respond modestly. \u0027I\u0027m just stubborn. I know I\u0027m not the world\u0027s greatest writer - not even its greatest horror writer - but I\u0027m determined to prove that I can make it, even if my books are lacklustre, thrill-free affairs, as one critic cruelly put it.\u0027 \u0027But they\u0027re not!\u0027 she exclaims, tightening her fingers over my knuckles, which melt with ecstasy at the pressure. \u0027You\u0027re a wonderful writer.\u0027 \u0027Oh stop.\u0027 I grimace, and lay my free hand over hers. \u0027How\u0027d you like to become my agent?\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s the starting salary?\u0027 \u0027Nothing.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll take it.\u0027 We laugh in chorus and my fingers link with hers. Deleena looks down at our hands and her laughter subsides. I half-unhook my fingers from hers. If she takes her hand away now, the moment will be spoiled and I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll find an excuse to leave. But to my delight she lets it lie where it is and gazes up at the underbelly of a bridge as we pass. We discuss her life. She works in the City for a private banking firm. Not the most interesting of jobs, she says, but the pay\u0027s good and so are the perks - trips abroad three or four times a year, regular hours, plenty of promotion opportunities. Deleena left school at sixteen and \u0027arsed about for a couple of years\u0027 before marrying an older gentleman a week after her eighteenth birthday. \u0027It was a mistake. I didn\u0027t love him, didn\u0027t even really like him. But he was a man of the world, he had a good CD collection, he was - \u0027 \u0027You married a man for his CDs?\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027Taste in music is very important,\u0027 she asserts. \u0027I could never get involved with anyone who listens to the Eagles or Rod Stewart.\u0027 \u0027What about Dire Straits and Bob Dylan?\u0027 I ask nervously. \u0027Dylan\u0027s a legend. Dire Straits . . . \u0027 She makes a so-so gesture. \u0027Acceptable?\u0027 \u0027Just about.\u0027 \u0027Phew.\u0027 I pretend to wipe sweat from my brow. The marriage lasted eight months. \u0027I hated him by the end, which was wrong, because I was the one who forced him to get married. I sat down with him a few years ago and we managed to put things straight. We\u0027re good friends now.\u0027 After the divorce, she ran home to her parents to sort out her head. Her mother convinced her to finish her education, which she did, earning three A levels at night class, then graduating with honours in business studies at university. She spent a couple of years in Europe brushing up on her languages - she speaks six and is working on Chinese - and fell into banking more by chance than design. Upon her return to London she went to work for one of the major banks, before being headhunted by her current employer four years ago. Piecing together her chronology as it unfolds, I realize she\u0027s older than I thought. When I ask delicately about her age, she laughs, taps her nose and says she won\u0027t see thirty again. I quiz her about current boyfriends. Nobody serious. There was a guy called Mark who she met while travelling across Europe. They were together for a few years. Only brief flings since then. Then it\u0027s my turn to spill the beans. I tell her a bit about my early life, how I was born in Chicago, moved to Seattle when I was six, then to Detroit when I was ten, when my father got a job there, back when they still made cars. I gloss over my pre-writing career, like I do when giving interviews, saying I worked in a variety of job across the States. I move on quickly to my more recent travels, the countries I\u0027ve visited over the last few years. Given all the travelling, she\u0027s convinced I have a girl in every port. I swear that isn\u0027t true and pretend my modest sex life is a choice. \u0027Sex by itself is nothing special,\u0027 I insist. \u0027It\u0027s not enough for bodies to touch - hearts and minds have to touch too.\u0027 She stares at me silently, solemnly, then explodes into laughter. \u0027Bullshitter!\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 I react with wounded innocence, but my smile gives me away. \u0027How many girls have you sweet-talked into bed with that one?\u0027 she jeers. \u0027Not as many as I\u0027d like,\u0027 I admit. \u0027No wonder. The sixties are a long time gone, flower boy. Get with the programme.\u0027 \u0027So educate me,\u0027 I encourage her. \u0027What am I saying wrong?\u0027 \u0027Everything. Ditch the lines. You don\u0027t need them. Be yourself.\u0027 \u0027OK.\u0027 I chance it. \u0027Despite the gruff front, I\u0027m a quiet, introspective guy. One might even say shy, if one was so inclined. I was married once but that went wrong and it hurt. I haven\u0027t committed to anyone since. I often think I\u0027m not meant for love, that I\u0027m destined to be alone.\u0027 \u0027Nobody\u0027s destined for loneliness,\u0027 she disagrees. \u0027People choose it or they don\u0027t. No one\u0027s saddled with it.\u0027 I could argue that one with her, but I shrug diplomatically and mutter, \u0027Maybe.\u0027 The serious turn in our conversation doesn\u0027t drain the night of its pleasure, but it sets us reflecting and we don\u0027t say much afterwards, just stand, hands joined, listening to the sounds of the disco, staring out over the flowing water of the darkly entrancing Thames.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-3.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
