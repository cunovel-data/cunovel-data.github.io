{"id":108116,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"I\u0027ve been sleeping quite well since I started seeing Deleena but I know tonight\u0027s going to be a bad one. Back in my hotel room, I dig the knife from the restaurant out of my pocket and study it solemnly. I\u0027m amazed by how quickly the old instincts kicked in. If we had been attacked, I\u0027d already played out various scenarios in my mind\u0027s eye, plotted my defensive strokes and our route of escape. The knife isn\u0027t the sharpest or sturdiest, but I\u0027d automatically accounted for that. In my hands it would have been an adequate weapon.\\n\\n I remember other nights and other knives. Drunken nights when I wept like a baby and held the tip of a knife before one of my eyes, wanting to drive it through my eyeball and deep into my brain, the ghosts egging me on, silently urging me to follow through and join them in their shady sub-world.\\n\\n They press closer towards me now, eagerly searching for any chink that they might be able to manipulate to their advantage. It doesn\u0027t matter if they\u0027re not real, if they\u0027re only projections of my inner turmoil. At times like this they present an all-too-real threat. They look so hateful. An observer who could see them would think I was a victim, a sympathetic figure under attack from malevolent forces.\\n\\n I know better. I deserve my ghosts. They\u0027re entitled to their spite.\\n\\n I lay the knife aside and sigh. \u0027Knock yourselves out,\u0027 I tell the disappointed spirits, then I start to get ready for bed and the nightmares that I\u0027m sure will find and torment me.\\n\\n Joe and I have been driving around, looking for places I might be able to use in the book. I\u0027m keen on the back streets which spread out from the oddly named Elephant and Castle. Very centrally located, yet many of the shabby old houses look like they\u0027re stuck in the past. The area has a grim, eerie feel to it. I take notes of street names, parks, schools, shops, deserted buildings.\\n\\n Joe is behind the wheel. He\u0027s moodier than usual, hasn\u0027t said much. Finally, once we\u0027ve wound up the scouting mission and have crossed the river, he says, \u0027Do you think you can use any of those places in the book?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Probably. I like the Elephant and Castle. Any idea where the name comes from?\u0027 Joe grunts negatively and takes a sharp, aggressive left turn. I study him curiously. \u0027How\u0027s your mother?\u0027 I ask.\\n\\n \u0027Fine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And work?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Same old.\u0027 He looks across at me. \u0027What\u0027s with the questions?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You seem out of sorts.\u0027\\n\\n He grunts again, then slows and finds a place to pull over. For a couple of minutes he doesn\u0027t say anything, and nor do I. In the end, he sighs. \u0027You\u0027re gonna hate me. I shouldn\u0027t say anything. I wasn\u0027t going to and I still don\u0027t know if I should.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s up, Joe?\u0027 I ask, worried now.\\n\\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t prying,\u0027 he says. \u0027I wasn\u0027t poking my nose in. I just . . . You remember I told you I\u0027d been asking my friends about Deleena?\u0027\\n\\n That wasn\u0027t what I\u0027d been anticipating. I thought he\u0027d been digging around in my past. I let out my breath and nod, relieved.\\n\\n \u0027I went to see Shar\u0027s boyfriend last night,\u0027 Joe says. \u0027He has an old VCR that was on the fritz. I asked Shar about Deleena. I was curious.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uh-huh.\u0027 I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s coming, but at least it has nothing to do with my past.\\n\\n Joe hesitates, then comes out with it. \u0027Shar doesn\u0027t know her.\u0027\\n\\n I digest the information, then seek clarification. \u0027Shar doesn\u0027t know Deleena?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She doesn\u0027t have a Deleena Emerson on her books. None of her clients even has a name like Deleena Emerson.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you describe Deleena to her? Maybe she uses another name when - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027How could I describe her?\u0027 he cuts in. \u0027I\u0027ve never seen her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh. Right.\u0027 I stare at the dashboard, bewildered.\\n\\n \u0027I should have kept my mouth shut,\u0027 Joe mumbles.\\n\\n \u0027No. You were right to tell me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What will . . . ?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Please. No questions. Just leave it with me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK.\u0027 He taps the steering wheel. \u0027You want to hang out here a while or go back to the hotel?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Back to the hotel.\u0027 I smile humourlessly. \u0027I\u0027ve got a date to prepare for.\u0027\\n\\n We meet in a pizza house. Deleena is a woman of varied tastes. A Michelin-starred restaurant one night, Burger King the next. I order a ham and mushroom pizza, Deleena opts for pepperoni. A bottle of house white.\\n\\n I\u0027ve been keeping conversation to a minimum. Deleena senses something wrong but pretends that all is normal. She tells me about her day at work and how much she enjoyed last night - we went to a beer festival and drank from massive wooden pitchers - and makes suggestions for tomorrow. I respond with sniffs and shrugs, waiting for her to get frustrated and force the issue.\\n\\n \u0027OK,\u0027 she finally says, laying down her knife and fork. \u0027What have I done?\u0027\\n\\n I finish the slice of pizza I was working on and wash it down with a mouthful of wine before replying. \u0027I know that you\u0027ve been lying to me.\u0027 Deleena stiffens but says nothing. \u0027Shar doesn\u0027t know you. You\u0027re not one of her clients.\u0027\\n\\n She rocks forwards and backwards, face neutral, hands on the table, fingers at rest. \u0027You can leave now if you want,\u0027 she offers. \u0027I\u0027ll take care of the bill.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going nowhere until you explain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why bother?\u0027 she says. \u0027If I\u0027ve lied once, I\u0027ll probably lie to you again. The wise thing would be to walk away, delete my number from your phone and hang up if you ever hear from me again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought about that. A week ago I might have. But now . . . \u0027 I want to reach across and shake answers from her, but I settle for a glare. \u0027Is Deleena even your real name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she says coolly. \u0027It\u0027s Andeanna. I am a client of Shar\u0027s - that much is true. Check with her. She\u0027ll recognize the name this time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why feed me an alias?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure you can guess. It\u0027s not especially complicated.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re married?\u0027 I ask, and she nods. That simple gesture almost drives me from the table and out of her life. Only her expression of utter misery holds me. \u0027Do you love him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Christ, Ed!\u0027 She laughs blackly.\\n\\n \u0027Do you love me?\u0027\\n\\n She\u0027s shaking now. Can\u0027t look me in the eye. Slides her hands under the table so I can\u0027t see them trembling. \u0027It\u0027s not as simple as that,\u0027 she croaks. \u0027There are things you don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So tell me.\u0027\\n\\n She raises her head. Tears are welling in her eyes. I ignore them and focus on her lips, reading the words as they form, alert for lies. \u0027You remember that man we ran into? Bond Gardiner?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s your husband?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Emerson is my maiden name. My married name is Menderes. My husband is - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mikis Menderes,\u0027 I interrupt, one jump ahead of her.\\n\\n She blinks, taken aback. \u0027You know him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mikis Menderes, aka the Turk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know who he is? What he is?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve read about him in the papers,\u0027 I lie\\n\\n \u0027He makes the papers in the States?\u0027 she frowns.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I correct myself, quickly tweaking my story. \u0027I read about him here, on one of my previous trips to the UK.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then you know why I\u0027ve been so afraid to get close to you,\u0027 she says. \u0027Why my heart beat with terror the first time we kissed. Why I didn\u0027t want to let things go any further. You know why you should walk away and never look back. Because if Mikis finds out about us . . . if he even suspects . . . \u0027\\n\\n She can\u0027t continue, and I can\u0027t think of anything to get her started again. We sit, staring at one another, until a waiter checks to see if we\u0027re finished. I nod, and he asks if we\u0027d like anything for dessert. \u0027No thank you,\u0027 I mumble, then pay up and escort Deleena - Andeanna, Mrs Menderes, wife of one of London\u0027s most notorious gangsters - outside into the uncertainty of the sultry, menacing night. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-6.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
