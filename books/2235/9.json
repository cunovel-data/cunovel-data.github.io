{"id":108119,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"A pattern develops over the next fortnight. Days spent working on the book with Joe, time moving with all the speed of a slug. Nights devoted to Andeanna, hours slipping away like minutes.\\n\\n I can\u0027t stop thinking about Andeanna, the Turk, the pressures he brings to bear on her, the restricted nature of our relationship. I fantasize about killing him, catching him alone and cutting the bastard down. But Andeanna told me that his bodyguards are always with him, except when he\u0027s at home. I\u0027d have a crack at him there if not for her. She\u0027d be with him. If she saw me kill him, she might hate me, even though it would mean her freedom. I can\u0027t risk that.\\n\\n I try to lose myself in work. Joe and I have come up with a name for our central character - Don Sanders. In the book, when Don comes back to life, he sets out to find answers to explain his return. If you want to learn more about life after death, you track down people who deal with the dead. So Joe and I set off on a trail of fortune-tellers and clairvoyants. I\u0027ve got the names and addresses of many reputable mediums - including Andeanna\u0027s friend Etienne Anders - but I don\u0027t pursue them. Instead, imagining ourselves in Sanders\u0027s shoes, we turn to the internet for leads, and our search engine results lead us from one merry fraud to another.\\n\\n In other research, I discover that spontaneous human combustion isn\u0027t confined to humans. There are reports of animals, furniture, books, all sorts of objects bursting into flames. I\u0027m not sure how to work that into the novel, so I\u0027ll just neglect to mention it. What the readers aren\u0027t told can\u0027t confuse them!\\n\\n Andeanna agrees to spend an evening with Joe and me. We\u0027ve nothing special planned - meet at a pub, go for a meal - but it\u0027ll be nice to get them together at last. We\u0027re due to meet at a quarter to eight. Joe and I arrive a few minutes early, order drinks and find a table in clear view of the door. Joe has dressed smartly and even came equipped with a tie. I told him not to be so formal, but he insisted on looking his best. \u0027I feel like a father waiting to grant approval of his son\u0027s fiancee,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Eight comes and goes. No sign of Andeanna. I don\u0027t worry. She\u0027s a woman, so I hardly expect her to be on time. But when nine o\u0027clock ticks by, I\u0027m sweating. She can\u0027t have got the pub wrong - we\u0027ve been here before - but maybe we got our times mixed up. I ring her cell phone, but it\u0027s switched off.\\n\\n Joe\u0027s mood darkens before mine. He was telling loads of terrible jokes earlier, but they\u0027ve dried up and he\u0027s tight-lipped now. Even though he doesn\u0027t know her, he guesses the truth before I do - she isn\u0027t coming. He doesn\u0027t say anything, but I can see by the way he keeps looking around that he\u0027s embarrassed. Finally, with ten o\u0027clock looming, I try her cell again, then give up. \u0027She\u0027s blanked us.\u0027\\n\\n Joe sighs with relief at having the truth out in the open. \u0027Maybe she was delayed,\u0027 he says diplomatically. \u0027Traffic. A puncture. An accident.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. She stood us up. She\u0027s gone out of her way to avoid meeting you. I don\u0027t know why, but she has. She told me she\u0027d be here tonight, but I don\u0027t think she ever meant to come.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why would she be anxious to avoid me?\u0027 Joe asks, startled.\\n\\n I frown, considering it. \u0027Maybe you know her. She said her maiden name was Emerson, but maybe she lied. Hell, Andeanna might an alias too. It wouldn\u0027t be the first false name she\u0027s given me.\u0027\\n\\n Joe tugs at his beard. \u0027You really think I might know her?\u0027\\n\\n I shrug. \u0027Probably not. Maybe you\u0027re right - she could have been delayed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure.\u0027 Joe beams encouragingly. \u0027She\u0027ll most likely ring any minute now and clear things up. We\u0027ll be laughing about this by the end of the night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I say, not believing it for a second.\\n\\n I down more rum than I should. Joe looks on worriedly and suggests it might be for the best if we drink up and leave. My nasty streak coming to the fore, as it sometimes does when I drink too much, I sneer at his worries and tell him to lighten up. I urge him to take off his stifling shirt. When that suggestion upsets him - maybe he thinks I want to mock his scars - I make a bullying grab for the top buttons. He loses patience and storms out, saying I can follow if I want, or stay and rot.\\n\\n \u0027Fuck him,\u0027 I growl, tossing back another shot of rum. Then I forget about Joe. Andeanna\u0027s treachery consumes my thoughts. I\u0027ve started thinking of things I could do to hurt her - maybe call Mikis and drop a few hints about his wife\u0027s indiscretions - when I spot a girl staring at me. \u0027Help you?\u0027 I snap.\\n\\n She turns away and says something to the two girls with her. All three glance at me, giggle and return to their drinks. I keep watch on the one who first caught my eye. She doesn\u0027t look more than eighteen or nineteen, dark blond hair, lots of make-up. She has nothing in common with Andeanna except her gender, but I convince myself otherwise and pretend she\u0027s my beloved\u0027s spitting image.\\n\\n I wait until one of the trio heads for the toilet, then slide over and take her seat. As the others start to object, I raise my hands, smooth as silk now that I\u0027m half-steamed. \u0027It\u0027s OK, ladies, I\u0027m not stopping, I\u0027d just like to apologize for my rudeness earlier.\u0027 I smile broadly, and the pretty young blonde smiles back.\\n\\n \u0027Are you American?\u0027 she asks.\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027New York?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, but I know the city well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have a brother in New York,\u0027 she informs me. \u0027I\u0027m going over for a visit next month.\u0027\\n\\n Her friend returns and I swiftly vacate her seat. \u0027Would any of you care for a drink?\u0027 I ask. They all place an order and I shuffle off to the bar. Handing out the cocktails when I get back, I murmur as sexily as I can, \u0027My name\u0027s Ed. Could I have yours?\u0027\\n\\n After checking with her friends, who give her the nod to show they think it\u0027s OK to speak with the tall American, the blonde tells me her name is Louise Maloret and she\u0027s from Kent but is currently living in Roehampton, studying to be a teacher. The address rings a bell and I recall John Meyher. Excited by the coincidence, I tell her I was out her way recently. When she asks why, I let her have it. \u0027Research. I\u0027m a writer. Ed Sieveking. You may have heard of me?\u0027 I don\u0027t grow discouraged when she says that she hasn\u0027t. Instead I say I\u0027m big in the States. \u0027Your brother\u0027s probably read my books.\u0027\\n\\n A fourth chair soon materializes - nothing\u0027s too much for a famous American author! - and it isn\u0027t long before I\u0027m spinning yarns that would make Pinocchio blush. Stephen King? Sure I know him. Have they read his latest novel? They haven\u0027t? Oh, they should. I\u0027m mentioned in it. \u0027A character\u0027s reading one of my books,\u0027 I chuckle modestly. \u0027I\u0027ll have to return the favour, keep Steve happy.\u0027\\n\\n They\u0027re more interested in movie stars than writers. I tell them that two of my books are being adapted, and of course then I have to name all the actors who\u0027ve been linked with the imaginary films.\\n\\n The girls drag me to a nightclub when the pub closes. After a couple of painful numbers on the dance floor, I hurry to the toilet and throw up. I feel better after that, and better still when someone in the next cubicle offers me some Charlie at a good price. I don\u0027t normally do drugs, but the spirit of the night takes me, and by the time I track down Louise, I\u0027m wide-eyed and jerking convulsively to the beat. This time, when we get on the dance floor, there\u0027s no stopping me. I hold Louise captive for most of the night, a true party animal.\\n\\n Later on I find myself locking lips with the girl in a niche near the cloakroom. I don\u0027t know how we got here - the last hour or so is a blank. Between kisses I suggest we slip back to the Royal Munster. After some hesitation - she doesn\u0027t want me thinking she\u0027s easy - she agrees, but first goes to tell her friends where I\u0027m taking her. I start to feel guilty while I\u0027m waiting for her to return, thinking about Andeanna. Another shot of rum helps drive the guilt away.\\n\\n In my room I throw Louise on to the bed and practically rip off her clothes. She stops me as I\u0027m pulling down my trousers, panting like a horny dog. \u0027Hold on a sec.\u0027 Rising, she empties the contents of her purse and finds a cache of condoms. Tearing one open, she tells me to put it on.\\n\\n \u0027Anything to please,\u0027 I mumble, sliding it over my erection.\\n\\n \u0027You speak funny,\u0027 she laughs, then turns off the light.\\n\\n Sex is swift. As I thrust blindly into her, I moan, \u0027Andeanna!\u0027 Louise overlooks the slip and yells my name out loud. I clutch her tightly and grind into her, lips pulled back over my teeth, sweating like crazy from the mix of sex, drink and cocaine. It isn\u0027t long before I climax with a groaning shudder, porn-star style. Louise lets rip with a considerate fake groan.\\n\\n In the aftermath she peels off the condom and wraps it up neatly in a tissue. \u0027You\u0027d better keep this,\u0027 she says. \u0027Safer that way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 I pant, needing a glass of water but not trusting my legs to support me if I get up.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a famous writer,\u0027 she giggles. \u0027I could slip in some seed and hit you with a paternity suit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Christ! Is that what they teach you in university these days?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. It\u0027s what my mum taught me.\u0027\\n\\n We fall asleep chuckling.\\n\\n Louise is already up when I wake with a hangover that isn\u0027t as bad as I thought it would be. She bounces around in the buff, examining the hotel room. She tells me about her digs, the students she shares with, the awful state of the kitchen, their landlord from hell. Typical student troubles.\\n\\n After breakfast we shower, dress, swap numbers and kiss goodbye. Louise says I don\u0027t have to call her if I don\u0027t want to. I say that I will but I don\u0027t mean it. By her relieved smirk, I know she knows it\u0027s a lie, so I don\u0027t feel guilty.\\n\\n I also don\u0027t feel guilty for what I\u0027ve done. I should - I\u0027ve betrayed the woman I pledged my heart to - but I don\u0027t. Thinking about that after Louise has left, and the normal night of fun we shared, I realize it\u0027s because life with Andeanna is so abnormal. Why should I feel guilty for cheating on a married woman who can offer me nothing but kisses?\\n\\n I love Andeanna, and I think she could love me if the circumstances were different, but right now we aren\u0027t a good match. She\u0027s trapped and I can\u0027t help her break out of the prison of the Turk\u0027s making. One of us needs to stand up big and break this off before we destroy ourselves.\\n\\n I\u0027m going home to Montana.\\n\\n Joe\u0027s face drops when I tell him I\u0027m quitting London. \u0027What about the book?\u0027 he splutters.\\n\\n I shrug. \u0027I\u0027ll work on it from home. I\u0027ll keep in touch with you. It shouldn\u0027t make much of a difference now that we\u0027ve put in most of the legwork. I can work better in Montana. Fewer distractions.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mean Andeanna,\u0027 he says quietly. \u0027Is she the reason you\u0027re going back?\u0027\\n\\n I see no point in lying. \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have you told her?\u0027 he asks.\\n\\n I shake my head.\\n\\n \u0027Are you going to?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I sigh. \u0027I\u0027d like to see her one last time, but I haven\u0027t been able to contact her. I\u0027m booked to fly out early tomorrow, so it - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tomorrow! Why so soon? Jesus, Ed, I know you\u0027ve been unhappy, but running away like this . . . Are you sure it\u0027s a good idea?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d have gone today except I wanted to talk with you first and clear the air. I acted like a dick the other night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Forget it. We all do stupid things when we\u0027re drunk.\u0027 Joe sits back and looks around at the cases I\u0027ve packed, one for my clothes, two for the notes, maps and research material. \u0027You\u0027re really going,\u0027 he says glumly.\\n\\n \u0027Afraid so.\u0027\\n\\n He sighs. \u0027I\u0027m not too surprised. I sensed things weren\u0027t working between you and Andeanna.\u0027 He thinks for a minute, then says, \u0027I could go see her if you want, take a message, give her your address.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why bother?\u0027 I scowl.\\n\\n \u0027It isn\u0027t nice to slip away without saying farewell. Besides, I\u0027d like to meet this beauty you\u0027ve been bragging about.\u0027\\n\\n I squint suspiciously. \u0027You\u0027re not thinking of making a move on her when I\u0027m out of the way, are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Certainly not!\u0027 he howls. \u0027Ed, how can you even think such a - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Joking,\u0027 I smile.\\n\\n \u0027That wasn\u0027t funny,\u0027 he sniffs.\\n\\n \u0027Sure it was,\u0027 I chuckle, then shake my head fondly. I\u0027ll miss Joe. My smile fades. Maybe as much as I\u0027ll miss Andeanna.\\n\\n I almost don\u0027t phone her. As day turns to night, I argue the decision with myself. She\u0027s the one who broke our appointment. If she cared, she\u0027d call. But what if I\u0027ve misjudged her? Maybe she did have an accident. What if she\u0027s been in a crash or a fire or . . .\\n\\n Eventually, knowing I won\u0027t be able to rest easy if I don\u0027t attempt to make contact, I try her cell phone again. This time it rings. I disconnect before she can answer. I\u0027m shaking. What will I say? Should I be cruel or compassionate? I\u0027m not experienced in scenes of this nature. Finally I hit redial and let the conversation take its own course.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 Her voice is low, trembling, pained.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s me.\u0027\\n\\n A long silence. \u0027I didn\u0027t think you were going to call.\u0027 She sounds like she\u0027s been crying.\\n\\n \u0027I almost didn\u0027t. I\u0027m leaving tomorrow, going home to Montana.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 she says emotionlessly.\\n\\n \u0027Is that all you can say?\u0027 I snap.\\n\\n She sighs. \u0027I\u0027m tired, Ed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What sort of an answer is that? For Christ\u0027s sake, I\u0027m leaving! You\u0027ll never see me again, and all you can say - \u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s a click. Staring at the phone, I realize she\u0027s cut me off. My initial reaction is to hurl it away and let her go hang. Then I consider the way she spoke, the tremble in her voice. Something\u0027s wrong. Redialling, I walk to the window and gaze out at the quiet road, letting the calm of the external world wash through me. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 I mutter when she answers. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean to get angry. I\u0027m upset. Not thinking straight.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That makes two of us,\u0027 she half laughs, then chokes back a sob. \u0027Are you really leaving?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Unless you can convince me to stay.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want you to go,\u0027 she says in a monotone. \u0027But as for convincing you . . . \u0027 I sense her shrugging. \u0027I can\u0027t think of anything to say that would keep you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why did you stand me up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a long story.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Has it got something to do with Joe?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Joe?\u0027 She sounds confused.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re avoiding him. Every time I set up a meeting, you . . . \u0027\\n\\n Sardonic laughter cuts me short. \u0027It has nothing to do with Joe,\u0027 she sneers. \u0027Your friend was the last thing on my mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why didn\u0027t you show?\u0027\\n\\n She pauses, then whispers, \u0027I love you.\u0027 That\u0027s followed by tears. \u0027I have to hang up now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Andeanna! No!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye, Ed. I\u0027ll read your new book when it comes out. I\u0027m sure it will be - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m coming to see you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027 she gasps. \u0027You mustn\u0027t, it isn\u0027t safe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m coming.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I won\u0027t let you in. I\u0027ll keep the gate locked. I\u0027ll summon Mikis.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That won\u0027t stop me. I\u0027m not leaving until I find out what happened. If I have to go through the Turk to get to you, I will.\u0027\\n\\n She moans, then sniffles. \u0027You\u0027re being a damn fool, but OK, come if you must. Wait until you see the gate open and a car leaving. Axel\u0027s on duty tonight. I think I can persuade him to pop out, like when you came before. But if he won\u0027t go - if you don\u0027t see a car pulling out - promise me you won\u0027t come in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve got to see you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you don\u0027t promise, I\u0027ll be gone when you get here.\u0027\\n\\n I rest the phone against my forehead, then lower it and answer in as controlled a tone as possible, \u0027OK. I promise.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you break your word, it\u0027s over between us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know me better than that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. I do. See you soon. I hope.\u0027\\n\\n I park fifty yards from the turn-off to the mansion. It\u0027s a clear night. I can\u0027t fail to spot any exiting vehicles from here. Switching off the lights and crouching low, I keep vigil.\\n\\n An hour passes. Two. Three. Patience has always been one of my virtues. I\u0027ve sometimes spent a week shadowing people, sitting quietly in hotel rooms or cars, watching, waiting. I was never nervous then, but I am now. My hands are shaking.\\n\\n Finally, close to one in the morning, the gates open and a car emerges. I throw myself sideways before the driver completes his turn. He passes by moments later, picking up speed, engine loud in the still of the night. I give it half a minute, then sit up and make the call.\\n\\n \u0027Ed?\u0027 Andeanna answers on the first ring, breathless.\\n\\n \u0027A car just passed. Axel?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. He should be gone twenty, maybe thirty minutes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have you turned off the CCTV?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. I\u0027ll delete the footage from the hard drive later. There isn\u0027t time to go fiddling with it now.\u0027\\n\\n I don\u0027t like the sound of that, but I have to trust her.\\n\\n \u0027You want me to drive in or walk?\u0027 I ask.\\n\\n \u0027Drive and park round back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about getting out again?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve spent the last few hours in the music room, listening to classical records. You can hide when Axel returns. I\u0027ll take him in there. He won\u0027t hear you leave.\u0027\\n\\n Again, I don\u0027t like it. I think it would be less risky if I left the car where it is, but I don\u0027t want to start an argument, in case she changes her mind and forbids me entry. So I go with her call and hope she knows what she\u0027s doing.\\n\\n The gates are opening again when I reach them. I glide through, take a sharp left at the end of the driveway, then a right around the building. Once I\u0027m parked in the shadows, I leave the keys in the ignition and look for Andeanna. She isn\u0027t here, but one of the doors is open.\\n\\n I enter a huge, cool pantry. I expected Andeanna to meet me, but she\u0027s nowhere to be seen. I pad cautiously through the pantry and kitchen, not turning on any lights, finding my way through the darkness by touch. When I reach the door to the main hall, which is brightly lit, I take stock of the situation.\\n\\n This feels wrong. Why hasn\u0027t Andeanna come to greet me? For all I know, the Turk is lying in wait beyond this door, about to spring a trap. One more step could be my last. It\u0027s not too late to retreat. Unless guards have closed in behind me, the route is clear. I could crash through the gates, hit the road at full speed and slow for nothing. To push ahead is suicidal.\\n\\n My ghosts sense my uncertainty and press close around me, making spitting gestures, shrieking silently, doing their best to unnerve me and force me back.\\n\\n Thinking of Andeanna and the fear in her voice, I ignore the ghosts, turn a deaf ear to reason and advance.\\n\\n The hall is clear. No Mikis Menderes. No Bond Gardiner. No armed guards. Just emptiness and silence.\\n\\n \u0027Andeanna?\u0027 Her name echoes back. I move to the foot of the stairs, determined to go no further unless she returns my call. \u0027Andeanna?\u0027 When she doesn\u0027t answer, I start up, ignoring my vow to myself. The ghosts dart around me, doing their best to freak me out. They\u0027re loving this, more animated than they\u0027ve been in a long time.\\n\\n There are footsteps behind me. I turn quickly, hand reaching for a gun which isn\u0027t there, then relax when I spot Andeanna emerging out of the gloom of a dining room.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 she says, stopping in the doorway, hands crossed nervously over her abdomen. \u0027I was watching for Axel, afraid he might forget something and return.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You startled me,\u0027 I smile, stepping down towards her, through the phalanx of scowling ghosts. \u0027I thought . . . \u0027 I come to a halt. Andeanna hasn\u0027t moved into the light, but now that I\u0027m closer, I can see more clearly. Her face is a mess. Bruises on her cheeks and forehead. Split lips. Black, puffy eyelids. \u0027Jesus,\u0027 I whisper.\\n\\n \u0027Pretty, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 A hand sneaks to her left cheek and one of the larger bruises. \u0027Nothing broken, thank God. None of the cuts needed stitches. I\u0027ll be OK in a week or two.\u0027 A thin smile. \u0027Maybe three.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Turk?\u0027 I ask, and she nods. \u0027He knows about us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. I\u0027d be dead if he did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why . . . ?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come here,\u0027 she says, backing up. I follow reluctantly. When I get there, she\u0027s reclining on a couch. She pats the space beside her. As I sit, she lays a hand on my knee and leans forward to kiss me. Winces and stops. \u0027Sorry. It hurts.\u0027\\n\\n She slips into silence. I study her, appalled. I\u0027m glad it\u0027s dark. The shadows mask the worst of the damage.\\n\\n \u0027I wanted to ring you but I couldn\u0027t. Yesterday I was in no shape to talk - you should see the state of my ribs - and today I was penned in by guards. It was lucky you rang when you did - Axel was in the toilet. I was about to call you. Strange, the timing. Maybe we\u0027re telepathic.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why did he do it?\u0027 I snarl.\\n\\n \u0027A poem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d booked in to see Etienne before meeting with you and Joe,\u0027 she explains. \u0027Etienne Anders, the mystic I told you about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What does she have to do with this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She read my fortune.\u0027 Andeanna\u0027s cracked smile tears at my heart. \u0027She predicted wonderful times, happiness, companionship. She doesn\u0027t know who my husband is, but she\u0027s always been able to sense my sadness. This was the first time she\u0027d made such promises. She said there was a new man in my life and he\u0027d care for me, love me if I let him, and everything would work itself out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wise woman,\u0027 I remark, managing a sickly grin.\\n\\n \u0027I came home on a high,\u0027 she continues. \u0027I practically floated in the door and started getting ready. I wanted to make a good impression on Joe. In the middle of shaving my legs, I put my razor aside and jotted down the beginning of a silly poem that popped into my head.\\n\\n \u0027My lover\u0027s kiss is like a drill,\\n\\n His heart supplies its power.\\n\\n Resistance he is quick to kill,\\n\\n And my love he devours.\u0027\\n\\n She pulls a face. \u0027Woeful, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard worse,\u0027 I smile. \u0027But not often.\u0027\\n\\n Her expression twists. \u0027I was working on the second verse when Mikis sneaked up on me. Before I could stop him, he\u0027d ripped the poem away. He lost his head. Screamed and demanded to know the name of my lover. I told him it was about him, something I\u0027d made up for fun, remembering our early days together, but he wouldn\u0027t listen. It infuriated him. He . . . \u0027 She points vaguely to her face.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll kill him,\u0027 I growl.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t start that again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He did all this because of a fucking poem?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s Mikis. It would have been worse if I\u0027d finished it. I was going to mention your name in the third or fourth verse, intending to give it to you later.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The bastard.\u0027 I wish I had him here, where I could lay my hands on him.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she sighs. \u0027His suspicions were justified this time. The poem was about an actual lover. I convinced him in the end that it wasn\u0027t - he beat me so badly, he was sure I was telling the truth, that I couldn\u0027t lie in the face of such a thrashing - but, to be fair, I brought this on myself.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s a point I could debate sourly, but I don\u0027t. Instead I get to my feet and say firmly, \u0027Come on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where?\u0027 she asks, alarmed.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re leaving. I\u0027m taking you with me. If we can\u0027t book you on to my flight to Montana, we\u0027ll take the next one. Pack what you can\u0027t live without and don\u0027t forget your passport.\u0027\\n\\n She shakes her head. \u0027Sit down. We\u0027re not going anywhere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are,\u0027 I insist. \u0027I\u0027m not leaving you here in the hands of that son of a bitch. I can hide you, arrange fake papers. We\u0027ll change our names and move on. He won\u0027t find us. And if he does, he\u0027ll regret it. You\u0027ll be safe with me, Andeanna. I swear, on all that\u0027s sacred, I\u0027ll protect you.\u0027\\n\\n She stares at me, taken aback. \u0027I think you mean it,\u0027 she murmurs.\\n\\n \u0027Bet the Crown Jewels I do.\u0027 I grin and offer her my hand. \u0027Let\u0027s go.\u0027\\n\\n She reaches towards me. Stops. \u0027No,\u0027 she whispers. \u0027I can\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can!\u0027 I shout, and she flinches. Lowering my voice, I kneel beside her. \u0027Is it because you\u0027re afraid?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Partly,\u0027 she says, starting to cry. The ghosts pull sad faces and wipe crocodile tears away. I don\u0027t let them distract me. \u0027But even if I wanted to leave, I\u0027m in no shape to go on the run. Just walking around the house is an effort.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll manage. We can hire a wheelchair. Hell, I\u0027ll carry you if I have to.\u0027\\n\\n She touches my lips to silence me. \u0027You\u0027re thinking crooked. How will we cover our tracks if I\u0027m confined to a wheelchair or slung over your shoulder? People will notice us. Mikis will track down those people and find out where we went. It isn\u0027t possible, not now, not tonight.\u0027\\n\\n Those last four words fill me with hope. \u0027But you will come?\u0027 I ask, seizing her hands. \u0027Soon, when you\u0027re able?\u0027\\n\\n She nods hesitantly. \u0027I think so. Mikis has hurt me before, but never like this. I really thought he was going to kill me. Do you know what went through my mind?\u0027 I look at her questioningly. \u0027I wished I\u0027d let you fuck me.\u0027 She blushes behind the clouds of dark purple bruises. \u0027That was my only regret. I was sorry I hadn\u0027t made the most of you when I had the chance. That was when I realized how much I love you and how I can\u0027t go on without you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Andeanna,\u0027 I groan.\\n\\n She strokes my chin and kisses me. This time she doesn\u0027t wince. \u0027We\u0027ll make plans,\u0027 she says. \u0027We have time. Mikis hates me, but that can work in our favour. I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll come to see me any time soon. The guards are a problem, but I can ring you when the chance arises. Maybe you can find sleeping pills and slip them to me. I often cook for the guards, so I could - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Greygo! Where are you?\u0027\\n\\n We swivel as if on springs. Through the door we see a man standing in the hall, hands on hips, looking up the stairs. My first thought is that it\u0027s the Turk, and I welcome the intrusion, but then Andeanna hisses, \u0027Axel!\u0027\\n\\n Whether he hears her or just senses our presence, the guard turns and spots us. Frowning, he starts forward. \u0027Who\u0027s there?\u0027 he asks, squinting into the darkness.\\n\\n I have maybe four or five seconds before he\u0027s upon us. Reacting calmly, as I did in the restaurant when I thought we might be attacked, I look for a weapon. There are vases on a shelf, but they\u0027re small, fragile, useless.\\n\\n Andeanna stiffens. \u0027If he sees us, it\u0027s over. He\u0027ll tell Mikis. He\u0027ll . . . \u0027\\n\\n The guard reaches the doorway and stops. \u0027Who\u0027s there?\u0027 he barks. \u0027Greygo? Are you with a woman?\u0027\\n\\n While my eyes search for something to defend myself with, Andeanna stands and walks towards the guard. \u0027Hello, Axel. Greygo\u0027s not here. Can I help?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What the fuck?\u0027 the guard mutters, staring at Andeanna. He takes a step back and stumbles over a telephone cable which hasn\u0027t been tacked to the wall. That\u0027s my weapon.\\n\\n Leaping to my feet, I dart past Andeanna, lowering my head as I charge. The guard\u0027s eyes flicker towards me, but then, even though he must know I\u0027m a threat, they return to Andeanna. Taking advantage of his confusion, I barrel into him and knock him flat to the floor. The air explodes out of him in a huff. His hand goes for his gun, but I\u0027m too fast. Grasping his wrist, I elbow him between the eyes with my free arm.\\n\\n As Axel\u0027s head snaps backwards, I drag him to the door, grab the telephone cable, loop it round his throat, take firm hold of the cord with both hands, dig my right knee into the small of his back and pull. The guard\u0027s eyes bulge as the cable cuts into the flesh of his throat. He slaps at my hands and jerks at the noose. No good. The loop tightens. He\u0027s at my mercy. And I have none.\\n\\n Andeanna screams as the guard\u0027s legs thrash. The stench of released faeces hits the air. His hands claw at mine, nails scratching my lower arms. His tongue sticks out obscenely. His teeth grind down on it, drawing blood, then peel apart as he seeks the elusive breath which might restore his vitality.\\n\\n The ghosts writhe with delight and applaud grotesquely. This is what they want, me shedding my respectable charade, giving in to my baser instincts, damning myself. They think that violence will unhinge my senses and leave me vulnerable, in their clutches. They might be right, but I can\u0027t let that stop me.\\n\\n I concentrate on the cable, driving my knee down into Axel\u0027s back, pinning him to the floor, making sure my sweaty fingers don\u0027t slip, not letting myself forget that he has a gun and needs only the slightest opportunity to reverse our situations.\\n\\n Wicked choking sounds. His palms slap flatly on the floor. His body goes limp as he passes out. If I release him now, he\u0027ll revive in the morning, bruised, maybe mute for a few days, but alive. I want to free him. I don\u0027t enjoy killing. But he\u0027s seen us together. He\u0027d tell the Turk. It\u0027s us or him.\\n\\n I relax my grip on the cable, let the loop loosen, wipe my hands on the thighs of my trousers, take hold of the cable again. I maintain the pressure for a long minute before letting go and stepping away from the corpse.\\n\\n Andeanna approaches, hands clasped as if in prayer, fingertips to her lips. She walks around the lifeless body, then stares at me, terrified. \u0027You killed him,\u0027 she whispers.\\n\\n \u0027I had to.\u0027 She stares at my hands, which are only trembling slightly. I\u0027d like to talk her through this, but there isn\u0027t time. The guard wasn\u0027t calling her name. He was looking for her son. \u0027Where\u0027s Greygo?\u0027 I ask.\\n\\n \u0027You strangled him,\u0027 she says, ignoring me, captivated by the corpse.\\n\\n \u0027He called for Greygo. Is your son here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You killed him. Just throttled him until . . . \u0027\\n\\n I raise a hand to slap her, then think of her bruises and lower it. Grasping her shoulders, I shake her lightly. \u0027Andeanna!\u0027 Her eyes snap into focus and fix on mine. \u0027Is Greygo here?\u0027\\n\\n She considers the question carefully before replying. \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why was the guard calling his name?\u0027\\n\\n She frowns. Her gaze darts towards the body, but I step in front of her, blocking her view, forcing her to concentrate. She shakes her head. \u0027I\u0027m not sure. I didn\u0027t think he was home. But I\u0027ve been in the music room all night. Maybe . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027We have to check.\u0027 I turn to the guard and search for his gun, which I find strapped to his side in a sleek leather holster.\\n\\n Andeanna gasps when she sees me holding the pistol. \u0027No! I won\u0027t let you harm Greygo. He\u0027s my son. You\u0027re not going to - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is for protection only. I might club him over the head with the butt if I have to, but I won\u0027t shoot him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you kill my child . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know. Now let\u0027s go see if we can find him.\u0027\\n\\n I help her up the stairs. Her legs are weak and she has to lean on me much of the way. Watching someone die is never easy. Watching someone being murdered is harder still. I\u0027d let her rest if I could, but if her son\u0027s upstairs he has to be neutralized. If we\u0027re lucky, he\u0027ll be sleeping and we can lock him in his room. If luck\u0027s against us, I\u0027ll try to knock him out. I don\u0027t want to hurt him. I know that Andeanna would never forgive me if I did.\\n\\n I ask her to call his name when we reach the landing. Her first attempt is a brittle croak. Swallowing, she tries again. \u0027Greygo.\u0027 No answer. \u0027Greygo! Are you here?\u0027 The silence is absolute.\\n\\n \u0027His room,\u0027 I whisper. She leads the way, walking stiffly, and pauses by the door, unwilling to open it. Pushing past her, I turn the handle and slide into a cool, dark room. The curtains are open. The bed\u0027s unoccupied. Nobody home. \u0027Where else could he be?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think he\u0027s here. He\u0027d have checked in with me if he\u0027d come back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But if he was here, where would he be?\u0027\\n\\n She shrugs. \u0027The pool room, maybe.\u0027\\n\\n We proceed cautiously. Andeanna observes me silently. I don\u0027t know what she\u0027s thinking, but I doubt it\u0027s anything positive. The ghosts are still cavorting madly, as if dancing on hot coals. This is the most excitement they\u0027ve had in years. They\u0027re eager for more. Even the little girl is bloodthirsty, wanting to see me kill again, condemning myself to more guilt, suffering and madness.\\n\\n The lights are on in the pool room but nobody\u0027s present. I sniff the air for traces of aftershave or smoke. Nothing. Only chalk dust.\\n\\n \u0027He isn\u0027t here,\u0027 Andeanna says with relief.\\n\\n \u0027Are there any other rooms where . . . ?\u0027\\n\\n She shakes her head firmly. \u0027He isn\u0027t home.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re certain?\u0027\\n\\n She nods. \u0027We can check if his car\u0027s in the garage, but I know it won\u0027t be. We\u0027d have run into him by now if he was here.\u0027\\n\\n She\u0027s probably right, but I make her take me to the garage all the same. It\u0027s empty. No Greygo. We\u0027re alone.\\n\\n Back in the dining room, I study the sprawled guard and consider my next move. No blood, which is good. He\u0027s tall, but not heavily built. Shouldn\u0027t be too hard to carry. \u0027We have to wrap him up,\u0027 I tell Andeanna, frisking him for keys, his wallet, rings and chains. \u0027Do you have any rubber blankets?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Andeanna replies, staring at the cord around his throat, the ugly red line of death carved into his flesh.\\n\\n \u0027If you haven\u0027t, we\u0027ll use a couple of ordinary blankets covered with plastic bags.\u0027 I gently unwrap the telephone cable from around his neck. Tracing it to the phone in the hallway, I check for a dial tone and find one. That means I just have to wipe the cable with a cloth and stick it back against the wall.\\n\\n \u0027We need to work quickly,\u0027 I tell Andeanna as I return to the dining room. \u0027Once we have him wrapped, I\u0027ll get my car, bundle him into the trunk and . . . \u0027 I stop. \u0027Where\u0027s his car? Why didn\u0027t we hear him pulling back into the drive?\u0027 Andeanna looks blank. \u0027He drove out of here but he didn\u0027t drive back. We\u0027d have heard him. Why did he return so soon, on foot?\u0027\\n\\n She shakes her head. I reach out to grab her shoulders again, but she pulls away. \u0027Don\u0027t touch me!\u0027 she snarls.\\n\\n \u0027OK.\u0027 I lower my hands. \u0027You don\u0027t have to fear me. I\u0027ll give you all the space you need. But don\u0027t freak out on me. We have to hold it together.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You killed him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I sigh. \u0027But that isn\u0027t the issue. Where the hell is his car?\u0027 It comes out louder than I intended.\\n\\n Andeanna blinks. \u0027Axel drives an old Skoda. It sometimes stalls. It must have quit on him on the way to the shops. That\u0027s why he called for Greygo - he hoped he was here, to help push the car.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We have to find it. We\u0027ll use it to get rid of the body, then dump it. That will be safer than taking him in my car. Then we can - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027You killed him,\u0027 Andeanna interrupts.\\n\\n \u0027Are we back to that?\u0027 I groan.\\n\\n \u0027You killed him coldly, calmly, like it was no big thing, as if it wasn\u0027t the first time you\u0027d done it.\u0027 Her voice is steady. I stare at her wordlessly while she circles me as she earlier circled the corpse, eyes pinning me to the spot. The ghosts circle with her, swaying and cooing. \u0027I saw Mikis kill a man once. Fourteen years ago, in Blackpool. He attacked us. He had a knife. Mikis disarmed him, took the knife and kept stabbing until he was dead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Andeanna. We don\u0027t have time for this.\u0027\\n\\n She ignores me. \u0027Mikis didn\u0027t panic. I\u0027m sure he\u0027d been in that sort of situation before. He knew what to do. But even so, he didn\u0027t react as icily as you. He was shaking. He took my hand and ran, then stopped and cursed - he\u0027d dropped the knife and had to go back to get it. In our hotel room he downed half a bottle of vodka before the shakes subsided. He looked like hell.\u0027\\n\\n She stops. I cross my arms, resigned, and wait for the inevitable question.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t look like hell, Ed. You dispatched - yes, dispatched him as if you were tearing open an envelope. And now here you are, cool, composed, casually talking about how to get rid of the body.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have to. If we don\u0027t - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Earlier,\u0027 she barks. \u0027When you were trying to convince me to leave with you. You said you could protect me.\u0027\\n\\n I nod wearily. \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You didn\u0027t sell computers before you were a writer, did you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n She steps up close. \u0027What did you do, Ed?\u0027\\n\\n I consider a variety of lies, then dismiss them all. It\u0027s time for the truth. \u0027I killed people,\u0027 I tell her, then add emotionlessly, to make sure we understand each other completely, \u0027I was an assassin.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-9.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
