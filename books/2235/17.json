{"id":108127,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Back in London, I tell Joe about my meeting with Andrew Moore and my theory. He isn\u0027t convinced. How does Andeanna\u0027s lover know she was killed, assuming that she was? Why would he wait so long for revenge? Why not simply shoot Menderes himself? Legitimate questions, but I don\u0027t waste time on them. I\u0027ll squeeze the answers out of the guilty pair before I kill them.\n I ask Joe to focus on the months leading up to the original Andeanna\u0027s death, to scour the clippings for photos of her and the Turk, and note who\u0027s with them. Given the tight leash he kept her on, I doubt she\u0027d have strayed far beyond their immediate circle of friends in search of a lover. I\u0027m betting her mystery man was one of the Turk\u0027s crew, or a close business associate. I want as complete a list of his contacts for those months as possible. Joe doubts he\u0027ll be able to find out much, but says he\u0027ll see what he can come up with.\n The following morning, I resume my investigations as Edgar Sanders and return to Menderes\u0027s turf in north London. Life has gone on as normal since he died. Bond Gardiner assumed control of the Turk\u0027s business interests even before the funeral. Nobody challenged him. The locals are satisfied with Gardiner. He runs things calmly, efficiently, the same as before. They appreciate the continuity.\n Many of the people I approach have already heard about the journalist from the States and are eager to be part of the book. They talk freely about the Turk, happy to share their incriminating stories now that he\u0027s dead. They\u0027re careful not to say anything that I might be able to use against Gardiner or his men, but it\u0027s open season on Mikis Menderes.\n A lot of them boast about the Turk\u0027s love life, but no one gives any hint that his wife was disloyal. They say she was a charming lady, a perfect mother, but none of them knew her personally. I ask if she had friends who could tell me more about her, but she seems to have kept to herself and didn\u0027t say much in company. Her friends were Menderes\u0027s friends.\n I keep asking questions about Andeanna, determined to worm my way into her sad, solitary world. Finally, on a dark, wet Wednesday, a man in a pub called the King\u0027s Battalion taps my shoulder and asks if I\u0027d care to have a drink with his mates. Glancing towards the back of the pub where he was sitting, I spy a table of middle-aged, neatly dressed men. Bond Gardiner is among them. With a tight feeling in my stomach, I head over and, at a nod from Gardiner, take a seat.\n I stare around the table. Hard men, cold eyes. Gardiner stands out, even though he\u0027s dressed the same and looks no tougher. It\u0027s the charged air around him, the space the others afford him. \u0027Know who I am?\u0027 he grunts.\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n He smiles thinly. \u0027I hear you\u0027re a writer.\u0027\n \u0027Trying to be.\u0027\n \u0027Writing a book.\u0027\n \u0027I hope to. I\u0027ve never written one before. I\u0027m not sure how it will go.\u0027\n \u0027American?\u0027 he asks.\n \u0027Yes. Montana. It\u0027s up near Canada.\u0027\n Gardiner is holding a book of matches and plays with them while he speaks, flicking open the lid and running his thumb over the phosphorus heads. \u0027Tell me, Mr Sanders, what\u0027s a Yank doing in London, investigating Mikis Menderes? Don\u0027t you have gangsters where you come from?\u0027\n \u0027One or two,\u0027 I chuckle. \u0027But I was over here freelancing. Then the Turk - \u0027\n \u0027Mr Menderes,\u0027 Gardiner corrects me.\n \u0027Excuse me. Then Mr Menderes was killed. I set out to write an article about him, but the more I learnt, the more fascinated I became.\u0027\n Gardiner carries on playing with the matches. \u0027Will it do him justice,\u0027 he asks softly, \u0027or are you out to dish the dirt?\u0027\n I shrug. \u0027I\u0027m not going to pretend he was some kind of Robin Hood, but I don\u0027t want to demonize him either. I want to explore behind the mask, chart how he got started, why he chose a life of crime, how his work conflicted with his home life. I want to show how a modern gangster lives, how those close to him cope, whether his challenges and problems are the same as any ordinary Joe\u0027s.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what,\u0027 one of the others barks. \u0027Ordinary blokes don\u0027t have to cope with having their brains blown out by some bastard of an assassin while they\u0027re home in bed!\u0027\n They all murmur angrily.\n \u0027You haven\u0027t found out who killed him, have you?\u0027 Gardiner asks.\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll let us know if you do, won\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Sure. I\u0027ll send you a copy of the book before it\u0027s published. You can proofread it for me.\u0027\n Gardiner laughs and the mood lightens. \u0027Tell me what you\u0027ve found out.\u0027\n \u0027All of it?\u0027\n \u0027Just the good bits.\u0027\n I recount some of the more fanciful tales I\u0027ve collected in the course of my investigations. Gardiner and his men listen silently at first, but soon interject with stories of their own. They discuss jobs the Turk pulled, boasting of those that were a success and delighting over those that went awry, as if it was all a game without real consequences.\n I ask the questions I imagine a journalist would ask, verifying names and dates. I jot down a few details in my writing pad, to make it look like I mean to use this. After a while I steer talk round to Andeanna. \u0027What was his wife like?\u0027\n \u0027A looker,\u0027 a pug-nosed man called Harold says.\n \u0027A lady,\u0027 Gardiner corrects him.\n \u0027A looker of a lady,\u0027 a guy called Larry laughs.\n \u0027She was young when they married, wasn\u0027t she?\u0027\n Gardiner taps the table warningly. \u0027If you want us to talk about that child-bride shit and how he was a dirty old lech, you can go fuck your - \u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 I interrupt. \u0027That\u0027s not it. I\u0027m just saying that even though she was young when she died, she was very young when they got married, so they had quite a long time together. I want to stress how much value Menderes placed on family and his marriage vows. I know he had other women, but he was loyal to her in his way. She was at the centre of his world and he was careful to shield her from the darker areas of his work. I want to show his more compassionate side.\u0027\n \u0027Compassionate?\u0027 Larry snorts. \u0027The only compassion Mikis ever . . . \u0027\n An angry glance from his boss shuts him up. \u0027You\u0027re right, Sanders,\u0027 Gardiner says. \u0027Mikis was a provider. He doted on Andeanna and Greygo and was always there for them.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Larry says meekly. \u0027He loved her.\u0027\n The rest of the gang mutter their consent.\n \u0027Do you know how the two of them met?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027Now there\u0027s a story!\u0027 Gardiner beams, and proceeds to tell me the cinema tale, how Andeanna was sitting behind the Turk at a premiere and kept on talking until he turned round and told her to shut up. In reply she dumped a bucket of popcorn over his head. I\u0027ve heard the story before, several times, but I pretend it\u0027s new to me and laugh in all the right places.\n At the end, I frown and clear my throat. \u0027I\u0027ve heard rumours,\u0027 I begin. \u0027I don\u0027t want to upset you, but some people have said that Menderes used to hit her.\u0027\n Gardiner\u0027s smile vanishes. \u0027Who told you that?\u0027\n \u0027Various people.\u0027\n \u0027Who?\u0027 He leans across the table menacingly.\n I shake my head. \u0027I can\u0027t reveal my sources.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll tear the fuckers to pieces for spreading lies like that,\u0027 he vows.\n \u0027It\u0027s not true?\u0027\n \u0027Of course not! If you mention that in your book, I\u0027ll have your bollocks for marbles.\u0027 I blink at the blatant viciousness of the threat. \u0027Mikis wasn\u0027t perfect, but he wasn\u0027t a wife-beater. Ask anyone who knew him, they\u0027ll tell you the same.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 I mutter. \u0027I only brought it up because - \u0027\n \u0027Shut it,\u0027 Gardiner growls.\n \u0027Fine, whatever.\u0027 I stare at the table and fidget, like I\u0027d been meaning to say something else but have thought better of it.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Gardiner snaps.\n \u0027Nothing. Just . . . No. Forget about it.\u0027\n \u0027Say what you were going to.\u0027\n \u0027It was just more gossip. Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t - \u0027\n \u0027Spit it out, or so help me . . . \u0027 He starts to get to his feet.\n \u0027I\u0027ll call for help if you attack!\u0027 I yelp, pulling away from him, acting as if the very thought of taking a punch fills me with terror.\n Gardiner curses, then controls himself, sits and gestures for me to take my place. After a few carefully judged seconds I join him at the table again, faking wariness. \u0027Tell me what you\u0027ve heard,\u0027 Gardiner says stiffly.\n \u0027I haven\u0027t repeated this to anyone, and I won\u0027t,\u0027 I tell him. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t even say it to you, except I know how close you and Menderes were.\u0027 I let a few seconds drag by, then come out with the query I\u0027ve spent the better part of a week building up to. \u0027I heard that Andeanna Menderes was having an affair.\u0027\n A vein pulses in Gardiner\u0027s forehead, but he says nothing. The other men around the table look disbelieving.\n \u0027That\u0027s bullshit,\u0027 Larry says.\n \u0027What else have you heard?\u0027 Gardiner growls.\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 I mutter.\n \u0027What. Else.\u0027\n I stare at his colleagues, then look to Gardiner questioningly. With a curt wave of a hand he dismisses them. Once they\u0027re out of earshot, I slide into the chair next to Gardiner and address him in a veiled whisper. \u0027I think she had a lover, that Menderes found out and killed her, then staged the car accident.\u0027\n Gardiner\u0027s jaw tightens. \u0027Who told you this?\u0027\n \u0027Nobody, not directly. I pieced the theory together from various accounts.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a theory you should forget as soon as fucking possible,\u0027 he snarls.\n \u0027I can\u0027t.\u0027\n He stares at me with flat eyes. \u0027You don\u0027t know what I could do to you if you got on the wrong side of me.\u0027\n \u0027Of course I do,\u0027 I retort, not dropping my gaze. \u0027But I\u0027ve got to be able to verify or dismiss the theory. I\u0027ll go on searching until I\u0027m sure.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ve about one minute left to live,\u0027 he says. \u0027Any last requests?\u0027\n \u0027Just tell me the truth,\u0027 I plead. \u0027If I\u0027m wrong, look me in the eye and say so. I\u0027ll take your word for it. If I\u0027m right, confirm it. Either way, the story can stop here. No need for anything that might come back to haunt you. You can get rid of me with the truth.\u0027\n \u0027You expect me to believe you\u0027d keep it to yourself?\u0027 he sneers.\n \u0027I\u0027d have to. There\u0027s no evidence linking Menderes to his wife\u0027s death. There aren\u0027t even any rumours that he killed her. This is a theory of my own invention. If I was dumb enough to include it in the book, I\u0027d be torn apart by Menderes\u0027s lawyers. You can\u0027t come out and openly accuse a man of murdering his wife, not without at least some shred of proof. It would be a great hook for the book if I could substantiate it, but without substantiation no publisher would touch it.\u0027\n \u0027And you expect me to give you the proof you need?\u0027 Gardiner sniffs.\n \u0027It can be off the record,\u0027 I say softly. \u0027Not for the book, just for me. It sounds crazy, and I don\u0027t expect you to understand, but this has taken over my life. It was only a story in the beginning. Now it\u0027s more. I can\u0027t use anything you say - without a witness, you could claim in court that you didn\u0027t tell me shit - but I need to know. For my own sake.\u0027\n Gardiner squints at me. I\u0027m not what he expected. He makes a sudden growling noise and tells me to stand. He frisks me, searching for a hidden recorder. When he\u0027s satisfied that I\u0027m clean, we sit down and he leans in close. \u0027You\u0027re right.\u0027\n I shudder involuntarily. \u0027She had a lover?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Menderes knew?\u0027\n \u0027He found them together,\u0027 Gardiner says. \u0027He was away on business. He returned early, caught them fucking, lost his rag and killed them. I helped him arrange Andeanna\u0027s accident and I disposed of the other body.\u0027\n That\u0027s not what I wanted to hear - a dead lover can\u0027t exact revenge - but it\u0027s way more than I\u0027d hoped to learn. I can\u0027t believe Gardiner is telling me this. My head is spinning. To have so much information dropped into my lap so suddenly . . .\n \u0027Who was he?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027You don\u0027t need to know.\u0027\n \u0027Yes I fucking do.\u0027\n Gardiner lays a hand on my arm and squeezes hard. \u0027No you fucking don\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 I mutter. He squeezes tighter until I sigh and repeat it. \u0027OK.\u0027\n Releasing my arm, Gardiner returns to his book of matches and begins playing with it again. \u0027Mikis had a savage temper. He vented it on Andeanna. He loved her but he couldn\u0027t help himself. He was jealous as the devil, even when he didn\u0027t need to be. When he found her in bed with . . . \u0027 He breathes through his nostrils like a dragon. \u0027He didn\u0027t mean to kill her, but he lost control. We did a good job of covering it up. Nobody ever questioned it. I stopped worrying years ago. Just goes to show, you can never drop your guard.\u0027\n \u0027Can I ask something else?\u0027 He nods warily. \u0027Why tell me this?\u0027\n Gardiner smiles terribly. \u0027Because you asked.\u0027\n \u0027No, seriously. It would have been a lot easier to scare me off or silence me. Hell, you could have just kept your mouth shut. Why come clean after so many years, when you didn\u0027t have to?\u0027\n Gardiner considers that, then sighs. \u0027I\u0027ve done a lot of bad shit in my time, but that\u0027s the one thing that keeps me awake nights, that I wish I could take back. I guess I\u0027ve wanted to confess for a long time, and you\u0027re as good a confessor as any.\u0027\n \u0027Because you trust me to keep it to myself?\u0027\n He grins bleakly. \u0027Because I can get to you any time I like. You even dream of repeating any of this, you\u0027ll be an easy man to kill.\u0027\n He\u0027s wrong on that score, but I don\u0027t correct him. Instead I reflect on what he told me. It\u0027s confusing. I was right about Andeanna being murdered, but her lover was killed too. Does this mean her death wasn\u0027t connected to the Turk\u0027s, that I\u0027ve unravelled a mystery that has nothing to do with the one I set out to expose?\n \u0027Happy now?\u0027 Gardiner asks.\n \u0027I\u0027d be a lot happier if you\u0027d tell me the name of her lover.\u0027\n \u0027We all want things we can\u0027t have.\u0027 He puts the matches away. \u0027I\u0027ll say this much - he was someone we couldn\u0027t afford to kill. If the truth had trickled out, it would have been catastrophic. Make of that what you want, but keep your theories to yourself. And know this - your enquiry ends here. If you\u0027ve gathered enough material to write a book, go ahead. If not, tough. You don\u0027t have the freedom of the city any more. I want you off my manor.\u0027\n \u0027OK. I\u0027ve got what I was after anyway.\u0027\n Almost true. I need the name of the lover too, to make sure he\u0027s dead, to check if he left behind a son or other relative who might have engineered the plot to kill Menderes. But I won\u0027t find it proceeding the way I have been. Gardiner is the end of the line as far as open enquiries go. With one exception.\n \u0027There\u0027s one more person I\u0027d like to interview before I quit - Gregory.\u0027\n \u0027What do you want to speak to him for?\u0027 Gardiner asks.\n \u0027Human interest. People will want to know how his father\u0027s death affected him, what their relationship was like, if he knew about Menderes\u0027s secret life and loved him regardless.\u0027\n The truth is, I want to know if he can recall any of his dead mother\u0027s friends who maybe dropped by when his father was away on business.\n \u0027Greygo has shunned the press,\u0027 Gardiner says. \u0027I doubt he\u0027ll agree to meet you.\u0027\n \u0027But if he does, can I speak with him?\u0027\n Gardiner considers it, then shrugs. \u0027Sure. But he\u0027s the last. And if you mention anything about what I told you . . . \u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t.\u0027\n Gardiner grunts. \u0027In that case, there\u0027s just one more thing.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n He grips my right leg above the knee and stares into my eyes, his expression bleak. I wonder if I\u0027ve misjudged the situation, if he\u0027s going to take me out back and shoot me to ensure my silence. Then he smirks and says, \u0027Can I have a signed copy of the book when it comes out?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-17.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: \n Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
