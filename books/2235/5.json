{"id":108115,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"I meet with Deleena most nights. Sometimes we dine together or pop into a bar for a drink, but often we just stroll, taking London\u0027s warren of streets at random, seeing where the night leads us. I feel like a prince when she\u0027s by my side. All is good with the world. Even my ghosts pull back, as if repelled by the warmth I\u0027m feeling inside. For the first time in years I find my waking hours more than just bearable at best, as they\u0027ve been ever since the ghosts entered my life - with Deleena, they\u0027re a pleasure.\n Deleena seems to be a creature of the shadows. She favours dimly lit spots. She has sensitive eyes, which is why she prefers small, romantic restaurants to those which are harshly illuminated. That suits me fine. It means I\u0027m discovering new sides of her every time we meet. A mole on her left shoulder when her bra strap slips. A freckle on her right ear which was previously hidden by her hair. A slightly discoloured tooth.\n I occasionally worry that her beauty might crumble if I ever see her in strong, direct, sustained light, that she\u0027ll be revealed as a hideous hag, hiding behind a veil of paint and make-up. But of course that\u0027s nonsense. I see enough of her, even in the shadows, to know it\u0027s no mask.\n She loves books, and though our tastes are similar, they differ in many ways too. For instance, her favourite novel is The Alchemist. I always dismissed that as a feel-good piece of New Age hokum, but she argues its case convincingly and has started to win me over.\n One night she brings the book with her and reads out some of her favourite extracts to me while perched on a stone bench in Trafalgar Square. I listen to her with a warm smile, dreamily studying her lips as they softly open and close while forming the words. If Paulo Coelho himself happened to be passing and offered to stop her and treat me to a personal recitation, I\u0027d scowl and tell him in my best British bobby impression, \u0027Move along, sir. Move along.\u0027\n Since we spend much of our time discussing books, I start telling Deleena about the new novel that I\u0027m working on. I hadn\u0027t meant to share the details with her. Normally I don\u0027t reveal anything about my work during the formative stages. The first anyone usually sees of an Ed Sieveking story is when I send a third or fourth draft to my agent. But it seems natural to involve her in my thought processes, to bounce ideas off her as I do off Joe.\n As close as we\u0027ve become, at the same time I feel somehow strangely distant from Deleena. Our dates have been chaste affairs. We haven\u0027t even kissed. Twelve nights of wining and dining, exploring the streets, baring our souls, and we haven\u0027t touched lips. Does that mean she simply wants me as a friend? I\u0027m not sure. Sometimes she looks at me like she wants to pledge herself to me on the spot. Other times I catch something melancholic in her expression and feel sure that she\u0027s about to cut me off with her next words, tell me she never wants to see me again. She confuses me. Maybe that confusion is part of her appeal.\n She can be miserly with her time too. She\u0027ll often leave early, maybe before the end of a meal or not long after we\u0027ve set off on a walk, offering one feeble excuse or another, leaving me to stare longingly after her and brood on what might have been. On those nights I try to walk off my frustration and tune her out of my thoughts, but the less time she spends with me, the more I lust after her.\n I like to think I\u0027m a good judge of character - a writer needs to be - but with Deleena I just don\u0027t know. There are moments when I feel incredibly close to her, then she\u0027ll blink and it\u0027s like I don\u0027t know her at all.\n Joe can\u0027t help as he hasn\u0027t met her yet. I\u0027m keen to introduce them but they keep missing one another. Joe has cried off a couple of times when customers have made after-hours demands of him. Deleena had to work late another evening. We were meant to get together last Sunday for a barbecue, but first Joe got called away and then Deleena rang to say old friends had dropped by unannounced. If I didn\u0027t believe that we live in a universe of chance, I\u0027d swear destiny was working to keep them apart.\n I\u0027ve been grinding away on the plot of the book, trying to figure out why my lead character was killed. It can\u0027t be random. The story is crying out for a reason that will drive the narrative forward, but I can\u0027t decide what it should be. One evening, surrounded by a sea of notes in my hotel room, I mention to Joe that I\u0027ve come to a block, and in a moment of genius he provides me with the answer.\n \u0027The killer works for an agency,\u0027 Joe says. \u0027They eliminate people with powers like theirs, people who won\u0027t work for them, who they see as a threat. Our main guy is spotted. They check him out, decide they can\u0027t use him, and kill him.\u0027\n \u0027Then he comes back as a ghost and makes them eat a hundred unholy pillars of fire when he tracks them down,\u0027 I enthuse, thumping Joe\u0027s back.\n \u0027Know what?\u0027 I mutter a few minutes later, having scribbled down the idea and played with it a bit. \u0027You just earned yourself a credit in the book.\u0027\n Joe\u0027s eyes widen. \u0027You\u0027re gonna put my name on the cover?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 I laugh. \u0027But how about a creative consultant nod on the title page?\u0027\n \u0027Are you serious?\u0027 Joe whoops.\n \u0027Of course I\u0027ll have to cut you in for a percentage of the profits as well.\u0027\n \u0027Aw, Ed, there\u0027s no need to . . . \u0027\n \u0027I insist. How does five per cent sound?\u0027\n \u0027Why not ten?\u0027 Joe responds immediately.\n \u0027Let\u0027s stick with five,\u0027 I chuckle.\n \u0027This calls for a toast,\u0027 Joe beams and rushes to the minibar.\n \u0027I can\u0027t believe how generous I\u0027ve become,\u0027 I note wryly as Joe pours a rum for me. \u0027If you\u0027d told me a few weeks ago that I\u0027d be offering to share credit with somebody, I\u0027d have said you were crazy.\u0027\n \u0027Having second thoughts?\u0027 Joe asks nervously.\n \u0027No,\u0027 I smile. \u0027I\u0027ll hold true to my word. Do you want it in writing?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t be stupid. I trust you.\u0027\n I finish off the rum and pour myself a second miniature bottle. I take this one slowly. I don\u0027t want to drink myself into a stupor before nightfall.\n \u0027Maybe I\u0027ll include Deleena in the credits too,\u0027 I murmur.\n \u0027Why?\u0027 Joe frowns. \u0027She hasn\u0027t injected any ideas.\u0027\n \u0027True, but we have her to thank for my generosity of spirit. If I wasn\u0027t falling in love, I doubt I\u0027d be so willing to involve you in the creative process.\u0027\n Joe drops his gaze. \u0027You\u0027re falling in love with her?\u0027 he asks quietly.\n \u0027I guess. Hell, I don\u0027t know, maybe it\u0027s the rum. Cheers.\u0027\n \u0027Cheers,\u0027 Joe says, but soberly.\n \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027Nothing. It\u0027s just . . . when am I going to meet her? It\u0027s been more than two weeks and you haven\u0027t let me see her.\u0027\n \u0027Is it my fault you\u0027ve been fixing fridges, TV sets and God alone knows what else every time I try to introduce you?\u0027\n \u0027No, but . . . \u0027 He shrugs. \u0027I\u0027ve spoken to a few of my friends who were at Shar\u0027s party, and nobody knows her. I\u0027ve been wondering why I haven\u0027t bumped into her before. From the way you describe her, she\u0027s hard to miss.\u0027\n \u0027She is,\u0027 I sigh, day-dreaming of Deleena in the black dress she wore when we first met. \u0027But it\u0027s not odd that your friends don\u0027t know her. She\u0027s a client of Shar\u0027s. She didn\u0027t know anyone on the boat. That\u0027s why we hooked up - we were the only two who were alone.\u0027\n \u0027Still, you have to bring her to see me, Ed. For all I know, she\u0027s one of the ugly sisters.\u0027\n \u0027Up yours,\u0027 I retort, and Joe laughs.\n I pour a third shot of rum and ponder my good fortune. A book that\u0027s shaping up nicely. A relationship with a beautiful lady who brings out the best in me. And a good friend. It\u0027s a far cry from my usual lonely, passionless life. For years I\u0027ve limped along, nursing grudges, bitter at the world for what it did to me, haunted by my ghosts, desperately searching for proof that the spirits are real, that I\u0027m not insane, struggling to hold on to whatever thin slivers of sanity I can claim to be in possession of. Now I can see light for the first time in ages. Maybe love will cure me of my ills and banish the spectre of the ghosts. If they\u0027re the product of a disturbed mind, perhaps all I need to make them go away is to find the happiness that I was sure I\u0027d always be denied.\n I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027ve done to merit this good fortune, but I\u0027m determined to appreciate it for as long as it lasts, and if the fates are kind, who knows, it might just last for ever.\n Another night in the company of the delectable Deleena. She takes me to a busy little restaurant overlooking the Thames. I tell her about my conversation with Joe. She laughs and says to bring him along any time. I propose heading out to the countryside for a weekend away, all three of us, but she isn\u0027t warm on that idea.\n \u0027Work\u0027s even busier than usual. I could be summoned without notice any day, even a Saturday or Sunday. I don\u0027t fancy having to cut short a break and drive all the way back.\u0027\n \u0027I thought slavery had been abolished,\u0027 I scowl. \u0027Surely you can ask for a Sunday off?\u0027\n \u0027Of course I can. But there\u0027s a post opening up shortly and I\u0027m in with a chance of bagging it. That would mean more income, more security and - \u0027 she leans over to playfully stroke my nose - \u0027longer holidays. Three of us are in the running and we\u0027ve been working flat out to impress our lords and masters. A plea for personal time now and I might as well forfeit. So, sorry, but . . . \u0027 She shrugs prettily.\n We move on to the subject of the book and I tell her how it\u0027s progressing.\n \u0027Have you interviewed any more mediums?\u0027 she asks.\n \u0027Not this week.\u0027\n \u0027Did you look up Etienne?\u0027 She\u0027s referring to Etienne Anders, a medium she recommended.\n \u0027I rang her a few times. She was engaged once and I got her voicemail the other times. I hate leaving messages, so I hung up.\u0027\n \u0027Do you still have her card?\u0027 Deleena presses, and I nod. \u0027You should ring her. I told her you\u0027d get in touch. She\u0027s really good, Ed. I\u0027ve been to lots of mediums over the years and she\u0027s the only one who genuinely impressed me.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll contact her, I promise, but at the moment I\u0027m exploring other angles. If you want, I can cancel a few things, swing by tomorrow.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 she smiles, laying a hand on mine. \u0027You don\u0027t have to go out of your way on my account. I\u0027m trying to help, not interfere. Just hold on to the card and . . . \u0027 As her eyes wander, she freezes. Her hand goes limp and slides away. Following the direction of her gaze, I spot a table of five middle-aged men, boisterously pulling crabs apart. Deleena is focused on a man to our left, long grey hair tied back in a ponytail, a heavy tan, immaculately dressed.\n \u0027Something wrong?\u0027 I ask.\n \u0027No,\u0027 she gasps, but now she\u0027s leaning over, using me to block the man\u0027s view of her if he happens to look across.\n \u0027Who is he and why are you hiding from him?\u0027 I murmur.\n \u0027Someone I know and don\u0027t want to meet.\u0027 She removes her napkin from her lap. \u0027Do you mind if we leave now? I know we haven\u0027t finished, but . . . \u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s OK.\u0027 I signal the waiter for the check, keeping my body between Deleena and the mystery man. Once I\u0027ve paid, I rise carefully, let her tuck in behind me and head for the exit, shielding her all the way, asking no questions, trying not to stare at the table of strangers as we pass.\n I picked up a knife as we were standing. I didn\u0027t let Deleena see. I keep it held by my side, ready to sweep it up defensively if we\u0027re threatened, old habits kicking in automatically. Nobody living sees me palm the knife, but the ghosts spot it and press forward, leering, sensing blood. They\u0027d love it if things went bad. I imagine it\u0027s what they long for more than anything else in the world.\n But this time the ghosts are disappointed. The man doesn\u0027t spot Deleena. Once outside, she slips around the side of the restaurant and stands staring across the river, arms crossed, shivering. I say nothing, waiting for her to tell me what\u0027s going on, calmly pocketing the knife. Part of me wishes I\u0027d been given a chance to use it. That part misses the old days. It wants them back.\n \u0027This looks bad, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 Deleena croaks.\n \u0027An ex-boyfriend?\u0027 I guess.\n \u0027God, no, nothing like that. Bond Gardiner? Never!\u0027 She looks up at me. \u0027Does that name mean anything to you?\u0027 I think for a minute and shake my head. \u0027He\u0027s . . . well, I guess there\u0027s no other way to put it. He\u0027s a gangster.\u0027\n I frown. \u0027What does he have to do with you?\u0027\n \u0027He wanted to open an account with my bank. My superiors rejected his request, but I was charged with breaking the bad news to him. He lost his temper and said some vicious things, stopping just short of open threats. He sent a card the next day apologizing for his outburst, but still . . . \u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t want to talk to the scary gangster again.\u0027\n \u0027Right.\u0027\n We share a smile. I\u0027m relieved it\u0027s nothing serious. There\u0027s a lot I don\u0027t know about Deleena. All sorts of dark thoughts had been flitting through my mind. The ghosts look sullen. They start to drift into the background again. My power over them is growing. I almost turn and flip them the finger, but then I\u0027d have to explain that to Deleena.\n \u0027Where now?\u0027 I ask.\n She shrugs. \u0027Grab a cab? Head up the West End and catch a late film?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d rather go for a walk.\u0027\n \u0027OK.\u0027\n I\u0027m staring at her, pressed against the wall of the restaurant. She looks so young in the shadows. Beautiful. I reach out and brush her hair from her eyes, then run a finger down her cheek and over her chin.\n Deleena stares back, lifting her head slightly, lips thinning into almost invisible lines. This is the first time I\u0027ve made an advance. I\u0027m not pushing for sex - I don\u0027t want our first time to be out in the open, against a damp wall - just a kiss. Normally I wouldn\u0027t feel nervous, but with Deleena I\u0027m petrified. If she turns her head away, where does that leave us?\n I lean forward slowly, lips opening, giving her plenty of time to object. She doesn\u0027t move. I press my lips softly to hers, hold a moment, withdraw and gaze into her eyes, searching for encouragement.\n Deleena parts her lips, edges forward, stops. \u0027Ed . . . I know you\u0027ve been patient. I know we haven\u0027t discussed this. I know you must be wondering what I\u0027m up to.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s OK,\u0027 I whisper.\n \u0027I want to.\u0027 The briefest, shakiest of grins. \u0027But in my own time. Don\u0027t rush me, Ed, please?\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t.\u0027 I steal another short kiss. \u0027I\u0027m in no hurry.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s OK if we just kiss?\u0027 she asks.\n \u0027We don\u0027t even have to do that,\u0027 I tell her.\n \u0027I don\u0027t mind kissing,\u0027 she says, and now she\u0027s smiling. \u0027Just go easy with the wandering hands.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll be the perfect gentleman,\u0027 I swear, taking her into my arms as she stands on her toes and embraces me, opening her mouth, exploring my lower lip with hers, tugging at it teasingly with her teeth, then allowing her lips to slide over mine, sealing the kiss.\n We stand in the shadows, joined. I let my hands move down to the base of her spine, but no further. She presses closer into me. Through her warm tongue and lips I detect the brisk beat of her pounding heart.\n \u0027Deleena,\u0027 I moan, but before I can say any more, she silences me with another kiss and soon I\u0027m lost. Words become meaningless. The ghosts are forgotten. There\u0027s only me, the night and her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-5.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: \n Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
