{"id":108129,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"I dial Etienne Anders\u0027s number while sitting in my car. My hands tremble so much that it takes several efforts to press the right buttons. Finally I hit the correct combination, her phone rings six times then cuts to voicemail. I leave my name and number and ask her to call me as soon as she can. My heart is pounding and my thoughts are circling faster and faster, like goldfish on speed. If Gregory Menderes has told me the truth, and the mystic can prove it, then I fell in love with a ghost, one who was able to pass herself off as a member of the living. If that\u0027s the case, life as I knew it just ceased to exist. How can I trust anything in a world where ghosts can walk among us and not be known for what they truly are? I never believed that ghosts might be real. All the years of research were mainly an attempt to keep madness at bay. The search for supernatural proof was a way of evading what I felt sure was an undeniable truth, that my ghosts were nothing more than evidence that I had suffered a mental breakdown. I didn\u0027t think there was a God, or life after death. If I was wrong . . . if Andeanna was the proof that I\u0027d been sceptically seeking . . . then everything has changed. On the one hand, that thrills me. On the other, it terrifies me, as every belief I once held true will have to be re-evaluated. I\u0027ll have to try to make sense of the world all over again. I think back to the storyline of Spirit of the Fire. I\u0027d started to feel far removed from the novel, as if it was some leftover relic from an earlier life. Now I find myself running through the plot again. Was I closer to the truth than I thought? Could my bumbling efforts to weave together a decent ghost story have nudged me over some unseen edge, into a very real, supernatural corner of the world? Did I inadvertently invite the ghost of Andeanna Menderes into my life, bring her into being or open a door through which her spirit could slip and physically form? Joe rings while I\u0027m considering the impossible. He wants to know how my meeting with Greygo went. I lie and say I learnt nothing new, then tell him I\u0027ll be in touch in a few days, that I\u0027m chasing up leads. Not wanting to expose Joe to the labyrinthine terrors of this mad new world. Not wanting to drag him down into the darkness with me, where the dead can catch hold of you and do as they wish. Hours tick by. I try not to think about Andeanna and Axel Nelke. I fail. Finally my cell rings again. I answer hoarsely, \u0027Hello?\u0027 \u0027Edgar Sanders?\u0027 a woman asks. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Etienne Anders. Sorry it took so long to get back to you, love. It\u0027s been a hectic day.\u0027 \u0027No problem. Thanks for returning my call.\u0027 There\u0027s an awkward silence. She\u0027s waiting for me to say something but I don\u0027t known how to begin. When she realizes I\u0027m stuck, she comes to my rescue. \u0027Were you looking to have your fortune read?\u0027 \u0027No, I . . . \u0027 Want her to materialize the spirit of the dead woman I fell in love with? Unpick the lock of a mystery that defies description? \u0027Gregory Menderes told me I should call.\u0027 \u0027Greygo?\u0027 I sense her smile. \u0027He used to be one of my favourites, bless him, though I haven\u0027t seen much of him lately. How is he? I heard about his father and sent a condolence card.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s good. He . . . \u0027 I go for it. \u0027I rang about his mother, Andeanna.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 Cautious now. \u0027I\u0027m writing a book. There are things I want to learn about her. Greygo told me to get in touch with you. He said you knew more about it than he did.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think so, love,\u0027 she replies. \u0027I\u0027ve channelled for Greygo a few times, but I don\u0027t . . . Do you know what channelling is?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s when a mystic acts as a conduit for the dead.\u0027 \u0027Yes. I let them speak through me. Well, I channelled for Greygo, but I didn\u0027t hear what was said. Sometimes a spirit takes over and tunes me out, so that it can converse with its loved one in private.\u0027 \u0027But he told me to phone you,\u0027 I bleat. She makes a soft sucking sound with her teeth and lips. \u0027Do you mind if I call you back, love? I\u0027d like to check with Greygo before taking this further. Not that I don\u0027t trust you, but you\u0027ve got to be careful, haven\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Sure. But if you can\u0027t get through to him, will you let me know? I don\u0027t want to sit around like a fool all night.\u0027 \u0027Will do, love. Hold tight. I won\u0027t be long.\u0027 I think about our short conversation while I wait. A channeller. Is this how Greygo learnt about his mother\u0027s death? I\u0027ve visited lots of mediums over the years. Most were blatant charlatans. A few left me wondering if there might be something to them, but not even the best could provide concrete proof that they were in touch with the dead. None could answer a direct question to my satisfaction, in a way that proved beyond doubt that they could communicate with spirits. Etienne is back within ten minutes. \u0027Sorry about the delay, love. I got chatting to Greygo about his father. He\u0027s awfully upset. They still don\u0027t know who did it. I told him he should come in and try making contact. His father might be able to shed light on the subject.\u0027 That\u0027s a twist I hadn\u0027t taken into account - the ghost of Mikis Menderes returning to point the finger at me. Even surrounded by madness, my self-protective drive kicks in and I ask how Greygo reacted to her suggestion. \u0027He pooh-poohed it. He wants to get over his father\u0027s death, not wallow in it. I understand that. It\u0027s better not to rush these things. The dead can wait, that\u0027s for certain.\u0027 \u0027What about me? Did he OK our meeting?\u0027 \u0027He was ambivalent. He regretted telling you about his secrets, but given the fact that he had, he agreed that you might as well learn the rest, seeing as how you know so much already.\u0027 \u0027When can you see me?\u0027 \u0027Right now\u0027s fine. Do you have a pen? I\u0027ll give you directions.\u0027 Etienne Anders operates from a small apartment in a block of flats in the East End. She lives elsewhere, she tells me as I make myself comfortable in a cramped living room, but never reveals her home address, even to her most trusted clients. \u0027One of my quirks, love. I\u0027m full of them.\u0027 She\u0027s a middle-aged woman with straggly grey-brown hair which she doesn\u0027t take care of. Light brown skin. Her striking cheekbones make me think she might have been a looker once, but now her face is dark with wrinkles and moles. She walks with a stoop, her left shoulder hanging lower than her right. She wears crisp white gloves but otherwise is dressed casually, baggy jeans and a faded sweater with a picture of Bob Marley sprayed across the front. \u0027I look a fright, don\u0027t I?\u0027 she laughs, collapsing into a soft, springy chair. \u0027I don\u0027t normally, but this has been a long day. I\u0027m usually finished by now. I\u0027m no nightbird, love. In bed by ten more often than not.\u0027 She glances at a digital clock hanging on the wall above my head, and sighs. \u0027But not tonight. Let\u0027s crack on, shall we?\u0027 Taking my hands, she looks at me directly. \u0027I won\u0027t feed you a load of guff, love. If customers come to be charmed and amused, I charm and amuse them. But I can turn on the real stuff when asked.\u0027 \u0027You can speak to the dead?\u0027 I ask dubiously. \u0027Not to them, love. With them. I can\u0027t contact anyone who doesn\u0027t want to be contacted, or find someone who doesn\u0027t want to be found. I open up my mind and invite them in. If they come, they come. If they don\u0027t, they don\u0027t. If Andeanna wants to speak with you, she will. If she doesn\u0027t . . . \u0027 Etienne shrugs. \u0027I understand.\u0027 \u0027Good.\u0027 Settling back, not letting go of my hands, she closes her eyes. \u0027Ever been to one of these before?\u0027 \u0027Quite a few, actually.\u0027 \u0027Then you know the routine. Keep still, say nothing, don\u0027t disturb me. It might take a while. There\u0027s nothing either of us can do to speed things up.\u0027 She takes deep breaths and relaxes. Her head is soon tossing from left to right and her lips move, forming barely intelligible words. At one point she cries out, a young boy\u0027s voice, and I fear I\u0027m going to be stuck with a whimpering child, but the youth\u0027s voice fades and she resumes her search. My ghosts drift around her as she rolls her head, making crude gestures, mocking the both of us, as they often have at seances. If she could truly do what she claims, surely she\u0027d be aware of the seven malevolent spirits in the room. The fact that she isn\u0027t disheartens me, and I ready myself for the usual mumbo-jumbo that I get fed by those of her ilk. Five or six minutes later, Etienne Anders stops squirming and sits up, eyes still closed, lips spreading in a suitably ghostly smile. \u0027Hello, Ed,\u0027 she says, only it isn\u0027t her voice. It\u0027s Andeanna\u0027s. I freeze. Whatever I\u0027d been expecting, it wasn\u0027t this. A moaning approximation of her voice, perhaps, at best. But this is the real thing, the voice of the woman I met on the boat, the woman who seduced me and had me dispose of the Turk. The voice of a ghost. \u0027Who are you?\u0027 I croak. \u0027Is this a recording?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be silly, Ed.\u0027 I see now that the smile is Andeanna\u0027s as well. A warm but worried smile, like the one she flashed the first time we kissed. \u0027You know it\u0027s me.\u0027 I lean forward, fingers digging into the mystic\u0027s. \u0027I want to hear you say it.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m Andeanna Menderes,\u0027 she sighs, \u0027but I called myself Deleena Emerson the night we met at Shar\u0027s party.\u0027 \u0027You died,\u0027 I whisper. \u0027Years ago. You\u0027re dead.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Ed. I know.\u0027 \u0027But you were real!\u0027 I shout. \u0027I touched you. Kissed you. We made love.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 she corrects me. \u0027We couldn\u0027t. I would have, if I\u0027d been able, but there are limits.\u0027 \u0027Who sets them?\u0027 I croak, but she only smiles and shakes her head. \u0027How have you been?\u0027 she asks, as if we\u0027d parted the day before. \u0027How do you fucking think?\u0027 I snarl, no longer seeing Etienne Anders, no longer doubting, chatting with Andeanna the same way I did when she was alive. When I thought she was alive. All the doubts blown away. Adjusting with surprising ease to the resettlement of my axis of reality. \u0027I\u0027ve kept track of you as best I could,\u0027 Andeanna says as my ghosts drift into the background, sullen, disappointed, and also confused-looking. \u0027I\u0027ve been with you much of the time. I tried letting you know I was present, but I don\u0027t have that power any longer. If you hadn\u0027t come here, we could never have spoken with each other again. That\u0027s why I told you about Etienne. I didn\u0027t know what was going to happen when Mikis died, but I guessed it might be like this. I didn\u0027t want to leave without explaining.\u0027 I feel tears building, but I blink them back. \u0027Explain that you made a fool of me? That you used and discarded me? That you forced me to kill your ex-husband, promising it would make you mine, knowing it would only drive us apart?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she mutters, dropping her head with shame. \u0027There was no other way. I had to have him killed. Just like he killed me.\u0027 I push my anger aside and concentrate on this immediate part of the puzzle. \u0027The Turk killed you?\u0027 I ask, and she nods. \u0027But Greygo said - \u0027 \u0027Greygo started coming here when he was nineteen,\u0027 she interrupts. \u0027I\u0027d been with him since I died, as your ghosts are always with you, but that wasn\u0027t enough. He\u0027d only known me as a child knows. He yearned to learn more about me. He did the rounds of mystics and seers, longing to talk with me and hear me tell him that I loved him. Etienne was the only one I could speak through. She\u0027s special, the way you are. You both have connections to the dead which most of the living lack. \u0027Greygo had harboured suspicions for a long time. Mikis was careful never to let his secret slip, but sometimes he\u0027d drink too much, moan my name in his sleep and beg forgiveness. Greygo wondered what his father had to feel guilty about. \u0027It took him a long time to build up to the question.\u0027 The mystic\u0027s face lifts, filled with Andeanna\u0027s pride. \u0027Did my father kill you? It almost destroyed him as he asked it. I meant to tell him the truth and turn him against the monster who took my life. But there was so much fear in his eyes, fear that I\u0027d say yes . . . \u0027 Her face clouds over. \u0027As much as I hated Mikis, I loved Greygo and couldn\u0027t bear to destroy him. I made up a suicide story, mixing in enough truth to explain Mikis\u0027s guilt. It hurt Greygo, but not as much as the truth would have.\u0027 \u0027And killing his father - don\u0027t you think that hurt?\u0027 \u0027Of course,\u0027 she sighs, \u0027but I had no choice. I had to kill Mikis. I couldn\u0027t know peace until I did.\u0027 \u0027Tell me how you did it,\u0027 I whisper. \u0027Tell me how you assumed human form and tracked me down.\u0027 Etienne shrugs, exactly the way Andeanna used to when I asked a question she couldn\u0027t answer. \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027Bullshit,\u0027 I snarl. \u0027The truth,\u0027 she says gently. \u0027This is the real world, Ed, not one of your books. There aren\u0027t answers to every question. For years I was a bodiless entity, haunting the mansion. I glimpsed fellow spirits from time to time, but I had no way of communicating with them. I was alone, and lonely, but at least there was Greygo. I watched him grow up. I was there when he brought his first date home. I kept an eye on him and spoke to him, even though he couldn\u0027t hear me. \u0027One night I felt myself changing. Forming. I was terrified. I didn\u0027t know what was happening. I was feeling things again, smelling, hearing, seeing. After the initial shock, it was wonderful. But now that I was solid - visible - I had to leave before I was seen. So I grabbed some of Greygo\u0027s clothes and fled. \u0027I wandered the city, bones and flesh strengthening while I walked, and if you think that was painless, you couldn\u0027t be more wrong. I was cold and scared, in agony. Then, when the sun rose, I disintegrated like a vampire. Sunlight always undid me. That\u0027s why I never met you in the day, always late in the evening when the sun\u0027s power was fading. \u0027I re-formed the next night, in the place where I\u0027d come apart. Naked and defenceless, I hid, only coming out when the city was asleep. I returned to the mansion and raided my old room. I sold jewellery - my own, items that Mikis had held on to, so I didn\u0027t feel bad for stealing it - and set myself up in a small apartment, where I retired each night before dawn, so that I could rematerialize somewhere familiar and safe the next evening. \u0027Shortly after that, my thoughts turned to revenge.\u0027 Her expression hardens. I\u0027m amazed by how much of Andeanna there is in the mystic\u0027s face. It\u0027s as if she\u0027s taken over Etienne Anders from the inside, making the medium\u0027s features her own, moulding them to mirror hers. \u0027I wasn\u0027t driven by hatred. Killing Mikis was just something I had to do. Without knowing how I\u0027d re-formed, I knew instinctively why - to make Mikis pay.\u0027 \u0027How did you know?\u0027 I ask. \u0027I just did. It\u0027s . . . \u0027 She grins sickly. \u0027It\u0027s a dead thing. You\u0027d have to die and come back like I did to understand.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not that eager to find out,\u0027 I deadpan, and for a few seconds we smile at one another the way we used to, like it\u0027s a big joke. \u0027Anyway,\u0027 she says, \u0027I knew I couldn\u0027t kill Mikis by myself. I didn\u0027t have murder in me. I had to find somebody else.\u0027 \u0027Which is where I came in,\u0027 I growl, and she nods glumly. \u0027Why me?\u0027 \u0027Pure misfortune,\u0027 she sighs. \u0027Don\u0027t lie. You tracked me down and tricked me into an affair. You used me like a puppet.\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 She shakes her head vehemently. \u0027It wasn\u0027t like that. I know that\u0027s how it looks, but I swear on all that\u0027s sacred, on Greygo, I didn\u0027t set out to trap you.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t believe you,\u0027 I mutter. A pained expression crosses her face. \u0027I was at that boat party by chance,\u0027 she says. \u0027I crashed a lot of parties. Given who and what I was, I couldn\u0027t mingle with those who\u0027d known me when I was alive. I\u0027d fall in with groups on their way to a party, pretend to be human for a few hours, slip away like Cinderella before the break of day. \u0027The only thing I had on my mind that night was fun. Like so many other nights, that proved elusive, which is why I wound up on deck, to brood about the cruel twist of fate that had placed me there. Then I found myself next to you.\u0027 Although the mystic\u0027s eyes don\u0027t open, the lids fix on me as if the spirit of Andeanna sees through the thin layers of flesh. \u0027I knew instantly that you were a man of violence. I saw your ghosts and sensed their hatred of you. I knocked the glass overboard to start a conversation with you, and . . . you know the rest.\u0027 \u0027I thought I did. But why don\u0027t you tell me how it really was? It was never about love. You saw me as a tool from the start, didn\u0027t you, a way to kill Mikis?\u0027 She sighs. \u0027My interest was wholly mercenary that first night. But that changed as we spent more time together. I forgot what I was. I fell in love with you. It was crazy, and it messed up everything, but I couldn\u0027t help myself. When I was with you, I was real, alive, desperate for love. That wasn\u0027t a sham, Ed. I couldn\u0027t have faked those emotions.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re lying.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not!\u0027 she cries. \u0027Listen to me. Hear me. I know you hate me, and you\u0027ve every right to, but don\u0027t turn your ears against the truth. I love you, Ed, and if you ever loved me the way you claimed, you\u0027d know in your heart that I\u0027m not lying.\u0027 The terrible thing is - I do. \u0027What about Axel Nelke?\u0027 I ask, anxious to steer talk away from love. She stares through her closed eyelids, disappointed by my reaction, then shrugs. \u0027Axel was my lover. Mikis killed him. What more do you want to know?\u0027 \u0027The guard I killed. You said he was Axel Nelke.\u0027 \u0027I lied. When you saw through my first disguise - Deleena Emerson - I knew I had to make my next seem as genuine as possible. I had to tell you as much of the truth as I dared. If I\u0027d invented a name for my fictitious bodyguard, you might have sensed the lie. I felt safe using Axel\u0027s name. I knew I wouldn\u0027t blurt out the wrong surname by mistake, or tell you he had red hair then turn round later and say he was blond.\u0027 \u0027But the man I killed . . . \u0027 \u0027A guard. I don\u0027t know his name. There was one on duty most nights. They usually knocked off at ten or eleven if Mikis and Greygo weren\u0027t home.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t set me up to kill him?\u0027 \u0027Of course not. I wanted Mikis\u0027s head, nobody else\u0027s. I don\u0027t know why the guard returned when he did.\u0027 Is she telling the truth? I don\u0027t know. If I could see her eyes, I\u0027d have a better idea. \u0027Greygo hadn\u0027t heard of a guard going missing,\u0027 I note. She smiles bitterly. \u0027Greygo didn\u0027t want to know about Mikis\u0027s business, so he was kept in the dark whenever possible. If he\u0027d been home around that time, he would have noticed that the guard had disappeared. Since he was absent, Mikis saw no reason to share the troubling news with him.\u0027 \u0027Why did you invite me there?\u0027 I ask, reluctant to let it drop. \u0027What was with the battered face? Was that faked?\u0027 \u0027Self-inflicted,\u0027 she mumbles. \u0027By then I\u0027d fallen in love with you. On the boat, I thought I might be able to hire you to kill Mikis. But I now knew that whatever you\u0027d done in the past, you weren\u0027t a killer any more. Yet you remained my best hope. I thought you could be encouraged to kill. So I used your love for me to turn you against Mikis.\u0027 \u0027Then you did manipulate me!\u0027 I shout. \u0027Yes and no,\u0027 she sniffs. \u0027You can\u0027t have it both ways, Andeanna.\u0027 \u0027But I did,\u0027 she protests. \u0027I loved you, Ed - that was real. But I had to kill Mikis. My first priority, my very reason for existing, was to make Mikis pay. So, yes, I used you. But I didn\u0027t fake love to win you over. \u0027My plan was for you to see that Mikis had hurt me, lose your temper and target him. Afterwards I\u0027d have told you the truth. Or if, as I suspected, I faded away when Mikis was dead, I\u0027d try to contact you via Etienne, as I\u0027m doing now. Then the guard turned up, you killed him and a new plan formed. You revealed the truth about your past, you asked to eliminate Mikis, you dreamt up the assassin angle. I didn\u0027t want that - it was complicated, and it implicated you too deeply - but I was powerless to turn you from your path.\u0027 \u0027You could have told me the truth,\u0027 I contradict her. A wan smile flickers across her lips. \u0027That I was a ghost? A shade of the night? Would you have believed me?\u0027 \u0027Probably not,\u0027 I mutter. \u0027But if you\u0027d let me see your form unravel one night . . . \u0027 \u0027I considered that,\u0027 she says. \u0027But if I\u0027d let you see me for what I truly was, I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be able to love me any more. I was worried I\u0027d scare you off.\u0027 \u0027It takes a lot to scare me,\u0027 I grunt. \u0027Don\u0027t I know it,\u0027 she grins. Then she tickles my left wrist with one of her fingers. \u0027If it\u0027s any consolation, I did what I could to protect you. I lied to suit my purposes, but also to suit yours. I could have betrayed you to Bond, planted evidence to condemn you. But I wanted you to escape.\u0027 \u0027Very thoughtful of you,\u0027 I snap. Silence descends. I mull over what Andeanna has told me. It\u0027s too insane to be true. I want to reject it out of hand. But what\u0027s the alternative? Andeanna Menderes was murdered twenty years ago - fact. I fell in love with a woman who shares her looks - fact. I have it on good authority that the woman\u0027s ghost has roamed the halls of her home since her death - fact. That woman is now speaking to me through a medium - fact. Too many facts to ignore. When there\u0027s no sane answer, a man must accept the insane. As impossible as it is, as crazy as it sounds, the truth is undeniable. \u0027I fell in love with a ghost,\u0027 I groan. \u0027Yes.\u0027 Andeanna smiles sadly. \u0027And a ghost fell in love with you.\u0027 Incredibly, my mood is lifting. The truth has been revealed. It\u0027s an awful, twisted truth, but now I can begin to deal with it. It won\u0027t be easy, but I don\u0027t have to chase around wildly any longer, pursuing false threads, driving myself mental in search of an answer. \u0027It\u0027s asking a lot,\u0027 Andeanna murmurs, \u0027but do you think you can forgive me?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I reply. \u0027This has thrown my world out of whack. I don\u0027t know what I feel for you, or what I\u0027ll feel a week from now, a month, a year. If I said I could, I\u0027d be lying.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s fair,\u0027 she nods. \u0027I was always fair with you,\u0027 I note pointedly. \u0027And I wasn\u0027t with you,\u0027 she agrees. \u0027So.\u0027 I settle back, studying the face of the channelling mystic. \u0027Where do we go from here?\u0027 \u0027Our separate ways,\u0027 she answers promptly. I feel a strange pang of regret. Even after all she put me through, I still love her, and the thought of parting for ever fills me with dread. \u0027Can\u0027t we . . . isn\u0027t there some way we can . . . ?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 she says softly. \u0027I have to move on. Mikis\u0027s death released me. I\u0027m being called. There\u0027s another world or dimension where I\u0027m supposed to be. I have to go. I want to go. I think I\u0027ll enjoy it.\u0027 I feel something running down my cheeks. At first I think spiders have dropped from the ceiling. But as I blink, I realize they\u0027re only tears. \u0027Can\u0027t you come back?\u0027 I weep, managing a weak smile to show I know how dumb my request is. \u0027On a weekend pass, perhaps?\u0027 \u0027I doubt they have those where I\u0027m going,\u0027 Andeanna giggles. \u0027But if they do, I\u0027ll apply for one.\u0027 I wipe my right sleeve across my cheeks, careful not to break contact with the medium, wishing the tears had held off for a while, so that I could focus on Andeanna\u0027s face, clearer than ever in the features of Etienne Anders. Andeanna puts her lips to my cheek and removes a tear with the tip of her tongue. I moan, and she draws back from me, her smile fading. \u0027I have to go now. Etienne can\u0027t maintain this link indefinitely.\u0027 \u0027Just a few more . . . \u0027 I begin, but she shakes her head slowly. \u0027Before I leave,\u0027 she says, \u0027can I make a final request?\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 I reply, fresh tears falling. \u0027One last kiss, Ed?\u0027 \u0027I could never refuse a lady,\u0027 I laugh brokenly. \u0027But promise you won\u0027t tell Etienne.\u0027 She smirks. \u0027I don\u0027t want her thinking we took advantage of her body.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll never tell anyone about tonight,\u0027 I vow. \u0027Not even Joe?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll fill him in on the essentials. No more. He deserves to know the truth - he guessed it before I did - but I won\u0027t discuss it in depth with him. I couldn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll go with the kiss, Ed,\u0027 she says, leaning forward. \u0027No prolonged goodbyes. One last kiss and - puff - I\u0027m fairy dust.\u0027 \u0027I love you, Andeanna,\u0027 I cry. \u0027I love you too,\u0027 she whispers, then thrusts her lips against mine, devouring them with a hunger born of impending finality. I clutch her to me, holding her as close as I can, our fingers linked, tears splashing down my face, wishing I could vanish into her lips and make her journey with her, praying that one day I can follow and taste her sweet flesh again. Then it\u0027s over. I feel it before we break, the way she goes limp, the fluttering of her eyelashes against my cheek, the diminishing action of her lips. Slowly I let her go, and she sinks back in her chair, Andeanna no more, just Etienne Anders, medium, channeller, bridge between worlds. \u0027Goodbye,\u0027 I whisper. And maybe it\u0027s an echo, or my imagination, or wishful thinking, but it seems to me that the air shimmers and the faintest voice carries to me on the lightest of breezes. \u0027Goodbye, Ed.\u0027 Then she\u0027s gone. It\u0027s over. And although I feel wretched, I feel wonderful too, because I\u0027ve been touched by the miraculous and I know that no matter how lonely I get, I\u0027ll never be truly alone again. Our loved ones don\u0027t leave us. They just move out of sight for a while, and wait . . . in the shades.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lady-of-the-shades/page-19.html","bookId":2235,"book":{"id":2235,"title":"Lady of the Shades","description":"Storyline: Ed, an American author on the hunt for a story for his next book, arrives in London looking for inspiration.
