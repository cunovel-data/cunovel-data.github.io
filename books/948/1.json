{"id":14531,"no":1,"title":"I: THE GIOCONDA SMILE Chapter 1","content":"\"Miss Spence will be down directly, sir.\" \"Thank you,\" said Mr. Hutton, without turning round. Janet Spence\u0027s parlourmaid was so ugly—ugly on purpose, it always seemed to him, malignantly, criminally ugly—that he could not bear to look at her more than was necessary. The door closed. Left to himself, Mr. Hutton got up and began to wander round the room, looking with meditative eyes at the familiar objects it contained. Photographs of Greek statuary, photographs of the Roman Forum, coloured prints of Italian masterpieces, all very safe and well known. Poor, dear Janet, what a prig—what an intellectual snob! Her real taste was illustrated in that water-colour by the pavement artist, the one she had paid half a crown for (and thirty-five shillings for the frame). How often his had heard her tell the story, how often expatiate on the beauties of that skilful imitation of an oleograph! \"A real Artist in the streets,\" and you could hear the capital A in Artist as she spoke the words. She made you feel that part of his glory had entered into Janet Spence when she tendered him that half-crown for the copy of the oleograph. She was implying a compliment to her own taste and penetration. A genuine Old Master for half a crown. Poor, dear Janet! Mr. Hutton came to a pause in front of a small oblong mirror. Stooping a little to get a full view of his face, he passed a white, well-manicured finger over his moustache. It was as curly, as freshly auburn as it had been twenty years ago. His hair still retained its colour, and there was no sign of baldness yet—only a certain elevation of the brow. \"Shakespearean,\" thought Mr. Hutton, with a smile, as he surveyed the smooth and polished expanse of his forehead. Others abide our question, thou art free.... Footsteps in the sea ... Majesty ... Shakespeare, thou shouldst be living at this hour. No, that was Milton, wasn\u0027t it? Milton, the Lady of Christ\u0027s. There was no lady about him. He was what the women, would call a manly man. That was why they liked him—for the curly auburn moustache and the discreet redolence of tobacco. Mr. Hutton smiled again; he enjoyed making fun of himself. Lady of Christ\u0027s? No, no. He was the Christ of Ladies. Very pretty, very pretty. The Christ of Ladies. Mr. Hutton wished there were somebody he could tell the joke to. Poor, dear Janet wouldn\u0027t appreciate it, alas? He straightened himself up, patted his hair, and resumed his peregrination. Damn the Roman Forum; he hated those dreary photographs. Suddenly he became aware that Janet Spence was in the room, standing near the door. Mr. Hutton started, as though he had been taken in some felonious act. To make these silent and spectral appearances was one of Janet Spence\u0027s peculiar talents. Perhaps she had been there all the time, had seen him looking at himself in the mirror. Impossible! But, still, it was disquieting. \"Oh, you gave me such a surprise,\" said Mr. Hutton, recovering his smile and advancing with outstretched hand to meet her. Miss Spence was smiling too: her Gioconda smile, he had once called it, in a moment of half-ironical flattery. Miss Spence had taken the compliment seriously, and had always tried to live up to the Leonardo standard. She smiled on his silence while Mr. Hutton shook hands; that was part of the Gioconda business. \"I hope you\u0027re well,\" said Mr. Hutton. \"You look it.\" What a queer face she had! That small mouth pursed forward by the Gioconda expression into a little snout with a round hole in the middle as though for whistling—it was like a penholder seen from the front. Above the mouth a well-shaped nose, finely aquiline. Eyes large, lustrous, and dark, with the largeness, lustre, and darkness that seems to invite sties and an occasional blood-shot suffusion. They were fine eyes, but unchangingly grave. The penholder might do its Gioconda trick, but the eyes never altered in their earnestness. Above them, a pair of boldly arched, heavily pencilled black eyebrows lent a surprising air of power, as of a Roman matron, to the upper portion of the face. Her hair was dark and equally Roman; Agrippina from the brows upward. \"I thought I\u0027d just look in on my way home,\" Mr. Hutton went on. \"Ah, it\u0027s good to be back here\"—he indicated with a wave of his hand the flowers in the vases, the sunshine and greenery beyond the windows —\"it\u0027s good to be back in the country after a stuffy day of business in town.\" Miss Spence, who had sat down, pointed to a chair at her side. \"No, really, I cant sit down,\" Mr. Hutton protested. \"I must get back to see how poor Emily is. She was rather seedy this morning.\" He sat down, nevertheless. \"It\u0027s these wretched liver chills. She\u0027s always getting them. Women—\" He broke off and coughed, so as to hide the fact that he had uttered. He was about to say that women with weak digestions ought not to marry; but the remark was too cruel, and he didn\u0027t really believe it. Janet Spence, moreover, was a believer in eternal flames and spiritual attachments. \"She hopes to be well enough,\" he added, \"to see you at luncheon to-morrow. Can you come? Do!\" He smiled persuasively. \"It\u0027s my invitation too, you know.\" She dropped her eyes, and Mr. Hutton almost thought that he detected a certain reddening of the cheek. It was a tribute; he stroked his moustache. \"I should like to come if you think Emily\u0027s really well enough to have a visitor.\" \"Of course. You\u0027ll do her good. You\u0027ll do us both good. In married life three is often better company than two.\" \"Oh, you\u0027re cynical.\" Mr. Hutton always had a desire to say \"Bow-wow-wow\" whenever that last word was spoken. It irritated him more than any other word in the language. But instead of barking he made haste to protest. \"No, no. I\u0027m only speaking a melancholy truth. Reality doesn\u0027t always come up to the ideal, you know. But that doesn\u0027t make me believe any the less in the ideal. Indeed, I believe in it passionately the ideal of a matrimony between two people in perfect accord. I think it\u0027s realisable. I\u0027m sure it is.\" He paused significantly and looked at her with an arch expression. A virgin of thirty-six, but still unwithered; she had her charms. And there was something really rather enigmatic about her. Miss Spence made no reply but continued to smile. There were times when Mr. Hutton got rather bored with the Gioconda. He stood up. \"I must really be going now. Farewell, mysterious Gioconda.\" The smile grew intenser, focused itself, as it were, in a narrower snout. Mr. Hutton made a Cinquecento gesture, and kissed her extended hand. It was the first time he had done such a thing; the action seemed not to be resented. \"I look forward to to-morrow.\" \"Do you?\" For answer Mr. Hutton once more kissed her hand, then turned to go. Miss Spence accompanied him to the porch. \"Where\u0027s your car?\" she asked. \"I left it at the gate of the drive.\" \"I\u0027ll come and see you off.\" \"No, no.\" Mr. Hutton was playful, but determined. \"You must do no such thing. I simply forbid you.\" \"But I should like to come,\" Miss Spence protested, throwing a rapid Gioconda at him. Mr. Hutton held up his hand. \"No,\" he repeated, and then, with a gesture that was almost the blowing of a kiss, he started to run down the drive, lightly on his toes, with long, bounding strides like a boy\u0027s. He was proud of that run; it was quite marvellously youthful. Still, he was glad the drive was no longer. At the last bend, before passing out of sight of the house, he halted and turned round. Miss Spence was still standing on the steps, smiling her smile. He waved his hand, and this time quite definitely and overtly wafted a kiss in her direction. Then, breaking once more into his magnificent canter, he rounded the last dark promontory of trees. Once out of sight of the house he let his high paces decline to a trot, and finally to a walk. He took out his handkerchief and began wiping his neck inside his collar. What fools, what fools! Had there ever been such an ass as poor, dear Janet Spence? Never, unless it was himself. Decidedly he was the more malignant fool, since he, at least, was aware of his folly and still persisted in it. Why did he persist? Ah, the problem that was himself, the problem that was other people. He had reached the gate. A large, prosperous-looking motor was standing at the side of the road. \"Home, M\u0027Nab.\" The chauffeur touched his cap. \"And stop at the cross-roads on the way, as usual,\" Mr. Hutton added, as he opened the door of the car. \"Well?\" he said, speaking into the obscurity that lurked within. \"Oh, Teddy Bear, what an age you\u0027ve been!\" It was a fresh and childish voice that spoke the words. There was the faintest hint of Cockney impurity about the vowel sounds. Mr. Hutton bent his large form and darted into the car with the agility of an animal regaining its burrow. \"Have I?\" he said, as he shut the door. The machine began to move. \"You must have missed me a lot if you found the time so long.\" He sat back in the low seat; a cherishing warmth enveloped him. \"Teddy Bear....\" and with a sigh of contentment a charming little head declined on to Mr. Hutton\u0027s shoulder. Ravished, he looked down sideways at the round, babyish face. \"Do you know, Doris, you look like the pictures of Louise de Kerouaille.\" He passed his fingers through a mass of curly hair. \"Who\u0027s Louise de Kera-whatever-it-is?\" Doris spoke from remote distances. \"She was, alas! Fuit. We shall all be \u0027was\u0027 one of these days. Meanwhile....\" Mr. Hutton covered the babyish face with kisses. The car rushed smoothly along. McNab\u0027s back, through the front window was stonily impassive, the back of a statue. \"Your hands,\" Doris whispered. \"Oh, you mustn\u0027t touch me. They give me electric shocks.\" Mr. Hutton adored her for the virgin imbecility of the words. How late in one\u0027s existence one makes the discovery of one\u0027s body! \"The electricity isn\u0027t in me, it\u0027s in you.\" He kissed her again, whispering her name several times: Doris, Doris, Doris. The scientific appellation of the sea-mouse, he was thinking as he kissed the throat, she offered him, white and extended like the throat of a victim awaiting the sacrificial knife. The sea-mouse was a sausage with iridescent fur: very peculiar. Or was Doris the sea cucumber, which turns itself inside out in moments of alarm? He would really have to go to Naples again, just to see the aquarium. These sea creatures were fabulous, unbelievably fantastic. \"Oh, Teddy Bear!\" (More zoology; but he was only a land animal. His poor little jokes!) \"Teddy Bear, I\u0027m so happy.\" \"So am I,\" said Mr. Hutton. Was it true? \"But I wish I knew if it were right. Tell me, Teddy Bear, is it right or wrong?\" \"Ah, my dear, that\u0027s just what I\u0027ve been wondering for the last thirty years.\" \"Be serious, Teddy Bear. I want to know if this is right; if it\u0027s right that I should be here with you and that we should love one another, and that it should give me electric shocks when you touch me.\" \"Right? Well, it\u0027s certainly good that you should have electric shocks rather than sexual repressions. Read Freud; repressions are the devil.\" \"Oh, you don\u0027t help me. Why aren\u0027t you ever serious? If only you knew how miserable I am sometimes, thinking it\u0027s not right. Perhaps, you know, there is a hell, and all that. I don t know what to do. Sometimes I think I ought to stop loving you.\" \"But could you?\" asked Mr. Hutton, confident in the powers of his seduction and his moustache. \"No, Teddy Bear, you know I couldn\u0027t. But I could run away, I could hide from you, I could lock myself up and force myself not to come to you.\" \"Silly little thing!\" He tightened his embrace. \"Oh, dear, I hope it isn\u0027t wrong. And there are times when I don\u0027t care if it is.\" Mr. Hutton was touched. He had a certain protective affection for this little creature. He laid his cheek against her hair and so, interlaced, they sat in silence, while the car, swaying and pitching a little as it hastened along, seemed to draw in the white road and the dusty hedges towards it devouringly. \"Good-bye, good-bye.\" The car moved on, gathered speed, vanished round a curve, and Doris was left standing by the sign-post at the cross-roads, still dizzy and weak with the languor born of those kisses and the electrical touch of those gentle hands. She had to take a deep breath, to draw herself up deliberately, before she was strong enough to start her homeward walk. She had half a mile in which to invent the necessary lies. Alone, Mr. Hutton suddenly found himself the prey of an appalling boredom.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3096/85390.html","bookId":948,"book":{"id":948,"title":"Mortal Coils","description":"简介： Thank you, said Mr. Hutton, without turning round.
