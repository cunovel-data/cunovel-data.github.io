{"id":14538,"no":8,"title":"III: THE TILLOTSON BANQUET Chapter 1","content":"Young Spode was not a snob; he was too intelligent for that, too fundamentally decent. Not a snob; but all the same he could not help feeling very well pleased at the thought that he was dining, alone and intimately, with Lord Badgery. It was a definite event in his life, a step forward, he felt, towards that final success, social, material, and literary, which he had come to London with the fixed intention of making. The conquest and capture of Badgery was an almost essential strategical move in the campaign. Edmund, forty-seventh Baron Badgery, was a lineal descendant of that Edmund, surnamed Le Blayreau, who landed on English soil in the train of William the Conqueror. Ennobled by William Rufus, the Badgerys had been one of the very few baronial families to survive the Wars of the Roses and all the other changes and chances of English history. They were a sensible and philoprogenitive race. No Badgery had ever fought in any war, no Badgery had ever engaged in any kind of politics. They had been content to live and quietly to propagate their species in a huge machicolated Norman castle, surrounded by a triple moat, only sallying forth to cultivate their property and to collect their rents. In the eighteenth century, when life had become relatively secure, the Badgerys began to venture forth into civilised society. From boorish squires they blossomed into grands seigneurs, patrons of the arts, virtuosi. Their property was large, they were rich; and with the growth of industrialism their riches also grew. Villages on their estate turned into manufacturing towns, unsuspected coal was discovered beneath the surface of their barren moorlands. By the middle of the nineteenth century the Badgerys were among the richest of English noble families. The forty-seventh baron disposed of an income of at least two hundred thousand pounds a year. Following the great Badgery tradition, he had refused to have anything to do with politics or war. He occupied himself by collecting pictures; he took an interest in theatrical productions; he was the friend and patron of men of letters, of painters, and musician. A personage, in a word, of considerable consequence in that particular world in which young Spode had elected to make his success. Spode had only recently left the university. Simon Gollamy, the editor of the World\u0027s Review (the \"Best of all possible Worlds\"), had got to know him—he was always on the look out for youthful talent—had seen possibilities in the young man, and appointed him art critic of his paper. Gollamy liked to have young and teachable people about him. The possession of disciples flattered his vanity, and he found it easier, moreover, to run his paper with docile collaborators than with men grown obstinate and case-hardened with age. Spode had not done badly at his new job. At any rate, his articles had been intelligent enough to arouse the interest of Lord Badgery. It was, ultimately, to them that he owed the honour of sitting to night in the dining-room of Badgery House. Fortified by several varieties of wine and a glass of aged brandy, Spode felt more confident and at ease than he had done the whole evening. Badgery was rather a disquieting host. He had an alarming habit of changing the subject of any conversation that had lasted for more than two minutes. Spode had found it, for example, horribly mortifying when his host, cutting across what was, he prided himself, a particularly subtle and illuminating disquisition on baroque art, had turned a wandering eye about the room and asked him abruptly whether he liked parrots. He had flushed and glanced suspiciously towards him, fancying that the man was trying to be offensive. But no; Badgery\u0027s white, fleshy, Hanoverian face wore an expression of perfect good faith. There was no malice in his small greenish eyes. He evidently did genuinely want to know if Spode liked parrots. The young man swallowed his irritation and replied that he did. Badgery then told a good story about parrots. Spode was on the point of capping it with a better story, when his host began to talk about Beethoven. And so the game went on. Spode cut his conversation to suit his host\u0027s requirements. In the course of ten minutes he had made a more or less witty epigram on Benvenuto Cellini, Queen Victoria, sport, God, Stephen Phillips, and Moorish architecture. Lord Badgery thought him the most charming young man, and so intelligent. \"If you\u0027ve quite finished your coffee,\" he said, rising to his feet as he spoke, \"we\u0027ll go and look at the pictures.\" Spode jumped up with alacrity, and only then realised that he had drunk just ever so little too much. He would have to be careful, talk deliberately, plant his feet consciously, one after the other. \"This house is quite cluttered up with pictures,\" Lord Badgery complained. \"I had a whole wagon-load taken away to the country last week; but there are still far too many. My ancestors would have their portraits painted by Romney. Such a shocking artist, don\u0027t you think? Why couldn\u0027t they have chosen Gainsborough, or even Reynolds? I\u0027ve had all the Romneys hung in the servants\u0027 hall now. It\u0027s such a comfort to know that one can never possibly see them again. I suppose you know all about the ancient Hittites?\" \"Well....\" the young man replied, with befitting modesty. \"Look at that, then.\" He indicated a large stone head which stood in a case near the dining-room door. \"It\u0027s not Greek, or Egyptian, or Persian, or anything else; so if it isn\u0027t ancient Hittite, I don\u0027t know what it is. And that reminds me of that story about Lord George Sanger, the Circus King....\" and, without giving Spode time to examine the Hittite relic, he led the way up the huge staircase, pausing every now and then in his anecdote to point out some new object of curiosity or beauty. \"I suppose you know Deburau\u0027s pantomimes?\" Spode rapped out as soon as the story was over. He was in an itch to let out his information about Deburau. Badgery had given him a perfect opening with his ridiculous Sanger. \"What a perfect man, isn\u0027t he? He used to....\" \"This is my main gallery,\" said Lord Badgery, throwing open one leaf of a tall folding door. \"I must apologise for it. It looks like a roller-skating rink.\" He fumbled with the electric switches and there was suddenly light—light that revealed an enormous gallery, duly receding into distance according to all the laws of perspective. \"I dare say you\u0027ve heard of my poor father,\" Lord Badgery continued. \"A little insane, you know; sort of mechanical genius with a screw loose. He used to have a toy railway in this room. No end of fun he had, crawling about the floor after his trains. And all the pictures were stacked in the cellars. I can\u0027t tell you what they were like when I found them: mushrooms growing out of the Botticellis. Now I\u0027m rather proud of this Poussin; he painted it for Scarron.\" \"Exquisite!\" Spode exclaimed, making with his hand a gesture as though he were modelling a pure form in the air. \"How splendid the onrush of those trees and leaning figures is! And the way they re caught up, as it were, and stemmed by that single godlike form opposing them with his contrary movement! And the draperies....\" But Lord Badgery had moved on, and was standing in front of a little fifteenth-century Virgin of carved wood. \"School of Rheims,\" he explained. They \"did\" the gallery at high speed. Badgery never permitted his guest to halt for more than forty seconds before any work of art. Spode would have liked to spend a few moments of recollection and tranquillity in front of some of these lovely things. But it was not permitted. The gallery done, they passed into a little room leading out of it. At the sight of what the lights revealed, Spode gasped. \"It\u0027s like something out of Balzac,\" he exclaimed. \"Un de ces salons dorés où se déploie un luxe insolent. You know.\" \"My nineteenth-century chamber,\" Badgery explained. \"The best thing of its kind, I flatter myself, outside the State Apartments at Windsor.\" Spode tiptoed round the room, peering with astonishment at all the objects in glass, in gilded bronze, in china, in leathers, in embroidered and painted silk, in beads, in wax, objects of the most fantastic shapes and colours, all the queer products of a decadent tradition, with which the room was crowded. There were paintings on the walls—a Martin, a Wilkie, an early Landseer, several Ettys, a big Haydon, a slight pretty water-colour of a girl by Wainewright, the pupil of Blake and arsenic poisoner, a score of others. But the picture which arrested Spode\u0027s attention was a medium sized canvas representing Troilus riding into Troy among the flowers and plaudits of an admiring crowd, and oblivious (you could see from his expression) of everything but the eyes of Cressida, who looked down at him from a window, with Pandarus smiling over her shoulder. \"What an absurd and enchanting picture!\" Spode exclaimed. \"Ah, you\u0027ve spotted my Troilus.\" Lord Badgery was pleased. \"What bright harmonious colours! Like Etty\u0027s, only stronger, not so obviously pretty. And there\u0027s an energy about it that reminds one of Haydon. Only Haydon could never have done anything so impeccable in taste. Who is it by?\" Spode turned to his host inquiringly. \"You were right in detecting Haydon,\" Lord Badgery answered, \"It\u0027s by his pupil, Tillotson. I wish I could get hold of more of his work. But nobody seems to know anything about him. And he seems to have done so little.\" This time it was the younger man who interrupted. \"Tillotson, Tillotson....\" He put his hand to his forehead. A frown incongruously distorted his round, floridly curved face. No ... yes, I have it. He looked up triumphantly with serene and childish brows. \"Tillotson, Walter Tillotson—the man\u0027s still alive.\" Badgery smiled. \"This picture was painted in 1846, you know.\" \"Well, that\u0027s all right. Say he was born in 1820, painted his masterpiece when he was twenty-six, and it\u0027s 1913 now; that\u0027s to say he\u0027s only ninety-three. Not as old as Titian yet.\" \"But he\u0027s not been heard of since 1860,\" Lord Badgery protested. \"Precisely. Your mention of his name reminded me of the discovery I made the other day when I was looking through the obituary notices in the archives of the World\u0027s Review.(One has to bring them up to date every year or so for fear of being caught napping if one of these t old birds chooses to shuffle off suddenly.) Well, there, among them—I remember my astonishment at the time—there I found Walter Tillotson\u0027s biography. Pretty full to 1860, and then a blank, except for a pencil note in the early nineteen hundreds to the effect that he had returned from the East. The obituary has never been used or added to. I draw the obvious conclusion: the old chap isn\u0027t dead yet. He\u0027s just been overlooked somehow.\" \"But this is extraordinary,\" Lord Badgery exclaimed. \"You must find him, Spode—you must find him. I\u0027ll commission him to paint frescoes round this room. It\u0027s just what I\u0027ve always vainly longed for a real nineteenth-century artist to decorate this place for me. Oh, we must find him at once—at once.\" Lord Badgery strode up and down in a state of great excitement. \"I can see how this room could be made quite perfect,\" he went on. \"We\u0027d clear away all these cases and have the whole of that wall filled by a heroic fresco of Hector and Andromache, or \u0027Distraining for Rent\u0027, or Fanny Kemble as Belvidera in \u0027Venice Preserved\u0027 anything like that, provided it\u0027s in the grand manner of the \u0027thirties and \u0027forties. And here I\u0027d have a landscape with lovely receding perspectives, or else something architectural and grand in the style of Belshazzar\u0027s feast. Then we\u0027ll have this Adam fireplace taken down and replaced by something Mauro-Gothic. And on these walls I\u0027ll have mirrors, or no! let me see....\" He sank into meditative silence, from which he finally roused himself to shout: \"The old man, the old man! Spode, we must find this astonishing old creature. And don\u0027t breathe a word to anybody. Tillotson shall be our secret. Oh, it\u0027s too perfect, it\u0027s incredible! Think of the frescoes.\" Lord Badgery\u0027s face had become positively animated. He had talked of a single subject for nearly a quarter of an hour. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3096/85397.html","bookId":948,"book":{"id":948,"title":"Mortal Coils","description":"简介： Thank you, said Mr. Hutton, without turning round.
