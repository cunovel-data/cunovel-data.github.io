{"id":14535,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"For a good many days the Hutton case had a place on the front page of every newspaper. There had been no more popular murder trial since George Smith had temporarily eclipsed the European War by drowning in a warm bath his seventh bride. The public imagination was stirred by this tale of a murder brought to light months after the date of the crime. Here, it was felt, was one of those incidents in human life, so notable because they are so rare, which do definitely justify the ways of God to man. A wicked man had been moved by an illicit passion to kill his wife. For months he had lived in sin and fancied security——only to be dashed at last more horribly into the pit he had prepared for himself. Murder will out, and here was a case of it. The readers of the newspapers were in a position to follow every movement of the hand of God. There had been vague, but persistent, rumours in the neighbourhood; the police had taken action at last. Then came the exhumation order, the post-mortem examination, the inquest, the evidence of the experts, the verdict of the coroner\u0027s jury, the trial, the condemnation. For once Providence had done its duty, obviously, grossly, didactically, as in a melodrama. The newspapers were right in making of the case the staple intellectual food of a whole season. Mr. Hutton\u0027s first emotion when he was summoned from Italy to give evidence at the inquest was one of indignation. It was a monstrous, a scandalous thing that the police should take such idle, malicious gossip seriously. When the inquest was over he would bring an action for malicious prosecution against the Chief Constable; he would sue the Spence woman for slander. The inquest was opened; the astonishing evidence unrolled itself. The experts had examined the body, and had found traces of arsenic; they were of opinion that the late Mrs. Hutton had died of arsenic poisoning. Arsenic poisoning.... Emily had died of arsenic poisoning? After that, Mr. Hutton learned with surprise that there was enough arsenicated insecticide in his green-houses to poison an army. It was now, quite suddenly, that he saw it: there was a case against him. Fascinated, he watched it growing, growing, like some monstrous tropical plant. It was enveloping him, surrounding him; he was lost in a tangled forest. When was the poison administered? The experts agreed that it must have been swallowed eight or nine hours before death. About lunch-time? Yes, about lunch-time. Clara, the parlour-maid, was called. Mrs. Hutton, she remembered, had asked her to go and fetch her medicine. Mr. Hutton had volunteered to go instead; he had gone alone. Miss Spence—ah, the memory of the storm, the white aimed face! the horror of it all!—Miss Spence confirmed Clara\u0027s statement, and added that Mr. Hutton had come back with the medicine already poured out in a wineglass, not in the bottle. Mr. Hutton\u0027s indignation evaporated. He was dismayed, frightened. It was all too fantastic to be taken seriously, and yet this nightmare was a fact it was actually happening. M\u0027Nab had seen them kissing, often. He had taken them for a drive on the day of Mrs. Hutton\u0027s death. He could see them reflected in the wind-screen, sometimes out of the tail of his eye. The inquest was adjourned. That evening Doris went to bed with a headache. When he went to her room after dinner, Mr. Hutton found her crying. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" He sat down on the edge of her bed and began to stroke her hair. For a long time she did not answer, and he went on stroking her hair mechanically, almost unconsciously; sometimes, even he bent down and kissed her bare shoulder. He had his own affairs, however, to think about. What had happened? How was it that the stupid gossip had actually come true? Emily had died of arsenic poisoning. It was absurd, impossible. The order of things had been broken, and he was at the mercy of an irresponsibility. What had happened, what was going to happen? He was interrupted in the midst of his thoughts. \"It\u0027s my fault—it\u0027s my fault!\" Doris suddenly sobbed out. \"I shouldn\u0027t have loved you; I oughtn\u0027t to have let you love me. Why was I ever born?\" Mr. Hutton didn\u0027t say anything but looked down in silence at the abject figure of misery lying on the bed. \"If they do anything to you I shall kill myself.\" She sat up, held him for a moment at arm\u0027s length, and looked at him with a kind of violence, as though she were never to see him again. \"I love you, I love you, I love you.\" She drew him, inert and passive, towards her, clasped him, pressed herself against him. \"I didn\u0027t know you loved me as much as that, Teddy Bear. But why did you do it—why did you do it?\" Mr. Hutton undid her clasping arms and got up. His face became very red. \"You seem to take it for granted that I murdered my wife,\" he said. \"It\u0027s really too grotesque. What do you all take me for? A cinema hero?\" He had begun to lose his temper. All the exasperation, all the fear and bewilderment of the day, was transformed into a violent anger against her. \"It\u0027s all such damned stupidity. Haven\u0027t you any conception of a civilised man\u0027s mentality? Do I look the sort of man who\u0027d go about slaughtering people? I suppose you imagined I was so insanely in love with you that I could commit any folly. When will you women understand that one isn\u0027t insanely in love? All one asks for is a quiet life, which you won\u0027t allow one to have. I don\u0027t know what the devil ever induced me to marry you. It was all a damned stupid, practical joke. And now you go about saying I\u0027m a murderer. I won\u0027t stand it.\" Mr. Hutton stamped towards the door. He had said horrible things, he knew—odious things that he ought speedily to unsay. But he wouldn\u0027t. He closed the door behind him. \"Teddy Bear!\" He turned the handle; the latch clicked into place. Teddy Bear! The voice that came to him through the closed door was agonised. Should he go back? He ought to go back. He touched the handle, then withdrew his fingers and quickly walked away. When he was half-way down the stairs he halted. She might try to do something silly—throw herself out of the window or God knows what! He listened attentively; there was no sound. But he pictured her very clearly, tiptoeing across the room, lifting the sash as high as it would go, leaning out into the cold night air. It was raining a little. Under the window lay the paved terrace. How far below? Twenty-five or thirty feet? Once, when he was walking along Piccadilly, a dog had jumped out of a third-storey window of the Ritz. He had seen it fall; he had heard it strike the pavement. Should he go back? He was damned if he would; he hated her. He sat for a long time in the library. What had happened? What was happening? He turned the question over and over in his mind and could find no answer. Suppose the nightmare dreamed itself out to its horrible conclusion. Death was waiting for him. His eyes filled with tears; he wanted so passionately to live. \"Just to be alive.\" Poor Emily had wished it too, he remembered: \"Just to be alive.\" There were still so many places in this astonishing world unvisited, so many queer delightful people still unknown, so many lovely women never so much as seen. The huge white oxen would still be dragging their wains along the Tuscan roads, the cypresses would still go up, straight as pillars, to the blue heaven; but he would not be there to see them. And the sweet southern wines—Tear of Christ and Blood of Judas—others would drink them, not he. Others would walk down the obscure and narrow lanes between the bookshelves in the London Library, sniffing the dusty perfume of good literature, peering at strange titles, discovering unknown names, exploring the fringes of vast domains of knowledge. He would be lying in a hole in the ground. And why, why? Confusedly he felt that some extraordinary kind of justice was being done. In the past he had been wanton and imbecile and irresponsible. Now Fate was playing as wantonly, as irresponsibly, with him. It was tit for tat, and God existed after all. He felt that he would like to pray. Forty years ago he used to kneel by his bed every evening. The nightly formula of his childhood came to him almost unsought from some long unopened chamber of the memory. \"God bless Father and Mother, Tom and Cissie and the Baby, Mademoiselle and Nurse, and everyone that I love, and make me a good boy. Amen.\" They were all dead now all except Cissie. His mind seemed to soften and dissolve; a great calm descended upon his spirit. He went upstairs to ask Doris\u0027s forgiveness. He found her lying on the couch at the foot of the bed. On the floor beside her stood a blue bottle of liniment, marked \"Not to be taken\"; she seemed to have drunk about half of it. \"You didn\u0027t love me,\" was all she said when she opened her eyes to find him bending over her. Dr. Libbard arrived in time to prevent any very serious consequences. \"You mustn\u0027t do this again,\" he said while Mr. Hutton was out of the room. \"What\u0027s to prevent me?\" she asked defiantly. Dr. Libbard looked at her with his large, sad eyes. \"There\u0027s nothing to prevent you,\" he said. \"Only yourself and your baby. Isn\u0027t it rather bad luck on your baby, not allowing it to come into the world because you want to go out of it?\" Doris was silent for a time. \"All right,\" she whispered. \"I won\u0027t.\" Mr. Hutton sat by her bedside for the rest of the night. He felt himself now to be indeed a murderer. For a time he persuaded himself that he loved this pitiable child. Dozing in his chair, he woke up, stiff and cold, to find himself drained dry, as it were, of every emotion. He had become nothing but a tired and suffering carcase. At six o\u0027clock he undressed and went to bed for a couple of hours\u0027 sleep. In the course of the same afternoon the coroner\u0027s jury brought in a verdict of \"Wilful Murder,\" and Mr. Hutton was committed for trial.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3096/85394.html","bookId":948,"book":{"id":948,"title":"Mortal Coils","description":"简介： Thank you, said Mr. Hutton, without turning round.
