{"id":14539,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"Three weeks later Lord Badgery was aroused from his usual after-luncheon somnolence by the arrival of a telegram. The message was a short one. \"Found.—SPODE.\" A look of pleasure and intelligence made human Lord Badgery\u0027s clayey face of surfeit. \"No answer,\" he said. The footman padded away on noiseless feet. Lord Badgery closed his eyes and began to contemplate. Found! What a room he would have! There would be nothing like it in the world. The frescoes, the fireplace, the mirrors, the ceiling.... And a small, shrivelled old man clambering about the scaffolding, agile and quick like one of those whiskered little monkeys at the Zoo, painting away, painting away.... Fanny Kemble as Belvidera, Hector and Andromache, or why not the Duke of Clarence in the Butt, the Duke of Malmsey, the Butt of Clarence. ... Lord Badgery was asleep. Spode did not lag long behind his telegram. He was at Badgery House by six o\u0027clock. His lordship was in the nineteenth-century chamber, engaged in clearing away with his own hands the bric-à-brac. Spode found him looking hot and out of breath. \"Ah, there you are,\" said Lord Badgery. You see me already preparing for the great man\u0027s coming. Now you must tell me all about him. \"He\u0027s older even than I thought,\" said Spode. \"He\u0027s ninety-seven this year. Born in 1816. Incredible, isn\u0027t it! There, I\u0027m beginning at the wrong end.\" \"Begin where you like,\" said Badgery genially. \"I won\u0027t tell you all the incidents of the hunt. You\u0027ve no idea what a job I had to run him to earth. It was like a Sherlock Holmes story, immensely elaborate, too elaborate. I shall write a book about it some day. At any rate, I found him at last.\" \"Where?\" \"In a sort of respectable slum in Holloway, older and poorer and lonelier than you could have believed possible. I found out how it was he came to be forgotten, how he came to drop out of life in the way he did. He took it into his head, somewhere about the \u0027sixties, to go to Palestine to get local colour for his religious pictures—scapegoats and things, you know. Well, he went to Jerusalem and then on to Mount Lebanon and on and on, and then, somewhere in the middle of Asia Minor, he got stuck. He got stuck for about forty years.\" \"But what did he do all that time?\" \"Oh, he painted, and started a mission, and converted three Turks, and taught the local Pashas the rudiments of English, Latin, and perspective, and God knows what else. Then, in about 1904, it seems to have occurred to him that he was getting rather old and had been away from home for rather a long time. So he made his way back to England, only to find that everyone he had known was dead, that the dealers had never heard of him and wouldn\u0027t buy his pictures, that he was simply a ridiculous old figure of fun. So he got a job as a drawing-master in a girl\u0027s school in Holloway, and there he\u0027s been ever since, growing older and older, and feebler and feebler, and blinder and deafer, and generally more gaga, until finally the school has given him the sack. He had about ten pounds in the world when I found him. He lives in a kind of black hole in a basement full of beetles. When his ten pounds are spent, I suppose he\u0027ll just quietly die there.\" Badgery held up a white hand. \"No more, no more. I find literature quite depressing enough. I insist that life at least shall be a little gayer. Did you tell him I wanted him to paint my room?\" \"But he can\u0027t paint. He\u0027s too blind and palsied.\" \"Can\u0027t paint?\" Badgery exclaimed in horror. \"Then what\u0027s the good of the old creature?\" \"Well, if you put it like that....\" Spode began. \"I shall never have my frescoes. Ring the bell, will you?\" Spode rang. \"What right has Tillotson to go on existing if he can\u0027t paint?\" went on Lord Badgery petulantly. \"After all, that was his only justification for occupying a place in the sun.\" \"He doesn\u0027t have much sun in his basement.\" The footman appeared at the door. \"Get someone to put all these things back in their places,\" Lord Badgery commanded, indicating with a wave of the hand the ravaged cases, the confusion of glass and china with which he had littered the floor, the pictures unhooked. \"We\u0027ll go to the library, Spode; it\u0027s more comfortable there.\" He led the way through the long gallery and down the stairs. \"I\u0027m sorry old Tillotson has been such a disappointment,\" said Spode sympathetically. \"Let us talk about something else; he ceases to interest me. \"But don\u0027t you think we ought to do something about him? He\u0027s only got ten pounds between him and the workhouse. And if you\u0027d seen the black-beetles in his basement!\" \"Enough enough. I\u0027ll do everything you think fitting.\" \"I thought we might get up a subscription amongst lovers of the arts.\" \"There aren\u0027t any,\" said Badgery. \"No; but there are plenty of people who will subscribe out of snobbism.\" \"Not unless you give them something for their money.\" \"That\u0027s true. I hadn\u0027t thought of that.\" Spode was silent for a moment. \"We might have a dinner in his honour. The Great Tillotson Banquet. Doyen of the British Art. A Link with the Past. Can\u0027t you see it in the papers? I\u0027d make a stunt of it in the World\u0027s Review. That ought to bring in the snobs.\" \"And we\u0027ll invite a lot of artists and critics—all the ones who can\u0027t stand one another. It will be fun to see them squabbling.\" Badgery laughed. Then his face darkened once again. \"Still,\" he added, \"it\u0027ll be a very poor second best to my frescoes. You\u0027ll stay to dinner, of course.\" \"Well, since you suggest it. Thanks very much.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3096/85398.html","bookId":948,"book":{"id":948,"title":"Mortal Coils","description":"简介： Thank you, said Mr. Hutton, without turning round.
