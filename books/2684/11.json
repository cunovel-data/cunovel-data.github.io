{"id":69540,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Clifton is the one I lobbied hard for to be in Concealed, the one I took back to Doheny when I found out he was dating an actress I\u0027d been interested in and who showed no interest in me since there was nothing I could offer her. It was made clear what Clifton needed to do if he wanted me to lobby for him. The actor eyed me with a chilled-out glare in the lounge of a restaurant on La Cienega. \"I\u0027m not looking for a dude,\" the actor said. \"And even if I was, you\u0027re not him.\" In the jovial language of men I suggested that if he didn\u0027t comply I would try to make sure he wouldn\u0027t get the part. There was so little hesitancy that the moment became even more unsettling than I had initially made it. The actor simply sighed, \"Let\u0027s roll.\" I couldn\u0027t tell if the indifference was real or faked. He was planning a career. This was a necessary step. It was just another character he was playing in the bedroom on the fifteenth floor of the Doheny Plaza that night. The BlackBerry on the nightstand that kept flashing, the fake tan and the waxed ass**le, the dealer in the Valley who never showed up, the drunken complaints about the Jaguar that had to be sold - the details were so common that it could have been anyone. The same actor came in this morning and smiled briefly at me, did a shaky reading, then improved slightly on the second reading. Whenever I saw him at a party or a restaurant he would casually avoid me, even when I offered my condolences about his girlfriend, that young actress I had wanted, who overdosed on her meds. Since she had a small role in a hit TV show her death was recognized.\n \"He\u0027s twenty-four,\" Jason complains.\n \"But he\u0027s still really cute.\" The director mentions the whispers about Clifton\u0027s sexual orientation, a supposed gig on a p**n site years ago, a rumor about a very famous actor and a tryst in Santa Barbara and Clifton\u0027s denial in a Rolling Stone cover story about the very famous actor\u0027s new movie which Clifton had a small part in: \"We\u0027re so into girls it\u0027s ridiculous.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never gotten the g*y vibe,\" the director says. \"He butches it up, I guess.\"\n And then we refocus on the girls.\n \"Who are we seeing next?\"\n \"Rain Turner,\" someone says.\n Curious, I look up from Laurie\u0027s messages that I keep deleting and reach for a headshot. Just as I lift it off the table the girl from the veranda at Trent and Blair\u0027s house in Bel Air walks in and I have to pretend I\u0027m not trapped. The blue eyes are complementing a light blue V-neck and a navy-blue miniskirt, something a girl would have worn in 1985 when the movie takes place. Immediately introductions are made and the audition happens - bad, strident, one-note, every other line needs to be reread to her by the director - but something else starts happening. Her stare is a gaze, and my gaze back is the beginning of it, and I imagine the future: Why do you hate me? I imagine a girl\u0027s anguished voice. What did I ever do to you? I imagine someone else screaming.\n During the audition I look at Rain Turner\u0027s IMDb page on my laptop. She reads for another role and I realize with a panic that she\u0027ll never get a callback. She\u0027s simply another girl who has gotten by on her looks - her currency in this world - and it will not be fun to watch her grow old. These simple facts I know so well still make everything seem freshly complicated to me. Suddenly I get a text - Quien es? - and it takes me a while to realize it\u0027s from the girl I was flirting with in the Admiral\u0027s Club at JFK the afternoon I flew out here. When I look up again I also realize I\u0027ve never noticed the white Christmas tree standing by the pool or that the Christmas tree is framed within the window next to the wall with the poster for Sunset Boulevard on it.\n I\u0027m walking Rain to her car outside the offices on Washington Boulevard.\n \"So, is this the movie you wanted to put me in?\" she asks.\n \"It could be,\" I say. \"I didn\u0027t think you recognized me.\"\n \"Of course I recognized you.\"\n \"I\u0027m flattered.\" I pause, and then go for it: \"Why didn\u0027t you introduce yourself to the producer instead? He was at the party.\"\n She smiles as if amazed, then raises an arm to hit me. I back off playfully.\n \"Are you usually this brazen before cocktail hour?\" she asks. \"Jeez.\" She\u0027s charming but there\u0027s something rehearsed about the charm, something brittle. The amazed smile seems innocent only because something else is always lurking along its borders.\n \"Or maybe you should have introduced yourself to the director?\" I joke.\n She laughs. \"The director has a wife.\"\n \"His wife lives in Australia.\"\n \"I heard he doesn\u0027t like girls,\" she stage-whispers. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-11.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: \n Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
