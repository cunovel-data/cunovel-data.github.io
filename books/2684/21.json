Someone I\u0027m working with.\"\\n\\n \"Who is it?\" she asks. \"Do I know them?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s an actress,\" I say. \"Her name\u0027s Rain Turner.\"\\n\\n Blair is silent. Whatever we had recovered earlier in the phone call is now gone.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s an actress,\" I repeat. \"Hello?\"\\n\\n Blair doesn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \"Blair?\"\\n\\n \"Look, I thought maybe you\u0027d come solo, but I don\u0027t want her here,\" she says quickly. \"I would never have allowed her to come here.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" I ask in a warning voice. \"Do you know her?\"\\n\\n \"Look, Clay - \"\\n\\n \"Oh, f**k this,\" I say. \"Why would you invite me anyway, Blair? What are you doing? Are you trying to f**k with me? Are you still pissed? It\u0027s been over two years, Blair.\"\\n\\n After a pause, she says, \"I think we should talk.\"\\n\\n \"About what?\"\\n\\n She pauses again. \"Meet me somewhere.\"\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t we talk now?\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t talk over the phone.\"\\n\\n \"Why not, Blair?\"\\n\\n \"Because none of these lines are secure.\"\\n\\n Turning off Sunset onto Stone Canyon I drive into the darkness of the canyons and valet park the BMW at the Hotel Bel-Air. I walk across the bridge past the swans floating in the pond and make my way to the dining room but Blair\u0027s not there and when I ask the hostess I find out she didn\u0027t make a reservation and outside I look around the patio but she\u0027s not there either and I\u0027m about to call her when I realize I don\u0027t have her number. As I walk to the front desk I\u0027m suddenly aware of how much effort I made to look nice even though nothing was going to happen. The receptionist tells me what room Mrs. Burroughs is in.\\n\\n I pace around the grounds debating something and then I give up and walk to the room and knock. When Blair opens the door I walk in past her.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not going to happen.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s not going to happen?\"\\n\\n \"This.\" I make a tired gesture with my arm across the suite.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not why we\u0027re ... \" She looks away.\\n\\n Blair\u0027s wearing loose cotton pants and she has no makeup on and her hair\u0027s pulled back and whatever work she has had done you can\u0027t tell and she\u0027s sitting on the edge of the bed next to a Michael Kors bag and she\u0027s not wearing her wedding ring.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just a suite that Trent keeps,\" she says.\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" I say, pacing. \"Where\u0027s Trent?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s still upset about Kelly Montrose,\" Blair says. \"They were close. Trent represented him for a while.\" She pauses. \"Trent\u0027s helping plan the memorial.\"\\n\\n \"What did you think was going to happen?\" I ask. \"Why am I here?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why you keep - \"\\n\\n Chapter 6\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not going to happen, Blair.\"\\n\\n \"You can stop saying that, Clay,\" she says, an edge in her voice. \"I know.\"\\n\\n I open the minibar. I don\u0027t even look at what bottle I take out. Annoyed, shaky, I pour myself a drink.\\n\\n \"But why wouldn\u0027t it happen?\" Blair asks. \"Is it because of her? The girl you wanted to bring to my house?\" She pauses. \"The actress?\" She pauses again. \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027d be upset about that?\"\\n\\n \"What do you want to talk about?\" I ask impatiently.\\n\\n \"I guess in a way it\u0027s about Julian.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah? What about him?\" I down the drink. \"You were having an affair with him? You guys hooked up? What?\"\\n\\n When Blair bites her lower lip she\u0027s eighteen again.\\n\\n \"Julian told you?\" she asks. \"Is that how you know?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just guessing, Blair,\" I say. \"You told me to stay away from him, remember?\" And then: \"What does it matter? It\u0027s been over for a year, right?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-21.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
