When I reach into my pocket for the iPhone three consecutive texts read: why are u with him? Why Are You With Him??? WHY ARE YOU WITH HIM??? I\u0027m not listening to anything Trent says until I hear \"As of now, you\u0027ve officially made yourself a target\" because this reminds me of what Rip Millar told me in the back of the limousine a few nights ago. \"What?\" I look up from the phone and then glance fearfully down the boardwalk at the guy in the windbreaker, who has appeared again, pretending to stare dreamily into the hazy distance. Chapter 13 \"Someone could be setting you up,\" Trent says. \"Being set up for what?\" Trent notices something as I light a cigarette. \"Your hand is shaking,\" he says. \"You can\u0027t smoke here.\" \"I don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s around to enforce that.\" On the roof of the Mexican restaurant someone is scanning the pier with a pair of binoculars. And then I realize that the guy who\u0027s been following us is taking more pictures, his camera aimed at the ocean even though the haze makes these pictures almost impossible, unless instead he\u0027s taking pictures of two guys leaning against the railing at the end of the Santa Monica pier, one of them smoking a cigarette, the other one backed away from him in frustration. The windbreaker guy crosses the pier again as if he\u0027s looking for a better angle and I don\u0027t say anything to Trent because he hasn\u0027t noticed the guy and the empty roller-coaster cars glide slowly down their tracks, slipping in and out of the haze, and someone faintly sings you\u0027re still the one from a radio inside a surf shop and on the beach a surfer shuffles through the sand near the water\u0027s edge, a towel wrapped around his head like a turban. \"You know she came on to Mark,\" Trent says. \"Or did you know that?\" I keep looking at the phone. WHAT IS HE TELLING YOU?!? \"She tried to f**k him,\" Trent says. \"He wasn\u0027t interested. He laughed about it. It was the night after the audition and she sent him pictures of herself. She told him he could f**k her if he wanted to.\" I look back at the roof of the restaurant and then I squint at the blond guy with the camera, now disappearing into the haze. \"He said she was too old for him - \" \"Are you trying to make me angry?\" Trent moves into another tactic. \"Daniel Carter\u0027s interested in doing Adrenaline. He wants to make it his next movie. We could make that happen.\" Trent looks at me hopefully. \"Would that mollify you?\" \"What are you doing, Trent? Why are you here?\" I mutter. \"If you\u0027re not going to talk straight to me then I\u0027m leaving.\" \"Just walk away. Just leave her alone. I\u0027m just asking you to walk away from her and leave it alone.\" Trent pauses. \"You don\u0027t need to know why. You\u0027re not going to get any answers. I doubt it would matter to you if you had them anyway.\" \"I don\u0027t give a shit about what you want.\" I pause. \"What I want to know is what happens if I go to the police? What if I lay out a scenario and I think it\u0027s a pretty goddamn plausible one about Rip Millar and what happened to Kelly Montrose and what if I go to the police and - \" \"No, you won\u0027t do that,\" Trent says tiredly, turning away from me. \"You won\u0027t do that, Clay.\" \"Why are you so sure about that?\" I toss the cigarette, half smoked, onto the pier and grind it out with my shoe. \"That girl you beat up?\" Trent says. \"The actress. The one from Pasadena?\" I immediately start walking away from Trent. \"The one that your scumbag lawyer paid off? Two years ago?\" Trent keeps following me. \"She\u0027s willing to talk,\" Trent says, keeping up. \"Did you know she was pregnant at the time of the assault? Did you know that she lost the baby?\" Amanda Flew\u0027s body is never found but a video of what appears to be her last hours is posted on the Net in a clip and you have to pretend you\u0027re not watching it in order to get through it. Amanda is in a motel room nude and incoherent and being shot up by men wearing ski masks. She has a seizure and two of the enormous men hold her down while her body thrashes on the newspapers taped to the floor, and then tools are removed from what looks like a beer cooler. The men take turns urinating on her and they keep slapping her face to keep her awake. And then the seizures become more intense and during one of them an eyeball is dislodged, bulging from its socket, and then a semierect c**k is pushed in and out of her slack mouth, and then it\u0027s removed once blood starts running down her face, and it\u0027s at about this point in the roughly ten minutes of footage that you finally see it: when the drugs start wearing off and Amanda realizes what\u0027s going to happen to her and she stares into the camera lucidly for one long moment, her panicked expression becoming something else. And then the thing that makes me shut it off happens: you realize this isn\u0027t just about Amanda. I can\u0027t help thinking that it\u0027s happening because of me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-43.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
