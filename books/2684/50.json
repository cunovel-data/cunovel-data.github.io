{"id":69579,"no":50,"title":"Page 50","content":"At the Hollywood Forever Cemetery I recognize very few of the people who show up for the memorial and they\u0027re mostly just figures from the past who I don\u0027t know anymore and I wasn\u0027t even going to go but I had finished two projects in the last couple days that I had been ignoring, one was a remake of The Man Who Fell to Earth and the other was a script about the reformation of a young Nazi, and the last scene I wrote was when a boy in a castle is being shown a row of fresh corpses by a madman in a uniform who keeps asking the boy if he knows any of the dead and the boy keeps answering no but he\u0027s lying, and I was staring at the bottle of Hendrick\u0027s that sat on my desk while on the TV in my office Amanda Flew\u0027s mother was being interviewed on CNN, after she had filed a complaint about the release of the video but she was told that privacy rights don\u0027t extend to the dead even though Amanda\u0027s body hasn\u0027t been found, and there was a montage of Amanda\u0027s brief career with \"Girls on Film\" playing on the sound track as the piece segues into the dangers of the drug wars across the border, and I was trying to make a decision that seemed daunting either way and for a moment I thought about checking out.\n I arrive late just as the memorial concludes, and I\u0027m standing in the back of the room scanning the small crowd as Julian\u0027s father walks by and doesn\u0027t recognize me. Rain isn\u0027t here and neither is Rip, who for whatever reason I thought would be, and Trent didn\u0027t show up but Blair\u0027s here with Alana and I duck out before she sees me, and then I\u0027m walking past the Buddhist cemetery where the dead are guarded by mirror-lined stupas and peacocks roam the graves and I\u0027m staring up at the Paramount water tower, through the bristling palm trees, and I\u0027m wearing a Brioni suit that had once fit but is now too loose and I keep thinking I see figures lurking behind the headstones but I tell myself it\u0027s just my imagination, taking my sunglasses off, squeezing my eyes shut. The cemetery pushes up to the back walls of the Paramount lot and you could find meaning in that or be neutral about it in the same way you could find something ironic about the endless rows of the dead lined up beneath the palm trees with their fronds blooming against a sparkling blue sky or choose not to, and I\u0027m looking at the sky thinking it\u0027s the wrong time of day for a memorial, but the day, the sunlight, chases the ghosts away and isn\u0027t that the point? They show movies here during the summer, I remember, studying the giant white wall of the mausoleum where the movies are projected.\n \"How are you?\"\n Blair is standing over me. I\u0027m sitting on a bench next to a tree but there\u0027s no shade and the sun is burning.\n \"I\u0027m okay,\" I say in a hopeful voice.\n She doesn\u0027t take her sunglasses off. She\u0027s wearing a black dress that accentuates her thinness.\n From where I\u0027m sitting I watch the dispersing crowd, their cars pulling out onto Santa Monica Boulevard, and farther away there\u0027s a bulldozer digging a fresh grave.\n \"I guess I\u0027m worried,\" I say. \"A little.\"\n \"Why?\" she asks, sounding concerned, like someone trying to comfort a child. \"About what?\"\n \"I\u0027ve been questioned twice,\" I say. \"I had to hire a new lawyer.\" I pause. \"They think I\u0027m involved.\"\n Blair doesn\u0027t say anything.\n \"They say there were witnesses who saw me with him the night of his disappearance and ... \" I look away from her and don\u0027t mention that the only person I could imagine this to be true of now that I\u0027m sure the three Mexicans are dead is the doorman at the Doheny Plaza but when the doorman was interviewed he couldn\u0027t remember anything and there were no records because I\u0027d told him before Julian arrived that I was expecting a delivery and to just send up whoever stopped by, and all I\u0027ve done is deny everything and tell everyone that I might have seen Julian earlier that week but the fact remains I don\u0027t have an alibi for the night I drove him to the corner of Finley and Commonwealth and I know Rip Millar and Rain both know this. \"Which means ... well, I don\u0027t know what it means,\" I murmur, and then try to smile. \"A lot of things, I guess.\" The Hollywood sign blares from the hills and a helicopter flies low over the cemetery and a small group dressed in black is wandering through the headstones. I\u0027ve only been here for fifteen minutes.\n \"Well,\" Blair starts haltingly, \"if you didn\u0027t do anything, why are you worried?\"\n \"They think I might have been part of ... a plan,\" I say casually. \"I actually heard the word \u0027conspiracy\u0027 used.\"\n \"What can they prove?\" she asks softly.\n \"They have a tape someone thinks is incriminating ... this ... this drunken rant I made at Julian one night and ... \" I stop. \"Well, I was sleeping with his girlfriend so ... \" I look up at her and then away. \"I think I know who\u0027s involved and I think they\u0027re going to get away with it ... but no one knows where I was.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-50.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: \n Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
