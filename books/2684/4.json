{"id":69533,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The reason I\u0027ve sold myself on being back in Los Angeles: the casting of The Listeners is under way. The producer who had brought me in to adapt the complicated novel it was based on was so relieved when I figured it out that he had almost instantly hired an enthusiastic director, and the three of us were acting as collaborators (even after a tense negotiation where my lawyer and manager insisted that I receive a producing credit as well). They had already cast the four adult leads but their children were trickier and more specific roles and the director and the producer wanted my input. This is the official reason why I\u0027m in L.A. But, really, coming back to the city is an excuse to escape New York and whatever had happened to me there that fall. The cell vibrates inside my pocket. I glance at it curiously. A text from Julian, a person I haven\u0027t had any contact with in over a year. When do you get back? Are you here? Wanna hang? Almost automatically the landline rings. I move into the kitchen and look at the receiver. PRIVATE NAME. PRIVATE NUMBER. After four rings, whoever is calling hangs up. When I look back outside the mist keeps drifting in over the city, enveloping everything. I go into my office without turning on the lights. I check e-mails from all of the accounts: reminder of a dinner with the Germans financing a script, another director meeting, my TV agent asking if I\u0027ve finished the Sony pilot yet, a couple of young actors wanting to know what\u0027s happening with The Listeners, a series of invites to various Christmas parties, my trainer at Equinox - having heard from another client that I\u0027m back - wondering if I\u0027d like to book any sessions. I take an Ambien to get to sleep since there\u0027s not enough vodka. When I move to the bedroom window and look down at Elevado, the Jeep is pulling away, its headlights flashing, and it turns onto Doheny, then moves up toward Sunset, and in the closet I find a few things left by a girl who hung around last summer, and suddenly I don\u0027t want to think of where she might be at this moment. I get another text from Laurie: Do you still want me? It\u0027s almost four in the morning in the apartment below Union Square. So many people died last year: the accidental overdose, the car wreck in East Hampton, the surprise illness. People just disappeared. I fall asleep to the music coming from the Abbey, a song from the past, \"Hungry Like the Wolf,\" rising faintly above the leaping chatter of the club, transporting me for one long moment into someone both young and old. Sadness: it\u0027s everywhere. The premiere is at the Chinese tonight and it\u0027s a movie that has something to do with confronting evil, a situation set up so obviously that the movie becomes safely vague in a way that will entice the studio to buy awards for it, in fact there\u0027s a campaign already under way, and I\u0027m with the director and the producer of The Listeners and we drift with the rest of the crowd across Hollywood Boulevard to the Roosevelt for the after-party where paparazzi cling to the hotel\u0027s entrance and I immediately grab a drink at the bar while the producer disappears into the bathroom and the director stands next to me talking on the phone to his wife, who\u0027s in Australia. When I scan the darkened room, smiling back at unfamiliar people, the fear returns and soon it\u0027s everywhere and it keeps streaming forward: it\u0027s in the looming success of the film we just watched, it\u0027s in the young actors\u0027 seductive questions about possible roles in The Listeners, and it\u0027s in the texts they send walking away, their faces glowing from the cell light as they cross the cavernous lobby, and it\u0027s in the spray-on tans and the teeth stained white. I\u0027ve been in New York the last four months is the mantra, my mask an expressionless smile. Finally the producer appears from behind a Christmas tree and says, \"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" then mentions something about a couple of parties up in the hills, and Laurie keeps texting from New York (Hey. You.) and I cannot get it out of my head that someone in this room is following me. Sudden rapid camera flashes are a distraction, but the pale fear returns when I realize whoever was in that blue Jeep last night is probably in the crowd. We head west on Sunset in the producer\u0027s Porsche and then turn up Doheny to the first of two parties Mark wants to hit, the director following us in a black Jaguar, and we start speeding past the bird streets until we spot a valet. Small decorated firs surround the bar I\u0027m standing at pretending to listen while a grinning actor tells me what he\u0027s got lined up and I\u0027m drunkenly staring at the gorgeous girl he\u0027s with, U2 Christmas songs drowning everything out, and guys in Band of Outsiders suits sit on a low-slung ivory sofa snorting lines off a long glass cocktail table, and when someone offers me a bump I\u0027m tempted but decline knowing where that will lead. The producer, buzzed, needs to hit another party in Bel Air, and I\u0027m drunk enough to let him maneuver me out of this one even though there\u0027s a vague shot of getting laid here. The producer wants to meet someone at the party in Bel Air, it\u0027s business in Bel Air, his presence in Bel Air is supposed to prove something about his status, and my eyes wander over to the boys barely old enough to drive swimming in the heated pool, girls in string bikinis and high heels lounging by the Jacuzzi, anime sculptures everywhere, a mosaic of youth, a place you don\u0027t really belong anymore.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-4.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
