{"id":69560,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"Two silent flashes behind me briefly illuminate the side of the building and when I turn around that\u0027s when I notice a black Mercedes double-parked on Orange Grove, the flashes coming from the open window on the passenger side, and then the window rolls up. A vague realization: someone was taking pictures of me standing in front of Rain and Amanda\u0027s apartment. Shaking, I ignore the car and slowly move away from the apartment and walk down the street to the idling BMW. I get in. I pull away from the curb. I roll up Orange Grove past the Mercedes, which then starts following me as I pull up to Fountain and make a left. So does the black car. I gun the BMW forward but in the rearview mirror the Mercedes keeps up, veering in and out of lanes. I floor the accelerator in order to make the light and swerve onto La Cienega. The Mercedes makes the light too, its tires screeching against the wet asphalt. I stop at the light on Holloway, the high beams of the black car pressing against the BMW, and then take a right on Santa Monica, trying to act casual, as if I\u0027m suddenly unaware of the Mercedes. But it follows me back to the Doheny Plaza and when I valet the BMW I pretend not to see the Mercedes as it cruises around the corner onto Norma Place, slowing as I turn and walk into the lobby, and I only hear it speed away.\n In the condo, shaking and wet, holding a glass of vodka with both hands in the darkness of the balcony, storms sweeping over the city, I\u0027m watching the black Mercedes cruise back and forth on Elevado and then I get a text from a blocked number - Hey gringo, you can\u0027t hide - accompanied by a winking smiley face, and that night I dream about the boy, the same dream that Rain had but now the boy, beautiful and shirtless, has moved from the kitchen into the living room and I keep asking him, \"Who are you?\" and for some reason he\u0027s gesturing at me, the muscles in his arms and chest straining, and as he moves closer I can see the tattoo of a dragon on his forearm and there\u0027s blood in the boy\u0027s hair and when I stumble into the guest bathroom in the middle of the night, scattering a few of Rain\u0027s things that line the sink, I turn on the lights, and in the mirror above the counter, written in something red, are two words: DISAPPEAR HERE.\n Another awards party, this one at Spago, and though there\u0027s always the risk of seeing someone you don\u0027t want to I\u0027m beyond caring and since Rain isn\u0027t coming over until tomorrow I find myself standing in the main dining room accidentally stuck in a conversation with Muriel and Kim who don\u0027t ask me why I wasn\u0027t at the party for Alana at Blair\u0027s and after a photographer takes a picture of the three of us they move away, and it\u0027s okay that Trent and Blair are in the courtyard because neither one of them will talk to me since there are too many people at the party tonight. Daniel Carter keeps smiling impatiently at me and though I don\u0027t want Daniel to come over, Meghan Reynolds doesn\u0027t seem to be around and there\u0027s nothing to do but stand still and Daniel and I are both wearing James Perse T-shirts and expensive one-button blazers and he asks about The Listeners and I tell him that I liked his movie, that I was at the premiere in December, and then we\u0027re talking about how big the new Friday the 13th opened and discussing how a particular special effect was accomplished while Daniel keeps craning his neck, raising his eyebrows at someone across the room and smiling.\n \"Looks like you got some sun there,\" Daniel says, gesturing at my reddened face.\n \"Yeah,\" I say. \"You know me: I get burned easily.\"\n \"You\u0027ve been in New York, right?\" Daniel asks. \"How long are you here? I heard you were back at Doheny.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027m back,\" I say. \"New York seems ... over.\"\n \"And this place is ... ?\" Daniel asks, waiting for me to complete the sentence.\n \"Happening.\" I shrug. \"I\u0027m a different person now.\" I put on a fake smile.\n \"Please don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re thinking of moving back,\" he says. \"Fuck, if I could get out of here ... \"\n And then Meghan comes up to us and leans slightly into Daniel and says \"Hi, Clay\" and if I weren\u0027t drunk I wouldn\u0027t have been able to stand being here and I had forgotten how Meghan looks close-up and it shocks me like it always did and I have to pretend nothing\u0027s wrong. Meghan gazes at me indifferently and my fake smile is a rebuke that lets her know I\u0027m glad she\u0027s come to terms with all the things she\u0027d done to me, and near the end of everything I had begged her to run away from this place and we were sitting at a sushi bar on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City and it was summer and I remember seeing a child actor who had been famous once and was now considered old at thirty-three, sitting at the far end of the sushi bar while Meghan kept hinting that it was over between us. Now, in Spago, I have no idea what Meghan has told Daniel about me even though she has a role in his next movie. She mentions she\u0027d seen me at a screening I wasn\u0027t at, and I suddenly remember pacing outside the ER at Cedars-Sinai apologizing to her on the Fourth of July. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-31.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: \n Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
