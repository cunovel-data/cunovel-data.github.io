Cool.\" She tries to find a track on a CD Meghan Reynolds had burned for me last summer. \"He might have mentioned something about that.\"\n \"How do you know him?\" I ask.\n \"I did some work for him,\" she says. \"A long time ago.\"\n \"What kind of work?\"\n \"Just like an assistant. Freelance,\" she says. \"It was a long time ago.\"\n \"I actually know that you know him,\" I say.\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" she asks, concentrating on locating the song. \"You say that so weird.\"\n \"Where is he right now?\" I ask. \"I\u0027m just wondering.\"\n \"How would I know that?\" she asks, pretending to be annoyed.\n \"Well, aren\u0027t you his girlfriend?\"\n Everything is suddenly in slow motion. It\u0027s as if suddenly she forgot her lines. Her only response is to laugh. \"You\u0027re crazy.\"\n \"Let\u0027s call him up.\"\n \"Okay. Sure. Whatever, Crazy.\"\n \"You don\u0027t believe me, do you?\" I say. \"You think this is a joke?\"\n \"I think you\u0027re crazy,\" she says. \"That\u0027s what I think this is.\"\n \"I know about you and him, Rain.\"\n \"And what do you think you know?\" Her voice remains playful.\n \"I know you were in San Diego with Julian last week.\"\n \"I was with my mother, Clay.\"\n \"But you were also with Julian.\" Saying this relaxes me. \"Didn\u0027t you think I was going to find out about this?\"\n At the light on Doheny she stares straight out the windshield.\n \"Didn\u0027t you know I was going to find out that you\u0027re still f**king him?\"\n She suddenly cracks. She whirls toward me in the passenger seat. A series of questions pour out in a pleading rush. \"So what? What does it matter? What are you doing? What do you think this is about? Will you just leave it alone? What does it matter what I do when I\u0027m not with you?\"\n \"It matters,\" I say. \"In this situation, for you to get what you want, it matters very much.\"\n \"Why does it matter?\" she shouts. \"You\u0027re crazy.\"\n I calmly make the left and start heading down Doheny.\n \"You couldn\u0027t even play this part for a f**king month?\" I ask quietly. \"What, you needed his c**k so badly that you had to jeopardize everything for yourself? If being with me was so important to you, Rain, why did you f**k it up? You could\u0027ve played me but - \"\n \"I don\u0027t play people, Clay.\"\n \"What about Rip Millar?\"\n Chapter 8\n \"What about Rip Millar?\" she says. \"Jesus, you need to get over yourself.\"\n The blurry headlights from oncoming cars cause me to pull the BMW to the side of the road across from the Doheny Plaza.\n \"Get out. Just get out of the f**king car.\"\n \"Clay ... \" She reaches for me. \"Please, stop.\"\n \"You\u0027re panicking.\" I smile, pulling away from her. \"Look at this: you\u0027re really panicking.\"\n \"Listen, I\u0027ll do whatever you want,\" she says. \"What do you want? Just tell me what you want and I\u0027ll do it.\"\n \"End things with Julian now,\" I say. \"At least until you get the part.\"\n She pulls back. \"How do I even know that you\u0027ll help me get the part?\"\n \"I will,\" I say. \"But just tell Julian to go away. I\u0027m not even going to try until he\u0027s out of the picture.\"\n \"If you get me the part I\u0027ll do anything,\" she says quietly. \"I\u0027ll do anything you want. If you can get me that part I\u0027ll do anything you want.\"\n She grabs my face. She pulls me to her. She kisses me hard on the mouth.\n In the darkness of the bedroom Rain asks me, \"Why did you do this now?\"\n \"Do what?\" I\u0027m propped on a pillow sipping vodka and melted ice.\n \"Bring this all up,\" she says. \"Try and wreck everything.\"\n \"I just wanted to prove that you were lying to me.\"\n \"Who told you?\"\n \"Rip Millar.\"\n She immediately tightens up and her voice becomes chilled. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-27.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: \n Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
