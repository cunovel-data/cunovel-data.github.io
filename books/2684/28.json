Please, Clay? Seriously. Just don\u0027t. I\u0027ll handle Rip.\"\\n\\n \"He said he\u0027ll hurt Julian,\" I say. \"He said he won\u0027t be able to help himself.\"\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t you just let this be what it is?\"\\n\\n \"Because what it is ... is not what I want.\"\\n\\n \"If this is going to work the way you want it to\" - she sighs - \"I need some money.\"\\n\\n \"You have a job,\" I say. \"What about Reveal?\"\\n\\n \"I was let go,\" she says finally.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Rip made a call,\" she says. \"He hates me.\"\\n\\n Things start expanding. I feel more relaxed. Everything becomes possible because the plan starts falling into place.\\n\\n \"Did you hear me?\" she asks. \"How do you live like this?\"\\n\\n \"I pretend I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Is she with you now? Where is she, Julian? I mean, I know what\u0027s going on. I know what the facts are. Fuck, Julian, what are you f**king doing? Are you f**king with me again? You\u0027re pimping your girlfriend out? What kind of f**ked-up dude are you? Tell me where she is ... Where is she? ... Oh, f**k yourself. I don\u0027t ever want to see your f**king face ever again and if I see you I swear to God I will f**king kill you, Julian. I mean it. I\u0027ll f**king kill you and I won\u0027t give a shit. I\u0027ll like it because everything will be better once you\u0027re dead.\" A drunken message I leave on Julian\u0027s cell phone when I wake up and Rain\u0027s gone in the middle of a warm January night, after the Golden Globes party at the Sunset Tower.\\n\\n Two catering trucks are parked in front of the casting complex in Culver City and in the courtyard a crew is setting up tables and a DJ stand and the patio is filled with waiting young actors dressed in vintage eighties clothes and they all have blond bangs and then I\u0027m passing the pool and walking up the stairs into an office where Jon and Mark are taking a break from the auditions with Jason.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s back from the dead,\" Jon says. \"What\u0027s up? Where have you been?\"\\n\\n \"Just some personal stuff I had to deal with,\" I say. \"I had to finish a script.\" I put my hands in my pockets and lean against a wall, trying to remain loose and casual. \"And I\u0027ve been thinking that we saw someone who\u0027s perfect for Martina.\"\\n\\n \"We still haven\u0027t found anyone yet,\" Jon says.\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s not true,\" Jason says. \"We\u0027ve narrowed it down but who are you thinking of?\"\\n\\n Mark is just staring at me, slightly amused, maybe bewildered. \"Yeah, who is it?\" He asks this as if he already knows.\\n\\n \"We saw her a couple of weeks ago and, well, I\u0027ve been thinking about her a lot,\" I say. \"I think we should see her again.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"Rain Turner. Do you remember her?\" I ask, then turn to Mark. \"She was with me at the party last night.\"\\n\\n Jason swings over to his monitor and taps some keys and Rain\u0027s headshot appears on the screen. Jon moves forward, confused. Mark glances at the screen and then, hopelessly, at me.\\n\\n \"Why her?\" Jon asks. \"She\u0027s older than Martina.\"\\n\\n \"She just seems like who I had in mind when I was writing the script,\" I say. \"I mean, Martina could be a few years older than the others.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s very pretty,\" Jon murmurs. \"But I don\u0027t really remember who she was.\"\\n\\n \"I think she\u0027s too old,\" Jason says.\\n\\n \"Why are you so sure about her, Clay?\" Mark asks.\\n\\n \"I just can\u0027t stop thinking about her in that role and, well, I\u0027d really like to have her read again.\"\\n\\n \"Has she become a friend of yours?\" Mark asks.\\n\\n I try to ignore the way he asks this. \"No, I mean no ... she\u0027s, I mean, I know her.\"\\n\\n \"Who is this girl?\" Jon asks. \"Who reps her?\"\\n\\n \"Burroughs Media,\" the casting director says reading from the screen. \"ICM is listed but I don\u0027t think they\u0027re repping her anymore. Her last credits are from a year ago.\" He keeps scanning and then stops. \"Actually, she got in as a favor.\"\\n\\n \"From who?\" I\u0027m the one who asks this.\\n\\n The casting director scrolls down Rain\u0027s page. There\u0027s a sudden hesitancy in the room before Jason says anything.\\n\\n \"Kelly Montrose,\" he says. \"Kelly made the call.\"\\n\\n Everything goes silent. Things become reversed in the long moment before anyone says anything. Through the open window the palm tree waves in the dry wind and the kids are murmuring below by the pool and no one in the room knows what to say and the hangover I had forgotten about returns the moment Kelly Montrose\u0027s name is mentioned and I want to sing softly to myself to help submerge the pain - the chest that aches, the blood pulsing in my head - and I have no choice except to pretend I\u0027m only a phantom, neutral and uncaring. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-28.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
