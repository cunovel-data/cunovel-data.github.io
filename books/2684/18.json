A couple of days.\"\\n\\n \"Are you okay?\" I ask. \"You seemed kind of freaked out yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m better,\" she says. \"I\u0027m okay.\"\\n\\n To placate me she kisses me on the mouth. \"I had a nice time,\" she says, stroking my face, and the sound of the air-conditioning competes with the big smile and then the smile and the cool air become in the drift of things suddenly amplified, almost frantic, and I pull her toward me onto the bed and I press my face against her thighs and inhale and then I try to flip her over but she gently pushes me away. I lower the sheet, revealing my hard-on, and she aims for levity and rolls her eyes. I can suddenly see my reflection in a mirror in the corner of the bedroom: an old-looking teenager. She gets up and scans the room to see if she\u0027s forgotten anything. I reach for the camera on the nightstand and start taking pictures of her. She\u0027s staring into a Versace bag that had once been filled with packets of cocaine, the other thing that had fueled so much of the sex, the thing that helped make the fantasy seem much more discrete and innocent than it really was, the thing that made it seem as if the desire was reciprocated. \"Could you call the valet and have him bring my car up?\" she asks, frowning as she checks a text.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want you to go.\"\\n\\n \"I said I\u0027ll be back,\" she murmurs absently.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t make me beg,\" I say. \"I\u0027m warning you.\"\\n\\n \"Even if you did it wouldn\u0027t work.\" She doesn\u0027t look up when she says this.\\n\\n \"Can I come with you?\"\\n\\n \"Stop it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m imagining things.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m imagining there are many versions of this event.\"\\n\\n \"Event? I\u0027m going to f**king San Diego to see my f**king mother.\"\\n\\n \"Neither one of us wants to admit that something\u0027s wrong,\" I murmur, snapping another pic.\\n\\n \"You just did.\" She briefly poses. Another flash.\\n\\n \"Rain, I\u0027m serious - \"\\n\\n \"Stop turning this into a drama, Crazy.\" Again: the sly smile.\\n\\n \"Drama?\" I ask innocently. \"Who? Me?\"\\n\\n The last thing she says before she leaves: \"Will you make sure I get that callback?\"\\n\\n The digital billboards glowing in the gray haze all seem to say no and the poinsettias lining the median at Sunset Plaza are dying and fog keeps enveloping the towers in Century City and the world becomes a science-fiction movie - because none of it really has anything to do with me. It\u0027s a world where getting stoned is the only option. Everything becomes more vague and abstract since every desire and every whim that had been catered to constantly in that last week of December is now gone and I don\u0027t want to replace it with anyone else because there\u0027s no substitute - the teen p**n sites seem different, repainted somehow, nothing kicks in, it doesn\u0027t work anymore - and so I re-create almost hourly in my mind the sex that happened in the bedroom over those eight days she was here and when I try to outline a script that I\u0027ve been lazy about it comes out half sincere and half ironic because Rain\u0027s failure to return calls or text back becomes a distraction and then, only three days after she leaves, it officially becomes an obstacle. The bruises on my chest and arms, the imprints from Rain\u0027s fingers and the scratches on my shoulders and thighs, begin to fade and I stop returning various e-mails from people back in town because I have no desire to gossip about Kelly Montrose or dis the awards buzz or hear about people\u0027s plans for Sundance and I have no reason to go back to the casting sessions in Culver City (because what I want has already happened) and without Rain here it all dissipates entirely and the calm becomes impossible, something I can\u0027t control. And so I find myself in Dr. Woolf\u0027s office on Sawtelle and the pattern that keeps repeating itself is again pointed out and its reasons are located and we practice techniques to lessen the pain. And just when I think I\u0027m going to be able to deal with everything a blue Jeep with tinted windows passes me on Santa Monica while I\u0027m crossing the intersection at Wilshire. An hour later I get a text from a blocked number, the first in almost eleven days: Where did she go?\\n\\n Rumors of a video of Kelly Montrose\u0027s \"execution\" - that it had been circulating on the Web and seen by \"reliable sources\" - spreads within the community early one morning in the first week of January. There was supposedly a link somewhere that led to another link but the first link had been pulled and there\u0027s nothing to find except people on various blogs debating the video\u0027s \"authenticity.\" Supposedly there was a headless body in a black windbreaker hung from a bridge, a bleak desert lined with scrub brush beneath it, police tape whipping in the dry wind, and someone else wrote that the murder was set in a \"laboratory\" outside of Juarez and someone else countered with certainty that the murder was committed in a soccer field by men wearing hoods and someone else wrote No, Kelly Montrose was killed in an abandoned cemetery. But there\u0027s nothing to substantiate any of it. Someone posted a picture of a severed head grinning broadly from the passenger seat of a bullet-ridden SUV but it isn\u0027t Kelly. In fact there are no shots of him being pulled along a highway bound with rope, no close-ups of skin being peeled off a face, no shots of a pair of hands being amputated while mariachi music is scored over the images, and after the excitement peaks and the justification for the gossip surrenders to reality the rumors about the Kelly Montrose clips fade into a twilight stage. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-18.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
