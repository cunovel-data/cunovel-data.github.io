{"id":69534,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"At the house in the upper reaches of Bel Air, the producer loses me and I move from room to room and become momentarily disoriented when I see Trent Burroughs and everything gets complicated while I try and sync myself with the party, and then I soberly realize that this is the house where Trent and Blair live. There\u0027s no recourse except to have another drink. That I\u0027m not driving is the consolation. Trent is standing with a manager and two agents - all of them g*y, one engaged to a woman, the other two still in the closet. I know Trent\u0027s sleeping with the junior agent, blond with fake white teeth, so blandly good-looking he\u0027s not even a variation on a type. I realize I have nothing to say to Trent Burroughs as I tell him, \"I\u0027ve been in New York the last four months.\" New Age Christmas music fails to warm up the chilly vibe. I\u0027m suddenly unsure about everything.\\n\\n Trent looks at me, nodding, slightly bewildered by my presence. He knows he needs to say something. \"So, that\u0027s great about The Listeners. It\u0027s really happening.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what they tell me.\"\\n\\n After the nonconversation starts itself we enter into a hazy area about a supposed friend of ours, someone named Kelly.\\n\\n \"Kelly disappeared,\" Trent says, straining. \"Have you heard anything?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah?\" I ask, and then, \"Wait, what do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Kelly Montrose. He disappeared. No one can find him.\"\\n\\n Pause. \"What happened?\"\\n\\n \"He went out to Palm Springs,\" Trent says. \"They think maybe he met someone online.\"\\n\\n Trent seems to want a reaction. I stare back.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s strange,\" I murmur disinterestedly. \"Or ... is he prone to things like that?\"\\n\\n Trent looks at me as if something has been confirmed, and then reveals his disgust.\\n\\n \"Prone? No, Clay, he\u0027s not prone to things like that.\"\\n\\n \"Trent - \"\\n\\n Walking away from me, Trent says, \"He\u0027s probably dead, Clay.\"\\n\\n On the veranda overlooking the massive lit pool bordered by palms wrapped in white Christmas lights, I\u0027m smoking a cigarette, contemplating another text from Julian. I look up from the phone when a shadow steps slowly out of the darkness and it\u0027s such a dramatic moment - her beauty and my subsequent reaction to it - that I have to laugh, and she just stares at me, smiling, maybe buzzed, maybe wasted. This is the girl who would usually make me afraid, but tonight she doesn\u0027t. The look is blond and wholesome, midwestern, distinctly American, not what I\u0027m usually into. She\u0027s obviously an actress because girls who look like this aren\u0027t out here for any other reason, and she just gazes at me like this is all a dare. So I make it one.\\n\\n \"Do you want to be in a movie?\" I ask her, swaying.\\n\\n The girl keeps smiling. \"Why? Do you have a movie you want to put me in?\"\\n\\n Then the smile freezes and quickly fades as she glances behind me.\\n\\n I turn around and squint at the woman heading toward us, backlit by the room she\u0027s leaving.\\n\\n When I turn back around the girl\u0027s walking away, her silhouette enhanced by the glow of the pool, and from somewhere in the darkness there\u0027s the sound of a fountain splashing, and then the girl is replaced.\\n\\n \"Who was that?\" Blair asks.\\n\\n \"Merry Christmas.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you here?\"\\n\\n \"I was invited.\"\\n\\n \"No. You weren\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"My friends brought me.\"\\n\\n \"Friends? Congratulations.\"\\n\\n \"Merry Christmas\" again is all I can offer.\\n\\n \"Who was that girl you were talking to?\"\\n\\n I turn around and glance back into the darkness. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n Blair sighs. \"I thought you were in New York.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m back and forth.\"\\n\\n She just stares at me.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" And then: \"You and Trent still happy?\"\\n\\n \"Why are you here tonight? Who are you with?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know this was your place,\" I say, looking away. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you know these things?\"\\n\\n \"Because you haven\u0027t talked to me in two years.\"\\n\\n Another text from Julian tells me to meet him at the Polo Lounge. Not wanting to go back to the condo, I have the producer drop me off at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Outside, on the patio, next to a heat lamp, Julian sits in a booth, his face glowing while he texts someone. He looks up, smiles. As soon as I slide into the booth a waiter appears and I order a Belvedere on the rocks. When I offer Julian a questioning look he taps a bottle of Fiji water I hadn\u0027t noticed before and says, \"I\u0027m not drinking.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-5.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
