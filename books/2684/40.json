On the Santa Monica pier Trent\u0027s wearing a suit and sitting on a bench at the entrance and when he sees me approaching he looks up from his phone and takes off his sunglasses and just stares at me warily. Trent mentions he finished lunch earlier than he\u0027d planned with a skittish actor he manages, successfully persuading him to take a role in a movie for myriad reasons that would be beneficial to everybody. \"I\u0027m actually surprised you came,\" Trent says. \"Why couldn\u0027t I meet you at the restaurant?\" I ask. \"Because I don\u0027t really want to be seen with you,\" he says. \"It would validate something that I wouldn\u0027t want validated, I guess.\" I start walking with him along the boardwalk. He puts his sunglasses back on. \"I suppose I\u0027m more sensitive about things than I thought,\" he says. \"I got your client an audition today,\" I say, in a good mood because of how Rain responded to me last night. \"Yeah,\" Trent says. \"You did.\" I pause. \"Isn\u0027t that what you wanted to see me about?\" Trent thinks about it before saying, \"In a way.\" The empty Ferris wheel looms over us as we pass by barely visible in the haze, just a dim circle, and except for a few Mexican fishermen no one\u0027s around. Holiday decorations are still up and a dead Christmas tree wrapped in a garland leans against the peeling wall of the arcade and the faint smell of churros floats toward us from a brightly colored cart and it\u0027s hard to concentrate on Trent because the only sounds are the distant surf and the squalling of low-flying gulls, the psychic calling out to us, the calliope playing a Doors song. \"This isn\u0027t about Blair?\" I suddenly ask. Trent looks over at me as if he\u0027s shocked I would ask that. \"No. Not at all. This has nothing to do with Blair.\" I keep moving with him down the boardwalk toward the end of the pier, waiting for him to say something. \"I want to make this quick,\" Trent finally says, checking his watch. \"I\u0027ve got to be back in Beverly Hills by three.\" I shrug and put my hands in the pockets of the hoodie I\u0027m wearing, one of them forming a fist around my phone. \"I guess you\u0027re going to stop this with Rain Turner, right?\" Trent asks. \"I mean, the audition\u0027s this afternoon, right? And then it\u0027ll be over?\" \"Stop ... what, Trent?\" I ask innocently. \"Whatever it is you do with these girls.\" He quickly makes a face, then tries to relax. \"This, I don\u0027t know, this little game you play.\" \"What are you talking about, Trent?\" I ask, sounding as casual and amused as possible. \"Promise them things, sleep with them, buy them things and then you can only get them so far and when you can\u0027t get them the things that you really promised ... \" Trent stops walking and takes off his sunglasses and looks at me, mystified. \"Do I really need to say this?\" \"It\u0027s just a very interesting theory.\" Trent stares at me before he continues walking, and then he stops again. \"It\u0027s interesting that you - what? Abandon them? Try to screw things up for them once they figure it all out?\" Something in me snaps. \"I think Meghan Reynolds is doing okay,\" I say. \"I think she benefited from using me.\" \"You don\u0027t really need to work, do you?\" Trent asks. He sounds genuinely interested. \"You\u0027ve got family money, right?\" I don\u0027t say anything. \"I mean, you can\u0027t afford to live like you do just off screenwriting,\" Trent says. \"I mean, right?\" I shrug. \"I do okay.\" I shrug again. \"I know Rain Turner doesn\u0027t have a shot at that role.\" Trent keeps walking and then he puts his sunglasses back on as if it\u0027s the only thing that will calm him down. \"I talked to Mark. I talked to Jon. You can keep f**king with her as long as you want, I guess - \" \"Trent, you know what? I just realized this is none of your business.\" \"Well, it has, unfortunately, become my business.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-40.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
