They both knew that.\" \"But then your friend Kelly got in the way,\" I say. \"That might have been a problem,\" Trent says, nodding his head. \"The problem being what?\" \"Whatever happened between Rip Millar and Kelly Montrose ... \" Trent stops, figuring out how to phrase it differently. \"Kelly knew a lot of people. It\u0027s not like Rip Millar was the only person who had issues with him.\" My iPhone starts vibrating in the pocket of the hoodie, its sound muffled. \"Actually\" - Trent stares at me - \"you and Rip have much more in common than you might think.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t think so,\" I say. \"I didn\u0027t have anything to do with Kelly\u0027s death.\" \"Clay - \" \"And I don\u0027t know how but I think Rip did.\" I stop walking. \"And you knew something at the Christmas party, didn\u0027t you? You knew Rip had done something to Kelly. You knew Rain had left him for Kelly and you knew Rip liked her - \" Trent cuts me off. \"Yeah? Well, I guess we all have our little theories.\" \"Theory?\" I ask. \"It\u0027s a theory that you knew he was probably dead that night?\" The haze obliterates everything: you can\u0027t see the Pacific or the pier behind us, the Mexican restaurant is barely visible at the end of the pier and nothing else at all. The pier falls away into the sea and beyond that is just a sheet of haze blocking out the entire sky so there\u0027s no horizon and Trent leans against the railing studying me, still intent on pitching the narrative he wants me to respond to, but I can barely pay attention. \"Why do you keep looking at that restaurant?\" Trent suddenly asks. \"You thirsty for a margarita or something?\" Trent doesn\u0027t realize I\u0027m not looking at the restaurant. The young blond guy in the windbreaker is somewhere around us but I can\u0027t see him. \"Why is Kelly Montrose dead?\" I say, almost murmuring to myself instead of directing this at Trent. \"What happened to Amanda Flew?\" Trent isn\u0027t cool enough to hide the desperation that quickly flashes across his face. \"It\u0027s not just about Kelly and it\u0027s not just about Amanda.\" Trent breathes in and looks around. \"You don\u0027t understand ... This ... thing ... it has ... a scope, Clay ... \" Trent stops. \"It has a scope ... There are other people involved and it\u0027s - \" \"Can\u0027t you just answer my question?\" \"But you\u0027re asking for an answer where there isn\u0027t just one.\" The iPhone in my pocket starts vibrating again. \"You smell like alcohol,\" he mutters, turning away. \"I heard rumors but Christ.\" I clasp my fist around the iPhone as if that will make it stop. \"Look, she\u0027s not going to get that part,\" Trent says. \"Okay? You understand?\" \"Do you know that for sure?\" \"Anything could happen, I suppose,\" Trent says. \"But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s one of them.\" \"Well, then she won\u0027t get the part and then it\u0027ll be over,\" I say. \"And then she\u0027ll go off with someone else. She\u0027ll move on.\" \"No she won\u0027t. Because you\u0027ll offer her another one,\" Trent says quickly. \"You\u0027ll just prolong it. Like you usually do. And like the others, it\u0027ll take her a while to understand.\" Trent stops. \"And then, as usual, it\u0027ll take even longer for you to understand and - \" \"Why are you here, Trent?\" I ask, unable to contain the stress that\u0027s whispering around us. \"What? You\u0027re here on Julian\u0027s behalf? You want Rain to be with Julian? You want them to live happily ever after?\" \"No, no, you\u0027re not paying attention. You don\u0027t get it,\" Trent says, shaking his head. \"Just stop all contact with her. Starting this afternoon. Don\u0027t see her anymore. Don\u0027t return her calls. She\u0027ll come back to you but don\u0027t let her - \" \"What if I say go f**k yourself?\" \"That would be very stupid.\" \"Unless you tell me why I should stay away, I don\u0027t think what you want is going to happen.\" Trent stares at me, and then he tells me something that I know he doesn\u0027t want to. \"If she can make Rip Millar happy for a couple more months then everything will calm down.\" Trent stops and looks into my face. \"Do you get it, now? Do I need to explain this any further? Julian\u0027s really not the obstacle right now. You are. Julian\u0027s already tried to talk her out of being with you. But, in this case, you\u0027re the only one she\u0027s going to listen to.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-42.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
