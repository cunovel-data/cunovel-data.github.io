{"id":69546,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"So when will you help me?\" she asks while we\u0027re sitting in the cafe down the street from the Doheny Plaza, idling over a late breakfast, both of us floating away from hangovers with the dope we smoked and Xanax. \"I think you should make the calls as soon as possible,\" she says, looking at herself in a mirror. \"Right when everybody comes back, okay?\" I\u0027m smiling at her serenely and nodding. I ignore the creases of suspicion on her face even after I remove my sunglasses, and then I assure her with a \"Yes\" followed by a warm kiss.\n This assumed peace lasts only about a week. There\u0027s always the possibility of something frightening happening, and then it usually does. Two days before Kelly Montrose\u0027s body is found, Rain wakes up and mentions she had a dream that night. I\u0027m already up, taking pictures of her while she sleeps, and now that she\u0027s awake she flinches when I take another one and she says that in her dream she saw a young man in my kitchen, a boy, really, but old enough to be desirable, and he was staring at her and there was dried blood crusted above his upper lip and there was a blurred tattoo of a dragon etched on his forearm and the boy told her he had wanted to live here in 1508, but the boy told her not to worry, that he was lucky, and then his face turned black and he bared his teeth and then he was dust, and I tell Rain about the party boy who had owned this apartment and I tell her that the building is haunted, that at night vampires hide in the palm trees surrounding the building waiting for the lights to go out, and then roam the hallways, and finally the camera gets her attention and she\u0027s animated and I keep flashing the camera, my head propped on a pillow while she glances at the flat-screen TV - a shot of people running from a jungle, an episode of Lost, and I reach for a Corona on the nightstand. \"The vampires don\u0027t roam the hallways,\" she finally murmurs, recovered. \"The vampires own the units.\" And then we run lines for the part of Martina in The Listeners.\n Kelly Montrose was rumored to be with the Hispanic actress who had been found in the mass grave right before Christmas. The last sighting of him was on a tennis court in Palm Springs one afternoon in mid-December. Kelly\u0027s naked body was smeared across a highway in Juarez and then propped against a tree. Two other men were found nearby entombed in blocks of cement. Kelly\u0027s face was peeled off, and his hands were missing. There was a note pinned to his body revealing nothing: cabron? cabron? cabron? Things I didn\u0027t know about Kelly: the crystal meth thing, the stepmother who died during plastic surgery, the supposed connections with the drug cartel. This discovery feels only tangential since I never really knew Kelly Montrose - he produced movies, I\u0027d met him several times about various projects - and he was never close enough to anyone I knew to define any of my relationships. Rain spends the day before Kelly Montrose is found at a distance: pacing the balcony, texting, taking calls, returning calls, increasingly agitated, leaning against the railing, gazing past the plunge of the balcony at a couple of guys jogging shirtless on the street below. When I ask her what\u0027s wrong she keeps blaming her family. I keep dragging her back to the bedroom and she\u0027s always resisting, promising \"In a minute, in a minute ... \" After downing two shots of tequila she lazes on the balcony in just a thong, ignoring the helicopter swooping above her, and that night in the dark bedroom in the Doheny Plaza, drunk on margaritas, candles glowing around her while I complain about another movie playing on the giant flat screen, Rain can\u0027t help it and for the first time something causes her to tune out and when I finally notice, my voice starts to waver and as I fade into silence she simply asks, without looking over at me, in a neutral voice, her eyes gazing at the TV, \"What\u0027s the worst thing you\u0027ve ever done?\"\n I have to go to San Diego,\" she says.\n I\u0027m just waking up, squinting at the light pouring into the bedroom. The shades have been pulled up and she\u0027s walking around in the brightness of the room collecting things.\n \"What time is it?\" I ask.\n \"Almost noon.\"\n \"What are you doing?\"\n \"I have to go to San Diego,\" she says. \"Something\u0027s come up.\"\n I reach out for her, trying to pull her back onto the bed.\n \"Clay, stop. I have to go.\"\n \"Why? Who are you seeing down there?\"\n \"My mother,\" she mutters. \"My crazy f**king mother.\"\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I ask. \"What happened?\"\n \"Nothing. The usual. Whatever. I\u0027ll call you when I get there.\"\n \"When am I going to see you again?\"\n \"When I get back.\"\n \"When are you getting back?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-17.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: \n Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
