I knock back the rest of my drink. \"Anyway, she\u0027s with Rip Millar now,\" Daniel says. \"Maybe he\u0027ll help her out.\" \"I don\u0027t get it,\" I say. \"How could Rip help her?\" \"You didn\u0027t know?\" Daniel asks. \"Know what?\" \"Rip left his wife,\" Daniel says. \"Rip wants to make movies now.\" Julian\u0027s body is found almost a week after he disappeared, or was kidnapped, depending on which script you want to follow. Earlier that week three young Mexican men connected to a drug cartel were found shot to death in the desert, not far from where Amanda Flew was last seen. They were decapitated and their hands were missing and they had at one point during the last week been in possession of a black Audi that was found outside of Palm Desert, torched. Someone filmed me with a digital camera in the American Airlines first-class lounge at JFK when I was sitting at a table with Amanda Flew last December. A disk is mailed to me in a manila envelope with no return address. The scene comes back to me: Amanda reading my palm in the Admiral\u0027s Club, the empty glasses on the table, both of us laughing suggestively, leaning into each other, and though the lighting and sound quality are bad and you can\u0027t hear what we\u0027re saying it\u0027s obvious I\u0027m flirting hard. Sitting in my office watching this play on the screen of my monitor I realize this is where everything started. Rain picked Amanda up from LAX in the blue Jeep on that night in December and then they followed me back to Doheny because Amanda had told Rain she met the guy Julian had been telling her about. I heard you met a friend of mine, Rip told me outside the W Hotel last December at the premiere of Daniel Carter\u0027s movie. Yeah, I heard you really hit it off ... When the footage ends a series of doctored pictures fade in and out of one another: Amanda and me holding hands in line at Pink\u0027s, wheeling a cart out of the Trader Joe\u0027s in West Hollywood, at Amoeba, standing in the lobby of the ArcLight. All of the pictures are faked but I get it - this is a warning of some kind. And right when I\u0027m about to eject the disk Rip calls me, as if he\u0027s timed it, as if he knows what I\u0027m looking at, and he tells me another video will be arriving soon and that I need to watch that one as well. \"What is it?\" I ask. I keep staring at the photos fading in and out: Amanda and me buying star maps on Benedict Canyon, the two of us standing in front of the Capitol Records Building like we were tourists, at an outside table on the patio at the Ivy having lunch. \"Just something somebody sent to me,\" Rip says. \"I think you should see it.\" \"Why?\" I\u0027m staring at a photo of Amanda and me in the black BMW in the parking lot of the In-N-Out in Sherman Oaks. \"It\u0027s persuasive,\" Rip says, and then he tells me that the licenses for the club he wants to open in Hollywood have finally been approved, and that I should stop telling people not to put Rain in their movies. The new disk arrives that afternoon. I remove the disk of Amanda Flew and me at JFK and put the new disk into the computer but I turn it off almost immediately once I see what it is: Julian tied to a chair, naked. After I drink enough gin to calm down I stand at my desk in the office. They had drawn lines with a black marker all over his body - the \"nonlethal entry wounds\" as the Los Angeles County coroner\u0027s office was quoted in the Los Angeles Times article about the torture-murder of Julian Wells. These are the stab wounds that will allow Julian to live long enough to understand that he will slowly bleed to death. There are more than a hundred of them drawn all over his chest and torso and legs as well as his back and neck and the head which has been freshly shaved, and when I\u0027m able to look back at the screen one of the hooded figures standing over Julian whispers something to another hooded figure but the second I pause the disk I get a text from a blocked number that asks What are you waiting for? About twenty minutes into the disk I mistake static for the clouds of flies swarming around the room below the flickering fluorescent lights and crawling over Julian\u0027s abdomen which has been painted dark red, and when Julian starts screaming, weeping for his dead mother, the video goes black. When it resumes Julian\u0027s making muffled sounds and that\u0027s when I realize they\u0027ve cut out his tongue and that\u0027s why his chin is slathered with blood, and then within a minute he\u0027s blinded. In the final moments of the disk the sound track is of the threatening message I left on Julian\u0027s phone two weeks ago and accompanied by my drunken voice the hooded figures start punching him randomly with the knives, chunks of flesh spattering the floor, and it seems to go on forever until the cement block is raised over his head.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-49.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
