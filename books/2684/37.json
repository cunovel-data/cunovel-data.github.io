The lights are off and there\u0027s a white rectangle floating low above the couch: a phone glowing in the darkness, illuminating Rip\u0027s face. Too drunk to panic I reach for the wall and the room slowly fills with a dim light. Rip waits for me to say something, lounging on the couch as if this is where he\u0027s always belonged, an open bottle of tequila in the background. Finally he mentions something about an awards show he was at and, almost as an afterthought, asks me where I\u0027ve been. \"What are you doing here?\" I ask. \"How did you get in?\" \"I have some friends in the building,\" Rip says, explaining something supposedly very simple. \"Let\u0027s take a ride.\" \"Why?\" \"Because your apartment probably isn\u0027t\" - he squints up at me - \"secure.\" In the limousine Rip shows me e-mails that were received at Rain\u0027s allamericangirlUSA account. There are four of them and I read each one of them on Rip\u0027s iPhone in the limo as we cruise along a deserted Mulholland, an old Warren Zevon song hovering in the air-conditioned darkness. At first I\u0027m not even sure what I\u0027m looking at but in the third e-mail I\u0027ve supposedly written that I will kill that f**ker - a reference to Rain\u0027s \"boyfriend\" Julian - and the e-mails become maps that need to be redesigned in order to be properly followed, but they\u0027re accurate on certain points and have a secret and purposeful strategy to them, though other details about Rain and me don\u0027t track, things that have nothing to do with us: the references to kabbalah, comments about a musical number on a recent awards show that I\u0027ve never seen, Hugh Jackman singing an ironic version of \"On the Sunny Side of the Street,\" my interest in the signs of the zodiac - all of them mistakes in the specifics of our relationship. I keep rereading this e-mail and wondering who wrote these things - clues that are supposed to be followed, an idea that is supposed to lead somewhere - until I realize: It doesn\u0027t matter, everything leads to me, I called this upon myself. \"Read the next one, please.\" Rip reaches over and skips to the next e-mail as casually as if he\u0027s flipping through a brochure. \"Interesting reference about you and the missing bitch roommate.\" In the fourth e-mail I supposedly wrote and I\u0027ll do to Julian what I\u0027ve already done to Amanda Flew. \"How did you get these?\" I ask, my hands clasped around the iPhone. \"Please\" is all Rip says. \"I didn\u0027t write these, Rip.\" \"Maybe you did,\" Rip says. \"Maybe you didn\u0027t.\" He pauses. \"Maybe she did. But it\u0027s been verified that they were all sent from one of your e-mail accounts.\" I keep skimming from one e-mail and then back to another. \"I\u0027ll kill that f**ker,\" Rip murmurs. \"Doesn\u0027t sound like you, but who knows? ... I mean, you can be a cold dude sometimes, but ... these are actually rather heartfelt and sad.\" He reads from one of them: \"But this time there was an explosion and my feelings as a man cannot be adjusted ... \" He starts laughing. \"Why are you showing these to me?\" I ask. \"I didn\u0027t write them.\" \"Because they could potentially incriminate you.\" I back away from Rip, unable to mask my loathing. \"What movie do you think you\u0027re in?\" \"Maybe one of the crappy ones you\u0027ve written,\" Rip says, not laughing anymore. \"Well, then, who wrote them, Clay?\" he asks in a forced and playful voice as if he already knew the answer. \"Maybe she wrote them to herself,\" I mutter in the darkness. \"Or maybe ... somebody else wrote them,\" Rip says. \"Maybe somebody who doesn\u0027t like you?\" I don\u0027t say anything. \"Barry warned you about her, huh?\" Rip asks. \"Barry?\" I murmur, staring into the iPhone. \"What?\" \"Woolf,\" Rip says. \"Your life coach.\" He pauses. \"The one on Sawtelle.\" He turns to me. \"He warned you about her.\" He pauses again. \"And you didn\u0027t listen.\" \"What if I told you I don\u0027t care one way or another?\" \"Well, then I\u0027d be very worried for you.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-37.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
