The so-called actress you promised to give a part to in your little movie? Does this ring a bell? Please, don\u0027t be an idiot with me.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t say anything. I\u0027m suddenly gripping the iron railing. The information is an excuse not to look at him anymore. The fear, the big black stain of it, is rushing forward and it\u0027s in the heat and the vast expanse of empty terrace and everywhere else.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re shaking there, bro,\" Rip says. \"Maybe you want to sit down?\"\\n\\n On the East Terrace I\u0027m finally numb enough to listen as Rip starts speaking again, after he takes a brief call confirming lunch and texts someone else back and we\u0027re sitting on a bench in direct sunlight and I feel my skin blistering and I can\u0027t move and up close Rip\u0027s face is androgynous and his eyelashes are tinted.\\n\\n \"Anyway, so I meet her and I like her and I think we hit it off and then I\u0027m not paying for it anymore and I\u0027m actually thinking about divorcing my wife, which shows you how committed I am to this girl.\" Rip keeps gesturing with his hands. \"I tell Rain to quit the gig and she does. I take care of everything - pay the rent for her and the bitch roommate in that dump on Orange Grove, clothes, f**king hair, the Beamer, personal trainer, tanning salon, whatever she wants. I even got her a gig at that place on La Cienega, Reveal, all these things that Julian can\u0027t afford to do - and guess what she still really wants?\"\\n\\n Rip waits. I\u0027m processing everything. And then it hits me and I say in a low voice, \"She still wants to be an actress.\"\\n\\n \"Well, she wants to be famous,\" Rip says. \"But at least you\u0027re paying attention,\" he says. \"That\u0027s basically the correct answer.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t unclench my fists and Rip gets up and starts pacing in front of me.\\n\\n \"I think you know by now it\u0027s never going to happen for her, but anyway Julian\u0027s been bragging about what a great friend Clay is and that he\u0027ll be sure to hook her up with you and this movie that I guess you have some hand in casting. Whatever. I mean, it sounded like bullshit to me but you\u0027ve gotta have hope, right?\" Rip suddenly stops and checks his phone, then puts it back in his pocket. \"But when you first got into town Julian kind of riled you up about something and I guess you guys didn\u0027t exactly hit it off that night so he didn\u0027t ask you to help out.\" Rip sighs, as if tired of it all, yet continues. \"Somehow she manages to get an audition - something I admittedly don\u0027t really care about or have the juice to do and anyway I think it\u0027s a waste of time because she has no talent - and so she comes in and reads for you guys and I\u0027m guessing she\u0027s just f**k-awful but she has her charms and the rest is ... well, why don\u0027t you tell me what the rest is, Clay?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m just sitting silently on the stone bench.\\n\\n \"I take it you\u0027ve been banging her for a couple of weeks now?\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n Rip sighs. \"That\u0027s an answer in a way.\"\\n\\n \"Rip, please - \"\\n\\n \"And then she splits for San Diego,\" Rip says. \"Right?\"\\n\\n \"She went to see her family.\"\\n\\n \"Family?\" Rip scowls. \"Did you know that Julian was in San Diego with her?\"\\n\\n \"Why would I know that?\" I say.\\n\\n \"Oh, come on, Clay - \"\\n\\n \"Rip, please, what do you want?\"\\n\\n He considers this. \"I want her.\" And then he considers something else. \"I mean, I know, I know, she\u0027s just a dumb cunt actress, right?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m nodding and Rip registers the nods and cocks his head, curious.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re agreeing with me, then why are you so beat up over her?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I say quietly. \"I just am.\"\\n\\n \"Have you ever thought that maybe this - your little freak-out - isn\u0027t about her?\" Rip says. \"That maybe it\u0027s about you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I swallow. \"I haven\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Look, you\u0027re not the threat,\" Rip says. \"She\u0027s just using you. However ... she really likes him.\" Rip pauses. \"Julian\u0027s the problem.\"\\n\\n \"The problem? What are you talking about? Why is he the problem?\"\\n\\n \"Julian is the problem,\" Rip says, \"because Rain denied anything was going on with him until I found out about their little vacation in San Diego last week.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-25.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
