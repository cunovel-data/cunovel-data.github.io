Why are you so angry?\" she asks after I order another drink. \"I was only gone five days.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not angry,\" I say. \"I just didn\u0027t hear from you ... \"\\n\\n \"Look.\" She scrolls through the iPhone I bought her and shows me pictures of herself with an older woman, the Pacific in the background.\\n\\n \"Who took these pictures?\" I automatically ask.\\n\\n \"A friend of mine,\" she says. \"A girlfriend,\" she stresses.\\n\\n \"Why does that guy at the bar keep looking at you?\"\\n\\n Rain doesn\u0027t even glance at the bar when she says, \"I don\u0027t know,\" and then shows me more pictures of herself in San Diego with the older woman I don\u0027t believe is her mother.\\n\\n Heading up Doheny I\u0027m looking through the windshield of the BMW and I notice the lights in the condo are on. Rain sits in the passenger seat, arms crossed, considering something.\\n\\n \"Did I leave the lights on?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"No,\" she says, distracted. \"I don\u0027t remember.\"\\n\\n I make a right on Elevado to see if the blue Jeep is there and I cruise by the spot where it\u0027s usually parked and it isn\u0027t there, and after circling the block a couple of times I pull into the driveway of the Doheny Plaza and the valet takes the car and then Rain and I go back to 1508 and she lets me go down on her and when I\u0027m hard enough she sucks me off, and when I wake up the next morning, she\u0027s gone.\\n\\n Rain is the only topic discussed in Dr. Woolf\u0027s office on Sawtelle and I had referred to her anonymously in the last session while she was in San Diego as \"this girl\" but now with the information I have about Julian I tell him everything: how I had met Rain Turner at a Christmas party, and I realize while I\u0027m describing that moment to Dr. Woolf that I had drinks with Julian at the Beverly Hills Hotel almost immediately afterward, and how I ran into her again at the casting sessions and then at the lounge on La Cienega, and I detail the days we spent together that last week of December and how I began to think it was real, like what I had with Meghan Reynolds, and then found out from Blair that Rain is supposedly Julian\u0027s girlfriend - at this point Dr. Woolf puts down his notepad and seems more patient with me than he probably is, and I\u0027m trying to figure out the game plan and then realize Julian must have known that Rain and I had spent those days together but how was that possible? Finally, near the end of the session, Dr. Woolf says, \"I would urge you not to see this girl anymore,\" and then \"I would urge you to cut off all contact.\" After another long silence he asks, \"Why are you crying?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-23.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
