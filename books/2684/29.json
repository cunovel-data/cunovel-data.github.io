Were you with Julian?\"\n \"If this is going to work the way you want it to,\" she says, \"I have to take care of some things first.\"\n \"What things?\" I\u0027m walking out of the complex, holding the phone tightly against my ear.\n \"You can\u0027t ask me that.\"\n \"I talked to them about you.\" I realize I\u0027m unable to move while I\u0027m on the phone with her. \"They\u0027re going to see you again.\"\n \"Thanks,\" she says. \"But listen, I have to go.\"\n \"There\u0027s a party tonight,\" I say. \"Here in Culver City.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I can make that, Clay.\"\n \"Rain - \"\n \"Just give me a day or two and then we can be together, okay?\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me you knew Kelly Montrose?\"\n \"I\u0027ll explain everything when I see you,\" she says. \"I have to go.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me Kelly Montrose got you the audition?\" I\u0027m whispering this.\n \"You never asked,\" she says, and then hangs up.\n There\u0027s nothing to do but wait for the party and since I have nowhere else to go I stick around Culver City, skipping the afternoon auditions, the fear returning as I walk to a liquor store to buy aspirin, the alcoholic dreaminess of everything, the ghosts swarming everywhere whispering You need to be careful who you let into your life, and I\u0027m pacing the courtyard while I return a couple of calls - leaving messages for the agent, the manager, the movie about the monkeys, Dr. Woolf - and smoking cigarettes by the swimming pool and watching the decorating crew string up lights along the length of a curving beige wall that borders one end of the pool and then I\u0027m introduced to the actor who got the main role of Grant, Kevin Spacey\u0027s son, in The Listeners and the boy is unusually handsome even with the beard he has because of the pirate movie he\u0027s shooting and screens have been set up and headshots of various young actors are flashing on them and then from somewhere complaints are made and the screens are repositioned and I meet another girl who won another modeling competition and the afternoon becomes grayer, the sky shrouded with clouds, and someone asks me, \"What\u0027s the matter, dude?\"\n The party surrounds the pool and paper lanterns are strung along the courtyard and songs from the eighties are playing and everyone\u0027s familiar-looking even though they\u0027re all eighteen and I\u0027m hoping that Rain will surprise me by showing up but also knowing that she won\u0027t. Cade, the trainer from Equinox, is here - I forgot that I had made the call - and now that I understand what his connection to Julian really is I\u0027m embarrassed Cade thinks I\u0027m clueless enough not to know, and I\u0027m standing next to one of Jason\u0027s assistants and drinking vodka from a plastic cup and the boy playing Kevin Spacey\u0027s son keeps asking me questions about his character that I answer in a monotone and he responds by pointing out an owl that\u0027s nesting in the palm tree and then I see the actress - she\u0027s a girl, really - that I hit on in the first-class lounge at JFK before Christmas, maybe a month ago, and Amanda Flew is so much younger than I remember and whenever she glances over at me she smiles nervously at the boy she\u0027s talking to and sometimes the boy whispers in her ear and another boy lights her cigarettes and I\u0027m now aware that I\u0027ve drunk too much.\n \"Do you know that girl?\" I ask the assistant. \"Amanda Flew?\"\n \"Yeah,\" the assistant says. \"Do you know her?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I say. \"I f**ked her.\"\n There\u0027s a beat but when I look over at him he says, \"Cool.\" He shrugs but he\u0027s creeped out. \"She\u0027s hot. She\u0027s slammin\u0027.\" Another pause. \"I guess she likes older guys, huh?\"\n \"Yeah, I guess.\" I shrug too, and then ask, \"Why do you say that?\"\n \"I thought she was one of Rip Millar\u0027s girls.\"\n I\u0027m watching as Amanda gets a text, glances at it and then makes a call. She barely says anything, just listens, and then clicks off.\n \"His girls?\" I\u0027m asking.\n \"Yeah,\" the assistant says and then noting my reaction in just those two words, adds, \"I mean, it\u0027s not like a secret or anything. She was part of his pu**y posse.\" He pauses. \"But I\u0027ve heard she\u0027s crazy. Really messed up.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-29.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: \n Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
