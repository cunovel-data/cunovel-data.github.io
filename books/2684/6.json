I gaze at him, then answer cautiously. \"It\u0027s coming along. We\u0027re casting.\" I wait as long as I can, then I knock back the drink and light a cigarette. \"For some reason the producer and director think my input\u0027s important. Valuable. They\u0027re artists.\" I take a drag off the cigarette. \"It\u0027s basically a joke.\" \"I think it\u0027s cool,\" Julian says. \"It\u0027s all about control, right?\" He considers something. \"It\u0027s not a joke. You should take it seriously. I mean, you\u0027re also one of the producers - \" I cut him off. \"Why have you been tracking this?\" \"It\u0027s a big deal and - \" \"Julian, it\u0027s a movie,\" I say. \"Why have you been tracking this? It\u0027s just another movie.\" \"Maybe for you.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Maybe for others it\u0027s something else,\" Julian says. \"Something more meaningful.\" \"I get where you\u0027re coming from, but there\u0027s a vampire in it.\" Inside, the piano player\u0027s doing jazzy riffs on Christmas carols. I concentrate on that. I\u0027m already locked out of everything. It\u0027s that time of night when I\u0027ve entered the dead zone and I\u0027m not coming out. \"What happened to that girl you were seeing?\" he asks. \"Laurie? In New York?\" \"No, out here. Last summer.\" He pauses. \"The actress.\" I try to pause but fail. \"Meghan,\" I say casually. \"Right.\" He draws the word out. \"I really have no idea.\" I lift the glass, rattle the ice around. Julian innocently glances at me, his eyes widening slightly. This makes it clear he has information he wants to give me. I realize that I sat here, in this very same booth, one afternoon with Blair, in a different era, something I wouldn\u0027t have remembered if I hadn\u0027t seen her tonight. \"Are we lost again, Julian?\" I sigh. \"Are we gonna play out another scene?\" \"Hey, you\u0027ve been gone a long time and - \" \"How do you even know about that?\" I ask suddenly. \"You and I weren\u0027t hanging then.\" \"What do you mean?\" he asks. \"I saw you last summer.\" Chapter 2 \"How do you know about Meghan Reynolds?\" \"Someone told me you were helping her out ... giving her a break - \" \"We were f**king, Julian.\" \"She said that you - \" \"I don\u0027t care what she said.\" I stand up. \"Everyone lies.\" \"Hey,\" he says softly. \"It\u0027s just a code.\" \"No. Everyone lies.\" I stub the cigarette out. \"It\u0027s just another language you have to learn.\" Then he delicately adds, \"I think you need some coffee, dude.\" Pause. \"Why are you so angry?\" \"I\u0027m out of here, Julian.\" I start walking away. \"As usual, a total mistake.\" A blue Jeep follows me from the Beverly Hills Hotel to where the cab drops me off in front of the Doheny Plaza. Something has changed since I was here seven hours ago. I call the doorman while staring at the desk in my office. The computer is on. It wasn\u0027t when I left. I\u0027m staring at the stack of paper next to the computer. When the doorman answers I\u0027m staring at a small knife used to open envelopes that was placed on the stack of paper. It was in a drawer when I headed out to the premiere. I hang the phone up without saying anything. Moving around the condo I ask, \"Is anyone here?\" I lean over the duvet in the bedroom. I run my hand across it. It smells different. I check the door for the third time. It\u0027s locked. I stare at the Christmas tree longer than I should and then I take the elevator down to the lobby.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-6.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
