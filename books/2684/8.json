{"id":69537,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"Are you happy?\" she asks. Startled, I say, \"Yeah. Are you?\" She leans in. \"I could be.\" \"What do you want to do?\" I look at her straight on. We spend an hour in the bedroom in the condo on the fifteenth floor of the Doheny Plaza. That\u0027s all it requires. Afterward she says she feels disconnected from reality. I tell her it doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m blushing when she tells me how nice my hands are. The premiere is at the Village and the after-party, elaborate and fanciful, is at the W Hotel. (It was supposed to be at the Napa Valley Grille - because of overcrowding was moved to this less accessible but larger venue.) Forced to watch people pretend to yell and cry for two and a half hours can push you to a dark distance that takes a day to come back from, yet I found the movie well made and coherent (which is always a miracle) even though I often had to think awful thoughts in order to stay awake. I\u0027m standing by the pool talking to a young actress about fasting and her yoga routine and how superstoked she is to be in a movie about human sacrifices, and the initial shyness - apparent in large, soft eyes - is encouraging. But then you say the wrong thing and those eyes reveal an innate distrust mixed with a lingering curiosity that everyone shares out here and she drifts off, and looking up at the hotel, encased in the crowd, clutching my phone, I start counting how many rooms are lit and how many aren\u0027t and then realize I\u0027ve had sex with five different people in this hotel, one of them now dead. I take a piece of sushi from a passing tray. \"Well, you did it,\" I tell the executive who allowed this movie to be made. Daniel Carter, who I\u0027ve known since we were freshmen at Camden, is the director, but our friendship is worn out and he\u0027s been avoiding me. And tonight I see why: he\u0027s with Meghan Reynolds, so I can\u0027t offer the faked congratulations I prepared. Daniel sold his first script when he was twenty-two and has had no problems with his career since then. \"She\u0027s dressed like a teenager,\" Blair says. \"I guess that\u0027s because she is one.\" I glance over at Blair, then look back across the crowd at Meghan and Daniel. \"I\u0027m not going there with you now.\" \"We all make choices, right?\" \"Your husband hates me.\" \"No, he doesn\u0027t.\" \"There was a girl at your house, at the party ... \" The need to ask about this is so physical I can\u0027t put a halt to it. I turn to Blair. \"Never mind.\" \"I heard you had drinks with Julian last night,\" Blair says. She\u0027s staring at the pool, the title of the movie shimmering on the bottom in giant cursive lettering. \"You heard?\" I light a cigarette. \"How did you hear this unless Julian told you?\" Blair doesn\u0027t say anything. \"So you\u0027re still in touch with Julian?\" I ask. \"Why?\" I pause. \"Does Trent know?\" Another pause. \"Or is that just a ... detail?\" \"What are you trying to say?\" \"That I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re actually talking to me.\" \"I just wanted to warn you about him. That\u0027s all.\" \"Warn me? About what?\" I ask. \"I\u0027ve been through the whole Julian thing before. I think I can handle it.\" \"It\u0027s not a big hassle,\" she says. \"If you can just do me a favor and not talk to him if he tries to make contact it would make everything a lot easier.\" And then for emphasis she adds, \"I\u0027d appreciate it.\" \"What\u0027s Julian doing these days? There was a rumor he was actually running a teenage hooker service.\" I pause. \"It sounded like old times.\" \"Look, if you can just do this one thing I\u0027d really appreciate it.\" \"Is this real? Or is this just an excuse to talk to me again?\" \"You could have called. You could have ... \" Her voice trails off. \"I tried,\" I say. \"But you were angry.\" \"Not angry,\" she says. \"Just ... disappointed.\" She pauses. \"You didn\u0027t try hard enough.\" For a few seconds we\u0027re both silent and it\u0027s a cold and minor variation on so many conversations we\u0027ve had and I\u0027m thinking about the blond girl on the veranda and I imagine Blair\u0027s thinking about the last time I made love to her. This disparity should scar me but doesn\u0027t. And then Blair\u0027s talking to a guy from CAA and a band begins playing, which I take as my cue to leave, but really it\u0027s the text I suddenly get that says I\u0027m watching you that pushes me out of the party. At the valet in front of the hotel, Rip Millar grabs my arm as I\u0027m texting Who is this? and I have to yank my arm away since I\u0027m so alarmed by his appearance. I don\u0027t recognize Rip at first. His face is unnaturally smooth, redone in such a way that the eyes are shocked open with perpetual surprise; it\u0027s a face mimicking a face, and it looks agonized. The lips are too thick. The skin\u0027s orange. The hair is dyed yellow and carefully gelled. He looks like he\u0027s been quickly dipped in acid; things fell off, skin was removed. It\u0027s almost defiantly grotesque. He\u0027s on drugs, I\u0027m thinking. He has to be on drugs to look like this. Rip\u0027s with a girl so young I mistake her for his daughter but then I remember Rip doesn\u0027t have any children. The girl has had so much work done that she looks deformed. Rip had been handsome once and his voice is the same whisper it was when we were nineteen.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-8.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
