I know what it is but pretend that I don\u0027t.\\n\\n At the Getty there\u0027s a dinner thrown by two DreamWorks executives for a curator of a new exhibit and I go alone and I\u0027m in a better mood, just floating through it all, looking good, a little buzzed, and I\u0027m standing on the terrace gazing out over the blackest sky and asking myself, What would Mara say? And on the tram ride up the hill I was in the same car as Trent and Blair and I was listening to Alana share her frustrations about a plastic surgeon and I nodded while watching the traffic speeding by on the 405 below us and from where I\u0027m standing now nothing is visible in the darkened canyons until the lights of the hushed city fan out of that darkness and I keep checking my phone for messages and I\u0027m almost done with my second martini when a boy in a catering uniform tells me that dinner will be served in fifteen minutes and then that boy is replaced by Blair.\\n\\n \"I hope you\u0027re not driving tonight,\" she says.\\n\\n \"Hey, I had a bad feeling when I showed up but I\u0027m happy now.\"\\n\\n \"You look like you\u0027re in a good mood.\"\\n\\n \"I am.\"\\n\\n \"When I saw you at Spago the other night I didn\u0027t think you could possibly be happy.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I am now.\"\\n\\n She pauses. \"I don\u0027t think I want to know why.\"\\n\\n I finish the martini and place the glass on a ledge and then smile harmlessly at her, and I\u0027m lightly swaying and Blair\u0027s looking at the shimmering sea curving toward us and it\u0027s miles and miles away.\\n\\n \"I thought of ignoring you but then decided not to,\" she says, moving closer to me.\\n\\n \"Now I feel pressured but I\u0027m glad you\u0027re talking to me.\" I turn back to the view of the city. \"Why didn\u0027t you talk to me for so long? What was that about?\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking about my own safety.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you talking to me now?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t scare me anymore.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027ve become an optimist.\"\\n\\n \"I kept thinking I could change you,\" she says. \"All those years.\"\\n\\n \"But would that have been who you really wanted?\" I stop and think it through. \"Or would that have been who I really wanted to be?\"\\n\\n \"What you really want to be doesn\u0027t exist, Clay.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you laughing when you say that?\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to know if you\u0027d talked to Julian,\" she asks. \"Or did you do what I asked you to and just leave it alone?\"\\n\\n \"You mean follow your instructions?\"\\n\\n \"If you want to put it that way.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I saw him a couple of times and now I guess he\u0027s left town for a little while.\" I pause, then go for it: \"Rain told me she doesn\u0027t know where he is.\"\\n\\n At the mention of her name, Blair says, \"You all have a very interesting relationship.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just complicated,\" I offer casually. \"Like it always is.\"\\n\\n \"She gets around, doesn\u0027t she?\" Blair asks. \"First Julian, then Rip, then Kelly and then you ... \" She pauses. \"I wonder who\u0027s next.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n Chapter 11\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not judging.\" She moves closer to me. \"But Rain knows where Julian is. I mean, if I know where Julian is, then of course she knows.\"\\n\\n \"What is the source of your information?\" I stop. \"Oh, right. Your husband reps her.\"\\n\\n \"Not really. There\u0027s really nothing to rep.\" She pauses. \"I think you know this, too.\"\\n\\n \"So where is Julian?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Why do you want to know where he is?\" she asks. \"Are you still friends?\"\\n\\n \"Well, we used to be friends,\" I say. \"But, I guess ... well, no, now we\u0027re not. It happens.\" I pause, then I can\u0027t help it. I ask again, \"Where is he? How do you know where he is?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-36.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
