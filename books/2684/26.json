In San Diego? Sweet.\" But after he studies my reaction the smile fades. \"The first time I found out they were together I had gotten some information she couldn\u0027t lie her way out of and I let it go because she promised me she wouldn\u0027t go back to him or do anything with him but ... this time ... I just don\u0027t know.\" \"What don\u0027t you know?\" \"This time ... I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll hurt him or not.\" Rip says this so gently and with so little menace that it doesn\u0027t sound like a threat and I start laughing. \"I\u0027m serious,\" Rip says. \"This is not a joke, Clay.\" \"I think that\u0027s a little extreme.\" \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re probably very sensitive.\" After a long pause, Rip says flatly, \"I only want one thing. I want her back.\" \"But obviously she wants someone else.\" Rip takes a moment to study me. \"You\u0027re a very bitter dude.\" I\u0027m leaning forward, clutching my sides. I glance at him before nodding. \"Yeah. I guess I am.\" We\u0027re walking across the grass toward the black limo and the driver waiting there and Rip glances at the Astronomers Monument as we pass it and I\u0027m staring straight ahead, unable to focus on anything but the heat and the surreal blue sky and the hawks sailing over the soundless landscape, their shadows crossing the lawn, and I wonder if I\u0027m going to be able to make it back to Doheny without getting into an accident and then Rip asks me something that should have been just a formality but because of our conversation now isn\u0027t. \"What are you doing the rest of the afternoon?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I say, and then remember. \"Are you going to Kelly\u0027s memorial?\" \"That\u0027s today?\" \"Yeah.\" \"No,\" Rip says. \"Didn\u0027t really know him. We did some business, but that was a long time ago.\" The driver opens the door. \"I\u0027ve got to deal with this dickhead about the club. You know, the usual.\" He says this as if I should be hip enough to understand what exactly he means, and before getting into the limo Rip asks me, \"When are you seeing her next?\" \"I think maybe tonight.\" Then I can\u0027t help it and ask, \"How do you feel about that?\" \"Hey, I hope she gets the part. I\u0027m rooting for her.\" He pauses, and grins. \"Aren\u0027t you?\" I don\u0027t say anything. I just barely shake my head. \"Yeah,\" Rip says, convinced of something. \"I thought so.\" And then, as he slides into the back of the limo and before the driver shuts the door, Rip looks up at me and says, \"You have a history of this, don\u0027t you?\" I\u0027m supposed to go to a Golden Globes party at the Sunset Tower tonight but Rain doesn\u0027t want to even after I tell her that Mark and Jon are going to be there and that if she wants the part of Martina I should formally introduce her to them outside of Jason\u0027s office in Culver City. \"This isn\u0027t the way to do it,\" she mutters. \"But it\u0027s the way we\u0027re going to do it,\" I tell her. When she arrives at my place, newly bronzed, her hair blown out, she\u0027s wearing a strapless dress, but I\u0027m still in a robe, drinking vodka, stroking myself. She doesn\u0027t want to have sex. I turn away and tell her I\u0027m not going if we don\u0027t. She downs two shots of Patron in the kitchen and then strides into the bedroom and carefully takes off her dress and says, \"Just don\u0027t kiss me,\" gesturing at her makeup and while I\u0027m eating her out my fingers move to her ass and she brushes them away and says, \"I don\u0027t want to do it like that.\" Later, as she\u0027s putting the dress back on, I notice a bruise on the side of her torso that I hadn\u0027t seen before. \"Who did that to you?\" I ask. She cranes her neck to look at the bruise. \"Oh, that?\" she says. \"You did.\" Entering the party at the Sunset Tower we\u0027re behind a famous actor and the cameras start flashing like a strobe and I pull Rain with me toward the bar and when I catch my reflection in a mirror my face is a skull, sunburned from the hour spent at the observatory, and on the terrace overlooking the pool, snaking through the hum of the crowd with Rain, I say hello to a few people I recognize while nodding to others I don\u0027t but who seem to recognize me and I make small talk with various people about the Kelly Montrose memorial even though I wasn\u0027t there and then I spot Trent and Blair and I move in another direction since I don\u0027t want Blair to see me with Rain, and projected onto the walls are black-and-white photos of palm trees, stills of Palisades Park from the 1940s, girls who were cast in the new James Bond movie, and trays of doughnuts are being passed around and I\u0027m chewing gum so I won\u0027t smoke and then I spot Mark with his wife and I bring Rain over to where they\u0027re standing and Mark frowns when he sees her, and then erases it with a smile before we fake-hug, his eyes never leaving Rain, his wife\u0027s reaction a barely concealed hostility, and then I launch into an explanation as to why I haven\u0027t been at the casting sessions and Mark says that I should come in tomorrow and I assure him I will and just as I\u0027m about to make a pitch for Rain my phone vibrates in my pocket and I pull it out and there\u0027s a text from a blocked number that says She knows and after I type in ? Mark and his wife drift off and Rain, seemingly uncaring that I didn\u0027t pitch her to Mark, is behind me talking to another young actress and a new text arrives: She knows that you know.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-26.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
