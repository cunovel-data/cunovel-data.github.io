The transparency of the deal: she\u0027s good at handling it, and I admire that. Everything she says is an ocean of signals. Listening to her I realize that she\u0027s a lot of girls, but which one is talking to me? Which one will be driving back to the apartment on Orange Grove in the green BMW with the vanity plate that reads PLENTY? Which one would be coming to the bedroom in the Doheny Plaza? We exchange numbers. She puts her sunglasses on. \"So, what do you think my chances are?\" she asks. I say, \"I think you\u0027re going to be a lot of fun.\" \"How can you tell that I\u0027m going to be a lot of fun?\" she asks. \"Some people can\u0027t handle me.\" \"Why don\u0027t you let me see for myself,\" I say. \"How do I know you\u0027re not crazy?\" she asks. \"How do I know you\u0027re not the craziest dude I\u0027ve ever met?\" \"You\u0027ll have to test me out.\" \"You have my info,\" she says. \"I\u0027ll think about it.\" \"Rain,\" I say. \"That\u0027s not your real name.\" \"Does it matter?\" \"Well, it makes me wonder what else isn\u0027t real.\" \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re a writer,\" she says. \"That\u0027s because you make things up for a living.\" \"And?\" \"And\" - she shrugs - \"I\u0027ve noticed that writers tend to worry about things like that.\" \"About what?\" She gets into the car. \"Things like that.\" Dr. Woolf has an office in a nondescript building on Sawtelle. He\u0027s my age and deals primarily with actors and screenwriters, the three-hundred-dollar sessions partly covered by Writers Guild health insurance. I was referred last summer by an actor whose stalled career hastened a relapse, and this was in July after the breakdown over Meghan Reynolds entered its most intense stage, and during the first session Dr. Woolf stopped me when I started reading aloud the e-mails from Meghan that I saved on my iPhone, and we proceeded into the Reversal of Desire exercise - I want pain, I love pain, pain brings freedom - and one afternoon in August I left midsession in a rage and drove up to Santa Monica Boulevard where I parked in an empty lot and watched a new print of Contempt at the Nuart, slouched in the front row slowly crushing a box of candy, and when I came out of the theater I stared at a digital billboard overlooking the parking lot, its image: an unmade bed, the sheets rumpled, a naked body half lit in a darkened room, white Helvetica lettering curved against the color of flesh. The nude pics Rain sends me later that afternoon (they come so much sooner than I expected) are either artistic and boring (sepia-toned, shadowy, posed) or sleazy and arousing (on someone\u0027s balcony, legs spread, holding a cell phone in one hand and an unlit cigarette in the other; standing next to a blue-sheeted mattress in an anonymous bedroom, fingers splayed against her lower abdomen), but every one of them is an invitation, every one of them plays on the idea that exposure can ensure fame. At the cocktail party in a suite at the Chateau Marmont - where we needed to sign confidentiality agreements in order to attend - no one says anything nearly as interesting as what Rain\u0027s pictures promise. The pictures offer a tension, an otherness, that\u0027s lacking in the suite overlooking Sunset. It\u0027s the same dialogue (\"What\u0027s happening with The Listeners?\" \"You\u0027ve been in New York the last four months?\" \"Why are you so thin?\") spoken by the same actors (Pierce, Kim, Alana) and the rooms might as well be empty and my answers to the questions (\"Yeah, everyone has been warned about the nudity.\" \"I\u0027m tired of New York.\" \"Different trainer, yoga.\") might as well have been made up of distant avian sounds. This is the last party before everyone goes out of town and I\u0027m hearing about the usual spots in Hawaii, Aspen, Palm Springs, various private islands, and the party\u0027s being thrown by a British actor staying at the hotel who had played the villain in a comic-book movie I adapted. \"Werewolves of London\" keeps blaring, a video of a ceremony at the Kodak Theatre keeps replaying itself on TV screens. A horrible story has moved rapidly through town involving a young Hispanic actress whose body was somehow found in a mass grave across the border, and for some reason this is connected to a drug cartel in Tijuana. Mangled bodies were strewn through the pit. Tongues were cut out. And the story gets more outlandish as it keeps being retold: there\u0027s now a barrel of industrial acid containing liquefied human remains. A body is now dumped in front of an elementary school as a warning, a taunting message. I keep checking Rain\u0027s pics that were sent through earthlink.net from allamericangirlUSA (subject heading: hey crazy, let\u0027s get cracking) when I\u0027m interrupted by a text from a blocked number.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-12.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
