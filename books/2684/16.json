{"id":69545,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"We sit in my office naked, buzzed on champagne, while she shows me pics from a Calvin Klein show, audition tapes a friend shot, a modeling portfolio, paparazzi photos of her at B-list events - the opening of a shoe store on Canon, a charity benefit at someone\u0027s home in Brentwood, standing with a group of girls at the Playboy Mansion at the Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream Party - and then always it seems we\u0027re back in the bedroom.\\n\\n \"What do you want for Christmas?\" she asks.\\n\\n \"This. You.\" I smile. \"What do you want?\"\\n\\n \"I want a part in your movie,\" she says. \"You know that.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" I ask, my hand tracing her thigh. \"My movie? Which part?\"\\n\\n \"I want the part of Martina.\" She kisses me, her hand moving down to my cock, gripping it, releasing it, gripping it again.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m going to try and get it for you.\"\\n\\n The pause is involuntary but she recovers in a second. \"Try?\"\\n\\n If we aren\u0027t in bed or watching movies we\u0027re at the Bristol Farms down the street buying champagne or at the Apple store in the Westfield Mall in Century City because she needs a new computer and also wants an iPhone (\"It\u0027s Christmas,\" she purrs as if it matters) and I\u0027ll hand the BMW over to the valet at the mall and notice the looks from the guys taking the car, and the stares from so many other men roaming the mall, and she notices them too and walks quickly, pulling me along, while talking mindlessly to no one on her cell phone, a self-protective gesture, a way to combat the stares by not acknowledging them. These stares are always the grim reminders of a pretty girl\u0027s life in this town, and though I\u0027ve been with other beautiful women, the neurosis about their looks had already hardened into a kind of bitter acceptance that Rain doesn\u0027t seem to share. One of the last afternoons together that December, we\u0027re heading to the Apple store drunk on champagne, Rain nestling into me, wearing Yves Saint Laurent sunglasses as we walk beneath the overcast sky looming above the towers of Century City, the chiming bells of Christmas carols everywhere, and she\u0027s happy because we\u0027d just watched her reel, which includes the two scenes she was in from a Jim Carrey movie, a drama that tanked. (After squinting hard at the screen, I enthusiastically complimented her and then asked why she hadn\u0027t listed the movie on her resume, and she admitted the scenes were cut.) She\u0027s still asking me if I\u0027m telling the truth about her scenes as we move toward the Apple store and I assure her that I am instead of admitting how dismaying the performance actually was. There was no way those scenes should have been kept in the movie - the decision to remove them was the correct one. (I have to stop myself from wondering how she got the part, because that would be entering a maze with no escape.) What keeps me interested - and it always does - is how can she be a bad actress on film but a good one in reality? This is where the suspense of it all usually lies. And later, for the first time since Meghan Reynolds, I think hopefully - lying in bed, lifting a glass filled with champagne to my lips, her face hovering above mine - that maybe she isn\u0027t acting with me.\\n\\n We\u0027re shopping at the Bristol Farms on Doheny for another case of champagne in the last week of December when I lose her in one of the aisles and I become dazed when I realize that the market used to be Chasen\u0027s, the restaurant I came to with my parents on various Christmas Eves, when I was a teenager, and I try to reconfigure the restaurant\u0027s layout while standing in the produce section, \"Do They Know It\u0027s Christmas?\" playing throughout the store, and when nothing comes it\u0027s a sad relief. And then I notice Rain\u0027s gone and I\u0027m moving through the aisles and I\u0027m thinking about pictures of her naked on a yacht, my hand between her legs, my tongue on her cunt while she comes and then I find her outside, leaning against my BMW talking to a handsome guy I don\u0027t recognize, his arm in a sling, and he walks away as I wheel my cart toward them and when I ask her who he was she smiles reassuringly and says \"Graham\" and then \"No one\" and then \"He\u0027s a magician.\" I kiss her on the mouth. She looks nervously around. I watch her reflection in the window of the BMW. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I ask. \"Not here,\" she says, but as if \"not here\" is a promise of somewhere better. The deserted parking lot is suddenly freezing, the icy air so cold it shimmers.\\n\\n During that week we spend together things aren\u0027t completely tracking - there are lapses - but she acts like it doesn\u0027t matter, which helps cause the fear to fade away. Rain replaces it with something else that\u0027s easy to lose yourself in, despite, for example, the fact that a few of my friends still in town wanted to get together for dinner at Sona but the invitation caused a low-level anxiety in Rain that seemed alien to her nature and this became briefly revealing. (\"I don\u0027t want to be with anyone else but you\" is her excuse.) But the lapses and evasions aren\u0027t loud - Rain is still soothing enough for the texts from the blocked numbers to stop arriving and for the blue Jeep to disappear along with my desire to start work again on any number of projects I\u0027m involved with and the long brooding silences are gone and the bottle of Viagra in the nightstand drawer is left untouched and the ghosts rearranging things in the condo have taken flight and Rain makes me believe this is something with a future. Rain convinces me that this is really happening. Meghan Reynolds fades into a blur because Rain demands that the focus be on her, and because everything about her works for me I don\u0027t even realize it when it slips into something beyond simply working and for the first time since Meghan Reynolds I make the mistake of starting to care. But there\u0027s one dark fact humming loudly over everything that I keep trying to ignore but can\u0027t because it\u0027s the only thing that keeps the balance in place. It\u0027s the thing that doesn\u0027t let me fall completely away. It\u0027s the thing that saves me from collapsing: she\u0027s too old for the part she thinks she\u0027s going to get. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-16.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
