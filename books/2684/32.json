{"id":69561,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\"Hey,\" Daniel says, \"I\u0027d like to talk to you about an idea.\" He mentions a script I wrote called Adrenaline that the studio had put into turnaround. \"Cool,\" I say. I\u0027m holding a glass that\u0027s empty except for ice and limes, the remnants of a margarita. \"You\u0027re so thin,\" Daniel murmurs before he walks away with Meghan. Rain has called twice and left a text and I\u0027ve ignored them but when I see Daniel whispering something into Meghan\u0027s ear as they leave Spago I return Rain\u0027s call and she doesn\u0027t pick up. Dr. Woolf leaves a message on my landline canceling tomorrow\u0027s session and telling me that he can\u0027t see me as a patient anymore but that he\u0027ll refer me to someone else and the next morning I drive to the building on Sawtelle and park on the fourth floor of the garage and wait for his noon session to be over because that\u0027s when he takes his lunch break and I\u0027m listening to a song with the lyric So leave everything you know and carry only what you fear ... over and over again and I\u0027m nodding to myself while smoking cigarettes and making a list of all the things I\u0027m not going to ask Rain about and deciding I\u0027ll accept all the false explanations she\u0027s going to give me and how that\u0027s the only plan, and then I\u0027m remembering the person who warned me about how the world has to be a place where no one is interested in your questions and that if you\u0027re alone nothing bad can happen to you. In the stillness of the garage Dr. Woolf unlocks a silver Porsche. I get out of my car and walk toward him and call out his name. He pretends not to hear me at first and then he\u0027s startled when he turns around. He\u0027s annoyed when he sees who it is, but then his face relaxes almost as if he\u0027d been expecting this. \"Why can\u0027t you see me anymore?\" I ask. \"Look, I\u0027m just not able to help you - \" \"But why?\" I keep nearing him. \"I don\u0027t get it.\" \"Have you been drinking?\" he asks, pulling a cell phone out of his pocket like it\u0027s a warning of some kind. \"No, I haven\u0027t been drinking,\" I mutter. \"There\u0027s a very good guy in West Hollywood who I\u0027ll refer you to.\" \"I don\u0027t give a shit,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t want a f**king referral.\" \"Clay, calm down - \" \"Why the f**k are you dropping me as a patient?\" \"Hey, Clay, between us ... \" He pauses, makes a pained gesture, and his voice softens. \"Denise Tazzarek.\" He lets the name hang there in the shadows of the garage. \"I\u0027m not able to help you with ... that.\" I stand there for a second, wavering. \"Wait, who\u0027s Denise Tazzarek?\" \"The person you\u0027ve been seeing,\" he says. \"The one you talked about in the last session.\" \"What about her?\" He looks at me as if I shouldn\u0027t be confused. \"The girl you\u0027re talking about is a woman named Denise Tazzarek,\" he says, lowering his voice. \"I know who she is.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"I know who this is and I\u0027m not getting involved with her,\" he says. \"I\u0027ve had two patients involved with her and it\u0027s becoming a conflict of interest.\" He pauses. \"There\u0027s nothing I can do.\" \"And you think this is ... the same girl?\" \"Yes,\" he says. \"It\u0027s the same girl. Her real name is Denise Tazzarek,\" he says. \"This girl you were talking about, Rain Turner? She\u0027s Denise Tazzarek.\" I\u0027m bracing myself again, insanely alert. \"What do you know about her that ... I don\u0027t know?\" \"I told you in our last session: just stay away from her,\" he says, moving back to the Porsche. \"That\u0027s all you really need to know.\" I move closer to him. \"So you know Rip Millar?\" \"Clay - \" He swings into the driver\u0027s seat. \"And Julian Wells?\" \"I have to go - \" \"What about Kelly Montrose?\" Dr. Woolf puts the key in the ignition but stops suddenly at the mention of that name. Turning back to me he looks up and says, \"Kelly Montrose was a patient of mine.\" And then he closes the door and drives away. The valet at the Doheny Plaza opens the door of the BMW for me and as I get out he says someone\u0027s waiting in the lobby and that\u0027s when I see Julian\u0027s Audi, streaked with mud and rain, parked in front of the building. Walking toward the lobby I almost turn around and get back into the BMW but a wave of anger makes a decision for me. Julian\u0027s wearing Ray-Bans and sitting in a chair casually checking his phone but I can still see the slightly swollen left eye and the split lip, and the faint black and purple bruises on his tan neck and the bandaged wrist. I don\u0027t say anything as I walk past him. I just make a gesture for him to get up and follow me. The doorman behind the desk glances at Julian worriedly and then at me before I say, \"It\u0027s okay.\" Julian walks with me to the elevator and we don\u0027t say anything as he follows behind me down the hallway on the fifteenth floor and the only sound is when he clears his throat as I unlock the door and we step inside the apartment.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-32.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
