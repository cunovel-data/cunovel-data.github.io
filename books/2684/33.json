I think everyone knows what\u0027s going on.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, Julian, what the f**k are you doing?\" I ask in a hushed voice.\\n\\n \"It probably seems more complicated to you than it really is.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because you made it more complicated.\"\\n\\n He sighs, staring out the sliding glass doors at the afternoon light dimming over the city. \"Can I have a glass of water?\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t complicated for me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I guess I\u0027m sorry, but it isn\u0027t all about you, Clay.\"\\n\\n \"What does that even mean?\" I say, standing over him. \"I don\u0027t even know what that means.\"\\n\\n \"It means that there\u0027s a larger world out there and it\u0027s not all about you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re f**king crazy,\" I mutter. \"You\u0027re all f**king crazy.\"\\n\\n \"It is what it is, Clay.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up,\" I mutter, pacing the floor, lighting a cigarette. \"What is this bullshit - it is what it is?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027re so pissed,\" Julian says. \"You got what you wanted.\"\\n\\n \"And did you get what you wanted?\" I gesture at the bruises. \"Did Rip do this to you?\"\\n\\n \"I told you,\" Julian says, \"it was these Mexican kids.\" And then he asks again for some water.\\n\\n When I bring Julian a bottle of Fiji, he nods thanks and says after taking a careful sip, \"I don\u0027t talk to Rip anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" I ask. \"Oh, wait, let me guess.\"\\n\\n Julian shrugs and winces as he leans over and places the small plastic bottle on the ottoman. \"It wasn\u0027t so much about me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, then what do you think it was about if it wasn\u0027t about you?\"\\n\\n \"Rip snapped when Rain was with Kelly - \"\\n\\n \"What does snapped mean?\" I ask, cutting him off. \"So your girlfriend was f**king Rip and then she\u0027s f**king Kelly? And you\u0027re still with her?\"\\n\\n \"Clay, it\u0027s more complicated than - \"\\n\\n \"Why is Kelly Montrose dead, Julian?\" I ask, standing over him, my hand holding the cigarette shaking. \"What happened to Kelly? Why is he dead?\"\\n\\n Julian looks at me and realizes something. Still staring at me he debates whether to say anything. \"Look, don\u0027t try and connect it all.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t a script,\" Julian says. \"It\u0027s not going to add up. Not everything\u0027s going to come together in the third act.\"\\n\\n \"What was Rip\u0027s connection to Kelly?\"\\n\\n \"At first it was about Kelly investing in a club and they had a ... falling-out.\"\\n\\n \"Over Rain?\"\\n\\n Julian shrugs. \"That was part of it, I guess.\"\\n\\n I try again: \"I just want to know what I\u0027m involved with. Just tell me.\"\\n\\n \"What you\u0027re involved with?\" Julian seems surprised. \"You\u0027re not involved in any of it. Maybe it feels like you are but you\u0027re not.\"\\n\\n \"Amanda Flew is Rain\u0027s roommate, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, she is,\" Julian says, confused. \"Didn\u0027t you know that?\"\\n\\n \"She drives a blue Jeep, right?\" I say. \"Why has she been following me?\"\\n\\n \"She left town. Mandy\u0027s not here anymore,\" Julian says. \"I don\u0027t know why she was following you.\" Pause. \"Are you sure it was her?\"\\n\\n \"And both of them were with Rip?\" I ask. \"Both Rain and Amanda had been with Rip?\"\\n\\n He sighs. \"When Rain and I took a break Rip started hitting on her ... and then, when she met Kelly, well, Rip started hanging out with Mandy,\" Julian says. \"And that didn\u0027t last, and then he tried to get back with Rain but ... that wasn\u0027t going to work.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-33.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
