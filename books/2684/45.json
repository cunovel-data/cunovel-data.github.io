I think he just wants to talk.\"\\n\\n \"He wants Rain,\" Julian says. \"That\u0027s what he really wants. And that\u0027s not going to happen.\"\\n\\n \"He gets it,\" I say. \"He just wants to talk to you about ... something. He just wants to, I don\u0027t know, clear things up.\" I\u0027m struggling to keep my voice steady. \"He wants reassurance ... \" I clear my throat and then calmly say: \"He thinks you know something that connects him to Kelly.\"\\n\\n Julian stares at me and says after a beat, \"That\u0027s not true.\"\\n\\n \"He knows that people think he wanted Kelly out of the way,\" I\u0027m saying.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just a dumb rumor,\" Julian says, but his voice has changed and something in the room shifts. \"Rip doesn\u0027t really give a f**k about me.\"\\n\\n \"Julian,\" I say, slowly moving toward him, \"he had you beaten up.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n I swallow. \"Because Rip told me.\"\\n\\n \"Bullshit.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Julian,\" I say, nodding as I move closer to him. \"It was Rip. Rip did that to you ... \"\\n\\n \"No he didn\u0027t.\" Julian waves me off. \"That was something else. That wasn\u0027t Rip. You\u0027re making that up.\"\\n\\n \"Look,\" I say, \"all I know is that part of the condition on taking the money is that he wants to see you. Tonight. Before you guys leave.\" I pause. \"Otherwise there\u0027s no deal.\"\\n\\n \"Why the f**k does he want to see me when I know he\u0027s pissed off? Why doesn\u0027t he just take the money?\" Julian asks this almost pleadingly. \"Don\u0027t you think I should probably stay the f**k away from him? Jesus, Clay.\"\\n\\n \"Because once I told him I\u0027d pay him back - \" I start.\\n\\n \"Why are you doing this?\" Julian looks at me and then almost automatically realizes why.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I say. \"I\u0027d do it for her,\" I say softly, pulling out my iPhone, and then trying to calm him down: \"What\u0027s he going to do to you? I\u0027ll be there. I\u0027ll be with you.\"\\n\\n I find Rip\u0027s contact info and send him a blank e-mail.\\n\\n Julian looks at me. He\u0027s changing his mind about something. \"You\u0027ve become friends with him? A month ago you told me he was a freak.\"\\n\\n The only thing I can do is counter with: \"Why did you go to Rip when you needed the money to pay back Blair?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t go to Rip,\" Julian says. \"Rip came to me. Because of Rain he came to me and offered to help me out in exchange for ... \" Julian pauses. \"I was trying to figure out another way to pay back Blair, but when Rip came to me it just seemed easier ... But I didn\u0027t go to Rip. He came to me. I didn\u0027t go to him.\"\\n\\n \"Wait, Julian. Hold on.\"\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m looking at the response I just received. Is he with you now?\\n\\n I text back: Give me the address.\\n\\n I wait, pretending to read something on the screen.\\n\\n \"Clay,\" Julian asks, walking toward me. \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n And then: You\u0027ll bring him here?\\n\\n An address in Los Feliz appears on the screen barely a second after I text back: yes.\\n\\n Julian calls Rain and I only hear his side of the conversation. It lasts a minute as he tries to calm her down. \"We don\u0027t know it was him,\" Julian says. \"Hey, chill out ... We don\u0027t know if he took the money.\" He pauses while pacing the room. \"Clay said - \" and then he has to stop. \"Calm down,\" he says, almost stunned by the ferocity of the voice coming over the phone. \"If you\u0027re so worried then confirm it with Rip,\" he says softly. \"Make sure it\u0027s happening.\" Finally Julian looks over at me and says, \"No, you don\u0027t need to talk to him\" and that\u0027s my cue to nod. \"He\u0027s helping us out,\" Julian says. Once Julian hangs up, my phone immediately starts vibrating in the pocket of the robe I\u0027m wearing and it\u0027s Rain and I ignore it.\\n\\n Julian stands in the bedroom doorway, drinking a bottle of water, watching as I get dressed. I\u0027m pulling on jeans, a T-shirt, a black hoodie. I\u0027m debating whether to give him another chance.\\n\\n \"Rip loaned you the money to pay Blair back?\" I ask. \"And then what happened?\"\\n\\n \"He only loaned part of it,\" Julian says. \"But this has nothing to do with the money. Rip\u0027s just using that as an excuse. It\u0027s not about the money.\" He sounds almost scornful. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-45.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
