Her name\u0027s Rain Turner. That\u0027s the girl you wanted to bring, right? When Julian broke it off with me she was the reason. They\u0027ve been together ever since.\" Again she pauses for effect. \"He\u0027s still with her.\"\n \"How ... do you know this?\" I ask. \"I thought you didn\u0027t talk to him.\"\n \"I don\u0027t talk to Julian,\" she says, \"but I know they\u0027re together.\"\n I throw the glass against the wall.\n Blair looks away, embarrassed.\n \"You\u0027re that upset over her? I mean how long have you even been with her?\" Blair asks, her voice cracking. \"A couple of weeks?\"\n Concentrating on the flower arrangement in the middle of the suite is my only hope of focusing while Blair continues.\n \"I made Trent take her on as a client because Julian asked me to, without telling me he was seeing her. It was a favor I did for him. I thought she was just a friend. Another actress who needed help ... I did it because ... \" She stops. \"Because I liked Julian.\"\n I\u0027m murmuring to myself. \"That\u0027s why she was at your house.\"\n Blair realizes something after I say this. \"You never asked her why she was there, did you?\" Another silence. \"Jesus, it\u0027s still all about you, isn\u0027t it? Didn\u0027t you ever wonder what the hell she was doing there?\" Blair\u0027s voice keeps climbing. \"Do you know anything about her except how she makes you feel?\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe any of this.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because ... she\u0027s with me.\"\n Finally, I stagger toward the door.\n \"Wait,\" Blair says quietly. \"I better leave first.\"\n \"What does it matter?\" I ask, wiping my face.\n \"Because I think I\u0027m being followed.\"\n I text Rain: If I don\u0027t hear from you I\u0027m going to make them give the part to someone else. In a matter of minutes I get a text from her. Hey Crazy, I\u0027m back! Let\u0027s hang. Xo.\n In my office, sitting at my desk pretending to work on a script, I\u0027m really watching Rain, who has just shown up, and she\u0027s tan and pacing the floor, holding a glass of ice with some tequila in it, chatting casually about how crazy her mother is and her younger stepbrother who\u0027s in the military and when she falls onto the lounge chair in the corner of the office it takes all the strength I have to get up and walk over to her and not say anything about Julian. She looks up at me and keeps talking, only lightly distracted, but when I don\u0027t answer a question she touches her knee against mine and then I reach for her arm and pull her off the chair and when she reminds me about the reservation at Dan Tana\u0027s I tell her, \"I want to f**k you first,\" and start pulling her toward the bedroom.\n \"Come on,\" she says. \"I\u0027m hungry. Let\u0027s go to Dan Tana\u0027s.\"\n \"I thought you didn\u0027t want to go to Dan Tana\u0027s,\" I say, pressing into her. \"I thought you wanted to go someplace else.\"\n \"I changed my mind.\"\n \"Why? Who didn\u0027t you want to see there?\"\n \"Can\u0027t we just hang?\"\n \"No,\" I say.\n \"Look,\" she says. \"Maybe after dinner? I just want to chill.\" She strokes my face and then kisses me lightly on the lips and then she pulls her arm away and walks out of the office. I follow her through the living room and into the kitchen, where she heads for the tequila bottle and does another shot.\n \"Who was in San Diego?\" I ask.\n \"What?\"\n \"Who was in San Diego?\" I ask again.\n \"My mother. I told you that about a hundred times.\"\n \"Who else?\"\n \"Stop it, Crazy,\" she says. \"Hey, did you talk to Jon and Mark?\"\n \"Maybe.\"\n \"Maybe?\" She makes a face. \"What does that mean?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-22.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: \n Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
