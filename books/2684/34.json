There are cars on Elevado watching this place at night. There are people breaking in and going through my stuff. I get texts warning me about shit and I don\u0027t even know what shit they\u0027re warning me about but I think they\u0027re all connected to ... \" And suddenly I can\u0027t say it: your girlfriend. All I can say is \"Don\u0027t lie to me. I know you\u0027re still together.\"\\n\\n Julian slowly offers a small and noncommittal shrug. \"Well, if you stop seeing her maybe the rest will stop.\" He considers something else. \"If you don\u0027t want to see her anymore and you don\u0027t want to help her, then maybe all of that stuff will stop.\" He reaches for the water again. \"Maybe this wasn\u0027t thought out enough. Maybe there were too many ... I don\u0027t know ... variables ... that I didn\u0027t know about.\"\\n\\n A long silence before I say, \"You\u0027re leaving something out.\"\\n\\n \"What am I leaving out?\" He seems genuinely curious.\\n\\n \"One of the variables.\"\\n\\n \"Which one?\" He almost seems afraid to ask this.\\n\\n \"I like her.\"\\n\\n Julian sighs and starts to sit up. \"Clay - \"\\n\\n \"And I don\u0027t really care what other shit is going down.\"\\n\\n \"Do you really like her, Clay?\" Julian asks sadly. \"Or do you like something else?\"\\n\\n \"What does that mean, Julian?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been through this before,\" he says, carefully choosing his words. \"You know what this town is like. What did you expect? You barely know her. She\u0027s an actress.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m listening to you? You\u0027re running an escort service and I\u0027m listening to you?\"\\n\\n Julian sighs again. \"I was just doing favors. It was small time. Come off it. Don\u0027t be so naive.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re pimping your girlfriend out and you\u0027re telling me shit like that?\"\\n\\n \"Okay, look, I can see where you\u0027re at. I can see where this is all going. I just wanted to say I\u0027m sorry.\" He gets up and leans on the back of the sectional for support. \"I should have known that you\u0027d react this way. I thought you would have found it, I don\u0027t know, fun ... that, y\u0027know, you\u0027d get something out of it and, well, she\u0027d get something out of it and you wouldn\u0027t take it so seriously.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why you were so interested in the movie, isn\u0027t it?\" I say. \"Because you wanted me to give your girlfriend a part?\"\\n\\n \"Well, yeah.\" Julian pauses. \"We thought it might work. But if you\u0027re not going to see her anymore we\u0027ll just call it quits.\"\\n\\n \"That might have to be adjusted.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027m seeing her tonight,\" I say.\\n\\n \"I know you are,\" Julian says. \"Because you\u0027re still going to help her, right?\"\\n\\n The last time Rain sees Amanda Flew is on the Sunday following the night when I stood outside of the apartment on Orange Grove and, according to Rain, Amanda spends that night in her room and everything is \"fine,\" though because of what I saw that night, I know everything was not \"fine,\" and that something had happened that was pushing Amanda out of town. Amanda is supposed to leave the next day to stay with Mike and Kyle in Palm Springs and just \"chill\" for a couple of weeks but because she sleeps late and is scattered by the reasons she has to leave L.A. she doesn\u0027t get out of the apartment on Orange Grove until after dark. Rain never wanted Amanda - a girl she has now described to me as \"too trusting\" - to make this drive alone, and definitely not at night, and definitely not with twenty thousand dollars in cash in one of the gym bags she\u0027s carrying, but Amanda insists to the point where she\u0027s soon threatening not to go at all, so Rain and the two guys in Palm Springs tell Amanda that the only way this will work is if Amanda makes contact with them every ten minutes whether it\u0027s with Rain or with Mike and Kyle at the house in the desert, and Amanda agrees and leaves Orange Grove at 8:45 and doesn\u0027t call Rain until she\u0027s passing through downtown L.A. at 9:15. After this initial call things seem to fall apart fairly quickly.\\n\\n From about 9:30 until 10:00 Amanda doesn\u0027t answer her phone. A call is made to the house in Palm Springs around 10:15 and Amanda sounds calm and tells Mike and Kyle that she\u0027s going to be later than she thought, that she\u0027s meeting someone at a coffee shop in Riverside but it\u0027s cool, and not to tell Rain. Apparently, neither Rain nor Mike nor Kyle thinks this is cool and Mike immediately starts driving to the coffee shop in Riverside. The next call to Kyle is at eleven and Amanda says she\u0027s not in Riverside anymore but has driven to Temecula. Kyle calls Mike and warns him that she\u0027s not in Riverside, and Amanda doesn\u0027t answer any of Rain\u0027s calls or texts - This is totally f**ked, one of them reads, you\u0027re going to die - and an argument ensues about calling 911 and then is quickly dropped, and according to a waitress Mike talks to at the coffee shop in Riverside, Amanda had met two men at the entrance of the coffee shop and Amanda even kissed one of them on the cheek, though the waitress couldn\u0027t get a clear view of the one Amanda had kissed. The last call is made an hour later and Amanda is explaining to Kyle that she\u0027ll see him tomorrow, even after Kyle has warned her that Mike\u0027s leaving Riverside and on his way to Temecula. At this point someone takes the phone from Amanda and listens as Kyle starts shouting for Amanda to tell him exactly where she is, and Kyle can hear Amanda in the background whining, \"Come on, stop it, give me back the phone, come on.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-34.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
