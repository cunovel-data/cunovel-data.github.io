I\u0027m staring at a wall, at one of Cindy Sherman\u0027s untitled film stills, when I feel the phone vibrate in my hand and the question is answered. No, this is someone different. A group of guys booked a table at a new lounge on La Cienega and I allow myself to be invited as I\u0027m waiting for a cab and they\u0027re waiting for their cars in front of Bar Marmont and I\u0027m staring up at the parapets of the Chateau and thinking about the year I lived there, after I left the El Royale and before I moved into the Doheny Plaza - the AA meetings on Robertson and Melrose, the twenty-dollar margaritas from room service, the teenager I f**ked on the couch in #44 - when I see Rip Millar pull up in a convertible Porsche. I hide back in the shadows as Rip shambles toward the hotel clutching a girl in a baby-doll dress by the wrist, and one of the guys calls out something to him and Rip turns his head and makes a sound that passes for laughter and then says in a singsong voice, \"Enjoy yourselves.\" I started with champagne tonight so the lucidity hasn\u0027t worn off and the dead zone isn\u0027t bleeding forward yet and I\u0027m in someone\u0027s Aston Martin and he\u0027s bragging about a whore he keeps in his Abbot Kinney condo just east of the Venice canals and another one in a suite at the Huntley. I murmur the hotel\u0027s ad line (\"Sea and be seen\") as we\u0027re passing the limousines and gangs of paparazzi outside of Koi and STK, and standing at the curb in front of Reveal I\u0027m staring at the cypress trees looming against the night sky until the two other guys from the party at the Chateau pull up to the valet and I don\u0027t really know anyone so everything is comfortable - Wayne\u0027s a producer with a deal at Lionsgate that\u0027s going nowhere and Kit is an entertainment lawyer at a firm in Beverly Hills. Banks, who drove me, is a creator of reality shows. When I ask Banks why he chose this place, Reveal, he says, \"Rip Millar recommended it to me. Rip got us in.\" Inside, the place is packed, vaguely Peruvian, voices bouncing off the high ceiling, the amplified sounds of a waterfall splashing somewhere compete with the Beck song booming throughout the lounge. As the owner leads us to our table, two paper-thin girls stop me at the entrance to the dining room and remind me about a night at the Mercer in New York last October. I didn\u0027t sleep with either one of them - we were just doing coke and watching The Hills - but the guys become enticed. Someone mentions Meghan Reynolds and I tense up. \"It\u0027s interesting how much play you get out of this,\" Kit says, once we\u0027re seated at a table in the center of the room. \"Isn\u0027t it exhausting?\" \"That\u0027s a question that contains a lot of other questions,\" I say. \"Have you ever heard the joke about the Polish actress?\" Banks asks. \"She came to Hollywood and f**ked the writer.\" He pauses, glances at me. \"I guess it\u0027s not so funny.\" \"Be in my screenplay and I\u0027ll make you a star,\" Kit says in a baby voice. \"Clay obviously doesn\u0027t underestimate the desperation factor in this town,\" Wayne says. \"In a place where there\u0027s so much bitterness,\" Banks says with a light touch, \"anything is possible, right?\" \"Possible? Hey, I just think it\u0027s kind of unbelievable.\" Kit shrugs. \"I think Clay is very pragmatic,\" Banks says. \"What\u0027s unbelievable is clinging to a fading belief in love, Kit.\" He pauses. \"But that\u0027s just me.\" \"I mean, you\u0027re a nice-looking guy for your age,\" Kit says to me, \"but you don\u0027t really have the clout.\" Banks considers this. \"I guess people find this out sooner or later, right?\" \"Yeah, but they\u0027re always replaced, Banks,\" Wayne says. \"On a daily basis there\u0027s a whole new army of the retarded eager to be defiled.\" Chapter 4 \"You guys don\u0027t need to remind me that I\u0027m not really a player ... but I can be useful, I guess.\" I\u0027m sighing, staying loose. \"Just always make sure you have some kind of producer credit. Stay friendly with the director. Get to know casting agents. It all helps the cause.\" I pause for effect before adding, \"I\u0027m very patient.\" \"It\u0027s a plan,\" Kit says. \"It\u0027s very, um, subtle.\" \"It\u0027s a philosophy,\" someone else says. \"It\u0027s just how I roll.\" Wayne looks up, taking note of my uninflected voice. \"I guess it kind of makes sense. You\u0027ve been involved in some high-profile hits,\" Wayne mutters, \"for what it\u0027s worth.\" Kit leans forward. \"It\u0027s just not a very good way to make friends.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-13.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
