Rip\u0027s visage calmly scrutinizes me. \"I thought you spent most of your time in New York.\" \"I mean I\u0027m back and forth.\" \"I heard you met a friend of mine.\" \"Who?\" \"Yeah,\" he says with a dreadful grin, his mouth filled with teeth that are too white. \"I heard you really hit it off.\" I just want to leave. The fear is swarming. The black BMW suddenly materializes. A valet holds the door open. The horrible face forces me to glance anywhere but at him. \"Rip, I\u0027ve gotta go.\" I gesture helplessly at my car. \"Let\u0027s have dinner while you\u0027re back,\" Rip says. \"I\u0027m serious.\" \"Okay, but I really have to go now.\" \"Descansado,\" he tells me. \"What does that mean?\" \"Descansado,\" Rip says. \"It means \u0027take it easy,\u0027\" he whispers, clutching the child next to him. \"Yeah?\" \"It means relax.\" It happens again. While waiting for the girl to come over I\u0027m reaching into the refrigerator for a bottle of white wine when I notice that a Diet Coke\u0027s missing and that cartons and jars have been rearranged and I\u0027m telling myself this isn\u0027t possible, and after looking around the condo for other clues maybe it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s not until I\u0027m staring at the Christmas tree that I finally hear the bones tapping against the windowpane: one strand of lights not connected to the other strands has been unplugged leaving a jagged black streak within the lit tree. This is the detail that announces: you\u0027ve been warned. This is the detail that says: they want you to know. I drink a glass of vodka, and then I drink another. Who is this? I text. A minute later I receive an answer from a blocked number that annihilates whatever peace the alcohol brought on. I promised someone I wouldn\u0027t tell you. I\u0027m walking through the Grove to have lunch with Julian, who texts me that he\u0027s at a table next to the Pinkberry in the Farmers Market. I thought you said I was a total mistake, he typed back when I e-mailed him earlier. Maybe you are but I still want to see you was my reply. I keep ignoring the feeling of being followed. I keep ignoring the texts from the blocked number telling me I\u0027m watching you. I tell myself the texts are coming from the dead boy whose condo I bought. It\u0027s easier that way. This morning the girl I called over when I got home from the W Hotel was asleep in the bedroom. I woke her up and told her she had to get out because the maid was coming. At the casting sessions it was all boys and though I wasn\u0027t exactly bored I didn\u0027t need to be there, and songs constantly floating in the car keep commenting on everything neutral encased within the windshield\u0027s frame ( ... one time you were blowing young ruffians ... sung over the digital billboard on Sunset advertising the new Pixar movie) and the fear builds into a muted fury and then has no choice but to melt away into a simple and addictive sadness. Daniel\u0027s arm around Meghan Reynolds\u0027s waist sometimes blocks the view at traffic lights. And then it\u0027s the blond girl on the veranda. It\u0027s almost always her image now that deflects everything. You knew that Meghan Reynolds was with Daniel,\" I say. \"I saw them last night. You knew I\u0027d been with her over the summer. You also knew she\u0027s with Daniel now.\" \"Everyone knows,\" Julian says, confused. \"So what?\" \"I didn\u0027t,\" I say. \"Everyone? What does that mean?\" \"It means I guess you weren\u0027t paying attention.\" I move the conversation to the reason I\u0027m here in the Farmers Market with him. I ask him a question about Blair. There\u0027s a longish pause. Julian\u0027s usual affability gets washed away with that question. \"We were involved, I guess,\" he finally says. \"You and Blair?\" \"Yeah.\" \"She doesn\u0027t want you to talk to me,\" I say. \"She warned me, in fact, not to.\" \"Blair asked you not to speak to me? She warned you?\" He sighs. \"She must really be hurt.\" \"Why is she so hurt?\" \"Didn\u0027t she tell you why?\" he asks. \"No,\" I say. \"I didn\u0027t ask.\" Chapter 3 Julian gives me a quick glance tinged with worry, and then it\u0027s gone. \"Because I started seeing someone else and it was hard for her when I broke it off.\" \"Who was the girl?\" \"She\u0027s an actress. She works in this lounge on La Cienega.\" \"Did Trent know?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-9.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
