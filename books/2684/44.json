{"id":69573,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"I avoid everything. Everything goes quiet once the video is posted and yet no one concedes that the video is real. There are actual arguments about its authenticity. People think these are outtakes from a horror movie Amanda shot the year before and not even the makers of the horror movie can stop this new narrative from taking shape. I order two bottles of gin from Gil Turner\u0027s and once they\u0027re delivered I make plans to leave for Vegas and reserve a suite at the Mandalay Bay but then cancel it even though I\u0027ve already packed two bags, and the moon rises over the city and for the first time in what seems like years there are no cars on Elevado Street tonight, and in a warm bath I think about calling a girl who I know would come over but then I\u0027m just lying in bed with the Bose headphones, drinking from the second bottle of gin, and then I\u0027m dreaming about the dead boy again and now he\u0027s standing in the bedroom, moving softly toward the bed, whispering for me to come join him in his endless sleep, and in the dream the palm trees are taller and bending in the wind outside the sliding glass wall of 1508 and when I see the bruises on his face from where I struck the boy in the previous dream the phone starts ringing, waking me up, but not before the boy whispers Save me ...\n What did Rip tell you?\"\n It\u0027s Julian and I\u0027m just waking up and it\u0027s late afternoon, the sky dimming into dusk. \"What?\" I clear my throat, and ask it again. \"What?\"\n \"I know you saw him,\" he says. \"I know he\u0027s looking for me. What did he want?\"\n I barely manage to sit up. \"I think ... in terms of ... what\u0027s going on - \"\n Julian stops me automatically. \"There\u0027s nothing that\u0027s going to connect him to that.\" The following silence confirms that we both know what he\u0027s referencing: Amanda.\n \"What are you doing?\" I ask. \"Where are you?\"\n \"We\u0027re leaving tonight,\" Julian says, downplaying the urgency in his voice.\n \"Who\u0027s leaving?\"\n \"Me and Rain,\" Julian says. \"We\u0027re leaving tonight.\"\n \"Julian,\" I start and then try and figure out what I want to say to him but I\u0027m on the verge of tears and nothing comes out and I keep clutching the sheets bundled around me and they\u0027re damp with sweat and for the first time it\u0027s real: she\u0027s actually leaving with him and not me.\n \"What?\" he asks impatiently. \"What is it?\"\n \"I need to see you,\" I say. \"Come over. I want to help you.\"\n \"What?\" he asks, annoyed. \"Why? Help me with what?\"\n \"Rip wants to make a deal,\" I say. \"He wants this whole thing over with.\"\n There\u0027s a pause. \"And what do you have to do with this?\"\n \"I know everything,\" I say. \"I\u0027m going to make it happen.\" I pause before saying, \"I\u0027ll pay him back.\" Finally, though I can barely swallow I say, \"I\u0027m going to make this end.\"\n Julian sends a text two hours later from somewhere close to the Doheny Plaza. Are you alone? And then: Is it safe to come over? I\u0027ve sobered up as much as I can when I text back: Yes. When I call Rain there\u0027s no answer and because Rain doesn\u0027t pick up I dial another number and Rip takes my call.\n Someone\u0027s been following me,\" Julian says, brushing past me into the condo. \"I took a cab. I\u0027m going to need a ride. You\u0027re going to have to drive me back to Westwood.\" He turns and notices that I\u0027m wearing a robe. He notices the glass of gin I\u0027m holding. He looks at me. \"Are you okay? Are you capable of that?\"\n \"Where\u0027s Rain?\" I ask. \"I mean, how is she?\"\n \"Don\u0027t bother.\" Julian walks to the window wall and looks down, craning his neck as if scanning for someone.\n \"I hear, um, the audition went well - \"\n \"Stop it,\" he says, turning around.\n \"She has a shot at the part - \"\n \"It\u0027s over, Clay,\" he says. \"That\u0027s over. Just don\u0027t.\"\n \"That\u0027s not true, Julian. Hey - \"\n \"I want to know why you\u0027ve been hanging out with Rip.\"\n \"He, um, wants to talk to you,\" I say. \"He just wants to talk to you now that I\u0027ve agreed to pay him - \"\n \"No, he doesn\u0027t,\" Julian cuts me off.\n \"Yeah, he really does ... now that ... \" I\u0027m trying not to stammer. \"Don\u0027t you get it? I\u0027m paying him back.\"\n Julian\u0027s stance changes: he takes a step toward me, then stops. \"How did you know about that?\" he says. \"The money, I mean. Who told you?\"\n \"Trent did,\" I say. \"It was Trent.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-44.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: \n Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
