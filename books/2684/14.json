{"id":69543,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Banks closes his menu when the owner leans down and whispers something to him. Josh Hartnett, who was going to play one of the sons in The Listeners and then bailed, walks over and crouches by the bamboo chair and we have a brief exchange about another script of mine that he\u0027s been circling, but his apologetic lack of commitment only makes me seem more remote than I\u0027m actually feeling. Though I know that what he\u0027s saying isn\u0027t true I smile and agree anyway. Austere plates of raw fish start arriving, along with ice-cold bottles of premium sake, and then the guys make fun of a very successful shark movie I wrote, and the series about witches I created that ran for two seasons on Showtime, then Wayne starts telling a story about an actress who stalked him until he cast her in a movie about a monster that looked like a talking beanbag. Just as the owner sends the table a complimentary dessert - an elaborate plate of sugared doughnuts drizzled with caramel - the night begins sliding into its last act. I\u0027m scanning the room when I see the cascade of blond hair, the wide-open pale blue eyes, the dumb smile that offsets her beauty while at the same time making it more pronounced: she\u0027s on the phone at the hostess stand. And then I realize it\u0027s time to cross the line.\\n\\n I knew you were here,\" Rain says.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you say something?\" I ask, sobering up immediately in her presence. \"You could have sent over a few cocktails.\"\\n\\n \"I assumed you guys were already wasted when you came in.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you say hello?\"\\n\\n \"I was seating a table,\" she says. \"Plus the owner likes to impress Banks.\"\\n\\n \"So, this is where you work?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she purrs. \"Glamorous, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"You seem happy.\"\\n\\n \"I am,\" she says. \"I\u0027m almost afraid of how happy I am.\"\\n\\n \"Come on, don\u0027t be afraid.\"\\n\\n She mimics a little girl. \"Well, I could always be happier.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" I say contemplatively. \"I got your pics.\"\\n\\n When I get back to the Doheny Plaza, waiting for Rain to come over after she finishes her shift, I sit in my office checking Rain\u0027s IMDb page again, studying it for clues. There are no credits for the last two years, stopping abruptly after \"Christine\" in a Michael Bay movie and \"Stacy\u0027s Friend\" in an episode of CSI: Miami and then I\u0027m filling in the missing pieces, the things she doesn\u0027t want anyone to know. The credits begin when Rain must have been eighteen. I\u0027m doing the math by guessing - the date of birth has been shaved by at least a couple years and I\u0027m putting her age at probably twenty-two or twenty-three. She was at the University of Michigan (cheerleader for the Wolverines, \"studying medicine\") but no dates are given (if she attended at all) so it\u0027s hard to confirm exactly how old she is. Though Rain would say it doesn\u0027t matter. Rain would argue that just the idea of her in a cheerleader\u0027s uniform is enough. But the fact that there are no photos of her as a cheerleader causes more whispers in that darkly lit hallway, and the addition of \"studying medicine\" makes the whispering even louder.\\n\\n The most recent information: Rain posted a month ago that she was listed as one of L.A. Confidential\u0027s most eligible singles in the December issue, and so is - I notice unsurprisingly enough when I pull up the magazine online - Amanda Flew, the actress I hit on at JFK and who texted me during Rain\u0027s audition. The photo of Rain in L.A. Confidential is the same headshot that obviously is Rain\u0027s preferred image of herself: staring blankly at the camera so that her perfect features can speak for themselves, but there\u0027s the beginning of a slight grin she almost manages to make suggestive of an intelligence that the cle**age and her career choice otherwise argue against. And it doesn\u0027t matter if any intelligence actually exists because it\u0027s really about the look, the idea of a girl like this, the promise of sex. It\u0027s all about the lure. The MySpace page reveals nothing to me at first except that her favorite band is the Fray. \"How to Save a Life\" plays when you open the page. I\u0027m about to scan it when I get a text from a blocked number.\\n\\n I look down at the phone on my desk.\\n\\n The screen says: I\u0027m watching you.\\n\\n Instead of ignoring it and turning away, I text back: Where am I?\\n\\n Within the time it takes another text to arrive I\u0027ve already walked to the kitchen and poured myself a glass of vodka. When I reach for the phone back in my office I freeze.\\n\\n You\u0027re at home.\\n\\n I hold the phone away from my face and glance out the window.\\n\\n And then I text back: No I\u0027m not.\\n\\n It takes a minute before the phone flashes a glow that tells me I have a response.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-14.html","bookId":2684,"book":{"id":2684,"title":"Imperial Bedrooms","description":"Storyline: Twenty-five years on from \"Less Than Zero\", we pick up again with \"Clay\". \\n In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with \"Less Than Zero\", his \u0027extraordinarily accomplished first novel\u0027 (\"New Yorker\"), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. \\n But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he\u0027s become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he\u0027s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he\u0027s still a bisexual philanderer. \\n Then there\u0027s Clay\u0027s childhood friend, Julian - who\u0027s now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he\u0027s forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/imperial-bedrooms.jpg","author":"Bret Easton Ellis","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:03 AM"}}
