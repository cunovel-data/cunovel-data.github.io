What a delight! Come, girls—and Duval. We will leave the two of them alone.”\n Emele hugged Elle again. “I have so much I wish to speak about, but it will wait. I am ever so glad you are home, Elle,” she said before getting up and following Bernadine from the room.\n “Come on, Duval. You lost the battle before you even waged it,” Heloise told the barber-physician.\n “But Mademoiselle Elle really should been cared for,” Duval complained.\n “I am certain His Worshipness will see to it,” Heloise dryly said.\n The barber-physician grumbled—gathering up his medical instruments. He bowed deeply at Elle. “Mademoiselle Elle, allow me to voice my happiness that you have returned. I expect I shall see you later today,” he said before leaving.\n Heloise, who was right behind him, paused in the doorway. “Elle, welcome home,” she said, closing the door before Elle could reply. Elle could hear the dour housekeeper speak through the door. “Bernadine, listening at the doorway will not count for giving them privacy. Move along, His Mystifying has earned an audience with the girl.”\n All was quiet for a few moments, and Elle took the chance to stand—grateful to find that while she slept Emele had apparently wrangled her into one of Elle’s plainest dresses.\n As Elle stretched the door clicked open, and Severin, dressed in a dark green waistcoat, entered. He shut the door behind him, briefly leaning against it. “Elle,” he said.\n “Hello, Severin.”\n “How do you feel?” Severin asked, approaching Elle with glittering eyes.\n Elle swallowed and reached for a chair to support herself. “Fine. A little addled. I didn’t recognize the room,” Elle said, looking down at the chair and realizing the ornate arms and legs were leafed with real gold.\n “Do you like it?” Severin inquired.\n “It’s very… elaborate,” Elle said.\n Severin chuckled. “You find it gaudy, don’t you?”\n “Maybe a little,” Elle grinned. Her eyes went wide and she grabbed for her hidden pouch. It wasn’t there! Elle whirled around and spotted it on a tea table set next to her bed. She swiped it and removed rolled up papers from inside of it, breathing in relief. “Here—I was supposed to take them to the palace but I’m sure you’ll see His Highness Prince Lucien before I will.”\n “What is it?” Severin asked, unrolling the papers.\n “The reason I went to the assassin’s guild. It’s the contract Arcainia made with them for your assassination. You can use it to barter with Arcainia. If it is made known that they contracted the guild to kill you their country will be ruined,” Elle grinned.\n Severin studied for the papers for a moment. “Why? Why risk your life for this?”\n “They were going to keep after you, Severin. I took the mission because I wanted to stop them. Arcainia will cancel the contract if you lean on them politically now that you have proof.”\n Severin set the papers aside and reached out, grazing Elle’s cheekbone with his thumb. “I am sorry, Elle, for the pain I caused you.”\n “I lied to you. I should have told you the truth about who I was.”\n “Yes,” Severin agreed. “But I should have given you the chance to explain yourself. I was confused and grieved.”\n “You thought I was your brother’s spy.”\n “No, I thought you didn’t love me.”\n Elle looked up into Severin’s blazing eyes. “What changed your mind?”\n Severin ruefully smiled. “An enchantress told me I was being a dolt.”\n “The one that helped you with the curse?”\n “The one and the same. She explained to me that I misunderstood the conditions of breaking my curse. In order for it to break a woman had to fall in love with me.”\n Elle’s cheeks burned and she turned her back to Severin, inexplicably embarrassed. “I thought you told me as much before. I certainly told you so before your brother arrived.”\n Severin chuckled. “I did not finish. A woman had to fall in love with me, and I had to fall in love with her.”\n Elle froze as she replayed Severin’s words in her mind. She blinked, still shocked and disbelieving when Severin stood behind her and slipped his arms around her waist.\n “I am sorry, Elle, for my harsh words,” Severin said pulling Elle against his chest. “Do you forgive me?”\n “Yes. Do you forgive me for lying?” Elle asked, propping her head against his chest.\n Severin leaned forward to kiss her cheek. “Yes. I love you, Elle.”\n “I love you, Severin.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-and-the-beast-timeless-fairy-tales-1/page-70.html","bookId":1808,"book":{"id":1808,"title":"Beauty and the Beast (Timeless Fairy Tales #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Once upon a time Elle made a mistake.
