{"id":83869,"no":58,"title":"Page 58","content":"The courier pushed his scarf down his face and bobbed forward in a quick bow. “I apologize, Your Highness. I have an important communication from your brother, Prince Lucien,” the courier said, trembling as he held out a sealed letter. Severin took the letter and inspected the seal before ripping it open, glancing at the courier when he retreated several feet down the hallway before reading the letter. My Dear Brother, I fear I have bad news to share. Two of my Rangers captured another spy from Arcainia. This spy was in possession of a coded message addressed to the assassins’ guild of Verglas. The guild has been hired to eliminate you. Of course the message does not say this outright—and when we confront Arcainia I have no doubt they will claim they intercepted the orders and would have informed us if we had not detained their spy. We do not know the date or time the assassins will attack, but I expect it will be soon. I am sending an army squad to Chanceux Chateau. They will arrive a few hours after you receive this letter. Severin crumpled the letter, unable to read the rest. Severin knew the communication should send him scurrying to work—checking the defenses of the chateau, warning the servants, preparing for the army—but all of Severin’s thoughts and concerns focused on one thing: Elle. He had to get her out. “Burke, take this thing to the kitchens, see that he is warmed and given nourishment,” Severin said, indicating the frightened courier. “Alert Emele that Elle will be leaving today and needs to be dressed for riding in this weather. Now. Send Marc to my study immediately, tell Heloise to bring me the treasury accounts, and have Oliver saddle Fidele and a fresh horse for the messenger,” Severin growled before he holed himself up in his study. He worked quickly, recognizing that he may as well take care of Elle first so he could concentrate on the remaining tasks. He needed to see that everyone in his household would be safe. He had no doubts the assassins would leave his servants alone—if they did make an attempt it would be quick, trying to off Severin and disappear before anyone noticed. Severin knew his servants would support him, and he welcomed their help. But Elle… he would take no chances with Elle. Elle would have to leave. Marc arrived immediately. Severin explained the situation to him, and the two men studied a detailed map of the chateau grounds, determining where to station the soldiers when they arrived. Heloise entered and left after arguing via a slate with Severin for some minutes. She returned, carrying a leather pack and a sour expression, but Severin ignored it and took the pack before he swept off to the chateau main hall where Elle—wearing enough clothes to comfortably ride out a blizzard—stood with her hands on her hips in the middle of a gaggle of servants. “Severin, what is going on?” Elle asked. “I was in the middle of reading a delightful book—anyone who tells you I was sleeping is mistaken—when Emele wrenched me into my room and dressed me for mountain climbing.” “You are returning to the palace,” Severin said. “What?” “Today you return to Noyers,” Severin said, looking to Burke. “Has the courier rested?” Sufficiently enough. “Bring him out here,” Severin said. “You’re sending me home,” Elle calmly said. Although her tone was amiable Severin could guess her thoughts. She thought he was abandoning her. Severin turned to Bernadine, raising his brows at her. Bernadine nodded in approval before she clapped her hands and bustled off, drawing all the servants—even Emele—far enough from Severin and Elle to give them a small measure of privacy. Severin drew closer to Elle. He cupped her cheek with his hand—which dwarfed her head. “Temporarily,” he said, his voice low. “I am freeing you. Present this to whatever steward holds your bond—I’m positive it is more than enough to buy your indenture,” Severin said, presenting the pack to Elle, briefly peeling it open so Elle could see the gold coins inside. It was a lord’s ransom. Unless the crown had really taken Elle to task, she could buy at least three indentures with the money. “Severin,” Elle said, staring at the money with wide eyes. “This is too much. I cannot allow you to do this.” Severin cracked a smile, happy he had not been wrong about Elle. She was not enthralled with money—his money in particular. “It is not something I need your permission for. I want you to be free, Elle. Take it.” Elle twisted her mouth in a slant, so Severin plunged on before she could argue, “Finish up your business at the palace—make sure they give you the paperwork for your servanthood and be certain that they seal them. Gather your possessions and return to your father and sisters,” Severin hesitated for a few moments. “Or come back here.” “Why now? Why so sudden, Severin. Are you hiding something?” “No.” “Then why the big hurry?” Elle asked, folding her arms in front of her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-and-the-beast-timeless-fairy-tales-1/page-58.html","bookId":1808,"book":{"id":1808,"title":"Beauty and the Beast (Timeless Fairy Tales #1)","description":"Storyline: Once upon a time Elle made a mistake.
