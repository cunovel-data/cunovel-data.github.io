{"id":83865,"no":54,"title":"Page 54","content":"To find the answer to this predicament, Elle keenly studied Severin. The results were rather unfortunate. Elle observed that Severin was surprisingly calm tempered. He was difficult to anger—excluding matters of rubbing leaves and Jock—and after one got past his rocky exterior he was thoughtful and gentle. Some might see his sense of humor as being ill mannered in its sourness, but Elle found his remarks not only diverting but true. His loyalty was bottomless, which surely meant he was trustworthy, and Elle was willing to admit that she admired the guardianship he seemed to extend over all he held dear. He was proud, yes, but not unduly so considering his social standing and intelligence. Perhaps his only real fault that Elle found aggravating was his tendency to dote on his brother and work at all hours of the day. If love was as Heloise said, and was about finding a partner to go through the tribulations and delights of life, whatever woman snared Prince Severin would be lucky indeed. In fact, Elle was likely to be jealous of her. Elle realized what she was thinking and paused. “Fantastic,” she said before glaring at Severin, mad at him for the nobility of his temperament. “What?” Severin asked, not looking up from his work. “Nothing,” Elle said, her voice was flat as she removed her eyes from the prince and stared across the library. Thanks to her regrettable curiosity, Elle was forced to admit that she was the kind of woman who would fall in love—real love—with Severin. And, even more regrettably, it seemed that she already had fallen for him. Elle glared at Severin again in a rare show of rage. She had been perfectly happy before her realization. Why did Severin have to be so likeable? Surely this was his fault. “What have I done?” Severin asked. Elle froze, afraid he had read her thoughts. “What?” “You are glaring at me like a gargoyle. What did I do to anger you?” Severin asked, making a notation on a map. Elle looked away. “Nothing.” Severin snorted in amusement and disbelief. Elle folded her arms across her belly and thought. Out of all people why would it be Prince Severin to catch her fancy where no one else had? The notion was ridiculous considering what he had done to her family. The situation was so ironic it made Elle laugh out loud. “Do you need something? Tea perhaps?” Severin asked, taking a book off the top of the tower of manuscripts at his elbow. “No,” Elle said. She was mistaken, that had to be it. She wasn’t in love with Severin. It was just because Heloise had put the mad notion in her head. “Elle.” Elle’s thoughts stopped when Severin slid a furry, thick finger under her chin, tilting it so she had to look at him. “Are you certain you are feeling well? Do you need to be aired out?” he asked, his deep voice colored with a faint tease. Nope. She wasn’t mistaken. “I’m fine, Severin, but thank you for your concern,” Elle said, giving the prince a small smile. Satisfied, Severin dropped Elle’s chin and returned to his work. Elle watched him for a few moments, her smile growing larger and softer. Perhaps it was ridiculous, but Elle couldn’t help but think she couldn’t have chosen a better man to fall for. Elle froze when she realized what her affection meant. Because she loved him she could break Severin’s curse! …But that would mean the end of this. Severin would never love a commoner, and as soon as the curse was broken he would return to the palace and to his brother. If he didn’t forget about her he would likely find out what she really was, and then there was no chance he would love her. Elle leaned over the table, sheltering her eyes with her hands. She was startled when she felt something on her back. It took her a moment to realize it was Severin, running a hand through her loose hair. He did so almost unconsciously. He glanced at Elle for a moment to gravely study her before he again looked back at his book, still running a hand through her hair. “I will have to do it,” Elle whispered. Severin’s ears flicked, but he said nothing. Elle knew in her heart that she couldn’t leave Severin cursed because of her selfishness. She loved him—and all of his servants—so much that she wanted them to be free. Even if it meant she would lose them. But she didn’t have to break it today, or even tomorrow. There was still time to enjoy her stay at Chanceux Chateau. She could treasure her moments with Severin and her friends among his staff. Elle laid her head down on the table and closed her eyes as Severin continued to stroke her hair, lulling her off to sleep. Elle was pulled from her slumber by someone shaking her awake. It was early in the morning, the sun was only hinting at rising and the room was chilly as Elle had neglected to close the window after her colleague checked in with her in the late evening hours. “What is it, Emele?” Elle asked, propping herself up on her elbows.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-and-the-beast-timeless-fairy-tales-1/page-54.html","bookId":1808,"book":{"id":1808,"title":"Beauty and the Beast (Timeless Fairy Tales #1)","description":"Storyline: Once upon a time Elle made a mistake.
