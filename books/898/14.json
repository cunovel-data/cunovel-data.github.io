{"id":36480,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII FRIENDS","content":"A week later the jails in the town were emptied, and the prisoners taken to the race-course. Some rough wooden huts had been erected for the men, and the officers were to use the grand-stand. \"At least we shall have a good view from the top,\" one of the officers laughed. \"We shall see our fellows coming a long way off, and the bombardment of the forts, which will, I expect, be the first thing done. I hope that if the Boers fight they will make their last stand well away from the town. It would be maddening if there were to be a battle going on before our eyes and we not able to help.\" The strictness of the watch was in no way relaxed. Men constantly paraded the enclosure, which was formed of strong palisades. Others kept watch outside, where several ranges of barbed wire, to which empty tins were attached in such a way as to make a clatter at the slightest motion, seemed to render it impossible to get out without giving the alarm, even if the palisade were scaled. The time passed heavily, in spite of the efforts of the officers to amuse themselves. With make-shift stumps, bats, and balls they played cricket,[Pg 228] and the men in their part of the grounds did the same. They ran races, had high and wide jumps, played rounders, and did their best to keep up their spirits, but it was heavy work. The subject of the war was avoided as much as possible. It was maddening to know that fierce battles might be going on while they had lost all opportunity of sharing in them, and that when their friends, on their return, asked what share they had taken in the fighting, they could only reply that they were captured in one of the first fights and had seen nothing of the war afterwards. Ten days after they had been moved, one of the guards, as he sauntered past Yorke, coughed, not in a natural way, but as if to call his attention. Yorke looked round with apparent carelessness, as other guards might have their eye upon him. The man passed on without looking at him, but Yorke had difficulty in restraining a shout of delight when he recognized Hans. At first he could scarcely believe his eyes, but as the man lounged away, he recognized the figure beyond the shadow of doubt. He sat down upon the ground, took out his pipe and filled it, and when Hans again came past he asked him for a light. \"Where is your room, Master Yorke?\" Hans asked, as he fumbled in his pocket. \"It is at the other side of the house—the door nearest to the right-hand corner looking at it from here.\" \"I shall want time to think it out, Master Yorke. I only got taken on to-day. I will speak to you again to-morrow.\" So, striking a match and handing it to Yorke, Hans went away. Yorke felt that great caution must be used in speaking to Hans for as a new hand he might be watched for a time to see that he did not communicate with the prisoners. He lay back on the ground, pulled his hat forward as if to shade his face, and tried to think things over. Even now he could scarcely believe it possible that Hans could have travelled all the way from the Modder to Pretoria. He knew[Pg 229] how warmly the faithful fellow was attached to him, but not for a moment, while thinking over every conceivable way of escape, had it occurred to him that Hans would have come to his relief. Hans was a slow thinker, and he should not have given him credit for his undertaking such an enterprise; and even now that he had succeeded in making the journey and in getting himself engaged as a guard, he felt sure that he could not have the slightest idea as to what his next step should be. Getting up after a time, he went back to the room where he and eight officers slept. It had formerly been an office of some sort, and the outside door opened directly into it. Hitherto he had not examined the lock, for the palisade and the wire fences beyond it offered such impregnable obstacles, that the mere question of getting in and out of the room was of secondary importance. He now saw that there would be no great difficulty in shooting the bolt of the lock on the inside, but there were strong staples with a bar and padlock outside. These had evidently been put on only when it was decided to transform the grand-stand into a prison. His pocket-book had not been taken from him; it had a pencil attached, and he now wrote: I was delighted to see you. Even with your help it will be very difficult for me to make an escape. Of course, nothing whatever can be done before you happen to be on night guard and be posted near my door. I can force the bolt of the lock inside. There is a padlock outside, and you will either require a file to cut through the staple, or a strong steel bar with which you could wrench it off; but the file would be the easier. With a short rope I could climb the palisade, but the difficulty is the barbed wire outside. I will think over what can best be done with that, and will let you know. Of course I shall want a disguise to put on if I escape; it must be a very dark night when we attempt it. I have no money; have you any? [Pg 230] Having torn out the leaf and folded it up small, he went out again, strolled down to the palisade, and looked through it at the wires with their pendent tins. \"It would be an awful job to get over them even without the tins, but with them it seems altogether impossible to do it without noise,\" he thought to himself. \"I am very much afraid Hans has made his journey in vain.\" He opened the little bit of paper and added: I shall need a little bottle of oil so as to shoot the bolt without making a noise, and you will want one to help you to file through the staple. Hans came on duty again at twelve o\u0027clock. Yorke did not go near him for an hour, then he repeated the performance of the previous day, and as Hans held out his matchbox to him he slipped the tiny folded paper into his hand, and presently sauntered back to his companions and joined in a game of rounders. That evening when they were locked in their rooms he told the others: \"It must seem to you madness, but I have made up my mind to try and escape. I know that I may be shot in doing so, but I mean to try.\" \"But the thing is impossible, Harberton,\" one of them said. \"It will simply be throwing away your life.\" \"I am perfectly aware that it is very dangerous, but I have made up my mind to risk it. Why I tell you is that I don\u0027t wish to do anything that would cause greater precautions to be taken, and so make it still harder for anyone else to escape.\" \"It could not be harder than it is,\" one of them said; \"so if you can hit upon any plan of escape, by all means try it. You can speak Dutch well, and might get off. But if you could take us all out with you I would not try, for the betting against one\u0027s making one\u0027s way across the frontier unless speaking the language is at least a thousand to one.[Pg 231] They might not make any extraordinary fuss about one fellow getting off, but if eight of us were to do so they would scour the country everywhere and telegraph all over the place.\" \"I think it is, as you say, a piece of madness,\" another said. \"Of course, if you are willing to try, we don\u0027t want to prevent you; but you may be assured that, even should you by a miracle succeed, none of us would care to take the chances of getting out of the country. Of course Mafeking is the nearest point, but there are Boers all round it. While I regard it as impossible that you should get out, I consider it would be still more impossible for any of us to make our way across the frontier if we escaped with you.\" \"Thank you!\" Yorke said quietly. \"Certainly I mean to try, but I did not wish you to regard me as a cad for going away and not giving you a chance to escape with me. If you had expressed your opinion that my escape, if effected, would in any way make things more unpleasant for the others, I should have given up my idea at once.\" There was a murmur of approval among his hearers. \"It is a very proper spirit, Harberton,\" the senior of the party said. \"I know it has always been considered that a prisoner of war has a right to make his escape if he can, although such an escape may render the watch over the others more rigorous. Still, I think myself that it is a selfish and ungenerous action for any man to take, unless he is sure that others will not suffer for it. However, in the present case the watch is so close, and the obstacles to be overcome are so great, both in getting out and in making one\u0027s way across the country, that in no way could the escape of one officer add to the rigour of the imprisonment of the rest. Frankly, as far as I can see, bribery is the only possible means of escape, and unless you have a secret store, and that an abundant one, you can hardly hope to succeed with any of these fellows, for there is no question that they hate us bitterly.\" \"I am not thinking of that method. My resources at[Pg 232] present are represented by four shillings, which would not be sufficient, I think, to tempt any warder to give me his assistance. I am by no means sure that I shall get away, but if I do, it will be with the assistance of a friend in the town. I do not wish to say more, because after I am gone—that is, if I do go—questions may be asked, and it would be best that, instead of refusing to answer them, you should be able to say that you knew nothing of the manner in which I had escaped, nor who had assisted me.\" Yorke again strolled down to the palisade and stood looking through it thoughtfully for some time. The fences outside were certainly as awkward obstacles as could be imagined. The posts were six feet high; the wires were about eight inches apart, and the barbs a little more than six inches. On each wire were hung three tin cans between each post. There were three lines of fencing. The lowest wire was four inches above the ground, differing from the others only in having no tins attached to it, there not being depth enough for them to hang. Suddenly the puzzled look on Yorke\u0027s face was succeeded by one of satisfaction. \"It is as good as done!\" he exclaimed. \"With a strong pair of nippers the bottom wire can be cut, and that will leave a sufficient space to crawl under. There will be about a foot clear between the ground and the next wire. After deducting an inch for the barb, there are still eleven inches, and lying perfectly flat one ought to be able to crawl under that, taking care to avoid the tins.\" That day and the two days following Yorke did not go near Hans. One of the other guards might notice the latter talking two or three days in succession to the same prisoner. On the third day he again placed himself in his way and handed him a note. Get a strong pair of wire-nippers. Let the rope be about eighteen feet long. There is nothing else I shall want to enable us to get away. If you can get another rifle and[Pg 233] ammunition, and hide them some little distance from the prison, all the better. I shall save some food—enough, I hope, to last for two or three days. You had better bring some in your pocket too. There will be no moon on Monday next, and if you are on guard that night near my door we had better try then. At eleven o\u0027clock I shall be listening for the sound of your file. If I do not hear it by half-past eleven I shall suppose that you are posted somewhere else, but I shall listen three or four nights before, and every night after that, at the same hour. I shall not write again. It is better that we should not be noticed speaking to each other, so pay no attention to me unless you have something particular to say. As he gave the paper to Hans, the latter slipped into his hand a small tin oil-can, one of those used for oiling sewing-machines and bicycles, and also a paper of tobacco. \"If I am asked why I was speaking to you,\" Hans muttered, \"I can say you asked me to buy you a quarter of a pound of tobacco.\" It was well the precaution had been taken, for a minute later one of the other guards came up and asked roughly, \"What did that man give you?\" Yorke assumed a look of surprise, put his hand in his pocket, and took out the little parcel. \"There it is,\" he said. \"It is a quarter of a pound of tobacco. I asked him to get the best he could buy. I hope that he has done so, but I have not tried it.\" He opened it carelessly, and the guard glanced at it, and then went away satisfied with the explanation. \"It is just as well,\" Yorke said to himself, \"that I told Hans not to come near me again. Evidently that fellow had some sort of suspicion, and must have seen him speak to me before, for there is nothing unusual in the guard fetching us little things we want. There is certainly nothing suspicious about Hans\u0027 appearance. He has evidently[Pg 234] not washed his face for days, and looks as dirty as any of them.\" The time passed as usual till three days before the date appointed. For four days Yorke had not seen Hans, who had been put on night guard. Each evening he had gone to the door at eleven, and listened for half an hour without hearing any sound. He had hidden away one of the table-knives. On the Monday evening he heard, to his delight, a low grating sound, and knocked gently three times to let Hans know that he heard him. In half an hour he heard the bar cautiously removed, and with his knife at once shot back the bolt and opened the door. The night was pitch-dark, and after silently grasping his follower\u0027s hand, Yorke went on to his hands and knees, and began to crawl down the slope towards the palisade. \"Where are the sentries, Hans?\" he asked, when they had nearly reached it. \"There is one at each corner of the stand, and one on each side.\" \"I meant outside the wires.\" \"There are six or eight of them, and they keep on marching round and round. When one of the field-cornets visited the sentries the other night, he found three asleep. So the orders were that no one should sit down or stand still, but keep on going round and round, keeping as nearly as they could the same distance apart. But I don\u0027t see how we are to get through the wires.\" \"I see my way as to that, Hans. Have you got the nippers?\" \"Yes, Master Yorke, here they are.\" \"Now, don\u0027t say another word till we are outside, but just do as I tell you.\" Hans was well content with the order, for he had several times surveyed the fencing, and could see no possibility of getting over without not only being torn by the barbs, but also giving the alarm. He had, however, not troubled him[Pg 235]self very much about it, having implicit confidence in Yorke. They came down upon the palisade about half-way between two corners. \"Give me the rope, Hans,\" the latter whispered. He cut it in half, and made a slip-knot at one end of each piece. Both had taken off their boots before starting. \"Now,\" Yorke went on, when the two pieces of rope were ready, \"do you climb on to my shoulder and put these two loops round the top of one of the stakes. Let one hang down on this side, and the other outside. When you have fixed them, climb up and lower yourself by the rope to the ground. Be sure you do not make any noise. As soon as you are over, I will follow. You had better lie down as soon as you touch the ground.\" As Hans was able to reach the top of the palisade from Yorke\u0027s shoulders, he could carry out the order without noise. Yorke himself then climbed up by the rope. He had rather doubted whether Hans would be able to accomplish this, as, though strong, he was unaccustomed to anything like athletic exercise. To Yorke, however, the matter was easy. When he reached the other side, he lay down. \"Lie quiet till I tell you, Hans.\" The nearest fence was six feet from the palisade. Finding one of the posts, Yorke cut the lowest wire close to it. Then he cut it again some four feet away from the post, and carefully dragged the severed portions further along. He had thought that this would be the best plan, as, if he tried to coil the wire up, it might spring back again and strike one of the tins on the line above. These tins were for the most part hung half-way between posts, as the vibration there would be greatest. When he had this done, he whispered to Hans: \"There is room enough to crawl under the wire now, but you must lie perfectly flat, or you will be caught by the barbs. Push your hat through in front of you first. If you should catch, don\u0027t try to move; you would set the tins ringing. I will[Pg 236] come and free you. But if you are careful, you ought to have no trouble. I can get through easily enough.\" The next line was five yards outside the inner one, and as soon as Hans was through the first fence, Yorke proceeded to cut the lower wire as before. \"Lie where you are till I have cleared the way through the outside fence,\" he whispered to Hans. \"Dark as it is, they might see us if there were two of us together.\" While the work was going on, the sentries had passed frequently. They followed each other, however, at somewhat long intervals. As they sauntered along slowly, smoking their pipes, and occasionally humming a hymn tune, they kept some fifteen or twenty yards outside the boundary fence, so as to be sure that in the dark they should not run against it, and not only tear their clothes, but by shaking the tins give a false alarm. To facilitate this, lanterns had been placed at this distance away from each corner, so that as soon as they passed one they could see the gleam of another and walk straight for it. Yorke waited till two of the guard were about equally distant from where he was lying before cutting the last wire, and was very careful in using a steady pressure on the pliers, so as to prevent their closing in with a click. This time, instead of risking the second cut, he crawled along some little distance with the end, then he gave a low hiss, and Hans was soon beside him. \"Now, Hans, we will go together. They certainly cannot see us here, so we will crawl under this last wire, and then lie still till the next guard passes. Wait till he has gone twenty yards, then stand up and make a dash. Run as lightly as you can; but even if he hears us, we shall be out of sight before he can unsling his rifle and fire.\" Crawling under the wire, they remained as flat as possible on the ground until the next sentry passed. They could scarcely make out the outline of his figure. They waited till he had quite disappeared, then Yorke pressed his fol[Pg 237]lower\u0027s hand. They rose to their feet and quietly made off. Their footsteps were almost inaudible, even to themselves, on the sandy soil. As soon as they were past the line the sentries were following they quickened their steps, and after going fifty yards broke into a run. They were free now. There had been no challenge by the guards on either side of them, no pause in the slow dull tread of their heavy boots. They had run a hundred yards when Yorke said: \"Now, which way, Hans? Have you got a rifle for me?\" \"Yes, master, I got two from a lot that were standing against the wall of a drinking-shop while their owners were inside.\" \"What did you get two for, Hans? You brought your own out with you, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, but Peter wanted one too.\" \"Peter!\" Yorke repeated in surprise. \"What Peter?\" \"Long Peter, master.\" \"What! has he come with you?\" \"Yes, it was he who came to me and said, \u0027You know the baas has been taken prisoner?\u0027 I said, \u0027Yes, I heard it this morning.\u0027 \u0027Then,\u0027 he said, \u0027we must go and get him out of the hands of the Boers.\u0027 I had not thought of such a thing then; but, of course, I said I was ready. So I went in and told the colonel I wanted to go, and he gave me leave. Then I put on my farm clothes, and got yours from your room. Peter had said that I had better ride, so I mounted my horse and came off.\" \"Where is he now, Hans?\" \"He is at that little house about a quarter of a mile from the other side of the race-course. It is empty, and he is there with your clothes and the horse and some food. We must take a turn and go round there.\" \"It won\u0027t be easy to find it on such a dark night,\" Yorke said. \"We shall find it easily enough,\" Hans replied confidently. \"Peter pointed out to me that from the door the two lan[Pg 238]terns on this side were just in a line, so that when we came round, we should only have to keep them so, and we should come straight to the house.\" \"The Kaffir is a sharp fellow as well as a faithful one,\" Yorke said. \"It is well we have a guide to the house, for otherwise we might have searched about till daybreak. A horse would not matter so much, but without the disguise I could not hope to get away.\" In a few minutes they arrived at the house. A native was standing at the door holding a horse. \"You are a first-rate fellow, Peter,\" Yorke said as he shook him warmly by the hand, \"a downright brick, to have made this long journey, and run no end of risk to get me out. I am lucky indeed to have two such friends as you and Hans.\" \"We could not stop there, baas, and know that you were in prison,\" the native said simply. \"Not very difficult to get here, for we travel always at night. Which way shall we go now?\" \"I have been thinking it over, and have decided that we had better go down to Johannesburg. It is a large town, and people are sure to be there from all parts, and we shall be less noticed. What do you think, Hans?\" \"That is what I have been thinking too, Master Yorke.\" \"Do you know how the road lies from here, Peter?\" \"Yes, baas; we sweep round the town three or four miles, then come on the road.\" \"Do you think you could find your way all right?\" \"Quite sure to find it, baas; cloud clearing off, soon have stars come out.\" \"Then we will start at once; we are not likely to meet anyone on the road. If we keep on we shall be half-way there by daylight, we can then decide what we shall do. Now, where are the things?\" \"In this bundle, baas. I have them ready, because if I[Pg 239] had heard shots fired I should have run with the horse in that direction so as to meet you.\" Yorke did not wait to take off his uniform, but slipped the Boer clothes over it. \"Now, where are the provisions?\" he asked. \"In the bag behind the saddle,\" the Kaffir said. \"Four blankets tied in front, one for each of us and one for horse.\" \"That is right. We had better lead the horse for the next half-mile, for on a still night like this they might hear the sound if we were to trot. I don\u0027t say that they would give the alarm, as they could not say who it was: but if they were to discover that we had gone they might remember that they heard a horse, and so guess the line we had taken.\" They went quietly along for a quarter of an hour, then Yorke said: \"We are far enough off now. I will mount here. When you are tired, Hans, you can take my place and I will walk.\" But Hans laughed, \"I can keep on any time,\" he said, \"but I will let you know if I am tired.\" They proceeded slowly for the next half-hour, when, as the Kaffir had predicted, the clouds cleared off and the stars came out. \"Now, we can go on fast, baas.\" \"Then you had better get up behind me, Hans, the horse must have had little to do lately, and he can carry double very well; we shall thus gain a lot of time, and he will have another rest at Johannesburg.\" The Kaffir ran on lightly ahead, and at a trot the horse followed. In half an hour they came on the road south, and maintaining the pace, and breaking occasionally into a walk for a short distance, they kept on till morning broke. It was half-past twelve when they started, and by four they had done twenty-five miles and were within ten miles of Johannesburg. \"I think we may as well push on to the town,\" Yorke[Pg 240] said. \"If we were to leave the road and take to the veldt, people might notice us from the farmhouses and wonder what we were doing there.\" \"I think so too, Master Yorke. I travelled by night coming here, because the horse is too good for a rough Boer to be riding. I will get off now and walk beside it, that will look natural enough. You are a young Boer farmer and I am one of the farm hands, and you are going to Johannesburg to buy things you want, and have brought one of your Kaffirs to carry it back; no one would think twice about it.\" \"That will certainly be best, Hans; they cannot know yet that anything is wrong at the prison, and the fact that the lower wires are cut will not be noticed for some time later. I pulled up the rope inside the inclosure and dropped it outside before I slid down, so the alarm is not likely to be given until they go to open the door of my room. We put the bar in its place when we closed it. At any rate, we may calculate that it will be fully seven o\u0027clock before the alarm is given outside the prison. Even if they telegraph direct to Johannesburg to keep a look-out for me, we should be in the town before the message arrives. They will no doubt suspect that you were with me, for they will see that the staple has been filed through on the outside, and as you will be missing when they relieve the guard at six o\u0027clock, probably your description will be sent out with mine. When we get to the town I will go in with Peter only; you had better not follow the road, but go round and enter the town at some other point.\" Hans agreed that that would be the best plan, and, dismounting and taking hold of Yorke\u0027s stirrup-leather, trotted alongside. When within two miles of Johannesburg they saw two mounted Boers coming along in the distance, and at once broke into a walk. When they met the Boers the latter were engaged in conversation, and paid no attention to the party beyond returning Yorke\u0027s salutation. They met no one else until within a quarter of a mile of the town.[Pg 241] Hans here left the others. Peter, who had hidden his rifle in his clothes since they had first seen the two Boers approach them, now concealed it in a bush twenty yards from the road. It would have been out of character altogether for a native to carry arms in the Transvaal. Yorke rode on as soon as this had been done. He found the principal streets comparatively deserted. The greater portion of the stores were closed; many of these had their doors open and broken, showing that forcible entry had been made and their contents carried away. Some of the hotels were closed, others were open; but the uncleaned windows and the general appearance of untidiness showed that there were but few people staying there, and that their owners kept them open as a matter of policy rather than of gain. Yorke dismounted before a second-rate looking establishment, Peter took the reins and led the horse into the yard. A Kaffir boy came out from the stables. \"Put the horse in,\" Yorke, who followed, said, \"I may be staying here for a day or two.\" After seeing this done he went into the house. \"I want some breakfast,\" he said in Dutch to an untidy-looking German who sauntered into the hall. \"I shall want a bed to-night.\" \"All right!\" the man said; \"you can go upstairs and choose any room you like, they are all empty. I suppose bacon and eggs will do for breakfast? I have nothing else except canned meat.\" \"Bacon and eggs will do very well.\" \"They will be ready in a quarter of an hour,\" the man said. \"I have put my horse in the stable,\" Yorke went on. \"Is there any news?\" \"Yes, we have beaten Buller again. I suppose you have heard that?\" \"No, our farm is out of the way of news. When was it?\" \"On the 27th, at least that was the last of it. We were[Pg 242] fighting for a week, and they say that pretty near half of them were killed. They took a strong hill called Spion Kop, but we drove them out again. Buller has recrossed the Tugela, and I expect now that they will give up in Ladysmith, as we know that they are starving, and there is no longer any chance of Buller getting in. He must know that himself by this time. It will be our turn next, and when Ladysmith surrenders we shall chase Buller down to Durban.\" By the tone in which the man spoke Yorke could see that he did not put any very great faith in the story he was telling. \"That is good news,\" he said heartily. \"I am sorry I was not down there when the others went; I could not be spared at home. My mother is not strong, and could not look after the Kaffirs and the cattle.\" \"You are out of luck,\" the man said. \"Well, I might have got shot, you know, if I had been there.\" \"Not much risk of that,\" the man replied, \"for they say that the Rooineks cannot shoot, and that we kill a hundred of them to every one they hit.\" \"They must shoot badly indeed if that is the case.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t say it is so, but that is what they tell us; and as Kruger says so, and the newspapers say so, of course we must believe it. I don\u0027t trouble about it one way or the other. My boss went down to Bloemfontein a month ago and left me here in charge. It is little enough I have to do, for your people are not given much to pay for liquor, especially when they can get as much as they like by breaking open the door of a store, and it ain\u0027t once a week that a bed is wanted. Still, if the place had been shut up, it would have been looted like the rest of the empty houses. It is dull work enough, for there is only myself and the Kaffir woman who cooks. Well, I had better go and see about your breakfast.\" [Pg 243] While Yorke ate his breakfast the German, who was evidently glad to have someone to talk to, sat down on a table and smoked. \"I suppose,\" he said, \"you have come from somewhere near Heidelberg?\" \"No,\" Yorke replied, \"I have come from the south. I don\u0027t know whether you know the country between the Klip River and Blesbok Spruit?\" \"No, I have never been there.\" \"Ah, then, you would not know the farm! It is not very far from where the two rivers fall into the Vaal, twenty miles or so below Heidelberg.\" \"I suppose your people are with the Heidelberg commando?\" Yorke nodded. \"Well, I don\u0027t know much about war,\" the German said, \"for I slipped away from home before my time came to join the army, and I am not likely to return; but it certainly seems to me queer that, though it is more than three months since the business began, you have not taken either Ladysmith, Kimberley, or Mafeking yet; and yet your people made sure that by this time they would be at Durban on one side, and Cape Town on the other. It has been badly managed.\" \"Very badly managed,\" Yorke agreed. \"If it had been left to Joubert to do as he liked, things would have gone differently, but he was interfered with by Kruger, and Steyn, and all Kruger\u0027s people here. I was very sorry at first that I could not go with the others to Natal, but I begin to think I am better off at home than they are. Besides, after all it does not matter to me whether we drive the Rooineks out or not. As far as I can see they have done no harm; we get a lot more for our cattle now than we did before they came, and if they were all to go, prices would fall again.\" \"You are right,\" the German said; \"hotel-keeping would not be a paying game with us if all the Uitlanders were[Pg 244] driven out. So far, I reckon that, what with the hotels and stores being closed and most of the mines shut down, and almost all the men with money gone, this town is millions of pounds poorer than it was last year. You seem a sensible young fellow, but most of your people are so unreasonable that there is no talking with them. They know very little themselves, and believe everything that is told them. Of course we who live here are obliged to seem to agree with them, but we don\u0027t at heart believe that things are going to turn out as they fancy. They know nothing about England, and we do. When I first left Germany I went there and learned my business as a waiter in a hotel in London, and I know something about them, and how they put down that great mutiny in India.
