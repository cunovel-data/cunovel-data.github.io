He said you were very tired and wanted to be sure you slept as long as you needed. I’m very sorry about your grandmother.”\n “Thank you—I’m sorry, too,” Julia said, breathing in deeply at the fresh stab of pain she felt at the mention of Ruth’s death. That pain would be with her for a long while. Losing her grandmother had left a wide, gaping hole in her heart. Alek’s love had helped her begin to heal, but she would always miss Ruth.\n Sitting down at the table with the morning paper, Julia tried to focus her attention on the headlines. Soon the words blurred and ran together. The tears came as an unwelcome surprise, and she bent her head, hoping Anna wouldn’t notice.\n The sound of the front door opening announced Alek’s return. Julia hurriedly wiped the tears from her cheeks and smiled up at him. She hadn’t fooled him, she realized, but it didn’t matter. He strolled over to her, his eyes full of love, and kissed her deeply.\n Julia had trouble not losing herself in his kiss. It would have been so easy to let it lead to something more.…\n Alek glanced impatiently over his shoulder at his sister. “I’ll give her the rest of the day off,” he whispered.\n “Don’t be silly.”\n The hunger in his eyes told her how serious he was. He raised her effortlessly from her chair, sat down and held her in his lap.\n “You slept late?” he questioned, smoothing the hair away from her face.\n “Very late. You should’ve gotten me up.”\n “I was tempted. Tomorrow I will have no qualms about waking you.”\n “Really?” she asked, loving him so much it felt as if she could hardly contain it. She saw Anna watching them and could tell that Alek’s sister was pleased at their closeness. “We’re going on a picnic?”\n “Yes,” Alek said, his face brightening.\n “Where?”\n “That’s a surprise. Bring a sweater, an extra set of clothes and a…” He hesitated, as if searching for a word, something he rarely did. “A kite.”\n “Kite…as in a flying-in-the-wind kite?”\n He nodded enthusiastically.\n “Alek,” she said, studying him, “Are you taking me to the ocean?”\n “Yes, my love, the ocean. And,” he added, “we’re leaving our cell phones and BlackBerries behind.”\n Julia had no problem with that directive.\n Within fifteen minutes they were on their way. Anna’s basket was tucked away in the backseat, along with an extra set of clothes for each of them, several beach towels, a blanket—and no fewer than five different kites, all of which Alek had bought while he was out.\n He drove to Ocean Shores. The sun shone brightly and the surf pounded the sand with a roar that echoed toward them. The scent of salt stung the air. Sea gulls soared overhead, looking for an opportune meal. There were plenty of people, but this was nothing like the crowded beaches along the Oregon and California coasts.\n Alek parked the car and found them an ideal spot to spread out their blanket and bask in the sunshine. Julia removed her shoes and ran barefoot in the warm sand, chasing after him.\n “This is perfect,” she cried, throwing out her arms. “I love it.”\n Alek returned to the car for their picnic basket and the kites and joined her on the blanket. He looked more relaxed than she could ever remember seeing him. He sank down beside her and stretched out with a contented sigh.\n The wind buffeted them and a minute later, Alek moved, positioning himself behind her. He wrapped his arms around her and inhaled slowly, drawing the salty air into his lungs. Julia did the same, breathing in the fresh clean scent of the sea.\n “It’s so peaceful here,” she murmured. There were a number of activities going on around them, including horseback riding, kite flying, a football-throwing contest, even a couple of volleyball games, but none of those distracted her from the serenity she experienced.\n “I thought you’d feel this way.” He kissed the side of her neck.\n Julia relaxed against his strength, letting him absorb her weight.\n “My mother often brought Anna and me to the Black Sea after our father was killed.”\n Julia knew shockingly little about her husband’s life before he came to the United States. “How old were you when he died?”\n “Ten. Anna was seven. It was 1986.”\n “How did he die?”\n It seemed an eternity passed before Alek spoke, and when he did his voice was low. “He was murdered. I don’t think we will ever know the real reason. They came, the soldiers, in the middle of the night. We were all asleep. I woke to my mother’s screams but by the time I got past the soldier guarding the door, my father was already dead.”\n “Oh, Alek.” Julia’s throat tightened with the effort to hold back tears.\n “We learned from someone who risked his life to tell us that the KGB suspected my father of some illegal activity—we never heard the details. It made no sense to us since my father was a loyal Communist. Like me, he worked as a chemist.”\n “Oh, Alek. How terrible for all of you.”\n “Yes,” he agreed, “and it nearly destroyed my mother. If it hadn’t been for Anna and me, I believe my mother would have died, too. Not at the soldiers’ hands, but from grief.”\n “What happened afterward?”\n “My mother had to support us. Both Anna and I did everything we could to help, but it was difficult. Because I was a good student, I was given the opportunity to attend university. It was there that I met my first Americans. I couldn’t believe the freedom and prosperity those students told me about. I’ve always been good with languages—Anna, too. Soon afterward, I started learning English. After I met Jerry, he sent me books and CDs. He was my link to America.”\n “Were you surprised when he asked you to come and work for Conrad Industries?”\n “Yes.”\n “Did Jerry ever tell you about his beautiful younger sister?” Julia prodded.\n “In passing.”\n “Were you curious about me?”\n “No.”\n She poked him in the ribs and was rewarded with a mock cry of pain.\n “I’m more curious now,” he said, laughing.\n “Good.”\n His hand edged beneath her blouse.\n “Alek!”\n “I’m just wondering how fast I can make you want me.”\n “Fast enough. Now, stop. We’re on a public beach.”\n He sighed as though her words had wounded him. “Maybe we should get a hotel room.”\n “We could have done that in Seattle. Since we’re at the beach and the day is gorgeous, let’s enjoy ourselves.”\n “Julia,” Alek said sternly, “trust me, we would enjoy ourselves in a hotel room, too.”\n Smiling, she leaned back her head to look at him. “No one told me you were a sex fiend.”\n “You do this to me, Julia, only you.”\n “I promise I’ll satisfy your, uh, carnal appetite,” she assured him with a grin. “And I’m a woman of my word.”\n “I must not be so selfish,” Alek said, and the teasing quality was gone from his voice. “I didn’t bring you here to make love, I brought you here to heal. After my father was killed, my mother made weekly trips to the beach with Anna and me. It was a time of solace for us, and it helped us heal. I hoped it would help you, too.”\n “It does,” Julia said, looking out at the pounding surf.\n “You must forgive my greed for you.”\n “Only if you forgive my greed for you.” The love-making was so new, they were eager to learn everything they could about each other, eager to give and to receive. Julia didn’t fool herself into believing this kind of desire could continue. If it did, they might both die of sheer exhaustion.\n “I want you to relax in my arms,” Alek said, “and close your eyes.” He waited a moment. “Are they closed?”\n She nodded. The sounds that came at her were intense. The ocean as it slapped against the shore, the cry of the birds and the roar of scooters as they shot past her, kicking up the sand. The smells, carried on the wind, were pungent.\n “Now open your eyes.”\n Julia obeyed and was overwhelmed by the richness of the colors around her. The sky was blue with huge puffy clouds. The water was a sparkling green that left a thin, white, frothy trail on the sand. Every color was vibrant, every detail. Julia’s breath caught in her throat at the beauty before her.\n “Oh, Alek, it’s so lovely.”\n “My mother did that with Anna and me, but I think she was doing it for herself, too. She wanted us to see that life could be good, if we looked around at the world instead of within ourselves.”\n Julia knew that was what she’d been doing these past few years, looking at the darkness and the shortcomings within herself. Under such intense scrutiny, her faults had seemed glaring. It was little wonder that she’d been so miserable.\n “Alek,” she said, with her discovery, “thank you, thank you so much.”\n They kissed, and it was as if his love was absolution for all that had gone before and all that would come later. She turned in his embrace and slipped her arms around his neck. When they’d finished kissing, they simply held each other.\n Alek knew his relationship with Julia had changed that afternoon by the ocean. Things between them were different now. More open, more trusting. They’d had fun, too—childish, uncomplicated fun—something neither of them had done in years. They’d flown kites, run through the surf, eaten Anna’s sandwiches and cookies, feeding each other bites.\n Sunday evening, the day after their venture to the beach, Alek needed to run down to the lab. When he told Julia, she offered to go with him, as if even an hour apart was more than she could bear.\n Her willingness had taken him by surprise.\n “You’re sure?” he asked.\n “Of course. It’ll do me good to get out.”\n They listened to classical music on the way across town. Security had been increased at the plant, with extra guards posted; Alek gave them a friendly nod. Julia went with him into his office. He found the notes he needed and brought them home.\n “Would you like some coffee?” she asked once they’d returned.\n “Please.” Her desire to indulge him with small pleasures was something of a surprise, too, a pleasant one.\n While he read over his calculations, Julia was content to sit at his side, absorbed in a novel. He couldn’t remember a time when she’d voluntarily sat still. Her body always seemed to be filled with nervous energy. That was gone from her now and in its place had come a restfulness.\n “I’m not looking forward to work in the morning,” she said when Alek was finished. Leaning against him, she stretched her legs out along the sofa and heaved a giant sigh. “These past few days have been so wonderful. I don’t feel ready to deal with the office again.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-20.html","bookId":1964,"book":{"id":1964,"title":"An Engagement in Seattle","description":"Storyline: \n An Engagement in Seattle: Groom Wanted\\Bride Wanted (From This Day Forward #1-2) \n Aleksandr Berinksi is a Russian biochemist in the U.S. on a visa that is about to expire.
