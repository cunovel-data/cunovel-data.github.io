He left the room and Alek slid his arm behind her back, helped her into an upright sitting position and held her against his chest. She braced her hands against his ribs, intent on pushing herself free. “No,” he said, kissing her temple. “You can mistrust and hate me later, but for right now let me hold you.” “That’s the problem,” she whispered. “I believe you.” “Right now, we won’t speak of this again. You’ve worked yourself into a state of collapse.” “I don’t know what happened here, but I’m sure it’s nothing important. I’ve just been overstressed, that’s all.” Jerry returned with the water. “Why is it I’m always getting you water?” he joked, handing her a paper cup. “You’d think I’d gone to college to be a water boy instead of an attorney.” “I’m sorry,” she said, pressing her hand to the side of her head. “I didn’t mean to create such a commotion.” “Should we take her back to her office?” Jerry asked, looking at Alek. “No, I’ll take her home.” “If you don’t mind, I prefer to make my own decisions,” Julia stiffly informed them both. They made it sound as if she were a piece of furniture they couldn’t decide where to place. Leaning against the back of a chair, she stood. She felt a bit unstable, but that dizziness quickly passed. “I’m fine. You two go about your business and I’ll go about mine.” “Julia, for heaven’s sakes, would you listen to common sense? You just fainted,” Jerry informed her, as if she hadn’t figured it out yet. “I know that.” “Let Alek take you home.” “No.” “I think she’d feel more comfortable if you took her,” Alek suggested. “I fainted,” she told both men, “I didn’t have a lobotomy. Let me assure you, I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions, and I’m not leaving my office until I’m finished with what I need to do.” “Some of those decisions should be questioned,” Jerry snapped. “Jerry.” “Shut up, Alek, this is between me and my sister. She’s an emotional and physical wreck because of this mess and to complicate matters she decides to play detective herself.” “I don’t understand.” “Jerry, could we discuss this another time?” Julia asked pointedly. “No. Alek has a right to know. Tell him.” “Julia?” Alek turned to face her. “What’s Jerry talking about?” She flashed her brother a scathing look. “It’s nothing.” “Fine, I’ll tell him. Julia had the bright idea of calling Roger Stanhope herself and playing this crazy game with him. She said she knew about the meeting between the two of you.” Alek’s gaze narrowed. “And what did Stanhope say?” “You can well imagine.” “I didn’t believe Roger,” Julia said. “I never did.” Jerry was right, contacting Roger hadn’t been the smartest thing she’d ever done, but she was desperate. “What my sister failed to remember is that Roger isn’t stupid. She was fishing for information and he knew it, so he made up this ridiculous story about you trying to strike a deal with Ideal Paints.” Alek released a one-word expletive. “It’s driving her crazy,” Jerry continued. “She looked terrible when she came to see me this morning.” Julia watched her husband. He was distancing himself from her, physically and emotionally, freezing her out. “She must make her own decision and I must make mine.” Without another word, Alek turned and left the conference room. “I wish you hadn’t said anything to him about my talk with Roger.” “Why not? He had a right to know.” Her lack of faith—and the fact that she’d acted on it—had hurt Alek. She’d seen it in his eyes and in the way he’d stiffened and moved away from her. Covering her face with her hands, Julia slowly exhaled. “I have to go,” she whispered. “I’ll talk to you tomorrow.” Julia’s head was pounding as she walked out of the conference room. She checked the time, wanting to know how long she had before her appointment with Dr. Feldon. The physician had been treating her family for the past fifteen years and knew Julia well. She arrived at his office at one minute past five and was ushered directly into the exam room. His nurse asked her a series of questions. “Basically, I’ve been under a lot of stress lately,” Julia explained. “This afternoon the craziest thing happened. I fainted. Me! I can’t believe it.” After taking her temperature and her blood pressure, Dr. Feldon’s nurse asked for a urine sample. Minutes later, she was joined by Dr. Feldon. His hair was grayer than the last time she’d seen him and he was a little thicker around the waist. “Julia, it’s good to see you, although I wish it were under different circumstances. Now tell me what the problem is.” The tears came as a surprise and an acute embarrassment. “I…I’m just not myself lately. There’s been so much happening with the company and I’ve been so stressed, and today I fainted right in the middle of a marketing meeting. I gave my husband and my brother quite a scare.” “Yes, I heard you got married. Congratulations.” She smiled weakly in response. Dr. Feldon reached for a tissue and pressed it into her hand. “How are you feeling now?” She had to stop and think about it. “A little woozy.” “And emotional?” She nodded, paused, then blew her nose. “I’d say this is all normal, my dear. Most pregnant women experience these symptoms.” Twelve “Pregnant?” Julia repeated in a shocked whisper. “You mean all this, the nausea and the fainting spell, is because I’m going to have a baby?” “No, I think the stress you’ve talked about is complicating the symptoms.” “But I don’t have morning sickness.” “A good many women don’t. Some have what you might call afternoon sickness instead. My guess is that you’re one of those.” “I should’ve realized.…” Julia began, wondering why she hadn’t recognized her condition herself. “As you probably know I stopped delivering babies several years back. I can recommend an excellent obstetrician. I’ll have my receptionist make an appointment for you, if you’d like. Her name is Dr. Lois Brandt and my patients who’ve had babies delivered by her have been very pleased.” “Yes, that would be fine.” Julia was both excited and surprised, although heaven knew she had no right to be. “How…far along do you think I am?” Dr. Feldon chuckled. “My estimate is about two weeks.” She nodded, knowing it couldn’t be much more than that, astonished, too, that her pregnancy could be detected so early. “I’m going to prescribe prenatal vitamins and have you start watching your diet. According to those ridiculous charts the insurance companies put out, you’re about five pounds underweight. Don’t skip meals, and make an effort to eat from the major food groups every day. Plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables,” he emphasized. Smiling, Julia nodded. Dr. Feldon made it sound as if she were pregnant with a rabbit instead of a baby. She left the office a few minutes later, her step lighter. A baby. She was going to have a baby. Alek would— Alek. Her thoughts came to a skidding halt. This complicated everything tenfold. There was far more at stake now than before. There was far more involved. They’d introduced a tiny being into the equation. Julia’s steps slowed. She wasn’t sure what to do or say to him, if anything. At least, not yet. He had a right to know, but Julia wasn’t convinced now was the time to tell him. She returned to her condominium and let herself in. Two steps into the entry, she nearly stumbled over a large leather suitcase. She heard movement in the master bedroom and walked down the hallway leading to it. Alek stood inside the walk-in closet, carefully removing his clothes from their hangers. Another large leather suitcase yawned open on top of the bed. “Alek? What are you doing?” He continued his work without looking at her. “It should be obvious.” “You’re moving out,” she whispered and the truth hit her like a slap of icy rain. Alek was leaving. “I knew you’d figure it out sooner or later.” He walked over to his suitcase and carefully folded his shirts and placed them inside. “Where will you be living?” “I don’t know yet. I don’t believe there’s any reason for us to stay in touch after I move out.” “What about at the office? I mean—” “As of four-thirty this afternoon I am no longer an employee of Conrad Industries.” Julia’s heart froze at what his words implied. “I see.… You’re going to work for Ideal Paints.” He whirled around to face her. “No, Julia, I am not going to work for the competition. I know it means nothing to you, but the Berinski word of honor is all I have to offer you as proof. On the grave of my father, I swear I would never do anything to hurt you or Jerry. That includes betraying you to Ideal Paints or any other of your competitors.” He spun back around and resumed his task, his movements abrupt and hurried as if he was eager to be on his way. Julia didn’t want him to leave, but she couldn’t ask him to stay, either. “Why now?” she asked, sitting on the edge of the bed. She wasn’t sure her shaky legs would support her. She felt as if she was about to burst into tears, which would have embarrassed them both. “I’d hoped that given time you’d see the truth, but I no longer believe that’s possible.” “Why not?” “If you believe Stanhope’s word over mine, then I have to accept that you’re not capable of recognizing the truth when you hear it.” Julia had no argument to give him, although her doubts and fears were beginning to mount. “Do you want a divorce?” He went still for a moment, as if the question required some consideration. “That’s up to you. I told you once that my religion forbids it.” Julia relaxed a little, but not much. “I can’t live with you, Julia, and I can’t see ever living with you again.” “It wasn’t so bad, was it?” she said, looking for something, anything, to bring them back together, to force him to acknowledge his love for her. She was tempted to tell him her news, but if he stayed, she wanted it to be because he loved her and not because she’d trapped him. “No, Julia, living with you wasn’t bad—if you don’t mind a porcupine for a wife.” She sucked in her breath at the pain his words caused.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-26.html","bookId":1964,"book":{"id":1964,"title":"An Engagement in Seattle","description":"Storyline: An Engagement in Seattle: Groom Wanted\\Bride Wanted (From This Day Forward #1-2) Aleksandr Berinksi is a Russian biochemist in the U.S. on a visa that is about to expire.
