She wasn’t pleased by it, nor did she feel good about tricking Alek. He’d insisted from the first that their marriage be real. He’d made it known that he intended to sleep with her; he also wanted children. Julia couldn’t allow any of that. Alek didn’t understand and neither did Jerry. Julia was incapable of love, the kind of trusting love a husband and wife shared. That possibility was dead, destroyed by Roger’s treachery. Never again would she put her faith in a man. Alek expected her to be his wife in every way, but soon he’d learn the truth. Soon he’d know for himself how badly he was being cheated. Such deception didn’t sit well with Julia, but there was no avoiding it.\\n\\n While Julia admired Alek, she found herself nervous around him. He left her feeling naked, somehow. Exposed. He seemed to be able to look into her very soul. That didn’t make sense, but she couldn’t shake the suspicion that in some uncanny way he knew all there was to know about her.\\n\\n “Immigration is going to ask about the wedding,” Jerry went on. “We need proof that what prompted the marriage to Alek was nothing less than earth-shattering love. A hurried-up affair in some judge’s chambers won’t work. They’re going to want evidence of your commitment and devotion to each other.”\\n\\n “A hurried-up affair at the Four Seasons will convince them of all that?” she asked sarcastically.\\n\\n Jerry sighed again. “It looks better. Now, I suggest you go out and get yourself a fancy wedding dress while I make arrangements with Virginia. We’ll deal with the caterers and the photographers and see to having the invitations hand-delivered.”\\n\\n “Jerry, this is crazy!” Julia protested. The idea of dressing up in an elaborate wedding gown, as if she were a loving bride on display, appalled her. Nor was she keen on posing for a series of photographs, like a new wife passionately in love with her husband. It was too much. “I can’t go through with this,” she said evenly.\\n\\n “You’ve already agreed.”\\n\\n “To the marriage, yes, but not this…this circus. It’s becoming a Hollywood production, a show for media attention.”\\n\\n “A show is what we need if we’re going to fool the Immigration investigators,” Jerry argued. “And trust me, Julia, this marriage will be investigated.”\\n\\n Julia walked over to the window and studied the street several floors below. In a moment of weakness, when her fears had been rampant and she was so deathly afraid of losing Ruth, Julia had gone to Alek and agreed to his terms. Even now she didn’t understand what had prompted her. She was sick of analyzing it, furious with herself for being so weak. This morning, once her head had cleared, she’d realized it had all been a mistake. But by then Alek had contacted Jerry, who’d put everything in motion. Now, it seemed, there was no turning back.\\n\\n Her intercom hummed before Virginia’s efficient voice reached out to her. “Mr. Berinski is here to see you.”\\n\\n Julia looked at her brother in sheer panic. She wasn’t prepared to deal with Alek just yet. They hadn’t spoken since she’d consented to the marriage.\\n\\n “Julia,” Jerry prompted when she didn’t respond.\\n\\n “Send him in,” Julia instructed her assistant, steeling herself for the confrontation.\\n\\n No sooner had the words left her mouth than the door leading to her office opened. Alek walked in and his dark eyes shone brightly as he gazed over at her. A slow, seductive smile appeared on his lips.\\n\\n “Good afternoon.” Alek spoke to her brother first, then returned his attention to her. “Julia.”\\n\\n “Alek,” she said briskly, surprised by how defensive she sounded.\\n\\n He didn’t seem perturbed by her lack of welcome. Last night she’d agreed to become his wife, accepting the stipulations he’d set. She’d been overwrought with anxiety, frightened and lost. Yet no matter how hard she argued with herself, Julia wouldn’t change her mind…unless Alek wanted out. She was a woman of honor, a woman of her word. She knew he was the same way.\\n\\n “I was just clearing the wedding arrangements with Julia,” Jerry explained.\\n\\n Alek’s eyes refused to leave her. She felt her face heat and wished with everything in her that she could escape.\\n\\n “I’d like some time alone with my fiancée,” Alek said.\\n\\n Julia sent Jerry a pleading glance, not wanting him to leave her. Jerry ignored the unspoken request, mumbled something under his breath and walked out of the room.\\n\\n “You want to talk?” she asked abruptly. She rubbed her palms and walked away from him. Her shoulders felt stiff and her legs heavy.\\n\\n “You’re nervous.”\\n\\n Nervous. Terrified. Afraid. None of those words adequately described what Julia was experiencing. The situation had an eerie, unreal quality that she couldn’t shake. Only a few years earlier she’d looked forward to being a happy bride. She’d dreamed of the day Roger would slip a wedding band on her finger and gaze down at her with love.\\n\\n She felt a flash of unexpected pain, then forced herself to shake the image from her head.\\n\\n “All brides are nervous,” she said quietly in response to his question.\\n\\n “How is your grandmother?”\\n\\n “I’ll be seeing her this afternoon.… Better, I believe.” According to the nurse Julia had spoken with that morning, Ruth had slept restfully through the night. But that had been after Jerry had spoken to her and said Julia would be marrying Aleksandr Berinski. Her grandmother had only met Alek once, and that had been recently. He’d obviously made quite an impression, because his name had cropped up with alarming frequency ever since.\\n\\n “Do you wish to cancel the wedding?” Alek probed.\\n\\n Here was her chance, handed to her on the proverbial silver platter. All she needed to do was tell him that she hadn’t been herself, that she hadn’t been fully aware of what she was doing. She opened her mouth to explain it all away and found she couldn’t. The words refused to come. While she was fumbling for a reply, he stepped behind her and rested his hands on her shoulders. He leaned forward, gently kissing the side of her neck.\\n\\n Julia froze. It was the first time a man had touched her since Roger. She couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. Alek didn’t seem to notice. Sliding his arms around her, he brought her against him. His breath stirred shivers along her spine and a curious warmth crept into her blood.\\n\\n Alek turned her around to face him. She wasn’t given the opportunity to object as he pressed his mouth to hers. His lips moved slowly over hers. She wedged her hands between them, braced her palms against his hard chest and pushed herself free. Her lungs felt as though they were about to burst, and she drew in a deep breath.\\n\\n Alek didn’t seem offended or surprised by her actions. His eyes danced with mischief as they sought hers. Julia raised the back of her hand to her mouth and held it there. She burned with anger. He’d done this intentionally so she’d know he expected to touch her and kiss her often after the ceremony. She was to be his wife in every sense of the word and he wouldn’t tolerate a loveless, sexless marriage. He wanted her and he was making sure she knew it.\\n\\n What was she going to do?\\n\\n Julia stood outside the bridal shop with all the thrill and anticipation of a long-overdue visit to the dentist.\\n\\n She opened the door and walked inside, grateful the saleswoman wasn’t busy.\\n\\n “Hello.”\\n\\n “Hello,” Julia said stiffly, fanning out the billowing chiffon skirt of a pale yellow bridesmaid’s dress that hung from a rack.\\n\\n “May I help you?” came the friendly voice.\\n\\n Julia revealed her lack of enthusiasm with a noncommittal shrug. “I need a wedding dress for this Friday afternoon.”\\n\\n The shopkeeper was petite, hardly more than five feet tall with soft brown hair. The woman was a dreamer; Julia could see it in her eyes. She, too, had once worn that same look of innocence.…\\n\\n “The wedding is this Friday?”\\n\\n “I know that doesn’t give me much time,” Julia said, feeling foolish. “It’s one of those spur-of-the-moment things.”\\n\\n “Don’t worry,” the saleswoman assured her, hurrying toward a long rack of plastic-covered wedding dresses. “Spur-of-the-moment weddings are often the most romantic.”\\n\\n Julia had nothing to add. She could tell that this woman was more than a dreamer; she was also hopelessly sentimental. She had her head in the clouds when it came to love, and no doubt her attitude had been influenced by her job. She dealt with women who were deeply in love, women for whom the entire world was there for the taking.\\n\\n Three years earlier, Julia had been one of them. Young, enthusiastic and so much in love she didn’t recognize what should’ve been obvious.\\n\\n “I’d like a very plain dress,” she said forcefully, breaking off her thoughts.\\n\\n “Plain,” the woman repeated slowly.\\n\\n “The plainer the better,” Julia reiterated, strolling about the store.\\n\\n “I’m afraid I have a limited selection of plain dresses.”\\n\\n That was what Julia feared. “Something simple, then.”\\n\\n “Simple and elegant?” she asked, grinning approvingly. “Would you like to look through this rack? Choose the designs that appeal to you, I’ll get them in your size, and then you can try them on.”\\n\\n As far as Julia was concerned, this business with the wedding dress was a waste of time. She wanted it to be over and done with so she could head for the hospital and visit Ruth.\\n\\n The saleswoman led her to the appropriate display of gowns. Julia shuffled through them quickly, making two selections. Neither dress really appealed to her.\\n\\n “I’ll try on these two,” Julia said.\\n\\n The woman made no comment as she went into the back room and returned a few minutes later with the two dresses in the correct size. She took them into the dressing room and placed them on the hook.\\n\\n Julia obediently followed her inside. She undressed and slipped into the first dress. It was just as the saleswoman had promised. Simple and elegant. A straight skirt made of silk, a beaded yoke and cuffs. It looked fine, Julia supposed.\\n\\n “No,” the shop-owner said with certainty. “This one doesn’t suit you.”\\n\\n “It looks…”\\n\\n “No,” the woman repeated. “Don’t even bother to try on the next dress. It wouldn’t suit you, either.”\\n\\n “Please, I don’t have a lot of time.”\\n\\n “The dress is one of the most important aspects of your wedding. Every bride deserves to feel beautiful on her special day.”\\n\\n Julia didn’t know why she felt like crying, but she did. Buckets of tears welled up inside her. She was grateful the woman didn’t seem to notice. Brides deserved a whole lot more than feeling beautiful; they deserved to marry a man they loved. A man who loved them, too.\\n\\n “Wait here,” she instructed. She left the changing area and came back a moment later carrying a lovely ornate dress. The silk gown with pearls and sequins was anything but simple. Rarely had Julia seen a dress as intricate as this. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-4.html","bookId":1964,"book":{"id":1964,"title":"An Engagement in Seattle","description":"Storyline: An Engagement in Seattle: Groom Wanted\\Bride Wanted (From This Day Forward #1-2) \\n Aleksandr Berinksi is a Russian biochemist in the U.S. on a visa that is about to expire.
