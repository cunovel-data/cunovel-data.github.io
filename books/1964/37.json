Fact is, you were as happy as I’ve seen you in ages.”\\n\\n “That was before I knew. He goes on TV and says the reason he decided on the billboard was so he could be—and I quote—direct and straightforward. He wasn’t either one with me.”\\n\\n “You’ve got to trust your instincts,” Daisy advised, “and you had a wonderful time with him last night.”\\n\\n Now Lesley had heard everything. “Trust my instincts? I was engaged to a man who wasn’t even in love with me and I didn’t figure it out until half the school knew, including the student body.” It still mortified her to remember the strange, sympathetic looks she’d gotten from her peers weeks prior to her broken engagement.\\n\\n “Quit blaming yourself for that,” Daisy said, placing her hands on her hips. “You didn’t suspect Tony because you shouldn’t have suspected him. Believe me, honey, you got the better end of that deal. Mark my words. Two or three years down the road, he’s going to start looking around again. It’s a pattern with certain men. I’ve seen it before.”\\n\\n “Tony’s not like that,” Lesley insisted. Even after all this time she couldn’t keep from defending him. She still wasn’t over him, still wasn’t over the loss of her dreams and the future she’d envisioned. She wanted to forget him, but it was hard. The first ray of hope had been Chase, and now that hope was dashed by his deception.\\n\\n “It seems to me there’s more to Chase than meets the eye,” Daisy said thoughtfully. “You have to admit he’s innovative.”\\n\\n “The man rented a billboard and advertised for a wife,” Lesley cried. “That’s not innovation, it’s stupidity.”\\n\\n Daisy went on, undaunted. “He shows initiative, too.”\\n\\n “How can you defend him when you haven’t even met him?”\\n\\n “You’re right, of course,” Daisy agreed, “but there’s something about him I like. He can’t be so bad, otherwise you’d never have gone out with him.”\\n\\n “That was before I knew what he really was like.”\\n\\n “The guy’s obviously got money. Did you ever stop to think about that? Billboards don’t come cheap.”\\n\\n “Money’s never interested me.”\\n\\n “It doesn’t unless you need it,” Daisy answered with a hint of sarcasm. “Another thing…”\\n\\n “You mean there’s more?”\\n\\n “There’s always more. This guy is serious. He isn’t going to string you along the way you-know-who did. Good grief, you were with the-guy-you-don’t-want-me-to-mention how many years?”\\n\\n “Five.”\\n\\n “That’s what I thought. Well, let me tell you, there’s an advantage in knowing what a guy wants from you. Chase doesn’t have a hidden agenda.”\\n\\n “Everything you say is true, but it doesn’t discount the fact that he deceived me.”\\n\\n “Just a minute.” Daisy frowned at her. “Didn’t you tell me Chase ran after the guy who stole your purse? It isn’t every man who’d get involved in something like that, you know. Did you ever stop to think that mugger might’ve had a gun?”\\n\\n Lesley had raced after him herself and that possibility had completely escaped her. Apparently it had escaped Chase, too.\\n\\n “It isn’t every man who’s willing to put his life on the line in order to help another human being,” Daisy continued.\\n\\n “If the mugger had owned a gun, he would have used it to get my purse,” Lesley said. That had just occurred to her. Now she was free once again to be furious with Chase. She didn’t want to think of him as a hero, even if he’d gotten her purse back for her. The action had been instinctive, she told herself, and nothing more.\\n\\n “I’m offering you some advice,” Daisy said.\\n\\n “Are you going to give it to me whether I want it or not?”\\n\\n “Probably.”\\n\\n “Then fire away.”\\n\\n “Don’t be so quick to judge Chase. He sounds like the decent sort to me, and more of a man than—”\\n\\n “I thought we weren’t going to discuss Tony again.”\\n\\n Daisy shook her head as if saddened by Lesley’s lack of insight into men. Her eyes brightened as she looked toward the road. “What type of car did you say Chase drives?”\\n\\n “I didn’t. Why?”\\n\\n “Because a great-looking guy just pulled up in a red car.”\\n\\n Lesley whirled around to see Chase climbing out of it. His smile was tentative as his eyes fell on her watering the lawn.\\n\\n “I haven’t come at a bad time, have I?” he called from the driveway.\\n\\n Four\\n\\n “Hey,” Daisy whispered as Chase approached, “this guy is gorgeous. You don’t happen to remember the phone number on that billboard, do you? I think I’ll apply.”\\n\\n Lesley cast her neighbor a scalding look.\\n\\n Daisy laughed, obviously considering herself amusing.\\n\\n “I take it you saw the noon news,” Chase said cautiously.\\n\\n “You mean the story about your crazy billboard? Yes, I saw it.”\\n\\n Chase took a couple of steps toward her. “Are you going to squirt me with that hose?”\\n\\n “I should.” She figured it was a credit to her upbringing that she didn’t.\\n\\n Angry shouts burst from Daisy’s house and Eric chased Kevin out the front door. Lesley’s neighbor hollered for the two boys to stop fighting. It soon became obvious that she was needed to untangle her sons.\\n\\n “Darn,” Daisy said, “and I was hoping to hear this.” She stepped forward and shook hands with Chase. “I’m Lesley’s neighbor, Daisy Sullivan. Be patient with her. She’ll come around.”\\n\\n “Daisy!” It irritated Lesley to no end that her friend was siding with Chase and worse, offering him advice on how to handle her.\\n\\n “I’ll talk to you later,” Daisy said as she hurried over to her own house.\\n\\n “I would’ve said something yesterday,” Chase told her, keeping a safe distance between them. “But you mentioned having seen the billboard yourself, remember?”\\n\\n Lesley lowered her eyes. She’d more than mentioned the billboard, she’d offered a detailed opinion of the mental state of the man who’d paid for it, never guessing it was Chase.\\n\\n “You could have told me later, after dinner,” she reminded him. “That would have been the fair thing to do.”\\n\\n Chase advanced one step. “You’re right, I should have, but it completely slipped my mind. I got so caught up in being with you that I forgot. I realize that’s a poor excuse, but it’s the truth.”\\n\\n Lesley felt herself weakening. She’d enjoyed their evening together, too. That was what hurt so much now. For the first time in months she’d been able to put aside the pain of Tony’s betrayal and have fun. Playing the role of tour guide and showing Chase the city she loved had been more than a pleasant distraction, it had freed her. But after she’d seen the noon news, all those reawakened emotions felt like a sham. Instead of anticipation, she’d suffered regret.\\n\\n “I was hoping you’d agree to see me again,” Chase said enticingly. “I’ve been meeting with women all day and I haven’t met a single one I like as much as you.”\\n\\n “Of course you like me the best,” Lesley said indignantly. “Only a crazy-woman would answer that ad.”\\n\\n Chase buried his hands in his pants pockets. “That’s what you said when you mentioned the ad, remember? You had me wondering, but, Lesley, you’re wrong. I’ve spent hours meeting with them, and that isn’t the case. Most have been pleasant and sincere.”\\n\\n “Then you should be dating them.” Her minuscule lawn was well past the point of being watered, but she persisted, drenching it. If she continued, it’d soon be swampland.\\n\\n “You’re probably right. I should be getting to know them better. But I’d rather spend my free time with you. Will you have dinner with me tonight?”\\n\\n The temptation was strong, but Lesley refused to give in to it. “I…don’t think so.”\\n\\n “Why not?”\\n\\n “Something’s come up unexpectedly.”\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “I forgot I was meeting a friend.”\\n\\n “That’s not very original, Lesley. Try again.”\\n\\n “Don’t do this,” she pleaded.\\n\\n “Where would you like to eat?”\\n\\n “I said I couldn’t.”\\n\\n “Any restaurant in town—you name it.”\\n\\n Lesley hadn’t expected him to persevere. But she could be equally stubborn. A rejection had already formed in her mind, when Chase removed the hose from her hand, putting it down. He took her by the shoulders and turned her to face him. She might’ve been able to send him away if he hadn’t touched her, but the moment he did, Lesley realized it was too late.\\n\\n She knew the exact second she surrendered; it was the same second she knew he was going to kiss her and how badly she wanted him to.\\n\\n His palms framed her face and he took her mouth greedily. Not only did Lesley allow the kiss, but she assisted him. Her hands splayed across his chest and she leaned closer. His kiss was hungry and demanding, and she clenched her fists in the fabric of his shirt as she battled against the sensations and feelings that came to life inside her. By the time it ended, Lesley knew she’d lost.\\n\\n “Do you believe in fate?” he whispered.\\n\\n “I…I don’t think so.”\\n\\n “I didn’t until I met you.”\\n\\n “Stop, Chase. Please…” She was fighting him for all she was worth and losing more ground every second he held her.\\n\\n “Dinner. That’s all I ask. One last time together and if you decide afterward that you don’t want to see me again, I’ll accept that.”\\n\\n “Promise?”\\n\\n “Cross my heart and hope to die.”\\n\\n Despite her indecision, Lesley had to laugh. That sounded like something the kids next door would say.\\n\\n “Now, where would you like to eat? Anyplace in town, just name it.”\\n\\n “Ah…”\\n\\n “The Space Needle? Canlis? Il Bistro?”\\n\\n Lesley could suggest a better way of testing a man’s character than sitting across from him in some fancy restaurant with a bevy of attentive waiters seeing to their every need.\\n\\n “I’d like to eat at Bobby’s Burgers and then play a game of golf.”\\n\\n Chase’s eyes widened. “Golf?” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-37.html","bookId":1964,"book":{"id":1964,"title":"An Engagement in Seattle","description":"Storyline: An Engagement in Seattle: Groom Wanted\\Bride Wanted (From This Day Forward #1-2) \\n Aleksandr Berinksi is a Russian biochemist in the U.S. on a visa that is about to expire.
