His silent wound, his unnoticed isolation, now understood by all, and finally, his gentle heart and act of bravery, inspired shops to close, and those who rarely came out of their homes to join with the other citizens in the largest show of support the town had ever seen. A small, silent star, always on the outskirts, hardly noticed before, had shone so brightly, that the whole town stopped to gaze upon his brilliance, to finally open their eyes enough to welcome him as part of their small constellation.\n I heard again and again that my and Archer\u0027s story made people want to be better, to reach out to those no one else saw, to be friends to the friendless, to look at others more closely, and recognize pain when they came across it, and then to do something about it if they were able.\n I walked in that cold day in February, Maggie on one arm and Norm on the other and we took our seats as people smiled kindly at me and nodded their heads. I smiled and nodded back. This was my community now too. I was part of the constellation as well.\n Outside, the rain had just begun to fall and I heard a boom of thunder in the distance. I wasn\u0027t afraid though. When a thunderstorm comes, I had told him, I\u0027ll think of you, not anything other than you. And I always did. Always.\n Archer had gone away once before–three long months where I missed him desperately every single day. This time he was gone from me for three solid weeks before he came back. He was in a deep coma and the doctors couldn\u0027t tell me when they thought he might wake up, or if he would wake up at all. But I waited. I would always wait. And I prayed and I whispered to the heavens every night, come back to me, come back to me, come back to me.\n On another rainy day at the end of January, just as the thunder boomed and the lightening flashed in his hospital room, he opened his eyes and looked at me. My own heart thundered in my ears, louder than that outside the window, and I\u0027d jumped up from the chair I\u0027d been sitting in and rushed to his side, choking out, \"You\u0027re back.\" I picked up his hands and brought them to my lips, kissing them again and again, my tears falling onto his fingers, his knuckles, those beautiful hands that held a whole language, that allowed me to know what was in his mind and his heart. I loved those hands. I loved him. My tears continued to fall.\n He\u0027d looked at me for several minutes before he brought his hands away from mine and signed slowly, his fingers moving stiffly, I\u0027m back for you.\n I laughed out a strangled cry, and put my head down on his chest and held on to him tightly as the nurses rushed into the room.\n And now, the whole town waited as Archer walked toward the podium, still stiff from the bandages surrounding his torso and the surgeries he\u0027d had to repair his internal organs.\n I looked around once more. Travis stood in the back of the room, still in uniform from his shift. I caught his eye and nodded at him. He nodded back, and smiled slightly. I still wasn\u0027t sure how I felt about Travis exactly, but he deserved my respect for his own act of heroism that awful day.\n It had recently come to light that the man who had found me that day, Jeffrey Perkins, had gotten hooked on heroin and had been cut off from his family. He\u0027d shown up at our family deli that night in need of money and a fix.\n His dealer had given over his name as part of a plea deal to save his own skin. Apparently Jeffrey had shown up that night splattered in blood and babbling about shooting a guy in a deli.\n He had started to get his act together and his father had begun to accept him back into the family fold when I had identified him in that photo lineup.\n After his arrest, his father disinherited him again and he turned back to drugs.\n Travis had confronted his mother. He was a good cop, with good instincts, and he recognized his mother for who she was–a vindictive woman so filled with hate and bitterness, that she would do anything to keep what she saw as rightfully hers–the town, money, respect, social standing.\n He had also been there when Victoria Hale overheard me talking about Jeffrey Perkins\u0027 arrest. He put the pieces together.\n What other way would a strung out heroin addict have to find me in the diner that terrible day? We had underestimated her hatred for me, the person who had, in essence, undone all that her manipulation had accomplished for her over the years.\n When Travis came to me and told me about his confrontation and her denial, a denial he didn\u0027t believe, he said he\u0027d told her to move away, or he would bring an investigation against her. Even though he knew he didn\u0027t have enough evidence to prosecute, there was nothing left for her in Pelion except shame.\n Now, with Victoria\u0027s departure and with the absence of an executor to the trust, Archer inherited the will and land of the Hale family a year before his twenty-fifth birthday.\n Travis looked haggard, unshaven, and almost numb, like he wasn\u0027t sleeping. He had had his own career in trying to manipulate lives. But after all, he had learned from the best. Deep down though, I didn\u0027t think that Travis wanted anyone to come to any real harm. His mother was a different story. I got the impression that seeing her for who she really was, and what she was capable of doing, had changed him in some dramatic way. There was a deep sadness in his eyes and he\u0027d delivered the information to me in a monotone and then left me to my grief once again as I waited in the hospital for Archer to come back to me.\n A hush fell over the auditorium as Archer walked toward the short set of stairs.\n Norm, standing off to the side, signed, Knock \u0027em dead, and raised his chin at him, his expression serious. A look of surprise washed over Archer\u0027s face and then he nodded at him. I bit down on my lip, holding back a sob.\n Mrs. Aherne, the town librarian, who had checked out hundreds of books to Archer over the last four years on subjects from masonry to sign language, but had never once asked him a single question, or tried to engage him in any way, signed, We\u0027re all behind you, Archer. Tears were shimmering in her eyes and the look on her face told me she wished she had done better. Archer smiled at her and nodded, signing back, Thank you.\n As he took the stage and stood behind the podium, he nodded at the interpreter, standing to his right, a man he had hired to help him when he needed to address the town as a whole, on occasions such as this one.\n Archer began to move his hands and the interpreter began speaking. My eyes only held Archer though, watching as his hands flew, so graceful and sure in their movements. My heart soared with pride.\n Thank you all for coming, he said, pausing and looking around. The land this town is on has been in my family for a long, long time, and I intend to run it as each Hale has run it before me–with the knowledge and belief that each person who lives here matters, that each of you get a vote on what happens and doesn\u0027t happen in Pelion. He looked around pointedly at all the faces in the crowd before continuing. After all, Pelion is not the land it sits on, but the people who walk its streets and run its shops and live and love in its homes. He paused again. I think you\u0027ll find me an agreeable landlord, and I\u0027ve been told I\u0027m a good listener. The crowd laughed lightly, and Archer looked shy for a second, looking down before continuing. There will be a vote tonight about the development slated for this town and I know some of you are very passionate about getting to that. But I\u0027d like everyone to know that if ever in the future, any of you have any concerns or suggestions, my door will always be open.\n The crowd kept watching him, smiling and nodding with approval, finding other eyes and nodding at them as well.\n Finally, Archer looked out at the crowd and the gentle, quiet murmurings ceased completely as his eyes found mine. I smiled at him encouragingly, but he just kept gazing at me for a few seconds before bringing his hands up again.\n I\u0027m here for you. I\u0027m here because of you. I\u0027m here because you saw me, not just with your eyes, but with your heart. I\u0027m here because you wanted to know what I had to say and because you were right… everyone does need friends. I laughed softly, swiping a tear off of my cheek. Archer kept gazing at me, his eyes filled with love.\n I\u0027m here because of you, he said, and I\u0027ll always be here because of you.\n I heaved out a big breath, tears running unabashedly down my cheeks now. Archer smiled gently at me and then looked back around at the crowd.\n Thank you again for being here, for your support. I look forward to getting to know you all a lot better, he finished.\n A single clap started in the back of the room, and then several more joined in until the whole room was clapping and whistling, and Archer grinned, and looked down shyly once more, and I shed a few more tears, laughing through them now. A few people stood up and more followed until the entire audience was standing and clapping vigorously for him.\n And as he smiled around at the crowd, his eyes landed on mine again, and he raised his hands and signed, I Bree you, and I laughed and signed, I Archer you. God, I Archer you so much.\n And then he shook hands with the interpreter and stepped down off the podium and I moved out of my seat, Maggie squeezing my hand as I walked by her. I walked toward him, single minded, and when we reached each other, despite the bandages under his shirt, he swept me up in his arms and swung me around as he laughed silently against my lips, those golden brown eyes filled with warmth, with love.\n And I thought to myself, Archer Hale\u0027s voice was one of the most beautiful things in the whole wide world. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/archer-s-voice/page-35.html","bookId":1846,"book":{"id":1846,"title":"Archer\u0027s Voice","description":"Storyline: \n A New York Times, USA Today, and Wall Street Journal bestselling book.
