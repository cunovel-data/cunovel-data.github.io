Most of the businesses looked to be family, or individual-owned, and large trees lined the wide sidewalks where people still strolled in the cooler, late-summer twilight. I loved this time of day. There was something magical about it, something hopeful, something that said, \"You didn\u0027t know if you could, but you made it another day, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n I spotted Haskell\u0027s and pulled into the parking lot to the right of it and pulled into a spot.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t need groceries just yet, but I was in need of a few basic necessities. It was the only reason I\u0027d run out at all. Even though I had slept five hours or so today, I was tired again and ready to settle into bed with a book.\\n\\n I was in and out of Haskell\u0027s in ten minutes, and walking back to my car in the deepening twilight. The streetlights had blinked on in the time I had been in the store, and were casting a dreamy glow over the parking lot. I pulled my purse up on my shoulder and switched the plastic bag from one hand to the other when the bottom of the plastic tore open and my purchases fell to the concrete, several items rolling away, out of my immediate reach. \"Crap!\" I swore, bending down to pick my stuff up. I opened my large purse and started tossing in the shampoo and conditioner I\u0027d picked up, when I saw someone stopped in my peripheral vision and I startled. I looked up just as a man bent down and put one knee on the asphalt and handed me the bottle of Advil that had rolled away, apparently directly into his path. I stared at him. He was young, and had shaggy, long, slightly wavy, brown hair that was in desperate need of a cut, and facial hair that looked more neglected than purposefully rugged. He might be handsome, but it was hard to make out exactly what his face looked like under the overly-long beard and hair that fell over his forehead and down around his jaw. He was wearing jeans and a blue t-shirt that was stretched across his broad chest. The t-shirt had had a message on it at some point, but now was so faded and worn away that it was anyone\u0027s guess what it had once said.\\n\\n I took all of this in in the few brief seconds it took me to reach for his extended hand holding the bottle of pain medication, at which point, our eyes met and seemed to tangle. His were deep and whiskey-colored, framed by long, dark lashes. Beautiful.\\n\\n As I stared at him, it felt like something moved between us, almost as if I should reach out and try to grab the air surrounding our bodies–like perhaps my hand would come back holding something tangible, something soft and warm. I frowned, confused, but unable to look away as his eyes quickly darted from mine. Who was this strange-looking man and why was I sitting here frozen in front of him? I shook my head slightly and snapped myself back to reality. \"Thanks,\" I said, taking the bottle from his still-outstretched hand. He said nothing, not looking at me again.\\n\\n \"Crap,\" I quietly swore once more, returning my attention to the items strewn on the ground. My eyes widened when I saw that my box of tampons had opened and several of them were lying on the ground. Kill me now. He picked up a few and handed them to me and I quickly stuffed them in my purse, glancing up at him at the same time he glanced at me, but there was no reaction on his face. Again, his eyes darted away. I felt color rising in my cheeks and tried to make small talk as he handed me a few more tampons and I snatched them and threw them in my purse, suppressing an hysterical giggle.\\n\\n \"Darn plastic bags,\" I breathed out, fast talking, then taking a deep breath before continuing, a little slower this time. \"Not only bad for the environment, but unreliable really.\" The man handed me an Almond Joy candy bar and a tampon and I took it from him and dropped it into my open purse, groaning inwardly. \"I tried to be good about using my own re-usable shopping bags. I even bought really cute ones in fun patterns… paisley, polka dot,\" I shook my head, stuffing the last tampon on the ground in my purse, \"but I was always leaving them in my car, or at home,\" I shook my head again as the man handed me two more Almond Joy candy bars.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I said. \"I think I\u0027ve got the rest of this.\" I waved my hand over the four remaining Almond Joy candy bars lying on the ground.\\n\\n I looked up at him, my cheeks heating again. \"They were on sale,\" I explained. \"I wasn\u0027t planning on eating these all at once or anything.\" He didn\u0027t look at me as he picked them up himself, but I swore I saw a miniscule lip twitch. I blinked and it was gone. I squinted at him, taking the candy bars from his hand. \"I just like to keep chocolate around the house, you know, for a treat once in a while. This here should last me a couple months.\" I was lying. What I had bought would last me a couple days, if that. I might even eat several of them on the car ride home.\\n\\n The man stood and so did I, lifting my purse over my shoulder. \"Okay, well, thanks for the help, for rescuing me… and my… personal items… my chocolate, and coconut… and almonds…\" I laughed a small, embarrassed sound, but then grimaced slightly. \"You know, it would really help me out if you would speak and put me out of my misery here.\" I grinned at him, but immediately went serious as his face fell, his eyes shuttering and a blank look replacing the warmer one I had sworn was there moments before.\\n\\n He turned and started walking away.\\n\\n \"Hey, wait!\" I called, starting to step after him. I stopped myself though, frowning as he moved away from me, his body moving with grace as he started to jog slowly toward the street. The strangest feeling of loss washed over me as he crossed and walked out of sight.\\n\\n I got in my car and sat there unmoving for a couple minutes, wondering at the odd encounter. When I finally started the engine, I noticed that there was something on my windshield. I went to turn on the spray, when I stopped and leaned forward, looking more closely. Dandelion seeds were scattered across the glass, and as a light breeze blew, the fluffy ends were caught in the moving air and danced delicately off my windshield as they took flight, moving away from me, in the direction the man had gone.\\n\\n I woke up early the next morning, got out of bed, and pulled up the shades in my bedroom and stared out at the lake, the morning sun reflecting on it, making it a warm, golden color. A large bird took up flight and I could just make out one singular boat in the water, close to the distant shore. Yeah, I could get used to this.\\n\\n Phoebe jumped off the bed and came to sit by my feet. \"What do you think, girl?\" I whispered. She yawned.\\n\\n I took a deep breath, trying to center myself. \"Not this morning,\" I whispered. \"This morning you\u0027re okay.\" I walked slowly toward the shower, relaxing minimally, hope blooming in my chest with each step. But as I turned on the spray, the world around me blinked out and the shower became the sound of rain, beating on the roof. Dread seized me and I froze as a loud clap of thunder pounded in my ears and the feel of cold metal moved across my bare breast. I flinched at the jerkiness of the gun tracing my nipple, the cold making it pebble as the tears flowed faster down my cheeks. Inside my head sounded like the high-pitched shriek of a train screeching to a stop on metal rails. Oh God, Oh God. I held my breath, just waiting for the gun to go off, ice-cold terror flowing through my veins. I tried to think of my dad lying in his own blood in the room beyond, but my own fear was so all-consuming that I couldn\u0027t focus on anything else. I began to shake uncontrollably, the rain continuing to beat against the–\\n\\n A car door slammed outside, snapping me back to the here and now. I was standing in front of the running shower, water puddling on the floor where the curtain was open. Vomit rushed up my throat and I turned just in time to make it to the bowl where I heaved up bile. I sat there gasping and shaking for several minutes, trying to get a hold of my body. The tears threatened to come, but I wouldn\u0027t let them. I squeezed my eyes shut and counted backwards from one hundred. When I made it to one, I took another deep breath and stumbled to my feet, grabbing a towel to mop up the growing puddle in front of the open shower.\\n\\n I stripped off my clothes and stepped under the warm spray, leaning my head back and closing my eyes, trying to relax and come back to the present, trying to get the shaking under control.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re okay, you\u0027re okay, you\u0027re okay,\" I chanted, swallowing down the emotion, the guilt, my body still trembling slightly. I would be okay. I knew that, but it always took a little while to shake the feeling of being back there, in that place, in that moment of utter grief and terror, and then sometimes several hours before the sadness left me, but never completely.\\n\\n Every morning the flashback came, and every evening I felt stronger again. Each dawn I had hope that this new day would be the one that would set me free, and that I would make it through without having to endure the pain of being chained in grief to the night that would forever separate now from then.\\n\\n I stepped out of the shower and dried off. Looking at myself in the mirror, I thought I looked better than I did most mornings. Despite the fact that the flashbacks hadn\u0027t ended here, I had slept well, which I hadn\u0027t done much of over the past six months, and felt a sense of contentment that I attributed to the lake outside my window. What was more peaceful than the sound of water lapping gently on a sandy shore? Surely some of that would seep into my soul, or at the very least, help me get some much-needed sleep.\\n\\n I went back to my bedroom and pulled on a pair of khaki shorts and a black button-up shirt with cap sleeves. I was planning on going into the diner in town that Anne had mentioned and wanted to look presentable since I\u0027d be asking about the–hopefully still available–job. I was running low on money. I needed one as quickly as possible.\\n\\n I blew my hair dry and left it down and then put on a minimum of makeup. I pulled on my black sandals and was out the door, the warm, morning air caressing my skin as I stepped outside and locked up.\\n\\n Ten minutes later, I was pulling up to the curb outside of Norm\u0027s. It looked like a classic, small town diner. I looked in the big, glass window and saw that it was already half full on a Monday morning at eight a.m. The Help Wanted sign was still in the window. Yes!\\n\\n I opened the door and the smell of coffee and bacon greeted me, the sounds of chatter and soft laughter coming from the booths and tables.\\n\\n I walked toward the front and took a seat at the counter, next to two young women in cutoff jean shorts and tank tops–obviously not part of those stopping in for breakfast on their way to the office.\\n\\n As I took a seat on the rotating, red, vinyl covered stool, the woman now sitting next to me looked at me and smiled.\\n\\n \"Good morning,\" I said and smiled back.\\n\\n \"Good morning!\" she said.\\n\\n I picked up the menu in front of me and a waitress, an older woman with short gray hair, standing at the kitchen window, looked over her shoulder at me and said, \"I\u0027ll be right with you, honey.\" She looked harried as she flipped through her order pad. The place was only half full, but she was obviously alone and having trouble keeping up. Morning crowds were always looking for rush service so they could make it to work on time.\\n\\n \"No rush,\" I said.\\n\\n A few minutes later when she had delivered a couple meals and came up to me, she said distractedly, \"Coffee?\"\\n\\n \"Please. And you look slammed–I\u0027ll make it easy on you and have the number three–just as it comes.\"\\n\\n \"Bless you, honey.\" She laughed. \"You must have experience waitressing.\"\\n\\n \"Actually,\" I smiled and handed her the menu, \"I do, and I know this isn\u0027t a good time, but I saw the Help Wanted sign in the window.\"\\n\\n \"Seriously?\" she said, \"When can you start?\"\\n\\n I laughed. \"As soon as possible. I can come back later to fill out an application or–\"\\n\\n \"No need. You have waitressing experience, you need a job, you\u0027re hired. Come back later to fill out the necessary paperwork, but Norm\u0027s my husband. I have the authority to hire another waitress and I just hired you.\" She held out her hand. \"Maggie Jansen, by the way.\"\\n\\n I grinned at her. \"Bree Prescott. Thank you so much!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the one who just made my morning better,\" she called as she went down the counter to refill the other coffee cups.\\n\\n Well, that was the easiest interview I\u0027d ever had.\\n\\n \"New in town?\" the young woman next to me asked.\\n\\n I turned to her, smiling. \"Yes, just moved here yesterday, actually.\"\\n\\n \"Well, welcome to Pelion. I\u0027m Melanie Scholl and this is my sister, Liza.\" The girl on the right of her leaned forward and extended her hand.\\n\\n I shook it, saying, \"Really nice to meet you.\"\\n\\n I noticed the bathing suit ties sticking out of the back of their tank tops and said, \"Are you vacationing here?\"\\n\\n \"Oh no,\" Melanie laughed, \"we work on the other shore. We\u0027re lifeguards for the next couple weeks while the tourists are here and then we go back to work at our family\u0027s pizza parlor during the winter.\"\\n\\n I nodded, sipping my coffee. I thought they looked about my age, Liza most likely the younger one. They looked similar with their reddish brown hair and the same large, blue eyes.\\n\\n \"If you have any questions about this town, you just ask us,\" Liza said. \"We make it our business to know all the dirt.\" She winked. \"We can tell you who to date, too, and who to avoid. We\u0027ve pretty much run through them all in both towns–we\u0027re a wealth of information.\"\\n\\n I laughed. \"Okay, I\u0027ll keep that in mind. I\u0027m really glad I met you girls.\" I started to turn forward when something occurred to me. \"Hey, actually, I have a question about someone. I dropped some stuff in the pharmacy parking lot last night and a young man stopped to help me. Tall, lean, good build, but… I don\u0027t know, he didn\u0027t say a word… and he had this long beard–\"\\n\\n \"Archer Hale,\" Melanie broke in. \"I\u0027m shocked he stopped to help you though. He doesn\u0027t usually pay anyone any attention.\" She paused. \"And no one usually pays him any attention either, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know if he had too much of a choice,\" I said. \"My stuff literally rolled right in front of his feet.\"\\n\\n Melanie shrugged. \"Still unusual. Trust me. Anyway, I think he\u0027s deaf. That\u0027s why he doesn\u0027t speak. He was in some kind of accident when he was a kid. We were just five and six when it happened, right outside town, on the highway. His parents were killed, and the town Police Chief, his uncle. That\u0027s when he lost his hearing, I guess. He lives at the end of Briar Road–he used to live with his other uncle who home-schooled him, but that uncle died a couple years back and now he lives by himself out there. He never even used to come into town until his uncle died. Now we see him every once in a while. He\u0027s a total loner though.\"\\n\\n \"Wow,\" I said, frowning, \"that\u0027s so sad.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Liza chimed in, \"because, have you seen the body on him? Of course, runs in the genes. If he wasn\u0027t so anti-social, I\u0027d do him.\"\\n\\n Melanie rolled her eyes and I put my hand up to my lips so coffee wouldn\u0027t spew out of my mouth.\\n\\n \"Please, you hooker,\" Melanie said, \"you\u0027d do him anyway, if he\u0027d look your way once.\"\\n\\n Liza considered that for a second and then shook her head. \"I doubt he\u0027d even know what to do with that body of his. A true shame.\" Melanie rolled her eyes again and then glanced up at the clock above the order window.\\n\\n \"Oh darn, we gotta go or we\u0027re gonna be late.\" She took out her wallet and called to Maggie, \"I\u0027m leaving the bill on the counter, Mags.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, hon,\" Maggie called back as she walked quickly by, holding two plates.\\n\\n Melanie scribbled something down on a napkin and handed it to me. \"Here\u0027s our number,\" she said. \"We\u0027re planning a girl\u0027s night on the other side of the lake soon. Maybe you\u0027d like to come with us?\"\\n\\n I took the napkin. \"Oh, okay, well, maybe.\" I smiled. I scribbled my number down on a napkin and handed her mine as well. \"Thanks so much. That\u0027s really nice of you.\" I was surprised by how much my mood was boosted after talking to the two girls my age. Maybe that\u0027s what I need, I thought, to remember that I was a person with friends and a life before tragedy struck. It was so easy to feel like my whole existence began and ended that terrible day. But that wasn\u0027t true. I needed to remind myself of that as much as possible.\\n\\n Of course, my friends back home had tried to get me to go out a few times in the months following my dad\u0027s death, but I just hadn\u0027t been up for it. Maybe going out with people who weren\u0027t so acquainted with my tragedy would be better–after all, wasn\u0027t that what this road trip was about? A temporary escape? The hope that a new place would bring new healing? And then I would have the strength to face my life again.\\n\\n Liza and Melanie walked quickly out the door, calling and waving to a few other people sitting in the restaurant. After a minute, Maggie set my plate down in front of me.\\n\\n As I ate, I considered what they had said about the guy named Archer Hale. It made sense now–he was deaf. I wondered why that hadn\u0027t already occurred to me. That\u0027s why he hadn\u0027t spoken. Obviously, he could read lips. And I had completely insulted him when I made the comment about him saying something. That\u0027s why his face had fallen and he had walked away like that. I cringed inwardly. \"Nice one, Bree,\" I said quietly as I bit off a piece of toast.\\n\\n I\u0027d make it a point to apologize next time I saw him. I wondered if he knew sign language. I\u0027d let him know I could speak it if he wanted to talk to me. I knew it well. My dad had been deaf.\\n\\n Something about Archer Hale intrigued me–something I couldn\u0027t put my finger on. Something that went beyond the fact that he couldn\u0027t hear or speak and that I was intimately acquainted with that particular disability. I pondered it for a minute, but couldn\u0027t come up with an answer.\\n\\n I finished my meal and Maggie waved me off when I asked for my check. \"Employee\u0027s eat for free,\" she called, refilling coffee down the counter from me. \"Come back in anytime after two to fill out the paperwork.\"\\n\\n I grinned at her. \"Okay,\" I said. \"See you this afternoon.\" I left a tip on the counter and headed out the door. Not bad, I thought. Only in town one day and I\u0027ve got a home, a job, and a sort of friend in my neighbor, Anne, and maybe in Melanie and Liza too. There was an extra spring in my step as I walked to my car. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/archer-s-voice/page-3.html","bookId":1846,"book":{"id":1846,"title":"Archer\u0027s Voice","description":"Storyline: A New York Times, USA Today, and Wall Street Journal bestselling book.
