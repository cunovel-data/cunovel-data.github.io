My Bree. I\u0027d missed her so desperately I\u0027d thought I\u0027d die without her those first few weeks. But I hadn\u0027t died. I had so much to tell her, so much to share with her.\\n\\n I leaned back, looking down into her emerald eyes, the golden flecks that I loved so much even brighter under her shimmering tears. She was stunning. And I hoped to God that she was still mine.\\n\\n I don\u0027t really know how to dance, I said, unable to tear my eyes from her.\\n\\n She breathed out on a small smile. I\u0027m not very good at it either.\\n\\n I took her in my arms anyway and held her against my body as we started to sway to the music. We\u0027d figure it out.\\n\\n I ran my hand down the bare skin of her back and she shivered in my arms. We both watched as I used my other hand to entwine my fingers with hers, my eyes moving quickly to her face. She swallowed and her lips parted as she met my gaze.\\n\\n I pulled her closer and pressed her body into mine feeling serenity wash over me.\\n\\n When the song ended, we both stood back and Bree asked, Is this real?\\n\\n I smiled at her. I don\u0027t know. I think so. But it feels like a dream.\\n\\n She breathed out a small laugh and looked down, then back up at me. How\u0027d you know I was here?\\n\\n I went to your house, I signed. Anne saw me and told me where you were.\\n\\n She reached up and put her hand on my cheek as if she was checking to make sure I was really there, and I closed my eyes and leaned in to her. After a second, she brought her hand down and signed to me, Where have you been, Archer? What have you been–\\n\\n I put my hands around hers, stopping her words, and she blinked up at me in surprise. I let go of her and brought my hands up. I have so much to tell you, so much we have to talk about.\\n\\n Do you still love me? she asked and her vulnerable eyes blinked up at me again, fresh tears filling them. Her whole heart was right there in her expression and I loved her so desperately, I felt it in the marrow of my bones.\\n\\n I\u0027ll never stop loving you, Bree, I said, hoping she could see in my eyes that I meant it in my very soul, in the very fabric of who I was.\\n\\n She studied my face for a few seconds, and then she looked down for a few beats before her eyes came up and she focused on my chest as she said, You left me.\\n\\n I had to, I answered.\\n\\n Her eyes ran over my face, studying me intently. Take me home, Archer, she said and I didn\u0027t need to be asked twice. I took her by her hand and started moving through the crowd I had forgotten was there.\\n\\n When we stepped out into the chilly night air, Bree said, \"Wait, Melanie and Liza–\"\\n\\n They saw me, I signed, they\u0027ll know you left with me.\\n\\n She nodded.\\n\\n The valet brought my truck around, looking completely out of place amongst the BMW\u0027s and Audi\u0027s. That was okay. I had Bree Prescott on my arm, and I intended to keep her there.\\n\\n I grinned at her as I started up the truck. Just as I was pulling away, it backfired, making the people standing around us jump and scream, one woman in a mink stole hitting the ground. They must have thought someone opened fire. I grimaced and waved my hand at them in apology.\\n\\n As we drove away, I glanced at Bree who was biting her lip and obviously trying to hold back laughter. She glanced at me and I glanced at her, and then we both looked straight. After a couple seconds she glanced at me again and threw her head back and started laughing wildly. My eyes widened and then I couldn\u0027t help it, I cracked up too, grinning and laughing along with her, while simultaneously trying to keep my eyes on the road.\\n\\n She laughed so hard tears were rolling down her cheeks, and I was gripping my chest, trying to get control of the hilarity that seemed to have taken us over.\\n\\n After several seconds, I glanced over and her face suddenly went from hilarity to crumbling into a bout of tears. My laughter died and I glanced at her nervously, wondering what the hell had just happened.\\n\\n I put my hand on her leg and she swiped it away, crying harder, looking as if she was having trouble catching her breath. Panic coursed through me. What was happening here? I didn\u0027t know what to do.\\n\\n \"You were gone for three months, Archer. Three months!\" she choked out, her voice fading on the last word. \"You didn\u0027t write. You didn\u0027t bring your phone. I didn\u0027t know if you were even alive. I didn\u0027t know if you were warm. I didn\u0027t know how you were communicating with those you needed to communicate with.\" She let out another sob.\\n\\n I glanced at her and pulled the car off the road, onto a small dirt patch next to the bank of a river. I turned to Bree just as she opened my truck door and jumped out, walking quickly along the side of the road in her little, black dress. What the hell was she doing? I jumped out too and jogged to catch up, gravel crunching beneath my feet as Bree wobbled ahead of me on her high heels.\\n\\n The moon, large and full above us, lit the night so that I could see her clearly in front of me.\\n\\n When I finally made it to her, I grabbed her arm and she stopped and spun around, tears still coursing down her cheeks. Don\u0027t run from me, I said. I can\u0027t call to you. Please don\u0027t run from me.\\n\\n \"You ran from me!\" she said. \"You ran from me, and I died a little more each day! You didn\u0027t even let me know that you were safe! Why?\"\\n\\n Her voice broke on the last word and I felt my heart clench in my chest. I couldn\u0027t, Bree. If I had written to you, or contacted you, I wouldn\u0027t have been able to stay away. And I had to stay away, Bree. I had to. You\u0027re my safety, and I had to do this without feeling safe. I had to.\\n\\n She stood there silently for several minutes, her eyes on my still hands, not looking up into my face. We were both shivering, our breath coming out in white puffs.\\n\\n I suddenly understood. Bree had been holding in the emotion of my absence for three long months, and my return had opened the floodgates. I knew what it felt like when emotion bubbling to the surface made you feel sick, out of control–I knew better than anyone. It\u0027s why I had gone away. But now, I was back. And now it was my turn to be strong for Bree. Now, I was finally able.\\n\\n Come back to the truck. Please. Let me get you warm and then we\u0027ll talk.\\n\\n \"Were there other women?\"\\n\\n I shook my head and breathed out, looking down at my feet, then back up at her. I leaned in and \"spoke\" with my hands right against her body, looking into her eyes as she glanced between my face and my hands. There has only ever been you. There. Will. Only. Ever. Be. You.\\n\\n She closed her eyes and fresh tears rolled down her cheeks. She opened them and we both stood there silently, our breath dissipating as it rose into the sky.\\n\\n \"I thought,\" she shook her head slowly, \"I thought maybe you figured out that you were lonely,\" she heaved in a big breath, \"and that you would have fallen in love with any girl who walked down your driveway that day–that maybe you needed to find out.\" She looked down.\\n\\n I took her chin in my fingers and tilted her face back up to me. I brought my hand down and said, There\u0027s nothing to find out. What I know, is that you walked through my gate that day and I lost my heart. But not because it could have been any girl–because it was you. I lost my heart to you. And, Bree, in case you\u0027re wondering, I don\u0027t ever want it back.\\n\\n She closed her eyes again and then opened them and I saw her body relax.\\n\\n \"What were you doing?\" she finally asked quietly, hugging herself with her bare arms.\\n\\n Please let me get you warm, I repeated, holding out my hand to her.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t say anything, but she took my hand and we walked back to my truck together. When we reached it, I helped her up and then walked around to my side and climbed in as well, turning to her.\\n\\n I looked out the window behind her for a second, thinking of all the things I\u0027d done in the last three months, answering the question she had asked me outside. I went to restaurants, coffee shops… I went to the movies once. I smiled a small smile and her eyes flew to my face.\\n\\n She blinked at me, her tears drying up. \"You did?\" she whispered. I nodded.\\n\\n Her eyes searched my face for several seconds before she asked. \"What\u0027d you see?\"\\n\\n Thor, I spelled out.\\n\\n She laughed softly and the sound was like music to my ears. \"Did you like it?\"\\n\\n I loved it. I sat through it twice. I even ordered popcorn and a drink, even though there was a line of people behind me.\\n\\n \"How\u0027d you do it?\" She looked at me with wide eyes.\\n\\n I had to point and gesture a little, but the kid got it. He was nice. I paused for a minute. I had this realization about a month after I\u0027d been gone. Whenever I went somewhere and had to communicate with someone, and they\u0027d see my scar and understand why I was gesturing, they each had a different reaction. Some people were awkward, uncomfortable, others were kind, helpful, and there were even some that were impatient and put-out. Bree\u0027s eyes softened and she was listening to me raptly.\\n\\n I realized that people\u0027s reactions had more to do with them, more to do with who they were, than anything about me. It was like a bolt of lightening hit me, Bree.\\n\\n Tears sprung to her eyes again and she reached out and touched my leg, just laying her hand on me.\\n\\n She nodded. \"It was like that with my dad too. What else?\" she asked.\\n\\n I got a job, I smiled and a look of surprise came over her face. I nodded. Yeah, I stopped in this small town in New York state and I saw an ad about needing guys to unload delivery trucks at the airport. I wrote a letter about my situation, explaining that I could hear and understand directions and that I was a hard worker, but that I couldn\u0027t speak. I handed it to the guy in person and he read it and hired me on the spot. I grinned with the memory of the pride I had felt in that moment.\\n\\n It was boring work, but I got to know another guy there, Luis, and he spoke incessantly, telling me his life story while we worked. How he had come over from Mexico without knowing the language at all, how he still struggled to support his family, but that they were happy, they had each other. He talked a lot. I got the impression that no one had ever just listened to him. I smiled with the memory of my first real friend other than Bree.\\n\\n He invited me to his home for Christmas dinner and his little girl learned a few signs before I got there, and I taught her a few more. I smiled, thinking of little Claudia. She asked me the sign for love and I spelled out your name.\\n\\n Bree let out small sound, somewhere between a laugh and a sob. \"So now she\u0027s going to go around saying, \u0027I Bree you?\u0027\" she asked, smiling softly.\\n\\n I nodded. Yeah. I turned toward her more fully, focusing on her face. I stand by my logic though. I think love is a concept, and each person has an individual word for what sums it up for them. My word for love is Bree.\\n\\n We stared at each other for several beats, me drinking in her beauty, her sweet compassion. I had known that about her before, but not to the extent I did now.\\n\\n Finally, she asked me, \"What made you decide it was time to come home?\"\\n\\n I looked at her for a couple seconds, considering her question. I was sitting in this small coffee shop a couple days ago and I saw this old man sitting at a table across from me. He looked so lonely, so sad. I was too, but it suddenly occurred to me that some people go through their whole lives never being loved or loving as deeply as I love you. There\u0027s always going to be the chance that I could lose you in this lifetime. There\u0027s nothing any of us can do about the possibility of loss. But in that moment, I decided that I was more interested in focusing on the great privilege I\u0027ve been given in having you at all.\\n\\n Tears shimmered in her eyes again as she whispered, \"And what if I hadn\u0027t been here when you got back?\"\\n\\n Then I would have come for you. I would have fought for you. But don\u0027t you see, I had to fight for myself first. I had to feel like I was someone worthy of winning you.\\n\\n She stared at me for a second, more tears coming into her eyes. \"How\u0027d you get so brilliant?\" she asked, letting out a small, breathy laugh and a small sniffle.\\n\\n I was already brilliant. I just needed some world experience. I needed Thor.\\n\\n She let out another small laugh and then grinned at me. You being funny?\\n\\n I grinned back at her, noting that she was finally using her hands to speak. No, I never joke about Thor.\\n\\n She laughed and then looked at me silently again, her face going serious.\\n\\n Mine went serious too and I asked, Why did you stay, Bree? Tell me.\\n\\n She breathed out, looking down at her hands in her lap for a second. Finally, she brought them up and said, Because I love you. Because I\u0027d wait for you forever. She gazed into my eyes, her beauty taking my breath away again. Take me home, Archer, she said.\\n\\n My heart soared as I started up the truck and pulled back onto the road. We drove the rest of the way in comfortable silence. When we were almost there, Bree reached her hand out for mine and we held hands between us for the remainder of the ride.\\n\\n I pulled up in front of my house and we walked through the gate and down to my front door, not saying a word.\\n\\n When we got inside and she turned to me, I said, You kept my house clean.\\n\\n She looked around as if she was just remembering, and then nodded.\\n\\n Why? I asked.\\n\\n She seemed to consider. Because doing it made me feel like you were coming back, like you\u0027d be home soon.\\n\\n My heart squeezed tightly. I\u0027m sorry, Bree.\\n\\n She shook her head and looked up at me with wide, vulnerable eyes. Don\u0027t leave me again, please.\\n\\n I shook my head and moved closer to her. Never again, I said and then took her in my arms. She lifted her mouth to mine and I pressed my lips to hers, silently moaning at the taste of her as I slipped my tongue into her mouth. I couldn\u0027t help the shiver that ran through my body as the taste of peaches and Bree exploded on my tongue. My cock stiffened immediately and I pressed it in to her. She sighed into my mouth and impossibly, I got harder. It felt like a lifetime since I\u0027d been inside of her.\\n\\n She tore her mouth from mine and said, \"I missed you so much, Archer. So much.\"\\n\\n I let go of her for a second and signed, I missed you too, Bree. So much.\\n\\n I started lowering my mouth to hers again when she brought her hand up to my hair and said, \"It\u0027s longer. I\u0027m going to have to give you another haircut.\" She grinned. \"Maybe you won\u0027t throw me out of your house when I try to molest you this time.\"\\n\\n I chuckled silently and then grinned and brought my hands up. Chances are good that I won\u0027t. Also, Bree, I\u0027m going to stop talking now and use my hands for other things, okay?\\n\\n Her eyes widened, her lips parting slightly as she whispered, \"Okay.\"\\n\\n I scooped her up and carried her down the short hallway to my bedroom and stood her up right next to my bed.\\n\\n I kicked off my shoes, unknotted my tie, and started unbuttoning my dress shirt as she kicked off her heels and turned around for me to unzip her dress.\\n\\n I brought the zipper down slowly, exposing more and more of her skin. Her tan lines were gone now and her skin was creamy and lighter than it was the last time I\u0027d seen all of her. She was so beautiful. And mine, all mine. A deep satisfaction filled me and the desperation I felt to be inside of her ratcheted up another level.\\n\\n She turned back to me and let her small, black dress fall and pool at her feet. My cock pulsated as she looked up at me through her lashes, her pink lips parting.\\n\\n I reached down and removed my socks, and then stood back up and undid my belt and unbuttoned my pants and let them fall to the floor where I kicked them off. Bree licked her lips and looked down at my straining erection and then back up into my face. Her eyes were shiny and dilated.\\n\\n I reached for her and unhooked her strapless bra and let it fall to the floor. I felt a drop of pre-cum bead on my tip as I took in her perfect breasts, the pink nipples already pebbled and begging for my mouth.\\n\\n I looked behind her and nodded my head, indicating the bed, and Bree sat down and laid back as I came down on top of her, skin to skin. Her heat caressed me, sending bolts of pure arousal down my spine and her eyes told me I was loved. I was loved by the beautiful woman lying beneath me, ready to invite me into her body.\\n\\n All the times I had made love to her before, my head had always screamed, Mine! desperately, but now it felt like a gentle acknowledgement, a comforting truth. Mine, mine, always mine.\\n\\n I leaned my head down and took a nipple into my mouth, laving it with my tongue as Bree moaned and pressed her hips up into my hardness. Oh God that felt good. The taste of her, the feel of her hot, silky skin beneath me, the knowledge that I was going to sink into her tight heat soon… but not too soon. I wanted this to last.\\n\\n I sucked and licked her nipples for several minutes as she ran her fingers through my hair, tugging gently. My body pressed into her belly of its own accord, trying to ease the intense throbbing in my cock.\\n\\n Bree arched her back and moaned deeply, \"Archer, oh God, please,\" she breathed out.\\n\\n I reached a hand down to her folds and felt the slippery liquid that meant that she was ready for me, more than ready for me. I brought some of it from her opening to her * and massaged it gently in slow circles as Bree panted. \"Oh God, Archer, please, I\u0027ll come and I don\u0027t want to. I want to come with you inside me. Please.\"\\n\\n I leaned up and took her mouth again, her tongue dancing with mine, soft and wet and unbelievably delicious. I\u0027d never get enough of her mouth, of her.\\n\\n I took myself in my hand and lined the straining head of my cock up at her entrance and pushed inside, sinking in fully on one deep thrust. I closed my eyes at the exquisite feel of her surrounding me so tightly and just stayed still for several beats.\\n\\n Bree pressed up into me, silently asking me to move and so I did, her extreme wetness making it easy to glide in and out. The tight friction was bliss beyond words.\\n\\n At first I went slowly, the relief at being inside of her so intense that I never wanted this moment to end. But after a minute, my own body demanded that I move and so I picked up the speed of my thrusts.\\n\\n Bree moaned out and said breathily, \"Yes,\" and closed her eyes, pressing her head back on the pillow. Mine, mine, always mine, my mind sang as I pumped into her and watched her beautiful, pleasure filled expression, her hair splayed out all around her on the white pillowcase, like a goddess, an angel, her small, white breasts bouncing with my movement.\\n\\n I pumped into her, holding myself up with my arms as she panted and whimpered in pleasure. I brought one arm under the back of her right knee and pulled her leg up so that I could go deeper and she moaned again, grabbing my ass with her fingernails. God I liked that.\\n\\n After a few minutes, Bree\u0027s cheeks flushed, the sign of her impending climax, I knew from experience, and she opened her eyes.\\n\\n Her hands moved to my straining biceps and she ran her hands up and down them as her eyes clouded over and her lips formed a silent o, right before I felt her muscles clench even tighter on my shaft and begin to convulse. She gasped out and arched up into me as that beautiful expression of satisfaction rolled over her face, and she moaned out softly as her body relaxed.\\n\\n She looked up at me dreamily as I continued to thrust into her and said softly, \"I love you.\"\\n\\n I love you, I mouthed and then closed my eyes as I felt the first tingles along my spine. I came up on my knees, and reached under Bree, grabbing her ass and tilting her hips up so I could go even deeper than before. I was thrusting into her hard and fast now, the pleasure spiraling higher and higher.\\n\\n \"Oh God!\" Bree gasped out, pressing up into me as I watched another orgasm roll through her. Her eyes popped open and she looked at me with round eyes. I would have smiled at her look of shock, but the pleasure that was circling through my abdomen, tightening my balls and making my cock strain and thicken with my impending orgasm, was so intense that I was almost out of control.\\n\\n I thrust into her, once, twice and then my world exploded into a million points of light, the air itself seeming to shimmer around me as ecstasy, deep and intense, raced through my body, my cock jerking inside of her as I climaxed.\\n\\n When I came back to myself, Bree was still gazing up at me with a look of wonder on her face. I could only imagine that I was wearing the exact same look. I pulled out of her, taking my semi-hard cock in my hand and using it to rub my cum, now running out of her up and over her * and around her folds.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure why I did that, it was almost instinct, nothing I actually thought about. But I was mesmerized by what we\u0027d just shared, and the visual of her and I together and the proof of my pleasure all over her excited me, made me feel a peaceful possessiveness that I loved.\\n\\n I looked back at Bree and her face had softened and she looked sleepy and content, her eyes hooded, her expression still filled with love.\\n\\n I took my hand off of myself and signed, I love you.\\n\\n She smiled at me and reached her arms up and pulled me to her, stroking her fingers up and down my back until I felt like I was in danger of falling asleep right on top of her. I kissed her lips quickly and then stood up and pulled her with me to the bathroom where we showered and washed each other, not sexual this time, just loving, tender.\\n\\n When we were done, we dried off and returned to my bed and climbed under the sheets, naked. I pulled her to me and held her there, feeling content and happier than I\u0027d ever felt in my entire life.\\n\\n I turned her around to face me and brought my hands up, Someday, I said, when we\u0027re old and gray, I\u0027m going to look at you lying in bed beside me, just like this, and I\u0027m going to look into your eyes and know that it\u0027s only ever been you. And that is going to be the great joy of my life, Bree Prescott. She smiled as her eyes filled up with what I knew were happy tears and I pulled her into my chest, holding her tight, breathing her in.\\n\\n Just a little bit later, I came to for a brief second when I heard fireworks in the distance. I sleepily realized that it was midnight, a brand new year, a brand new start. I pulled my beautiful girl closer against me as she sighed out in her sleep, and I closed my eyes. I was home. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/archer-s-voice/page-32.html","bookId":1846,"book":{"id":1846,"title":"Archer\u0027s Voice","description":"Storyline: A New York Times, USA Today, and Wall Street Journal bestselling book.
