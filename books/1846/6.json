{"id":77373,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"CHAPTER 6 Archer – 7 years old, May Where was I? I felt like I was swimming upwards in the pool at the YMCA, the top of the water miles and miles away. Noises started up in my ears and there was a pain in my neck, almost like a really bad sore throat that was both on the inside and the outside. I tried to remember how I\u0027d gotten hurt, but only shadows moved around my head. I pushed them away. Where was I? Mama? I wanted my mama. I felt the tears, hot and heavy, leak out of my closed eyes, down my cheeks. I tried not to cry. Strong men shouldn\u0027t cry. Strong men should protect others, like my uncle Connor. Only he had cried. He had cried so hard, yelling up at the sky and falling to his knees right there on the pavement. Oh no. Oh no. Don\u0027t think about that. I tried to move my body, but it felt like someone had tied weights to my arms and legs, even my fingers and toes. I thought I might be moving just a little, but I wasn\u0027t sure. I heard a woman\u0027s voice say, \"Shhh, he\u0027s waking up. Let him do it slowly. Let him do it himself.\" Mama, mama. Please be here too. Please be okay. Please don\u0027t be lying on the side of the road. More warm tears slipped out of my eyes. My entire body suddenly felt like hot pins and needles were being stuck in my skin. I tried to yell for help but I didn\u0027t even think I parted my lips. Oh God, the pain seemed to be waking up everywhere, like a monster coming alive in the dark under my bed. After a few minutes of just breathing, just coming closer and closer to what I could feel was the surface, I opened my eyelids, squinting because there was a bright light right above me. \"Turn down the light, Meredith,\" I heard to my left. I opened my eyes again, letting them get used to the light and saw an older nurse with short, blond hair looking down at me. I opened my lips. \"Mama\" I tried to say, but nothing came out. \"Shhh,\" the nurse said, \"don\u0027t try to talk, honey. You were in an accident. You\u0027re in the hospital, Archer, and we\u0027re taking real good care of you, okay? My name is Jenny and that\u0027s Meredith.\" She smiled sadly and pointed to a younger nurse behind her, checking something on the machine next to my bed. I nodded my head. Where was my mama? More tears fell down my cheeks. \"Okay, good boy,\" Jenny said. \"Your uncle Nathan is right outside. Let me go get him. He\u0027ll be real happy you\u0027re awake.\" I lay there staring up at the ceiling for a few minutes before the door opened and shut and Uncle Nate was looking down into my face. \"Welcome back, little soldier,\" he said. His eyes had red all around them and he looked like he hadn\u0027t showered in a while. But Uncle Nate always looked a little weird in some way or another. Some days he had his shirt inside out, others he was wearing two different shoes. I thought it was funny. He told me that it was because his brain was so busy working on more important stuff, he didn\u0027t have time to think about whether his clothes were put on right. I thought that was a good answer. Plus, he slipped me good stuff like candy and ten-dollar bills. He told me to start a stash somewhere no one could find my money. He said I\u0027d thank him later and gave me a wink like I\u0027d know what \"later\" was when it came. I opened my mouth again, but Jenny and Uncle Nate both shook their heads and Jenny reached for something on the table next to her. She turned around with a pad and a pencil and handed it to me. I took it from her and brought it up, writing one word: MAMA? Jenny\u0027s eyes moved away from that word and Uncle Nate looked down at his feet. Right in that moment, the whole accident came screaming back into my brain–pictures and words pounding through my mind so that I slammed my head back on the pillow and clamped my teeth together. I opened my mouth and screamed and screamed and screamed, but the room remained silent.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/archer-s-voice/page-6.html","bookId":1846,"book":{"id":1846,"title":"Archer\u0027s Voice","description":"Storyline: A New York Times, USA Today, and Wall Street Journal bestselling book.
