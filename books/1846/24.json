I had just gotten back from a run on the shore with the dogs. I wouldn\u0027t be able to do that for too much longer once the weather turned.\\n\\n I stood there thinking about what I was going to do today, feeling a heaviness in my gut that I wasn\u0027t sure how to handle. I had felt the same way before my run, too, and thought that the exercise would clear my head. It hadn\u0027t.\\n\\n I was restless, pure and simple. And it wasn\u0027t a physical restlessness, apparently. It was mental. When I had awoken that morning, the smell of Bree all around me in the tangled sheets, I had felt happy and content. But then when I realized she had gone, I got up and tried to figure out what to do with my day. There were any number of projects I could work on, but none of them interested me. I had a vague sense that it was a topic that I needed to give some serious consideration to. What are you going to do with your life, Archer? Bree had shaken things up for me–and at the moment, all I could feel was unease. I never expected anyone to come in and open up the world for me, but that\u0027s what she had done. And now I had possibilities that I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d had before. But they all revolved around her. And that scared me. That scared the living hell out of me.\\n\\n I heard a knock on my gate and set the glass down. Was Bree off early?\\n\\n I walked outside my house toward the gate and spotted Travis walking down my driveway toward me.\\n\\n I stood waiting for him to approach, wondering what the hell he wanted.\\n\\n He put his hands up in a \u0027don\u0027t shoot me\u0027 mock pose, and I cocked my head to the side, waiting.\\n\\n Travis took a folded paper out of his back pocket and when he got to where I was standing, handed it to me. I took it, but didn\u0027t open it.\\n\\n \"Application for a learner\u0027s permit,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll just need to bring your birth certificate and proof of address with you. A water bill or whatever.\"\\n\\n I raised my eyebrows, glancing down at the paper. What did he have up his sleeve now?\\n\\n \"I owe you an apology for what I did with the strip club thing. It was… immature and uncool. And I\u0027m actually glad to see that you and Bree worked it out. I think she really likes you, man.\"\\n\\n I wanted to ask him how he knew that–I knew she liked me, maybe more, but I longed to hear what she had told Travis about me, if anything. Of course, even if I\u0027d been able to, it wouldn\u0027t be a good idea to ask him–he\u0027d just mess with me, most likely. But I didn\u0027t know how to talk about all my feelings with Bree. I knew sex didn\u0027t equal love, so how would I know if she loved me if she didn\u0027t tell me? And if she wasn\u0027t telling me, did that mean that she didn\u0027t love me? I was all twisted up and I had no one to talk to.\\n\\n And the hell of it was, I knew I loved her–fiercely and with every part of my heart, even the broken parts, even the parts that felt unworthy and without value. And maybe those parts most of all.\\n\\n \"So,\" Travis went on, \"can we call a truce? All\u0027s fair in love and war and all that? You win, you won the girl. Can\u0027t blame a guy for trying though, right? No hard feelings?\" He held his hand out to me.\\n\\n I looked at it. I trusted Travis about as far as I could throw him, but what was the point in making this some kind of ongoing war between us? He was right–I\u0027d won. Bree was mine. With the thought alone, a fierce possessiveness roared through me. I reached out and shook his hand, still eyeing him distrustfully.\\n\\n Travis rested his thumbs on his gun belt. \"So I guess you already know that Bree\u0027s friends are in town–her hometown friends.\"\\n\\n I frowned and pulled my head back slightly and gave myself away. Travis got an \u0027oh shit,\u0027 look on his face. \"Shit, she didn\u0027t tell you?\" he asked. He looked away and then back at me. \"Well, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s gotta be hard for her, I mean, here she is, she likes you and at some point, she\u0027s gotta go home, back to her real life. That\u0027s a tough position to be in.\"\\n\\n Home? To her real life? What the hell was he talking about?\\n\\n Travis studied me and sighed out a breath and ran a hand through his hair. \"Shit man, you don\u0027t have some kind of delusion that she\u0027s going to stay here and work in a small town diner all her life, do you? Maybe come live in this little clapboard shack you call a house and have lots of babies that you\u0027ll have no way to support?\" He laughed, but when I didn\u0027t, his smile drained away and a pitying look replaced it. \"Oh hell, that\u0027s exactly what you hope, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Blood was roaring in my ears. I hadn\u0027t exactly pictured any of that, but the thought of her leaving at all had icy fear racing through my veins.\\n\\n \"F*ck. Listen Archer, when I said you won her, I just meant for the meantime, for a few warm nights, a couple dalliances in your truck. I mean, good for you, you deserve that, man. But shit, don\u0027t start fantasizing about more than that. She might tell you she\u0027ll stay–she\u0027ll probably even mean it for a little while. But a girl like Bree, she went to college, she wants a life eventually. She\u0027s here to get away temporarily, to heal a wound–and then she\u0027ll leave. And why wouldn\u0027t she? What do you have to really offer her? Bree\u0027s beautiful–there will always be a guy who wants her and can give her more.\" He shook his head. \"What can you give her, Archer? Really?\"\\n\\n I was standing frozen in front of this a*shole. I wasn\u0027t so stupid that I didn\u0027t see what he was doing. He was playing a card. But unfortunately for me, the card he was playing was based in truth. He had a winning hand and he knew it. That\u0027s what he had come to do–destroy me with the truth. To remind me that I was nothing. And maybe it was a good reminder.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t even know if he wanted her anymore. He might not. But now it was about me not having her either. He was going to win, in one way or another. I saw it–I knew. I had seen that same look on another man\u0027s face once. I remembered what it meant.\\n\\n He took another deep breath, looking slightly embarrassed, or maybe pretending to. He cleared his throat. \"Anyway,\" he pointed to the piece of paper in my hand, \"good luck with the permit. You shouldn\u0027t have to walk everywhere you go.\" He nodded at me. \"Take care, Archer.\"\\n\\n Then he turned and walked back up my driveway and out through the gate. I stood there for a long time, feeling small, imagining her gone, and trying to remember how to keep breathing. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/archer-s-voice/page-24.html","bookId":1846,"book":{"id":1846,"title":"Archer\u0027s Voice","description":"Storyline: A New York Times, USA Today, and Wall Street Journal bestselling book.
