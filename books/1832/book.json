The result is an electrifying novel of romantic suspense that will have readers burning through the pages. \n An unpretentious beauty who radiates kindness, Kate MacKenna doesn’t have a bad bone in her body–or an enemy in the world. So why are bombs igniting everywhere she goes? The first explosion brings her face-to-face with a handsome Charleston police detective. The second sends her into the arms of her best friend’s brother–a Boston cop who’s a little too reckless and way too charming for comfort. But Dylan Buchanan won’t let emotion prevent him from doing his job: Someone is trying to kill Kate, and Dylan is the only one standing between her and the monster who wants her dead.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/slow-burn-buchanan-renard-5.jpg","author":"Julie Garwood","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":35,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
