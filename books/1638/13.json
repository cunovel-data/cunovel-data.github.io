Bonifacio quirked a small smile. \"And to keep you from spreading that damn name around.\" \"It\u0027s coming in from Charybdis IX, right?\" Delgado said, trying to prod more information out of the man. \"I hear the UNSC Navy is sewing everything up, so it\u0027s obviously a last-hurrah smuggle. A ship full of luxuries that soon people will pay a premium for ... and then you no longer need the navigation data. Right?\" Bonifacio said nothing, but looked out the window. Delgado nodded. The silence said a lot. \"So you\u0027ll sell us out to the Kig-Yar? Give them the data?\" Delgado growled. \"Are you some weepy Earth sympathizer?\" Bonifacio snapped, suddenly irritated. \"Because you seem really hung up on this idea that I\u0027m trying to steal the data to sell it to the Kig-Yar. Even if I am, who the hell cares what happens to Earth? They could care less about us.\" Delgado shook his head. Bonifacio hadn\u0027t come straight out and admitted anything yet, but at least he was getting chatty. He pressed the issue some more. \"The Kig-Yar will attack the moment we sell that data. They\u0027re just here to scavenge it.\" Bonifacio shook his head. \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong. They\u0027re risking a lot to be here, to help us build these asteroids. And they will reward us. They think of this as home just as much as we do.\" \"How do you think they will reward us?\" Bonifacio smiled. \"Don\u0027t you worry yourself about that right now.\" Delgado gritted his teeth. The smuggler had now all but admitted he was working with the Kig-Yar. That he was the leak in the Council. The tube car slowed near an industrial looking section of the asteroid, where metals were being processed from the raw slag forwarded by other mining companies still operating in the outskirts of the Rubble. They stopped in front of a large warehouse half dug into the ground. Bonifacio leaned forward as one of his men snapped a pair of handcuffs on Delgado. \"Welcome to your new home for the next few days.\" Chapter FIFTEEN SCYLLION WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, CHARYBDIS IX Keyes stared at the faces of the rioters, reading the rage and the desperation of the crowd\u0027s mood. So far they were just watching the ONI survivors. The trucks and trailers the ONI team and Keyes crawled out of lay broken across the road, burning from the RPG hits. The asphalt had melted underneath them in some places, and the warehouse windows reflected the dancing flames. \"Behind us.\" Hansen whirled around and shot at the corner of the burning trailer. Someone ducked back behind it. \"We need to get out,\" Watanabe told Keyes. The crowd muttered, and triumphant shouts increased in the distance as several of them dragged an ONI agent out from the remains of a trailer. The man struggled, but the ten people holding him were too strong. They shoved him to the ground and started kicking him. They could hear his screams. \"Can\u0027t we do anything?\" Keyes asked. \"It\u0027s just the three of us, and hundreds of them over there,\" Hansen said. \"I can\u0027t even get a shot clear, there\u0027re too many of them.\" \"Damn it.\" Keyes turned so that he could glance back and forth between the crowd and the trailer. \"Pelican 019, this is Lieutenant Keyes.\" He pulled his side arm out of the holster, but didn\u0027t point it in either direction, just kept at his side. \"I take it you\u0027re ONI?\" The Insurrectionist on the other side of the trailer yelled at them. It sounded like Kincaide. \"You think you\u0027re so smart, sneaking around. But we have you now! We\u0027ll beat you down like your friend over there.\" The screams from the ONI agent had stopped. The crowd moved away from the limp, broken body. Keyes felt sick, then nervous as the mob screamed in his direction. Hansen dropped a magazine out of her gun. It hit the asphalt at the same time as a new one clicked home. She didn\u0027t respond to Kincaide\u0027s rants. \"Jeffries here, sir,\" crackled the voice in Keyes\u0027s earpiece. \"Can you get a read on my location?\" Keyes tried to keep his voice calm. Something about the pent up rage of the crowd unnerved him. \"Yessir.\" Hansen pointed at a nearby door to another warehouse. They backed over to it. Keyes held his hand up to his ear. \"Get ready for a hot pickup. We\u0027re coming up to the roof. Got a mob after us, and we lost the Insurrectionists we were after. They were using RPGs on us, so come in fast and low and keep your eyes open.\" An Insurrectionist peered around the corner, and ducked back again as Watanabe fired at him. \"These are company agents,\" Kincaide shouted into the air. \"Any one of you grab them I\u0027ll give you weapons. Free guns.\" A pair of rioters heard that and ran down the street at the trio. Watanabe and Hansen shot in unison, and the two men pitched forward into the road. Hansen turned around and shot the doorknob several times, then kicked the door in. \"Inside.\" They moved in, Watanabe and Hansen staying by the door as Keyes looked around for a way up. A few more gunshots cracked out -- they convinced the mob to stay back. Meanwhile, Kincaide was screaming at the mob to attack. Still, even rioters didn\u0027t want to charge head on into gunfire. Keyes could see that through the shattered windows of the door. They were holding back as the two ONI agents shot just above their heads. Looking the other way, Keyes spotted a service elevator. \"Sir, I\u0027m a minute away,\" Jeffries called in. \"Get to the rooftop.\" \"To the roof,\" Keyes shouted. They ran to the elevator, pulling the cage shut. It lurched up, just as the door they\u0027d come through shattered, rioters pouring through, Kincaide with them. He raised a Covenant plasma rifle, and as the elevator rose to the next floor, a burst of plasma hit the elevator doors beneath them, blowing them out into the shaft. Smoke rose up with them as they climbed toward the top floor. The elevator lurched to a halt, and once the doors opened Hansen shot the control panel several times. The foyer led to a doorway out onto the roof, and past the stairs leading down the warehouse\u0027s floors. They could hear murmuring and footsteps farther down the stairwell as they passed it to kick open the door. As Keyes ran onto the flat roof, he saw the running lights of the approaching Pelican wink off. The craft swooped by, blinding them with a sudden glare of a spotlight that then shut off almost as quickly as it had been flicked on. \"That you coming out on the roof, sir?\" Jeffries asked. \"Better believe it,\" Keyes grunted, sprinting away from the stairwell. \"Coming back around for the land, deploying the ramp,\" Jeffries reported. The Pelican banked and disappeared off into the night. Then it appeared again. Jeffries was throwing it full speed right toward the top of the building, skimming just over the rooftops in a near suicidal dash. Keyes had to admire the skill. From the street level the bright flash of a rocket launch lit up an alleyway and a rocket streaked for the Pelican. \"RPG!\" Keyes shouted, but Jeffries had already kicked the tail of the Pelican out, crabbing it around in midair to face the rocket and present a smaller profile. The rocket streaked by, missing but bathing the Pelican in an eerie orange light. A second rocket flashed and leapt up from underneath the Pelican. It slammed into the belly of the craft, gutting it. Debris rained down out of the Pelican, and a second explosion inside rippled throughout the craft\u0027s body. It hung in the air, engines wailing, but not moving. The third rocket slammed into its tail, and the Pelican dropped out of the air into the street below, sinking from eye level in an inferno of boiling metal and parts. Keyes threw himself at the ledge of building, firing his sidearm into the street, but the Insurrectionists had already melted back into the shadows. The flaming wreckage burned itself against the back of Keyes\u0027s eyes as he waited for some movement, any movement, near the ruins of the Pelican. \"Lieutenant,\" Watanabe grabbed him and yanked him back from the edge. Chips of concrete stung Keyes in the face as gunfire hit the lip of the building. Watanabe locked his eyes. Keyes stood in front of Watanabe, frozen, as Watanabe grabbed him by the face to look right at him. \"There\u0027s nothing you could have done, Keyes.\" Keyes numbly ejected the spent magazine from his sidearm and slid in another. \"I\u0027m the one who transferred him aboard the Midsummer Night.\" \"He was a good soldier and a good man. Jefferson flew hard, and now he\u0027s down and we need to focus.\" Keyes stared at the ONI spook. Jefferson? What the hell was that? Watanabe was supposed to be a man of details, observant. But Jeffries hadn\u0027t rated his attention, apparently. But then, that was a spook versus enlisted. They didn\u0027t care about the man standing next to you. They had their own agendas. \"Keyes, you listening? Can you raise the ship?\" \"I can try,\" Keyes said. By the stairwell Hansen fired three shots, and someone screamed. Keyes moved away from the lip of the wall and closed his eyes. He flipped frequencies on the earpiece, and then looked up at the stars in the night sky. One of them was the Midsummer Night, parked in geosynchronous orbit. It hung directly over the city. \"Midsummer Night, this is Keyes.\" He waited a moment, then repeated it. A response came through, crackly and faded. \"Keyes, this is Kirtley. Glad to hear your voice. What\u0027s your situation?\" \"Pinned on a roof,\" Keyes reported. \"Jeffries was hit by RPG fire; the Pelican is down. We\u0027ve got Insurrectionists and a mob ready to tear our throats out.\" \"Listen, hold tight,\" Kirtley said. \"There are ODSTs on their way.\" \"They won\u0027t get here in time,\" Keyes said. \"Major Faison had it out with the captain, said you guys needed boots on the ground for support if a mob was moving in. They left early, before you called Jeffries. You need to hold out twenty minutes. Copy that? Twenty minutes?\" Twenty minutes. Might as well have been an eternity. But it was a chance. \"Tell them to space out and watch out for rockets,\" Keyes said. \"Will do. Good luck, Lieutenant.\" Keyes ran over to Watanabe and Hansen. \"ODSTs are on their way. Twenty minutes.\" Watanabe and Hansen glanced at each other. Watanabe held up his side arm. \"Last mag.\" \"Same here. Keyes?\" \"I\u0027m on my last mag too.\" The three of them looked down the empty stairwell. \"Twenty minutes, huh?\" Hansen said. \"Twenty,\" Keyes repeated. \"Well, I\u0027m game to try it,\" the ONI agent said, and steadied herself against the wall for a better shot. Chapter SIXTEEN SCYLLION WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, CHARYBDIS IX \"They\u0027re not trying to push up the stairs hard enough,\" Hansen said, ten minutes later. So far Keyes had only fired warning shots. The rioters would peek around a corner and fire off a round, and he would too, and then there would be silence until the next rioter nerved up enough to try doing the same thing. \"She\u0027s right.\" Watanabe stepped forward, trying to look down the stairwell. He jerked back as someone fired a shot. Plasma exploded against the walls of the foyer. \"They\u0027ve got the Covenant weapons now.\" Hansen shuffled back from the doorway. \"So why aren\u0027t they rushing us?\" Keyes asked. He scanned the rooftop. \"They\u0027re up to something.\" Hansen pulled a wicked-looking knife out of her boot and put it on the ground. \"Keyes, go left, Watanabe, right. Just start checking the edges. Don\u0027t pop your head over, just listen for anything. I\u0027ll hold this point.\" Keyes and Watanabe took off at a crouch for the edge of the roof. Keyes skirted it, slowly moving against the concrete lip. The edge came up to his head. On the other side of the building, he could see Watanabe doing the same. Keyes made his way down one whole side of the building. His thighs burned from the awkward waddling by the end, and he paused to stretch them out. Watanabe had stopped as well. But he wasn\u0027t stretching his legs. He had his gun out. Three men leapt over the lip near Watanabe, with Kincaide vaulting the edge just behind them. The ONI agent charged them from the side, shooting down the first man, then the second. Keyes couldn\u0027t risk firing, he\u0027d just as likely hit Watanabe at this distance, so he sprinted at the group. Kincaide used the third man, a rioter, as a shield. He shoved the surprised civilian into Watanabe, then shot them both several times with a plasma rifle. Keyes felt sick as he watched Watanabe fall. The man may have been ONI, but he was crew and a fellow soldier, and Keyes realized he was screaming. Keyes had his pistol up without a second thought. As Kincaide seemed to turn in slow motion, Keyes pulled the trigger. He\u0027d been aiming for the chest, but the first shot hit Kincaide in the shoulder. It spun the Insurrectionist back, and he struggled to bring the heavy plasma rifle back up to aim at Keyes. Keyes shot him in the chest, then stomach, grazed his side, and then ran out of ammunition. He slammed into Kincaide, grappling for the alien rifle. \"Damn ... UNSC ... pig,\" Kincaide spat, still trying to force the rifle up into Keyes\u0027s ribs. \"Go back to Earth. You don\u0027t belong here.\" The memory of the explosions in the cargo bay of Finnegan \u0027s Wake, the flaming Pelican Jeffries piloted going down, wounded ODSTs gritting their teeth and bearing the pain as they waited for help, all filled Keyes\u0027s mind. He grunted and kept forcing the plasma rifle down until it was aimed at Kincaide\u0027s feet. He pulled the trigger, and a burst of white-hot plasma destroyed the Insurrectionist\u0027s leg and threw Keyes back, still holding onto the rifle. Concrete bubbled where they\u0027d stood, and Keyes felt the legs of his uniform burning. He patted the fires out quickly, and looked back at Kincaide. The man had lost his left leg, blown clean off at the thigh. He\u0027d been shot in the shoulder and chest.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-13.html","bookId":1638,"book":{"id":1638,"title":"Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6)","description":"Storyline: Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6) In the first, desperate days of the Human-Covenant War, the UNSC has enacted the Cole Protocol to safeguard Earth and its Inner Colonies from discovery by a merciless alien foe. Many are called upon to rid the universe of lingering navigation data that would reveal the location of Earth. Among them is Navy Lieutenant Jacob Keyes. Thrust back into action after being sidelined, Keyes is saddled with a top secret mission by ONI. One that will take him deep behind enemy lines, to a corner of the universe where nothing is as it seems. Out beyond the Outer Colonies lies the planet Hesiod, a gas giant surrounded by a vast asteroid belt. As the Covenant continues to glass the human occupied planets near Hesiod, many of the survivors, helped by a stronghold of human Insurrectionists, are fleeing to the asteroid belt for refuge. They have transformed the tumbling satellites into a tenuous, yet ingenious, settlement known as the Rubble--and have come face-to-face with a Covenant settlement of Kig-Yar . . . yet somehow survived. News of this unlikely treaty has spread to the warring sides. Luckily for the UNSC, this uneasy alliance is in the path of the Spartan Gray Team, a three-man renegade squad whose simple task is to wreak havoc from behind enemy lines in any way they see fit. But the Prophets have also sent their best---an ambitious and ruthless Elite, whose quest for nobility and rank is matched only by his brutality . . . and who will do anything to secure his Ascendancy and walk the Path.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6.jpg","author":"Tobias S.
