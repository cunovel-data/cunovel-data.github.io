{"id":97513,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"A short while?\" Keyes didn\u0027t like the sound of that.\n \"He rammed a Covenant destroyer.\"\n \"Sometimes that\u0027s the only option you have ...\"\n \"That was after he\u0027d been ordered to retreat. The only reason he wasn\u0027t court-martialed was because he disabled it long enough for another ship to finish it off with a MAC. They fished him out of the debris.\"\n Keyes mulled that over. He was going to be serving with this man. Maybe he shouldn\u0027t have jumped to saying \"yes\" so quickly.\n \"You know why he did it, sir?\" Jeffries continued. \"Rumor has it he\u0027s mad with grief. Covenant burned his home world, while he was out on a patrol, seven years ago. Never been the same since.\"\n \"Okay, that\u0027s enough,\" Keyes said. The conversation was sliding into innuendo; he didn\u0027t need to be poisoned against his future commanding officer.\n There\u0027d be plenty of time to get to know Zheng once aboard. And maybe this was why Keyes had been called back in, to add a bit of strategy and calm into Zheng\u0027s style. \"Oh, and one more thing, Mr. Jeffries?\"\n \"Sir?\"\n \"When you fly me, a commanding officer, out of a military installation, you will follow the flight plan you were given. Failure to do so, including dropping out of radar range near tree level, means they have every right to swat you out of the sky like a bug. We are, after all, on a world near the front. You yourself indicated that to me.\" The steel in his voice surprised even him. \"In the event that we were to be shot down for violating the flight plan, I would personally hunt you down from beyond the grave, soldier, and make your life a miserable thing to behold. Do you get me, soldier?\"\n Jeffries kept his gaze dead ahead through the windshield. \"Yes sir.\"\n \"Lastly, you will don your full flight gear. Were this Pelican to be holed, while\n I\n might be gasping for air, I fully expect you to be able to fulfill your mission -- even if your mission is as meaningless as being my personal, full-time chauffeur. We clear, Jeffries?\"\n \"Crystal, sir.\"\n Keyes clipped himself into the copilot\u0027s chair and listened to the Pelican\u0027s engines warm up. He was bridge crew on a stealth ship, with a mystery mission from the ONI in three days.\n It was good to be back.\n \"All right, Mr. Jeffries, take this bird up.\"\n Keyes leaned back in his chair, enjoying the sensation of thrust. Three days to shake out the frigate and chase civilians to enforce the Cole Protocol seemed straightforward enough. A nice way to ease back into ship life.\n Chapter THREE\n OAKS CENTRAL HABITAT, THE RUBBLE, 23 LIBRAE\n Ignatio Delgado walked slowly toward his copilot\u0027s funeral dressed in a full suit, a tie uncomfortably snug around his neck. The painful plasma burns on his torso still hurt but he felt compelled to attend. \u0027\n The parks existed on the inside of a hollowed-out asteroid; look up and you were looking down on the treetops of the other side of the park.\n Maria Esquival intercepted him near a grove of tiny trees.\n \"Hey, Nacho.\" She grabbed his hand. Only Maria called him by that nickname, because only Maria knew him from back when he was a grubby little kid running around the surface of Madrigal. Back then she\u0027d been a scrappy tomboy from just down the street with her hair pulled back in a functional pony-tail. \"You really shouldn\u0027t be here.\"\n \"He was my best friend.\"\n Maria squeezed his hand. \"I know. But they still don\u0027t want you here. You have to respect his family\u0027s wishes.\"\n In the distance, the Hollister family had their backs to him. All dressed in black, surrounding a small urn, they were adding his ashes to the ground near one of the trees that gave the habitat its name.\n They blamed Delgado for Melko\u0027s death. The copilot had succumbed to his wounds before anyone had gotten to\n Distancia.\n An unnecessary death, his family thought. They could care less about protecting the data that led back to Earth. They\u0027d fought for self-rule from among the depths of this system for generations. Let the aliens have Earth, let it burn. They didn\u0027t care.\n \"Come on,\" Maria said, guiding him away.\n \"Do you think he died in vain?\" Delgado asked.\n Maria kept moving him along. \"It\u0027s not for me to say, Nacho. But I\u0027ve known both of you long enough to know that you both stood by each other to do what you each thought was right. So pay them no attention. They\u0027re grieving.\"\n Maria had been with Delgado when their parents had rushed them to the large fields outside Nueva Lima, bundling them aboard a fat cargo ship as\n their crying parents told them they\u0027d be on the next ship following them.\n They\u0027d been crammed into the hold with all the other scared children, trying to figure out what was happening. Delgado had been fourteen. Maria had been planning her quinceanera.\n They\u0027d held each other when the air outside turned white-hot, and the cargo ship shook and rattled. And when it had reached orbit, the shocked pilot\u0027s voice filled the hold, telling them that the entire surface of Madrigal had been \"glassed.\"\n All because of the war between the UNSC and the Covenant.\n They strolled along, heading toward a man, who appeared to be waiting for them by one of the habitat\u0027s famous large oak trees. His dark eyes taking in the funeral in the distance. He wore casual overalls, and a cap.\n Maria stopped. \"My brother needs to talk to you, though he refuses to tell me about what.\"\n \"Don\u0027t take it so personally, Maria. It\u0027s council business.\"\n Nine Security Council members were voted into position by the citizens of the Rubble. They handled the entire structure\u0027s defenses, along with the AI Juliana.\n Diego and the Council had chosen Delgado and Melko on short notice to protect the navigation when the Nav data started disappearing. With their\n years of piloting cargo throughout the\n Rubble, they knew it all inside and out. The council felt secrecy was their best option. With their volunteer defense forces and open nature, trying to put the chip under iron-tight guard would raise attention and create a big target.\n But after this latest mishap, Delgado was convinced someone on the Council was leaking the location.\n \"You slumming it, Diego?\" This was not the usual, tightly tailored man that Delgado expected.\n Diego grimaced. \"Keeping a low profile, Ignatio.\" He kissed his sister on the cheek, and she left the copse of trees to walk alone across the manicured grass toward the funeral.\n \"What do you need?\" Delgado finally asked, watching Maria.\n \"You seem convinced that someone on the Security Council is leaking information about the location of the navigation data. You\u0027ve been sniffing around, kicking up attention, trying to figure it out.\" Diego started walking out from the park toward the large airlocks at the end of Oaks Central Habitat. \"When we decided to use you to move the data, and keep it safe, we were figuring on your keeping a low profile. That was the whole damn point, Ignatio.\"\n \"Someone is leaking it,\" Delgado said. \"Those Jackals knew exactly where it was. This was the second time they made a play to get at it, and they were damn close. If I hadn\u0027t decided to move the data earlier than the date I gave the Security Council, those Jackals would have had it. You know, whoever leaked that murdered Melko. And I want them to pay.\"\n They passed by the giant rolling axle of the join between the docking tubes and the asteroid\u0027s slow-spinning hub.\n \"I understand what you\u0027re doing, Ignatio. But the only people who knew where the navigation data was are the Security Council members, To suggest that one of us leaked it is serious.\"\n \"I know that,\" Delgado said as they walked into a massive, clear tube. From here they could see other asteroids connected to Oak Park. The connected structures faded off into the distance like a giant\u0027s tinker toy set.\n Artificial gravity faded away, and the two men grabbed the railings running along the tube as they hung in the air. In the center of the docking tube, pods zipped along with goods and passengers moving from rocky habitat to habitat. \"A lot of people wouldn\u0027t mind handing over the chart data to the Kig-Yar. They\u0027re offering us power, money, and Covenant technology for it.\"\n \"And what about you, Diego?\" Delgado asked. \"You in favor of that?\"\n Diego slowed down and came to a stop in the busy tube. He looked off at the looming orb of the gas giant Hesiod in the distance. \"I think that if we hand over the chart data, our usefulness to the Kig-Yar is over. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve worked so hard to keep the data concealed. That\u0027s why I asked you to help me do it. Most of the Council agrees.\"\n \"Most?\" Delgado seized on the word. Diego was being surprisingly moderate for an old Insurrectionist.\n Diego handed him a cigar, letting it hang in the air thanks to the lack of artificial gravity. Delgado looked down. \"A Sweet William? I didn\u0027t realize there were any left.\"\n \"A Council member gave me one of these. Hinted around that he could get me more, said he had a smuggling operation out of Charybdis IX with one of his ships. He says that the UNSC Navy has been getting ready to crack down on slipspace jumps by citizens. They want everything to be\n militarized.\" Diego practically spat the last word. \"This Council member has been shipping weapons of some sort he purchased from the Covenant for brother Insurrectionists back in the colonies, but he\u0027s worried that whatever is destroying the navigation data throughout the Rubble may get to him. He wants to give it to the Kig-Yar before something happens. He claims he\u0027s making his last smuggling trip now. Afterwards, he wants to give the Kig Yar his ship, and the navigation data aboard it. I\u0027m getting this secondhand, but it looks like he\u0027s trying to bribe a majority Council vote for selling the navigation data.\"\n \"You\u0027re going to let that happen?\"\n \"I had Juliana hunt for a likely candidate among recent ship activity.\" Diego smiled referring to the Rubble\u0027s AI. \"She came up with one. The ship\u0027s name was\n Kestrel.\n It is the only known ship that could still be in the colonies and able to make it back. It hasn\u0027t returned to dock, as far as we can tell. All our other smuggling ships have been destroyed, or had their data erased. We\u0027re truly cut off from the rest of humanity.\"\n \"Your Council member could have been lying; he could have just found some boxes of Sweet Williams.\"\n \"Maybe,\" Diego said. \"But Juliana thinks the\n Kestrel is our ship.\"\n \"So what do you want me to do?\" Delgado handed the cigar back by bumping it back through the air at Diego.\n \"Find out more about the Kestrel, Ignatio. See if they were really working for a Council member. Find out if they\u0027ve snuck back into the Rubble. Because if you can connect them to our Council member, then I can move against him. There are better things to be trading for those weapons. Like ... medicine instead of damned cigars.\"\n Diego crushed the cigar, and the pieces of tobacco flakes hung in the air between them. \"And since I\u0027m giving you this lead, please work hard to keep it quiet.\"\n \"I can do that.\" Delgado brushed the crushed cigar out of the air between them. \"What\u0027s his name?\"\n Diego sighed. He looked very reluctant to be giving out a name of a fellow Security Council member. Maybe he was having second thoughts. He\n turned and looked out of the tube. The entire collection of tubes and asteroids housed the remains of Madrigal\u0027s proud colony: its people.\n It was called the Rubble because that\u0027s what it had once been. Detritus, rubble, rocks, and slag left over from the creation of the solar system, trailing the gas giant Hesiod.\n \"You\u0027ve done a lot for me, Diego, I appreciate everything,\" Delgado said. Diego had taken in both Maria and Delgado when they arrived those years ago, after Madrigal was destroyed. Diego had joined the Insurrectionists years before Madrigal was glassed, and he\u0027d been the only person waiting for them after they\u0027d fled the planet. Delgado owed Diego a lot. But before everything changed, Diego planted bombs in passenger ships, spaceports, and on stations. He\u0027d smuggled and pirated, and everything that implied. Delgado always felt a sense of awkwardness, accepting what his hard-working parents, had they lived, would have called blood money. There was a tension in his friendship with Diego. But then, maybe that wasn\u0027t fair. Since the fall of Madrigal, Diego had thrown himself at the idea of the Rubble. Delgado changed the tone of his words. \"So please give me the name. I won\u0027t kill the man. I\u0027ll bring him to justice. We\u0027re not the rabble we used to be, we\u0027ve changed since the Fall of Madrigal.\"\n Back then, the Rubble had just been a massive Insurrectionist military base, quartered and scattered throughout the asteroids trailing the gas giant in a trojan orbit.\n But in short time, using spaceships, raw materials, and anything they could lay their hands on that hadn\u0027t been destroyed by the Covenant, they\u0027d built the Rubble that they were now looking out on. It was something to be proud of.\n \"I know.\" Diego turned back to him. \"Doesn\u0027t make it easier. The man you\u0027re looking to link the\n Kestrel to is Peter Bonifacio.\"\n Delgado looked down the length of the tube. Bonifacio did a lot of smuggling back before the Covenant glassed Madrigal. Now he was reduced to\n occasional sneaks back to the Inner Colonies, though even those trips had become too dangerous as he lost ship after ship to both UNSC and Covenant forces. Delgado had moved stuff from asteroid to asteroid for the man, who always paid late. How he\u0027d managed to get on the ballot to be voted onto the Security Council Delgado had never understood.\n \"Consider it done,\" Delgado said. Halfway around the clear tube a series of streamlined transit cars sped up, moving passengers inside from one habitat to another on a maglev track.\n \"Good. Thank you. And Delgado? You\u0027ll need to be careful.\"\n Delgado nodded. The two men shook hands, and then floated to go off their separate ways. Diego with sadness in his eyes. Delgado with fire and\n vengeance.\n Chapter FOUR\n OUTER FRINGES, ECTANUS 45 SYSTEM\n Keyes rode the copilot\u0027s seat as Jeffries expertly guided a Pelican full of orbital-drop shock troopers into the inky depths of space between the Midsummer Night and the tattered-looking civilian cargo hauler \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-4.html","bookId":1638,"book":{"id":1638,"title":"Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6) \n In the first, desperate days of the Human-Covenant War, the UNSC has enacted the Cole Protocol to safeguard Earth and its Inner Colonies from discovery by a merciless alien foe. Many are called upon to rid the universe of lingering navigation data that would reveal the location of Earth. Among them is Navy Lieutenant Jacob Keyes. Thrust back into action after being sidelined, Keyes is saddled with a top secret mission by ONI. One that will take him deep behind enemy lines, to a corner of the universe where nothing is as it seems. Out beyond the Outer Colonies lies the planet Hesiod, a gas giant surrounded by a vast asteroid belt. As the Covenant continues to glass the human occupied planets near Hesiod, many of the survivors, helped by a stronghold of human Insurrectionists, are fleeing to the asteroid belt for refuge. They have transformed the tumbling satellites into a tenuous, yet ingenious, settlement known as the Rubble--and have come face-to-face with a Covenant settlement of Kig-Yar . . . yet somehow survived. News of this unlikely treaty has spread to the warring sides. Luckily for the UNSC, this uneasy alliance is in the path of the Spartan Gray Team, a three-man renegade squad whose simple task is to wreak havoc from behind enemy lines in any way they see fit. But the Prophets have also sent their best---an ambitious and ruthless Elite, whose quest for nobility and rank is matched only by his brutality . . . and who will do anything to secure his Ascendancy and walk the Path.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6.jpg","author":"Tobias S.
