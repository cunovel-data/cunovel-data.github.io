Blood sprayed and hit the floor as Diego collapsed, clutching the wound with a look of shock on his face.\\n\\n Delgado leapt over to Diego as he shot at Bonifacio, who ducked out into the corridor and ran for cover.\\n\\n Delgado waved the gun at the bodyguards. \"Back up. Back up.\" They were hired help -- their hearts weren\u0027t into the idea of a close-range shoot-out, luckily. Only Bonifacio was insane enough to fire inside a damn spaceship, Delgado thought. He grabbed Diego\u0027s collar and pulled him out of the\\n\\n kitchen and down the corridor.\\n\\n Bonifacio fired down at him from the cockpit, the bullets sparking off the metal bulkheads.\\n\\n Delgado fired back as he dragged Diego to the airlock. This was all messed up. Very messed up.\\n\\n Diego moaned as Delgado pulled him into the lock and cycled into the habitat\u0027s lock.\\n\\n A very loud bang startled him.\\n\\n The airlock seal broke as\\n\\n Distancia abruptly cut loose, her engines firing.\\n\\n Air whistled out of cracks in the warped airlock. Red alarm lights blinked, and Delgado kicked at the door leading into the habitat.\\n\\n It wouldn\u0027t open, of course -- with the outer seal broken emergency systems had kicked in. As long as the simple sensors on the outside detected loss of air the inner door was locked.\\n\\n Delgado grabbed the emergency phone, and got Bonifacio\u0027s voice. \"I just used an emergency Security Council code to override communications from your airlock,\" Bonifacio said flatly. \"And I canceled the airlock\u0027s alarm.\"\\n\\n The strobing lights shut off. It would look like a false trigger. A mechanic would be sent out at his leisure instead of an emergency crew.\\n\\n \"You bastard.\"\\n\\n \"Good-bye, Mr. Delgado.\"\\n\\n \"Go to hell, Bonifacio.\" Delgado slammed the phone against the wall until it broke.\\n\\n Bonifacio had killed them. Almost as good as a bullet, Delgado thought.\\n\\n He sat down next to Diego, holding a hand to his chest. Diego stared up at the ceiling, his breathing irregular and gasping.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Diego,\" Delgado said, looking down at his old friend.\\n\\n Diego bubbled blood up from his mouth, but said nothing. Delgado closed his eyes and bit his lip.\\n\\n Already the air seemed to be getting thinner. Delgado lay down, breathing shallowly.\\n\\n Then he reached down into his right shoe and tugged out the small beacon Adriana had given him.\\n\\n Delgado opened the casing and pressed the red switch. A small green light flickered on, and started pulsating.\\n\\n He closed his eyes and waited.\\n\\n Chapter THIRTY-SIX\\n\\n METISETTE ORBIT, 23 LIBRAE\\n\\n Reth lay curled up on the uncomfortable slab, thinking about the warmth and closeness of a Kig-Yar nest, and how far away such things were from him at the moment.\\n\\n He hurt everywhere, thanks to his treatment by the Sangheili. Oh, they\u0027d pay for this. Reth followed the orders of a\\n\\n Prophet.\\n\\n Who were they to treat him so cruelly?\\n\\n The Sangheili thought they were lords of it all, but they were just thugs, Reth thought. Little different from the Jiralhanae and their violent approaches to everything in the world.\\n\\n Soon the Prophets would listen to all Kig-Yar, Reth thought. Reth was here, working to find the secret of the human home-world. It would have been his already, if not for the Sangheili meddling.\\n\\n \"Unggoy!\" Reth carefully got off the bench, his limbs protesting, his steps dizzy.\\n\\n The Sangheili would have to go. Things were so close to being finished. Soon his human agent would have the location to Earth for him. Once Reth had that, then the army of Unggoy he\u0027d gathered on Metisette would be ready to be unleashed on the Rubble. The asteroids would make wonderful Kig-Yar nesting grounds.\\n\\n \"Unggoy, where are you? You must attend me. Are you not believers in the mission the Prophet of Truth himself gave to me, and thus to you?\" Reth collapsed to the ground in front of the energy bars that kept him jailed.\\n\\n Once he had the Rubble, he thought through a haze, and the location to Earth, the humans\u0027 Exodus Project would provide him the vehicle he needed to then bring the Unggoy to attack the human homeworld.\\n\\n A daring plan.\\n\\n A Kig-Yar plan.\\n\\n A plan the Prophet of Truth had agreed to when Reth presented it after returning with the secret of the Rubble and the humans\u0027 desire to trade. He\u0027d kept it a secret from his own Shipmistress, a violation that would have gotten him castrated if found out, but it had paid off handsomely.\\n\\n \"Unggoy!\"\\n\\n Now they\u0027d been discovered, the Jiralhanae were returning to broadcast the news about the discovery of the Rubble to a different Prophet.\\n\\n The Kig-Yar couldn\u0027t stop them. But they could move the plan up, so that they wouldn\u0027t look like traitors, trading with the humans.\\n\\n No, it was time to destroy the humans and their homeworld and show the Prophets that it was the Kig-Yar, not the Sangheili or Jiralhanae, who were the most cunning and loyal and holy subjects of the Covenant.\\n\\n The shuffling steps of two furtive Unggoy soldiers got Reth to focus on the ground in front of his long face.\\n\\n \"Sangheili kills us if we release you,\" one of the Unggoy protested.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ll risk your chance at joining in the Great Journey because you\u0027re scared of these Sangheili,\" Reth hissed. His ribs hurt.\\n\\n The Unggoy shuffled their feet again, methane snorting out from their masks as they looked back and forth at each other.\\n\\n \"Will you risk the Sangheili destroying the Redoubt, and all you\u0027ve built on Metisette?\" Reth asked. \"Will you see all the\\n\\n Unggoy on that planet punished, when they\u0027ve been following the right Path?\"\\n\\n They glanced at each other again. \"Our nipple brothers would be all killed?\"\\n\\n The Unggoy sucked food from a shared tube, a nipple, Reth remembered. \"Yes, your nipple brothers would all die.\"\\n\\n That was enough to get them to free him. One of the Unggoy tapped at the controls for Reth\u0027s cell.\\n\\n Reth smiled as the energy bars disappeared. He rolled out of the cell before the Unggoy changed their minds. \"Quick, you must help me escape.\"\\n\\n The two Unggoy grabbed him under his arms as he wobbled, prompting Reth to grunt in pain. Together, all three hobbled down the corridor until Reth had them stop near a service panel.\\n\\n The Sangheili may have taken the ship by force, and cowed the Unggoy, but Reth still had some tricks of his own. He shut down the ship\u0027s computer system with an override password.\\n\\n While the Sangheili raced to reboot the system, he had the Unggoy drag him to an escape pod.\\n\\n Minutes later the cylindrical pod shot out of the ship, veering back toward Metisette at top speed, as the Sangheili coasted with a dead ship.\\n\\n It was time, Reth thought bitterly while rooting around the pod for a medical kit, to show the Sangheili that Kig-Yar could fight.\\n\\n Chapter THIRTY\u003eSEVEN\\n\\n THE RUBBLE, 23 LIBRAE\\n\\n Mike flew the\\n\\n Petya through the Rubble, flipping the ship end over end for sudden deceleration, and weaving his way around docking tubes and asteroids.\\n\\n In the confines of the airlock, braced against Mike\u0027s radical maneuvers, Jai swore. \"I don\u0027t see why\\n\\n I\u0027m in the airlock for the quick rescue, Adriana. He\u0027s your pet Insurrectionist.\"\\n\\n \"Shove it,\" Adriana muttered over the suit radio.\\n\\n Jai stiffened. \"Is that how you talk to rank?\"\\n\\n \"When rank stops whining I\u0027ll modify my behavior,\" Adriana said. \"Besides, I need to be in the medical bay in case Delgado\u0027s hurt.\"\\n\\n \"So we\u0027re trusting an Insurrectionist AI and rushing to help an Insurrectionist. You see anything wrong with this?\" Jai asked.\\n\\n Another voice crackled in his ear. The AI. Juliana. \"Technically the Rubble is a collection of people with many different backgrounds. Only a small percentage of them are actually Insurrectionist as you understand it -- \"\\n\\n \"Can it,\" Jai muttered, as Mike flipped the ship again, making his stomach lurch. Mike fired the engines to dodge docking tubes. \"Anything new about Delgado?\"\\n\\n \"The airlock the signal emanated from is still throwing me error codes from the broken seal,\" Juliana reported. \"You\u0027re still the closest ship. An emergency crew is outside the lock on the habitat side, but can\u0027t get at it, of course. I\u0027ve broken the communications block on the airlock, but no one inside is responding.\"\\n\\n Jai thought about that. A broken airlock and silence. \"Doesn\u0027t sound too promising.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Juliana replied. \"It doesn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Coming in on the lock,\" Mike shouted. Jai felt the\\n\\n Petya shudder like it never had before, and he was pressed against the side of the airlock despite the artificial gravity.\\n\\n He was glad he wasn\u0027t looking at this from the cockpit.\\n\\n Metal ground on metal as Mike forced the wrecked airlock against theirs.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re go on your command,\" Mike reported.\\n\\n Jai faced the thick metal door with its yellow stripes and red warning symbols and notices. \"Do it.\"\\n\\n The airlock sprung open with a gust of air. Then the habitat\u0027s airlock ground open with a tiny puff of air.\\n\\n Jai forced his way through the moment the gap was large enough.\\n\\n Two men lay on the floor of the airlock\u0027s nonslip metal surface. Delgado, a gun in one hand and the other bloody, lay over the stomach of a man with a bad chest wound. Blood pooled the floor around them, freezing as the vacuum sucked air and warmth out even faster now that a bad seal was in place between ship and habitat.\\n\\n Jai threw Delgado over a shoulder of his gray MJOLNIR armor, and picked up the other body as gently as possible, aware that he could be making the chest wound worse.\\n\\n He cycled through back into the\\n\\n Petya, thudding his way past bulkheads into the tiny cramped offshoot to the crew quarters where Adriana stood ready by a large metal table.\\n\\n She looked up. \"Two? Who\u0027s the other one?\"\\n\\n Juliana flickered into being over a nearby shelf. \"That\u0027s Diego Esquival.\" Her voice sounded muted, as if she were shocked.\\n\\n Adriana shook her head as she checked him over, while Jai held him in his arms still. \"He\u0027s dead.\" She pulled Delgado off Jai\u0027s shoulder and set him on the table. \"But Delgado\u0027s got a pulse. Store the other man into one of the cryogenic pods.\"\\n\\n Jai walked Diego\u0027s body around the table and to one of the three pods. Once he set it down and closed the lid, the automated systems kicked in. Diego was frozen in his last minute, for all the good it did him.\\n\\n When he turned around, Adriana had an oxygen mask on Delgado and the computers reading his vitals.\\n\\n Delgado stirred and opened his eyes, the oxygen taking effect. He tried to sit up, but Adriana put a hand on his chest to keep him in place. \"You\u0027re back on the\\n\\n Petya,\\n\\n Delgado.\"\\n\\n \"Diego?\" Delgado groaned, looking around. \"What about Diego?\"\\n\\n Jai and Adriana glanced at each other, and Delgado saw it. He seemed to fall back in on himself, shaking his head and looking off into the distance.\\n\\n \"Damn that bastard.\"\\n\\n \"What bastard?\" Juliana asked from the corner of the room.\\n\\n Delgado twisted to see her better, and his mouth fell open. \"You!\" Warring emotions crossed his face. Jai figured the man had wondered if the AI was not to be trusted, but that the revelation still caught Delgado off guard.\\n\\n \"Yes, me.\" Juliana grinned. The hologram folded its arms. \"What happened, Delgado?\"\\n\\n \"Bonifacio happened.\" Delgado all but spit the name out. \"He took\\n\\n Distancia.\\n\\n He also shot Diego.\" Delgado bit his lip, and slowly sat, holding his knees to do it with a grunt.\\n\\n \"I knew Bonifacio was a sketchy man. I have watched him smuggle things into the Rubble. I know of ten different caches he uses. He\u0027s definitely running those covenant guns to the colonies. He campaigned hard for that Security Council spot,\" Juliana said as Adriana and Jai watched the exchange. \"But to do this?\"\\n\\n Delgado looked at the AI. \"We have to catch him.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not even trying to run,\" Juliana said. \"Your ship is slowly coasting through the Rubble.\"\\n\\n \"Bonifacio thinks I\u0027m dead. He\u0027s taking his time, so he doesn\u0027t alarm anyone.\" The group looked at each other, and Delgado caught the glances. He raised his voice. \"Oh come on, I would not have done this. Why the hell would I risk my life to break an airlock? And do you think I shot Maria\u0027s brother? Re-ally?\"\\n\\n Jai tapped the table. \"Juliana, he makes a good point.\"\\n\\n Delgado turned around to him. \"And since when are you and the Rubble\u0027s AI all working together? When the hell did that start?\"\\n\\n \"When the Jackals started getting too close to the data,\" Jai said, staring Delgado down.\\n\\n Juliana was quiet, her eyes closed. \"Okay Delgado. I think you are right. We have a big problem.\" She opened her eyes to look at the three people staring back at her, and the equations streaming across her holographic body suddenly flashed bright red. \"Kig-Yar ships are withdrawing all throughout the Rubble. They\u0027re en route for Metisette.\"\\n\\n \"You told us the Jackals were up to something, like an invasion. Could this be it?\" Jai said.\\n\\n \"Their encryption is good. I can\u0027t break it just yet. But communications traffic is up and that can tell me something. I\u0027ve never seen activity like this.\\n\\n Delgado says Bonifacio is stealing the data. And this is happening at the same time as the largest movement of Kig-Yar ships we\u0027ve seen since they first started arriving to make a presence on the Rubble. It has to be related.\"\\n\\n \"Damn,\" Delgado said. \"We were right -- all they wanted was the data. They\u0027re making a move now, right?\"\\n\\n Juliana continued.\\n\\n \"Distancia is moving in the direction her flight plan indicated, but could make a break for it the moment it gets clear of the Rubble to wherever the Kig-Yar want it to. We have to get to it and stop Bonifacio. And prepare for whatever it is the Kig-Yar are up to.\"\\n\\n Jai nodded. \"Our first priority is Bonifacio.\" They had to focus on that; that was Gray Team\u0027s mission. Adriana met his eyes, then nodded. She agreed.\\n\\n \"Once we have that secured, Juliana, you have our assistance.\"\\n\\n The AI had her eyes closed again. Planning, running through the millions of threads spread all throughout the Rubble in a way no human could. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-25.html","bookId":1638,"book":{"id":1638,"title":"Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6)","description":"Storyline: Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6) \\n In the first, desperate days of the Human-Covenant War, the UNSC has enacted the Cole Protocol to safeguard Earth and its Inner Colonies from discovery by a merciless alien foe. Many are called upon to rid the universe of lingering navigation data that would reveal the location of Earth. Among them is Navy Lieutenant Jacob Keyes. Thrust back into action after being sidelined, Keyes is saddled with a top secret mission by ONI. One that will take him deep behind enemy lines, to a corner of the universe where nothing is as it seems. Out beyond the Outer Colonies lies the planet Hesiod, a gas giant surrounded by a vast asteroid belt. As the Covenant continues to glass the human occupied planets near Hesiod, many of the survivors, helped by a stronghold of human Insurrectionists, are fleeing to the asteroid belt for refuge. They have transformed the tumbling satellites into a tenuous, yet ingenious, settlement known as the Rubble--and have come face-to-face with a Covenant settlement of Kig-Yar . . . yet somehow survived. News of this unlikely treaty has spread to the warring sides. Luckily for the UNSC, this uneasy alliance is in the path of the Spartan Gray Team, a three-man renegade squad whose simple task is to wreak havoc from behind enemy lines in any way they see fit. But the Prophets have also sent their best---an ambitious and ruthless Elite, whose quest for nobility and rank is matched only by his brutality . . . and who will do anything to secure his Ascendancy and walk the Path.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6.jpg","author":"Tobias S.
