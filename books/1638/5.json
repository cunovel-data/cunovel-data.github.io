{"id":97514,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Finnegan\u0027s Wake. Finnegan\u0027s Wake had been slowly edging its way toward the periphery of the Ectanus 45 outer system ever since it left Chi Rho, getting ready for a jump. Zheng had shadowed the freighter long enough to make sure it wasn\u0027t an in-system trip. It wasn\u0027t. The ship, unaware it was being followed, had headed off well clear of this system\u0027s ecliptic plane. A surprise shot across the bows from the Midsummer Night convinced them to not try accelerating and to allow Midsummer Night to match speed so they could sling the Pelican over. Jeffries came in nice and easy, passing over the hull to the other side of the civilian ship and then slipping the Pelican into the cargo ship\u0027s hold. \"Check your equipment!\" the ODST platoon commander Canfield shouted. \"Look sharp.\" In the Pelican\u0027s hold ODSTs stirred, undipped their safety belts, and lined up. They\u0027d been bugging Zheng about not getting a chance to board the previous three civilian ships the Midsummer Night had stopped, so the commander had finally agreed to let them get some action in. \"They\u0027re still running a check on the ship\u0027s registry,\" Can-field called out from the back. \"But we\u0027re ready to rock, sir.\" \"Sure you don\u0027t want to wait for their full report, First Lieutenant?\" Keyes asked. Keyes kicked himself for the rookie attitude he\u0027d had just forty-eight hours ago, when he\u0027d thought he had an easy three days ahead of him. True, this was a shakeout, prior to a real-live mission with possible action thanks to the ONI spook and his mysterious sealed orders. But that hadn\u0027t stopped one exploding pipe and a radiation leak, and several crew from ending up in the infirmary. Two of the point guns on the starboard hull were out. A number of on/off magnets on the MAC, in essence a railgun, were failing, preventing them from getting the full power of the massive cannon. The Finnegan\u0027s Wake didn\u0027t know it, but at the moment, thanks to a partially shut-down reactor that the engineers were working on, they could\u0027ve easily outrun the Midsummer Night. \"Hell no, sir, I\u0027m all for going in,\" Canfield said. He vibrated with energy. Keyes had a feeling Canfield wanted some action, and now. He\u0027d have to keep an eye on him, make sure Canfield didn\u0027t get overly rough with some civilian. \"Okay, Canfield, let\u0027s get this show on the road, then.\" Keyes undipped from his seat, and Canfield stepped forward, waiting for his cue. Keyes nodded at him. Time to give the civvies something to gape at. Impress upon them the absolute seriousness that the UNSC was taking about the Cole Protocol. And that included sending an officer to oversee the boarding. Canfield spat chew out on the grated floor of the Pelican and shouted, \"Lock and load Helljumpers!\" Keyes turned to the cockpit. \"Drop the ramp, Mr. Jeffries. Hard and quick, as long as it\u0027s clear.\" \"Dropping the ramp, sir.\" The ODSTs of the 105th, or Helljumpers as they were also called, clad in black vacuum-rated armor, mirror-faced helmets and all, streamed out. They scattered through the hold of the freighter and its containers, picking targets. They were quick and quiet, with no chatter, and focused on the whole process. Keyes strode down the ramp into a canyon between the containers. He glanced in through the tough, scratched window of one of them. Nothing to see but labeled boxes. The captain of the freighter and three of his crew stood with their arms folded at the edge of their bay, watching the ODSTs. \"Sir, are you the captain of this ship?\" Keyes asked. The ascetic man nodded a shock of blond hair. \"We did nothing wrong. We\u0027ve made the jump to- -- \" Keyes held up a hand. \"Your ship is leaving UNSC protected space, Captain. You had the choice to make alternate arrangements for this cargo, or request to join a convoy where your navigation would be handled by Navy communications AIs. Either way, we need to wipe your nav data and check the ship out.\" \"This is a violation of our rights as merchants. We need to move our cargo now,\" the captain insisted. \"Sir, there is a war on,\" Keyes snapped. \"In case you haven\u0027t noticed, there are aliens forcing their way toward the Inner Colonies. Cargo can wait.\" ONI was stretching it, targeting civilian ships, but they just couldn\u0027t risk nav data falling into Covenant hands. The captain glared at Keyes, boiling with anger. \"And here we lose another right.\" Keyes turned to Canfield, who had sidled over. He looked eager to get his men kicking in doors and checking over cargo. \"Do your thing.\" \"Fascists,\" the captain spat. Keyes kept an eye on the man. He seemed overly keyed up and angry. Canfield\u0027s helmet twisted and Keyes heard the crackle of his radio in his earpiece. \"Okay, Helljumpers, move out, Oedant- -- \" Keyes didn\u0027t hear the rest of Canfield\u0027s orders. The container they stood next to exploded, throwing Keyes clear and smacking his head against the deck. The scene of Helljumpers scrambling for cover faded away as a thick cloud of smoke and unconsciousness rolled over Keyes. Chapter FIVE INSURRECTIONIST FREIGHTER FINNEGAN\u0027S WAKE, OUTER FRINGES, ECTANUS 45 SYSTEM Four more explosions rocked the inside of the cargo bay. Debris flew through the air and clattered off the walls, then rained down to the floor. A thick haze of smoke filled the air, making it nearly impossible to breathe. Keyes lay on his side, blinking away the blood trickling down his forehead into his eyes. He tried to get on his hands and knees to stand, but he couldn\u0027t quite manage it. An ODST Helljumper grabbed his arm. \"Come on, sir, you just got your bell rung.\" The man was right. Keyes could hardly focus on the grating of the floor right under the Helljumper\u0027s boots. He leaned against the Helljumper\u0027s body armor, struggling to keep under his own power. The thick haze was starting to clear. Keyes let the Helljumper set him down against the side of the container where they\u0027d come in. Keyes could see the high tail of the Pelican around the edge of the container in front of him. The other wounded ODSTs sat by him, armor ripped open or dented from container shrapnel. Several of the bodies just lay still, flat out on the floor. Keyes swallowed and rubbed his sleeve over his face to get the blood off. He could feel the warm trickle of more coming. \"Where\u0027s Canfield?\" He wanted to find out what the veteran ODST commander was doing. \"Canfield\u0027s dead, sir.\" The soldier who\u0027d dragged him to safety was checking people for injuries, spraying biofoam into wounds to try and stabilize things. They needed to evacuate quickly before they lost more soldiers. \"Dead?\" Keyes blinked more stinging blood and sweat out of his eyes. \"Who\u0027s in charge?\" Keyes was overwhelmed with the thought that the entire cargo bay had been a trap that he had led good men into. \"Faison, sir.\" Keyes felt for his earpiece and realized he\u0027d lost it in the shock-wave. \"Someone toss me their helmet ASAP. I need a heads-up and comms.\" A wounded soldier threw his helmet over, and Keyes slapped it on his head, wincing when it touched. Whatever hit him had glanced off his skull, giving him a head wound and most likely a concussion. \"Faison, this is Keyes, give me a sit rep.\" \"Shaped charges on the containers, sir. Insurrectionists no doubt. Three of them attacked us when the explosions happened.\" \"Any survivors?\" Keyes had hoped that they\u0027d captured them alive, to get some information out of them. Faison cleared his throat over the air. \"One. He\u0027s with the wounded. Sir, they were shooting at us. We thought it prudent to return fire.\" \"I understand that.\" Keyes said. \"I was hoping for intel -- like how many more surprises might be waiting. You\u0027re securing the ship, checking for others?\" \"Yessir.\" Faison sounded a bit annoyed. \"Of course, sir. And an emergency beacon has been triggered to bring the Midsummer Night in with reinforcements. We\u0027ll move right on through every inch of this boat, sir.\" \"I\u0027m sure you will,\" Keyes muttered. \"And if you don\u0027t mind, sir, I don\u0027t need someone second guessing my orders and looking over my shoulder. All things considered, sir, you\u0027re Navy, I\u0027m the marine. Let\u0027s stay out of each other\u0027s way.\" The loud roaring in the cargo bay had grown a bit more noticeable. Keyes looked at the soldier checking the wounded over and ignored Faison\u0027s disdain for a more immediate concern. \"Son, where are we losing air from?\" \"Everywhere. The explosives punched holes all over this little tub,\" came a response. \"Wish I were a marine right now,\" Keyes said, looking around at the ODSTs. \"I\u0027m not in vacuumproof armor.\" \"We\u0027ll think of something,\" the Helljumper said, glancing over at the Pelican. Keyes tapped his earpiece. \"Jeffries, Keyes here. Acknowledge.\" Silence. With a grunt Keyes got to his feet and stumbled over to the container. He leaned against it and slid around the corner. He stared at the gaping hole in the side of the Pelican. \"They pulled him out, sir.\" Another Helljumper tapped Keyes on the shoulder. \"We pumped him full of foam; he\u0027s in bad shape. But Midsummer Night should jockey in here soon. We\u0027ll have them transferred over.\" Keyes looked at the line of wounded and dead ODSTs. These were the best of the best. Ask for volunteers to hold a line and kick ass, they were the first with their hands up. Happy to face the long odds, happy to face the enemy in the eye. All dead from a routine boarding. From a trick. Keyes knew there could be more. He turned to the one Finnegan\u0027s Wake crewman still alive. He was lying on the deck with the wounded. A Helljumper sat near him, keeping a pulse. Keyes looked around the cargo bay. Think laterally, he told himself. This wasn\u0027t a typical fight; he needed to think a step ahead. The Helljumpers were combing the ship for more Innies. They\u0027d need transport off the ship once they\u0027d combed it, since the Pelican they\u0027d come in on was holed. Keyes triggered the Midsummer Night\u0027s ship-to-ship channel and tried to make contact, but got nothing. Keyes bit his lip. \"Commander Faison, Keyes here. Did you trigger the beacon calling the Midsummer Night in?\" \"Faison here. No, sir.\" \"Then who did?\" Keyes felt a cold stab of fear. They could all hear the beacon just by flipping to the emergency channel. A steady series of digital beeps tapping out a number code that, when translated, told any UNSC listening: men down, need backup and medical assistance with all possible speed. \"I don\u0027t know, sir.\" Faison said, annoyed. \"We\u0027re in the middle of sweeping the ship ...\" \"Commander, I\u0027m pulling rank. I\u0027m ordering you to stop the sweep, get a response from every single marine under your command. I want to know who set the beacon off.\" \"Yessir,\" came Faison\u0027s clipped reply in Keyes\u0027s ear. \"Don\u0027t suppose you want me to interview any of the dead, sir? Could be somewhat difficult.\" The Helljumper\u0027s passive-aggressiveness was turning into anger. Faison obviously wanted to kick back. And hard. \"No, Faison. We\u0027ll do that here.\" Keyes turned to the Helljumpers standing around him. He couldn\u0027t see any expressions behind those dark blue faceplates. He had a feeling that there wouldn\u0027t be any smiles. But knowing exactly what was going on in a battle was extremely important. And while they might not respect the man right now, Keyes would make sure that even the ODSTs would damn well respect the rank. \"Pull the chips on any soldier\u0027s helmets, check the footage and audio, look to see if anyone triggered a beacon.\" They all stood silent. Then one marine managed a \"Sir ...\" \"Don\u0027t stand there and stare at me,\" Keyes shouted, the crack of a whip in the back of his tone. The words echoed in the cavernous bay. \"J ust do it!\" They jumped to, pulling chips out of their fallen comrades\u0027 helmets and checking the footage. Keyes looked at the soldier who\u0027d tossed him his helmet, and the man shook his head. Not him. As they worked, Keyes switched frequencies and continually called out to the Midsummer Night. Nothing. They could talk inside the freighter, but it seemed nothing was getting out. One by one, the Helljumpers all reported their beacon results: nothing. \"Faison?\" Keyes called out over comms. \"Nothing here, sir. No one standing did it.\" \"Nothing on the wounded or dead.\" \"Sir?\" Faison wasn\u0027t questioning Keyes this time, or annoyed. He wanted to know what Keyes was thinking. \"The Pelican is down. If any of your men find a way to talk to the Midsummer Night, have them tell Zheng to stand off for now. That we have things under control.\" \"I\u0027m on it, sir.\" Faison went quiet. Keyes took a deep breath and another wave of dizziness hit him. They were losing too much air from the cargo bay. He had maybe another fifteen minutes before he\u0027d start gasping. \"Sir?\" Faison was back. \"We\u0027re being jammed. Nothing\u0027s getting out. There are some pretty hefty blast doors between us and the cockpit. We can start working on blowing those out to see if we can gain access to this ship\u0027s comms.\" \"No,\" Keyes said. \"They\u0027ll have more surprises. Not worth it right now. Get back and let\u0027s regroup, figure out what to do.\" \"You have a plan?\" Faison asked. Keyes smiled inside his ODST helmet. He sure as hell had a plan. But Keyes wasn\u0027t going to broadcast it over a suit radio, not when the Insurrectionists aboard already showed a capacity for messing with their communications so easily. \"No, Commander. I just want to regroup, take care of our wounded, and get ready for the Midsummer Night to come in. Get every ODST back to the cargo bay ASAP. Move it.\" He motioned one of the Helljumpers over. The man\u0027s tag read MARKOV. \"Sir.\" \"This armor really vacuum proof?\" Keyes asked. \"Yessir.\" \"How long can the air hold?\" \"Fifteen minutes, sir.\" Good, that hadn\u0027t changed in his years off.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-5.html","bookId":1638,"book":{"id":1638,"title":"Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6)","description":"Storyline: Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6) In the first, desperate days of the Human-Covenant War, the UNSC has enacted the Cole Protocol to safeguard Earth and its Inner Colonies from discovery by a merciless alien foe. Many are called upon to rid the universe of lingering navigation data that would reveal the location of Earth. Among them is Navy Lieutenant Jacob Keyes. Thrust back into action after being sidelined, Keyes is saddled with a top secret mission by ONI. One that will take him deep behind enemy lines, to a corner of the universe where nothing is as it seems. Out beyond the Outer Colonies lies the planet Hesiod, a gas giant surrounded by a vast asteroid belt. As the Covenant continues to glass the human occupied planets near Hesiod, many of the survivors, helped by a stronghold of human Insurrectionists, are fleeing to the asteroid belt for refuge. They have transformed the tumbling satellites into a tenuous, yet ingenious, settlement known as the Rubble--and have come face-to-face with a Covenant settlement of Kig-Yar . . . yet somehow survived. News of this unlikely treaty has spread to the warring sides. Luckily for the UNSC, this uneasy alliance is in the path of the Spartan Gray Team, a three-man renegade squad whose simple task is to wreak havoc from behind enemy lines in any way they see fit. But the Prophets have also sent their best---an ambitious and ruthless Elite, whose quest for nobility and rank is matched only by his brutality . . . and who will do anything to secure his Ascendancy and walk the Path.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6.jpg","author":"Tobias S.
