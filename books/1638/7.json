{"id":97516,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\"Huh ... Well you\u0027re not the only one. Miss Universe over there is, too.\" Eddie jerked his head toward the booth in the shadows where the massive man sat. He shifted, and Delgado noticed the triceps flexing under the person\u0027s shirt. He had to assume Eddie meant there was a woman in the booth with the guy. It wasn\u0027t a bodybuilder sitting there. It wasn\u0027t even a man. It was the Spartan, Adriana. He recognized her face. The last time he\u0027d seen her, she had been surrounded by iridescent gray metal, and she\u0027d worn the immensely powerful armor as if it had been a second suit of clothing. Now she wore a clean pair of pants and a tight, long-sleeved shirt in the manner of the off-duty miners in the bar. It didn\u0027t camouflage the fact that she was well over six and a half feet tall and dominated the booth. It couldn\u0027t camouflage the fact that she could, quite obviously, break any man in the bar in half. And many of them seemed to sense it and keep well clear. Delgado sat back down in the chair, and Eddie sighed. \"You know her.\" \"No, not really, Eddie. Not really.\" Delgado didn\u0027t try too hard to sell that. He slid off the chair and approached the booth. \"Can I buy you a drink?\" She didn\u0027t bother to turn, but waved him into the booth. \"Hello Mr. Delgado,\" she said. \"Hunting for something, are we?\" Delgado glanced around the bar. \"Maybe. But the chances of me finding it are somewhat ruined now that you\u0027ve arrived asking the same questions.\" There were people paying too much attention to them near the other side of the bar. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Adriana said. Five men walked over before Delgado could suggest that they get the hell out of there. \"What the hell are you two doing asking about the Kestrel?\" The leader of the little group asked. \"Hey, guys, come on.\" Delgado held up his hands, placating them. \"Let\u0027s stay calm.\" \"Shut up.\" These were large, muscled miners, their eyes glassy from being too far into the drink. \"This freak\u0027s been nosing around about stuff that\u0027s not her business.\" Adriana looked at the group. \"I\u0027m just asking a few questions. No reason to make this anything it\u0027s not.\" \"What we don\u0027t need, is some Earth-lovin\u0027 she-hulk skulking about our bars, asking about things that ain\u0027t none of her business,\" another man snapped. \"Hey now,\" Delgado said. \"Hey now what?\" The leader reached over and grabbed Adriana\u0027s shoulder. \"Now listen here!\" She shrugged his hand off and pushed it back. The stout miner staggered slightly, and for a moment, the whole group paused. Then the miner surged back, grabbing at Adriana\u0027s shirt collar again. \"You -- \" This time she grabbed his hand and twisted it. \"Don\u0027t touch me.\" She didn\u0027t ask this, she stated it. Like it was a fact. A second man swore and lunged for her as well. \"We\u0027ll do whatever the hell we want.\" He grabbed for her arm, but she grabbed his instead and jerked it. Now she had both men by an arm, twisting their hands back around. \"Now listen to me,\" Adriana snapped. \"If I want to ask after the Kestrel, or anything else that strikes my fancy, what makes you think you could stop me?\" The air in the bar suddenly broke, and the faux politeness dropped. \"None of that stuff ain\u0027t none of your business, bitch!\" another miner screamed. He threw a punch. Adriana let go of the two arms she held and grabbed the punch out of midair. She pulled the man toward her and slammed his head into the table. The table gave way and splintered where the man\u0027s head struck it. He fell through the destroyed wood onto the floor in between Adriana and Delgado. A fight erupted, the whole bar streaming their way in, Delgado cursing as he pushed his way back farther into the booth. He hadn\u0027t wanted to get involved, but the entire bar had already assumed they were working together. Adriana ripped the remains of the table out of the ground with a grunt. She held the large pedestal that had anchored it into the floor out in front of her with one hand, keeping the angry men at bay as she tapped her ear. \"Yeah, okay, let\u0027s bug out.\" An explosion of brick, grating, and debris blew past Delgado. As the dust settled, he spotted one of the miners pulling a gun on Adriana. Delgado whipped out Sen ora Sies, and the men all froze. But they weren\u0027t looking at him. As the dust cloud in the booth wafted away, they all stood looking at the giant gray suit of powered armor that had just burst its way through the wall of Eddie\u0027s like it was balsa wood. \"Don\u0027t move,\" the deep voice from behind the gold visor snapped. A large rifle in the Spartan\u0027s hands covered the crowd. No one moved. This new Spartan grabbed Adriana and Delgado and pulled them back through the debris. Delgado\u0027s feet scraped against the jagged remains. While the far back of Eddie\u0027s was buried into the hard rock, this section had apparently been right next to a maintenance corridor. A few of the bar\u0027s patrons tried to peer around the hole in the bar to see where they were going, but the armored Spartan fired the rifle at the bricks, and the faces ducked back into the bar. \"Delgado, look at me,\" Adriana ordered, and Delgado turned to her voice. Something very large smacked the back of his head and he fell to his knees in front of her, then passed out. Chapter SEVEN FREIGHTER PETYA, JUST OFF HABITAT BOLIVAR, OUTER RUBBLE, 23 LIBRAE Delgado woke up on a cot. He sat there, rubbing the back of his head and wincing. He was in the cramped crew quarters of a freight ship -- bulkheads, grated flooring, flickering tube lights, and grime and grease was everywhere. \"You\u0027re up.\" A giant machine had been welded into the back of the crew quarters. The voice came over the sounds of a maintenance pod whose arms sparked electricity as they carefully removed the suit of armor from a Spartan with almost midnight black eyes. The Spartan scratched his stubbly head and pulled on pants and a shirt. \"Itches,\" he said. \"I\u0027d like to take a shower, but we have to deal with you first. Adriana refused to leave you knocked out on the ground for those miners to eat alive.\" Delgado stood up and stumbled. The Spartan grabbed him firmly by the arm and hauled him back up. Another giant of a man who stood so tall he blocked the lights above. Delgado blinked. \"What do you want with me?\" \"You know who we are, right?\" \"Spartans. The boogeymen of Insurrectionist children everywhere,\" Delgado grunted. His head still throbbed, but he was feeling scrappy despite the fact that this mountain of a human being next to him could probably break him in half like a stick. But if they were going to kill him, they would have done it already. This gave Delgado a sudden boldness as he straightened up. Delgado smiled. \"Don\u0027t be spoiled, don\u0027t start a fight. Always be careful, here at night. Because the Spartans might come, in suits that weigh half a ton. And they\u0027ll steal from you all you gots, just like they did from Colonel Watts.\" The Spartan cocked his head. \"What?\" \"Just a kid\u0027s rhyme,\" Delgado muttered. \"Yeah, there are a lot of rumors about you guys. Like the one about how you super soldiers took out Colonel Watts and the rebels\u0027 whole network had to scramble to find a new leader. And there are other rumors, too. You know, a lot of people would be quite flattered that the UNSC created an entire special division of super soldiers just to come after them. But it\u0027s all been different since Harvest fell, hasn\u0027t it? The aliens sure bloodied your noses.\" \"Yes, yes they have,\" the Spartan agreed. \"Suddenly the idea of fighting for the right to your own survival isn\u0027t such an alien idea.\" \"True,\" the Spartan said. \"But then, the UNSC never glassed an entire populace, so it\u0027s not exactly fair to compare the UNSC/Covenant fight with the UNSC/Insurrectionist fight, is it?\" The Spartan had a point. \"What\u0027s your name?\" Delgado asked. \"Jai. Spartan double-oh-six.\" \"You like your numbers. You have last names?\" The Spartan didn\u0027t even answer, just pulled Delgado along into the freighter\u0027s cockpit, stooping to avoid hitting his head on the bulkhead. Another man, too massive not to be a Spartan, sat in the pi lot\u0027s chair. Adriana lounged near a navigation console. She spun her chair to face the two of them. \"Mr. Delgado. You\u0027ve met Jai, our team leader. In the pilot\u0027s chair is Mike.\" From the windows of the cockpit Delgado could tell they were still in the Rubble, but not hanging off a dock connector. They were moving slowly through the intricate maze of tubes and asteroids. Jai sat down at a communications console and swung around to face Delgado, who found a jumpseat. \"You were right, back there. We used to go after Insurrectionists. But that\u0027s what we were trained to do ... We live, breathe, and eat this stuff, Delgado. We serve humanity, we exist to protect Earth and all her colonies.\" \"Huh ... Nice sound bite.\" Delgado crossed his arms. \"That\u0027s no sound bite,\" Mike growled. Jai held up a hand. \"We have given everything over to this, Mr. Delgado, don\u0027t dismiss our entire lives so casually. I take it you are an Insurrectionist?\" Delgado shook his head. \"Not exactly ... A lot of people on Madrigal were neutral, even loyal to Earth. But when Madrigal was being glassed, it wasn\u0027t the UNSC that scrambled freighters and everything they had to evacuate people from Madrigal and try to hide them here.\" It had been the rebels. Even though Madrigal refugees and regular miners fast outnumbered them here in the Rubble, there had always been strong respect for the Insurrectionists. Even Delgado. He owed his life to them. Jai leaned forward. \"Then understand; we\u0027re not here for a fight. But we are here to try and stop the Covenant from taking any more colonies. Or Earth. \"For a while top brass and ONI agents have been worried about the Covenant\u0027s progress. As a result, earlier this week the Cole Protocol went into effect. All UNSC ships have to jump randomly before making a jump to their next destination. If Covenant forces appear, they have to destroy all navigation data that might lead the Covenant back to Earth.\" \"Just back to Earth, huh?\" \"And to the colonies, that\u0027s inferred. However, months before the Cole Protocol went into effect, ONI put together several Prowler Corps missions to get back behind enemy lines -- including this team. We have a list of places where navigation data might have survived, and our mission is to make sure it\u0027s all destroyed. \"In the case of the Rubble,\" Jai leaned further forward, intense. \"We\u0027ve been stuck here for almost a month. Every day we\u0027re here, we\u0027re not destroying data or checking over our targets elsewhere, and the greater the chance of the Covenant stumbling across the location to an Inner Colony, or Earth.\" \"What Jai\u0027s getting at,\" Adriana interrupted, \"is the question of whether you really think the navigation data will be safe here in the Rubble?\" Delgado looked around the cockpit at the three Spartans. \"I\u0027m not giving it over to you. You have to do your jobs. I have to do mine.\" \"So ... we noticed you didn\u0027t tell the Security Council that you ran into a Spartan,\" Adriana said. He looked up at her, startled. How did she know that? What all were the Spartans into? How much of the Rubble had they gotten bugged? \"Why would I? You\u0027re not good at keeping a low profile, it seems, with your dramatic attempt to sneak around and ask questions failing so spectacularly. Jai folded his arms. \"You picked a stubborn one to save, Adriana. I don\u0027t know.\" \"Don\u0027t know what?\" Delgado asked. Mike shook his head. \"Let him be, Jai. Let him be.\" A moment passed between the three Spartans. A decision. Delgado shivered. He\u0027d bet anything his life had just been on the table. Jai stood up. \"My team thinks you\u0027re one of the good guys, Delgado. I don\u0027t know. Mike, we passing the ship yet?\" Mike turned back around. \"Yes. Let me flip us around.\" Delgado frowned as the Rubble rotated around the ship. The freighter\u0027s cockpit shook a bit as distant thrusters farther down the hull fired. They drifted past one of the larger habitats on the edge of the structure. Docked to it was a ship that didn\u0027t look all that different from the Rubble itself -- a Tinkertoy assemblage of parts of varying age, shapes, and function. It slowly passed by, and then Jai turned to Delgado. \"It\u0027s hard to trust people who do business with the enemy, Delgado, and that\u0027s a Jackal ship. Also known as: the enemy.\" \"Yes ... that\u0027s a Jackal ship,\" Delgado said. \"But most Kig-Yar are like us. Rebels. Asteroid dwellers. And they\u0027re helping us.\" The Covenant had once seemed an implacable foe. A force of nature. When the conglomeration of aliens first made contact ten years ago, at the planet Harvest, the images of destruction relayed back were horrific. Covenant ships and their plasma weapons destroyed the surface of the agrarian world until nothing was left. Madrigal had not lain too far from Harvest. And after the destruction of Harvest they\u0027d readied themselves for the inevitable. And readied, and waited. Until 2528, when the Covenant stumbled into orbit around 23 Librae and destroyed Madrigal, the survivors fleeing to the Rubble. When the Kig-Yar came back to 23 Librae, looking to mine the asteroids around Hesiod, they found the Rubble. Everyone had girded themselves for another one-sided battle. But instead the odd, birdlike aliens had furtively begun trading with the humans. They\u0027d even established refuges on some of the outer asteroids. So as the Rubble heard snatches of rumors and data about the Covenant destroying all humanity, they had to second-guess what was happening. After all, they were still alive. And yet... it had taken the Covenant three years to get around to attacking Madrigal. Delgado knew the Rubble might still be on the list. \"The Jackals are helping you by violently hunting for the nav- * igation data?\" Jai asked. \"I know,\" Delgado muttered. \"I don\u0027t particularly trust them either.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-7.html","bookId":1638,"book":{"id":1638,"title":"Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6)","description":"Storyline: Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6) In the first, desperate days of the Human-Covenant War, the UNSC has enacted the Cole Protocol to safeguard Earth and its Inner Colonies from discovery by a merciless alien foe. Many are called upon to rid the universe of lingering navigation data that would reveal the location of Earth. Among them is Navy Lieutenant Jacob Keyes. Thrust back into action after being sidelined, Keyes is saddled with a top secret mission by ONI. One that will take him deep behind enemy lines, to a corner of the universe where nothing is as it seems. Out beyond the Outer Colonies lies the planet Hesiod, a gas giant surrounded by a vast asteroid belt. As the Covenant continues to glass the human occupied planets near Hesiod, many of the survivors, helped by a stronghold of human Insurrectionists, are fleeing to the asteroid belt for refuge. They have transformed the tumbling satellites into a tenuous, yet ingenious, settlement known as the Rubble--and have come face-to-face with a Covenant settlement of Kig-Yar . . . yet somehow survived. News of this unlikely treaty has spread to the warring sides. Luckily for the UNSC, this uneasy alliance is in the path of the Spartan Gray Team, a three-man renegade squad whose simple task is to wreak havoc from behind enemy lines in any way they see fit. But the Prophets have also sent their best---an ambitious and ruthless Elite, whose quest for nobility and rank is matched only by his brutality . . . and who will do anything to secure his Ascendancy and walk the Path.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6.jpg","author":"Tobias S.
