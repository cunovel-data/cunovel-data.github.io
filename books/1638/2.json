{"id":97511,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"Lieutenant,\" Keyes coughed, his lungs protesting at his insistence of talking before they\u0027d had a chance to clear themselves out fully. \"Lieutenant Jacob Keyes.\" In the classroom he was Instructor Keyes, but back here on the deck he wanted the proper rank accorded. He\u0027d worked hard to get there in the years before he\u0027d been assigned to teaching due to injuries. He sat inside a long pod, one of many laid out in a row. The rest of the crew of the Armageddon\u0027s Edge were just starting to crawl out of their own pods. The crew members helped each other out, cracking jokes as some violently coughed up the fluid that they had breathed in to prevent their bodies from being damaged by the cold of the frozen sleep. The on-duty officer squatted next to Keyes. A thin Navy lifer, Edgar Sykes was a pale man in his mid-fifties, with short-cropped gray hair and dark brown eyes that squinted with amusement at the chance to give Keyes some grief. \"How was your date with the Admiral\u0027s wife, Lieutenant? Been a while since you were put on ice?\" Some of the other crew, already standing and pulling on clothes, glanced over with grins. Keyes had been in the classroom too long; he didn\u0027t get the joke. \"I\u0027m sorry?\" Keyes asked. \"The Admiral\u0027s wife?\" Sykes pointed at the pod. \"A frosty bed?\" Oh, Keyes thought. That\u0027s what the crew called the pods now. They\u0027d just been called \"freezers\" the last time he\u0027d shipped out. \"Not something you forget easily,\" Keyes rasped, rubbing his arms for warmth. The chill of the cryogenic pod permeated every last cell. Even worse than the chill, however, were the old injuries from his time on the Meriwether Lewis that flared up. The deep gouging plasma burn to his thigh, the shattered-then-rebuilt hand that he clenched and then opened again. They had sidelined him, and kept him in front of wide-eyed noncommissioned officers, playing the role of a classroom drill sergeant. He carefully shifted himself to the. side of the pod. The injuries had healed enough over time. Enough that on most days, now, they were only a faded memory, a twinge when he tried a little too hard in the gym. But the freezer seemed to bring it out more. Sykes reached out a hand to help him as he noticed Keyes\u0027s careful movement. Keyes looked at the man. \"You asking me out on a date?\" That got a few chuckles from the crew. Sykes nodded. \"Alright, Keyes. Welcome aboard Armageddon\u0027s Edge.\" He turned to the crew. \"What the hell do you think you\u0027re all looking at?\" Eyes darted back as the crew resumed their tasks, and the chatter faded. A smartly pressed gray uniform lay on the side of Keyes\u0027s pod. He pulled it on, checking to make sure the double silver bars signifying Lieutenant were clipped on. It felt good to be back in uniform, especially on deck. As time passed from his service aboard the Meriwether Lewis he felt that the chances of being involved on the bridge of a ship again were slipping further away from him. It stung. Still, at forty, Keyes made sure to get up early for his ten-mile run, and he hit the weight room at least three times a week. He was terrified of getting soft. He\u0027d learned, back when the Meriwether Lewis had been boarded, that it gave him an edge. Even if the edge today remained his ability to outrun his students in physical training, it was still useful in that it earned their respect. Service was service. If the Navy needed Lieutenant Jacob Keyes to serve out the next couple of decades teaching navigators how to fly their ships, then that was what they needed him for. Everyone had their place, their role to play. With the alien forces destroying planet after planet, with people giving their lives just to slow them down, Keyes felt there was no room for self-pity. He reserved those darker moments for thinking about things like his sister, out there on the Outer Colony of Dwarka. Wondering about her fate ever since the colony had gone silent, too far away for the UNSC to even try to defend. When he\u0027d gotten the orders to leave Luna, he\u0027d only taken the time to visit his daughter, Miranda. The last time he\u0027d had orders to ship out somewhere he hadn\u0027t had family of his own. He was just an eager, young man. Now it felt like he had to tear himself away. He\u0027d grown accustomed to picking her up every day and bringing her back to the small on-base apartment they shared. He\u0027d kissed Miranda good-bye and let her know she\u0027d have to stay at the dorms in her school, just like all the other children with family on duty. She was a good Navy kid -- she actually perked up at the news and asked what ship he was flying out on. Someone cleared their throat behind Keyes. He turned to find a man standing there in full pilot\u0027s kit, helmet slung under one arm. The pilot saluted. \"Good morning, sir. I\u0027m Petty Officer Jeffries. I\u0027m taking you dirtside.\" Keyes leaned forward and tugged at the pilot\u0027s bedraggled uniform. \"I hope you don\u0027t fly as sloppy as you dress.\" Some ships, like the Armageddon\u0027s Edge, ran a little off kilter. Captain\u0027s prerogative. What mattered to many at command was their battle performance, and Keyes had heard the Edge had limped back to Earth with pride for a full refit after it had paired with another ship to take out a Covenant Destroyer. Still, Keyes felt it didn\u0027t hurt to make a point. \"Sir?\" \"If you can\u0027t bother to fasten your buttons, keep your insignia on straight, and follow procedure, why should I feel safe getting in your bird?\" \"Sir, because my uniform doesn\u0027t have to drop soldiers off in hot zones. Sir.\" Keyes relented a little. \"Okay, Jeffries. Let\u0027s see what you\u0027ve got waiting for me.\" Petty Officer Jeffries approached a green, battle-scarred Pelican dropship squatting next to two others in the Armageddon\u0027s Edge\u0027s tight storage bay. The sides had been splashed and gouged by energy beams. Keyes followed the pilot as he walked under the high rear wings and engine nacelles up the ramp into the belly. Jeffries walked past the webbing, storage bins, and the seats lining the walls to climb up into the cockpit. \"You can strap in behind me, sir.\" Jeffries said. \"You don\u0027t have to ride back there. I don\u0027t want to get lonely on this trip. There\u0027s room under your feet for your kit bag.\" The ramp groaned as it slowly closed, the hold of the drop-ship darkening. Once it clanged shut and sealed, Jeffries tossed his helmet aside. \"Don\u0027t have to stay airtight on this milk run. Not exactly leaping into combat today, are we?\" No, thought Keyes, flashing back to the times he\u0027d been in combat. They certainly weren\u0027t. Combat was men strapped shoulder to shoulder in the back, while you weaved and ducked a Pelican through anti-aircraft bursts. Your palms would be sweating and your breath heavy in the confined space of your own helmet. Combat was when the cockpit you were sitting in smelled of blood, and fear. Keyes clicked back to the present as Jeffries flicked and tapped the console in front of him, bringing the Pelican to life. In the copilot\u0027s seat Keyes kept an eye on things. Jeffries ran the systems check with a bewildering rapidity that could only come with practice and familiarity. There was a photo of a brunette with two boys taped to the side of the cockpit window. Keyes pointed at it. \"Your kids?\" \"Yes sir. You have any?\" \"A daughter,\" Keyes said. The four engines wound themselves up, a kick that shuddered through the entire frame of the Pelican. \"Gamma to Armageddon\u0027s Edge, preflight check is green, systems nominal, flight plan filed. Permission to fly?\" Jeffries sounded bored. \"Gamma 54, hold tight for the trapdoor,\" came the breezy response from the bridge. The ship\u0027s bay doors opened to reveal the planet beneath. Thin, long clouds covered the unfamiliar green-and-brown-colored continental shapes. Keyes hadn\u0027t had time to read up much about his destination. He\u0027d gotten his orders at lunch, and been bundled off and frozen in an Armageddon\u0027s Edge cyrogenic pod by dinner. \"What brings you out all the way from Luna to see the wonderful skies of Chi Rho, sir?\" There wasn\u0027t a lot of room for a Pelican to move in the Armageddon\u0027s Edge\u0027s bay, but Jeffries gunned the four thrusters and the Pelican hopped up and forward, and then, just as abruptly, spun and dove through the bay doors. Jeffries was looking back over his shoulder at him, showing off that he could get out of the ship\u0027s bay without even paying attention. Keyes didn\u0027t give the pilot the satisfaction of a flinch. But Keyes was impressed. The dangerous stunt showed Jeffries could fly blind. And damn well, too. \"Orders, Petty Officer. Orders.\" \"We go where they tell us, right?\" \"You know it.\" Keyes glanced up through the shielded glass, catching a glimpse of the medium-sized ship that had taken him all the way from the home system. Craters pocked the ship\u0027s surface, and burn streaks crisscrossed the arrowhead-shaped nose of the ship. Despite a refit, the scars remained from the ship\u0027s last encounter. Armageddon\u0027s Edge dwindled away as Jeffries thundered them down in a long arc toward the atmosphere. The Pelican shook and shuddered as heat built up from atmospheric reentry. Streaks of glowing red filled the air. \"Do you know if there are any training stations for patrol craft here, Jeffries?\" Keyes asked suddenly. Jeffries checked a monitor, then glanced back. \"Training stations? Here? Sir, Chi Rho is for repairs and drydocking. Support for the front line. There\u0027s no training out here. All you have to do is head out a few days and run into a Covenant long-range patrol -- you\u0027ll get all the training you need.\" \"I thought so.\" Keyes looked out through the red haze. Chi Rho was an Inner Colony world. Not as developed or as large as the mother planet, but still home to hundreds of millions of people on its primary continent and Earthlike surface. But Chi Rho was the closest Keyes had been in some time to that somewhat gray, invisible line where planets turned from the Inner Colonies to the Outer Colonies. With worlds scattered so far from each other, and travel being a long and sometimes dangerous affair, news traveled slowly, and most of it came through UNSC channels of late. Every citizen knew that the Covenant were slowly destroying human planets from orbit, world by world. Only the UNSC stood in their way, fighting for every bloody inch. And even the UNSC\u0027s official bulletins indicated that most of the Outer Colonies had been destroyed -- glassed with incredibly powerful energy weapons, the likes of which the UNSC had never seen. Every day for the past nine years, since the first encounters with the aliens, the front line had moved closer to Chi Rho and the outer edge of the Inner Colonies. Keyes knew this was not where you trained green pilots. But his orders, strange as they were, said that he was to get out to Chi Rho at full speed for a training exercise.\u0027 Even a follow-all-commands Navy lifer like Keyes knew the orders were a load of crap. A cover for something else. And that something else might involve getting back aboard a ship, Keyes found himself daring to hope. Maybe even the recently patched up Armageddon\u0027s Edge. Chapter TWO CHIRHO, ECTANUS 45 SYSTEM Jeffries dropped out of his flight plan pattern and came in low over a large park, the tops of the trees whipping about in the fury of engine backwash. Birds scattered in their wake, rising to the sky in flocks of green and blue. He angled the Pelican back, flaring the craft out for a spectacular, bone-jarring landing that had Keyes grabbing the arms of his chair. Again, Jeffries was showing off. The engines whined down as he cut them, and dirt slowly settled back to the ground. Keyes considered giving Jeffries a hard time for the unusual approach, then decided against it. He wasn\u0027t this man\u0027s bridge crew. Just let it go, he told himself. \"I\u0027ll be here waiting for you when you get back, sir.\" Jeffries said. \"Taking you to your next location.\" Keyes unsnapped himself from the copilot\u0027s seat. \"Where are we going next?\" \"Don\u0027t know, sir,\" Jeffries said, twisting back. \"My orders are to wait for you to come back, and presumably you\u0027ll know where we\u0027re going next.\" Keyes walked up to the front of the cockpit and looked out the window. \"What is all that?\" Out around the dirt patch they\u0027d landed in, rows and rows of small wooden stakes had been sunk into the ground. Beyond them, what looked like young stalks of corn poked up through the tilled soil. But right near the woods, which Keyes could tell had been recently cut down, a large sign proclaimed the area as the Bacigalupi Memorial Nature Preserve. \"Victory Gardens,\" Jeffries said. \"Victory Farms is more like it, I guess. Anywhere you can grow crops and food, no matter the surface, we\u0027re using it. The Outer Colonies used to grow most of the food, so we\u0027re experiencing shortages here. I\u0027ll drop the ramp for you.\" Keyes walked to the back of the Pelican as daylight filled the inside. The ramp lowered to reveal a Warthog waiting for him, along with a completely dust-covered and annoyed-looking private in olive camo, a battle rifle slung under one arm. The private looked tiny compared to the bulky, armored, oversized all-terrain vehicle. Keyes had always liked the Warthog\u0027s metal tusks on either side of the tow winch, which were ostensibly metal guards. The private saluted. \"Lieutenant Keyes?\" Keyes nodded. \"That\u0027s me.\" \"Private Tom Gerencer. I\u0027m your ride the rest of the way, sir.\" The marine hopped into the driver\u0027s seat of the massive vehicle. Keyes followed. \"Sorry about the drop-off point, but our main sites are overrun by tent cities. Traffic\u0027s snarled, so it\u0027s more of a pain than it\u0027s worth. Better to drop you straight in.\" \"Tent cities?\" Keyes stared at the marine sitting next to him. Had things really gotten this bad? He felt like his stomach had been kicked. Keyes and his neighbors often shuttled to Earth to visit relatives or to enjoy some fine dining and sightseeing. Meanwhile out here large numbers of people were living hand to mouth. Was the UNSC censoring so much that not even a whiff of all this had reached Earth? They must have been. This was dire stuff. Gerencer nodded. He drove them down the dirt road, spinning the large, grippy balloon tires as he gunned the Warthog toward another dirt road","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-2.html","bookId":1638,"book":{"id":1638,"title":"Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6)","description":"Storyline: Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6) In the first, desperate days of the Human-Covenant War, the UNSC has enacted the Cole Protocol to safeguard Earth and its Inner Colonies from discovery by a merciless alien foe. Many are called upon to rid the universe of lingering navigation data that would reveal the location of Earth. Among them is Navy Lieutenant Jacob Keyes. Thrust back into action after being sidelined, Keyes is saddled with a top secret mission by ONI. One that will take him deep behind enemy lines, to a corner of the universe where nothing is as it seems. Out beyond the Outer Colonies lies the planet Hesiod, a gas giant surrounded by a vast asteroid belt. As the Covenant continues to glass the human occupied planets near Hesiod, many of the survivors, helped by a stronghold of human Insurrectionists, are fleeing to the asteroid belt for refuge. They have transformed the tumbling satellites into a tenuous, yet ingenious, settlement known as the Rubble--and have come face-to-face with a Covenant settlement of Kig-Yar . . . yet somehow survived. News of this unlikely treaty has spread to the warring sides. Luckily for the UNSC, this uneasy alliance is in the path of the Spartan Gray Team, a three-man renegade squad whose simple task is to wreak havoc from behind enemy lines in any way they see fit. But the Prophets have also sent their best---an ambitious and ruthless Elite, whose quest for nobility and rank is matched only by his brutality . . . and who will do anything to secure his Ascendancy and walk the Path.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6.jpg","author":"Tobias S.
