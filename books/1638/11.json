A hologram of a plasma pistol appeared. \"A shipping container was found in a routine board-and-search late last week on its way to Charybdis IX. It contained three thousand fully charged plasma pistols on board, and a thousand plasma rifles.\" \"Enough to arm a significant number of Insurrectionists,\" Kirtley said. He folded his arms. \"Correct,\" Watanabe said. \"Now, this was a slow freighter, and ONI agents from Charybdis IX intercepted it well before it got to the planet. It had another week of travel yet to get to orbit. Our orders are to head out to Charybdis IX and meet with ONI agents there. We\u0027re going to find out who\u0027s receiving these guns, where they come from, and why the Covenant is acting in a whole new manner with this gunrunning.\" They all sat in silence, digesting the mission. Commander Zheng stood up. \"Well, it sounds like this is going to lead us to Insurrectionists. And I don\u0027t know about you all, but I\u0027m ready to repay them for what they just did.\" \"Yessir,\" they all chorused. Except Badia, who glanced down at the floor and closed her eyes. Keyes wondered if she was thinking about all the dead from the last engagement. \"Then let\u0027s get to it. Keyes, lay us on a course straight for Charybdis IX ... after our random jump, of course.\" Zheng leaned back, watching them all with calculating eyes. \"Of course, sir.\" Keyes looked around at the bridge crew as they stood up. They were on their way to forming a comfortable team in a surprisingly short time. And judging by the tiny smile Zheng had on his lips, he felt the same way. Maybe Keyes had read his standoffishness wrong; maybe Zheng was just eager to get back to the fight. No matter which, it was still a good thing to see a ship\u0027s crew coming together. Keyes had a feeling it would be important. Insurrectionists and Covenant working together left a very bad taste in his mouth. They\u0027d need to be at their fighting best on this ship in the days ahead. But whatever Zheng may have had in mind, Keyes noticed that the other officers seemed eager to get out of the chartroom and back to their duties, at a safe remove from the Commander. Chapter ELEVEN UNSC FRIGATE MIDSUMMER NIGHT, CHARYBDIS IX Keyes moved down the corridor quickly, crewmen snapping to attention as he passed. He had just laid them into a geosynchronous orbit over Charybdis IX, right above the capital city of Scyllion. A Pelican was being prepped to take Akio Watanabe dirt side. Things were moving along. He paused at a corridor. The hanger bay would be this way. He was still getting a feel for the frigate: adding to the ship\u0027s speed meant reconfiguring the normal layout of a ship of this class. \"Lieutenant Keyes,\" buzzed a frantic voice in his earpiece. \"We need you at sickbay, now. It\u0027s Jeffries.\" Keyes turned around, then turned around again. Medical no longer lay at the heart of the ship, but farther off to the starboard. Keyes broke out of his fast walk into a half jog. If Jeffries died, he\u0027d never forgive himself for asking for his transfer. \"Lieutenant!\" It was Faison. He stepped out of the corner of a junction from behind a bulkhead. \"Yes?\" Five Helljumpers tackled Keyes from the side. He went down, shocked. Then self-defense training kicked in. Keyes fought his way free of the hands holding his legs and kicked the nearest Helljumper in the head. The kick sent the man down, but not before another behind Keyes put him in a chokehold. Sputtering, Keyes managed to swing and dish out a black eye. He ripped free of their holds again, but three more Helljumpers joined the fray. They came with duct tape. Keyes found himself being trussed up and dragged into a nearby storage room, the door locked behind them. \"What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing?\" he shouted. The Helljumpers surrounded the furious Keyes, who was then raised up onto a table with a solid thump. Faison walked over and viewed the results. He nodded. \"Good.\" \"Hoo-ah,\" they replied. \"Lieutenant Jacob Keyes.\" Faison leaned over and looked him in the eyes. \"Do you know how many Navy brass have pulled rank on me in the middle of combat action?\" \"I have no idea, Mr. Faison.\" The Helljumper smiled. \"None, Mr. Keyes. At least, none that have lived.\" Keyes knew that the Helljumpers regarded themselves as tougher, more willing to fight, than regular marines or Navy men. They were certainly far crazier. Faison pointed at one of the men. \"Chesnik, do it.\" A buzzing sound came from Keyes\u0027s right. One of the Helljumpers whipped out a huge Bowie knife -- and cut the sleeve off Keyes\u0027s uniform. A smarting pain shot up his shoulder. He twisted to look. Chesnick was holding a portable tattoo machine, a long metal penlike tool with an ink reservoir on the end. Chesnick leaned in and pressed the needle into Keyes\u0027s arm and started etching a careful swoop. Keyes stopped struggling, leaning back as the needle continued its smarting journey over his arm. \"You\u0027re all crazy,\" he said. \"Guess I won\u0027t have to court-martial you, though.\" He took a deep breath. \"Well, aren\u0027t we lucky,\" Chesnick replied, and then leaned back. \"Done.\" Faison pulled out a huge knife of his own from an ankle sheath. It had the words \"Bug-Hunter\" traced on the blade. He sliced the duct tape off. \"You\u0027d make a hell of a marine, Keyes,\" Faison said. \"You saved a lot of our asses out there.\" Keyes shook his head. \"Should have seen it coming earlier.\" \"No,\" Faison said. \"Anyone else would have stood there and let us do our job, and we\u0027d all be dead. We owe you, Keyes. You ever need a favor from a Helljumper, no matter where, you just roll up your sleeve and ask.\" They opened the door, and it seemed like half the ship\u0027s Helljumpers were waiting in the corridor. \"You\u0027re not bad for an officer,\" said Markov, just outside the door. \"But if you ever take my armor again, it\u0027s your ass.\" \"By the way, next time, try not to scream so much,\" another Helljumper shouted while laughing. The center of the corridor became a gauntlet, with Helljumpers pushing Keyes on through all the way down the line, many of them slapping the newly inked tattoo and laughing as he winced. At the end of the line Akio Watanabe waited stiffly. \"If you don\u0027t mind, Lieutenant Keyes, now that you\u0027re done playing with your new friends, I have a favor to ask.\" Keyes had a wide grin on his face from the relief that the Helljumpers weren\u0027t actually going to kill him and a bit of pride from their actions. \"Of course, Major Watanabe. What is it?\" \"I\u0027d like you to come dirt side with me. There are not a lot of people I implicitly trust. The nature of the job, you know. Judging by your actions, you seem like a man I could trust with my life, implicitly. I would count most of the bridge crew as trustworthy, given my research on them, but to be honest, Mr. Keyes, I think they just plain don\u0027t like me. How that would play into a split second\u0027s hesitation to back me up in a dangerous situation, I\u0027m not sure ...\" \"You\u0027re a cynical man, Major.\" Keyes did not like Watanabe\u0027s judgment of his fellow officers. A force was only as good as the man next to him. It was who you fought for, when it came down to it, but that bond started with a fundamental trust. A trust that Watanabe did not have. \"Comes with the job.\" Watanabe\u0027s smile wasn\u0027t so much a smile, but bared teeth. \"Will you come anyway?\" Keyes nodded stiffly. \"If those are your orders, of course.\" Watanabe grabbed Keyes\u0027s arm and looked at the lettering. \"The ODST tattoo. They must really like you. You know what it means?\" \"No.\" Keyes shook his head, pulling his arm back. Watanabe kept his grip on the arm. It was surprisingly tight. \"The kanji stand for \u0027bastard,\u0027 or \u0027bad ass,\u0027 depending on who you talk to. Lieutenant?\" \"Yes?\" Watanabe let go of Keyes\u0027s arm. \"Make sure you visit the ship\u0027s armory before we leave.\" Chapter TWELVE SCYLLION, CHARYBDIS IX Scyllion burned. Jeffries lazily swung the Pelican above the tightly clustered skyscrapers of the city, and through patches of billowing, black smoke from burning piles of furniture and barrels on the roads. \"Food riots,\" Watanabe said, hanging on to webbing and looking out the back of the Pelican with Keyes. Jeffries had already lowered the ramp for a hot drop. Keyes walked to the back and looked out. \"I never thought I\u0027d see anything like that in the Inner Colonies.\" \"Hold tight, sir,\" Jeffries shouted back. The Pelican slowly banked around a set of towers. Watanabe looked out at the random pillars of smoke mingled among the concrete, steel, and mirrored windows of the city. \"It started as a corporate mining town. The whole thing was laid out and designed to keep all money in the corporation. You worked for them, paid rent to stay in an apartment they built run by a division of the mining company. You shopped at company-run stores. You traveled on the company line. It is an example that used to be taught in business schools.\" \"So what\u0027s happening now?\" As Jeffries straightened the Pelican out the city fell away behind them, towers glinting as the sun sunk down behind the city skyline, its orange hues streaking the clouds. Scyllion looked as if it were made of gold due to the sunset filtering through its windows. \"They had a monopoly: they started raising prices dramatically. People became trapped. Once here, the price of living exceeded their company pay, putting them further and further in debt with no way out. \"It became a problem when a rival company tried to get mining rights and was barred by the puppet government the company had funded here on Charybdis IX. So the new company funded dissatisfied and trapped workers back in \u002725, hoping to shake things up politically a bit, and Scyllion\u0027s police shot a few of them during a protest march. Since then, Insurrectionists have been a huge problem here. Scyllion\u0027s corporate masters are now spending more money on trying to get everything they can off planet and back to colonies closer to Earth to protect their assets. ONI recommended that the UNSC implement martial law last year. \"We just don\u0027t have the troops and ships to spare,\" Watanabe finished. The Pelican flew over the edges of Scyllion, passing over a long snaking river. Warehouses lined the banks, and large container ships lay at dock next to concrete wharfs. \"Here we are,\" Jeffries announced in their earpieces. The Pelican slowed, its engines swiveling to redirect thrust. They landed on a pad on top of one of the warehouses. Watanabe let go of the webbing and walked down the ramp. Keyes followed him. The Pelican revved up and lifted off, leaving them on the suddenly quiet rooftop pad. A woman with long hair and grubby gray overalls stood waiting for them at the stairwell leading down to the warehouse. \"Corinthia Hansen,\" Watanabe said. He shook her hand. \"Lieutenant Keyes, this is our ONI contact on the ground here. She\u0027s been coordinating tracking the influx of Covenant weapons and trying to get them off the street to be examined and destroyed. She was also responsible for intercepting the Insurrectionist ship.\" \"Good to see you, Major Watanabe.\" She looked at Keyes. \"What\u0027s the Navy here for?\" \"Peace of mind. A line to further resources back in orbit if we need it.\" Watanabe looked around the pad. \"Your report said you had crew uniforms and fifteen agents?\" \"Downstairs, in the Hogs. You can change en route, we\u0027re short on time.\" \"Why the rush?\" Watanabe asked. \"I thought we had more time?\" \"Yeah, in case you didn\u0027t notice, the city is rioting. It\u0027s only a matter of time before the crowds downtown decide that there might be food or resources out here. The Insurrectionists agree -- they\u0027re coming in early to take the guns. So let\u0027s get rolling.\" Keyes raised an eyebrow. In his experience changing plans on the fly added to the potential of things going wrong. Chapter THIRTEEN SCYLLION WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, CHARYBDIS IX Civilian Warthogs waited in a line for them on the lower floor of the empty warehouse, as well as three large trucks pulling containers. Hansen had them get in the back of the truck in the middle. It was full of stacked crates, with just a four-foot empty gap near the doors. Or at least Keyes thought so, until Hansen walked to the wall of crates and pressed her palm against them. The crates swung aside. Inside was a fully furnished mobile command center. Screens hung from the walls with information, and ONI agents stood in front of them, murmuring into microphones. At the back agents in black body armor checked their weapons and eyed Watanabe and Keyes warily. The ONI mobile command center jerked into motion, and Keyes grabbed a wall. Hansen pulled a gun out from her waistband and handed it to one of the agents. \"We\u0027re hoping we can help you out, Watanabe, and get them to give up what system the weapons came from. But I\u0027m pretending to be crew of that ship, so it\u0027s dicey. Our main goal is to give these Innie creeps the crates, and then see where in the city they end up. Give them a few days to talk around the crates, give us some intelligence, then we can roll in and bust them. Because the last thing we need are the mobs that are out there right now getting their hands on Covenant weapons.\" She walked away from them both to go check on one of the monitors. Keyes leaned over to Watanabe. \"I get the feeling you\u0027re not exactly wanted here. They seem to think they\u0027ve got the whole thing figured out.\" Watanabe shrugged dramatically. \"Between your crew and these agents, my not being wanted around places seems to be a character failing of mine, I\u0027m sure.\" Hansen looked back down the center as Keyes laughed. She waved them over. \"Here\u0027s an example of the product.\" She picked up a hefty Covenant plasma rifle and gave it to Watanabe. Unlike the ulitarian, industrial human weapons, the Covenant device was smooth and aerodynamic, almost organic. The plasma rifle consisted of what looked like two large semiautomatic weapons welded together: one on","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-11.html","bookId":1638,"book":{"id":1638,"title":"Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6)","description":"Storyline: Halo: The Cole Protocol (Halo #6) In the first, desperate days of the Human-Covenant War, the UNSC has enacted the Cole Protocol to safeguard Earth and its Inner Colonies from discovery by a merciless alien foe. Many are called upon to rid the universe of lingering navigation data that would reveal the location of Earth. Among them is Navy Lieutenant Jacob Keyes. Thrust back into action after being sidelined, Keyes is saddled with a top secret mission by ONI. One that will take him deep behind enemy lines, to a corner of the universe where nothing is as it seems. Out beyond the Outer Colonies lies the planet Hesiod, a gas giant surrounded by a vast asteroid belt. As the Covenant continues to glass the human occupied planets near Hesiod, many of the survivors, helped by a stronghold of human Insurrectionists, are fleeing to the asteroid belt for refuge. They have transformed the tumbling satellites into a tenuous, yet ingenious, settlement known as the Rubble--and have come face-to-face with a Covenant settlement of Kig-Yar . . . yet somehow survived. News of this unlikely treaty has spread to the warring sides. Luckily for the UNSC, this uneasy alliance is in the path of the Spartan Gray Team, a three-man renegade squad whose simple task is to wreak havoc from behind enemy lines in any way they see fit. But the Prophets have also sent their best---an ambitious and ruthless Elite, whose quest for nobility and rank is matched only by his brutality . . . and who will do anything to secure his Ascendancy and walk the Path.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6.jpg","author":"Tobias S.
