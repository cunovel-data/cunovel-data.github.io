{"id":92927,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"They were all there when Crow and his Team came rolling in for that last job. All the policemen and local officials. The mayor. The school board. It was that kind of small Indiana town.\\n\\n It was that kind of hot summer day, too. The crowd faded quickly back from the billowing dust raised by the semis on the milk-white gravel driveway, holding hankies to their faces and coughing. Then they stood on the brown grass and watched the procession circle deafeningly around them and pull up in front of the great house.\\n\\n The engines on all five vehicles stopped at once. Jack Crow stepped from the lead Jeep and stood there, all six-feet-two of muscle and resolve and mean. He stood for a moment, glancing up at the target. When he turned back the local officials stood about him in a semicircle, as if for warmth.\\n\\n In fact for warmth.\\n\\n Crow smiled easily at them. He shook hands with the round nervous-faced mayor. He glanced at his watch. It was high noon and 105 degrees.\\n\\n Time to start killing.\\n\\n They dynamited the south wing ten minutes later. The charge went off on a second-story balcony and drove the entire section flat to the ground like an angry fist. There was a lot more smoke, a lot more dust. They waited. Soon it was sunny again. The grapples began snagging at the wreckage and dragging it away.\\n\\n The townsmen watched it all, wincing at the first screech of steel members on the masonry. They watched the machinery lumbering into position. They watched the crew of five appear from the van with their eight-foot-long pikes and stand ready. Mostly, they watched Crow.\\n\\n They probably didn\u0027t jump more than a foot the first time the rubble moved on its own.\\n\\n \"Boss!\" called a young blond man named Cat from his lawn chair crow\u0027s nest atop one of the semis. \"I think we have one.\" He stood up, shading his eyes against the bright sunlight and pointing. \"Right there on the end.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" replied Crow calmly. \"Rock and roll.\"\\n\\n The crew moved into position encircling the area as best as the broken shard footing allowed. From their back pockets they took what looked like women\u0027s long opera gloves and put them on. The steel mesh fabric glinted brightly. The townsmen, probably without realizing it, stepped closer together.\\n\\n Then Crow, dragging cable from the broad grapple clenched in his huge right fist, stepped through the circle of his men and stabbed a prong deep into the cornice lodged heavily over the target area. He stepped back and held out his left hand. Somebody handed him a crossbow the size of a swingset and then everybody just stood there for a moment.\\n\\n It started almost the instant Jack\u0027s signal to the crane pulled the cable taut. The masonry had barely tilted to one side when the first fiend came whistling and smoking into the agony of the sun\u0027s rays, shrieking like a harpy and stabbing out with black claws and dead gray fangs and then spouting a vile black glob as Crow\u0027s first shot drove a bolt the size of a baseball bat through its chest and spine and eight inches into the cornice behind it.\\n\\n It writhed and howled and burned and cried and dragged with maniacal frenzy at the wooden stake, but the umbrella barbs kept it lodged tight, killing it, killing it, rubbing it away from the world of earth and man and bright summer Indiana afternoons.\\n\\n \"Now that,\" offered Cat after several seconds of heavy silence, \"was weird.\"\\n\\n The mayor turned to the elder town councilman and chuckled. The latter responded in kind. Soon all the townsmen were laughing and laughing with the break of the tension and with the relief that maybe after all the horror of the past months and - And nobody else was laughing. Not Cat, peering disgustedly down from his perch above them, none of the other members of the crew, and not Jack Crow, whose look of withering disdain turned them pale to a man.\\n\\n When they had gotten very quiet for a very long five seconds Jack said, \"The leader shouldn\u0027t have popped first. He usually sends everyone else ahead.\"\\n\\n \"How...\" began the mayor before his voice cracked. cleared his dry throat and tried again. \"How do you know it was the leader?\"\\n\\n Jack lit a cigarette and stared at the ground. \"After a while,\" he replied softly, \"you can tell.\"\\n\\n He stood there quietly like that for several seconds. Then he looked at them, actually looked at the individual townsmen for the first time.\\n\\n It had wilted them. The horror, the losses, the sense of total naked impotence.\\n\\n Wilted.\\n\\n And it was only going to get worse.\\n\\n So what, he thought next, are you gonna do when it\u0027s over, gents? When your town has seen you as worthless and craven and you feel your manhood has been stomped?\\n\\n Are you gonna do what others have tried?\\n\\n Are you gonna take it out on us?\\n\\n When it\u0027s over, are you going to cheat us to show you\u0027re still men?\\n\\n Because it really is gonna get worse. That was just the first one.\\n\\n \"All right,\" he barked abruptly, clapping his hands sharply together.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s get on with it. Rock and roll.\"\\n\\n And they did. And it did get worse. The second eruption was a howler and a screecher, again vile and terrifyingly fast, and the black bloody flecks fountained when the bolt struck it and slammed it back down and still it would not die until long seconds after one of the crew had punctured its skull with his pike.\\n\\n It was horribly gruesome.\\n\\n It was a broad-daylight nightmare.\\n\\n It was a woman each townsman had known for over forty years.\\n\\n After the schoolteacher came the local postmaster, the prom queen and her fullback fianc��, some hapless young college girl with the irreversible misfortune to blow a tire on a country lane that actually was dark and long but only appeared empty.\\n\\n The usual. But there was something wrong with the proportions.\\n\\n \"Nine in all, counting the leader,\" said Anthony reading from Cat\u0027s clipboard an hour and a half after the last appearance. \"But only three goons.\" He looked up from the page at his boss. \"They weren\u0027t very busy, were they?\"\\n\\n Crow took the clipboard from his hand and glanced at it. \"Nope,\" was his only response.\\n\\n Both men looked up at the sound of the Jeep returning up the driveway bearing Cat and the graveyard team. One of the townsmen approached them while they unloaded empty cans of soil coagulant and tossed them into the back of the semi.\\n\\n \"Do you think there\u0027s another pit somewhere?\" asked Anthony after a few seconds.\\n\\n Crow looked at his questioner, whose bull neck and massive shoulders remained taut from the pressure of the day. Crow decided he looked awful after five hours of slaughter, decided that was probably good.\\n\\n \"No,\" he answered. \"This is it. I never heard of them keeping goons somewhere else. New ones need to be around the leader anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Then how come - \"\\n\\n \"Dammit, Anthony! I don\u0027t know why they didn\u0027t turn more recently. Maybe they had something else to do.\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\" Anthony wanted to know.\\n\\n Crow sighed. They always came to him with questions like this. He was the elder veteran, three years at it now, and probably had, in fact, the longest career of this type in the world. But that didn\u0027t mean he knew shit about vampires. Nobody knew shit about vampires. Nobody lived long enough to learn, and it pissed him off the way they all looked at him to know all the answers. What right did they - he caught himself, took a deep breath. He looked again at Anthony, who had been an all-pro outside linebacker with the Seattle Seahawks when Crow had hired him. A man who was deeply loyal, sharply intelligent, and one of the bravest human beings he had ever seen, and who goddamn well deserved an answer from the man who claimed to be his boss and leader.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, buddy. I just don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n Crow told the pikemen to stand at ease, brought the demo bunch in to punch the last of the charges deep into the rubble and went over to talk to Cat who still stood chattering away with the townsmen. On the way he passed the local priest, Father Hernandez, stepping dully forward to turn his trick over the nine piles of ashes. Crow swallowed the resentment the old man\u0027s sighing gait brought up in him.\\n\\n \"Priests call it Joplin juice on account of Carl Joplin, the guy who put it together for us,\" Cat was saying to the mayor and another man whose name Crow didn\u0027t recall. \"It just makes it hard to climb up out of. Even without it, y\u0027know, it\u0027s too hard for most of \u0027em. Getting the damn coffin open at all is most of it. Remember - \"\\n\\n \"Cherry Cat!\" Crow called abruptly, not being able to stand it any longer. The townsmen, who just hours before had been too frightened to speak, were now full of patronizing pretend-interest questions about procedure. It was the kind of transition Crow had expected since noon, of course, but that didn\u0027t make it any better.\\n\\n Cat excused himself and stepped through their disapproving looks. Crow put an arm about Cat\u0027s shoulders and turned away with him, speaking in an obvious but inaudible whisper sure to be taken as the insult it was.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you see what\u0027s happening, goddammit?\"\\n\\n Cat sighed. \"Yeah.\" He looked hurt. And was, Crow reminded himself with more than a little amazement. \"Damn,\" continued Cat, \"I liked these people. Y\u0027know that banker guy, Foster? He\u0027s planning to build - \"\\n\\n \"Planning to cheat your ass blind and mine both.\"\\n\\n Cat frowned. He glanced in the direction of the townsmen without seeing them.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Cat at last.\\n\\n They lit cigarettes and started walking toward the trucks.\\n\\n \"But, y\u0027know, Jack? Not really,\" cried Cat in an abrupt plaintive whisper. \"They\u0027re just trying to pull themselves up outta the hole they\u0027re in.\" He stopped. \"You\u0027re the one who told me all this yourself.\"\\n\\n Crow was adamant. \"Then they shouldn\u0027t have got themselves in the hole in the first place.\"\\n\\n \"The vampires did that, Jack.\"\\n\\n \"Like hell they did. No sympathy, Cat. If they\u0027d had the damn guts to face it... And now they\u0027re trying to take it out on us for doing it for them.\"\\n\\n \"Right in front of them, and the whole town. Their town.\"\\n\\n Crow stopped and looked back the way they came. \"No sympathy,\" he repeated.\\n\\n \"Look, just because they\u0027re feeling a little... I don\u0027t know - ashamed, I guess - \"\\n\\n \"Did it ever occur to you that they have something to be ashamed about?\"\\n\\n They were silent for several seconds.\\n\\n \"All tight,\" said Cat at last with a sigh. \"I\u0027ll get it ready.\"\\n\\n Crow shook his head. \"No need. Not this time. I\u0027m not gonna put up with this shit this time.\"\\n\\n Cat eyed him briefly. \"Just the same I think I oughta - \"\\n\\n \"No, dammit!\" Crow all but shouted. \"Look! I\u0027m so tired of these bastards crawling over and begging us on bended knees because they aren\u0027t man enough to stand up to the creatures turning their wives and daughters into blood-whores. And then they try to pretend they aren\u0027t groveling little cretins by haggling over the price, like this is just another business deal, this had nothing to do with the fact that we just cratered when it counted.\"\\n\\n Crow stopped and panted with the anger, slamming his cigarette to the ground and lighting another.\\n\\n Cat waited him out until he was calm. \"Well, just in case,\" he began as casually as so guileless a man could, \"I\u0027ll set up the - \"\\n\\n \"Do what you want,\" Crow interrupted fiercely. \"But I\u0027m telling you I\u0027ve fucking had it with these twerps and all the others like \u0027em. I\u0027m putting my foot down.\" He jabbed his trembling index finger under Cat\u0027s nose. \"Do you hear me?\"\\n\\n Cat nodded meekly. \"I hear you.\"\\n\\n Crow nodded with satisfaction. He tossed his new cigarette to the ground, hitched up his pants, and stalked toward the circle of men still at the Jeep. He paused and jerked a ferocious glance back at his friend. \"I\u0027m putting my foot down!\" he snarled.\\n\\n Then he stalked ahead even faster. Halfway to the townsmen, Cat overheard his harsh whisper to himself: \"Putting it fucking down!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-1.html","bookId":2118,"book":{"id":2118,"title":"Vampire$","description":"Storyline: Vampire$ is about a tightly knit group of professional vampire killers. They may say they\u0027re in it for the money, but their death-defying bravado and warm male friendships are as intense as those in any soldier-hero epic. The irrepressible, foul-mouthed, hard-drinkin\u0027 Jack Crow--decked out in high-tech chain mail and wielding a fearsome crossbow--is the leader of the bunch. He\u0027s the sort of man who screams obscenities at the pope, and then weeps in the pontiff\u0027s lap over the horrors he\u0027s witnessed. Vampire$ is one gaudy, action-packed novel. The men are men, the women are vulnerable, and the vampires are mean, ugly monsters.
