{"id":92937,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Cat was having a very weird day.\\n\\n He sat there in the bishop\u0027s office between Father Adam and Jack and decided their new client, who was a Mrs. Tammy Hughes and who was also the mayor of Cleburne, Texas, was just a little too cheerful for this tale she had to tell.\\n\\n And that was pretty weird.\\n\\n Then there was the tale itself, all about half-formed goons (they couldn\u0027t be full vampires yet from her peeling-cheek description) stomping around the downtown Cleburne square chewing on people. The local police had tried to help, emptying magnum after magnum into those decomposing husks, and the goons had noticed it - roaring and spinning in pain - but had not stopped feeding. The only injuries were to the victims, who were dragged brutally away into an abandoned department store warehouse across from the county courthouse. The cops had cordoned the area off.\\n\\n And that was pretty weird, too. Cat had never heard of \u0027em being that obvious before. And besides, where was the master vampire during all of this? It was almost as if they were trying to advertise.\\n\\n Naw. That was too weird.\\n\\n And then of course there was Jack, who looked like hell and acted worse. Cat thought he hadn\u0027t slept the night before, and knew damn well something was bothering him, but when he tried to get to it, Jack told him to leave him alone.\\n\\n And that was weirdest of all.\\n\\n Cat glanced casually to his side and eyed Jack once more. He really looks awful sitting there with his neck crammed down in his shoulders and his throat pulsing hard. He looks like... I dunno. Like he\u0027s...\\n\\n Scared.\\n\\n Holy shit! What\u0027s going down here?\\n\\n All Adam felt was admiration at Jack\u0027s full and complete concentration. He didn\u0027t read Jack\u0027s fear, couldn\u0027t have through the haze of his own.\\n\\n Here I go at last, he thought.\\n\\n Jack listened to the rest and then got them out of there and back to the suite at the Adolphus. He didn\u0027t speak during the drive and didn\u0027t answer questions. He glanced occasionally at the rest of the team while Cat relayed what had happened in the bishop\u0027s office but he looked away when they looked back.\\n\\n It was a trap. And he didn\u0027t know how to tell them. He didn\u0027t know what to do. He didn\u0027t...\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n He excused himself about the time they got down to making plans for the job in Cleburne the next morning. He couldn\u0027t think, couldn\u0027t focus, couldn\u0027t face them. He went to the bathroom and closed the door and lit a cigarette and just sat there and feared.\\n\\n Three years at this. Three years and eighteen straight pits wiped clean. All of it dangerous. All of it bloody. All of it awful. And certain death hanging around all along.\\n\\n But now it\u0027s not a matter of blowing up buildings in broad daylight. Now it\u0027s a matter of staying alive through the next night anywhere in the world.\\n\\n Because if they know me, they can find me.\\n\\n Shit.\\n\\n And if they know me and find me they can set me up tn Cleburne, Texas, and that\u0027s exactly what they\u0027ve done and there\u0027s not one thing in the world I can do about it.\\n\\n Because we still have to go. It\u0027s what we do. It\u0027s where the vampires are.\\n\\n I wonder if -\\n\\n There was a tap-tap-tap on the bathroom door and be heard Cat\u0027s voice saying it was the mayor on the phone and did Jack want to take the call? Jack frowned. Hell, he didn\u0027t even know the mayor. What was his name? Goldblatt, or something? And then he realized the mayor Cat meant. Her, that Cleburne mayor. Calling him. Knowing where to call.\\n\\n He got up and dropped his cigarette in the bowl and flushed it because he didn\u0027t want the rest of them to know he was only in there to be a chickenshit and then he strolled into the main living room of the suite with all eyes on him and picked up the receiver.\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Crow?\" asked that same too-country voice.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Crow, I hate to disturb you at home. Or at your hotel, I mean. Or do you live there?\"\\n\\n So. You wanna know where I live do you?\\n\\n \"I live here.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. Well, I should think you\u0027d want to live with the rest of your employees. Your team, is it?\"\\n\\n \"We all live here.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n \"Miz Hughes, did you call for a reason?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes. It\u0027s about your check for $50,000...\"\\n\\n \"What about it? I told you we don\u0027t work without half up front.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I know, I know. I understand. I wasn\u0027t complaining. You\u0027ll get your check tonight as we agreed.\"\\n\\n \"Then what\u0027s the point?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I just thought that I could bring it over instead of using a messenger.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Come on over.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. Well, I couldn\u0027t do it right now. I\u0027ve got some... well, some shopping to do in town first. I so rarely get to come to Dallas. But being a man I don\u0027t think you\u0027d understand. Anyway, I just wondered if you were going to be there when I finished so I could give you the check personally.\"\\n\\n \"When would that be?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. About nine o\u0027clock?\"\\n\\n \"Would that be all right?\"\\n\\n What Jack wanted to say was:\\n\\n Let\u0027s get this straight, bitch. First you wanna know where we\u0027re gonna be after sundown because, while there are ghouls slaughtering your citizens in your courthouse square every night, you\u0027re gonna take the time to pick up some pantyhose?\\n\\n Right.\\n\\n But what he said was: \"We\u0027ll be here,\" and the both of them hung up with the mayor adding how anxious she was to meet the rest of the team.\\n\\n There was a mirror on the wall over the table holding the phone and Jack Crow stared at his reflection in it, stared at it good and hard until some things fell away and some others came clear to him again.\\n\\n \"Asshole,\" he whispered angrily at the face.\\n\\n It was time to be a leader. So do some leader-type shit for a change, you whining bastard!\\n\\n Rock and roll!\\n\\n He spun around and there they all were, his team, watching and waiting and wondering what was going on.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t tell them - this was his burden, godammit!\\n\\n He gave them orders instead.\\n\\n Get out. Get all the stuff you can carry easily and walk out of the hotel. Don\u0027t check out or in any way hint that you\u0027re not coming back soon. Women, take the limo.\\n\\n Gents, I want you all to...\\n\\n \"Carl? What\u0027s the range on that detector? Can you put the sensor in one spot and have it ring or whatever someplace else?\"\\n\\n Carl shrugged. \"If it\u0027s not too far.\"\\n\\n \"How about from this room to a truck parked down on the street?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. I... Hey! What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"Shaddup. Annabelle, take Davette and go to the Seven-Eleven on, I dunno, Mockingbird and Central, and get the number of the last pay phone in the row and start calling it after sundown every half hour. Don\u0027t stop moving except to do that. Adam? You go with them. Make sure they call from a different spot each time. In fact, you do the calling. Don\u0027t let them outta the car and don\u0027t let the driver stop the motor. You hear?\"\\n\\n Adam nodded. \"Yessir.\"\\n\\n \"All right. Let\u0027s go, folks. Now. The rest of us have got weapons to collect.\"\\n\\n No one moved. Then Annabelle stood up and faced him.\\n\\n \"Jack, I want to know what\u0027s going on!\" Her voice sounded frightened.\\n\\n Jack regarded her calmly. \"I don\u0027t blame you. Get moving.\"\\n\\n \"But I...\"\\n\\n \"Woman! This is not a debate! Move!\"\\n\\n They moved.\\n\\n At a quarter to nine their Chevy Suburban slid silently to the downtown curb. Cat was at the wheel. Jack sat beside him in the front seat, the crossbow between them. In the back seat Carl sat fiddling with his gadget.\\n\\n Jack rolled his window down and began to chain-smoke and told the others to shut the fuck up until he said otherwise. They shut up.\\n\\n At 8:54, on the dot, the detector went off like a fire bell. Carl and Cat jumped about a foot apiece. Jack just nodded to himself, a grim smile on his face.\\n\\n \"What,\" asked Cat, staring up at the hotel, \"does all this mean?\"\\n\\n Jack Crow took his eyes from the building and faced him.\\n\\n \"Rock and roll. Same as always. Only more so. Hit it.\"\\n\\n They made their connection at the phone outside the Seven-Eleven. Crow told Adam where to meet them, hung up, got back into the Suburban, and ordered Cat to drive to the Antwar Saloon.\\n\\n Cat did so. But nervously, with difficulty. For he found it hard to take his eyes from Jack Crow, whose silently roaring presence filled the cab.\\n\\n Jack stomped through the saloon doors with Cat and Carl trailing him. He hushed the waitress who tried to bar their ascent to Felix\u0027s apartment. They found him at his desk beside the widow overlooking the bar. He had seen them coming.\\n\\n Now he rose, frowning. \"Look, Crow. I - \"\\n\\n \"Cut the shit, Felix!\" snapped Crow, striding toward him.\\n\\n \"But I - \"\\n\\n Jack\u0027s fist slamming onto the desktop sounded like a thunderclap. It made the lamp jump.\\n\\n \"I said cut the shit! There\u0027s no time!\"\\n\\n And it was suddenly very quiet. Slowly, Crow sat down in the visitor\u0027s chair. Just as slowly, Felix sat down in his own. They both lit cigarettes.\\n\\n Then Jack leaned forward and told Felix what was what. In a calm, deliberate tone he explained about having to go to Cleburne, Texas, in the morning to fight vampires who not only knew they were coming but had arranged the trap just for them. Cat and Carl, standing by the door, exchanged pale glances.\\n\\n \"What do you mean it\u0027s a trap?\" Cat interrupted.\\n\\n Jack didn\u0027t bother to turn around. \"Think back, Cherry. He called my name when he chased the truck.\"\\n\\n Cat blinked, thought back, went suddenly more pale.\\n\\n \"My God,\" he whispered, almost to himself.\\n\\n Felix listened without a sound, looking tight and grim and dark through the smoke, as Jack finished his monologue.\\n\\n Jack was quiet for several seconds after he\u0027d finished. Then he leaned backward in his chair and held out his hand. After a second Carl reached into a pocket and brought out a slim wooden box. Jack took the box without looking at Carl. He flipped the lid open and slid the box across the smooth desktop.\\n\\n The silver bullets gleamed brightly in the light from the lamp.\\n\\n \"You still use a Browning nine-millimeter?\" he asked gently.\\n\\n Felix was staring at the bullets. He nodded. Then he looked up at Crow. \"But I don\u0027t own one,\" he added hopefully.\\n\\n Jack smiled. He snapped his fingers above his head. Cat stepped forward carrying a canvas bag. From inside he took and unwrapped from cloth three automatics and laid them heavily on the wood-grained desktop.\\n\\n Then he stepped back.\\n\\n Felix stared at the guns. He rose slowly, put his hands in his pockets, and stepped over to the window and gazed blankly down. No one spoke, watching him.\\n\\n \"I want fifty thousand,\" he said after a while.\\n\\n \"Done.\"\\n\\n Felix nodded, looking miserable. Then he stepped to his phone and picked up the receiver. He pushed a button. Faintly, they heard the buzz of the phone at the bar below.\\n\\n \"Where? Felix. You\u0027ll have to take over for a couple of days. Yes. Yes... No, I\u0027m fine. Fine.\"\\n\\n Felix hung up. He stared through the window a few seconds longer. Then he lit a cigarette and put his free hand back in his pocket. When he turned back to them he said, \"I meant it about the fifty grand.\"\\n\\n Jack Crow\u0027s laugh was strong and loud and pure. He jumped to his feet and clapped his hands.\\n\\n \"I oughta charge you!\" He stepped to the center of the room and raised his fist into the air. \"Don\u0027t you feel it? You\u0027re about to go fight evil. Real live goddamned evil. The real stuff. You get to fight for the good side. How many people ever get a chance to do that?\" He laughed again, strode to Felix, and shook his fist under his face. \"Don\u0027t you feel it?\"\\n\\n Felix stared at him in amazement. He laughed shortly, shook his head.\\n\\n Damned if I don\u0027t, he thought with astonishment. A little.\\n\\n \"Well, I do!\" cried Cat from behind them. And he found himself grinning wildly. The Return of Jack Crow, he thought to himself, starring Jack Crow.\\n\\n He turned to Carl.\\n\\n \"Rock and roll!\"\\n\\n Carl smiled crazily back. \"Rock and roll,\" he echoed.\\n\\n Felix peered incredulously at the other three. \"I must be crazy!\"\\n\\n Jack laughed again. \"You really think that?\"\\n\\n Felix didn\u0027t answer. But he really did think that. He shook his bead again. This time they didn\u0027t even need that girl, he thought.\\n\\n And then he thought: I wonder what her name is?\\n\\n He looked at Crow \u0026 Co., still bright and vibrant and ready.\\n\\n I wonder if I\u0027ll live long enough to find out? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-11.html","bookId":2118,"book":{"id":2118,"title":"Vampire$","description":"Storyline: Vampire$ is about a tightly knit group of professional vampire killers. They may say they\u0027re in it for the money, but their death-defying bravado and warm male friendships are as intense as those in any soldier-hero epic. The irrepressible, foul-mouthed, hard-drinkin\u0027 Jack Crow--decked out in high-tech chain mail and wielding a fearsome crossbow--is the leader of the bunch. He\u0027s the sort of man who screams obscenities at the pope, and then weeps in the pontiff\u0027s lap over the horrors he\u0027s witnessed. Vampire$ is one gaudy, action-packed novel. The men are men, the women are vulnerable, and the vampires are mean, ugly monsters. Unless you don\u0027t like that sort of thing, you\u0027ll love it. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/vampire.jpg","author":"John Steakley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/vampire.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:17 PM"}}
