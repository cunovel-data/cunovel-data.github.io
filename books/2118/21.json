Just stunned a bit. And dazed. Too much story. Too much data. Too much monster. They really know how to rip up Life, don\u0027t they? But how did he feel about her? How did he really... ? Say it, you stalling buffoon! Do you still... love her? Yes, he thought at last. And he smiled. Now what, he wondered, am I smiling about? The only other door to the room - the one to the bedroom used by the ladies - opened. It was Annabelle. \"Is she okay?\" he whispered. Annabelle first closed the door carefully behind her. \"I think she\u0027ll sleep,\" she said. \"You should try to do the same.\" Felix looked around at the empty room filled with smoke and overflowing ashtrays and half-empty glasses. The others had gone to their rooms. \"I\u0027ll just give her a few minutes.\" Annabelle smiling knowingly. Sometime during Davette\u0027s tale she had busied herself knitting some large multicolored whatever. She resumed her seat and picked it up again. \"You were wonderful for her tonight,\" she said. Felix shrugged. \"Not hard to do.\" \"Then what took you so long?\" \"What do you mean?\" he asked innocently. \"I\u0027ve only known her for - \" \"Felix!\" she intoned, sounding like everyone\u0027s mother. He stopped short, grinned. \"Yeah. Well, I\u0027m not used to this falling-in-love-at-first-sight stuff.\" Annabelle grinned at him. \"That\u0027s better.\" \"And...\" \"And what?\" she asked. He turned around and busied himself making a drink he didn\u0027t need. \"I was angry that she was with Crow.\" \"What?\" Annabelle gasped. \"You thought that she and Jack were...\" \"Huh? Oh, no. Not at all. But...\" He lit a cigarette and looked at her. \"See, I\u0027ve been waiting for my wife to come along all my life and, well, avoiding this kind of shit at the same time. Then I see her and there\u0027s Jack and...\" He shook his head. \"I shoulda figured I couldn\u0027t have one without the other.\" She thought he looked almost embarrassed. \"She loves you, too, you know,\" she said. He looked up. \"You think?\" \"I know so.\" She eyed him carefully. \"Don\u0027t you?\" He looked at her quickly, looked down, smiled. \"Yeah.\" This time he was definitely embarrassed. \"Figures,\" he added, \"the way her luck\u0027s been running.\" And then they both smiled. How weird you are, Felix, she thought. What a weird, dark, scary young man you are. They were quiet for a while. \"Felix, what have you been doing all this time? Since Mexico?\" He shrugged. \"I run the saloon.\" \"All this time?\" He shrugged again. \"The past couple of years.\" \"And before that?\" But this time he just looked into his glass. Annabelle eyed him carefully, a smile curling up. \"Felix, just how rich are you?\" He looked at her, surprised. \"What makes you think I\u0027m...\" \"How rich?\" she insisted. He looked at her, relaxed, grinned. \"Very.\" \"Millions?\" He smiled. \"Many.\" She nodded, almost to herself. \"Rich, single, young, obviously well educated... Young man, what have you been doing all this time?\" And he looked at her and had no answer. But Jack Crow, at the doorway, did. \"He\u0027s been waiting for me.\" \"Sometimes, Jack,\" drawled Felix lazily, \"you sound just like you.\" And the three of them laughed. Crow fetched himself a glass of ice water and sat down across from them and got right to the point. \"What\u0027s it gonna be, Felix? You coming with us tomorrow, or not?\" Felix put his cigarette out and closed his eyes and rubbed them. \"I don\u0027t know, Jack. I guess so. You\u0027re going to Davette\u0027s house, right?\" \"Got to. Got to try.\" Felix nodded. \"I know. And... well, it\u0027s not like anyone\u0027s going to be there waiting for us. It\u0027s not another trap.\" \"Not so far as I know.\" Felix nodded again. \"Then I guess I\u0027m in.\" \"For tomorrow.\" \"Yeah.\" \"And after that?\" Felix lit a cigarette and blew the smoke out slowly. \"No, Jack. No. Jack, it\u0027s not... it\u0027s just that I don\u0027t think you\u0027re a good deal. Sorry.\" Crow shook his head. \"That\u0027s okay.\" But it hurt. Saying this was hurting Felix. And he wanted the other man to understand. \"Jack, it\u0027s just that... Dammit, they know who you are and they\u0027re gunning for you. And they\u0027re going to keep gunning for you. And you keep on doing this alone - \" Felix stopped abruptly, looked down. \"You shouldn\u0027t be doing this alone.\" Jack Crow\u0027s voice was so tired and his eyes were so bright as he replied, \"I know. But I can\u0027t get anyone else to help me.\" \"Yeah,\" Felix muttered. And no one spoke after that for awhile. Then Felix stood up, said good night, and left. Jack watched him go and after he was gone he sighed and dragged out a cigarette and a light and leaned back wearily without lighting it. He looks so tired, Annabelle thought. I\u0027ve never seen him so tired. And then she thought: I\u0027ve never seen him like this at all. And she felt the resentment for Felix welling up. Because Jack needed him so - they all needed him. Davette needed him. And Jack had been counting on him so much and he was so good at it and Jack was alone... So alone. \"Poor bastard,\" Jack muttered to himself. \"What?\" she asked. \"Felix.\" \"Felix?\" she asked, amazed. \"Why do you feel so sorry for him?\" Jack\u0027s smile was thin and grim. \"Because here\u0027s this poor jerk who\u0027s... Hell, he\u0027s young and bright and, in his own way, plenty, plenty strong. And he can\u0027t do a goddamned thing but shoot. But he doesn\u0027t want to shoot. Doesn\u0027t want to be a shooter. \"So he doesn\u0027t do anything at all.\" Annabelle frowned. \"Jack, you\u0027re not making me feel any better about him.\" He grinned. \"But don\u0027t you see? Don\u0027t you see how he\u0027s trapped? Hell, he\u0027s always been - \" \"All I see is you in a spot and a young... young I-don\u0027t-know is too scared to help you.\" \"Whoa, there, lady. It\u0027s not just scared. Besides, scared is smart. He - \" \"Jack! Would you stop defending him?\" she cried. He stopped, looked at her. \"The more you take up for him, the less I like him,\" she said with exasperation. And he grinned again. What is he smiling about? She had a bad thought. \"Jack, is that what you\u0027re hoping for, that the vampires will stop scaring him?\" He shook his head. \"Oh, no! They\u0027ll never stop scaring him.\" \"Then what?\" \"Sooner or later,\" he whispered fiercely, \"they\u0027re going to piss him off.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-21.html","bookId":2118,"book":{"id":2118,"title":"Vampire$","description":"Storyline: Vampire$ is about a tightly knit group of professional vampire killers. They may say they\u0027re in it for the money, but their death-defying bravado and warm male friendships are as intense as those in any soldier-hero epic. The irrepressible, foul-mouthed, hard-drinkin\u0027 Jack Crow--decked out in high-tech chain mail and wielding a fearsome crossbow--is the leader of the bunch. He\u0027s the sort of man who screams obscenities at the pope, and then weeps in the pontiff\u0027s lap over the horrors he\u0027s witnessed. Vampire$ is one gaudy, action-packed novel. The men are men, the women are vulnerable, and the vampires are mean, ugly monsters. Unless you don\u0027t like that sort of thing, you\u0027ll love it. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/vampire.jpg","author":"John Steakley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/vampire.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:17 PM"}}
