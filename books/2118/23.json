But without headlights, they couldn\u0027t see one from the other. \"Look at it comin\u0027 down!\" whispered the deputy in amazement. Felix, sitting beside him at the far end of the motorhome, nodded and put out his newly lit cigarette. It was too damn smoky in there already. But every time they tried to open the door to get some fresh air, the bloody thunderstorm about drowned them. Felix shook his head disgustedly. Midsummer, three o\u0027clock in the afternoon, and it was probably no more than fifty degrees out there. And the damned sky was green! Ker-plap! went another bolt of lightning, and everyone in the motorhome - which was everyone they had - jumped another foot. \"I do wish they\u0027d stop doing that!\" muttered Cat airily. Nobody laughed. \"Well, hell,\" said Jack at last. \"I guess there goes today.\" \"Yeah,\" agreed Carl, staring out at the storm. \"Funny thing is: we could\u0027ve blown the whole damn mansion up in this stuff and I don\u0027t think even the next-door neighbors would have heard it.\" He looked at Davette and smiled. \"As \u0027next-door\u0027 as this neighborhood gets, I mean,\" be added. Davette didn\u0027t smile. She just looked at the floor between her feet and continued hugging her elbows, her face drawn and tight. She doesn\u0027t like being here, thought Felix. And he wanted to go to her and do something or say something, but... But he didn\u0027t. Too many people around and... and what was he going to say, anyway? They were going to do this one way or another, no matter how she felt. She was the reason they were here, if anything. \"Dammit!\" sputtered Jack Crow. \"I would like to know if they\u0027re here, at least. Joplin! Turn that thing on.\" \"It won\u0027t work,\" replied Carl. \"Why not? Are they busted?\" \"You\u0027re trying to read the house, right?\" \"Right.\" \"It won\u0027t reach.\" \"Because of the storm? It\u0027s only a couple of hundred feet.\" Carl shook his head. \"It\u0027s not the storm. It\u0027s the location. I could read the house from here if I had a sensor in the house. But you gotta have a sensor on-site.\" \"You mean already at the house.\" Carl nodded. \"Or in it.\" \"Now there\u0027s a happy thought,\" offered Cat. Jack looked at him. \"You up to it?\" Cat shrugged. \"I wish I had a shower cap,\" he said and began stripping off his chain mail. \"What do you think you\u0027re doing?\" Carl asked him. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not going in. An outside wall would be close enough, wouldn\u0027t it?\" Felix thought this was crazy. But he only said, \"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" \"Well, I\u0027m sure,\" declared Joplin. \"It\u0027s a shitty idea.\" He looked square at Cat. \"It\u0027s also even stupider than your usual.\" \"Look, Carl,\" urged Jack. \"It\u0027s just a matter of him taking it up there and stashing it in the bushes or somewhere.\" \"Yeah,\" agreed Cat. \"Just Catting it in and Catting it out.\" And he smiled. And Carl Joplin all but erupted. \"Bullshit!\" he bellowed. \"Bullshit! It\u0027s been dark for what? Two hours already.\" \"Yeah, but - \" Cat tried. \"\u0027Yeah, but - \u0027 shit! You sit your butt back down or I\u0027ll dribble you from one end of this trailer to the other!\" And he stood over Cat, huffing and puffing, his arms out like a hungry linebacker, and it got very quiet until Cat spoke, in a small voice: \"Okay, Carl,\" he said, shrugging. Carl nodded firmly. \"Okay,\" he confirmed, still heaving. Then he noticed everyone watching him. He blinked, hesitated, then seemed to get more angry. \"We meeting at Felix\u0027s bar, that Antwar place?\" Jack nodded. Carl turned to Felix. \"You sure you got enough room?\" \"I\u0027m sure.\" \"Fine!\" barked Carl. He looked around at the others. \"Fine,\" he repeated. \"I\u0027ll meet you there. I\u0027m gonna get some more bullets for the Gunman and a suit for the kid.\" He nodded toward Deputy Thompson. He looked around at the others another moment, trying to think of something to say. Then he grabbed up the Blazer keys and stomped out into the rain. They could just hear the Blazer\u0027s engine start over the storm. \"I don\u0027t get it,\" wondered Kirk out loud. \"What was he so mad about?\" Annabelle smiled. So did Jack and Cat. \"He wasn\u0027t really mad, dear,\" Annabelle assured him. \"He was just worried about Cat.\" Kirk nodded slowly. \"So that threat...\" \"Oh, that wasn\u0027t a threat,\" Annabelle said quickly. \"That was a hug.\" Kirk looked at her. Then the dawning showed in his eyes. He smiled. \"Oh, I get it. Carl\u0027s shy.\" Cat and Jack nodded at each other. \"Well,\" muttered Cat, \"that\u0027s one way of putting it.\" Felix didn\u0027t much care how they put it. \"Let\u0027s get going,\" he said. \"Okay,\" replied Jack. He looked at Davette. \"Which way at the stop sign?\" She looked up vaguely, still clearly disturbed at where she was. \"Uh, why don\u0027t you turn right? No... Yes, right. And then...\" Felix shook his head. \"Go straight. Then take the nex... Never mind. I\u0027ll drive.\" And he climbed over into the driver\u0027s seat. Jack studied him. \"You know this area?\" Felix shrugged. \"I grew up about three blocks from here.\" And Davette\u0027s head came up quickly. \"You did?\" she whispered. He smiled at her and nodded. \"Where?\" she asked. \"DeLoche Avenue.\" Davette\u0027s head tilted toward him. She smiled. \"How nice,\" breathed Cat. \"They\u0027re both aristocrats.\" \"Cat,\" snarled Felix, starting the engine. But Cat held up both palms in the air. \"I know. I know,\" he said. And then he added. \"But it\u0027s still sweet.\" Felix snarled as he made the motorhome move through the rain. \"We need to stop here,\" announced Annabelle as they passed a shopping center a few miles later. \"There. At the pharmacy.\" Jack frowned, looked at his watch. \"What for?\" \"That,\" purred Annabelle sweetly, \"is none of your business. Felix, pull up close so we don\u0027t get wet and... Jack?\" She held her palm out to him and pointed to it with a long fingernail. Jack shrugged and dugout some money and started piling bills onto her palm. When she had about three times what they needed, Annabelle said, \"Stop. We\u0027ll be right back.\" Then she and Davette were out the door and tripping through the rain to the brightly lit automatic doors. The men just sat there, not talking, just waiting for the women to spend the money. Jack watched the deputy find himself a comfortable spot on the motorhome\u0027s sofa. Even in civilian clothes, the kid still looked like he was wearing a uniform. I ought to talk to him about paying him, Jack thought. But he doesn\u0027t seem worried about it. Just slipped right into us. We were lucky. Felix sat drumming his fingers on the steering wheel, looking anxious but unworried. Even you\u0027re coming along, Gunman, thought Jack next. That is, as far as you\u0027re willing to come. \"Think they\u0027ll remember cigarettes?\" Cat asked suddenly. Kirk waved at the smoky air. \"Hope not.\" They remembered. Felix cranked up the motorhome and they steamed through the rainy city to his bar. He was worried about the Antwar. He\u0027d only had one chance to talk to them since he\u0027d been with the Team, and he knew what happened to the staff of a cocktail lounge without someone standing over them. He had some pretty good people, but still... Damn it was raining! And the thunder and the lightning - it took him thirty minutes to cross town, using his headlights the entire time. It really does look like nighttime out there, he thought as be finally pulled onto his Street. Cat was sitting behind him playing with Carl\u0027s detector. \"Hey, Felix! Maybe I\u0027ll quit, too, and write a book.\" \"Smart move,\" said Felix. \"It\u0027ll be all about a gay vampire.\" Felix frowned, Jack and Annabelle looked at one another and groaned. \"You want to hear the title?\" \"Sure. What\u0027s the title?\" \" \u0027The Tooth Fairy,\u0027 \"replied Cat happily, just as Felix pulled the motorhome up to the Antwar\u0027s front door and... And the detector in Cat\u0027s hands went wild. Beep-Beep-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-... and Felix yanked the wheel away from the curb tromped on the gas and the huge motorhome skidded, righted itself, then vaulted down the street, fishtailing at the first turn. But Felix didn\u0027t let off. He knew what that meant! He knew! And he made that bloody jump! \"Felix!\" Jack yelled to him a few blocks later. \"They aren\u0027t coming!\" Felix\u0027s foot hesitated over the throttle. \"You sure?\" \"Sure! Slow this thing down.\" Felix reluctantly obeyed, slowing it all the way down, finally pulling over to a stop at the curb and turning off key. Then he just sat there, in the silence and the rain, breathing hard, before he spoke. \"They found me,\" he said quietly. Then: \"They know me, too. And they\u0027ve found me.\" It\u0027s worse than that, Gunman, thought Jack Crow. Know you. They\u0027ve found you. And they\u0027re after you. But he didn\u0027t say this. He didn\u0027t say anything. He like he knew what Felix was feeling. And he couldn\u0027t but have sympathy. But you\u0027re in it now, Felix, he thought. In to stay. Jack Crow did not know how Felix felt. Felix did not know how he felt. He felt... nothing, really. Empty and numb and... I knew this would happen, he thought again and and again. I knew it. \"Carl!\" whispered Cat suddenly. \"Huh?\" asked the Deputy. \"If they thought enough to have somebody waiting Felix\u0027s bar - on the off chance he\u0027d be there...\" \"Then they\u0027re bound to have somebody at the house,\" Jack finished for him. And he was already Felix out of the driver\u0027s seat. \"Get dressed,\" he told them and started the engine once more. \"We\u0027ll drop the ladies off.\" \"Carl!\" whispered Cat again, almost to himself. He turned and looked at Annabelle\u0027s pale face. She looks like I feel, he thought. Carl! He\u0027s all alone out there...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-23.html","bookId":2118,"book":{"id":2118,"title":"Vampire$","description":"Storyline: Vampire$ is about a tightly knit group of professional vampire killers. They may say they\u0027re in it for the money, but their death-defying bravado and warm male friendships are as intense as those in any soldier-hero epic. The irrepressible, foul-mouthed, hard-drinkin\u0027 Jack Crow--decked out in high-tech chain mail and wielding a fearsome crossbow--is the leader of the bunch. He\u0027s the sort of man who screams obscenities at the pope, and then weeps in the pontiff\u0027s lap over the horrors he\u0027s witnessed. Vampire$ is one gaudy, action-packed novel. The men are men, the women are vulnerable, and the vampires are mean, ugly monsters. Unless you don\u0027t like that sort of thing, you\u0027ll love it. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/vampire.jpg","author":"John Steakley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/vampire.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:17 PM"}}
