He called Joplin on the radio to find the trouble and then stood there with the others, waiting for a reply, as the second fiend lumbered slowly toward them. It had almost reached the left lantern when Joplin called back that he knew where the trouble was, that the cable had snagged in the doorjamb, that he would have to open the door to fix it. Jack sighed and cursed, then ordered the others back to the doorway. He had to call Felix\u0027s name twice. The man seemed to be mesmerized by the sight of the ragged tissue on the goon\u0027s neck. So they all faded back to the door and stood there, intermittently blinded by periodic bursts of harsh Texas sunlight, as Joplin fiddled with the door. The repair took five minutes. It made sense to keep the detector on, standing there blind as they were. But it was unlikely anything would attack them in that glare of sunlight either. And by the time the detector had gone from BEEP-BEEP-BEEP to beep... beep... beep, showing the second monster had retreated, Jack couldn\u0027t stand that sound anymore. He reached over to the machine in Cat\u0027s hands and snapped it off with an angry flourish. \"All set,\" announced Joplin, sticking his head inside. \"Good news,\" replied Cat wryly. \"Now maybe you can fix this.\" And he held up the detector to show where Jack had broken the switch off. So they had to stand there blind some more while Joplin, wearing a miner\u0027s light on his head, replaced the toggle switch with a paper clip and wire. That took another five minutes. Jack was not in a good mood by the time they had resumed their stations behind the two lanterns. The delays had lost them their stride. His team looked jumpy-except for Felix, who looked paralyzed - and he wasn\u0027t feeling so hot either. And he couldn\u0027t stand that goddamned beeping. But the detector was doing its job. The beeps got closer and closer just as before, and when they reached the previous interval, the goon reappeared, this time from the right side. Cat\u0027s side. \"Okay, people,\" ordered Jack, lifting the crossbow, \"get set.\" It was about then that the right-side lantern began to flicker. \"Shit!\" hissed Jack and he lowered the crossbow and stared with the rest of the team as the light blinked on and off. The only movement was from the goon. It was now only twenty feet away. And coming steadily. Jack didn\u0027t know what to do. He didn\u0027t want to fight in the dark. But he didn\u0027t want to have to start everything up again. And besides, dammit, this was just a little short one! \"Cat!\" he barked angrily. \"Fix that light!\" Cat, whose mechanical ineptitude was legendary, just stared back and said, \"How?\" \"I don\u0027t know, dammit! Fiddle with it.\" Cat hesitated. The goon was now only fifteen feet away. \"And hurry!\" snarled Jack. Cat nodded. \"Right!\" And he rushed forward and bent down over the flickering lantern. \"Well?\" demanded Crow a few seconds later. The goon was now only a dozen feet - six shuffling steps - away. And whenever the lamp would flicker, it would seem to disappear completely. It was unnerving. \"Well?\" repeated Jack, louder than before. \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" replied Cat excitedly. \"What?\" cried Jack, concerned. \"I think I can fix it!\" \"Huh?\" replied Jack dully, still staring at the shuffling monster coming closer. \"I really think I can. It\u0027s just the bulb, I think.\" The goon was now less than ten feet away. Only it didn\u0027t really seem to be moving toward Cat. More toward Jack, who stood in the center of the formation. But no. Too tight. Too close. \"Cat!, Bring the light over here and fix it.\" \"No. Just a sec. I\u0027ve got it.\" \"Cat! Get over here!\" \"Would you shut up a minute? I know I can... Yeah. Here. I\u0027ve got it!\" And the lantern went completely dark. \"Cat!\" No answer. \"Cat! What are you doing?\" yelled Adam, who had managed to be quiet until now. But still, no answer. \"Adam! Hit your chest lamp. That\u0027ll.. \"That\u0027ll drive \u0027em away, bwana!\" snapped Cat, sounding. irritated. \"Cat!\" yelled Crow, relieved. \"Come on...\" \"Quiet, dammit! I\u0027ve got it fixed. Here!\" And the light came on and the monster\u0027s gnarled hand closed on Cat\u0027s throat and the gray teeth came flashing down and Cat yelled, \"Jesus!\" and tried to pull away but the monster had him and Jack jerked the crossbow into aim and fired from the hip and the great arrow cracked into its chest and it shrieked and vibrated and jolted into the air but it still held Cat, who flopped and jounced about in its grip like a rag doll and Jack called out for Adam and Felix to come and help because he knew Cat would never survive that pounding. Adam was already on his way, rushing forward with his pike in his hand, calling out, \"Cat! Cat!\" But he never made it. He was only a few strides away when the monster leapt and howled once more and the long cable warped through the air like a jump rope and cracked Adam full force on his left temple, spinning him upside down through the air and smashing him hard onto the dusty cement. Jack saw Adam move out of the corner of his eye and knew he was all right, just stunned, but that didn\u0027t matter now. Adam couldn\u0027t help them. \"Felix!\" cried Jack. \"Felix!\" But Felix just stood there unmoving, staring at the sight, not even acknowledging Jack\u0027s voice. When Jack reached them, Cat was barely conscious. He doubted the vampire was even aware of its prey as it lurched and cried in the agony of impalement. But it still held Cat, tossing him this way and that in its pain. Jack had no idea how to get Cat loose. He took a deep breath and threw himself forward, tackling them both to the floor. It made it worse. The vampire might have forgotten it held Cat, but it sure as hell noticed Jack. It hissed and spat and struck fangs at him like a snake. Only Cat\u0027s grip on its jagged throat kept the gray teeth from Jack\u0027s face. And when one of the gnarled hands loosed itself from Cat to grab at him, Jack had about half a second of triumph before he felt that awesome vise-grip on his arm. And he punched and kicked at the monster to free himself but he was as helpless as Cat, who, crazily, still held on to the light. \"Felix!\" hollered Jack desperately. \"FELIX!\" as the three of them bounced and crashed and hissed and punched, with the lantern throwing shadows through the dust. There was a sharp tug as the winch came on and began to drag them toward the doorway. At first Jack was delighted - the sunlight would kill it - and then he remembered how it would die and how hot those flames would be. \"No!\" he cried into his headset. \"Carl! Turn it off! You\u0027ll burn us alive!\" The cable went immediately slack. \"Felix!\" cried Jack desperately. \"FELIX!\" The monster began twisting and spitting at them again. \"Cat!\" yelled Crow. \"Drop that damn light!\" \"Huh?\" muttered Cat. Then \"Oh... yeah!\" And he finally released the lantern so he could use both hands and the light bounced and clanked loudly on the cement and began to roll away from them, over and over, spilling light into the dust, before it was kicked back toward them by the shoe of a six-foot-four-inch black man who had been killed while working the graveyard shift at the Texaco station. The man still wore his uniform. It still bore his name, \"Roy,\" on the little patch above his left breast pocket. But he didn\u0027t care. He didn\u0027t care what he wore. He didn\u0027t care that he was \"Roy.\" He cared only for the smell of living, pumping blood. The half dozen others looming behind him out of the darkness felt the same way. The first man to see the horde appear was Adam, sprawled stunned and bleeding on the edge of the light from the other lantern. Still unable to do much more than stumble, he could only moan, \"Sweet blessed Jesus! Jack! Look out!\" Jack saw them. He saw - what was it? - six, seven, eight of them? Coming for them, shuffling at them and he couldn\u0027t get loose from this little squirt he had already shot, much less save Cat, much less do anything about the others. \"FELIX!!\" he screamed and then, in his panic, went into a frenzy of his own. He grabbed one end of the huge arrow already piercing the monster and began to work it fiercely back and forth in the wound. The monster howled and spat and writhed some more and its gnarled hands began clutching and opening spasmodically and during one of the openings Cat came loose for just a second and Jack kicked his friend brutally to safety with a chain-mailed boot to the chest. But it still had him, the little spitting fiend still had him and he could see the others shuffling closer, could hear the sound of their dry dead feet in the dust, could almost feel their gnarled hands and gray fangs... \"FELIXGODDAMMIT!\" he wailed and grabbed the little monster and rolled over and over and flung it, with every ounce of fear he had, away from him. There was the sound of chain mail popping, fabric and flesh ripping, and Jack Crow was free. When he lurched triumphantly to his feet, Roy was there, face to rotting face. Roy hissed. His great black hands closed on Jack\u0027s throat. Jack was helpless and knew it and he hit the switch for his chest cross and the halogen light was blinding to both of them and painful to the vampire. It arched and shrieked from the agony of the cross of light, steam already rising from the surface of its dead skin. It saved Jack\u0027s life when it threw the light, and Jack, away from its body. Jack smacked the concrete floor chest first and the halogen bulbs exploded into dusty darkness beneath him and suddenly all was as it had been only he had no light and no hope and Felix would not move and that\u0027s when Deputy Kirk Thompson, terrified by the sounds he had heard on Joplin\u0027s radio, burst into the cavernous darkness with his .44 magnum in hand. He took one incredulous look then, pure hero type, braced his feet wide, supported his right, shooting, hand with his left, and began to fire. He was a sharpshooter. His first two hollowpoints struck Roy full in the chest. The next one struck the little impaled one, the thrashing one, in the left side of the head. The third shot blew a hole in the shoulder of an old woman, already lame, who had managed to drag herself within one more step of Adam without the young priest having yet seen her. It was excellent shooting. The shots were dead-on accurate, spaced no more than a half second apart, and worthless against the undead. They did have some effect. The vampires roared and jerked, the old woman after Adam was flung back briefly out of range, all eyes were turned to the deputy... All eyes... Felix\u0027s eyes. My God, thought Jack, staring at his gunman, he made a move! And then Team Crow saw him start to draw.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-13.html","bookId":2118,"book":{"id":2118,"title":"Vampire$","description":"Storyline: Vampire$ is about a tightly knit group of professional vampire killers. They may say they\u0027re in it for the money, but their death-defying bravado and warm male friendships are as intense as those in any soldier-hero epic. The irrepressible, foul-mouthed, hard-drinkin\u0027 Jack Crow--decked out in high-tech chain mail and wielding a fearsome crossbow--is the leader of the bunch. He\u0027s the sort of man who screams obscenities at the pope, and then weeps in the pontiff\u0027s lap over the horrors he\u0027s witnessed. Vampire$ is one gaudy, action-packed novel. The men are men, the women are vulnerable, and the vampires are mean, ugly monsters. Unless you don\u0027t like that sort of thing, you\u0027ll love it. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/vampire.jpg","author":"John Steakley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/vampire.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:17 PM"}}
