{"id":92930,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Jack Crow awoke with a start from some nameless horrible on the flight from Rome and beheld the angelic face of his newest team member, Father Adam, sleeping across from him. He\u0027s a sweet kid, thought Jack. I\u0027ll probably get him killed, too. Then he went back to sleep because any other thoughts were better than these. \"I need a vampire,\" said Carl Joplin for the hundredth time. Cat burped and ignored him. Annabelle placed a soft white hand on Carl\u0027s great fat shoulder and said, \"I know, dear.\" The rest of Team Crow had been at the bar at the Monterey Airport for four hours. One hour to get primed for the homecoming and the three more the plane turned out to be late. It was not a pretty sight. Except, thought Cat, for Annabelle. She was always a pretty sight. Even when she wasn\u0027t. He propped his elbow very carefully against the edge of the bar, made a fist with his hand, put his cheek on it, and examined her. He had known her his whole life and... Waitaminute. That wasn\u0027t true. He had known her six years. No. Seven years. Almost seven years, since before her late husband, Basil O\u0027Bannon, had founded Vampire$ Inc. And anyway, she was still the same. Still pretty and still plump and still mostly blond and still forty-something or sixty-something years old - it didn\u0027t seem to apply - and still able to outdrink God. Time to take a piss, he decided. He lifted himself off the barstool, careful not to get the toe of his boot caught on the railing like last time, and ambled off on his mission. Carl Joplin looked up from rubbing his wondrous belly and said, \"I need a vampire.\" \"I know, dear,\" said Annabelle. \"It\u0027s gotta be tested!\" he insisted. \"I know, dear. We\u0027ll ask Jack when the plane gets in.\" Carl snarled and sipped his drink. \"Jack! Shit!\" He was still mad at Jack and likely to stay that way. \"Jack!\" he repeated disgustedly. Carl Joplin was the weapons man and the tool man for the team. He made the crossbows for Jack and Cat\u0027s wooden knives and everything else they took with them into battle, but did he ever get to go into battle? Hell, no! \"Too valuable,\" Jack would always say. Somebody had to be free and clear of the fight at all times to make sure the fight could go on. Carl could buy that. It made sense. But how come it had to be him every goddamn time? But it was. Sure, he was a little overweight and maybe pushing sixty but that was no reason not to let him duke it out just once. Just one time, baby! The detector was his best chance. Joplin had actually come up with a vampire detector based on the presumed electromagnetic energy of any object and/or critter able to totally absorb all sunlight. It was an ingenious gadget but it required a vampire to test it. Carl knew damn well they could never hope - or, for that matter, be so stupid as to try - to capture a fiend and bring it to him. Ergo, he would have to be there on sight to run the buttons and knobs the rest of the peckerwoods were too damned ignorant to follow in the first place. He\u0027d get into it one way or the other, by God! And in the meantime he went back to rubbing his great belly and snarling and refusing to see Annabelle\u0027s smile when he did it. Which reminded him: how come he was sloppy drunk and she wasn\u0027t? How come she never was? Huh? Explain me that! Cat, weaving his way back through the tables from the rest room, was wondering the very same thing. He had never in all of his whole entire life seen Annabelle drunk. And she drank as much as anybody, didn\u0027t she? Well, didn\u0027t she? Did she? He thought back. Yup. She did. In fact, she was the one who had really gotten the serious stuff going with that schnapps shit. Waitaminute! Schnapps! She always drank schnapps! Maybe if I drank schna... Waitaminuteagain! I am drinking schnapps. I\u0027ve been drinking it. That\u0027s how I got so polluted. He plopped back down on his stool thinking: Mystery of the Universe! \"I need a vampire,\" said Carl once again at Cat\u0027s reappearance. \"In a minute,\" Cat finally retorted. And they hissed at each other. Annabelle smiled again. But not too much or she was certain she\u0027d lose her balance, keel backward off the stool, skirts flying, and crack her head on the side of the bar like a ripe grapefruit. And then, she giggled silently to herself, little purple butterflies would sparkle out. She had never been so thoroughly plastered in her life. She doubted if anyone had. And the thought of actually being able to sit down and pee was her notion of heaven. But do women pee? Sure they do. No. They dew. Horses sweat, men perspire, and women dew. Right? No, that was something else. But urinate sounded so dreadful. So unladylike. And if she didn\u0027t risk weaving to the rest room in front of the men she was about to do something a lot more unladylike. Being a lady - setting the standard - was paramount. She bore the entire responsibility, she was quite certain, for Team Crow. In a very real sense, more than she would ever fully comprehend, this was quite true. Annabelle O\u0027Bannon was more than a simple regal beauty who kept her raucous men in line. She was their symbol for the rest of the world they were surely going to die trying to protect. She was why they kept going out to fight knowing damn well they would eventually lose. It had happened to everyone else. It would happen to them. But this way it wouldn\u0027t happen to Annabelle. They didn\u0027t know this, her men. That is, they had never consciously voiced it, even inside their own heads. But it was so. It was so because she, Annabelle, was so. Just so. She had that way with men only certain ladies and other magical creatures possessed. A way of making them sit down and eat their porridge or drink their drink. Of making them shut up and listen to someone else talk. She could make them wear ties. She also possessed the unique ability to actually stop violence, like the time she made Jack put that Harley down - and not on that poor moaning biker like he wanted. None of this was getting her off the barstool and into the ladies\u0027 room. And she simply had to go. Then a thought occurred. \"Young man,\" she called to the middle-aged bartender, \"I\u0027ll have another.\" Then she slid off the stool and landed, thank God, on both high-heeled feet and had weaved her way several steps toward sweet release before Carl and Cat could get over the shock. The two men looked at one another. Another drink? Another-goddamned-drink? She was going to have another round and here they were, the two of them big tough guy Fighters of Evil trying desperately to focus on their cocktail napkins for balance, for chrissakes, and she\u0027s having another... But what could they do? What choice did they have? It was awful and grisly to do it but the alternative was worse, giving in was worse. Carl gulped, said, \"Me too.\" The bartender, bright, sober, and sadistic, asked Cat, \"Another all the way around?\" And Cat, his face gray and his life passing before his eyes, nodded dully. Annabelle\u0027s timing was, as always, exquisite. She had made it almost out of sight while the men were occupied with machismo. She paused at the entrance to the bar and, with apparent unconcern, spoke back over her shoulder, \"Young man,\" she called sweetly to the bartender, \"I guess not after all.\" All three men turned toward her, the bartender with hands full of fixings. \"You don\u0027t want another, lady?\" Annabelle smiled. \"I guess not.\" The bartender\u0027s annoyance barely showed. \"You\u0027re sure?\" he pursued. She paused, seemed to take the question of chemical suicide seriously, then shook her pretty head again. \"I guess not,\" she repeated and then she was gone. Her men all but leapt at the opening she had provided. \"I guess not, too.\" \"Me either, now that I think about it.\" Both burst out in the rapid staccato of machine-gun fire. The bartender stared at them, glanced at the rest of the lounge, which was completely empty, and sighed. Too good to be true, he thought. He\u0027d known that just three people making his overhead for the day was too good to be true. But still, they\u0027d almost made it. Annabelle neither heard nor cared about any of this. She was too busy stamping her awkward path to the ladies room door, bashing it open with both hands and part of her hairdo, jerking herself awkwardly into a stall, unsheathing herself, and then reveling in one of those mini-orgasms reserved for those lucky creatures made in God\u0027s image. Later she thought: I\u0027m so tired. It had been a busy two weeks for her. With Jack in Rome it was left to Cat and Carl and herself (meaning her) to handle all the arrangements. Contacting the next of kin had been easier than it might have been. Crusader types, she had long ago discovered, had a tendency to be loners. Except for Anthony. She had gone to San Antonio to tell Mrs. Beverley in person. When that sainted woman had opened the door and seen her she had known. The two of them had held each other and rocked and cried and rocked and cried for two straight hours, their minds filled with the rich memories of the sweet, handsome, brave huge black Anthony they had loved so, much. No loss, except of her husband Basil, had ever touched her so much. And she had known right then that when Jack\u0027s and Cat\u0027s time came - as it certainly would - that would be all for her. She knew it was up to her to keep going. She knew that Carl Joplin, as amazingly competent as he truly was, would need her desperately. Would fail, probably, without her help. She knew this and she didn\u0027t care. When Jack and Cat went, that would be it. Even the hinted image of that loss, so wickedly brutal, so thoroughly devastating, was intertwined with one of herself sitting quietly in her room lining up the pills to swallow. Interesting enough, it bad never occurred to her that she might die another way. Vampires? She had never seen one, never wished to, and could think of no reason in the world why she ever should. That was the men\u0027s job. They were hers. Later, of course, when the horror was roaring in on them, it would be different. But she couldn\u0027t have known that now. Her thoughts turned to the move. They were leaving Pebble Beach and moving back home to Texas. To Dallas. They were going to miss their mansion with its view of the bay and the sculptured golf courses and the ocean fog rolling across the tops of the pine trees and, most of all, the miniature deer eating her flowers every morning. She had claimed, loudly and often, that she hated the creatures and believed them to be a scourge of nature. The world, she insisted, would be better off if every single deer was burned at the stake. \"Bambi, too?\" someone would invariably ask. \"Especially Bambi,\" she would sharply retort. \"That vile little mutt has only encouraged them.\" This fooled absolutely no one, of course. But still every morning she would put, on her sneakers and her one pair of blue jeans and her late husband\u0027s lumberjack shirt, tie her hair back in a scarf, grab her weapon (the back porch broom), and rush out to do battle. Everyone would race to the windows, even braving some truly monumental hangovers, to laugh and applaud and tap on the glass and just generally egg on the deer. Especially that one awful creature who was certain was the leader. So smug and cocky and sure self, it would actually stop eating and stand there, just stand there and stare at her as she ran at it waving the broom, showing not one ounce of fear until just before she could whack it, and then vault effortlessly over the ten-foot fence she had had especially constructed. The boys loved him and named him Bambi after that silly movie and - And. And the boys... The boys were all gone. The boys, her boys were all dead, all destroyed horribly and forever and... And for a long time the only sound in the room came from the muffled sobs filling the tiny stall. It was why they were moving. The Zoo, the nickname for the wing now holding seven unoccupied bedrooms, was empty. Empty and hollow and dark and sad. It had been the only post massacre order Jack had been able to manage. Near-incoherent with pain and rage and shame, his last comment before boarding the plane to Europe was to take everything home to Texas where they belonged. Annabelle had thus been left with the project of packing everything up, flying to Dallas, selecting and buying another house (with room for Carl\u0027s workshop), and most difficult of all, sorting out the boys\u0027 belongings. So many belongings. And such, such... boyish things. She smiled at that thought and wiped away another tear. Because they were such boys. They were grown men, too. All of them. The youngest almost twenty-five, the oldest just over forty, older even than Cat, the second in command. But they were such boys, too. Oh, she knew why. She did. She understood why. It was their job, the nature of it, the fear of it, the... The certainty of it. They weren\u0027t going to get married and raise children and grow old and pass away retired in some resort community. They were going to die. They were going to be killed by some desperate lunge of talon or teeth, too fast for anyone to do anything to stop it. And then they were going to have to be staked and beheaded by the survivors who couldn\u0027t even use the funeral as a time to mourn because of it. They were going to die. And soon. And they knew it. Every single one of them knew it. They were going to die. And so they were kids. Her boys. She packed up so many toys. Video games and stereo sets and model airplanes and pinball games (everybody had to have his own machine) and hookah pipes and science fiction books and comic books, some of which were, inexplicably to Annabelle, in Japanese. (She could never understand that. None of the boys spoke Japanese, much less read it.) And then there were the stacks of porno books and magazines and she found it was apparently legal to actually entitle a magazine Fuck Me. So much stuff and plenty of money for it - the Man saw to that knowing they would never live to accumulate their own fortunes. And they spent it. But what was appalling and, she admitted it, endearing to Annabelle was what they did with it all. All that healthy maleness and alcohol and fear pent up in even so large a place as the mansion made for an extremely vibrant household to say the least. The alcohol. So much alcohol. Team Crow got dead drunk the way normal people had a single cocktail. The monthly bill for liquor consumed on the premises was over a thousand dollars. And that didn\u0027t even count the bar tabs Annabelle was forever driving around to pay off. The huge garage area was filled with Corvettes and four-wheel drives and motorcycles everyone was too drunk to drive home. After eight DWIs in two weeks, Jack had installed a taxi-home policy for everyone not going out with Cat (who drunk, could talk any cop out of his gun). But it wasn\u0027t just the booze. They were none of them alcoholics. It was just all that overgrown energy. They terrorized the maid service, inevitably springing themselves on the poor women stark naked and dripping from the shower and offering to help. It was so hard to keep cooks they were finally forbidden to even enter the kitchen while the cook was on the property. If they wanted something they had to phone in and ask for it. The amount of food pleased and frightened the cooks at the same time. They were able to consume astonishing amounts of food. Any kind of food. Junk food. Gourmet buffets. Munchies. Anything. Everything. They never got fat. None of them - except for Carl, of course - even got beer bellies. Every morning they would get up and work out rigorously, the sweat running salty past their grins. It was not that they were especially disciplined. They most certainly were not. They were... committed. They were faithful. And they were alone together. It wasn\u0027t just each one of them who worried about himself. If one couldn\u0027t spin his body around quick enough with that brutish wooden stake in his grip, then it might not be just him slashed from throat to thighs. It might be one of his mates. No. It would be one of his mates. Because there was, quite literally, no one else in the world to save them but them. It was why, recalled Annabelle, Jack had forbidden wrestling matches. Which were always happening in the stairwells, for some reason. She supposed it was because those broad shoulders were always clipping past one another in a hurry and then one thing led to another and... Jack wouldn\u0027t have it. They were already wrapped far too tightly to be adrenaline-bruising their only kin. So instead they tore up the house. That time they decided to play indoor golf because of the rain. She busied herself in front of the lounge mirror, thinking back and trying without success to keep the smile from her face. To be fair, Jack had not even been in town. He and Cat had gone up to San Francisco with Anthony to watch his old team beat the 49\u0027ers. But that didn\u0027t mean she believed for one single instant Jack would have stopped them. Probably would have just sat there in that big chair of his and laughed and bet on the winner. Indoor golf. She sighed. They had broken six windows. Three of them cut glass. She paused and inspected her appearance before returning to the bar. She supposed she looked fine. For what she was. For what was left. For what there was to look forward to. I\u0027m so tired, she thought again. And then she thought: No. That\u0027s a lie: I\u0027m frightened. And then she thought: No. I\u0027m both. Both. Jack! Hurry back. Hurry back to us and still be you! Father Adam looked to his left, at the seventy-ish man sleeping across the aisle from him and said in his silent TV commentator\u0027s voice, There are, for your information, sir, over six hundred exorcisms officially performed in America each year. And to you, it\u0027s just something that made a great movie that may or may not have been true once but isn\u0027t now. Adam\u0027s gaze slid across the aisle to Jack, dozing in front of him. And this man, he continued, kills vampires for a living. How about that? Adam sighed, resting his eyes on Crow a bit longer before turning and viewing the mountains of the western United States sweeping below. I\u0027m in a dream. But maybe not. This is real and this has been happening, bile flowing from the Beast, since the dawn of man and before. This isn\u0027t a dream. He turned again to look at Jack Crow. It\u0027s simply that this man is a movie. A walking, talking, bleeding, cussing, bigger-than-life bear of a man. He\u0027s a movie, just being alive. But movies aren\u0027t real, are they? he asked himself. Neither is the priesthood. Isn\u0027t that why you\u0027re here? He started to ignore himself. But then he decided he no longer had to. He was here now and into it. He was no longer some lanky, dark-curled kid too pretty for his own good hiding out from girls in seminary and from the meat-eaters\u0027 man\u0027s world in his black-and-white king\u0027s X uniform. He looked again around the cabin. It wasn\u0027t the real world of this plane, perhaps. Of men striving to earn first-class seats or pilot\u0027s stripes. It wasn\u0027t the real world of men at all. But it was the real world of man. Of man and God. And he, Adam the schoolyard trembler, had grown up and come here to fight for them both. At last. To the last. He slept. I don\u0027t know who else to get, thought Jack Crow. And I\u0027m tired of getting them. We need the best kind of person around. No one less will do. But they will die. And that means I have to find the best men I know and condemn them to a certain violent end just because they\u0027re the best. Shit. And they always said yes. That was the worst part of it. The good ones, once they knew it was being done, had to be doing it. So they did it and they died. Doubleshit. Oh, God! Please don\u0027t call us now! There\u0027s only four of us left and this kid-priest and one of \u0027em\u0027s a middle-aged woman and another is pushing sixty and fat and damn well not scared enough for me and another is the finest man I\u0027ve ever known. And, tripleshit, the last one is me. Please, phone, don\u0027t ring! The plane landed and Jack Crow shook himself hard and reminded himself that he was supposed to be a leader of some kind so: Rock and roll, goddammit! Off your butt and off this plane and here we go again! Come on! Don\u0027t think about the phone. They knew the priest was coming but they didn\u0027t know anything about him. Jack strode through the gate to Annabelle with Adam close behind. He leaned down and kissed her and said, \"Folks, this is Adam.\" \"Father Adam,\" Adam amended firmly. Team Crow exchanged rolled eyes. \"I\u0027m her Royal Highness Annabelle.\" \"Lord High-Muck-a-muck Carl Joplin.\" Adam blinked, stared at them. Cat, grinning, stepped forward and shook his hand. \"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain,\" said Cat. \"I am the Great and Powerful Oz.\" And then they were all walking rapidly toward baggage claim without further explanation. Adam found himself offered Annabelle\u0027s arm. He took it and shut up and walked. \"I need a vampire,\" began Carl. Jack barely glanced at him. \"Is it working?\" \"It was working last night.\" Jack stopped. They all stopped and stared at Carl. \"Well, to tell the truth, I don\u0027t know what made it beep then.\" They resumed walking. \"But it should work,\" Carl persisted. \"And it\u0027s gotta be tested.\" \"How does it work?\" Jack wanted to know. \"You wouldn\u0027t understand it, Jack, and you know it.\" \"Hmm. Possibly. Then how are we supposed to test it?\" \"We ain\u0027t. I am.\" Jack sighed, shook his head. \"Oh, great. Here we go again with your - \" \"Goddammit, Jack! There ain\u0027t anybody else!\" \"How do you figure that?\" They had reached the baggage claim area. They stopped. Carl took a deep breath and hitched up his pants. He began counting off fingers. \"Well, Annabelle can\u0027t do it \u0027cause she watches the soaps during the day. You\u0027re supposed to be guarding my ass while I\u0027m doing it. Cat...\" \"I could do it,\" Cat offered with a sly grin. Carl gave him a dirty look. \"What do you know about the electromagnetic spectrum?\" \"I\u0027m for it.\" \"What do you know about EEGs? Brain waves?\" Cat frowned. \"Is this a surfing question?\" Carl snarled. \"As I was saying: Annabelle is out, you and Cat have your own little trick to do. That leaves me.\" He paused, stepped up to Jack. His face was dead serious. \"Look, Jack. You\u0027ll be able to operate it after I get it right. But I must be there to twitch it until it\u0027s on.\" Jack stared at him but did not speak. Carl grimaced. \"I\u0027m telling you straight.\" But Jack had never doubted that. All he could think of was: Here I go again. I\u0027m going to have to risk you, too. Dammit, am I going to lose everyone? He stepped closer to Annabelle and hugged her without realizing why. \"I\u0027ll think about it\" was all he said, but it was already done and everyone but Adam knew it. There was an awkward pause while they stood about. No bags appeared from the chute, though they heard the usual destructive noises from somewhere beneath them. Cat\u0027s voice sparkled into the silence. He slapped Adam on the shoulder. \"Don\u0027t know about you guys, but it\u0027s great to have a father, huh, folks?\" Adam smiled uncertainly in reply. Annabelle grinned widely. \"Now,\" continued Cat. \"If we only had a mother...\" Annabelle looked offended. \"What\u0027s wrong with me? Besides being far too young?\" \"Well,\" he replied, rubbing his jaw and eyeing her immaculately tasteful dove-gray pants suit, \"now that we\u0027ve got a priest and all for a father... For a mother we need someone a little less... slutty.\" Adam stared wide-eyed. But Annabelle only nodded soberly. \"I suppose you\u0027re right,\" she replied thoughtfully. Only then did Adam notice the grins around him. But Cat was still talking. \"... nominate Davette for the job,\" he said with a gentle leer. \"Who\u0027s that?\" Jack asked. Carl growled, \"Investigative journalism come to save the world from the scam of Vampires$ Inc. What else?\" \"Or...\" retorted Cat with a finger in the air. \"Come to tell the world of our plight so we can get a little decent cooperation for a change. And I think that\u0027s it. She likes us, Carl.\" \"They all like us. So what.\" \"You mean a reporter?\" Adam asked. \"That\u0027s what they mean,\" Annabelle told them. \"You didn\u0027t talk to them, did you?\" cried the priest. \"All day yesterday,\" Annabelle replied sweetly. \"And some of last night. Interviewed everybody but Jack.\" She paused. \"And now you, dear.\" Adam looked flabbergasted. Frozen. Again Team Crow exchanged rolled eyes. Adam finally spoke. \"You didn\u0027t tell them anything... ? Did you?\" Cat smiled. \"Not much really. Just what we do for a living, how we do it, who we\u0027ve done it for, their names and how to get in touch with them to confirm it... that sort of thing.\" Adam looked even worse than before. He looked like he was about to explode. Finally, he did: \"How could you be so indiscreet? How could you... To actually tell her! What got into you? What possessed you to do such a thing?\" Cat regarded him calmly. \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you, padre. It\u0027s what I always do with the press. Of course, she\u0027s gonna be back at the house this afternoon to talk to Jack. And then you can tell her I was only fooling.\" The luggage carousel grumbled, began to turn, spouted out a single suitcase. It was Adam\u0027s. He stared at it for a moment, then grabbed it up with a single jerk and began stalking away. \"Where are you going?\" Carl wanted to know. \"To take off his collar,\" replied Jack dryly. Adam stopped, looked at Jack with surprise, then anger. \"That\u0027s right!\" he snapped and continued on to the men\u0027s room. Cat lit a cigarette. \"It\u0027s just a guess, of course. But offhand, I\u0027d say the Church policy on publicity hasn\u0027t changed much.\" Everybody laughed. Jack lit his own cigarette and spoke: \"Oh, he\u0027s not so bad. Poor kid\u0027s had that stuff drilled into him by the Man. Afraid we\u0027ll start some sort of panic and that\u0027ll start a witch hunt and on and on...\" \"And on and on and on,\" Carl finished for him. \"Stupid fools. This deal could use a little panic. The vampires are there, goddammit!\" Jack looked at him. \"Are you trying to convince me?\" Carl grinned about halfway. \"Well... yeah. But that kid\u0027s a stupid punk if he thinks we\u0027re gonna do anything Rome says.\" The rest of the bags began to appear. Cat stepped forward to get Jack\u0027s. \"Maybe so,\" said Cat. \"But unless that bag of his was empty, he\u0027s strong as an ox. See the way he grabbed it up?\" Jack smiled. \"Oh, he\u0027s fit all right. I suspect he\u0027s actually been working out. Training to join the Vampire Quest.\" Annabelle beamed. \"I like him.\" Jack smiled at her. \"I do, too.\" Carl frowned. \"He still made an ass of himself.\" Cat smiled brightly. \"So who\u0027d notice that around here?\" Carl snarled at him. \"So what about this reporter?\" Jack asked. \"Any good?\" \"Well, she\u0027s gorgeous,\" offered Cat. \"She\u0027s young,\" added Annabelle. \"Couldn\u0027t be over twenty-two.\" \"Who does she work for?\" asked Jack. \"Nobody,\" said Carl. \"Oh, Carl,\" sighed Annabelle. \"She\u0027s freelance. She thinks she can sell us to Texas Monthly.\" \"What\u0027s she doing in California?\" Cat shrugged. \"She came to see us. Heard about us back home. She knows Jim Atkinson on the magazine.\" \"Does she know he couldn\u0027t get his story about us printed?\" Cat smiled. \"I told her. I don\u0027t think she believed me.\" Jack sighed. \"Oh, great.\" \"Did I mention she\u0027s beautiful?\" asked Cat. Jack looked at him seriously. \"Gorgeous, I believe you said.\" \"Oh, she\u0027s that, too. And weird-looking.\" Annabelle frowned. \"Cherry Cat, how could you say that?\" She turned to Jack. \"She\u0027s a very nice-looking girl. Very polite. Very hard-working. I like her.\" \"You like everybody,\" growled Carl. \"I don\u0027t like you,\" she pointed out. \"That\u0027s true.\" \"What do you mean, weird-looking?\" asked Jack. Cat took a puff and thought a moment. \"I don\u0027t know. Strange. I mean, she doesn\u0027t have a mohawk or anything. She just... Well, sometimes she looks like a princess, you know, all regal and pure.\" \"And other times?\" \"Other times she makes me think of a gang-bang victim waiting for the motorcycles to start.\" The men laughed. Annabelle said, \"Oh, Cherry!\" and gave him a playful slap on the shoulder. Cat was feigning grievous injury when Father Adam returned wearing civvies and a grim look. \"Are we ready?\" he asked. \"We are,\" replied Jack with equal seriousness. They found their way outside and climbed into the truck. Cat insisted Jack drive, saying he was so drunk Jack looked handsome to him. Jack drove without replying. On the way he tried talking to the still stiff young priest. \"Father Adam,\" he began. \"Aha!\" chirped Cat from the back seat. \"Tact!\" \"Shaddup, Cat!\" \"Yes, bwana.\" Jack tried again. He was fairly gentle, the others thought, for him. He explained that the priest needn\u0027t worry too much about this - or, for that matter, any other - reporter. Jack told him about all the reporters they had met and been interviewed by in the past. About all the stories that had been written. About all the editors who had killed the stories. Or their careers trying to push the stories on through. Because nobody believed in vampires. Or wanted to believe in vampires. Or wanted to admit they believed. Or wanted it known that they believed. Or anything else. Jack told him some more about it in their brief drive through Carmel and into the Del Monte Forest. He told about the big stack of apologetic letters from a long string of publications. Told about the one story they did get printed, for the \"Inquiring Minds\" people. About how that story, despite all the fuss and silliness it caused, actually led to their getting a legitimate call from a sheriff in Tennessee. Jack ended with: \"So I wouldn\u0027t worry too much about this girl - what\u0027s her name? Yvette?\" \"Davette,\" corrected Annabelle. \"Whatever. I wouldn\u0027t worry about her. Her tale won\u0027t get printed either. Even if it slams us. They don\u0027t even publish those for some reason. But...\" And he pulled up at a stop sign and turned in his seat and faced the younger man. \"But I wish they would. This ain\u0027t Rome, kid. This is the battleground. And if I could get on Good Morning, America tomorrow morning, I would. One of the biggest troubles we got is belief. Most people don\u0027t or won\u0027t believe until it\u0027s too late. But if they knew about somebody to call without going through all the rigmarole of the feds or the Church or whatever - Well, most times their local priests don\u0027t even buy their fears. But if they knew about somebody who did - and just one or two goddamned days quicker - we could save lots of lives. You get it?\" Adam coughed, cleared his throat. \"Yes, well, it\u0027s just that...\" Jack\u0027s voice was iron. \"Nope. Yes or no, son. There is no third way. Are you here with us or someone else? Yes or no.\" The young priest stared out the front window of the truck for a few moments. Then he glanced at Annabelle, who smiled at him warmly. Finally he looked at Jack. \"Yes, sir.\" Behind them another car at the stop sign honked for them to move. They did. A few minutes later Jack pulled off the famous 17-Mile-Drive and onto a side road that climbed and curved up the side of a bill overlooking the Pebble Beach Golf Course and beyond, the glittering blue of Cannel Bay. Down below had been mostly cottages, but up here astride the ridge were the great estates, walled and spread-out and beautiful, with their towering pines and tennis courts and postcard courtyards and flower-eating deer. The home of Team Crow was one of the grandest atop the ridge, a huge multiwinged tudor mansion set back far from the road, with a five-car two-story garage, a Japanese garden in the rear surrounding a steamy heated pool, and eight acres left to play in. A true palace, thought Jack as he negotiated around a parked car and started up the drive. And incredibly, it had felt too small. But that was before. Don\u0027t think about the phone. Cat and Annabelle were craning their heads to look behind them. \"Is that her?\" she asked. Cat nodded. \"I think so. Looks like her car.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Jack asked. \"It\u0027s Davette,\" Annabelle replied. \"I think she fell asleep out front waiting for us to pick you up from that late plane of yours.\" \"Want me to run down and get her?\" Cat asked. \"No!\" blurted Annabelle firmly. Jack glanced at her, surprised, as he pulled the truck to a stop in the empty carport. \"I thought you liked her.\" \"I do. But we leave in six hours and I want to put you under first. After that you can talk to her.\" \"Put you under.\" Jack sat cringing behind the wheel as a wave of misery flushed through his system. Put me under, hypnotize me, make me remember back, remember everything that just happened - two weeks ago? Yesterday? Go back there and remember everything and make a tape of that same everything because any one detail might mean the difference later on. Nobody knew shit about vampires and they had to learn, had to, had to... Anthony! Oh, God! I don\u0027t want to go back there again! Adam spoke up from beside him. \"Haven\u0027t you made that last tape yet?\" And Jack\u0027s memory scrambled desperately to help him. \"Sure I have,\" he insisted, looking pale into their faces and feeling sweaty and lost. \"Haven\u0027t I?\" \"No\" was all Annabelle said in reply and it was gentle but it was also firm and that meant she loved him and understood even, but he was going to have to do it anyway. Jack closed his eyes and let the wave pass. He hadn\u0027t thought back once. Not specifically, not in detail. Not once. Not awake. \"How come you know about the tapes?\" Carl asked Adam, and his voice sounded suspicious. And that woke Jack up. Leader again. Depend on me. Rock and roll. Jack turned in his seat and faced Carl. \"This is the kid who keeps track of the tapes for the Man. Been doing it for three years.\" He noticed Cat was also leaning forward with interest, eyeing the man who, he had suddenly learned, knew all his secrets under fire and fear. But all Cat said was \"Oh,\" and leaned back. \"Okay,\" said Jack, yanking the door open. \"Okay,\" he said again, more quietly, to Annabelle. And then they were all clambering out and reaching for bags and starting up the walkway to the front door. \"Six hours, huh?\" Jack asked no one in particular. \"You\u0027ve moved everything already?\" Annabelle was cheery. \"You actually could have flown straight to Dallas, if we could have gotten hold of you to tell you. Carl just has the one load left.\" \"Weapons,\" Carl offered, walking along beside him. \"Crossbows and the like. Gonna have to truck \u0027em to Dallas tomorrow. Stupid F.A.A. feds! Scared to death a closed crate of medieval weapons is gonna take Pan Am to Cuba.\" He laughed. They both paused on the front step. Jack thought he could already hear it ringing. He tried smiling along with Carl as the others gathered in a bottleneck before the door. Somebody was jingling keys. \"Funny thing,\" Carl was saying. \"If it was guns, something they\u0027re already scared enough to know something about, they wouldn\u0027t mind so much.\" He paused, laughed again. \"We oughta be using guns.\" Jack Crow, stepping numbly along with the others into the empty grand foyer, thought: Guns. And then he thought: guns? Guns! Guns! \"Guns?\" he all but shouted. All turned toward him, surprised, alarmed, worried. \"What?\" Carl asked him. \"Guns!\" \"Guns?\" Jack hugged him and yelled: \"Yes, goddammit! Guns! Hot Damn! Guns! Don\u0027t you see?\" \"Guns?\" \"Rock and roll!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-4.html","bookId":2118,"book":{"id":2118,"title":"Vampire$","description":"Storyline: Vampire$ is about a tightly knit group of professional vampire killers. They may say they\u0027re in it for the money, but their death-defying bravado and warm male friendships are as intense as those in any soldier-hero epic. The irrepressible, foul-mouthed, hard-drinkin\u0027 Jack Crow--decked out in high-tech chain mail and wielding a fearsome crossbow--is the leader of the bunch. He\u0027s the sort of man who screams obscenities at the pope, and then weeps in the pontiff\u0027s lap over the horrors he\u0027s witnessed. Vampire$ is one gaudy, action-packed novel. The men are men, the women are vulnerable, and the vampires are mean, ugly monsters. Unless you don\u0027t like that sort of thing, you\u0027ll love it. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/vampire.jpg","author":"John Steakley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/vampire.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:17 PM"}}
