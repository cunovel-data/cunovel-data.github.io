Jack sipped from his drink.\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Davette asked.\\n\\n He thought about a reply, said, \"To understand that, you\u0027d first have to buy it.\"\\n\\n The young girl glanced briefly away then back to him. \"Well, you have to admit it\u0027s pretty hard to believe.\" By God, I think she does believe! Jack thought suddenly.\\n\\n Or at least she\u0027s trying.\\n\\n \"What put you onto us, anyway?\" he asked.\\n\\n She smiled. \"An old friend of my family owns the weekly newspaper that covered your last... uh, mission. I got into that little town, what\u0027s it called?\"\\n\\n \"Bradshaw, Indiana.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Bradshaw. Anyway, I got there two days after you\u0027d left.\" She frowned. \"Nobody would talk about it by then. But I got your address.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky you weren\u0027t on time.\"\\n\\n \"I heard you\u0027d had some trouble.\" He took a sip.\\n\\n \"Some.\"\\n\\n \"Anyone hurt?\"\\n\\n \"Seven.\"\\n\\n \"Was it serious?\"\\n\\n \"Dead. Seven dead.\"\\n\\n She went pale. \"You\u0027re joking! You can\u0027t be serious!\"\\n\\n He just looked at her. \"Okay,\" he said.\\n\\n They were quiet for several seconds. She could tell he meant it. And he could tell it had gotten to her.\\n\\n Finally, he said, \"Let me give you a little advice.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"This is real.\"\\n\\n And they were quiet again for a while.\\n\\n At last she said, \"I don\u0027t know what to say. Or do.\"\\n\\n He stepped away from the wall, shrugging off the somber mood.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what you can do. If you ever get this story printed anywhere - which I frankly doubt - you can put this in it.\" He drained his glass and set it down on the carpet. \"Got your pad with you?\"\\n\\n \"Tape recorder,\" she answered. She dug quickly in her purse, produced it, and held it up.\\n\\n \"Okey doke.\" He stuck a cigarette in his grinning teeth, lit it. \"I\u0027ll give you the grand tour.\"\\n\\n She smiled back, gestured about her. \"It\u0027s certainly a big house. How many bedrooms?\"\\n\\n \"Seven too many.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she said quietly, gazing down the row of empty rooms. Four on one side. Three on the other.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t despair,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just eulogy time.\"\\n\\n And then he did something she knew she would never, for all the rest of her life, forget. Grinning all the while, chain-smoking like mad, he strode from room to room and in each one told one outrageous, impossible, hopelessly funny and (invariably) obscene story about each of its martyred occupants. Smiling, but unable to really laugh along with him, she padded along behind gazing, transfixed, by his every word and gesture.\\n\\n Jack Crow cried easily, readily, as he spoke. But without choking or moaning or even allowing it to interfere with his own laughter. His tone went up and down, was pretend-serious or pretend-drunk or pretend - little boy.\\n\\n She was utterly hypnotized throughout by his blazing pride in his lost team. No. She would never ever forget this. Jack seemed to enjoy it as well. And he seemed to understand her reaction for the compliment it was. He spent an hour and a half being animated and dramatic and hilarious and when he had finished they were both exhausted.\\n\\n Cat appeared in the hallway and reminded him their plane was ready to fly and then was gone.\\n\\n He turned to her and told her where they were going.\\n\\n She said she knew. She said she was from there. From Dallas.\\n\\n He said he missed Texas.\\n\\n So did she, she said.\\n\\n There was a long pause. Downstairs, rock and roll began thumping from somewhere.\\n\\n Then why don\u0027t you come along? was his next question.\\n\\n She looked up at him, her head tilted to hear the muffled sounds.\\n\\n \"I will,\" she replied.\\n\\n And she did. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-6.html","bookId":2118,"book":{"id":2118,"title":"Vampire$","description":"Storyline: Vampire$ is about a tightly knit group of professional vampire killers. They may say they\u0027re in it for the money, but their death-defying bravado and warm male friendships are as intense as those in any soldier-hero epic. The irrepressible, foul-mouthed, hard-drinkin\u0027 Jack Crow--decked out in high-tech chain mail and wielding a fearsome crossbow--is the leader of the bunch. He\u0027s the sort of man who screams obscenities at the pope, and then weeps in the pontiff\u0027s lap over the horrors he\u0027s witnessed. Vampire$ is one gaudy, action-packed novel. The men are men, the women are vulnerable, and the vampires are mean, ugly monsters. Unless you don\u0027t like that sort of thing, you\u0027ll love it. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/vampire.jpg","author":"John Steakley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/vampire.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:17 PM"}}
