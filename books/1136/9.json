{"id":35553,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX","content":"It was almost noon when Peter left Mona and returned to Simon McQuarrie\u0027s cabin. His head was in a whirl and his heart stirred uneasily between joy and grief. Not for many minutes at a time had his thoughts been away from his father. Even when Mona\u0027s dark eyes were smiling at him and her sweet voice was talking to him, his father\u0027s white and hunted face was a vision that never quite faded out of his momentary flashes of happiness. Deep down in his heart was an emptiness which even Mona could not fill, an aching pain which her beauty and her gentleness softened but could not quite drive away. \n \n And Mona tried. In her heart, which was sometimes a woman\u0027s heart in a child\u0027s breast, she knew that Peter was grieving and fighting to hide his grief. The tragedy in her own life, and a sorrow which had been deeper and more pitiless than Peter\u0027s, made her understand and feel what even Adette in her young motherhood might not have sensed so clearly. \n \n It seemed only yesterday to Mona that her mother had laughed and played with her under the big, white sails of the ship, with her father watching them, and only yesterday that the terrible thing had happened in[116] the sea. No one, not even Pierre Gourdon, knew how vividly those hours and days came back to her at times. The forest and the wild things shared her secret, but no others. Over the two graves in the little cemetery at Five Fingers she had said quietly to Peter that morning, \"My father and mother, Peter\"—and that was all. \n \n Something in her voice held Peter from asking for the story of that frightful hour in the maelstroms of the Pit, where Pierre Gourdon had saved her and her father and mother had died. But he felt it. It crept into him and became a part of him, and even Pierre Gourdon would have found it difficult to explain what was born in their hearts in those moments when Peter looked at the big stone into which had been roughly cut the words, \"Paul and Mona Guyon, Died Sept. 27, 1900\"—and then said gently to the girl who stood fighting bravely at his side, \"I\u0027m sorry, Mona.\" For to Pierre they were children. \n \n But there was something in Peter\u0027s soul that was struggling beyond childhood as he returned to Simon\u0027s cabin. Three days, and this day most of all, had shown him his first dim vision of the bridge which spans the illusive way between boy and man. He had lost his father. But his father was not dead, while Mona\u0027s was gone forever. Out of the chaos in his mind these facts kept repeating themselves, and with them came ever more insistently the desire to do something for Mona. And one possible achievement loomed big—the whipping of Aleck Curry! \n \n [117] \n \n Thought of it made his blood tingle. He did not ask himself what it was that Aleck had done to incur Mona\u0027s displeasure. It was sufficient for him to know that she was praying for calamity to fall upon his head. She wanted the crows to pull his hair out. She had prayed for that last night—when she had prayed for his father. And she was sure that God answered prayer. \n \n But it was his own feud with Aleck that fired both his chivalry and his hatred—memory of that moment in which the tug master\u0027s son had thrust Mona\u0027s head back brutally in the edge of the forest, with his big, coarse hands fastened in her hair. In his first encounter with Aleck he had saved Mona but had failed to avenge the outrage. He was sure he could do it now. \n \n Simon took him among the men after dinner and he became acquainted with them all. They went back into the cuttings, and it was three o\u0027clock before Peter found himself alone. Then, instead of going back to Mona, he circled in the edge of the timber until he came to the end of the finger of evergreens that reached almost to the inlet. His heart gave a jump when he saw Aleck on the tug shooting at the flying gulls with a slung-shot. Peter had made up his mind to challenge his enemy calmly and without excitement, as his father would undoubtedly have challenged a man in a similar situation. But his plan changed suddenly. He picked up a stone and hurled it with such accuracy that Aleck, seeing the missile, dodged. Then he jumped ashore. \n \n [118] \n \n Peter waited for him. He was not afraid, but his heart was beating fast. Aleck seemed to have grown considerably overnight, Peter thought. He was almost as big as Jame Clamart, and his face was red with an exultant passion as he advanced, stuffing the slung-shot into one of his pockets. There was no doubt this was just the opportunity Aleck was looking for, and Peter retreated with caution into the balsams and cedars. \n \n Aleck began to run—and Peter ran. He was light as a rabbit on his feet, and as he hopped over logs and underbrush he heard Aleck crashing like a big animal behind him. Twice he allowed his enemy to come almost within reach of him, and then spurted ahead. At last, in the edge of a little cut-over clearing, Aleck stopped. He was puffing and blowing and his fat face was covered with sweat. \n \n \"Runny-cat!\" he choked derisively. \"Runny-cat—runny-cat——\" \n \n He caught himself in amazement as Peter turned and advanced toward him. \"Always smile when you\u0027re in a tight place,\" Peter\u0027s father had taught him, and Peter tried bravely to live up to the rule. A fixed grin was on his face. \"I\u0027m going to lick you,\" he announced cheerfully. \"You\u0027re nothing but a girl-beater and a windbag, an\u0027 your wind\u0027s all gone. I wasn\u0027t running away from you, Fatty—I was leadin\u0027 you on!\" \n \n Aleck stood aghast, gulping hard to get his breath. It seemed impossible that a boy so much smaller than himself would dare face him with such monumental[119] nerve. The bully in him was maddened by Peter\u0027s next insult. \"You\u0027re nothing but a girl-fighter—a hair-puller—a big tub of fat,\" Peter informed him, \"an\u0027 you\u0027ll be yelling for help when I get half done with you!\" \n \n And then Peter jumped in. He was quick. His fists were small but hard. His wind was good. And the suddenness of his attack took Aleck off his guard. The first blow was what Peter called a stomacher, and Aleck let out a huge grunt. He bellowed anathema as he began to swing his heavy arms. Peter reached his nose and one eye and his mouth. He was like a hornet. His two small fists were swiftly moving hammers, and Aleck had never experienced anything like the hail of their blows. They took away from him what breath he had left; his nose began to bleed, his lip was cut, and then Peter gave him another stomacher. Could he have lasted for five minutes at the speed he was going, Aleck would have been a wreck. \n \n But Peter was delivering all his metal in one smashing broadside. Aleck floundered and puffed. One eye closed quickly. Blood smeared his face and shirt. His big mouth began to swell. He was not fighting muscle and brawn—but nerves. Every nerve in Peter\u0027s body was at its breaking point, and he was like a thing gone mad. But he was beating against a mass of dull and stupid flesh that had but few nerves to be shocked into submission. His blows began to carry less force, and he was compelled to breathe with his mouth open. He[120] gave Aleck one last slashing cut in the mouth and then his strength seemed to break. His enemy\u0027s arms tightened around him and they went down together. Peter was under, just as in that other tragic moment when Mona had saved him. But there was no Mona to save him now, not even Buddy to nip at Aleck\u0027s legs and heels. His one consolation was a final look at Aleck\u0027s face close above him. He had done a pretty good job, anyway. In another minute or two the bully would have quit. \n \n Both rested, gaining their breath. Then Aleck began to pommel, weighting Peter down with his entire bulk. \n \n \"I got you now,\" he managed to gasp. \"I got you!\" \n \n Peter saved his breath. He realized the futility of struggling against that weight with what little strength was in him and concentrated all his effort in shielding his face. Aleck was like a porpoise, and every half-minute or so was compelled to cease his jabbing to get a new supply of breath, a large amount of which he wasted in verbal laceration of Peter\u0027s feelings as he pommeled with his fists. \n \n \"I\u0027m a tub of fat, am I?\" he demanded at the beginning of each fresh attack. \"I\u0027m a windbag, eh? A girl-beater, am I? Take that, an\u0027 that, an\u0027 that! An\u0027 yell for your girl, Petey, yell for your girl to come an\u0027 help you!\" \n \n Then he would pause again to gather lung momentum for another attack. Each assault left Peter a little bit more helpless than before. He could feel himself[121] swelling. One eye, he knew was entirely shut. The other he saved by shielding it against his arm. His thoughts were growing a little hazy, too, but all his mental and physical discomfort was dissipated by the threat of a new horror which came in a sudden inspiration of triumph from Aleck\u0027s swollen lips. \n \n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to yell for Mona,\" he said. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to have her come and see what I\u0027ve done to you! A tub of fat, am I? Take that—an\u0027 that——\" \n \n And he did yell when he got his wind again. In reality his challenge for Mona to come and see her Petey licked was husky and not far-reaching, but it seemed to Peter the whole world must hear it. \"An\u0027 when she comes I\u0027m going to make you say you\u0027re licked or I\u0027ll beat your head off,\" Aleck told him. And then he sat up straight, his heavy bulk astride Peter\u0027s slim body, and called Mona\u0027s name again. Peter\u0027s brain went hot. Was this to be the answer to Mona\u0027s prayer? Had Mona really prayed, or had she fooled him? Faith rode over his doubt. Mona wouldn\u0027t lie. She had prayed, and the trouble right now was with him—and not with Mona\u0027s prayer. \n \n Aleck\u0027s swollen face was growing purple in its vociferous calling for Mona. In a moment of safety Peter took a look at it with his one good eye. A thrill shot through him when he found the weakness had left his arms. He was breathing easily, too, in spite of Aleck\u0027s weight. If he could only get up—if he could have just one more chance at that fat, swollen face—— \n \n [122] \n \n It was something quicker than Peter himself that moved him, an intuitive flash, a lightning-swift call of his brain upon hidden forces of self-preservation within him—a twist, a convulsion of his body, a squirming upheaval so sudden and unexpected that Aleck lost his balance with Mona\u0027s name half out of his mouth, and the other half never came. He fell sprawling, and Peter was upon him again like a cat. Aleck\u0027s face was his target, and he beat it—fast, furious and hard. He was amazed at the return of his strength. It exhilarated and inspired him, and in his mad enthusiasm he bit one of Aleck\u0027s ears. A roar of pain came from the bully. Peter\u0027s fist lodged squarely in Aleck\u0027s eye, and a second howl followed the first. \n \n At heart the tug-master\u0027s boy was a coward, like every bully, and in another minute he was crying for quarter. But Peter\u0027s momentum was too great to be stopped on such short notice. He continued, until in the end Aleck Curry was a blubbering, wind-broken, thoroughly whipped rascal, hiding his face in the earth. \n \n Not until then did Peter stand up, seeing the world dimly with one eye. And then—in that glorious moment of triumph and answered prayer—his heart stopped dead in his body for a single moment. Not ten feet away from him stood Mona! Even with his fading vision he saw the wild flush in her face and the joy in her eyes. The truth they betrayed turned his darkening world suddenly into a paradise. She had seen him whip Aleck Curry! \n \n [123] \n \n He turned to Aleck. \"Get up!\" he said. \"Get up or I\u0027ll kick in your ribs!\" \n \n Aleck dragged himself to his knees, then slouched to his feet. He was a pitiable sight. His eyes were little slits. His face was swollen until it looked as though he had the mumps. He was blubbering and gasping for his breath, and for a moment he did not see Mona. \n \n \"Are you licked?\" demanded Peter, coming close to him. \n \n Aleck drew back and put up a shielding hand. \"I guess I got enough,\" he conceded. \n \n \"If you ain\u0027t sure—I mean if you aren\u0027t sure—I\u0027ll finish it,\" said Peter. \n \n \"I got enough.\" \n \n \"Then gimme the slung-shot.\" \n \n Aleck surrendered the weapon. In that moment he caught a dim vision of Mona. He gulped and swallowed a lump in his throat. \n \n \"Now promise Mona you won\u0027t bother her any more. Promise—or I\u0027ll lick you again!\" \n \n \"I promise.\" \n \n \"An\u0027 you won\u0027t throw stones at her gulls?\" \n \n \"No.\" \n \n \"All right, Fatty. Now go on back to the tug. And stay there!\" \n \n He watched Aleck until he had disappeared among the cedars. Then, his business done, he turned toward Mona. A little shyly, with shining eyes, she came to him. He wiped his eye. He could just see her. \n \n [124] \n \n \"Oh, Peter!\" she whispered softly. He could feel her soft little handkerchief at his face, just as he had felt it that first day in the edge of the forest. And she was saying, \"Peter—you\u0027re glorious!\" \n \n And then something happened that sent a tremble through the world on which Peter stood. Raising herself on tiptoe, Mona kissed him softly and sweetly on his swollen lips. \n \n \"There, that is what Aleck Curry has wanted all the time, and I\u0027m giving it to you. Say thank you, Peter!\" \n \n \"Thank you,\" said Peter. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1711/50417.html","bookId":1136,"book":{"id":1136,"title":"A Gentleman of Courage","description":"简介： Pierre Gourdon had the love of God in his heart, a man\u0027s love for a man\u0027s God, and it seemed to him that in this golden sunset of a July afternoon the great Canadian wilderness all about him was whispering softly the truth of his faith and his creed....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1711","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:26 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:26 AM"}}
