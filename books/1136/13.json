{"id":35557,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII","content":"It was many minutes before Peter looked up and saw Father Albanel standing at his side. The little missioner made no movement except to place a hand gently on the boy\u0027s head. Mona\u0027s eyes were wide open and in them was a light of almost unearthly happiness as she looked at Peter. In the pale lamp-glow it seemed as though death had already possessed her, except for those great, shining eyes out of which Father Albanel saw all fever had gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a voice that was low and choking he said, \"You must come away now, Peter—for a little while.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mona\u0027s hands rose in weak protest to Peter\u0027s shoulders, and he bent to meet them, pressing his face down again without shame or embarrassment so that her soft cheek lay close against his own. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joy and gentleness fought with a gathering fear in Father Albanel\u0027s face, and a little at a time, but firmly, he drew Peter away, while between the words he was speaking he breathed a prayer to Sainte Anne and the Mother Mary asking that the boy might be spared the curse of the deadly malady with which he had come in contact. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the door Peter turned, and Mona\u0027s eyes were so[172] strangely and darkly beautiful that he reached back his arms to her with a little cry. \"I\u0027ll come again, Mona! I will! I\u0027ll come soon!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They went down into the room where he had seen Josette and Pierre, with his hand held tightly in the little missioner\u0027s. He had never seen a face more terribly white than Josette\u0027s, and Pierre was like a haggard old man. He looked up at Father Albanel. The missioner\u0027s face was streaming with tears, and through the tears he was smiling. Then he began to speak. He told how Peter had stolen into the house and had gone to Mona. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God sent him,\" he said. \"He has done more than all the physicians and medicines in the world could have done, for he has brought Mona back from the very gates of death. She will live!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The last three words drowned all others for Peter. His breath came in little jerks. Then he found himself crying—in Josette\u0027s arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n Josette pressed Peter to her and covered his pale, cold face with kisses. Her great eyes seemed to drown him with their nearness, and then she too was sobbing, with his face hugged close to hers. It all passed in a very few moments, it seemed to Peter, and Josette went with Father Albanel to Mona\u0027s room. She came back in a little while. Her eyes were shining and the whiteness was gone from her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is true—God has been good to us again,\" she said, looking into Pierre\u0027s wildly questioning eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n [173] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The fever is broken. Her skin is soft and moist. And—she—wants Peter!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Josette and Pierre understood the look that came into Father Albanel\u0027s face. They waited for him to speak. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please let me go,\" begged Peter. \"I won\u0027t make a noise. I\u0027ll sit quiet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Father Albanel swallowed a lump in his throat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And mebby—if I ask her—she\u0027ll go to sleep,\" urged Peter. \\n\\n \\n\\n The missioner nodded his gray head. \"That\u0027s it,\" he said, looking first at Pierre and then at Josette. \"I think if Peter were there, she would sleep. The boy has already been exposed. It cannot be worse. It is God\u0027s will. Let him go and sit beside her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A joyous thrill went through Peter. Father Albanel turned to him and put his hands on the boy\u0027s shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must tell her you can stay only if she will try very hard to go to sleep. After that you mustn\u0027t talk to her. And just as soon as she is asleep you must slip away quietly and come back to us here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I promise,\" said Peter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Josette helped him off with his coat. Then she kissed him, and Peter went softly up the stair. \\n\\n \\n\\n Though he came with scarcely more sound than a shadow to her door Mona heard him. Her eyes were watching for him, so big and shining in her thin white[174] face that to Peter she seemed all eyes. He did not trouble with a stool or chair but knelt beside her bed. Mona\u0027s hands went up to his face and their gentle touch drew him down until she kissed him on the lips. There was no hesitation in her act. It was as if she had always kissed him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please kiss me, Peter,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n He kissed her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was dreaming that over and over,\" she smiled at him faintly, \"and you didn\u0027t come. Now it\u0027s true. And—I\u0027m—so—glad——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mustn\u0027t talk,\" he warned, remembering his duty. \"They said if you said anything after I told you this I\u0027d have to go downstairs. They want you to sleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 I want you to sleep,\" he added courageously. \"You mustn\u0027t say another word—not one!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mona started to speak, then put a finger to her lips, and her eyes glowed at Peter until he felt creeping through him an overwhelming desire to kiss her again. She tucked her hand in his, and he settled down, sitting on the floor. Mona closed her eyes and gave a deep sigh. Her fingers squeezed Peter\u0027s, and Peter\u0027s fingers squeezed back. \\n\\n \\n\\n Half an hour later Josette tiptoed up the stair. Quietly she came through the dim light to the bedside. Mona was asleep. She was breathing evenly for the first time in many days. Peter had leaned over so that his cheek was resting on the thick, soft braid of her[175] hair. Mona\u0027s hand was still clasped in his. And he too was asleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n Josette drew back as quietly as she had entered and returned to Pierre and Father Albanel. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hours later Peter awoke. He thought he was dreaming at first. Then he found his fingers buried in Mona\u0027s braid, and saw her pale face against the pillow. Everything returned to him in a moment, and he moved his cramped legs an inch at a time, and very quietly got on his feet. Mona was asleep. He bent over and listened to her breathing. Then he looked at the little clock that was ticking on a shelf above her table. It was four o\u0027clock. Almost time for the gloomy dawn to come. He must have slept a long time! And Mona had slept too. His heart beat joyously as he backed slowly toward the door, careful not to make the slightest sound. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the room below he found Father Albanel sitting with his gray head bowed over a book which had fallen into his lap. But Josette heard him, still as he had been, and came out of her room. She was in a white nightgown with soft arms bare to her elbows and her hair in two long, loosely plaited braids. \\n\\n \\n\\n To Peter she was more than ever like an angel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sh-h-h-h!\" she whispered, putting a finger to her lips. \"Everyone is asleep, Peter—except you and me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She took his hand and led him into the spare room which had once been Joe\u0027s, and sat down with him for a few moments on the edge of the bed. \\n\\n \\n\\n [176] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are going to stay with us for a while,\" she said in a voice so low and sweet that it was like music to Peter. \"Will you like that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He shook his head affirmatively. \"I wanted to come all the time. I promised Mona I would—if she was ever sick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Josette drew his head gently against her breast. He could hear her heart beating. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am Mona\u0027s mother. After this—how would you like me to be your mother?\" she asked softly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I—I\u0027d like it. But I gotta live with Simon. Dad told me to—until he comes back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The arm about his shoulders tightened a little. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, you must live with Simon. I wouldn\u0027t take you from him. But I\u0027m going to be your mother, Peter—just the same. From now on, all the time, you belong to me just as Mona does.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess that\u0027s why Mona likes me—because I haven\u0027t got a mother,\" he tried to explain. \"But my dad\u0027s coming back. He\u0027ll love you too. Nobody can help loving you, can they?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, Peter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Simon says they can\u0027t. My mother was just like you. I\u0027ve dreamed of her lots of times.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does she look like me—in your dreams, Peter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Last time I thought she was you. We were out in the woods picking flowers, an\u0027 Mona was there. Then she faded away. She always fades away, just sort of melts until you can\u0027t see her—my mother, I[177] mean.\" Suddenly he asked, \"Did you ever see Mona\u0027s mother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Peter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Was she pretty?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All mothers are pretty, Peter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter pondered for a moment. \"I guess mebby they are,\" he said, and then added a little dubiously, \"except now and then. I\u0027ll bet Aleck Curry\u0027s mother isn\u0027t pretty!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To Aleck—she is beautiful,\" whispered Josette, and drew herself gently away from him. \"You must undress and go to bed now, Peter. Good night!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a while after she was gone he sat on the edge of his bed wondering what she had meant in saying that thing about Aleck Curry and his mother. A beast like Aleck couldn\u0027t have a pretty mother. But her words troubled him even after he was undressed and in bed. If by any chance Aleck did have a pretty mother—why—it wasn\u0027t right for Mona and him to hate Aleck as they did, that was all! \\n\\n \\n\\n He didn\u0027t sleep much between then and morning, and when he came out of his room, just as the first cold light of the winter sun was falling in the clearing, happier faces greeted him. Mona was better. In the reaction of joy that had swept over the household there was once more laughter in the kitchen. Josette went up the stair singing. And when at last she called down for Peter he found Mona bolstered up in her bed, and[178] Josette was brushing her hair, which streamed about her in long, beautiful cascades of silken softness. Mona\u0027s eyes and face were different this morning. She was more like the Mona he had known, only thinner and whiter, and she smiled at him when he came through the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n With Josette so near, Peter was a little self-conscious and clumsy in his greeting. But Mona held out her arms, just as she had done last night, and pulled him down to her, and kissed him. \\n\\n \\n\\n From that day the great fact in the lives of the two children was accepted in Five Fingers. Mona and Peter belonged to each other. And so sure was Father Albanel of God\u0027s intention in the matter that he felt no worry about Peter, in spite of the fact that the boy had come in fearfully close contact with the deadly malady. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He will not catch the sickness,\" he said confidently. \"God didn\u0027t send him for that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And as day after day passed, and only good news continued to come from the Gourdon cabin, those who had at first doubted also came to believe; for Mona\u0027s coming back from death, and Peter\u0027s escaping the plague, were miracles like those which happened at the precious shrine of Ste. Anne de Beaupré, and only God could have brought them about. \\n\\n \\n\\n In two weeks Mona was out of bed and on her feet. And from that day, Peter noticed, she did not hold out her arms to him again, or ask him to kiss her. But[179] her eyes were always soft and full of happiness when he was near her. \\n\\n \\n\\n The last of winter passed, and spring came. May followed April, and flowers sprang up in the clearing. The birds returned, work began in the fields, and in the sweetness and promise of life Five Fingers rose out of the grimness of its tragedy. \\n\\n \\n\\n One warm day when they had gone to the big beaver pond, just a week after Mona\u0027s fourteenth birthday, Peter said something that he was thinking, and didn\u0027t mean to say at all. He had been thinking it off and on for a long time, and the words slipped out of him before he knew it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You never ask me to kiss you any more,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Girls don\u0027t ask boys to kiss them—not unless they\u0027re sick,\" replied Mona, looking at him with eyes so bright that Peter felt every drop of blood in his body rushing to his face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I—I sometimes wish you was sick again!\" blundered Peter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Peter!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I do,\" he affirmed stubbornly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mona\u0027s cheeks were flushing until they were the color of a rose. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly her eyes flashed and she stamped a little foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to kiss me or you\u0027d ask for it!\" she cried. \"I always had to make you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a new thought for Peter to ponder upon.[180] Half an hour later, when they were almost home, he came to a decision. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do!\" he exclaimed suddenly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You do what?\" asked Mona, who had been livelier than ever in hunting for flowers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can guess.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to guess.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll give you three chances,\" offered Peter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter was desperate. \"You didn\u0027t mean what you said, then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What did I say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You said I didn\u0027t want to kiss you or I\u0027d ask for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well—you haven\u0027t asked.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I did. I just asked.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mona\u0027s lovely eyes opened wide. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you, Peter? I didn\u0027t hear it. Please ask again!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter gulped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will I what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let me kiss you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For what seemed at least an hour to Peter she stood looking at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I do—will you promise never to kiss any other girl?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I promise.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [181] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And never let any other girl kiss you? I mean Adette Clamart, too!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As long as you live?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As long as I live.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With a little gesture of gladness and satisfaction Mona Guyon held up the prettiest mouth in all Five Fingers, and Peter kissed it. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1711/50421.html","bookId":1136,"book":{"id":1136,"title":"A Gentleman of Courage","description":"简介： Pierre Gourdon had the love of God in his heart, a man\u0027s love for a man\u0027s God, and it seemed to him that in this golden sunset of a July afternoon the great Canadian wilderness all about him was whispering softly the truth of his faith and his creed....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1711","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:26 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:26 AM"}}
