{"id":35554,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X","content":"Peter was conscious of the fact that he had lived a long time in the last three days and four nights. His adventures during that brief period of time had run the entire gamut of human emotions, with the possible exception of a desire to laugh, and his fourteen years of life seemed entirely out of fact. This philosophy did not strike Peter, but it did work into the troubled soul of Simon McQuarrie as he told Pierre Gourdon why it was that Peter\u0027s father was a hunted man, fleeing for his life, and how it had come about that Peter was now in Five Fingers seeking refuge with him. \"And I\u0027m going to keep him,\" he said. \"I love the boy.\" What Simon had to say struck deep into Pierre Gourdon\u0027s heart, for it recalled the day of years ago when he had made his great fight in the sea to save a strange woman and her little girl, and had succeeded in bringing only the child, Mona, ashore. And Mona had grown to be a part of his soul. So when Simon had finished, Pierre nodded his head thoughtfully and said: \"Mona brought Peter to me today. He has the making of a man in him. And he has promised to whip[126] Aleck Curry if he troubles Mona again.\" He chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. \"Aleck is almost twice as big as Peter,\" he added. \"But the boy has courage. It may happen. And—we will make this a home for him, Simon.\" \"And if that round-headed young blackguard of an Aleck sets upon Peter again,\" said Simon slowly, \"I\u0027ll make his father take it out of his hide or never sell him another foot of lumber!\" The gentle smile did not leave Pierre\u0027s eyes. A forest man, and son of many generations of wilderness people, a warm thrill of superstition and an immeasurable faith in the God that had made his beautiful world lay deep in his soul. Simon guessed what was in his mind when he saw him looking at a green patch of flower-strewn slope where lay the graves of Mona\u0027s father and mother. The smile faded slowly from Pierre\u0027s face, and a little of anxiety, of dread almost, replaced it. \"The years have been kind to us,\" he said, speaking more to himself than to Simon. \"It has been a long time since Dominique Beauvais and I brought our wives through these forests for the first time, and now there are more than fifty of us here—all our own people and friends. There has been little of tragedy and much of happiness. The plot up there is empty—except for Mona\u0027s people. Sometimes—I am afraid.\" \"Peace and comfort have been with us,\" agreed the Scotchman. Behind them were the yellow piles of sawdust[127] and the droning of the big steel saw in Simon\u0027s little mill as it cut its way through the hearts of timber. Simon loved the mill as Pierre loved the cabins he had helped to build, for the mill had brought prosperity to the wilderness people. It had also made necessary the ugly black tug which lay down in Middle Finger Inlet. The creases grew deeper in Simon\u0027s hard face as his eyes rested on the tug. \"I wish some other man than Izaak Curry was taking our lumber,\" he said. \"Maybe I\u0027d like him if it wasn\u0027t for his boy. If that ugly lad ever puts his hands on Peter again, or on Mona——\" He hunched his gaunt shoulders with a suggestive grunt. Pierre was looking off toward the timbered line behind which Lake Superior was hidden, half a mile away. For a moment after Simon\u0027s threatening words he remained silent. His face was thoughtful. \"It is strange,\" he said, giving voice to what was in his mind. \"Through children has come most of our happiness at Five Fingers, Simon—and all of our tragedy. It was seven years ago that the strange ship went to pieces out there and I saved Mona from the sea. She is one of us now, and if she should be taken away our hearts would break. And now comes Peter, whose mother is dead, and whose father is worse than dead—for Peter—because he is an outlaw. It makes me think of a long time ago when a boy came into Ste. Anne de Beaupré, away down on the St. Lawrence, just as Peter came to Five Fingers three days ago.[128] His father and mother were dead of the plague back in the forest, and he was ragged and starved, and the first person he met was a little girl, just as Peter met Mona, and afterward he fought for her, and married her when he grew old enough, and—she is Josette, my wife. It is almost as if Peter was me. And I am wondering——\" He did not finish. But Simon nodded understandingly. \"Things happen like that,\" he said. Out of the edge of the evergreen timber which ran down to the white sands of Middle Finger Inlet Mona was leading Peter. One of his eyes was entirely closed. His lips were swollen and his face was grimy and red with the marks of battle. He was a little dizzy. There was a ringing in his ears, and with his one good eye he could see the world but dimly. The green forests were a blur. The sunlight was a mellow glow. Mona\u0027s face, flaming with pride and joy, was an ethereal vision of loveliness which he saw as if through a number of gossamer veils. But in spite of his wrecked appearance his heart was beating with a swift and glorious exultation. He had kept his promise to Mona, to Simon McQuarrie and to Pierre Gourdon, for he had met and whipped Aleck Curry. The tug-master\u0027s son had begged for mercy, and the riotous thrill of it all was that Mona had looked upon that splendid battle and the ignominious defeat of the overgrown[129] bully upon whose head she had earnestly prayed calamity might fall. Peter was fighting hard to maintain a calm and dignified mental balance as they came out of the forest. Mona\u0027s fingers clung to his hand. Her face was flushed and her eyes were shining like lovely stars. But it was the kiss he felt most of all—that warm and sweet and amazingly unexpected tribute she had placed on his lips in the moment of his triumph. It was a new thing to Peter. Since his mother had died he had never experienced anything like it and he could only faintly remember his mother. Through the years since then his father had kissed him every night before he went to sleep. But Mona\u0027s kiss was different. It remained with him in a strange and embarrassingly persistent way. \"I knew you could do it,\" Mona was saying, a tremble of pleasure in her voice. \"I just knew it, Peter! Does your eye hurt?\" \"Not much.\" \"Can you see?\" \"Pretty good.\" She drew in a breath of deep and sincere appreciation. \"I got there just in time to see you bite Aleck\u0027s ear,\" she said. \"Oh, how he did howl!\" Peter\u0027s conscience smote him. \"It ain\u0027t—I mean, it isn\u0027t fair to bite another fellow\u0027s ear,\" he explained, \"but he stuck it in my mouth and I couldn\u0027t help it.\" [130] \"I wish you\u0027d bit off his nose,\" said Mona. \"If I were a boy and had hold of his ear with teeth like yours, I wouldn\u0027t let go.\" A generous impulse filled Peter\u0027s breast. \"I\u0027ll lick him again tomorrow if you want me to,\" he offered. They went up the green slope from the inlet. Peter could hear better than he could see. He could hear the soft croaking of the gulls and the singing of the birds and the steely music of the saw in the mill. His bad eye was toward Mona, so that unless he gave his head a full turn he could not see her at all. A sweaty discomfort possessed him whenever he believed she was making a fresh survey of the disfigurements Aleck had fastened upon him. With his triumph rode the humiliating conviction that his face was out of joint and not pleasant to look at. \"It\u0027ll be better tomorrow,\" he said. \"What will?\" she asked. \"My face. It must look sort of funny.\" \"Not half as funny as Aleck Curry\u0027s,\" she comforted him. \"And if anyone dares to laugh at you—after what happened out there——\" Peter caught the flash in her dark eyes. In spite of his protest she pulled him through the open door of Jame Clamart\u0027s cabin. Adette was bending over the crib of young Telesphore. Her big blue eyes widened and she gave a little gasp when she saw Peter, his hand still held in Mona\u0027s. And then, to his horror, she giggled. [131] In an instant Mona was at her side. \"Adette Clamart, don\u0027t you dare laugh!\" she cried. \"If you had seen it! If you had seen him whip Aleck Curry——\" \"But his eye!\" exclaimed Adette chokingly. \"I mean that eye, Mona—the one that\u0027s open! It looks so—so funny!\" \"He\u0027s better-looking right now than Jame Clamart will ever be,\" retorted Mona with fierce dignity. \"He hasn\u0027t got a snub nose, anyway—and that\u0027s what your baby is going to have when he grows up!\" \"But his eye!\" persisted Adette, the giggling choking her. \"Why is it so round and glassy, Mona? It\u0027s just like the end of my new glass salt shaker! Oh, oh, oh——\" \"Adette Clamart!\" Peter, stunned and speechless, watched Mona drag Adette into the kitchen. As if drawn by an irresistible magnet, his one eye followed them, and Adette—looking back—gave a final little screech of laughter before the door closed behind her. Peter heard the tittering beyond that door, and Mona\u0027s protesting voice rising above it. He felt as if warm water had been poured down his back. He was clammy, and his heart had sunk down into his middle. He must be a terrible sight! Then he saw young Telesphore looking at him over the edge of the crib. In one of his fat fists the baby clutched the knife which Peter had given him earlier[132] in the day. Peter went nearer and grinned at his young friend. The effort hurt him. Telesphore\u0027s mouth fell slowly ajar as he stared at Peter. He gave no sign of recognition. The jovial comradeship of a few hours ago was gone and his gaze was steady and perplexed. And then, as if desirous of possessing another strange article of interest, he dropped his knife and reached for Peter\u0027s one eye. Peter drew back. Adette was still laughing at him and Telesphore did not recognize him! He remembered a little mirror hanging on the wall and hurried to it. He was shocked. The thrill of triumph left him. His pride sank—and he sneaked through the open door as quickly as he could and trotted toward the big yellow piles of sawdust, hoping he might reach them before Mona discovered his flight. Screened by the piles, he came up behind Simon McQuarrie\u0027s cabin and almost bumped into a little man with a great head of shaggy gray hair, a round face with rosy cheeks, and eyes that were at first amazed and then twinkled merrily as they looked at Peter. He was a stranger. But swiftly and instinctively Peter liked him. Something in the way he rubbed his hands together and chuckled built up a confidence and comradeship between them immediately. Peter attempted a grin. \"I been in a fight,\" he acknowledged cheerfully, for there was an attitude and quality about this little man that demanded some kind of explanation. \"I been in a fight with Aleck Curry.\" [133] \"And he worsted you,\" guessed the merry stranger. \"No, sir. I beat him up. I made him howl, and he promised never to bother Mona or her pets again. Mona knows. She saw it.\" The little man placed a hand on his shoulder. It was a gentle hand. Its touch comforted Peter. \"Come in and let me fix you up, Peter. That is your name, isn\u0027t it—Peter McRae?\" \"Yes, sir.\" They went into the cabin. The little man seemed at home in Simon\u0027s place, for he found the medicine cupboard immediately, and was soon busy poulticing and bandaging Peter\u0027s tortured face. \"Aleck is a troublesome boy,\" he said. \"I hope you punished him well. But he is so much larger than you! Aren\u0027t you afraid of what may happen next time?\" Peter shook his head. \"I know how to do it now. I run away from him until he\u0027s winded, then beat him up. I\u0027m going to lick him again tomorrow if Mona wants me to.\" \"Good!\" smiled the little man. His face grew rosier and a light was in his eyes that pleased Peter. \"But I wouldn\u0027t try it on Sunday,\" he advised. \"It\u0027s bad luck to fight on the Lord\u0027s Day. If you\u0027ll wait until Monday, I will take you out into the woods and show you a few tricks that may help you! And if it can be quietly arranged, Peter, I would like to see the next fight you have with Aleck Curry. [134] \"You like fights?\" asked Peter. \"In a good cause—yes.\" Peter was thoughtful as his cheerful and comforting companion fastened a bandage over his closed eye. \"Sunday isn\u0027t such a bad day for a fight,\" he argued. \"You could get Aleck Curry out in the woods somewhere, tell \u0027im you wanted to show him something, an\u0027 I could sneak up—an\u0027 we could have it right there. I ain\u0027t—I mean I\u0027m not afraid of Sunday!\" \"I\u0027m not thinking so much of you as I am of myself,\" said the little man, laughing softly. \"I mustn\u0027t let pleasure come before duty—on Sunday. You see, I have to preach tomorrow.\" \"You have to—what?\" \"Preach. Down there in the little church. I\u0027m Father Albanel, Peter.\" For the second time in the last half-hour Peter\u0027s earth seemed slipping unevenly under his feet. Father Albanel! Mona had told him about the wonderful forest missioner who had no church and no set religion, but who wandered through hundreds of miles of wilderness, preaching the faith of God wherever he went, and who came every few weeks to Five Fingers. \"All the forest people love him, and he is so good I think God must love him most of all,\" she had said. \"He buried my father and mother.\" And this was Father Albanel—this little man with the jolly face and twinkling eyes, and he—Peter McRae—had invited him to witness a fight on Sunday! He squirmed[135] uneasily. He could feel the hot blood rising up through his neck into his face. He wet his swollen lips and tried to save himself. \"I didn\u0027t know you was the preacher,\" he said. \"I guess mebbe it isn\u0027t right to fight on Sunday.\" Father Albanel\u0027s hands pressed gently upon the boy\u0027s thin shoulders. \"It\u0027s right to fight any time, Peter—when you have a just fight to make. God loves a peacemaker but He also has no use for a coward—and no one but a coward would refuse to fight for Mona. Will you come and hear me tomorrow?\" \"I\u0027ll come,\" promised Peter. When Father Albanel had gone he climbed up the ladder to his bed of blankets close under the sweet-smelling cedar roof and undressed. The sun was low in the west and the afternoon song of the mill had ceased. The robins were chirping their evening notes. It was supper time, and Simon McQuarrie was late. Half an hour passed before Peter heard him enter the cabin. He came directly to the ladder and climbed up. In the twilight he bent over Peter. \"Feeling sick, Peter?\" \"No, sir.\" Simon knelt upon the edge of the blankets. \"I\u0027ve heard about the fight,\" he said, in a voice which trembled a little in its unaccustomed softness. \"Mona told me, and then Adette, and after that I went down to the tug to have it out with Izaak Curry—and his boy. But—Peter—lad, when I saw Aleck I had[136] no heart to speak harshly to his father. I\u0027m proud of you!\" In the silence he bent his face nearer to Peter\u0027s. \"Want something to eat, lad?\" \"I can\u0027t eat,\" explained Peter huskily. \"My mouth is swollen shut.\" It was then Simon McQuarrie\u0027s hard lips touched Peter\u0027s cheek—the first kiss he had given in many years. \"Good night,\" he whispered. \"You\u0027re Donald McRae\u0027s son—every inch of you!\" And Peter listened to his heavy feet as he slowly descended the ladder.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1711/50418.html","bookId":1136,"book":{"id":1136,"title":"A Gentleman of Courage","description":"简介： Pierre Gourdon had the love of God in his heart, a man\u0027s love for a man\u0027s God, and it seemed to him that in this golden sunset of a July afternoon the great Canadian wilderness all about him was whispering softly the truth of his faith and his creed....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1711","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:26 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:26 AM"}}
