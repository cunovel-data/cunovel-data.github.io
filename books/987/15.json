{"id":43048,"no":15,"title":"THE LIKES O\u0027 US","content":"IT was the General Officer Commanding, riding down the Mall, on the Arab with the perky tail, and he condescended to explain some of the mysteries of his profession. But the point on which he dwelt most pompously was the ease with which the Private Thomas Atkins could be \"handled,\" as he called it. \"Only feed him and give him a little work to do, and you can do anything with him,\" said the General Officer Commanding. \"There\u0027s no refinement about Tommy, you know; and one is very like another. They\u0027ve all the same ideas and traditions and prejudices. They\u0027re all big children. Fancy any man in his senses shooting about these hills.\" There was the report of a shot-gun in the valley. \"I suppose they\u0027ve hit a dog. Happy as[Pg 110] the day is long when they\u0027re out shooting dogs. Just like a big child is Tommy.\" He touched up his horse and cantered away. There was a sound of angry voices down the hillside. \"All right, you soor—I won\u0027t never forget this—mind you, not as long as I live, and s\u0027 \u0027elp me—I\u0027ll——\" The sentence finished in what could be represented by a blaze of asterisks. A deeper voice cut it short: \"Oh, no, you won\u0027t, neither! Look a-here, you young smitcher. If I was to take yer up now, and knock off your \u0027ead again\u0027 that tree, could ye say anythin\u0027? No, nor yet do anythin\u0027. If I was to——Ah! you would, would you? There!\" Some one had evidently sat down with a thud, and was swearing nobly. I slid over the edge of the khud, down through the long grass, and fetched up, after the manner of a sledge, with my feet in the broad of the back of Gunner Barnabas in the Mountain Battery, my friend, the very strong man. He was sitting upon a man—a khaki-coloured volcano of blasphemy—and was preparing to[Pg 111] smoke. My sudden arrival threw him off his balance for a moment. Then, readjusting his chair, he bade me good-day. \"\u0027Im an\u0027 me \u0027ave bin \u0027avin\u0027 an arg\u0027ment,\" said Gunner Barnabas placidly. \"I was going for to half kill him an\u0027 \u0027eave \u0027im into the bushes \u0027ere, but, seein\u0027 that you \u0027ave come, sir, and very welcome when you do come, we will \u0027ave a court-martial instead. Shacklock, are you willin\u0027?\" The volcano, who had been swearing uninterruptedly through this oration, expressed a desire, in general and particular terms, to see Gunner Barnabas in Torment and the \"civilian\" on the next gridiron. Private Shacklock was a tow-haired, scrofulous boy of about two-and-twenty. His nose was bleeding profusely, and the live air attested that he had been drinking quite as much as was good for him. He lay, stomach-down, on a little level spot on the hillside; for Gunner Barnabas was sitting between his shoulder-blades, and his was not a weight to wriggle under. Private Shacklock could barely draw breath to swear, but he did the best that in him[Pg 112] lay. \"Amen,\" said Gunner Barnabas piously, when an unusually brilliant string of oaths came to an end. \"Seein\u0027 that this gentleman \u0027ere has never seen the inside o\u0027 the orsepitals you\u0027ve gotten in, and the clinks you\u0027ve been chucked into like a hay-bundle, per-haps, Privite Shacklock, you will stop. You are a-makin\u0027 of \u0027im sick.\" Private Shacklock said that he was pleased to hear it, and would have continued his speech, but his breath suddenly went from him, and the unfinished curse died out in a gasp. Gunner Barnabas had put up one of his huge feet. \"There\u0027s just enough room now for you to breathe, Shacklock,\" said he, \"an\u0027 not enough for you to try to interrupt the conversashin I\u0027m a-havin\u0027 with this gentleman. Choop!\" Turning to me, Gunner Barnabas pulled at his pipe, but showed no hurry to open the \"conversashin.\" I felt embarrassed, for, after all, the thus strangely unearthed difference between the Gunner and the Line man was no affair of mine. \"Don\u0027t you go,\" said Gunner Barnabas. He had evidently been deeply moved by something. He dropped his[Pg 113] head between his fists and looked steadily at me. \"I met this child \u0027ere,\" said he, \"at Deelally—a fish-back recruity as ever was. I knowed \u0027im at Deelally, and I give \u0027im a latherin\u0027 at Deelally all for to keep \u0027im straight, \u0027e bein\u0027 such as wants a latherin\u0027 an\u0027 knowin\u0027 nuthin\u0027 o\u0027 the ways o\u0027 this country. Then I meets \u0027im up here, a butterfly-huntin\u0027 as innercent as you please—convalessin\u0027. I goes out with \u0027im butterfly-huntin\u0027, and, as you see \u0027ere, a-shootin\u0027. The gun betwixt us.\" I saw then, what I had overlooked before, a Company fowling-piece lying among some boulders far down the hill. Gunner Barnabas continued: \"I should ha\u0027 seen where he had a-bin to get that drink inside o\u0027 \u0027im. Presently, \u0027e misses summat. \u0027You\u0027re a bloomin\u0027 fool,\u0027 sez I. \u0027If that had been a Pathan, now!\u0027 I sez. \u0027Damn your Pathans, an\u0027 you, too,\u0027 sez \u0027e. \u0027I strook it.\u0027 \u0027You did not,\u0027 I sez, \u0027I saw the bark fly.\u0027 \u0027Stick to your bloomin\u0027 pop-guns,\u0027 sez \u0027e, \u0027an\u0027 don\u0027t talk to a better man than you.\u0027 I laughed there, knowin\u0027 what I was an\u0027 what[Pg 114] \u0027e was. \u0027You laugh?\u0027 sez he. \u0027I laugh,\u0027 I sez, \u0027Shacklock, an\u0027 for what should I not laugh?\u0027 sez I. \u0027Then go an\u0027 laugh in Hell,\u0027 sez \u0027e, \u0027for I\u0027ll \u0027ave none of your laughin\u0027.\u0027 With that \u0027e brings up the gun yonder and looses off, and I stretches \u0027im there, and guv him a little to keep \u0027im quiet, and puts \u0027im under, an\u0027 while I was thinkin\u0027 what nex\u0027, you comes down the \u0027ill, an\u0027 finds us as we was.\" The Private was the Gunner\u0027s prey—I knew that the affair had fallen as the Gunner had said, for my friend is constitutionally incapable of lying—and I recognised that in his hands lay the boy\u0027s fate. \"What do you think?\" said Gunner Barnabas, after a silence broken only by the convulsive breathing of the boy he was sitting on. \"I think nothing,\" I said. \"He didn\u0027t go at me. He\u0027s your property.\" Then an idea occurred to me. \"Hand him over to his own Company. They\u0027ll school him half dead.\" \"Got no Comp\u0027ny,\" said Gunner Barnabas. \"\u0027E\u0027s a conv\u0027lessint draft—all sixes an\u0027 sevens. Don\u0027t matter to them what he did.\" \"Thrash[Pg 115] him yourself, then,\" I said. Gunner Barnabas looked at the man and smiled; then caught up an arm, as a mother takes up the dimpled arm of a child, and ran the sleeve and shirt up to the elbow. \"Look at that!\" he said. It was a pitiful arm, lean and muscleless. \"Can you mill a man with an arm like that—such as I would like to mill him, an\u0027 such as he deserves? I tell you, sir, an\u0027 I am not smokin\u0027 (swaggering), as you see—I could take that man—Sodger \u0027e is, Lord \u0027elp \u0027im!—an\u0027 twis\u0027 off \u0027is arms an\u0027 \u0027is legs as if \u0027e was a naked crab. See here!\" Before I could realise what was going to happen, Gunner Barnabas rose up, stooped, and taking the wretched Private Shacklock by two points of grasp, heaved him up above his head. The boy kicked once or twice, and then was still. He was very white. \"I could now,\" said Gunner Barnabas, \"I could now chuck this man where I like. Chuck him like a lump o\u0027 beef, an\u0027 it would not be too much for him if I chucked. Can I thrash such a man with[Pg 116] both \u0027ands? No, nor yet with my right \u0027and tied behind my back, an\u0027 my lef\u0027 in a sling.\" He dropped Private Shacklock on the ground and sat upon him as before. The boy groaned as the weight settled, but there was a look in his white-lashed, red eyes that was not pleasant. \"I do not know what I will do,\" said Gunner Barnabas, rocking himself to and fro. \"I know \u0027is breed, an\u0027 the way o\u0027 the likes o\u0027 them. If I was in \u0027is Comp\u0027ny, an\u0027 this \u0027ad \u0027appened, an\u0027 I \u0027ad struck \u0027im, as I would ha\u0027 struck him, \u0027twould ha\u0027 all passed off an\u0027 bin forgot till the drink was in \u0027im again—a month, maybe, or six, maybe. An\u0027 when the drink was frizzin\u0027 in \u0027is \u0027ead he would up and loose off in the night or the day or the evenin\u0027. All acause of that millin\u0027 that \u0027e would ha forgotten in betweens. That I would be dead—killed by the likes o\u0027 \u0027im, an\u0027 me the next strongest man but three in the British Army!\" Private Shacklock, not so hardly pressed as he had been, found breath to say that if he could only get hold of the fowling-piece again[Pg 117] the strongest man but three in the British Army would be seriously crippled for the rest of his days. \"Hear that!\" said Gunner Barnabas, sitting heavily to silence his chair. \"Hear that, you that think things is funny to put into the papers! He would shoot me, \u0027e would, now; an\u0027 so long as he\u0027s drunk, or comin\u0027 out o\u0027 the drink, \u0027e will want to shoot me. Look a-here!\" He turned the boy\u0027s head sideways, his hand round the nape of the neck, his thumb touching the angle of the jaw. \"What do you call those marks?\" They were the white scars of scrofula, with which Shacklock was eaten up. I told Gunner Barnabas this. \"I don\u0027t know what that means. I call \u0027em murder-marks an\u0027 signs. If a man \u0027as these things on \u0027im, an\u0027 drinks, so long as \u0027e\u0027s drunk, \u0027e\u0027s mad—a looney. But that doesn\u0027t \u0027elp if \u0027e kills you. Look a-here, an\u0027 here!\" The marks were thick on the jaw and neck. \"Stubbs \u0027ad \u0027em,\" said Gunner Barnabas to himself, \"an\u0027 Lancy \u0027ad \u0027em, an\u0027 Duggard \u0027ad \u0027em, an\u0027 wot\u0027s come to them? You\u0027ve got \u0027em,\" he said, addressing[Pg 118] himself to the man he was handling like a roped calf, \"an\u0027 sooner or later you\u0027ll go with the rest of \u0027em. But this time I will not do anything—exceptin\u0027 keep you here till the drink\u0027s dead in you.\" Gunner Barnabas resettled himself and continued: \"Twice this afternoon, Shacklock, you \u0027ave been so near dyin\u0027 that I know no man more so. Once was when I stretched you, an\u0027 might ha\u0027 wiped off your face with my boot as you was lyin\u0027; an\u0027 once was when I lifted you up in my fists. Was you afraid, Shacklock?\" \"I were,\" murmured the half-stifled soldier. \"An\u0027 once more I will show you how near you can go to Kingdom Come in my \u0027ands.\" He knelt by Shacklock\u0027s side, the boy lying still as death. \"If I was to hit you here,\" said he, \"I would break your chest, an\u0027 you would die. If I was to put my \u0027and here, an\u0027 my other \u0027and here, I would twis\u0027 your neck, an\u0027 you would die, Privite Shacklock. If I was to put my knees here an\u0027 put your \u0027ead so, I would pull off your \u0027ead, Privite Shacklock,[Pg 119] an\u0027 you would die. If you think as how I am a liar, say so, an\u0027 I\u0027ll show you. Do you think so?\" \"No,\" whispered Private Shacklock, not daring to move a muscle, for Barnabas\u0027s hand was on his neck. \"Now, remember,\" went on Barnabas, \"neither you will say nothing nor I will say nothing o\u0027 what has happened. I ha\u0027 put you to shame before me an\u0027 this gentleman here, an\u0027 that is enough. But I tell you, an\u0027 you give \u0027eed now, it would be better for you to desert than to go on a-servin\u0027 where you are now. If I meets you again—if my Batt\u0027ry lays with your Reg\u0027ment, an\u0027 Privite Shacklock is on the rolls, I will first mill you myself till you can\u0027t see, and then I will say why I strook you. You must go, an\u0027 look bloomin\u0027 slippy about it, for if you stay, so sure as God made Paythans an\u0027 we\u0027ve got to wipe \u0027em out, you\u0027ll be loosing off o\u0027 unauthorised amminition—in or out o\u0027 barricks, an\u0027 you\u0027ll be \u0027anged for it. I know your breed, an\u0027 I know what these \u0027ere white marks mean. You\u0027re mad, Shacklock,[Pg 120] that\u0027s all—and here you stay, under me. An\u0027 now choop, an\u0027 lie still.\" I waited and smoked, and Gunner Barnabas smoked till the shadows lengthened on the hillside, and a chilly wind began to blow. At dusk Gunner Barnabas rose and looked at his captive. \"Drink\u0027s out o\u0027 \u0027im now,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t move,\" whimpered Shacklock. \"I\u0027ve got the fever back again.\" \"I\u0027ll carry you,\" said Gunner Barnabas, swinging him up and preparing to climb the hill. \"Good-night, sir,\" he said to me. \"It looks pretty, doesn\u0027t it? But never you forget, an\u0027 I won\u0027t forget neither, that this \u0027ere shiverin\u0027, shakin\u0027, convalescent a-hangin\u0027 on to my neck is a ragin\u0027, tearin\u0027 devil when \u0027e\u0027s lushy—an\u0027 \u0027e a boy!\" He strode up to the hill with his burden, but just before he disappeared he turned round and shouted: \"It\u0027s the likes o\u0027 \u0027im brings shame on the likes o\u0027 us. \u0027Tain\u0027t we ourselves, s\u0027elp me Gawd, \u0027tain\u0027t!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3067/84765.html","bookId":987,"book":{"id":987,"title":"Abaft the Funnel","description":"简介： THE measure of a man\u0027s popularity is not alwaysor indeed seldomthe measure of his intrinsic worth.
