{"id":43053,"no":20,"title":"THE BOW FLUME CABLE-CAR","content":"\"SEE those things yonder?\" He looked in the direction of the Market Street cable-cars which, moved without any visible agency, were conveying the good people of San Francisco to a picnic somewhere across the harbour. The stranger was not more than seven feet high. His face was burnished copper, his hands and beard were fiery red and his eyes a baleful blue. He had thrust his large frame into a suit of black clothes which made no pretensions toward fitting him, and his cheek was distended with plug-tobacco. \"Those cars,\" he said, more to himself than to me, \"run upon a concealed cable worked by machinery, and that\u0027s what broke our syndicate at Bow Flume. Concealed machinery, no—concealed ropes. Don\u0027t you[Pg 205] mix yourself with them. They are ontrustworthy.\" \"These cars work comfortably,\" I ventured. \"They run over people now and then, but that doesn\u0027t matter.\" \"Certainly not, not in \u0027Frisco—by no means. It\u0027s different out yonder.\" He waved a palm-leaf fan in the direction of Mission Dolores among the sandhills. Then without a moment\u0027s pause, and in a low and melancholy voice, he continued: \"Young feller, all patent machinery is a monopoly, and don\u0027t you try to bust it or else it will bust you. \u0027Bout five years ago I was at Bow Flume—a minin\u0027-town way back yonder—beyond the Sacramento. I ran a saloon there with O\u0027Grady—Howlin\u0027 O\u0027Grady, so called on account of the noise he made when intoxicated. I never christened my saloon any high-soundin\u0027 name, but owing to my happy trick of firing out men who was too full of bug-juice and disposed to be promiscuous in their dealin\u0027s, the boys called it \u0027The Wake Up an\u0027 Git Bar.\u0027 O\u0027Grady, my partner, was an unreasonable inventorman.[Pg 206] He invented a check on the whisky bar\u0027ls that wasn\u0027t no good except lettin\u0027 the whisky run off at odd times and shutting down when a man was most thirstiest. I remember half Bow Flume city firing their six-shooters into a cask—and Bourbon at that—which was refusing to run on account of O\u0027Grady\u0027s patent double-check tap. But that wasn\u0027t what I started to tell you about—not by a long ways. O\u0027Grady went to \u0027Frisco when the Bow Flume saloon was booming. He hed a good time in \u0027Frisco, kase he came back with a very bad head and no clothes worth talkin\u0027 about. He had been jailed most time, but he had investigated the mechanism of these cars yonder—when he wasn\u0027t in the cage. He came back with the liquor for the saloon, and the boys whooped round him for half a day, singing songs of glory. \u0027Boys,\u0027 says O\u0027Grady, when a half of Bow Flume were lying on the floor kissing the cuspidors and singing \u0027Way Down the Swanee River,\u0027 being full of some new stuff O\u0027Grady had got up from \u0027Frisco—\u0027boys,\u0027 says O\u0027Grady, \u0027I have the makings of a com[Pg 207]pany in me. You know the road from this saloon to Bow Flume is bad and \u0027most perpendicular.\u0027 That was the exact state of the case. Bow Flume city was three hundred feet above our saloon. The boys used to roll down and get full, and any that happened to be sober rolled them up again when the time came to get. Some dropped into the ca?on that way—bad payers mostly. You see, a man held all the hill Bow Flume was built on, and he wanted forty thousand dollars for a forty-five by hundred lot o\u0027 ground. We kept the whisky and the boys came down for it. The exercise disposed them to thirst. \u0027Boys,\u0027 says O\u0027Grady, \u0027as you know, I have visited the great metropolis of \u0027Frisco.\u0027 Then they had drinks all round for \u0027Frisco. \u0027And I have been jailed a few while enjoying the sights.\u0027 Then they had drinks all round for the jail that held O\u0027Grady. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I have a proposal to make.\u0027 More drinks on account of the proposal. \u0027I have got a hold of the idea of those \u0027Frisco cable-cars. Some of the idea I got in \u0027Frisco.[Pg 208] The rest I have invented,\u0027 says O\u0027Grady. Then they drank all round for the invention. \"I am coming to the point. O\u0027Grady made a company—the drunkest I ever saw—to run a cable-car on the \u0027Frisco model from \u0027Wake Up an\u0027 Git Saloon\u0027 to Bow Flume. The boys put in about four thousand dollars, for Bow Flume was squirling gold then. There\u0027s nary shanty there now. O\u0027Grady put in four thousand dollars of his own, and I was roped in for as much. O\u0027Grady desired the concern to represent the resources of Bow Flume. We got a car built in \u0027Frisco for two thousand dollars, with an elegant bar at one end—nickel-plated fixings and ruby glass. \"The notion was to dispense liquor en route. A Bow Flume man could put himself outside two drinks in a minute and a half, the same not being pressed for urgent business. The boys graded the road for love, and we run a rope in a little trough in the middle. That rope ran swift, and any blame fool that had his foot cut off, fooling in the middle of the road, might ha\u0027 found salvation by using our[Pg 209] Bow Flume Palace Car. The boys said that was square. O\u0027Grady took the contract for building the engine to wind the rope. He called his show a mule—it was a crossbreed between a threshing machine and an elevator ram. I don\u0027t think he had followed the \u0027Frisco patterns. He put all our dollars into that blamed barroom on the car, knowing what would please the boys best. They didn\u0027t care much about the machinery, so long as the car hummed. \"We charged the boys a dollar a head per trip. One free drink included. That paid—paid like—Paradise. They liked the motion. O\u0027Grady was engineer, and another man sort of tended to the rope engine when he wasn\u0027t otherwise engaged. Those cable-cars run by gripping on to the rope. You know that. When the grip\u0027s off the car is braked down and stands still. There ought to have been two cars by right—one to run up and the other down. But O\u0027Grady had a blamed invention for reversing the engine, so the cable ran both ways—up to Bow Flume and down to the[Pg 210] saloon—the terminus being in front of our door. A man could kick a friend slick from the bar into the car. The boys appreciated that. The Bow Flume Palace Car Company earned twenty on the hundred in three months, besides the profits of the drinks. We might have lasted to this day if O\u0027Grady hadn\u0027t tinkered his blamed engine up on top of Bow Flume Hill. The boys complained the show didn\u0027t hum sufficient. They required railroad speed. O\u0027Grady ran \u0027em up and down at fourteen miles an hour; and his latest improvement was to touch twenty-four. The strain on the brakes was terrible—quite terrible. But every time O\u0027Grady raised the record, the boys gave him a testimonial. \u0027Twasn\u0027t in human nature not to crowd ahead after that. Testimonials demoralise the publickest of men. \"I rode on the car that memorial day. Just as we started with a double load of boys and a razzle-dazzle assortment of drinks, something went zip under the car bottom. We proceeded with velocity. All the prominent members of the company were aboard. \u0027The grip has got[Pg 211] snubbed on the rope,\u0027 says O\u0027Grady quite quietly. \u0027Boys, this will be the biggest smash on record. Something\u0027s going to happen.\u0027 We proceeded at the rate of twenty-four miles an hour till the end of our journey. I don\u0027t know what happened there. We could get clear of the rope anyways at the point where it turned round a pulley to start up hill again. We struck—struck the stoop of the \u0027Wake Up an\u0027 Git Saloon\u0027—my saloon—and the next thing I knew was feeling of my legs under an assortment of matchwood and broken glass, representing liquor and fixtures to the tune of eight thousand. The car had been flicked through the saloon, bringing down the entire roof on the floor. It had then bucked out into the firmament, describing a parabola over the bluff at the back of the saloon, and was lying at the foot of that bluff, three hundred feet below, like a busted kaleidoscope—all nickel, shavings and bits of red glass. O\u0027Grady and most of the prominent members of the company were dead—very dead—and there wasn\u0027t enough left of the saloon to pay for a drink.[Pg 212] I took in the situation lying on my stomach at the edge of the bluff, and I suspicioned that any lawsuits that might arise would be complicated by shooting. So I quit Bow Flume by the back trail. I guess the coroner judged that there were no summons—leastways I never heard any more about it. Since that time I\u0027ve had a distrust to cable-cars. The rope breaking is no great odds, bekase you can stop the car, but it\u0027s getting the grip tangled with the running rope that spreads ruin and desolation over thriving communities and prevents the development of local resources.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3067/84770.html","bookId":987,"book":{"id":987,"title":"Abaft the Funnel","description":"简介： THE measure of a man\u0027s popularity is not alwaysor indeed seldomthe measure of his intrinsic worth.
