{"id":43036,"no":3,"title":"HER LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY","content":"And No Man May Answer for the Soul of His Brother IT was two in the morning, and Epstin\u0027s Dive was almost empty, when a Thing staggered down the steps that led to that horrible place and fawned on me disgustingly for the price of a drink. \"I\u0027m dying of thirst,\" he said, but his tone was not that of a street loafer. There is a freemasonry, the freemasonry of the public schools, stronger than any that the Craft knows. The Thing drank whisky raw, which in itself is not calculated to slake thirst, and I waited at its side because I knew, by virtue of the one sentence above recorded, that it once belonged to my caste. Indeed, so small is the world when one begins to travel round it, that, for aught I[Pg 13] knew, I might even have met the Thing in that menagerie of carefully-trained wild beasts, Decent Society. And the Thing drank more whisky ere the flood-gates of its speech were loosed and spoke of the wonderful story of its fall. Never man, he said, had suffered more than he, or for slighter sin. Whereat I winked beerily into the bottom of my empty glass, having heard that tale before. I think the Thing had been long divided from all social and moral restraint—even longer from the wholesome influence of soap and water. \"What I feel most down here,\" said It, and by \"down here\" I presume he meant the Inferno of his own wretchedness, \"is the difficulty about getting a bath. A man can always catch a free lunch at any of the bars in the city, if he has money enough to buy a drink with, and you can sleep out for six or eight months of the year without harm, but San Francisco doesn\u0027t run to free baths. It\u0027s not an amusing life any way you look at it. I\u0027m more or less used to things, but it hurts me even now to meet[Pg 14] a decent man who knows something of life in the old country. I was raised at Harrow—Harrow, if you please—and I\u0027m not five-and-twenty yet, and I haven\u0027t got a penny, and I haven\u0027t got a friend, and there is nothing in creation that I can command except a drink, and I have to beg for that. Have you ever begged for a drink? It hurts at first, but you get used to it. My father\u0027s a parson. I don\u0027t think he knows I beg drink. He lives near Salisbury. Do you know Salisbury at all? And then there\u0027s my mother, too. But I have not heard from either of them for a couple of years. They think I\u0027m in a real estate office in Washington Territory, coining money hand over fist. If ever you run across them—I suppose you will some day—there\u0027s the address. Tell them that you\u0027ve seen me, and that I am well and fit. Understand?—well and fit. I guess I\u0027ll be dead by the time you see \u0027em. That\u0027s hard. Men oughtn\u0027t to die at five-and-twenty—of drink. Say, were you ever mashed on a girl? Not one of these you see, girls out here, but an English one—the sort of girl[Pg 15] one meets at the Vicarage tennis-party, don\u0027t you know. A girl of our own set. I don\u0027t mean mashed exactly, but dead, clean gone, head over ears; and worse than that I was once, and I fancy I took the thing pretty much as I take liquor now. I didn\u0027t know when to stop. It didn\u0027t seem to me that there was any reason for stopping in affairs of that kind. I\u0027m quite sure there\u0027s no reason for stopping half-way with liquor. Go the whole hog and die. It\u0027s all right, though—I\u0027m not going to get drunk here. Five in the morning will suit me just as well, and I haven\u0027t the chance of talking to one of you fellows often. So you cut about in fine clothes, do you, and take your drinks at the best bars and put up at the Palace? All Englishmen do. Well, here\u0027s luck; you may be what I am one of these days. You\u0027ll find companions quite as well raised as yourself. \"But about this girl. Don\u0027t do what I did. I fell in love with her. She lived near us in Salisbury; that was when I had a clean shirt every day and hired horses to ride. One of[Pg 16] the guineas I spent on that amusement would keep me for a week here. But about this girl. I don\u0027t think some men ought to be allowed to fall in love any more than they ought to be allowed to taste whisky. She said she cared for me. Used to say that about a thousand times a day, with a kiss in between. I think about those things now, and they make me nearly as drunk as the whisky does. Do you know anything about that love-making business? I stole a copy of Cleopatra off a book-stall in Kearney Street, and that priest-chap says a very true thing about it. You can\u0027t stop when it\u0027s once started, and when it\u0027s all over you can\u0027t give it up at the word of command. I forget the precise language. That girl cared for me. I\u0027d give something if she could see me now. She doesn\u0027t like men without collars and odd boots and somebody else\u0027s hat; but anyhow she made me what I am, and some day she\u0027ll know it. I came out here two years ago to a real estate office; my father bought me some sort of a place in the firm. We were all Englishmen, but we were about a match for an average[Pg 17] Yankee; but I forgot to tell you I was engaged to the girl before I came out. Never you make a woman swear oaths of eternal constancy. She\u0027ll break every one of them as soon as her mind changes, and call you unjust for making her swear them. I worked enough for five men in my first year. I got a little house and lot in Tacoma fit for any woman. I never drank, I hardly ever smoked, I sold real estate all day, and wrote letters at night. She wrote letters, too, about as full of affection as they make \u0027em. You can tell nothing from a woman\u0027s letter, though. If they want to hide anything, they just double the \u0027dears\u0027 and \u0027darlings,\u0027 and then giggle when the man fancies himself deceived. \"I don\u0027t suppose I was worse off than hundreds of others, but it seems to me that she might have had the grace to let me down easily. She went and got married. I don\u0027t suppose she knew exactly what she was doing, because I got the letters just the same six weeks after she was married! It was an odd copy of an English paper that showed me what had happened.[Pg 18] It came in on the same day as one of her letters, telling me she would be true to the gates of death. Sounds like a novel, doesn\u0027t it? But it did not amuse me in the least. I wasn\u0027t constructed to pitch the letters into the fire and pick up with a Yankee girl. I wrote her a letter; I rather wish I could remember what was in that letter. Then I went to a bar in Tacoma and had some whisky, about a gallon, I suppose. If I had anything approaching to a word of honour about me, I would give it you that I did not know what happened until I was told that my partnership with the firm had been dissolved, and that the house and lot did not belong to me any more. I would have left the firm and sold the house, anyhow, but the crash sobered me for about three days. Then I started another jamboree. I might have got back after the first one, and been a prominent citizen, but the second bust settled matters. Then I began to slide on the downgrade straight off, and here I am now. I could write you a book about what I have come through, if I could remember it. The worst[Pg 19] of it is I can see that she wasn\u0027t worth losing anything in life for, but I\u0027ve lost just everything, and I\u0027m like the priest-chap in Cleopatra—I can\u0027t get over what I remember. If she had let me down easy, and given me warning, I should have been awfully cut up for a time, but I should have pulled through. She didn\u0027t do that, though. She lied to me all along, and married a curate, and I dare say she\u0027ll be a virtuous she-vicar later on; but the little affair broke me dead, and if I had more whisky in me I should be blubbering like a calf all round this Dive. That would have disgusted you, wouldn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes,\" said I. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3067/84753.html","bookId":987,"book":{"id":987,"title":"Abaft the Funnel","description":"简介： THE measure of a man\u0027s popularity is not alwaysor indeed seldomthe measure of his intrinsic worth.
