Edward had no idea to whom he spoke—but he knew the power behind that cloaked voice. It was somehow appropriate the voice was computerized, because he knew he was speaking to a vast machine, a powerhouse that had moved throughout the ages, destroying all in its wake and retooling the chaos to suit its ends.\n And Edward wanted to be more than a cog in that vast machine; he intended to drive that massive engine. It had been luck that landed Amanda on his doorstep—his egg-harvesting clinic, one of many in this region, had been chosen to facilitate this matter—but it would take his skill to turn that good fortune into an opportunity to move up the ladder.\n To achieve that, he needed success.\n “The problem is being addressed,” Edward promised. “The Americans will never reach the mountains in time.”\n “AND THE FETUS?” the voice asked.\n “The DNA is stable. As we all hoped.”\n He dabbed the sweat from his brow with the back of a sleeve. At least that was good news. Plans could move forward—behind schedule, yes, but still salvageable.\n Edward continued, “As to that other matter, I can perform the C-section immediately. Get things ready.”\n “VERY GOOD.” Though the voice was flat and affectless, Edward imagined the satisfaction behind those inhuman inflections.\n “And what of the mother?” Edward asked, suspecting this was a touchy matter.\n The answer came without hesitation. “SHE’S NO LONGER OF USE. HER DEATH WILL SERVE A GREATER PURPOSE.”\n “Understood.”\n The voice moved on to exacting detail about how preparations and procedures would continue from here. One last item concerning the mother was addressed.\n “BURN HER BODY. IT SHOULD BE UNRECOGNIZABLE.”\n The sweat down his back went cold. The pure callousness both appalled and excited him. What would it be like to move through the world with such utter disregard for morality—driven only by purpose?\n The call finally ended.\n Lost in preparations, he vacated the communications tent, strode through the sun-speckled glade of the camp, and up the steps to the makeshift medical ward. He tried his best to wear such a mantle of amoral drive as he stepped through the door and let it clap shut behind him.\n Petra glanced up, shifting a fall of blond hair, her face open and questioning.\n Edward looked beyond her to the hospital bed at the back of the ward. Amanda stared at him. He must have failed to fully don that cold mantle; something must have still shone in his face. The patient pulled her legs up, an instinctive desire to protect her child.\n But it’s not your child that needs protecting at the moment …\n Edward turned to Petra. “Get everything ready. We’re doing this now.”\n 12\n July 2, 12:15 P.M. East Africa Time\n UNICEF camp, Somalia\n With the blast still ringing in his head, Tucker pulled the dazed boy to his feet. Kane shook off dust and pieces of thatch. Smoke and sand floated in the air. The air reeked of burned flesh and flaming fuel.\n The rocket had hit outside the hut, collapsing a corner of the clay-brick structure. A large blackened crater opened a few yards away. Bodies lay strewn at the edge, tossed and torn like so many rag dolls.\n Tucker found his breathing growing heavier, flashing back to prior firefights in Afghanistan. He pulled the boy’s face into his chest, not wanting him to see. Baashi didn’t resist. Though deafened, he still felt the boy crying in terror, felt his wracking sobs.\n Captain Alden groaned and rolled onto his rear end. Blood covered half his face, but it appeared to be only from a scalp wound. He must have caught a piece of the blast debris.\n “Get him out of here!” Alden yelled, flopping his arm weakly toward the door.\n Others rose out of the smoke, shedding rubble, bearing cuts and abrasions. Gray stumbled forward with Seichan.\n Kowalski helped Major Jain to her feet. She wobbled slightly but found her footing. “You okay?” he asked\n She shook free of him—teetered sideways, then grabbed his arm again. “Maybe not.”\n When the Indian woman spotted her captain, she still tried to go to him, concern on her face. Alden waved her off. “Go with them, Jain. Help get them clear.”\n “What about you?” Gray grabbed the map from the floor and passed it to Baashi. They still needed the boy to pinpoint the secret medical encampment rumored to be up in the mountains. Even rattled, the commander never lost sight of the mission objective. “Captain, you need medical attention.”\n Alden grinned through the gore. “Then I guess I’m bloody well at the right place, aren’t I, commander?” He teetered back to his feet. “Besides, I’ve got two men here. I’m not leaving them until I know they’re safe.”\n Or dead, Tucker added silently.\n Punctuating that dour thought, another blast rocked deeper into the camp. Kane flinched, ducking lower.\n Gray grabbed the captain by the upper arm. “You’ll do your men no good on your own.” He dragged the Brit out the door. “Come with me.”\n Alden looked ready to argue, but Major Jain backed Gray up.\n “Commander Pierce is right, sir.”\n “Maybe we can argue later!” Kowalski shouted at them by the door. “Chopper’s swinging back this way!”\n “Out of here! Now!” Gray ordered.\n The captain reluctantly followed. They rounded the hut and moved out among the field of parked vehicles.\n Tucker guessed where the commander was taking them. He would’ve done the same, to utilize every resource to survive.\n Gray led them straight to the minitank, painted white and emblazoned with the UN world logo. The Daimler Ferret armored car still sat where they’d seen it earlier. The peacekeeper posted beside it had climbed into the turret, manning the machine gun. The weapon smoked from prior shots, but the helicopter was currently beyond range on the other side of the camp, although it wouldn’t take long for the chopper to circle back around.\n Gray called to the peacekeeper as a handful of refugees fled to either side of them. “You’re a sitting duck up there, soldier! You need to get this vehicle moving, help defend the camp.”\n The man, dark-skinned and helmeted, yelled back in a French accent. He was young, likely not even twenty. Fear frosted his words. “I am alone! I cannot shoot and drive, monsieur.”\n Gray turned to Alden. “Here is how you can best help your men. Put this tank in motion. Draw the chopper’s attention and take that bastard down.”\n Alden understood. “I’ll do what I can to cover your escape.” The captain pointed to a pair of sand-rail buggies fifty yards away. The skeletal dune runners looked perfectly suited for this rough terrain. “If there are no keys, they’re easy to hotwire. Just jam something sharp into the ignition and twist to get them started.”\n The captain’s next words were for his fellow soldier. “Stay with them, Jain. Get them all clear, and I’ll see what I can do from here.”\n The major looked exasperated, but she knew how to take orders and nodded.\n Gray shook Alden’s hand as they parted ways. “Be safe.”\n “You do the same.” The captain stopped long enough to give Baashi a fast hug. “Do what they say!”\n “I … I will, Mr. Trevor.”\n The captain nodded and climbed into the armored car.\n Gray hurried them forward, ordering them to secure their radio earpieces in place.\n Ahead, the sand-rail cars were little more than engines strapped to roll cages with some seats bolted in place. They had no windows, fenders, or doors. But Tucker had played with them back in the dunes near Camp Pendleton. Their advantage was a low center of gravity and high flotation tires perfect for skimming over sand and hopping over obstacles.\n Kowalski must have had a similar experience and rubbed his palms together as they reached the vehicles. “Which one’s mine?”\n Machine-gun fire erupted behind them. They all leaped forward and split on the run, dividing between a smaller two-seater, which Gray and Seichan commandeered, and a larger four-seater with a bench in the rear.\n Jain reached the driver’s seat first, but Kowalski wasn’t having any of it.\n “I’ll drive!” he yelled.\n “Listen, boyo, I’ve had plenty of tactical driving—”\n “And I didn’t just get a concussion. So move it, sister!”\n She looked ready to bite his head off, but she was still wobbly on her feet. She finally relented and abandoned the driver’s seat to Kowalski. He discovered a screwdriver already jammed in place in the steering column, serving as a key. Judging by the roar next to them, Gray started his vehicle with no more difficulty.\n Jain took the passenger seat up front, leaving the rear bench to Tucker and the boy. Kane crouched between them, panting, flinging a bit of drool in his adrenaline-fired excitement.\n “Hang on!” Kowalski yelled, grinning way too big.\n The buggy leaped forward like a bee-stung horse—just as an ear-shattering explosion flung a nearby truck into the air.\n Another rocket blast.\n Tucker twisted around. Behind them, the helicopter roared out of the camp and aimed toward them. An M230 chain-gun on the chopper’s undercarriage chewed across the sand—chasing after them.\n But they weren’t defenseless.\n The Ferret armored car raced into view, as fleet-footed on its large tires as its nimble namesake. It crossed into the path of the attack helicopter. From the minitank’s turret, the machine gun chattered, firing up at the bird in the sky.\n Captain Alden manned the weapon himself, shrouded in gun smoke and swirls of dusty sand. The minitank skidded around to face the diving helicopter head-on. Rounds cracked into the chopper’s windshield, driving the bird to the side as the pilot panicked.\n The armored car spun a full circle and took off, driving wildly through the parked vehicles. The chopper twisted in midair and took off after them, like a hawk after a fleeing rabbit—or, in this case, a fleeing ferret. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-19.html","bookId":1527,"book":{"id":1527,"title":"Bloodline (Sigma Force #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Bloodline (Sigma Force #8) \n Galilee, 1025.
