{"id":10038,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. AT THE DINNER-TABLE.","content":"At five o’clock Gilbert started from the park, where he had sauntered about for several hours, and reached the house of Mr. Briggs half an hour or more before dinner. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Your room is ready,” said the servant, who had received her instructions. “Shall I show you the way up?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “If you please. Has my trunk come?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, sir.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “The dinner-hour is six, I believe.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, sir. The bell will ring at that time.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Gilbert understood that he was expected to remain in his room till dinner-time. That, however, would have been his choice. \\n\\n \\n\\n He followed the servant to a small hall-bedroom on the third floor, where he found his trunk awaiting 49him. He opened it, and, taking out his comb and brush, and a clean collar, made his dinner toilet. A new life had opened before him, and he could not help wondering what it would be like. In the midst of his meditations came the sound of the bell, and he went downstairs. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Briggs was already present. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well,” said he, stiffly, “so you found your way here?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, sir.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Did you see Mrs. Briggs?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, sir.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And how have you spent the day?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I spent the afternoon at Central Park.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Was Randolph with you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, sir. It wasn’t necessary; I found my way without any trouble.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Here Mrs. Briggs entered. \\n\\n \\n\\n She nodded slightly to Gilbert, and said, in a chilly way:— \\n\\n \\n\\n “Take that seat, Mr. Greyson.” \\n\\n \\n\\n 50Gilbert seated himself, and Randolph, who entered directly afterwards, sat down opposite. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You were not with Gilbert to-day, Randolph,” said his father. \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, sir.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Where were you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “At the theatre.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Humph! you go to the theatre too much.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “How can you say so, Mr. Briggs?” said the mother, who, though her heart was cold to all beside, fairly idolized her son, and as a consequence foolishly indulged him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “This is the second time he has been this week.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “The boy is young, and needs recreation.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It seems to me it is all recreation with him, and no work. When I was a boy, I was lucky if I could go to a place of amusement once in three months.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You hadn’t got a rich father,” said Randolph. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am not made of money,” muttered Mr. Briggs, “though you seem to think I am.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Really, Mr. Briggs,” said his wife, “it is ridiculous to expect Randolph to spend as little as you did 51when you were a boy. The circumstances are quite different.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Briggs frowned, but did not answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n “What did you do with yourself?” asked Randolph, turning to Gilbert. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I went to Central Park. It is a beautiful place.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I never go there,” said Randolph. “You meet only low persons there.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I saw many driving about in handsome carriages. Are they low?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Of course not. I meant only low persons walk there.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Randolph is right,” said his mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Still I think I shall go again,” said Gilbert. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, it’s different with you. You are a poor boy, aint you?” said Randolph, bluntly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gilbert colored a little. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I only know what your father has told me,” said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Have you got any property of Gilbert’s, father?” asked Randolph. \\n\\n \\n\\n 52“This is not the time to ask such questions,” said his father, looking annoyed. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why not? There is no company—no one but ourselves.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Ahem!” said Mr. Briggs, clearing his throat: “there was a very small property, but it has all been spent on Gilbert’s education.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Who left him the property?” asked Randolph, persistently. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gilbert was interested in the answer to this question, and he looked with eager inquiry at his guardian, hoping that he would reveal what he had so long desired to know. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You are very curious,” said Mr. Briggs, displeased. \\n\\n \\n\\n “There’s no reason why you shouldn’t tell me; is there, father?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No,” answered his father, slowly. “The money was left him by his father, who was an old schoolmate of mine. He died in the West Indies, and sent me the money in trust for his son, to provide for him as long as it lasted. It was exhausted nearly a year since, but I kept Gilbert at school till now at my own 53expense. Now the time has come when he must shift for himself.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Rather hard on you, Gilbert,” said Randolph. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am willing to look out for myself,” said Gilbert, quietly. “My father did all he could for me. I have a good education, thanks partly to you, Mr. Briggs, and I ought to be able to make my way.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, you are welcome,” said Mr. Briggs, rather uncomfortably. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You have done more than could have been expected, Mr. Briggs,” said his wife. “Why did you not take the boy from school months ago?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I wanted him to have a fair education.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It seems to me he was already sufficiently educated for his sphere in life,” said the lady. “I don’t believe in educating persons beyond their station.” \\n\\n \\n\\n There was something in the lady’s remarks which grated harshly upon the ear of our young hero. What right had Mrs. Briggs to assume that his station was inferior to hers? The dislike which he had already begun to entertain for her was increased. He found it impossible to like any of the family, but he 54had insight enough to see that in cold selfishness Mrs. Briggs exceeded her husband and son. \\n\\n \\n\\n “It seems to me,” said Mr. Briggs, in answer to his wife’s last remark, “that a good education is a good thing for any one to possess, be he rich or poor.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You wouldn’t advise a boy that was going to be a mechanic to study Latin or Greek, would you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “If he liked it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then I can’t agree with you,” retorted the lady, sharply; “I consider it simply time and money thrown away.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Have you studied Latin and Greek, Gilbert?” asked Randolph. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Have you gone far in them?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “In a year I should have been ready to enter Yale College.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And after all I suppose you will be a mechanic.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why should I be?” demanded Gilbert. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You have no money.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I suppose there are other kinds of business I can learn.” \\n\\n \\n\\n 55“Perhaps so.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Apparently tiring of the subject, Randolph turned to his mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Has any invitation come for me?” he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Invitation—to what?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I hear that Laura Vivian is going to give a party. I didn’t know but she might invite me.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “The Vivians do not visit us. I should be glad to become acquainted. They move in the very first society. Do you know Laura?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I knew her at dancing-school. I used to dance with her sometimes. She was a great favorite. All the boys wanted her for a partner.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It is hardly likely she will invite you. I wish she would.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “What is the name of the young lady?” asked Gilbert, interested. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Laura Vivian. What interest can you feel in her?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I made the young lady’s acquaintance this afternoon,” said Gilbert, quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Laura Vivian? Impossible.” \\n\\n \\n\\n 56“Doesn’t she live in West Forty-eighth Street?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then it is the same one, as you will see by this card.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Here Gilbert produced the card referred to in the last chapter. \\n\\n \\n\\n “How on earth did you get acquainted with her?” exclaimed Mrs. Briggs. “Who introduced you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I believe I introduced myself,” said Gilbert, smiling. “I’ll tell you all about it,” and he recounted the circumstances of his acquaintance. \\n\\n \\n\\n “She invited you to call?” exclaimed Randolph, enviously. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Do you mean to go?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I shall go once, out of politeness.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “She will think you want to be repaid your five cents,” said Mrs. Briggs, disagreeably. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I don’t think she will,” said Gilbert. “At any rate I will take the risk.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Will you take me with you?” asked Randolph. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I hardly think it would be proper,” said Gilbert; 57“but if I have a second invitation I may take the liberty of doing so.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Gilbert is right,” said Mr. Briggs. \\n\\n \\n\\n Randolph was disappointed, and indulged in a sneer at a penniless boy like Gilbert calling on a young lady of high social position. But Gilbert did not choose to notice it. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1888/54486.html","bookId":793,"book":{"id":793,"title":"Shifting For Himself","description":"简介： Shifting for Himself records the experiences of a boy who, in the course of a preparation for college, suddenly finds himself reduced to poverty.
