{"id":10071,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII. GILBERT’S SHIP COMES IN.","content":"It may well be supposed that Gilbert wished, as soon as possible, to question his guardian on a subject having such an important bearing upon his future career. It occurred to him that it might be well to consult a lawyer first; but he finally decided not to do so. Personally Mr. Briggs had treated him kindly, and he did not wish, unless it should prove absolutely necessary, to assume a position antagonistic to him. Gilbert reached his guardian’s house about eight o’clock in the evening. He had received a note from Fred Vivian, stating that he was going to the theatre, and would not require a lesson that evening. This gave him abundant time for the interview. Mrs. Briggs and Randolph had gone to make a call, and Gilbert found Mr. Briggs alone. In dressing-gown 338and slippers he was conning the evening paper when Gilbert was announced. “Good-evening, Gilbert,” said Mr. Briggs, cordially. “I am glad to see you.” “Thank you, sir,” said Gilbert, gravely. “I was feeling a little lonely. Mrs. Briggs and Randolph have gone out to make a call. How have you got on since I went away?” “I am doing well now, sir; but at one time my prospects looked dark.” “How is that?” asked Mr. Briggs, surprised. “I thought I left you well provided for.” It was Gilbert’s turn to look surprised. “Didn’t Randolph tell you about my losing my situation?” he asked. “Not a word. How came you to lose it?” Gilbert told the story, already familiar to the reader. He also told about his regaining it. “That must have been disagreeable; and, of course, you felt the loss of income. But your board was at least provided for. You received money for that from my office?” 339“No, sir; not a cent.” “Why not? I left directions to that effect.” Gilbert’s cheek flushed. “I called on Mrs. Briggs, to inquire about it,” he said, reluctantly; “but she chose to treat me as a beggar, and I declined to receive anything.” Mr. Briggs looked annoyed. “I am afraid,” he said, desirous of excusing his wife, “that you are too sensitive, Gilbert. Mrs. Briggs is a little unfortunate in her manner, and gave you a wrong impression. However, you shall not suffer for it. Come round to the office to-morrow, and I will give you a sum equal to what you would have had if I had been at home.” “Thank you, sir,” said Gilbert; but still he looked grave. “Does not that satisfy you?” asked Mr. Briggs, a little annoyed. Gilbert felt that the time had come for his question. “I came here to-night, Mr. Briggs,” he commenced, “to ask you a question.” 340“Ask it, of course,” said the merchant, quite unprepared for what was coming. Gilbert fixed his clear, penetrating eyes on his guardian’s face. “My father left you some money in trust for me; did he not, sir?” “Certainly. I told you so.” “I know it, sir. Will you tell me what it amounted to?” “Really,” said Mr. Briggs, uncomfortably, “I can’t tell without looking over my papers. What makes you ask?” “Did it not amount to seventy-five thousand dollars?” demanded Gilbert, quietly. Richard Briggs nearly started from his seat in surprise and dismay. That was the amount, as he well knew; but how on earth could the boy have found out? He saw that his ward had obtained some dangerously accurate information somewhere; and that he was thoroughly in earnest in his inquiry. “Who could have put such a thought into your head?” he asked, slowly and hesitatingly. 341“I won’t make a secret of it,” said Gilbert. “I have made the acquaintance of a man who knew my father. He tells me he was his book-keeper up to the time of his death. He claims to know all about my father’s affairs, and the amount of property he left.” “There is some great mistake,” muttered the merchant. “I don’t think there can be. Mr. Talbot has, in his possession, and has showed to me, an autograph-letter of my father, in which he gives full details on this subject.” “Where is this Talbot?” asked Mr. Briggs, abruptly. “He is living in this city.” “Where?” “You must excuse me, Mr. Briggs. At present I do not wish to tell you.” “He may be an impostor.” “I have thought of that; but such an imposition could not be carried out. I think he tells the truth.” “Suppose I believe the contrary,—what, then?” “You have reason to know whether what he says 342is correct or not, Mr. Briggs,” said Gilbert, resolutely. “If you deny it, and assert that he is an impostor, I will consult a lawyer, and have him cross-examine him on the subject, and give me his opinion.” “You have not spoken to a lawyer yet?” said Mr. Briggs, uneasily. “No, sir.” “Lawyers are fond of instituting lawsuits. Probably one would report favorably.” “I should want to know his grounds. And I would not consent to a suit, unless he convinced me there was good ground for it.” “Gilbert,” said the merchant, “I feel friendly to you, and I want you to succeed. Say no more about this affair, and to-morrow I will make over to you bank-shares amounting to ten thousand dollars. That will give you a good start in life.” “I only want what is my own,” said Gilbert, sturdily. “I want what my father left me.” Mr. Briggs rose, and paced the room in silence. His good and bad angel were contending for the 343supremacy. The conflict came to an end, and his better nature triumphed. He resumed his seat, looking no longer perplexed or troubled, but as one who had thrown off a burden. “Gilbert,” he said, “it is all true. I have tried to be a villain; but I won’t be one any longer. Your father left you a fortune, and it shall be restored to you.” Gilbert rose, and grasped Mr. Briggs’ hand cordially. Boy as he was, he comprehended the struggle through which his guardian had passed. “Thank you, sir,” he said. “I shall forget all that has passed; and I ask you to remain my guardian, and take care of my property for me.” Man of the world as he was, Mr. Briggs was touched by this proof of generous confidence. “I don’t deserve this, Gilbert; but I will do as you ask. I will, however, see a lawyer, and make such arrangements that whatever may happen to me you will be safe.” At that moment the bell rang. “I think Mrs. Briggs and Randolph have returned,” 344said the merchant. “One word, Gilbert, of what has passed between us, let it only be known that you have received a large legacy, and that I am your guardian in reality as well as in name.” “All right, sir. Perhaps I had better go. Mrs. Briggs don’t like me.” Her husband laughed. “She will change when she knows you are rich,” he said. “Don’t be surprised. It is the way of the world.” He had scarcely finished when Mrs. Briggs entered, followed by Randolph. She remarked Gilbert’s presence with displeasure. “You here?” she said. “Yes, my dear,” said Mr. Briggs, pleasantly. “Gilbert has been keeping me company.” “He came on business, I suppose,” sneered the lady. “You are right, my dear. What made you guess his errand?” “I supposed he wanted help,” said Mrs. Briggs. “He wants his pension restored, of course.” 345“Is that what you came for, Gilbert?” asked Randolph, uncomfortably. Gilbert rather enjoyed the misapprehension of his two enemies, but he left Mr. Briggs to answer. “Really, my dear, you are hardly polite to my young ward.” “Your ward! Don’t be ridiculous, Mr. Briggs. You know he hasn’t got a cent, and has to live on charity.” “You are quite mistaken, my dear. Gilbert has just come into a property of over eighty thousand dollars. And he has asked me to take charge of it for him.” Mrs. Briggs sank into a chair in utter stupefaction, while Randolph opened his eyes in astonishment. “You are jesting!” Mrs. Briggs managed to utter. “Not at all. Is what I say correct, Gilbert?” “I believe it is, sir.” It is singular how Gilbert was transformed all at once in the eyes of the worldly woman, and her son. 346Circumstances were changed, and they must change with them. It was awkward, but it must be done. “I congratulate you, Gilbert,” she said, trying to smile. “You are certainly very fortunate.” “I should say he was!” exclaimed Randolph. “I say, Gilbert, come and live with us, won’t you?” “I should really be glad to have my husband’s ward in my family,” said Mrs. Briggs, as graciously as possible. “Thank you,” said Gilbert; “but this has come upon me so suddenly, that I don’t know what arrangements I shall make.” “Who left you this fortune?” asked Mrs. Briggs, curiously. “We are not at liberty to go into particulars,” said Mr. Briggs; “but there is no doubt about it.” “If you will excuse me, Mr. Briggs, I will leave you now. I should like to tell my friends of my good fortune.” “Certainly. Come to my counting-room in the morning at ten. Some arrangements will need to be made.” 347“I will be on hand, sir.” “Dine with us to-morrow, Gilbert,” said Mrs. Briggs, graciously. “Randolph will be so glad of your company.” “Thank you.” Gilbert thought it due to his guardian to accept. He was wise enough to take the world as he found it, and return courtesy with courtesy. “What has happened, Gilbert?” exclaimed his room-mate, when, half an hour later, Gilbert broke into the room, his face full of excitement. “I am rich, Mr. Ingalls. I have become heir to eighty thousand dollars.” “Good gracious!” exclaimed Alphonso Jones, who was present. “I suppose you will go to live on Fifth Avenue among the swells.” “Not at present, Mr. Jones.” “I am very glad of your good luck, Gilbert,” said his room-mate, warmly. “You must tell me all about it by and by.” “I wish I had eighty thousand dollars,” said Alphonso. “Wouldn’t I be high-toned?” 348“Can’t one be high-toned without being rich, Mr. Jones?” asked Gilbert. Mr. Jones thought not; but he made one mental reservation. He privately thought himself high-toned, though he certainly was not rich.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1888/54519.html","bookId":793,"book":{"id":793,"title":"Shifting For Himself","description":"简介： Shifting for Himself records the experiences of a boy who, in the course of a preparation for college, suddenly finds himself reduced to poverty.
