Sometimes itâ€™s where you find Mr. Random shacked up and sprawled out on what was supposed to be your new bed. \n Between the bear spray and the handcuffs, she discovers a terrible mistake has been made. \n Lochlan hasn\u0027t broken into her new home to sleep with a seedy barmaid...he owns half. \n With emotions running on high, Erin is determined to tough it out until a solution can be found. \n The tight quarters seem smaller with his accumulated clutter and bizarre sleeping schedule. It also doesn\u0027t help that he\u0027s the new lead singer for Thin Ice, an indie band on its rise to fame. \n What happens when a quiet bookworm gets stuck with a relentless rocker? \n What happens when the things you see are not the things you get?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/my-side.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":42,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
