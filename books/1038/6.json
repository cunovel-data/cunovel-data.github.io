{"id":34336,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V","content":"Over the Top \\n\\n Was it only yesterday \\n\\n Lusty comrades marched away? \\n\\n Now they\u0027re covered up with clay. \\n\\n Hearty comrades these have been, \\n\\n But no more will they be seen \\n\\n Drinking wine at Nouex-les-Mines. \\n\\n \\n\\n A brazier glowed on the floor of the trench and I saw fantastic figures in the red blaze; the interior of a vast church lit up with a myriad candles, and dark figures kneeling in prayer in front of their plaster saints. The edifice was an enchanted Fairyland, a poem of striking contrasts in light and shade. I peered over the top. The air blazed with star-shells, and Loos in front stood out like a splendid dawn. A row of impassive faces, sleep-heavy they looked, lined our parapet; bayonets, silver-spired, stood up over the sandbags; the dark bays, the recessed dug-outs with their khaki-clad occupants dimly defined in the light of little candles took on fantastic shapes. \\n\\n \\n\\n From the North Sea to the Alps stretched[67] a line of men who could, if they so desired, clasp one another\u0027s hands all the way along. A joke which makes men laugh at Ypres at dawn may be told on sentry-go at Souchez by dusk, and the laugh which accompanies it ripples through the long, deep trenches of Cuinchy, the breastworks of Richebourg and the chalk alleys of Vermelles until it breaks itself like a summer wave against the traverse where England ends and France begins. \\n\\n \\n\\n Many of our men were asleep, and maybe dreaming. What were their dreams?... I could hear faint, indescribable rustlings as the winds loitered across the levels in front; a light shrapnel shell burst, and its smoke quivered in the radiant light of the star-shells. Showers and sparks fell from high up and died away as they fell. Like lives of men, I thought, and again that feeling of proximity to the enemy surged through me. \\n\\n \\n\\n A boy came along the trench carrying a football under his arm. \"What are you going to do with that?\" I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s some idea, this,\" he said with a laugh. \"We\u0027re going to kick it across into the German trench.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is some idea,\" I said. \"What are our chances of victory in the game?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The playing will tell,\" he answered enigmatically. \"It\u0027s about four o\u0027clock now,\" he added, paused and became thoughtful.[68] The mention of the hour suggested something to him.... \\n\\n \\n\\n I could now hear the scattered crackling of guns as they called to one another saying: \"It\u0027s time to be up and doing!\" The brazen monsters of many a secret emplacement were registering their range, rivalry in their voices. For a little the cock-crowing of artillery went on, then suddenly a thousand roosts became alive and voluble, each losing its own particular sound as all united in one grand concert of fury. The orchestra of war swelled in an incessant fanfare of dizzy harmony. Floating, stuttering, whistling, screaming and thundering the clamorous voices belched into a rich gamut of passion which shook the grey heavens. The sharp, zigzagging sounds of high velocity shells cut through the pandemonium like forked lightning, and far away, as it seemed, sounding like a distant breakwater the big missiles from caterpillar howitzers lumbered through the higher deeps of the sky. The brazen lips of death cajoled, threatened, whispered, whistled, laughed and sung: here were the sinister and sullen voices of destruction, the sublime and stupendous p?an of power intermixed in sonorous clamour and magnificent vibration. \\n\\n \\n\\n Felan came out into the trench. He had been asleep in his dug-out. \"I can\u0027t make tea now,\" he said, fumbling with his mess-tin.[69] \"We\u0027ll soon have to get over the top. Murdagh, Nobby Byrne and Corporal Clancy are here,\" he remarked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are in hospital,\" I said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They were,\" said Felan; \"but the hospitals have been cleared out to make room for men wounded in the charge. The three boys were ordered to go further back to be out of the way, but they asked to be allowed to join in the charge, and they are here now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He paused for a moment. \"Good luck to you, Pat,\" he said with a strange catch in his voice. \"I hope you get through all right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A heavy rifle fire was opened by the Germans and the bullets snapped viciously at our sandbags. Such little things bullets seemed in the midst of all the pandemonium! But bigger stuff was coming. Twenty yards away a shell dropped on a dug-out and sandbags and occupants whirled up in mid-air. The call for stretcher-bearers came to my bay, and I rushed round the traverse towards the spot where help was required accompanied by two others. A shrapnel shell burst overhead and the man in front of me fell. I bent to lift him, but he stumbled to his feet. The concussion had knocked him down; he was little the worse for his accident, but he felt a bit shaken. The other stretcher-bearer was bleeding at the cheek and temple, and[70] I took him back to a sound dug-out and dressed his wound. He was in great pain, but very brave, and when another stricken boy came in he set about dressing him. I went outside into the trench. A perfect hurricane of shells was coming across, concussion shells that whirled the sandbags broadcast and shrapnel that burst high in air and shot their freight to earth with resistless precipitancy; bombs whirled in air and burst when they found earth with an ear-splitting clatter. \"Out in the open!\" I muttered and tried not to think too clearly of what would happen when we got out there. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was now grey day, hazy and moist, and the thick clouds of pale yellow smoke curled high in space and curtained the dawn off from the scene of war. The word was passed along. \"London Irish lead on to assembly trench.\" The assembly trench was in front, and there the scaling ladders were placed against the parapet, ready steps to death, as someone remarked. I had a view of the men swarming up the ladders when I got there, their bayonets held in steady hands, and at a little distance off a football swinging by its whang from a bayonet standard. \\n\\n \\n\\n The company were soon out in the open marching forward. The enemy\u0027s guns were busy, and the rifle and maxim bullets ripped[71] the sandbags. The infantry fire was wild but of slight intensity. The enemy could not see the attacking party. But, judging by the row, it was hard to think that men could weather the leaden storm in the open. \\n\\n \\n\\n The big guns were not so vehement now, our artillery had no doubt played havoc with the hostile batteries.... I went to the foot of a ladder and got hold of a rung. A soldier in front was clambering across. Suddenly he dropped backwards and bore me to the ground; the bullet caught him in the forehead. I got to my feet to find a stranger in grey uniform coming down the ladder. He reached the floor of the trench, put up his hands when I looked at him and cried in a weak, imploring voice, \"Kamerad! Kamerad!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A German!\" I said to my mate. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m! h\u0027m!\" he answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n I flung my stretcher over the parapet, and, followed by my comrade stretcher-bearer, I clambered up the ladder and went over the top. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52814.html","bookId":1038,"book":{"id":1038,"title":"The Great Push","description":"简介： The justice of the cause which endeavours to achieve its object by the murdering and maiming of mankind is apt to be doubted by a man who has come through a bayonet charge.
