{"id":34332,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I","content":"In the Advance Trenches \n Now when we take the cobbled road \n We often took before, \n Our thoughts are with the hearty lads \n Who tread that way no more. \n Oh! boys upon the level fields, \n If you could call to mind \n The wine of Café Pierre le Blanc \n You wouldn\u0027t stay behind. \n But when we leave the trench at night, \n And stagger neath our load, \n Grey, silent ghosts as light as air \n Come with us down the road. \n And when we sit us down to drink \n You sit beside us too, \n And drink at Café Pierre le Blanc \n As once you used to do. \n \n The Company marched from the village of Les Brebis at nightfall; the moon, waning a little at one of its corners, shone brightly amidst the stars in the east, and under it, behind the German lines, a burning mine threw a flame, salmon pink[12] and wreathed in smoke, into the air. Our Company was sadly thinned now, it had cast off many—so many of its men at Cuinchy, Givenchy, and Vermelles. At each of these places there are graves of the London Irish boys who have been killed in action. \n \n We marched through a world of slag heaps and chimney stacks, the moonlight flowing down the sides of the former like mist, the smoke stood up from the latter straight as the chimneys themselves. The whirr of machinery in the mine could be heard, and the creaking wagon wheels on an adjoining railway spoke out in a low, monotonous clank the half strangled message of labour. \n \n Our way lay up a hill, at the top we came into full view of the night of battle, the bursting shells up by Souchez, the flash of rifles by the village of Vermelles, the long white searchlights near Lens, and the star-shells, red, green and electric-white, rioting in a splendid blaze of colour over the decay, death and pity of the firing line. We could hear the dull thud of shells bursting in the fields and the sharp explosion they made amidst the masonry of deserted homes; you feel glad that the homes are deserted, and you hope that if any soldiers are billeted there they are in the safe protection of the cellars. \n \n The road by which we marched was lined with houses all in various stages of collapse,[13] some with merely a few tiles shot out of the roofs, others levelled to the ground. Some of the buildings were still peopled; at one home a woman was putting up the shutters and we could see some children drinking coffee from little tin mugs inside near the door; the garret of the house was blown in, the rafters stuck up over the tiles like long, accusing fingers, charging all who passed by with the mischief which had happened. The cats were crooning love songs on the roofs, and stray dogs slunk from the roadway as we approached. In the villages, with the natives gone and the laughter dead, there are always to be found stray dogs and love-making cats. The cats raise their primordial, instinctive yowl in villages raked with artillery fire, and poor lone dogs often cry at night to the moon, and their plaint is full of longing. \n \n We marched down the reverse slope of the hill in silence. At the end of the road was the village; our firing trench fringed the outer row of houses. Two months before an impudent red chimney stack stood high in air here; but humbled now, it had fallen upon itself, and its own bricks lay still as sandbags at its base, a forgotten ghost with blurred outlines, it brooded, a stricken giant. \n \n The long road down the hill was a tedious, deceptive way; it took a deal of marching to[14] make the village. Bill Teake growled. \"One would think the place was tied to a string,\" he grumbled, \"and some one pullin\u0027 it away!\" \n \n We were going to dig a sap out from the front trench towards the German lines; we drew our spades and shovels for the work from the Engineers\u0027 store at the rear and made our way into the labyrinth of trenches. Men were at their posts on the fire positions, their Balaclava helmets resting on their ears, their bayonets gleaming bright in the moonshine, their hands close to their rifle barrels. Sleepers lay stretched out on the banquette with their overcoats over their heads and bodies. Out on the front the Engineers had already taped out the night\u0027s work; our battalion had to dig some two hundred and fifty yards of trench 3 ft. wide and 6 ft. deep before dawn, and the work had to be performed with all possible dispatch. Rumour spoke of thrilling days ahead; and men spoke of a big push which was shortly to take place. Between the lines there are no slackers; the safety of a man so often depends upon the dexterous handling of his spade; the deeper a man digs, the better is his shelter from bullet and bomb; the spade is the key to safety. \n \n The men set to work eagerly, one picked up the earth with a spade and a mate shovelled the loose stuff out over the meadow. The grass, very long now and tapering tall as the[15] props that held the web of wire entanglements in air, shook gently backwards and forwards as the slight breezes caught it. The night was wonderfully calm and peaceful; it seemed as if heaven and earth held no threat for the men who delved in the alleys of war. \n \n Out ahead lay the German trenches. I could discern their line of sandbags winding over the meadows and losing itself for a moment when it disappeared behind the ruins of a farm-house—a favourite resort of the enemy snipers, until our artillery blew the place to atoms. Silent and full of mystery as it lay there in the moonlight, the place had a strange fascination for me. How interesting it would be to go out there beyond our most advanced outpost and have a peep at the place all by myself. Being a stretcher-bearer there was no necessity for me to dig; my work began when my mates ceased their labours and fell wounded. \n \n Out in front of me lay a line of barbed wire entanglements. \n \n \"Our wire?\" I asked the Engineer. \n \n \"No—the Germans\u0027,\" he answered. \n \n I noticed a path through it, and I took my way to the other side. Behind me I could heard the thud of picks and the sharp, rasping sound of shovels digging into the earth, and now and again the whispered words of command passing from lip to lip. The long[16] grass impeded my movements, tripping me as I walked, and lurking shell-holes caught me twice by the foot and flung me to the ground. Twenty yards out from the wire I noticed in front of me something moving on the ground, wriggling, as I thought, towards the enemy\u0027s line. I threw myself flat and watched. There was no mistaking it now; it was a man, belly flat on the ground, moving off from our lines. Being a non-combatant I had no rifle, no weapon to defend myself with if attacked. I wriggled back a few yards, then got to my feet, recrossed the line of wires and found a company-sergeant-major speaking to an officer. \n \n \"There\u0027s somebody out there lying on the ground,\" I said. \"A man moving off towards the German trenches.\" \n \n The three of us went off together and approached the figure on the ground, which had hardly changed its position since I last saw it. It was dressed in khaki, the dark barrel of a rifle stretched out in front. I saw stripes on a khaki sleeve.... \n \n \"One of a covering-party?\" asked the sergeant-major. \n \n \"That\u0027s right,\" came the answer from the grass, and a white face looked up at us. \n \n \"Quiet?\" asked the S.-M. \n \n \"Nothing doing,\" said the voice from the[17] ground. \"It\u0027s cold lying here, though. We\u0027ve been out for four hours.\" \n \n \"I did not think that the covering-party was so far out,\" said the officer, and the two men returned to their company. \n \n I sat in the long grass with the watcher; he was the sergeant in command of the covering party. \n \n \"Are your party out digging?\" he asked. \n \n \"Yes, out behind us,\" I answered. \"Is the covering-party a large one?\" \n \n \"About fifty of us,\" said the sergeant. \"They\u0027ve all got orders to shoot on sight when they see anything suspicious. Do you hear the Germans at work out there?\" \n \n I listened; from the right front came the sound of hammering. \n \n \"They\u0027re putting up barbed wire entanglements and digging a sap,\" said the sergeant. \"Both sides are working and none are fighting. I must have another smoke,\" said the sergeant. \n \n \"But it\u0027s dangerous to strike a light here,\" I said. \n \n \"Not in this way,\" said the sergeant, drawing a cigarette and a patent flint tinder-lighter from his pocket. Over a hole newly dug in the earth, as if with a bayonet, the sergeant leant, lit the cigarette in its little dug-out, hiding the glow with his hand. \n \n \"Do you smoke?\" he asked. \n \n [18] \n \n \"Yes, I smoke,\" and the man gave me a cigarette. \n \n It was so very quiet lying there. The grasses nodded together, whispering to one another. To speak of the grasses whispering during the day is merely a sweet idea; but God! they do whisper at night. The ancients called the winds the Unseen Multitude; the grasses are long, tapering fingers laid on the lips of the winds. \"Hush!\" the night whispers. \"Hush!\" breathes the world. The grasses touch your ears, saying sleepily, \"Hush! be quiet!\" \n \n At the end of half an hour I ventured to go nearer the German lines. The sergeant told me to be careful and not to go too close to the enemy\u0027s trenches or working parties. \"And mind your own covering-party when you\u0027re coming in,\" said the sergeant. \"They may slip you a bullet or two if you\u0027re unlucky.\" \n \n Absurd silvery shadows chased one another up and down the entanglement props. In front, behind the German lines, I could hear sounds of railway wagons being shunted, and the clank of rails being unloaded. The enemy\u0027s transports were busy; they clattered along the roads, and now and again the neighing of horses came to my ears. On my right a working party was out; the clank of hammers filled the air. The Germans were strengthening their wire entanglements;[19] the barbs stuck out, I could see them in front of me, waiting to rip our men if ever we dared to charge. I had a feeling of horror for a moment. Then, having one more look round, I went back, got through the line of outposts, and came up to our working party, which was deep in the earth already. Shovels and picks were rising and falling, and long lines of black clay bulked up on either side of the trench. \n \n I took off my coat, got hold of a mate\u0027s idle shovel, and began to work. \n \n \"That my shovel?\" said Bill Teake. \n \n \"Yes, I\u0027m going to do a little,\" I answered. \"It would never do much lying on the slope.\" \n \n \"I suppose it wouldn\u0027t,\" he answered. \"Will you keep it goin\u0027 for a spell?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll do a little bit with it,\" I answered. \"You\u0027ve got to go to the back of the trenches if you\u0027re wanting to smoke.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s where I\u0027m goin\u0027,\" Bill replied. \"\u0027Ave yer got any matches?\" \n \n I handed him a box and bent to my work. It was quite easy to make headway; the clay was crisp and brittle, and the pick went in easily, making very little sound. M\u0027Crone, one of our section, was working three paces ahead, shattering a square foot of earth at every blow of his instrument. \n \n \"It\u0027s very quiet here,\" he said. \"I suppose[20] they won\u0027t fire on us, having their own party out. By Jove, I\u0027m sweating at this.\" \n \n \"When does the shift come to an end?\" I asked. \n \n \"At dawn,\" came the reply. He rubbed the perspiration from his brow as he spoke. \"The nights are growing longer,\" he said, \"and it will soon be winter again. It will be cold then.\" \n \n As he spoke we heard the sound of rifle firing out by the German wires. Half a dozen shots were fired, then followed a long moment of silent suspense. \n \n \"There\u0027s something doing,\" said Pryor, leaning on his pick. \"I wonder what it is.\" \n \n Five minutes afterwards a sergeant and two men came in from listening patrol and reported to our officer. \n \n \"We\u0027ve just encountered a strong German patrol between the lines,\" said the sergeant. \"We exchanged shots with them and then withdrew. We have no casualties, but the Germans have one man out of action, shot through the stomach.\" \n \n \"How do you know it went through his stomach?\" asked the officer. \n \n \"In this way,\" said the sergeant. \"When we fired one of the Germans (we were quite close to them) put his hands across his stomach and fell to the ground yellin\u0027 \u0027Mein Gutt! Mein Gutt!\u0027\" \n \n [21] \n \n \"So it did get \u0027im in the guts then,\" said Bill Teake, when he heard of the incident. \n \n \"You fool!\" exclaimed Pryor. \"It was \u0027My God\u0027 that the German said.\" \n \n \"But Pat \u0027as just told me that the German said \u0027Mine Gut,\u0027\" Bill protested. \n \n \"Well, \u0027Mein Gott\u0027 (the Germans pronounce \u0027Gott\u0027 like \u0027Gutt\u0027 on a dark night) is the same as \u0027My God,\u0027\" said Pryor. \n \n \"Well, any\u0027ow, that\u0027s just wot the Allymongs would say,\" Bill muttered. \"It\u0027s just like them to call God Almighty nick names.\" \n \n When dawn showed pale yellow in a cold sky, and stars were fading in the west, we packed up and took our way out and marched back to Nouex-les-Mines, there to rest for a day or two. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52810.html","bookId":1038,"book":{"id":1038,"title":"The Great Push","description":"简介： The justice of the cause which endeavours to achieve its object by the murdering and maiming of mankind is apt to be doubted by a man who has come through a bayonet charge.
