{"id":34351,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XX","content":"For Blighty \n \n \"The villa dwellers have become cave-dwellers.\"—Dudley Pryor. \n \n The night was intensely dark, and from the door of the dug-out I could scarcely see the outline of the sentry who stood on the banquette fifteen yards away. Standing on tiptoe I could glance over the parapet, and when a star-shell went up I could trace the outline of a ruined mill that stood up, gaunt and forbidding, two hundred yards away from our front line trench. On the left a line of shrapnel-swept trees stood in air, leafless and motionless. Now and again a sniper\u0027s bullet hit the sandbags with a crack like a whip. \n \n Lifeless bodies still lay in the trench; the blood of the wounded whom I had helped to carry down to the dressing-station was still moist on my tunic and trousers. In a stretch of eight hundred yards there was only one dug-out, a shaky construction, cramped and leaky, that might fall in at any moment. \n \n [240] \n \n \"Would it be wise to light a fire?\" asked Dilly, my mate, who was lying on the earthen floor of the dug-out. \"I want a drop of tea. I didn\u0027t have a sup of tea all day.\" \n \n \"The officers won\u0027t allow us to light a fire,\" I said. \"But if we hang a ground-sheet over the door the light won\u0027t get through. Is there a brazier?\" I asked. \n \n \"Yes, there\u0027s one here,\" said Dilly. \"I was just going to use it for a pillow, I feel so sleepy.\" \n \n He placed a ground-sheet over the door while speaking and I took a candle from my pocket, lit it and placed it in a little niche in the wall. Then we split some wood with a clasp-knife, placed it on a brazier and lit a fire over which we placed a mess-tin of water. \n \n The candle flickered fitfully, and dark shadows lurked in the corners of the dug-out. A mouse peeped down from between the sandbags on the roof, its bright little eyes glowing with mischief. The ground-sheet hanging over the door was caught by a breeze and strange ripples played across it. We could hear from outside the snap of rifle bullets on the parapet.... \n \n \"It\u0027s very quiet in here,\" said Dilly. \"And I feel so like sleep. I hope none get hit to-night. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d be able to help with a stretcher down to the dressing-station[241] until I have a few hours\u0027 sleep.... How many wounded did we carry out to-day? Nine?\" \n \n \"Nine or ten,\" I said. \n \n \"Sharney was badly hit,\" Dilly said. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll pull through.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s hard to say,\" I remarked, fanning the fire with a newspaper. \"Felan, the cook, who was wounded in the charge a month ago, got a bullet in his shoulder. It came out through his back. I dressed his wound. It was ghastly. The bullet pierced his lung, and every time he breathed some of the air from the lung came out through his back. I prophesied that he would live for four or five hours. I had a letter from him the other day. He\u0027s in a London hospital and is able to walk about again. He was reported dead, too, in the casualty list.\" \n \n \"Some people pluck up wonderfully,\" said Dilly. \"Is the tea ready?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s ready,\" I said. \n \n We sat down together, rubbing our eyes, for the smoke got into them, and opened a tin of bully beef. The beef with a few biscuits and a mess-tin of warm tea formed an excellent repast. When we had finished eating we lit our cigarettes. \n \n \"Have you got any iodine?\" Dilly suddenly inquired. \n \n [242] \n \n \"None,\" I answered. \"Have you?\" \n \n \"I got my pocket hit by a bullet coming up here,\" Dilly answered. \"My bottle got smashed.\" \n \n Iodine is so necessary when dressing wounds. Somebody might get hit during the night.... \n \n \"I\u0027ll go to the dressing-station and get some,\" I said to Dilly. \"You can have a sleep.\" \n \n I put my coat on and went out, clambered up the rain-sodden parados and got out into the open where a shell-hole yawned at every step, and where the dead lay unburied. A thin mist lay low, and solitary trees stood up from a sea of milk, aloof, immobile. The sharp, penetrating stench of wasting flesh filled the air. \n \n I suddenly came across two lone figures digging a hole in the ground. I stood still for a moment and watched them. One worked with a pick, the other with a shovel, and both men panted as they toiled. When a star-shell went up they threw themselves flat to earth and rose to resume their labours as the light died away. \n \n Three stiff and rigid bundles wrapped in khaki lay on the ground near the diggers, and, having dug the hole deep and wide, the diggers turned to the bundles; tied a string round each in turn, pulled them forward and[243] shoved them into the hole. Thus were three soldiers buried. \n \n I stopped for a moment beside the grave. \n \n \"Hard at work, boys?\" I said. \n \n \"Getting a few of them under,\" said one of the diggers. \"By God, it makes one sweat, this work. Have you seen a dog about at all?\" was the man\u0027s sudden inquiry. \n \n \"No,\" I answered. \"I\u0027ve heard about that dog. Is he not supposed to be a German in disguise?\" \n \n \"He\u0027s old Nick in disguise,\" said the digger. \"He feeds on the dead, the dirty swine. I don\u0027t like it all. Look! there\u0027s the dog again.\" \n \n Something long, black and ghostly took shape in the mist ten yards away and stood there for a moment as if inspecting us. A strange thrill ran through my body. \n \n \"That\u0027s it again,\" said the nearest digger. \"I\u0027ve seen it three times to-night; once at dusk down by Loos graveyard among the tombstones, again eating a dead body, and now—some say it\u0027s a ghost.\" \n \n I glanced at the man, then back again at the spot where the dog had been. But now the animal was gone. \n \n An air of loneliness pervaded the whole place, the sounds of soft rustling swept along the ground: I could hear a twig snap, a man cough, and in the midst of all the little noises[244] which merely accentuated the silence, it suddenly rose long-drawn and eerie, the howl of a lonely dog. \n \n \"The dirty swine,\" said the digger. \"I wish somebody shot it.\" \n \n \"No one could shoot the animal,\" said the other worker. \"It\u0027s not a dog; it\u0027s the devil himself.\" \n \n My way took me past Loos church and churchyard; the former almost levelled to the ground, the latter delved by shells and the bones of the dead villagers flung broadcast to the winds of heaven. I looked at the graveyard and the white headstones. Here I saw the dog again. The silver light of a star-shell shot aslant a crumpled wall and enabled me to see a long black figure, noiseless as the shadow of a cloud, slink past the little stone crosses and disappear. Again a howl, lonely and weird, thrilled through the air. \n \n I walked down the main street of Loos where dead mules lay silent between the shafts of their limbers. It was here that I saw Gilhooley die, Gilhooley the master bomber, Gilhooley the Irishman. \n \n \"Those damned snipers are in thim houses up the street,\" he said, fingering a bomb lovingly. \"But, by Jasus, we\u0027ll get them out of it.\" Then he was shot. This happened a month ago. \n \n In the darkness the ruined houses assumed[245] fantastic shapes, the fragment of a standing wall became a gargoyle, a demon, a monstrous animal. A hunchback leered down at me from a roof as I passed, his hump in air, his head thrust forward on knees that rose to his face. Further along a block of masonry became a gigantic woman who was stepping across the summit of a mountain, her shawl drawn over her head and a pitcher on her shoulder. \n \n In the midst of the ruin and desolation of the night of morbid fancies, in the centre of a square lined with unpeopled houses, I came across the Image of Supreme Pain, the Agony of the Cross. What suffering has Loos known? What torture, what sorrow, what agony? The crucifix was well in keeping with this scene of desolation. \n \n Old Mac of the R.A.M.C. was sitting on a blanket on the floor of the dressing-station when I entered. Mac is a fine singer and a hearty fellow; he is a great friend of mine. \n \n \"What do you want now?\" he asked. \n \n \"A drop of rum, if you have any to spare,\" I answered. \n \n \"You\u0027re a devil for your booze,\" Mac said, taking the cork out of a water bottle which he often uses for an illegitimate purpose. \"There\u0027s a wee drappie goin\u0027, man.\" \n \n I drank. \n \n \"Not bad, a wee drappie,\" said Mac.[246] \"Ay, mon! it\u0027s health tae the navel and marrow to the bones.\" \n \n \"Are all the others in bed?\" I asked. Several hands work at the dressing-station, but Mac was the only one there now. \n \n \"They\u0027re having a wee bit kip down in the cellar,\" said Mac. \"I\u0027ll get down there if you clear out.\" \n \n \"Give me some iodine, and I\u0027ll go,\" I said. \n \n He filled a bottle, handed it to me, and I went out again to the street. A slight artillery row was in progress now, our gunners were shelling the enemy\u0027s trenches and the enemy were at work battering in our parapets. \n \n A few high explosives were bursting at the Twin Towers of Loos and light splinters were singing through the air. Bullets were whizzing down the street and snapping at the houses. I lit a cigarette and smoked, concealing the glowing end under my curved fingers. \n \n Something suddenly seemed to sting my wrist and a sharp pain shot up my arm. I raised my hand and saw a dark liquid dripping down my palm on to my fingers. \n \n \"I wonder if this will get me back to England,\" I muttered, and turned back to the dressing-station. \n \n Mac had not gone down to the cellar; the water bottle was still uncorked. \n \n [247] \n \n \"Back again?\" he inquired. \n \n \"It looks like it,\" I replied. \n \n \"You\u0027re bleeding, Pat,\" he exclaimed, seeing the blood on my hand. \"Strafed, you bounder, you\u0027re strafed.\" \n \n He examined my wound and dressed it. \n \n \"Lucky dog,\" he said, handing me the water bottle. \"You\u0027re for blighty, man, for blighty. I wish to God I was! Is it raining now?\" he asked. \n \n \"It is just starting to come down,\" I said. \"How am I to get out of this?\" I inquired. \n \n \"There\u0027ll be an ambulance up here in a wee,\" Mac said, then he laughed. \"Suppose it gets blown to blazes,\" he said. \n \n \"It\u0027s a quiet night,\" I remarked, but I was seized with a certain nervousness. \"God! it would be awkward if I really got strafed now, on the way home.\" \n \n \"It often happens, man,\" said Mac, \"and we are going to open all our guns on the enemy at two o\u0027clock. They\u0027re mobilizing for an attack, it\u0027s said.\" \n \n \"At two o\u0027clock,\" I repeated. \"It\u0027s a quarter to two now. And it\u0027s very quiet.\" \n \n \"It\u0027ll not be quiet in a minute,\" said my friend. \n \n I had a vivid impression. In my mind I saw the Germans coming up to their trench through the darkness, the rain splashing on their rifles and equipment, their forms bent[248] under the weight which they carried. No doubt they had little bundles of firewood with them to cook their breakfasts at dawn. They were now thanking God that the night was quiet, that they could get into the comparative shelter of the trenches in safety. Long lines of men in grey, keeping close to the shelter of spinneys sunk in shadow; transport wagons rumbling and jolting, drivers unloading at the \"dumps,\" ration parties crossing the open with burdens of eatables; men thinking of home and those they loved as they sat in their leaky dug-outs, scrawling letters by the light of their guttering candles. This was the life that went on in and behind the German lines in the darkness and rain. \n \n Presently hell would burst open and a million guns would bellow of hatred and terror. I supposed the dead on the fields would be torn and ripped anew, and the shuddering quick out on the open where no discretion could preserve them and no understanding keep them, would plod nervously onward, fear in their souls and terror in their faces. \n \n Our own men in the trenches would hear the guns and swear at the gunners. The enemy would reply by shelling the trench in which our boys were placed. The infantry always suffers when Mars riots. All our[249] guns would open fire.... It would be interesting to hear them speak.... I would remain here while the cannonade was on.... It would be safer and wiser to go than stay, but I would stay. \n \n \"Is there another ambulance besides the one due in a minute or two coming up before dawn, Mac?\" I asked. \n \n \"Another at four o\u0027clock,\" Mac announced sleepily. He lay on the floor wrapped in his blanket and was just dozing off. \n \n \"I\u0027m finished with war for a few weeks at least,\" I muttered. \"I\u0027m pleased. I hope I get to England. Another casualty from Loos. The dead are lying all round here; civilians and soldiers. A dead child lying in a trench near Hulluch. I suppose somebody has buried it. I wonder how it got there.... The line of wounded stretches from Lens to Victoria Station on this side, and from Lens to Berlin on the other side.... How many thousand dead are there in the fields round there?... There will be many more, for the battle of Loos is still proceeding.... Who is going to benefit by the carnage, save the rats which feed now as they have never fed before?... What has brought about this turmoil, this tragedy that cuts the heart of friend and foe alike?... Why have millions of men come here from all corners of Europe to hack and slay one[250] another? What mysterious impulse guided them to this maiming, murdering, gouging, gassing, and filled them with such hatred? Why do we use the years of peace in preparation for war? Why do men well over the military age hate the Germans more than the younger and more sober souls in the trenches? Who has profited by this carnage? Who will profit? Why have some men joined in the war for freedom?\" \n \n Suddenly I was overcome with a fit of laughter, and old Mac woke up. \n \n \"What the devil are you kicking up such a row for?\" he grumbled. \n \n \"Do you remember B——, the fellow whose wound you dressed one night a week ago? Bald as a trout, double chin and a shrapnel wound in his leg. He belonged to the —— Regiment.\" \n \n \"I remember him,\" said Mac. \n \n \"I knew him in civil life,\" I said. \"He kept a house of some repute in ——. The sons of the rich came there secretly at night; the poor couldn\u0027t afford to. Do you believe that B—— joined the Army in order to redress the wrongs of violated Belgium?\" \n \n Mac sat up on the floor, his Balaclava helmet pulled down over his ears, and winked at me. \n \n \"Ye\u0027re drunk, ye bounder, ye\u0027re drunk,\" he said. \"Just like all the rest, mon. We\u0027ll have no teetotallers after the war.\" \n \n [251] \n \n He lay down again. \n \n \"I know a man who was out here for nine months and he never tasted drink,\" I said. \n \n Mac sat up again, an incredulous look on his face. \n \n \"Who was he?\" he asked. \n \n \"The corporal of our section,\" I replied. \n \n \"Well, that\u0027s the first I\u0027ve heard o\u0027,\" said Mac. \"He\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t he?\" \n \n \"Got killed in the charge,\" I answered. \"I saw him coming back wounded, crawling along with his head to the ground like a dog scenting the trail.\" \n \n Sleep was heavy in my eyes and queer thoughts ran riot in my head. \"What is to be the end of this destruction and decay? That is what it means, this war. Destruction, decay, degradation. We who are here know its degradation; we, the villa dwellers, who have become cave dwellers and make battle with club and knobkerry; the world knows of the destruction and decay of war. Man will recognise its futility before he recognises its immorality.... Lines of men marching up long, poplar-lined roads to-day; to-morrow the world grows sick with their decay.... They are now one with Him.... Yes, there He is, hanging on the barbed wires. I shall go and speak to Him....\" \n \n The dawn blushed in the east and grew redder and redder like a curtain of blood—and[252] from Souchez to Ypres the poppy fields were of the same red colour, a plain of blood. For miles and miles the barbed wire entanglements wound circuitously through the levels, brilliant with star-clusters of dew-drops hung from spike, barb and intricate traceries of gossamer. Out in front of my bay gleamed the Pleiades which had dropped from heaven during the night and clustered round a dark grey bulk of clothing by one of the entanglement props. I knew the dark grey bulk, it was He; for days and nights He had hung there, a huddled heap; the Futility of War. \n \n I was with Him in a moment endeavouring to help Him. In the dawn He was not repulsive, He was almost beautiful, but His beauty was that of the mirage which allures to a more sure destruction. The dew-drops were bright on His beard, His hair and His raiment; but His head sank low upon the wires and I could not see His face. \n \n A dew-drop disappeared from the man\u0027s beard as I watched and then another. Round me the glory of the wires faded; the sun, coming out warm and strong, dispelled the illusion of the dawn; the galaxy faded, leaving but the rugged props, the ghastly wires and the rusty barbs nakedly showing in the poppy field. \n \n I saw now that He was repulsive, abject,[253] pitiful lying there, His face close to the wires, a thousand bullets in his head. Unable to resist the impulse I endeavoured to turn His face upward, but was unable; a barb had pierced His eye and stuck there, rusting in the socket from which sight was gone. I turned and ran away from the thing into the bay of the trench. The glory of the dawn had vanished, my soul no longer swooned in the ecstasy of it; the Pleiades had risen, sick of that which they decorated, the glorious disarray of jewelled dew-drops was no more, that which endured the full light of day was the naked and torturing contraption of war. Was not the dawn buoyant, like the dawn of patriotism? Were not the dew-decked wires war seen from far off? Was not He in wreath of Pleiades glorious death in action? But a ray of light more, and what is He and all with Him but the monstrous futility of war.... Mac tugged at my shoulder and I awoke. \n \n \"Has the shelling begun?\" I asked. \n \n \"It\u0027s over, mon,\" he said. \"It\u0027s four o\u0027clock now. You\u0027ll be goin\u0027 awa\u0027 from here in a minute or twa.\" \n \n \"And these wounded?\" I asked, looking round. Groaning and swearing they lay on their stretchers and in bloodstained blankets, their ghastly eyes fixed upon the roof. They had not been in when I fell asleep. \n \n [254] \n \n \"The enemy replied to our shellin\u0027,\" said Mac curtly. \n \n \"Ay, \u0027e replied,\" said a wounded man, turning on his stretcher. \"\u0027E replied. Gawd, \u0027e didn\u0027t arf send some stuff back! It was quiet enough before our blurry artillery started. They\u0027ve no damned consideration for the pore infantry.... Thank Gawd, I\u0027m out of the whole damn business.... I\u0027ll take damn good care that I....\" \n \n \"The ambulance car is here,\" said Mac. \"All who can walk, get outside.\" \n \n The rain was falling heavily as I entered the Red Cross wagon, 3008 Rifleman P. MacGill, passenger on the Highway of Pain, which stretched from Loos to Victoria Station. \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52829.html","bookId":1038,"book":{"id":1038,"title":"The Great Push","description":"简介： The justice of the cause which endeavours to achieve its object by the murdering and maiming of mankind is apt to be doubted by a man who has come through a bayonet charge.
