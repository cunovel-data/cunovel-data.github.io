{"id":34346,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XV","content":"A Lover at Loos The turrets twain that stood in air Sheltered a foeman sniper there; They found who fell to the sniper\u0027s aim, A field of death on the field of fame— And stiff in khaki the boys were laid, To the rifle\u0027s toll at the barricade; But the quick went clattering through the town, Shot at the sniper and brought him down, In the town of Loos in the morning. The night was wet, the rain dripped from the sandbags and lay in little pools on the floor of the trench. Snug in the shelter of its keep a machine gun lurked privily, waiting for blood. The weapon had an absolutely impersonal air; it had nothing to do with war and the maiming of men. Two men were asleep in the bay, sitting on the fire-step and snoring loudly. A third man leant over the parapet, his eyes (if they were open) fixed on the enemy\u0027s trench in front. Probably he was asleep; he stood fixed to his post motionless as a statue. I wrapped my overcoat tightly round my body and lay down in the slush by a[187] dug-out door. The dug-out, a German construction that burrowed deep in the chalky clay of Loos, was crowded with queer, distorted figures. It looked as if the dead on the field had been collected and shovelled into the place pell-mell. Bill Teake lay with his feet inside the shelter, his head and shoulders out in the rain. \"I couldn\u0027t get in nohow,\" he grumbled as I lay down; \"so I arst them inside to throw me a \u0027andful of fleas an\u0027 I\u0027d kip on the doorstep. Blimey! \u0027tain\u0027t arf a barney; mud feathers, and no blurry blanket. There\u0027s one thing certain, anyhow, that is, in the Army you\u0027re certain to receive what you get.\" I was asleep immediately, my head on Bill\u0027s breast, my body in the mud, my clothes sodden with rain. In the nights that followed Loos we slept anywhere and anyhow. Men lay in the mud in the trenches, in the fields, by the roadside, on sentry, and out on listening patrols between the lines. I was asleep for about five minutes when someone woke me up. I got to my feet, shivering with cold. \"What\u0027s up?\" I asked the soldier who had shaken me from my slumber. He was standing opposite, leaning against the parados and yawning. \"There\u0027s a bloke in the next dug-out as \u0027as got wounded,\" said the man. \"\u0027E needs[188] someone to dress \u0027is wound an\u0027 take \u0027im to the dressin\u0027-station. \u0027E \u0027as just crawled in from the fields.\" \"All right,\" I replied. \"I\u0027ll go along and see him.\" A stairway led down to the dug-out; an officer lay asleep at the entrance, and a lone cat lay curled up on the second step. At the bottom of the stair was a bundle of khaki, moaning feebly. \"Much hurt?\" I asked. \"Feelin\u0027 a bit rotten,\" replied a smothered voice. \"Where\u0027s your wound?\" \"On my left arm.\" \"What is your regiment?\" I asked, fumbling at the man\u0027s sleeve. \"The East Yorks,\" was the reply to my question. \"I was comin\u0027 up the trench that\u0027s piled with dead Germans. I couldn\u0027t crawl over them all the way, they smelt so bad. I got up and tried to walk; then a sniper got me.\" \"Where\u0027s your regiment?\" I asked. \"I don\u0027t know,\" was the answer. \"I got lost and I went lookin\u0027 for my mates. I came into a trench that was crowded with Germans.\" \"There\u0027s where you got hit,\" I said. \"No; they were Germans that wasn\u0027t dead,\" came the surprising reply. \"They were cooking food.\" [189] \"When was this?\" I asked. \"Yesterday, just as it was growin\u0027 dusk,\" said the wounded man in a weary voice. \"Then the Germans saw me and they began to shout and they caught hold of their rifles. I jumped over the trench and made off with bullets whizzin\u0027 all round me. I tripped and fell into a shell-hole and I lay there until it was very dark. Then I got into the English trenches. I \u0027ad a sleep till mornin\u0027, then I set off to look for my regiment.\" While he was speaking I had lit the candle which I always carried in my pocket and placed it on the floor of the dug-out. I examined his wound. A bullet had gone through the left forearm, cutting the artery and fracturing the bone; the blood was running down to his finger tips in little rivulets. I looked at the face of the patient. He was a mere boy, with thoughtful dark eyes, a snub nose, high cheekbones; a line of down showed on a long upper lip, and a fringe of innocent curling hairs straggled down his cheeks and curved round his chin. He had never used a razor. I bound up the wound, found a piece of bread in my pocket and gave it to him. He ate ravenously. \"Hungry?\" I said. \"As a \u0027awk,\" he answered. \"I didn\u0027t \u0027ave nothin\u0027 to-day and not much yesterday.\" [190] \"How long have you been out here?\" I asked. \"Only a week,\" he said. \"The regiment marched from —— to here. \u0027Twasn\u0027t \u0027arf a bloomin\u0027 sweat. We came up and got into action at once.\" \"You\u0027ll be going home with this wound,\" I said. \"Will I?\" he asked eagerly. \"Yes,\" I replied. \"A fracture of the forearm. It will keep you in England for six months. How do you like that?\" \"I\u0027ll be pleased,\" he said. \"Have you a mother?\" I asked. \"No, but I\u0027ve a girl.\" \"Oh!\" \"Not \u0027arf I aven\u0027t,\" said the youth. \"I\u0027ve only one, too. I don\u0027t \u0027old with foolin\u0027 about with women. One\u0027s enough to be gone on, and often one is one too many.\" \"Very sound reasoning,\" I remarked sleepily. I had sat down on the floor and was dozing off. The officer at the top of the stair stirred, shook himself and glanced down. \"Put out that light,\" he growled. \"It\u0027s showing out of the door. The Germans will see it and send a shell across.\" I put the candle out and stuck it in my pocket. [191] \"Are you in pain now?\" I asked the wounded boy. \"There\u0027s no pain now,\" was the answer. \"It went away when you put the dressing on.\" \"Then we\u0027ll get along to the dressing-station,\" I said, and we clambered up the stairs into the open trench. The sky, which was covered with dark grey clouds when I came in, had cleared in parts, and from time to time the moon appeared like a soft beautiful eye. The breezes held converse on the sandbags. I could hear the subdued whispering of their prolonged consultation. We walked along the peopled alley of war, where the quick stood on the banquettes, their bayonets reflecting the brilliance of the moon. When we should get as far as the trench where the dead Germans were lying we would venture into the open and take the high road to Maroc. \"So you\u0027ve got a girl,\" I said to my companion. \"I have,\" he answered. \"And she\u0027s not \u0027arf a one either. She\u0027s a servant in a gentleman\u0027s \u0027ouse at Y——. I was workin\u0027 for a baker and I used to drive the van. What d\u0027ye work at?\" \"I\u0027m a navvy,\" I said. \"I dig drains and things like that.\" [192] \"Not much class that sort of work,\" said the baker\u0027s boy. \"If you come to Y—— after the war I\u0027ll try and get yer a job at the baker\u0027s.... Well, I saw this \u0027ere girl at the big \u0027ouse and I took a fancy to \u0027er. Are yer much gone on girls? No, neither am I gone on any, only this one. She\u0027s a sweet thing. I\u0027d read you the last letter she sent me only it\u0027s too dark. Maybe I could read it if the moon comes out. Can you read a letter by the light of the moon? No.... Well, I took a fancy to the girl and she fell in love with me. \u0027Er name was Polly Pundy. What\u0027s your name?\" \"Socrates,\" I said. \"My name is plain Brown,\" the boy said. \"Jimmy Brown. My mates used to call me Tubby because I was stout. Have you got a nickname? No.... I don\u0027t like a nickname. Neither does Polly.\" \"How does your love affair progress?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s not all \u0027oney,\" said the youth, trying to evade a projecting sandbag that wanted to nudge his wounded arm. \"It makes one think. Somehow, I like that \u0027ere girl too well to be \u0027appy with \u0027er. She\u0027s too good for me, she is. I used to be jealous sometimes; I would strike a man as would look at \u0027er as quick as I\u0027d think of it. Sometimes when a young feller passed by and didn\u0027t[193] look at my Polly I\u0027d be angry too. \u0027Wasn\u0027t she good enough for \u0027im?\u0027 I\u0027d say to myself; usin\u0027 \u0027is eyes to look at somethin\u0027 else when Polly is about——\" \"We\u0027ll get over the top now,\" I said, interrupting Brown. We had come to the trench of the dead Germans. In front of us lay a dark lump coiled up in the trench; a hand stretched out towards us, a wan face looked up at the grey sky.... \"We\u0027ll speak of Polly Pundy out in the open.\" We crossed the sandbagged parados. The level lay in front—grey, solitary, formless. It was very quiet, and in the silence of the fields where the whirlwind of war had spent its fury a few days ago there was a sense of eternal loneliness and sadness. The grey calm night toned the moods of my soul into one of voiceless sorrow, containing no element of unrest. My mood was well in keeping with my surroundings. In the distance I could see the broken chimney of Maroc coal-mine standing forlorn in the air. Behind, the Twin Towers of Loos quivered, grimly spectral. \"We\u0027ll walk slowly, Brown,\" I said to the wounded boy. \"We\u0027ll fall over the dead if we\u0027re not careful.... Is Polly Pundy still in the gentleman\u0027s house?\" I asked. \"She\u0027s still there,\" said the boy. \"When we get married we\u0027re goin\u0027 to open a little shop.\" [194] \"A baker\u0027s shop?\" I asked. \"I s\u0027pose so. It\u0027s what I know more about than anythink else. D\u0027you know anything about baking.... Nothing? It\u0027s not a bad thing to turn your \u0027and to, take my tip for it.... Ugh! I almost fell over a dead bloke that time.... I\u0027m sleepy, aren\u0027t you?\" \"By God! I am sleepy, Jimmy Brown,\" I muttered. \"I\u0027ll try and find a cellar in Maroc when I get there and have a good sleep.\" The dressing-station in the ruined village was warm and comfortable. An R.A.M.C. orderly was busily engaged in making tea for the wounded who lay crowded in the cellar waiting until the motor ambulances came up. Some had waited for twenty-four hours. Two doctors were busy with the wounded, a German officer with an arm gone lay on a stretcher on the floor; a cat was asleep near the stove, I could hear it purring. Mick Garney, one of our boys, was lying on the stretcher near the stove. He was wounded in the upper part of the thigh, and was recounting his adventures in the charge. He had a queer puckered little face, high cheekbones, and a little black clay pipe, which he always carried inside his cap on parade and in his haversack on the march, that was of course when he was not carrying[195] it between his teeth with its bowl turned down. Going across in the charge, Micky observed some half a dozen Germans rushing out from a spinney near Hill 70, and placing a machine gun on the Vermelles-Hulluch road along which several kilted Highlanders were coming at the double. Garney took his pipe out of his mouth and looked on. They were daring fellows, those Germans, coming out into the open in the face of a charge and placing their gun in position. \"I must stop their game,\" said Mick. He lit his pipe, turned the bowl down, then lay on the damp earth and, using a dead German for a rifle-rest, he took careful aim. At the pull of the trigger, one of the Germans fell headlong, a second dropped and a third. The three who remained lugged the gun back into Loos churchyard and placed it behind a tombstone on which was the figure of two angels kneeling in front of \"The Sacred Heart.\" Accompanied by two bombers, Mick Garney found the Germans there. \"God forgive me!\" said Mick, recounting the incident to the M.O., \"I threw a bomb that blew the two angels clean off the tombstone.\" \"And the Germans?\" asked the M.O. \"Begorra! they went with the angels.\" ... A doctor, a pot-bellied man with a[196] kindly face and an innocent moustache, took off Brown\u0027s bandage and looked at me. \"How are things going on up there?\" he asked. \"As well as might be expected,\" I replied. \"You look worn out,\" said the doctor. \"I feel worn out,\" I answered. \"Is it a fact that the German Crown Prince has been captured?\" asked the doctor. \"Who?\" \"The German Crown Prince,\" said the man. \"A soldier who has just gone away from here vows that he saw Little Willie under escort in Loos.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s all bunkum,\" I replied. \"I suppose the man has had too much rum.\" The doctor laughed. \"Well, sit down and I\u0027ll see if I can get you a cup of tea,\" he said in a kindly voice, and at his word I sat down on the floor. I was conscious of nothing further until the following noon. I awoke to find myself in a cellar, wrapped in blankets and lying on a stretcher. I went upstairs and out into the street and found that I had been sleeping in the cellar of the house adjoining the dressing-station. I called to mind Jimmy Brown, his story of Polly Pundy; his tale of passion told on the field of death, his wound and his luck. A week in France only, and now going back[197] again to England, to Polly Pundy, servant in a gentleman\u0027s house. He was on his way home now probably, a wound in his arm and dreams of love in his head. You lucky devil, Jimmy Brown!... Anyhow, good fortune to you.... But meanwhile it was raining and I had to get back to the trenches.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52824.html","bookId":1038,"book":{"id":1038,"title":"The Great Push","description":"简介： The justice of the cause which endeavours to achieve its object by the murdering and maiming of mankind is apt to be doubted by a man who has come through a bayonet charge.
