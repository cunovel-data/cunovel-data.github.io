{"id":34338,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII","content":"Germans at Loos \"Some\u0027ow a dyin\u0027 Alleymong don\u0027t seem a real Alleymong; you ain\u0027t able to \u0027ate \u0027im as you ought.\"—Bill Teake\u0027s Philosophy. From the day I left England up till the dawn of September 25th I never met a German, and I had spent seven months in France. At night when out on working-parties I saw figures moving out by the enemy trenches, mere shadows that came into view when an ephemeral constellation of star-shells held the heavens. We never fired at these shadows, and they never fired at us; it is unwise to break the tacit truces of the trenches. The first real live German I saw was the one who blundered down the ladder into our trench, the second raced towards our trenches with Bill Teake following at his heels, uttering threats and vowing that he would stab the prisoner if he did not double in a manner approved of by the most exacting sergeant-major. [88] Of those who are England\u0027s enemies I know, even now, very little. I cannot well pass judgment on a nation through seeing distorted lumps of clotting and mangled flesh pounded into the muddy floor of a trench, or strewn broadcast on the reverse slopes of a shell-scarred parapet. The enemy suffered as we did, yelled with pain when his wounds prompted him, forgot perhaps in the insane combat some of the nicer tenets of chivalry. After all, war is an approved licence for brotherly mutilation, its aims are sanctioned, only the means towards its end are disputed. It is a sad and sorry business from start to finish, from diplomacy that begets it to the Te Deums that rise to God in thanksgiving for victory obtained. In the first German trench there were dozens of dead, the trench was literally piled with lifeless bodies in ugly grey uniforms. Curiosity prompted me to look into the famous German dug-outs. They were remarkable constructions, caves leading into the bowels of the earth, some of them capable of holding a whole platoon of soldiers. These big dug-outs had stairs leading down to the main chamber and steps leading out. In one I counted forty-seven steps leading down from the floor of the trench to the roof of the shelter. No shell made was capable of piercing[89] these constructions, but a bomb flung downstairs.... I looked into a pretentious dug-out as I was going along the trench. This one, the floor of which was barely two feet below the level of the trench floor, must have been an officer\u0027s. It was sumptuously furnished, a curtained bed with a white coverlet stood in one corner. Near the door was a stove and a scuttle of coal. In another corner stood a table, and on it was a half bottle of wine, three glasses, a box of cigars, and a vase of flowers. These things I noticed later; what I saw first on entering was a wounded German lying across the bed, his head against the wall and his feet on the floor. His right arm was almost severed at the shoulder. I entered and gazed at him. There was a look of mute appeal in his eyes, and for some reason I felt ashamed of myself for having intruded on the privacy of a dying man. There come times when a man on the field of battle should be left alone to his own thoughts. I unloosened my water-bottle from its holder and by sign inquired if he wanted a drink. He nodded, and I placed the bottle to his lips. \"Sprechen Anglais?\" I inquired, and he shook his head. I took my bottle of morphia tablets from[90] my pocket and explained to him as well as I was able what the bottle contained, and he permitted me to place two under his tongue. When rummaging in my pocket I happened to bring out my rosary beads and he noticed them. He spoke and I guessed that he was inquiring if I was a Catholic. I nodded assent. He fumbled with his left hand in his tunic pocket and brought out a little mud-stained booklet and handed it to me. I noticed that the volume was a prayer-book. By his signs I concluded that he wanted me to keep it. I turned to leave, but he called me back and pointed to his trousers pocket as if he wanted me to bring something out of it. I put in my hand and drew out a little leather packet from which the muzzle of a revolver peeped forth. This I put in my pocket. He feared that if some of our men found this in his possession his life might be a few hours shorter than it really would be if he were left to die in peace. I could see that he required me to do something further for him. Raising his left hand with difficulty (I now saw that blood was flowing down the wrist) he pointed at his tunic pocket, and I put my hand in there. A clasp-knife, a few buttons, a piece of string and a photo were all that the pocket contained. The photograph showed a man, whom I saw was the soldier,[91] a woman and a little child seated at a table. I put it in his hand, and with brilliant eyes and set teeth he raised his head to look at it.... I went outside. M\u0027Crone was coming along the trench with a bomb in his hand. \"Any of them in that dug-out?\" he asked me. \"One,\" I replied. \"Then I\u0027ll give him this,\" M\u0027Crone shouted. His gestures were violent, and his indifference to personal danger as shown in his loud laughter was somewhat exaggerated. As long as he had something to do he was all right, but a moment\u0027s thought would crumple him up like a wet rag. \"I\u0027ve done in seven of them already,\" he shouted. \"The one in here is dying,\" I said. \"Leave him alone.\" M\u0027Crone went to the dug-out door, looked curiously in, then walked away. Behind the German trench I found one of our boys slowly recovering from an attack of gas. Beside him lay a revolver, a mere toy of a thing, and touching him was a German with a bullet in his temple. The boy told me an interesting story as I propped him up in a sitting position against a couple of discarded equipments. \"I tripped up, and over I went,\" he said.[92] \"I came to slowly, and was conscious of many things \u0027fore I had the power to move my hands or feet. What do you think was happenin\u0027? There was a bloomin\u0027 German sniper under cover pottin\u0027 at our boys, and that cover was a bundle of warm, livin\u0027 flesh; the blighter\u0027s cover was me! \u0027If I get my hand in my pocket,\u0027 I says to myself, \u0027I\u0027ll get my revolver and blow the beggar\u0027s brains out.\u0027\" \"Blow out his brains with that!\" I said, looking at the weapon. \"You might as well try to blow out his brains with a pinch of snuff!\" \"That\u0027s all you know!\" said the boy. \"Anyway, I got my hand into my pocket, it crawled in like a snake, and I got the little pet out. And the German was pot-pottin\u0027 all the time. Then I fetched the weapon up, stuck the muzzle plunk against the man\u0027s head and pulled the trigger twice. He didn\u0027t half kick up a row. See if the two bullets have gone through one hole, Pat.\" \"They have,\" I told him. \"I knew it,\" he answered. \"Ah! it\u0027s an easy job to kill a man. You just rush at him and you see his eyes and nothin\u0027 else. There\u0027s a mist over the trench. You shove your bayonet forward and it sticks in something soft and almost gets dragged out of your hands. Then you get annoyed because[93] you can\u0027t pull it back easy. That\u0027s all that happens and you\u0027ve killed a man.... How much water have you got?\" A German youth of seventeen or eighteen with a magnificent helmet on his head and a red cross on his arm was working in the centre of a square formed by four of his dead countrymen, digging a grave. The sweat stood out on his forehead, and from time to time he cast an uneasy glance about him. \"What are you doing there?\" I asked. \"Digging a grave for these,\" he said, in good English, pointing a shaky finger at the prostrate figures. \"I suppose I\u0027ll be put in it myself,\" he added. \"Why?\" I inquired. \"Oh! you English shoot all prisoners.\" \"You\u0027re a fool, Fritz,\" said M\u0027Crone, approaching him. \"We\u0027re not going to do you any harm. Look, I\u0027ve brought you something to eat.\" He handed the boy a piece of cake, but the young Bavarian shook his head. He was trembling with terror, and the shovel shook in his hands. Fifteen minutes later when I passed that way carrying in a wounded man, I saw M\u0027Crone and the young Bavarian sitting on the brink of the grave smoking cigarettes and laughing heartily over some joke. Prisoners were going down towards M——[94] across the open. Prisoners are always taken across the open in bulk with as small an escort as possible. I saw a mob of two hundred go along, their hands in the air, and stern Tommies marching on flank and at rear. The party was a mixed one. Some of the prisoners were strong, sturdy youngsters of nineteen or twenty, others were old men, war-weary and dejected. A few were thin, weedy creatures, but others were massive blocks of bone and muscle, well set-up and brimful of energy even in their degrading plight. Now and again queer assortments of these came along. One man was taken prisoner in a cellar on the outskirts of Loos. Our men discovered him asleep in a bed, pulled him out and found that he was enjoying a decent, civilised slumber. He came down to M—— as he was taken prisoner, his sole clothing being a pair of stockings, a shirt and an identity disc. Four big Highlanders, massive of shoulder and leg, escorted a puny, spectacled youth along the rim of the trench, and following them came a diminutive Cockney with a massive helmet on his head, the sole escort for twelve gigantic Bavarian Grenadiers. The Cockney had now only one enemy, he was the man who offered to help him at his work. I came across a crumpled figure of a man in grey, dead in a shell-crater. One arm was[95] bent under him, the other stretched forward almost touching a photograph of a woman and three little children. I placed the photograph under the edge of the man\u0027s tunic. Near him lay another Bavarian, an old man, deeply wrinkled and white haired, and wounded through the chest. He was trembling all over like a wounded bird, but his eyes were calm and they looked beyond the tumult and turmoil of the battlefield into some secret world that only the dying can see. A rosary was in the man\u0027s hand and his lips were mumbling something: he was telling his beads. He took no notice of me. Across the level at this point came a large party of prisoners amidst a storm of shells. The German gunners had shortened their range and were now shelling the ground occupied by their troops an hour previous. Callous, indifferent destruction! The oncoming prisoners were Germans—as men they were of no use to us; it would cost our country money and men to keep and feed them. They were Germans, but of no further use to Germany; they were her pawns in a game of war and now useless in the play. As if to illustrate this, a shell from a German gun dropped in the midst of the batch and pieces of the abject party whirled in air. The gun which had destroyed them had acted as[96] their guardian for months. It was a frantic mother slaying her helpless brood. The stretcher-bearer sees all the horror of war written in blood and tears on the shell-riven battlefield. The wounded man, thank heaven! has only his own pain to endure, although the most extreme agony which flesh is heir to is written large on the field of fight. Several times that day I asked myself the question, \"Why are all soldiers not allowed to carry morphia?\" How much pain it would save! How many pangs of pain might morphia alleviate! How often would it give that rest and quiet which a man requires when an excited heart persists in pumping blood out through an open wound! In the East morphia is known as \"The gift of God\"; on the field of battle the gift of God should not be denied to men in great pain. It would be well indeed if all soldiers were taught first aid before a sergeant-major teaches them the art of forming fours on the parade ground.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52816.html","bookId":1038,"book":{"id":1038,"title":"The Great Push","description":"简介： The justice of the cause which endeavours to achieve its object by the murdering and maiming of mankind is apt to be doubted by a man who has come through a bayonet charge.
