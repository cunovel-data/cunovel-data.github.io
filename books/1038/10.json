{"id":34340,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX","content":"At Loos \n \n \"The wages of sin and a soldier is death.\"—Trench Proverb. \n \n For long I had looked on Loos from a distance, had seen the red-brick houses huddled together brooding under the shade of the massive Twin Towers, the giant sentinels of the German stronghold. Between me and the village lurked a thousand rifles and death-dealing maxims; out in the open no understanding could preserve a man from annihilation, luck alone could save him. \n \n On September 25th I lived in the village. By night a ruined village has a certain character of its own, the demolition of war seems to give each broken wall a consciousness of dignity and worth; the moonlight ripples over the chimneys, and sheaves of shadow lurk in every nook and corner. But by day, with its broken, jerry-built houses, the village has no relieving features, it is merely a heap of broken bricks, rubble and mud. Some[104] day, when ivy and lichen grow up the walls and cover green the litter that was Loos, a quaint, historical air may be given to the scene, but now it showed nothing but a depressing sameness of latchless doors, hingeless shutters, destruction and decay. Gone was all the fascinating, pathetic melancholy of the night when we took possession, but such might be expected: the dead is out of keeping with the day. \n \n I was deep in thought as I stood at the door of the dressing-station, the first in Loos, and at the moment, the only one. The second German trench, the trench that was the enemy\u0027s at dawn, ran across the bottom of the street, and our boys were busy there heaping sandbags on the parapet. A dozen men with loaded rifles stood in the dressing-station on guard, and watchful eyes scanned the streets, looking for the enemy who were still in hiding in the cellars or sniping from the upper stories of houses untouched by shell-fire. Down in our cellar the wounded and dying lay: by night, if they lived till then, we would carry them across the open to the dressing-station of Maroc. To venture across now, when the big guns chorused a fanfare of fury on the levels, would have been madness. \n \n I went to the door and looked up the street; it was totally deserted; a dead mule[105] and several khaki-clad figures lay on the pavement, and vicious bullets kicked up showers of sparks on the cobblestones. I could not tell where they were fired from.... A voice called my name and I turned round to see a head peep over the trench where it crossed the road. My mate, Bill Teake, was speaking. \n \n \"Come \u0027ere!\" he called. \"There\u0027s some doin\u0027s goin\u0027 to take place.\" \n \n I rushed across the open road where a machine gun from a hill on the right was sending its messages with shrewish persistence, and tumbled into the trench at my mate\u0027s side. \n \n \"What are the doings?\" I asked. \n \n \"The word \u0027as been passed along that a German observation balloon is going up over Lens an\u0027 we\u0027re goin\u0027 to shell it,\" said Bill. \n \n \"I can\u0027t see the blurry thing nohow,\" he added. \n \n I looked towards Lens, and saw the town pencilled reddish in the morning light with several defiant chimney stacks standing in air. One of these was smoking, which showed that the enemy was still working it. \n \n I saw the balloon rise over the town. It was a massive banana-like construction with ends pointing downwards, and it climbed slowly up the heavens. At that moment[106] our gunners greeted it with a salvo of shrapnel and struck it, as far as I could judge. \n \n It wriggled for a moment, like a big feather caught in a drift of air, then disappeared with startling suddenness. \n \n \"A neat shot,\" I said to Bill, who was now engaged on the task of looking for the snappy maxim shrew that tapped impatiently on the sandbagged parapet. \n \n \"I think it\u0027s up there,\" he said, pointing to the crest where three or four red-tiled houses snuggled in the cover of a spinney. \"It\u0027s in one of them big \u0027ouses, bet yer. If I find it I\u0027ll get the artillery to blow the place to blazes!\" he concluded, with an air of finality. \n \n I went back to the dressing-station and found the men on guard in a state of tense excitement. They had seen a German cross the street two hundred yards up, and a red-haired youth, Ginger Turley, who had fired at the man, vowed that he had hit him. \n \n \"I saw \u0027im fall,\" said Ginger. \"Then \u0027e crawled into a \u0027ouse on \u0027ands and knees.\" \n \n \"\u0027E was only shammin\u0027,\" said the corporal of the guard. \"Nobody can be up to these \u0027ere Allemongs.\" \n \n \"I \u0027it \u0027im,\" said Ginger heatedly. \"Couldn\u0027t miss a man at two \u0027undred and me gettin\u0027 proficiency pay for good shootin\u0027 at S\u0027nalbans (St. Albans).\" \n \n [107] \n \n A man at the door suddenly uttered a loud yell. \n \n \"Get yer \u0027ipes,\" he yelled. \"Quick! Grease out of it and get into the scrap. There\u0027s \u0027undreds of \u0027em up the streets. Come on! Come out of it! We\u0027ll give the swine socks!\" \n \n He rushed into the street, raised his rifle to his shoulder and fired two rounds. Then he raced up the street shouting, with the guard following. I looked out. \n \n The men in khaki were rushing on a mob of some fifty or sixty Germans who advanced to meet them with trembling arms raised over their heads, signifying in their manner that they wished to surrender. I had seen many Germans surrender that morning and always noticed that their uplifted arms shook as if stricken with palsy. I suppose they feared what might befall them when they fell into our hands. \n \n With hands still in air and escorted by our boys they filed past the door of the dressing-station. All but one man, who was wounded in the jaw. \n \n \"This is a case for you, Pat,\" said the corporal of the guard, and beckoned to the wounded German to come indoors. \n \n He was an ungainly man, and his clothes clung to his body like rags to a scarecrow. His tunic was ripped in several places, and[108] a mountain of Loos mud clung to his trousers. His face was an interesting one, his eyes, blue and frank, seemed full of preoccupation that put death out of reckoning. \n \n \"Sprechen Anglais?\" I asked, floundering in the mud of Franco-Germaine interrogation. He shook his head; the bullet had blown away part of the man\u0027s jaw and he could not speak. \n \n I dressed his wound in silence, an ugly, ghastly wound it looked, one that he would hardly recover from. As I worked with the bandages he brought out a little mirror, gazed for a moment at his face in the glass, and shook his head sadly. He put the mirror back in his pocket, but after a second he drew it out again and made a second inspection of his wound. \n \n The dressing done, I inquired by signs if he wanted to sleep; there was still some room in the cellar. He pointed his finger at his tunic over the breast and I saw a hole there that looked as if made by a red-hot poker. I cut the clothes off the man with my scissors and discovered that the bullet which went through the man\u0027s jaw had also gone through his chest. He was bleeding freely at the back near the spine and in front over the heart.... The man brought out his mirror again, and, standing with his back to a shattered looking-glass that still[109] remained in the building, he examined his wound after the manner of a barber who shows his customer the back of his head by use of a mirror.... Again the German shook his head sadly. I felt sorry for the man. My stock of bandages had run short, and Ginger Turley, who had received a parcel of underclothing a few days before, brought out a new shirt from his haversack, and tearing it into strips, he handed me sufficient cloth for a bandage. \n \n \"Poor bloke!\" muttered Turley, blushing a little as if ashamed of the kind action. \"I suppose it was my shot, too. \u0027E must be the feller that went crawlin\u0027 into the buildin\u0027.\" \n \n \"Not necessarily,\" I said, hoping to comfort Ginger. \n \n \"It was my shot that did it, sure enough,\" Ginger persisted. \"I couldn\u0027t miss at two \u0027undred yards, not if I tried.\" \n \n One of the men was looking at a little book, somewhat similar to the pay-book we carry on active service, which fell from the German\u0027s pocket. \n \n \"Bavarian!\" read the man with the book, and fixed a look of interrogation on the wounded man, who nodded. \n \n \"Musician?\" asked the man, who divined that certain German words stated that the Bavarian was a musician in civil life. \n \n [110] \n \n A sad look crept into the prisoner\u0027s eyes. He raised his hands and held them a little distance from his lips and moved his fingers rapidly; then he curved his left arm and drew his right slowly backward and forward across in front of his body. \n \n We understood; he played the flute and violin. Ginger Turley loves ragtime and is a master of the mouth-organ; and now having met a brother artist in such a woeful plight, Ginger\u0027s feelings overcame him, and two tears gathered in his eyes. \n \n \"I wish I wasn\u0027t such a good shot,\" he muttered. \n \n We wrapped the German up in a few rags, and since he wanted to follow his comrades, who left under escort, we allowed him to go. Ten minutes later, Bill Teake poked his little white potato of a nose round the door. \n \n \"I\u0027ve found \u0027im out,\" he said, and his voice was full of enthusiasm. \n \n \"Who have you found out?\" I asked. \n \n \"That bloomin\u0027 machine gun,\" Bill answered. \"I saw a little puff of smoke at one of the winders of a \u0027ouse up in the spinney. I kept my eye on that \u0027ere winder. Ev\u0027ry time I seed a puff of smoke, over comes a bullet. I told the officer, and he \u0027phones down to the artillery. There\u0027s goin\u0027 to be some doin\u0027s. Come on, Pat, and see the fun.\" \n \n It was too good to miss. Both of us[111] scurried across the road and took up a position in the trench from which we could get a good view of the spinney. \n \n \"That \u0027ouse there,\" said Bill, pointing to the red-brick building bordering a slag-heap known as \"The Double Crassier\" which tailed to a thin point near the village of Maroc. \"There! see at the winder on the left a puff of smoke.\" \n \n A bullet hit the sandbag at my side. I looked at the house indicated by Bill and saw a wisp of pale smoke trail up from one of the lower windows towards the roof. \n \n \"The machine gun\u0027s there, sure enough,\" I said. \n \n Then a bigger gun spoke; a shell whizzed through the air and raised a cloud of black dust from the rim of the slag-heap. \n \n \"More to the left, you bounders, more to the left!\" yelled Bill. \n \n He could not have been more intent on the work if he were the gunner engaged upon the task of demolition. \n \n The second shot crept nearer and a shrub uprooted whirled in air. \n \n \"That\u0027s the ticket!\" yelled Bill, clapping his hands. \"Come, gunner, get the bounder next time!\" \n \n The gunner got him with the next shot which struck the building fair in the centre and smashed it to pieces. \n \n [112] \n \n \"That was a damned good one,\" said Bill approvingly. \"The bloomin\u0027 gun is out of action now for the duration of war. Have you seen that bloke?\" \n \n Bill Teake pointed at a dead German who lay on the crest of the parados, his hands doubled under him, and his jaw bound with a bloodstained dressing. \n \n \"He just got killed a minute ago,\" said Bill. \"He jumped across the trench when the machine gun copped \u0027im and \u0027e went down flop!\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve just dressed his wounds,\" I said. \n \n \"He\u0027ll need no dressin\u0027 now,\" said Bill, and added compassionately, \"Poor devil! S\u0027pose \u0027e \u0027s \u0027ad some one as cared for \u0027im.\" \n \n I thought of home and hoped to send a letter along to Maroc with a wounded man presently. From there letters would be forwarded. I had a lead pencil in my pocket, but I had no envelope. \n \n \"I\u0027ll give you a half-franc for a green envelope,\" I said, and Bill Teake took from his pocket the green envelope, which needed no regimental censure, but was liable to examination at the Base. \n \n \"\u0027Arf-franc and five fags,\" he said, speaking with the studied indifference of a fishwife making a bargain. \n \n \"Half a franc and two fags,\" I answered. \n \n \"\u0027Arf a franc and four fags,\" he said. \n \n [113] \n \n \"Three fags,\" I ventured. \n \n \"Done,\" said Bill, and added, \"I\u0027ve now sold the bloomin\u0027 line of communication between myself and my ole man for a few coppers and three meesly fags.\" \n \n \"What\u0027s your old man\u0027s profession, Bill?\" I asked. \n \n \"\u0027Is wot?\" \n \n \"His trade?\" \n \n \"Yer don\u0027t know my ole man, Pat?\" he inquired. \"Everybody knows \u0027im. \u0027E \u0027as as good a reputation as old Times. Yer must \u0027ave seen \u0027im in the Strand wiv \u0027is shiny buttons, burnished like gold in a jooler\u0027s winder, carryin\u0027 a board wiv \u0027Globe Metal Polish\u0027 on it.\" \n \n \"Oh!\" I said with a laugh. \n \n \"But \u0027e\u0027s a devil for \u0027is suds \u0027e is——\" \n \n \"What are suds?\" I asked. \n \n \"Beer,\" said Bill. \"\u0027E can \u0027old more\u0027n any man in Lunnon, more\u0027n the chucker-out at \u0027The Cat and Mustard Pot\u0027 boozer in W—— Road even. Yer should see the chucker-out an\u0027 my ole man comin\u0027 \u0027ome on Saturday night. They keep themselves steady by rollin\u0027 in opposite directions.\" \n \n \"Men with good reputations don\u0027t roll home inebriated,\" I said. \"Excessive alcoholic dissipation is utterly repugnant to dignified humanity.\" \n \n \"Wot!\" \n \n [114] \n \n \"Is your father a churchgoer?\" I asked. \n \n \"Not \u0027im,\" said Bill. \"\u0027E don\u0027t believe that one can go to \u0027eaven by climbin\u0027 up a church steeple. \u0027E\u0027s a good man, that\u0027s wot \u0027e is. \u0027E works \u0027ard when \u0027e\u0027s workin\u0027, \u0027e can use \u0027is fives wiv anyone, \u0027e can take a drink or leave it, but \u0027e prefers takin\u0027 it. Nobody can take a rise out o\u0027 \u0027im fer \u0027e knows \u0027is place, an\u0027 that\u0027s more\u0027n some people do.\" \n \n \"Bill, did you kill any Germans this morning?\" I asked. \n \n \"Maybe I did,\" Bill answered, \"and maybe I didn\u0027t. I saw one bloke, an Allemong, in the front trench laughin\u0027 like \u0027ell. \u0027I\u0027ll make yer laugh,\u0027 I said to \u0027im, and shoved my bayonet at \u0027is bread basket. Then I seed \u0027is foot; it was right off at the ankle. I left \u0027im alone. After that I \u0027ad a barney. I was goin\u0027 round a traverse and right in front of me was a Boche, eight foot \u0027igh or more. Oh! \u0027e \u0027ad a bayonet as long as \u0027imself, and a beard as long as \u0027is bayonet.\" \n \n \"What did you do?\" \n \n \"Oh! I retreated,\" said Bill. \"Then I met four of the Jocks, they \u0027ad bombs. I told them wot I seen an\u0027 they went up with me to the place. The Boche saw us and \u0027e rushed inter a dug-out. One of the Jocks threw a bomb, and bang!——\" \n \n \"Have you seen Kore?\" I asked. \n \n [115] \n \n \"No, I didn\u0027t see \u0027im at all,\" Bill answered. \"I was mad for a while. Then I saw a lot of Alleymongs rush into a dug-out. \u0027Gorblimey\u0027 I said to the Jocks, \u0027we\u0027ll give \u0027em \u0027ell,\u0027 and I caught \u0027old of a German bomb, one o\u0027 them kind where you pull the string out and this sets the fuse goin\u0027. I coiled the string round my fingers and pulled. But I couldn\u0027t loosen the string. It was a go! I \u0027eld out my arm with the bomb \u0027angin\u0027. \u0027Take it off!\u0027 I yelled to the Jocks. Yer should see them run off. There was no good in me runnin\u0027. Blimey! I didn\u0027t \u0027arf feel bad. Talk about a cold sweat; I sweated icicles! And there was the damned bomb \u0027angin\u0027 from my \u0027and and me thinkin\u0027 it was goin\u0027 to burst. But it didn\u0027t; I \u0027adn\u0027t pulled the string out far enough. \n \n \"And that\u0027s Loos,\" he went on, standing on the fire-step and looking up the road. \"It\u0027s bashed about a lot. There\u0027s \u0027ardly a \u0027ouse standin\u0027. And that\u0027s the Tower Bridge,\" he added, looking fixedly at the Twin Towers that stood scarred but unbroken over Loos coal mine. \n \n \"There was a sniper up there this mornin\u0027,\" he told me. \"\u0027E didn\u0027t \u0027arf cause some trouble. Knocked out dozens of our fellers. \u0027E was brought down at last by a bomb.\" \n \n He laughed as he spoke, then became silent.[116] For fully five minutes there was not a word spoken. \n \n I approached the parapet stealthily and looked up the street of Loos, a solemn, shell-scarred, mysterious street where the dead lay amidst the broken tiles. Were all those brown bundles dead men? Some of them maybe were still dying; clutching at life with vicious energy. A bundle lay near me, a soldier in khaki with his hat gone. I could see his close, compact, shiny curls which seemed to have been glued on to his skull. Clambering up the parapet I reached forward and turned him round and saw his face. It was leaden-hued and dull; the wan and almost colourless eyes fixed on me in a vague and glassy stare, the jaw dropped sullenly, and the tongue hung out. Dead.... And up the street, down in the cellars, at the base of the Twin Towers, they were dying. How futile it was to trouble about one when thousands needed help. Where should I begin? Who should I help first? Any help I might be able to give seemed so useless. I had been at work all the morning dressing the wounded, but there were so many. I was a mere child emptying the sea with a tablespoon. I crawled into the trench again to find Bill still looking over the parapet. This annoyed me. Why, I could not tell. \n \n \"What are you looking at?\" I asked. \n \n [117] \n \n There was no answer. I looked along the trench and saw that all the men were looking towards the enemy\u0027s line; watching, as it seemed, for something to take place. None knew what the next moment would bring forth. The expectant mood was prevalent. All were waiting. \n \n Up the road some houses were still peopled with Germans, and snipers were potting at us with malicious persistency, but behind the parapet we were practically immune from danger. As we looked a soldier appeared round the bend of the trench, the light of battle in his eyes and his body festooned with bombs. \n \n \"It\u0027s dangerous to go up the centre of the street,\" I called to him as he came to a halt beside me and looked up the village. \n \n \"Bend down,\" I said. \"Your head is over the parapet.\" I recognised the man. He was Gilhooley the bomber. \n \n \"What does it matter?\" he muttered. \"I want to get at them.... Oh! I know yer face.... D\u0027ye mind the champagne at Nouex-les-Mines.... These bombs are real ones, me boy.... Do you know where the snipers are?\" \n \n \"There\u0027s one up there,\" I said, raising my head and pointing to a large house on the left of the road near the Twin Towers. \"I[118] saw the smoke of his rifle when he fired at me a while ago.\" \n \n \"Then he must get what he\u0027s lookin\u0027 for,\" said Gilhooley, tightening his belt of bombs, and, clutching his rifle, rushed out into the roadway. \"By Jasus! I\u0027ll get him out of it!\" \n \n I raised my head and watched, fascinated. With prodigious strides Gilhooley raced up the street, his rifle clutched tightly in his hand. Suddenly he paused, as if in thought, and his rifle went clattering across the cobbles. Then he sank slowly to the ground, kicking out a little with his legs. The bullet had hit him in the jaw and it came out through the back of his neck.... \n \n I could hear the wounded crying and moaning somewhere near, or perhaps far away. A low, lazy breeze slouched up from the field which we had crossed that morning, and sound travelled far. The enemy snipers on Hulluch copse were busy, and probably the dying were being hit again. Some of them desired it, the slow process of dying on the open field of war is so dreadful.... A den of guns, somewhere near Lens, became voluble, and a monstrous fanfare of fury echoed in the heavens. The livid sky seemed to pull itself up as if to be out of the way; under it the cavalcades of war ran riot. A chorus of screeches and yells[119] rose trembling and whirling in air, snatching at each other like the snarling and barking of angry dogs. \n \n Bill stood motionless, looking at the enemy\u0027s line, his gaze concentrated on a single point; in his eyes there was a tense, troubled expression, as if he was calculating a sum which he could not get right. Now and again he would shake his head as if trying to throw something off and address a remark to the man next him, who did not seem to hear. Probably he was asleep. In the midst of artillery tumult some men are overcome with languor and drop asleep as they stand. On the other hand, many get excited, burst into song and laugh boisterously at most commonplace incidents. \n \n Amidst the riot, an undertone of pain became more persistent than ever. The levels where the wounded lay were raked with shrapnel that burst viciously in air and struck the blood stained earth with spiteful vigour. \n \n The cry for stretcher-bearers came down the trench, and I hurried off to attend to the stricken. I met him crawling along on all fours, looking like an ungainly lobster that has escaped from a basket. A bullet had hit the man in the back and he was in great pain; so much in pain that when I was binding his wound he raised his fist and hit me in the face. \n \n [120] \n \n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he muttered, a moment afterwards. \"I didn\u0027t mean it, but, my God! this is hell!\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll have to lie here,\" I said, when I put the bandage on. \"You\u0027ll get carried out at night when we can cross the open.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m going now,\" he said. \"I want to go now. I must get away. You\u0027ll let me go, won\u0027t you, Pat?\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll be killed before you\u0027re ten yards across the open,\" I said. \"Better wait till to-night.\" \n \n \"Does the trench lead out?\" he asked. \n \n \"It probably leads to the front trench which the Germans occupied this morning,\" I said. \n \n \"Well, if we get there it will be a step nearer the dressing-station, anyway,\" said the wounded boy. \"Take me away from here, do please.\" \n \n \"Can you stand upright?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll try,\" he answered, and half weeping and half laughing, he got to his feet. \"I\u0027ll be able to walk down,\" he muttered. \n \n We set off. I walked in front, urging the men ahead to make way for a wounded man. No order meets with such quick obedience as \"Make way for wounded.\" \n \n All the way from Loos to the churchyard which the trench fringes and where the bones of the dead stick out through the[121] parapet, the trench was in fairly good order, beyond that was the dumping ground of death. \n \n The enemy in their endeavour to escape from the Irish that morning crowded the trench like sheep in a lane-way, and it was here that the bayonet, rifle-butt and bomb found them. Now they lay six deep in places.... One bare-headed man lay across the parapet, his hand grasping his rifle, his face torn to shreds with rifle bullets. One of his own countrymen, hidden in Hulluch copse, was still sniping at the dead thing, believing it to be an English soldier. Such is the irony of war. The wounded man ambled painfully behind me, grunting and groaning. Sometimes he stopped for a moment, leant against the side of the trench and swore for several seconds. Then he muttered a word of apology and followed me in silence. When we came to the places where the dead lay six deep we had to crawl across them on our hands and knees. To raise our heads over the parapet would be courting quick death. We would become part of that demolition of blood and flesh that was necessary for our victory. In front of us a crowd of civilians, old men, women and children, was crawling and stumbling over the dead bodies. A little boy was eating the contents of a bully-beef tin with great relish,[122] and the ancient female who accompanied him crossed herself whenever she stumbled across a prostrate German. The civilians were leaving Loos. \n \n On either side we could hear the wounded making moan, their cry was like the yelping of drowning puppies. But the man who was with me seemed unconscious of his surroundings; seldom even did he notice the dead on the floor of the trench; he walked over them unconcernedly. \n \n I managed to bring him down to the dressing-station. When we arrived he sat on a seat and cried like a child. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52818.html","bookId":1038,"book":{"id":1038,"title":"The Great Push","description":"简介： The justice of the cause which endeavours to achieve its object by the murdering and maiming of mankind is apt to be doubted by a man who has come through a bayonet charge.
