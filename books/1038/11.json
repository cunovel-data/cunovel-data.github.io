{"id":34341,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X","content":"A Night in Loos \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never see good in an enemy until you have defeated him.\"—War Proverb. \\n\\n \\n\\n Twilight softened the gaunt corners of the ruined houses, and sheaves of shadows cowered in unfathomable corners. A wine shop, gashed and fractured, said \"hush!\" to us as we passed; the shell-holed streets gaped at the indifferent, unconcerned sky. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See the streets are yawning,\" I said to my mate, Bill Teake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s because they\u0027re bored,\" he replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bill,\" I said, \"what do you mean by bored?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ve holes in them,\" he answered. \"Why d\u0027yer arst me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wanted to know if you were trying to make a pun,\" I said. \"That\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill grunted, and a moment\u0027s silence ensued. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Suppose it were made known to you, Bill,\" I said, \"that for the rest of your[124] natural life this was all you could look forward to, dull hours of waiting in the trenches, sleep in sodden dug-outs, eternal gun-firing and innumerable bayonet-charges; what would you do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wot would I do?\" said Bill, coming to a halt in the middle of the street. \"This is wot I\u0027d do,\" he said with decision. \"I\u0027d put a round in the breech, lay my \u0027ead on the muzzle of my \u0027ipe, and reach down and pull the blurry trigger. Wot would you do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should become very brave,\" I replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see wot yer mean,\" said Bill. \"Ye\u0027d be up to the Victoria Cross caper, and run yer nose into danger every time yer got a chance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may be right,\" I replied. \"No one likes this job, but we all endure it as a means towards an end.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Flat!\" I yelled, flopping to the ground and dragging Bill with me, as a shell burst on a house up the street and flung a thousand splinters round our heads. For a few seconds we cowered in the mud, then rose to our feet again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are means by which we are going to end war,\" I said. \"Did you see the dead and wounded to-day, the men groaning and shrieking, the bombs flung down into cellars, the bloodstained bayonets, the gouging and[125] the gruelling; all those things are means towards creating peace in a disordered world.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The unrest which precedes night made itself felt in Loos. Crows made their way homeward, cleaving the air with weary wings; a tottering wall fell on the street with a melancholy clatter, and a joist creaked near at hand, yearning, as it seemed, to break free from its shattered neighbours. A lone wind rustled down the street, weeping over the fallen bricks, and crooning across barricades and machine-gun emplacements. The greyish-white evening sky cast a vivid pallor over the Twin Towers, which stood out sharply defined against the lurid glow of a fire in Lens. \\n\\n \\n\\n All around Loos lay the world of trenches, secret streets, sepulchral towns, houses whose chimneys scarcely reached the level of the earth, crooked alleys, bayonet circled squares, and lonely graveyards where dead soldiers lay in the silent sleep that wakens to no earthly réveillé. \\n\\n \\n\\n The night fell. The world behind the German lines was lighted up with a white glow, the clouds seemed afire, and ran with a flame that was not red and had no glare. The tint was pale, and it trailed over Lens and the spinneys near the town, and spread trembling over the levels. White as a winding[126] sheet, it looked like a fire of frost, vast and wide diffused. Every object in Loos seemed to loose its reality, a spectral glimmer hung over the ruins, and the walls were no more than outlines. The Twin Towers was a tracery of silver and enchanted fairy construction that the sun at dawn might melt away, the barbed-wire entanglements (those in front of the second German trench had not been touched by our artillery) were fancies in gossamer. The world was an enchanted poem of contrasts of shadow and shine, of nooks and corners black as ebony, and prominent objects that shone with a spiritual glow. Men coming down the street bearing stretchers or carrying rations were phantoms, the men stooping low over the earth digging holes for their dead comrades were as ghostly as that which they buried. I lived in a strange world—a world of dreams and illusions. \\n\\n \\n\\n Where am I? I asked myself. Am I here? Do I exist? Where are the boys who marched with me from Les Brebis last night? I had looked on them during the day, seeing them as I had never seen them before, lying in silent and unquestioning peace, close to the yearning earth. Never again should I hear them sing in the musty barns near Givenchy; never again would we drink[127] red wine together in Café Pierre le Blanc, Nouex-les-Mines.... \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill Teake went back to his duties in the trench and left me. \\n\\n \\n\\n A soldier came down the street and halted opposite. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that light, soldier?\" he asked me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know,\" I answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hear it\u0027s an ammunition depot afire in Lens,\" said the man. \"Our shells hit it, and their blurry bullets have copped me now,\" he muttered, dropping on the roadway and crawling towards the shelter of the wall on his belly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where are you hit?\" I asked, helping him into the ruins of the estaminet—my dressing-station. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the leg,\" he answered, \"just below the knee. It was when I was speaking to you about the ammunition depot on fire. \u0027Our shells hit it,\u0027 I said, and just then something went siss! through my calf. \u0027Their blurry bullets have copped me now,\u0027 I said, didn\u0027t I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You did,\" I answered, laying my electric torch on the table and placing the wounded man on the floor. I ripped open his trousers and found the wound; the bullet had gone through the calf. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can you use your foot?\" I asked, and he moved his boot up and down. \\n\\n \\n\\n [128] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No fracture,\" I told him. \"You\u0027re all right for blighty, matey.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One of my mates who was sleeping in a cellar came up at that moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Still dressing wounded, Pat?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I just got wounded a minute ago,\" said the man on the floor as I fumbled about with a first field dressing. \"I was speaking to Pat about the fire at Lens, and I told him that our shells hit it, \u0027and a blurry bullet has copped me now,\u0027 I said, when I felt something go siss! through my leg.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lucky dog,\" said the man on the stair head. \"I\u0027d give fifteen pounds for your wound.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing doing,\" said the man on the floor with a laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When can I get down to the dressing-station?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, if you can walk,\" I told him. \"If you\u0027re to be carried I shall need three other men; the mud is knee deep on the road to Maroc.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see if I can walk,\" said the man, and tried to rise to his feet. The effort was futile, he collapsed like a wet rag. Fifteen minutes later four of us left Loos bearing a stretcher on our shoulders, and trudged across the fields to the main road and into the crush of war traffic, hideously incongruous in the pale light of the quiet night.[129] The night was quiet, for sounds that might make for riot were muffled by the mud. The limbers\u0027 wheels were mud to the axles, the mules drew their legs slowly out of muck almost reaching their bellies. Motor ambulances, wheeled stretchers, ammunition wagons, gun carriages, limbers, water-carts, mules, horses and men going up dragged their sluggish way through the mud on one side of the road; mules, horses and men, water-carts, limbers, gun carriages, ammunition wagons, wheeled stretchers and motor ambulances coming down moved slowly along the other side. Every man had that calm and assured indifference that comes with ordinary everyday life. Each was full of his own work, preoccupied with his toil, he was lost to the world around him. For the driver of the cart that we followed, a problem had to be worked out. The problem was this: how could he bring his mules and vehicles into Maroc and bring up a second load, then pilot his animals through mud and fire into Les Brebis before dawn; feed himself and his mules (when he got into safety), drink a glass or two of wine (if he had the money to pay for it), and wrap himself in his blanket and get to sleep in decent time for a good day\u0027s rest. Thus would he finish his night of work if the gods were kind. But they were not. \\n\\n \\n\\n [130] \\n\\n \\n\\n A momentary stoppage, and the mules stood stiffly in the mud, the offside wheeler twitching a long, restless ear. The driver lay back in his seat, resigned to the delay. I could see his whip in air, his face turned to the east where the blazing star-shells lit the line of battle. A machine gun spoke from Hill 70, and a dozen searching bullets whizzed about our heads. The driver uttered a sharp, infantile yell like a snared rabbit, leant sideways, and fell down on the roadway. The mule with the twitching ear dropped on top of the man and kicked out wildly with its hind legs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cut the \u0027oss out!\" yelled someone from the top of a neighbouring wagon, and three or four soldiers rushed to the rescue, pulled the driver clear, and felt his heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dead,\" one said, dodging to avoid the hoofs of the wounded mule. \"The bullet \u0027as caught the poor cove in the forehead.... Well, it\u0027s all over now, and there\u0027s nothing to be done.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shoot the mule,\" someone suggested. \"It\u0027s kicking its mate in the belly.... Also put the dead man out of the roadway. \u0027E\u0027ll get mixed with the wheels.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Someone procured a rifle, placed the muzzle close to the animal\u0027s ear, and fired. The mule stretched its hind legs lazily out and ceased its struggles. Movement was resumed[131] ahead, and dodging round the dead man, we continued our journey through the mud. It was difficult to make headway, our legs were knee-deep in slush, and the monstrous futility of shoving our way through, wearied us beyond telling. Only at rare intervals could we lift our feet clear of the ground and walk in comparative ease for a few moments. Now and again a machine gun opened on the moving throng, and bullets hummed by perilously close to our ears. The stretcher was a dead weight on us, and the poles cut into our shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Scottish had charged across the road in the morning, and hundreds had come to grief. They were lying everywhere, out on the fields, by the roadside, and in the roadway mixed up with the mud. The driver who had been killed a moment ago was so preoccupied with his task that he had no time for any other work but his own. We were all like him. We had one job to do and that job took up our whole attention until it was completed. That was why our party did not put down our stretcher on the road and raise the dead from the mud; we walked over them. \\n\\n \\n\\n How cold they looked, the kilted lads lying on their backs in the open, their legs, bare from knee to hip, white and ghostly in the wan light of the blazing ammunition depot at Lens. \\n\\n \\n\\n [132] \\n\\n \\n\\n Mud on the roadway, reaching to the axles of the limber wheels, dead men on the roadside, horses and mules tugging and straining at the creaking vehicles, wounded men on the stretchers; that was the picture of the night, and on we trudged, moving atoms of a pattern that kept continually repeating itself. \\n\\n \\n\\n The mutilated and maimed who still lay out in the open called plaintively for succour. \"For God\u0027s sake bring me away from here,\" a voice called. \"I\u0027ve been lying out this last four days.\" The man who spoke had been out since dawn, but periods of unconsciousness had disordered his count of time, and every conscious moment was an eternity of suffering. \\n\\n \\n\\n We arrived at Q—— instead of Maroc, having missed the right turning. The village was crowded with men; a perfect village it was, with every house standing, though the civilian population had long since gone to other places. Two shells, monstrous twelve-inch terrors, that failed to explode, lay on the pavement at the entrance. We went past these gingerly, as ladies in dainty clothing might pass a fouling post, and carried our burden down the streets to the dressing-station. Outside the door were dozens of stretchers, and on each a stricken soldier, quiet and resigned, who gazed into the cheerless[133] and unconcerned sky as if trying to find some deadened hope. \\n\\n \\n\\n A Scottish regiment relieved from the trenches stood round a steaming dixie of tea, each man with a mess-tin in his hand. I approached the Jocks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Any tea to spare?\" I asked one. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, mon, of course there\u0027s a drappie goin\u0027,\" he answered, and handed me the mess-tin from which he had been drinking. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you fare to-day?\" I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s a wheen o\u0027 us left yet,\" he replied with a solemn smile. \"A dozen dixies of tea would nae gang far among us yesterday; but wi\u0027 one dixie the noo, we\u0027ve some to spare.... Wha\u0027 d\u0027ye belong tae?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The London Irish,\" I told him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Twas your fellows that kicked the futba\u0027 across the field?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Into the German trench?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not so far,\" I told the man. \"A bullet hit the ball by the barbed-wire entanglements; I saw it lying there during the day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Twas the maddest thing I\u0027ve ever heard o\u0027,\" said the Jock. \"Hae ye lost many men?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A good number,\" I replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose ye did,\" said the man, but by[134] his voice, I knew that he was not in the least interested in our losses; not even in the issue of battle. In fact, few of us knew of the importance of the events in which we took part, and cared as little. If I asked one of our boys at that moment what were his thoughts he would answer, if he spoke truly: \"I wonder when we\u0027re going to get relieved,\" or \"I hope we\u0027re going to get a month\u0027s rest when we get out.\" Soldiers always speak of \"we\"; the individual is submerged in his regiment. We, soldiers, are part of the Army, the British Army, which will be remembered in days to come, not by a figurehead, as the fighters of Waterloo are remembered by Wellington, but as an army mighty in deed, prowess and endurance; an army which outshone its figureheads. \\n\\n \\n\\n I went back to the dressing-station. Our wounded man was inside, and a young doctor was busy putting on a fresh dressing. The soldier was narrating the story of his wound. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was speaking to a stretcher-bearer about the ammunition depot afire in Lens,\" he was saying. \"\u0027Our shells hit it, and their bloomin\u0027 bullets \u0027ave copped me now,\u0027 I said, when something went siss! through my leg.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The man gazed round at the door and saw me. \\n\\n \\n\\n [135] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wasn\u0027t that what I said, Pat?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" I answered. \"You said that their blooming bullets had copped you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52819.html","bookId":1038,"book":{"id":1038,"title":"The Great Push","description":"简介： The justice of the cause which endeavours to achieve its object by the murdering and maiming of mankind is apt to be doubted by a man who has come through a bayonet charge.
