{"id":34333,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II","content":"Out from Nouex-les-Mines \\n\\n Every soldier to his trade— \\n\\n Trigger sure and bayonet keen— \\n\\n But we go forth to use a spade \\n\\n Marching out from Nouex-les-Mines. \\n\\n \\n\\n As I was sitting in the Café Pierre le Blanc helping Bill Teake, my Cockney mate, to finish a bottle of vin rouge, a snub-nosed soldier with thin lips who sat at a table opposite leant towards me and asked: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you MacGill, the feller that writes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" I answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thought I twigged yer from the photo of yer phiz in the papers,\" said the man with the snub nose, as he turned to his mates who were illustrating a previous fight in lines of beer representing trenches on the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See!\" he said to them, \"I knew \u0027im the moment I clapped my eyes on \u0027im.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hold your tongue,\" one of the men, a ginger-headed fellow, who had his trigger finger deep in beer, made answer. Then the dripping finger rose slowly and was placed carefully on the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n [23] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This,\" said Carrots, \"is Richebourg, this drop of beer is the German trench, and these are our lines. Our regiment crossed at this point and made for this one, but somehow or another we missed our objective. Just another drop of beer and I\u0027ll show you where we got to; it was—Blimey! where\u0027s that bloomin\u0027 beer? \u0027Oo the \u0027ell!—Oh! it\u0027s Gilhooley!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I had never seen Gilhooley before, but I had often heard talk of him. Gilhooley was an Irishman and fought in an English regiment; he was notorious for his mad escapades, his dare-devil pranks, and his wild fearlessness. Now he was opposite to me, drinking a mate\u0027s beer, big, broad-shouldered, ungainly Gilhooley. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first impression the sight of him gave me was one of almost irresistible strength; I felt that if he caught a man around the waist with his hand he could, if he wished it, squeeze him to death. He was clumsily built, but an air of placid confidence in his own strength gave his figure a certain grace of its own. His eyes glowed brightly under heavy brows, his jowl thrust forward aggressively seemed to challenge all upon whom he fixed his gaze. It looked as if vast passions hidden in the man were thirsting to break free and rout everything. Gilhooley was a dangerous man to cross. Report had it that he was a[24] bomber, and a master in this branch of warfare. Stories were told about him how he went over to the German trenches near Vermelles at dusk every day for a fortnight, and on each visit flung half a dozen bombs into the enemy\u0027s midst. Then he sauntered back to his own lines and reported to an officer, saying, \"By Jasus! I got them out of it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Once, when a German sniper potting at our trenches in Vermelles picked off a few of our men, an exasperated English subaltern gripped a Webley revolver and clambered over the parapet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to stop that damned sniper,\" said the young officer. \"I\u0027m going to earn the V.C. Who\u0027s coming along with me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m with you,\" said Gilhooley, scrambling lazily out into the open with a couple of pet bombs in his hand. \"By Jasus! we\u0027ll get him out of it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two men went forward for about twenty yards, when the officer fell with a bullet through his head. Gilhooley turned round and called back, \"Any other officer wantin\u0027 to earn the V.C.?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was no reply: Gilhooley sauntered back, waited in the trench till dusk, when he went across to the sniper\u0027s abode with a bomb and \"got him out of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A calamity occurred a few days later. The[25] irrepressible Irishman was fooling with a bomb in the trench when it fell and exploded. Two soldiers were wounded, and Gilhooley went off to the Hospital at X. with a metal reminder of his discrepancy wedged in the soft of his thigh. There he saw Colonel Z., or \"Up-you-go-and-the-best-of-luck,\" as Colonel Z. is known to the rank and file of the B.E.F. \\n\\n \\n\\n The hospital at X. is a comfortable place, and the men are in no hurry to leave there for the trenches; but when Colonel Z. pronounces them fit they must hasten to the fighting line again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Four men accompanied Gilhooley when he was considered fit for further fight. The five appeared before the Colonel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you feel?\" the Colonel asked the first man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not well at all,\" was the answer. \"I can\u0027t eat \u0027ardly nuffink.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s the sort of man required up there,\" Colonel Z. answered. \"So up you go and the best of luck.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How far can you see?\" the Colonel asked the next man, who had complained that his eyesight was bad. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only about fifty yards,\" was the answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your regiment is in trenches barely twenty-five yards from those of the enemy,\"[26] the Colonel told him. \"So up you go, and the best of luck.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Off you go and find the man who wounded you,\" the third soldier was told; the fourth man confessed that he had never killed a German. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You had better double up,\" said the Colonel. \"It\u0027s time you killed one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It came to Gilhooley\u0027s turn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How many men have you killed?\" he was asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In and out about fifty,\" was Gilhooley\u0027s answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Make it a hundred then,\" said the Colonel; \"and up you go, and the best of luck.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By Jasus! I\u0027ll get fifty more out of it in no time,\" said Gilhooley, and on the following day he sauntered into the Café Pierre le Blanc in Nouex-les-Mines, drank another man\u0027s beer, and sat down on a chair at the table where four glasses filled to the brim stood sparkling in the lamplight. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gilhooley, penniless and thirsty, had an unrivalled capacity for storing beer in his person. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Back again, Gilhooley?\" someone remarked in a diffident voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Back again!\" said Gilhooley wearily, putting his hand in the pocket of his tunic and taking out a little round object about the size of a penny inkpot. \\n\\n \\n\\n [27] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hear there\u0027s going to be a big push shortly,\" he muttered. \"This,\" he said, holding the bomb between trigger finger and thumb, \"will go bang into the enemy\u0027s trenches next charge.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A dozen horror-stricken eyes gazed at the bomb for a second, and the soldiers in the café remembered how Gilhooley once, in a moment of distraction, forgot that a fuse was lighted, then followed a hurried rush, and the café was almost deserted by the occupants. Gilhooley smiled wearily, replaced the bomb in his pocket, and set himself the task of draining the beer glasses. \\n\\n \\n\\n My momentary thrill of terror died away when the bomb disappeared, and, leaving Bill, I approached the Wild Man\u0027s table and sat down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gilhooley?\" I said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh, what is it?\" he interjected. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you have a drink with me?\" I hurried to inquire. \"Something better than this beer for a change. Shall we try champagne?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, we\u0027ll try it,\" he said sarcastically, and a queer smile hovered about his eyes. Somehow I had a guilty sense of doing a mean action.... I called to Bill. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come on, matey,\" I said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill approached the table and sat down. I called for a bottle of champagne. \\n\\n \\n\\n [28] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is Gilhooley, Bill,\" I said to my mate. \"He\u0027s the bomber we\u0027ve heard so much about.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose ye\u0027ll want to know everythin\u0027 about me now, seein\u0027 ye\u0027ve asked me to take a drop of champagne,\" said Gilhooley, his voice rising. \"Damn yer champagne. You think I\u0027m a bloomin\u0027 alligator in the Zoo, d\u0027ye? Give me a bun and I\u0027ll do anythin\u0027 ye want me to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That men should want to speak to you is merely due to your fame,\" I said. \"In the dim recesses of the trenches men speak of your exploits with bated breath——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What the devil are ye talkin\u0027 about?\" asked Gilhooley. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About you,\" I said. \\n\\n \\n\\n He burst out laughing at this and clinked glasses with me when we drank, but he seemed to forget Bill. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the rest of the evening he was in high good humour, and before leaving he brought out his bomb and showed that it was only a dummy one, harmless as an egg-shell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But let me get half a dozen sergeants round a rum jar and out comes this bomb!\" said Gilhooley. \"Then they fly like hell and I get a double tot of rum.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a damned good idea,\" I said. \"What is he wanting?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I pointed at the military policeman who[29] had just poked his head through the café door. He looked round the room, taking stock of the occupants. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All men of the London Irish must report to their companies at once,\" he shouted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s somethin\u0027 on the blurry boards again,\" said Bill Teake. \"I suppose we\u0027ve got to get up to the trenches to-night. We were up last night diggin\u0027,\" he said to Gilhooley. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gilhooley shrugged his shoulders, took a stump of a cigarette from behind his ear and lit it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take care of yourselves,\" he said as he went out. \\n\\n \\n\\n At half-past nine we marched out of Nouex-les-Mines bound for the trenches where we had to continue the digging which we had started the night before. \\n\\n \\n\\n The brigade holding the firing line told us that the enemy were registering their range during the day, and the objective was the trench which we had dug on the previous night.... Then we knew that the work before us was fraught with danger; we would certainly be shelled when operations started. In single file, with rifles and picks over their shoulders, the boys went out into the perilous space between the lines. The night was grey with rain; not a star was visible in the drab expanse of cloudy sky,[30] and the wet oozed from sandbag and dug-out; the trench itself was sodden, and slush squirted about the boots that shuffled along; it was a miserable night. One of our men returned to the post occupied by the stretcher-bearers; he had become suddenly unwell with a violent pain in his stomach. We took him back to the nearest dressing-station and there he was put into an Engineers\u0027 wagon which was returning to the village in which our regiment was quartered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Returning, I went out into the open between the lines. Our men were working across the front, little dark, blurred figures in the rainy greyness, picks and shovels were rising and falling, and lumps of earth were being flung out on to the grass. The enemy were already shelling on the left, the white flash of shrapnel and the red, lurid flames of bursting concussion shells lit up the night. So far the missiles were either falling short or overshooting their mark, and nobody had been touched. I just got to our company when the enemy began to shell it. There was a hurried flop to earth in the newly-dug holes, and I was immediately down flat on my face on top of several prostrate figures, a shrapnel burst in front, and a hail of singing bullets dug into the earth all round. A concussion shell raced[31] past overhead and broke into splinters by the fire trench, several of the pieces whizzing back as far as the working party. \\n\\n \\n\\n There followed a hail of shells, flash on flash, and explosion after explosion over our heads; the moment was a ticklish one, and I longed for the comparative safety of the fire trench. Why had I come out? I should have stopped with the other stretcher-bearers. But what did it matter. I was in no greater danger than any of my mates; what they had to stick I could stick, for the moment at least. \\n\\n \\n\\n The shelling subsided as suddenly as it had begun. I got up again to find my attention directed towards something in front; a dark figure kneeling on the ground. I went forward and found a dead soldier, a Frenchman, a mere skeleton with the flesh eaten away from his face, leaning forward on his entrenching tool over a little hole that he had dug in the ground months before. \\n\\n \\n\\n A tragedy was there, one of the sorrowful sights of war. The man, no doubt, had been in a charge—the French made a bayonet attack across this ground in the early part of last winter—and had been wounded. Immediately he was struck he got out his entrenching tool and endeavoured to dig himself in. A few shovelsful of earth were scooped out when a bullet struck him, and he leaned[32] forward on his entrenching tool, dead. Thus I found him; and the picture in the grey night was one of a dead man resting for a moment as he dug his own grave. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See that dead man?\" I said to one of the digging party. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m! there are hundreds of them lying here,\" was the answer, given almost indifferently. \"I had to throw four to one side before I could start digging!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I went back to the stretcher-bearers again; the men of my own company were standing under a shrapnel-proof bomb store, smoking and humming ragtime in low, monotonous voices. Music-hall melodies are so melancholy at times, so full of pathos, especially on a wet night under shell fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where are the other stretcher-bearers?\" I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ve gone out to the front to their companies,\" I was told. \"Some of their men have been hit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Badly?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No one knows,\" was the answer. \"Are our boys all right?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As far as I could see they\u0027re safe; but they\u0027re getting shelled in an unhealthy manner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ve left off firing now,\" said one of my mates. \"You should\u0027ve seen the splinters coming in here a minute ago, pit! pit! plop![33] on the sandbags. It\u0027s beastly out in the open.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A man came running along the trench, stumbled into our shelter, and sat down on a sandbag. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re the London Irish?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stretcher-bearers,\" I said. \"Have you been out?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My God! I have,\" he answered. \"\u0027Tisn\u0027t half a do, either. A shell comes over and down I flops in the trench. My mate was standing on the parapet and down he fell atop of me. God! \u0027twasn\u0027t half a squeeze; I thought I was burst like a bubble. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Git off, matey,\u0027 I yells, \u0027I\u0027m squeezed to death!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Squeezed to death,\u0027 them was my words. But he didn\u0027t move, and something warm and sloppy ran down my face. It turned me sick.... I wriggled out from under and had a look.... He was dead, with half his head blown away.... Your boys are sticking to the work out there; just going on with the job as if nothing was amiss. When is the whole damned thing to come to a finish?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A momentary lull followed, and a million sparks fluttered earthwards from a galaxy of searching star-shells. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why are such beautiful lights used in the killing of men?\" I asked myself. Above[34] in the quiet the gods were meditating, then, losing patience, they again burst into irrevocable rage, seeking, as it seemed, some obscure and fierce retribution. \\n\\n \\n\\n The shells were loosened again; there was no escape from their frightful vitality, they crushed, burrowed, exterminated; obstacles were broken down, and men\u0027s lives were flicked out like flies off a window pane. A dug-out flew skywards, and the roof beams fell in the trench at our feet. We crouched under the bomb-shelter, mute, pale, hesitating. Oh! the terrible anxiety of men who wait passively for something to take place and always fearing the worst! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stretcher-bearers at the double!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n We met him, crawling in on all fours like a beetle, the first case that came under our care. We dressed a stomach wound in the dug-out, and gave the boy two morphia tablets.... He sank into unconsciousness and never recovered. His grave is out behind the church of Loos-Gohelle, and his cap hangs on the arm of the cross that marks his sleeping place. A man had the calf of his right leg blown away; he died from shock; another got a bullet through his skull, another.... But why enumerate how young lives were hurled away from young bodies?... \\n\\n \\n\\n On the field of death, the shells, in colossal[35] joy, chorused their terrible harmonies, making the heavens sonorous with their wanton and unbridled frenzy; star-shells, which seemed at times to be fixed on the ceiling of the sky, oscillated in a dazzling whirl of red and green—and men died.... We remained in the trenches the next day. They were very quiet, and we lay at ease in our dug-outs, read week-old papers, wrote letters and took turns on sentry-go. On our front lay a dull brown, monotonous level and two red-brick villages, Loos and Hulluch. Our barbed-wire entanglement, twisted and shell-scarred, showed countless rusty spikes which stuck out ominous and forbidding. A dead German hung on a wire prop, his feet caught in a cheval de frise, the skin of his face peeling away from his bones, and his hand clutching the wire as if for support. He had been out there for many months, a foolhardy foe who got a bullet through his head when examining our defences. \\n\\n \\n\\n Here, in this salient, the war had its routine and habits, everything was done with regimental precision, and men followed the trade of arms as clerks follow their profession: to each man was allocated his post, he worked a certain number of hours, slept at stated times, had breakfast at dawn, lunch at noon, and tea at four. The ration parties called on the cave-dwellers with the promptitude[36] of the butcher and baker, who attend to the needs of the villa-dwellers. \\n\\n \\n\\n The postmen called at the dug-outs when dusk was settling, and delivered letters and parcels. Letter-boxes were placed in the parados walls and the hours of collection written upon them in pencil or chalk. Concerts were held in the big dug-outs, and little supper parties were fashionable when parcels were bulky. Tea was drunk in the open, the soldiers ate at looted tables, spread outside the dug-out doors. Over the \"Savoy\" a picture of the Mother of Perpetual Succour was to be seen and the boys who lived there swore that it brought them good luck; they always won at Banker and Brag. All shaved daily and washed with perfumed soaps. \\n\\n \\n\\n The artillery exchanged shots every morning just to keep the guns clean. Sometimes a rifle shot might be heard, and we would ask, \"Who is firing at the birds on the wire entanglements?\" The days were peaceful then, but now all was different. The temper of the salient had changed. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the distance we could see Lens, a mining town with many large chimneys, one of which was almost hidden in its own smoke. No doubt the Germans were working the coal mines. Loos looked quite small, there was a big slag-heap on its right, and on its left was a windmill with shattered wings. We[37] had been shelling the village persistently for days, and, though it was not battered as Philosophé and Maroc were battered, many big, ugly rents and fractures were showing on the red-brick houses. \\n\\n \\n\\n But it stood its beating well; it takes a lot of strafing to bring down even a jerry-built village. Houses built for a few hundred francs in times of peace, cost thousands of pounds to demolish in days of war. I suppose war is the most costly means of destruction. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rumours flew about daily. Men spoke of a big push ahead, fixed the date for the great charge, and, as proof of their gossip, pointed at innumerable guns and wagons of shell which came through Les Brebis and Nouex-les-Mines daily. Even the Germans got wind of our activities, and in front of the blue-black slag-heap on the right of Loos they placed a large white board with the question written fair in big, black letters: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"WHEN IS THE BIG PUSH COMING OFF? \\n\\n WE ARE WAITING.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A well-directed shell blew the board to pieces ten minutes after it was put up. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had a very nice dug-out in these trenches. It burrowed into the chalk, and its walls were as white as snow. When the candle[38] was lit in the twilight, the most wonderfully soft shadows rustled over the roof and walls. The shadow of an elbow of chalk sticking out in the wall over my bed looked like the beak of a great formless vulture. On a closer examination I found that I had mistaken a wide-diffused bloodstain for a shadow. A man had come into the place once and he died there; his death was written in red on the wall. \\n\\n \\n\\n I named the dug-out \"The Last House in the World.\" Was it not? It was the last tenanted house in our world. \\n\\n \\n\\n Over the parapet of the trench was the Unknown with its mysteries deep as those of the grave. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52811.html","bookId":1038,"book":{"id":1038,"title":"The Great Push","description":"简介： The justice of the cause which endeavours to achieve its object by the murdering and maiming of mankind is apt to be doubted by a man who has come through a bayonet charge.
