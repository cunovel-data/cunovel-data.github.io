Three months ago he was allowed to go home and see his wife and to welcome a new Murney into the wurl\u0027. Then in the Loos do the other day he got a bit of shrapnel in his heel and now he\u0027s home again. I don\u0027t seem to be able to get home at all. I wish I had got Murney\u0027s shrapnel in my heel.... I\u0027m sick of the trenches; I wish the war was over.\" \"What were you talking to the Captain about yesterday?\" asked Rifleman Barty, and he winked knowingly. \"What the devil is it to you?\" inquired Flaherty. \"It\u0027s nothin\u0027 at all to me,\" said Barty. \"I would just like to know.\" [232] \"Well, you\u0027ll not know,\" said the Corporal. \"Then maybe I\u0027ll be allowed to make a guess,\" said Barty. \"You\u0027ll not mind me guessin\u0027, will yer?\" \"Hold your ugly jaw!\" said Flaherty, endeavouring to smile, but I could see an uneasy look in the man\u0027s eyes. \"Ye\u0027re always blatherin\u0027.\" \"Am I?\" asked Barty, and turned to us. \"Corp\u0027ril Flaherty,\" he said, \"is goin\u0027 home on leave to see his old woman and welcome a new Flaherty into the world, just like Murney did three months ago.\" Flaherty went red in the face, then white. He fixed a killing look on Barty and yelled at him: \"Up you get on the fire-step and keep on sentry till I tell ye ye\u0027re free. That\u0027ll be a damned long time, me boy!\" \"You\u0027re a gay old dog, Flaherty,\" said Barty, making no haste to obey the order. \"One wouldn\u0027t think that there was so much in you; isn\u0027t that so, my boys? Papa Flaherty wants to get home!\" Barty winked again and glanced at the men who surrounded him. There were nine of us there altogether; sardined in the bay of the trench which the Munster Fusiliers held a few days ago. Nine! Flaherty, whom I knew very well, a Dublin man with a wife in London, Barty a Cockney of Irish descent,[233] the Cherub, a stout youth with a fresh complexion, soft red lips and tender blue eyes, a sergeant, a very good fellow and kind to his men.... The others I knew only slightly, one of them a boy of nineteen or twenty had just come out from England; this was his second day in the trenches. The Germans were shelling persistently all the morning, but missing the trench every time. They were sending big stuff across, monster 9·2 shells which could not keep pace with their own sound; we could hear them panting in from the unknown—three seconds before they had crossed our trench to burst in Bois Hugo, the wood at the rear of our line. Big shells can be seen in air, and look to us like beer bottles whirling in space; some of the men vowed they got thirsty when they saw them. Lighter shells travel more quickly: we only become aware of these when they burst; the boys declare that these messengers of destruction have either got rubber heels or stockinged soles. \"I wish they would stop this shelling,\" said the Cherub in a low, patient voice. He was a good boy, he loved everything noble and he had a generous sympathy for all his mates. Yes, and even for the men across the way who were enduring the same hardships as himself in an alien trench. \"You know, I get tired of these trenches[234] sometimes,\" he said diffidently. \"I wish the war was over and done with.\" I went round the traverse into another bay less crowded, sat down on the fire-step and began to write a letter. I had barely written two words when a shell in stockinged soles burst with a vicious snarl, then another came plonk!... A shower of splinters came whizzing through the air.... Round the corner came a man walking hurriedly, unable to run because of a wound in the leg; another followed with a lacerated cheek, a third came along crawling on hands and knees and sat down opposite on the floor of the trench. How lucky to have left the bay was my first thought, then I got to my feet and looked at the man opposite. It was Barty. \"Where did you get hit?\" I asked. \"There!\" he answered, and pointed at his boot which was torn at the toecap. \"I was just going to look over the top when the shell hit and a piece had gone right through my foot near the big toe. I could hear it breaking through; it was like a dog crunching a bone. Gawd! it doesn\u0027t \u0027arf give me gip!\" I took the man\u0027s boot off and saw that the splinter of shell had gone right through, tearing tendons and breaking bones. I dressed the wound. \"There are others round there,\" an officer,[235] coming up, said to me, I went back to the bay to find it littered with sandbags and earth, the parapet had been blown in. In the wreckage I saw Flaherty, dead; the Cherub, dead, and five others disfigured, bleeding and lifeless. Two shells had burst on the parapet, blew the structure in and killed seven men. Many others had been wounded; those with slight injuries hobbled away, glad to get free from the place, boys who were badly hurt lay in the clay and chalk, bleeding and moaning. Several stretcher-bearers had arrived and were at work dressing the wounds. High velocity shells were bursting in the open field in front, and shells of a higher calibre were hurling bushes and branches sky-high from Bois Hugo. I placed Barty on my back and carried him down the narrow trench. Progress was difficult, and in places where the trench had been three parts filled with earth from bursting shells I had to crawl on all fours with the wounded man on my back. I had to move very carefully round sharp angles on the way; but, despite all precautions, the wounded foot hit against the wall several times. When this happened the soldier uttered a yell, then followed it up with a meek apology. \"I\u0027m sorry, old man; it did \u0027urt awful!\" Several times we sat down on the fire-step and rested. Once when we sat, the[236] Brigadier-General came along and stopped in front of the wounded man. \"How do you feel?\" asked the Brigadier. \"Not so bad,\" said the youth, and a wan smile flitted across his face. \"It\u0027ll get me \u0027ome to England, I think.\" \"Of course it will,\" said the officer. \"You\u0027ll be back in blighty in a day or two. Have you had any morphia?\" \"No.\" \"Well, take two of these tablets,\" said the Brigadier, taking a little box from his pocket and emptying a couple of morphia pills in his hand. \"Just put them under your tongue and allow them to dissolve.... Good luck to you, my boy!\" The Brigadier walked away; Barty placed the two tablets under his tongue. \"Now spit them out again,\" I said to Barty. \"Why?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ve got to carry you down,\" I explained. \"I use one arm to steady myself and the other to keep your wounded leg from touching the wall of the trench. You\u0027ve got to grip my shoulders. Morphia will cause you to lose consciousness, and when that happens I can\u0027t carry you any further through this alley. You\u0027ll have to lie here till it\u0027s dark, when you can be taken across the open.\" Barty spat out the morphia tablets and[237] crawled up on my back again. Two stretcher-bearers followed me carrying a wounded man on a blanket, a most harrying business. The wounded man was bumping against the floor of the trench all the time, the stretcher-bearer in front had to walk backwards, the stretcher-bearer at rear was constantly tripping on the folds of the blanket. A mile of trench had to be traversed before the dressing-station was reached and it took the party two hours to cover that distance. An idea of this method of bringing wounded away from the firing-line may be gathered if you, reader, place a man in a blanket and, aided by a friend, carry him across the level floor of your drawing-room. Then, consider the drawing-room to be a trench, so narrow in many places that the man has to be turned on his side to get him through, and in other places so shaky that the slightest touch may cause parados and parapet to fall in on top of you. For myself, except when a peculiar injury necessitates it, I seldom use a blanket. I prefer to place the wounded person prone on my back, get a comrade stretcher-bearer to hold his legs and thus crawl out of the trench with my burden. This, though trying on the knees, is not such a very difficult feat. \"How do you feel now, Barty?\" I asked my comrade as we reached the door of the dressing-station. [238] \"Oh, not so bad, you know,\" he answered. \"Will the M.O. give me some morphia when we get in?\" \"No doubt,\" I said. I carried him in and placed him on a stretcher on the floor. At the moment the doctor was busy with another case. \"Chummy,\" said Barty, as I was moving away. \"Yes,\" I said, coming back to his side. \"It\u0027s like this, Pat,\" said the wounded boy. \"I owe Corporal Darvy a \u0027arf-crown, Tubby Sinter two bob, and Jimmy James four packets of fags—woodbines. Will you tell them when you go back that I\u0027ll send out the money and fags when I go back to blighty?\" \"All right,\" I replied. \"I\u0027ll let them know.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52828.html","bookId":1038,"book":{"id":1038,"title":"The Great Push","description":"简介： The justice of the cause which endeavours to achieve its object by the murdering and maiming of mankind is apt to be doubted by a man who has come through a bayonet charge.
