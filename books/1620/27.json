His hair fell in a dark, silken curtain around us both, concealing us from sight. He made no move to touch me, or take the amulet. He just stared at me in a way no one had ever looked at me before. It was awe mixed with recognition of elemental power and an overwhelming desire to possess it. I didn’t like his look one bit. I stared back. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a large dust-covered vase on a side table. It wasn’t close enough for me to get my hands on, but I didn’t need my hands to introduce it to the back of Prince Chigaru’s head. It was a pleasant image and I treated myself to a small smile. The goblin misunderstood it entirely. His problem, not mine.\n “It has bonded to you,” he breathed. “The Soul Thief itself shines through your eyes. You glow with the power of death.”\n I recoiled, more from his words than from a Mal’Salin prince only inches from my face.\n There was a scuffle in the shadows, then a grunt as Piaras hurled himself at the goblin prince, taking both of them to the ground in a tangle of limbs. The guards, no longer distracted by their prince’s attention to me, tried to pull Piaras off, only to receive kicks for their trouble. One flick of thought and the vase flew from the table into my hands. It was large and metal and made a satisfying solid sound when it came in contact with the guards’ heads. The wrestling mass parted briefly and I was rewarded with a clear shot at Prince Chigaru’s shoulder. It wasn’t the body part I had in mind, but I wasn’t in a position to be picky, so I took it. The doors crashed open and more goblins poured into the room—armed goblins who weren’t happy to find their prince on the floor. Armored hands slammed me back into my chair, and a sword point made sure I stayed there. Piaras was jerked upright, both arms wrenched behind his back.\n The prince stood and slowly wiped blood from his lip. His eyes were blazing. Piaras didn’t flinch or look away.\n Prince Chigaru addressed the guards. “Secure our guests in the room upstairs, post guards, then report back to me.”\n Chapter 11\n The door closed and locked behind us. The lock sounded all too substantial, and the footsteps of our guards didn’t fade away down the corridor as I’d hoped, but not really expected. Prince Chigaru’s guards were following his orders to the letter. I was considered too valuable right now.\n We were in what had probably been a guest bedroom. It had been finely appointed in its day. Now, the brocade upholstery was threadbare, the velvet bed hangings thin and tattered, and the heavy smell of damp and mildew hung in the air. There were a few other pieces of furniture, but most were covered with dingy sheets, dust, or both. Two lamps had been lit on the mantle, but the fireplace was dark and cold, as was the room. The only other source of light came from a sliver of moonlight peeking through a pair of etched glass doors.\n I made my way around the room, knocking on walls, checking for hidden doors. All activities anyone watching would expect of a new prisoner. My stroll ended at the glass doors. They led out onto a small balcony, and were locked, but the lock could be easily picked. Another Benares family talent. It also had other attractions. I moved on, not wanting to draw attention to our most likely exit. Apparently Prince Chigaru hadn’t planned too far ahead for holding prisoners. Lucky for us. It was probably also the reason why we were being held in the same room. Lucky for me. I didn’t want to escape only to have to search for and free Piaras.\n When I had looked down into the garden, I saw that our host had made up for any oversight. Five armed Mal’Salin royal guards were posted below to make sure things didn’t get interesting. I didn’t sense any surveillance in the room itself, but there would probably be someone watching or at least listening to us soon. There were too many places in the wall that would perfectly conceal a pair or two of prying eyes. But I wasn’t going to wait around for them to arrive. I was going to remove us from Prince Chigaru’s royal hospitality as soon as possible.\n The prince assumed that between the guards and The Ruins, that I would be disinclined to try to escape. My first rule was never assume. This went nicely with my second rule—always try to escape. While I occasionally failed at the first, I had always succeeded in the second. Tonight wasn’t going to be an exception.\n Piaras was standing perfectly still in the center of the room by a settee at the foot of the canopied bed. While this sort of thing didn’t happen to me all the time, it wasn’t exactly a rare occurrence. But I thought I could safely assume that Piaras had never been taken prisoner by Mal’Salin royal guards, led bound and blindfolded through The Ruins at night, threatened with torture by a goblin prince, then topped off the evening by attacking the aforementioned royal. I felt my lips curl into a quick grin. Come to think of it, those were all firsts for me, too.\n Piaras was watching me, his liquid brown eyes wide and intent. I knew he was probably scared to death, and with good reason. Prince Chigaru wasn’t happy with him, and I know the guards he kicked were less than amused. Piaras was still alive because the prince thought he could use him to compel me to find the Saghred for him. And he was right. I wouldn’t allow them to hurt Piaras. That left one option: get out of here as quickly as possible. I went to the settee and sat down, motioning to Piaras to sit beside me. We were facing the outer wall. No one could be watching from there and reading lips. Then I used my version of the spell Garadin used last night to keep Piaras from overhearing our conversation. If anyone was spying on us, I was going to make them work for it.\n Piaras sat, opened his mouth to say something, then stopped. I think he was more than a little overwhelmed. I was feeling a little that way myself.\n I took his hand and gave it a light, reassuring squeeze. “I’m not happy here either,” I said in the barest whisper, my lips close to his ear. “Don’t worry, we won’t be staying long.”\n “How?”\n “Through the glass doors. There’s a trellis on the outside wall that should hold our weight.”\n “Are there any guards?” he asked.\n That question surprised me. Good. He may be scared, but he was keeping his wits about him.\n “Five.”\n He started to stand, probably to take a look for himself. I tightened my grip on his hand.\n “Someone could be watching. Let’s not give ourselves away yet.”\n He sat back down and drew a deep breath. It shuddered as he exhaled. Probably the first good one he’d had since we were brought here. The hand I held trembled slightly, as did the shoulder touching mine.\n “I’m sorry,” he finally managed.\n “For what?”\n “For being worthless.”\n I just sat there for a moment, waiting for that one to make sense. It didn’t. “Where did you get that idea?”\n “I haven’t done anything. All night, I haven’t done anything to help.”\n “What do you call what you did downstairs?”\n “Stupid. I just made things worse. I could have gotten us both killed.”\n No, just you, I thought. Prince Chigaru needed me—at least for now. I didn’t say that out loud, but I’m sure Piaras was well aware of how close he had come. Besides, he was feeling bad enough.\n “It was a little impulsive, but you were just trying to protect me.” I draped a sisterly arm around his shoulders, and gave him a quick hug. “It was also very brave. There just happened to be a couple dozen goblins on the other side of the door when you did it. Not your fault.” I tried to give him a smile. “Neither one of us was hurt, so don’t worry about it.”\n He looked down at the floor. “I wasn’t brave; I was scared.”\n “You were scared and you still attacked the prince to protect me.” I grinned. “Sweetie, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but that’s called brave.”\n He looked up. “It is?”\n “If you weren’t scared and attacked the prince, that’d make you suicidal and a couple of other things you don’t want to be.”\n Piaras almost smiled. “Thanks. Though none of this would have happened if I hadn’t gotten myself caught.”\n “True,” I admitted. “But they wouldn’t have been after you to begin with if the prince hadn’t wanted me. So all this is my fault. If there’s any apologizing to be done, it should come from me.” I tried a weak grin and another hug. “Sorry.”\n He tried a grin of his own. His didn’t make it either. “It’s okay.”\n “No, it’s not. But it will be.”\n I had an idea, and if it worked, it would not only get us out of this room, but it would go a long way toward giving Piaras back some of his self-respect.\n “So, how are your sleep spellsongs coming?” I asked casually.\n I felt his hand go ice cold beneath mine, and his shoulders went rigid. He knew exactly what I had in mind. So much for the no-pressure approach.\n “I can’t put five goblins to sleep!”\n “Ssshhh!”\n “I can’t!” he mouthed.\n “Can’t or just never tried?” I stopped. That was stupid of me. When would he have had a chance to put goblin guards to sleep? Garadin said Piaras had the gift, and I had seen proof firsthand, though not to the extent I was asking. Trial by fire wasn’t the best kind of final exam, but we didn’t have any other options available.\n “Do you need to see your subject while you work?” I made my voice all business and no doubt.\n Piaras had his face in his hands, his elbows resting on his knees. He glanced sideways at me and gave a single shake of his head. I couldn’t help but notice that he looked a little pasty.\n “Good,” I said, trying to sound encouraging. “You can do this.”\n “How do you know?” He sounded as close to miserable, and sick, as possible.\n “I don’t.” I wasn’t going to be anything other than totally honest with him. He deserved that much. Besides, he would know if I was lying to him, and that would ruin any chance of this working. “But Garadin does, and I trust Garadin. He said he’s never seen anyone with such a powerful gift.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-lost-trouble-found-raine-benares-1/page-27.html","bookId":1620,"book":{"id":1620,"title":"Magic Lost, Trouble Found (Raine Benares #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Magic Lost, Trouble Found (Raine Benares #1) \n A girl with attitude.
