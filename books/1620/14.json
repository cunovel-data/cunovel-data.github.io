My recommendation should at least get the boy an audition before classes start next term. Though I’m not worried. Once Ronan hears Piaras, he’ll accept him. But I wanted to wait until I’d heard back before I wrote to his parents—or got the boy’s hopes up.”\n An audition was more than most got. Garadin once told me that Ronan Cayle thought nothing of keeping hopeful students cooling their heels at the base of his tower for a year or more. Since most of those students had ambitions to match their egos, they tolerated the wait. I couldn’t see Piaras in that kind of company. I knew talent like his didn’t belong behind the counter at an apothecary shop, and I certainly couldn’t see him working for a noble family singing lullabies to spoiled children, or for a pock-faced lord, singing love songs beneath some noble lady’s window in his stead. Yeesh. It wasn’t like I’d never see Piaras again. The Isle of Mid wasn’t far, and my family had plenty of ships—some of which could still venture into Mid’s harbor without inviting cannon fire.\n Piaras came out of the shop carrying a bag in one hand and a half-eaten sugar knot in the other. My stomach growled in response to the sweet, buttery smell. Piaras heard and grinned crookedly.\n “Me, too.” He popped another knot into his mouth. “Sorry I didn’t wait,” he said around a mouthful. He opened the bag. “As long as we leave a couple for Grandma, I don’t see why we shouldn’t have some.”\n Garadin and I fell to without further encouragement.\n Mintha Row, where Tarsilia’s apothecary shop was located, was off the beaten path enough that for the most part, the only people who see me are those I trusted to see me. But this morning I wasn’t going to take any chances. Like Garadin, I valued my privacy. Also like Garadin, I tended to attract undesirable elements who didn’t care that I’d rather not have anyone lying in wait for me when I got home.\n We slipped off Casin Street, quickly crossed a footbridge across a sluggish back canal and ducked into the alley that ran behind Mintha Row. When I’m not feeling particularly sociable, I’ve found this is the best way to get home. At least it lessens the opportunity for ambush. The alley was narrow and Tarsilia kept it completely clear. If you had to fight your way home, the fewer obstacles in your way, the better. What few windows looked out over the alley lacked the proper angle to get a crossbow bolt or thrown knife into a target. Perfect for a girl just wanting to get home after a long night out.\n Or for your mage landlady to wait for you.\n Tarsilia Rivalin stood just inside the open back door to her shop, my black and white cat Boris cradled comfortably in her arms. Boris liked Tarsilia more than he did me, but then he saw Tarsilia more, and to my knowledge, she’d never almost set him on fire. The elven mage and my cat looked at me with similar expressions in their leaf green eyes. I don’t think anything I do shocks either one of them. But then it would take a lot to shock them both. Tarsilia was like a lot of people I knew in the Sorcerers District—people who had a past, and just preferred it stayed there.\n Piaras gave his grandmother a light kiss on the cheek and darted past her into the shop before she could stop him. I knew I wouldn’t escape questioning so easily, but then neither would he. Tarsilia would corner him later.\n Tarsilia was older than Garadin. How much older, I didn’t know, and I’d never seen the need to ask. I did know that I’d be happy if I aged half as well. Slender, fine boned, with barely any wrinkles visible in a still-flawless complexion, Tarsilia must have been drop-dead gorgeous in her younger days. She still turned heads of all ages. Must be a Rivalin family trait.\n She took note of my blood-stained clothing. “Busy night?”\n “You could say that. Piaras said you had visitors.”\n “I didn’t have visitors,” she said. “You did. No one got in, but it wasn’t for lack of trying.”\n What my visitors had wanted wasn’t in my rooms, but that didn’t keep me from not wanting them there. On the rare occasion an intruder has been more persistent than my wards were powerful, nothing and no one has ever gotten past Tarsilia. She may be small, she may be old, but I wouldn’t cross her.\n “Are Alix and Parry still here?” Garadin asked.\n “They just left,” Tarsilia told him, turning to go inside. Her silvery hair swung in a practical braid down the length of her back. “Alix has to open her shop in a few hours, and since she’s been on shaman watch all night, she wanted to get some rest.”\n Garadin and I followed her. I closed the door, latched it, and passed a hand over the lock to reactivate Tarsilia’s wards. Someone who trusts you enough to have you know their wards trusts you a lot. My movement wasn’t lost on her.\n “Feeling a little skittish?” She took a not so delicate sniff. “I guess goblin blood does that to a person.”\n “And goblin shamans on your doorstep.”\n “Open your cloak. Let’s see how bad it is.”\n I did as told.\n “Any of that yours?” she asked.\n “No.”\n Tarsilia dumped Boris on a nearby chair and pulled a burlap sack from under her worktable. She tossed it to me. “When you go upstairs to clean up, put any clothes you can’t salvage in that. My last shipment of newtwort came in it. The stink from that will cover up anything. Tom’s coming by this afternoon to pick up some things I need for him to burn. He’ll dispose of it.”\n I just loved her. “Thank you, Tarsilia.”\n She shrugged off my sentiment. “Can’t have you leaving evidence lying around for the next goblins who pay us a visit to find.”\n “Hopefully there won’t be any more.”\n “You holding your breath on that?”\n “Not really.”\n “Good. I’d hate to see you disappointed.”\n She shut the door leading into the shop. She needn’t have bothered. Piaras already had a pretty good idea of what was going on.\n Her green eyes leveled on me. “Now what are Khrynsani shamans doing visiting you at nearly two in the morning?”\n “I have something they want.”\n “Is it in your rooms?”\n “No.”\n “Do you have it on you?”\n “Yes.”\n “Do you want to give it to them?”\n “I can’t.”\n “Then you have a problem.”\n I had to agree with her on that one. “Yes, I do.”\n “Want to tell me about it?”\n I thought for a moment. The last thing I wanted to do was drag everyone I cared about into the mess I found myself in. The fewer people who were in this with me, the better. Piaras knew some of it, but not enough to get him into trouble. But what little Piaras knew, Tarsilia would soon know. A Conclave inquisitor was nothing compared to Tarsilia when she felt she ought to know something. She was relentless. On the other hand, she might be able to help. Like most mages in the District, Tarsilia had a Conclave background and had spent more than her share of time on the Isle of Mid in her younger days. She didn’t talk about it much, but I know she didn’t learn to fight dirty behind an apothecary’s counter.\n “Don’t worry about me getting myself hurt,” Tarsilia told me, as if reading my mind. She probably had. “I’ve survived a long time stepping in things I should’ve stayed away from. I’ve just made more enemies tonight. Those Khrynsani know where I live. If they want me, they know where to find me.”\n That statement would concern me coming from almost anyone else. But Tarsilia wasn’t anyone else. If the shamans were smart, they wouldn’t come back.\n “And if I’m lucky, they’ll give me another chance,” she said with an evil little smirk.\n Or if they were suicidal.\n “She’s just not a good tenant to have, Tarsilia,” Garadin said. He grinned and draped an arm around my shoulders. “You should have evicted her long ago. Better yet, you should have never let her in to begin with.” He planted a light kiss on the top of my head. I detected pride in his voice. “She’s bad to know and worse to be around.”\n “Of course she is,” my landlady retorted. “Why do you think I like the girl? When you get to be my age, you take your excitement any way you can get it. Having Raine around keeps me from getting slow.” She turned back to me. “You sure you don’t want to tell me what’s going on?”\n I sighed and pulled the amulet out of my shirt. The metal was warm and smooth beneath my fingers, almost as if it were trying to make up for its behavior last night. I dropped it against my shirt. I wasn’t buying.\n Tarsilia reached for the amulet. I pulled back.\n “You don’t want to do that,” Garadin warned her.\n “Why not?”\n Garadin and I held up our bandaged hands.\n Tarsilia lowered her own hand. “Good reason.”\n She settled for a close study. I turned it so she could see both sides. It behaved itself perfectly.\n “Not much to look at, is it?” she finally said.\n “It’s not my usual taste in jewelry.”\n “How did you come by it?”\n I gave her the short version of last evening’s events. I was getting better at it with each retelling.\n “If they’re after this, they’ll definitely be back,” Tarsilia said when I’d finished.\n I felt a small surge of hope. “You know what it is?”\n “Not a clue.”\n Hopes dashed. “Thanks.”\n “It was obviously made to do something,” she said. “It certainly isn’t attractive enough to wear for any other reason. Considering the lengths those who want it are willing to go to get it, I’d say it has a more practical purpose. You’re sure you can’t take it off?”\n “Not if I want to continue breathing. Meaning if anyone takes the amulet, they have to take me along with it. And I don’t plan on going anywhere with anyone I ran into last night.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-lost-trouble-found-raine-benares-1/page-14.html","bookId":1620,"book":{"id":1620,"title":"Magic Lost, Trouble Found (Raine Benares #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Magic Lost, Trouble Found (Raine Benares #1) \n A girl with attitude.
