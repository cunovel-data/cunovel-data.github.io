{"id":17102,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII.","content":"The calm monotony of Tuen\u0027s life continued uninterrupted after the episode with the sailor. She would talk with Wang for hours, of the kind friends she had left in the Viceroy\u0027s yamen, and again of that secluded court to which she went, concerning which many marvellous stories were told throughout the land; and at other times she would sit spellbound for half a day, listening to the long-spun-out stories of blind Szu. They were now in the Imperial Canal, that stupendous monument of man\u0027s ingenuity, for on account of the work and the time required to complete them, it and the Great Wall stand unrivalled by any effort of man in any other part of the[Pg 166] world. The waters of the canal were clearer than those of the great river they had left, but there was the same press of boats, their number greatly augmented by the many grain-junks that bear the tribute of rice to Peking. It was also a thrilling experience to Tuen to see the boats pass the sluices, where the waters raged as if waiting for something to suck down into their turbulent depths. The small boats darted through the openings without hindrance, but the larger ones must get through by a tedious and somewhat dangerous process, and often it would make Tuen shudder to watch them. The cumbrous barges would first be dragged forward slowly, by means of ropes attached to large windlasses and worked from the bank, while against the sides of the pier were arranged cushions of rope to lighten any shock received. Thus were the boats carefully let over, so that they could proceed on their way. When they[Pg 167] reached the temple of the Dragon King, who is the special ruler of the waters, the loud firing of crackers came from all the boats, while libations were poured out, and many strings of gilt paper burned in honor of this terrible god of the waters. Tuen, who was by nature most devout, and stood in wholesome fear of the gods, took great pleasure in these ceremonies, and lit incense sticks until the huge porcelain bowl she had selected for this purpose was filled with ashes. Satisfied with her devotions, she made herself comfortable on many cushions and sent for Szu to attend her at once. When he had seated himself, and she waited for him to begin, he pursed up his mouth reflectively, and then smiled. Perhaps because still somewhat offended by her doubts of the truthfulness of the narrative of Woo How, or perchance because he wished her to know that few women had been both wise and good, he said in a half-scornful way: \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 168] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is another female whose name is written in history. Would you like to hear of her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very much,\" Tuen answered, quickly. \"Wang, put him in that shady corner, where the sun will not touch him, and Ta-ta, if you can remain quiet, you too may stay and listen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No one else has any chance to talk when Szu is around,\" Ta-ta grumbled. \\n\\n \\n\\n The old story-teller turned his face toward her, and asked, scornfully: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who would listen to the babble of a woman? None but a fool, if there were others talking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am waiting on you,\" Tuen interposed, knowing by experience that when Szu and Ta-ta commenced an interchange of courtesies, the tongues of both were loosed in a startling manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n Szu cleared his throat impressively, and began his narrative by saying: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are no stories worth the [Pg 169]telling save those found in the books of the sages, for it is only the ancients who possessed all goodness and learning. Therefore when we of this later day wish to know anything we must turn to them. They have left us all that is necessary for us to know, and their maxims are the perfect rule of life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Having delivered himself of this preamble, he continued: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To-day will I tell you the story of Ta-ke the wife of Chow, in proof that one woman can ruin a nation. It is said that she was beautiful, and certain it is that the Emperor loved her well, but it is, alas! true that her heart was base. He built for her a palace, more beautiful than any ever seen before. It was all of gold and silver and ivory, and the roof was bright as the sun. He placed within it rich carvings, and porcelains of queerest shapes, and the most wonderful flowers in all the earth. And those who[Pg 170] made the works of art to adorn her palace were killed, that the secret might die with them. And women worked from moon to moon, embroidering the hangings for this stately home erected to please the fancy of Ta-ke, and the looms throughout the Empire were busy weaving rich stuffs for her apparel. The choice fruits of the land were brought to tempt her palate, the daintiest dishes served on golden platters were put before her, and the sound of music was never hushed in the palace. With all these things to give her happiness, this, the most favored of females, was not satisfied, and her cruel nature would not be lulled to sleep. She loved to see the torture applied to those who had done no crime, and she laughed and turned away from the prayers that were addressed to her by the poor and the oppressed of the kingdom. And Chow, because he listened to her, was likewise cruel and vile.[Pg 171] What can the people hope when they have such rulers? They could only endure and wait. At last the venerable uncle of this misguided Emperor spoke boldly to him of his evil ways, that he, being warned, might not continue in his baseness, and he told him how the subjects cried out in their just anger against him. Very wroth was Chow with his aged relative, and, going to Ta-ke, he repeated to her the words of reproof to which he had been forced to listen. When he had finished she only laughed in a mocking way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027True he is wondrous wise,\u0027 she cried. \u0027His heart must be made in a different pattern from that of his countrymen, to hold so much knowledge. Methinks I should like to have it cut from his body that I might gaze upon it and see wherein the heart of a sage differs from that of other men.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027And you shall see it before the sun[Pg 172] sets,\u0027 the besotted sovereign cried, and turning to an attendant he gave orders that at once the heart of this good man should be brought to Ta-ke. These and many other wicked things she did, until the people scarce could breathe, so full were they of hate of her. Then a deliverer was found, and the brave Woo Wang came to save the country. With the noise of drum, and amid the swift-falling arrows that carried death where\u0027er they fell, he marched on the resplendent capital of Chow, and the down-trodden people ran forward to welcome him and gladly followed him, until his hosts were far-extending as the clouds. When Chow heard this he went out to marshal his armies that he might repulse these valiant men, but not one was found to wield the bow and arrow in behalf of his Emperor, for all were making ready to greet the good Woo Wang. Already he heard the tramp of the oncoming[Pg 173] throng and the victorious shouting of the warriors, and knew his doom had come, for none would strike a blow to save this tyrant. Quickly he went to the inner room of his palace, arrayed himself in his most magnificent apparel, and donned his tunic of golden brocade, as if to give audience to some mighty prince, and making himself a throne of his most costly possessions he mounted it, and with his own hand touched it with a torch. So perished Chow, and thus was destroyed that most magnificent palace, the wonder of the land. Ta-ke watched him calmly as he made these final preparations, and she shed no tears, for her heart was busy forming a plan where by she might save herself from the wrath of Woo Wang. When she saw the flames burst forth, she ran with all the haste that terror lends away from the fatal spot, and even as she ran she met the great Woo Wang coming with his[Pg 174] soldiers to take possession of the palace, and she cast herself at his feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It is the hated Empress,\u0027 the people cried angrily, groaning as they spoke, and when he heard this Woo Wang waited not, but with his own hand severed the head of the base Ta-ke from her body, that she might not longer live to curse the land; and all the multitude raised a loud shout of joy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s a very ugly tale,\" Ta-ta exclaimed, stifling a yawn as she spoke. \"It was nothing but kill—kill—kill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You gave us the best first,\" Wang said, as she rose to go, but Tuen made no comment of any kind. Side by side she stored these two stories in her mind, and never did she forget them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2709/74518.html","bookId":1440,"book":{"id":1440,"title":"Tuen, Slave and Empress","description":"简介： This story is founded upon facts in the life of the Empress-dowager of China, the mother of the present Emperor....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2709","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:06 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:06 AM"}}
