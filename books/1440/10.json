{"id":17093,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX.","content":"By the time the festival of Pai-shan came—the day when all go to worship at the graves of their ancestors—Tuen had already commenced to struggle with the queer, sprawling hieroglyphics that fill the Chinese books, and she was so proud and happy that she could think of nothing else. The Viceroy was going in state to honor his forefathers, riding in his sedan, and followed by a long retinue of servants, and Tuen, Wang and Ta-ta had been allowed, as a special favor, to join this procession. As they left the yamen Tuen was telling them of the wonderful characters she was trying to understand, and of the delight of learning about them, and Ta-ta laughed good-naturedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was very silly of you to beg such a favor of the Viceroy,\" she said. \"Who ever heard of a woman who could read, or who even wanted to? Why did you not ask him for a silk dress, or for a pair of gold ear-rings? That would have been much more sensible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want anything in the world but to be learned like a man,\" Tuen announced, \"and I will be too, even if I am a woman\"; and she set her lips firmly together. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never knew of a girl being allowed to study before,\" Wang said. \"The Viceroy is truly a wonderful man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Women are not born to be happy any where,\" Ta-ta remarked. \"Tuen will find that out some day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, the consolation is that we don\u0027t have to be women always,\" Wang said philosophically. \"Buddha said that we who, while on earth, were obedient to our husband and his relatives, would some[Pg 87] day come back to earth a man. That is something to look forward to. Yesterday I went to the temple and carried the money I had saved and gave it to the priest, that he might pay the toll for me at the bridge that leads to the spirit-land; and I also gave him the fee for the ferryman, and a lot of cash for that greedy one that rows the dragon-boat across the lake of blood. Now I have nothing to fear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you can kill yourself any day,\" Ta-ta whispered enviously. \\n\\n \\n\\n While they talked they were making their way through the babbling throng that filled the streets, and as they were but seldom allowed to leave the Viceroy\u0027s residence they were looking about them with the keenest pleasure. Hanging from the low tiled roofs of the houses were branches of willow, the mourning tree of the dead, and a vast concourse of people in holiday attire were either going or returning from[Pg 88] the \"worship at the hills\"; for on this day all the population steal a few hours from the daily routine of drudgery, and go to render homage to the spirits of their dead. Their gods were shadowy and unreal, perhaps had no existence save in the imagination of the priests, but their own dear ones they knew lived and went away. Why might not their souls, wandering in the unknown, look back to earth and listen to the prayers of mortals? So they reasoned, and this was why that on this sunny spring day the hills where the dead slept were thronged with the living. An endless procession passed in and out of the gates of the city, the square battlements and watch-towers were deserted, and upon the great stone bridge that spanned the water, the throng surged ever backward and forward. Little groups were gathered around many of the graves, busily sweeping and repairing them; the smoke of incense curled upward on every[Pg 89] side, and prayers arose, not for the repose of the dead, but for the welfare of the living; while strips of gay paper fluttering around some of the headstones told that here the usual rites had been performed and the family had gone home to enjoy the social feast with which the holiday closes. Before one of the tombs, far more pretentious than any of its neighbors, the Viceroy stopped and alighted from his sedan. \\n\\n \\n\\n His forefather had evidently been some high mandarin, for a stone wall surrounded a large, horse-shoe shaped enclosure, and in this teeming land, where earth was so precious that only a little portion could be allotted to a few of the living, it was a sign of great wealth to have so much space for an ancestor. Standing at the entrance to this grave were two stone horses, saddled and bridled, ready to bear the spirit on its journey in the other world, and a little[Pg 90] distance away two rudely sculptured lions kept watch over the tomb. At the end of the enclosure and opposite the entrance, was the tablet bearing the name of the departed, and before this the Viceroy knelt down. First he offered the five-fold sacrifice, consisting of a fowl, a fish, a pig, a bird, and a goose, with many prostrations and petitions, then he placed before the tablet five plates filled with fruit, and five cups of wine. This done, he lit the incense sticks, and knocking his head nine times upon the ground, prayed for the three great blessings,—riches, honor, and long life. Rising, he fastened long streamers of red and white paper at the back of the wall, holding it in place by the customary three pieces of turf, and again entered his sedan. His servants meanwhile carefully packed the offerings of fruit, meats, and wine in the baskets to take home, for they were far too frugal to permit such things to go to[Pg 91] waste, and that very night these same provisions would be served at the Viceroy\u0027s table. \\n\\n \\n\\n As the high magistrate and his attendants wended their way home, Ta-ta who had been quiet for some time, turned to Tuen with a friendly piece of advice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You had better put all this nonsense about books, and being learned like a man, out of your little head, else no man will want to marry you, and you must remember that you are getting old enough now to think about having a mother-in-law.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want one ever,\" Tuen declared. \"I would much rather just belong to the Viceroy always.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How stupid you are,\" Ta-ta said impatiently. \"Of course you must be sold to someone. I never knew a woman over fifteen who did not have a mother-in-law.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Tuen cried pleadingly to Wang: \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 92] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t let them sell me again. Indeed, indeed, I don\u0027t want to have any other master.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am afraid someone will see you and want to marry you, and if they offer him a good price the Viceroy will not be a fool and refuse it,\" Wang said sadly. \"You are getting to be a woman now, and you are good to look at, and for that reason someone is sure to want you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This prospect filled Tuen with dismay, and that night she cried herself to sleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2709/74509.html","bookId":1440,"book":{"id":1440,"title":"Tuen, Slave and Empress","description":"简介： This story is founded upon facts in the life of the Empress-dowager of China, the mother of the present Emperor....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2709","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:06 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:06 AM"}}
