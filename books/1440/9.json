{"id":17092,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII.","content":"\"The Viceroy has sent for you,\" was the message that caused Tuen to leap to her feet with a cry of joy. \n \n \"He has returned from the temple and is in the audience hall, where he has been receiving calls from all the high authorities of the city. Now he is alone, and wishes to speak with you,\" the servant further volunteered. Tuen did not wait to hear more, but hastened to obey the summons, though she paused outside of the Viceroy\u0027s door for a few minutes in order to calm herself, for she was quite breathless. Then she slipped in, and saw him sitting before a table, wearing the superb tunic she had made, and clad in robes of more gorgeous splendor than[Pg 77] she had ever seen him wear. \"Kungli! Kungli! Oh, great and glorious one!\" she murmured low, saluting him, and then with a proud flush upon her face she listened to his words of praise. \n \n Now it so happened that on this auspicious occasion the Viceroy was in a most gracious mood. He had received many magnificent offerings from his people, a bevy of his friends had called to wish him happiness, and said many flattering things. On the table before him was a great heap of large red cards containing good wishes for his continued prosperity, and the Viceroy felt that he had just cause to feel satisfied, for surely he was favored by the gods. When he had complimented Tuen upon the beauty of her needle-work, not forgetting to praise her faithfulness and her industry, he added kindly: \n \n \"What would you like me to give you, as a reward for your work, Tuen?\" She[Pg 78] made no answer, for although she had expected this question, and had long ago decided upon the very words she would say in reply, now that the time had come her lips were dumb. \n \n \"Speak! What is it?\" he insisted, but still she hesitated. \n \n He looked at her half-impatiently, and then he saw her round, rosy face, her lustrous, pleading eyes, and her trembling little mouth, and, his humor changing, he smiled encouragingly. \n \n Tuen, seeing this, threw herself at his feet and cried out impetuously: \n \n \"O wisest and best among men, I would like to learn to read.\" \n I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN TO READ \n \n \"What?\" he ejaculated so sharply that her new-found courage instantly deserted her, and she hid her face, and wondered at her own audacity. \n \n In truth the Viceroy was not so much displeased as he was astonished, for he had never dreamed of such a strange[Pg 79] request, and could hardly believe his ears. \n \n \"You, a girl, learn to read!\" he finally exclaimed contemptuously. \"What nonsense! You couldn\u0027t learn if you tried. You haven\u0027t sense enough.\" \n \n \"Indeed, I think I have,\" she said in a tearful voice, \"and I do so want to know about things.\" \n \n \"There is no one to teach you,\" he answered shortly. \"Go back to your sewing, your gossip among the women, and know that it was for that you were made, else had you been born a man.\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t help what I was born,\" she sobbed. \"The gods made me a woman, and I just have to make the best of it.\" \n \n \"Umph!\" the magistrate grunted, watching her keenly from beneath his drooping lids, and something told Tuen that her reply had pleased him, so now she arose to her feet, and entreated softly: \n \n \"Be not angry with Tuen. Remember[Pg 80] you told her to make her wish known to you, and this was the one, the only desire of her heart. Everything else that she could want you have given her.\" \n \n \"Your request has been most strange,\" he replied, somewhat mollified; and noticing this difference in his tone she persisted. \n \n \"If the master is great the servant should also aspire, that he may be worthy to serve such a master. (For this was a speech she had heard her father make, and had remembered.) Is not that true, O Wise ruler of the province of Kiangsi?\" \n \n \"Truly for a woman she has some wit,\" he told himself; and after considering a moment he said to her: \n \n \"Answer me three questions, and if your words are wise your request shall be granted.\" \n \n \"I will try,\" she replied quietly, but she grew very pale. \n \n \"Well, first, why do you wish to learn[Pg 81] to read?\" he inquired, assuming a judicial air, and Tuen felt that he was laughing at her, but that knowledge only made her the more determined to gain her point. \n \n \"That I may be wise, and therefore good, and being both of these the better able to serve the Viceroy,\" she answered with a low bow. \n \n He nodded his head approvingly. \n \n \"I would let all of my servants learn if they would make that use of it,\" he said. \"For one that knows nothing your answer is not altogether foolish. Now tell me what gods are the most to be feared?\" \n \n \"It would seem to me—perhaps because I am a woman—that it is the household gods who are the most to be dreaded,\" she said hesitatingly. \n \n \"Why?\" he questioned. \n \n \"Because both man and woman must needs live in the house, and if peace and prosperity reign there they will have [Pg 82]happiness. If not, all is confusion and terror.\" \n \n But as she spoke she watched him fearfully, as if half afraid he would be offended. \n \n But he answered: \"Your reason is good, for peace in the house is indeed the greatest blessing. Now one more question and I am done. Of all living creatures which would you like to be?\" \n \n \"A man, Oh, learned sir,\" she said promptly, \"since he alone of all creatures has been given wisdom. And if further choice were given me I would like to be the Viceroy of Kiangsi, since he is the wisest and best of men.\" \n \n \"Well said, well said,\" he exclaimed; for, like some other great ones of whom we have heard, he was not averse to flattery. And thus on him did Tuen use some of that diplomacy for which she one day would be celebrated. \n \n \"You have spoken wisely,\" he [Pg 83]continued, \"and if there can be found in Lu Chang one who will teach you, by the gods you shall learn to read. I, the Viceroy, have said it.\" \n \n Uttering many profuse thanks Tuen prostrated herself before him, for in this land where females were ofttimes drowned like kittens at their birth, or if allowed to live, despised and beaten, sold as mere chattels, or even killed if disobedient to the husband\u0027s parents, the patience of the Viceroy was indeed marvellous, and the permission she had wrested from him was much to be wondered at. \n \n As soon as she had left his presence she ran to find Wang, and throwing herself in the arms of this faithful friend she sobbed: \n \n \"Oh, Wang, Wang, I am to be taught to read. The Viceroy has said it.\" \n \n \"Taught to read?\" Wang repeated blankly. \n \n \"Yes, to read,\" Tuen cried. \"I begged[Pg 84] it of him, and at first he would not, and then he finally consented, and oh, Wang, I feel as if I should die for joy.\" \n \n \"I am sure I don\u0027t know what you want to read for,\" said the puzzled Wang, \"but I do know that there is not another master in all China who would have granted such a favor to a slave. You are a lucky girl to have been bought by him, for he is the kindest man in the land. Any one else would have beaten you for asking such a thing. You had better pray to the gods every day that you shall always belong to him.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2709/74508.html","bookId":1440,"book":{"id":1440,"title":"Tuen, Slave and Empress","description":"简介： This story is founded upon facts in the life of the Empress-dowager of China, the mother of the present Emperor....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2709","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:06 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:06 AM"}}
