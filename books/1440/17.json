{"id":17100,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVI.","content":"\"The rascal, it was just what he deserved,\" Wang cried hotly, and Tuen, her eyes shining like stars, said softly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It seems almost too wonderful to be true.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stranger things happen than have ever been told,\" Szu replied. \"The affairs of life are past finding out, and who Tên Wang leads must follow, whether he will or not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This Woo How was very lucky,\" Tuen murmured. \"She must have been loved by the gods.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, I have not yet done speaking of her,\" Szu answered. \"Much yet remains.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 150] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can there be anything to tell after she was married?\" Tuen inquired incredulously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There comes the amazing part,\" Szu acknowledged. \"It happened just as the Emperor had wished, that his bride proved as wise as she was beautiful, and soon she was not only beloved, but feared by every one. In court circles you will find out for yourself that an ounce of fear is worth a pound of love. When the lovely Woo How discovered this truth she became a power in the land—but not until then. As she grew older her beauty decreased, it is true, but her power increased, and on the death of the Emperor it was this same Woo How who set aside his lawful successor and became the Empress and sole ruler of this great country.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is but a play you are repeating to me,\" Tuen cried scornfully. \"It was not and could not be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Youth does not know all things,\" the[Pg 151] old story-teller answered in an offended tone. \"A few gems of thought, a few pearls of knowledge are reserved for age. That is its compensation. I have repeated to you the true account of Woo How. That she lived and reigned and died Confucius has told, therefore I would believe it though the daughters of a thousand Viceroys should dispute it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I was mistaken about it being only a tale if you learned it from the Sacred Books, Szu,\" Tuen answered. \"But since I know that, I like it all the better. Now let us hear what else befell this most fortunate one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps it would not interest you,\" he said somewhat sullenly. \"Sufficient be it that being of a strong mind she had long controlled her husband, and even before his death she it was who in truth ruled the land. When she had seated herself upon the throne she was so well versed in the affairs of state that she[Pg 152] governed with much discretion and ability.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Here the garrulity of the old man gained the mastery over his anger, and he went on in his usual rapid, animated way: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Great was Woo How of the dynasty of Tang. She sent her powerful armies out to battle, and the enemies fled before them like the birds before the storm. The proud Thibetans ran like the deer, leaving behind the unnumbered dead. Thick fell the arrows around them! Loud sounded the gongs of the hosts! Shrill was the battle-cry and loud the shouts of victory! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And none could stand before the warriors of Woo How. Their journey was marked by the flames of burning towns, captives followed behind them, their groanings shaking the earth, when back to the court came the army of Woo How. Then she marshalled them again, and[Pg 153] sent them forth against the rebellious Khitans, and again did they return with conquering footsteps, bringing vast treasures and slaves, that reached on, on, like the waves of the ocean. Peace reigned after this, and prosperity walked abroad, and after twenty-two glorious years Woo How drove the fairy chariot and went the long journey.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When he finished speaking, Wang was loud in her praises of the pleasing narrative, but Tuen locked her hands around her knees and sat silent, looking out over the throng of boats around her. Szu waited expectantly for some remarks and some questions from her, but when she did not speak, he lit his pipe and smoked away vigorously. \\n\\n \\n\\n The afternoon was now drawing to a close. A blue haze crept over the distant landscape and smoothed out all ugliness, and made the scene soft and pleasing, and even the incessant cries of the boatmen[Pg 154] sounded less shrill. Tuen got up and walked about on the cramped deck, for she was weary with long sitting, but she was blind and deaf to all that went on. Wang was trying to engage Szu in conversation, but he only pulled his bamboo cap farther over his staring eyes, and did not answer, and finally, she gave up in despair and went within. After a while, Tuen came back and, squatting down on a silken cushion beside Szu, said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Could a woman have done what that Woo How did?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He removed the pipe from his mouth, and turned his face toward her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The sages have told you so,\" he replied, shortly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that,\" she said, impatiently, \"but what I mean is, could it ever happen again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He screwed up his mouth, and repressed a smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As long as women are born it could[Pg 155] happen, I suppose, and there is as yet no dearth of females.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are laughing at me!\" she cried, flushing angrily. \"I asked you a civil question. Why should you make sport of me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Now he smiled, openly, at her evident vexation, but he said, gravely: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you are born great, you will be great, no matter if you be man or woman, no matter when you live or where, but the great ones of earth are few and far between. Some who were not born great, have, by hard work and much patience, attained to it. But a woman is usually a stupid thing, and her head is much too light for climbing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she were very wise, could she have power, even in the Forbidden City?\" Tuen persisted. \\n\\n \\n\\n He nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she were very wise, she would have power, it makes no difference where she[Pg 156] lived. Even on a desert island she would have power over the wild beasts, for knowledge is power the world over. It is because females do not possess it that they are weak and of little repute. When they become wise they will rule the earth, for a man is but clay in the hands of a skilful woman. She pats him into whatever shape she wants him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I would like to be wise and great,\" Tuen said, with a sigh. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2709/74516.html","bookId":1440,"book":{"id":1440,"title":"Tuen, Slave and Empress","description":"简介： This story is founded upon facts in the life of the Empress-dowager of China, the mother of the present Emperor....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2709","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:06 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:06 AM"}}
