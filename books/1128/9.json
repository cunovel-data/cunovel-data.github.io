{"id":22826,"no":9,"title":"VIII. THE BLUE CHEST.","content":"On leaving the Bouncing Betsey, Mr. John Randall, the estimable mate of that vessel, bent his steps towards a shop devoted to sailors\u0027 clothing ready-made, with a large variety of other articles such as seamen are accustomed to require. \n \n It was a shop of very good dimensions, but low studded and rather dark, the windows, which were few, being in part covered up by articles hung in front of them. \n \n The proprietor of this establishment was Moses Mellen, a little Jew, with a countenance clearly indicating his Israelitish descent. His small black eyes sparkled with the greed of gain, and he had a long, hooked nose like the beak of a bird, which would not have been[73] considered too small an appendage for a face of twice the size. He had one qualification for a successful trader—he seldom or never forgot a face which he had once seen. \n \n Rubbing his hands with a great show of cordiality, and with his face wreathed in smiles, the instant he espied Randall he hastened to meet him. \n \n \"Delighted to see you, Mr. Randall,\" he exclaimed; \"perhaps I ought to say Captain Randall.\" \n \n \"Not yet.\" \n \n \"Ah well, that will come soon. I hope you have had a prosperous voyage.\" \n \n \"Tolerably so, Mr. Mellen.\" \n \n \"Have you just arrived in the city, or have you been here for some time?\" \n \n \"Three weeks only, and now I am off again. We sailors don\u0027t have a chance to stop long on dry land, Mr. Mellen.\" \n \n \"Not if they are such capital sailors as my friend, Mr. Randall. But where are you bound this time?\" \n \n \"Probably to Valparaiso.\" \n \n \"Anywhere else?\" \n \n [74] \n \n \"Perhaps so. We may go to the Indies or Sandwich Islands before we return.\" \n \n \"A long voyage,—you will need to be fitted out before you start,—don\u0027t you want something in my line? I sha\u0027n\u0027t want much profit out of an old friend like you.\" \n \n This, by the way, was what Moses said to pretty much all his customers. \n \n \"I shall want a few things. I will pick them out now.\" \n \n \"This way, then.\" \n \n Randall followed the proprietor to the back of the store, where he selected a variety of articles, which he ordered sent on board the Bouncing Betsey immediately. \n \n \"Now,\" said the mate, after his own purchases were completed, \"I shall require a small outfit for a boy who is going out with us.\" \n \n \"If you had brought him with you we could have furnished him at short order.\" \n \n \"There was one little difficulty in the way of my doing that.\" \n \n \"Eh?\" \n \n \"He doesn\u0027t know he is going.\" \n \n [75] \n \n \"Ah ha!\" said the Jewish dealer, putting one scraggy finger to the side of his nose with a knowing look; \"that\u0027s it, is it?\" \n \n \"I see you comprehend. Now tell me what shall we do about fitting him?\" \n \n \"If I could only see him——\" \n \n \"You could judge by your eye what would be likely to fit him. Is that what you would say?\" \n \n \"Precisely.\" \n \n \"And how long would you require to look at him?\" \n \n \"Two minutes would answer.\" \n \n \"Very well; I will call with the boy in the course of an hour or two. By the way, I shall want a small chest to put the articles in. You keep them, of course?\" \n \n \"A great variety.\" \n \n \"I dare say you will suit me. A very plain one will answer. Have your bill made out for the other articles, and I will discharge it.\" \n \n With a profusion of bows and thanks, the trader dismissed his customer. \n \n The mate now betook himself to the hotel where he had engaged Charlie to meet him at[76] eleven o\u0027clock. Charlie, who was always punctual to his appointments, had already arrived, and was looking over a newspaper in the reading-room. \n \n \"So you are on hand, my boy,\" said Randall, in a friendly manner. \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n \"I am glad to find you punctual. Are you ready to set out?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir, quite ready.\" \n \n Rather to keep up the boy\u0027s delusion as to his designs, Randall suffered Charlie to guide him to one or two places of public interest, with which he was already more familiar than his guide, and then suddenly proposed that they should go down to the wharves. \n \n \"You must know, my lad,\" said he, \"that I am a sailor.\" \n \n \"I thought so, sir.\" \n \n \"What made you think so?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know, sir; but I can generally tell a sailor.\" \n \n \"Perhaps I haven\u0027t got my sea-legs off. However, as I was saying, I am an officer on board a ship lying at the wharf, and I have[77] just thought of a bundle I want brought from the ship. If you will go with me and fetch it, I will pay you at the same rate I promised you for going about with me.\" \n \n Of course Charlie had no objections. In fact, although he had been on board ships at the wharf, he had never been in company with an officer, and he thought it possible his companion might be willing to explain to him the use of some parts which he did not yet understand. Accordingly he gave a ready assent to the mate\u0027s proposition, and together they took their way to Long Wharf, at which the ship was lying. \n \n The shop kept by the Jew was, as a matter of convenience and policy, located near the wharves. It was not a general clothing-store, but specially designed to supply seamen with outfits. \n \n \"I have a little errand here,\" said Randall, pausing before the shop of Moses Mellen. \n \n \"I can stop outside,\" said Charlie. \n \n \"You had better come in. You will see where we sailors get our clothing.\" \n \n Not suspecting any sinister design in this[78] invitation, Charlie accepted it without more ado, and followed Randall in. He looked about him with some curiosity, not observing that he too was an object of attention to the Jewish dealer, whose quick eye detected their entrance. \n \n He went forward to meet Randall. \n \n \"You see the boy, do you?\" asked the mate, in a low voice. \n \n \"Is that the one?\" \n \n \"Yes. Do you think you will be able to fit him?\" \n \n \"No doubt about it, though he is a little smaller than the boys we usually fit out.\" \n \n \"Never mind if the clothes are a little large. He\u0027ll be sure to grow to them, and a precise fit isn\u0027t quite so important on the quarter-deck as it might be on Washington Street. We are not fashionable on board the Betsey, Mr. Mellen.\" \n \n The dealer laughed, showing some yellowish tusks, which were evidently not supplied by the dentist. \n \n \"Have you made out my bill?\" \n \n \"Here it is.\" \n \n [79] \n \n \"While I am looking over it, will you pick out such clothes as the boy will need?\" \n \n Darting a hasty glance at Charlie, to make sure of his size, the dealer hurried to the rear of the shop, and commenced selecting articles which he laid away in a small blue chest. \n \n The task was soon completed, and again he came out to the front part of the store. \n \n \"All ready!\" he said, in a low voice to Randall. \n \n \"You have been quick. Here is the amount of your bill. As to the chest, you may send it on board the Bouncing Betsey without any unnecessary delay.\" \n \n \"It shall be done, Mr. Randall. Have you no further commands for us?\" \n \n \"I believe not, to-day.\" \n \n \"You will remember our shop when you are round again?\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t forget you.\" \n \n \"You needn\u0027t accompany me to the door, nor allude to my voyage,\" said Randall, in a low voice, to the dealer. \"Remember, I have him with me.\" \n \n Moses winked in a manner which by no[80] means improved the expression of his not very agreeable features. \n \n \"Now, my lad,\" said Randall, \"we\u0027ll go on board the vessel. Have you ever been on board a ship?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir, a good many times by myself, but I never had any one to tell me the different parts.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll promise, then,\" said the mate, in a tone whose significance was lost upon our hero at the time, though he afterwards recalled it, \"that you shall know more about a vessel before you leave this one.\" \n \n \"I thank you,\" said Charlie, considering the offer a kind one. \n \n They ascended the ladder and jumped upon the deck of the vessel, which, though Charlie knew it not, was to be his home for many a weary day. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1752/51199.html","bookId":1128,"book":{"id":1128,"title":"Charlie Codman\u0027s Cruise","description":"简介： This scarce antiquarian book is a selection from Kessinger Publishing\u0027s Legacy Reprint Series.
