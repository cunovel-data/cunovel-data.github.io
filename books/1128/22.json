{"id":22839,"no":22,"title":"XXI. THE PIRATE SHIP.","content":"\"How did you know she was a pirate?\" inquired Charlie. \"I suspected her in the first place, from her rakish look. All pirate ships, you know, are made for speed. Besides, this particular ship had been described to me by a messmate who had once been on board a ship that was chased by her, though, luckily, before the pirate had a chance to overhaul her, two other vessels came in sight, and frightened her away. \"As soon as I made out the approaching vessel to be the Red Rover, I repented bitterly the signs by which I had drawn her attention. I ceased making signals, but it was too late. She had already seen me, and a boat was filling with men to take me on board. Finding I could not well help myself, I concluded to make the best of it, and not show any objection to going with the boat\u0027s crew. So when they came near, and hailed me, asking me who I was, I answered as[180] heartily as I could, \u0027Bill Sturdy, of the good ship Peregrine, bound for Havana.\u0027 \"\u0027And what\u0027s become of your ship?\u0027 \"\u0027Gone to the bottom,\u0027 I answered. \"\u0027How long since?\u0027 \"\u0027About twenty-four hours.\u0027 \"\u0027How did it happen?\u0027 \"In reply, I told all the circumstances, without reserve, for concealment would have done no good. \"There was a little consultation on board the boat, and then the officer in command brought it up alongside my hen-coop, and ordered me aboard. \"This I did with as much alacrity as possible, and I tell you, my lad, it did seem good once more to be in a boat, even though it belonged to a pirate, after pitching about on a hen-coop for twenty-four hours. \"Now that I had a chance, I looked at the men that manned the boat. They were villainous-looking cutthroats—mostly Spaniards, with dark, lowering faces and forbidding expressions. I couldn\u0027t help turning it over in my mind, what they would be likely to do with me. [181] \"It didn\u0027t take long to reach the pirate vessel. Those on board pressed forward, as I came up and got on deck. They were all pretty much alike. The captain was a large, stout, muscular man, though I believe,\" added Bill, with some complacency, \"that I could have got the better of him in a regular rough-and-tumble fight. However, this isn\u0027t neither here nor there. He came up to me, and made me answer over again the same questions which had been asked me before. I answered them in the same way. After he had got through with his questions, he fixed his sharp, black eyes on me, and inquired, \u0027Do you know the name of the ship that has picked you up?\u0027 \"\u0027I do,\u0027 said I, coolly, though I didn\u0027t feel as cool as I appeared. \"\u0027Ha!\u0027 he exclaimed, in surprise. \u0027What is it?\u0027 \"\u0027It is the Red Rover,\u0027 said I, making believe to be unconcerned. \"\u0027And are you acquainted with its character?\" said the captain, with another of his sharp looks. \"\u0027I believe so,\u0027 said I. [182] \"\u0027Name it.\u0027 \"\u0027I think it is a pirate,\u0027 said I, not moving a muscle. \"\u0027Ha!\u0027 he exclaimed, looking at me rather curiously. \u0027Are you not afraid to find yourself on board a pirate?\u0027 \"\u0027Why should I be?\u0027 I answered. \u0027But for you, I should have died on the hen-coop, and I suppose, if you had meant to take away my life, you wouldn\u0027t have taken the trouble to save me, since death was certain.\u0027 \"\u0027A bold fellow!\u0027 said the captain, aside, to the mate. He spoke in the Spanish language, but I had managed to pick up some odd phrases in that lingo, so I knew what he was driving at. The mate seemed to agree, and they talked a little more. I didn\u0027t understand, but guessed it was about me. \"The pirate captain, after a short confab with the mate, turned round, and spoke to me. \u0027Well, my man,\u0027 said he, \u0027I don\u0027t mind telling you that you\u0027ve hit the mark in guessing that this is the Red Rover, and a pirate. I believe she has made something of a reputation for herself,\u0027 he added, proudly. [183] \"I bowed. \"\u0027Now I have a proposal to make to you. We\u0027re rather short-handed. We need two or three brave fellows, and I am inclined to think, from your bearing, that you will suit us. Now, if you would like it, you shall be admitted to equal privileges with the rest of the crew, with an equal share of whatever booty we manage to pick up, and that I may tell you, is not small. Here, Roderigo, step forward, and tell this man how much your share was last year.\u0027 \"Roderigo, a villainous-looking fellow, stepped forward, and answered, \u0027Nearly two thousand dollars in goods and money.\u0027 \"\u0027You see, then, what are the inducements. Will you join us or not?\u0027 \"Now I very well knew what the consequences of my refusal would be, so I replied, without a moment\u0027s hesitation, \u0027I will.\u0027\" \"What, did you become a pirate?\" asked Charlie, horror-struck. \"Pretty much in the same way that you became a sailor, my lad; because I couldn\u0027t help it.\" [184] \"And did you join in robbing vessels, and killing all on board?\" \"Hold on, my lad; you\u0027re a little too fast for me. You\u0027ll know in due time. The pirate captain seemed pleased with my promptness, and made me sign the book. I should have given a wrong name, only I had given the right one when I was hailed, though, for that matter, Sturdy isn\u0027t my right name. The captain told me, in a very polite sort of way, that if I should undertake to play them false, or interfere with them in any way, I should be pitched overboard. As this threat did not seem to trouble me much, he seemed to be satisfied that it was all right with me. In the course of a day or two, I got acquainted with the crew. They were mostly Spaniards, but there was a sprinkling of other nations,—French, Danes, Germans, and one Englishman.\" \"Were there any Yankees?\" \"No, I\u0027m proud to say there wasn\u0027t one except myself, and I wasn\u0027t there of my own free will. Piracy doesn\u0027t chime in with our Yankee notions, and it\u0027s my belief you\u0027ll find[185] precious few full-blooded Yankees that are engaged in the business.\" \"How did you get out of their clutches?\" asked Charlie. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m coming to by and by. For a few days we didn\u0027t meet a vessel, or, at least, one that was alone, and so would do to attack. I was glad of that, for I was ready enough to do my duty on board the ship, but I knew that, just as soon as we met a vessel, I should be expected to do my share of the fighting, and it went against my grain to engage in any such villainous business as that. However, I thought I wouldn\u0027t borrow trouble, but wait till it came, and then I could decide what to do. \"At last I heard the cry I so much dreaded, \u0027Sail ho!\u0027 from one of the crew, who had been sent aloft to give notice of an approaching vessel. \"\u0027Where away?\u0027 shouted the pirate captain. \"\u0027To the eastward.\u0027 \"Orders were at once given to change the course of the vessel, and to make for the[186] stranger. As soon as she saw us she made every effort to get away, but the Red Rover was too swift for her. When we got within a short distance, I made out the vessel to be the Sally Ann, which had left port about the time the Peregrine did. I knew some of those on board very well, and the captain was an old school-mate of mine. \"\u0027What would they think,\u0027 I couldn\u0027t help saying to myself, with a groan, \u0027if they knew their old messmate was regularly enrolled among the crew of the pirate that is overhauling them?\u0027\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1752/51212.html","bookId":1128,"book":{"id":1128,"title":"Charlie Codman\u0027s Cruise","description":"简介： This scarce antiquarian book is a selection from Kessinger Publishing\u0027s Legacy Reprint Series.
