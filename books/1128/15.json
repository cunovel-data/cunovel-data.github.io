{"id":22832,"no":15,"title":"XIV. BERT.","content":"In the breakfast-room of a house on Mt. Vernon Street sat two persons with whom it is necessary that we should become acquainted. \n \n The first is a gentleman of perhaps forty-five, rather stout, and with a pleasant expression of countenance. He has finished his cup of coffee, and taken up the morning paper,[126] which he scans carefully, more especially those parts relating to business. \n \n At the opposite side of the table is a young lady of ten, with mirthful black eyes, and very red cheeks, which are well set off by her black hair. Altogether, she is very handsome, a fact of which she is not altogether unconscious. She is lively, fresh, original, and impulsive, not under very much restraint, but with an excellent disposition and kindly feelings, which do not allow her to go very far wrong. Yet it must be confessed that thus far her education has been sadly neglected, so that, as far as learning goes, she probably knows less than most girls two years younger. \n \n The room, in which the father and daughter were seated, is tastefully furnished with that regard to comfort which is found in our American houses. \n \n The two whom we have thus introduced are Benjamin Bowman, a wealthy merchant, and his daughter Bertha, though, in that shortening of names which is apt to take place in a family, hers has been shortened to Bert,[127] which she appears to prefer to the longer and more strictly feminine name. \n \n \"Papa,\" she said, pushing away her plate, \"you ain\u0027t good company at all.\" \n \n \"Thank you for the compliment, Bert,\" he said. \n \n \"But you\u0027re not, though. There you are wearing out your eyes over that stupid paper, and leaving me to talk to myself or Topsy. Here, Topsy, isn\u0027t it so?\" \n \n At this summons a kitten, black as the ace of spades, and very much addicted to fun and frolic, jumped into the lap of her young mistress, and purred a noisy acquiescence. \n \n \"There,\" said Bert, triumphantly, \"Topsy says I am right. I don\u0027t know what I should do without Topsy.\" \n \n \"She makes a very suitable companion for you, Bert,\" said Mr. Bowman, smiling. \n \n \"Why?\" asked the cat\u0027s mistress, suspiciously. \n \n \"Because you can sympathize so well. Both are equally mischievous, and it is very difficult to tell which knows the most of books.\" \n \n [128] \n \n \"Now, papa, that is a slander. I will sue you for libel.\" \n \n \"On your own account, or the kitten\u0027s?\" asked Mr. Bowman. \"I really don\u0027t know which I have done injustice to.\" \n \n \"Now you are laughing at me, papa. I know you are.\" \n \n \"Not entirely, Bert. The fact is, you are terribly ignorant for one of your age.\" \n \n \"I suppose I am,\" said Bert, shaking her head in comic despair. \n \n \"You\u0027ll grow up with no more knowledge than a Hottentot.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t they have any schools among the Hottentots?\" \n \n \"I suppose not.\" \n \n \"How delightful that must be! Why can\u0027t we move out where they live?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know but we shall have to,\" said her father, \"as, hereabouts, young ladies are expected to know something about books. But that reminds me I don\u0027t know but I shall succeed in engaging a governess for you to-day.\" \n \n [129] \n \n \"A governess to-day!\" exclaimed Bert, in dismay. \n \n \"Yes. I have made an appointment with a lady to call here at nine o\u0027clock, and, if I am satisfied with her, I intend to engage her.\" \n \n \"And if I am satisfied with her,\" added Bert. \n \n \"Is that essential?\" asked her father, smiling. \n \n \"Yes, for you know she will be with me most of the time. If she is like Julia Campbell\u0027s governess, I sha\u0027n\u0027t like her.\" \n \n \"Well, and what fault do you find with Julia Campbell\u0027s governess?\" asked Mr. Bowman, with more interest than his tone conveyed; for he knew that if Bert did not fancy her governess she would be a most incorrigible little rebel, and would be likely to profit very little by her instructions. \n \n \"Oh, she\u0027s as disagreeable as she can be. In the first place, she\u0027s an old maid,—not that that\u0027s so very bad. In fact, I\u0027ve about made up my mind to be an old maid myself.\" \n \n [130] \n \n \"Indeed!\" said Mr. Bowman, amused. \"May I inquire your reasons?\" \n \n \"Too numerous to mention.\" \n \n \"Perhaps one is, that you don\u0027t expect to have any chance to change your name.\" \n \n \"I have had a chance already,\" said Bert, in a matter-of-fact tone. \n \n \"Had a chance already!\" exclaimed her father, in amazement. \n \n \"Yes,\" said the young lady of ten, \"Charlie Morrill offered himself the other day, and I refused him.\" \n \n \"What is the world coming to?\" thought Mr. Bowman. \"Why did you refuse him?\" \n \n \"Because,\" said Bert, soberly, \"I don\u0027t like the way he parts his hair. But as for Julia\u0027s governess, I know she never had an offer. She\u0027s as homely as—as—well, I don\u0027t know who. Then she wears glasses, and has a nose ever so long, and a long face, and she never smiles, and she makes Julia study terrible hard.\" \n \n And Bert drew a long breath. \n \n \"Not a very charming picture, certainly,\" said Mr. Bowman; \"but I\u0027ll promise you that,[131] if the lady who applies for the post of governess to-day should be anything like this, I won\u0027t engage her.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s right, papa. When do you expect her?\" \n \n \"Let me see. She was to be here at nine, and now it wants only ten minutes of that time.\" \n \n \"And you won\u0027t send me out of the room, papa, will you?\" \n \n Mr. Bowman hesitated. \n \n \"You know I am very anxious to see how she looks. If I like her, I will make a sign to you, and then you can engage her.\" \n \n \"What sign will you make, Bert?\" asked her father, amused, and yet alive to the necessity of securing his daughter\u0027s acquiescence in his choice. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Bert, reflecting; \"suppose I wink.\" \n \n \"And suppose the lady should see you winking at me? What do you suppose she would think?\" \n \n \"Oh, I could tell her afterwards, you[132] know, and she would feel flattered, knowing it was a sign that I liked her.\" \n \n \"She might not think it very lady-like in you.\" \n \n \"What\u0027s the use of being lady-like? I don\u0027t want to be. There\u0027s Florence Gates; I suppose she\u0027s lady-like. I\u0027ll show you how she walks.\" \n \n Bert imitated the gait of the young lady, swaying herself from side to side, as she walked with mincing step, tossing her head, and exhibiting a caricature of the airs and affectations which girls sometimes delight to display. \n \n \"Why, she wouldn\u0027t run for a thousand dollars,\" exclaimed Bert. \"She would think it beneath her dignity. If she is lady-like, I don\u0027t want to be. But, hark! there goes the bell. She\u0027s coming. Now, papa, just remember, I shall wink if I like her, and if I don\u0027t I\u0027ll make up a face.\" \n \n Bert transferred herself to an ottoman, and took Topsy into her lap. \n \n Both she and her father looked towards the door with curiosity. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1752/51205.html","bookId":1128,"book":{"id":1128,"title":"Charlie Codman\u0027s Cruise","description":"简介： This scarce antiquarian book is a selection from Kessinger Publishing\u0027s Legacy Reprint Series.
