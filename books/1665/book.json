As a Luxen, an alien life form on Earth, human girls are…well, fun. But since the Luxen have to keep their true identities a secret, falling for one would be insane. \\n Dangerous. Tempting. Undeniable. \\n Bethany can’t deny the immediate connection between her and Dawson. And even though boys aren’t a complication she wants, she can’t stay away from him. Still, whenever they lock eyes, she’s drawn in. \\n Captivated. Lured. Loved. \\n Dawson is keeping a secret that will change her existence...and put her life in jeopardy. But even he can’t stop risking everything for one human girl. Or from a fate that is as unavoidable as love itself.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shadows-lux-0.jpg","author":"Jennifer L.
