{"id":15916,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11 The Tower of Cirith Ungol","content":"Sam roused himself painfully from the ground. For a moment he wondered where he was, and then all the misery and despair returned to him. He was in the deep dark outside the under-gate of the orcs\u0027 stronghold; its brazen doors were shut. He must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against them; but how long he had lain there he did not know. Then he had been on fire, desperate and furious; now he was shivering and cold. He crept to the doors and pressed his ears against them. Far within he could hear faintly the voices of ores clamouring, but soon they stopped or passed out of hearing, and all was still. His head ached and his eyes saw phantom lights in the darkness, but he struggled to steady himself and think. It was clear at any rate that he had no hope of getting into the orc-hold by that gate; he might wait there for days before it was opened, and he could not wait: time was desperately precious. He no longer had any doubt about his duty: he must rescue his master or perish in the attempt. \u0027The perishing is more likely, and will be a lot easier anyway,\u0027 he said grimly to himself, as he sheathed Sting and turned from the brazen doors. Slowly he groped his way back in the dark along the tunnel, not daring to use the elven-light; and as he went he tried to fit together the events since Frodo and he had left the Cross-roads. He wondered what the time was. Somewhere between one day and the next, he supposed; but even of the days he had quite lost count. He was in a land of darkness where the days of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered were forgotten too. \u0027I wonder if they think of us at all,\u0027 he said, \u0027and what is happening to them all away there.\u0027 He waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to Shelob\u0027s tunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of March in the Shire-reckoning. And even now Aragorn was leading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry was riding with the Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to Frodo and Sam. They were not forgotten. But they were far beyond aid, and no thought could yet bring any help to Samwise Hamfast\u0027s son; he was utterly alone. He came back at last to the stone door of the orc-passage, and still unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it, he scrambled over as before and dropped softly to the ground. Then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of Shelob\u0027s tunnel, where the rags of her great web were still blowing and swaying in the cold airs. For cold they seemed to Sam after the noisome darkness behind; but the breath of them revived him. He crept cautiously out. All was ominously quiet. The light was no more than that of dusk at a dark day\u0027s end. The vast vapours that arose in Mordor and went streaming westward passed low overhead, a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow of red. Sam looked up towards the orc-tower, and suddenly from its narrow windows lights stared out like small red eyes. He wondered if they were some signal. His fear of the orcs, forgotten for a while in his wrath and desperation, now returned. As far as he could see, there was only one possible course for him to take: he must go on and try to find the main entrance to the dreadful tower; but his knees felt weak, and he found that he was trembling. Drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns of the Cleft before him, he forced his unwilling feet to obey him, and slowly, listening with all his ears, peering into the dense shadows of the rocks beside the way, he retraced his steps, past the place where Frodo fell, and still the stench of Shelob lingered, and then on and up, until he stood again in the very cleft where he had put on the Ring and seen Shagrat\u0027s company go by. There he halted and sat down. For the moment he could drive himself no further. He felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took one step veritably down into the land of Mordor, that step would be irrevocable. He could never come back. Without any clear purpose he drew out the Ring and put it on again. Immediately he felt the great burden of its weight, and felt afresh, but now more strong and urgent than ever, the malice of the Eye of Mordor, searching, trying to pierce the shadows that it had made for its own defence, but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt. As before, Sam found that his hearing was sharpened, but that to his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. The rocky walls of the path were pale, as if seen through a mist, but still at a distance he heard the bubbling of Shelob in her misery: and harsh and clear, and very close it seemed, he heard cries and the clash of metal. He sprang to his feet, and pressed himself against the wall beside the road. He was glad of the Ring, for here was yet another company of orcs on the march. Or so at first he thought. Then suddenly he realized that it was not so, his hearing had deceived him: the orc-cries came from the tower, whose topmost horn was now right above him, on the left hand of the Cleft. Sam shuddered and tried to force himself to move. There was plainly some devilry going on. Perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the orcs had mastered them, and they were tormenting Frodo, or even savagely hacking him to pieces. He listened; and as he did a gleam of hope came to him. There could not be much doubt: there was fighting in the tower, the orcs must be at war among themselves, Shagrat and Gorbag had come to blows. Faint as was the hope that his guess brought him, it was enough to rouse him. There might be just a chance. His love for Frodo rose above all other thoughts, and forgetting his peril he cried aloud: \u0027I\u0027m coming, Mr. Frodo!\u0027 He ran forward to the climbing path, and over it. At once the road turned left and plunged steeply down. Sam had crossed into Mordor. He took off the Ring, moved it may be by some deep premonition of danger, though to himself he thought only that he wished to see more clearly. \u0027Better have a look at the worst,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027No good blundering about in a fog!\u0027 Hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze. Before his feet the highest ridge of the Ephel Dúath fell steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trough, on the further side of which there rose another ridge, much lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out black against the red light behind them: it was the grim Morgai, the inner ring of the fences of the land. Far beyond it, but almost straight ahead, across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires, there was a great burning glow; and from it rose in huge columns a swirling smoke, dusty red at the roots, black above where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in all the accursed land. Sam was looking at Orodruin, the Mountain of Fire. Ever and anon the furnaces far below its ashen cone would grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing pour forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides. Some would flow blazing towards Barad-d?r down great channels; some would wind their way into the stony plain, until they cooled and lay like twisted dragon-shapes vomited from the tormented earth. In such an hour of labour Sam beheld Mount Doom, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of the Ephel Dúath from those who climbed up the path from the West, now glared against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched with blood. In that dreadful light Sam stood aghast, for now, looking to his left, he could see the Tower of Cirith Ungol in all its strength. The horn that he had seen from the other side was only its topmost turret. Its eastern face stood up in three great tiers from a shelf in the mountain-wall far below; its back was to a great cliff behind, from which it jutted out in pointed bastions, one above the other, diminishing as they rose, with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north-east and south-east. About the lowest tier, two hundred feet below where Sam now stood, there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court. Its gate, upon the near south-eastern side, opened on a broad road, the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a precipice, until it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness to join the road that came over the Morgul Pass. Then on it went through a jagged rift in the Morgai out into the valley of Gorgoroth and away to Barad-d?r. The narrow upper way on which Sam stood leapt swiftly down by stair and steep path to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to the Tower-gate. As he gazed at it suddenly Sam understood, almost with a shock, that this stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of Mordor, but to keep them in. It was indeed one of the works of Gondor long ago, an eastern outpost of the defences of Ithilien, made when, after the Last Alliance, Men of Westernesse kept watch on the evil land of Sauron where his creatures still lurked. But as with Narchost and Carchost, the Towers of the Teeth, so here too the vigilance had failed, and treachery had yielded up the Tower to the Lord of the Ringwraiths, and now for long years it had been held by evil things. Since his return to Mordor, Sauron had found it useful; for he had few servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from Mordor. Though if an enemy were so rash as to try to enter that land secretly, then it was also a last unsleeping guard against any that might pass the vigilance of Morgul and of Shelob. Only too clearly Sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down under those many-eyed walls and pass the watchful gate. And even if he did so, he could not go far on the guarded road beyond: not even the black shadows, lying deep where the red glow could not reach, would shield him long from the night-eyed orcs. But desperate as that road might be, his task was now far worse: not to avoid the gate and escape, but to enter it, alone. His thought turned to the Ring, but there was no comfort there, only dread and danger. No sooner had he come in sight of Mount Doom, burning far away, than he was aware of a change in his burden. As it drew near the great furnaces where, in the deeps of time, it had been shaped and forged, the Ring\u0027s power grew, and it became more fell, untameable save by some mighty will. As Sam stood there, even though the Ring was not on him but hanging by its chain about his neck, he felt himself enlarged, as if he were robed in a huge distorted shadow of himself, a vast and ominous threat halted upon the walls of Mordor. He felt that he had from now on only two choices: to forbear the Ring, though it would torment him; or to claim it, and challenge the Power that sat in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows. Already the Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason. Wild fantasies arose in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of Barad-d?r. And then all the clouds rolled away, and the white sun shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be. In that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to hold him firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain hobbit-sense: he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him. The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to command. \u0027And anyway all these notions are only a trick,\u0027 he said to himself. \u0027He\u0027d spot me and cow me, before I could so much as shout out. He\u0027d spot me, pretty quick, if I put the Ring on now, in Mordor. Well, all I can say is: things look as hopeless as a frost in spring. Just when being invisible would be really useful, I can\u0027t use the Ring! And if ever I get any further, it\u0027s going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step. So what\u0027s to be done?\u0027 He was not really in any doubt. He knew that he must go down to the gate and not linger any more. With a shrug of his shoulders, as if to shake off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms, he began slowly to descend. With each step he seemed to diminish. He had not gone far before he had shrunk again to a very small and frightened hobbit. He was now passing under the very walls of the Tower, and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard with his unaided ears. At the moment the noise seemed to be coming from the court behind the outer wall. Sam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway into the red glow there came two orcs running. They did not turn towards him. They were making for the main road; but even as they ran they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still. Sam had seen no arrows, but he guessed that the orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in the shadow of the gate. He went on, hugging the wall on his left. One look upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it. The stone-work rose thirty feet, without a crack or ledge, to overhanging courses like inverted steps. The gate was the only way. He crept on; and as he went he wondered how many orcs lived in the Tower with Shagrat, and how many Gorbag had, and what they were quarrelling about, if that was what was happening. Shagrat\u0027s company had seemed to be about forty, and Gorbag\u0027s more than twice as large; but of course Shagrat\u0027s patrol had only been a part of his garrison. Almost certainly they were quarrelling about Frodo, and the spoil. For a second Sam halted, for suddenly things seemed clear to him, almost as if he had seen them with his eyes. The mithril coat! Of course, Frodo was wearing it, and they would find it. And from what Sam had heard Gorbag would covet it. But the orders of the Dark Tower were at present Frodo\u0027s only protection, and if they were set aside, Frodo might be killed out of hand at any moment. \u0027Come on, you miserable sluggard!\u0027 Sam cried to himself. \u0027Now for it!\u0027 He drew Sting and ran towards the open gate. But just as he was about to pass under its great arch he felt a shock: as if he had run into some web like Shelob\u0027s, only invisible. He could see no obstacle, but something too strong for his will to overcome barred the way. He looked about, and then within the shadow of the gate he saw the Two Watchers. They were like great figures seated upon thrones. Each had three joined bodies, and three heads facing outward, and inward, and across the gateway. The heads had vulture-faces, and on their great knees were laid clawlike hands. They seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of stone, immovable, and yet they were aware: some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them. They knew an enemy. Visible or invisible none could pass unheeded. They would forbid his entry, or his escape. Hardening his will Sam thrust forward once again, and halted with a jerk, staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head. Then greatly daring, because he could think of nothing else to do, answering a sudden thought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of Galadriel and held it up. Its white light quickened swiftly, and the shadows under the dark arch fled. The monstrous Watchers sat there cold and still, revealed in all their hideous shape. For a moment Sam caught a glitter in the black stones of their eyes, the very malice of which made him quail; but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble into fear. He sprang past them; but even as he did so, thrusting the phial back into his bosom, he was aware, as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to behind him, that their vigilance was renewed. And from those evil heads there came a high shrill cry that echoed in the towering walls before him. Far up above, like an answering signal, a harsh bell clanged a single stroke. \u0027That\u0027s done it!\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Now I\u0027ve rung the front-door bell! Well, come on somebody!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Tell Captain Shagrat that the great Elf-warrior has called, with his elf-sword too!\u0027 There was no answer. Sam strode forward. Sting glittered blue in his hand. The courtyard lay in deep shadow, but he could see that the pavement was strewn with bodies. Right at his feet were two orc-archers with knives sticking in their backs. Beyond lay many more shapes; some singly as they had been hewn down or shot; others in pairs, still grappling one another, dead in the very throes of stabbing, throttling, biting. The stones were slippery with dark blood. Two liveries Sam noticed, one marked by the Red Eye, the other by a Moon disfigured with a ghastly face of death; but he did not stop to look more closely. Across the court a great door at the foot of the Tower stood half open, and a red light came through; a large orc lay dead upon the threshold. Sam sprang over the body and went in; and then he peered about at a loss. A wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the mountain-side. It was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on the walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors and openings could be seen on this side and that; but it was empty save for two or three more bodies sprawling on the floor. From what he had heard of the captains\u0027 talk Sam knew that, dead or alive, Frodo would most likely be found in a chamber high up in the turret far above; but he might search for a day before he found the way. \u0027It\u0027ll be near the back, I guess,\u0027 Sam muttered. \u0027The whole Tower climbs backwards-like. And anyway I\u0027d better follow these lights.\u0027 He advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more reluctant. Terror was beginning to grip him again. There was no sound save the rap of his feet, which seemed to grow to an echoing noise, like the slapping of great hands upon the stones. The dead bodies: the emptiness; the dank black walls that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood; the fear of sudden death lurking in doorway or shadow; and behind all his mind the waiting watchful malice at the gate: it was almost more than he could screw himself to face. He would have welcomed a fight-with not too many enemies at a time – rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced himself to think of Frodo, lying bound or in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place. He went on. He had passed beyond the torchlight, almost to a great arched door at the end of the passage, the inner side of the under gate, as he rightly guessed, when there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek. He stopped short. Then he heard feet coming. Someone was running in great haste down an echoing stairway overhead. His will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. It dragged at the chain and clutched the Ring. But Sam did not put it on; for even as he clasped it to his breast, an orc came clattering down. Leaping out of a dark opening at the right, it ran towards him. It was no more than six paces from him when, lifting its head, it saw him; and Sam could hear its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword: it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in a grey shadow, looming against the wavering light behind; in one hand it held a sword, the very light of which was a bitter pain, the other was clutched at its breast, but held concealed some nameless menace of power and doom. For a moment the orc crouched, and then with a hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had come. Never was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned tail than Sam at this unexpected flight. With a shout he gave chase. \u0027Yes! The Elf-warrior is loose!\u0027 he cried. \u0027I\u0027m coming. Just you show me the way up, or I\u0027ll skin you!\u0027 But the orc was in its own haunts, nimble and well-fed. Sam was a stranger, hungry and weary. The stairs were high and steep and winding. Sam\u0027s breath began to come in gasps. The orc had soon passed out of sight, and now only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet as it went on and up. Every now and again it gave a yell, and the echo ran along the walls. But slowly all sound of it died away. Sam plodded on. He felt that he was on the right road, and his spirits had risen a good deal. He thrust the Ring away and tightened his belt. \u0027Well, well!\u0027 he said. \u0027If only they all take such a dislike to me and my Sting, this may turn out better than I hoped. And anyway it looks as if Shagrat, Gorbag, and company have done nearly all my job for me. Except for that little frightened rat, I do believe there\u0027s nobody left alive in the place!\u0027 And with that he stopped, brought up hard, as if he had hit his head against the stone wall. The full meaning of what he had said struck him like a blow. Nobody left alive! Whose had been that horrible dying shriek? \u0027Frodo, Frodo! Master!\u0027 he cried half sobbing. \u0027If they\u0027ve killed you, what shall I do? Well, I\u0027m coming at last, right to the top, to see what I must.\u0027 Up, up he went. It was dark save for an occasional torch flaring at a turn, or beside some opening that led into the higher levels of the Tower. Sam tried to count the steps, but after two hundred he lost his reckoning. He was moving quietly now: for he thought that he could hear the sound of voices talking, still some way above. More than one rat remained alive, it seemed. All at once, when he felt that he could pump out no more breath, nor force his knees to bend again, the stair ended. He stood still. The voices were now loud and near. Sam peered about. He had climbed right to the flat roof of the third and highest tier of the Tower: an open space, about twenty yards across, with a low parapet. There the stair was covered by a small domed chamber in the midst of the roof, with low doors facing east and west. Eastward Sam could see the plain of Mordor vast and dark below, and the burning mountain far away. A fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells, and the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at this distance of many miles the light of them lit the tower-top with a red glare. Westward the view was blocked by the base of the great turret that stood at the back of this upper court and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling hills. Light gleamed in a window-slit. Its door was not ten yards from where Sam stood. It was open but dark, and from just within its shadow the voices came. At first Sam did not listen; he took a pace out of the eastward door and looked about. At once he saw that up here the fighting had been fiercest. All the court was choked with dead orcs or their severed and scattered heads and limbs. The place stank of death. A snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent him darting back into hiding. An orc-voice rose in anger, and he knew it again at once, harsh, brutal, cold. It was Shagrat speaking, Captain of the Tower. \u0027You won\u0027t go again, you say? Curse you, Snaga, you little maggot! If you think I\u0027m so damaged that it\u0027s safe to flout me, you\u0027re mistaken Come here, and I\u0027ll squeeze your eyes out, like I did to Radbug just now. And when some new lads come, I\u0027ll deal with you: I\u0027ll send you to Shelob.\u0027 \u0027They won\u0027t come, not before you\u0027re dead anyway,\u0027 answered Snaga surlily. \u0027I\u0027ve told you twice that Gorbag\u0027s swine got to the gate first, and none of ours got out. Lagduf and Muzgash ran through, but they were shot. I saw it from a window, I tell you. And they were the last.\u0027 \u0027Then you must go. I must stay here anyway. But I\u0027m hurt. The Black Pits take that filthy rebel Gorbag!\u0027 Shagrat\u0027s voice trailed off into a string of foul names and curses. \u0027I gave him better than I got, but he knifed me, the dung, before I throttled him. You must go, or I\u0027ll eat you. News must get through to Lugbúrz, or we\u0027ll both be for the Black Pits. Yes, you too. You won\u0027t escape by skulking here.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not going down those stairs again,\u0027 growled Snaga, \u0027be you captain or no. Nar! Keep your hands off your knife, or I\u0027ll put an arrow in your guts. You won\u0027t be a captain long when They hear about all these goings-on. I\u0027ve fought for the Tower against those stinking Morgul-rats, but a nice mess you two precious captains have made of things, fighting over the swag.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s enough from you,\u0027 snarled Shagrat. \u0027I had my orders. It was Gorbag started it, trying to pinch that pretty shirt.\u0027 \u0027Well, you put his back up, being so high and mighty. And he had more sense than you anyway. He told you more than once that the most dangerous of these spies was still loose, and you wouldn\u0027t listen. And you won\u0027t listen now. Gorbag was right, I tell you. There\u0027s a great fighter about, one of those bloody-handed Elves, or one of the filthy tarks.*1 He\u0027s coming here, I tell you. You heard the bell. He\u0027s got past the Watchers, and that\u0027s tark\u0027s work. He\u0027s on the stairs. And until he\u0027s off them, I\u0027m not going down. Not if you were a Nazg?l, I wouldn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027So that\u0027s it, is it?\u0027 yelled Shagrat. \u0027You\u0027ll do this, and you\u0027ll not do that? And when he does come, you\u0027ll bolt and leave me? No, you won\u0027t! I\u0027ll put red maggot-holes in your belly first.\u0027 Out of the turret-door the smaller orc came flying. Behind him came Shagrat, a large orc with long arms that, as he ran crouching, reached to the ground. But one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding; the other hugged a large black bundle. In the red glare Sam, cowering behind the stair-door, caught a glimpse of his evil face as it passed: it was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with blood; slaver dripped from its protruding fangs; the mouth snarled like an animal. As far as Sam could see, Shagrat hunted Snaga round the roof, until ducking and eluding him the smaller orc with a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared. Then Shagrat halted. Out of the eastward door Sam could see him now by the parapet, panting, his left claw clenching and unclenching feebly. He put the bundle on the floor and with his right claw drew out a long red knife and spat on it. Going to the parapet he leaned over, looking down into the outer court far below. Twice he shouted but no answer came. Suddenly, as Shagrat was stooped over the battlement, his back to the roof-top, Sam to his amazement saw that one of the sprawling bodies was moving. It was crawling. It put out a claw and clutched the bundle. It staggered up. In its other hand it held a broad-headed spear with a short broken haft. It was poised for a stabbing thrust. But at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth, a gasp of pain or hate. Quick as a snake Shagrat slipped aside, twisted round, and drove his knife into his enemy\u0027s throat. \u0027Got you, Gorbag!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Not quite dead, eh? Well, I\u0027ll finish my job now.\u0027 He sprang on to the fallen body, and stamped and trampled it in his fury, stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife. Satisfied at last, he threw back his head and let out a horrible gurgling yell of triumph. Then he licked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and catching up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs. Sam had no time to think. He might have slipped out of the other door, but hardly without being seen; and he could not have played hide-and-seek with this hideous orc for long. He did what was probably the best thing he could have done. He sprang out to meet Shagrat with a shout. He was no longer holding the Ring, but it was there, a hidden power, a cowing menace to the slaves of Mordor; and in his hand was Sting, and its light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter of cruel stars in the terrible elf-countries, the dream of which was a cold fear to all his kind. And Shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure. He stopped, growling, baring his fangs. Then once more, orc-fashion, he leapt aside, and as Sam sprang at him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he thrust it hard into his enemy\u0027s face. Sam staggered, and before he could recover, Shagrat darted past and down the stairs. Sam ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far. Soon the thought of Frodo returned to him, and he remembered that the other orc had gone back into the turret. Here was another dreadful choice, and he had no time to ponder it. If Shagrat got away, he would soon get help and come back. But if Sam pursued him, the other orc might do some horrible deed up there. And anyway Sam might miss Shagrat or be killed by him. He turned quickly and ran back up the stairs. \u0027Wrong again, I expect,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027But it\u0027s my job to go right up to the top first, whatever happens afterwards.\u0027 Away below Shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over the court and through the gate, bearing his precious burden. If Sam could have seen him and known the grief that his escape would bring, he might have quailed. But now his mind was set on the last stage of his search. He came cautiously to the turret-door and stepped inside. It opened into darkness. But soon his staring eyes were aware of a dim light at his right hand. It came from an opening that led to another stairway, dark and narrow: it appeared to go winding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall. A torch was glimmering from somewhere up above. Softly Sam began to climb. He came to the guttering torch, fixed above a door on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward: one of the red eyes that he and Frodo had seen from down below by the tunnel\u0027s mouth. Quickly Sam passed the door and hurried on to the second storey, dreading at any moment to he attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind. He came next to a window looking east and another torch above the door to a passage through the middle of the turret. The door was open, the passage dark save for the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from outside filtering through the window-slit. But here the stair stopped and climbed no further. Sam crept into the passage. On either side there was a low door; both were closed and locked. There was no sound at all. \u0027A dead end,\u0027 muttered Sam; \u0027and after all my climb! This can\u0027t be the top of the tower. But what can I do now?\u0027 He ran back to the lower storey and tried the door. It would not move. He ran up again, and sweat began to trickle down his face. He felt that even minutes were precious, but one by one they escaped; and he could do nothing. He cared no longer for Shagrat or Snaga or any other orc that was ever spawned. He longed only for his master, for one sight of his face or one touch of his hand. At last, weary and feeling finally defeated, he sat on a step below the level of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands. It was quiet, horribly quiet. The torch, that was already burning low when he arrived, sputtered and went out; and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide. And then softly, to his own surprise, there at the vain end of his long journey and his grief, moved by what thought in his heart he could not tell, Sam began to sing. His voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower: the voice of a forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an Elven-lord. He murmured old childish tunes out of the Shire, and snatches of Mr. Bilbo\u0027s rhymes that came into his mind like fleeting glimpses of the country of his home. And then suddenly new strength rose in him, and his voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to fit the simple tune. \u0027Beyond all towers strong and high,\u0027 he began again, and then he stopped short. He thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him. But now he could hear nothing. Yes, he could hear something, but not a voice. Footsteps were approaching. Now a door was being opened quietly in the passage above; the hinges creaked. Sam crouched down listening. The door closed with a dull thud; and then a snarling orc-voice rang out. \u0027Ho la! You up there, you dunghill rat! Stop your squeaking, or I\u0027ll come and deal with you. D\u0027you hear?\u0027 There was no answer. \u0027All right,\u0027 growled Snaga. \u0027But I\u0027ll come and have a look at you all the same, and see what you\u0027re up to.\u0027 The hinges creaked again, and Sam, now peering over the corner of the passage-threshold, saw a flicker of light in an open doorway, and the dim shape of an orc coming out. He seemed to be carrying a ladder. Suddenly the answer dawned on Sam: the topmost chamber was reached by a trap-door in the roof of the passage. Snaga thrust the ladder upwards, steadied it, and then clambered out of sight. Sam heard a bolt drawn back. Then he heard the hideous voice speaking again. \u0027You lie quiet, or you\u0027ll pay for it! You\u0027ve not got long to live in peace, I guess; but if you don\u0027t want the fun to begin right now, keep your trap shut, see? There\u0027s a reminder for you!\u0027 There was a sound like the crack of a whip. At that rage blazed in Sam\u0027s heart to a sudden fury. He sprang up, ran, and went up the ladder like a cat. His head came out in the middle of the floor of a large round chamber. A red lamp hung from its roof; the westward window-slit was high and dark. Something was lying on the floor by the wall under the window, but over it a black orc-shape was straddled. It raised a whip a second time, but the blow never fell. With a cry Sam leapt across the floor, Sting in hand. The orc wheeled round, but before it could make a move Sam slashed its whip-hand from its arm. Howling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head-down at him. Sam\u0027s next blow went wide, and thrown off his balance he fell backwards, clutching at the orc as it stumbled over him. Before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The orc in its wild haste had tripped on the ladder-head and fallen through the open trap-door. Sam gave no more thought to it. He ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was Frodo. He was naked, lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags: his arm was flung up, shielding his head, and across his side there ran an ugly whip-weal. \u0027Frodo! Mr. Frodo, my dear!\u0027 cried Sam, tears almost blinding him. \u0027It\u0027s Sam, I\u0027ve come!\u0027 He half lifted his master and hugged him to his breast. Frodo opened his eyes. \u0027Am I still dreaming?\u0027 he muttered. \u0027But the other dreams were horrible.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re not dreaming at all, Master,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027It\u0027s real. It\u0027s me. I\u0027ve come.\u0027 \u0027I can hardly believe it,\u0027 said Frodo, clutching him. \u0027There was an orc with a whip, and then it turns into Sam! Then I wasn\u0027t dreaming after all when I heard that singing down below, and I tried to answer? Was it you?\u0027 \u0027It was indeed, Mr. Frodo. I\u0027d given up hope, almost. I couldn\u0027t find you. Well, you have now, Sam, dear Sam, said Frodo, and he la back in Sam\u0027s gentle arms, closing his eyes, like a child at rest when night-fears are driven away by some loved voice or hand. Sam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness; but it was not allowed. It was not enough for him to find his master, he had still to try and save him. He kissed Frodo\u0027s forehead. \u0027Come! Wake up Mr. Frodo!\u0027 he said, trying to sound as cheerful as he had when he drew back the curtains at Bag End on a summer\u0027s morning. Frodo sighed and sat up. \u0027Where are we? How did I get here?\u0027 he asked. \u0027There\u0027s no time for tales till we get somewhere else, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027But you\u0027re in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orcs got you. How long ago that was I don\u0027t know. More than a day, I guess.\u0027 \u0027Only that?\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027It seems weeks. You must tell me all about it, if we get a chance. Something hit me, didn\u0027t it? And I fell into darkness and foul dreams, and woke and found that waking was worse. Orcs were all round me. I think they had just been pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat. My head grew clear, but I was aching and weary. They stripped me of everything; and then two great brutes came and questioned me, questioned me until I thought I should go mad, standing over me, gloating, fingering their knives. I\u0027ll never forget their claws and eyes.\u0027 \u0027You won\u0027t, if you talk about them, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027And if we don\u0027t want to see them again, the sooner we get going the better. Can you walk?\u0027 \u0027Yes, I can walk,\u0027 said Frodo, getting up slowly. \u0027I am not hurt Sam. Only I feel very tired, and I\u0027ve a pain here.\u0027 He put his hand to the back of his neck above his left shoulder. He stood up, and it looked to Sam as if he was clothed in flame: his naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp above. Twice he paced across the floor. \u0027That\u0027s better!\u0027 he said, his spirits rising a little. \u0027I didn\u0027t dare to move when I was left alone, or one of the guards came. Until the yelling and fighting began. The two big brutes: they quarrelled, I think. Over me and my things. I lay here terrified. And then all went deadly quiet, and that was worse.\u0027 \u0027Yes, they quarrelled, seemingly,\u0027 said Sam. There must have been a couple of hundred of the dirty creatures in this place. A bit of a tall order for Sam Gamgee, as you might say. But they\u0027ve done all the killing of themselves. That\u0027s lucky, but it\u0027s too long to make a song about, till we\u0027re out of here. Now what\u0027s to be done? You can\u0027t go walking in the Black Land in naught but your skin, Mr. Frodo.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ve taken everything, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Everything I had. Do you understand? Everything!\u0027 He cowered on the floor again with bowed head, as his own words brought home to him the fullness of the disaster, and despair overwhelmed him. \u0027The quest has failed Sam. Even if we get out of here, we can\u0027t escape. Only Elves can escape. Away, away out of Middle-earth, far away over the Sea. If even that is wide enough to keep the Shadow out.\u0027 \u0027No, not everything, Mr. Frodo. And it hasn\u0027t failed, not yet. I took it, Mr. Frodo, begging your pardon. And I\u0027ve kept it safe. It\u0027s round my neck now, and a terrible burden it is, too.\u0027 Sam fumbled for the Ring and its chain. \u0027But I suppose you must take it back.\u0027 Now it had come to it, Sam felt reluctant to give up the Ring and burden his master with it again. \u0027You\u0027ve got it?\u0027 gasped Frodo. \u0027You\u0027ve got it here? Sam, you\u0027re a marvel!\u0027 Then quickly and strangely his tone changed. \u0027Give it to me!\u0027 he cried, standing up, holding out a trembling hand. \u0027Give it me at once! You can\u0027t have it!\u0027 \u0027All right, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 said Sam, rather startled. \u0027Here it is!\u0027 Slowly he drew the Ring out and passed the chain over his head. \u0027But you\u0027re in the land of Mordor now, sir; and when you get out, you\u0027ll see the Fiery Mountain and all. You\u0027ll find the Ring very dangerous now, and very hard to bear. If it\u0027s too hard a job, I could share it with you, maybe?\u0027 \u0027No, no!\u0027 cried Frodo, snatching the Ring and chain from Sam\u0027s hands. \u0027No you won\u0027t, you thief!\u0027 He panted, staring at Sam with eyes wide with fear and enmity. Then suddenly, clasping the Ring in one clenched fist, he stood aghast. A mist seemed to clear from his eyes, and he passed a hand over his aching brow. The hideous vision had seemed so real to him, half bemused as he was still with wound and fear. Sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc again, leering and pawing at his treasure, a foul little creature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth. But now the vision had passed. There was Sam kneeling before him, his face wrung with pain, as if he had been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes. \u0027O Sam!\u0027 cried Frodo. \u0027What have I said? What have I done? Forgive me! After all you have done. It is the horrible power of the Ring. I wish it had never, never, been found. But don\u0027t mind me, Sam. I must carry the burden to the end. It can\u0027t be altered. You can\u0027t come between me and this doom.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s all right, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 said Sam, rubbing his sleeve across his eyes. \u0027I understand. But I can still help, can\u0027t I? I\u0027ve got to get you out of here. At once, see! But first you want some clothes and gear and then some food. The clothes will be the easiest part. As we\u0027re in Mordor, we\u0027d, best dress up Mordor-fashion; and anyway there isn\u0027t no choice. It\u0027ll have to be orc-stuff for you, Mr. Frodo, I\u0027m afraid. And for me too. If we go together, we\u0027d best match. Now put this round you!\u0027 Sam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about Frodo\u0027s shoulders. Then unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor. He drew Sting from its sheath. Hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade. \u0027I was forgetting this, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 he said. \u0027No, they didn\u0027t get everything! You lent me Sting, if you remember, and the Lady\u0027s glass. I\u0027ve got them both still. But lend them to me a little longer, Mr. Frodo. I must go and see what I can find. You stay here. Walk about a bit and ease your legs. I shan\u0027t be long. I shan\u0027t have to go far.\u0027 \u0027Take care, Sam!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027And be quick! There may be orcs still alive, lurking in wait.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve got to chance it,\u0027 said Sam. He stepped to the trap-door and slipped down the ladder. In a minute his head reappeared. He threw a long knife on the floor. \u0027There\u0027s something that might be useful,\u0027 he said. \u0027He\u0027s dead: the one that whipped you. Broke his neck, it seems, in his hurry. Now you draw up the ladder, if you can, Mr. Frodo; and don\u0027t you let it down till you hear me call the password. Elbereth I\u0027ll call. What the Elves say. No orc would say that.\u0027 Frodo sat for a while and shivered, dreadful fears chasing one another through his mind. Then he got up, drew the grey elven-cloak about him, and to keep his mind occupied, began to walk to and fro, prying and peering into every corner of his prison. It was not very long, though fear made it seem an hour at least, before he heard Sam\u0027s voice calling softly from below: Elbereth, Elbereth. Frodo let down the light ladder. Up came Sam, puffing, heaving a great bundle on his head. He let it fall with a thud. \u0027Quick now. Mr. Frodo!\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve had a bit of a search to find anything small enough for the likes of us. We\u0027ll have to make do. But we must hurry. I\u0027ve met nothing alive, and I\u0027ve seen nothing but I\u0027m not easy. I think this place is being watched. I can\u0027t explain it, but well: it feels to me as if one of those foul flying Riders was about, up in the blackness where he can\u0027t be seen.\u0027 He opened the bundle. Frodo looked in disgust at the contents, but there was nothing for it: he had to put the things on, or go naked. There were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast-fell, and a tunic of dirty leather. He drew them on. Over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail, short for a full-sized orc, too long for Frodo and heavy. About it he clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad-bladed stabbing-sword. Sam had brought several orc-helmets. One of them fitted Frodo well enough, a black cap with iron rim, and iron hoops covered with leather upon which the evil Eye was painted in red above the beaklike nose-guard. \u0027The Morgul-stuff, Gorbag\u0027s gear, was a better fit and better made,\u0027 said Sam; \u0027but it wouldn\u0027t do, I guess, to go carrying his tokens into Mordor, not after this business here. Well, there you are, Mr. Frodo. A perfect little orc, if I may make so bold-at least you would be, if we could cover your face with a mask, give you longer arms, and make you bow-legged. This will hide some of the tell-tales.\u0027 He put a large black cloak round Frodo\u0027s shoulders. \u0027Now you\u0027re ready! You can pick up a shield as we go.\u0027 \u0027What about you, Sam?\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Aren\u0027t we going to match?\u0027 \u0027Well, Mr. Frodo, I\u0027ve been thinking,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027I\u0027d best not leave any of my stuff behind, and we can\u0027t destroy it. And I can\u0027t wear orc-mail over all my clothes, can I? I\u0027ll just have to cover up.\u0027 He knelt down and carefully folded his elven-cloak. It went into a surprisingly small roll. This he put into his pack that lay on the floor. Standing up, he slung it behind his back, put an orc-helm on his head, and cast another black cloak about his shoulders. \u0027There!\u0027 he said. \u0027Now we match, near enough. And now we must be off!\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t go all the way at a run, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo with a wry smile. \u0027I hope you\u0027ve made inquiries about inns along the road? Or have you forgotten about food and drink?\u0027 \u0027Save me, but so I had!\u0027 said Sam. He whistled in dismay. \u0027Bless me, Mr. Frodo, but you\u0027ve gone and made me that hungry and thirsty! I don\u0027t know when drop or morsel last passed my lips. I\u0027d forgotten it, trying to find you. But let me think! Last time I looked I\u0027d got about enough of that waybread, and of what Captain Faramir gave us, to keep me on my legs for a couple of weeks at a pinch. But if there\u0027s a drop left in my bottle, there\u0027s no more. That\u0027s not going to be enough for two, nohow. Don\u0027t ores eat, and don\u0027t they drink? Or do they just live on foul air and poison?\u0027 \u0027No, they eat and drink, Sam. The Shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own. I don\u0027t think it gave life to the ores, it only ruined them and twisted them; and if they are to live at all, they have to live like other living creatures. Foul waters and foul meats they\u0027ll take, if they can get no better, but not poison. They\u0027ve fed me, and so I\u0027m better off than you. There must be food and water somewhere in this place.\u0027 \u0027But there\u0027s no time to look for them,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Well, things are a bit better than you think,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027I have had a bit of luck while you were away. Indeed they did not take everything. I\u0027ve found my food-bag among some rags on the floor. They\u0027ve rummaged it, of course. But I guess they disliked the very look and smell of the lembas, worse than Gollum did. It\u0027s scattered about and some of it is trampled and broken, but I\u0027ve gathered it together. It\u0027s not far short of what you\u0027ve got. But they\u0027ve taken Faramir\u0027s food, and they\u0027ve slashed up my water-bottle.\u0027 \u0027Well, there\u0027s no more to be said,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027We\u0027ve got enough to start on. But the water\u0027s going to be a bad business. But come Mr. Frodo! Off we go, or a whole lake of it won\u0027t do us any good!\u0027 \u0027Not till you\u0027ve had a mouthful, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027I won\u0027t budge. Here, take this elven-cake, and drink that last drop in your bottle! The whole thing is quite hopeless, so it\u0027s no good worrying about tomorrow. It probably won\u0027t come.\u0027 At last they started. Down the ladder they climbed, and then Sam took it and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc. The stair was dark, but on the roof-top the glare of the Mountain could still be seen, though it was dying down now to a sullen red. They picked up two shields to complete their disguise and then went on. Down the great stairway they plodded. The high chamber of the turret behind, where they had met again, seemed almost homely: they were out in the open again now, and terror ran along the walls. All might be dead in the Tower of Cirith Ungol, but it was steeped in fear and evil still. At length they came to the door upon the outer court, and they halted. Even from where they stood they felt the malice of the Watchers beating on them, black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare of Mordor dimly showed. As they threaded their way among the hideous bodies of the ores each step became more difficult. Before they even reached the archway they were brought to a stand. To move an inch further was a pain and weariness to will and limb. Frodo had no strength for such a battle. He sank to the ground. \u0027I can\u0027t go on, Sam,\u0027 he murmured. \u0027I\u0027m going to faint. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s come over me.\u0027 \u0027I do, Mr. Frodo. Hold up now! It\u0027s the gate. There\u0027s some devilry there. But I got through, and I\u0027m going to get out. It can\u0027t be more dangerous than before. Now for it!\u0027 Sam drew out the elven-glass of Galadriel again. As if to do honour to his hardihood, and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit-hand that had done such deeds, the phial blazed forth suddenly, so that all the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance like lightning; but it remained steady and did not pass. \u0027Gilthoniel, A Elbereth!\u0027 Sam cried. For, why he did not know, his thought sprang back suddenly to the Elves in the Shire, and the song that drove away the Black Rider in the trees. \u0027Aiya elenion ancalima!\u0027 cried Frodo once again behind him. The will of the Watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping of a cord, and Frodo and Sam stumbled forward. Then they ran. Through the gate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes. There was a crack. The keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels, and the wall above crumbled, and fell in ruin. Only by a hair did they escape. A bell clanged; and from the Watchers there went up a high and dreadful wail. Far up above in the darkness it was answered. Out of the black sky there came dropping like a bolt a winged shape, rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/48/3222.html","bookId":745,"book":{"id":745,"title":"The Return of The King魔戒：王者归来","description":"简介： The Return of the King is the third and final volume of J.
