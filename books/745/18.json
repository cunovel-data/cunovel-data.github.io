{"id":15923,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 18 The Scouring of the Shire","content":"It was after nightfall when, wet and tired, the travellers came at last to the Brandywine, and they found the way barred. At either end of the Bridge there was a great spiked gate; and on the further side of the river they could see that some new houses had been built: two-storeyed with narrow straight-sided windows, bare and dimly lit, all very gloomy and un-Shirelike. They hammered on the outer gate and called, but there was at first no answer; and then to their surprise someone blew a horn, and the lights in the windows went out. A voice shouted in the dark: \u0027Who\u0027s that? Be off! You can\u0027t come in: Can\u0027t you read the notice: No admittance between sundown and sunrise?\u0027 \u0027Of course we can\u0027t read the notice in the dark.\u0027 Sam shouted back. \u0027And if hobbits of the Shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like this, I\u0027ll tear down your notice when I find it.\u0027 At that a window slammed, and a crowd of hobbits with lanterns poured out of the house on the left. They opened the further gate, and some came over the bridge. When they saw the travellers they seemed frightened. \u0027Come along!\u0027 said Merry, recognizing one of the hobbits. \u0027If you don\u0027t know me, Hob Hayward, you ought to. I am Merry Brandybuck, and I should like to know what all this is about, and what a Bucklander like you is doing here. You used to be on the Hay Gate.\u0027 \u0027Bless me! It\u0027s Master Merry, to be sure, and all dressed up for fighting!\u0027 said old Hob. \u0027Why, they said you was dead! Lost in the Old Forest by all accounts. I\u0027m pleased to see you alive after all!\u0027 \u0027Then stop gaping at me through the bars, and open the gate!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Master Merry, but we have orders.\u0027 \u0027Whose orders?\u0027 \u0027The Chief\u0027s up at Bag End.\u0027 \u0027Chief? Chief? Do you mean Mr. Lotho?\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027I suppose so, Mr. Baggins; but we have to say just \"the Chief\" nowadays.\u0027 \u0027Do you indeed!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Well, I am glad he has dropped the Baggins at any rate. But it is evidently high time that the family dealt with him and put him in his place.\u0027 A hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate. \u0027It won\u0027t do no good talking that way,\u0027 said one. \u0027He\u0027ll get to hear of it. And if you make so much noise, you\u0027ll wake the Chief\u0027s Big Man.\u0027 \u0027We shall wake him up in a way that will surprise him,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027If you mean that your precious Chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild, then we\u0027ve not come back too soon.\u0027 He sprang from his pony, and seeing the notice in the light of the lanterns, he tore it down and threw it over the gate. The hobbits backed away and made no move to open it. \u0027Come on, Pippin!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Two is enough.\u0027 Merry and Pippin climbed the gate, and the hobbits fled. Another horn sounded. Out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway. \u0027What\u0027s all this,\u0027 he snarled as he came forward. \u0027Gate-breaking? You clear out, or I\u0027ll break your filthy little necks!\u0027 Then he stopped, for he had caught the gleam of swords. \u0027Bill Ferny,\u0027 said Merry, \u0027if you don\u0027t open that gate in ten seconds, you\u0027ll regret it. I shall set steel to you, if you don\u0027t obey. And when you have opened the gates you will go through them and never return. You are a ruffian and a highway-robber.\u0027 Bill Ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it. \u0027Give me the key!\u0027 said Merry. But the ruffian flung it at his head and then darted out into the darkness. As he passed the ponies one of them let fly with his heels and just caught him as he ran. He went off with a yelp into the night and was never heard of again. \u0027Neat work, Bill,\u0027 said Sam, meaning the pony. \u0027So much for your Big Man,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027We\u0027ll see the Chief later. In the meantime we want a lodging for the night, and as you seem to have pulled down the Bridge Inn and built this dismal place instead, you\u0027ll have to put us up.\u0027 \u0027I am sorry, Mr. Merry,\u0027 said Hob, \u0027but it isn\u0027t allowed.\u0027 \u0027What isn\u0027t allowed?\u0027 Taking in folk off-hand like and eating extra food, and all that, said Hob. \u0027What\u0027s the matter with the place?\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Has it been a bad year, or what? I thought it had been a fine summer and harvest.\u0027 \u0027Well no, the year\u0027s been good enough,\u0027 said Hob. \u0027We grows a lot of food, but we don\u0027t rightly know what becomes of it. It\u0027s all these \"gatherers\" and \"sharers\", I reckon, going round counting and measuring and taking off to storage. They do more gathering than sharing, and we never see most of the stuff again.\u0027 \u0027Oh come!\u0027 said Pippin yawning. \u0027This is all too tiresome for me tonight. We\u0027ve got food in our bags. Just give us a room to lie down in. It\u0027ll be better than many places I have seen.\u0027 The hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at ease, evidently some rule or other was being broken; but there was no gainsaying four such masterful travellers, all armed, and two of them uncommonly large and strong-looking. Frodo ordered the gates to be locked again. There was some sense at any rate in keeping a guard, while ruffians were still about. Then the four companions went into the hobbit guard-house and made themselves as comfortable as they could. It was a bare and ugly place, with a mean little grate that would not allow a good fire. In the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds, and on every wall there was a notice and a list of Rules. Pippin tore them down. There was no beer and very little food, but with what the travellers brought and shared out they all made a fair meal; and Pippin broke Rule 4 by putting most of next day\u0027s allowance of wood on the fire. \u0027Well now, what about a smoke, while you tell us what has been happening in the Shire?\u0027 he said. \u0027There isn\u0027t no pipe-weed now,\u0027 said Hob; \u0027at least only for the Chief\u0027s men. All the stocks seem to have gone. We do hear that waggon-loads of it went away down the old road out of the Southfarthing, over Sarn Ford way. That would be the end o\u0027 last year, after you left. But it had been going away quietly before that, in a small way. That Lotho-\u0027 \u0027Now you shut up, Hob Hayward!\u0027 cried several of the others. \u0027You know talk o\u0027 that sort isn\u0027t allowed. The Chief will hear of it, and we\u0027ll all be in trouble.\u0027 \u0027He wouldn\u0027t hear naught, if some of you here weren\u0027t sneaks,\u0027 rejoined Hob hotly. \u0027All right, all right!\u0027 said Sam. \"That\u0027s quite enough. I don\u0027t want to hear no more. No welcome, no beer, no smoke, and a lot of rules and orc-talk instead. I hoped to have a rest, but I can see there\u0027s work and trouble ahead. Let\u0027s sleep and forget it till morning!\u0027 The new \u0027Chief\u0027 evidently had means of getting news. It was a good forty miles from the Bridge to Bag End, but someone made the journey in a hurry. So Frodo and his friends soon discovered. They had not made any definite plans, but had vaguely thought of going down to Crickhollow together first, and resting there a bit. But now, seeing what things were like, they decided to go straight to Hobbiton. So the next day they set out along the Road and jogged along steadily. The wind had dropped but the sky was grey. The land looked rather sad and forlorn; but it was after all the first of November and the fag-end of Autumn. Still there seemed an unusual amount of burning going on, and smoke rose from many points round about. A great cloud of it was going up far away in the direction of the Woody End. As evening fell they were drawing near to Frogmorton, a village right on the Road, about twenty-two miles from the Bridge. There they meant to stay the night; The Floating Log at Frogmorton was a good inn. But as they came to the east end of the village they met a barrier with a large board saying NO ROAD; and behind it stood a large band of Shirriffs with staves in their hands and feathers in their caps, looking both important and rather scared. \u0027What\u0027s all this?\u0027 said Frodo, feeling inclined to laugh. This is what it is, Mr. Baggins, said the leader of the Shirriffs, a two-feather hobbit: \u0027You\u0027re arrested for Gate-breaking, and Tearing up of Rules, and Assaulting Gate-keepers, and Trespassing, and Sleeping in Shire-buildings without Leave, and Bribing Guards with Food.\u0027 \u0027And what else?\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027That\u0027ll do to go on with,\u0027 said the Shirriff-leader. \u0027I can add some more, if you like it,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Calling your Chief Names, Wishing to punch his Pimply Face, and Thinking you Shirriffs look a lot of Tom-fools.\u0027 \u0027There now, Mister, that\u0027ll do. It\u0027s the Chief\u0027s orders that you\u0027re to come along quiet. We\u0027re going to take you to Bywater and hand you over to the Chief\u0027s Men; and when he deals with your case you can have your say. But if you don\u0027t want to stay in the Lockholes any longer than you need, I should cut the say short, if I was you.\u0027 To the discomfiture of the Shirriffs Frodo and his companions all roared with laughter. \u0027Don\u0027t be absurd!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027I am going where I please, and in my own time. I happen to be going to Bag End on business, but if you insist on going too, well that is your affair.\u0027 \u0027Very well, Mr. Baggins,\u0027 said the leader, pushing the barrier aside. \u0027But don\u0027t forget I\u0027ve arrested you.\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Never. But I may forgive you. Now I am not going any further today, so if you\u0027ll kindly escort me to The Floating Log, I\u0027ll be obliged.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t do that, Mr. Baggins. The inn\u0027s closed. There\u0027s a Shirriff-house at the far end of the village. I\u0027ll take you there. \u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Go on and we\u0027ll follow.\u0027 Sam had been looking the Shirriffs up and down and had spotted one that he knew. \u0027Hey, come here Robin Smallburrow!\u0027 he called. \u0027I want a word with you.\u0027 With a sheepish glance at his leader, who looked wrathful but did not dare to interfere, Shirriff Smallburrow fell back and walked beside Sam, who got down off his pony. \u0027Look here, Cock-robin!\u0027 said Sam. \u0027You\u0027re Hobbiton-bred and ought to have more sense, coming a-waylaying Mr. Frodo and all. And what\u0027s all this about the inn being closed?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re all closed,\u0027 said Robin. \u0027The Chief doesn\u0027t hold with beer. Leastways that is how it started. But now I reckon it\u0027s his Men that has it all. And he doesn\u0027t hold with folk moving about; so if they will or they must, then they has to go to the Shirriff-house and explain their business.\u0027 \u0027You ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such nonsense,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027You used to like the inside of an inn better than the outside yourself. You were always popping in, on duty or off.\u0027 \u0027And so I would be still, Sam, if I could. But don\u0027t be hard on me. What can I do? You know how I went for a Shirriff seven years ago, before any of this began. Gave me a chance of walking round the country and seeing folk, and hearing the news, and knowing where the good beer was. But now it\u0027s different.\u0027 \u0027But you can give it up, stop Shirriffing, if it has stopped being a respectable job,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027We\u0027re not allowed to,\u0027 said Robin. \u0027If I hear not allowed much oftener,\u0027 said Sam, \u0027I\u0027m going to get angry.\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t say as I\u0027d be sorry to see it,\u0027 said Robin lowering his voice. \u0027If we all got angry together something might be done. But it\u0027s these Men, Sam, the Chief\u0027s Men. He sends them round everywhere, and if any of us small folk stand up for our rights, they drag him off to the Lockholes. They took old Flourdumpling, old Will Whitfoot the Mayor, first, and they\u0027ve taken a lot more. Lately it\u0027s been getting worse. Often they beat \u0027em now.\u0027 \u0027Then why do you do their work far them?\u0027 said Sam angrily. \u0027Who sent you to Frogmorton?\u0027 \u0027No one did. We stay here in the big Shirriff-house. We\u0027re the First Eastfarthing Troop now. There\u0027s hundreds of Shirriffs all told and they want more, with all these new rules. Most of them are in it against their will, but not all. Even in the Shire there are some as like minding other folk\u0027s business and talking big. And there\u0027s worse than that: there\u0027s a few as do spy-work for the Chief and his Men.\u0027 \u0027Ah! So that\u0027s how you had news of us, is it?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right. We aren\u0027t allowed to send by it now, but they use the old Quick Post service, and keep special runners at different points. One came in from Whitfurrows last night with a \"secret message\", and another took it on from here. And a message came back this afternoon saying you was to be arrested and taken to Bywater, not direct to the Lockholes. The Chief wants to see you at once, evidently.\u0027 \u0027He won\u0027t be so eager when Mr. Frodo has finished with him,\u0027 said Sam. The Shirriff-house at Frogmorton was as bad as the Bridge-house. It had only one storey, but it had the same narrow windows, and it was built of ugly pale bricks, badly laid. Inside it was damp and cheerless, and supper was served on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks. The food deserved no better setting. The travellers were glad to leave the place. It was about eighteen miles to Bywater, and they set off at ten o\u0027clock in the morning. They would have started earlier, only the delay so plainly annoyed the Shirriff-leader. The west wind had shifted northward and it was turning colder, but the rain was gone. It was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village, though the few folk that came out to stare at the \u0027get-up\u0027 of the travellers did not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed. A dozen Shirriffs had been told off as escort to the \u0027prisoners\u0027; but Merry made them march in front, while Frodo and his friends rode behind. Merry, Pippin, and Sam sat at their ease laughing and talking and singing, while the Shirriffs stumped along trying to look stern and important. Frodo, however, was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful. The last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge. \u0027Hullo, hullo!\u0027 he jeered. \u0027Now who\u0027s arrested who?\u0027 Two of the Shirriffs immediately left the party and went towards him. \u0027Leader!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Order your fellows back to their places at once, if you don\u0027t want me to deal with them!\u0027 The two hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily. \u0027Now get on!\u0027 said Merry, and after that the travellers saw to it that their ponies\u0027 pace was quick enough to push the Shirriffs along as fast as they could go. The sun came out, and in spite of the chilly wind they were soon puffing and sweating. At the Three-Farthing Stone they gave it up. They had done nearly fourteen miles with only one rest at noon. It was now three o\u0027clock. They were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace. \u0027Well, come along in your own time!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027We are going on.\u0027 \u0027Good-bye, Cock-robin!\u0027 said Sam. \u0027I\u0027ll wait for you outside The Green Dragon, if you haven\u0027t forgotten where that is. Don\u0027t dawdle on the way!\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re breaking arrest, that\u0027s what you\u0027re doing,\u0027 said the leader ruefully, \u0027and I can\u0027t be answerable.\u0027 \u0027We shall break a good many things yet, and not ask you to answer \u0027 said Pippin. \u0027Good luck to you!\u0027 The travellers trotted on, and as the sun began to sink towards the White Downs far away on the western horizon they came to Bywater by its wide pool; and there they had their first really painful shock. This was Frodo and Sam\u0027s own country, and they found out now that they cared about it more than any other place in the world. Many of the houses that they had known were missing. Some seemed to have been burned down. The pleasant row of old hobbit-holes in the bank on the north side of the Pool were deserted, and their little gardens that used to run down bright to the water\u0027s edge were rank with weeds. Worse, there was a whole line of the ugly new houses all along Pool Side, where the Hobbiton Road ran close to the bank. An avenue of trees had stood there. They were all gone. And looking with dismay up the road towards Bag End they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance. It was pouring out black smoke into the evening air. Sam was beside himself. \u0027I\u0027m going right on, Mr. Frodo!\u0027 he cried. \u0027I\u0027m going to see what\u0027s up. I want to find my gaffer.\u0027 \u0027We ought to find out first what we\u0027re in for, Sam,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027I guess that the \"Chief\" will have a gang of ruffians handy. We had better find someone who will tell us how things are round here.\u0027 But in the village of Bywater all the houses and holes were shut, and no one greeted them. They wondered at this, but they soon discovered the reason of it. When they reached The Green Dragon, the last house on the Hobbiton side, now lifeless and with broken windows, they were disturbed to see half a dozen large ill-favoured Men lounging against the inn-wall; they were squint-eyed and sallow-faced. \u0027Like that friend of Bill Ferny\u0027s at Bree,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Like many that I saw at Isengard,\u0027 muttered Merry. The ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts, but they had no other weapons, as far as could be seen. As the travellers rode up they left the wall and walked into the road, blocking the way. \u0027Where d\u0027you think you\u0027re going?\u0027 said one, the largest and most evil-looking of the crew. \u0027There\u0027s no road for you any further. And where are those precious Shirriffs?\u0027 \u0027Coming along nicely,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027A little footsore, perhaps. We promised to wait for them here.\u0027 \u0027Garn, what did I say?\u0027 said the ruffian to his mates. \u0027I told Sharkey it was no good trusting those little fools. Some of our chaps ought to have been sent.\u0027 \u0027And what difference would that have made, pray?\u0027 said Merry. \u0027We are not used to footpads in this country, but we know how to deal with them.\u0027 \u0027Footpads, eh?\u0027 said the man: \u0027So that\u0027s your tone, is it? Change it, or we\u0027ll change it for you. You little folk are getting too uppish. Don\u0027t you trust too much in the Boss\u0027s kind heart. Sharkey\u0027s come now and he\u0027ll do what Sharkey says.\u0027 \u0027And what may that be?\u0027 said Frodo quietly. \u0027This country wants waking up and setting to rights,\u0027 said the ruffian, \u0027and Sharkey\u0027s going to do it; and make it hard, if you drive him to it. You need a bigger Boss. And you\u0027ll get one before the year is out, if there\u0027s any more trouble. Then you\u0027ll learn a thing or two, you little rat-folk.\u0027 \u0027Indeed. I am glad to hear of your plans,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027I am on my way to call on Mr. Lotho, and he may be interested to hear of them too.\u0027 The ruffian laughed. \u0027Lotho! He knows all right. Don\u0027t you worry. He\u0027ll do what Sharkey says. Because if a Boss gives trouble, we can change him. See? And if little folks try to push in where they\u0027re not wanted, we can put them out of mischief. See?\u0027 \u0027Yes, I see,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027For one thing, I see that you\u0027re behind the times and the news here. Much has happened since you left the South. Your day is over, and all other ruffians\u0027. The Dark Tower has fallen, and there is a King in Gondor. And Isengard has been destroyed, and your precious master is a beggar in the wilderness. I passed him on the road. The King\u0027s messengers will ride up the Greenway now not bullies from Isengard.\u0027 The man stared at him and smiled. \u0027A beggar in the wilderness!\u0027 he mocked. \u0027Oh, is he indeed? Swagger it, swagger it, my little cock-a-whoop. But that won\u0027t stop us living in this fat little country where you have lazed long enough. And\u0027 – he snapped his fingers in Frodo\u0027s face – \u0027King\u0027s messengers! That for them! When I see one, I\u0027ll take notice, perhaps.\u0027 This was too much for Pippin. His thoughts went back to the Field of Cormallen, and here was a squint-eyed rascal calling the Ring-bearer \u0027little cock-a-whoop\u0027. He cast back his cloak, flashed out his sword, and the silver and sable of Gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward. \u0027I am a messenger of the King,\u0027 he said. \u0027You are speaking to the King\u0027s friend, and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the West. You are a ruffian and a fool. Down on your knees in the road and ask pardon, or I will set this troll\u0027s bane in you!\u0027 The sword glinted in the westering sun. Merry and Sam drew their swords also and rode up to support Pippin; but Frodo did not move. The ruffians gave back. Scaring Breeland peasants, and bullying bewildered hobbits, had been their work. Fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise. And there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard before. It chilled them with fear. \u0027Go!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027If you trouble this village again, you will regret it.\u0027 The three hobbits came on, and then the ruffians turned and fled running away up the Hobbiton Road; but they blew their horns as they ran. \u0027Well, we\u0027ve come back none too soon,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Not a day too soon. Perhaps too late, at any rate to save Lotho,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Miserable fool, but I am sorry for him.\u0027 \u0027Save Lotho? Whatever do you mean?\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027Destroy him I should say.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think you quite understand things, Pippin,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Lotho never meant things to come to this pass. He has been a wicked fool, but he\u0027s caught now. The ruffians are on top, gathering, robbing and bullying, and running or ruining things as they like, in his name. And not in his name even for much longer. He\u0027s a prisoner in Bag End now, I expect, and very frightened. We ought to try and rescue him.\u0027 \u0027Well I am staggered!\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027Of all the ends to our journey that is the very last I should have thought of: to have to fight half-orcs and ruffians in the Shire itself – to rescue Lotho Pimple!\u0027 \u0027Fight?\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Well, I suppose it may come to that. But remember: there is to be no slaying of hobbits, not even if they have gone over to the other side. Really gone over, I mean; not just obeying ruffians\u0027 orders because they are frightened. No hobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the Shire, and it is not to begin now. And nobody is to be killed at all, if it can be helped. Keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last possible moment!\u0027 \u0027But if there are many of these ruffians,\u0027 said Merry, \u0027it will certainly mean fighting. You won\u0027t rescue Lotho, or the Shire, just by being shocked and sad, my dear Frodo.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027It won\u0027t be so easy scaring them a second time. They were taken by surprise. You heard that horn-blowing? Evidently there are other ruffians near at hand. They\u0027ll be much bolder when there\u0027s more of them together. We ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night. After all we\u0027re only four, even if we are armed.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve an idea,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Let\u0027s go to old Tom Cotton\u0027s down South Lane! He always was a stout fellow. And he has a lot of lads that were all friends of mine.\u0027 \u0027No!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027It\u0027s no good \"getting under cover\". That is just what people have been doing, and just what these ruffians like. They will simply come down on us in force, corner us, and then drive us out, or burn us in. No, we have got to do something at once.\u0027 \u0027Do what?\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027Raise the Shire!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Now! Wake all our people! They hate all this, you can see: all of them except perhaps one or two rascals, and a few fools that want to be important, but don\u0027t at all understand what is really going on. But Shire-folk have been so comfortable so long they don\u0027t know what to do. They just want a match, though, and they\u0027ll go up in fire. The Chief\u0027s Men must know that. They\u0027ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. We\u0027ve only got a very short time. \u0027Sam, you can make a dash for Cotton\u0027s farm, if you like. He\u0027s the chief person round here, and the sturdiest. Come on! I am going to blow the horn of Rohan, and give them all some music they have never heard before.\u0027 They rode back to the middle of the village. There Sam turned aside and galloped off down the lane that led south to Cotton\u0027s. He had not gone far when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing into the sky. Far over hill and field it echoed; and so compelling was that call that Sam himself almost turned and dashed back. His pony reared and neighed. \u0027On, lad! On!\u0027 he cried. \u0027We\u0027ll be going back soon.\u0027 Then he heard Merry change the note, and up went the Horn-cry of Buckland, shaking the air. Behind him Sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of doors. In front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming; dogs barked; feet came running. Before he got to the lane\u0027s end there was Farmer Cotton with three of his lads, Young Tom, Jolly, and Nick, hurrying towards him. They had axes in their hands, and barred the way. \u0027Nay! It\u0027s not one of them ruffians,\u0027 Sam heard the farmer say. \u0027It\u0027s a hobbit by the size of it, but all dressed up queer. Hey!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Who are you, and what\u0027s all this to-do?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s Sam, Sam Gamgee. I\u0027ve come back.\u0027 Farmer Cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight. \u0027Well!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027The voice is right, and your face is no worse than it was, Sam. But I should a\u0027 passed you in the street in that gear. You\u0027ve been in foreign parts, seemingly. We feared you were dead.\u0027 \u0027That I ain\u0027t!\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Nor Mr. Frodo. He\u0027s here and his friends. And that\u0027s the to-do. They\u0027re raising the Shire. We\u0027re going to clear out these ruffians, and their Chief too. We\u0027re starting now.\u0027 \u0027Good, good!\u0027 cried Farmer Cotton. \u0027So it\u0027s begun at last! I\u0027ve been itching for trouble all this year, but folks wouldn\u0027t help. And I\u0027ve had the wife and Rosie to think of. These ruffians don\u0027t stick at nothing. But come on now, lads! Bywater is up! We must be in it!\u0027 \u0027What about Mrs. Cotton and Rosie?\u0027 said Sam. \u0027It isn\u0027t safe yet for them to be left all alone.\u0027 \u0027My Nibs is with them. But you can go and help him, if you have a mind,\u0027 said Farmer Cotton with a grin. Then he and his sons ran off towards the village. Sam hurried to the house. By the large round door at the top of the steps from the wide yard stood Mrs. Cotton and Rosie, and Nibs in front of them grasping a hay-fork. \u0027It\u0027s me!\u0027 shouted Sam as he trotted up. \u0027Sam Gamgee! So don\u0027t try prodding me, Nibs. Anyway, I\u0027ve a mail-shirt on me.\u0027 He jumped down from his pony and went up the steps. They stared at him in silence. \u0027Good evening, Mrs. Cotton!\u0027 he said. \u0027Hullo Rosie!\u0027 \u0027Hullo, Sam!\u0027 said Rosie. \u0027Where\u0027ve you been I They said you were dead; but I\u0027ve been expecting you since the Spring. You haven\u0027t hurried have you?\u0027 \u0027Perhaps not,\u0027 said Sam abashed. \u0027But I\u0027m hurrying now. We\u0027re setting about the ruffians, and I\u0027ve got to get back to Mr. Frodo. But I thought I\u0027d have a look and see how Mrs. Cotton was keeping, and you, Rosie.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re keeping nicely, thank you,\u0027 said Mrs. Cotton. \u0027Or should be, if it weren\u0027t for these thieving ruffians.\u0027 \u0027Well, be off with you!\u0027 said Rosie. \u0027If you\u0027ve been looking after Mr. Frodo all this while, what d\u0027you want to leave him for, as soon as things look dangerous?\u0027 This was too much for Sam. It needed a week\u0027s answer, or none. He turned away and mounted his pony. But as he started off, Rosie ran down the steps. \u0027I think you look fine, Sam,\u0027 she said. \u0027Go on now! But take care of yourself, and come straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians!\u0027 When Sam got back he found the whole village roused. Already, apart from many younger lads, more than a hundred sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes, and heavy hammers, and long knives, and stout staves: and a few had hunting-bows. More were still coming in from outlying farms. Some of the village-folk had lit a large fire, just to enliven things, and also because it was one of the things forbidden by the Chief. It burned bright as night came on. Others at Merry\u0027s orders were setting up barriers across the road at each end of the village. When the Shirriffs came up to the lower one they were dumbfounded; but as soon as they saw how things were, most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt. The others slunk away. Sam found Frodo and his friends by the fire talking to old Tom Cotton, while an admiring crowd of Bywater folk stood round and stared. \u0027Well, what\u0027s the next move?\u0027 said Farmer Cotton. \u0027I can\u0027t say,\u0027 said Frodo, \u0027until I know more. How many of these ruffians are there?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s hard to tell,\u0027 said Cotton. \u0027They moves about and comes and goes. There\u0027s sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up Hobbiton way; but they go out from there roving round, thieving or \"gathering\" as they call it. Still there\u0027s seldom less than a score round the Boss, as they names him. He\u0027s at Bag End, or was; but he don\u0027t go outside the rounds now. No one s seen him at all, in fact, for a week or two; but the Men don\u0027t let no one go near.\u0027 \u0027Hobbiton\u0027s not their only place, is it?\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027No, more\u0027s the pity,\u0027 said Cotton. \u0027There\u0027s a good few down south in Longbottom and by Sarn Ford, I hear; and some more lurking in the Woody End; and they\u0027ve sheds at Waymeet. And then there\u0027s the Lockholes, as they call \u0027em: the old storage-tunnels at Michel Delving that they\u0027ve made into prisons for those as stand up to them. Still I reckon there\u0027s not above three hundred of them in the Shire all told, and maybe less. We can master them, if we stick together.\u0027 \u0027Have they got any weapons?\u0027 asked Merry. \u0027Whips, knives, and clubs, enough for their dirty work: that\u0027s all they\u0027ve showed so far,\u0027 said Cotton. \u0027But I dare say they\u0027ve got other gear, if it comes to fighting. Some have bows, anyway. They\u0027ve shot one or two of our folk.\u0027 \u0027There you are, Frodo!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027I knew we should have to fight. Well, they started the killing.\u0027 \u0027Not exactly,\u0027 said Cotton. \u0027Leastways not the shooting. Tooks started that. You see our dad Mr. Peregrin, he\u0027s never had no truck with this Lotho, not from the beginning: said that if anyone was going to play the chief at this time of day, it would be the right Thain of the Shire and no upstart. And when Lotho sent his Men they got no change out of him. Tooks are lucky, they\u0027ve got those deep holes in the Green Hills, the Great Smials and all, and the ruffians can\u0027t come at \u0027em; and they won\u0027t let the ruffians come on their land. If they do, Tooks hunt \u0027em. Tooks shot three for prowling and robbing. After that the ruffians turned nastier. And they keep a pretty close watch on Tookland. No one gets in nor out of it now.\u0027 \u0027Good for the Tooks!\u0027 cried Pippin. \u0027But someone is going to get in again, now. I am off to the Smials. Anyone coming with me to Tuckborough?\u0027 Pippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies. \u0027See you soon!\u0027 he cried. \u0027It\u0027s only fourteen miles or so over the fields. I\u0027ll bring you back an army of Tooks in the morning.\u0027 Merry blew a horn-call after them as they rode off into the gathering night. The people cheered. \u0027All the same,\u0027 said Frodo to all those who stood near, \u0027I wish for no killing; not even of the ruffians, unless it must be done, to prevent them from hurting hobbits.\u0027 \u0027All right!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027But we shall be having a visit from the Hobbiton gang any time now, I think. They won\u0027t come just to talk things over. We\u0027ll try to deal with them neatly, but we must be prepared for the worst. Now I\u0027ve got a plan.\u0027 \u0027Very good,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027You make the arrangements.\u0027 Just then some hobbits, who had been sent out towards Hobbiton, came running in. \u0027They\u0027re coming!\u0027 they said. \u0027A score or more. But two have gone off west across country.\u0027 \u0027To Waymeet, that\u0027ll be,\u0027 said Cotton, \u0027to fetch more of the gang. Well, it\u0027s fifteen mile each way. We needn\u0027t trouble about them just yet.\u0027 Merry hurried off to give orders. Farmer Cotton cleared the street, sending everyone indoors, except the older hobbits who had weapons of some sort. They had not long to wait. Soon they could hear loud voices, and then the tramping of heavy feet. Presently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the road. They saw the barrier and laughed. They did not imagine that there was anything in this little land that would stand up to twenty of their kind together. The hobbits opened the barrier and stood aside. \u0027Thank you!\u0027 the Men jeered. \u0027Now run home to bed before you\u0027re whipped.\u0027 Then they marched along the street shouting: \u0027Put those lights out! Get indoors and stay there! Or we\u0027ll take fifty of you to the Lockholes for a year. Get in! The Boss is losing his temper.\u0027 No one paid any heed to their orders; but as the ruffians passed, they closed in quietly behind and followed them. When the Men reached the fire there was Farmer Cotton standing all alone warming his hands. \u0027Who are you, and what d\u0027you think you\u0027re doing?\u0027 said the ruffian-leader. Farmer Cotton looked at him slowly. \u0027I was just going to ask you that,\u0027 he said. \u0027This isn\u0027t your country, and you\u0027re not wanted.\u0027 \u0027Well, you\u0027re wanted anyhow,\u0027 said the leader. \u0027We want you. Take him lads! Lockholes for him, and give him something to keep him quiet!\u0027 The Men took one step forward and stopped short. There rose a roar of voices all round them, and suddenly they were aware that Farmer Cotton was not all alone. They were surrounded. In the dark on the edge of the firelight stood a ring of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows. There was nearly two hundred of them, all holding some weapon. Merry stepped forward. \u0027We have met before,\u0027 he said to the leader, \u0027and I warned you not to come back here. I warn you again: you are standing in the light and you are covered by archers. If you lay a finger on this farmer, or on anyone else, you will be shot at once. Lay down any weapons that you have!\u0027 The leader looked round. He was trapped. But he was not scared, not now with a score of his fellows to back him. He knew too little of hobbits to understand his peril. Foolishly he decided to fight. It would be easy to break out. \u0027At \u0027em lads!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Let \u0027em have it!\u0027 With a long knife in his left hand and a club in the other he made a rush at the ring, trying to burst out back towards Hobbiton. He aimed a savage blow at Merry who stood in his way. He fell dead with four arrows in him: That was enough for the others. They gave in. Their weapons were taken from them, and they were roped together, and marched off to an empty hut that they had built themselves, and there they were tied hand and foot, and locked up under guard. The dead leader was dragged off and buried. \u0027Seems almost too easy after all, don\u0027t it?\u0027 said Cotton. \u0027I said we could master them. But we needed a call. You came back in the nick o\u0027 time, Mr. Merry.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s more to be done still,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027If you\u0027re right in your reckoning, we haven\u0027t dealt with a tithe of them yet. But it\u0027s dark now. I think the next stroke must wait until morning. Then we must call on the Chief.\u0027 \u0027Why not now?\u0027 said Sam. \u0027It\u0027s not much more than six o\u0027clock. And I want to see my gaffer. D\u0027you know what\u0027s come of him, Mr. Cotton?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s not too well, and not too bad, Sam,\u0027 said the farmer. \u0027They dug up Bagshot Row, and that was a sad blow to him. He\u0027s in one of them new houses that the Chief\u0027s Men used to build while they still did any work other than burning and thieving: not above a mile from the end of Bywater. But he comes around to me, when he gets a chance, and I see he\u0027s better fed than some of the poor bodies. All against The Rules, of course. I\u0027d have had him with me, but that wasn\u0027t allowed.\u0027 \u0027Thank\u0027ee indeed, Mr. Cotton, and I\u0027ll never forget it,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027But I want to see him. That Boss and that Sharkey, as they spoke of, they might do a mischief up there before the morning.\u0027 \u0027All right, Sam,\u0027 said Cotton. \u0027Choose a lad or two, and go and fetch him to my house. You\u0027ll not have need to go near the old Hobbiton village over Water. My Jolly here will show you.\u0027 Sam went off. Merry arranged for look-outs round the village and guards at the barriers during the night. Then he and Frodo went off with Farmer Cotton. They sat with the family in the warm kitchen, and the Cottons asked a few polite questions about their travels, but hardly listened to the answers: they were far more concerned with events in the Shire. \u0027It all began with Pimple, as we call him,\u0027 said Farmer Cotton; \u0027and it began as soon as you\u0027d gone off, Mr. Frodo. He\u0027d funny ideas had Pimple. Seems he wanted to own everything himself, and then order other folk about. It soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him; and he was always grabbing more, though where he got the money was a mystery: mills and malt-houses and inns, and farms, and leaf-plantations. He\u0027d already bought Sandyman\u0027s mill before he came to Bag End, seemingly. \u0027Of course he started with a lot of property in the Southfarthing which he had from his dad; and it seems he\u0027d been selling a lot o\u0027 the best leaf, and sending it away quietly for a year or two. But at the end o\u0027 last year he began sending away loads of stuff, not only leaf. Things began to get short, and winter coming on, too. Folk got angry, but he had his answer. A lot of Men, ruffians mostly, came with great waggons, some to carry off the goods south-away, and others to stay. And more came. And before we knew where we were they were planted here and there all over the Shire, and were felling trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as they liked. At first goods and damage was paid for by Pimple; but soon they began lording it around and taking what they wanted. \u0027Then there was a bit of trouble, but not enough. Old Will the Mayor set off for Bag End to protest, but he never got there. Ruffians laid hands on him and took and locked him up in a hole in Michel Delving, and there he is now. And after that, it would bc soon after New Year, there wasn\u0027t no more Mayor, and Pimple called himself Chief Shirriff, or just Chief, and did as he liked; and if anyone got \"uppish\" as they called it, they followed Will. So things went from bad to worse. There wasn\u0027t no smoke left, save for the Men; and the Chief didn\u0027t hold with beer, save for his Men, and closed all the inns; and everything except Rules got shorter and shorter, unless one could hide a bit of one\u0027s own when the ruffians went round gathering stuff up \"for fair distribution\": which meant they got it and we didn\u0027t, except for the leavings which you could have at the Shirriff-houses, if you could stomach them. All very bad. But since Sharkey came it\u0027s been plain ruination.\u0027 \u0027Who is this Sharkey?\u0027 said Merry. \u0027I heard one of the ruffians speak of him.\u0027 \u0027The biggest ruffian o\u0027 the lot, seemingly,\u0027 answered Cotton. \u0027It was about last harvest, end o\u0027 September maybe, that we first heard of him. We\u0027ve never seen him, but he\u0027s up at Bag End; and he\u0027s the real Chief now, I guess. All the ruffians do what he says; and what he says is mostly hack, burn, and ruin; and now it s come to killing. There s no longer even any bad sense in it. They cut down trees and let \u0027em lie, they burn houses and build no more. \u0027Take Sandyman\u0027s mill now. Pimple knocked it down almost as soon as he came to Bag End. Then he brought in a lot o\u0027 dirty-looking Men to build a bigger one and fill it full o\u0027 wheels and outlandish contraptions. Only that fool Ted was pleased by that, and he works there cleaning wheels for the Men, where his dad was the Miller and his own master. Pimple\u0027s idea was to grind more and faster, or so he said. He\u0027s got other mills like it. But you\u0027ve got to have grist before you can grind; and there was no more for the new mill to do than for the old. But since Sharkey came they don\u0027t grind no more corn at all. They\u0027re always a-hammering and a-letting out a smoke and a stench, and there isn\u0027t no peace even at night in Hobbiton. And they pour out filth a purpose; they\u0027ve fouled all the lower Water and it\u0027s getting down into Brandywine. If they want to make the Shire into a desert, they\u0027re going the right way about it. I don\u0027t believe that fool of a Pimple\u0027s behind all this. It\u0027s Sharkey, I say.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right!\u0027 put in Young Tom. \u0027Why, they even took Pimple\u0027s old ma, that Lobelia, and he was fond of her, if no one else was. Some of the Hobbiton folk, they saw it. She comes down the lane with her old umbrella. Some of the ruffians were going up with a big cart. \u0027 \"Where be you a-going?\" says she. \u0027 \"To Bag End,\" says they. \u0027 \"What for?\" says she. \u0027 \"To put up some sheds for Sharkey,\" says they. \u0027 \"Who said you could?\" says she. \u0027 \"Sharkey,\" says they. \"So get out o\u0027 the road, old hagling!\" \u0027 \"I\u0027ll give you Sharkey, you dirty thieving ruffians!\" says she, and ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader. near twice her size. So they took her. Dragged her off to the Lockholes, at her age too. They\u0027ve took others we miss more, but there\u0027s no denying she showed more spirit than most.\u0027 Into the middle of this talk came Sam, bursting in with his gaffer. Old Gamgee did not look much older, but he was a little deafer. \u0027Good evening. Mr. Baggins!\u0027 he said. \u0027Glad indeed I am to see you safe back. But I\u0027ve a bone to pick with you, in a manner o\u0027 speaking, if I may make so bold. You didn\u0027t never ought to have a\u0027 sold Bag End, as I always said. That\u0027s what started all the mischief. And while you\u0027re been trapessing in foreign parts, chasing Black Men up mountains from what my Sam says, though what for he don\u0027t make clear, they\u0027ve been and dug up Bagshot Row and ruined my taters!\u0027 \u0027I am very sorry, Mr. Gamgee,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027But now I\u0027ve come back, I\u0027ll do my best to make amends.\u0027 \u0027Well, you can\u0027t say fairer than that,\u0027 said the gaffer. \u0027Mr. Frodo Baggins is a real gentlehobbit, I always have said, whatever you may think of some others of the name, begging your pardon. And I hope my Sam\u0027s behaved hisself and given satisfaction?\u0027 \u0027Perfect satisfaction, Mr. Gamgee,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Indeed, if you will believe it, he\u0027s now one of the most famous people in all the lands, and they are making songs about his deeds from here to the Sea and beyond the Great River.\u0027 Sam blushed, but he looked gratefully at Frodo, for Rosie\u0027s eyes were shining and she was smiling at him. \u0027It takes a lot o\u0027 believing,\u0027 said the gaffer, \u0027though I can see he\u0027s been mixing in strange company. What\u0027s come of his weskit? I don\u0027t hold with wearing ironmongery, whether it wears well or no.\u0027 Farmer Cotton\u0027s household and all his guests were up early next morning. Nothing had been heard in the night, but more trouble would certainly come before the day was old. \u0027Seems as if none o\u0027 the ruffians were left up at Bag End,\u0027 said Cotton; \u0027but the gang from Waymeet will be along any time now.\u0027 After breakfast a messenger from the Tookland rode in. He was in high spirits. \u0027The Thain has raised all our country,\u0027 he said, \u0027and the news is going like fire all ways. The ruffians that were watching our land have fled off south, those that escaped alive. The Thain has gone after them, to hold off the big gang down that way; but he\u0027s sent Mr Peregrin back with all the other folk he can spare.\u0027 The next news was less good. Merry, who had been out all night, came riding in about ten o\u0027clock. \u0027There\u0027s a big band about four miles away,\u0027 he said. \u0027They\u0027re coming along the road from Waymeet, but a good many stray ruffians have joined up with them. There must be close on a hundred of them; and they\u0027re fire-raising as they come. Curse them!\u0027 \u0027Ah! This lot won\u0027t stay to talk, they\u0027ll kill, if they can,\u0027 said Farmer Cotton. \u0027If Tooks don\u0027t come sooner, we\u0027d best get behind cover and shoot without arguing. There\u0027s got to be some fighting before this is settled, Mr. Frodo.\u0027 The Tooks did come sooner. Before long they marched in, a hundred strong, from Tuckborough and the Green Hills with Pippin at their head. Merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians. Scouts reported that they were keeping close together. They knew that the countryside had risen against them, and plainly meant to deal with the rebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in Bywater. But however grim they, might be, they seemed to have no leader among them who understood warfare. They came on without any precautions. Merry laid his plans quickly. The ruffians came tramping along the East Road, and without halting turned up the Bywater Road, which ran for some way sloping up between high banks with low hedges on top. Round a bend, about a furlong from the main road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. That halted them. At the same moment they became aware that the hedges on both sides, just above their heads, were all lined with hobbits. Behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons that had been hidden in a field, and so blocked the way back. A voice spoke to them from above. \u0027Well, you have walked into a trap,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Your fellows from Hobbiton did the same, and one is dead and the rest are prisoners. Lay down your weapons! Then go back twenty paces and sit down. Any who try to break out will be shot.\u0027 But the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily. A few of them obeyed, but were immediately set on by their fellows. A score or more broke back and charged the waggons. Six were shot, but the remainder burst out, killing two hobbits, and then scattering across country in the direction of the Woody End. Two more fell as they ran. Merry blew a loud horn-call, and there were answering calls from a distance. \u0027They won\u0027t get far,\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027All that country is alive with our hunters now.\u0027 Behind, the trapped Men in the lane, still about four score, tried to climb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them or hew them with axes. But many of the strongest and most desperate got out on the west side, and attacked their enemies fiercely, being now more bent on killing than escaping. Several hobbits fell, and the rest were wavering, when Merry and Pippin, who were on the east side, came across and charged the ruffians. Merry himself slew the leader, a great squint-eyed brute like a huge orc. Then he drew his forces off, encircling the last remnant of the Men in a wide ring of archers. At last all was over. Nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field, and a dozen were prisoners. Nineteen hobbits were killed, and some thirty were wounded. The dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off to an old sand-pit nearby and there buried: in the Battle Pit, as it was afterwards called. The fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on the hill-side, where later a great stone was set up with a garden about it. So ended the Battle of Bywater, 1419, the last battle fought in the Shire, and the only battle since the Greenfields, 1147, away up in the Northfarthing. In consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a chapter to itself in the Red Book, and the names of all those who took part were made into a Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the top of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains Meriadoc and Peregrin. Frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. When the fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and Sam joined him, and they rode back with the Cottons. They ate a late midday meal, and then Frodo said with a sigh: \u0027Well, I suppose it is time now that we dealt with the \"Chief\".\u0027 \u0027Yes indeed; the sooner the better,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027And don\u0027t be too gentle! He\u0027s responsible for bringing in these ruffians, and for all the evil they have done.\u0027 Farmer Cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits. \u0027For it\u0027s only a guess that there is no ruffians left at Bag End,\u0027 he said. \u0027We don\u0027t know.\u0027 Then they set out on foot. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin led the way. It was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow. All along the Bywater Road every tree had been felled. As they crossed the bridge and looked up the Hill they gasped. Even Sam\u0027s vision in the Mirror had not prepared him for what they saw. The Old Grange on the west side had been knocked down, and its place taken by rows of tarred sheds. All the chestnuts were gone. The banks and hedgerows were broken. Great waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of grass. Bagshot Row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry. Bag End up. beyond could not be seen for a clutter of large huts. \u0027They\u0027ve cut it down!\u0027 cried Sam. \u0027They\u0027ve cut down the Party Tree!\u0027 He pointed to where the tree. had stood under which Bilbo had made his Farewell Speech. It was lying lopped and dead in the field. As if this was the last straw Sam burst into tears. A laugh put an end to them. There was a surly hobbit lounging over the low wall of the mill-yard. He was grimy-faced and black-handed. \u0027Don\u0027t \u0027ee like it, Sam?\u0027 he sneered. \u0027But you always was soft. I thought you\u0027d gone off in one o\u0027 them ships you used to prattle about, sailing, sailing. What d\u0027you want to come back for? We\u0027ve work to do in the Shire now.\u0027 \u0027So I see,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027No time for washing, but time for wall-propping. But see here, Master Sandyman, I\u0027ve a score to pay in this village, and don\u0027t you make it any longer with your jeering, or you\u0027ll foot a bill too big for your purse.\u0027 Ted Sandyman spat over the wall: \u0027Garn!\u0027 he said. \u0027You can\u0027t touch me. I\u0027m a friend o\u0027 the Boss\u0027s. But he\u0027ll touch you all right, if I have any more of your mouth.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t waste any more words on the fool, Sam!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027I hope there are not many more hobbits that have become like this. It would be a worse trouble than all the damage the Men have done.\u0027 \u0027You are dirty and insolent, Sandyman,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027And also very much out of your reckoning. We are just going up the Hill to remove your precious Boss. We have dealt with his Men.\u0027 Ted gaped, for at that moment he first caught sight of the escort that at a sign from Merry now marched over the bridge. Dashing back into the mill he ran out with a horn and blew it loudly. \u0027Save your breath!\u0027 laughed Merry. \u0027I\u0027ve a better.\u0027 Then lifting up his silver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang over the Hill; and out of the holes and sheds and shabby houses of Hobbiton the hobbits answered, and came pouring out, and with cheers and loud cries they followed the company up the road to Bag End. At the top of the lane the party halted, and Frodo and his friends went on; and they came at last to the once beloved place. The garden was full of huts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light. There were piles of refuse everywhere. The door was scarred; the bell-chain was dangling loose, and the bell would not ring. Knocking brought no answer. At length they pushed and the door yielded. They went in. The place stank and was full of filth and disorder: it did not appear to have been used for some time. \u0027Where is that miserable Lotho hiding?\u0027 said Merry. They had searched every room and found no living thing save rats and mice. \u0027Shall we turn on the others to search the sheds?\u0027 \u0027This is worse than Mordor!\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Much worse in a way. It comes home to you, as they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it was all ruined.\u0027 \u0027Yes, this is Mordor,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Just one of its works. Saruman was doing its work all the time, even when he thought he was working for himself. And the same with those that Saruman tricked, like Lotho.\u0027 Merry looked round in dismay and disgust. \u0027Let\u0027s get out!\u0027 he said. \u0027If I had known all the mischief he had caused, I should have stuffed my pouch down Saruman\u0027s throat.\u0027 \u0027No doubt, no doubt! But you did not, and so I am able to welcome you home.\u0027 There standing at the door was Saruman himself, looking well-fed and well-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement. A sudden light broke on Frodo. \u0027Sharkey!\u0027 he cried. Saruman laughed. \u0027So you have heard the name, have you? All my people used to call me that in Isengard, I believe. A sign of affection, possibly. But evidently you did not expect to see me here.\u0027 \u0027I did not,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027But I might have guessed. A little mischief in a mean way: Gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it. \u0027Quite capable,\u0027 said Saruman, \u0027and more than a little. You made me laugh, you hobbit-lordlings, riding along with all those great people so secure and so pleased with your little selves. You thought you had done very well out of it all, and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time in the country. Saruman\u0027s home could be all wrecked, and he could be turned out, but no one could touch yours. Oh no! Gandalf would look after your affairs.\u0027 Saruman laughed again. \u0027Not he! When his tools have done their task he drops them. But you must go dangling after him, dawdling and talking, and riding round twice as far as you needed. \"Well,\" thought I, \"if they\u0027re such fools, I will get ahead of them and teach them a lesson. One ill turn deserves another.\" It would have been a sharper lesson, if only you had given me a little more time and more Men. Still I have already done much that you will find it hard to mend or undo in your lives. And it will be pleasant to think of that and set it against my injuries.\u0027 \u0027Well, if that is what you find pleasure in,\u0027 said Frodo, \u0027I pity you. It will be a pleasure of memory only, I fear. Go at once and never return!\u0027 The hobbits of the villages had seen Saruman come out of one of the huts, and at once they came crowding up to the door of Bag End. When they heard Frodo\u0027s command, they murmured angrily: \u0027Don\u0027t let him go! Kill him! He\u0027s a villain and a murderer. Kill him!\u0027 Saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled. \u0027Kill him!\u0027 he mocked. \u0027Kill him, if you think there are enough of you, my brave hobbits!\u0027 He drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his black eyes. \u0027But do not think that when I lost all my goods I lost all my power! Whoever strikes me shall be accursed. And if my blood stains the Shire, it shall wither and never again be healed.\u0027 The hobbits recoiled. But Frodo said: \u0027Do not believe him! He has lost all power, save his voice that can still daunt you and deceive you, if you let it. But I will not have him slain. It is useless to meet revenge with revenge: it will heal nothing. Go, Saruman, by the speediest way!\u0027 \u0027Worm! Worm!\u0027 Saruman called; and out of a nearby hut came Wormtongue, crawling, almost like a dog. To the road again, Worm!\u0027 said Saruman. \u0027These fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again. Come along!\u0027 Saruman turned to go, and Wormtongue shuffled after him. But even as Saruman passed close to Frodo a knife flashed in his hand, and he stabbed swiftly. The blade turned on the hidden mail-coat and snapped. A dozen hobbits, led by Sam, leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the ground. Sam drew his sword. \u0027No, Sam!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Do not kill him even now. For he has not hurt me. And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was great once, of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us; but I would still spare him, in the hope that he may find it.\u0027 Saruman rose to his feet, and stared at Frodo. There was a strange look in his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred. \u0027You have grown, Halfling,\u0027 he said. \u0027Yes, you have grown very much. You are wise, and cruel. You have robbed my revenge of sweetness, and now I must go hence in bitterness, in debt to your mercy. I hate it and you! Well, I go and I will trouble you no more. But do not expect me to wish you health and long life. You will have neither. But that is not my doing. I merely foretell.\u0027 He walked away, and the hobbits made a lane for him to pass; but their knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons. Wormtongue hesitated, and then followed his master. \u0027Wormtongue!\u0027 called Frodo. \u0027You need not follow him. I know of no evil you have done to me. You can have rest and food here for a while, until you are stronger and can go your own ways.\u0027 Wormtongue halted and looked back at him, half prepared to stay. Saruman turned. \u0027No evil?\u0027 he cackled. \u0027Oh no! Even when he sneaks out at night it is only to look at the stars. But did I hear someone ask where poor Lotho is hiding? You know, don\u0027t you, Worm? Will you tell them?\u0027 Wormtongue cowered down and whimpered: \u0027No, no!\u0027 \u0027Then I will,\u0027 said Saruman. \u0027Worm killed your Chief, poor little fellow, your nice little Boss. Didn\u0027t you, Worm? Stabbed him in his sleep, I believe. Buried him, I hope; though Worm has been very hungry lately. No, Worm is not really nice. You had better leave him to me.\u0027 A look of wild hatred came into Wormtongue\u0027s red eyes. \u0027You told me to; you made me do it,\u0027 he hissed. Saruman laughed. \u0027You do what Sharkey says, always, don\u0027t you, Worm? Well, now he says: follow!\u0027 He kicked Wormtongue in the face as he grovelled, and turned and made off. But at that something snapped: suddenly Wormtongue rose up, drawing a hidden knife, and then with a snarl like a dog he sprang on Saruman\u0027s back, jerked his head back, cut his throat, and with a yell ran off down the lane. Before Frodo could recover or speak a word, three hobbit-bows twanged and Wormtongue fell dead. To the dismay of those that stood by, about the body of Saruman a grey mist gathered, and rising slowly to a great height like smoke from a fire, as a pale shrouded figure it loomed over the Hill. For a moment it wavered, looking to the West; but out of the West came a cold wind, and it bent away, and with a sigh dissolved into nothing. Frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, and the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. Lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it, he covered it over, and turned away. \u0027And that\u0027s the end of that,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027A nasty end, and I wish I needn\u0027t have seen it; but it\u0027s a good riddance.\u0027 \u0027And the very last end of the War, I hope,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027I hope so,\u0027 said Frodo and sighed. \u0027The very last stroke. But to think that it should fall here, at the very door of Bag End! Among all my hopes and fears at least I never expected that.\u0027 \u0027I shan\u0027t call it the end, till we\u0027ve cleared up the mess,\u0027 said Sam gloomily. \u0027And that\u0027ll take a lot of time and work.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/48/3229.html","bookId":745,"book":{"id":745,"title":"The Return of The King魔戒：王者归来","description":"简介： The Return of the King is the third and final volume of J.
