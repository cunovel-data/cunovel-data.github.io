{"id":17038,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"Once the phone rang. He rolled over, refusing its summons, and went to sleep again. It was a little after six when a hand shook him awake. He struggled up through many gray layers. From far off he heard: \"Jimmy\u0027s broken. Busted into pieces all over the place. Hoo, what a devil you are, my friend!\" Kintyre sat up, feeling sticky. Yamamura gave him a lighted cigarette and he took a few puffs. \"Okay,\" he said. The early sunlight and the rushing sound of early traffic whetted him as he left the cottage, until he went clear-brained to the shivering, screaming thing on the pool table and said: \"I\u0027ll take the blindfold off when you\u0027ve talked. Not before.\" \"Let me go, let me go, let me see!\" wept O\u0027Hearn. \"Shut up or I\u0027ll leave you for another day or two,\" said Kintyre. O\u0027Hearn gasped himself toward a kind of silence. \"Did you help kill Bruce Lombardi?\" asked Kintyre. \"No.\" A cracked whine. \"I mean, I was there. But the others, Silenio, Larkin, they done it. I didn\u0027t touch him myself. Let me out of here!\" \"Shut up, I told you.\" Kintyre drew deeply on his cigarette. \"I suspect you\u0027re lying about your own role,\" he continued, \"but never mind that now, if you don\u0027t lie on the next question. Who hired you?\" \"I don\u0027t know!\" \"So long,\" said Kintyre. \"I don\u0027t know! I don\u0027t! They never told me! Silenio knows! I don\u0027t! I just worked for Joe Silenio! Ask him!\" Yamamura, looking a little sick, said: \"That\u0027s probably true, Bob. Our kingpin called this Silenio in Chicago, and Silenio rounded up a couple of assistants. The less they know, the better. Silenio gets the kingpin\u0027s money and pays off the other two himself.\" Kintyre groaned. \"And we had to catch one of the deadheads! Well, let\u0027s see what else can be learned.\" It came out in harsh automatic sentences. O\u0027Hearn\u0027s will, never strong, had altogether failed him. He answered questions without evasions, but like a robot. Silenio had contacted him and Larkin the Tuesday of last week. It was to be a well paid job, ten thousand dollars on completion of the first assignment and a hundred dollars a day while they waited for the next. (\"No, I didn\u0027t know nothing, I don\u0027t know who else we\u0027d go after!\") The trio caught a plane to San Francisco that night. At intervals on Wednesday and Thursday Silenio had conferred with whoever engaged them, while Larkin and O\u0027Hearn looked for a suitable house. Their find was rented on Friday, an old house in a run-down district at the southern end of town; and each of them bought a good used car elsewhere. Meanwhile, on Thursday night, Larkin and O\u0027Hearn had lined up Guido. That had been at Silenio\u0027s orders, presumably derived from the boss\u0027s. The boss himself had arranged for Bruce to come to the house on Saturday, calling him on the phone with some plausible story. They captured Bruce very simply, with a gun, and tied him up. Silenio questioned him. Bruce had gotten stubborn with outrage—Kintyre knew how stubborn that could be—and the interrogation took a few hours; even after he broke they continued the pain a while, to make sure. Finally they cut his throat over the bathtub, dressed him in old clothes, and got rid of the body across the Bay on Sunday night. \"The questions, you bastard,\" snarled Kintyre. \"Didn\u0027t the questions Silenio was asking tell you something?\" \"It was all in wop,\" groaned O\u0027Hearn. \"I don\u0027t know wop.\" Italy again. Though I suppose that our X would have made a special effort to get an Italian-speaking lieutenant, as another safeguard for himself. \"One thing so far,\" murmured Yamamura. \"Guido is in the clear.\" \"Is he?\" said Kintyre bitterly. \"Wouldn\u0027t it be a beautiful turnabout, to make himself look like the fall guy for his own scheme?\" He turned back to the crooked blind face on the table. \"What did you do afterward?\" \"Waited in the house. Played cards. Silenio got the money for this job in the afternoon. Cash. He went out for it. Larkin went to pay off the Lombardi sucker Tuesday evening. That was because he didn\u0027t show Monday, account of his brother. Larkin got into a fight. We didn\u0027t know what it meant. Silenio called the boss and they talked on the phone in wop. Silenio told me to go pick up Guido Lombardi tonight. I figured we was going to find out how much he knew and then maybe dump him too, but I don\u0027t know for sure.\" \"Did anything else go on, this night?\" \"Silenio and Larkin had another job.\" \"Where?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" The voice had become a worn rattling. \"Were you supposed to meet them at the house?\" \"I was supposed to wait there with Lombardi till they got back. Silenio wasn\u0027t telling either of us more\u0027n he had to.\" \"Will they be back there now?\" \"I dunno.\" \"Suppose they came back and didn\u0027t find you? What would they do?\" \"Try and find out what happened, I guess. Wouldn\u0027t stay in the house if it looked like something had gone wrong.\" \"Where would they go?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Some hotel, I guess.\" \"And what would you do, if you couldn\u0027t find them?\" \"Go back to Chi, I guess.\" \"No spare rendezvous,\" said Yamamura. \"Lousy doctrine.\" \"Not if you\u0027re using expendables,\" said Kintyre. \"And this bum is expendable. I imagine Larkin is too, though enough more valuable to go with Silenio—where?\" \"Over here,\" said Yamamura. \"Very likely to kill someone else.\" Kintyre looked dully at the stub of his cigarette on the floor. He didn\u0027t remember dropping it. \"We\u0027ll read in the papers who it was.\" \"If we aren\u0027t the target ourselves,\" said Yamamura. \"Right now anything seems possible.\" He sighed. \"Well, I\u0027d better call the police.\" \"Wait a bit,\" said Kintyre. \"But that house—God knows what\u0027s going on there, right now!\" \"Nothing, I\u0027m sure. If only because Silenio and Larkin will be worried by O\u0027Hearn\u0027s absence. Let\u0027s have breakfast, at least, before calling. You devise a story that won\u0027t make us quite such lawbreakers. I\u0027m going to try and sort out my thoughts. I have an idea. It\u0027s driving me crackers, Trig. I feel I know what this is all about and still there\u0027s some kind of wall between me and the knowledge. A wall I\u0027ve built myself!\" \"Hm,\" said Yamamura. He gave the other man a meditative stare. \"Yes, it might be worth while waiting till after we eat.\" Kintyre went out, beating a fist softly into his palm. Yamamura paused to release O\u0027Hearn\u0027s eyes. O\u0027Hearn lay and wept. While the detective made breakfast in the cottage, Kintyre took a shower. Then a shave, clean clothes, tee shirt, khaki pants, tennis shoes, brought him physically closer to humanness. Inside, he was afraid, and he did not know why. Guido appeared in the kitchen as Kintyre re-entered. He looked at the others with deer shyness. \"Good morning,\" he ventured. \"Hello,\" said Yamamura. \"Pull up an egg and sit down.\" Guido perched on a chair\u0027s edge. No one spoke until coffee and food were within them. Somehow, the blue and green planet beyond the windows had become alien; they sat in a private darkness. \"I—\" began Guido. He stopped. \"Go ahead,\" said Yamamura. Kintyre listened with a fractional ear. Mostly he was inside his own skull, shouting for something which did not answer. \"I\u0027d like to say thanks, is all,\" offered Guido. \"It\u0027s okay,\" said Yamamura. \"Look, are you sitting and worrying about me?\" \"In a way. The trouble is, you see, if we take your story at face value, we have no plausible suspects left. But two more killers and their chief are loose, probably arranging another murder. If it hasn\u0027t already been done.\" \"Whose?\" whispered Guido. \"If we knew that,\" said Yamamura gloomily, \"we could get a police guard for him. But until we\u0027ve identified the chief, there\u0027s no way of figuring who the next victim might be.\" \"No,\" said Kintyre. He sat up straight, feeling how cold his hands were. It came to him, through a great hollowness—each instant he seemed more remote from himself—that he could have found his enemy before now. He had enough facts to reason on. He was still feeling his way a step at a time, but he felt there would be an end to his journey. And he felt, without yet knowing why, that the horror waited for him there. He said, sensing a resonance within his head, as if his voice formed echoes: \"It has to be someone who knew Bruce at least fairly well. He went to that house because of a telephone call. He didn\u0027t own a car and wouldn\u0027t borrow Margery\u0027s. That\u0027s a long awkward trip, by street train and bus. He wouldn\u0027t make it casually. He\u0027d want to know why he was being asked to come to this address he\u0027d never heard of before, without telling anyone. The person who called (and could have been right in Berkeley, of course) had to be somebody who could give Bruce a strong, convincing reason. What it was, I don\u0027t know. It doesn\u0027t matter now, it was surely a lie. But a lie he would accept! From a person he trusted.\" He stopped. Guido said with a certain boy-eagerness: \"Who knew him best? His girl friend!\" Kintyre shook his head, violently, uncertain why the idea should smite him so. \"Nope,\" said Yamamura. \"Too much lets her out; hell, the simple fact that she doesn\u0027t speak Italian. That she hasn\u0027t the money, or the connections, or anything.\" \"I haven\u0027t the money either,\" said Guido defensively. \"For all I know, you could have ten million dollars hoarded,\" said Yamamura. The anger in Guido\u0027s face reminded Kintyre of Corinna. He snatched for the memory, it warmed him a minute and was torn away again. He shivered. \"Guido\u0027s story has to be accepted, I think,\" he said. There was no color in his words, but they came fast. \"All the psychological quirks he\u0027s shown. He bopped me with a stool to let Larkin get away, because he was deathly afraid. But he cried at having hurt me, even so trivially. Also: could that parcel of marijuana have been in the drawer by sheer coincidence? And even if he planned some complicated misdirection that made him his own fall guy, it would not have involved something as serious as dope. He could have gone to jail for that, or been deported. And why? What reason? Insane jealousy won\u0027t fit such an elaborate procedure. It would have to be money. And where would he, drifting between minor night club engagements, sponging off his parents when he isn\u0027t shacked up with some tart, where would he find time for a million-dollar enterprise?\" Guido reddened. \"Hey!\" he protested. \"You had that coming,\" said Yamamura. He turned his back on Guido, who slumped, pouting. \"It doesn\u0027t look as if X really believed an accessory-to-murder rap could be hung on the boy,\" he remarked. \"Not when you demolish it so fast.\" \"Perhaps not.\" Kintyre struggled for clarity within himself. \"But Guido would have wriggled and evaded much more if the police had questioned him, dug in his heels at every step, for fear of the dope charge. When he finally realized the situation and confessed, if he did at all, it would have been too late. He would have served X\u0027s purpose of holding up the police for days. \"And the fact that he fell so neatly into the slot clinches the proof that X knows the Lombardi family well.\" \"You\u0027ve ruled out Michaelis \u0026 Son,\" said Yamamura. \"That\u0027s confirmed by the gangsters still operating with them in clink. Who\u0027s left, the writer?\" Kintyre said: \"He blew into town less than two weeks ago, having never met Bruce in his life before. Their time together was a few meetings devoted to professional arguments. How could he know Guido? And his only motive would have been to eliminate Bruce. Simple murder would have sufficed, not calling in three expensive sadists to do a job of kidnaping and interrogation. Also, I proved to myself, without meaning to, that he\u0027s a physical coward. I doubt if he could have asked someone like Larkin the time of day. Or run the risk of detection. No, there was just one way Owens helped the killers, and that was unintentional.\" \"How?\" asked Yamamura. Kintyre looked at his hands. They were clasped together, as if to hold the safe nonmurderer, Jabez Owens, tightly to him. But the wind streamed and the sea ramped beneath it, Owens was whirled from his fingers and drowned with all the rest, all the rest. He said from the noise of great waters: \"Owens was after the Book of Witches, yes. First he tried bribery. Then, the minute he heard Bruce was dead, he went over to the history building, I suppose trying to get up nerve to go in and see if the volume was there. He saw me instead, and urged me to take Margery out that night; he did know, like everyone else, that she\u0027d been living with Bruce. He burgled the apartment. An amateur job. If he\u0027d used his brains, he would at least have taken some valuables. But he didn\u0027t even bother to open places where the book couldn\u0027t possibly be. That alone pretty well shows who did it. He tried again yesterday, in my office, actually pulled it off, but Clayton—well, all it accomplished was to divert our attention.\" He wondered remotely how they could fail to see what was happening to him; and how long before it broke his shell and they could not escape seeing. \"Bruce\u0027s immediate family?\" said Yamamura. \"No motive, no money, no connections, no opportunity. Write \u0027em off. Can you think of any of his friends at the University who aren\u0027t eliminated by the same reasoning?\" \"No.\" \"But who\u0027s left? Clayton? What motive? And in all the months he\u0027s been here, I\u0027d have an inkling if he weren\u0027t honest. No hint of underworld tie-ins. Who\u0027s left?\" Kintyre stood before the last wall. It had the form of a ship\u0027s tilted deck. \"If I knew why,\" he said, holding his voice utterly planar, \"I think the how would follow. Why was Bruce killed? Because of something he knew. It could only be that. He was tortured to get out of him the precise extent of his knowledge, and who else might share it. That other person is the next victim. But what was in Bruce\u0027s background? A knowledge of history—the Book of Witches—correspondence with—\" His throat seemed to swell, it would not let the words out for a moment—\"with an uncle in Italy, who told him something—\" \"Something about the Mafia?\" snorted Yamamura. \"Come, now!\" \"Bruce didn\u0027t realize the significance of what he knew,\" said Kintyre. Iron bands lay across his chest. \"He couldn\u0027t have kept a secret like that. He went to X, I suppose—with—a warning? Or mere gossip, as he thought? What about? Surely not Cousin Giovanni, or the Albigensians. What else was there? Some information on crime in the Mediterranean countries. And—God help us!\" The table went over with a crash as Kintyre stood up. It was not himself who screamed: \"Margery! She\u0027s next in line!\" Himself stood among breakers and heard the mainmast split. Yamamura looked at him, cursed, and reached for the telephone. \"I\u0027m going over there,\" rattled Kintyre. \"I might get there first. I might, it might not be too late.\" \"They had all night,\" said Yamamura. His finger stabbed the dial. Kintyre blundered into the door. He thought vaguely that he ought to open it. Someone stood at his elbow. He shoved. \"Take it slow,\" said Guido. \"Let me help you.\" Yamamura said in the phone: \"Tim? This is Trig. Never mind formalities. Get a car to the apartment of Margery Towne. She may still be alive.... No, I don\u0027t remember the damned address! What\u0027s the directory for?\" \"You\u0027re in no shape to steer a car,\" said Guido. \"Where are your keys? Come on and guide me.\" Kintyre sat shaking all the way over. Guido drove with a Cossack will to arrive at which a part of Kintyre, drowning among the reefs of Taputenea, knew dim surprise. They did not beat the police, though. Officer Moffat met them on the front steps. Blankness lay in his gaze. \"We came too late,\" he said. \"Her throat\u0027s cut.\" \"I expected that,\" said Kintyre. The horror rose up and took him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3083/85103.html","bookId":961,"book":{"id":961,"title":"Murder in Black Letter","description":"简介： Steel talked between roses.
