{"id":17027,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"He didn\u0027t call ahead, but drove on down. When he parked and got out, he saw Coit Tower whitely lit above him, on the steep art-colony heights of Telegraph Hill. Not many blocks away was Fisherman\u0027s Wharf, a lot of tourist pits and a few authentic restaurants. But here he stood in a pocket of slum, before a rotting rattrap tenement. A single street lamp a block away cast a purulent light at its own foot. Elsewhere the night flowed. He heard the nearby rattle of a switch engine, pushing freight cars over iron; a battered cat slunk past him; otherwise he was alone. He walked across to the house with forced briskness, struck a match and hunted through several grimy scrawls on mailboxes before Michaelis\u0027 name came to him. Number 8. The main entrance was unlocked. The hall, dusty in threadbare carpeting, held dim electric bulbs. He heard noises through some of the doors, and smelled stale cooking. A glance told him Number 8 must be upstairs. He climbed, only now starting to wonder just how he planned to do his errand. Or what his errand was, if it came to that. Bruce had never spoken much to him of Gene Michaelis. They had been children together on the waterfront. Bruce was a year younger, doubtless a quiet bookish sort, teacher\u0027s pet, even then—but apparently unaffected by it, so that he was not disliked. Still, he must have been lonely. And Gene was a rough-and-tumble fisherman\u0027s son. Nevertheless, one of those odd fierce boy-friendships had existed between them. Bruce had probably dominated it, without either of them realizing the fact. In time they drifted apart. Gene had left high school at sixteen, Bruce had said, after some whoopdedo involving a girl; he had tramped since then, dock walloper, fry cook, bouncer, salesman—he found it easy to lie about his age. Now and then he revisited the Bay Area. His return from Navy service had been last summer, when Kintyre was still in Europe; Kintyre had never actually met him. Gene had looked up Bruce in Berkeley, and through Bruce renewed an acquaintance with Corinna, and after that Gene had moved over to San Francisco. Number 8. Kintyre heard television bray through the thin panels. He looked at his watch. Past ten o\u0027clock. Oh, hell, let\u0027s play by ear. He knocked. Feet shuffled inside. The door opened. Kintyre looked slightly upward, into a lined heavy face with a thick hook nose and small black eyes and a gray bristle of hair. The man had shoulders like a Mack truck, and there wasn\u0027t much of a belly on him yet. He wore faded work clothes. The smell of cheap wine was thick around him. \"What do you want?\" he said. \"Mr. Michaelis? My name\u0027s Kintyre. I\u0027d like to talk to you for a few minutes.\" \"We\u0027re not buying any, and if you\u0027re from the finance company you can—\" Michaelis completed the suggestion. \"Neither,\" said Kintyre mildly. \"Call me a sort of ambassador.\" Puzzled, Michaelis stood aside. Kintyre walked into a one-room apartment with a curtained-off cooking area. A wall bed was opened out, unmade. There were a few chairs, a table with a half-empty gallon of red ink on it, a television set, a tobacco haze, much dust and many old newspapers on the floor. Gene Michaelis occupied a decaying armchair. He was a young, black-haired version of his father, and would have been rather handsome if he smiled. He wore flannel pajamas which had not been washed for some time. His legs stuck rigidly out before him, ending in shoes whose heels rested on the floor. Two canes leaned within reach. He was smoking, drinking wine, and watching the screen; he did not stop when Kintyre entered. \"I\u0027m sorry the place is such a mess,\" said Peter Michaelis. He spoke fast, with an alcoholic slur. \"It\u0027s kind of hard. My wife\u0027s dead, and my son has to live with me and he can\u0027t do nothing. When I get home from looking for work, all day looking for a job, I\u0027m too tired to clean up.\" He made vague dusting motions over a chair. \"Siddown. Drink?\" \"No, thanks.\" Kintyre lowered himself. \"I came—\" \"I was already down in the world when this happened last year,\" said Michaelis. \"I owned my own boat once. Yes, I did. The Ruthie M. But then she got sunk, and there wasn\u0027t enough insurance to get another, and well, I ended up as a deckhand again. Me, who\u0027d owned my own boat.\" He sat and blinked muzzily at his guest. \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that. But—\" \"Then my wife died. Then my son come back from the Navy, and got himself hurt real bad. Both legs gone, above the knees. It took all the money I had to pay the doctors. I quit work to take care of my son. He was in a bad way. When he got so he could look after himself a little, I went looking for my job back, only I didn\u0027t get it. And since then I haven\u0027t found nothing.\" \"Well,\" said Kintyre, \"there\u0027s the welfare, and rehabilitation—\" Gene turned around and said a short obscenity. \"That\u0027s what they\u0027ll do for you,\" he added. \"They found me a job basket weaving. Basket weaving! Kee-rist, I was a gunner\u0027s mate in the Navy. Basket weaving!\" \"I\u0027m a Navy man myself,\" ventured Kintyre. \"Or was, after Pearl Harbor. Destroyers.\" \"What rank were you? A brown-nosing officer, I\u0027ll bet.\" \"Well—\" \"A brass hat. Kee-rist.\" Gene Michaelis turned back to his television. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" muttered his father. \"It\u0027s not so easy for him, you know. He was as strong and lively a young fellow as you could hope to see. God, six months ago! Now what\u0027s he got to do all day?\" \"I\u0027m not offended,\" said Kintyre. I would, in fact, be inclined to take offense only at a system of so-called education which has so little discipline left in it that its victims are unable to do more than watch this monkey show when the evil days have come. But that is not of immediate relevance. \"What did you come for?\" Peter Michaelis lifted his bull head and his voice crested: \"You know of a job?\" He sagged back again. \"No. No, you wouldn\u0027t.\" \"I\u0027m afraid not,\" said Kintyre. \"I came as—I came to help you in another way.\" Maledetto! How much like Norman Vincent Peale is one man allowed to sound? But I can\u0027t think of anything else. \"Yes?\" Michaelis sat erect; even Gene twisted half around. \"You know the Lombardi family, of course.\" \"Do we know them?\" spat Michaelis. \"I wish to hell we didn\u0027t!\" \"Have you heard that the son, Bruce, is dead?\" \"Uh-huh,\" said Gene. He turned down the sound of his program and added with a certain pleasure: \"Looks like there\u0027s some justice in the world after all.\" \"Now, wait,\" began Kintyre. Gene turned more fully to face the visitor. His eyes narrowed. \"What have you got to do with them?\" he asked. \"I knew Bruce. I thought—\" \"Sure. You thought he was God\u0027s little bare-bottomed baby angel. I know. Everybody does. It took a long time to get down past all those layers of holy grease on him. I did.\" \"You know what the old man done to me?\" shouted Peter Michaelis. \"He rammed me. Sent my boat to the bottom in 1945. He murdered two of my crew. They drowned. I could of been drowned myself!\" Kintyre remembered Bruce\u0027s account. A freakish, sudden fog had been blown down a strong wind. Such impossibilities do happen now and then. The boats blundered together and sank. The Coast Guard inquiry found it an act of God; Michaelis tried to sue, but the case was thrown out of court. Then, for the sake of their sons, Peter and Angelo made a grudging peace. What had happened lately must have brought all the old bitterness back, with a dozen years\u0027 interest added. \"Shut up,\" said Gene. He was drunk too, Kintyre saw, but cold drunk, in control of everything except his emotions. \"Shut up, Pete. It was an accident. Why should he ruin his own business?\" \"He got him a restaurant out of it,\" mumbled Michaelis. \"What have we got?\" \"Look here,\" said Kintyre, not very truthfully. \"I\u0027m a neutral party. I didn\u0027t have to come around here, and there\u0027s nothing in it for me. But will you listen?\" \"If you\u0027ll listen too,\" said Gene. He poured himself another glass. \"Huh. I know what the Lombardis been telling you about me. Let me tell you about them.\" Somewhere in the back of Kintyre\u0027s mind, a thin little warning whistle blew. He grabbed the arms of his chair and hung on tight. There was no time now to add up reasons why; he knew only that if he let Gene talk freely about Corinna, there was going to be trouble. \"Never mind,\" he said coldly. \"I\u0027m not interested in that aspect. I came here because I don\u0027t think you murdered Bruce Lombardi and the police may think you did.\" That stopped them. Peter Michaelis looked up, his face turning a drained color. Gene puckered his lips, snapped them together, and went blank of expression. His dark gaze did not waver from Kintyre\u0027s, and he said quite steadily: \"What are you getting at?\" \"Bruce was called over to the City by someone last Saturday evening,\" said Kintyre. \"His body was found Monday morning. You know very well that if you\u0027d called him, offering to patch up the quarrel, he\u0027d have come like a shot. Where were you two this weekend?\" \"Why—\" Peter Michaelis\u0027 voice wobbled. \"I was home all day Saturday—housework. Went out for a drink at night—church Sunday morning, yeah, then came back for a nap. Hey, I played pinochle down in front of the warehouse that evening with—\" His words trailed off. \"Nobody glanced in, then?\" asked Kintyre. \"No one who could verify that Bruce wasn\u0027t lying bound and gagged?\" \"Why—I—\" \"Hey!\" Gene Michaelis surged to his feet. It was a single swinging leap, propelled upward by his arms. His aluminum legs spraddled, seeking clumsily for a foothold. Somehow he got one of his canes and leaned on it. \"What business is it of yours, anyway?\" he snarled. Can I tell you that I don\u0027t know? thought Kintyre. Can I tell you I\u0027m here because a girl I\u0027d scarcely seen before now wanted me to come? Hardly. He leaned back with strained casualness and said: \"I want to make peace between your two families. Call it a gesture toward Bruce. I admit I liked him. And he never stopped liking you, Gene. \"If you keep on spewing hatred at the Lombardis as you have been, the police are going to get very interested in your weekend. Where were you?\" Gene hunched his shoulders. \"None of your God damn business.\" \"I take it you weren\u0027t home, then.\" \"No, I was not. If you want to ask any more, let\u0027s see your Junior G-man badge.\" Kintyre sighed. \"All right.\" He stood up. \"I\u0027ll go. The cops won\u0027t be so obliging, if you don\u0027t cooperate with them.\" He looked past Gene, to the window. It was a hole into total blackness. He wondered if that had been the last sight Bruce saw—of all this earth of majesty, a single smeared window opening on the dark. \"I didn\u0027t do it,\" said Gene. \"We didn\u0027t.\" He showed his teeth. \"But I say three cheers for whoever did. I\u0027d like to get the lot of \u0027em here, that sister now—\" \"Hold on!\" The violence of his tone shivered Kintyre\u0027s skull. Afterward it was a wonder to him, how rage had leaped up. Gene swayed for a moment. An unpleasant twisting went along his lips. Beside Kintyre, the father also rose, massive and watchful. \"So you\u0027d like some of that too, would you?\" said Gene. \"You won\u0027t get it. She\u0027s only a whore inside. Outside, she\u0027s like a goddam nun. You know what we call that kind where I come from? Pri—\" \"I\u0027m going,\" said Kintyre harshly. \"I prefer to be among men.\" Unthinkingly, he had chosen the crudest cut. He saw that at once. A physical creature like Gene Michaelis, whose sexual exploits must have been his one wall against every hidden inadequacy, must now be feeling nearly unmanned. Gene roared. His cane lifted and whistled down. It could have been a head-smashing blow. Kintyre stepped from it and it jarred against the floor. The cane broke across. Gene rocked forward on his artificial legs, his hands reaching out for Kintyre\u0027s throat. Kintyre planted himself passively, waiting. He didn\u0027t want to hit a cripple. Nor would fists be much use against all that bone and meat. As Gene lunged, Kintyre slipped a few inches to one side, so the clutching arm went above his shoulder. He took it in his hands, his knee helped the great body along, and Gene Michaelis crashed into the wall. As the cloud of plaster exploded, Kintyre saw the old man attack. Peter Michaelis was still as strong as a wild ox, and as wrathful. Kintyre could have killed him with no trouble. Kintyre had no wish to. Anyone could be driven berserk, given enough low-grade alcohol on top of enough wretchedness. He waited again, until the fisherman\u0027s fist came about in a round-house swing. There was time enough for a judo man to get out of the way, catch that arm, spin the opponent halfway around, and send him on his way. It would have been more scientific to throttle him unconscious, but that would have taken a few seconds and Gene was crawling back to his feet. \"Let\u0027s call it a day,\" said Kintyre. \"I\u0027m not after a fight.\" \"You—filthy—bastard.\" Gene tottered erect. Blood ran down one side of his mouth; the breath sobbed in and out of him; but he came. On the way he picked up the other cane. He tried to jab with it. Kintyre took it away from him. As simple as that—let the stick\u0027s own motion carry it out of the opponent\u0027s hand. Gene bellowed and fell. Kintyre rapped him lightly on the head, to discourage him. Someone was pounding on the door. \"What\u0027s going on in there? Hey, what\u0027s going on?\" \"I recommend you cooperate with the police,\" said Kintyre. \"Wherever you were this weekend, Gene, tell them. They\u0027ll find out eventually.\" He opened the window, went through, and hung for a moment by his hands. Father and son were sitting up, not much damaged. Kintyre straightened his elbows and let go. It wasn\u0027t too long a drop to the street, if you knew how to land. He went to his car and got in. There was no especial sense of victory within him: a growing dark feeling of his own momentum, perhaps. He had to keep moving, the horror was not yet asleep. All right, Corinna, he thought as the motor whirred to life. It was a bit childish, but he was not in any normal state. I did your job. Now I\u0027ll do one for myself. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3083/85092.html","bookId":961,"book":{"id":961,"title":"Murder in Black Letter","description":"简介： Steel talked between roses.
