{"id":17041,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 19","content":"The Phone buzzed. Kintyre snatched it up. \"Well?\" he cried. \"Trig. Headquarters has just gotten word from San Francisco. Miss Lombardi isn\u0027t home. They checked inside with the superintendent\u0027s passkey. No trace of a ruckus. Couldn\u0027t she simply have gone out?\" \"Look,\" said Kintyre. His vocal chords felt stiff. \"This concerned her own family, herself—and O\u0027Hearn, whom she had been forced to slug. I\u0027d promised to call with the latest news. Would you have stepped out, even for a minute?\" \"No. Of course, they queried her neighbors, parents, employer, and so forth. At last reports they were still getting nulls.\" \"Another thing,\" said Kintyre. \"Clayton knew she saw me last night. I mentioned it to him yesterday afternoon!\" It whistled in his receiver. Then: \"So you think he picked her up in the hope of finding out exactly where you are and what you know. Isn\u0027t that taking quite a risk?\" \"For him, it\u0027s a greater risk to remain passive,\" said Kintyre. \"Didn\u0027t we agree that if necessary he can probably buy a witness to account for a day or so absence? Though if Bruce, Guido, C-c-corinna, and I—Margery—if we\u0027ve simply been found murdered, he might not even need that. There\u0027ll be no evidence to convict him.\" \"But why should he gamble his own precious hide? Let Silenio and Larkin do this job too.\" \"No. For one thing, Corinna might have been under protection already—God, if we\u0027d had the brains to request it!\" \"Mm, yes, I see. A gangster could ring her doorbell and pull a gun when she opened, and be nabbed the next minute if the police did have a stakeout. Clayton is a friend of her family; she\u0027d invite him in and he could extract the gun in privacy after conversation had established it was safe to do so.\" \"That\u0027s it. Clayton doesn\u0027t know what we know. All he\u0027s sure of is that somebody has O\u0027Hearn. He\u0027s got to find out who.\" \"Does it matter so much? O\u0027Hearn doesn\u0027t know Clayton.\" \"But he knows Silenio, who does. Now suppose the police do have O\u0027Hearn. They won\u0027t get the facts from him in a hurry, so there\u0027ll be time to dispose of those of us who Corinna tells Clayton know more than he likes. However, eventually the police will learn a few things, and in Chicago they\u0027ll be prepared to arrest Silenio and Larkin for questioning. So he\u0027ll have to give Silenio and Larkin a prolonged vacation somewhere, till the whole affair has blown over. \"On the other hand, if I am keeping O\u0027Hearn, I can be expected to get rough. Therefore Clayton and his friends will have to act in an awful hurry. But if they succeed, all will be well for them: because I and any associates of mine will have been eliminated, in the course of rescuing O\u0027Hearn, and no clues at all will be left for the police.\" \"Games theory,\" murmured the telephone. \"You plan your strategy on the basis of the strategy your opponent would plan on the basis of the information you believe him to have. But this game is for keeps. What do you think we ought to do?\" \"Throw out a dragnet, of course,\" said Kintyre. \"As for the news angle, the knowledge we admit having—\" \"That\u0027s an obvious one. The police can handle it. Though frankly, events will probably move so fast that our news releases won\u0027t influence them one way or another. Sorry, Bob, it had to be said. \"One more item. Now that their house is unsafe, have you any idea where they\u0027ll go?\" Kintyre groaned. \"That\u0027s the one thing I can\u0027t even guess.\" \"You\u0027ve done pretty well so far,\" said the gentle tone. \"Need any help?\" \"Yes,\" said Kintyre. \"Get out there and find her.\" \"I\u0027ll do what I can,\" said Trygve Yamamura. Kintyre hung up. Guido sat knotted about a kitchen chair. \"Well?\" he asked raggedly. \"You were listening,\" said Kintyre. \"They\u0027ve got her. Give me a cigarette.\" \"My sister,\" mumbled Guido. Kintyre barked an obscenity. \"Hell of a brother she\u0027s got,\" he said. He lit up and stalked the kitchen floor. The clock said after eleven. Corinna had been taken—when? Three-plus hours ago, at a guess. But they would have had to find a place to question her. That would give a little time. They could conceivably be en route this minute. \"We\u0027re being a pair of prize schtunks,\" said Guido. \"Hm?\" Kintyre threw him a look. \"Sitting here calling each other hard names. I mean, we ought to be out searching for her.\" \"Where?\" \"Any place!\" Guido\u0027s face was drawn taut; there was a tic over his right eye. \"Every address we eliminate is something.\" \"How many houses in the Bay Area?\" Kintyre flopped onto a chair. Through the doors he had locked in himself, the horror hooted. \"Well, for Chrissake, man,\" said Guido, \"I don\u0027t mean to search the bishop\u0027s! We can think of some possible places, can\u0027t we?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Ah, spit. We\u0027re doing nobody any good. Let\u0027s go for a ride. It might clear our brains some.\" \"The great American solution. Let\u0027s go for a ride.\" Guido regarded Kintyre for a moment or so. \"Does it help you to feel superior, cat?\" he asked quietly. Kintyre\u0027s head jerked up. After a few seconds: \"Okay. I\u0027ll just phone in to let the police know we\u0027re going.\" They left the cottage and Guido took the wheel of Kintyre\u0027s old black sedan. \"Any special route, Doc?\" he inquired. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. The coast highway, southbound.\" \"State One? It\u0027s a bastardly slow drive beyond the freeway.\" \"What have we to hurry for?\" Guido slid the car into smooth motion. One-handed, he lit a fresh cigarette. \"My solitary trick,\" he said wryly. \"You sing pretty well,\" said Kintyre. \"Not as well as I might. That takes work, and I\u0027m not that interested.\" \"What are you interested in?\" Kintyre responded mechanically. \"Right now, getting her back unhurt,\" said Guido. \"Think there\u0027s a chance?\" \"I thought we were going to clear our brains,\" rapped Kintyre. They remained silent past the tollgate. Once they were on the bridge, with the quicksilver sheet of the Bay under them and San Francisco thinly misted ahead, Guido nagged: \"Where could they go? It\u0027d have to be some place nobody would hear them, no cops would come around to. Pretty short notice to rent a house again. I mean, especially when an alarm might go out with their descriptions. Of course, they could just bust into a house offered to let.\" \"The police will be checking that.\" \"Uh-huh. Only Doc, wouldn\u0027t they expect it and try to outsmart the police? Dig me? Let\u0027s turn off at the ramp. I\u0027m a waterfront kid, I know some old places where you could get in and—\" \"Would they know about it?\" snorted Kintyre. \"I suppose not.\" Crestfallen, Guido held the car in the middle lane. When they got onto the southbound freeway, he opened up. Kintyre, a conservative driver, had never pressed his car to the limit. Now he saw the needle hover at ninety; wind snapped by the doors. \"You want a ticket?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t much care,\" said Guido roughly. \"Man, I got to do something, don\u0027t I? If I can\u0027t help her, I got to do something.\" The minutes passed. No patrol car sirened at them. There was not, indeed, much traffic at this time of a Thursday. As they fled south, onto the old two-lane highway, the sky grew overcast. \"Nuts,\" said Guido. \"There\u0027ll be fog along the coast. We\u0027ll have to crawl. Let\u0027s turn back.\" \"No,\" said Kintyre. \"Keep going.\" Guido stole an indignant look at him. \"Wait a second,\" he began. \"Keep going, I said!\" Kintyre roared it. Guido started. Then, shrugging, he gave his attention back to the road. \"Is it that important?\" he asked. Kintyre didn\u0027t answer because he didn\u0027t know. He sat hunched into passivity, not caring how fast they went or if they crashed. It shouldn\u0027t matter to him where he was taken. But it did. He couldn\u0027t tell why—damn that fouled subconscious of mine, anyway! But it was like a hand upon him. Perhaps it was only that he had to get back for a while to the great shouting decency of the ocean. \"You\u0027re a funny one, Doc,\" said Guido after a long time. \"Aren\u0027t we all?\" \"You\u0027re crazy, even for a human being. I mean, you\u0027re the cat who\u0027s had the adventurous life, got the culture, made the big success—oh, yes, you don\u0027t get paid much, but you know damn well how far you\u0027ve succeeded and how much further you can go—you\u0027re everything Bruce wanted to be. Hell, you\u0027re everything I wish I wanted to be. And you can\u0027t wait to die!\" Kintyre said, jarred: \"That isn\u0027t true. I\u0027m just in a bad mood.\" \"So am I, Doc, so am I. Think I dare let myself imagine about Corinna? Think I enjoy realizing how poorly I\u0027ve shown up in the last few days? But I keep going. What is it makes you fold up?\" Kintyre turned his face from the bluffs now humping up around him, toward Guido. There was a radiation of vitality from the other man; something had disfigured it, so that his days ran out in pettiness, but he would always be more alive than most. \"Why do you stay around here?\" asked Kintyre slowly. \"Man, I like it.\" \"Can\u0027t you see it\u0027s poison for you? As long as you stay where you were a child, you\u0027ll always be one. If you could get away, you\u0027d have a chance to grow up.\" Guido reddened. \"Thanks, Mother Superior.\" \"I\u0027m not trying to insult you. I\u0027m only thinking, your trouble could be caused by a situation. A place. Did you get overseas in the Army?\" \"No, unless you count Alaska.\" \"And of course it wasn\u0027t your kind of life. All you\u0027d think about would be going home. But suppose you went somewhere else, someplace congenial—and stayed. I wonder if you mightn\u0027t feel like buckling down. You could still make a name for yourself, or at least a fair living, as an entertainer. If you\u0027d try.\" \"Go where?\" \"Well, Trig Yamamura has connections in Honolulu. Or via people I know, we could probably finagle a start in New York, if you\u0027d rather. The main point would be, stay away from here! For a few years anyhow, till you got your feet well planted.\" Guido said in a low voice: \"I\u0027ve thought the same from time to time. But Bruce was the only one who ever got behind me and pushed, and he didn\u0027t have any such contacts.\" He smiled. \"Could be, Doc, that blue funk of yours is also situational. If I need to get away, maybe you need to settle down. Dig? Pipe, slippers, a wife and a lot of runny-nosed kids to worry about, instead of whatever dead thing it was that happened years ago.\" \"Let\u0027s quit the personal remarks,\" said Kintyre. They drove on. The sea came into view, tumbling at the foot of steep yellowish cliffs. It was a cold, etched gray, under a gray sky. There was no clear horizon, sky and water ran together in mist. Guido had to slow down somewhat on the curves, but he managed a dangerous speed. Tires squealed and once he passed another car on a hill and avoided collision only by some inspired steering. When they had left Berkeley more than an hour behind, he asked: \"How far do you want to go, anyway?\" \"Go on,\" said Kintyre. \"How come?\" Kintyre didn\u0027t answer. At Half Moon Bay, the beach was empty and the clustered cabins forlorn; fog had closed in until you could not see past the breakers. It was clammy out there. \"Never liked the coast myself,\" said Guido. \"She did—does, God damn it! She\u0027s queer for beach picnics. Likes to play volley ball and make sand castles.\" Kintyre unclenched his fists. \"If we don\u0027t get her back,\" said Guido, almost matter-of-factly, \"of course I can\u0027t leave home. The old lady won\u0027t have nobody left but me.\" He crammed his foot on the gas. The car spurted ahead. The ground climbed again. Presently they were on a deserted stretch. The land fell too abruptly to attract visitors: most places had no way down to the water. Sere brown hills lifted on the east side of the highway, trees huddled along them in clumps. The fog came streaming over the road. \"Now what?\" said Guido. \"It\u0027ll be socked in farther south.\" \"Continue,\" said Kintyre. \"Like hell!\" Mutiny leaped on the dark snub face. \"I\u0027ve gone far enough. How d\u0027you know they don\u0027t need us back in town?\" Kintyre felt his muscles congeal. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" Guido stamped on the brakes. The car skidded to a halt. Kintyre shuddered. The horror screamed, once, and drained from him. He knew remotely that it was not conquered—not yet—but his disintegrated self had coalesced for at least the time during which all of him would be needed. He said, hearing his voice like another man\u0027s: \"Can you push this car back up to ninety going onward?\" \"Huh?\" \"I think I know where Corinna is.\" Guido\u0027s hands slackened on the wheel. Suddenly they tensed again. The car growled from the shoulder and began to accumulate speed. \"I don\u0027t want to pile us up,\" said Guido, \"but I guess I could average fifty. Where is she?\" \"Do you know Point Perro?\" \"I don\u0027t believe so.\" \"It\u0027s a little privately owned cove. Not far to go now. It\u0027s fenced off, posted, and there\u0027s nothing from the road to indicate it even has a beach. You couldn\u0027t find a lonelier spot in a day\u0027s driving.\" Cloven air bawled past the windows. Guido squinted into thickening fog. He could only see a few yards ahead before the gray curtain fell; he had to imagine when the turns were coming up, and take them on two wheels. All at once Kintyre was terrified of an accident. \"I mentioned it to Clayton a couple of days ago,\" he said. The words came out one by one. \"I seem to have forgotten that—down underneath, perhaps, I didn\u0027t want to admit to myself I\u0027d given him any help—but I don\u0027t think it was coincidence I chose this route. Never mind. Clayton is an Easterner. His time out here has been spent entirely in the respectable sections of the Bay Area. Silenio and Larkin are complete strangers. How would they know where to take her, except some such randomly learned-about spot as this? At least, it\u0027s one chance for us. One chance!\" Guido said above the wind, the engine, and the wheels: \"If you\u0027re right, Doc, it\u0027s even a good chance. An Easterner would drive a lot slower than me along this route, especially when they hit the fog. We might catch up to them.\" \"They\u0027ve had hours,\" said Kintyre. \"On the other hand, they had to meet each other too, and confer. They\u0027re not supermen, they would try to think of something, and argue about their plans, for a long time while they just drove aimlessly, surely not in this direction. We can hope.\" \"If they\u0027ve done anything to her,\" said Guido, his face the mask of flayed Marsyas, \"I myself will—\" \"You\u0027ll let me off at Point Perro,\" said Kintyre. \"Then burn up the motor getting to a phone. Don\u0027t waste time on any sheriff\u0027s office, call Berkeley headquarters direct. They can call the local authorities for you. It should actually be quicker that way.\" \"You, though,\" said Guido. \"I can\u0027t leave you alone with them.\" \"Do you want to help Corinna, or do you want to get yourself sliced open for no purpose at all? You\u0027re a better driver, so you can get help sooner. I\u0027ll have a better chance of delaying matters down in the cove.\" \"I suppose so.\" Guido spoke it with difficulty. \"\u0027One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves,\u0027\" recited Kintyre in Machiavelli\u0027s Italian. \"\u0027Those that wish to be only lions do not understand this.\u0027\" Guido laughed shakily. \"Modest fellow,\" he said. Kintyre would have liked to clap his shoulder, but dared not. They were going seventy miles an hour on a winding road and it was becoming less visible each minute. \"Good for you,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll salvage you yet.\" After another mile: \"Or do you even need it any more?\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3083/85106.html","bookId":961,"book":{"id":961,"title":"Murder in Black Letter","description":"简介： Steel talked between roses.
