{"id":17040,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"\"Clayton,\" said Kintyre. \"Huh?\" The pipe almost dropped from Yamamura\u0027s hand. \"What the hell! Why, for God\u0027s sake?\" \"Bruce got too much information about Clayton\u0027s rackets.\" \"What rackets? Clayton\u0027s straight! I never heard a hint—\" \"Oh, yes. He\u0027s straight enough on this side of the Atlantic.\" Yamamura muttered something profane. \"How do you know?\" he added. \"It fits the facts. Bruce was corresponding with his uncle Luigi, the secret service man. Some discussion of highly organized postwar crime syndicates in the Mediterranean countries came up. Now Clayton was a go-getter type who\u0027d lost everything he had three times in a row: the Depression, his first wife\u0027s death, divorce from his second wife. It must have embittered him, so that he determined he would never again be poor and defenseless. He came to Italy as a Quartermaster officer in the war. Perfect chance for black marketing, if a man didn\u0027t mind taking a few risks. The miracle is not that a few QM people went bad but that most stayed honest. Clayton probably started in a very small way with cigarettes and K rations. But by the end of the war he was in touch with some pretty big figures in the Italian underworld, and saw the opportunities. He came right back after his discharge and went to work at it full time. \"Obviously, he\u0027s a hell of a good organizer. He got in on the postwar reconstruction of crime, along lines borrowed from gangland and Communism. He probably set out as a currency black marketeer, working through Switzerland. He soon expanded into other things, smuggling, dope, prostitution, gambling, the works. He became rich.\" \"Have you any proof of all this?\" interrupted Yamamura. \"Chiefly, that it and only it will fit the facts. Let me go on, I\u0027ll fill in evidence as I proceed. The trouble with Clayton\u0027s riches was, they were mostly in lire, French francs, and other soft valuta. Also, governments all get nosy about resident aliens; he couldn\u0027t hope to avoid suspicion forever, without a good cover. He solved both his problems by becoming an importer. He bought European goods with his European money, shipped them over here, and sold them for dollars. On this side he\u0027s lily white, and familiar with prominent Americans of unquestionable integrity. Knowing this, Europeans don\u0027t think he might be something else on their continent. You can imagine the details.\" \"Yes,\" said Yamamura. \"I can.\" \"Now for some facts as well as theories. Let\u0027s go back to Uncle Luigi. He\u0027s trying to break these syndicates, one of which is headed by the eminent Signor Clayton. Of course, because of its cell organization, Luigi and his colleagues don\u0027t know that. If they did, they could crack a lot of rackets open. All they have against Clayton is that a few of his business associates have bad associates of their own, notably some of the deported Italian-American gangsters. But what of it? Everybody outside a monastery must know some dubious characters. \"Well, because Clayton came here to work at opening a San Francisco branch, and because he brought the Liber Veneficarum along, he got to know Bruce. In fact, they came to be on very friendly terms. Clayton is genial enough, if you don\u0027t get in his way. Uncle Luigi, being somewhat anti-American, insisted that Signor Clayton had an unfair advantage, having started as a wealthy man with lots of dollars. That didn\u0027t fit with Clayton\u0027s own rags-to-riches story. Bruce got indignant, checked up, and established that Clayton had indeed been almost penniless when he came to Italy. And Luigi, as I mentioned before, had also happened to give Bruce some facts regarding crime, corruption, and the syndicates. \"I don\u0027t know just when Clayton learned about all this discussion. Perhaps a week ago last Sunday, when he saw Bruce over in the City and refused to give Guido a job. Clayton admits Bruce got mad; perhaps he said things then. Clayton smoothed his feathers and agreed to interview Guido next day. Maybe Clayton was already spinning a plan. \"Or it may have been amicable. Bruce had no reason to suspect Clayton of anything. We\u0027d have known it otherwise; Bruce was constitutionally incapable of keeping a secret. Maybe in the love feast following his explosion, he blurted out how he had triumphantly refuted Uncle Luigi\u0027s sneers at the Horatio Alger rise of Gerald Clayton, and planned to send Uncle Luigi all the facts and demand an apology. At the same time, Bruce could have spoken about the syndicates. He was just na?ve enough to have warned Clayton, who spent half his time overseas, to look out for the mobs! Well, one way or another, Clayton drew him out, doubtless in that conference they had after Guido was dismissed. Clayton was alerted.\" It was peculiar, thought Kintyre, that he could talk so coolly while the horror was on him. But he had the horror locked away for this short time, he heard it speaking but did not really feel it. \"He could have pumped both brothers on Monday,\" nodded Yamamura. \"Bruce in particular, but he would have seen how Guido might be made into a decoy—uh-huh. So he called a Chicago mob. But—\" \"But why? Isn\u0027t it obvious, Trig? Bruce and Luigi were corresponding on two subjects which would explode if they were ever fitted together: Clayton and the Old World rackets. When Bruce revealed that Clayton had not, after all, started by depositing American dollars in Swiss banks, Luigi would begin to wonder. Bruce had even casually agreed that Clayton might have picked up a little loose change originally on the black bourse, which did not strike him as very heinous. Luigi might see deeper possibilities along those lines. Or things Luigi wrote could even make Bruce wonder, who knows? It wouldn\u0027t necessarily happen either way, but it was too big a risk to take. The American government itself, if it gets interested, has ways to check on its citizens abroad. So Bruce had to be eliminated. And he had to be questioned first, in detail, to learn precisely what he did know and who else knew. For instance, was Luigi already so well informed as to be dangerous? This was a job for professionals.\" \"And there\u0027s where your theory creaks,\" said Yamamura. \"If Clayton is so law-abiding on American soil, where could he dig up his butcher boys on such short notice?\" \"That hint was in Bruce\u0027s files,\" said Kintyre. \"Your information about Clayton\u0027s telephoning adds detail. He must have called one of his not-very-respectable Italian associates. I seem to remember the name Dolce, you can try that on the switchboard girl for recognitionor. Does the phone office keep records of such things? I don\u0027t know. Let\u0027s assume he called Dolce, to give the man a name. He ordered him: \u0027Get hold of a recent deportee from America\u0027—you can guess who better than I, Trig—\u0027and ask him how I can get in touch with a professional killer in this country.\u0027 He may have phrased it more euphemistically, but that was the sense of it. Next day Dolce or whoever called back. (Why else should a busy man like Clayton hang around home? Why not take the call in his office? Because his office deals directly with Italy, the switchboard girl there probably speaks the language and might eavesdrop.) Thus Clayton got the number of Silenio, and any passwords or the like that were needed. He went out to a pay booth and called him. O\u0027Hearn has told us the rest.\" Yamamura nodded. \"Could be,\" he said. \"Tell me what else will explain the facts. And let me continue. Clayton came over here last Thursday on business, and threw a party in his suite for historians and literary scholars, including Bruce and me. I rather imagine he was looking for another red herring. Owens must have been promising. Not that Owens seems to have been jockeyed into anything, as Guido was, but Clayton dropped hints detrimental to him later on. \"Clayton made sure of being alibied the whole weekend. Of course, it was simple enough to make the call which lured Bruce to his death. He could have phoned from a pay booth right in sight of the world. I don\u0027t know what he told Bruce, probably that he might have something for Guido after all but it was confidential. Make your own lie. \"Monday he returned to the City. Silenio reported to him, got paid off, and was told to wait. Clayton had a problem: Bruce\u0027s files were still in Margery\u0027s apartment. Silenio would have learned that. Clayton had to choke off this last source of information. He came back here Tuesday and invited me to lunch with him. I gave him some idea of how well his tracks really were covered—and when I told him Margery\u0027s place had already been raided, it was a shock. He questioned me, found that the papers he was after were still unread, and deftly turned suspicion back on Owens: where for once it actually belonged. However, he must have felt the need to act fast. So he stayed in Berkeley, though he\u0027d told me at lunch he planned to go back to San Francisco. (Will any hypothesis of yours explain why he changed his mind and spent more than twenty-four unproductive hours on this side? He, the animated cash register?) I met him again on Wednesday, when we had our run-in with Owens.\" Kintyre sighed. \"That\u0027s the damnable part of it. I sat there drinking coffee with the true, ultimate murderer. He urged me to take Margery out. I told him I had another engagement. If I had gone out with her, she\u0027d be alive. God, if she\u0027d dated him she might be! He was going to ask her. She told me, when I mentioned it, that she would refuse his invitation. He wanted to get her out of the way. But when she stayed— \"I helped her read those letters!\" \"Slow down there,\" said Yamamura. It was still later when the detective went back outdoors. An officer was watching Guido, who was laying out a solitaire hand on the stoop. The policeman said: \"Inspector Harries would like to get a formal statement from you at headquarters, sir.\" Yamamura nodded. Guido raised his brows and slanted his head at the cottage. \"Could be worse,\" said Yamamura. \"Suppose you leave him alone for an hour or so and then go in and make him some lunch.\" \"Sure,\" said Guido. The policeman followed Yamamura out the drive. At the station, he was shown directly into Harries\u0027 office. The inspector was just laying down the phone. \"San Francisco,\" he said. \"They raided that address. Traces of occupancy, but nobody home.\" \"Any other news?\" Yamamura sat down and folded his long legs. \"They let the Michaelises go. Gene broke down when they did—reaction, I guess—and admitted where he\u0027d been Saturday night and Sunday. Shacked up.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t think he\u0027d try to hide that. He\u0027d have bragged.\" \"This time he had two metal legs and he paid. Not much, he hasn\u0027t got much, but he paid, for the first time in his life.\" \"Poor bastard. I can imagine how he feels.\" \"Well,\" said Harries, \"what does Kintyre think?\" Yamamura told him. Harries whistled. \"That wouldn\u0027t even get past a grand jury,\" he said. \"It\u0027s a line worth further investigation, though,\" said Yamamura mildly. \"I wonder where Clayton is right now?\" Harries snatched up the phone. Yamamura waited. The inspector hung up with a bang. \"Not at the Fairhill. I\u0027ll try his place in the City, and the office. Know the numbers?\" Presently: \"Not there, either. Well, it\u0027s no crime. But I\u0027ll put a man on it.\" \"About releasing information to the press,\" said Yamamura. \"Could you withhold any mention of Kintyre? He\u0027s in no shape to see reporters, or even tell them to go away.\" \"Glad to,\" said Harries. \"We\u0027re going to sit on the facts as much as possible. We\u0027ll get the papers to cooperate. Why let the killers know what we know? They can guess we hold O\u0027Hearn, but not that O\u0027Hearn squealed.\" \"Good. Now let me make that statement so I can get back to my own office. Maybe a client has shown up, for a change.\" None had. Yamamura polished his new sword. A thought nagged the back of his being. If Clayton was guilty, why should Clayton disappear? Harries was right, Kintyre\u0027s reasoning was skeletal. Without further evidence, it wouldn\u0027t be enough to arrest a dog for flea scratching. Clayton would do best to sit tight and be wronged righteousness. But did he know that? O\u0027Hearn had been sent after Guido merely because Larkin had gotten in a fight at the Alley Cat. If Larkin had not remembered the name \"Kintyre\" and reported it through Silenio, Clayton could still have made a shrewd guess at it. Yamamura picked up his own phone and dialed. \"Hi, Bob. How goes it?\" \"I\u0027m breathing,\" said Kintyre listlessly. \"Nobody at the murder house. Clayton has dropped from sight, too. You and Guido could be the next targets. Want a police guard?\" \"No. He wouldn\u0027t be stupid enough to try for us just now,\" said Kintyre, without great interest. \"Especially when he doesn\u0027t know how much I know. He would establish that first—yes, that would need his personal attention. Let\u0027s reconstruct it.\" He voiced his thoughts as they ran, in flat metallic words. \"Larkin and Silenio got back from their—their mission—and didn\u0027t find O\u0027Hearn at the house. They waited till they got alarmed, then bolted and called Clayton in Berkeley. That would have been in the small hours, before sunrise. Clayton could have called the old Lombardis, pretending to be an anxious friend, and found Guido had not come home. The same pretense might have worked with the San Francisco police—nope, they had no word of any Guido Lombardi—no O\u0027Hearn. He would also have drawn a blank in Berkeley. So. Somebody picked them both up. In view of the Alley Cat episode, he would suspect me. I remember now my phone rang, early in the morning. I didn\u0027t answer. Was that him, trying to check if I was at home? If he drove by, he\u0027d have seen my shades pulled. He had no way of knowing O\u0027Hearn was right here. He would have concluded: either I had nothing to do with it, or I had taken O\u0027Hearn somewhere for private investigation. \"If he rubbed me out and I was innocent of meddling, well, too bad. He dared not assume anything except that Guido and I had O\u0027Hearn—where? If he could track us down and dispose of us—of anyone who might finger him—yes, then later on he could bribe someone, a call girl perhaps, to give him a perjured alibi for the time involved, if any alibi was ever needed. Then nothing could ever be proved about his misdeeds on this side of the water. Of course, the Italian police and American foreign agents might be clued to his overseas work—but at worst he could stay home, or retire to some South American country that won\u0027t extradite him. But all this, avoiding arrest long enough to regain his balance, it all hinges on finding me—\" Kintyre\u0027s voice trailed off. Yamamura heard the receiver crash down. Somewhat later his phone rang again. Kintyre said like a machine: \"Trig, you can get the official ear quicker than I. Last night Corinna said she\u0027d wait home till I called. I just did. There\u0027s no answer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3083/85105.html","bookId":961,"book":{"id":961,"title":"Murder in Black Letter","description":"简介： Steel talked between roses.
