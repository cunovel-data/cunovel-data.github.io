{"id":17026,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"Not until evening was Kintyre free to cross the bridge into San Francisco. He had spent hours on Bruce\u0027s uncorrected papers, and talked with Yamamura, who said he would sniff around, and he had called Margery on the phone to see if she was all right. \"Come over and take potluck, Bob,\" she said. He sensed loneliness. But—hell\u0027s boiling pots, she made him feel cluttered! \"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t,\" he evaded. \"Commitments. But take it easy, huh? Go visit someone, go have a cup of espresso, don\u0027t sit home and nest on your troubles. I\u0027ll see you soon.\" He poured himself a small drink after hanging up and tossed it off. Then he changed into his darkest suit and got the car rolling. Personally, he would not have placarded a loss on his clothes, but Bruce\u0027s parents were from the Old World. As he hummed along the freeway and over the great double span of the bridge (Bruce must have been carried dead in the opposite direction, wedged in a corner so the tollgate guard would think him merely asleep; doubtless the police were checking the memories of all night shift men) Kintyre rehearsed the career of the Lombardis. Bruce was the only one he had really known, though he had been over there for dinner a few times. The parents had been very respectful, innocently happy that their son should be friends with a Doctor of Philosophy. His mother made good pasta.... There wasn\u0027t much to remember. Angelo Lombardi was a Genoese sailor. Chronic hard times were not improved when his son Guido came along. Nor did he see much of his young wife. (Did Maria\u0027s years of being mostly alone in a dingy tenement, with nobody to love but one little boy, account for what Guido had become?) In 1930 the family arrived as immigrants at San Francisco. Here Angelo worked in the commercial fishing fleet; here Bruce and the daughter were born; here he saved enough money to buy his own boat; here he lost it again in a collision—by God, yes, it had been a collision with Peter Michaelis\u0027 single craft. Feeling the years upon him, Angelo used the insurance money to start a restaurant. It had neither failed nor greatly prospered: it gave him a living and little more. Yet Angelo Lombardi had remained a man with hope. Kintyre turned off at the first ramp, twisted through the downtown area, and got onto Columbus Avenue and so to North Beach. Hm, let\u0027s see—a minor street near the Chinatown fringe—uh-huh. The sky was just turning purple when he stopped in front of the place: Genoa Café set in a two-story frame building perpetrated, with bays and turrets, right after the 1906 fire. It was flanked by a Chinese grocery store, full of leathery fragrances, and a Portuguese Baptist mission. A sign on the door said closed. Well, the old people would be in no mood for discussing the various types of pizza tonight. Yellow light spilled from the upper windows. Kintyre found the door to the upstairs apartment and rang the bell. A street lamp blinked to life, a car went by, a grimy urchin watched him impassively from a doorway across the road. He felt much alone. He heard feet coming down the stairs, a woman\u0027s light quick tread. Expecting Maria Lombardi, he took off his hat and bowed in Continental style when the door opened. He stopped halfway through the gesture and remained staring. Morna, he thought, and he stood on the schooner\u0027s deck as it heeled to the wind, and she was grasping the mainmast shrouds with one hand, crouched on the rail and shading her eyes across an ocean that glittered. Her yellow hair blew back into his face, it smelled of summer. \"Yes?\" Kintyre shook himself, like a dog come out of a deep hurried river. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he stammered. \"I\u0027m sorry. You startled me, looked like someone I used to—\" He pulled the chilly twilight air into his lungs, until he could almost feel them stretch. One by one, his muscles relaxed. \"Miss Lombardi, isn\u0027t it?\" he tried again. \"I haven\u0027t seen you for a couple of years, and you wore your hair differently then. I\u0027m Robert Kintyre.\" \"Oh, yes. I remember you well,\" she said. Her mouth turned a little upward, its tautness gentling. \"Bruce\u0027s professor. He spoke of you so often. It\u0027s very kind of you to come.\" She stood aside to let him precede her. His hand brushed hers accidentally in the narrow entrance. Halfway up the stairs, he realized he was holding the fist clenched. What is this farce? he asked himself angrily. Nothing more than straight blonde hair, worn in bangs across the forehead and falling to the shoulders. Now in the full electric light he could see that it wasn\u0027t even the same hue, a good deal darker than Morna\u0027s weather-bleached mane. And Corinna Lombardi was a mature woman—young, he recalled Bruce\u0027s going over to the City last month for her twenty-second birthday party—but grown. Morna would always be thirteen. Corinna had been nineteen when he saw her last, still living here and working in the café. That was at a little farewell dinner the Lombardis had given him, before he departed for his latest year in Italy. They had wanted him to look up Angelo\u0027s brother Luigi, the one who had made a success in the old country as a secret service man. Kintyre had visited Luigi a few times, finding him a pleasant sort with scholarly inclinations, most interested in his brilliant nephew Bruce, with whom he corresponded. At any rate, Kintyre had had too much else to think about to pay much attention to a quiet girl. By the time he returned, as Bruce told him, she had left home after a spectacular quarrel with her parents. That was soon repaired—it had only been a declaration of independence—but she had kept her own job and her own apartment since then. The rambling of his mind soothed him. At the time he did not realize that, down underneath, his mind was telling itself about Corinna Lombardi. It decided that she had few elements of conventional prettiness. She was tall, and her figure was good except that the shoulders were too wide and the bust too small for this decade\u0027s canons. Her face was broad, with high cheek-bones and square jaw and straight strong nose; it had seen a good deal of sun. Her eyes were greenish-gray under heavy dark brows, her mouth was wide and full, her voice was low. She wore a black dress, as expected, and a defiant bronze pin in the shape of a weasel. Then Kintyre had emerged on the landing, and Angelo Lombardi—thickset, heavy-faced, balding—engulfed his hand in an enormous sailor\u0027s paw. \"Come in, sir, please to come in and have a small glass with us.\" Maria Lombardi rose for the Doctor of Philosophy. Her light-brown hair and clear profile told whence her children had their looks; he suspected that much of the brains had come from her too. \"How do you do, Professor Keen-teer. We thank you for coming.\" He sat down, awkwardly. Overstuffed and ghastly, the living room belonged to a million immigrants of the last generation, who had built from empty pockets up to the middle class. But families like this would eat beans oftener than necessary for twenty years, so they could save enough to put one child through college. Bruce had been the one. \"I just came to express my sympathy,\" said Kintyre. He felt himself under the cool green appraisal of Corinna\u0027s eyes, but could not think of words less banal. \"Can I do anything to help? Anything at all?\" \"You are very kind,\" said old Lombardi. He poured from what was evidently his best bottle of wine. \"Everyone has been so kind.\" \"Do you know what his room was like, the past half of a year, Professor?\" asked Maria. \"He never invited us there.\" I rather imagine not, thought Kintyre wryly. \"Nothing unusual,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll bring you his personal effects as soon as I can.\" \"Professor,\" said Lombardi. He leaned his bulk forward very slowly. The glass shivered in his fingers. \"You knew my son so well. What do you think happen to him?\" \"I only know what the police told me,\" said Kintyre. Maria crossed herself. She closed her eyes, and he did not watch her moving lips; that conversation didn\u0027t concern him. \"My son he was murdered,\" said Lombardi in an uncomprehending voice. \"Why did they murder him?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" insisted Kintyre. \"The police will find out.\" Corinna left her chair and came around to stand before the men. It was a long stride, made longer by wrath. She put her hands on her hips and said coldly: \"Dr. Kintyre, you\u0027re not na?ve. You must know murder is one of the safest crimes there is to commit. What\u0027s the actual probability that they\u0027ll ever learn who did it, when they claim they haven\u0027t even a motive to guide them?\" Kintyre couldn\u0027t help bristling a trifle. She was tired and filled with grief, but he had done nothing to rate such a tone. He clipped off his words: \"If you think you have a clue, Miss Lombardi, you should take it to the authorities, not to me.\" \"I did,\" she said harshly. \"They were polite to the hysterical female. They\u0027ll look into it, sure. And when they see he has an alibi—as he will!—they won\u0027t look any further.\" Maria stood up. \"Corinna!\" she exclaimed. \"Basta, figliolaccia!\" The girl wrenched free of her mother\u0027s hand. \"Oh, yes,\" she said, \"that\u0027s how it was with the policeman too. With everybody. Don\u0027t pick on the poor cripple. Haven\u0027t you been enough of a jinx to him? Don\u0027t you see, that\u0027s exactly what he thinks! That\u0027s why he killed Bruce!\" An inner door opened, and a man entered the room. He was thirty years old, with a strong burly frame turning a little fat. He was good-looking in a dark heavy-lipped way, his hair black and curly, his eyes a restless rusty brown, nose snubbed and jaw underslung. He wore tight black trousers with a silver stripe, a cummerbund, a white silk shirt open halfway down his chest; he carried a cased guitar under one arm. \"Oh,\" he said. \"I thought somebody\u0027d come. Hello, Doc.\" \"Hello, Guido,\" said Kintyre, not getting up. He had nothing personally against Bruce\u0027s older brother, who had been quite a charming devil the few casual times they met. However—\"He who does not choose the path of good, chooses to take the path of evil,\" said Machiavelli\u0027s Discourses: and Guido had been an anchor around more necks than one. \"Don\u0027t get in a bind, kitten,\" he said to his sister. \"I could hear you making with the grand opera a mile upwind.\" She whirled about on him, shaking, and said: \"You could let him get cold before you went back to that club to sing your dirty little songs.\" \"My girl, you speak the purest B.S., as Bruce would have been the first to tell you.\" Guido smiled, took out a cigarette one-handed and stuck it in his mouth. \"I was out of town the whole weekend, just when the cats go real crazy. If I don\u0027t make with it tonight, the man will ignite me, and what good would that do Bruce?\" He flipped out a book of matches, opened it and struck one, all with the same expert hand. Corinna\u0027s gaze went from face to face, and a beaten look crept into it. \"Nobody cares,\" she whispered. \"Just nobody cares.\" She sat down. Lombardi twisted his fingers, looking wretched; Maria folded herself stiffly into a chair; Guido leaned on the doorjamb and blew smoke. Kintyre felt, obscurely, that it depended on him to ease the girl. He said: \"Please, Miss Lombardi. We don\u0027t mean that. But what can we do? We\u0027d only get in the way of the police.\" \"I know, I know.\" She got it out between her teeth, while she looked at the floor. \"Let George do it. Isn\u0027t that the motto of this whole civilization? Someday George isn\u0027t going to be around to do it, and we\u0027ll have gotten too flabby to help ourselves.\" It paralleled some of his own thinking so closely that he was startled. But he said, \"Well, you can\u0027t declare a vendetta, can you?\" \"Oh, be quiet!\" She looked up at him with a smoldering under her brows. \"Of course I don\u0027t mean that. But I know who must have done it, and I know he\u0027ll have some kind of story, and no one will look past that story, because he seems like such a pathetic case. And he isn\u0027t! I know Gene and Peter Michaelis. They got what was coming to them!\" \"Too much!\" roared Lombardi. \"Now you be still!\" She ignored him. Her eyes would not release Kintyre\u0027s. \"Well?\" she said after a moment. He wondered if it was only her misery which clawed at him, or if she was always such a harpy. He said with great care: \"Well, in theory any of us could be guilty. I might have done it because Bruce was—going around with a girl I used to know. Or Guido here—jealousy? A quarrel? I assume we have merely his word he was out of town on Saturday and Sunday. Shall we also ask the police to check every minute of his weekend?\" The man in the doorway flushed. \"Dig that,\" he said slowly. \"So you\u0027re going to—\" \"Nothing of the sort,\" rapped Kintyre. \"I was trying to show how a private suspicion is no grounds for—\" Guido took a long drag on his cigarette, snuffed it in a horrible souvenir ashtray, and left without a word. They heard his footfalls go down the stairs. \"I am so sorry, Mister Professor,\" faltered Lombardi. \"Niente affatto, signor.\" Kintyre stood up. \"All of you are worn out.\" He essayed a smile at Corinna. \"You were echoing some of my own principles. We pessimists ought to stick together.\" She did not even turn her face toward him. But her profile was one he could imagine on Nike of Samothrace, the Victory which strides in the wind. \"I\u0027ve always thought principles should be acted on,\" she told him sullenly. \"Corinna!\" said Maria. Her daughter paid no attention. Kintyre took his leave in a confusion of apologies. When he stood alone on the dusky street, he whistled. That had been no fun. But now it was over with. He could let things cool down for a week or so, then deliver Bruce\u0027s possessions, and say farewell with an insincere promise to \"look you up soon, when I get the chance.\" And there would be an end of that. But he had thought for a heartbeat she was Morna come home to him. His fingers were wooden, hunting for a cigarette; he dropped the pack on the sidewalk before getting one out. He could feel the first onset of the horror, moving up along the channels of his brain. Sometimes, he thought with a remnant of coolness, sometimes distraction could head off the trouble. If he could get involved in something outside himself, and yet important to himself, so that his whole attention was engaged, the horror might retreat. He yanked smoke into his lungs, blew it forth, tossed the cigarette to the paving and stamped on it. Then he went into the grocery. There was a public phone on the wall, he leafed through the directory until he found the name.
