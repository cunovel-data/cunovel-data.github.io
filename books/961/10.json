{"id":17031,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"Kintyre stood for a little while more, scarcely thinking. Then, during an instant, he had a vision of tiny black devils fluttering through the half-open window, lifting the volume and squeaking their way out on quick charred wings. But no, no, this was the twentieth century. We are rational, we don\u0027t believe in witchcraft, we are scientific and believe in vitamin pills, Teamwork, and the inalienable right of every language to have a country of its own. Also, the phase of the moon was wrong, and—and— His mind steadied. He whirled about the desk, to see if the book had somehow slid off. No. He snatched up the phone and called the main office. Had anyone come into his room in the past twenty minutes? We don\u0027t know, Dr. Kintyre. No, we did not pick up your book. No, we didn\u0027t see anyone. He put back the instrument and tried to start his thoughts. It was curiously hard. He tended to repeat himself. Someone must have come in. Yes, someone must have come in. It would be easy to do, unobserved. Someone must have come in and taken the book. What the hell had Margery\u0027s apartment been burgled for? That snapped him back to wakefulness. If, as Clayton had suggested yesterday, the burglar was after this volume and hadn\u0027t found it, the University was the next logical place to try. Owens! I told him I\u0027d go out to eat. He could have watched the entrance. But where was he now?—Wait. Close your eyes, let the mind float free, don\u0027t strain too hard—memory bobbed to the surface. Owens had mentioned taking a room in the Bishop, a hotel conveniently near campus. Kintyre forced himself into steadiness. If Owens had copped the book, Owens would want to get rid of it. Permanently. But leather and parchment don\u0027t burn easily. Dumping it meant too much chance of its being noticed and recovered. Owens would take it to Los Angeles with him, to destroy at leisure. He was probably packing at this moment. Kintyre tucked Bruce\u0027s notes into a drawer which he locked: not that they had any value without the physical evidence of the book. He went down the hall fast, a pace he kept up on the outside. His brain querned until he brought it under control. Damn it, Trig was right, there was no reason on God\u0027s earth ever to tense any muscle not actually working; and the same held true for the mind. An emotional stew would grind him down and get him to the Bishop no sooner. It was a hard discipline, though. Kintyre had no urge to embrace Zen Buddhism, or any other faith for that matter; but he would have given much to possess the self-mastery it taught. He entered the modest red-brick building a few blocks from Sather Gate and asked for Mr. Owens. The clerk checked the key rack and said: \"Oh, yes, he came in a few minutes ago.\" \"I\u0027ll go on up, I\u0027m expected,\" said Kintyre. It was probably not a lie. When he knocked on the writer\u0027s door, he heard himself invited in. Owens had one suitcase open on the bed and was folding a coat into it. Another stood strapped on the floor. He looked up (was his color a shade more rubicund?) and said, \"Hullo, there. I\u0027m glad you came by. I\u0027m leaving tonight.\" The voice was level. Perhaps too level. Kintyre closed the door and said: \"I thought you were going to come and see me in my office.\" \"Well, I was,\" said Owens. \"I wanted to get my packing out of the way first.\" He felt in the suitcase and brought out a pocket flask. \"Care for a drop?\" \"No,\" said Kintyre. He leaned in the doorway, watching. But he saw only that Owens stood neatly attired, calm of face, steady of hands, putting up a linen suit. \"What brings you here?\" asked the writer. Kintyre countered: \"Isn\u0027t this a rather sudden decision to leave?\" \"Mm, yes. I made the reservation just a few minutes ago. But I haven\u0027t much reason to stay here any longer, have I?\" \"The Lombardi murder.\" Owens shook his head. \"Poor chap. But what can I do about it? I assure you, the police didn\u0027t ask me to stay in town.\" He gave Kintyre a straight look, smiled, and went on: \"Why don\u0027t you sit down and talk to me, though? I\u0027m more or less stuck till Clayton arrives. He said he\u0027d meet me here.\" \"Clayton? Why—\" Kintyre moved slowly forward, to the armchair Owens waved at. He continued talking, inanely. \"I thought Clayton was in the City. He told me yesterday when we had lunch, he told me he\u0027d be going right over there and didn\u0027t expect to come back to this side in the near future.\" \"Oh? I called him at the Fairhill, just before you got here. He was right in his suite.\" Kintyre sat down. \"What did you want him for?\" \"To make him an offer for the Book of Witches.\" \"What!\" \"Take it easy,\" advised Owens. \"You don\u0027t own the thing.\" The effort not to pounce left Kintyre rigid. He managed finally to say: \"I suppose that was what you wanted to see me about, to offer me the same bribe Bruce wouldn\u0027t take.\" \"I see you\u0027ve gotten a somewhat biased version.\" Owens\u0027 reply had the blandness of conscious mastery. \"Yes, it was to be a similar offer. Not that I don\u0027t stand behind my contentions in the Borgia matter, but you people in this academic cloudland don\u0027t realize that the rest of us have a living to make. I have no time at present to dig into minutiae, and anyhow there are more important things in life. What I asked Lombardi was that he postpone the argument. Not perjure his precious self, only wait a while. There were enough other things to be written about, anent that book. He didn\u0027t have to raise the Borgia issue at all. Maybe in five or ten years—\" \"Since you brought up the Borgia issue, as you call it, in the first place,\" said Kintyre harshly, \"we in cloudland have no choice. If there\u0027s a notorious error afoot, we\u0027ve got to correct it. What the hell do you think we get paid for?\" \"Publicity,\" said Owens. \"Ornament. A ritual bow in the direction of yesterday.\" He took forth a silver case, opened it, fetched out a long cigarette and tapped it on his thumbnail. \"You claim to be a realist,\" he said. \"Then why don\u0027t you admit the facts? This business of scholarship, verification, the painful asymptotic approach to truth—it\u0027s dead. It went out with the society of aristocrats. This is a proletarian age.\" He lit the cigarette. His trained lecture-circuit voice rolled out, urbane, whimsical, with a bare touch of sadness. \"He who dances must pay the piper, but he who pays the piper may call the tune. Since the bills today are all being footed by slobs, what do you expect but the onward march of slobbery? One day you\u0027ll be fired in the name of government economy. I\u0027ll hang on a little longer, because I gauge the current level of oafishness and make each succeeding book conform; but sooner or later it will be too much trouble for the public even to read my swill. Then I\u0027ll settle down to live on my investments, and perhaps I can even go back to a little honest scholarship. But not now. First I must survive.\" Kintyre said slowly, caught up in spite of himself: \"Granted, this is the century of the common mind. But what makes you think it will last, even long enough for you to collect on those investments? This is also the so-called atomic age.\" Owens lifted his shoulders and let them fall again, gracefully. \"How do I know I won\u0027t be hit by a car tomorrow? One estimates the situation and acts on probabilities.\" Kintyre leaned forward. \"The probabilities are all for the worst,\" he said. \"Anyone who claims a roomful of people, all with grenades and all hating each other, will keep on acting rationally forever, is whistling past the graveyard of a dozen earlier civilizations. But I do believe scholarship—rigorous thinking—will be a survival factor. And afterward it will be one of the things which will make cultural rebuilding worth while. So I won\u0027t quit trying. It isn\u0027t for nothing.\" He stood up, not as tall as Owens, but broader and smoothly moving. \"Let me therefore have that manuscript back,\" he finished. His enemy kept a half smile; but as he neared, Kintyre saw how cheeks and forehead began to glisten. The pupils that stared at him widened until they were two wells of dark. \"What are you talking about?\" said Owens shrilly. \"You know bloody damn well what I mean. You took the Book of Witches. Give it back and we\u0027ll say no more. Otherwise—\" Kintyre was almost upon the writer. Owens backed away, holding up his cigarette like a futile sword. \"Look here,\" he protested. \"Look here, now.\" There came a rap on the door. Owens went limp with relief. \"Come in!\" he yelled. Kintyre realized bitterly how he had been snared. Owens had thrown out words which he knew the other must stop to answer. It had gained him a few seconds that might well make his victory; Kintyre took him for a physical coward who would not have stood up long even to verbal browbeating. Or did I actually intend to wring it from him with my hands? The thought was so shocking that Kintyre stepped back. Gerald Clayton entered, massive in gray, his narrow face wearing only a routine smile. It became more nearly genuine when he saw Kintyre. \"Why, hello, there,\" he said. \"What\u0027s going on?\" Owens threw his opponent a look. If you don\u0027t say anything about this, I won\u0027t. Kintyre held himself expressionless, waiting. \"Sit down, Mr. Clayton, do sit down.\" Owens gestured him to a chair. \"I appreciate your coming. I know your time is valuable.\" The importer seated himself and took out a cigar. Owens hovered around with his pocket flask; the drink was declined. Kintyre leaned against the wall, arms folded, and strove for calm. \"I wasn\u0027t very busy,\" said Clayton. \"Glad of a chance to get away, in fact.\" He nodded at Kintyre and explained: \"Something came up which forces me to stay in Berkeley at least till tomorrow. But it involves mostly waiting till I can see the person in question. So what did you want, Jabez?\" Owens shot another glance at Kintyre, gathered himself, and said: \"I wondered if you\u0027d be interested in selling the Liber Veneficarum?\" Clayton\u0027s mouth bent upward, creasing his lean cheeks. \"Whatever for?\" he asked, almost merrily. \"I\u0027m a collector.\" \"Well.\" Owens sat down on the bed, more at ease now. \"You\u0027re aware of my argument with Bruce Lombardi. I admit it\u0027s possible I was cheated on those letters—\" or commissioned the forgeries yourself, reflected Kintyre—\"and if not, at least the case against me deserves careful refutation. So I would like to have the manuscript, to study at my own leisure.\" \"And never get around to publishing your findings?\" asked Clayton. But he said it in a twitting, inoffensive tone. \"It might take me a few years,\" said Owens doggedly. \"I\u0027ve other work to do. However, I\u0027m prepared to make a fair offer for the book. Or, if you don\u0027t want to sell, I would like to borrow it for a year or two, under suitable guarantees against loss.\" Clayton rubbed his chin. \"Seems to me that Bob has some rights in this matter,\" he declared. Kintyre stepped a pace forward. His voice snapped out: \"The reason I came here is that the manuscript was stolen from me.\" \"What?\" Clayton shouted it, half rose, sat down again and puffed hard at his cigar. \"What happened?\" he said roughly. Kintyre related the morning. \"It fits pretty well,\" he concluded. \"First he plans an attempt to bribe me, as he tried to bribe Bruce. Did you know he offered Bruce five thousand dollars to withhold his findings? I mention on the phone I\u0027ll be going out to lunch. Since he doesn\u0027t really expect I\u0027ll bribe either, Owens hangs around. When he sees me leave, he ducks up into my office. If the book isn\u0027t there, he can always try the original scheme. But it\u0027s right on my desk, and I apologize for my own carelessness. Owens takes it back here. Then, to cover himself, he phones you with this offer to buy—as if he didn\u0027t know it was gone!\" Kintyre finished in a growl: \"That suitcase on the floor, already packed, would hold a quarto volume very easily.\" Clayton remained impassive. The writer said with strained calm: \"I ask you to witness this, sir. I\u0027m thinking of a suit for slander.\" \"That book is worth enough to make it theft grand larceny,\" said Clayton. \"And what alibi does the good Professor Kintyre have?\" flung Owens. \"Who but you has a motive for the book to disappear?\" said Kintyre. \"By God—\" Owens got off the bed and retreated again. Kintyre strode up to him and laid a hand about his wrist. He did not squeeze unduly hard, but Owens opened his mouth to scream, face going paper colored. Kintyre dropped the wrist as if it had turned incandescent. The reaction was unnatural enough, to his mind, to jar him physically. \"That\u0027ll do!\" rumbled Clayton. He stood up. His grizzled ruddy hair made Kintyre think of a lion\u0027s mane, a fighting cock\u0027s comb; this man had slugged his own way up from nothingness. \"That\u0027ll do,\" he repeated. \"If we can\u0027t settle it between ourselves like gentlemen, we\u0027d better call the police.\" Owens fumbled his way to the pocket flask, raised it and gulped. A little blood returned to his skin. \"I thought you were going to hit me,\" he said in a tiny voice. \"I never could—\" \"Owens,\" said Clayton, \"did you steal the book?\" His tone fell like iron. \"No.\" The writer put his flask down on the bureau. He remained standing above it, leaning on his hands, looking back over a hunched shoulder. \"No, of course not.\" \"Mind if we look around to make sure?\" \"I don\u0027t wish my baggage opened,\" said Owens. \"You haven\u0027t the right.\" Kintyre, with a measure of control restored to him, said: \"We could prefer charges and have the police look.\" \"Go ahead,\" said Owens more firmly. \"I\u0027ll sue you for every nickel you\u0027ve got. I\u0027d enjoy that.\" \"I don\u0027t like trouble,\" said Clayton. \"If you have the book, return it. We\u0027ll say you—borrowed it—nobody else ever has to hear a word.\" Owens whirled around. \"That\u0027s a reflection on my integrity!\" he shouted. \"If you really are innocent,\" said Clayton in a patient way, \"I should think you\u0027d want your integrity confirmed.\" Owens studied them for a moment. \"All right,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t blame you, Mr. Clayton. Your reaction is very understandable. But this character—Mr. Clayton, in case I decide to sue him, and I probably will, remember exactly what happened today. Now go ahead and search.\" The importer squatted by the suitcase. It didn\u0027t take him long to go through the neatly packed clothing. There was no book. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3083/85096.html","bookId":961,"book":{"id":961,"title":"Murder in Black Letter","description":"简介： Steel talked between roses.
