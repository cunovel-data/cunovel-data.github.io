{"id":17037,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"Yamamura and Guido had come out first. Guido\u0027s legs seemed to go fluid; only the arm around his waist held him up. \"Jimmy,\" he bleated. Kintyre\u0027s hand swung backward in an arc, shoving Corinna behind him. He said aloud—very loudly, \"What the devil do you want?\" \"Quiet, there,\" said the man called Jimmy. \"This thing has a silencer on it.\" He waved the gun. \"I want to see Lombardi.\" \"It isn\u0027t nothing, Jimmy,\" chattered Guido. \"Before God, Jimmy, they\u0027re just friends of mine!\" \"Yeh. You can tell us all about it. The rest of you stand back against the door. Come on, Guido. I got a car waiting.\" Yamamura eased his burden to the ground. Guido huddled on hands and knees, retching. \"He\u0027ll never make it,\" said the detective. \"He\u0027s scared spitless.\" \"I just want to talk with him,\" said Jimmy. \"I was supposed to see him here tonight, only they said he\u0027d gone upstairs. I figured if it was just for a nap or something, he\u0027d be down again to finish his act and I\u0027d catch him later. Only if he wanted to skip out this way instead, it would be soon and he might not come back. I didn\u0027t want to miss him, so I figured I\u0027d wait here a while.\" It was not meant as an explanation. It was an indictment, nailed word by word on the man who tried to stand up. \"Well,\" said Yamamura, \"let me help him.\" Jimmy laughed under his hat. \"I\u0027m not that simple-minded. Stay put.\" With shrillness: \"Come on, Guido. Or do you want to get drilled right here and now?\" Guido began to drag himself forward, as if a bullet had already smashed his spine. The sound of it, and of his breath going in and out an open mouth, and the nearby clamor of automobiles filled with meek taxpayers, was all that Kintyre could hear. He wondered if he could let Guido be taken from him, by the same instrument which had taken Bruce, and call himself male. Two or three jumps should reach Jimmy. But Jimmy was no amateur, he wouldn\u0027t miss if he shot. But there were many cases on record of men being hit once, twice, being filled with lead, and still coming on. But Guido wasn\u0027t worth anybody\u0027s time. But Guido was brother to Bruce and Corinna, therefore worth a great deal of time. But a possible forty years? But a deeper shadow filled the open end of the brick gut. It ran forward in total silence, light touched its glassy uplifted club and its flowing hair. As the bottle came down on Jimmy\u0027s head, Kintyre started to move. Yamamura beat him to it, arriving a second after Jimmy lurched forward from the impact on his skull. The sound had been a shattering; Kintyre heard the tinkles that followed the blow. Yamamura knocked the gun from Jimmy\u0027s hand with an edge-on palm, seized his lapel, and applied a scissor strangle. Jimmy fell, as if the bones had been sucked from him. Corinna swayed over his form, still holding the broken beer bottle. Almost, she fell too. Kintyre caught her. She held him closely, shuddering. It was not necessary, he thought beneath his own pulse. She fought herself, and grew worn down thereby. Her physical output had been negligible. Clearly she had slipped back through the door, unobserved (that was the chance she took, but chance had a way of favoring those who acted boldly). Picking up an empty bottle on the way, tucking it inconspicuously under an arm, she had gone out past the bar, out the main door (doubtless noticed, maybe wondered about, but not stopped and soon forgotten) and around the building. Then she took off her shoes and ran up behind Jimmy and hit him. That was all. There was no reason to grow exhausted. But God damn all smug judokas, hadn\u0027t she earned the right? \"You clopped him a good one,\" said Yamamura, squatting to look. \"It\u0027s as well he had a hat on. A cut scalp could get very messy. Congratulations.\" \"Did you say there was a cop in the bar?\" asked Kintyre. \"Beyond doubt,\" said Yamamura. \"Or we can phone, of course. Only I\u0027m carrying a parcel of smoke, and the neighborhood will be searched quite thoroughly if our friend here mentions it.\" He sat on his heels, chin in hand, for what seemed like a long time. Jimmy moaned, but did not stir. \"Bob,\" asked Yamamura finally, \"do you know anyone living on this side who\u0027s mixed up in the affair?\" \"Just Guido, if we rule out the Michaelises.\" \"So the big chief—and his next victim—are probably in the Eastbay. If another murder is to be forestalled, I wonder if we ought to spend time here chatting with a lot of well intentioned policemen who will first have to be convinced the Michaelises are innocent and this wasn\u0027t a simple stick-up. Especially when the papers will tell the big chief exactly what\u0027s happened. Or, even if they can be made to keep quiet, Jimmy will fail to report in; the gang will try to check for him in the San Francisco pokey, first of all; so we could do some trail-covering of our own.\" \"You mean to take this character to Berkeley, then? Isn\u0027t that pretty irregular? You don\u0027t want to jeopardize your license.\" \"It\u0027s as irregular as a German verb, and the police are going to be annoyed. But I do think we can flange up enough excuses to get by with it. Of course, the Berkeley force will call up the San Francisco force immediately, but that\u0027ll go on a higher level, chief to chief I imagine; we can explain the need for secrecy, as much secrecy as the law allows, and—Hell, Bob, let\u0027s stop mincing words. What we need is time to construct a story that\u0027ll cover Guido. And you.\" Kintyre felt how the stone-rigid body he held began to come alive again. \"Blessings,\" he murmured. \"We\u0027ll go to your place first, and then decide what\u0027s next.\" \"Can you finagle Jimmy across the bridge?\" \"Him and Guido both,\" grinned Yamamura. \"Which will leave you a clear field when you take the lady home.\" \"I\u0027m coming,\" said Corinna. She pulled herself away from Kintyre, gently. \"You are not,\" he answered. Seeing in the dirty gray half-light how her face grew mutinous, he went on: \"There are enough complications already. What could you do over there, except be one more element we have to explain away—or one more target for the gang? At present, only Jimmy knows you have any concern with this business, and he\u0027ll get no chance to talk of it.\" She thought on his words for a little. Then: \"Yes. You\u0027re right. But don\u0027t drive me all the way. A taxi will—\" \"Shut up!\" he laughed, shakily, and took her arm. They had to wait, guarding a half-conscious prisoner, while Yamamura went after his car. Guido sat on the pavement, knees drawn up under his chin. After a while he took out a cigarette and lit it. Corinna leaned over him. \"Go with them,\" she said. \"They\u0027re the only real friends you\u0027ve got.\" \"Besides you, sis,\" he muttered. Then, barking a sort of laugh: \"Next week, East Lynne.\" She sighed, like an old woman, and stood back again. Yamamura returned and bound Jimmy\u0027s wrists with Jimmy\u0027s tie. He and Kintyre frogmarched their captive to the Volkswagen and put him in back on the floor. Yamamura secured his ankles with his belt. \"Toss me your house key, Bob, I\u0027ll see you there. Hop in, Guido. Cheerio.\" Kintyre and Corinna walked hand in hand back toward his own car. They stopped to pick up her shoes. \"I\u0027m afraid you ruined your stockings,\" he said inanely. \"You don\u0027t have to talk,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t need it.\" He was grateful for that. The silence in which they drove home (she did not lean against him, but she sat close by) was somehow like—memory groped—like Bruce\u0027s music which Margery had played for him a few centuries ago. He wondered if she had heard it yet. \"I hope you\u0027ll be able to sleep,\" he said at her door. \"Oh, yes, I think so.\" She considered him and asked gravely: \"Why are you doing this for us?\" \"I can\u0027t stop now,\" he said. \"I\u0027m in up to the eyebrows.\" \"But why did you begin? Not for Bruce\u0027s sake, surely. He wouldn\u0027t have cared about being avenged.\" \"Which is what the police are for, anyway. I don\u0027t like this evading them that we\u0027ve been forced into.\" \"Well?\" she continued. \"Why do you want to know?\" he dodged. Her head drooped. \"I suppose it isn\u0027t any of my business. I\u0027m sorry.\" It hammered within him to tell her: that he had been escaping a demon, that she had worn its shape for a single moment, and that now he wanted to give peace to her. But there had been too many locks in him, for too many years. He took her hand. \"Later,\" he said, wondering if he meant it. \"This is no time for a long, involved story.\" \"I\u0027ll stay home tomorrow,\" she said. \"Will you call me as soon as—anything happens? The first minute you\u0027re able to?\" \"Of course.\" She smiled then, reached up and ran her palm along his cheek. \"Arrivederci,\" she said. The door closed behind her. It was so much more than he had awaited, that he never remembered going down the stairs. He was driving over the bridge before the complete bleakness of his purpose returned. The hour was not yet midnight, but Berkeley was quiet. Kintyre parked behind Yamamura\u0027s Volks and walked around the empty house to his cottage. The detective let him in. \"Where are our friends?\" asked Kintyre. \"Guido is in your bed, snoring,\" said Yamamura. \"As clear a case of nervous exhaustion as I ever saw. By the way, Jimmy\u0027s name is O\u0027Hearn; I went through his billfold. I borrowed some of that rope you\u0027ve been making grommets with and stashed him in the john.\" He had stripped off his jacket, to show a noisy aloha shirt; his pipe strove to be Vesuvius. \"Are you very tired?\" he asked. \"No. Keyed up, in fact.\" \"Have a drink. Apropos vices, the evidence against Guido is in the Bay. I assumed we\u0027re not going to hand him over to the law.\" \"Not for one bit of foolishness,\" said Kintyre. \"I doubt if he\u0027ll ever touch dope running again. He\u0027s gotten a hefty scare.\" \"Jimmy will tattle, though.\" \"Our word against his. We\u0027re somewhat more respectable.\" \"You and Machiavelli! But, yeh. A check with the Chicago police—he\u0027s from there, all right—would doubtless show he\u0027s got a record as long as King Kong\u0027s arm. A pro killer doesn\u0027t come out of nowhere; he starts with petty stuff and works his way up.\" Yamamura shook his head. \"And on the other hand, a lot of good men are doing time for one slip regretted the moment it was over. Makes me wonder about our whole concept of penology. That\u0027s why I\u0027ll help you cover for Guido.\" Kintyre took down his bottle of Scotch and raised brows at Yamamura. The detective shook his head. Kintyre poured for himself and sat down. The other man prowled. \"We haven\u0027t much time,\" said Yamamura. \"What do we tell the cops?\" \"Perhaps nothing—yet,\" said Kintyre slowly. \"Huh? How do you mean?\" \"They don\u0027t use the third degree around here. O\u0027Hearn isn\u0027t going to tell them a thing, and you know it. They\u0027ll have to check with Chicago, the FBI, follow a dozen separate leads for days at least. And what do his pals do meanwhile?\" Yamamura stopped in midstride. \"If you have any half-cooked scheme of beating the truth out of him, forget it,\" he said in a chill voice. \"Oh, no,\" said Kintyre. \"But do you think we could get away with holding him, unharmed, for maybe twenty-four hours?\" \"It would be kidnaping.\" \"What was he trying to do to Guido?\" Yamamura stared at the sabers on the wall. \"What do you want to do?\" \"Get his information out of him in less time than the police will need.\" \"I think an excuse could be manufactured,\" said Yamamura dreamily. \"If not for a whole twenty-four hours, for twelve or so. This reminds me of my days in OSS. Okay, I\u0027ll risk it.\" \"Good,\" said Kintyre. \"Then follow my lead.\" \"Better explain—\" Kintyre was already in the bathroom, looking down at the man on the floor. O\u0027Hearn had a long nose and not much chin. \"Who hired you, Jimmy?\" said Kintyre. Hatred glared back at him. \"Tough, aren\u0027t you?\" said O\u0027Hearn. \"Big deal.\" \"I asked who hired you,\" said Kintyre. He saw the growth of fear. \"Look, I don\u0027t know,\" said O\u0027Hearn. \"And if I spilled anything, anything at all, they\u0027d find out.\" \"And kill you. I\u0027ve heard that line before.\" Kintyre shrugged. \"You are going to tell me. Think about it while I make ready.\" He took Yamamura out into the yard, toward the house. \"My landlord left some extra keys with me, just in case,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll borrow a soundproof room.\" \"Hey!\" Yamamura stopped. \"I told you, bodily harm is out.\" \"I\u0027ve no such intention.\" Kintyre led him into the house and down to its basement. \"We\u0027ll use the rumpus room. It has a pool table we can tie him to. The process seems to work best when the victim lies supine. I admit he might get a little stiff from the hard surface.\" Yamamura grabbed his shoulder. \"What the blue hell are you talking about?\" he growled. \"They\u0027re just now beginning to study the mental effects of eliminating sensory stimuli,\" said Kintyre. \"The mind goes out of whack amazingly fast. My friend Levinson, in the physiology department, was telling me about some recent experiments. Volunteers, intelligent self-controlled people who knew what it\u0027s all about and knew they could quit any time they wanted—none of which applies to O\u0027Hearn—didn\u0027t last long. Hallucinations set in. Of course, we may have to mop up certain messes afterward.\" \"Do I understand you rightly?\" \"I suppose so. The only thing we\u0027re going to do to O\u0027Hearn is tie him down, flat on his back, blindfolded.\" They would have to stand watch and watch outside the door. Kintyre took the first one, though he didn\u0027t expect a reaction soon. (On the other hand, an hour can stretch most hideously when you are alone in soundless dark, not even able to move.) He pulled up a chair and opened a book, but didn\u0027t read it. Nor did he listen to the defiant obscenities which came very faintly through the panels. Mostly he sat in a wordless half sleep. Corinna, he thought. And then, later: I\u0027m being infantile. It doesn\u0027t mean a thing, except that I\u0027ve been celibate too long and by sheer chance she pushes a few buttons in me. It could not last—consider the difference in faith alone—and she would be hurt. How do I know it wouldn\u0027t, even to the altar? (For surely it would last always, having taken us that far.) I don\u0027t know. I suppose I\u0027m being cowardly in not finding out. Then again, long afterward: This couldn\u0027t be hurried in any event. We\u0027d both go slowly, her loss is still so new. There\u0027d be ample time for me to escape, before the pleasure of her presence became a necessity. And once more: But why should I want to escape at all? The first thin gray was stealing over the hills when Yamamura yawned his way in. O\u0027Hearn hadn\u0027t cried out for some time; he lay breathing hard. \"Solved the case yet?\" asked Yamamura. \"No? Well, run along and let a professional handle it.\" Kintyre went across the yard. A bird twittered somewhere, drowsily. He entered the cottage and looked at Guido. Still out. The face was gone innocent with sleep, years had been lost, a della Robbia angel lay in his bed. He sighed, kicked off his shoes, and stretched on the living room couch. Darkness was quickly upon him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3083/85102.html","bookId":961,"book":{"id":961,"title":"Murder in Black Letter","description":"简介： Steel talked between roses.
