{"id":17032,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"\"Somewhere else,\" mumbled Kintyre. \"Under the bed.\" \"Stand aside,\" said Clayton. He went to work, peering, poking, moving about the room and its bath like a professional. He found places to check which Kintyre would not have thought of in a week\u0027s hunt; and yet the broad ropy-veined hands, which had once wielded a shovel, made little disarrangement. Owens sat down, poured himself another drink, and sipped as if it were victory he tasted. Kintyre stood by the window sill, wrestling himself toward calm. He had not yet fully achieved it when Clayton said: \"Not in here.\" \"Well,\" murmured Owens. Clayton puffed blue smoke, sat down on the bed, and gave them both a quizzical glance. \"I suppose an apology is in order,\" he said. Owens waved his cigarette. \"Look,\" he replied, giving it the complete treatment, \"I\u0027ve cooled off a bit myself. I can see how you were overwrought, Professor, from the death of your friend—and, to be sure, the loss of a valuable relic entrusted to you.\" Kintyre held his mouth stiff. \"If you\u0027ll take this as a lesson, I for my part am willing to forget it.\" \"You might thank the man, Bob,\" added Clayton lightly. Kintyre grunted. What could you say? \"It\u0027s worth while reviewing the facts, though,\" went on Clayton. \"Maybe between us we can figure who did swipe it.\" \"No students around,\" said Owens. \"True. But anybody could have lounged outside till Bob left and then walked up into his office, without much risk of being seen. Right?\" Kintyre nodded. His neck ached with tension. \"Okay.\" Clayton blew a smoke ring. \"I guess we can rule out an ordinary thief. He wouldn\u0027t pick a college building. How about other people with offices there?\" Kintyre stirred. \"Now, wait,\" he began. Clayton waved him back. \"Take it easy, Bob. Just for the record, is anybody but you working in that place between sessions?\" \"Well, some,\" he forced himself to say. \"It\u0027s a sizable department. And then the clerical staff, and janitors. But for God\u0027s sake!\" \"Their own office doors wouldn\u0027t be locked, though?\" \"Hm? No, I suppose not. At least, a number wouldn\u0027t be. Even if they weren\u0027t in today, there\u0027d be nothing to steal.\" \"Except manuscripts.\" Owens had been seated, listening with a tolerant smile. Now he said in a cool voice, \"Not to follow the recent bad example of accusations, but what is your alibi, Kintyre?\" \"No motive!\" \"Oh? I daresay there are other wealthy collectors besides Mr. Clayton. With your contacts, you could have learned who they are. Mind you, I don\u0027t charge you with anything, but—\" \"Cut it out,\" interrupted Clayton. It was so cold a phrase that they both turned startled faces to him. He got up. \"This farce has gone on long enough,\" he said. \"Jabez, give me my book.\" \"What?\" Owens leaned away. Clayton walked toward him. Owens lifted a fending arm. \"I don\u0027t feel like hunting through a lot of rooms for it,\" said Clayton. \"Which did you leave it in?\" \"But—but—but—\" \"Do I have to spell it out? It\u0027s plain to see, either you or Bob took the thing. Who the hell else is there? I credit Bob with brains enough to steal it more neatly. Like setting an \u0027accidental\u0027 fire he could tell me burned it. You had to work fast, though. Play by ear. You grabbed it exactly as Bob thought. Only you realized he\u0027d come back in a few minutes and go howling on your trail. What better way to throw him off it than to let him make a fool of himself before me—me, the owner, who\u0027s really got a right to blow his stack?\" Clayton stood over Owens with the big fists on his hips, beating him about the head with words. \"You left it in one of those empty offices, or maybe in the can. They won\u0027t lock the main entrance till five o\u0027clock or so, I guess. You could have picked the thing up again at your convenience, when Bob had gone off with his tail between his legs. It was fun while it lasted, Jabez, but now suppose you tell me where that book is.\" \"I didn\u0027t!\" screamed Owens. \"I don\u0027t want to press charges,\" said Clayton. \"Tell me, and we\u0027ll call it quits. Otherwise we can all wait right here for the police.\" Owens began to shake. Kintyre looked away, feeling a little sick himself. \"All right,\" said Clayton and picked up the phone. \"No,\" whimpered Owens. \"Don\u0027t.\" \"Well?\" Clayton paused, one finger in a dial hole. Owens got out a room number. \"Under the desk,\" he added, and lowered his face into his hands. \"Can we check that from here?\" asked Clayton. Kintyre nodded, took the phone and called the department. He asked one of the girls to look, feeding her a story about having lent the volume out. Then he held the line and waited. \"Well,\" said Clayton. He drew on his cigar, relaxed visibly, and laughed. \"Maybe I ought to set up as a private eye. Know any hard-boiled blondes?\" \"Nice work,\" said Kintyre inadequately. \"Good Lord, if that book really had been lost!\" \"It wouldn\u0027t have been your fault,\" said Clayton. \"Forget it.\" Kintyre looked down at a shuddering back. \"It seems to be my turn now, Owens,\" he said. \"No hard feelings. Va\u0027 tu con Dio.\" \"No,\" said Clayton. \"I\u0027m afraid not.\" Kintyre stared up again, into the narrow face and the deeply ridged eyes. \"I thought,\" he said, \"I thought you wouldn\u0027t—\" \"Prefer charges? Not about a lousy manuscript. My time\u0027s worth too much. But Bruce Lombardi was murdered, remember?\" Owens lifted a seared countenance and gasped: \"No, you can spare me that much, can\u0027t you?\" \"I hope so,\" said Clayton impersonally. \"But the fact remains, Bruce was a threat to a fat piece of Hollywood cash.\" \"He was going to expose the Borgia fraud publicly, as well as in specialized journals,\" said Kintyre, not wanting to. \"That made it even more urgent,\" said Clayton. \"If Bruce should die and the book disappear, I don\u0027t know who\u0027d stand to benefit more than you.\" Owens emitted a little moaning noise and shriveled back into the mask of his hands. \"You see?\" said Clayton. \"Wait,\" protested Kintyre. \"I can\u0027t really believe he—\" \"I\u0027m open to proof,\" said Clayton. Kintyre fell silent. After a while the girl\u0027s voice said in the phone: \"I found it, Dr. Kintyre. Right where you told me.\" \"Thanks a lot,\" he answered automatically. \"Would you put it in the safe?\" He nodded and hung up. \"Good,\" said Clayton. He spoke slowly and carefully to Owens\u0027 bent head: \"We\u0027ll leave now. You stay around Berkeley for a while. I\u0027m going to have to call your motive to the attention of the police, so if you left there\u0027d probably be a warrant for you by tonight. But I won\u0027t say anything about your peccadillo this afternoon. And if you\u0027re innocent, I recommend that you start scrounging around for witnesses to where you were all weekend.\" \"Whoof!\" said Kintyre when he was in the lobby. \"I wouldn\u0027t like to go through that again.\" \"Nor I,\" said Clayton. \"Let\u0027s have something wet.\" They went into the coffee shop and ordered. Kintyre said: \"Owens didn\u0027t do the murder. I doubt if he\u0027s capable of killing his own flies.\" \"Himself,\" said Clayton shortly. \"He could have hired a torpedo. He\u0027s got money enough. Not that killers come fabulously expensive.\" Almost, Kintyre told him of last night. He stopped with the words at his teeth. After this hour\u0027s performance, it seemed too probable that Clayton would insist on telling the San Francisco authorities about Larkin, on the instant, and the consequences to Guido (and thereby to Guido\u0027s parents and Corinna) go hang. As far as that goes, I suppose I\u0027ve made myself an accessory after the fact or something. They remained in a companionable silence until the coffee had arrived. It was refreshing to know an unfrantic businessman; but then, Clayton had acquired a lot of European traits. The importer asked suddenly: \"Have you seen Miss Towne?\" \"Not today,\" said Kintyre, surprised. \"Were you planning to?\" \"Why—yes. I thought I\u0027d drop around this afternoon. She told me she didn\u0027t feel up to working for the rest of this week.\" \"It might be better if she did,\" said Clayton. \"She\u0027ll sit at home and grieve, or go out and laugh more than she means. Drinking too much in either case.\" \"You seem to know her pretty well,\" said Kintyre. He felt a bit annoyed, he didn\u0027t know why. \"I met her a few times is all. But she\u0027s pretty transparent, under all that careful sophistication, isn\u0027t she?\" Clayton stirred his coffee, focusing on the spoon as if it were some precision instrument. \"A good kid.\" \"She\u0027s all right,\" said Kintyre. \"I suppose you feel an obligation toward her?\" Kintyre bridled. \"I didn\u0027t mean to keyhole,\" said Clayton hurriedly. \"I just couldn\u0027t help wondering what\u0027ll become of her. Somebody has to help her over the hump. She\u0027ll never make it alone.\" Against his own principles of respect for privacy, Kintyre found himself speculating. Where had Clayton picked up such intuitions? His first wife, whom he had loved, seemed by his few chance remarks and his Who\u0027s Who biography to have been the conventional helpmeet of a conventional young man in the thirties: grocery clerk, salesman, pitchforked down by the Depression, up again via WPA to construction foreman to warehouse foreman to minor executive. Finally she got tuberculosis, with complications, and took a couple of years to die. The medical bills ruined him; he parked the three children with relatives for years. Afterward, on the way up once more in the defense boom and the early war boom, he married the boss\u0027s daughter. He got to be general superintendent of an aircraft plant before he learned what a bitch she was. The divorce cost him that job and his savings. He applied for an Army commission and got one in 1943. Kintyre knew little else; his information was only the gossip one is bound to encounter. Clayton had been a fairly large figure in Italy when Kintyre went over for the second time. \"Eh?\" he said, pulled back to awareness. \"I asked if you wanted to take her out tonight,\" repeated Clayton. \"Uh—\" \"Somebody ought to.\" As if he had heard Kintyre\u0027s thoughts, Clayton said with an enormous gentleness: \"She reminds me a lot of my daughter.\" Clayton had never had any great chance to be a father, reflected Kintyre. After the war, his kids ended up in exclusive boarding schools while Dad was overseas reaping the money to keep them there. Now they were grown. The girl had been graduated last year and was still making her Grand Tour. Clayton sometimes bragged about her, in clumsy generalities: he scarcely knew her as a person. The second son was also worth a cautious boast or two, apparently a solid-citizen type, an engineer; he and his father doubtless exchanged very dutiful letters. The older boy, you didn\u0027t hear much about. You got an impression of a sinecure in the firm\u0027s New York office and divorce number three currently going through the mill. Kintyre wondered, suddenly, if he had ever known anyone more alone than Clayton. It came to him that an answer was expected. \"No,\" he said, \"I have another engagement this evening.\" \"Not one you could break? She does need help.\" \"So does Miss Lombardi. Bruce\u0027s sister. I have some news for her that could make a big difference.\" Clayton paused a moment. Then he grinned. \"Well, in that case,\" he said, \"d\u0027you mind if I squire Miss Towne?\" Kintyre looked up, startled. He had been slipping into a mood of utter oleaginous sentimentalism. Pity Clayton? The hell! You wouldn\u0027t think the man was past forty. He sat there with more life in his eyes than two buccaneer captains. \"Good heavens, no,\" exclaimed Kintyre. \"Why ever should I?\" Margery could do a lot worse, he thought. He knew his eagerness was chiefly to get rid of whatever responsibility he bore for her. Nevertheless—A lot worse! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3083/85097.html","bookId":961,"book":{"id":961,"title":"Murder in Black Letter","description":"简介： Steel talked between roses.
