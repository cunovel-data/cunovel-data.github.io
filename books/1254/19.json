By sunset Wellington would have been in full flight. Napoleon had routed Blucher three days earlier. He\u0027d have done it again with ease.\" The car went over the crest of a hill. Ahead, beyond green empty pastureland, lay the blue Channel, shining in the sun, and a hairline of French coast all ajong the horizon. They got out and stood amid high grass and red poppies blowing in a cool sea breeze. After an impressive silence, broken only by birdsong, Tillet said, Well, there we are. You\u0027re looking at Hitler\u0027s France.\" Turn by Turn they scanned the coast through a telescope Tillet brought out of the car\u0027s trunk. Small images of houses and ships shimmered on the far shore. \"That\u0027s as close as Jerry\u0027s ever come,\" Tillet said. \"Close enough, too.\" \"The Germans took all the neutral attaches on a tour of France not long ago,\" Pug said. \"Brought us clear to the coast. The Poppies are growing over there, too. We saw your chalk cliffs, and the Maginot Line guns they were pointing at you. Now I\u0027m looking down the wrong end of those guns.\" Tillet said, \"They\u0027re no problem. They lob a few shells over for terror, but they fall in the fields. Nobody\u0027s terrorized.\" Running westward along the coast, they passed through siicnt boarded-up villages, thickly tangled with barbed wire. Camouflaged pillboxes stood thick along the hills and in the towns. Pug saw a children\u0027s merry-go-round with the snouts of cannon peeking from under the platform of painted horses. Along the Hat stony beaches, jagged iron rods spiked up, festooned with wire. As waves rose and fell, queerly shaped tangles of pipe poked above the water. Pug said, \"Well, you\u0027re not exactly unprepared.\" \"Yes. Adolf was decent enough to give us a breather, and we\u0027ve used it. Those pipes out beyond the waterline are just the old Greek fire idea. We set the sea ablaze with petroleum, and fry the Germans we don\u0027t drown.\" Barrage balloons came in sight over the hills to the west. \u0027Ah. Here we are.\" Tillet pulled up under a spreading old tree. \u0027Tortsmouth has two possible restaurants, but the city\u0027s taken a pasting. They may be short of crockery. I have some sandwiches and coffee in the boot.\"\u0027Perfect.\" Pug trotted up and down the road, restoring circulation to his numb heavy legs, then sat beside Tillet under the tree. They ate the lunch wordlessly. Tillet appeared to have no small talk whatever. Pug did not mind, being more or less like that himself. \"Look there,\" Tillet said, gesturing with the last of his sandwich. In the blue sky a patch of orange was flowering over the city, a barrage balloon on fire. \"they\u0027re back today, after all. More coffee?\" \"No thanks.\" \"Now, what\u0027s the damned fool doing hitting poor Portsmouth again? Yesterday he was going inland, where he should be.\" Tillet deftly packed the lunch things and got his binoculars. The air vibrated with the distant thump of A.A. firing and the hum of planes. \"Shall we get along down there? I imagine it\u0027s a feint. It doesn\u0027t look like much of a show.\" \"Right.\" Climbing in the car, Pug paused, and scanned the sky high to the east. \"Look there, General.\" Tillet squinted skyward, saw nothing, and used his binoculars. His eyes widened. \"Yes. That\u0027s more like it.\" He passed the binoculars to Victor Henry. The binoculars resolved the gray moving dot into swarms of airplanes moving north in tight V\u0027s across the cloudless blue. \"Heinkels, a lot of log\u0027s, and some no\u0027s,\" Pug said. \"More than a hundred of them.\" \"No Stukas? They\u0027re sitting birds. Our pilots say it\u0027s hardly sporting to go after them.\" \"I don\u0027t see any crooked wings up there. But they\u0027re pretty far off.\" \"Care to join our observer corps, Captain Henry?\" Tillet\u0027s Voice to him was slightly more cordial. More barrage balloons over Portsmouth burst into flame and went writhing lazily down in black smoke. Fires were burning on the docks; white smoke trails crisscrossed the blue sky. The car passed a black plane nose down, burning in a grassy field, its markings hidden by flames, By the time they reached Portsmouth, fire fighters were streaming water on the blazes, and people were out in the streets gawking. Though buildings were smashed and burning and rubble heaps blocked many streets, the town did not look anything like Rotterdam, or even some of the badly hit French towns. \"Care to inspect the damage? You\u0027re welcome to, but it\u0027s a dreary sight. I\u0027m thinking we might go straight on to the Chain Home station. Since Jerry does seem to be coming over today, you might find it interesting.\"\"Sure thing.\" They had the ferry to themselves. The old wooden boat rolled nauseatingly on the little stretch of open water to the Isle of Wight. \"People forget how choppy this Channel is,\" Said Tillet, clinging to a stanchion and raising his voice above the mind and the engine thump. \"If the Germans do cross, they may arrive too seasick to fight. It\u0027s a factor.\" An olive-painted military car awaited them at the landing they drove across the bucolic island, passing one mansion after another shuttered and dead amid rolling wide lawns and shrubbery sprouting and flowering rankly. they saw no other car on their way to a cluster of iron and wooden huts around steel towers thrusting toward the sky, a grim blotch on the green holiday island. A tubby man with a scarlet face, the group captain in charge of the station, offered them tea in his little office, chatting about the raid On Portsmouth. He also mentioned with some pride a large sea bass which he had hauled from the surf at dawn. \"Well, shall we have a look at how things are going? There\u0027s rather a large attack been laid on today, I believe.\" Victor Henry\u0027s first glimpse of British radar scopes at Ventnor, in a small stuffy room lit by one red light and foul with smoke, was a deep hock. He listened intently to the talk of the pale, slender man in gray tweed caned Dr, Cantwell, a civilian scientist, as they inspected the scopes\u0027. But the sharp green pips were news enough. The British were miles ahead of the United States. They had mastered techniques that American ex. Plerts had told him were twenty years off. The R.A.F could measure the range and bearing of a ship down to a hundred yards or less, and read the result off a scope at sight. They could do the same to a single incoming airplane, or count horde of airplanes, and give the altitude too. These instruments were marvels compare(a) d to the stuff that he had seen tested on the New York last year and that the Navy had ordered in large quantities. Pug Henry had two immediate thoughts: that the United States Navy had to get hold of this equipment; and that the British were far better prepared for war than the world knew. He admired the quiet sense of drama with which General Tillet had bowled him over. That was well done. But it all hung on the fact that they had these remarkable radars. Here was a moment of confrontation between America and England masked in a casual visit, in an offhand atmosphere, in a smoky, dim little room smelling of electric machinery, on a playground island deserted by the rich, facing the displaced Maginot Line guns. \u0027We have nothing like this,\" he said. \\n\\n Then?\" said Dr. CantweB, lighting a cigarette. \"Are you sure? They\u0027re pretty far along at MIT, we understand, with this sort of thing.\" \u0027I know what we\u0027ve got.\" Pug saw on General Tillet\u0027s face, in the red fight, the shadowy gleam that comes of drawing a good hand of cards: a deepening of lines, a brightening of eyes, nothing more. \"How the devil do you obtain such a sharp beam? I pressed our boys on this. The answer was that it was a question of stepping down to shorter and shorter wavelengths. Beyond a certain point you can\u0027t do that, they say, and still get the power to shoot out the pulses to any distance.\" The scientist nodded, his eyes almost shut, his face as blank as possible. But he too, Pug thought, was a happy man. Then, yes, that\u0027s the problem, isn\u0027t it?\" he mumbled. \"But they\u0027ll certainly get around to the answer. It\u0027s a question of tube design, circuitry, and so forth. Our cavity magnetron does a pretty good job, at that. We\u0027re not entirely displeased with it.\" \"Cavity magnetron?\" \"Yes. Cavity magnetron. One gets rid of the grid in a vacuum tube, you see, and one controls current flow with an external magnetic field. That allows for the more powerful pulses. It takes a bit of designing, but your people will certainly work it up in due course.\" \"No doubt. Got any cavity magnetrons for sale?\" Both Tillet and Dr. Cantwell burst out laughing, and even the enlisted men at their scopes turned around and smiled. The scarlet-faced group captain peered at a scope where a boyish operator was chattering into a headphone. \"Hullo, looks like we have another circus heading this way. Fanning up over Le Havre again. A couple of dozen would you say, Stebbins?\" \"Thirty-seven, sir.\" Excitement thickened in the dark room as reports came in from several scopes. A young duty officer wearing headphones strolled from scope to scope, making ngtes on a clipboard, talking to the operators. To PLig Henry\u0027s eye this was smooth expert work, like the controlled tumult in a submarine conning tower during an attack run. General Tillet said, \"I take it you think rather well of our cavity magnetron.\" \"It\u0027s a ma or breakthrough, general.\" \"Hell. Yeas. Strange, isn\u0027t it, that warfare has come down to fencing with complicated toys that only a few seedy scholars can make or understand.\"\"Pretty useful toys,\" said Pug, watching the duty officer write down the ranges and bearings that the radar operators were barking. \"Exact intelligence of the enemy\u0027s location and movements, without disclosing your own.\" \"Well, of course. We\u0027re damned grateful for our boffins. A few Englishmen did stay awake while our PO]iticians kicked away air parity and all the rest of our military posture. Well, now that you\u0027ve had a look, would you just as soon pop back to Londonr I thought we might have to stay here a day or two to see action, but Jerry\u0027s been obliging. We can break our trip overnight at some decent hotel, then whip up to London. A couple of people there would like a word with you.\" Outside 10 Downing Street a single helmeted bobby paced in the morning sun, watched by a few sightseers on the opposite sidewalk. Remembering the grim arrays of SS men in front of Hitler\u0027s marble chancellery, Victor Henry smiled at this one unarmed Englishman guarding the Prime Minister\u0027s old row house. Tillet brought him in, introduced him to a male secretary in a morning coat, and left. The secretary led him up a wide stairway lined with portraits-Pug recognized Disraeli, Gladstone, and Rariisay MacDonald-and left him waiting in a broad room full of beautiful old furniture and splendid paintings. Perched on a petit-point sofa, all alone, Pug had plenty of time to grow nervous before the secretary returned to fetch him. In a small hot cluttered room that smelled of old books and dead cigars, the corpulent old Prime Minister stood near the window, one hand on his hip, looking down at a spread of photographs on his desk. He was very short and very stooped, with graceful little hands and feet; he bulged in the middle, and tapered upward and downward like Tweedledum. As he turned and went to meet Victor Henry, his walk was slow and heavy. With a word of welcome he shook hands and motioned Pug to a seat. The secretary left. Churchill sat in his armchair, put a hand on one arm, leaned back, and contemplated the American naval captain with filmy eyes. The big ruddy face, flecked and spotted with age, looked severe an d suspicious. He puffed at the stump of his cigar, and slowly rumbled, \"We\u0027re going to win, you know.\" \"I\u0027m becoming convinced of that, Mr. Prime Minister,\" Victor Henry said, trying to control his constricted throat and bring out normal tones. Churchill put on half-moon glasses, took up a paper and glanced at it, then peered over the rims at Henry. \"Your post is naval attache in Berlin. Your President has sent you here to have a look at our RDF, a subject in which you have special knowledge. He reposes much confidence in your judgment.\" Churchill said this with a faint sarcastic note suggesting that he knew Pug was one more pair of eyes sent by Roosevelt to see how the British were taking the German air onslaught; also, that he did not mind the-, scrutiny a bit. \"Yes, sir. We call it radar.\"\"What do you think of my stuff, now that you\u0027ve seen it?\" \u0027The United States could use it.\" Churchill uttered a pleased grunt. \"Really? I haven\u0027t had an opinion quite like that from an American before. Yet some of your best people here have visited Chain Home stations.\" \"Maybe they don\u0027t know what we\u0027ve got. I do.\" \"Well, then, I suggest you report to your President that we simple British have somehow got hold of something he can use.\" \"I\u0027ve done so.\" \"Good! Now have a look at these.\" From under the outspread pile of photographs, the Prime Minister drew several charts and passed them to the American. He dropped his gnawed stub into a shiny brass jar of sand, and lit a fresh cigar, which trembled in his mouth. The colored curves and columns of the charts showed destroyer and merchant ship losses, the rate of new construction, the increase of Nazi-held European coastline, and the rising graph of U-boat sinkings. It was an alarming picture. Puffing clouds of blue and gray smoke, Churchill said that the fifty old destroyers were the only warships that he would ever ask of the President. His own new construction would fill the gap by March. It was a question of holding open the convoy lines and beating off invasion during these next eight months. Every day danger mounted, he said, but the deal was bogging down. Roosevelt wanted to announce the lease of Caribbean naval bases on British islands as a trade for the destroyers. But Parliament would be touchy about bartering British soil for ships. Moreover, the PrestihdeenBtriwtiashntefldeeat written guarantee that if the Nazis invaded and won, would not yield to the Germans or scuttle itself, but would steam to American ports. \"It is ability that I won\u0027t discuss, let alone publicly record,\" Churchill growled. -The German fleet has had considerable practice in scuttling and surrendering. We have had none.\" Churchill added-with a crafty grin that reminded Pug a bit of Franklin Roosevelt-that giving fifty warships to one side in a war perhaps was not a wholly friendly act toward the other side. Some of the President\u0027s advisers feared Hitler might declare war on the United States. That was another difficulty. \"There\u0027s not much danger of that,\" Victor Henry said. \"No, not much hope of that,\" Churchill said, \"I quite agree.\" His eyes under twisted brows looked impish as a comedian\u0027s. Victor Henry felt that the Prime Minister had paid him the compliment of stating his entire war policy in one wily joke. \"Here\u0027s that bad man\u0027s invasion fleet. Landing craft department,\" Churchill went on, scooping up and handing him a sheaf of photographs showing various oddly shaped boats, someair viewed in clusters from the , some photographed close on. \"A raggle-taggle he\u0027s still scraping together. Mostly the prahms they use in inland waterways. Such cockleshells will ease the task of drowning Germans, as we devoutly hope to do to the lot of them. I should like you to tell your President that now is the time to get to work on landing craft. We shall have to go back to France, and we shall need a lot of these. We have got some fairly advanced types, based on designs I made back in 1917- Look at them, while you\u0027re here. We shall want a real Henry Ford effort.\" Victor Henry couldn\u0027t help staring in wonder at this slumping, smokey\"reathed puddle of an old man, fiddling with the thick gold chain across his big black-clad belly, who with three or four combat divisions, with almost no guns or tanks left after Dunkirk, with his back to the wall before a threatened onslaught of Hitler\u0027s hundred and twenty divisions, was talking of invading Europe. Churchill stared back, his broad lower lip thrust out. \"Oh, I assure You we shall do it. Bomber Command is growing by leaps and bounds. We shall one day bomb them till the rubble jumps, and invasion will administer the coup de grace. But we shall need those landing craft.\" He paused, threw his head back, and glared at Henry. \"In fact, we are prepared now to raid Berlin in force, if he dares to bomb London. Should that occur while you\u0027re still here, and if you don\u0027t consider it foolhardy nonsense, you might go along to see how it\u0027s done.\" The pugnacious look faded, the wrinkled eyes blinked comically over the spectacles, and he spoke in slow jocular lisping rhythms. \"Mind you, I don\u0027t suggest you return to your duty post by parachute. It would save time, but might be considered irregular by the Germans, who are sticklers for form.\" Pug thought it was extremely foolhardy nonsense, but he said at once, \"I\u0027d be honored, of course.\" \"Well, well. Probably out of the question. But it would be fun! wouldn\u0027t it?\" Churchill painfully pushed himself out of his chair, and Pug jumped up. \"I trust General Tillet is taking good care of you? You are to see everything here that you\u0027ve a mind to, good or bad.\" \u0027He\u0027s been perfect, sir.\" \u0027Tillet is very good. His views on Gallipoli I regard as slightly unsound, since he makes me out at once a Cyrano, a jackass, and a poltroon.\" He held out his hand. \"I suppose you\u0027ve seen a bit of Hitler. What do you think of him?\" \"Very able, unfortunately.\" \"He is a most wicked man. The German badly wants tradition and authority, or this black face out of the forest appears. Had we restored the Hohenzollems in igig, Hitler might still be aragged tramp, muttering to himself in a squalid Vienna doss house. Now, alas, we must be at considerable trouble to destroy him. And we shall.\" Churchill shook hands at the desk. \"You were in War Plans and you may be again. recommend that you obtain all our latest stuff on landing craft. Ask Tillet.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"We shall require great swarms of the things. Great. .. swarms!\" Churchill swept his arms wide, and Victor Henry saw in his mind\u0027s eye thousands of landing craft crawling toward a beach in a gray dawn. \"Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.\" General Tillet was waiting in his car. They went to a room in the Admiralty where huge wall charts showed the disposition of the fleet. In the blue spaces of the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean, the little colored pins looked sparse and lonesome, but the sowing around the home islands bristled thick. Pins in a thin line marked the great-circle convoy path across the Atlantic; Tillet traced this line with his pipe. \"There\u0027s the problem. We breathe through that tube. If Jerry can cut it, we\u0027ve bought it. Obviously we can use some old destroyers you\u0027ve got lying around from the last war, not doing much of anything.\" \"Yes, so the Prime Minister said. But there\u0027s a political problem, General. Either Hitler\u0027s a menace to the United States, in which case we need everything we\u0027ve got and a lot more-or he isn\u0027t, and in that case why should we let you have part of our Navy to fight him? I\u0027m just giving you the isolationist argument.\" \"Men, Yaas-Of course we hope you\u0027ll think of common traditions and all that, and the advantage of keeping us alive, and the possibility that the Germans and Japanese, dominating Europe and Asia and the oceans, might prove more disagreeable over the years than we\u0027ve been. Now I\u0027m still to show you those landing craft we\u0027ve got up in Bristol, and Fighter Command in Stanmore-\" \"If I can, I\u0027d also like to visit Group operations, Number Eleven Fighter Group.\" Tillet blinked at him. \"Number Eleven? jolly good idea. Take a bit of arranging, but I believe we can lay it on.\" Victor Henry sat in the lobby of the Savoy, waiting for Pamela and her fighter pilot. Uniforms thronged past, with only a sprinkling of dinner jackets on white-headed or bald men. The young women, in colorful thin summer finery, looked like a stream of excited amorous angels. On the brink of being invaded by Hitler\u0027s hordes, England was the gayest place he had ever seen. \\n\\n This was nothing like the glum hedonism of the French in May, going down with knives and forks in their hands. Whenever the American had visited in a hard-driving week-and by now this included shipyards, navy and air bases, factories, government offices, and army maneulvershe had noted the resolute, cheerful spirit, borne out by the rise in production figures. The British were beginning to turn out tanks, planes, guns, and ships as never before. They now claimed to be making airplanes faster than the Germans were knocking them down. The problem was getting to be fighter pilots. If the figures given him were true, they had started with somewhat more than a thousand seasoned men. Combat attrition was taking a steep toll, and to send green replacements into the sides was fruitless. They could kill no Germans and the Germans could kill them. England had to sweat Out 1940 with the fighter pilots on hand. But how fast was the Luftwaffe losing its own trained pilots? That was the key, Tillet said; and the hope was that Goering was already throwing everything in. If so, and if the British could hold on, there would come a crack in Luftwaffe performance. The signal, said Tillet, might be a shift to terror bombing of the cities. \"Here we are, late as hell,\" chirruped Pamela, floating up to him in a mauve silk dress. Pamela\u0027s flier was short, swarthy, broad-nosed, and rather stout, and his thick wavy black hair badly needed cutting. Except for the creased blue uniform, Flight Lieutenant Gallard looked like a young lawyer or businessman rather than an actor, though his brilliant blue eyes, sunken with fatigue, had a dramatic sparkle. Diamonds glittered in Pamela\u0027s ears. Her hair was done up in a makeshift way. Pug thought she had probably emerged from bed rather than a beauty parlor; and fair enough, in the time and place! The notion gave him a pang of desire to be young and in combat. Their table was waiting in the crowded grillroom. They ordered drinks. \"Orange squash,\" said Might lieutenant Callard. \" Two dry martinis. One orange squash. Very good, sir,\" purred the silver-haired waiter, with a low bow. Gallard gave Victor Henry a fetching grin, showing perfect teeth; it made him seem more of an actor. The fingers of his left hand were beating a brisk tattoo on the starched cloth. \"That\u0027s the devil of an order, isn\u0027t it, in the Savoy?\" Pamela said to Pug, \"I\u0027m told he used to drink like a proper sponge, but he went on orange squash the day we declared war.\" Pug said, \"My son\u0027s a Navy flier. I wish he\u0027d go on orange squash.\" \"It\u0027not bad idea. This business up there\"-Gallard raised a thumb toward the ceili(s) ng-\"hap(a) pens fast. You\u0027ve got to look sharp so as to see the other fellow before he seesyou. You have to react fast when you do see him, and then you have to make one quick decision after another. Things get mixed up and keep changing every second. You have to fly that plane for dear life. Now, some of the lads thrive on drink, they say it blows off their steam. I need all my steam for that work.\" \"There\u0027s a lot I\u0027d like to ask you,\" said Victor Henry. \"But probably this is your night to forget about the air war.\" \"Oh?\" Gallard gave Pug a long inquiring look, then glanced at Pamela. \"Not a bit\u0027. Fire away,\" \"How good are they?\" \"The jerries are fine pilots and ruddy good shots. Our newspaper talk about how easy they are makes us a little sick.\" \"And their planes?\" \"The jos a fine machine, but the Spitfire\u0027s a good match for it. The Hurricane\u0027s quite a bit slower; fortunately it\u0027s much more maneuverable. Their twin-engine i io is an inferior machine, seems to handle very stiffly. The bombers of course are sitting birds, if you can get at them.\" \"How\u0027s R.A.F morale?\" Gallard Hipped a cigarette in his mouth and lit it with swift gestures of one hand, \"I\u0027d say it\u0027s very high. But not the way the papers tell it. Not that dashing patriotic business. I can remember the first time I fought Over England, when those dots appeared in the sky just where Fighter Control said they were, I had a bit of that feeling, I thought, rMy, damn their eyes, they\u0027re really trying it, and what the hell are they doing flying over my country? Let\u0027s shoot the bloody bastards down!\" But right away I became damn busy trying not to get shot down myself. That\u0027s how it\u0027s been ever since.\" He smoked in silence, his eyes de and far away, his fingers dancing and dancing. He shifted in the chair, as though it were too hard. \u0027It\u0027s a job, and we\u0027re trying to do our best. It\u0027s a lot more fighting than we had over France. You can tell your son, Captain, that fear\u0027s a big factor, especially as the thing goes on and on. The main thing is learning to live with it. Some chaps simply can\u0027t. We call it LMF, lack of moral fibre. The brute fact is that as range decreases, accuracy increases. You\u0027ve got to close the range. There\u0027s nothing to do about that old truth of warfare. But there\u0027s always the chap who opens up and blazes away from afar, you know, and runs out of bullets and heads for home. And there\u0027s the one who somehow always loses the bird he\u0027s after in the clouds, or who never finds the foe and aborts the mission. One soon knows who they are. \\n\\n Nobody blames them. After a while they\u0027re posted out.\" He fell silent again, looking down at the smoking cigarette in his damped hands, obviously absorbed in memory. He shifted in the chair again, and glanced up from Victor Henry to Pamela, who was watching his face tensely. \"Well -the long and the short of it is, it\u0027s us against the jerries, Captain Henry, and that\u0027s exciting. We\u0027re flying these machines that can cross all of England in half an hour. Excellent gun platforms. Best in the world. We\u0027re doing what very few men can do or ever have done. Or perhaps will ever do again.\" He looked around at the elegant, grillroom full of well-dressed women and uniformed men, and said with an uncivilized grin, the whites showing around His eyeballs, \"If excelling interests you, there it is\u0027-he made the thumb gesture-\"up there.\" \"Your orange squash, sir,\" said the waiter, bowing. \"And just in time,\" said Gallard. \"I\u0027m talking too much.\" Pug raised his glass to Gallard. \"Thanks. Good luck and good hunting.\" Gallard grinned, drank, and moved restlessly in the chair. \"I was an actor of sorts, you know. Give me a cue and I rant away. What does your son fly?\" \"SBD, the Douglas Dauntless,\" said Pug. \"He\u0027s a carrier pilot.\" Gallard slowly nodded, increasing the speed of his finger tattoo. \"Dive bomber.\" \"Yes.\" \"We still argue a lot about that. The jerries copied it from your navy. Our command will have no part of it. The pilot\u0027s in trouble, we say, in that straight predictable path. Our chaps have got a lot of victories against the Stukas. But then again, providing they get all the way down, they do lay those bombs in just where they\u0027re supposed to go. Anyhow, my hat\u0027s off to those carrier fellows, landing on a tiny wobbly patch at sea. I come home to broad immovable mother earth, for whom I\u0027m developing quite an affection.\" \"Ah, I have a rival,\" said Pamela. \"I\u0027m glad she\u0027s so old and so Hat.\" Gallard smiled at her, raising his eyebrows. \"Yes, you\u0027ve rather got her there, haven\u0027t you, Pam?\" During the meal, he described in detail to Victor Henry the way fighter tactics were evolving on both sides. Gallard got very caught u\u0027p in this, swooping both palms to show maneuvers, pouring otrt a rapid fire of technical language. For the first time he seemed to relax, sitting easily in his chair, grinning with enthusiastic excitement. What he was saving was vital intelligence and Pug wanted to remember as much as possible; he drank very little of the Burgundy he had ordered with the roast beef. Pamela at last complained that she was drinking up the bottle by herself. \"I need all my steam, too,\" Pug said. \"More than Ted does.\"\"I\u0027m tired of abstemious heroes. I shall find myself a cowardly sot.\" Gallard was baying his second helping of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding-he was eating enormously, saying that he had lost almost a stone in three weeks and proposed to make it up in three days-when the headwaiter came to him with a written note. Gallard crumpled it up, wiped a napkin across his mouth, and excused himself. He returned in a few minutes, smiled at them, and resumed eating, \"Pam, there\u0027s been a change,\" he abruptly said when his plate was empty. \"Our s uadron\u0027s rest off ops is cancelled. We\u0027ll get it when the weather\u0027s a little cooler.\" He smiled at Victor Henry and drummed ten fingers on the table. \"I don\u0027t mind. One gets fidgety, knowing the thing\u0027s still going on full blast and one\u0027s out of it.\" In the silence at the little table, Victor Henry thought that the ominousness of this summons went much beyond the riskiness of recalling and sending up a fatigued, edgy pilot. It signalled that the R.A.F was coming to the end of its rope. Pamela said, \u0027I\"en do you have to go back? Tomorrow?\" \"Oh, I\u0027m supposed to be on my way now, but I was damned we]] going to enjoy this company, and my beef.\" \"I shall drive you to Biggin Hill,\" \"Well, actually, they\u0027re digging the chaps out of various pubs and places of lesser repute, Pam. We\u0027ll be going up together. Those of us they can find.\" He glanced at his watch. \"I\u0027ll be cracking off soon, but the evening\u0027s young. No reason for you not to go on to that Noel Coward show. I\u0027ve heard it\u0027s very funny.\" Quickly Pug said, \"I think now\u0027s the time for me to leave you Ioth.\" The R.A.F pilot looked him straight in the eye. \u0027Why? Don\u0027t you think you could bear Pamela\u0027s drunken chatter for another little while? Don\u0027t go, Here she is all tarted up for the first time in weeks.\" \"All right,\" Pug said. \"I think I can bear it.\" The pilot and the girl stood. Pamela said, \"So soon? Well, we shall have a nice long stroll through the lobby.\" As Pug got up and offered his hand, Ted Gallard said, \"Good luck to you, Captain Henry, and to that son of yours in the Dauntless clive bomber. Tell him I recommend orange squash. Come and see us at Biggin Hill aerodrome.\" Left alone at the table, Pug sat and wiped his right hand with a napkin. Gallard\u0027s palm had been very wet. He did visit Ted Gallard\u0027s squadron, one afternoon a few days later. \\n\\n Biggin Hill lay southeast of London, squarely in the path of incoming German bombers from the nearest airfields across the Channel. The Luftwaffe was persisting in a fierce effort to knock out Biggin Hill, and the aerodrome was a melancholy scene: wrecked aircraft, burned-out roofless hangars, smashed runways, everywhere the inevitable stinks of burned wood, broken drains, blown-up earth, and smashed plaster. But bulldozers were snorting here and there, patching the runways, and a couple of planes landed as Pug arrived. On stubby fighters dispursed all over the field, mechanics in coveralls were climbing and tinkering, with much loud cheerful profanity. The aerodrome was very much in business. Gallard looked very worn, yet happier than he had been in the Savoy Grill. In the dispersal hut he introduced Pug Henry to a dozen or so hollow-eyed, dishevelled lads in wrinkled uniforms, fleece-lined boots and yellow lifejackets, lounging about on chairs and iron cots, either bareheaded or with narrow blue caps tilted over one eye. The arrival of an American Navy captain in mufti dried up the talk, and for a while the radio played jazz in the awkward silence. Then one pink-cheeked fellow who looked as though he had never shaved, offered Pug a mug of bitter tea, with a friendly insult about the uselessness of navies. He had been shot down by a British destroyer in the Channel, he said, and so might be slightly prejudiced. Pug said that speaking for the honor of navies, he regretted the idiocy; but as a friend of England, he approved the marksmanship. That brought a laugh, and they began talking about flying again, self-consciously for a while, but then forgetting the visitor. Some of the slang baffled him, but the picture was clear enough: everlasting alert, almost no sleep, too many airplanes lost in accidents as well as combat, far too many German fighters, and desperate, proud, nervous high Mk spirits in the much reduced squadron. Pug gathered that almost half the pilots that had started the war were dead. When the six o\u0027clock news came on, the talk stopped and all huddled around the radio. It had been a day of minor combat, but again the Luftwaffe had come off second best in planes shot down, at a rate of about three to two. The fliers made thumbs-up gestures to each other, boyishly grinning. \"They\u0027re fine lads,\" Gallard said, walking Victor Henry back to his car. \"Of course, for your benefit they cut the talk about girls. I\u0027m the middle-aged man of the squadron, and I get left out of it too, pretty much. When they\u0027re not flying, these chaps have the most amazing experiences.\" He gave Pug a knowing grin. \"One wonders how they manage to climb into their cockpits, but they do, they do.\" \"It\u0027s a good time to be alive and young,\" Pug said. \"Yes. You asked me about morale. Now you\u0027ve seen it.\" At the car, as they shook hands,Gallard said diffidently, \"I owe you thanks.\" \"You do? Whatever for?\" \"Pamela\u0027s coming back to England. She told me that when they met you by chance in Washington, she was trying to make up her mind. She decided to ask you about it, and was much impressed by what you said.\" \"Well, I\u0027m flattered. I believe I was right. I\u0027m sure her father\u0027s surviving nicely without her.\" \"Talky? He\u0027ll survive us all.\" It\u0027s not going well,\" general Tillet said, maneuvering his car through a beetle-cluster of wet black taxicabs at Marble Arch. The weather had lapsed into rain and fog; pearl-gray murk veiled a warm, sticky, unwarlike London. Umbrella humps crowded the sidew. The tall red omnibuses glistened wetly; so did the rubber ponchos of the bobbies. The miraculous summer weather had given the air battle an exalting radiance, but today London wore a dreary peacetime morning face. \u0027The spirit at Biggin Hill is damned good,\" Pug said. \"Oh, were you there? Yes, no question about spirit! It\u0027s the arithmetic that\u0027s bad. Maybe the Fat Boy\u0027s getting low on fighter pilots, too. We are, that\u0027s Hat. Perilously low. One doesn\u0027t know the situation on the other side of the hill. One hangs on and hopes.\" The rain trailed off as they drove. After a while the sun hazily sbonc Out on wet endless rows of identical grimy red houses, and sunlight shafted into the car. Tillet said, \"Well, our meteorology blokes are on top of their job. They said the bad weather wouldn\u0027t hold, and that Jerry would probably be flying today. Strange, the only decent English summer in a century, and it comes along in the year the Hun attacks from the sky.\" \"Is that a good or bad break?\" \"It\u0027s to his advantage for locating his target and dropping his bombs. But our interceptors have a better chance of finding him and shooting him down. Given the choice, our chaps would have asked for clear skies.\" He talked of Napoleon\u0027s luck with weather, and cited battles of Charles XII and Wallenstein that had turned on freak storms. Pug enjoyed Tillet\u0027s erudition. He was in no position to challenge any of it, and wondered who was. Tillet appeared to have total kno%vledge of every battle ever fought, and he could get as annoyed with Xerxes or Caesar for tactical stupidity, as he was with Hermann Goering. About an hour later they came to a town, drove along a canal of very dirty water, and turned off to a compound of sooty buildings surrounded by a high wire fence. A soldier at the gate saluted and let them pass. Pug said, \"Where are we?\" \"Uxbridge. I believe you wanted to have a look at Group Operations, Number Eleven FighterGroup,\" said Tillet. \"Oh, yes.\" In three weeks, Tillet had never once mentioned the request and Victor Henry had never repeated it. A flight lieutenant with a pleasant chubby round face met them. He was a lord, but Tillet clicked the long name out too crisply for Pug to catch it. His lordship conducted them out of the bright sunshine, down and down a long turning stairway into the ground. \"One rather expects to encounter a white rabbit, doesn\u0027t one, Captain?\" he fluted in Oxonian tones. \"Hurrying by consulting its pocket watch, and all that. Nothing here that interesting, I\u0027m afraid.\" They entered a shallow balcony in a small strange theatre. In place of the stage and curtain stood a black wall full of columns of electric bulbs, white except for a single line of red lamps near the top. At the side of the wall was a column of R.A.F terms for stages of readiness. On the floor below, twenty or so girls in uniform, some wearing headphones on long lines, worked around a large-scale table map of southern England. On either wall, in glassed boxes like radio control booths, men with headphones scrawled at desks. The place had an underground, earthandcement smell, and it was quiet and cool. \"Burne-Wilke, here\u0027s your American visitor,\" said Tillet. The blond officer sitting in the middle of the balcony turned, smiling. \"Hullo there! Frightfully glad to hear you were coming. Here, sit by me, won\u0027t you?\" He shook hands with them. \"Nothing much doing yet, but there will be soon. The bad weather\u0027s drifting clear of the Channel, and Jerry\u0027s getting airborne.\" Burne-Wilke rubbed his bony pink chin with one hand, giving Pug a quizzical glance. \"I say, those aeroplanes you rounded up have proven ever so useful.\" \"They can\u0027t play in this league,\" Pug said. \"They\u0027re excellent on patrol. They\u0027ve done some smart punishing of invasion barges. The pilots are keen on them.\" Burne-Wilke looked him in the eye. \"See here, could you have produced those planes in two days?\" Pug only grinned. Burne-Wilke shook his head and caressed his wavy hair. \"I was sorely tempted to take you up. But you struck me as a chap who might just bring it off, and then we\u0027d have looked proper fools. Hullo, there\u0027s a mutual friend. Didn\u0027t I first meet you with the Tudsburys, in a sweaty Washington receiving line?\" Pamela was walking in to take the place of another girl. She looked UP, threw Victor Henry a smile, then got to work, and did not glance his way again. \"This is all fairly clear, isn\u0027t it?\" said Burne-Wilke, gesturing toward the map and the wall. \\n\\n \"Fighter Command at Stanmore is responsible for air defense, but it lets each group run its own show. Our beat is southeast England. It\u0027s the hot spot, closest to the Germans, and London\u0027s here.\" He swept one lean arm toward the wall, straight up and down. \"Those six columns of, lamps stand for our group\u0027s six fighter control stations. Each vertical row of lights stands for one fighter squadron. All in all, twenty-two squadrons. In theory, we dispose of more than five hundred fighter pilots.\" Burne-Wilke wrinkled his lips. \"In theory. just now we\u0027re borrowing pilots from other groups. Even so, we\u0027re way under. However...\" He gestured toward the bottom part of the black wall, where white lights burned in a ragged pattern. \"Going up the wall, you step up in readiness, dU you get to AMORNE, ENEMY iN siGiErr, and of course IENGA. That\u0027s the red row of lamps. Our six substations talk to us and to the pilots. Here we put together the whole picture. If things warm up enough, the air vice-marshal may come in and run the show.-Oh, yes. Those poor devils under glass on the left collect reports from our ground observer corps, on the right from our anti-aircraft. So all the information about German planes in our air will show up here fairly fast.\" Pug was not quite as surprised as he had been at Ventnor. He knew of the system\u0027s existence; but this close view awed him. \"Sir, aren\u0027t you talking about a couple of hundred thousand miles of telephone cable? Thousands of lines, a forest of equipment? When did all this spring into being?\" \"Oh, we had the plan two years ago. The politicians were aghast at the money, and balked. Right after Munich we got our budget. It\u0027s an ill wind, eh? Hullo, here we go. I believe Jerry\u0027s on his way.\" On the black wall, white lights were starting to jump upward. The young lord at Burne-Wilkes elbow gave him a telephone. Burne-Wilke talked brisk R.A.F abracadabra, his eyes moving from the wall to the map table. Then he handed back the telephone. \"Yes. Chain Home at Ventnor now reports several attacks forming up or orbiting. Two of them are forty-plus, one sixty-plus.\" Tillet said, \"Goering\u0027s been an abysmal donkey, hasn\u0027t he, not to knock out our Chain Home stations? It will prove his historic mistake.\" \"Oh, he has tried,\" Burne-Wilke said. \"It isn\u0027t so easy. Unless one hits a steel tower dead on and blows it to bits, it just whips about like a palm tree in a storm, then steadies down.\" \"Well, he should have gone on trying.\" White lights kept moving up the board. An air of business was settling over the operationsroom, but nobody moved in an excited way, and the hum of voices was low. The air vice-marshal appeared, a spare stern sparse-moustached man, with a sort of family resemblancp to General Tillet. He ignored the visitors for a while as be paced, then said hello to Tillet with a surprising warm smile that made him look kind and harmless. The first lights that leaped to red were in the column of the Biggin Hill control station. Victor Henry saw Pamela glance up at these lights. On the table, where she busily continued to lay arrows and numbered discs with the other girls, a clear picture was forming of four flights of attackers, moving over southern England on different courses. The reports of the telephone talkers on the floor merged into a steady subdued buzz. There was not much chatting in the balcony. Henry sat overwhelmed with spectator-sport fascination, as one by one the red lamps began to come on. Within twenty minutes or so, half the squadrons on the board were blinking red. \"That\u0027s about it,\" Burne-Wilke said off handedly, breaking away from giving rapid orders. \"We\u0027ve got almost two hundred planes engaged. The others stand by to cover, when these land to refuel and rearm.\" \"Have you ever had red lights across the board?\" Burne-Wilke wrinkled his mouth. \"Now and then. It\u0027s not the situation of choice. We have to call on other fighter groups then to cover for us, and just now there\u0027s not much left in reserve.\" Far away and high in the blue sky, thought Pug, forcing himself to picture it, planes were now darting and twisting in and out of clouds in a machine joust to the death of German kids and British kids, youngsters like Warren and Byron. Pamela\u0027s pudgy actor, cold sober on orange squash, was up there in his yellow life jacket, flying at several hundred miles an hour, watching his rearview mirror for a square white nose, or squirting his guns at an onrushing airplane with a black cross on it. Two of the Biggin Hill fights moved up to white: RETURNINg, 13ASE. \"These things seldom last longer than an hour or so from the time Jerry starts,\" said Burne-Wilke. \"He runs dry rather fast and has to head back. They keep falling in the sea like exhausted bats. Prisoners say that the Luftwaffe has given the Channel an impolite name-roughly equivalent to your American \u0027shit creek.\"\u0027 Within a few minutes, the red lights blinked off one by one. The air vice-marshal left. Below, the girls began clearing markers off the table. Lord Burne-Wilke spoke on the telephone, collecting reports. He put slender, hairy hands over his face and rubbed hard, then turned to Pug, his eyes reddened. \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to say hello to Pamela Tudsbury?\" \"Very much. How did it go?\"Widi a weary shrug, Burne-Wilke said, \"One can\u0027t stop every bomber. I\u0027m afraid quite a number got through and did their work. Often once the fires are out, things don\u0027t look so bad. We lost a number of planes. So did they. The count takes a day or so to firm up. I think we did all right.\" As Pug went out with the young lord, leaving Tillet conversing with the slumped senior officer, he glanced back at the theatre. On the wall, all lights were burning at or near the bottom again. The room was very quiet, the earth smell strong. The staircase to the surface seemed very long and steep. Pug felt drained of energy, though he had done nothing but sit and watch. He puffed and panted and was glad to see the daylight. Pamela stood in the sun outside in a blue uniform. \" Well, you made it, but not on the best day. Ted\u0027s down.\" Her voice was calm, even chatty, but she gave his hand a nervous squeeze in two ice-cold hands. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes. He may have parachuted, but his plane dove into the sea. Two of his squadron mates reported it. He\u0027s down.\" She clung to his hand, looking into his face with glistening eyes. \"Pam, as you\u0027ve said, they often climb out of the water, and go right back to work.\" \"Oh, certainly. Leave that to Ted. I\u0027ve asked for a special pass. I think I shall come to London this evening. Would you buy me a dinner?\" A week passed, and another, and Gallard did not return. Pamela came several times to London. Once Victor Henry remarked that she appeared to be fighting the war only when it suited her. \"I am behaving shockingly,\" she said, \" using every trick I know, presuming on everybody\u0027s sympathy and good nature, and pushing them all much too far. I shall soon be confined to camp until further notice. By then you\u0027ll be gone. Meantime you\u0027re here.\" It became a settled thing among the Americans that Pug Henry had found himself a young W.A.A.F. To cheer her up, he took her often to Fred Fearing\u0027s apartment on Belgrave Square, the center for the partying American-British crowd. Shortly after the Christmas night row with Rhoda, the Germans had expelled Fearing for telling the truth about some bomb damage in Hamburg. Fearing was having such a good time with the London girls that, as he put it, he often arrived at the broadcasting studio on his hands and knees. His thrilling and touching word pictures of England at war were stirring up so much sympathy in the United States that isolationists were claiming he was obviously in the pay of the British. The second time Victor Henry brought Pamela to the apartment, Fearing remarked, catching Pug alone for a moment in the hallway, \"Aren\u0027t you the sly one, Reverend Henry? She\u0027s small, but saucy.\"\"She\u0027s the daughter of a guy I know.\" \"Of course. Talky Tudsbury. Old pal of mine, too.\" \"Yes. That\u0027s who she is. Her fiance\u0027s an R.A.F pilot missing in action.\" Fearing\u0027s big knobby face lit in an innocent smile. \"Just so. She might enjoy a little consolation.\" Pug looked up at him. The correspondent was over six feet tall, and heavily built. \"How would you enjoy getting knocked on your ass?\" Fearing\u0027s smile went away. \"You mean it, Pug?\" \"I mean it.\" \"Just asking. What do you hear from Rhoda?\" \"She misses me, New York stinks, she\u0027s bored, and the weather is unbearably hot.\" \"Situation normal. Good old Rhoda.\" The other men who drifted in and out of the apartment, usually with a woman, usually more or less drunk-observers from the Army and the Air Corps, correspondents, film actors, businessmen-danced or bantered with Pamela, but otherwise let her alone, assuming she was Victor Henry\u0027s deary. Once, early in September, when they were having a drink in her apartment and joking about this, Pug said, \"\u0027Lechery, lechery-still wars and lechery-nothing else holds fashion.\"\u0027 She widened her eyes at him. \"Why, bless me. He\u0027s a Shakespeare scholar, too.\" \"Aside from Western stories, Pamela, practically the only things I read for recreation are the Bible and Shakespeare,\" Pug said, rather solemnly. \"It\u0027s always time well spent. You can get through a lot of Shakespeare in a Navy career.\" \"if \"Well, there\u0027s precious little lechery around here,\" said Pamela. people only knew.\" \"Are you complaining, my girl?\" \"Certainly not, you leathery old gentleman. I can\u0027t imagine how your wife endures you.\" \"Well, I\u0027m good, patient, uncomplaining company.\" \"God love you, you are that.\" At this point the air raid sirens started their eerie moaning and wailing-a heart-stopping noise no matter how often Pug heard it. \\n\\n \"My God!\" said Pamela. \"There they come! This is it. Where on earth is Fighter Command?\" She stood with Victor Henry on the little balcony outside her living room, still holding her highball glass, staring at arrays of bombers in wide ragged V\u0027s as they sailed through a bright blue sky, starkly visible in yellowing late sunlight. Anti-aircraft bursts all around and through the formations looked like white and black powder puffs, and seemed to be having no more effect. \"Tangling with the fighter escort further south, I\u0027d guess.\" Victor Henry\u0027s voice shook. The number of bombers staggered him. The mass of machines was poming on like the invaders in a futuristic movie, filling the air with a throbbing angry hum as of a billion bees. The pop and thump of scattered anti-aircraft guns made a pitiful counterpoint. One V-wave passed; in the azure distance several more appeared, swelling to unbelievable width and numbers as they drew over the city. The bombers were not very high, and the A.A. seemed to be exploding dead inside the V\u0027s, but on they thrummed. The muffled thunder of bomb hits boomed over the city, and pale flame and smoke began billowing up in the sunshine. Pug said, \"Looks like they\u0027re starting on the docks.\" \"Shall I get you another drink? I must, I must have one.\" She took his glass and hurried inside. More bombers kept appearing from the southeast. Pug wondered whether General Tillet could be right; was this a sign of weakening, a play of Goering\u0027s last card? Some show of weakness! Yet a heavy toll of an fighter escorts must be paying for the incredibly serene overflight of these bomber waves. The British fighters could knock these big slow machines down like tin ducks. They had proved that long ago, yet On the bombers came, sailing unscathed across London\u0027s sky from horizon to horizon, an awesome pageant of flying machinery. She brought the drinks and peered at the sky. \"Why, God help us, there\u0027s more of them!\" She leaned against the rail, touching shoulders. He put his arm around her and she nestled against him. So they stood together, watching the Luftwaffe start its effort to bomb London to its knees. It was the seventh of September. Along the river more and bigger fires shot skyward in great billows of dirty smoke. Elsewhere in the city random small blazes were flaring up from badly aimed bombs. After the first shock, there was not much terror in the sight. The noise was far off, the patches of fire meager and dispersed in the red and gray expanse of untouched buildings. London was a very, very large city. The Fat Boy\u0027s big try was not making much of a dent after all. Only along the burning Thames embankment was there a look of damage. So it seemed, in the view from Pamela\u0027s balcony of the first allout Valhalla attack. \\n\\n So it seemed too in Soho, where they went to dine after the all clear. The Londoners thronging the sidewalk looked excited, undisruayed, even elated. Strangers talked to each other, laughed, and pointed thumbs up. The traffic flowed thick as ever. There was no trace of damage on the street. Distant clangs of fire engines and a heavy smokiness overhead remained the only traces, in this part of town, of Goering\u0027s tremendous attempt. Queues even stood as usual outside the movie houses, and the stage box offices were briskly selling tickets too. When they walked in twilight down toward the Thames, after an excellent Italian dinner, the picture began to change. The smell of smoke grew stronger; flickering red and yellow light gave the low clouds, thickened by ever-billowing smoke, a look of inferno. The crowds in the street grew denser. It became an effort to push through. The people here were more silent and grave. Henry and Pamela came to roped-off streets where amid noise and steam, shouting firemen dragged hoses toward blackened buildings and streamed water at tongues of fire licking out of the windows. Pamela skirted through alleys and side streets till they emerged on the riverbank into a mob of onlookers. Here an oppressive stench of burning fouled the air, and the river breeze brought gusts of fiery heat in the warm summer night. A low moon shone dirty red through the rolling smoke. Reflections of the fires on the other bank flickered in the black water. The bridge was slowly disgorging a swarm of refugees, some with carts, baby carriages, and wheelchairs, a poor shabby lot for the most part, many workmen in caps, and a horde of ill-dressed children who alone kept their gaiety, running here and there as they came. the smoke, Victor Henry looked up at the sky. Above rifts in the stars shimmered. \"It\u0027s a very clear night, you know,\" he said. \"These fires are a beacon they can see for a hundred miles. They may come back.\" e. I\u0027m Pamela said coldly and abruptly, \"I must return to Uxbridg beginning to feel rotten.\" She looked down at her flimsy gray dress. \"But I seem to be slightly out of uniform.\" The sirens began their hideous screaming just as Pug and Pamela found a taxicab, many blocks from the river. \"Come along,\" said the wizened little driver, touching his cap. \"Business as usual, wot? And to jell with \u0027Itler!\" tched the start of the night raid from the balcony victor Henry waned b while she changed. His senses were sharpe v the destruction, the excitement, the peculiar beauty of the fire panorama and the swaying blue-white searchlight beams, the thick thrumming of a number of motors, and the thump-thump of the anti-aircraft, going out on the gloomy moonlit balcony in her Pamela Tudsbury, in her W.A.A.F uniform,\" appeared to him the most desirable young female on God\u0027s earth. She looked -honer because of the low-heeled shoes, but the severe garb made,her small figure all the sweeter. So he thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1587/47198.html","bookId":1254,"book":{"id":1254,"title":"The Winds of War 战争风云","description":"简介： 《战争风云》是小说，书中关于亨利一家的人物和事迹纯属虚构。但小说中有关战争的史实是确凿的；统计数字是可靠的；那些大人物的言行要不是根据史实，便是根据可靠的记载。象这样范围的工作不可能没有错误，但作者希望读者们能看出，他是在尽很大的努力给一次大规模的世...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/24/13-38-35-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1587","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
