{"id":43124,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"Roosevelt did nothing to save the Jews. He knew that any such action would annoy Congress and interfere with winning the war. Under his clever facade of a Christian humanitarian liberal, he was one of the coldest, most ruthless calculators in history. He sensed that the Americans liked the Jews no more than we did; and they omply confirmed this all through the war in their immigration policies, and at the Evian and Bermuda conferences, where they simply abandoned the Jews to their fate. This author is no admirer of Roosevelt as a person, but the aim of my work is to set down the facts as military history should view them. On such a valuation, Franklin Roosevelt was the mastermind of the war. Even such a powerful, energetic, and brilliant figure as Adolf Hitler was in the end no more than a foil for him. Adventuristic conquerors often pave the way, in this fashion, for the dominion of their enemies. The adventurer sees the opportunity, and with meager means tries to capture it. He does the destroying and the bulldozing. His iceblooded successor then crushes him and builds on the ruins. Napoleon in the last analysis merely put Wellington\u0027s England in the saddle for a century. Charles XII hardly has a place in history, except as a foil for Peter the Great. And the German people under Adolf Hitler accomplished nothing in the long run except to hand the British succession to the United States under Roosevelt. Roosevelt\u0027s Difficulty Franklin Roosevelt\u0027s problem was that at this great turning point in history he did not lead a warlike nation, whereas Adolf Hitler did. The American people are not cowardly. But, living in prosperous isolation, they have been the spoiled children of modern history. Spoiled children do not bear well the rigors of the field. Once they entered the war, the Americans fought with a logistic train of luxury and self-protection that to the warriors of Germany, the Soviet union, and even England, was laughable. Nevertheless they had the riches and the will for this. The strong can fight any kind of fight, they please. The Americans have a tradition of militia-like fighting. Presented with a threat, they drop their pleasures, take up arms, and fight amateurishly but bravely to get the thing over with. They formed this pattern in their revolution, and confirmed it in their civil war and the First World War. Roosevelt understood this. He had to hold Germany at bay until he could present the chance for world conquest to his people in the guise of a threat to their safety. This, with a masterly exhibition of patient, spiderlike waiting, he did. Meantime, he robbed Germany of two certain victories-over GreatBritain and over the Soviet union-by an inspired instrument of indirect war-making, a genuine new thing in military history, the so-called Lend-Lease Act. A Cunning Trick By the end of 1940, despite her narrow escapes at Dunkirk and in the air battle, Britain was sinking to her knees. She had only one recourse left on the planet to save her: the United States. But the Neutrality Act threatened to cut the English off from the American farms and factories that were keeping them alive. They were running out of dollars to pay even for grain and oil, let alone the ships, planes, guns, and bullets which they could no longer manufacture for themselves in the necessary quantities. For they lacked labor, materials, and plant, and they kept falling further behind under air attack. The Neutrality Act forced belligerents to pay dollars for United States goods, and to come and fetch them. The Act posed more of a dilemma for Roosevelt than for the British. For them, one clear wise course lay open: negotiated peace with Germany. As this writer has often pointed out, had England made such a peace the British Empire would exist today. The Soviet union would have been crushed in a one-front war, and instead of a rampant Bolshevism we would see in Russia at worst some pacific, disarmed form of social democracy. But none of this fitted in with Roosevelt\u0027s ideas. He had no intention of allowing Germany to gain ascendancy over the Euro-Asian heartland in a world-dominating partnership with the sea lords of Britannia. And so, to circumvent the Neutrality Act, Franklin Roosevelt devised LendLease, which was nothing more or less than a Policy to give the British free of charge-and later the Russians too-all the war materials they needed to fight us! The audacity of the trick was breathtaking; the disguise was cunning. And while the record shows that Roosevelt\u0027s clever advisers did much to push this unprecedented proposal through the stunned, balky Congress, it also clearly shows that the revolutionary idea sprang, in the phrase of Sherwood, straight from Roosevelt\u0027s \"forested mind.Roosevelt sold this scheme to the simpleminded, inattentive American people with a typical bit of Augustan demagoguery, the famous comparison to a garden hose. When a neighbor\u0027s house is on fire, he said at a press conference, one does not bargain with him over the sale or renting of the garden hose he needs to put it out. One gladly lends him the hose, so as to keep the fire from one\u0027s own house. Once the fire is out, the neighbor returns the hose; or if he has damaged it, there is time enough then to settle the account. This was, of course, shameless and hollow Poppycock. Warships, warPlanes, war materials are not garden hoses. To take Roosevelt\u0027s comparison at its face value, if your neighbor\u0027s house is on fire, what you really do is rush over there and fight the fire with him. You do not lend him your hose, and then stand idly by watching him try to cope with the flames. That this silly stuff was swallowed whole by the Americans simply shows how uncannily shrewd Roosevelt was in managing them. During his successful 1940 election campaign for an unprecedented third term, he had declared in a famous speech, \"I tell you again, and again, and again, you boys are not going to be sent into foreign wars.\" He Was eagerly awaiting a chance to go back on this clear pledge. Meantime he had to use tricks and guile to oppose Germany,The Real Meaning of Lend-Lease it was impossible for himnci this he knew-to present the case to his People in realistic terms. Otherwise he could have told them in effect, \"My friends, this war is for the mastery of the world. Our aim should be to achieve thot mastery ourselves, but with a minimum of blood. Let us encourage others to do our fighting for us. Let us give them all the stuff they need to keep fighting. What do we care? In developing the industries to produce this Lend-Lease stuff, we will be preparing ourselves, industrially and militarily, for world leadership. They will use up all our early models, our discardable stuff, killing Germans for us. Maybe they will do the whole job for us, but that is doubtful. We will have to step in at the end, but mopping up will be easy. We will have gained a world victory with the expenditure of a lot of hardware, which we can turn out faster, and in greater quantities, than all the world put together, without even feeling the pinch. The others will shed the blood, and we will take the rule.\" That was what Lend-Lease meant and that was how it worked. First the British, and then the Russians, were induced by Lend-Lease to keep on with extremely bloody,. almost hopeless struggles, when the easier, safer, more profitable alternative of negotiated peace always lay open to them. There is reason to think that Stalin\u0027s low point late in 1941, when his armies and his air force had virtually ceased to exist as coherent battle formations and we were smashing toward Moscow, that supreme realist would have proposed peace again, if not for the encouragement in words and supplies-not in livesf the United States. As it was, the Russian people made sacrifices in blood never matched in all history, to transfer world hegemony from one Anglo-Saxon power to another. And Franklin Roosevelt so maneuvered matters that the British had to beg for this bloodletting help! They were put in the position of being abjectly grateful for the chance to fight Roosevelt\u0027s battles On December 8, 1940, Churchill wrote the American President a very long letter, which deserves a bolder place in history than it now holds. Churchill once said that he had not become Prime Minister to preside over the dissolution of the Empire, but with this letter he dissolved it. Churchill in this document frankly stated that England had come to the end of her rope, in the matter of ships, planes, materials, and dollars; and he asked the President to \"f,nrJ w.-jvs and. mpans\" to heir) England in the common cause. This was what Roosevelt had been icily waiting for in his wheelchair: this written confession by the British Prime ,Ainister that without American aid the Empire was finished. Within two weeks he had proposed Lend-Lease to his advisers, and within a month he had laid it before Congress. Empire means rule, and sufficient armed power to enforce the rule. In Churchill\u0027s letter, he acknowledged that his country and his Empire had become powerless to enforce their rule, and begged for succor. \\n\\n Roosevelt leaped to comply. Even if England was finished as an imperial power, she remained a country of forty millions with a good navy and air force, at war with Roosevelt\u0027s archrival; a splendid island base just off the coast of Europe, moreover, from which to attack Germany in the future. The first order of business was to keep her fighting. Bargain War-Making Despite all the quack language in the act about lending and leasing, the transfer of American weapons and materials throughout the war was a gift. No formal accounting was even kept. The President asked, and the Congress granted him, power to send arms and war goods wherever he pleased, in whatever quantities he pleased. Certainly the Congress when they passed the low would have balked at including Bolshevist countries. But at that time the Soviet union supposedly Hitler\u0027s friend. Later, when broke out on the eastern front, Rooseveltp(was) ouredafloodofsuppliestotheBolsheviksw(war) ithout consulting Congress. The Americans complain that the Russians have never shown proper gratitude. The attitude of the Russians is more realistic. Having spilled the blood of perhaps eleven million of their sons to help the United States to its present world position, they tend to feel that the tanks and planes were paid for. The Yankees love a bargain. Lend-Lease was bargain war-making. For the big corporations, and for millions of workers, it merely meant a tremendous increase of prosperity. The price was painlessly postponed to the future by means of defense bonds. Others did the actual fighting and dying. Roosevelt and his advisers did discuss the risk that Germany would take Lend-Lease as an act of war-which it certainly was-and would formally declare war on the United States. Since this was just what he wanted, he was prepared to run the risk. America would have responded with a militia-like surge. Little as Adolf Hitler understood the United States, he did understand that. He had no intention of taking on the United States until he had finished with the Soviet union, an operation which was already in an advanced planning stage. So Germany swallowed Lend-Lease with some harsh words, and the \"arsenal of democracy\" tooled up to help British plutocracy and Russian Bolshevism destroy the Reich, the last bastion in Europe against the Red Slav tide. TRANSLATOR\u0027S NOTE: Most broad statistics of the war are approximations, and the Pigures on total deaths vary widely from one source to another. The low rate of eventual American losses is a fact. We planned and fought that kind of war, expending money and machines instead of human lives where possible. Roon seems to think this indicates a deficiency in American valor. \\n\\n We had enough valor to beat the Germans wherever we took them on. That was all the valor we needed.-V.H. Traveling to his new post in mid-january, Leslie Slote found himTself staged in Lisbon by a shortage of Lufthansa accommodations to Berlin. He checked into the Palace Hotel in Estoril, Lisbon\u0027s palm-lined seaside resort, where diplomats, wealthy refugees, Gestapo, and other foreign agents congregated. He thought he might pick up some information there while he waited for an air reservation to open up. Actually, he found Estoril in January an exceedingly chilly and boring place. The Germans abounded, but they kept in aloof clusters, regarding other people with supercilious eyes. He sat in the crowded lobby of the hotel one afternoon gnawing at his pipe, and reading in a Swiss newspaper about British successes against the Italians in Abyssinia and North Africa, faint rays in the gloom. The neutral newspaper had been hard to come by. Fascist and Nazi journals now blanketed Portuguese newsstands, with a few scrawny, disgustingly servile periodicals from Vichy France. British and American publications had vanished. It was a fair barometric reading of the way the war was going, at least in the judgment of Portugal\u0027s rulers. A year ago, on Lisbon newsstands, papers of both sides had been equally available. \"Meestair Slotel Meestair Leslie Slotel\u0027 He jumped up and followed the small pink-cheeked page to a telephone near the reception desk. \"Leslie? Hello, it\u0027s Bunky. How goes it by the old seaside?\" Bunker Wendel! Thurston, Jr had attended the Foreign Service school with Slote, and now held the post of second secretary in the American legation in Lisbon. \"Mighty dull, Bunky. What\u0027s up?\" \u0027Oh, nothing much.\" Thurston sounded amused. \u0027It\u0027s just that you\u0027ve spoken to me now and then, I believe, about a girl named Natalie Jastrow.\" Slote said sharply, \"Yes, I have. What about her?\" \"A girl by that name is sitting across the desk from me.\" \"Who is? Natalie?\" \"Like to talk to her? When I told her you were here she jumped a ip foot. \"Christ, yes.\" Natalie came on the phone laughing, and Slote\u0027s heart throbbed at the familiar lovely sound. \"Hello, old Slote,\" she said. \"Natalie! This is so staggering, and wonderful. What are you doing here?\" \"Well, how about you?\" Natalie said. \"I\u0027m as surprised as you are. \\n\\n Why aren\u0027t you in Moscow?\" \"I got hung up, in Washington and then here. Is Aaron with you?\" \"I wish he were. He\u0027s in Siena.\" \"What! Aren\u0027t you on your way back to the States?\" Natalie took a moment to answer. \u0027Yes and no. Leslie, as long as you\u0027re here, can I see you for a while?\" \"Naturally! Wonderful! Immediately! I\u0027ll come in to the legation.\" \"Wait, wait. You\u0027re at the Palace Hotel, aren\u0027t you? I\u0027ll come out and meet you. I\u0027d rather do that.\" Bunky Thurston came on the line. \"Look, Leslie, I\u0027ll put her on the bus. She\u0027ll arrive in half an hour or so. If I may, I\u0027ll join you two in the Palace lobby at five.\" She still had a fondness for big dark hats. He could see her through the dusty bus window, moving down the aisle in a jam of descending Passengers. She ran to him, threw her arms around him, and kissed his cheek. \u0027Hi! I\u0027m freezing. I could have worn my ratty beaver coat, but who\u0027d think it would be this cold and gray in Lisbon? Brrr! It\u0027s even colder out here by the sea, isn\u0027t it?\" She clapped her hand to her hat as the wind flapped it. \"Let\u0027s look at you. Well! No change. If anything, you look rested.\" She said all this very fast, her eyes wide and shiny, her manner peculiarly excited. The old spell worked at once. In the months since he had last seen Natalie, Slote had started up a romance with a girl from Kansas named Nora Jamison. Nora was tall, brunette, and dark-eyed like this one, but otherwise as different as a doe from a bobcat: eventempered, affectionate, bright enough to be in her third year as a senator\u0027s secretary, and pretty enough to play leads with a semiprofessional Washington theatre group. Her father was a rich farmer; she drove a Buick convertible. She was altogether a find, and Slote was thinking seriously of marrying her on his return from Moscow. Nora worshipped and she was better looking than Natalie Jastrow and much easier to manage. But this Jewish girl in the big hat put her arm around him and brushed his face with her lips; he experienced a stabbing remembrance of what her love was like, and the snare closed on him again. He said, \"Well, you know how I admire you, but you do look slightly beat up.\" \"Do I ever! I\u0027ve had hell\u0027s own time getting here. Let\u0027s get out of this wind. Where\u0027s the Palace Hotel? I\u0027ve been to Estoril twice, but I forget.\" He said, taking her arm and starting to walk, \"It isn\u0027t far. What\u0027s the story? Why didn\u0027t Aaron come? What are you doing here?\" \"Byron\u0027s arriving tomorrow on a submarine.\" He halted in astonishment. She looked up athim, hugged his arm, and laughed, her face alive with joy. \"That\u0027s it. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\" \"He made it through that school?\" \"You sound surprised.\" \"I thought he might find it too much work.\" \"He squeaked by. This is his first long cruise. The sub\u0027s stopping here, just for a few days. I suppose you think I\u0027m rattlebrained, but he wrote me to come and meet him, and here I am.\" \"Nothing you do really surprises me, sweetie. I\u0027m the man you came to visit in Warsaw in August \u002739-\" Again she squeezed his arm, laughing. \"So I did. Quite an excursion that turned out to be, Hey! My God, it\u0027s cold here! It\u0027s a wonder all these palm trees don\u0027t Turn brown and die. You know, I\u0027ve been through Lisbon twice before, Slote, and each time I\u0027ve b(Nn utterly miserable. It feels very strange to be happy here.\" He asked her about Aaron Jastrow\u0027s situation. Natalie said the impact of the note from the Secretary of State\u0027s office had somehow been frittered away. The discovery that Jastrow\u0027s lapsed passport showed a questionable naturalization had fogged his case. Van Wmaker, the young consul in Florence, had dawdled for almost a month, promising action and never getting around to it; then he had fallen ill and gone for a cure in France, and several more weeks had slipped by. Now Van Wmaker was corresponding with the Department on how to deal with the matter. She had his firm promise that, one way or another, he would work it out. The worst of it was, she declared, that Aaron himself really was in no hurry to leave his villa, now that it seemed just a matter of unravelling a little more red tape. He half welcomed every new delay, though he went through the motions of being vexed. This was what was defeating her. He would not fight, would not put any pressure on the consul to settle the thing. He was writing serenely away at his Constantine book, keeping to all his little routines and rituals, drinking coffee in the lemon house, taking his walks at sunset, rising before dawn to sit blanketed on the terrace and watch the sun come up. He believed that the Battle of Britain had decided the war, that Hitler had made his bid and failed, and that a negotiated peace would soon emerge. \"I suppose I made a mistake, after all, going back to Italy,\" she said, as they walked into the hotel. \"With me around he\u0027s perfectly comfortable and not inclined to budge.\" Slote said, \"I think you were right to return. He\u0027s in more danger than he realizes, and needs a hard push. Maybe you and I together can shake him free.\" \"But you\u0027re going to Moscow.\" \"I have thirty days, and I\u0027ve only used up ten. Perhaps I\u0027ll go back to Rome with you. I know several people in that embassy.\" \"That would be Marvelous!\" Natalie halted in the middle of the pillared lobby. \"Where\u0027s thebar?\" \"It\u0027s down at that end and it\u0027s very dismal and beery. It\u0027s virtually Gestapo headquarters. Why? Would you like a drink?\" \"I\u0027d just as lief have tea, Leslie.\" Her manner was oddly evasive. \"I haven\u0027t eaten a I day. I w I as just wondering where the bar was.\" He took her to a long, narrow public room full of people in sofas and armchairs drinking tea or cocktails. Walking down the smoky room behind the headwaiter, they heard conversations in many languages: German was the commonest, and only one little group was talking English. \u0027Izague of Nations here,\" Namlie said, as the waiter bowed them into a dark corner with a sofa and two chairs, \"except that so many look Jewish.\" \"A lot of them are,\" Slote said dolefully. \"Too many of them are.\" Natalie devoured a whole plate of sugared cakes with her tea. \"I shouldn\u0027t do this, but I\u0027m famished. I\u0027m big as a house. I\u0027ve gained ten pounds in six months at the villa. I just eat and eat.\" \"Possibly I\u0027m prejudiced, but I think you look like the goddess of love, if a bit travel-worn. \"Yes, you mean these hefty Venus de Milo hips, hey?\" She darted a pleased look at him. \"I hope Byron likes hips. I\u0027ve sure got\u0027em.\" \"I hadn\u0027t noticed your hips, but I assure you Byron will like them. Not that I really think you\u0027re worrjed. There\u0027s Bunky Thurston.\" Slote waved as a little man at the doorway far down the room came toward them. \"Bunky\u0027s a prince of a fellow.\" \"He has the world\u0027s most impressive mustache,\" Natalie said. \"It\u0027s quite a mustache,\" Slote said. The mustache approached, a heavy rounded tawny brush with every hair gleamingly in place, attached to a pleasant pink moon face set on a slight body dressed in natty gray flannel. Slote said, \"Hi, Bunky. You\u0027re late for tea, but just in time for a drink.\" With a loud sigh, Thurston sat. \"Thanks. I\u0027ll have a double Canadian Club and water. What foul weather. The chill gets in your bones. Natalie, here\u0027s that list I promised you.\" He handed her a folded mimeographed sheet. \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll agree that it kills the notion. Now, I couldn\u0027t track down Conanander Bathurst, but I left word everywhere. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll call me here within the hour.\" Slote glanced inquisitively at the paper in Natalie\u0027s hand. It was a list of documents required for a marriage of foreigners in Portugal, and there were nine items. Avidly studying the sheet, Natalie drooped her shoulders and glanced from Slote to Thurston. \\n\\n \u0027Why, getting all this stuff together would take months!\u0027 \"I\u0027ve seen it done in one month,\" Thurston said, \"but six to eight weeks is more usual. The Portuguese government doesn\u0027t especially want foreigners to get married here. I\u0027m not sure why. In peacetime we send people over to Gibraltar, where you go through like greased lightning. But the Rock is shut up tight now.\" \"Thinking of getting married?\" Slote said to Natalie. She colored at the dry tone. \"That was one of many things Byron wrote about. I thought I might as well check. It\u0027s obviously impossible, not that I thought it was such a hot idea anyway.\" \"Who\u0027s Commander Bathurst?\" Slote said. Thurston said, \u0027Our naval attache. He\u0027ll know exactly when the submarine\u0027s arriving.\" He tossed off half his whiskey when the waiter set it before him, and carefully smoothed down his mustache with two forefingers, looking around the room with a bitter expression. \"God, Lisbon gives me the creeps. Forty thousand desperate people trying to get out of the net. I\u0027ve seen most of the faces in this room at our legation.\" Thurston turned to Slote. This isn\u0027t what you and I bargained for when we went to Foreign Service school.\" \u0027Bunky, you\u0027d better get rid of that Quaker conscience, or you really will crack up. Remember that it isn\u0027t us who\u0027s doing it. It\u0027s the Germans.\" \u0027Not entirely. I never thought much about our immigration laws until this thing started. They\u0027re pernicious and idiotic.\" Bunky Thurston drank again and coughed, empurpling his face. \u0027Forty thousand people. Forty thousand! Suppose we admitted them all? What difference would forty thousand people make, for God\u0027s sake, in the wastes of Montana or North Dakota? They\u0027d be a blessing!\" \"They wouldn\u0027t go there. They\u0027d huddle in the big cities, where there\u0027s still an unemployment problem.\" Thurston struck the table with a fist. \"Now don\u0027t you give me that stale drivel, Leslie. It\u0027s enough that I have to parrot it all day myself. They\u0027d go anywhere. You know that. They\u0027d sign papers to live out their lives in Death Valley. Our law\u0027s inhuman. Wasn\u0027t America started as a sanctuary from European oppression?\" Slote took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and glanced warily at the people nearest them, four elderly men arguing in French. \"Well, I\u0027m not going to defend the law, but how do you draw the line? Or do you have unrestricted immigration? Do you let in everybody who wants to come? You\u0027d empty southern and eastern Europe. They\u0027d flood our economy, starve, ferment, and boil up in a revolution. What about the Orientals? \\n\\n Do you break the dike to the west? In ten years the United States would be a big Chinese suburb.\" Natalie said with a gesture at the room, \"He\u0027s talking about these few people in Lisbon who have escaped from the Germans. that\u0027s all.\" \"Tried to escape,\" said T\u0027burston. \"The Germans can take Portugal overnight.\" \"And I\u0027m talking about the arguments that arise in Congress when You try to alter the law,\" Slote said, \"especially in favor of Jews. Nobody wants any more competition from them, they\u0027re too energetic and smart. That\u0027s the fact of it, Natalie, like it or not.\" \u0027We. could give refuge to all the Jews in Europe, all five million of them. We\u0027d only be a lot better off,\" Thurston said. \"Remember your Russian? Wealth is life,\" he said. And if that\u0027s a bit too simple, it\u0027s certainly true that wealth is brains.\" He leaned toward Natalie, lowering his voice. \u0027If you want to see the head of the Gestapo in Portugal, he\u0027s just walking in, and with him is the German ambassador. Charming man, the ambassador. My wife really likes him.\" Natalie stared. \"Is he the one with the scar?\" \"No, I don\u0027t know who that one is, though I\u0027ve seen him around. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s Gestapo too. The ambassador\u0027s the one in the gray suit.\" The three men sat not far from them, and the headwaiter fluttered and grinned eagerly, taking their orders. \"They look so ordinary,\" Natalie said. \"The Germans are quite ordinary,\" Slote said. \"It\u0027s a little scary, in fact, how much like Americans they are.\" Gloomily, Natalie said, \"Those people at the table next to them are obviously Jews. Drinking and laughing, side by side with the Gestapo. Eerie.\" Thurston said, \"I know them. They bought their way out of Belgium, and they still don\u0027t believe they can\u0027t buy their way into the United States. Most of the Jews here have been stripped penniless, but there are a handful of those. They\u0027re in the casino night after night, whooping it up. Fish in the net, jumping and flopping, still enjoying the water while they can.\" Thurston finished his drink, smoothed his mustache, and waved his glass at the waiter. \"I want another. I\u0027ve had some awful interviews today. Lisbon is a very sad and horrible place right now. My request for a transfer is in. The question is whether I\u0027ll wait. I may just quit the service. I\u0027ve never realized before how nice it is to have a wealthy Eather.\"Slote said to Natalie, \"Am I taking you to dinner?\" \u0027Please, I\u0027d love that.\" \u0027How about you, Bunky? Will you join us? Let\u0027s all go upstairs to my suite for a while. I want to change my shirt, and all that.\" \"No, I have a dinner appointment. I\u0027ll sit here and have my drink with Natalie. I left word for Bathurst to page me here.\" Slote stood up. \"Well, thanks for all you\u0027ve done.\" \"I can do wonders for people who don\u0027t need help.\" Slote told Natalie the number of his suite, and left. Later she found a pencilled note stuck in his doorjamb: N-door\u0027s open. She walked into a very large living room, looking out onto the purple sea beyond a long iron-railed balcony. Old heavy gilt and green furniture, gold cloth draperies, gilded mirrors, and large dark old paintings filled the room. Slote sang in a remote gushing shower. She yelled through an open bedroom door, \"Hey! I\u0027m here.\" The water shut off, and he soon appeared in a plaid robe, towelling his head. \"How about these digs? Fit for a rajah, what? The legation had it reserved for some petroleum big shot and he didn\u0027t show. I\u0027ve got it for a week.\" \u0027It\u0027s fine.\" She dropped heavily in a chair. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \u0027Bathurst finally called. Briny\u0027s sub has been re-routed to Gibraltar. It won\u0027t come to Lisbon at all. No explanation, that\u0027s just how it is.\" \"I see. Well, too bad. Maybe you can get to see him at Gibraltar.\" \"Thurston doesn\u0027t think so, but he\u0027s going to the British embassy tomorrow morning, first thing, to find out. He\u0027s being very kind. Especially since it\u0027s obvious he thinks I\u0027m a damned fool. No doubt you do, too. )P She looked up at him with a defiant scowl that was familiar and beguiling, took off her hat, and tossed her hair. \"What had you told him about Briny, anyway? And about me? He seemed to know quite a bit.\" \"Oh, we had too much wine one night and I cried on his shoulder about my tragic love life. I was very nice about Byron, I assure you, considering.\" bet. Say, this is quite a lay She said with a trace of malice, \"Yes, I\u0027ll out at that. It\u0027ll bankrupt you.\" \u0027Not in the few days I\u0027ll be here.\" \"Me, I\u0027ve dropped my bags in a flea trap back in town, sharing a room with a Poor old Jewish lady from Rotterdam, whose husband got pulled off the train in Paris. I haven\u0027t had a shower since Sunday.\"\"Look, why not mole in here? There\u0027s an extra room for a maid. I\u0027ll sleep in there. Look at that bed. A football field. It\u0027s yours.\" \"Nothing doing. Listen, Slote, if I can get to Gibraltar I\u0027ll marry Byron. That\u0027s what he wants.\" Slote, combing his hair at a mirror framed by trumpeting gilded cherubs, stopped and gave her a pained skeptical look. She went on nmously, \"I know it sounds harum-scarum and wild.\" Her eyes suddenly shone, and she laughed. \"But in point of fact, I want to do it myself.\" \"Well, I suppose I should congratulate you, Natalie. God knows I wish you well.\" \"Oh, I know you do, Slote. Don\u0027t bother telling me how bizarre this is. Some things are just inevitable. I love Byron.\" all \"Well, the place is at your disposal, anyway. They eat dinner late here. Take a shower.\" \"And climb into the same old underwear?\" Natalie shook her head, looking thoughtful. \"I noticed a shop downstairs. Let me see what Lisbon can offer a big heifer like me.\" ho SI She came back shortly, carrying a x and looking y. \"Did you mean that invitation? I bought a pile of stuff. Maybe it\u0027s my trousseau! A fast half hour of shopping. They had all these things from Seville, cheap and just Yummy. Byron\u0027s eyes will pop out of his head, if he ever shows up. \"Are you low on money now?\" \"My dear, I\u0027m still rolling in it. That\u0027s one thing about sitting on that Siena hill, with nothing to spend it on! Aaron pays me like clockwork and it just accumulates. Really, may I stay? I hate the idea of going back to town tonight. That poor old woman gives me the horrors.\" \u0027I said the place is yours.\" \"I can\u0027t register.\" \"Don\u0027t worry.\" \"All right.\" She paused at the bedroom door and turned, holding the box in both arms. Her intense dark glance shook the diplomat. \"People Wouldn\u0027t understand about us, would they, Slote?\" \"There\u0027s nothing to understand about me. You\u0027re the puzzle.\" \"You didn\u0027t used to think I was puzzling.\" \"I thought I had you figured out. I\u0027m paying a steep price for oversimplifying.\" \"You were an egotistical fool. I am very fond of you.\"\"Thanks, Jastrow. Go take your goddamned shower.\" Next morning a buzzing at the suite door woke Slote. Tying on a robe, he came yawning out of the tiny maid\u0027s room, and blinked. There in a blaze of sunshine sat Natalie in a dazzling white wool dress with a broad red gold-buckled belt, watching a waiter fuss over a breakfast on a wheeled table. \u0027Oh, hi,\" she said, smiling brightly and touching her carefully coiffed hair. \"I didn\u0027t know whether you wanted to get up. I ordered eggs for you, just in case. Everything\u0027s so cheap and plentiful here!\" \u0027I\u0027ll brush my teeth and join you. You\u0027re all spilled up! How long have you been awake?\" \u0027Hours and hours. I\u0027m supposed to wait for Byron in the bar here at eleven o\u0027clock today. That was the original plan.\" Slote rubbed his eyes and peered at her. \u0027What\u0027s the matter with you? His sub\u0027s enroute to Gibraltar.\" \u0027That\u0027s what that man Bathurst said. Suppose he\u0027s mistaken?\" \"Natalie, he\u0027s the naval attache.\" \u0027I know that.\" Shaking his head, Slote signed for the breakfast and left the room. Soon he returned in a shirt, slacks, and sandals, and found her eating with appetite. She grinned at him. \u0027Forgive me for being a pig, dear. What a difference sunlight makes, and coffee! I feel Marvelous.\" He sat down and cut into a ripe Spanish melon. \"Sweetie, do you honestly expect Byron Henry to materialize in the bar of this hotel at eleven o\u0027clock? Just on your sheer willpower?\" \"Well, Navy signals get crossed up like any others, don\u0027t they? I\u0027m going to be there.\" \u0027It\u0027s just irrational, but suit yourself.\" \u0027Do you like my dress? I bought it yesterday, right out of the window of that shop.\" \"Very becoming.\" She kept glancing at her watch. \"Well, wish me luck,\" she said at last, dropping her napkin on the table. \"I\u0027m off.\" \"Do you intend to sit in the bar all day, like patience on a monument?\" \"Don\u0027t be cross with me, Leslie.\" \"I\u0027m not. I\u0027d just like to plan the time.\" \"Well, obviously, if he hasn\u0027t showed by noon or thereabouts, the next thing is to find out how I get to Gibraltar.\" \"I\u0027ll call Bunky on that, and I\u0027ll come down at noon.\" \"Will you, please? Thanks, Leclie, thanks for everything. That bed\u0027s wonderful, I haven\u0027t slept so well in months.\" She could not quite keep the mischief out of her face as she said this and left with a nonchalantwave. Clearly, thought Slote, she was relishing his discomfiture. The tables were turned, and he had to endure it until he could Turn them again. He judged his chance was now at hand. Leslie Slote intended to take every possible advantage of this encounter. He could not understand Natalie\u0027s resolve to squander herself on Byron Henry. He had made a fearful mistake in his early treatment of this magnificent girl, and now he wanted to retrieve it. Slote knew how a divorced man must feel, finding himself thrown together with an ex-wife he still loved. Between them stood a barrier of old quarrels and new proprieties-it had effectively kept him out of the big bed last night-but beneath all that lay a deep bond. If it had not been for Natalie\u0027s fortuitous passion for the strange skinny Henry kid, he believed, they would by now be back together, very likely married. And he honestly thought he was more worthy of her and better suited to her. Natalie might thrash about here in Lisbon for a while, he calculated; her willpower was formidable; but Gibraltar was probably impossible to get to. She would have to go back to Italy. He would accompany her to Siena, pry Aaron Jastrow loose, and send them both home. If necessary he would wire Washington for a travel time extension. If he could not win Natalie back during all this, he sadly overestimated himself and the tie between them. He had been her first lover, after all. Slote believed that no woman ever really forgot the first man who had had her, ever got him quite out of her system. He finished his breakfast at leisure, then telephoned Thurston. \"Morning, Bunky- What did you find out about Natalie\u0027s going to Gibraltar?\" \"Forget it Les. That submarine\u0027s here.\" Slote had seldom heard worse news, but he suppressed any emotion in His voice. \"it is? How come?\" \"I don\u0027t know. It came in at dawn. It\u0027s tied up down at the river, near the customhouse.\" \"Then what on earth was Bathurst talking about?\" \"He\u0027s mighty puzzled and he\u0027s going down there later to talk to the skipper. That submarine had orders to go to Gibraltar.\" \"How long will it be berer\u0027 \"The origin al schedule called for three days.\" Thurston\u0027s voice turned uckish. \"Tough luck, Les. Fantastic girl. I\u0027d sweat out the three days and p then see.\" In self-defense Slote said calmly, \"Yes, she\u0027s all right, but she used to be a lot prettier.\" He dressed and hurried downstairs. In the dark bar there were only a handful of Germans, who turned suspicious faces to him. He went striding through the lobby. \u0027Here, Slote! Look behind you!\" Natalies voice rang like joyous bells. \\n\\n Half screened by potted palms, she sat on a green plush sofa with Byron. Before them on a coffee table, beside an open dispatch case, lay a pile of documents. The girl\u0027s cheeks flamed, her eyes were gleaming, her whole face brilliantly animated. Byron Henry jumped up to shake hands. He appeared just the same, even to the tweed jacket in which Slote had seen him for the first time slouched against a wall in Siena. Slote said, \"Well, hello there! Did Natalie tell you we had some very wrong information?\" Byron laughed. \"It wasp\u0027t wrong, exactly, but anyway, here we are.\" His glance swept the lobby. \"Say, this place has a queer smell of Berlin. Isn\u0027t it full of Germans?\" \"They swarm, darling. Don\u0027t say anything about anything.\" Excitedly shuffling the documents, Natalie pulled at Byron\u0027s hand. \"I can\u0027t find your certificate of residence.\" \"It\u0027s clipped with yours.\" Then he\u0027s got everything,\" Natalie exclaimed to Slote. \u0027Everything! All by the regulations, translated into Portuguese, notarized, and the notary seals authenticated by Portuguese consuls. The works.\" As Byron dropped beside her, she put her hand in his thick hair and gave his head a yank. \u0027I thought you were lousy at paperwork, you devil. How in God\u0027s name did you manage this?\" Slote said, \u0027Are you really sure everything\u0027s there? I\u0027ve never seen regulations as tough as these. Suppose I check that stuff over for you.\" -Oh, please, Leslie? Would you?\" Natalie said, making room on the sofa and handing him the documents and the sheet Thurston had given her. Red ink check marks ran down the side of the page. \u0027Homed you assemble all this?\" Slote said, starting to examine the papers. Byron explained that as soon as he had learned of the scheduled cruise to Lisbon, he had obtained an emergency four-day pass, and had flown to Washington to find out at the Portuguese embassy what the marriage regulations were. The naval attache there, Captain D\u0027Esaguy, had turned Out to be a friend of his from Berlin; the captain had been his tennis doubles partner for a while, playing against his father and the Swedish attachs. IYEsaguy had gone right to work. \"It\u0027s surprising what those fellows can accomplish in a few days when they want to,\" Byron said. \"I rounded up some of the papers, but the Portuguese consuls themselves did the hardest ones.\" \"That\u0027s the Foreign Service everywhere,\" said Slote, methodically turning over one paper after another and glancing at the check list. \\n\\n \"The wheels either Turn glacially, or so fast you can\u0027t see them whiz-well, Byron, I honestly think you, or this Portuguese navy captain, or both of you, did it. Everything seems to be here.\" \"What now?\" Natalie said. \"Will you marry me?\" Byron said, very solemnly. Natalie said, \u0027I sure will, by God.\" They burst out laughing. With a melancholy chuckle, Slote slipped the papers into the folder which Byron had labelled in neat red block letters: MMMIACIE. \"Suppose I telephone Tlurston and ask him what you do next? Tburstonjs my friend here in the legation, Byron.\" Byron Henry slowly, gratefully smiled, and Slote could not but see how appealing the smile was. \"Thanks a lot. Will you? I\u0027m not thinking too clearly at the moment.)P \"No? On the whole, I\u0027d say you\u0027re doing all right.\" Returning a few minutes later, he saw them holding hands on the sofa, looking adoringly at each other and both talking at once. He hesitated, then approached them. \"Sorry. Problems.\" Natalie looked up at him, startled and frowning. \"What now?\" \"Well, Bunky\u0027s bowled over by what you\u0027ve done, Byron, just impressed as hell. He\u0027s at your service and wants to help. But he doesn\u0027t know what he can do about that twelve-day requirement for posting bonds. Then there\u0027s the Foreign Office\u0027s authentication of the consuls\u0027 signatures. He says that usually takes a week. So-\" Slote shrugged, and dropped the folder on the table. \"Right, D\u0027Esaguy mentioned both those points,\" Byron said. \"He thought they could be gotten around. I stopped off at the navy ministry on the way here this morning and gave his uncle a letter. His uncle\u0027s a commodore, or something. He was awfully nice to me, but he only speaks Portuguese. I think he\u0027s working on those snags. I\u0027m supposed to go back to the ministry at one o\u0027clock. Could Mr. Thurston meet us there? That might be a real help.\" Slote looked from Byron to Natalie, whose mouth was twitching with amusement. She still held Byron\u0027s hand in her lap. \u0027I\u0027ll call back and ask him. You\u0027ve certainly been forehanded.\" \"Well, I sort of wanted this to come off.\" With some stupefaction, Bunkey Thurston agreed over the telephone to meet them at the navy building at one. \"Say, Leslie, I thought you called this ensign of hers a sluggard and a featherhead. He\u0027s organized this thing like a blitzkrieg.\" \u0027Surprised me.\" \"You have my sympathies.\" \"Oh, shut up, Bunky. I\u0027ll see you at one.\" \"You\u0027re coming too?\"\"Yes, oh yes. \"You\u0027re a glutton for punishment.\" A tall man in Navy dress blues leaned on the fender of an automobile outside the hotel, smoking a very black, very fat cigar. \"Hey, Briny! Is the exercise on?\" \u0027It\u0027s on.\" Byron introduced him to atalie and Slote as Lieutenant Aster, his executive officer. Aster took in the girl with a keen, rather greedy glance of pale small blue eyes. He was broader and heavier than Byron, with thick wavy blond hair growing to a peak on his forehead, and a long face that looked genial because the corners of his mouth turned upBut it was a tight tough mouth. \u0027Say, Natalie, that picture of you that Briny keeps mooning over doesn\u0027t do you justice. Hop in, everybody. I phoned the skipper, Briny, and told him you\u0027d made contact. You\u0027re off the watch list while we\u0027re here.\" \u0027Great, Lady. Thanks.\" Not sure she had heard this right, Natalie said, \"Lady?\" The executive officer\u0027s smile was a bit weary. \u0027That happened to me in my plebe year at the Academy. With a name like Aster, I guess it had to. My name\u0027s Carter, Natalie, and by all means use it.\" Driving into the city, the two submariners described how the S-45, a hundred fifty miles out of Lisbon, had in fact been ordered to Gibraltar. The captain, who knew about Byron\u0027s plans, had expressed his regrets but altered course to the south. Within an hour reports came in to the captain that the number two main engine was down, the forward battery was throwing off excessive hydrogen, an evaporator had salted up, and a general plague of malfunctions was breaking out in the old boat, necessitating an emergency call in Lisbon for two or three days of alongside repairs. Aster, who brought in the reports, gave his opinion, which was backed by the Chief of the Boat, that it might be hazardous to proceed to Gibraltar. All this was done with a straight face, and with a straight face the captain accepted the executive officer\u0027s recommendation and turned back to Lisbon. \"How can you possibly get away with that?\" said Slote. \"Won\u0027t you all be court-martialled?\" \"Nobody was lying,-Aster said with an innocent smile. t4 We have the engine records to prove it. These old S-boats just gasp and flounder along, and at practically any moment you could justify an order to abandon ship. ming into sbon COLd was highly commendable prudence.\" Natalie said to BYron, \"And you submerge in an old wreck like that?\" \"NVell, the S-45 has made four thousand, seven hundred and twenty-three dives, Natalie. Itshould be good for a few more.\" \"Diving is nothing,\" said Lady Aster. (\u0027You pull the plug and she goes down; you blow air and she pops up. It\u0027s going from one place to another that\u0027s kind of a strain on the old hulk. But we manage. By the way, everybody\u0027s invited aboard after the ceremony.\" tm Me? On a submarine?\") Natalie tucked her skirt close around her ghs. \u0027The captain wants to congratulate you. He was pretty nice about coming in to Lisbon, you know.\" \"We\u0027ll see,\" Natalie said. \u0027Slote! Are you trying to maim us all?\" \"Sorry, that truck came out rut of nowhere,)\u0027 said Slote, pulling the car back on the bumpy road. He was driving too fast. Henry shaking hands in the sunshine outside the navy minist , Bunker \u0027Thurston gave Ensign Henry a prolonged curious scrutiny. \u0027I\u0027m glad to meet a fellow with such a knack for getting things done.\" \"This thing\u0027s not done yet, by a long shot, sir. Thanks for offering to help out.\" \"Well, come along, and let\u0027s see what happens. You\u0027ve got some strong pull on your side. D\u0027Esaguy seems to be something like a deputy chief of naval operations.\" Judging by the number of anterooms and armed guards outside his office, the size of the room, the magnificence of the furniture, and the effulgence of his gold braid and combat ribbons, D\u0027Esaguy certainly held some exalted post. He was a short dark man, with an elongated stern Lati, face, and heavy hair graying at the sides. He held himself, and shook hands, and gestured as he welcomed them, with noble grace; and to Natalie he made a deep bow, his black eyes showing a spark of admiration. He turned businesslike and rattled rapidly to Thurston in Portuguese. -He says these things take time,\" Thurston reported. \"He would like to invite us all to lunch.\" Byron glanced at Natalie, and said, \"That\u0027s very cordial of him. Does he know we only have three days?\" \"I\u0027m not sure you ought to press him,\" Thurston muttered. \"Please tell him what I said.\" \u0027Okay.\" The Portuguese officer listened gravely to Thurston. His eyes were on Byron. A wrinkle of his mouth, a flash of fun in the sombre face, acknowledged the impatience of a young lover. He turned and rapped an order to an assistant only slightly less crusted with gold braid thanhimself, who sat at a small desk. The assistant jumped up and went out. After a minute of heavy silence he returned with a bouquet of red roses. He gave these to D\u0027Esaguy, who handed them to Natalie Jastrow with a bow and a few charmingly spoken words. Thurston translated, \"The dew will not dry on these roses before you are married.\" \"Good God. How beautiful. Thank you!\" Natalie\u0027s voice trembled. She stood holding the roses, looking around at the men, blushing. \"You know, I\u0027m beginning to believe it! For the very first time.\" \"The exercise is on, lady,\" said Lieutenant Aster. \"Cancel now, if you\u0027re ever going to.\" \"Cancel?\" She took Byron\u0027s arm. \"Nonsense. Commence firing!\" \"Hey, a Navy wife,\" said Lieutenant Aster. D\u0027Esaguy, trying alertly to follow this chatter, asked Thurston to translate. He burst out laughing, took Natalie\u0027s hand, and kissed it. \"Come,\" he said in English. \"A leetle luncheon.\" The lunch was long and excellent, in a restaurant with a lordly view, much like a San Francisco panorama, of the Lisbon hills and the broad sparkling river. The conunodore seemed in no hurry at all. Thurston kept checking his watch, knowing that most government offices would shut by four-thirty or five. At three D\u0027Esaguy said casually that perhaps they might see now how the little business was coming along. In an enormous black Mercedes limousine they commenced a whirling tour of office buildings. Thurston tried to explain what was happening, but after a while he gave up, because he wasn\u0027t sure. Sometimes the commodore descended for a few minutes by himself, sometimes he took the couple along to sign a ledger or a document, with \u0027Thurston accompanying them. An official invariably waited at the door to greet them and to lead them past crowded anterooms into dusty old inner offices, where fat pallid old d\u0026 partment heads got awkwardly out of their chairs to bow to D\u0027EsaguyAbout two hours later they arrived at an office familiar to Thurston, where civil marriages were registered. It was closed for the day and the blinds were drawn. As the black limousine came to a stop, one blind went up and the door opened. A huge old woman in a brown smock, with visible chin whiskers, led them through dark empty rooms to an inner office where a chandelier blazed. At an ancient desk, fussing with papers, sat a dark frog-faced man with gold-rimmed glasses, several gold teeth, and three thick gold rings. He smiled at them and spoke to Thurston in Portuguese. \\n\\n Thurston translated his questions; the man scratched with a blotchy pen on many of Byron\u0027s documents and kept stamping them. Natalie, Byron, and the two witnesses-Aster and Slote-signed and signed. After a while the man stood, and with a lewd gold-flecked smile held out his hand to Natalie and then to Byron, saying brokenly, \u0027Good luck for you.\" \"What\u0027s this now?\" Natalie said. \u0027y, you\u0027re married,\" \u0027Thurston said. \"Congratulations.\" \u0027We are? Already? When did we get married? I missed it.\" \"At one point there, where you both signed the green book. That was it.\" \"I haven\u0027t the faintest recollection.\" Byron said, \"Nor have I. However, I\u0027ll take your word for it. Let\u0027s have that ring, Lady.\" Aster put it in his hand. He slipped the yellow band on Natalie\u0027s finger, swept her into his arms, and kissed her. Meantime Thurston told D\u0027Esaguy how -the couple had missed the moment of marriage, and the Portuguese officer laughed. He laughed again when Thurston explained the American custom of kissing the bride. Natalie said that D\u0027Esaguy must kiss her first. With marked pleasure, the old aristocrat executed the privilege on her lips. Then he left, after cour y handshakes all around, as Byron gathered up his sheaf of documents and paid the fees. Slote was the last to kiss her. Natalie hesitated, looking into his eyes, and said, \"Well, old Slote, I seem to have done it, don\u0027t I? Wish me well.\" \"Oh, I do, I do, Jastrow. You know that. She gave him a cool brief on the mouth, putting her free hand on his neck. When they emerged into the late golden sunshine, the black limousine was gone. The office door closed behind them and Slote felt something loose and grainy thrust in his hand. It was rice. Lieutenant Aster grinned a strange cold thin-lipped grin at him and winked a sharp blue eYe-At a signal from Aster, the three men pelted the couple. Natalie, brushing rice from her dress, wiped her eyes with a knuckle. \"Well, that certainly makes it official! Now what happens?\" \"if you don\u0027t know,\" said Lady Aster, \"Byron\u0027s got a lot of fast explaining to do.\"Natalie choked and turned brick red. \"My God, Briny, who is this character?\" \"Lady\u0027s spent too much time submerged,\" said Byron. \"He has trouble raising his mind to sea level.\" \u0027Marriage is holy and beautiful,\" said Lady Aster. \"But before you hop to it, how about visiting the old S-45 for a minute? The skipper\u0027s sort of expecting us.\" \"Of course, of course,\" Natalie said hurriedly. \"I want to see the S45-I\u0027m dying to. By all means.\" \"Have you any idea where you\u0027ll go after that?\" Leslie Slote dryly put in. Byron said, \"Well, I figured there\u0027d be a place-a hotel, something.\" \u0027Lisbon\u0027s jammed to bursting,\" said Slote. \"My God, so it is. I never gave it a thought,\" Natalie said. \u0027y not take my place?\" said Leslie Slote. \"That\u0027s suite, if ever I saw one.\" Natalie looked very surprised and glanced at Byron. of you, Siote, but I wouldn\u0027t dream of it.\" \"We\u0027ll find something,\" Byron said, shaking his head. \u0027Oh, but his place is out of the Arabian Nights,\" said Natalie, adding very casually, \u0027I had a drink there last night. Would you do such a thing for us, old Slote?\" \u0027Leslie can stay with me,\" Thurston said. \"No problem at all. Pick me up at the legation, Les. I have to rush there now.\" \"It\u0027s all set,\" said Slote. \"Mile you two visit the submarine, I\u0027ll go to the hotel and dear out.\" \"Bless you. Thank you. My bags,\" said Natalie distractedly, \"they\u0027re in Mrs. Rosen\u0027s room. Maybe I should get them! No, I have things to throw in. I\u0027ll get \u0027em later. Thanks, Slote. And you too, Bunky. Thanks for everything.\" Slote signalled at a passing taxicab. \"Good luck.\" Natalie was astonished at the small size of the submarine, at its ugliness, and at its rustiness. \"Good heavens!\" she shouted over the clanks and squeals of the crane moving overhead, as they got out of the cab. \"Is that the S-45? Briny, honestly, don\u0027t you get claustrophobia when you dive in that thing?\" \"He\u0027s never stayed awake long enough to find out,\" said Aster. They a honeymoon \"That\u0027s sweet were walking toward a gangway that was only a couple of planks nailed together. Sailors lounged on the low Hat black forecastle, staring at the girl in white with an armful ofroses. \"One day when we\u0027re submerged he\u0027ll open his eyes and begin screaming.\" (11 don\u0027t mind anything but the low company,\" said Byron, \"and the body odors. It\u0027s especially marked among the senior officers. when I sleep I don\u0027t notice it.\" A young tousle-headed sailor at the gangway, wearing a gun slung low on his hip, saluted Aster, gave Natalie a yearning respectful glance, and said, \"Capon wants you-all to wait for him on the dock, sir.\" \"Very well.\" Soon a figure in a blue uniform, with the gold stripes of a lieutenant, emerged from the rust-streaked black sail-the housing that rose amidships over the conning tower-and crossed the gangplank to the dock. The captain was shaped rather like his submarine, clumsily thick in the middle and tapering abruptly to either end. He had big browm eyes, a broad nose, and a surprisingly boyish face. \"Captain Caruso, this is my wife,\" said Byron, jolting Natalie with the word. Caruso took her hand in a white fat Paw. \"Well, congratulations! Byron\u0027s a good lad, in his short conscious intervals.\" \"DO You really sleep that much?\" Natalie laughed at Byron. it ic It\u0027s pure slander. I seldom close my eyes on this boat,\" said Byron, except to meditate on my folly in going to sub school. That I admit I do very frequently.\" \"Eighteen hours at a stretch, he can meditate,\" said Aster. \"That\u0027s solid gold meditating.\" Two sailors in dungarees came up out of an open hatch on the forecastle and crossed the gangway, one carrying a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket, the other a tray of water glasses. here we go. Navy Regs don\u0027t allow us to consume spirituous liquors on board, M. Hen \" d e captain, and again she felt the lit rs rY said ai the joyous jolt. He popped the cork and ceremoniously ur as the ilor poured sa held out one glass after another. \"To your happiness,\" he shouted, as the crane went by overhead with a wild clanging. \"To You, God bless you,\" yelled Natalie, \"for bringing men here.\" \u0027To number two engine,\" bellowed Lady Aster, \"to the evaporators, the exhaust system, and theforward battery. Never has there been such I massive breakdown on a naval vessel.\" Byron silently lifted his glass to his captain and executive officer. They drank. The crane rumbled away. \"Captain,\" said Lady Aster, as Caruso refilled the glasses, \"do you think that picture in Byron\u0027s room does Natalie justice?\" \"Not in the least,\" said the captain, looking at her with liquid womanloving Italian eyes. \u0027It doesn\u0027t begin to.\" ually seen he u nlaes how I feel. Now that you\u0027ve act r, sir, don\u0027t you at least five agree with me that what has to be done in Lisbon may take days?\" \"Three,\" snapped Captain Caruso, the dreamy look vanishing. \"Exactly seventy-two hours.\" \"Aye aye, sir.\" \u0027And you\u0027d better produce some damned convincing malfunction reports, Lady.\" The captain tossed off his wine and smiled at Natalie. \"Now, can I offer you the hospitality of the boat for a little while?\" She followed the officers into the rusty sail and down a hatch. The ladder was cold and greasy, with narrow slippery rungs hat caught at Natalie\u0027s high heels. She had to lower herself through a second round hatch and down another ladder into a tiny room full of machinery, strongly conscious of her exposed legs and glad that they were pretty and that her skirt was narrow. \"This is the control room,\" Byron said, helping her down. \"Up above was the conning tower.\" Natalie looked around at solemn-faced sailors in dungarees, and at the valves, knobs, dials, handles, big wheels, twisted cables, and panels of lights fining all the green-painted bulkheads. Despite a humming exhaust blower, the close, warm air smelled sourly of machinery, cooking, old cigars, and unwashed men. \"Briny, do you really know what all these things are?\" \u0027He\u0027s learning,\" said Lady Aster. \"Between hibernations.\" They stepped through an open watertight door to the tiny wardroom, where Natalie met two more young officers. On the table stood a heartshaped white cake, iced in blue with a submarine, cupids, and Mr. and Mrs. Byron Henry. She squeezed herself into the place of honor at the head of the table, opposite the captain. Byron and Lady Aster sat crouched against the bulkhead, to avoid a bunk folded back over their heads. Somebody produced a sword, Natalie cut up the cake, and the captain sent what was left to the crew\u0027s quarters. The two glasses of champagne were going to Natalie\u0027s head. She was halfdizzy anyway from the rush of events and the longing that blazed at her from the young men\u0027s eyes. Over the coffee and cake she laughed and laughed at Lady Aster\u0027s jokes, and decided that the old submarine, for all its cramped squalor, its reek of machine and mazes, was a mighty jolly vessel. Byron looked more desirable to her by the minute, and she kissed him often. Before they left the S-45, Byron took his bride to a tiny cabin and showed her the narrow black aperture near it(he deck, beneath two other bunks, where he slept. \u0027I ask you,\" he said, would anybody spend extra time in that morgue slot through choice?\" \"The alternative might be more frightful,\" said Lady Aster, over Natalie\u0027s shoulder. \"Like staying awake.when Natalie and BYron came out on deck into cool fresh air, crewmen on the forecastle waved and cheered. Natalie waved back and some bold sailors whistled. The taxicab, called by the gangway watch for them, started off with a great clatter. The driver jammed his brakes, jumped out, and Natalie and Byron heard him cursing in Portuguese(on) as he threw aside shoes and tin cans.(soon) The crew laughed and yelled until the cab drove away, \"I daresay poor Slote\u0027s left the hotel by now.\" Natalie snuggled against her husband, \u0027We\u0027ll collect my bags and go there, right? Wait till you see it. It was terrible of me to jump at it like that, but honestly, Briny, it\u0027s the royal suite.\" In Natalie\u0027s room, in a boardinghouse on a side street, an old woman snored in an iron bed. \"Well Slote\u0027s place must be better than this, \" Byron whispered, glancing at the cracked ceiling and at the roaches on the peeling wallpaper, scurrying to hide from the electric light. Natalie swiftly gathered her things and left a note with her key on the table. At the door she turned to look at Mrs. Rosen, lying on her back, jaw hanging open, gray hair tumbled on the pillow. What kind of wedding night had Mrs. Rosen had, she thought, with the husband whose silver-framed face smiled brownly on her bedside table, her one memento of the wretched man dragged off a French train by Germans? Natalie shivered and closed the door. The desk clerk at the Palace Hotel evidently had been informed and tipped by Slote, for he yielded up the key to Byron with a greasy grin. The newlyweds had to give him their passports. Natalie felt a touch of fear, handing over the maroon American booklet that set her off from Lisbon\u0027s forty thousand other Jews. \"I just thought of something,\" she said in the elevator. \"How did you register?\" \"Mr. and Mrs naturally. Big thrill.\" \"I\u0027m still Natalie Jastrow on that passport.\" \"So you are.\" The elevator stopped. He took her arm. \"I wouldn\u0027t worry about it.\" \"But maybe you should go back and explain.\" \"Let them ask a question first.\"As the bellboy opened the door to the suite, Natalie felt herself whisked off her feet. \"Oh, Byron, stop this nonsense. I\u0027m monstrously heavy. You\u0027ll slip a disk.\" But she clung to his neck with one hand and clutched her skirt with the other, excited by his surprising lean strength. \"Hey!\" he said, carrying her inside, \"I see what you meant. Royal suite is right.\" When he put her down she darted ahead into the bedroom. Natalie had a slight nag of worry about the negligee she had left hanging in Slote\u0027s bathroom, and the new sexy underwear in a bureau drawer. It might take some explaining! But all the stuff was gone-here, she had no idea. She was puzzling over this when Byron appeared in the french window of the bedroom, on the balcony. \"This is great out here, all right. Cold as hell, though. Fabulous string of lights along the water. Did you notice the champagne? And the lilies?\" \u0027Lilies?\" \"In there.\" In a corner of the living room, beside champagne in a silver cooler on a marble table, stood a bouquet of red and white calla lilies, and beside them Slote\u0027s small white card, with no writing. The doorbell rang: A bellboy gave Natdlie a box from the lingerie shop. She hurried into the bedroom and opened it. There lay the underclothes Slote had cleared Out, a many-colored froth of silk and lace. \"What\u0027s that?\" Byron said from the balcony. \u0027Oh, some stuff I bought in a lobby shop,\" Natalie said airily. \"I guess Slote told them I\u0027d be here.\" She picked up a peach nightgown, and with mock witchery draped it against her bosom. \"Not bad for an academic type, hey?\" Then she saw a note in Slote\u0027s handwriting, lying under the sill. Byron started to come in. She ran for the french door and shut it on him. \"Give me a minute. Open the champagne.\" The note read: Wear the gray, jas-trow. You always looked angelic in gray. Confidential communication, to be destroyed. Yours till death. S. The words brought a mist to Natalie\u0027s eyes. She tore the note to bits and dropped them in a wastebasket. In the next room she heard a cork pop. She pulled from the box the gray silk nightdress laced and trimmed in black, and quite forgot Leslie Slote, as she speedily showered and perfumed herself. She emerged from the bedroom brushing her long black hair down onher shoulders. Byron seized her.... ... Wine, lilies, and roses; the dark sea rolling beyond the windows under a round moon; young lovers separated for half a year, joined on a knife-edge of geography between war and peace, suddenly married, far from home; isolated, making love on a broad hospitable bed, performing secret rites as old as time, but forever fresh and sweet between young lovers, the best moments human existence offers-such was their wedding night. The human predicament sometimes seems a gloomy tapestry with an indistinct, baffling design that 5mrIs around and inward to brilliant naked lovers. The Bible starts with this centerpiece. Most of the old stories end with the lovers married, retiring to their sacred nakedness. But for Byron and Natalie, their story was just beginning. The lavish pulses and streams of love died into the warm deep sleep of exhausted lovers: Mr. and Mrs. Byron Henry, Americans, slumbering in wedlock in the Palace Hotel outside Lisbon, on a January night of 1941, one of the more than two thousand nights of the Second World War, when so much of mankind slept so badly. ATALM opened her eyes, awakened by the warbling and chirping of birds. Byron sat beside her, smoking. A cool breeze was blowing from an open door to the balcony. In a pink-streaked sky, the wan moon and one star hung low over the choppy sea. \"Hi. Listen to those birds! How long have you been awake, Byron?\" \"Not long, but I\u0027m really wide awake. Wide awake and still trying to believe it.\" She sat up. The bedclothes slipped from her breasts as she kissed him softly, sighing with satiated pleasure. \"Gosh, that air\u0027s icy, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I can close the door.\" \"No, no, the sea smell is lovely.\" She pulled the blanket to her neck, nestling beside him. After a silence she said, \"Byron, how does a submarine work?\" He glanced down at her. His arm was around her, caressing her shoulder. \"Are you kidding?\" \"No. Is it hard to explain?\" Not at all, but why talk about that?\" \"Because I want to know.\" \"Well, it\u0027s a hell of a topic to take up with a beautiful naked girl, but okay. I\u0027ll tell you how a submarine works. To begin with, it\u0027s built so that it just about floats when ballasted. So when you flood the diving tanks with a few tons of seawater you go right down, and when you blow the water out with compressed air, you pop up again. You begin with marginal buoyancy, and by changing the water ballast you become a rock or a cork as desired. That\u0027s the general idea. The details are numerous and dull.\"\"Well, is it safe? How much have I got to worry about?\" \"Less than if I were a New York traffic cop.\" \"You get hazardous duty pay.\" \"That\u0027s because civilians, like congressmen and you, yourself, have the illusion that it\u0027s scary and risky to dive a boat under the water. No submariner will ever argue Congress out of that.\" \"But when you go deep, isn\u0027t there quite a risk of being crushed?\" \u0027No. A sub\u0027s just a long watertight steel tube, braced to hold off sea pressure. That\u0027s the inner bull, the pressure hull. it\u0027s the real ship. The outside that you see is just a skin for tanks, open at the bottom. The water sloshes in and out. The inner hull has a test pressure depth. You never submerge near that. Nobody to this day knows how deep the old S-45 can go. We ride on a thick cushion of safety.\" \"Submarines have been lost.\" \"So have ocean liners and sailing yachts. when men are trapped in a bull on the ocean bottom, tapping out Morse code, it makes a good story, but it\u0027s only happened a couple of times. Even then there are ways of escaping, and we\u0027re all trained in them.\" \"But when you Hood the boat to go down, can\u0027t the Hooding get out of hand? Don\u0027t mile, darling. It\u0027s all a mystery to somebody like me. \u0027I smile because you ask good questions. But as I told you, the main tanks are outside the real hull. They\u0027re just stuck on. When they Hood, you\u0027re awash, waterlogged. For diving there\u0027s a small sealed tank inside, the negative tank. It can hold about twelve tons of sea water. Flood negative and down you go fast. When you\u0027re at the depth you want, you blow negative, and there you are, hanging. You spread your bow planes, and you\u0027re sort of like a fat airplane, flying slowly through thick air. Submanners are picked men, and great guys, darling, and all seventy-five of them dearly want nothing to go wrong! There are no slobs on a submarine. That\u0027s the truth about submarines, and this is one peculiar conversation to be having in I bed with a new wife.\" Natalie yawned. \"You\u0027re making me feel better. That rusty little boat scared me.\" \"The new fleet submarines are luxury liners compared to the S-45,\" Byron said. \u0027I\u0027ll go to one of those next.\" She yawned again, as a patch of pink light appeared on the wall. \"Bless my soul, is that the sun? Where did the night go? Draw the curtains.\" Byron walked naked to the windows and closed the heavy draperiesAs he returned to her in the gloom, she thought with piercing pleasure how handsome he was-a sculptured male figurealive, warm, and brown. He settled de her. She leaned over him and gave him a kiss. When the young husband strongly pulled her close she pretended for a moment to fight him off, but she couldn\u0027t choke down her welling joyous laughter. As the sun rose outside the screening curtains on another day of war, Byron and Natalie Henry went back to lovemaking. They breakfasted at noon in the sunny sitting room, where the air was heavy with the scent of roses. Their breakfast was oysters, steak, and red wine; Natalie ordered it, saying it was precisely what she wanted, and Byron called it a perfect menu. They ate in dressing gowns, not talking much, looking deep in each other\u0027s eyes, sometimes laughing at a foolish word or at nothing at all. They were radiant with shared, gratified desire. Then she said, \"Byron, exactly how much time do we have?\" \"well, seventy-two hours from the time we came alongside would be half past two, Thursday.\" Some of the pure gladness in her eyes dimmed. \"When. That soon? Short honeymoon.\" \"This isn\u0027t our honeymoon. I\u0027m entitled to twenty days\u0027 leave. I reported straight to the S-45 from sub school. I\u0027ll take those twenty days once you\u0027re back home. When will that be?\" She leaned her head on her hand. \"Oh, dear. Must I start thinking?\" \"Look, Natalie. Why not send Aaron a wire that we\u0027re married, and go straight home?\" \"I can\u0027t do that.\" \"I don\u0027t want you going back to Italy.\" Natalie raised her eyebrows at his flat tone. \"But I have to.\" \"No, you don\u0027t. Aaron\u0027s too cute,\" Byron said. \"Here, let\u0027s finish this wine. As long as you or I or somebody will do the correspondence and dig in the library and keep after the kitchen, the gardeners, and the plumbers, he won\u0027t leave that house. It\u0027s that simple. He loves it, and he doesn\u0027t scare easily. He\u0027s a tough little bird, Uncle Aaron, under the helplessness and the head colds. What do you suppose he\u0027d do if you sent him that wire?\" Natalie hesitated, \"Try to get me to change my mind. If that failed, make a real effort to leave.\" \"Then it\u0027s the best favor you can do him.\" \"No. He\u0027d make a mess of it. He\u0027s not good with officials, and the stupider they are the worse he gets. He could really trap himself. Leslie Slote and I together can get him on his way in short order, and this time we\u0027ll \u0026 it.\" \"Slote? Slote\u0027s enroute to Moscow.\"\"He\u0027s offered to stop off in Rome and Siena first. He\u0027s very devoted to Aaron.\" \"I know who he\u0027s devoted to.\" Natalie said softly with a poignant look, \"Jealous of Leslie Slote, Briny?\" \"All right. Sixty days.\" \"What, dear?\" \"Co back there for two months. No more. That should be plenty. If Aaron\u0027s not out by April first or before, it\u0027ll be his own doing, and you come home. Book your own transportation, right now.\" Natalie\u0027s wide mouth curved wryly. \u0027I see. Are you giving me orders, Byron?\" \"Yes.) She rested her chin on her palm, contemplating him with surprised eyes \"You know, that feels pretty good being ordered around. I can\u0027t say why. Possibly the delicious novelty will wear off. Anyway, lord and master, I\u0027ll do as you say. Sixty days.\" \"All right,\" Byron said. \"Let\u0027s get dressed and see Lisbon.\" \"I\u0027ve seen Lisbon,\" said Natalie, \"but I\u0027m all in favor of coming up for air.\" Dropping the key at the desk, Byron asked for their orts. With a heavy-lidded look, the swarthy short clerk disappeared through a door. \"Look at those fellows,\" Byron said. Half a dozen Germans, in belted black raincoats despite the sunshine, were talking together near the lobby entrance, looking hard at everybody who came in and went out. \u0027They might as well be wearing boots and swastikas. what is it about them? Those raincoats? The big brims on the hats? The bronze sunburns? How do they find time for sunbathing?\" \"I recognize them with the back of my neck. It crawls,\" Natalie said. The desk clerk emerged from the door, busily shuffling papers. \"Sorry, Passports not ready yet.\" \"I need mine!\" Natalie\u0027s tone was strident. The clerk barely lifted his eyes at her. \"Maybe this afternoon, madame,\" he said, turning his back. After the languors of the bedroom, the cold sunny outdoors felt bracing. Byron hired a tad to drive them into and around Lisbon. The city was no Rome or Paris for sights, but the rows of pastel-colored housesgreen, pink, blue-perched along the hills above a broad river made a PrettY picture. Byron enjoyed himself, and he thought his bride was having fun too; she clung to his arm and smiled, saying little. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1587/47201.html","bookId":1254,"book":{"id":1254,"title":"The Winds of War 战争风云","description":"简介： 《战争风云》是小说，书中关于亨利一家的人物和事迹纯属虚构。但小说中有关战争的史实是确凿的；统计数字是可靠的；那些大人物的言行要不是根据史实，便是根据可靠的记载。象这样范围的工作不可能没有错误，但作者希望读者们能看出，他是在尽很大的努力给一次大规模的世...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/24/13-38-35-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1587","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
