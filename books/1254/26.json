{"id":43128,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"It\u0027s a disaster. Cheers.\" \"Cheers. Yes, and it\u0027s your disaster. This is a contest now between Germany and the United States. If you lose, God help you and all mankind. We were too slow, too stupid, and too late. But in the end we did our best. You\u0027re doing nothing, in the last running.\" He swallowed his drink and pulled himself to his feet. \"We expected more from the United States Navy, anyhow. I\u0027ll tell you that.\" \"The United States Navy is ready,\" Pug shot back. \"I\u0027ve been working like a bastard all day on a general operation order for convoy. When I saw those headlines, it was like my desk blowing up in my face.\" \"Good God, man, can I say that? Can I say that the Navy, before this press conference, was preparing to start convoying?\" \"Are you crazy? I\u0027ll shoot you if you do.\" \"I don\u0027t have to quote you. Please.\" Pug shook his head. \"Can I say your Navy is ready to go over to convoy on a twenty-four hours\u0027 notice? Is that true?\" \u0027y, of course it\u0027s true. We\u0027re out there now. We\u0027ve got the depth charges on ready. All we have to do is uncover and train out the guns.\" Tudsbury\u0027s bulging eyes were alive now and agleam. \"Pug, I want to say that.\" \"Say what?\" \"That the United States Navy is ready to go over to convoy and expects to do it soon.\" Pug hesitated only a second or two. \"Oh, what the hell. Sure, say it! You can hear that from anybody in the service from C.N.O down. Who doesn\u0027t know that?\" \"The British, that\u0027s who. You\u0027ve saved me.\" Tudsbury rounded on his daughter. \"And you told me not to telephone him, you stupid baggage! Blazes, I\u0027m late.\" The fat man lumbered out. Pug said to Pamela, \"That isn\u0027t news.\" \"Oh, he has to work himself up. He\u0027ll make it sound like something. He\u0027s rather clutching at straws.\" She sat with her back to the window. The sun in her brown hair made an aureole around herpallid sad face. \"Why did you tell him not to phone me?\" She looked embarrassed. \"I know how hard you\u0027re working.\" \"Not that hard.\" \"I meant to ring you before I left.\" She glanced down at her intertwined fingers, and reached him a mimeographed document from the coffee table. \"Have you seen this?\" It was the British War Office\u0027s instructions to civilians for dealing with German invaders. Pug said, leafing through it, \u0027I read a lot of this stuff last fall. It\u0027s pretty nightmarish, when you start picturing the Germans driving through Kent and marching up Trafalgar Square. It won\u0027t happen, though.\" \"Are you sure? After that press conference?\" Pug turned up both hands. Pamela said, \"They\u0027ve updated that manual since last year. It\u0027s calmer, and a lot more realistic. And therefore somehow more depressing. I can just see it all happening. After Crete, I really do think it may.\" \"You\u0027re brave to go back, then.\" \"Not in the least. I can\u0027t stand it here. I choke on your steaks and your ice cream. I feel so bloody guilty.\" Pamela wrung her fingers in her lap. \"I just can\u0027t wait to go. There\u0027s this girl in the office-would you like another drink? no?-well, the fool\u0027s gone dotty over a married man. An American. And she has a fiance in the R.A.F. She has nobody to talk to. She pours it all out to me. I have to live with all this maudlin agonizing, day in, day out. It\u0027s wearing me down.\" \"What does this American do?\" \"That would be telling.\" With a little twist of her mouth she added, \"He\u0027s a civilian. I can\u0027t imagine what she sees in him. I once met him. A big thin flabby chap with glasses, a paunch, and a high giggle.\" They sat in silence. Pug rattled the ice in his glas,-, round and round. \"Funny, there\u0027s this fellow I know,\" he spoke up. \"Navy fellow. Take him, now. He\u0027s been married for a quarter of a century, fine grown family, all that. Well, over in Europe he ran into this girl. On the boat actually, and a few times after that. He can\u0027t get her out of his mind. He never does anything about it. His wife is all right, there\u0027s nothing wrong with her. Still, he keeps dreaming about this girl. All he does is dream. He wouldn\u0027t hurt His wife for the world. \n He loves his grown kids. Look at him, and you\u0027d call him the soberest of sober citizens. He has never had anything to do with another woman since he got married. He wouldn p t know how to go about it, and isn\u0027t about to try. And that\u0027s the story of this fellow. Just as silly as this girlfriend of yours, except that he doesn\u0027t talk about it. There are millions of such people.\" Pamela Tudsbury said, \"A naval officer, you say?\" \"Yes, he\u0027s a naval officer.\" \"Sounds like somebody I might like.\" The girl\u0027s voice was grainy and kind. Through the automobile noises outside, a vague sweeter sound drew nearer, and defined itself as a hand or an. \"Oh listen!\" Pam jumped up and went to the window. \"When did you last hear one of those?\" \"A few of them wander around Washington all the time.\" He was at her side, looking down five stories to the organ grinder, who was almost hidden in a crowding circle of children. She slipped her hand in his and leaned her head against his shoulder. \"Let\u0027s go down and watch the monkey. There must be one.\" \"Sure.\" \"First let me kiss you good-bye. On the street, I can\u0027t.\" She put her thin arms around him and kissed his mouth. Far below, the music of the hurdygurdy thumped and jangled. \"What is that song?\" she said, the breath of her mouth warm on his lips. \"I don\u0027t recognize it. It\u0027s a little like Handel\u0027s Messiah.\" \"It\u0027s called \u0027Yes, We Have No Bananas.\"\u0027 \"How moving.\" \"I love you,\" said Victor Henry, considerably surprising himself. She caressed his face, her eyes looking deep into his. \"I love you. Come.\" On the street, in the hot late sunshine, the children were squealing and shouting as a monkey on the end of a light chain, with a red hat stuck fast on its head, turned somersaults. The hurdygurdy was still grinding the same song. The animal ran to Victor Henry, and balancing itself with its long curled tail, took off the hat and held it out. He dropped in a quarter. Taking the coin and biting it, the monkey tipped the hat, somersaulted back to his master, and dropped the coin in a box. It sat on the organ, grinning, chattering, and rapidly tipping the hat. \"If that critter could be taught to salute,\" said Victor Henry, \"he might have a hell of a naval career.\" Pamela looked up in his face and seized his hand. \"You\u0027re doing as much as anybody I know-anybody, anybody-about this accursed war.\"\"Well, Pam, have a safe trip home.\" He kissed her hand and walked rapidly off, leaving her among the laughing children. Belu\u0027nd him the barrel organ wheezily started again on \"Yes, We Have No Bananas.\" Acouple of days later, Victor Henry received an order to escort to the Memorial Day parade the oldest naval survivor of the Civil War. This struck him as strange, but he pushed aside a mound of work to obey. He picked the man up at a veterans\u0027 home, and drove with him to the reviewing stand on Pennsylvania Avenue. The man wore a threadbare uniform like an old play costume, and the dim eyes in his bony, withered, caved-in face were cunningly alert. President Roosevelt\u0027s white linen suit and white straw hat glared in the bright sun, as he sat in his open car beside the stand. He gave the tottering ancient a strong handshake and bellowed at the box of his hearing aid, \"Well, well! You look better than I do, old top. I bet you feel better.\" \"I don\u0027t have your worries,\" quavered the veteran. The President threw his head back and laughed. \"How would you like to watch the parade with me?\" \"Better than-bee bee-marching in it.\" \"Come along. Come on, Pug, you sit with me too.\" The veteran soon fell asleep in the sunshine, and not even the booming and crashing of the brass bands could wake him. Roosevelt saluted, waved, put his straw hat over his heart when a flag went by, and smiled obligingly for the newsreel men and photographers crowding around the slumbering veteran beside the President. \"The Navy\u0027s my favorite,\" he said to Victor Henry, as blue Annapolis ranks swung by with set young faces under the tall hats. \"They march better than those West Point cadets. Don\u0027t ever tell any Army men I said so! Say, Pug, incidentally, whom can I send over to London to head up our convoy command?\" Pug sat dumbstruck. Ever since the press conference, the President had been sticking firmly to his no-convoy stance. \"Well? Don\u0027t you know of anybody? We\u0027ll call him a \u0027special naval observer,\" of course, or something, until we get things started.\" The President\u0027s voice did not carry over the blaring brasses to the chauffeur, nor to his naval aide in front, nor to the Secret Service men flanking the automobile. \"Sir, are we going to convoy?\" \"You know perfectly well we will. We\u0027ve got to.\"\u0027When, Mr. President?\" The President smiled wearily at Pug\u0027s bitter emphasis. He fumbled in his pocket. \"I had an interesting chat with General Marshall this morning. This was the upshot.\" He showed Victor Henry a chit of paper scrawled with his own handwriting: Victor Henry read these frustrating figures while American flags streamed past him and the marine band blared out \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\" Meanwhile Roosevelt was searching through more chits, He handed another to Pug, while taking the salute of the marine formation as it stalked splendidly past. This was in another handwriting, in green ink, with the last line ringed in red: tv, 19-41 0 L7 170 \"I\u0027ll take that,\" Roosevelt said, retrieving the chit. \"Those are the figures, Pug, for the day after my speech.\" \"Convoying would be a Navy job, sir. We\u0027re all ready.\" \"If we get into war,\" said the President through a broad smile and a wave at schoolchildren cheering him \"-and convoying might just do it -Hitler will at once walk into French West Africa. He\u0027ll have the Luftware at Dakar,\"where they can jump over to Brazil. He\u0027ll put new sub marine pens there, too. The Azores will be in his palm. The people who are screaming for convoy now just ignore these things. Also the brute fact that eighty-two percent, eighty-two percent of our people don\u0027t want to go to war. Eighty-two percent.\" The Navy veteran was sitting up now, blinking, and working In\", bony jaws and loose sunken mouth. \"My, this is a fine parade. I still remember marching past President Lincoln,\" he said reedily. \"There he stood, the President himself, all in black.\" The old man peered at the President. \"And you\u0027re all in white. And you\u0027re sitting, bee bee.\" Victor Henry shrank with embarrassment. Roosevelt laughed gaily, \"Well, there you are. Every President does things a little differently.\" He lit a cigarette in his long holder, and puffed. Boy Scouts in a brown mass Went stepping by, with heads and bright eyes turned toward the President. He waved his hat at them. \"So far this year, Pug, we\u0027ve produced twenty percent more automobiles than we made last year. And Congress wouldn\u0027t dream of giving me the power to stop it. Well? What about London? You didn\u0027t suggest anybody.\" Victor Henry diffidently named three well-known rear admirals. \" \"I know them,\" the President nodded. \"The fact is, I was thinking of you. \"It wouldn\u0027t work, Mr. President. Our man\u0027s opposite number in the Royal Navy will have flag rank.\"\"Oh, that could be fixed up. We could make you an admiral temporarily.\" From the surprise, and perhaps a little from the beating sun overhead, Pug felt dizzy. \"Mr. President, as you know, I just go where I\u0027m ordered.\" \u0027Now, Pug, none of that. Frankly, I like you right where you are. Deciding who gets what weapons and supplies is a big job. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re working on it, because you have sense. But think about London.\" \"Aye aye, sir.\" Pug returned the veteran to his nursing home, and went back to a piled-up desk. He got through a high heap of work and walked home, to give himself a chance to think. The city lay in holiday quiet. Connecticut Avenue was almost empty, the evening air was sweet and clear. Think about Londont Young couples on the benches in Dupont Circle turned and laughed, looking after the stocky man in Navy whites, striding along and humming a tune that had been popular before some of them were born. \"Hey, what the Sam Hill?\" Pug exclaimed, as he entered the living room. \"Champagne? And why are you gussied up like that? Whose birthday is it?\" \"Whose birthday, you old fool?\" Rhoda stood, splendid in a pink silk frock, her eyes glittering with tears. \"Don\u0027t you know? Can\u0027t you guess?\" \"I suppose I\u0027m fouled up on my dates.\" \"It\u0027s Victor Henry\u0027s birthday, that\u0027s whose birthday it is.\" \"Are you potted? Mine\u0027s in March.\" \"Oh, God, how dense the man is. Pug, at four o\u0027clock this afternoon, Janice had a boy! You\u0027re a grandfather, you poor man, and his name is Victor Henry. And I\u0027m a doddering old grandmother. And I love it. I love it! Oh, Pug!\" Rhoda threw herself in his arms. They talked about the great event over the champagne, downing a whole bottle much too fast. Janice and her baby were in fine shape. The little elephant weighed nine and a half whole pounds! Rhoda had raced up to the naval hospital for a look at him in the glass cage. \"He\u0027s the image of you, Pug,\" she said. \"A small pink copy.\" \"Poor kid,\" said Pug. \"He\u0027ll have no luck with the women.\" \"I like that!\" exclaimed Rhoda, archly giggling. \"Didn\u0027t you have Marvelous luck? Anyway, Janice and the baby are coming to stay with us. She doesn\u0027t want to take him back to Hawaiifor a while. SO that makes the house decision urgent. Now, Pug, just today I got that old latin, in Foxhall Road to come down another five thousand! I say let\u0027s grab it\u0027. That glorious lawn, those fine old elms! Sweetie, let\u0027s enjoy these coming years, let\u0027s wither in style, side by side, Grandma and Grandpa Henry. And let\u0027s always have lots of spare room for the grandchildren. Don\u0027t you think so?\" Victor Henry stared at his wife for such a long time that she began to feel odd. He heaved a deep sigh and made a curious upward gesture with both palms. \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you, Grandma. I couldn\u0027t agree with you moreThe time has come. Let\u0027s go to Foxhall Road by all means. And there we\u0027ll wither, side by side. Well said.\" \"Oh, how Marvelous! I love you. I\u0027ll call the Charleroi Agency in the morning. Now let me see what\u0027s happened to the dinner.\" She hurried out, slim silky hips swaying. Pug Henry upended the champagne bottle over his glass, but only a drop or two ran out, as he sang softly: But yes, we have no bananas, We have no bananas today. Three weeks later the Germans invaded the Soviet union. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1587/47205.html","bookId":1254,"book":{"id":1254,"title":"The Winds of War 战争风云","description":"简介： 《战争风云》是小说，书中关于亨利一家的人物和事迹纯属虚构。但小说中有关战争的史实是确凿的；统计数字是可靠的；那些大人物的言行要不是根据史实，便是根据可靠的记载。象这样范围的工作不可能没有错误，但作者希望读者们能看出，他是在尽很大的努力给一次大规模的世...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/24/13-38-35-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1587","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
