{"id":43118,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"\"Aren\u0027t you CLEVER to wear that suit. I dressed for spring and it\u0027s positively tropic here,\" Rhoda said. \"Where\u0027s Madeline? Is she all right?\" Quickly Janice explained why the daughter hadn\u0027t come. \"Well! Hasn\u0027t Mad turned into the little career girl! My dear, I want to kiss you, but I daren\u0027t. Don\u0027t come near me. I\u0027m virulent! I\u0027ve got the cold of the ages. They should quarantine me. I\u0027ll infect the nation. Well! How beautiful you are. You\u0027re ravishing. Lucky Warren! How is he, anyway?\" \"all right, I hope. He\u0027s sweating out carrier landings, down off Puerto Rico somewhere.\" Victor Henry, looking more impressive than Janice remembered in a gold-buttoned blue bridge coat and gold-encrusted cap, came through the crowd with a surly-looking customs inspector. After a brusque greeting to Janice and an inquiry about Madeline, he wanted to know where Byron had gotten off to. \"Briny disappeared. He had to make a phone call,\" the mother said. As the inspector glanced through the luggage, Janice told the Henrys about Palmer Kirby\u0027s invitation. Between sneezes, Rhoda said, \"Well, of all things. His factory\u0027s in Denver. What\u0027s he doing here? I don\u0027t think we can go, can we, Pug? Of course dinner at the Waldorf would be a lovely way to start life in the USA again. Take the taste of Berlin out of our mouths! Janice, you just can\u0027t picture what Germany is like now. It\u0027s gruesome. I\u0027m cured. When I saw the Statue of Liberty I laughed and cried. Me for the USA hereafter, now and forever.\" \"Matter of fact, I have to talk to Fred Kirby,\" Pug said. \"Oh, Pug, it\u0027s impossible, I have his filthy cold-and my HAm!\" Rhoda said. \"What could I wear to the Waldorf, anyhow? Everything\u0027s a mass of wrinkles, except what I\u0027m standing up in. If I could only get my pink suit pressed-and if I could get to a hairdresser for a couple of hours-\" Byron came sauntering through the noisy crowd. \"Hey, Janice! I\u0027m Warren\u0027s brother. I thought you\u0027d be here.\" He produced from his pocket a small box with a London label, and gave it to her. Janice opened it, and there lay a Victorian pin, a little golden elephant with red stones for eyes. \"Good heavens!\" \"Anybody who marries one of us needs the patience of an elephant,\" said Byron. \n \"Ye gods, if that\u0027s not the truth,\" said Rhoda, laughing. Janice gave Byron a slow female blink. He was even handsomer than Warren, she thought. His eyes had an eager aroused sparkle. She kissed him. have nothing to offer,\" said the grainy strong singsong voice out of the radio, slurring the consonants almost like a drunken man, \u0027but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.\" \u0027y, he\u0027s a genius!\" Rhoda exclaimed. She sat on the edge of a frail gilt chair in Kirby\u0027s suite, champagne glass in hand, tears in her eyes. \"Where has he been till now?\" Smearing caviar from a blue Russian-printed tin on a bit of toast, and carefully sprinkling onion shreds, Byron said, \"He was running the British Navy when Prien got into Scapa Flow and sank the Royal Oak. And when the Germans crossed the Skagerrak to Norway.\" \"Shut up and listen,\" Victor Henry said. Janice glanced from the son to the father, crossed her long legs, and sipped champagne. Palmer Kirby\u0027s eyes flickered appreciatively at her legs, which pleased her. He was an interesting-looking old dog. ... You ask, what is our policy? I will say, it is to wage \u0027War, by sea, land, and air, with all our might and all the strength that God can give us: to wage war against a nwnstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, tvhat is our aim? I can answer in one mid: Victory-victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror... I take up my task with buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail atwng men...\" The speech ended. An American voice said with a cough and tremor, \u0027Tow have just heard the newly appointed Prime Minister of Great Britain) Winston Churchill.\" After a moment, Rhoda said, \"That man will save civilization. We\u0027re going to get in now. The Germans overplayed their hand. We\u0027ll never let them conquer England. There\u0027s something strangely thick about the Germans, you know? One must observe them close up for a long time to understand that. Strangely thick.\" Victor Henry said to Dr, Kirby, glancing at his watch, \"Quite a speech. Can we talk now for a few minutes?\" Kirby got to his feet and Rhoda smiled at him. \"Champagne, caviar, and business as usual. That\u0027s Pug.\" \"We\u0027re just waiting for Madeline,\" Pug said. \n \"Come along,\" Kirby said, walking into the bedroom. \u0027Say, Dad, I\u0027m going to have to mosey along,\" Byron said. \"There is this plane to Miami I have to catch. It leaves La Guardia in about an hour.\" \u0027What! Dr. Kirby thinks you\u0027re dining with him.\" \u0027Vefl, see, I made the reservation before I knew about this dinner.\" \"You\u0027re not waiting till Madeline comes? You haven\u0027t seen her in two years. She\u0027s taking us all to her show after dinner.\" \"I think I\u0027d better go, Dad.\" Abruptly, Pug left the room. \u0027Briny, you\u0027re impossible,\" his mother said. \"Couldn\u0027t you have waited until tomorrow?\" \"Mom, do you remember what it\u0027s like to be in love?\" Rhoda surprised him and Janice Lacouture by turning blood red. \"Me? My goodness, Byron, what a thing to say! Of course not, I\u0027m a million years old.\" \u0027Thank you for my Marvelous pin.\" Janice touched the elephant on her shoulder. \"That must be some girl, in Miami.\" Byron\u0027s blank narrow-eyed look dissolved in a charming smile and an admiring glance at her. \u0027She\u0027s all right.\" \u0027Bring her to the wedding with you. Don\u0027t forget.\" As Byron went to the door, Rhoda said, \"You have a real talent for disappointing your father.\" \u0027He\u0027d be disappointed if I didn\u0027t disappoint him. Good-bye, Mom.\" In the bedroom Dr. Kirby sat at a desk, checking off a stack of journals and mimeographed reports that Victor Henry had brought him from Germany. As be scribbled in a yellow notebook, the little desk shook and two reports slid to the floor. \"They must rent this suite to midgets,\" he said continuing to write. Victor Henry said, \"Fred, are you working on a uranium bomb?\" Kirby\u0027s hand paused. He turned, hanging one long loose arm over the back of his chair, and looked into Henry\u0027s eyes. The silence and the steady look between the men lasted a long time. \"You can just tell me it\u0027s none of my goddamn business, but\"-Pug sat on the bed-\u0027all that stuff there zeroes in on the uranium business. And some of the things I couldn\u0027t get, like the graphite figures, why, the Germans told me flatly that they were classified because of the secret bomb aspects. The Germans are fond of talking very loosely about this terrible ultra-bomb they\u0027re developing. That made me think there was nothing much to it. But that list of requests you sent gave me second thoughts.\" Kirby knocked out his pipe, stuffed it, and lit it. The process took a couple of minutes, during which he didn\u0027t talk, but looked at Captain Henry. He said slowly, \"I\u0027m not a chemist, and thisuranium thing is more or less a chemical engineering problem. Electricity does come into it for production techniques. A couple of months ago I was approached to be an industrial consultant.\" \"What\u0027s the status of the thing?\" \"All theory. Years away from any serious effort.\" \"Do you mind telling me about it?\" \"Why not? It\u0027s in the college physics books. Hell, it\u0027s been in Life magazine. There\u0027s this process, neutron bombardment. You expose one chemical substance and another to the emanations of radium, and see what happens. It\u0027s been going on for years, in Europe and here. Well, these two Germans tried it on uranium ode last year, and they produced barium. Now that\u0027s transmutation of elements by atom-splitting. I guess you know about the fantastic charge of energy packed in the mass of the atom. You\u0027ve heard about driving a steamship across the ocean on one lump of coal, if you could only harness the atomic energy in it, and so forth.\" Victor Henry nodded. \"Well, Pug, this was a hint that it might really be done with uranium. It was an atom-splitting process that put out far more energy than they\u0027d used to cause it. These Germans discovered that by weighing the masses involved. There\u0027d been an appreciable loss of mass. They published their finding, and the whole scientific community\u0027s been in an uproar ever since. \"Okay, the next step is, there\u0027s this rare hot isotope of uranium, u-235. This substance may Turn out to have gigantic explosive powers, through a chain reaction that gives you a huge release of energy from mass. A handful maybe can blow up a city, that sort of talk. The nuclear boys say it may be practicable right now, if industry will just come up with enough Pure U-235-\" Pug listened to all this with his mouth compressed, his body tensed forward. \"Uh-huh, uh-huh,\" he kept saying when Kirby puffed on his Pipe. He pointed a stiff finger at the engineer. \"Well, I follow all that. This is vital military intelligence.\" Kirby shook his head. \"Hardly. It\u0027s public knowledge. It may be a complete false alarm. These chemical engineers don\u0027t guarantee anything. And what they want will take one hell of a big industrial effort to deliver. Maybe the stuff will explode, maybe it won\u0027t. Maybe as soon as you have enough of it, it\u0027ll all fly apart. Nobody knows. Five minutes of scratch pad work shows that you\u0027re talking about an expenditure of many many millions of dollars. It could run up to a billion and then you could end up with a crock of horseshit. Congress is on an economy rampage. They\u0027ve been refusing Roosevelt the money for a couple of hundred new airplanes.\" \"I\u0027ll ask you a couple of more questions. If I\u0027m off base, tell me.\" \"Shoot.\"\"Where do you come into it?\" Kirby rubbed his pipe against his chin. \"Okay, how do you separate out isotopes of a very rare metal in industrial quantities? One notion is to shoot it in the form of an ionized gas through a magnetic field. The lighter ions get deflected a tiny bit more, so you stream \u0027em out and catch them. The whole game depends on the magnetic field being kept stable, because any wavering jumbles up the ion stream. Precise control of voltages is my business.\" \"Uh-huh. Now. One last point. If an occasion arises, should I volunteer my valued opinion to the President that he should get off his ass about uranium?\" Kirby uttered a short baritone laugh. \"The real question here is the Germans. How far along are they? This cuteness of theirs about pure graphite disturbs me. Graphite comes into the picture at a late stage. If Hitler gets uranium bombs first, Pug, and if they happen to work, that could prove disagreeable.\" A doorbell rang. \u0027I guess that\u0027s your daughter,\" Kirby said. \"Let\u0027s go down to dinner.\" Madeline arrived in a black tailored suit with a flaring jacket and a tight sheath skirt, dark hair swept up on her head. It was hard to think of her as only twenty. Possibly she was putting on the young career woman a bit, but she did have to leave the table in the Empire Room twice, when the headwaiter came and said with a bow that CBS was on the telephone. Victor Henry liked her confident, demure manner and her taciturnity. With alert eyes darting from face to face, she listened to the talk about Germany and about the wedding plans, and said almost nothing. In the studio building, at the reception desk, a stiff, uniformed youngster awaited them. \"Miss Henry\u0027s party? This way, please.\" He took them to a barren low-ceilinged green room where Hugh Cleveland and his staff sat around a table. Briskly cordial, Cleveland invited them to stay in the room till the show started. He was looking at cards, memorizing spontaneous jokes he would make later, and discussing them with his gagman. After a while he snapped a rubber band around the cards and slipped them in his pocket. \"Well, five minutes to go,\" he said, turning to the visitors. \"I hear this fellow Churchill gave a pretty good speech. Did you catch it?\" \"Every word,\" Rhoda said. \"It was shattering- That speech will go down in history.\" \"Quite a speech,\" Pug said. Madeline said, \"Darn, and I was so busy I missed it.\" The show\u0027s producer, who looked forty-five and dressed like a college boy, put a manicured hand to the back of his head. \"It was fair. It needed cutting and punching up. Too much tutti-frutti. There was one good line about blood and sweat.\"\"There was? How would that go with the butcher who plays the zither?\" Cleveland said to the joke writer at his elbow, a melancholy young Jew who needed a haircut. \"Could we throw in something about blood and sweat?\" The joke writer sadly shook his head. \"Bad taste.\" \"Don\u0027t be silly, Herbie. Try to think of something. Captain Henry, how\u0027s the war going? Will the Gamelin Plan stop the Krauts?\" \"I don\u0027t know what the Gamelin Plan is.\" Madeline put her guests in privileged seats on the stage of the studio, near the table where Cleveland interviewed the amateurs before a huge cardboard display extolling Morning Smile pink laxative salts. She posted herself in the glassed control booth. A large audience, which to Victor Henry seemed composed entirely of imbeciles, applauded the stumbling amateurs and roared at Cleveland\u0027s jokes. Cleveland ran the program with smooth foxy charm; Pug realized now that Madeline had latched herself to a corner. But the show disgusted him. One amateur identified himself as a line repairman. Cleveland remarked, \"Well, haw haw, guess they could use you in France right about now.\" \"France, Mr. Cleveland?\" \"Sure. On that Maginot Line.\" He winked at the audience; they guffawed and clapped. \"Does this amuse you?\" Pug said across Rhoda, in a low tone, to Palmer Kirby. \"I never listen to the radio,\" said the engineer. \"It\u0027s interesting. Like a visit to a madhouse.\" \"That Cleveland\u0027s cute, though,\" Rhoda said. Madeline came to them after the show, as the audience swarmed on stage around Hugh Cleveland seeking his autograph. \"Damn, two of our best bits got cut off the air by news bulletins. They\u0027re so high-handed, those news people!\" \"What\u0027s happening?\" Victor Henry asked. \"Oh, it\u0027s the war, naturally. just more of the same. The Germans have overrun some new town, and the French are collapsing, and so on. Nothing very unexpected. Hugh will have a fit when he hears they cut the butcher with the zither.\" \"Miss Henry?\" A uniformed page approached her. \"Yes?\" \"Urgent long-distance call, miss, in Mr. Cleveland\u0027s office, for Miss Lacouture. From Puerto Rico.\" On the flying bridge of the fishing boat Blue Bird, rocking gently along at four knots in theGulf Stream, Byron and Natalie lay in each other\u0027s arms in the sun. Below, the jowly sunburned skipper yawned at the wheel over a can of beer, and the ship-to-shore telephone dimly crackled and gobbled. From long poles fixed in sockets at the empty fighting chairs, lines trailed in the water. Sunburned, all but naked in swimming suits, the lovers had forgotten the fish, the lines, and the skipper. They had forgotten death and they had forgotten war. They lay at the center of a circle of dark blue calm water and light blue clear sky. It seemed the sun shone on them alone. The deck echoed with loud rapping from below, four quick knocks like a Morse code V. \"Hey, Mr. Henry! You awake?\" \"Sure, what is it?\" Byron called hoarsely, raising himself on an elbow. \"They\u0027re calling us from the beach. Your father wants you to come on in.\" \"My father? Wrong boat. He\u0027s in Washington.\" \"Wait one-Hello, hello, Blue Bird calling Bill Thomas-\" They heard the squawking of the ship-tshore again. \"Hey, Mr. Henry. Your fatheris he a naval officer, a captain?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Well, the office has your girl\u0027s mother on the telephone. Your father\u0027s at her house and the message is to get back there pronto.\" Natalie sat up, her eyes wide and startled. Byron called, \"Okay, let\u0027s head back.\" \"What on earth?\" Natalie exclaimed. \"I haven\u0027t the foggiest idea.\" The boat, scoring a green-white circle on the dark sea, picked up speed and started to pitch. The wind tumbled Natalie\u0027s long free black hair. She pulled a mirror from a straw basket. \"My God, look at me. Look put the back of her hand to her lips. \"Well, no use trying to patch up this at that mouth. I look gnawed. As though the rats had been at me!\" She Gorgon\u0027s head till we come in. What ran your father want, Briny?\" \"y are you so alarmed? Probably he\u0027s here with my mother, and she wants a look at you. I can\u0027t blame her, the way I shot down here. If so, I\u0027m going to tell them, Natalie.\" Her face turned anxious. She took his hand. \"Angel, there\u0027s sonic Jewish law about not getting married too soon after a parent dies. Possibly for as long as a year, and-good heavens! Don\u0027t make such a face! I\u0027m not going toobserve that. But I can\u0027t distress my mother at this point. I need some time to figure this out.\" \"I don\u0027t want you violating your religion, Natalie, but lord, that\u0027s a blow.\" \"Sweetie, I wasn\u0027t planning on marrying you until about an hour ago.\" She shook her head and ruefully laughed. \"I feel weird. Almost disembodied. Too much sun, or maybe I\u0027m just drunk on kisses. And now your father suddenly showing up! Isn\u0027t it all like a fever dream?\" He put his arm around her shoulders, holding her close as the boat pitched and rocked more. \"Not to me. It\u0027s damned real, and the realest thing of all is that we\u0027re getting married. Reality just seems to be starting.\" \"Yes, no doubt. I certainly don\u0027t look forward to writing to LeslieJehosephat, that scowl again! You put it on and off like a Halloween mask, it\u0027s unnerving-Briny, he came down to see me right after Papa died. He was remarkably helpful and kind. A new Slote, just a bit too late. He\u0027s been writing to his university friends to find me a teaching job. I wish I knew what your father wanted! Don\u0027t tell him about us, Byron. Not till I\u0027ve talked to my mother.\" \u0027You\u0027d better talk to her righi away, then. My father has a way of getting at the facts.\" \"Oh! Oh!\" She put both hands to her hair. \"I\u0027m so happy, and so confused, and so upset! I\u0027m dizzy. I feel sixteen, which I\u0027m not, God knows! \"Better for you if I were.\" When the Blue Bird drew closer in, Byron got the binoculars and scanned the ragged row of skyscraper hotels along the beach. \"I thought so. There he is, waiting on the pier.\" Natalie, lounging in one of the chairs, sat bolt upright. \"Oh, no. You\u0027re sure?\" \"Right there, pacing back and forth. I know that walk.\" She seized her basket and darted into the cabin, saying to the skipper, \"Slow down, please.\" might, miss.\" The bewhiskered man, with a grin, pulled back on the throttle. She closed the little door to the forward cabin. Soon she emerged in a cotton skirt and white blouse, her black hair brushed gleaming and loose to her shoulders. \"I\u0027m seasick,\" she said to Byron, wanly smiling. \"Try putting on eyebrows and a mouth sometime in a rocking boat, in a hot little cabin. Whew! Am I green? I feel green.\" \"You look wonderful.\" The boat was wallowing half a mile from the pier. Natalie could see the man in blue walking up and down. \"Full steam ahead,\" she said shakily. \"Damn the torpedoes.\" Victor Henry, leaning down from the tar-smelling pier, held out a hand as the boat stopped. \"Hello, Natalie. This is a helluva thing to do to you. Watch it, don\u0027t step on that nail.\"Byron leaped ashore. \"What\u0027s up, Dad? Is everybody all right?\" \"Have you two had lunch?\" Pug said. They looked at each other, and Natalie nervously laughed. \"I did pack sandwiches. There in this basket. We, well, I cion\u0027t know, we forgot. An amused look came and went in Victor Henry\u0027s eyes, though his face remained stern. \"Uhhuh. Well, the smells from that joint there\"-he pointed with his thumb at a dilapidated clam bar on the pier-\"have been driving me nuts, but I thought I\u0027d wait for you. I haven\u0027t eaten yet tcday.\" \u0027Please come to my house. I\u0027d love to fix you something.\" \"Your mother was kind enough to give me orange juice and coffee. D\u0027you mind if we go in here? These waterfront places can be pretty good.\" They sat in a tiny plywood booth painted bright red. Byron and his father ordered clam chowder. \u0027I\u0027ve never learned to like that stuff,\" Natalie said to the waiter. \u0027Can I have a bacon and tomato sandwich?\" \"Sure, miss.\" Victor Henry looked oddly at her. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" she said. \"You\u0027re not fussy about what you eat.\" She looked puzzled. \"Oh. You mean the bacon? Not in the least, I\u0027m afraid. Many Jews aren\u0027t.\" \"How about your mother?\" \"Well, she has some vague and inconsistent scruples. I can never quite follow them.\" \"We had quite a chat. She\u0027s a clever woman, and holding up remarkably, after her loss. Well!\" Pug put cigarettes and lighter on the table. \"It looks like France is really folding, doesn\u0027t it? Have you heard the radio this morning? In Paris they\u0027re burning papers. The BEF is high-tailing it for the Channel, but it may already he too late. The Germans may actually bag the entire British regular army.\" \"Good God,\" Byron said. \"If they do that the war\u0027s over! How could this happen in three days?\" \"Well, it has. While I was waiting for you I heard the President on my car radio, making an emergency address to a joint session of Congress. He\u0027s asked them for fifty thousand airplanes a year.\" \"Fifty thousand a year?\" exclaimed Natalie. \"Fifty thousand? Why, that\u0027s just wild talk.\"\"He said we\u0027d have to build the factories to Turn \u0027em out, and then start making \u0027em. In the mood I saw in Washington yesterday, he\u0027s going to get the money, too. The panic is finally on, up there. They\u0027ve come awake in a hu \" rryByron said, \"None of this can help England or France.\" \"No. Not in this battle. What COngress is starting to think about is the prospect of us on our own, against Hitler and the Japanese. Now.\" Pug lit a cigarette, and began ticking off points against spread stiff fingers. \"Warren\u0027s thirty-day leave has been cancelled. The wedding\u0027s been moved up. Warren and Janice are getting married tomorrow. They\u0027ll have a oneday honeymoon, and then he goes straight out to the Pacific Fleet. So. Number one: You\u0027ve got to get to Pensacola by tomorrow at ten.\" With a hesitant look at Natalie, who appeared dumbfounded, Byron said, \"All right, I\u0027ll be there.\" \"Okay. Number two: If you want to get into that May 27 class at sub school, you\u0027ve got to report to New London and take the physical by Saturday.\" \"Can\u0027t I take a physical at Pensacola?\" The father pursed his lips. \"I never thought of that. Maybe I can get Red Tully to stretch a point. He\u0027s already doing that, holding this place open for you. The applications are piling up now for that school.\" \"May 27?\" Natalie said to Byron. \"that\u0027s eleven days from now! Are You going to submarine school in eleven days?\" \"I don\u0027t know. it\u0027s a possibility.\" She turned to his father. \"How long is the school?\" \"It\u0027s three months.\" \u0027What will become of him afterward?\" My guess is he\u0027ll go straight out to the fleet, like Warren. The n\",? lubs are just starting to come on the line.\" \"Three months! And then you\u0027ll be gone!\" Natalie exclaimed, \"Well, we\u0027ll talk about all that,\" Byron said. \"Will you come with me to the wedding tomorrow?\" \"Me? I don\u0027t know. I wasn\u0027t invited.\"\"Janice asked me to bring you.\" \"She did? When? You never told me that.\" Byron turned to his father, \"Look, when does the submarine course after this one begin?\" \u0027I don\u0027t know. But the sooner you start, the better. It takes you thirteen more months at sea to get your dolphins. There\u0027s nothing tougher than qualifying in submarines, Briny. A flier has an easier job.\" Byron took one of his father\u0027s cigarettes, lit it, inhaled deeply, and said as he exhaled a gray cloud, \u0027Natalie and I are getting married.\" With an appraising glance at Natalie, who was biting her lower lip, Victor Henry said, \"I see. Well, that might or might not affect your admittance to the school. I hadn\u0027t checked that point, not knowing of this development. In general, unmarried candidates get the preference in such situations. Still, maybe the thing to do-\u0027 Natalie broke in, \"Captain Henry, I realize it creates many difficulties. We only decided this morning. I myself don\u0027t know when or how. It\u0027s a fearful tangle.\" Looking at her from under his eyebrows as he ate, Pug nodded. \"There are no difficulties that can\u0027t be overcome,\" said Byron. \"J-isten, darling,\" Natalie said, \"the last thing I\u0027ll ever do is stop you from going to submarine school. My God, I was in Warsaw!\" Byron smoked, his face blank, his eyes narrowed at his father. Victor Henry looked at his wristwatch and gathered up his cigarettes and lighter. \"Well, that\u0027s that. Great chowder. Hits the spot. Say, there\u0027s a plane to Pensacola that I can still make this afternoon.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you just telephone all this?\" Byron said. \"It would have been simple enough. Why did you come here?\" Victor Henry waved the check and a ten-dollar bill at the waiter. \"You took off like a rocket, Byron. I didn\u0027t know your plans or your state of mind. I wasn\u0027t even sure you\u0027d agree to come to the wedding.\" \"Why, I wouldn\u0027t have heard of his staying away,\" Natalie said. \"Well, I didn\u0027t know that either. I thought I ought to be available to talk to both of you, and maybe answer questions, and use a little persuasion if necessary.\" He added to Natalie, \"Janice and Warren do expect you. That I can tell you.\" She put a hand to her forehead. \"I just don\u0027t know if I can come.\" \"We\u0027ll be there,\" Byron said flatly. \"Or at least I will. Does that take care of everything?\"Pug hesitated. \"What about sub school? I told Red I\u0027d call him today.\" \"If Captain Tully has to know today, then I\u0027m out. All right?\" Natalie struck the table with her fist. \"Damn it, Byron. Don\u0027t make decisions like that.\" \"I don\u0027t know any other way to make decisions.\" \"You can talk to me. I\u0027m involved.\" Victor Henry cleared his throat. \"Well, I\u0027ve spoken my piece and I\u0027ll shove off. We can pick this topic up tomorrow.\" \"Oh?\" Byron\u0027s tone was acid. \u0027Then you don\u0027t really have to call Captain Tully today, after all.\" Victor Henry\u0027s face darkened. He leaned back in the hard seat. \"See here, Byron. Hitler and the Germans are creating your problem. I\u0027m not. I\u0027m calling it to your attention.\" \"Well, all this bad news from Europe may be highly exaggerated, and in any case, no American submarine will ever fail to sail because I\u0027m not in it.\" \"Oh, be quiet, Briny,\" Natalie said in a choked voice. \"Let your father catch his plane.\" \"Just keep remembering I didn\u0027t start this war, Byron,\" Victor Henry said, in almost the tone he had used on the waiter in Wannsee, picking his white cap off a peg while looking his son in the face. \"I think you\u0027d make a good submariner. They\u0027re all a bunch of goofy individualists. On the other hand, I can\u0027t hate you for wanting to marry this brilliant and beautiful young lady. And now I\u0027m getting the hell out of here.\" Victor Henry stood. \"See you in church. Get there early, you\u0027ll be best man. Wear your dark suit.-Good-bye, Natalie. Sorry I broke up your day on the boat. Try to come to Pensacola.\" \"Yes, sir.\" A sad little smile lit her worried face. Thank you.\" When he went out, she turned to Byron. \"I have always loathed the smell of cooking fish. Let\u0027s get out of here. I was half sick during all that. God knows how I\u0027ve kept from shooting my cookies.\" Natalie strode seaward along the wharf, taking deep gulps of air, her skirt fluttering on her swinging hips, the thin blouse wind-flattened on her breasts, her black hair flying. Byron hurried after her. She stopped short at the end of the wharf, where two ragged Negro boys satfishing, and turned on him, her arms folded. \u0027y the devil did you treat your father like that?\" \"Like what? I know why he came here, that\u0027s all,\" Byron returned with equal sharpness. \"He came to separate us.\" His voice rang and twanged much like Victor Henry\u0027s. \u0027Oh, take me home. Straight home. He was utterly right, you know. You\u0027re blaming him for the way the war is going. That\u0027s the essence of immaturity. I was embarrassed for you. I hated that feeling.\" They walked back up the pier to her father\u0027s new blue Buick sedan, glittering and baking in the sun, giving off heat like a stove. \"Open an the doors, please. Let some air blow through, or we\u0027ll die in there!\" Byron said as he went from door to door, \"I have never wanted anything before, not of life, not of him, not of anybody. Now I do.\" \"Even if it\u0027s true, you still have to look at reality, not throw tantrums.)\u0027 \"He did quite a job on you,\" said Byron. \"He usually gets anything done that he intends to.\" They climbed into the car. \"That\u0027s how much you know,\" she said harshly, slamming her door as he whirred the motor. \u0027I\u0027m coming to Pensacola with you. All right? I love you. Now shut up and drive me home.\" IL With a groan, to the clatter of an old tin alarm clock, Lieutenant Warren Warren Henry woke at seven on his wedding day. Until four he had been in the sweet arms of his bride-to-be in a bedroom of the Calder Arms Hotel, some twenty miles from Pensacola. He stumbled to the shower and turned on the cold water in a gush. As the needling shock brought him to, he wearily wondered whether spending such a night before his wedding morning hadn\u0027t been somewhat gross, Poor Janice had said she would have to start dressing and packing as soon as she got home. Yes, certainly gross, but ye gods! Warren laughed aloud, hemid up his face to the cold water, and started to sing. It was rough, after all-a rushed wedding, a one-night honeymoon, and then a separation of thousands of miles! Too much to ask of human nature. Anyway, it wasn\u0027t the first time. Still-Warren was drying himself with a big rough towel, and cheering up by the \u0027minute-there was such a thing as propriety. Such doings on the wedding eve were ill-timed. But it was rotten luck to be torn away from her like this. It was just one of those things, and Hitler\u0027s invasion of France was the real cause, not any looseness in himself or Janice. \n Truth to tell, the prospect of parting from Janice was not bothering Warren much. She would be coming along to Pearl Harbor in due course. The sudden orders to the Pacific had put him in an excited glow. Cramming in a premature night with Janice had been an impulse of this new bursting love of life he felt. He was rushing to fly a fighter plane from the U-S-S. EnterPrise, because war threatened. It was a star-spangled destiny, a scary ride to the moon. For all his mental motions of regret at leaving Janice, and remorse at having enjoyed her a little too soon and a little too much, Warren\u0027s spirit was soaring. He called the mess steward, ordered double ham and eggs and a jug of coffee, and gaily set about dressing for his nuptials. Byron, standing in the hall outside his brother\u0027s room, smiled at a rlude cartoon tacked to the door: Father Neptune, a lump throbbing on his pate, wrathuly rising from the sea ahead of an aircraft carrier, brandishing his trident at an airplane with dripping wheels, out of which the pilot leaned, saluting and shouting, \"So sorry!\" \"Come in!\" Warren called to his knock. \"\u0027Wet Wheels\u0027 Henry, I presume?\" Byron quoted the cartoon caption. \"Briny! Hey! My Christ, how long has it been? Well, you look great! God, I\u0027m glad you made it for the wedding.\" Warren ordered more breakfast for his brother. \"Listen, you\u0027ve got to tell me all about that wild trip of yours. I\u0027m supposed to be the warrior, but Jesus, you\u0027re the one who\u0027s had the adventures. Why, you\u0027ve been bombed and strafed by the Nazis! My buddies will sure want to talk to you.\" \"Nothing heroic about getting in the way of a war, Warren.\" \"Let\u0027s hear about it. Sit down, we have a lot to catch up on.\" They talked over the food, over coffee, over cigars, and as Warren packed they kept talking, awkwardly at first, then loosening up. Each was taking the other\u0027s measure. Warren was older, heavier in the face, more confident, more than ever on top of the world and ahead of his brother: so Byron felt. Those new gold wings on his white dress uniform seemed to Byron to spread a foot. About flying Warren was relaxed, humorous, and hard. He had mastered the machines and the lingo, and the jokes about his mishaps didn\u0027t obscure the leap upward. He still spoke the words naval aviator\" with pride and awe. To Byron, his own close calls under fire had been stumblebum episodes, in no way comparable to Warren\u0027s disciplined rise to fighter pilot. For his part, Warren had last seen Byron setting off to Europe, a hangdog slouching youngster with a bad school record and not a few pimples, already cooling off about a career in fine arts. \n Byron\u0027s skin now stretched brown and clear over a sharpened jaw; his eyes were deeper; he sat up straighter. Warren was used to the short haircuts and natural shoulder lines of the Navy. Byron\u0027s padded dark Italian suit and mop of reddish hair gave him a dashing appearance that went with his saga of roaming in Poland under German bombs with a beautiful jewess. Warren had never before envied his younger brother anything. He envied the red stitch-marked scar on his temple-his own scar was a mishap, not a war wound-and he even somewhat envied him the jewess, sight unseen. \"What about Natalie, Byron? Did she come?\" \"Sure. I parked her at Janice\u0027s house. That was decent of Janice, telephoning her last night. Did Dad put her up to it?\" \"He just said the girl wasn\u0027t sure she was expected. Say, that thing\u0027s serious, is it?\" Warren paused, suitcase hanger in one hand and a uniform jacket in the other, and looked hard at his brother. \u0027We\u0027re getting married.\" \"You are? Good for you.\" \"Do you mean that?\" \"Sure. She sounds like a Marvelous girl.\" \"She is. I know the religious problem exists-21 Warren grinned and ducked his head to one side. \"Ah, Byron, now-a-days-does it really? if you wanted the ministry-or politics, say-you\u0027d have to give it more thought. Christ, with the war on and the whole world coming apart, I say grab her -I look forward to meeting that girl. Isn\u0027t she a PhD. or something?\" \"She was going for an M.A. at the Sorbonne.\" \"Brother! I\u0027d be more scared of her than of a carrier landing at night in a line squall.\" Byron\u0027s grin showed possessive pride. \"I was around her six months, and never opened my mouth, hardly. Then she up and said she loved me. I\u0027m still trying to believe it.\" \u0027Why not? You\u0027ve gotten damned handsome, my lad. You\u0027ve lost that string-bean look. You marrying up now, or after sub school?\" \u0027I\"o the devil says I\u0027m going to sub school? Don\u0027t start that. I get enough from Dad.\" Warren deft]Y moved clothes from bureau to a foot locker. \"But He\u0027s right, Byron. You don\u0027t want to wait till you get called up. If you do they\u0027ll shove you around, rush you through, and you may not even draw the duty you want. You can pick your spot now and get decenttraining. Say, have YOu given naval aviation any thought? Why do You want to go crawling around at four knots, three hundred feet underwater, when you can fly? I get claustrophobia just thinking about subs. You might make a great flier. One thing you are is relaxed.\" \"I got interested in subs.\" Byron described Prien\u0027s talk in Berlin on the sinking of the Royal Oak. \u0027That was a brave exploit,\" said Warren. \"A real score. Even Churchill admitted that. Very romantic. I guess that\u0027s what attracts you. But this s an air war, Briny. Those Germans haven\u0027t got that much of an edge on the ground. The papers keep talking panzers, panzers, but the French have more and better tanks than the Germans. They\u0027re not using them. They\u0027ve been panicked by those Stukas, which just use our own divebombing tactics.\" \"That\u0027s what got me, a Stuka,\" Byron said. \"It didn\u0027t look that scary. Fixed wheels, single engine, medium size, kind of slow and awkward.\" Tossing ByrOn a large gray book, Warren said with a grin, \"Take a look through The Flight jacket. I\u0027m there in Squadron Five, tying on my solo flags. I\u0027ve got to pay some bills, then we\u0027re off to church.\" Byron was still looking through the yearbook when his brother returned. \"Holy cow, Warren, number one in ground school! How\u0027d you do that and court Janice, too?\" \"It took a toll.\" Warren made an exhausted face, and they both laughed. \u0027Bookwork is never too tough when you organize it.\" Byron held up the yearbook, pointing to a black-bordered page. \"These fellows all got it?\" Warren\u0027s face sobered. \"Yep. Frank Monahan was my instructor, and a great flier.\" He sighed and looked around the barren room, hands on hips. \"Well, I\u0027m not sorry to leave this room. Eleven months I\u0027ve sweated in here.\" Pensacola might look small and sleepy, Warren said as they drove into town, but it had perfect climate, great water sports, fine fishing, good golf and riding clubs, and up-and-coming industries. This was the real Florida, not that Brooklyn with palm trees called Miami. These rural western counties were the place to get a political start. Congressman Ucouture had had no competition. He had recently decided to run for the Senate in the fall, and his chances were considered excellent. Warren said he and Janice might well come back here one day. \u0027When you retire?\" Byron said. \"That\u0027s looking far ahead.\"\u0027Possibly before then.\" With a side glance, Warren took in Byron\u0027s astonishment. \u0027Listen, Briny, the day I soloed, President Roosevelt fired the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Fleet. Some dispute over policy for the Asiatic Fleet. Made him ambassador to Turkestan, or something, but actually just kicked him out. CinCus himself! In the Navy you\u0027re just a hired man, my lad, right on up that big climb through the bureaus and the shore stations and the sea billets. Right to the top. Don\u0027t ever tell Dad I talked like this. Janice is an only child and the Lacouture firm does twenty million a year. Of course, as long as I can fly, that\u0027s all I want to do.\" Inside the pink stone church topped by a square bell tower, two men in smocks were finishing up a huge flower display, and an unseen organist was rippling a Bach prelude. \"Nobody can say I kept her waiting at the church,\" Warren said. \"Almost an hour to go. Well, we can talk. It\u0027s cool in here.\" They sat halfway down the rows of empty purple-cushioned pews. The music, the odor of the flowers, the unmistakable childhood smell of church, hit Byron hard. He felt again what it was like to be a reverent boy, sitting or standing beside his father, joining in the hymns, or trying to follow the minister\u0027s talk about the misty and wonderful Lord Jesus. Marrying Natalie, there would be no such wedding as this. What kind could they have? A church was altogether out of the question. What was it like to be married by a rabbi? They had not discussed that part at all. The two brothers sat side by side in a long silence. Warren was again regretting, in a fashion, last night\u0027s indulgence, and making half-hearted pious resolves. The feelings of a bridegroom were coming over him. \"Briny, say something. I\u0027m getting nervous. Who knows when we\u0027ll have a chance to talk again?\" Byron wistfully smiled, and it struck Warren once more how goodlooking his brother had become. \"Long time since you and I went to church together.\" \"Yes. Janice likes to go. I guess if these walls aren\u0027t falling in on me now, there\u0027s still hope for me. You know, Briny, all this may work out pretty well. If you do get into subs, you can put in for duty at Pearl. Maybe the four of us will end up there together for a couple of years. Wouldn\u0027t that be fine?\" Natalie had often visited the homes of wealthy college friends, but she was not prepared for the Lacouture mansion, a rambling stone house on the bay, in a private section guarded by a mossy stucco wall, an ironfenced entrance, and an iron-faced gatekeeper. Gentility, seclusion, exelusion, were all around her. The rooms upon rooms of antique furniture, Persian rugs, grandfather clocks, large oil portraits, heavy worn draperies, ironwork, gilt-framed big nidrrors, old-fashioned photographs-the whole place unsettled her. Janice scampered to meet her in a fluttery pink housecoat, her blonde hair tumbling to her shoulders. \n \u0027Hi! So sweet of you to come on this short notice. Look at me. I didn\u0027t sleep all night. I\u0027m so tired I can\u0027t see. I\u0027ll never be ready. Let\u0027s get You some breakfast.\" \"Please, just put me in a corner somewhere till we go. I\u0027m fine.\" Janice scanned her with weary but keen big hazel eyes. This happy girl, all pink and gold, made Natalie the more conscious of her own dark eyes, dark hair, wrinkled linen suit, and sad dowdy look. \"No wonder Byron fell for you. My God, you\u0027re pretty. Come along.\" Janice took her to a breakfast alcove fating the water, where a maid brought her eggs and tea in old blue-and-white china on a silver tray. She ate and felt better, if no more at home. Outside, sailboats tacked here and there in the sunshine. Clocks struck nine in the house, one after the other, bonging and chiming. She could hear excited voices upstairs. She took the letter from her purse, where it had seemed a lump of lead all the way from Miami: five single-space pages so faintly typed that her eyes ached to read them. Obviously A.J. was not going to learn to change a typewriter ribbon till he died. It was a long tale of woe. He had a fractured ankle. With a French art critic, an old friend, he had gone on a tour of cathedrals the week after Byron had left. At Orvieto, mounting a ladder to look at an inaccessible fresco, he had slipped and fallen to the stone floor. To make matters worse, there was his mixed-up citizenship problem, which for the first time he was taking seriously. He had \"derivative citizenship\u0027 from his father\u0027s naturalization around igoo; but because of his long residence out of the country, difficulties had arisen. There seemed to be conflicting records of his age at the time of his father\u0027s naturalization. The man in Rome, a decent enough person to talk to but an obsessive bureaucrat, had pressed searching questions and demanded more and more documents, and Aaron had left Rome in deep confusion. Aaron wrote: I may have made a mistake at that point, but I decided to drop the whole thing. This was in December of last year. It seemed to me that I was like the fly blundering into a spider web; the more I\u0027d struggle, the tighter I\u0027d become enmeshed. I didn\u0027t really want to go home just then. I assumed that if I let the thing cool off and asked for the passport renewal later-especially if some other consul general were appointed meantime -I\u0027d get it. it\u0027s a question of a purple stamp and a two,-dollar fee. It seemed unthinkable to me then, and still does now, that I could actually be denied permission to return to my own country, where I am even listed in Who\u0027s Who! During the spasm of alarm over Norway, he had once visited the Florence consulate. There a \"shallow but seemingly affable crew-cut type\u0027 had conceded that these were all silly technicalities, that Dr. Jastrow was certainly an eiwnent and desirable person, and that the consular service would somehow solve the difficulty. Much relieved, Jastrow had gone off on the cathedral tour, fractured his ankle, and thus missed an appointment to return to the consulate two weeks later. \n The letter continued: What comes next I still cannot understand. It was either incredible stupidity or incredible malevolence. Crew-cut wrote a letter to me. The tone was polite enough. The gist was that as a stateless person in wartime I faced serious complications, but he thought he had found a way out. Congress has recently passed a law admitting certain special classes of refugees. If I were to apply under that law, I probably would have no further trouble, being a prominent Jew. That was his recommendation. Do you realize the ill depth of the stupidity and the damage in his letter? I received it only five days ago. I\u0027m still boiling. To begin with he wants me to abandon all claim to being an American-which I am, whether my papers are in order or not-and to enlist myself in the mob of clamoring Jewish refugees from Europe seeking admittance as hardship cases! But that isn\u0027t the worst of it. He put all this on paper and he put it in the mail. I cannot believe that even such a dullard doesn\u0027t know that a letter from the consular office to me would be opened and read by the Italians. I\u0027ll never know why Crew-cut did it, but I\u0027m forced to suspect a trace of anti-Semitism. That bacfflus is in the European air, and in in personalities it lodges and flourishes. The Italian authorities now know my problem. That alarmingly increases my vulnerability here. I\u0027ve been sitting in the lovely sunshine of the terrace day after day, in a wheelchair, alone except for Italian servants, growing more and more perturbed. Finally I decided to write to you, and give the letter to my French friend to mail. Natalie, I have certainly been heedless about a serious matter. I can only plead that before the war these things seemed of no consequence. To you I\u0027m sure they still don\u0027t. You were born on American soil. I was born on the banks of the Vistula. I am getting a late lesson in the vast difference that makes, and in the philosophy of personal identity. I really should straighten my situation out. Happily, there\u0027s no desperate urgency in it. Siena\u0027s tranquil, food\u0027s plentiful again, my ankle\u0027s healing, and the war is distant summer thunder. I am getting on with my work, but I had better clarify my right to go home. One can never know when or where the villain with the mustache will make his next move. Now will you tell all this to Leslie Slote? There he sits in Washington, at the heart of things. A hangman\u0027s noose of red tape can be cut by one word spoken in the right place. If he still has a shred of regard for me, let him look into this. I could write him directly but I know we\u0027ll get faster action if you go to him. I beg you to do this. Jastrow wrote a touching pAragraph about Natalie\u0027s father. He blamed their estrangement on himself. The scholarly temperament was a sejf-absorbed one. He hoped that he could treat her as a daughter, though a father\u0027s place could never really be filled. Then came the passage aboutByron which had prevented Natalie from showing him the letter. Have you Byron yet? I miss him. He has a curiously charming Presence-triste, humorous,reser(seen) ved, virile. I\u0027ve never known a more winning boy, and I\u0027ve known hundreds. A young fellow in his twentis shouldn\u0027t seem a boy, but he does. An aureole of romance plays about him. Byron might be all right if he had any talent, or a vestige of drive. Sometimes he shows doggedness: and he has a way of coming out with bright Hashes. He said Hegel\u0027s world-spirit was just God minus Christianity. That\u0027s commonplace enough, but he added it was much easier to believe in God\u0027s sacrificing him for mankind, than in His groping to understand Himself through the unfolding of mankind\u0027s stupidities. I rather liked that. Unhappily it was the one good thing amid many banalities such as, \"This Nietzsche was just some kind of a nut,\" and \u0027Nobody would bother reading Fichte, if anybody could understand him.\" If I\u0027d marked Byron for our seminar on the Slote Reading List, he\u0027d have made a C minus. Often I came upon him reading your letters over and over in the lemon house. The poor lad has a terrible crush on you. Are you at all aware of that? I hope you won\u0027t inadvertently hurt him, and I rather wonder at your writing him so often. For all my troubles, I\u0027ve been a reasonably good boy, and stand on manuscript page 847 Of ConstantineA clock chiming the half hour brought Natalie back with a start from the terrace in Siena-where in her mind\u0027s eye she could see A.J. sitting wrapped in his blue shawl, writing these words-to the Lacouture mansion on Pensacola Bay. \u0027Oh God,\" she muttered, \"oh my God.\" Feet trampled on a staircase; many voices called, laughed, chattered. The bride came sailing down the long dining room, wheat-colored hair beautifully coiffed and laced with pearls, cheeks pink with pleasure. \"Well, l did it. Here we go. Natalie jumped to her feet, cramming A.J.\"s pages into her purse. \"Oh, you\u0027re enchanting! You\u0027re the loveliest sight!\" Janice pirouetted clear around on a toe. \"Bless you.\" The white satin, clinging to Hanks and breasts like creamy skin, rose demurely to cover her throat. She moved in a cloud of white lace. This blend of white chastity and crude fleshy allure was devastating; it shook Natalie with envy. The bride\u0027s eye had an ironic gleam. After her wild pre-wedding night, Janice Lacouture felt approldmately as virginal as Catherine of Russia. It didn\u0027t bother her. Rather, it appealed to her sense of humor. \"Come,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll ride with me.\" She took the Jewish girl\u0027s \"You know, if I weren\u0027t marrying Warren Henry, I\u0027d give you a run arm. \n for that little Briny. He\u0027s an Adonis, and so sweet. Those Henry men!\" Rhoda arrived at the hotel in a flurry, and frantically bathed and dressed, pulling cosmetics from one valise, underwear from another, her new Bergdorf Goodman frock from a third. Dr. Kirby had chartered a \u0026 small plane and had flown down with her and Madeline. \u0027He saved our Lives!\" trilled Rhoda, dashing about in a sheer green slip. \"The last plane we could get from New York didn\u0027t leave us any time to finish shopping. Your daughter and I would have come to this wedding in OLD RAGS. This way, we had a whole extra afternoon and, Pug, you never sAw such fast shopping. Isn\u0027t this a cunning number?\" She held the green frock against her bosom. \"Found it at the last second. Honestly, a small plane is such FUN. I slept most of the way, but when I was awake it was RREAT. You really know you\u0027re flying.\"Damn nice of him,\" Pug said. \"Is Fred that rich?\" \"Well, of course, I wouldn\u0027t hear of it, but then he said it was all charged to his company. He\u0027s taking the plane on to Birmingham today. Anyway, I wasn\u0027t going to argue too much, dear. It was a deliverance. Fasten me up in back. Pug, did Briny really bring that Jewish girl here? Of all things. Why, I\u0027ve never even laid eyes on her. She\u0027ll have to sit with us, and everybody\u0027ll think she\u0027s part of the family.\" \"Looks like she will be, Rhoda.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it. I just don\u0027t. y, how much older is she? Four years? That Briny! just enjoys giving us heart failure. Always has, the monster. Pug, what\u0027s taking you so long? My land, it\u0027s hot here.\" \u0027She\u0027s two years older, and terrifically attractive.\" \"Well, YOu\u0027ve got me curious, I\u0027ll say that. I pictured her as one of these tough Brooklyn chickens who shove past you in the New York department stores. Oh, stop fumbling, I\u0027ll finish the top ones. Mercy, I\u0027m roasting! I\u0027m PerSpiring IN rivers. This dress will be black through before we get to church.\" Natalie knew in thirty seconds that the handsome woman in green chiffon and rose-decorated white straw hat didn\u0027t like her. The polite handshake outside the church, the prim smile, told all. Pug presented Natalie to Madeline as \"Byron\u0027s sidekick on the Polish jaunt,\" obviously trying with this clumsy jocula make up for his fe\u0027s e rity to wiEr ere \"Oh, yes, wow! Some adventure!\" Madeline Henry smiled and looked Natalie over. Her pearl-gray shantung suit was the smartest outfit in sight. \"I want to hear all about that, some time. I still haven\u0027t seenBriny, YOu know, and it\u0027s been more than two years.\" \"He shouldn\u0027t have rushed down to Miami the way he did,\" Natalie said, feeling her cheeks redden. \"Why not?\" said Madeline, with a slow Byron-like grin. It was strange to echoes of his traits in his family. Mrs. Henry held her head as Byron did, erect on a long neck. It made him seem more remote. He wasn\u0027t just himself any more, her young companion of Jastrow\u0027s library and of Poland, or even the son of a forbidding father, but part of a quite alien group. The church was full. From the moment she went in, Natalie felt uncomfortable. Cathedrals gave her no uneasiness. They were just sights to see, and Roman Catholicism, though she could write a good paper about it, was like Mohammedanism, a complex closed-off structure. A Protestant church was the place of the other religion, the thing she would be if she weren\u0027t a Jew. Coming into one, she trod hostile territory. Rhoda didn\u0027t make quite enough room for her in the pew, and Natalie had to push her a little, murmuring an excuse, to step clear of the aisle. All around, women wore bright or pastel colors. Officers and air cadets in white and gold abounded. And there Natalie stood at a May wedding in black linen, hastily selected out of a vague sense that she was still in mourning and didn\u0027t belong here. People peered at her and whispered. It wasn\u0027t her imagination; they did. How charming and fine the church was, with its dark carved wooden ceiling arching up from pink stone walls; and what stunning masses of flowers! How pleasant, comfortable, and normal to be born an Episcopalian or a Methodist, and how perfect to be married this way! Perhaps A.J. was right, and encouraging Byron had been irresponsible. Leslie Slote was an and bookish pagan like herself, and they had even talked of being married by a judge. The robed minister appeared, book in hand, and the ceremony began. As the bride paced down the aisle on the congressman\u0027s arm, moving like a big beautiful cat, Rhoda started to cry. Memories of Warren as a little boy, memories of her own wedding, of other weddings, of young men who had wanted to marry her, of herself-a mother before twenty of the baby who had grown into this handsome groom-flooded her mind; she bowed her head in the perky hat and brought out the handkerchief. For the moment she lost her awareness of the melancholy Jewish girl in black beside her, and even of Palmer Kirby towering above people three rows back. When Victor Henry softly took her hand, she clasped his and pressed it to her thigh. What fine sons they had, standing up there together! And Pug stood slightly hunched, almost at attention, his face sombre and rigid, wondering at the speed with which his life was going, and realizing again how little he allowed himself to think about Warren, because he had such inordinately high hopes for him. Standing up beside his brother, Byron felt many eyes measuring and comparing them. Warren\u0027s uniform, and the other uniforms in the church, troubled him. His Italian suit with itsexaggerated lines, beside Warren\u0027s naturally cut whites, seemed to Byron as soft and frivolous as a woman\u0027s dress. As Janice lifted her veil for the kiss, she and Warren exchanged a deep, knowing, intimately amused glance. \"How are you doing?\" he murmured. \"Oh, still standing up. God knows how, you doing?\" And with the minister beaming on them, they embraced, kissed, and laughed, there in the church in each other\u0027s arms, over the war-born joke that would last their whole lives and that nobody else would ever know. Cars piled up in front of the beach club, only a few hundred yards from the Lacouture house, and a jocund crowd poured into the canopied entrance for the wedding brunch. \"I swear, I must be the only Jew in Pensacola,\" Natalie said, hanging back a little on Byron\u0027s arm. \"When I walk through that door, I\u0027m going to set off gongs.\" He burst out laughing. \"It\u0027s not quite that bad.\" She looked pleased at making him laugh. \"Maybe not. I do think your mother might be a wee bit happier if a wall had fallen on me in Warsaw.\" At that moment, Rhoda, half a dozen paces behind them, was responding to a comment by a Washington cousin that Byron\u0027s girl looked striking. \"Yes, doesn\u0027t she? So interesting. She might almost be an Armenian or an Arab. Byron met her in Italy.\" Champagne glass in hand, Byron firmly took Natalie around the wedding party from room to room, introducing her. \"Don\u0027t say I\u0027m your fiancee,\" Natalie ordered him at the start. \"Let them think what they please, but don\u0027t let\u0027s get into all that.\" She met Captain Henry\u0027s father, an engineer retired from the lumber trade, a short withered upright man with thick white hair, who had travelled in from California and who looked as though he had worked hard all his life; and his surprisingly fat brother, who ran a soft-drink business in Seattle; and other Henrys; and a knot of Rhoda\u0027s kin, Grovers of Washington. The clothes, the manners, the speech of the Washington relatives set them off not only from the California people, but even from Lacouture\u0027s Pensacola friends, who by comparison seemed a Babbitty lot. Janice and Warren came and stayed, joking, eating, drinking, and dancing. Nobody would have blamed them, in view of their limited time, for vanishing after a round of handshakes, but they evinced no impatience for the joys of their new state. Warren asked Natalie to dance, and as soon as they were out on the floor, he said, \"I told Byron this morning that I\u0027m for you. That was sight unseen. \"Do you always take such blind risks? A flier should be more prudent.\" \"I know about what you did in Warsaw. That\u0027s enough.\"\"You\u0027re cheering me up. I feel awfully out of place here.\" \"You shouldn\u0027t. Janice is as much for you as I am. Byron seems changed already,\" Warren said. \"There\u0027s a lot to him, but nobody\u0027s ever pressed the right button. I\u0027ve always hoped that some day a girl would, and I think you\u0027re the girl.\" Rhoda Henry swooped past, champagne glass in hand, and gathered them up to join a large family table by the window. Possibly because of the wine, she was acting more cordial to Natalie. At the table Lacouture was declaring, with rebsh for his own pat phrases, that the President\u0027request for fifty thousand airplanes year was \"politically hysterical, fiscally irresponsib(s) le,andindustriallyinconceivable.\"Eve(a) n the German air force didn\u0027t have ten thousand planes all told; and it didn\u0027t have a single bomber that could fly as far as Scotland, let alone across the Atlantic. A billion dollars! The interventionist press was whooping it up, naturally, but if the debate in Congress could go on for more than a week, the appropriation would be licked. \"We have three thousand miles of good green water between us and Europe,\" he said, \"and that\u0027s better protection for us than half a million airplanes. Roosevelt just wants new planes in a hurry to give to England and France. But he\u0027ll never come out and say that. Our fearless leader is slightly deficient in candor.\" \u0027You\u0027re wring to see the British and French go down, then,\" Pug Henry said. p \"That\u0027s how the question s usually put,\" said Lacouture. \u0027Ask me if I\u0027m willing to send three million American boys overseas against the Germans, so as to prop up the old status quo in Europe. Because that\u0027s what this is all about, and don\u0027t ever forget it.\" Palmer Kirby put in, \"The British navy\u0027s propping up our own status quo free of charge, Congressman. If the Nazis get hold of it, that\u0027ll extend Hitler\u0027s reach to Pensacola Bay.\" Lacouture said jovially, \"Yes, I can just see the Rodney and the Nelson right out there, flying the swastika and shelling our poor old beach club.\" this raised a laugh among the assorted in-laws around the table, and Rhoda said, \"What a charming thought.\" Victor Henry said, \u0027This isn\u0027t where they\u0027ll come.\" \u0027They\u0027re not coming at all,\" Lacouture said. \"That\u0027s New York Times stuff. If the British get in a jam, they\u0027ll throw out Churchill and make a deal with Germany. But naturally they\u0027ll hang on long they think there\u0027a chance that the Roosevelt administration, the British Sy(as) mpathizer(as) s, and the New York (s) Jews will get us over there.\" \"I\u0027m from Denver,\" said Kirby, \u0027and I\u0027m Irish.\" He and Victor Henry had glanced at Natalie when Lacouture mentioned the Jews. \"Well, error is contagious,\" said the congressman with great good nature, \"and it knows no boundaries.n This easy amused war talk over turkey, roast beef, and champagne, by a broadpicture window looking out at beach umbrellas, white sand, and heeling sailboats, had been irritating Natalie extremely. Lacouture\u0027s last sentence stung her to say in a loud voice, \"I was in Warsaw during the siege.\" Lacouture calmly said, \"That\u0027s right, so you were. You and Byron. Pretty bad, was it?\" \"The Germans bombed a defenseless city for three weeks. They knocked out all the hospitals but one, the mine I worked in. The wounded were piled up in our entrance hall like logs. In one hospital a lot of pregnant women burned up.\" The table became a hole of quiet in the boisterous party. The ngers. \"That sort of thing has been going on in Europe for centuries, my dear. It\u0027s exactly what I want to spare the American people.\" \u0027Say, I heard a good one yesterday,\" spoke up a jolly-faced man in steel-rimmed glasses, laughing. \"Abey and his family, see, are driving down to Xfiami, and about Tampa they run out of gasoline. Well, they drive into this filling station, and this attendant says, \u0027Juice?\" And old Abey he says, \u0027Veil, vot if ve are? Dunt ve get no gess?\"$ The jolly man laughed again, and so did the others. Natalie could see he meant no harm; he was trying to ease the sober Turn of the talk. Still she was very glad that Byron came up now and took her off to dance. \"How long does this go on?\" she said. \"Can we go outside? I don\u0027t want to dance.\" \u0027Good. I have to talk to you.\" They sat on the low wall of the terrace in blazing sun, by stairs leading to the white sand, not far from the picture window, behind which Lacouture was still holding forth, shaking his white-thatched head and waving an arm. Byron leaned forward, elbows on knees, fingers clasped together. \"Darling, I think I\u0027m getting organized here. I may as well fly up to New London today or tomorrow and take that physical, so that-what\u0027s the matter?\" A spasm had crossed her face. \"Nothing, go on. You\u0027re flying to New London.\" \"Only if you agree. I\u0027ll do nothing that we both don\u0027t concur on, from now on and for ever. \"All right.\" \"Well, I take the physical. I a check the situation, and make very sure that a married applicant has a chance, and that if he\u0027s admitted he gets to spend time with his wife. That takes care of our first few months, maybe our first year. I\u0027ll eventually go to one submarine base or another, if I get through, and you\u0027ll come along, the way Janice is doing. We all might end up at Pearl Harbor together. \n There\u0027s a university in Hawaii. You might even teach there.\" \u0027Goodness, you\u0027ve been thinking with might and main, haven\u0027t you?\" Victor Henry came through the doors to the terrace. Byron looked up, and said coolly and distantly, \"Hi, looking for me?\" \u0027Hi. I understand you\u0027re driving Madeline to the airport. Don\u0027t leave without me. I just talked to Washington and I\u0027ve got to scoot back. Your mother\u0027s staying on.\" \"When\u0027s the plane?\" Natalie said. \"One-forty.\" \"Can you lend me some money?\" she said to Byron. \"I think I\u0027ll go to Washington on that plane.\" Pug said, \"Oh? Glad to have your company,\" and went back into the club. \u0027You\u0027re going to Washington!\" Byron said. \"Why there, for crying out loud?\" She put a cupped palm to Byron\u0027s face. \"Something about Uncle Aaron\u0027s citizenship. While you\u0027re in New London, I can take care of it. My God, what\u0027s the matter? You look as though you\u0027ve been shot.\" \"You\u0027re mistaken. I\u0027ll give you the fare.\" \"Byron, listen, I do have to go there, and it would be plain silly to fly down to Miami and then right back up to Washington. Can\u0027t you see that? It\u0027s for a day or two at most.\" \"I said I\u0027d give you the fare.\" Natalie sighed heavily. \"Darling, listen, I\u0027ll show you Aaron\u0027s letter. He asked me to talk to Leslie Slote about his passport problem, it\u0027s beginning to worry him.\" She opened her purse. \"What\u0027s the point?\" Byron stile[y stood up. \"I believe you.\" Warren insisted on coming to the airport, though Pug tried to protest that the bridegroom surely had better things to do with his scanty time. \"How do I know when I\u0027ll see all of you again?\" Warren kept saying. Rhoda and Janice got into the argument, and the upshot was that the Henrys plus the bride and Natalie all piled into Lacouture\u0027s Cadillac. Rhoda on the way out had snatched a bottle of champagne and some glasses. \"This family has been GYPPED by this miserable, stupid war,\" she declared, handing the glasses around asByron started up the car. \"The first time we\u0027re all together in how many years? And we can\u0027t even stay together for twelve hours! Well, I say, if it\u0027s going to be a short reunion it\u0027s damn well going to be a merry one. Somebody sing something!\" So they sang \"Bell Bottom Trousers\" and \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" and \"I\u0027ve Got Sixpence\" and \"Auld LangSyne\" as the Cadillac rolled toward the airport. Natalie, crowded between Rhoda and Madeline, tried to join in, but \"Auld LangSyne\" was the only song she knew. Rhoda pressed a glass on her, and filled it until wine foamed over the girl\u0027s fingers. \"Oops, sorry, dear. Well, it\u0027s a mercy your suit\u0027s black,\" she said, mopping at Natalie\u0027s lap with her handkerchief. When the car drove through the airport entrance they were singing one Natalie had never even heard, a family favorite that Pug had brought from California: Tillwe meet, till we meet Tilltve meet at Jesus\u0027 feet Till we meet, till we meet God be with YOU till \u0027we meet again and Rhoda Henry was crying into her champagne-soaked handkerchief, stating that these were tears of happiness over Warren\u0027s wonderful marriage. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1587/47195.html","bookId":1254,"book":{"id":1254,"title":"The Winds of War 战争风云","description":"简介： 《战争风云》是小说，书中关于亨利一家的人物和事迹纯属虚构。但小说中有关战争的史实是确凿的；统计数字是可靠的；那些大人物的言行要不是根据史实，便是根据可靠的记载。象这样范围的工作不可能没有错误，但作者希望读者们能看出，他是在尽很大的努力给一次大规模的世...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/24/13-38-35-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1587","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
