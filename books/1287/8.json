Have ready a freezing pot in ice and salt; put in your ice cream, cover the pot, keep turning it till the water comes round the pot; then open it and scrape it down: continue turning it, and scraping it down as it freezes, till it becomes quite hard and smooth. If an ice cream is mixed too rich, put in a little more cream: if it is poor, put in some more jam. If a water ice is mixed too rich, it will require some 80more water: if it is too poor, put in some clarified sugar. If an ice is poor, the first time you scrape it down, it will feel quite rough and hard: on the contrary, if an ice is too rich, it will not freeze at all. All fruit ices that are put into the shapes of fruit, should have a paper round the moulds, just as you put them in the ice: let them lay in ice and salt for an hour. N.B. Before you turn your ices out, take care to make the water come up the sides of the tub, and in turning them out, put your moulds just into hot water, and then out again; then the ice cream will come out easily. N.B. All ices that are in the shape of fruit, should be coloured according to the fruit they represent. 81 To prepare the Cochineal for colouring different Sorts of Ice.
