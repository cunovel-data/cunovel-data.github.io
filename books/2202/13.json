The snow, the presents, the frigging good cheer.\\n\\n Yeah, it sucked all right. Sure, it was only once a year, but that was one time too many. Carolers, months of Christmas music, candy canes, and all but Cindy Lou Who skipping down the sidewalk.\\n\\n It was too much. Too damn much.\\n\\n I was seven when I knew there wasn\u0027t a Santa anymore. I was thirteen when my sister started the whole \"Is there really a Santa?\" thing and \"The kids at school say . . .\" The usual stuff. And that she was seven, the same age I\u0027d been, only made it worse.\\n\\n So I lied. Sure there was a Santa. And when Mom told me to take her to see store Santa, I hadn\u0027t bitched too much. She and Dad both had to work. They worked hard. We weren\u0027t poor, but we sure weren\u0027t rich either. Dad was a good hunter and that put food on the table, but it didn\u0027t pay the electric or the mortgage.\\n\\n Plus I remembered what it was like, how knowing had taken the magic out of Christmas. I didn\u0027t want to admit it. I was tougher than that. I didn\u0027t want to admit that even six years later I missed waiting to hear hoofbeats on the roof, the jingle of bells, the thump of boots hitting the bottom of our big, old fireplace.\\n\\n Yeah, I didn\u0027t want to fess up to it, but it was true. Now Christmas was just another day. I wasn\u0027t into Jesus or church, mangers or angels. You got presents and, sure, that was cool, but the excited knot in your stomach, the blankets clenched in your fists, the listening for all you were worth that Christmas Eve night.\\n\\n Gone.\\n\\n It was stupid to miss it. I was way too old for that shit. You could ask anybody. If the kids at school found out, they\u0027d laugh me out of class. If the teachers found out, they wouldn\u0027t know what to think. Probably send me to the counselor for soft words, ink blots, and a note for my parents. But they didn\u0027t know, and every teacher would tell you: I wasn\u0027t a dreamer. No way. I was a smart-ass kid. My dad told me so, my teachers, the principal . . . who spent more time lecturing me than my teachers ever did. He told me at thirteen I was too young to get into trouble, too young to be cynical. And definitely too young to have such a foul mouth.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t get out of the office much.\\n\\n Smart-assed and foul-mouthed, you\u0027d think there was no way I\u0027d get glum every Christmas, but I did. Every single one. And no matter what had happened that one particular Christmas when I was seven - throughout the Christmas I\u0027d first lost the spirit, I\u0027d never get it back. I\u0027d never get a do-over. No matter how much I wanted to.\\n\\n Jackass, I said to my reflection in the display glass of the store. Suck it up. Get over it. You\u0027re not seven anymore. You\u0027re not a little kid. There are no do-overs in life.\\n\\n I pushed the door open to the department store, the only one we had in Connor\u0027s Way, a town so small we had two stores, three restaurants, and one stoplight. It had been home since August now. It was one of those towns where everyone knew everyone and everything you did got around if you weren\u0027t careful. I was thirteen . . . there were plenty of things I did I didn\u0027t want getting around.\\n\\n Tessa slid her hand into mine and I grimaced. Little sisters, what a pain in the ass. Big eyes the same brown as mine looked up at me and she smiled at me with that big-brother-worshipping smile. I sighed, squeezed her hand, and tugged her along. \"Come on. Before the line gets too long.\" She was a pain, but she was my pain and family\u0027s what counts. Dad said that over and over again. People are people, but it\u0027s family that counts.\\n\\n Along with the brown eyes she looked like me. Slightly dark skin, curly black hair. We were related all right. You could see that a mile away. Dead-on our dad.\\n\\n \"What kind of cookies should I make Santa?\" Tessa chattered. \"Chocolate chip? Peanut butter? Oooh, Snickerdoodles. Everybody loves Snickerdoodles. Right? You like Snickerdoodles, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n I rolled my eyes and was thankful the line wasn\u0027t that long. Santa was pretty much what I expected: fat enough to strain his big black belt and with a beard so fake and bushy that rats could\u0027ve nested in it. He had glasses perched on the end of his red-veined nose and his lap was full of a sobbing, kicking-and-screaming two-year-old with a load in his training pants that had to weigh more than he did.\\n\\n \"Eww,\" Tessa said, tugging at my hand. \"I don\u0027t want to sit there.\"\\n\\n \"Then just stand beside him and tell him what you want for Christmas,\" I said impatiently. \"His balls could probably use the break.\" Hundreds of kids slamming down on them day after day, no way I\u0027d want his job.\\n\\n \"Balls?\" She wrinkled her nose. \"I don\u0027t see any balls. Snowballs?\"\\n\\n Jesus. I was in for it now. \"Hey, it\u0027s your turn,\" I said with relief, letting go of her hand and giving her a light shove. \"Remember to hold still for the picture or Mom\u0027ll kill me.\"\\n\\n She moved up beside and tiptoed up to whisper in his ear. The camera flashed, and even though it was a little early, it did make a cute picture. Then Tessa leaned back and bounced happily in shiny patent leather shoes that went with her best red velvet dress.\\n\\n The fake Santa blinked at her, twitched a forced smile, and hurried her off with a candy cane. As we waited for the picture to pop out, I asked, \"What\u0027d you ask for?\"\\n\\n I let her take my hand again as she said solemnly, \"You know.\"\\n\\n We all wanted something we weren\u0027t going to get. This was Tessa\u0027s year for disappointment. The one thing she wanted and the one thing she\u0027d never get. Feeling more guilty than I wanted to, I said, \"You want to get a milk shake before we go home?\"\\n\\n Of course she did, and we went to the drugstore. They had an old-fashioned malt shop there. I didn\u0027t much know or care what an old-fashioned malt shop, like the sign said, was, but they served milk shakes and that was enough for me. I had chocolate, she had strawberry, and things were fine until Jed walked in. His parents had named him Jedidiah and he had a punch for anyone who called him that. It was supposed to be biblical. I guessed it didn\u0027t take.\\n\\n I slid him a careful sideways look. Cold blue eyes stared back, then he gave a half snarl, half hateful grin. Jed was fourteen, big, and a bully. Christmas might suck, but so did bullies.\\n\\n And Jed was of the worst kind. The worst in the school, that\u0027s for sure. He picked on kids who were smaller and younger. He thought that made him a badass. It didn\u0027t. It just made him a coward. He hadn\u0027t messed with me yet, but it was only a matter of time. I was close to his size, but not close enough for him to pass over me. Not by a good three inches. I was husky for my age, but a little short. Yeah, he was working his way up to me. He was a coward, but he was stupid, too. It wouldn\u0027t be long before he\u0027d get over being careful of someone almost as heavy as him if not as tall. Between mean and stupid, stupid wins every time.\\n\\n Tessa and I slurped up the last of our shakes and we left. She used both hands to try and peel the plastic off her candy cane. \"You\u0027re smart,\" she announced.\\n\\n \"Oh yeah? What makes you think that?\" The sidewalk was clear of snow, shoveled clean.\\n\\n \"That mean guy doesn\u0027t bother you.\" She popped the top loop of the cane in her mouth. \"Wi-ly.\" She\u0027d just learned the word when I\u0027d been practicing for my spelling test and loved using it although half the time she didn\u0027t know what it meant.\\n\\n Wily? Nah. I was about as wily as a Pop-Tart. This was just luck. And luck?\\n\\n It only lasts so long.\\n\\n \"Nicky, are you paying attention or are you shooting for extra home-work?\"\\n\\n I looked up from the history book I was only pretending to read. I was hungry. I didn\u0027t concentrate so well when I was hungry. My stomach growled as I lied, \"Yes, Mrs. Gibbs, I\u0027m paying attention.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t believe me, but the bell rang, saving me and my stomach. I bolted for the cafeteria. It was burger day. Most of the kids were all about pizza day, but not me. I liked burgers and I paid for three meals to get three of them. When Mom had handed me my lunch money for the week, she\u0027d ruffled my hair and said I was a growing boy. I might be three inches short of Jed, but I had shot up two inches in the past month. The boys in my family might hit their growth spurts late, but when we hit them, we hit them.\\n\\n I was thinking that when he slammed his tray across from mine on the cafeteria table, his shaggy silver blond hair hanging in his eyes. \"I hear you\u0027re in the Russian Club, geek.\"\\n\\n I was, not that I cared much about it, but Dad insisted. Our grandparents had come from Russia. Roots and all that crap. Nicky was short for Nikolai, and I made damn sure no one in school knew that.\\n\\n \"Yeah, so?\" I started on my first burger.\\n\\n \"That makes you a geek. A loser.\" Those eyes, pale as a snow-filled sky, stared at me. They were like the eyes of a husky, a wild one used to living on its own. Catching its own food. Killing because it could. Jed was twisted inside, wrong. The teachers didn\u0027t see it. They just saw parents who didn\u0027t care, maybe some sort of learning disorder, they didn\u0027t see what he really was, because they didn\u0027t want to. But I saw.\\n\\n He was a monster. He was just a kid now maybe, but you could bet he was some kind of serial killer waiting to grow up. But wouldn\u0027t that be a lot of paperwork for the guidance counselor? Why not pass him on? Let him be someone else\u0027s problem.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like geeks.\" He leaned forward and bared teeth too big for his mouth. \"And I definitely don\u0027t like losers.\" He reached over and took one of my burgers, daring me to do something about it.\\n\\n But I didn\u0027t. Not there. Dad had taught me to fight, because everyone needed to be able to take care of himself. But he\u0027d also taught me never to do it in public where you can get in trouble and never to hit first, at least not anyone smaller. It wouldn\u0027t be fair and it wouldn\u0027t be honorable. My dad believed in honor, pounded it into me from the time I could crawl. You can protect yourself, you can fight - that\u0027s the way the world was - but only the ones bigger than you.\\n\\n Honor was a pain in the ass sometimes, but Jed was bigger than I was. I wasn\u0027t forgetting that. Still, there was the whole not getting into trouble thing . . .\\n\\n Taking my burger back and smacking the son of a bitch over the head with his tray would definitely get me in trouble. So I ate my second burger and ignored him. He couldn\u0027t start anything either. Not at school. And I knew ways home to avoid him. I\u0027d gotten to know the woods that stretched behind the school pretty good. Gotten detention for skipping class to explore them more than once. I deserved a lot more punishment than that, but Principal Johnson took it easy on me, no matter what he thought about my smart-ass ways and foul mouth.\\n\\n Jed kept glaring at me while ripping into my burger with those snaggled teeth. Man, was that an orthodontist\u0027s dream. That was a car payment and a lap dance, right there.\\n\\n How\u0027d I know about lap dances? I had a cousin back East who had a friend and, boy, could she tell some stories. I was thinking of one of them and wishing twenty-one wasn\u0027t so far away when Sammy made the really bad choice of sitting next to me. He couldn\u0027t have been paying attention. Nobody sat at the same table as Jed on purpose. Sammy wasn\u0027t a bad guy. Not too smart and called Dog Boy by most of the kids at school, but he was okay. He had four dogs, big, shaggy mutts, who followed him to and from school. I liked dogs. Jed hated them and the feeling was mutual. One look of his freaky pale blue eyes and the dogs would bark until foam flew from their muzzles before eventually turning and fleeing with tails between their legs.\\n\\n You know you\u0027re a shit when even dogs didn\u0027t like you. I kept hoping one would hump his leg or better yet piss on it, but it never happened. Probably for the best. I didn\u0027t want to think what Jed would do if he ever caught one of those dogs.\\n\\n \"Hey, Dog Boy,\" Jed sneered. \"You think I want to eat my lunch smelling you? You stink like those damn mutts of yours. Get the hell out of here.\"\\n\\n Sammy\u0027s eyes widened as he realized who was sitting with me and scrambled away, his tray shaking hard enough to spill his juice. He did smell a little like dog, but hey, we all have something. Jed was psycho and Sammy was a little doggy. I\u0027d take a fur-covered pair of jeans over crazy any day. But today was a day crazy didn\u0027t seem to want to leave me alone. I\u0027d started on my second burger, so Jed couldn\u0027t take that, but he did take my Jell-O. Cherry. It looked like fresh blood on his teeth as he wolfed it down. He narrowed his eyes at me as he licked a streak of red from his bottom lip. \"You\u0027re not afraid of me, are you, asshole?\"\\n\\n I took another bite and chewed it. Bullies only heard what they wanted to hear. I wasn\u0027t going to waste my time.\\n\\n He leaned in, his breath hot and smelling of meat and cherry. \"I\u0027ll make you afraid. You got that? I\u0027ll make you so goddamn afraid you\u0027ll piss your pants.\" He snatched up his tray and stalked away.\\n\\n Trouble, he was big trouble. Maybe the first trouble I couldn\u0027t get around. Crazy is crazy, and crazy never learns. He\u0027d keep coming and coming until he caught me or backed me in a corner. I didn\u0027t want to be looking over my shoulder every minute. I didn\u0027t want him watching me. I stabbed my fork in my french fries. I was going to have to do something. That something being not letting Jed beat the shit out of me and stay out of trouble.\\n\\n There was a trick.\\n\\n \"Hey, Nicky, you hanging out with Jaws?\" Isaac sat across from me, chin propped in his hand.\\n\\n Jed definitely had the teeth for the nickname, but no one had ever called him that to his face. \"Nah, just my turn on his list.\" Isaac frowned. His parents had come over from Mexico and he\u0027d already had his turn over that with Jed.\\n\\n \"Oh shit,\" he said, wincing. \"Whatcha going to do?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know yet.\" I dropped my fork. \"Guess I\u0027ll have to think about it. Sneak through the woods home until he figures that out.\"\\n\\n After the last class, I bolted into the woods. They were thick and deep, full of poison ivy and tangles of blackberry bushes that would tear you to pieces if you tried to push through. I managed. Scratches were scratches. They\u0027d fade quick enough. And I\u0027d avoided Jed.\\n\\n This time.\\n\\n The next afternoon I was at the store looking for a present for Tessa. I scowled at the Santa ringing the bell by the door. One more reminder . . . everywhere you looked. Skinny or with sagging beards and worn black boots or faded red pants. Fakes. It made the whole season fake.\\n\\n But there were only two more days until Christmas Eve and I couldn\u0027t put off shopping anymore. I couldn\u0027t get Tessa what she really wanted, so I wandered up and down the doll aisle. It was amazing. They had dolls that walked and talked, crawled and cried, ate and pooped. Why would anyone want a toy that threw up on you while you changed its diaper? That was crazy. But Mom sent me out with a list and one of these nasty things was on it. I picked up the nearest one. It only talked and waved its arms, no puking involved. That was the one.\\n\\n \"Playing with dollies now,\" Jed purred from behind me. \"Why not? You run like a goddamn girl. You might as well play like one, too.\" His hand circled my arm above my elbow so hard it cut the blood off. I felt the tingle in my fingers.\\n\\n Jed had been behind me in the woods yesterday afternoon, but he didn\u0027t know them like I did. He\u0027d come closer than I\u0027d have thought, though. He just didn\u0027t care. Pain was nothing to him. ping through blackberry bushes, sliding down ravines. He was one scratched, bruised mess now, and wasn\u0027t that too bad? I might try and stay out of trouble but there was no way I was sorry about that.\\n\\n I ignored him, yanked my arm away, and took the doll to the checkout counter. He followed me every step of the way. \"You can\u0027t run forever, Nicky,\" he whispered. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck ruffle in the god-awful stench of his breath. \"No one\u0027s ever gotten away. And when I\u0027m done with you and you hide like a little bitch every time you see me, I\u0027ll make your little sister sorry, too. Her and her dolly.\"\\n\\n And that was that.\\n\\n I\u0027d put it off. I\u0027d tried to stay out of trouble. I\u0027d tried not to piss off Mom and Dad. But you couldn\u0027t let the assholes win, even crazy ones like Jed. I sat in a plastic chair by the door, eyes on the floor, until Jed gave up and left. And I never said a word to him.\\n\\n There were kids that hated Jed. Lots of kids. If I could get all of them to join together and stand up to him, Jed might not be as tough as he thought he was. I could give it a try, but the thing about being beaten down . . . it\u0027s hard to get back up. I\u0027d been to four schools now, Dad\u0027s job kept us traveling, and each school had a bully. Sometimes the bully would get caught and punished, but half the time it didn\u0027t matter. In weeks he would go back to doing what he did. The kids wouldn\u0027t stand up for themselves and hardly any of them would tell. They just took the bullying, sure the teachers couldn\u0027t help them. They were right. If the principal kicked the bully out of school, then he\u0027d simply wait outside it.\\n\\n My dad said in life there were sheep and wolves, and most of the time they couldn\u0027t cross over.\\n\\n I sighed. Jed damn sure seemed like he thought he was a wolf. He was nuts as they came. He\u0027d keep coming after me, going after the others, start messing with Tess. I folded the top of the bag the doll was in and got up. Nope, it probably wouldn\u0027t work, no matter how many kids Jed had given reason to hate him, but I\u0027d give it a shot. There had to be some that\u0027d band together against Jed. Hell, it always worked in the movies.\\n\\n Right?\\n\\n Wrong.\\n\\n Isaac peered through black bangs at me in disbelief. \"The guy\u0027s not human, okay? When he stomps you, it\u0027s like he\u0027s never gonna stop. He could take on Frankenstein, the Mummy, and the Werewolf all at once and go out for pizza after.\" Isaac was a huge fan of horror movies. He\u0027d seen ones made before I was born, before my parents were born. The inside of his locker door was covered with pictures of monsters. Snarling, crouching, flying, sucking blood. They papered every square inch. I liked Isaac but he was a little weird.\\n\\n \"Come on.\" I stood at his locker and snorted, \"He\u0027s not all that.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Nicky, he is all that. He caught me in the woods and he broke my arm, okay? And he said if I told anyone how it happened, he\u0027d break the other one. I believed him because he meant it.\" He slammed the locker shut. \"No way. Leave me out of it. He\u0027s crazy, and if you had any sense, you\u0027d be watching behind you every minute.\" With that he hurried down the hall.\\n\\n I gave up on Isaac and went on to Dog Boy . . . Sammy, I meant. Sammy. Five words out of my mouth and he was gone, fast as any of his dogs. It went that way all day. I\u0027d expected it, but I\u0027d hoped it\u0027d be different.\\n\\n Isaac had said Jed had caught him in the woods, the same ones Jed had chased me in. Jed didn\u0027t do his fighting on campus. That\u0027d get him expelled and he knew it. Yeah, it would get him expelled - him, not me.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t have the little in that I had with Principal Johnson. Good old Principal Johnson, not the brightest man to choke on chalk dust.\\n\\n So I went to Plan B. That day when Jed, who was dependable as Cs in math, sat down opposite me in the cafeteria and took my slice of pizza, I picked up my tray, dumped the food off of it, and whacked him hard on the side of the head with it.\\n\\n It knocked him sideways, almost off the seat, but he caught himself with one hand on the table. His eyes were ice, his teeth bared, and violence shivered under his skin. \"Who\u0027s the bitch now?\" I asked quietly. \"You gonna roll over and take it? Or you gonna stand up and do something about it?\" He\u0027d been barely smart enough not to fight in school before, but this was a whole lot of different.\\n\\n As plans went, it wasn\u0027t as idiotic as it seemed. There were teachers already moving toward us. They\u0027d pull him off me before he got me too bad. And then out he\u0027d go. Maybe it\u0027d only be outside the school itself but that was something.\\n\\n He shook with black anger, but as crazy as he was, he wasn\u0027t as stupid as I thought. I might not get expelled if there was a fight, but he knew he would. And I had a feeling his daddy would be a whole lot more disappointed than mine. I had a feeling Jed was a chip off the old block.\\n\\n He stood and hissed, \"Dead. You\u0027re dead.\"\\n\\n He left the cafeteria and I sighed. Another plan shot to hell. Glumly I sat back down and waited for a teacher to come drag me off to Principal Johnson for a few weeks of detention.\\n\\n It was actually two months.\\n\\n After a lot of clutching at his comb-over of black hair and warnings on how he couldn\u0027t cover up things like this - he simply couldn\u0027t - he did. Like I knew he would. I was going to have to call Mom to go fetch Tessa from the bus stop and she wasn\u0027t going to be happy at the reason why. Understanding maybe, but not happy.\\n\\n The same day, after two hours of detention, as I slid through the woods, I heard Jed behind me. This time was the first time I actually heard him howling with fury as he chased me. I might\u0027ve been chunky and short, but I was quick. I had hit that gym door running. Jed hadn\u0027t been as fast.\\n\\n \"You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Where are you?\" All that was followed by screams of rage. Incoherent animal sounds. Isaac was right. Jed did sound like a monster . . . a movie monster anyway. I slid under a thick overhang of dead blackberry vines and thought how I definitely hadn\u0027t made things any better. Not to say whacking him with a tray hadn\u0027t felt good, but it hadn\u0027t gotten me out of the trouble I thought it would.\\n\\n Although, it really, really had felt good.\\n\\n Finally I climbed a tree, my brown jacket blending in with the bark, and held still as he passed like a rabid Doberman beneath me. Swear to God, there was foam flying from his mouth as he screamed for me.\\n\\n You skip a few Ritalin and things just go to hell.\\n\\n Right. Like you could blame that kind of nuts on a little ADHD. I hugged the tree, rested my head against it, and stayed there for an hour. It was cold, but I didn\u0027t mind the cold. And it got dark, but I didn\u0027t mind that either. As far as monsters went, Jed\u0027s night vision must not have been too hot. He didn\u0027t hang around. I heard his last howl nearly a half mile away and then nothing again.\\n\\n I finally climbed down and went home to face two things a lot worse than Jed: Mom and Dad. Dad ripped me a new one over detention. It didn\u0027t matter why I got it. Skorazys didn\u0027t make waves, didn\u0027t get noticed. Our grandparents and their grandparents had learned that over in Russia. Keep your head down or lose it altogether.\\n\\n After the yelling was over, the worst came. Mom wanted me to help her and Tessa make Christmas cookies for Santa. When I wandered into the kitchen, Tess turned out to be making her \"Merry Christmas, Santa\" note in her room, all tongue and crooked crayon writing, as Mom roped me in. \"You\u0027ll have a good time, Nicky,\" she said, smiling. She was a great mom, a pretty one, too, even with flour streaked across one cheek. Dark blond hair worn in a braid just past her shoulders, violet eyes, and a scar that bisected one eyebrow that only made her look curious all the time. I loved my mom. I know I was thirteen and not supposed to think things like that, but I did.\\n\\n But she wanted me to make cookies for Santa? \"You know there\u0027s no Santa, Mom,\" I grumped. \"This whole Christmas thing\" - I opened a bag of chocolate chips - \"it\u0027s a waste of time.\"\\n\\n A spoon smacked my hand. \"The holiday spirit is in your heart. It\u0027s not about presents and shiny paper. Christmas is in you.\" She poked a finger in my chest. \"And Santa is everywhere you look. If only you would look.\" She shook her head, smiled again, and dabbed my nose with cookie batter. I rolled my eyes and wiped it off with a finger, which I licked clean. \"Now,\" she said firmly, \"make your sister happy and help with the cookies. She\u0027ll be out here any minute.\"\\n\\n And it wasn\u0027t so bad. I didn\u0027t believe in any of it anymore, but Mom and Tess laughed. Dad came in and we ended up having a cookie batter fight. It might\u0027ve not been the real thing, but it was as close as you could get.\\n\\n Right then, that was good enough.\\n\\n The next day was the day before Christmas Eve, our last day of school before break. And my last day, I had a feeling, to figure things out with Jed. But first Mary Francesca tried to figure out things with me.\\n\\n I\u0027d seen her around, Mary Francesca . . . never just Mary or Fran . . . Mary Francesca. She was in some of my classes. She seemed nice, funny. She had red hair that fell in a mass of curls past her shoulders, bright red freckles, even brighter blue eyes, and she was smart. Definitely smarter than I was. No Cs in math for her.\\n\\n She cornered me outside English, smiling. Her teeth were so bright I swore I could see my reflection. \"Hey, Nick.\"\\n\\n Nick. Not Nicky. I liked that.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I said back. That was about it for me, conversation-wise. I mean, a pretty girl. What do you say?\\n\\n She didn\u0027t have any problem. \"I was wondering . . .\" She leaned a little closer and I could smell strawberries and cream shampoo. \"I was wondering if maybe you\u0027d want to go to the Christmas dance with me?\" I felt crushing disappointment and utter relief all at the same time. On the one hand, I wouldn\u0027t have to worry about clothes and flowers and talking and dancing. I\u0027d seen what they did on MTV. No way I could do that and not get a boner right on the floor.\\n\\n On the other hand, I liked Mary Francesca.\\n\\n Not that it mattered how funny or smart she was or that she smelled like strawberries. There was no way my parents would go for it. It went back to the bad old days when persecution was everywhere. You couldn\u0027t trust strangers, secret police were around every corner, and you never knew who might turn you in. It was a lesson no one in the family had forgotten. We were Orthodox all the way and we didn\u0027t date outsiders. Which was going to make finding a prom date pretty damn hard. There were lots of us in Russia, not too many here. But those were the rules.\\n\\n I added that to Christmas and bullies in the whole sucking category.\\n\\n \"Sorry.\" I shifted my backpack from one side to another, and I really was sorry. \"I have detention for two months. My parents won\u0027t let me go anywhere. I\u0027m grounded, damn, forever.\"\\n\\n She frowned in disappointment - real disappointment, which made me again think how rules sucked. \"Well, okay, I get that.\" Sighing, she unhooked a pin from her sweater and pinned it on mine. \"Maybe by Spring Fling then.\" She looked around quickly, then leaned in to give me the quickest of kisses.\\n\\n I was wrong. It wasn\u0027t her hair that smelled like strawberries; it was her lip gloss. I was still tasting it as she disappeared down the hall and around the corner. Then I looked down at the pin. Santa grinned up at me, mittened hand waving automatically.\\n\\n Ho frigging ho.\\n\\n Every class dragged minute by minute. No one stared at me like I was going to die, so no one knew this was the day Jed was coming after me. It didn\u0027t matter. I knew. I passed him once in the hall and his eyes had never been paler. He didn\u0027t grin, he didn\u0027t smirk. He just stared, flecks of spit at the corner of his mouth. That was it. Jed had gone off the edge and there was no coming back for him. Did a teacher notice? No. Did big men in white coats come drag him off to a big looming building with the baby eaters and mailman killers? No. No one wanted to know.\\n\\n No one ever wanted to know.\\n\\n A Plan C would be good now. Really good.\\n\\n Jed was a year older, but he\u0027d been left behind. He tripped me in math class on my way up to the board, his almost white eyes daring me to say something about it. I went on, did the calculation, and circled back another way to sit down.\\n\\n When I ate lunch, he ate at a table next to mine and watched me. Watched my every move, my every bite. Half-chewed food fell from his mouth as he kept his eyes on me, but he didn\u0027t notice. Or care. I\u0027d thought he\u0027d grow up to be a serial killer, but I was wrong. He was already there and he had me marked as victim numero uno.\\n\\n What do you do then? Go out kicking and screaming? Not me. I so did not plan on that.\\n\\n Next time I passed him in the hall, I murmured, \"Tomorrow. Northeast edge of the woods. By the bridge.\" I didn\u0027t wait on an answer. For all I knew, he\u0027d chewed his tongue off already and wasn\u0027t going to give me one anyway. Then I went straight to the nurse\u0027s office, faked a stomach cramp and a little dry heaving, and had my mom picking me up in twenty minutes. Today was taken care of. Jed wasn\u0027t going to jump me early. And tomorrow . . .\\n\\n A man\u0027s gotta do what a man\u0027s gotta do.\\n\\n A guy on an old Western had said that once. He was right. I wasn\u0027t a man, but it still counted for me, too. I spent the night in my room thinking. I took off that silly Santa pin Mary Francesca had given me and almost tossed it, but at the last minute I laid it on my desk. The mitten continued to wave at me and I wondered how long until the battery ran out.\\n\\n I went out once to the garage after the folks were asleep then came back and watched the stars and sliver of moon through my window. The cold air made them brighter, closer, until you could see the teeth in the moon\u0027s sly grin and the cold patience behind the stars\u0027 eyes.\\n\\n After an hour of that, I went back in and stared at my closet. My last real Christmas was in there. It made me sad, proud, and had me pining all at the same time. Finally I put on my boxers and T-shirt and went to bed. I dreamed of cookies, presents, and a thousand lighted trees, and behind each tree was a Santa. He was laughing, cheeks red, stomach bouncing. A thousand Santas wherever you looked.\\n\\n When I woke up in the morning, I had one of those things . . . oh shit, what is it? . . . an epiphany. A big word for a big idea. I knew what to do, how to do it, and if I did things just right, just so, it would turn out even better than I thought yesterday. It would be better than okay. It would.\\n\\n It had to.\\n\\n I ate lunch with Mom, Dad, and Tess. Let Jed freeze his ass off in the woods waiting for me. I was in no hurry. Afterward I grabbed my coat and backpack and said I\u0027d be back. Grounding was grounding, but my dad thought that roaming in the woods was good for kids. Taught them things. Toughened them up.\\n\\n I set off down our gravel road. The sky was white and gray and blue. Might be snow, might clear up. That was the fun thing about winter: it was always a surprise. I wore faded jeans and my rattiest sneakers. You never knew what was going to happen to them, not with someone like Jed. I liked the sneakers. We\u0027d got them in San Antonio . . . they were orange with the black outline of a coyote howling at the moon. It was the same kind of moon we\u0027d had last night. Narrow and hungry.\\n\\n I hefted the backpack and tried not to think about that. I had to do what I had to do. Thinking about things like that - it wasn\u0027t good. It wasn\u0027t good for the plan or for Tess or for me. I kept on walking, new snow crunching under my rubber soles. We\u0027d had lots of snow lately, at least a few feet of it. Blue Water Creek was the size of a small river now. You could toss a stick in that and it would be gone before your eyes could follow it.\\n\\n Thirty minutes later I reached where I\u0027d told Jed to meet me. He was there. Like he wouldn\u0027t be. If I was stupid enough to walk right up to him, he wasn\u0027t going to turn me down. He looked up from the struggling bundle of fur he had at his feet. The grin he gave me was colder than the snow under my feet. \"Brought you a present, shithead.\"\\n\\n Tied to a tree he had a dog. From the smell of the wet fur, it was soaked in paint thinner and Jed was trying to get a lighter to spark. He was trying to catch a dog on fire . . . on fire, just to piss me off before he finished me. That was the kind of sick asshole he was.\\n\\n \"I like dogs a lot,\" I said flatly. \"I don\u0027t like you at all.\"\\n\\n Jed had parked his bike on the edge of the swollen Blue Water Creek. I turned and kicked it into the flood. The bike was carried away instantly. That was why the adults told us to stay away from the creek: it was over the banks, it was icy cold, and it could drown you in an instant.\\n\\n \"Whoops,\" I said cheerfully. \"You should\u0027ve listened when they said stay away from the water.\"\\n\\n He growled, \"You goddamn son of a bitch. You don\u0027t know who you\u0027re dealing with, asshole. I\u0027m going to make you wish you were dead. Hell, I\u0027m going to make you dead.\" The pale eyes glowed with hatred as he shoved the lighter in his pocket. He picked up a baseball bat that had been hidden in the brush and rushed me, Louisville Slugger swinging. I caught it before it landed, ripped it out of his hands, whirled, and swung for the bleachers. He went down like Ms. Finkelstein on Principal Johnson.\\n\\n Hard and fast.\\n\\n Like I said, I got sent to the principal a lot, and he didn\u0027t always lock the door. Grown-ups could be stupid, too. Which was why skipping class and zero tolerance for violence were a little less zero for me. Principal Johnson was good with the excuses for the school board, and Ms. Finkelstein, the secretary, handed candy out to me like she was trying to make me diabetic.\\n\\n I was hungry and getting hungrier - one lunch was never enough for me. My family . . . we liked to eat. I pulled one of Ms. Finkelstein\u0027s Tootsie Rolls out of my pocket and chewed on it while I nudged Jed with my sneaker. He was still breathing. That was good. He mumbled and started to twitch, his arms moving and hands digging at the dirt. I smacked him again with the bat at the base of the skull. A tap this time . . . just enough to do the job. Then I untied the dog. It had tags that said it lived and was loved only about five blocks from the woods. It knew its way home. First it dropped and bared a submissive stomach. I rubbed it lightly, washed off the paint thinner with snow, then let it jump up. I smiled as it bounded off homeward. I did like dogs . . . yapping, jumping, leg humping. It didn\u0027t matter. All dogs were good dogs.\\n\\n I duct taped Jed\u0027s ankles, wrists, and mouth before waiting until long after dark to carry him through the woods. I didn\u0027t want to leave drag marks, and I scuffed my feet and doubled back enough times that no one could\u0027ve made heads or tails of our trail. Jed was easy enough to haul even though he weighed more than me. Really easy. Shit floats. I guess assholes did, too. He woke up again. I was almost home, so I let him stay awake. He moaned, snarled, and tried to yell under the tape. That was Jed for you. A complainer. Bitch, bitch, bitch.\\n\\n And dumb as a box of rocks. I\u0027d given him every chance and he\u0027d never taken one of them.\\n\\n Our house was only a mile or two from the woods at the end of our long gravel lane. The nearest neighbor was half a mile away. It was nice. Quiet. Private.\\n\\n Really private.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll find your bike in the creek,\" I said to the struggling Jed. \"They\u0027ll think you drowned. Think your body got wedged under somewhere. Who knows? Maybe it took you all the way to the river. Everyone will pretend to be sad.\" I looked back at him and smiled. \"But no one will be.\"\\n\\n Christmas Eve. I pulled Jed through the door into the blinking lights of the Christmas tree, the stockings on the mantel, the milk and cookies sat oh so carefully on the table. Tessa had left out milk and cookies for three years now. Third time\u0027s the charm.\\n\\n Mom and Dad sat waiting on the couch for me. It was almost eleven - close to Christmas. Close enough. Tess would\u0027ve long gone to bed. \"That\u0027s where you\u0027ve been.\" Mom shook her head affectionately. Boys will be boys.\\n\\n \"Anyone see you?\" Dad demanded bluntly. \"Any trouble?\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Dad, you taught me better than that.\" I dumped Jed at the bottom of the fireplace before going to my room. I opened my closet door and rummaged through softball mitts, balls, games I\u0027d outgrown but never thrown away until I found it buried in a corner: the polished skull. It had been pretty stinky for quite a while, but it wasn\u0027t the kind of stink my kind minded. I pulled the dusty red cap with the pom-pom off of it and shook it out, trying not to sneeze. These were the only things left. The reindeer venison was long gone. Around the base of the skull were handfuls of white hair, once curly and soft, now wiry and sparse. It didn\u0027t matter. It\u0027d work. I also picked up a tattered white trimmed red jacket. At the last I grabbed the glue from my desk and went back to the living room.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a good brother.\" Mom smiled, pleased.\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah.\" I ducked my head in embarrassment as I jammed the Santa hat on Jed\u0027s head, draped the red jacket over the top of him, and glued the hair to his chin and jaws. He wasn\u0027t too helpful there, whipping his head back and forth. But I got the job done. I even pinned Mary Francesca\u0027s Santa pin to the jacket. It was the perfect touch.\\n\\n Hungry, hungry, hungry, but he wasn\u0027t for me.\\n\\n I picked up three cookies, ripped the tape off his mouth, and jammed them in there before he could get a word or a scream out. He turned slightly blue as he choked and coughed. I thought it\u0027d keep his mouth shut long enough.\\n\\n \"Tess,\" I yelled. \"Come on. Hurry up. He\u0027s here!\"\\n\\n After a second there was the sound of feet in footie pajamas hitting the floor and she came flying out, eyes as wide as they possibly could be when she spotted Jed. \"Santa! Santa! I asked you to come and you\u0027re here! You\u0027re here!\"\\n\\n Six years ago I saw Santa. Seven years ago I\u0027d made my first kill. It soured me on Christmas when I realized there wouldn\u0027t be any more Santas. No more surprises from the chimney. I\u0027d finished that job. Kids, you don\u0027t realize how permanent things are. I was sorry afterward. Sorry I hadn\u0027t waited for my little sister to be old enough to join in on the fun. Sorry she could never have the thrill I\u0027d had.\\n\\n I watched as my little sister grinned big as her pajamas tore away and her skin twitched until fur rippled over her twisting, changing body from muzzle to tail. Her pumpkin orange eyes bright with Christmas spirit as her teeth were suddenly bright with something else as she tore into her present.\\n\\n Mary Francesca\u0027s pin went flying. Wolves were Orthodox. We did only date our own kind. It was too bad. She was cute.\\n\\n On the couch a buff-colored wolf tucked her head under the jaw of a larger black one. Their eyes were brilliant with pride and affection and the spirit of the holiday. Their baby\u0027s first kill. It was always special. I rested my muzzle on my paws and watched as Christmas came back to me.\\n\\n Mom said Christmas wasn\u0027t in presents and trees, glitter and bows. She said it was in your heart and so was Santa if you want him to be. If I really wanted him, I could find him again.\\n\\n Mom was right. Christmas was in your heart. And Santa was everywhere. If you only knew where to look. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolfsbane-and-mistletoe/page-13.html","bookId":2202,"book":{"id":2202,"title":"Wolfsbane and Mistletoe","description":"Storyline: The editors of \"Many Bloody Returns\" deliver the perfect howl-iday gift, with new tales from Patricia Briggs, Carrie Vaughn, and many more. \\n \"New York Times\" bestselling authors Charlaine Harris, Patricia Briggs, Keri Arthur, and Carrie Vaughn—along with eleven other masters of the genre—offer all-new stories on werewolves and the holidays, a fresh variation on the concept that worked so well with birthdays and vampires in \"Many Bloody Returns.\" \\n The holidays can bring out the beast in anyone.
