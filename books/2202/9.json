{"id":101570,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Christmas Past\n Keri Arthur\n Keri\u0027s an Aussie gal who grew up sharing her life with dragons, elves, vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, and the occasional talking horse. Which worried her family to no end. Of course, now that she\u0027s actually making a living sharing her life with the aforementioned creatures, they no longer contemplate calling the men with the short white coats. When not at her keyboard, Keri can be found in front of the TV, or taking her two dogs for a walk.\n Normally, I love Christmas.\n I love decorating my scrawny little tree with tinsel and ornaments, and hanging Christmas lights in every available corner of my one-bedroom apartment. I love making eggnog and baking Christmas gingerbreads, and the way Christmas cheer suddenly fills the usually dour offices of the Para-investigations squad. I even liked battling the Christmas hordes to get the latest \"must-have\" present for my niece and nephews.\n And I\u0027d been looking forward to all that and more this year to make up for the crappiness that had been last year\u0027s Christmas. But it was all starting to go sour again, and it had a whole lot to do with my current situation.\n For a start, it\u0027s hard to feel very Christmassy when you\u0027re standing in an elf costume in the middle of a snowstorm freezing your ass off.\n And okay, it wasn\u0027t exactly a snowstorm - more like a steady sprinkling of the wet white stuff - but when I was dressed in a silly green outfit that wasn\u0027t even fur-lined like a Santa costume would have been, and wearing stupid pointy shoes that jingled annoyingly every time I moved, it might as well have been a storm. Warmth just wasn\u0027t happening.\n But the snow wasn\u0027t the worst of it. I could probably have handled the snow and the cold and the non-appearance of anything resembling a bad guy, if it weren\u0027t for the six-foot, broad-shouldered, dark-haired presence standing deep in the shadows of a doorway ten feet to my left.\n That presence just happened to be Brodie James, werewolf expert and chief investigator for the Para-investigations squad. Owner of a killer smile and a body designed to inspire lust.\n And the man who had dumped me without warning precisely one year ago.\n I blew out a breath and rang the bell with more force than necessary. The cheery sound pealed out across the darkness, but did little to attract the attention of the strangers who scurried past. On a night like this, all anyone wanted to do was get inside. Giving to charity wasn\u0027t even hitting their radar.\n Hell, the fiend who was murdering Christmas collectors probably had more sense than to come out on a night like that.\n Which meant my standing there as bait was every bit as useless as it was feeling.\n \"Ring that bell any harder, and you\u0027ll probably break it,\" Brodie said, his warm, rich voice filled with amusement.\n It was a sound that had filled far too many of my dreams over the last year.\n I didn\u0027t answer him. I might have to work with the rat on this case, but I didn\u0027t have to talk to him any more than necessary. I suppose I just had to be thankful he\u0027d been out of the state on other cases for the better part of the year. I would have had to ask for a transfer if I\u0027d had to deal with him day in and day out.\n And that would have been a damn shame, because I actually liked being a part of the squad. When I wasn\u0027t standing out in a snowstorm freezing my ass off, that was. And it was certainly a job that suited my talent for sensing \"evil\" in people - human or not. The squad was a small pision of the FBI, and we handled any case that held even the remotest hint of paranormal activity. Humans might have accepted the presence of vamps, werewolves, and the other things that went bump in the night, but they sure as hell didn\u0027t like getting involved with them. And the cops were very quick to handball anything mystical.\n Of course, I was human myself, but my talents had always made me feel like an outsider within my own race. Although Brodie dumping me so suddenly hadn\u0027t exactly made me feel wanted by the non-humans.\n \"You have to talk to me eventually,\" he said, shifting position slightly. His rich, spicy aroma stirred through the cold air, bringing on memories of the long nights I\u0027d spent in his arms, breathing in that very same scent.\n I rather violently rattled the tin at a woman running past. She shook her head without even looking at me. It was just as well I wasn\u0027t a proper collector - the children\u0027s charity wouldn\u0027t be doing very well out of me.\n \"What if I say I\u0027m sorry?\" he added eventually.\n \"What if I tell you I don\u0027t care?\" I snapped back, kicking myself mentally for actually breaking my vow of silence, but unable to hold back the words regardless.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t believe it.\"\n I turned around, eyeing the darkness that held him so completely. \"Last Christmas, I cared. This Christmas, I just want to catch our murderer so I can get out of this stupid costume and the snow that is freezing bits of me off, and go enjoy being with my sister and her kids.\"\n I swung away, presenting my back to him again. Which really wasn\u0027t a good thing, because I could still feel his gaze on me. Could feel the heat of it travel up my cold length, warming the ice from my bones and making my pulse skip and dance.\n Where the hell was a murdering Christmas fiend when you really wanted one?\n \"It\u0027s nearly midnight,\" Brodie said. \"Given that our murderer hasn\u0027t shown an inclination to attack and drain anyone after the magic hour, what do you say to us going to find a cafe and some coffee?\"\n \"I\u0027d prefer to go straight back to my apartment.\" Spending more time than necessary in this man\u0027s company was not a good idea. I might not want to talk to him, but there were bits of me that would have been happy to do a whole lot more.\n \"Come on, Hannah,\" he said softly, in that sweet, oh-so-sexy tone that could charm the pants off a virgin. At least, it had charmed the pants of this former virgin. \"Tomorrow\u0027s Christmas Eve. How about showing a little Christmas spirit?\"\n \"Would this be the same Christmas spirit you showed when you dumped me without a by-your-leave?\" I said, ever so nicely.\n \"Ouch,\" he muttered. Then added, \"Did I mention I was sorry for that?\"\n \"I still don\u0027t care.\"\n \"Did I mention I realize I was an ass, but things got so crazy so quickly - \"\n \"I\u0027m still not caring,\" I interrupted, feeling like a broken record.\n Another stranger appeared at the top end of the street. I rang the bell and he looked up briefly, his face ghostly in the darkness. He shook his head and huddled deeper into his coat, before crossing the road and walking down the other side of the footpath. Great, now prospective donors were avoiding me.\n That said a whole lot about my appearance. Or my mood.\n I took a deep breath and tried to look happy about the whole situation.\n I don\u0027t think I succeeded.\n \"Look,\" Brodie tried again. \"I\u0027m a rat, I know, and I don\u0027t really have a good excuse for doing what I did. It was thoughtless and inconsiderate and I\u0027d really like the chance to make it up to you.\"\n No, I told my hormones, which were suddenly dancing at the thought of some hot Brodie action. Remember Christmas past? He\u0027s bad for us. We don\u0027t like him.\n Unfortunately, what came out of my mouth was, \"Why?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s Christmas, and because I\u0027ve missed you horribly.\"\n Of all the damn things to say, I thought, as my treacherous heart did a little sideways lurch. It was just as well parts of me were still holding on to anger, otherwise I\u0027d be putty in his hands. And oh, wouldn\u0027t his hands feel so good.\n \"Yeah, you missed me so horribly,\" I replied, irritated at myself, \"that you couldn\u0027t pick up a phone and talk to me.\"\n \"I did,\" he said mildly. \"You hung up on me. Several times.\"\n Oh. Yeah. \"That was when I was in my hurt and angry stage. You should have tried once I\u0027d rolled into my not caring stage. You might have had more luck.\"\n \"You\u0027ve been saying you don\u0027t care for the last ten minutes, and I\u0027m still having no luck.\"\n \"That\u0027s because I\u0027ve now rolled into the no-longer-caring-but-aiming-to-make-you-grovel stage. It\u0027s just not your night, I\u0027m afraid.\"\n \"Ah,\" he said, the deepening amusement in his rich tones making my toes curl ever so slightly. \"And if I do grovel? Will that get you sharing a cup of coffee with me?\"\n \"No, because I can\u0027t stand men who beg.\" The wind chose that moment to blast down the street. I hunched my shoulders against it and wondered if my legs were turning as blue as they felt.\n Maybe coffee was a good idea.\n No. He\u0027s bad for our health and we don\u0027t like him, remember?\n Across the street, the pale-faced stranger grabbed the fly-away ends of his coat and wrapped them around his body, his hands so white they almost appeared skeletal.\n Gloves, I thought, even as a chill ran down my spine. Had to be. No hands were that white, no matter how cold. Unless you were a vampire.\n My psychic radar hadn\u0027t yet sensed anything out of the ordinary, but I\u0027d learned long ago never to ignore the little niggles of wrongness - and that man across the street definitely felt wrong.\n \"Does he smell funny to you?\" I asked Brodie softly.\n There was a sharp intake of breath, and I had a vision of his nostrils flaring, sucking in the scents of the night and rolling them across his taste buds, sorting and categorizing them. I\u0027d seen him do it a hundred times in the few months we\u0027d been together, and I found it as sexy now as I had then. Which was odd, because until I\u0027d met him, I\u0027d never considered nostrils to be remotely alluring.\n But then, the whole package connected to this man\u0027s nostrils was beyond fine.\n \"He reeks of booze and cigarettes.\" Another intake of breath. \"And he hasn\u0027t washed for a few days, either.\"\n \"So he\u0027s not the scent you\u0027ve caught at the last three crime scenes?\"\n \"No.\" He hesitated. \"It\u0027s similar, though, meaning he could be related to our killer.\"\n \"Being related doesn\u0027t mean he knows anything about the killings.\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t mean he doesn\u0027t, either.\"\n The stranger lumbered sideways, crashing shoulder first into a wall. He muttered something I couldn\u0027t catch, then glanced over his shoulder.\n Our gazes met, and my psychic senses roared to life. There was no life in that blue gaze, but there was unlife. And hatred, so much hatred, mixed with anger, and the need to shed blood and taste revenge.\n But, deeper than that, there was evil. The sort of evil that likes to rip and tear and drain.\n \"He may not smell exactly like our quarry,\" I whispered. \"But I\u0027m sure he\u0027s connected to these murders somehow.\"\n The words were barely out of my mouth when the vampire snarled. I had a brief glimpse of shattered, broken canines, then he pushed away from the wall and started running. Brodie leapt out of the shadows, stripping off his clothes as he ran, his lean, powerful form shifting, changing, until what was running in front of me was wolf rather than human.\n A shiver ran through my soul. I\u0027d seen him do that a hundred times, too, and I still found it awe-inspiring.\n \"Wait for me!\"\n But of course he didn\u0027t. He was a werewolf, after all, and few of them bothered with rules, regulations, or half-shouted requests unless it really suited them.\n I swore softly and threw the bell and collection box into the shadowed corner where he\u0027d been standing, then grabbed the stakes and his clothes, and ran after him, the bells on my shoes ringing happily across the night with each step. I felt like a one-person Christmas band.\n We bolted up the road and around a corner. The suspect was fast, his spindly arms and legs pumping like a runner in a race, his black coat flying out behind him, looking a little like black wings. But for every step he took, Brodie was taking two or three and he was gaining fast.\n The vamp skidded left into a side road. Four seconds later, Brodie\u0027s sleek wolf form disappeared after him. I was six seconds behind them both, sliding around the corner in a jingle of bells, only to have to suddenly leap over the still-wolf form that was Brodie.\n \"Where is he?\" I said, standing beside him and frowning into the dark and silent side street.\n He shifted shape, then said, \"I lost him.\" He held up the stranger\u0027s black coat. \"This is what I smelled. He was using it to cover his own scent. There\u0027s obviously some poor wino out there now freezing his nuts off.\"\n \"If he hasn\u0027t been drained.\" My gaze met his. The green eyes were flat and annoyed. \"How could you lose him?\"\n \"Because werewolves can\u0027t fly.\"\n My gaze went skyward. All I saw was darkness and wet white stuff. \"Vampires can\u0027t, either.\"\n \"Well, apparently no one told this murdering son of a bitch that. I should have stayed in human form and shot the bastard.\" He grabbed his clothes and started dressing.\n \"Shooting vamps doesn\u0027t kill them.\"\n And this vamp had an execution order on him. While most non-humans had rights to courts, lawyers, and justice, vamps were the exception. When they killed, an execution order was placed on their heads. No ifs, buts, or maybes. It was our job to serve it - which was the one huge difference between our squad and the rest of the FBI.\n \"It would have stopped him enough for me to catch the bastard.\"\n \"Trouble is, we only have my instincts saying he\u0027s connected to our vamp. He isn\u0027t our killer, because his canines were smashed and our victims had neat bite wounds.\"\n \"If you say he\u0027s connected, that\u0027s good enough for me.\" Brodie caught my arm and swung me around, his fingers so warm they just about branded my arm. \"But let\u0027s get this coat back to the labs so they can double-check. Then once we make our report, we can go get that coffee we were discussing.\"\n \"It\u0027s going to take more than coffee to make me talk pleasantly to you,\" I said as we walked - or in my case, jingled - back to his car.\n He raised an eyebrow, a smile breaking through the annoyance and tugging at his luscious lips. \"What if I add the sweetener of cake?\"\n I\u0027m an idiot for even considering this. \"Depends on the cake.\"\n \"Carrot?\"\n I snorted. \"Get real. It has to at least be triple chocolate. With fresh cream.\"\n \"Done.\" He opened the car and ushered me inside, then he bagged the coat while I radioed headquarters, asking them to research flying vamps and where they might have come from. The boss wasn\u0027t too happy about us losing our quarry, but hey, when vamps decide to grow wings and fly, there wasn\u0027t a whole lot a werewolf and a human could do about it.\n Brodie started the car and turned the heater on to full. Cold air blasted down onto my toes, making them feel icier than ever.\n \"Gee, thanks,\" I muttered, shifting my feet out of the way.\n \"It\u0027ll warm up in a minute,\" he said.\n \"I won\u0027t,\" I said, and wondered even as I said it just how true it was. I mean, he hadn\u0027t even gotten serious about trying to seduce me, and here I was about to go for coffee with him. If he went too much further, just how quickly would the ice in my soul melt?\n Too damn quickly. The specter of Christmas past, it seemed, wasn\u0027t the shield I was hoping it might be, despite all my defiant words earlier.\n \"How are we going to catch a vampire who can fly? And how can a vamp even manage to do that?\" I added, hoping work talk would distract my thoughts from the man sitting far too close.\n \"It\u0027s likely he has shifter in his background. Not all vamps come from human stock, though it is the most common source. And we catch him by spotting him earlier, and chasing him harder.\" He glanced at me as he ran an amber light. \"You got a change of clothes back at headquarters?\"\n \"No.\" Stupidly, I\u0027d gone straight from home to the stakeout site. \"Hopefully, we can get the reports done quickly so I can get home and get warm.\"\n He glanced at me, and the twinkle in his eyes was all too familiar. Plans were being made, plans that undoubtedly involved me and nakedness. But all he said was, \"How come you didn\u0027t sense what he was when he first appeared?\"\n \"Because it doesn\u0027t always work like that.\" I reached around and grabbed my coat from the backseat, wrapping it around my legs blanket-style but feeling no warmer. \"I sometimes sense the evil in people very quickly, but it often takes something like eye contact to actually feel what they are.\" I glanced at him. \"But you know all that.\"\n \"Last case we worked together, you were getting squat about a guy who\u0027d killed nine people. I thought maybe that was a sign that your psychic gifts were burning out.\"\n Burnout was a problem in the squad - though it was often a case of the people burning out more than the actual gifts. So far it had not been a problem for me, but then, simply feeling the evil in someone\u0027s soul was a whole lot different from actually sharing their darkest dreams and desires - as some in the squad could.\n \"It\u0027s hard to find the evil in someone\u0027s soul when they haven\u0027t got a soul,\" I said. \"Just like it\u0027s hard to find someone\u0027s heart when they haven\u0027t got one.\"\n \"I have a heart,\" he said, keeping his gaze on the road. \"I just didn\u0027t use it very wisely.\"\n Ouch, I thought silently, and looked out the window. We drove the rest of the way in silence. Once back at headquarters, Brodie carted the evidence down to forensics, and I quickly typed up a report. There wasn\u0027t much to tell, so it didn\u0027t take long. We were in and out inside an hour.\n \"Now, let\u0027s get that coffee,\" Brodie said, as he opened the car door for me.\n \"I\u0027d really rather go home,\" I said, shivering a little despite the thermal thickness of my coat. The building may have been heated, but it hadn\u0027t done a lot to chase the chill away from my skin. \"Besides, I\u0027m wet and I\u0027m dressed as an elf. Not the sort of outfit any respectable person would wear to a nice cafe.\"\n \"Nonsense. You look lovely in it.\" He slammed the door shut and climbed in the other side of the car. \"And I promised you cake. I intend to keep that promise.\"\n \"Yeah, it would be this one,\" I muttered.\n He ignored me and drove out of the parking lot. I watched the world go by, half of me wanting to play it safe and go home, but the other half - the foolish half - wanting his company, however dangerous that might be to my emotional health. Unfortunately, the foolish half was winning the war.\n \"Hey, we just passed a perfectly respectable-looking cafe.\"\n \"Is mere respectable going to gain me a smile?\"\n \"Not even triple chocolate cake with fresh cream is going to gain you that, my friend.\"\n \"My friend?\" He glanced at me, eyebrows raised. \"That\u0027s better than rat. Or what was it you called me the other day? During that brief moment you deigned to speak to me?\"\n \"I called you a stinking love rat,\" I muttered. \"And let\u0027s not make this about what I\u0027ve done. You\u0027re the one who left me, not the other way around.\"\n \"And I do believe I have apologized profusely for that.\" He slowed down for a red light, then added, \"And, technically speaking, the term love rat does not apply, because I have never loved anyone else.\"\n Again my heart did that treacherous little lurch. Calm down, stupid. He didn\u0027t mean it that way. He left you, remember? That doesn\u0027t infer love in any way, shape, or form.\n \"That\u0027s not what the office talk is.\"\n \"You should know better than to listen to office talk. After all, they had us married off within three weeks of us starting to date.\"\n So did I. Of course, we\u0027d only lasted a total of six weeks. I looked away and blinked back tears. Damn it, this is why it was a bad idea to speak to him.\n He pulled into a side street, and began to slow the car down. Old two-story houses rubbed shoulders with interesting little shops, but none of them resembled a cafe or anything actually open.\n \"Here we are,\" he said, stopping the car in front of a pretty blue and white two-story building.\n \"And where is here?\" I asked, looking up at the window boxes filled with greenery.\n \"Mom\u0027s,\" he said, and got out of the car.\n \"What?\" But I was talking to thin air. Or thick air, in his case. I waited until he opened my door and added, \"I am not going inside to meet your mother.\"\n Especially when she had totally disapproved of me and Brodie going out.\n \"Well, good, because she\u0027s not there. No one is. They\u0027re all at my gran\u0027s for the night.\"\n He took my hand and tugged lightly. I remained right where I was.\n \"Then why are we even here? You know how your mom feels about me.\"\n \"That isn\u0027t a problem anymore, trust me. Besides, you wanted triple chocolate with fresh cream, and my mom bakes the best you\u0027ll ever taste. Come on.\"\n He tugged harder, leaving me with little choice. With the bells on my feet ringing joyously, I untangled my legs from my coat and got out.\n \"We need to get you some decent clothes,\" he said, his gaze sweeping me critically but still managing to leave me feeling all hot and bothered. \"You look rather cold and wet.\"\n He opened the gate and began leading me up the garden path. In more ways than one, I suspected.\n \"That\u0027s because I am cold and wet. And I have perfectly decent clothes waiting for me at home. You need to take me back there.\"\n \"If I do, you won\u0027t come back here.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"So, all the progress I\u0027ve made this evening will go sliding away, and I\u0027ll be back to being the rat.\"\n \"But you\u0027ve never stopped being the rat,\" I said sweetly. \"So what\u0027s the problem?\"\n He laughed, a warm rich sound that slid across my skin as sensuously as a caress. He opened the door and waved me inside. I slid past and tried without success to ignore the tangy heat of him. The way my body ached to press forward just that little bit more, and feel all that heat against my skin.\n Hello, last Christmas? Remember that? Remember the whole he\u0027s a bad man and we don\u0027t like him spiel?\n I remembered. Unfortunately, I also remembered how good it felt being with him, and no matter how much I told myself I was just setting myself up for more heartache, I couldn\u0027t help the need to soak in the warmth of his presence one more time.\n You\u0027re a sap. And an idiot.\n And it\u0027s Christmas, and I\u0027m lonely.\n It was dark inside the house, but the air was warm and smelled ever so slightly of baking. I sniffed lightly as I hung my coat up on the nearby hook. While the hints of ginger and vanilla were strong, they were underlined by an animal mustiness, and it was a strong reminder that this wasn\u0027t any ordinary house. That this was the abode of werewolves.\n He caught my hand, his fingers so warm against mine. \"This way.\" He led me up a set of stairs and into a bathroom. \"There\u0027s clean towels on the shelf above the bath, and a clean robe behind the door.\"\n \"Brodie - \"\n He stopped the words with a short, sharp kiss that left me breathless and yet wanting more. \"I\u0027ll have coffee and cake waiting downstairs.\"\n And with that, he left me standing there, staring in shock at the back of a door. This night was so not going to plan. Well, not to my plans, at least. It was becoming a little obvious that he had a whole lot more planned for his Christmas than just catching a killer.\n I blew out a breath and began to strip off. I had two choices - stay or leave - and as much as I knew it was a stupid move, I wanted the cake, and the coffee, and his company for a little bit longer.\n I might well be setting myself up for another crappy Christmas, but it was supposed to be the season of goodwill to all men, wasn\u0027t it? And Brodie was definitely a man . . .\n And I was reaching for straws in an effort to justify the stupidity of my actions.\n I shoved the thoughts away and took a shower, then donned my still-wet underwear. I\u0027d rather risk getting a chill than being naked around Brodie. After wrapping myself up in the thick, fluffy gown, I finger-combed my short hair then I grabbed the sodden elf outfit and headed downstairs. Following his scent led me into the rich-smelling warmth of the kitchen.\n He was pouring coffee into a mug, and there were two huge slabs of cake already sitting on a tray.\n \"Where can I dry these?\" I asked.\n \"Are they shrink proof?\"\n \"Well, they didn\u0027t shrink on me.\"\n He smiled. It did my pulse rate absolutely no good whatsoever. \"There\u0027s a clothes dryer through there,\" he said, nodding toward the door to the right.\n I shoved the clothes in the dryer, then headed back into the kitchen. \"We eating here?\"\n He shook his head. \"In the living room. It\u0027s warmer. You want to grab the cake tray?\"\n I did, and followed him out of the kitchen and into the living room. A huge log fire was the room\u0027s main feature, but it was the Christmas tree that drew my eye. It was big, lush, and totally without decoration, except for the fake snow that adorned the end of the dipping branches. It reminded me of a tree in the middle of a snow-swept forest, and maybe that was the whole point.\n \"That kind of dwarfs my tree,\" I said, putting the tray down on the coffee table.\n \"The tree you had last year had character,\" he commented, and offered me a mug.\n I smiled. \"Both that tree and this year\u0027s are very sad representations of the Christmas tree.\"\n He sat down on the sofa and patted the spot beside him. I retreated to the fire, standing with my back to it.\n Amusement teased his mouth. \"So why buy them?\"\n \"Because they looked lonely.\"\n His gaze met mine, green eyes holding touches of amusement and something else. Something that had my pulse skipping. Not lust. Something deeper. Stronger.\n \"It\u0027s a rotten thing,\" he said softly, \"being lonely at Christmas.\"\n I didn\u0027t bite. I wanted to, but I didn\u0027t. I stepped away from the fire to avoid burning my butt, and picked up a plate of cake instead.\n \"How are we going to catch this vampire before he kills again?\" I spooned some cake into my mouth and felt my knees go weak. Damn, this was good chocolate cake.\n \"The team is still working on possible locations given everything we\u0027ve seen and I\u0027ve scented at the crime scenes. If they find something, they\u0027ll contact us.\"\n He leaned forward to pick up the other plate of cake, and my fingers suddenly itched with the need to run through his thick, dark hair. I gripped the spoon harder.\n \"Other than that,\" he continued, \"we just have to hope the bait plan works.\"\n \"It\u0027s difficult to catch someone when they can up and fly away.\"\n \"If it was that easy for him to shift shape, he would have flown the coop earlier. Are you going to sit down?\"\n \"Are you going to make any moves on me?\"\n Again that sexy smile teased his mouth. \"Do you want me to?\"\n Yes, yes, yes. \"No.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n I just about choked on my cake. \"Why do you think why not?\"\n \"Because I\u0027m a rat?\"\n \"That would be a good start.\"\n \"Because I forgot to call you for Christmas?\"\n \"And my birthday. And Valentine\u0027s.\"\n \"That\u0027s true. I did, however, buy you presents for both. Does that count?\"\n Yes. No. \"Damn it, Brodie, stop. This isn\u0027t fair.\" I shoved the half-eaten cake on the table and thrust my hands into my pockets so he couldn\u0027t see they were suddenly shaking.\n Because it wasn\u0027t fear. It was the need to reach out and touch him, caress him, love him. Just like we used to. Just like I dreamed of on so many of those long nights I\u0027d spent alone.\n He placed his plate back down then rose. Only the coffee table separated us. Only the coffee table stopped me from stepping into the sweet strength of his arms.\n \"I know it\u0027s not fair,\" he said softly. \"But I never intended it to be.\"\n \"But why?\"\n The question was practically torn out of me, and he grimaced. \"Because for the last month I\u0027ve been trying to talk to you, and you\u0027ve barely given me the time of day.\"\n \"And that surprises you?\"\n \"No. It\u0027s highly frustrating, though.\"\n \"Damn it, Brodie, this has to stop. I can\u0027t . . .\" My voice broke a little. I stopped and took a deep, quivering breath. \"I can\u0027t go through another Christmas waiting for you to call but knowing you never will.\"\n He raised a hand and gently brushed my cheek with his fingertips. His fingers were so warm and felt so good against my skin that desire surged, making me tremble. And it was tempting, so tempting, to press into his touch. To ask for more than just that light caress.\n But that way lay heartache.\n I went to step back, away from him, but he must have sensed the motion. He caught the end of the robe belt and held it lightly. If I stepped back, the loose knot would undo.\n Part of me wanted to step back. Wanted to give in to the heat and power of what still lay between us. But the part of me that was still desperately clinging to sanity and reason made me hold still.\n \"What if I promise never to make you wait by a phone again?\" he said softly.\n My gaze searched his, saw the sincerity and the compassion and the hunger in the bright depths. I wanted to trust it - trust him - I really did. But I just couldn\u0027t.\n \"I don\u0027t believe in promises anymore. I don\u0027t believe in you.\"\n The words hurt him, as I knew they would. But the flash of pain in his eyes, and the lingering, aching regret in his expression gave me no sense of satisfaction at all. Because in truth, I didn\u0027t want to hurt him, and I didn\u0027t want retribution for all that he\u0027d put me through. Part of me wanted to know why, but mostly I just wanted to get on with my life.\n A life that didn\u0027t involve him. Didn\u0027t involve the hurt or the pain that he\u0027d brought into my life.\n \"I\u0027ve never promised you anything that I haven\u0027t delivered,\" he said eventually.\n Maybe not out loud, but in deed and action you promised me the world. And then you ran away. \"You promised to call me the minute you got back from Chicago, Brodie. But you never did.\"\n He blew out a breath and had the grace to look guilty. \"There were reasons - \"\n \"It\u0027s too late for reasons,\" I cut in. Too late for us.\n \"I refuse to believe that,\" he said, leaving me wondering whether he was answering the spoken or unspoken comment.\n Then he stepped around the table, wrapped his hand around the back of my neck, and dragged me forward, into his arms. And kissed me.\n This time, it wasn\u0027t a fleeting thing, but rather a long and erotic exploration that had my blood screaming through my veins and my heart threatening to jump out of my chest.\n And oh, it was good, so good, to be kissed like that again. Like this moment and I were the only things that mattered to him, the only things that would ever matter to him.\n It was a lie, of course, but one I was so ready to believe, even if only for this moment. I wrapped my arms around his neck and pressed myself against his long, lean length, until I could feel his every intake of breath. Feel the rigid hardness of his erection pressing against my stomach. Lord, he felt good.\n His free hand brushed my side, sliding teasingly past my breast. Something akin to electricity flashed through every nerve ending, and a low-down ache leapt into focus. Tiny beads of perspiration skated across my skin - moisture raised by the sheer heat of his body, and my own crazy longing.\n I knew I should step away, should retreat from the kiss and from all the tangled, unsettled emotions that it raised. But I couldn\u0027t. Call me weak, call me a fool, but the reality of this kiss was so much better than the dreams that I could only stand there and enjoy.\n It was just as well his cell phone chose that moment to ring, because we both knew where that kiss would have led otherwise.\n Brodie growled low down in his throat, a sound that seemed to echo through my lips and body, then pulled away, his breathing harsh as he dragged the phone from his pocket.\n \"What?\"\n To say he sounded annoyed would be an understatement. It was probably the closest thing I\u0027d heard to a growl from him when he was still in human form.\n His expression got darker as he continued to listen, and I knew without doubt it was work. I took a deep breath to regroup my thoughts and steady my riotous heart rate, then, rather determinately, tied a double knot on the dressing gown. It wouldn\u0027t stop him or me, but it was the action that mattered. It was a way of reminding my scattered self-control and exuberant hormones that I did have a choice, and that I could do what was best for me.\n Although after that kiss, I wasn\u0027t so sure what, exactly, that was right now.\n I picked up my coffee and moved back to the fire. I wasn\u0027t cold - far from it - but it was the farthest point away from him without getting too obvious about retreating.\n He hung up and made another low, growly sound.\n \"Work?\" I said, trying not to sound relieved and failing miserably.\n He gave me a dark look. \"Yeah, there\u0027s been another murder.\"\n My stomach sank. \"But it\u0027s after midnight.\"\n \"I noticed. He obviously didn\u0027t.\"\n \"Why can\u0027t they send someone else? Why us?\"\n But I knew the answer. The squad was a small one, and this was our case. And there was no such thing as standard hours or being off duty when it came to the Para-investigations squad.\n He simply said, \"You want to get dressed?\"\n \"I really don\u0027t want to wear that elf costume - \"\n \"Well, Mom\u0027s clothes won\u0027t fit, because she\u0027s much bigger than you. So unless you want to wear the robe, we\u0027re stuck.\"\n I swore under my breath and stomped out of the room. \"We wouldn\u0027t have been stuck if you\u0027d just taken me back home like I asked.\"\n \"But I wouldn\u0027t have had the chance to kiss you if I\u0027d done that, now, would I?\"\n \"Not a snowflake\u0027s chance in hell,\" I muttered. I closed the laundry room door, then quickly pulled the clothes out of the dryer and got dressed. There was a thick pair of woolen socks sitting on top of some clean washing, so I took those and put them on before dragging on my wet shoes.\n He was waiting in the kitchen when I opened the door, and his gaze drifted down my length, heating me as quickly as any caress or kiss. \"The white socks spoil the look. And they\u0027re my brother\u0027s.\"\n \"Well, your brother just donated them to my cold feet. Where are we going?\"\n \"The cemetery.\"\n \"So he didn\u0027t attack a collector this time?\"\n \"Nope. Gravedigger.\"\n \"They\u0027re digging graves at this hour of the night?\"\n \"Death doesn\u0027t stop just because it\u0027s almost Christmas, you know.\"\n He placed his hand against my back and guided me out of the house. My feet jingled merrily as I clomped down the steps, suggesting a mood I couldn\u0027t reach and annoying the hell out of me. So I bent and ripped the stupid bells off.\n Silence fell. It was heavenly.\n We zoomed through the streets at record speed, and all I could do was thank the stars that there wasn\u0027t much traffic about at that hour.\n The cemetery\u0027s main gates were locked but that wasn\u0027t much of a problem to a werewolf. Once he\u0027d broken the lock and opened the gates fully, we drove around to the left, following a road that was lined by bare rosebushes.\n \"Who reported the murder?\" I asked, eyeing the gravestone-filled darkness with some trepidation. Cemeteries were not a favorite place of mine. There were too many ghosts wandering about, and not all of them were the pleasant type.\n \"It came in anonymously, and they weren\u0027t on the line long enough for a trace.\"\n \"No caller ID, then?\"\n \"Nope.\"\n \"Unusual.\"\n \"It could be, but a lot of folks don\u0027t want to get involved any more than necessary.\"\n Especially when it came to non-human activities. Still, this time it niggled, and I had no idea why. He pulled to a parking spot and climbed out of the car. I grabbed the stakes and my coat, then followed suit, relieved that I\u0027d torn the bells off my shoes. The jingle would have clashed against the somber feel of the cemetery.\n I slammed the door shut and moved to the front of the car. \"Where is the body?\" I said, my gaze sweeping over the varied headstones sitting in orderly soldier rows. There were no ghosts out there, and for that I had to be glad. I wasn\u0027t in the mood for their chatter tonight.\n His nostrils flared slightly, then he caught my hand in his and said, \"It\u0027s this way.\"\n I didn\u0027t question his certainty. He was a were, so if there was blood on the breeze, he\u0027d be smelling it. But as we wound our way through the headstones, a chill began to creep across my skin and goose bumps formed.\n Something was out there.\n My steps slowed. \"Brodie - \"\n \"I know,\" he said softly. \"We\u0027re being paced at the moment.\"\n \"Can you smell what they are?\"\n \"No. They\u0027re slightly downwind. But I can hear their steps.\" He squeezed my hand lightly, but if he meant it to be reassuring, then it failed miserably. \"There\u0027s only one, so it won\u0027t be a problem.\"\n \"Maybe not for you, but I\u0027m human.\" And though I could fight, I still had nowhere near the strength or speed of a non-human. Which was a bummer when it was my job to fight the bad apples amongst them.\n \"They have to get through me to get to you, and trust me, that\u0027s not going to happen.\"\n I couldn\u0027t help smiling. Werewolves were so damn confident in their own fighting prowess it was sometimes scary. But at times like this, that was also damn comforting.\n The smell of fresh earth touched the cold night air, and within minutes we came across the body. He was lying on his back beside a tractor, right next to a freshly dug grave, and the look of shock frozen onto his face suggested he hadn\u0027t even seen his attacker. His neck had been slashed wide open by something jagged, but not much blood had seeped into the collar of his overalls and thick jacket. Someone - probably our vamp with the shattered canines - had sucked it all up.\n \"Why would he be digging a grave at night? And without a light?\"\n \"There\u0027s a lot of non-humans doing this sort of stuff now, and many of them don\u0027t need lights to see at night. This guy doesn\u0027t smell human.\" He released my hand and knelt beside the body. \"The scent lingering here is the one I chased earlier tonight. But there\u0027s also a fainter scent that\u0027s the same as the one I found near the other victims.\"\n \"So we have two vampires, who may or may not be related, working together.\" I studied the darkness surrounding us. \"You think they could be hiding out here?\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t be the first time vamps have made themselves at home in a cemetery. After all, that\u0027s where the legends of vampires rising from graves came from.\"\n \"But if our vamp tonight was hungry enough to attack this gravedigger, surely he would have attacked someone earlier? Hell, I was standing there looking more than a little cold and forlorn, and he showed no inclination to attack me.\"\n \"Maybe he sensed the anger in you, and figured you\u0027d put up too much of a - \"\n I didn\u0027t hear the rest of his sentence, because something long and thin leapt out of the surrounding darkness and came straight at me. I had a brief glimpse of a white face, then he was flying into me, knocking the stakes from my hand and sending the both of us crashing to the ground.\n I landed hard enough to leave me winded and briefly seeing stars. Stars that were quickly shattered by the growls of the vampire. His body covered my length and pinned me to the ground and the smell of him - earth and unwashed flesh - filled every breath. He snarled, revealing those shattered bloody canines, confirming our suspicions that he\u0027d been the one to kill the gravedigger. And he intended to feed off me as well.\n Not that I was about to let him.\n I bucked in an effort to get him off, but he rode me like a bronco and laughed harshly - a sound that was abruptly cut off when my fist smashed into his face. I might be human, but I was strong, and my blow mashed his nose, sending blood flying.\n He growled low down in his throat, a sound that was suddenly echoed. Then he was gone from me, tossed into the night like so much rubbish, and Brodie was there, hauling me upright.\n \"Are you okay?\" he said, voice harsh and green eyes afire with anger and concern.\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m fine - \"\n \"Good. Stay here while I take care of that bastard.\"\n \"Brodie, no, wait - \"\n Once again, I was speaking to nothing more than air. I rubbed my arms and studied the surrounding darkness. Whatever had been watching us before was still watching me now, and the feel of it made my skin crawl. It was an older evil than the one Brodie was chasing, and there was an odd sense of satisfaction coming from it.\n I shivered slightly and looked around for the stakes. I found one. I\u0027m sure the other one was out there in the darkness somewhere, but I wasn\u0027t willing to go too far to find it. And while one stake might not help if whatever-it-was out there in the darkness attacked as suddenly as the first vamp had, at least holding it gave me some sense of security.\n With stake in hand, I knelt down beside the body and studied the poor man\u0027s neck. What a mess.\n So who\u0027d reported his murder? Did this gravedigger have a partner who\u0027d fled the scene, or was he also lying out there in the darkness with a savaged neck? If so, why hadn\u0027t Brodie scented him?\n And who the hell was watching me?\n I glanced at the surrounding gravestones, my heart pounding rapidly and the taste of fear in my mouth. I might have faced more than my fair share of bad guys over the years, but I was still human. Humans were easy kills for vampires, even one as well trained as me.\n God, Brodie, where are you?\n Why had he left me alone? Why hadn\u0027t he sensed that our other watcher was still out there? Or had his anger at me being attacked blocked out awareness of everything else?\n I blew out a breath, and tried to remain calm. But my knuckles practically glowed with the force of my grip on the stake, and every sense I had was tuned in the direction of the thing that still watched.\n Still oozed an evil that was making my senses and stomach squirm.\n I rose and walked around the body, heading for the tractor, to make sure we didn\u0027t have another victim waiting to be uncovered in the cabin.\n I didn\u0027t get more than five steps when I sensed the approach of evil. Before I could react, he hit from behind, smashing my face into the ground. Suddenly all I could breathe was dirt, and the panic that had already been stirring surged to new heights. I struggled with all my might, but a hand against the back of my head pressed me down harder. A scream rose up my throat, but it had nowhere to go, echoing through my mind instead.\n And then his free hand was on me, tearing at my clothes, caressing my skin, his flesh cold and clammy and horrid. I shuddered, fighting his touch, fighting him, with all my might, twisting and kicking and punching backward.\n He chuckled. A heated, lusty, and totally evil sound.\n Clothes tore. His fingers forced themselves underneath me, groping for a breast. I shuddered, fighting nausea and feeling more and more desperate for air.\n Stake, I thought, and groped blindly around me. My hand brushed against wood, and I grasped it frantically, my fingers tightening around it spasmodically as I lifted my arm and stabbed backward with all the strength I had left.\n I hit flesh, felt it give way. He roared in pain and jerked away. Not getting off, but giving me the freedom to move. To breathe. I gulped down air, my whole body shuddering with the effort.\n \"Bitch!\" The sound rode the air, harsh and forced. \"For that, I will do you slowly, and then I shall let my brother suck you dry. No easy death for you, little girl.\"\n \"Your brother is dead,\" came a voice so flat, so deadly and so damn cold that for a moment I didn\u0027t even recognize that it was Brodie\u0027s, \"as you soon will be.\"\n Then the weight was off me, and I could move. I forced my trembling limbs into action and pushed up, the now-bloody stake still in my hand as I swung around.\n Brodie\u0027s powerful fingers were around the neck of a thickset man, and he was holding him off the ground by a good six inches or so. That took more strength than I could ever imagine anyone owning, but he didn\u0027t even seem to be exerting himself.\n The only sign of effort was in the whiteness of his fingers. Fingers that were ever-so-slowly squeezing the life out of my attacker.\n No quick death intended there, whatever he might have said.\n \"Brodie - \"\n \"No one attacks you and lives,\" he cut in, his gaze not leaving the thickset man\u0027s. \"No one.\"\n There wasn\u0027t only anger in his voice, but possessiveness. It was the wolf speaking, and the wolf was protecting what belonged to him.\n Me.\n Normally that knowledge would have made my heart dance, but such a reaction seemed out of place when he was intent on slowly strangling his quarry in the middle of a graveyard. And the fact that this vamp entirely deserved it was beside the point.\n \"Damn it, Brodie, kill him quickly. You\u0027re not him. I don\u0027t want you to be like him, or any of the others we kill.\" Didn\u0027t want him to enjoy it, as the protector within undoubtedly was.\n His fingers moved, and a loud crack ran across the night. The vamp went limp, and Brodie released him, letting him drop to the ground like so much rubbish.\n \"God, I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, his voice soft and suddenly weary as he turned to face me. And the pain in his eyes, the fear still etched in his face, made my heart ache. \"I\u0027m so damn sorry - \"\n I didn\u0027t let him finish. I ran into his embrace. Felt his arms wrap around me and hold me so tight. Arms that were trembling more than I was.\n \"It\u0027s okay, I\u0027m here, I\u0027m safe.\"\n \"I thought my stupidity had taken you from me a second time.\" His breath whispered heat past my ear. \"I felt your fear echo through me. The thought of a life without you in it hit me, and I panicked. I can\u0027t live without you, Hannah. I don\u0027t want to live without you.\"\n I broke free of his fierce grip, and stared into the glory of his green eyes. Seeing the honesty there. Seeing the love. Wanting to return it twofold, but still trapped by the hurt of Christmas past. \"Yet you walked away for a year. I can\u0027t just forget that, Brodie.\" And while I might have told him I didn\u0027t want a reason, that was a total lie.\n He sighed, and ran a finger lightly down my cheek. My body trembled in response, and it was all I could do not to step into his embrace again, to forget the past and just enjoy the promise of the present.\n But I couldn\u0027t. I owed my tear-soaked pillow more than that.\n \"I was an ass - \"\n \"I think we\u0027ve both agreed on that point,\" I said dryly. \"The point we need to clarify is why.\"\n He thrust a hand through his hair, then said, \"We happened very quickly. I just wasn\u0027t ready for it.\"\n \"So you coped by running away? That\u0027s logical.\"\n \"Loving a human isn\u0027t logical.\"\n \"Me being a human isn\u0027t a reason, Brodie. It\u0027s an excuse. I need a reason.\" Needed to believe he wouldn\u0027t do it to me again.\n He sighed. \"You scared me.\"\n I almost choked on my disbelief. \"I scared you? You\u0027re the big bad hairy monster, not me.\"\n He half smiled. \"I never expected - or wanted - to fall in love with a human, Hannah. And my family certainly didn\u0027t appreciate the thought of me bringing a human into the pack.\" He shrugged, his expression a little sheepish. \"So I convinced myself it was nothing more than an infatuation, and walked away.\"\n \"Just like that,\" I said, and all the hurt and the pain of that time was suddenly right there in my voice. \"So damn easily.\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t easy. It was never easy.\" He grimaced, and suddenly his green eyes held a loneliness as powerful as anything I\u0027d been feeling over the last year. \"You have no idea how many times I picked up the phone to call you. No idea how many times I sat out in front of your place, practicing an apology.\" He hesitated, and smiled ruefully. \"And no idea how many times I came close to interrupting your dates and punching out whatever man you were with. It was that need to destroy the men you were dating that finally convinced me this was no mere infatuation.\"\n \"And you never thought to talk to me about any of this?\"\n \"I thought about it, trust me. But it\u0027s never easy for a werewolf to admit that they\u0027re wrong, especially in the face of such anger and hurt. And the longer I left it, the more certain I became that I\u0027d made the biggest mistake of my life, the more afraid I became that apologizing wouldn\u0027t undo the damage and that I might have lost you forever.\"\n \"So why are you finally apologizing now?\"\n \"Because I think about you every day, and dream about you every night. We were never a mistake, no matter what I might have thought at the beginning, and what we have will never go away. I love you, Hannah. I need you.\" He let his fingers run over my lips, making them tingle, then dropped his hand. \"Please, tell me you\u0027ll forgive me. Tell me you\u0027ll give me another chance.\"\n I stared at him for a moment, knowing there could only ever be one answer. That there had only ever been one answer from the moment he\u0027d walked back into my life. I might not be able to totally forget the year of loneliness, or the pain he\u0027d caused me, but what we had was worth fighting for.\n Rat or not, right or wrong, I wanted this man in my life.\n For Christmas.\n For ever.\n I blew out a breath, and said hesitantly, \"I don\u0027t know, Brodie.\" Tension flitted across his shoulders, and for a moment, utter bleakness shone in his eyes. I let a smile touch my lips, and added, \"After all, I didn\u0027t even get to finish my chocolate cake. And there\u0027s still the matter of the missing Valentine\u0027s Day and birthday presents to be resolved.\"\n He laughed - a sound so joyous, so happy, that goose bumps ran across my skin. He wrapped an arm around my waist and hauled me close. \"What if I promise to bathe you in chocolate cake for the rest of your life?\"\n I snuggled closer, letting the heat and scent of him flow over my skin and fill every breath. \"That might be a step in the right direction.\"\n \"And give you two birthday presents for the next ten years?\"\n \"And at Christmas and Valentine\u0027s. I\u0027m missing those, remember.\"\n \"It\u0027s a deal,\" he murmured, then his lips claimed mine, and he kissed me.\n It felt so good, so right. Like I was finally home, right where I belonged.\n Christmas past might have been a nightmare, but Christmas present and Christmas future were suddenly looking mighty damn fine. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolfsbane-and-mistletoe/page-9.html","bookId":2202,"book":{"id":2202,"title":"Wolfsbane and Mistletoe","description":"Storyline: \n The editors of \"Many Bloody Returns\" deliver the perfect howl-iday gift, with new tales from Patricia Briggs, Carrie Vaughn, and many more. \n \"New York Times\" bestselling authors Charlaine Harris, Patricia Briggs, Keri Arthur, and Carrie Vaughn—along with eleven other masters of the genre—offer all-new stories on werewolves and the holidays, a fresh variation on the concept that worked so well with birthdays and vampires in \"Many Bloody Returns.\" \n The holidays can bring out the beast in anyone.
