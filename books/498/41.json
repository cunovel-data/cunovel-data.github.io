They like to eat clover and cabbage and lettuce. Katrina and Jan like to go to Bram’s house. When they go there, Jan says, “Let us go out and see the rabbits, Bram.” And Bram says, “All right. Come on, Katrina.” But Katrina wants to stay and play with baby Annetka. “You go on, boys,” says she. “I will come by and by.” So the boys go out to see the rabbits. Katrina plays with little Annetka. She throws a big ball to the baby. The baby tries to catch it, but she cannot. Katrina puts Annetka in her little cart. She rides her up and down on the brick path in the garden. The baby likes to see the pretty flowers. She likes to look at the white shells and stones by the garden path. By and by Annetka’s mother comes out. “It is time for your nap, baby,” says she. So she takes little Annetka into the house. Then Katrina runs away to see the rabbits.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77974.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
