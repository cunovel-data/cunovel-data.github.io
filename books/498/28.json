There are rows and rows of purple, pink and white hyacinths. There are great fields of yellow daffodils. They look like patches of sunshine. There are rows and rows of beautiful white narcissus plants. The sweetness of these plants fills the air. Katrina and Jan love to go into the beautiful gardens. They pull the weeds from the flower beds. They like to watch the big, buzzing bees fly around among the flowers. They like to see the pretty butterflies flitting here and there. Some of the butterflies are white and red, and some are big and yellow. “The white and red butterflies look like tulips flying away,” said Jan. “The yellow butterflies look like daffodils,” said little Katrina.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77961.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
