{"id":40322,"no":24,"title":"VISITING AT GRANDMOTHER’S","content":"Grandmother asked Jan and Katrina to come and visit her one day. She told them to bring their friends, Hilda, Kassie, Karl, and Bram with them. Hilda, Kassie, Karl, and Bram were all glad to go. So they dressed in their best. “We will meet by the windmill,” they said, “and we will go along the dike to grandmother’s house.” So they met at the windmill, and away they went all together. Grandmother was looking for them. She took them into the house. She gave them each a bowl of curds and whey and some nice, fresh honey cakes. “Oh, how good this is!” cried Kassie. “Yes, yes, Grandmother, no one can make curds and whey like yours,” said Jan. “Or honey cakes either,” said Karl. When the children went home, grandmother gave each one of them a honey cake cut like a heart. She gave each one a pretty shell. The children said, “We have had such a good time, grandmother.” And grandmother said, “I have had a good time, too, children. You must come to see me again soon.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77957.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
