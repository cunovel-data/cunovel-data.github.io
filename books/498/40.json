{"id":40338,"no":40,"title":"CHRISTMAS MORNING","content":"Jan and Katrina got up early on Christmas morning. They ran to the fireplace. There were the wooden shoes! They were filled with good things. There were toys on the floor beside the shoes. “O Mother! Father! Come quick! See what the good St. Nicholas has brought us!” cried Jan and Katrina. “What beautiful gifts!” says mother.[100] “St. Nicholas must think you are good children.” St. Nicholas brought Jan a little wooden horse on wheels. He brought him a woolly lamb that says “Baa” when you press a spring in its back. Jan had three books, too, and a pen and a red pen-holder. What fine gifts! Katrina had a little cradle for her doll. She had a doll-cart. She had a gold chain, a lace collar, and a pretty blue gown. Jan and Katrina also had many sweetmeats, nuts, and little cakes. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77973.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
