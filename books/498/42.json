The market place was full of noise and busy life. There were hens and ducks and geese that cackled and quacked and hissed. There were rows and rows of cheeses, pats of yellow butter, and honeycombs dripping with honey. There were dog-carts filled with milk-cans, with apples, with potatoes, and other vegetables. There were Dutch girls selling lace and flowers. There were bakers with trays full of bread, rolls, and cakes. Katrina bought a wooden spoon to take home to her mother. Jan bought mother a big yellow bowl. “Mother will like to stir cake in it,” he said. “Yes, and she can stir it with this nice, wooden spoon,” said little Katrina.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77975.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
