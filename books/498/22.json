{"id":40320,"no":22,"title":"THE CUCKOO CLOCK","content":"Jan’s grandmother has a clock. It is a beautiful clock. It is made of carved wood. It is made in the shape of a little house. There is a door in the house and there are windows. The weights that hang down look like big acorns. The numbers on the face of the clock are white. The hands are white, too. When it is time for the clock to strike, a little bell rings. The little door flies open. Out pops a dear little white bird. It is a cuckoo. It says “Cuckoo, cuckoo!” If it is three o’clock, it says “Cuckoo” three times. If it is six o’clock, it says “Cuckoo” six times. What hour does it say “Cuckoo” the most times? What name do we call that hour in the day-time? When does it say “Cuckoo” only once? Grandmother winds the cuckoo clock once a week. She winds it every Sunday morning. She winds it just before she goes to church.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77955.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
