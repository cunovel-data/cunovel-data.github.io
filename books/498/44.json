{"id":40342,"no":44,"title":"KIND HEARTED JAN","content":"One day Jan was down on the beach. There he saw a man with a dog and a cart. The man was putting sand in the cart. He was going to make the dog pull it into town. The poor dog was sick. His feet were sore and he was not strong enough to pull the heavy cart. The man had a whip. He whipped the poor dog. The dog moaned and cried. He fell down between the shafts of the cart. His master beat him, and tried to make him get up. Jan saw the cruel master whip the poor dog. He felt very sorry for the dog. He ran up to the man. “You must not beat your dog,” said Jan. “He is old and he is not strong enough to pull your heavy load.” “He is a good-for-nothing dog,” said the man. “I wish I could sell him.” So Jan asked the man how much he wanted for the dog. Jan had enough money, so he bought the poor old dog. He took him home. He washed the dog’s sore feet. He gave him food and drink. He made a soft bed for him to lie on.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77977.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
