{"id":40305,"no":7,"title":"THE WOODEN SHOES","content":"Jan and Katrina wear wooden shoes. When they walk, the shoes go “Klip, klop, klip, klop.” I think it would be hard to walk in wooden shoes. Do you not think so? Katrina and Jan do not think so. They can run and jump and walk in their wooden shoes. They keep them very clean and white. They scrub them every night before they go to bed. Then they are all nice and clean to put on in the morning. You might think that a wooden shoe is heavy. It is not heavier than your own shoe. It is smooth inside. It is as smooth as your own little shoe. It is held on the foot by a leather strap. Some wooden shoes are painted and have patterns on them. Others are scrubbed as white as snow. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77940.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
