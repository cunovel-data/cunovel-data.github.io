{"id":40313,"no":15,"title":"KATRINA’S MOTHER","content":"The Dutch mother is busy all day. She looks very neat at her work. She wears a blue dress. She wears a stiff white cap. She wears a big brown apron. Sometimes when it is cool, she wears a pretty red shawl. She has some gold ear-rings. Katrina says she is going to wear gold ear-rings when she grows up. She thinks her mother’s ear-rings are very pretty. Katrina’s mother wears wooden shoes, too, but her shoes are much larger than Jan’s or Katrina’s. Jan’s mother made him a little coat. She made it of blue cloth. She put big brass buttons on it. Jan likes to count his buttons. He plays a game with them. He makes a wish; and pointing to his buttons, he says, “Yes, no, yes, no.” He pretends the buttons tell him if he will get his wish. Jan is proud of his fine blue coat. He wears it when he goes to town. The mother made Katrina a little stiff cap and a pretty white apron. The apron had lace on it. Katrina’s mother knit the lace. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77948.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
