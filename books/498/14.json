Mother said we could stay until it is time to bring the cows home.” “But I have no meal,” said Katrina. “I will go over to Mynheer Van’s windmill. I will bring you some meal,” said Jan. So Jan ran to the windmill and brought home the meal. Katrina made him some rolls. She made him a cake too. She put little seeds in the cake. It was very good. Then she got a pat of butter and a slice of cheese. She put the rolls, cake, butter, and cheese in a basket. She spread a clean napkin over the top. “Here is your lunch, Jan,” she called. “There is enough for Bram, too.” “You are a good little sister, Katrina. Thank you very much,” said Jan. Then he and Bram went away to the meadow to stay until sunset. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77947.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
