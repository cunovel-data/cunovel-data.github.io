{"id":40318,"no":20,"title":"THE DUTCH BEDS","content":"The Dutch beds are not like our beds. They are built in the walls of houses like cupboards. They are like little shelves or presses in the wall. They have feather beds on them. The feather beds are nice and soft. In summer, the Dutch boys and girls have quilts over them. In the winter, they sleep on one feather bed, and have another feather bed and quilts to cover them. They are very warm. Katrina has a blue and white quilt on her bed. Jan has a red and green quilt. Their grandmother made the quilts for them. Their grandmother is a dear little Dutch lady who lives down near the ocean. The children like to go and see her. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77953.html","bookId":498,"book":{"id":498,"title":"Windmills and wooden shoes","description":"简介： In Windmills and Wooden Shoes we have a continuous story of the doings of the Dutch children, Jan and Katrina and their little friends....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:52 AM"}}
