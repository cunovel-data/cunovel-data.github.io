{"id":79054,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"\"Gavin? I want ten more men riding with you,\" he shouted. The soldier immediately turned his mount back toward the stables. \"Jamie, you\u0027ve forgotten something,\" he said when she tried to take the reins back in her hands. \"Oh…\" She immediately started to blush, then motioned him closer and leaned down to kiss his brow. He couldn\u0027t hide his exasperation. \"I meant you forgot your saddle,\" he told her. \"I don\u0027t like it, Jamie argued. \"It\u0027s too new. It makes me stiff, Alec.\" \"Marcus, get my wife one of my old saddles. Why didn\u0027t you tel me you could ride bareback? I thought you unskilled. You did fal off your mount today.\" \"I didn\u0027t tel you because you would have thought me unladylike,\" she answered. He had to smile over that foolish statement. \"I could never think you were unladylike.\" She smiled. \"You\u0027re forever reminding me,\" he added. \"I should have realized you were skil ed,\" he admitted then. \"Beak told me you were the only one who could seat the mare. Stil , he added that you didn\u0027t ride often.\" \"He was protecting me,\" Jamie explained. \"He thought you\u0027d be more considerate if you thought I wasn\u0027t properly trained.\" Alec grinned. \"Jamie? Don\u0027t ever kiss me the way you just did.\" She thought he meant not to show any affection in front of his men. He motioned her toward him with the crook of his finger again and when they were almost nose to nose, he whispered, \"Kiss me like this.\" He didn\u0027t even give her time to smile. His mouth settled on hers in hard, hungry demand. She didn\u0027t open her mouth quickly enough to please him, but his low growl gained her full cooperation. His tongue drove inside just in time to taste her sigh. She didn\u0027t hear the men yel ing their pleasure at being witnesses to such a blatant display of passion. Alec heard them, however, and reluctantly eased his mouth away. Jamie looked total y confused. He was arrogantly pleased that he could so easily rob her of all her thoughts, then realized he was holding her in his arms. He didn\u0027t recal taking her off Wildfire\u0027s back. They both smiled. \"You\u0027ve wasted enough of my valuable time,\" he told her. Jamie laughed. The sound of soldiers riding down the hil turned her attention then. \"Why must I have so many soldiers accompanying me?\" \"They also like to hunt,\" Alec replied. He let her slide to the ground when a soldier tossed him the saddle he\u0027d requested. Jamie held the reins while Alec adjusted the straps around the mare\u0027s bel y. He lifted her onto Wildfire\u0027s back. \"Have a good ride, Jamie,\" he told her. \"I won\u0027t be coming back empty-handed,\" she announced. \"I know you won\u0027t,\" Alec told her. She really didn\u0027t like skirting the truth this way, but she deliberately let Alec believe she was hunting food. Besides, she thought to herself, he\u0027d settle in once he\u0027d gotten over his initial bluster. He\u0027d make a proper father, too. Jamie turned back to Marcus when they\u0027d reached the drawbridge. \"Which way, Marcus?\" she called out. \"The west, milady.\" Wildfire was in a full gal op when Marcus gained her side. He motioned her to fol ow his lead, then made a half-circle, backtracking from the way they\u0027d started. Marcus was polite enough not to mention her poor sense of direction. Gavin, however, took great delight in reminding her. Jamie was too pleased with both men to take exception. They hadn\u0027t told Alec what her true destination was, after all , and she was most thankful for their silence. She didn\u0027t care if it had been deliberate or not. Alec kept tel ing himself he wasn\u0027t worried, but he found himself pacing in front of the hearth after dinner was finished and his wife stil wasn\u0027t home. No, he wasn\u0027t worried. Marcus and Gavin would keep her safe. She\u0027d be home any minute now. When the sun was completely gone, then he\u0027d worry, he told himself for the tenth time. He had used the time of separation well . As soon as Jamie left, he had called for his mount and gone directly to Helena\u0027s clan. He\u0027d spent several hours talking with the cousins who remembered Helena, and had learned some rather interesting facts about the woman who\u0027d found marriage to him so foul she\u0027d ended her life in desperation. He found Father Murdock as soon as he returned and spent a good long while listening to his opinions. The priest was clearly amazed that his laird was now speaking of his dead wife. He hadn\u0027t even mentioned Helena\u0027s name since the day of the burial. The laird\u0027s questions were perplexing to him, but he knew better than to try to find out exactly what Alec was looking for. It wasn\u0027t his place to question. Now Alec paced a path in the great hall while he sorted through the information. Jamie, having just returned to the castle, stood at the top of the steps, waiting for Alec to notice her. She was just about to cal out to him when he suddenly turned around. He was so relieved to see her that he gave her a good frown. She retaliated by smiling. He noticed her skirt was swaying back and forth, then saw the dusty little face peeking out at him. Gavin and Marcus flanked Jamie. They were both staring down at the child. Jamie took a deep breath and reached for Mary Kathleen\u0027s hand. \"Come and meet your father,\" she whispered to the little girl. Mary Kathleen didn\u0027t want to cooperate. Alec\u0027s size obviously intimidated her. Her golden brown eyes were as wide as round trenchers. \"He\u0027s going to love you with all his heart,\" she promised. Before the little girl could shake her head, Jamie clasped her hand and led her down the steps. Alec didn\u0027t have any idea what was going on. The barefoot cherub was wearing his plaid, though, indicating she belonged to a Kincaid. The ill -fitted piece of blanket was wrapped around her and tied in a knot below her chin. Alec couldn\u0027t remember ever having seen her before. She was an appealing little girl with a mop of honey-colored curls that hung lower on one side of her face than on the other. \"Who is this?\" Alec asked. \"Your daughter.\" \"My what?\" Jamie ignored her husband\u0027s astonishment. \"Wel , actually she\u0027s our daughter now,\" she explained. \"Say hel o to your papa, Mary Kathleen.\" The little girl was stil frightened. She continued to stare up at Alec while she twisted a lock of her hair into a knot on top of her head. Jamie leaned down and whispered to the child. She was trying to soothe the little girl and also trying to give Alec a little more time to get used to the idea. When Jamie straightened up again, she could tel from her husband\u0027s expression that he was going to need a lot more time. \"She\u0027s Helena\u0027s daughter,\" Gavin called out just to break the staring contest. \"She\u0027s my daughter now,\" Jamie countered. She let Mary Kathleen hide behind her back again. \"It\u0027s really quite simple to understand, Alec. When you married Helena, you became Mary\u0027s papa. You were going to bring her here to live with you, weren\u0027t you? And when I wed you,\" she continued before Alec could answer her, \"wel , I then became Mary\u0027s new mother. We have both been errant in our duties to this child, husband.\" \"The Kincaid provided well for Helena\u0027s child,\" Marcus interjected. \"Her grandmother died three months past. Did you know Mary was given over to a distant relation who wanted only your grain? It pains me to admit the woman was English, Alec. And do you know there are bruises up and down your daughter\u0027s back and on her legs, too? She would have been dead in another month\u0027s time if I\u0027d left her in such care.\" He hadn\u0027t known. He looked furious, too. Jamie nodded. Then everyone started talking at once. Alec just stood there, his hands clasped behind his back, staring down at the little innocent peeking out at him from behind Jamie\u0027s skirts. \"Come here, Mary,\" he ordered the child. She shook her head at him while she tried to put a good portion of Jamie\u0027s gown into her mouth. Alec started laughing. \"God help me, she\u0027s been with you less than a day and she\u0027s already taking on your stubbornness,\" he told Jamie. He scooped the little girl up into his arms and held her so that they were face to face. \"Be careful of her back, Alec. She\u0027s tender.\" Alec whispered something to the child, then smiled when she nodded. \"Can you get her to speak to you? She hasn\u0027t said a word to me,\" Jamie whispered. \"You don\u0027t think something\u0027s wrong with her voice, do you?\" \"Quit your worrying,\" Alec ordered. \"She\u0027ll talk when she wants to. Won\u0027t you, Mary?\" The little girl nodded again. \"She was wearing Kevin\u0027s colors,\" Gavin stated. \"He\u0027d rol in his grave if he could see how filthy the garment was.\" \"Who changed her clothes?\" Alec asked. \"I did,\" Jamie answered. \"That\u0027s when I saw all the bruises. I knew I had to bring her to you then,\" she added. \"Nay, wife. You\u0027d already made that decision when you put my plaid on her.\" The man was too cunning for her. \"Yes, Alec,\" she admitted. \"You knew you were going to bring her back when you left today,\" he continued. \"That\u0027s what you meant by not coming back from your hunt empty-handed, now, isn\u0027t it?\" He didn\u0027t sound angry, but Jamie stil wasn\u0027t sure what he was thinking. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"I had already made the decision.\" Alec gently tucked the little girl under his arm, treating her much like a burlap bag of feed. \"That isn\u0027t how you hold a baby,\" Jamie blurted out. \"She\u0027s only three summers, Alec.\" Mary Kathleen didn\u0027t seem to mind, however. She let out a giggle. \"What happened after you saw the bruises?\" Alec asked her. \"I became… angry.\" \"How angry?\" \"I threw the plaid on the ground,\" Jamie blurted out. \"It was a deliberate insult. I did it on purpose. I restrained myself though. I wanted to give that horrible woman a few good bruises to remember me by.\" \"I spit on it.\" Marcus had made that announcement. \"In front of witnesses, Alec.\" \"Good.\" Marcus lost his frown when he\u0027d gained his lord\u0027s approval. \"It means war,\" he reminded Alec. \"Two wars,\" Gavin interjected. \"You\u0027re forgetting Helena\u0027s family. They\u0027l also get involved.\" \"No,\" Alec countered. \"They won\u0027t care. Why do you think Annie came with Helena when she wed me? The two sisters had been sorely mistreated by their family. The king was aware of this, of course.\" \"And that\u0027s why you were married to her so soon after her first husband\u0027s death? To protect her?\" Jamie asked. Alec nodded. When he finally looked at his wife, he was smiling. \"Thank you.\" \"Why do you thank me, Alec?\" \"For bringing our daughter home,\" he answered. She was nearly overwhelmed by his compassion. Her eyes fil ed with tears and she would have burst into sobs if Alec hadn\u0027t pretended to drop Mary Kathleen just then. Jamie shouted instead. Both father and daughter laughed. Alec all but flipped the child over his arms, then held her up to face him again. \"Wife? This babe smel s as rank as Murdock. Bathe her,\" he ordered. \"Marcus, have someone go find Edith and Annie. They\u0027l want to meet their niece.\" \"Then you truly claim Mary Kathleen as your daughter,\" she asked, her worry stil obvious. He stared at her a long moment before answering. \"How could I not?\" She was too overcome with emotion to give him answer. When Alec handed the child to her, Jamie settled her on her hip. Angus and Elizabeth walked into the hall just as Jamie started for the tub behind the screen. She quickly explained all about her new daughter. Mary Kathleen turned quite shy and hid her face against the crook of Jamie\u0027s neck. Elizabeth offered to help bathe the little girl. Jamie agreed, then caught Angus\u0027s remark about arrangements being made for their king\u0027s visit. \"Your king is coming to see you?\" she asked Alec. She looked appal ed. Alec raised an eyebrow over such a bizarre reaction. \"He is.\" \"Edgar?\" \"\u0027Tis the only Scottish king we have,\" he answered. \"When does he arrive?\" \"Tomorrow. Does this news displease you, Jamie? You look upset.\" \"He\u0027s known for his cruelty,\" she blurted out. Everyone in the hall gave her incredulous looks. \"Edgar?\" Alec asked. \"Jamie, he\u0027s known for his kindness.\" The grumbles of agreement made her feel much better. She smiled down at Mary Kathleen and then said, \"I shouldn\u0027t have believed those stories. No, he couldn\u0027t have done what I heard he\u0027d done if he\u0027s as kind as everyone says.\" \"What story?\" Marcus asked. \"Tel us the worst,\" Gavin suggested. \"And we\u0027l tel you if it be true or not.\" \"I heard that when Edgar took over the throne, he had to unseat another and he… well , he blinded him so he wouldn\u0027t cause him any trouble.\" No one said anything about that statement. They all looked at one another. \"I know,\" Jamie rushed out. \"You all think me shameful for believing such gossip.\" \"Now, Jamie, lass, that story happens to be true,\" Gavin finally admitted when he realized no one else was will ing to explain. \"But he didn\u0027t kil his predecessor. He only blinded him.\" \"Aye, the man\u0027s stil alive,\" Marcus interjected. Alec watched the way his soldiers tried to all ay Jamie\u0027s fears. He realized they wanted to protect her feelings as much as he did. \"How can you be smiling, Alec, over such a sin done by your own king?\" \"England\u0027s king is far more ruthless,\" Alec stated. \"You shouldn\u0027t speak ill of Henry,\" she countered. \"Speak ill ? Jamie, I just praised him.\" He looked as if he meant what he\u0027d just said. She gave him a good frown to let him know what she thought of his praise. \"What\u0027s your real worry, wife?\" \"What if he won\u0027t let Mary stay with us?\" \"He will .\" \"You\u0027re certain, Alec?\" Alec nodded. \"Wil I kneel before him, do you suppose?\" she asked. \"If you want to.\" \"Will it make me disloyal to Henry?\" His smile was gentle. The woman was certainly lacking in her history lessons. \"I doubt you\u0027d be disloyal, Jamie. Edgar is Henry\u0027s brother-in-law.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-37.html","bookId":1852,"book":{"id":1852,"title":"The Bride (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #1)","description":"Storyline: By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.
