{"id":79022,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"For his advanced years, Beak could stil move with surprising speed. He rounded the corner and caught Jamie and her sister Mary in the center of the hall way.\\n\\n \"Were you talking to someone, Beak?\" Mary asked. \"I thought I heard—\"\\n\\n \"Just having a little visit with Wildfire,\" Beak lied.\\n\\n \"Jamie said you\u0027d be napping and we\u0027d be able to sneak right inside and take our mounts out for another quick run,\" Mary confessed.\\n\\n \"For heaven\u0027s sake, Mary, you needn\u0027t be tel ing him that.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you did say—\"\\n\\n \"Shame on you, Jamie,\" Beak scolded. \"I never nap and you shouldn\u0027t be sneaking around anywheres.\"\\n\\n He gave her a ridiculous grin. \"It ain\u0027t ladylike.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you do nap,\" Jamie told him. She found his smile contagious. \"You\u0027re in a fit mood today, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"That I am,\" Beak admitted. He tried to hide his eagerness, for he certainly didn\u0027t want Jamie to suspect he was up to mischief. Beak wondered if the lairds were stil lingering over Wildfire. Though the warrior Kincaid couldn\u0027t see Lady Jamie, Beak knew that her voice, so soft and husky, would certainly capture his attention.\\n\\n \"And what are the pair of you up to this fine afternoon, I\u0027m wondering to meself?\" Beak inquired.\\n\\n \"We wanted to go riding,\" Mary said. She gave Beak a puzzled look. \"We just told you that. Are you feeling ill , Beak? Jamie, he looks flushed to me.\"\\n\\n Jamie immediately reached up and touched Beak\u0027s forehead with the back of her hand. \"He doesn\u0027t have fever,\" she told her sister.\\n\\n \"Quit your fretting over me,\" Beak said. \"I\u0027m fit as ever.\"\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027l let us go riding for another hour or two?\" Mary asked.\\n\\n \"You\u0027l be walking and that\u0027s that,\" Beak announced. He folded his arms across his chest to show he meant what he\u0027d said.\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t we ride?\" Mary asked.\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027ve just bedded down the ladies,\" Beak said. \"Your horses have been fed, pampered, and lul ed to sleep.\"\\n\\n Beak had only just finished giving that lie when he remembered the two great stal ions feeding in the stal s adjacent to the front doors. He worried Jamie or Mary might take notice. The sisters usual y came flying through the stables, though, and there was a good chance he could get them back outside before they took a real look around them.\\n\\n \"You should be getting ready for your company,\" Beak blurted out. He grabbed hold of Mary\u0027s right arm and Jamie\u0027s left and started dragging the two of them toward the entrance.\\n\\n \"Mary has convinced me not to worry about our unwanted guests on such a fine afternoon,\" Jamie explained. \"Do quit tugging on my arm, Beak.\"\\n\\n \"We have three full days of freedom,\" Mary interjected. \"Jamie stil has plenty of time to get the household ready.\"\\n\\n \"You could try lending a hand, missy,\" Beak said. \"It would do you good.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t start nagging her, Beak. Mary would help if I asked her assistance.\"\\n\\n Beak didn\u0027t look as if he believed that remark.\\n\\n \"Speaking of asking,\" Mary interjected, \"there\u0027s something I want to ask you, Beak.\"\\n\\n \"Mary, don\u0027t bother Beak with questions now.\"\\n\\n \"I certainly am going to bother Beak,\" Mary told her sister. \"I value his advice as much as you do.\\n\\n Besides, I want to know if you\u0027ve told me the truth.\"\\n\\n \"What a sinful thing to say,\" Jamie replied. Her smile told Beak she really wasn\u0027t the least offended.\\n\\n \"Jamie told me all about these horrible Scots, Beak. I\u0027m thinking of running away. What think you of that bold plan?\"\\n\\n Beak tried not to smile; Lady Mary looked so sincere. \"It would depend on where you\u0027d be running to, I suppose.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, well , I hadn\u0027t actually thought of a true destination yet…\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m wondering why you\u0027d want to run away, Mary,\" Beak said. \"What sorry tales has your sister fil ed your head with? Do you think they\u0027re true or false?\"\\n\\n \"Now, Beak, why would you think I\u0027d lie to my sister?\" Jamie asked, trying not to laugh.\\n\\n \"Because I know how your mind works, Jamie,\" Beak answered. \"You\u0027ve been at it again, haven\u0027t you?\\n\\n What stories have you teased your poor sister with today? I can see you got her quivering with fear. And I happen to know you don\u0027t know spit about the Scots.\"\\n\\n \"I know they\u0027ve got the brains of sheep,\" Jamie answered. She winked at Beak when Mary wasn\u0027t noticing, then added, \"Only those Scots born and raised in the Highlands, of course. The Lowland people are very intel igent, just like you, Beak.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t try soothing me with pretty words,\" Beak countered. \"It ain\u0027t going to work this time. I can see how worried Mary is. Why, she\u0027s wringing the skin right off her hands. What\u0027d you tel her?\"\\n\\n \"I merely mentioned that I\u0027d heard the Scots were a lusty people.\"\\n\\n \"Well, now, Mary, that ain\u0027t so bad,\" Beak admitted.\\n\\n \"With big appetites,\" Mary interjected.\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s a sin?\"\\n\\n \"It is,\" Mary answered.\\n\\n \"Gluttony,\" Jamie supplied, grinning.\\n\\n \"Jamie said they fight all the time.\"\\n\\n \"No, Mary, I said they fight most of the time. If you\u0027re going to repeat my remarks, do get them straight.\"\\n\\n \"Do they, Beak?\"\\n\\n \"Do they what, Mary?\"\\n\\n \"Fight all the time.\"\\n\\n \"I just said they liked to raid,\" Jamie announced with a delicate shrug.\\n\\n Beak noticed the fine blush covering Jamie\u0027s high cheekbones. She was obviously embarrassed that her sister was tel ing on her.\\n\\n Jamie was up to mischief, all right. She was looking just as guilty as she had the time she convinced Mary her papa had signed the order giving the convent guardianship.\\n\\n She did like to jest. She was a sure sight to behold, too, dressed in Beak\u0027s favorite color, a deep royal blue. Her hair was unbound and the thick curls fel in chaotic splendor well past her slender shoulders.\\n\\n There were smudges of dirt on her nose and chin.\\n\\n Beak wished Laird Kincaid could get a clear look at Jamie now, for her violet eyes fairly sparkled with joy.\\n\\n Mary looked just as appealing. She wore pink today, but the pretty gown was bothered with splotches of dirt. Beak wondered what trouble the two sisters had gotten into, then decided he really didn\u0027t want to know.\\n\\n He was pul ed back to the topic of the Scotsmen when Mary blurted out, \"Jamie told me the Scots take what they want when they want it. She also said they have special preferences.\"\\n\\n \"And what might those be?\" Beak asked.\\n\\n \"Strong horses, fat sheep, and soft women,\" Mary said.\\n\\n \"Horses, sheep, and women?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Beak, and in that order. Jamie says they\u0027d rather sleep next to their horses than their women. well ?\\n\\n Is it true? Do the women come last?\"\\n\\n Beak didn\u0027t answer Mary. He stared at Jamie, silently will ing her with his frown to answer her sister. He thought Jamie looked a bit distressed, yet wasn\u0027t certain if she was about to burst into apology or laughter.\\n\\n Laughter won out. \"Honestly, Mary, I was only teasing you.\"\\n\\n \"Just look at the two of you,\" Beak announced. \"Covered with dirt like peasant babies. Fine ladies, indeed! And you, missy,\" he added, pointing his finger at Jamie, \"laughing like a loon. Just what were you two doing in that meadow, I\u0027m wondering?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s trying to turn the topic,\" Mary told her sister. \"I\u0027m going to get an apology from you, Jamie, before I move from this spot. And if I don\u0027t think you\u0027re sincere, then I\u0027m tel ing Father Charles. He\u0027l give you a penance you won\u0027t soon forget.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s your fault, not mine,\" Jamie countered. \"You\u0027re as easy to lead along as a pup.\"\\n\\n Mary turned back to Beak. \"You\u0027d think my sister would be a little more understanding of my predicament. She doesn\u0027t have to stand before the Scottish warlords and pray to God she isn\u0027t chosen.\\n\\n Papa\u0027s bent on hiding her away.\"\\n\\n \"Only because I wasn\u0027t named in the king\u0027s order,\" Jamie reminded her sister.\\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t so sure you weren\u0027t named,\" Beak interjected.\\n\\n \"Papa wouldn\u0027t lie,\" Jamie argued.\\n\\n \"As to that, I won\u0027t be saying you\u0027re right or wrong, Jamie,\" Beak said. \"Mary? Jamie hasn\u0027t told you anything terrible about the Scots as far as I can tel . You\u0027re fretting over nothing, lass.\"\\n\\n \"She told me other stories, Beak,\" Mary said. \"I was suspicious, of course, because her stories were so outrageous. I\u0027m not that gul ible, Beak, no matter what my sister thinks.\"\\n\\n Beak turned to frown at Jamie again. \"Wel , milady?\"\\n\\n Jamie let out a soft sigh. \"I\u0027l admit I did make up some of the stories, but just as many are really true, Beak.\"\\n\\n \"How could you be knowing what\u0027s true and what\u0027s false? You shouldn\u0027t listen to gossip anyway. I taught you better than that.\"\\n\\n \"What gossip?\" Mary asked.\\n\\n \"Scots throw cabers at one another just for the sport of it.\"\\n\\n \"Cabers?\"\\n\\n \"Pine trees, Mary,\" Jamie answered.\\n\\n Mary let out a loud, inelegant snort. \"They don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, they do,\" Jamie countered. \"And if tossing cabers at one another isn\u0027t a barbaric ritual, then I don\u0027t know what is.\"\\n\\n \"You really think I\u0027l believe anything you tel me, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true, Mary,\" Beak admitted. \"They do throw cabers, though not at one another.\"\\n\\n Mary shook her head. \"I can tel by the way you\u0027re grinning at me that you\u0027re teasing me, Beak. Oh, yes, you are,\" she added when he started to protest. \"And I suppose it\u0027s true the Scots wear women\u0027s clothing?\"\\n\\n \"What—\" Beak strangled on a cough. He hoped the warriors had already left the stables, after all , and couldn\u0027t overhear this shameful talk. \"I think we should strol on outside to finish this discussion. It\u0027s too fine a day to be cooped up inside.\"\\n\\n \"It is true,\" Jamie told her sister, ignoring Beak\u0027s suggestion. \"They do wear women\u0027s gowns. Don\u0027t they, Beak?\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027d you hear that blasphemy?\" Beak demanded.\\n\\n \"Cholie told me.\"\\n\\n \"It was Cholie?\" Mary asked. \"Wel , if you\u0027d bothered to mention that fact, I wouldn\u0027t have believed any of your tales. You know as well as I do that the kitchen help tips the jug of ale all day long. Cholie was probably sotted.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, spit,\" Jamie muttered. \"She wasn\u0027t sotted.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, spit?\" Mary repeated. \"Honestly, Jamie, you talk just like Beak.\"\\n\\n \"They do,\" Beak said, trying to stop the budding argument.\\n\\n \"They do what?\" Mary asked.\\n\\n \"Wear clothing that stops at their knees,\" Beak explained.\\n\\n \"There, I told you so, Mary.\"\\n\\n \"Their clothing is called their plaid, Mary. Plaid,\" Beak repeated with a growl. \"It\u0027s their sacred dress. I think they\u0027d take exception to hearing it called a woman\u0027s gown.\"\\n\\n \"Then it\u0027s little wonder to me why they have to fight all the time,\" Jamie interjected. She hadn\u0027t really believed Cholie\u0027s tale, but Beak looked so sincere she was beginning to think he was tel ing the truth.\\n\\n \"Aye,\" Mary agreed. \"They have to defend their gowns.\"\\n\\n \"They aren\u0027t gowns.\"\\n\\n \"Now look what you\u0027ve done, Jamie. You\u0027ve got Beak shouting at us.\"\\n\\n Jamie was immediately contrite. \"I\u0027m sorry, Beak, for upsetting you. My, you are nervous today. You keep looking over your shoulder. Do you think someone\u0027s going to pounce on you from behind? What in—\"\\n\\n \"I missed me nap,\" Beak blurted out. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m surly.\"\\n\\n \"You must go and have a proper rest, then,\" Jamie advised. \"Come along, Mary. Beak\u0027s been so patient with us and I can tel he isn\u0027t feeling at all well .\"\\n\\n She took hold of Mary\u0027s hand and started toward the door. \"Good God, Mary, they actually do wear women\u0027s gowns. I didn\u0027t really believe Cholie, but now I\u0027m convinced.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m running away and that\u0027s that,\" Mary said, loud enough for Beak to overhear. She suddenly stopped, then whirled around. \"One last question, please?\" she called out.\\n\\n \"Yes, Mary?\"\\n\\n \"Would you be knowing if the Scots hate fat women, Beak?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t have any answer for that absurd question. After he shrugged his shoulders, Mary turned around and chased after Jamie. Both sisters lifted the hems of their skirts and started running toward the upper bailey. Beak let out a soft chuckle as he watched the pair.\\n\\n \"She was given a man\u0027s name.\"\\n\\n The stable master nearly jumped out of his tunic. He hadn\u0027t heard Alec Kincaid\u0027s approach. He turned around and came face to shoulders with the giant warrior. \" \u0027Twas her mama\u0027s way of giving her a place in this family. Baron Jamison weren\u0027t the man who fathered Jamie. He claimed her for his own, though. I\u0027l give him that much kindness. Did you get a good look at her, then?\" he added in a rush.\\n\\n Alec nodded.\\n\\n \"You\u0027l be taking her with you, won\u0027t you?\" The Kincaid stared at the old man a long minute before answering.\\n\\n \"Aye, Beak. I\u0027l be taking her with me.\" The choice had been made.\\n\\n Chapter Three\\n\\n Jamie didn\u0027t find out about the Scotsmen\u0027s early arrival until Merlin, the keeper of the pasture cattle, chased her down to tel her there was yet another great commotion going on up at the main house and her papa wanted her to straighten it all out for him.\\n\\n Merlin failed to mention the Scotsmen in his stuttered announcement. It wasn\u0027t his fault, however, for his beautiful mistress had turned her gaze directly upon him just when he was beginning his explanation.\\n\\n Those violet eyes had made him quite awestruck. Then his mistress smiled, causing Merlin\u0027s heart to start fluttering like a sil y little lady\u0027s maid. His mind didn\u0027t flutter, though. No, it merely emptied of all thoughts save one: Lady Jamie was giving him her undivided attention.\\n\\n The stutter only worsened, of course, but it didn\u0027t really matter. Jamie couldn\u0027t immediately obey the summons anyway. There was an injury that needed her immediate attention. Poor old Silas, his eyesight as weak as his hands, was carrying on something fierce, bel owing loud enough, in fact, to cause the pigs to squeal in protest. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-5.html","bookId":1852,"book":{"id":1852,"title":"The Bride (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #1)","description":"Storyline: By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.
