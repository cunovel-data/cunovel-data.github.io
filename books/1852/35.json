{"id":79052,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\"There. Are you happy now, wife?\"\\n\\n He sounded surly enough for Father Murdock to intervene once again. \"Why, the seat\u0027s big enough to swal ow me whole.\"\\n\\n \"My sisters would sit on Papa\u0027s lap after supper, and he would tel the most wonderful stories,\" she confessed, a soft smile on her face over that remembrance.\\n\\n Her voice held a wistful quality Alec hadn\u0027t heard before. He was puzzled by her comment, too, for she\u0027d inadvertently failed to include herself. Or had it been inadvertent? Alec beckoned her forward with a crook of his finger.\\n\\n When she stood directly in front of him and no one could overhear their conversation, he asked her to explain. \"Where did you sit, Jamie? Were you squeezed up next to Mary on one knee or next to one of the twins on the other?\"\\n\\n The picture of four little girls sitting on their father\u0027s lap for their bedtime story made Alec smile. The twins were probably crying, Mary was probably complaining, and Jamie was probably trying to soothe everyone.\\n\\n \"Eleanor and Mary usual y sat on one knee and the twins took up the other side.\"\\n\\n \"Eleanor?\"\\n\\n \"The eldest daughter,\" Jamie explained. \"She died when I was seven summers. Alec, why are you frowning now? Did I say something to upset you?\"\\n\\n \"As usual, you haven\u0027t given me a direct answer,\" Alec pointed out. He was already beginning to understand, yet he wanted to make certain his guess was correct. \"I asked you where you sat.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t. I usual y stood by Papa\u0027s chair,\" she answered. \"Or across the way. Why is it so important to you where I sat?\"\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t important to him, but he believed it had been very important to her. \"Did you never have a turn?\"\\n\\n \"There wasn\u0027t room.\"\\n\\n That simple statement, given so matter-of-factly, all but shattered his composure. She had been the outsider. Alec suddenly wanted to beat her unfeeling stepfather to a bloody pulp. The man damn well should have made room for her.\\n\\n She\u0027d just revealed to him exactly how her mind worked, too. She\u0027d made her father notice her. The duties… yes, it was clear to him now. By making herself indispensable to her papa, she\u0027d forced him to value her. Jamie had confused love with need. He thought that perhaps, in her mind, she really didn\u0027t know the difference.\\n\\n And now she was trying to get him to treat her the same way. The more duties he piled on top of her, the more importance he would be giving her.\\n\\n He was damned if he did and damned if he didn\u0027t. The woman was daft, but she was his woman, and he wanted her to be happy. Stil , he wasn\u0027t about to shorten her life by watching her work herself into an early grave.\\n\\n There was much to consider now. Alec decided not to discuss the issue further until he\u0027d found a way to give her proper instruction in loving and needing. He instinctively knew that simply tel ing her how much he cared for her wouldn\u0027t be enough. He was going to have to find a way to show her.\\n\\n \"No one\u0027s every going to sit in that ill -designed chair, wife,\" Alec announced.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re afraid to try it?\" she chal enged.\\n\\n He let her see his exasperation with her before giving in to her. The chair squeaked under his weight. It fit his back quite nicely too, even when he deliberately pushed the chair to make it rock. He was sure he was going to go flying backwards. He didn\u0027t topple over, though, and he had to smile over that fact.\\n\\n \"I fear you\u0027re right, wife,\" Alec stated. \"It will never catch on. Stil , if you\u0027re up to the jesting you\u0027l be getting when the soldiers see this contraption, I\u0027l all ow you to keep your chair.\"\\n\\n \"Well, of course you\u0027l all ow me to,\" Jamie snapped. She had her hands on her h*ps again.\\n\\n Alec bounded out of the chair so he could tower over her when he deliberately intimidated her. \"You may keep this by the hearth,\" he announced.\\n\\n \"And now I\u0027l have your appreciation.\"\\n\\n \"And will iam?\" she asked, ignoring his suggestion that she give him proper thanks.\\n\\n \"Will iam can go to—\"\\n\\n \"The bedroom?\" Father Murdock blurted out as he bounded down the steps.\\n\\n \"He isn\u0027t the last face I want to see before I fal asleep,\" Alec snapped. \"Put him in the wine cel ar if you\u0027re bent on hanging him someplace, Jamie, but I don\u0027t want to see his face again.\"\\n\\n Jamie looked as if she wanted to argue with her husband. Father Murdock clasped her hand in both of his. \"One bite at a time, sweet lass,\" he whispered to her.\\n\\n Alec gave the priest a hard look, then went over to the table and poured himself a goblet of ale. The priest chased after him, pul ing Jamie in his wake.\\n\\n \"Il have me a goblet of water,\" he told Alec. A sudden thought made the priest\u0027s eyebrows wobble again. \"Do you know, Alec, what you get when you mix water with ale?\"\\n\\n Alec nodded. \"Watered-down ale,\" he announced.\\n\\n \"And once you\u0027ve mixed the two, you can\u0027t separate them, can you?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" Alec returned. \"What are you trying to tel me, Father?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wanting her to settle in,\" Murdock answered. \"I\u0027ve heard you say so many times.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t deny it,\" Alec answered. \"She will settle in.\"\\n\\n \"Do you want her to change? Do you want her to become someone else?\"\\n\\n \"No, she pleases me the way she is,\" Alec admitted.\\n\\n Jamie knew he\u0027d just complimented her, but his gruff voice and frown certainly soured his praise.\\n\\n \"Then you don\u0027t want her to become a Scottish lass?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not\"\\n\\n His voice was so emphatic that Father Murdock guessed he was as surprised as Jamie was by his own strong conviction. \"She\u0027s English. She can\u0027t change that fact. But she will settle in.\"\\n\\n \"And so will you.\"\\n\\n The priest\u0027s remark fel between them. A long minute later, Alec responded. \"Explain yourself. My patience wears as thin as watered-down ale.\"\\n\\n \"Jamie\u0027s rich in her own special way of doing things. Her traditions are part of her,\" Father Murdock said.\\n\\n \"Just as you have your own traditions. Can you not blend the two in a peaceful manner? A fine tapestry of our King Edgar would look handsome hanging right next to will iam. What think you of that idea?\"\\n\\n Alec didn\u0027t much like the idea, but he could tel by his wife\u0027s smile she thought it had merit. Her tender feelings got in the way of his true opinions, however, and he found himself reluctantly agreeing.\\n\\n \"Very well ,\" he stated. \"But the dimensions will be larger than will iam.\"\\n\\n Jamie was too happy with his compliance to argue over the size of the tapestry. She personal y thought Edgar\u0027s likeness should be fashioned in half the size, but she guessed she\u0027d have to make them equal.\\n\\n Alec would be bound to notice. Yes, she\u0027d make them equal. She wasn\u0027t going to put a halo atop Edgar\u0027s head, though, and that was that.\\n\\n \"Thank you, Alec,\" she murmured.\\n\\n The smile she gave him told him she thought he\u0027d just done the bending. He was determined, however, to have the last word. \"Marcus, remove that tapestry until Edgar\u0027s is completed. The soldiers will be coming inside for their meal soon. They\u0027l be too sick to train this afternoon if they have to look at him while they eat.\"\\n\\n Father Murdock waited until his laird had left the hall before he let his amusement show. The old man gave Jamie a slow wink, then strol ed out of the hall , whistling a snappy Scottish tune between his chuckles. The priest couldn\u0027t wait for the next storm to start brewing.\\n\\n In the Highlands, when it rained, it hailed. Jamie had just asked Marcus and Gavin if they didn\u0027t have something they needed to do. She\u0027d just started back up the stairs and noticed the two of them chasing after her.\\n\\n Both soldiers shook their heads. She put them to work then, carrying her baggage up to the clean bedroom. She thought it strange the important soldiers would want to do servants\u0027 work.\\n\\n When her tasks were finished, she came back downstairs to repair her appearance. She noticed Annie and Edith standing together near the hearth. They\u0027d been staring at her chair, but both turned when she called out a greeting to them.\\n\\n Annie was smiling until she caught Edith\u0027s dark scowl. Then she joined in and scowled, too.\\n\\n Jamie didn\u0027t pay any attention to Annie. The child couldn\u0027t help the way she was. Edith was another kettle of fish altogether.\\n\\n Jamie thought Edith had to be the most unbending woman in all of Scotland. There was a rigidness in her bearing and appearance that wasn\u0027t at all appealing. The woman always had her hair plaited into a crown atop her head. There was never a single strand left unattended. Her plaid gown was always spotless, too.\\n\\n Jamie had never seen her disheveled. Yes, Edith was as thorough in her grooming as she was in her hatred for her mistress.\\n\\n And her mistress had had enough.\\n\\n \"What happened to you?\" Edith called out, a snarl in her voice. \"Did you fal into a bucket of suds?\"\\n\\n Marcus had been standing behind Jamie. He took a step forward, all but blocking her view with his broad back, and shouted at his sister. \"Don\u0027t you dare use that tone of voice with your laird\u0027s wife.\"\\n\\n Jamie felt as though she were in the middle of thunderclouds. Marcus\u0027s roar made her head start pounding. She prodded Marcus\u0027s shoulder, and when he\u0027d turned around, she asked him for permission to handle his sister.\\n\\n He immediately nodded agreement.\\n\\n Jamie walked to the center of the hall . \"Annie, go outside, child. Edith, you\u0027l stay right where you are.\"\\n\\n Her voice must have lacked authority, she guessed, when Edith completely ignored her command and started for the doorway.\\n\\n Marcus intervened once again. His harsh command made Edith come to an abrupt stop.\\n\\n Jamie turned to thank him, then asked if she could have a few minutes alone with Edith. In truth, she didn\u0027t want any witnesses to her conversation.\\n\\n Gavin answered her. He stood on the bottom step, scowling fiercely at Edith. \"Neither one of us is leaving.\"\\n\\n She decided not to argue with the soldier. He did look quite determined. She walked back over to Marcus. When she was standing directly in front of him, she brushed her hair out of her eyes and motioned him closer to her.\\n\\n Her whisper was so soft that only he could hear what she was saying. Marcus\u0027s expression didn\u0027t change, but when she was finished, he gave her a quick nod.\\n\\n She thanked the soldier, then turned to confront his sister.\\n\\n \"Since the moment I arrived here, you\u0027ve treated me like a leper,\" she told Edith. \"I\u0027m quite tired of your attitude.\"\\n\\n Edith snickered right in her mistress\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re unwil ing to try to get along, then?\" she asked, her voice harder.\\n\\n \"I see no reason to get along with the likes of you,\" Edith muttered.\\n\\n \"Marcus?\" Jamie called out. She hated having to ask his assistance, but she wanted to push through Edith\u0027s anger.\\n\\n \"Yes, milady?\"\\n\\n \"If I ask Alec to have Edith removed from Kincaid land by nightfal , will he agree?\"\\n\\n Edith let out a loud gasp.\\n\\n \"He will .\"\\n\\n \"Where will I go?\" Edith asked. \"Marcus, you cannot let—\"\\n\\n \"Silence!\"\\n\\n Neither Marcus nor Gavin had ever heard Jamie use that tone of voice. Gavin smiled in reaction. The look of outrage on Edith\u0027s face made him want to laugh.\\n\\n Edith\u0027s hands were clenched at her sides. She was obviously furious. That wasn\u0027t good enough. Jamie wanted to push her beyond reason. She hoped that once her anger was completely out of control, she wouldn\u0027t guard her words. Then Jamie would be able to find out why her hatred was so fierce.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m mistress here, Edith,\" she said in a low, arrogant voice. \"If I wish you to become an outcast, I will get my way.\"\\n\\n \"Marcus would never let you.\"\\n\\n \"He would,\" Jamie boasted. Lord, she hated the horrible lies she was tel ing. \"He\u0027s your brother, and your guardian, too, but Alec is his laird. Marcus is loyal to my husband,\" she added. \"Unlike you. Yon aren\u0027t loyal to anyone, are you?\"\\n\\n \"I am,\" Edith shouted.\\n\\n \"Perhaps once you were,\" Jamie countered, affecting a shrug. \"Yes, you were probably loyal to Alec when he was wed to Helena. Father Murdock told me you were very close to Alec\u0027s first wife.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t replace her. I won\u0027t let you.\"\\n\\n \"I already have.\"\\n\\n Those last taunting words snapped the shreds of control to which Edith was clinging. Before she could stop herself, she lashed out at her mistress.\\n\\n Al she wanted to do was take the smug look off Jamie\u0027s face.\\n\\n She wanted to hurt her mistress as much as Jamie was hurting her.\\n\\n Jamie had been waiting for the attack. She was smal er than Edith in stature, but much stronger. She\u0027d captured Edith\u0027s wrist and had the woman kneeling on the floor before she\u0027d finished her first scream.\\n\\n Both Marcus and Gavin had rushed forward to intervene. They stopped when they reached Jamie\u0027s side.\\n\\n \"Stay out of this,\" she told the men while she kept her stare on her prey. She wasn\u0027t holding Edith\u0027s wrist now, but clasping her hand against her waist. She was gently stroking Edith\u0027s shoulder, too, and trying to maintain her balance at the same time. Edith was sobbing against Jamie\u0027s skirts.\\n\\n No one said a word until Edith had gained a bit of control. \"Oh, my God, I was going to strike you! I\u0027m so sorry,\" Edith whispered. \"When I saw you and Father Murdock moving Helena\u0027s chest out of the bedroom, I was so incensed. I didn\u0027t want you to throw her things away. I\u0027ve been so fil ed with —\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t going to throw Helena\u0027s things away,\" Jamie explained. \"I just moved the chest to the other bedroom, Edith.\"\\n\\n \"Her baby\u0027s clothes were in the chest,\" Edith continued, as if she hadn\u0027t heard Jamie\u0027s explanation. \"She\u0027d worked so diligently on the little gowns.\"\\n\\n \"She wanted to have Alec\u0027s child, then?\" Jamie asked, her voice a gentle caress.\\n\\n \"Please say you forgive me, milady,\" Edith sobbed, returning to her other worry. \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t hurt me, Edith. And I\u0027m sorry, too.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sorry?\" Edith asked. She stil knelt on the floor and turned her face up to Jamie. Tears were streaming down her cheeks. Jamie used the hem of her bliaut to mop the wetness away. \"I\u0027m sorry for all the hurtful lies I just told you. Edith, you were so set against me; I did have to use a little trickery to get your attention.\"\\n\\n \"You aren\u0027t going to send me away?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-35.html","bookId":1852,"book":{"id":1852,"title":"The Bride (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #1)","description":"Storyline: By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.
