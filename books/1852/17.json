{"id":79034,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"She ended their conversation by nudging Wildfire into a full gal op, deliberately taking the lead away from him. She ignored him when he called out to her, determined to make him stay behind her today. Let him choke on the dust from the lead horse. Alec was suddenly at her side. He took hold of Wildfire\u0027s reins. He never said a word to her, just turned her mount around and tossed the reins back to her. \"Well?\" she asked. \"You were going the wrong way,\" Alec told her, his exasperation obvious. \"Unless of course you were thinking of going back to England.\" \"I wasn\u0027t.\" \"Then your sense of direction is yet another—\" \"A simple mistake, Alec,\" Jamie argued. \"I have a fine sense of direction.\" \"Have you been many places to test this theory?\" \"No. And while you\u0027re scowling at me, I have another question to put to you. Were you pleased with me last night?\" He looked as if he wanted to laugh. Jamie thought she\u0027d kil him if he did. \"Well? Was I any good at it? And don\u0027t you dare ask me to explain my question. You know very well what I\u0027m talking about.\" She would die if he told her she wasn\u0027t any good. Her hands were squeezing the reins tightly, making indentations in her palms, so horribly nervous had she suddenly become, and she was furious with herself for asking. \"You\u0027l get better.\" He knew exactly what to say to her to get her temper riled. She thought there might be fire in her eyes when she looked up at him. Alec was smiling at her. The tenderness in his eyes told her he knew how important her question was to her. \"I\u0027l get better?\" she strangled out. \"Why you—\" \"We\u0027l practice, Jamie, once we get home, every single night, until you get it right.\" That promise given, he nudged his stal ion forward. Jamie didn\u0027t know what to make of his outrageous remark. She thought he\u0027d just insulted her, but the way he was looking at her when he said they were going to practice did make her think he was looking forward to it. No matter how she looked at it, she always came up with the same conclusion: Alec Kincaid had about as much compassion as a goat. Stil , she guessed she should give him his due. He had acted with true kindness when he all owed her to sleep well past dawn. She\u0027d needed the additional rest, and though she blamed Alec for draining all the strength out of her the night before, she stil admitted he\u0027d shown a little mercy. Perhaps he wasn\u0027t completely hopeless, after all . Jamie changed her mind about her husband by late afternoon. They\u0027d ridden through the woods most of the morning, pausing only once to refresh themselves by a rippling river. Alec barely spoke a civil word to her. He seemed preoccupied with his own thoughts. Jamie tried, several times in fact, to engage him in conversation, but Alec ignored her questions with a rudeness she found disconcerting. He stood on the grassy bank, his hands clasped behind his back. Jamie guessed he was impatient to continue their journey. \"Are you waiting for the horses to have their rest or for me?\" she called out when she couldn\u0027t stand the silence a moment longer. \"The horses are ready,\" he answered. He hadn\u0027t even bothered to look at her when he spoke. She briefly considered pushing him into the river to get his full attention, then decided against it. If he didn\u0027t drown, he would surely be spitting mad, and she had enough to worry about with her own aches and pains. Listening to him rant and rave would only make her day all the more sour. Jamie settled herself on Wildfire\u0027s back before cal ing out to Alec again. \"I\u0027m ready now. Thank you for stopping.\" \"You asked.\" His voice was so fil ed with surprise she was taken aback. \"I must always ask?\" \"Of course.\" Well , hel , he could have mentioned that odd little rule hours sooner. \"And you\u0027l always honor my requests, Alec?\" He swung up into his saddle before answering her. \"If it\u0027s possible.\" Their horses were so close together that Alec\u0027s leg brushed against hers. \"Then why didn\u0027t you stop when I asked you to last night?\" she blurted out. He grabbed hold of the back of her neck and pul ed her toward him. Jamie clung to the saddle, trying to keep her balance. He waited for her to look up at him, then easily captured her gaze. \"You didn\u0027t want me to.\" He grinned at her. \"That is the most arrogant—\" He kissed her just to silence her. He meant only to remind her just who was the laird and who was the chattel, but her lips went all soft under his, reminding him just how good she really was. He swept the inside of her mouth with his tongue before pul ing away from her. She looked total y bemused. Her hand rested on his cheek, her touch as light as a butterfly. He doubted she even realized she was stil caressing him. \"I said I\u0027d honor your requests whenever possible, Jamie. It wasn\u0027t possible for me to stop last night.\" \"It wasn\u0027t?\" The woman was going to make him daft if she continued to ask him to repeat his every word. Alec let her see his exasperation. \"You may take the lead this time,\" he announced, thinking to snap her back to the present. Jamie nodded. She guided Wildfire around Alec\u0027s mount and was just ducking under a fat branch barring her way when Alec appeared at her side. The minute he took hold of her reins, she realized her error. He didn\u0027t mention her pitiful sense of direction, and neither did she. They stopped at sunset in the center of a wide meadow. Alec reached out to pul on Wildfire\u0027s reins. When their mounts were side by side, he stil didn\u0027t let go of the reins. His face was impassive now and he stared straight ahead. \"Is there danger, Alec?\" She hadn\u0027t been able to keep her worry out of her voice. Alec shook his head. Would he be sitting in the middle of such an open expanse if there was danger? Her question seemed absurd until he remembered she had no knowledge of the ways of fighting men. Jamie thought she\u0027d stretch her legs a bit but when she started to dismount, Alec stayed her action by placing his hand on her thigh. His grip wasn\u0027t at all gentle. She caught his silent message quickly enough, but his behavior didn\u0027t make any sense to her. She folded her hands on the cantle of her saddle, patiently waiting for Alec to explain what he was doing. A faint whistle sounded from the forest a fair distance away from them. The trees suddenly seemed to come alive when men wearing brown and yel ow plaid began to walk toward them. Jamie didn\u0027t realize she was clutching Alec\u0027s leg until his hand covered hers. \"They\u0027re all ies, Jamie.\" She immediately let go of him, straightened her back, and refolded her hands in her lap. \"I guessed as much,\" she whispered. It was a lie, made blacker stil when she added, \"Even from this distance I can see them smiling.\" \"An eagle couldn\u0027t see their faces from this distance,\" he answered dryly. \"We English have perfect eyesight.\" Alec finally turned to look at her. \"Are you jesting with me, wife?\" \"You decide, husband.\" \"Aye, you are,\" Alec answered. \"I\u0027ve already learned all about the English sense of humor.\" \"And what have you learned?\" \"You don\u0027t have any.\" \"That isn\u0027t true,\" Jamie argued. \"Why, I have the most wonderful sense of humor.\" After making that emphatic statement, she turned her face away from him. \"Jamie?\" \"Aye, Alec?\" \"When they reach us, keep your gaze directed on me. Do not look at anyone else. Do you understand?\" \"You don\u0027t want me to look at any of them?\" \"That\u0027s correct.\" \"Why?\" \"Don\u0027t question my motives, wife.\" His voice had become as brisk as the rising wind. \"Should I speak to them?\" \"No.\" \"They\u0027l think me rude.\" \"They\u0027l think you subservient.\" \"I\u0027m not.\" \"You will be.\" Jamie felt her face heat up. She frowned at Alec, but it was wasted effort for he was staring straight ahead again, ignoring her. \"Perhaps, Alec, I should get off my horse and kneel at your feet. Then your all ies will surely see how very subservient your wife is.\" She didn\u0027t care that her voice shook with anger. \"Wel , milord?\" \"The suggestion has merit,\" he answered. He didn\u0027t sound as if he was jesting with her. Jamie was too astonished by his outrageous comment to think of a clever comeback. She wasn\u0027t about to let her displeasure show in front of strangers, though, no matter how upset she was with her husband. Oh, she\u0027d play the obedient wife, all right, until she and Alec were alone again. Then she was going to blister his ears. When the all ies finally reached them, Jamie kept her gaze directed on her husband\u0027s hard profile. It took all her concentration to keep her expression devoid of any true emotion. Serenity was simply too much to ask for. Alec never even looked her way. The conversation was in Gaelic. Jamie understood most of the words, even though the dialect was a little different from the Lowland Gaelic that Beak had taught her. Alec didn\u0027t know she was fluent in his language, and his ignorance gave her a perverse satisfaction. She decided then and there she was never going to enlighten him. She listened to him refuse the all ies\u0027 offer of drink, food, and shelter as well . His hard, unyielding manner was that of a mighty warlord now, and when they\u0027d finished with their offers and he\u0027d finished with his refusals, they reported to him the latest happenings among the clans. Jamie knew they were staring at her. She tried to keep her expression tranquil. In true desperation she offered her Maker a month of daily masses and one litany if he\u0027d only help her through this humiliating ordeal. Alec was ashamed of her. That sudden realization made her want to weep. Her self-pity lasted only a minute or two. Then she became furious. How dare he be ashamed of her? She knew she wasn\u0027t as pretty as most, but she wasn\u0027t horribly disfigured, either. Once her papa had even called her beautiful. Of course, it was his duty to give her such praise; she was his baby after all , and his opinion was certainly colored. Stil , she\u0027d never noticed people turning their faces away from her so they wouldn\u0027t lose their supper. When Alec reached over and took hold of Wildfire\u0027s reins, Jamie was pul ed back to the conversation. She heard one of his all ies ask who she was. \"My wife.\" There hadn\u0027t been a tinge of pride in his voice. God\u0027s truth, he could have been referring to his dog. No, she qualified; his dog probably meant more to him. He hadn\u0027t gagged over the words either, Jamie decided, trying to find something redeeming in his attitude. Alec was about to nudge his mount forward through the throng of warriors when another all y called out. \"By what name is she cal ed, Kincaid?\" He took a long time answering. Alec slowly scanned his audience. The look on his face chil ed Jamie. His expression could have been carved in stone. And then he answered at last. His voice, as cold as sleet, lashed out like a battle cry. \"Mine.\" Chapter Eight She was beginning to think he wasn\u0027t human. Alec never seemed to get hungry or thirsty or tired. The only time he stopped to rest was when Jamie asked him to, and God only knew how she hated asking him for anything. An Englishman certainly would have seen to his wife\u0027s comforts. Alec had difficulty remembering he had a wife. Jamie felt as wanted as a thorn in his side. She was exhausted, guessed she probably looked as worn out as an old hag, too, then told herself it didn\u0027t matter what she looked like. Alec had made his position perfectly dear when he refused to introduce her to his all ies. She didn\u0027t appeal to him at all . Well , he wasn\u0027t any prize, either, she decided. His hair was almost as long as hers, for God\u0027s sake, and if that wasn\u0027t a primitive inclination, she didn\u0027t know what was. Her feelings about her husband might not have been so black if his attitude had been a little more pleasant. The mountain air had obviously affected his mind, for the higher they climbed, the more distant and cold his manner became. He had more flaws than Satan. The man couldn\u0027t even count. He\u0027d specifical y told her it would take them three days to reach his holding, yet here they were, camped for their fifth night, and stil not another Kincaid plaid in sight. Was his sense of direction as poor as his ability to count? Jamie decided she was too tired to worry about that possibility. As soon as Alec turned his attention to the horses, Jamie walked to the lake to gain a few moments\u0027 privacy. She stripped down to her chemise, washed as best she could in the frigid water Alec called a loch, then stretched out on the grassy slope. She was bone-weary. She thought to just close her eyes for a few minutes before getting dressed again. In truth, the bitterness in the air didn\u0027t even bother her. A thick mist rol ed into the glen. Alec gave Jamie as much time as he thought she needed to see to her bath, but when the haze covered his bare feet, he called out to her, commanding that she come to him. His summons went unanswered. Alec\u0027s heart started pounding. He wasn\u0027t worried that his enemies had caught her unaware. No, they were on Kincaid land now, in a protected area none but his own would dare to breach. Stil , she hadn\u0027t answered him. Alec broke through the lush green foliage and came to an abrupt stop. His breath caught in his throat at the sight he came upon. She looked like a beautiful goddess. She was sound asleep. The fog floated around her, giving her a mystical appearance. The streamers of sunlight only added to that fantasy, for her skin was a true golden color. She was sleeping on her side. The white chemise she wore rode high on her hip, revealing her long legs. He stood there a long while, drinking his fil . Desire swel ed up inside him until it became almost painful. She was simply magnificent to him. He remembered what it felt like to have those legs wrapped around him, remembered the feel of her when he thrust inside. His wife. A fierce surge of possessiveness shook him. He knew he wouldn\u0027t last another night without making love to her again. His promise to wait until they\u0027d reached his holding wasn\u0027t going to last. This time, however, he was determined to go slowly. He would be a tender, undemanding lover. And he\u0027d be gentle… even if it kil ed him. Alec stood there watching her sleep until the sun was completely gone. She started to rol down the slope then. He rushed over to her and caught her in his arms just in the nick of time.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-17.html","bookId":1852,"book":{"id":1852,"title":"The Bride (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #1)","description":"Storyline: By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.
