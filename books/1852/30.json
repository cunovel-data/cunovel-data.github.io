She turned around immediately, a worried expression on her face.\\n\\n \"Father, you shouldn\u0027t be running until your chest is better,\" she called out. The priest climbed the steps and grabbed her arm. \"Alec just saw the hole in the back wall .\" She gave him a gentle smile. \"He was bound to notice, Father.\"\\n\\n It was clear to him that the sweet lass didn\u0027t understand her jeopardy. \"You\u0027d best come along with me to the chapel until Alec hears all the soldiers\u0027\\n\\n explanations. He\u0027l calm down in an hour or two. Then you can—\"\\n\\n \"Have more faith in your laird,\" Jamie countered. \"He\u0027l see the rightness in the change, once it\u0027s finished.\\n\\n I\u0027m sure of it, Father. Besides, he won\u0027t yel at me. I have his promise. Please don\u0027t worry. I\u0027l go inside and explain it all to Alec. I\u0027m certainly not afraid.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Tis your lack of fear that has me most afeared,\" the old man admitted. He knew Alec wouldn\u0027t touch her in anger. Stil , he could destroy her delicate feelings with his shouts. Father Murdock made a hasty sign of the cross after Jamie patted his hand and walked inside. He was too weak in his knees to go after her.\\n\\n Jamie braced herself against her husband\u0027s irritation and hurried on into the hall . She came to an abrupt stop when she saw what was going on.\\n\\n Alec was sitting at the head of the table. A soldier stood at his side, giving his accounting.\\n\\n Alec didn\u0027t look overly upset. His elbow rested on the tabletop and his forehead rested in his hand. He looked more weary than angry.\\n\\n Al the soldiers who\u0027d worked on dismantling the kitchen building were there, too.\\n\\n Well , hel , they were standing in line, obviously waiting their turn to tel on her. Jamie gave them a good frown to let them know what she thought of their disloyalty, then walked toward her husband.\\n\\n When he finally glanced up, Jamie froze. He was furious. The tic was back in his clenched jaw. His eyes were blazing with anger. The wind didn\u0027t aid her cause much either. The whistling sound coming through the large hole reminded Alec of what she\u0027d done.\\n\\n He stared at her for a long silent moment. \"I would like to explain,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Leave this room immediately, wife.\"\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t raised his voice to her, but his rude command stung just the same.\\n\\n \"Alec, you promised me you wouldn\u0027t forget your temper,\" she reminded him. Heaven help her, she was suddenly quite terrified by the look in his eyes.\\n\\n He did yel at her then. \"Get out before I… now, wife.\"\\n\\n Jamie nodded. She rushed over to the mantel, grabbed a coin from the box, and then walked out of the hall with as much dignity as she could muster under such humiliating circumstances.\\n\\n Edith and Annie were standing near the entrance. They snickered when she passed them.\\n\\n Jamie didn\u0027t start crying until she reached the stables. She ordered Donald to ready Wildfire. The stable master didn\u0027t argue with her command, and once he\u0027d helped her mount her horse, he asked if he should prepare Alec\u0027s steed.\\n\\n She shook her head, then started for the gate.\\n\\n Father Murdock was standing in the courtyard, waiting for her to pass him.\\n\\n Jamie leaned down and handed him her coin. \"He lied to me,\" she whispered. \"This is for an indulgence for his soul.\"\\n\\n Murdock grabbed hold of the stirrup. \"Where are you going, lass?\" he asked, pretending not to notice her tears. \"You have me worrying.\"\\n\\n \"Out.\"\\n\\n \"Out?\"\\n\\n \"His order, Father, and I am ever dutiful. Which way is England?\"\\n\\n The priest was too stunned to point the direction. Jamie guessed it was downhil . \"Thank you for being kind to me,\" she said.\\n\\n She left the priest staring after her with his mouth hanging open in disbelief.\\n\\n Jamie knew he\u0027d eventual y go and tel on her, then decided it didn\u0027t matter. Alec wouldn\u0027t come after her. She wasn\u0027t significant enough. He\u0027d be happy to be rid of her.\\n\\n She thought she\u0027d have trouble at the drawbridge, yet after she\u0027d explained that she was doing their laird\u0027s bidding, the soldiers immediately let her pass.\\n\\n She let Wildfire race with the wind then. Jamie simply held on, openly weeping. She didn\u0027t know where they were headed or how long they continued at the neck-breaking pace. In truth, she didn\u0027t care about anything but having her cry. When the horse finally stopped in the shelter of the trees, Jamie decided it was time to regain a bit of control.\\n\\n She saw the boy then. He wasn\u0027t a Kincaid, she realized, as his plaid was of a different color. Jamie didn\u0027t make a sound. She hoped the boy wouldn\u0027t notice her, for she didn\u0027t want anyone to see her in such a disgraceful condition, not even a child.\\n\\n The boy was too preoccupied to look behind him. He was staring intently at the bushes to his right. Jamie wondered what held him so entranced.\\n\\n He suddenly cried out and started to back away just as a giant boar let out a vile-sounding snort and charged forward.\\n\\n Jamie instinctively reacted. She slapped Wildfire\u0027s flank, sending her into a full gal op. The mare flew down the slope.\\n\\n Jamie clutched the reins and Wildfire\u0027s mane in her left hand and leaned to the right side.\\n\\n The child saw her coming. He started running toward her, his hands outstretched. Jamie prayed she had the strength to lift the boy. God proved merciful. With the child\u0027s eager assistance and his death grip on her right arm, she was able to haul him up high enough for him to swing one leg over Wildfire\u0027s back.\\n\\n They both held on for dear life. The boar gave up his chase a few minutes later, but Wildfire was stil prickly with fear. The horse suddenly turned.\\n\\n Jamie and the boy went tumbling to the ground.\\n\\n She landed on her side. He landed on top of her. He quickly rol ed to the side, then stood and tried to help her.\\n\\n He was tugging on her right arm. She grimaced against the pain. \"Are you hurt?\" the child asked, his fear obvious in his thick Gaelic burr.\\n\\n \"Just bruised,\" Jamie answered in Gaelic. She slowly regained her feet, then noticed her bliaut was torn at the shoulder seam.\\n\\n They were standing in the center of a narrow clearing. Jamie was shaking from head to toe. \"We\u0027ve had a close cal , we have,\" she announced.\\n\\n \"Lord, I was scared. Were you?\" she asked when the boy looked up at her.\\n\\n The child nodded.\\n\\n They both smiled then. \"We gave him what-for, didn\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n \"Aye, we did give him what-for,\" she said, thinking to herself what an adorable child he was. He had long red hair. It curled around his cherubic face.\\n\\n His nose was painted with large freckles. \"I\u0027m Lady Kincaid,\" she continued. \"And your name?\"\\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t be tel ing,\" the boy whispered. \"I\u0027m not supposed to be on Kincaid land.\"\\n\\n \"Did you get lost?\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"You\u0027l tel .\"\\n\\n \"No, I won\u0027t tel . What are you doing here, then?\"\\n\\n The child lifted his shoulders in a shrug. \"I like to go hunting. My name\u0027s Lindsay.\"\\n\\n \"And what is your clan\u0027s name?\"\\n\\n \"Lindsay,\" he repeated. \"You speak Gaelic, but you sound different. You aren\u0027t wearing the Kincaid plaid, either.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m English.\"\\n\\n His eyes widened.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Alec Kincaid\u0027s wife, Lindsay,\" she explained. \"How old are you?\"\\n\\n \"Nine, this summer.\"\\n\\n \"Your mother will be looking for you, I would think.\"\\n\\n \"My father will be doing the looking. He\u0027l be getting worried,\" he added. \"I better go home now.\"\\n\\n Jamie nodded. She didn\u0027t smile, for the child\u0027s expression had turned very serious.\\n\\n \"You saved my life,\" the boy said. \"Father must repay.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Jamie countered. \"He doesn\u0027t have to repay. You have to promise me you won\u0027t go hunting on your own again. will you give me your word?\"\\n\\n When he nodded, she smiled. \"Do you want me to fol ow you home?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027d keep you if you did. We\u0027re feuding with the Kincaids,\" he explained very matter-of-factly.\\n\\n \"Be careful, then,\" she cautioned. \"Hurry. I think I hear someone coming.\"\\n\\n The child disappeared behind the line of trees before Jamie had taken a step toward Wildfire.\\n\\n She was standing all alone in the center of the clearing when Alec and his stal ion broke through the branches. He was so relieved to see her that he stopped his mount and sat there, staring down at her, while he calmed his ragged breathing.\\n\\n Alec couldn\u0027t tel if she was upset or not. Her head was bowed. He knew he\u0027d terrified her. The look on her face when he\u0027d shouted at her had shown how frightened she was.\\n\\n He hoped to heaven she\u0027d gotten over her fear, though… and her tears. He\u0027d noticed those, too, when she walked past him with her coin in her hand.\\n\\n Hel , he\u0027d probably have to apologize. He wasn\u0027t any good at it, he knew, but he\u0027d stil have to give it a try, he decided. He would force himself to be calm… and reasonable.\\n\\n Then he noticed the leaves in her hair and the tear in her gown. \"What the hel happened?\" he shouted.\\n\\n \"Did someone…\"\\n\\n He was off his stal ion and racing toward her before she could answer. Jamie took a quick step back.\\n\\n \"Nothing happened to me,\" she announced.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t lie to me.\" He grabbed her in his arms and pul ed her up against his chest.\\n\\n \"You lied to me.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t,\" he answered, calming once again.\\n\\n \"You lost your temper with me.\"\\n\\n \"You had the men tear out the back wall of my home,\" he countered.\\n\\n \"You said I could rearrange your kitchens,\" Jamie whispered. \"In the winter, Frieda and Hessie and all the other servants have to wade through the snow to get your supper. I was trying to do the right thing, Alec. It made sense to add the building onto the back of the house. You wouldn\u0027t let me explain, though.\"\\n\\n Alec closed his eyes and prayed for patience. He couldn\u0027t seem to quit hugging her long enough to lecture her. \"I did forget my temper,\" he admitted. \"And I\u0027m furious with you.\"\\n\\n \"Because of the hole in your wall ?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he told her. \"Because you were afraid of me. Did you think I\u0027d hurt you?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she answered. She put her arms around his waist and relaxed against him. \"You embarrassed me.\\n\\n A husband shouldn\u0027t yel at his wife.\"\\n\\n \"I will try in future to remember this dictate,\" he promised. \"Jamie, there will be times when I will forget again.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027l have to get used to it, I suppose,\" she said. \"Your shout could fel a pine tree. But you\u0027re mostly bluster, aren\u0027t you, Alec?\" Alec rested his chin on the top of her head while he decided whether or not to let her get away with that smal insult. \"Father Murdock said you were going back to England.\\n\\n Was that your intent?\"\\n\\n \"You told me to get out,\" she reminded him.\\n\\n A smile eased his frown away. \"I meant for you to leave the hall , Jamie, not Scotland.\"\\n\\n \"I just wanted to leave for a while, husband. \u0027Tis the truth I\u0027m not settling in very well .\"\\n\\n She sounded terribly forlorn. \"I know you\u0027l find this difficult to believe, but back home people actually liked me. They did! I\u0027m not at all used to being thought of as inferior, Alec. That does take some adjustment. Your soldiers were waiting to tel on me, weren\u0027t they? They don\u0027t like me any better than you do.\"\\n\\n Jamie suddenly burst into tears. \"Oh, I\u0027m being pitiful, aren\u0027t I? Why did you bother to come after me?\"\\n\\n \"Jamie, the soldiers were waiting to have their chance to defend you,\" he announced. His voice was a gruff, aifectionate whisper. \"They\u0027re as loyal to you as they are to me, wife.\"\\n\\n He let her pul away so she could see his nod. It was his undoing, however, for once he saw the tears streaming down her cheeks, his discipline all but deserted him. \"I came after you because you belong to me. Don\u0027t ever try to leave me again, Jamie, or you\u0027l truly see my anger. Love, quit your tears now. I didn\u0027t mean to…\"\\n\\n His voice shook too much to continue. Alec leaned down and kissed her brow. Jamie mopped at the corners of her eyes with the backs of her hands. Her arm started throbbing from her bruising, reminding her of her mishap. \"I fel off my horse,\" she admitted.\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n Now he sounded forlorn. Jamie smiled. \"I\u0027m really very skil ed, Alec, but the boar frightened Wildfire and…\"\\n\\n She quit trying to explain when she saw his frown. \"Never mind,\" she said. \"Alec? When a husband and wife have had a disagreement, they usual y kiss after they\u0027ve made up.\"\\n\\n \"The wife is wearing her husband\u0027s plaid, though,\" Alec pointed out. \"Stil , I wouldn\u0027t break my word if she wasn\u0027t wearing anything at all .\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t understand his meaning until he\u0027d pul ed her torn bliaut over her head and tossed it on the ground.\\n\\n \"You cannot mean to—to—\" she stammered. She took a step back.\\n\\n \"Oh, I mean to, all right.\" He took a step forward.\\n\\n She let out a scream of laughter when he lunged for her, then turned and ran into the cover of the trees.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re daft, Alec,\" she called over her shoulder. \" \u0027Tis the middle of the day.\"\\n\\n He grabbed her from behind and pul ed her up against him. \"There are children about,\" she pointed out.\\n\\n Alec nuzzled the side of her throat. \"You want a proper kiss, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t at all proper,\" she answered. Her breath caught in her throat then and a shiver raced across her shoulders. Alec was nibbling on her earlobe while he whispered in great detail all the erotic things he was going to do to her.\\n\\n She went limp against him. Alec leaned back against a thick tree, bracing her between his thighs. He took his time undressing her, ignoring her feeble protests and when he\u0027d completed that task, he pul ed her up against his hardness. His hands cupped her br**sts while his thumbs lazily stroked her nipples.\\n\\n He knew he had her surrender when she let out a soft moan. \"Now I\u0027m going to show you how inferior you are to me,\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"You are?\" she asked on a gasp. His hand had just moved between her thighs.\\n\\n He grunted with pleasure when he felt her heat. She was already wet and hot for him. \"I\u0027m going to kiss every inch of your inferior body,\" he promised. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-30.html","bookId":1852,"book":{"id":1852,"title":"The Bride (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #1)","description":"Storyline: By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.
