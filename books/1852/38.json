I\u0027ve been fretting like a child over this loyalty issue, Alec, and all for naught. You could have mentioned that Edgar and Henry were good friends, husband.\"\\n\\n Jamie carried Mary behind the screen before Alec could tel her he thought she was daft.\\n\\n \"Why did you let her think Edgar and Henry were good friends?\" Gavin asked.\\n\\n \"For the same reason you softened your answers about Edgar to her,\" Alec answered dryly. \"None of us want her to worry. We\u0027re all bent on making her happy, now, aren\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n Gavin grinned. \"Aye, we are.\"\\n\\n They shared a laugh, but the sound was drowned out by all the noise the women were making. Jamie, Elizabeth, Edith, and Annie were taking turns bathing Mary Kathleen.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s a beautiful child,\" Elizabeth remarked.\\n\\n \"We must tel her so,\" Jamie advised. \"Often. She mustn\u0027t ever feel she doesn\u0027t belong.\"\\n\\n The bath was finally finished. Jamie stood Mary on the chest and gave her hair a proper trim.\\n\\n The little girl didn\u0027t seem the least bit shy with the women, but it was stil obvious she preferred Jamie\u0027s attention most of all . Once she was dressed in a clean white sleeping gown Edith had provided, she reached up for Jamie to hold her.\\n\\n While Mary ate her dinner, Edith went upstairs with Annie to make her bedroom ready for her. It had been decided that Mary would sleep in the chamber next to Alec and Jamie. If the child cried out in the night, Jamie was certain she\u0027d hear her.\\n\\n \"Al mothers are light sleepers,\" she stated. \"We instinctively know when our daughters need us. You\u0027l understand what I\u0027m saying, Elizabeth, after your baby is born.\"\\n\\n Jamie\u0027s voice was so enthuasiastic, Elizabeth didn\u0027t have the heart to remind her she\u0027d only been a mother for half a day. She agreed instead.\\n\\n \"Angus grows impatient to have the threads taken out of his chest wound,\" she reminded Jamie. \"He\u0027s waiting at the table for you.\"\\n\\n \"You sit next to him,\" Jamie replied. \"He won\u0027t shout as much if you\u0027re near.\"\\n\\n \"It will pain him?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be fretting,\" Jamie soothed. \"It won\u0027t hurt him at all . He\u0027l be shouting over the inconvenience of it all , though.\"\\n\\n Elizabeth hurried over to the table to do as Jamie suggested. Alec had just started a fire in the hearth. His back was turned to Jamie, but once he\u0027d stood and noticed her, he only had enough time to accept the daughter she thrust into his arms.\\n\\n Alec didn\u0027t have any idea what was expected of him now. Stil , he wanted to please Jamie. He stared down at Mary, holding her awkwardly under her arms.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not afraid of me, are you, Mary?\" he asked in Gaelic. \"I\u0027m your papa now.\"\\n\\n She shook her head, then gave him a smile.\\n\\n Alec smiled back.\\n\\n He was ready to put her down, but when he tried, Mary let him know she wasn\u0027t ready to leave him. She grabbed hold of his tunic and stiffened against him.\\n\\n Alec perched her on his shoulders instead. The child liked that well enough. She let out a shriek of laughter and wiggled her toes with obvious delight.\\n\\n Jamie nearly dropped the supplies she\u0027d gone to fetch, when she rounded the corner of the screen and saw what Alec was doing. \"You don\u0027t hold a child like that,\" she called out. \"And for God\u0027s sake, Alec, don\u0027t shrug at me again. You\u0027l send Mary flying through the air.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m new to this, Jamie,\" Alec muttered. \"She\u0027s the first child I\u0027ve ever held.\" He pul ed Mary back into his arms while he continued to frown at his wife.\\n\\n \"You\u0027l get used to her,\" Jamie announced.\\n\\n Alec had to glare at Marcus and Gavin then so they\u0027d quit their disrespectful smiles.\\n\\n Then he carried Mary over to the rocking chair, settled her on his lap, and ordered her to go to sleep.\\n\\n Mary tried to climb up his chest instead. She was just as suspicious of the moving chair as he\u0027d been, and he had to soothe her back down into his lap.\\n\\n Jamie had turned her back on the two of them and was giving Angus her undivided attention. Alec drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair, wondering what in God\u0027s name he was supposed to do now.\\n\\n He decided he might as well try tel ing a bedtime story. It took him a minute to pick his favorite, and then he related, in full , the tale of one of his finest battles.\\n\\n In short minutes, he had Mary Kathleen enthral ed. Her eyes had widened to saucers again and she seemed to be hanging on his every word.\\n\\n Gavin and Marcus also became interested in the bloody tale. They pul ed up stools near the hearth and took turns offering grunts of approval during the telling.\\n\\n Jamie could hear Alec\u0027s soft burr in the background, but she wasn\u0027t paying any attention to what he was saying. Angus was letting her know how unhappy he was because she wouldn\u0027t let him remove the slats from his arm. \"Your fingers are moving now, Angus, but that doesn\u0027t mean the healing\u0027s done. No, you have a good month, mayhap more, wearing this contraption, and that\u0027s that. Elizabeth, his chest has healed nicely, hasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"It has,\" Elizabeth replied. \"We are both very thankful to you, Jamie. Aren\u0027t we, Angus?\"\\n\\n \"Aye, we are,\" Angus agreed.\\n\\n It looked as though it pained him to make that confession. Jamie tried not to laugh. She\u0027d already learned that Angus\u0027s gruff manner hid a soft heart.\\n\\n She smiled at Elizabeth, then hurried to put her supplies away. It was time to take Mary Kathleen upstairs. The little girl was surely exhausted from her long day.\\n\\n Yet when she turned the comer again and saw Alec holding Mary in his lap, she didn\u0027t have the heart to interrupt. Lord, she really must be exhausted, too. Why, her eyes fil ed up with tears over the wonderful sight.\\n\\n He was tel ing his daughter a bedtime story. No, she qualified with a smile. He was tel ing Mary, Marcus, Gavin, and Angus a bedtime story. God\u0027s truth, the men looked just as engrossed in the tale as the three-year-old.\\n\\n She loved Alec with all her heart. He was such a gentle, compassionate man. She felt like laughing now.\\n\\n Alec would certainly take great exception if he guessed she thought him kind, and she wondered how he was going to react when she finally confessed her love to him.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t matter if he accepted her love or not, she thought with a sudden frown. In time, she was sure he\u0027d see the rightness in it. Why, with proper prodding, he might even begin to love her, too.\\n\\n How could she have ever thought the Scots were inferior? She had to shake her head over that shameful sin, then started forward to hear this story that held everyone so captivated.\\n\\n Not everyone was captivated, she noticed when she saw Elizabeth\u0027s expression. Angus\u0027s wife looked positively horrified.\\n\\n And then she caught one of Alec\u0027s remarks. \"The mighty blow severed his arm…\"\\n\\n \"What are you tel ing that child?\" she demanded in a near shout.\\n\\n \"Just a story,\" Alec answered. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"What specific story?\" Jamie asked. She rushed forward to snatch Mary out of Alec\u0027s lap.\\n\\n \"The battle with the Northumbrians,\" he answered.\\n\\n \"In vivid detail,\" Elizabeth informed her.\\n\\n Jamie\u0027s irritation vanished in the face of her husband\u0027s obvious confusion over her reaction. \"Alec, you\u0027l give this baby nightmares with such talk.\"\\n\\n \"She liked the story,\" Alec argued. \"Give her back to me, Jamie. I\u0027ve stil to tel the ending.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, he has to finish the tale,\" Gavin interjected.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s going to bed.\" Jamie laughed then, in spite of her better intentions. \"I cannot believe you\u0027d tel a sweet child a battle story.\"\\n\\n It soon became apparent to her that Alec and his soldiers couldn\u0027t believe she\u0027d take exception to the tale.\\n\\n \"Give Mary a good night kiss,\" Jamie instructed. She handed the child back to her father and watched him place a gentle kiss on her brow.\\n\\n \"Go to your bed now, Mary,\" Alec told the child in a soft whisper. \"I\u0027l finish your story tomorrow.\"\\n\\n When he put the little girl down, she hurried over to the hearth and stretched out on the rushes. \"Does she think that\u0027s where she\u0027s supposed to sleep?\" Alec asked.\\n\\n Jamie chased after Mary and picked her up before answering. \"I suppose she does,\" she said. \"Her grandmother must have been very good to her, though. Mary has such a sweet disposition. \u0027Tis proof she hasn\u0027t been mistreated long.\"\\n\\n \"Why is that proof?\" Alec asked.\\n\\n \"When a child is treated cruel y, sometimes the mind becomes twisted, Alec, or so I\u0027ve been told. Why are you looking at me like that?\" she added in a worried tone. \"You look… stunned. We needn\u0027t worry about our Mary, Alec.\"\\n\\n Alec forced a grin. \"I never worry,\" he said. \"You do enough for the both of us.\"\\n\\n She decided to ignore that ridiculous statement. \"May we sleep upstairs tonight, Alec? I want to be near Mary. She might need me during the night.\"\\n\\n He was the one who needed her during the night. That thought popped into his mind all at once, causing a fierce frown. Hel , she was supposed to need him.\\n\\n He looked at little Mary. The child\u0027s face rested against Jamie\u0027s shoulder. Her eyes were closed, her expression bordering on blissful. It was very apparent she liked being held by Jamie.\\n\\n The bruises would fade away from the child\u0027s back and legs, and Alec knew that Jamie would soon be able to soothe away any hurt lingering inside the child\u0027s mind. Aye, his wife would make Mary Kathleen content… as content as her magical love had made him.\\n\\n She did love him. The way she looked at him told him so. She might not have reckoned with the truth yet, but Alec was certain that, in time, and with enough prodding, she\u0027d settle in to accepting her fate. He had.\\n\\n God must have had a hand in sending Jamie to him, he decided, because if anyone had told him a year ago that he\u0027d love an opinionated, bad-tempered, contrary English woman, he would have laughed first and then flattened the man for suggesting such a notion.\\n\\n He guessed he\u0027d have to tel her he loved her. Alec quit his scowl. He\u0027d tel her tonight, he decided. In Gaelic. Just to be contrary.\\n\\n \"Alec? will you be needing to speak to me again tonight?\" Angus asked, interrupting his laird\u0027s thoughts.\\n\\n \"No, Angus. Take Elizabeth home. We\u0027l discuss our plans again tomorrow.\"\\n\\n Gavin waited until Angus had taken Elizabeth outside before questioning Alec. Though he was sure Elizabeth wouldn\u0027t repeat anything she overheard, he didn\u0027t want to upset her. \"What plan are you thinking of, Alec? Do you know who tried to kil Jamie?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not including us in your discussion?\" Marcus asked.\\n\\n \"Quit your frown, Marcus,\" Alec ordered. \"I haven\u0027t had time to include the two of you yet. You did check the bedrooms, didn\u0027t you, Gavin?\"\\n\\n The soldier nodded. \"And I\u0027ve been watching the doors ever since. Edith is waiting in Mary\u0027s room. She wants permission from Jamie to sleep with Mary tonight in case the child awakens.\"\\n\\n \"The soldiers are stil stationed below your window, milord,\" Marcus added.\\n\\n \"Put two more at the bottom of the steps, Marcus. No one goes up those stairs.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know who it is?\" Gavin asked again.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m almost certain,\" Alec returned. His expression turned grim. \"Tomorrow we set the trap. I\u0027ve been looking in the wrong direction. And if I\u0027m right, once this is over, Father Murdock will have to bless Helena\u0027s grave.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" Marcus whispered.\\n\\n \"If I\u0027m right,\" Alec repeated, \"Helena didn\u0027t kil herself. She was murdered.\"\\n\\n He guards her like a precious treasure. The fool! Does he actually think he can stop me?\\n\\n I\u0027m too cunning for the Kincaid. The time has come to challenge him once again. I\u0027ll kill the bitch tomorrow.\\n\\n The child will have to wait.… It can only be one pleasure at a time .\\n\\n God give me the strength to hide my joy.\\n\\n Chapter Sixteen\\n\\n Jamie was sound asleep when Alec finally came to bed. She looked beautiful to him, peaceful, too. He really shouldn\u0027t wake her up, he thought, even as he moved the blanket away and pul ed her into his arms.\\n\\n She grumbled in her sleep, then threw one slender leg over his thigh. The woman was giving him hel even in her sleep, for when he trailed his fingers down her back, she mumbled something he didn\u0027t understand but guessed was shameful, then slapped his hand away when she rol ed over on her back.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t at all deterred. Her nightgown was bunched up around her thighs, and in the soft candlelight, her skin was dappled gold. Her legs were tangled in the covers. Alec kicked the covers out of the way before trapping her with one thigh. He made short work of removing her gown, smiling over the muttering that action caused. She could even look disgruntled when she was sleeping.\\n\\n He moved her hair out of his way, trailing the silky rose-scented strands through his fingers as he nuzzled the side of her neck.\\n\\n She sighed with pleasure. Alec raised his head to look at her. He smiled when he saw that she didn\u0027t look at all irritated now. He kissed her softly parted lips, the center of her chin, her neck again, then moved lower to kiss the gooseflesh on her chest.\\n\\n Her shivers woke her up. She wasn\u0027t at all cold, though. No, she was getting warmer with each moment… with each kiss. Alec was caressing her br**sts with his hands, his mouth, his tongue.\\n\\n He was such a gentle lover with her, she thought in wonder. He could make her melt in his arms. His hand moved down to circle her navel, then lower stil , until his fingers were stroking the soft curls between her thighs.\\n\\n Her body was ready for him. She was hot, wet, and as her sweet moans told him, almost as wild with need as he was. He teased her stomach with his tongue. She clung to him and finally pul ed on his hair when she\u0027d had enough of that torment.\\n\\n \"You make me ache to have you, Jamie,\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"Have me now, Alec,\" she whispered. \"Don\u0027t make me wait any longer. I want…\"\\n\\n Her moan of pleasure when his fingers stretched inside her ended her plea. She arched against him even as she tried to pul his hand away. \"Stop this torment, husband. Come to me now.\"\\n\\n Her hands moved down to capture him. \"Two can play this game,\" she whispered, her voice a husky promise.\\n\\n Alec groaned deep in his throat, then pul ed her hand away. \"Not tonight, she can\u0027t,\" he whispered. \"I can\u0027t hold back much longer, Jamie.\"\\n\\n He moved between her legs, cupped her thighs, and thrust inside her with one powerful surge. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-38.html","bookId":1852,"book":{"id":1852,"title":"The Bride (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #1)","description":"Storyline: By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.
