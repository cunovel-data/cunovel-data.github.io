{"id":79045,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"That feud had existed for so many years no one could recol ect the beginning. The Kincaids, on the other hand, were all ies with the McCoys, ever since a McCoy warrior fished a drowning Kincaid lass out of the river, and the Kincaids were therefore forced, for honor\u0027s sake, to stand beside the McCoys against the McPhersons.\n Yet when word reached Lady Cecily McPherson of Lady Kincaid\u0027s healing skil s, she ignored all the laws of the Highlands.\n Cecily McPherson would have bargained with the devil to save her child. Without tel ing anyone her plan, she took the infant to the Ferguson holding and begged Lady Ferguson\u0027s assistance. Mary was most sympathetic to the poor woman\u0027s plight. Since Daniel was stil away on the hunt for Angus\u0027s attackers, she didn\u0027t have to bother gaining his permission. She immediately took the little one to Jamie.\n Al the Kincaid soldiers knew whom the child belonged to, of course, as everyone in the mountains knew everyone else\u0027s business. None mentioned to their mistress the fact that she was taking care of their enemy\u0027s son, though. They guessed it wouldn\u0027t matter to her. Lady Kincaid was English, after all , and therefore ignorant of the feuds existing in their land. She was a woman, too, and the mothering instinct would probably mean more to her than war. Just as important, she was too gentle to understand a feud, and from the way she\u0027d demanded to take over Angus\u0027s care in the face of Alec\u0027s resistance, she\u0027d proven to be a mite too stubborn to understand.\n Gavin knew what would happen if the bairn died on Kincaid land, however. After giving the pitiful infant one quick glance, he was convinced war was inevitable. He commanded his troops to prepare for battle, sent two messengers to track Alec down, and then patiently waited for the McPhersons to attack.\n The babe was fat and sassy four days later when the entire McPherson army came to demand the body for burial.\n Gavin only all owed entrance to the laird and two others. With Marcus at his side, he waited on the steps of the castle.\n Jamie had just put the baby to sleep on Alec\u0027s bed when she heard the shouts coming from the courtyard.\n She rushed outside to see what all the commotion was about, but came to a quick stop on the top step when she saw the three fierce-looking soldiers on horseback. She immediately knew they weren\u0027t Kincaid soldiers, as their dark plaid wasn\u0027t at all the same.\n \"I\u0027l not leave without my dead,\" the burly man in the middle bel owed. \"And when I come back, there\u0027l be blood spattering your wails. Kincaid blood.\"\n \"Has someone died, Gavin?\" Jamie asked.\n The second-in-command answered her without turning around. Jamie thought he didn\u0027t want to take his gaze off the strangers. She certainly couldn\u0027t fault Gavin, for the strangers did look the type to strike a man down when his back was turned. \"Laird McPherson has come to reclaim his son.\"\n The anger in Gavin\u0027s voice startled Jamie. She caught the tension in the air, then realized the three strangers were all glaring at her. She straightened her shoulders in reaction to their rudeness.\n \"Is she the Kincaid\u0027s woman?\" the man in the middle bel owed.\n \"She is,\" Gavin answered.\n \"Then she\u0027s the one who stole my son away.\"\n Did the laird have to shout every word? Jamie couldn\u0027t believe this was the father of such a sweet-tempered babe. The chieftain was an old man, with bushy brows that hid most of his dark eyes.\n She guessed he smel ed as rank as he looked, too.\n Marcus turned around to look at Jamie. His face didn\u0027t show a hint of what he was thinking. \"Go and get the bairn,\" he ordered.\n \"Be quick about it, woman.\"\n Jamie had just started back into the castle when the laird shouted that order. She stopped, then slowly turned around to face him again.\n \"I\u0027l take my time,\" she said.\n \"I want my dead.\"\n Her hearing was never going to be the same. The bel igerent man was roaring like a wounded bear. Jamie tried to contain her temper. She told herself the man thought his son was dead, after all , and grief was robbing him of his manners.\n Not a word was exchanged until Jamie came back outside. She carried the sleeping infant in her arms.\n The laird\u0027s son was completely covered by a thick woolen blanket to protect him from the biting wind.\n The old laird\u0027s face showed no outward reaction. Jamie walked over to his side and pul ed the cover away from the baby\u0027s face.\n \"Give him to me.\"\n \"You will quit your shouting this minute,\" she ordered in a low voice. \"If you wake this child after all the trouble I had hil ing him to sleep, there\u0027l be hel to pay and you\u0027l be the one paying it. Do I make myself clear?\"\n \"Wake him up?\"\n \"I just told you not to shout,\" Jamie reminded him in a near shout of her own. She immediately regretted her outburst, for the infant opened his eyes and began to fidget in her arms. She paused to smile down at the child, then glared up at his father.\n She missed the look of astonishment that crossed the laird\u0027s face when his little one moved.\n \"Now see what you\u0027ve done? Your shouts have upset the baby,\" Jamie muttered. She moved the infant up against her shoulder and began to pat his back. The baby immediately let out a loud belch. \"That\u0027s a good boy,\" she crooned after placing a quick kiss on the top of his bald head.\n Her expression hardened when she turned back to the laird. \"Why God blessed you with such a dear child I\u0027l never understand. This little one has just had his noon feeding and if you get him riled, he\u0027s bound to throw up.\"\n The chieftain didn\u0027t respond to her comments. Jamie reluctantly handed the infant to his father. She noticed the man\u0027s hands shook when he took hold of his baby. \"I have instructions to give you before you leave,\" she told him.\n The old warrior didn\u0027t say a word for a long while. He squinted down at his son while he tried to regain his control. He couldn\u0027t show any joy now, for to do so would certainly soften his position in front of the Kincaids, yet it was a nearly impossible feat that made his eyes bulge. The bairn let out another lusty belch in the sudden stil ness, then smiled sweetly over his feat, as if he knew of his father\u0027s struggles and was deliberately testing his endurance.\n \"He ain\u0027t dead.\"\n \"You\u0027l scream him to death if you keep up your shouts,\" Jamie announced. \"Now pray give me your attention, sir. You will tel your wife to feed your son only goat\u0027s milk.\"\n \"I will not.\"\n Jamie reacted as though she\u0027d just been hit by lightning. Before the laird could react, she snatched the baby out of his arms, settled him back against her bosom, and began to pace alongside the laird\u0027s horse.\n \"Then you can just go home without your son, McPherson. I won\u0027t let you kil him with your ignorance.\n Come back when he\u0027s old enough to fend for himself.\"\n The laird\u0027s beady eyes widened in astonishment. He glanced over to Gavin, then back to Lady Kincaid.\n \"Give him to me.\"\n \"You\u0027l give me your promise to feed him only goat\u0027s milk first.\"\n \"He\u0027ll be getting his mama\u0027s milk, woman.\"\n \"He doesn\u0027t like his mama\u0027s milk.\"\n \"Have you just insulted my wife?\"\n Jamie wished she had the strength to beat some sense into the old man. \"I\u0027m tel ing you what you have to do to keep this baby alive,\" she shouted.\n \"He cannot stand another bout of sickness.\" She moved closer to the laird, until she was just an inch or so away from his knee, then said, \"Promise me.\"\n His abrupt nod pleased her. She handed the baby back to his father, then started toward Gavin and Marcus. \"You\u0027re the most ungrateful man I\u0027ve ever met,\" she muttered.\n \"Ungrateful?\"\n He was back to bel owing. Jamie whirled around, her hands on her hips, and gave the warrior a look meant to burn. \"Aye, ungrateful,\" she shouted back. \"You should be expressing your appreciation, McPherson, not shouting at me.\"\n The laird\u0027s eyes turned to slits again. Jamie knew his pride was somehow injured, but she didn\u0027t have the faintest idea why. \"I\u0027l have your apology for taking my son out of my home,\" the man bel owed. \"It\u0027s war we\u0027re speaking of if I don\u0027t get what I want.\"\n \"What you need is a good kick in your backside, you old goat,\" Jamie shouted back. \"And that\u0027s what you\u0027re going to get if you don\u0027t show some respect around me.\"\n \"You took my bairn.\"\n She couldn\u0027t believe the man\u0027s stupidity. His horse was just as obnoxious as his master was, too. As soon as the old man let up on the reins, the animal tried to take a bite out of Jamie\u0027s shoulder. McPherson didn\u0027t seem to want to control his mount any more than he did his temper.\n \"You\u0027l apologize,\" he roared.\n Jamie slapped his horse away before answering that chal enge. \"How dare you ask for my apology? I didn\u0027t take your son away and you know it.\n You can sit there until you rot, but you aren\u0027t getting an apology from me.\"\n The baby started to wail, disrupting Jamie\u0027s concentration. \"Oh, take your son home to his mama,\" she ordered. \"And don\u0027t you dare come back on Kincaid land until you\u0027ve learned some manners.\"\n The chieftain looked as if he was itching to strike her. He deliberately let up on his reins, just to be contrary. The horse immediately tried to get a taste of Jamie\u0027s shoulder again. She hit the horse, harder.\n McPherson let out a roar in reaction. \"She hit me horse,\" he shouted. \"You seen it, men. The Kincaid woman hit me horse. \u0027Tis one thing to insult a man\u0027s wife, but to strike his horseâ€”\"\n \"Oh, for God\u0027s sake,\" Jamie interrupted. \"Leave now or I\u0027l hit you .\"\n When the soldier on the left of the laird reached for his sword, Jamie pul ed her dagger from the sheath in her belt. She turned to the soldier, took aim, and said, \"You\u0027l take your hand away from your weapon or you\u0027l find my dagger in your throat before you draw your next breath. And when I cause an injury,\" she chal enged, \"I don\u0027t repair it.\"\n The soldier hesitated for the briefest of seconds, then did as she commanded. Jamie nodded. \"Now get off my land,\" she ordered as she replaced her dagger.\n She was suddenly exhausted. She hadn\u0027t lost her temper this thoroughly in a good long while. She was a little ashamed of her behavior, too, and was immensely thankful only Gavin and Marcus were there to witness her unleashed temper.\n It was all McPherson\u0027s fault, of course. The man probably lived in a cave. He certainly had the manners of a wild animal. He could provoke a saint into screaming.\n Retreat seemed the logical choice now. Jamie turned around, her intent to walk back inside the castle without sparing a single glance over her shoulder. She was going to dismiss the McPhersons as rudely as possible.\n She came to a staggering halt when she saw the line of Kincaid soldiers behind her. all were armed and ready for battle. While Jamie noticed this fact quickly enough, that wasn\u0027t what really started her head to pounding. No, it was Alec Kincaid standing in the center of his soldiers who captured her full attention and gave her such a headache.\n Well , hel , he\u0027d probably seen the whole thing.\n Jamie was mortified. She suddenly wished she could just turn around and walk back to England.\n She really wasn\u0027t certain who was the bigger threat now. The look on Alec\u0027s face could scare the wool off sheep. Laird McPherson looked like a saint in comparison.\n Alec\u0027s arms were folded across his chest. His legs were braced apartâ€”a bad sign, thatâ€”and his expression was as rigid as the rest of him. It was the same position she\u0027d seen the day the outcasts attacked. She\u0027d thought he looked bored then.\n She knew better now.\n He was stil the safer bet, she decided. If he was going to kil her, he\u0027d probably do it in privacy, she supposed with a sinking flutter in her stomach.\n She wasn\u0027t important enough in his mind to make a scene over. Nay, he probably wouldn\u0027t get around to it until next week.\n He didn\u0027t say a word to her when she walked over to his side. He simply pushed her behind his back and then took a step forward. The wall of men immediately surrounded her.\n The shield of warriors blocked her view, even when she stood on tiptoe and tried to see over Marcus\u0027s shoulder.\n Angry words flew like arrows between the two mighty chieftains. Jamie was stunned when she realized Alec was actually defending her. He\u0027d taken deep offense over the fact that one of the McPhersons had dared to touch his sword in Lady Kincaid\u0027s presence. Oh, Alec was furious, all right.\n Bloody furious.\n He had a blazing temper, and Jamie was racing through a prayer of thanksgiving to her Maker that it wasn\u0027t directed at her.\n Then she heard the hateful word \"war\" bel owed again. McPherson called for a battle and Alec couldn\u0027t have been more emphatic in his agreement.\n Good God, what had she done?\n Alec was never going to believe this wasn\u0027t all her fault. If she\u0027d held on to her temper, perhaps she could have averted this war.\n The soldiers didn\u0027t move away from her until the McPhersons were well on their way down the path.\n Jamie decided it would be best for her to leave before her husband turned his attention to her. She certainly wasn\u0027t running away, she told herself.\n No, she just needed a little time to sort this confusing matter out. With any luck, it might only take her a day or two.\n She turned her back on Marcus and started up the stairs. Just when she thought she\u0027d escaped Alec\u0027s notice, he grabbed hold of her arm. He wasn\u0027t at all gentle when he forced her around to face him. Since Marcus and Gavin were watching, she decided to smile. Alec\u0027s scowl, however, changed her inclination.\n \"Would you care to explain?\" he asked. His voice was as mild as a lion\u0027s yawn.\n \"Nay,\" Jamie answered. \"I would rather not.\"\n He didn\u0027t like her answer. The muscle in his jaw was at it again, flexing like an insistent tic. The grip on her arm intensified until the freckles turned pink.\n She was determined to meet his glare so he would know she wasn\u0027t afraid of the mean look in his eyes, but she didn\u0027t even last through the first real blink.\n \"The babe was sick,\" she told him.\n \"And?\"\n \"I took care of him.\"\n \"How did a McPherson bairn get here?\"\n \"I was wondering that very thing,\" she said.\n \"Answer me.\"\n He hadn\u0027t raised his voice, yet Jamie knew he was furious. She decided to appease him without actually giving him a direct answer. \"Alec, I was simply trying to do the right thing. Even if I\u0027d known that dear child belonged to such a sour old man, I stil would have taken care of him. The babe was suffering so. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-28.html","bookId":1852,"book":{"id":1852,"title":"The Bride (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #1)","description":"Storyline: \n By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.
