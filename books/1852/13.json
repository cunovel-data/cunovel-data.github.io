{"id":79030,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"Are you back to being afraid of me, English?\"\n \"I was never afraid, Scot,\" she answered. \"Only worried.\"\n \"Are you stil worried?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Then why are you trying to ease my arm away?\"\n \"It isn\u0027t decent to touch like this in front of others, Alec.\"\n \"It isn\u0027t?\"\n She ignored the amusement in his voice. \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" she repeated. \"And my name is Jamie. You\u0027ve stil to say it, Alec.\"\n \"It\u0027s a man\u0027s name.\"\n \"Are we back to that?\"\n \"Aye, we are.\"\n She refused to look at him until he finished laughing, then said, \"My name certainly seems to give you vast amusement. I suppose that\u0027s all for the better, Alec, because you\u0027re in a fine mood, you see, and I wanted to tel you something you might take exception to, but once you hear me out, why, I\u0027m certain you\u0027l agree with my decision.\"\n The seriousness in her tone puzzled him. \"What is it you wish to ask me?\"\n \"I would ask that you not… touch me. I don\u0027t know you well enough to all ow such liberties.\"\n \"Al ow?\"\n A shiver of dread passed down her spine. It was apparent from his tone of voice that he didn\u0027t care for her choice of words. \"Alec? Do you want a wife who is unwil ing?\"\n \"Are you asking me or your hands?\" Alec countered.\n \"You.\"\n \"Then look at me.\"\n The command was given in a hard voice. She needed all her determination to do as he ordered. It would have been easier if he hadn\u0027t been sitting so close to her. He wouldn\u0027t let her scoot away from him, either, no matter how many times she tried.\n She finally managed to look into his eyes for a full minute, then lowered her gaze to stare at his mouth.\n That error in judgment made her sigh. It didn\u0027t seem to matter where she looked. The man was hard all over. A day\u0027s growth of whiskers made him all the more fierce-looking.\n Jamie had the feeling he was trying to read her thoughts when she glanced into his eyes again. It was an absurd feeling, but it was there all the same.\n She was suddenly hot and cold and thoroughly confused.\n \"Now ask me your question again,\" he said.\n \"Do you want an unwil ing wife?\" she repeated, her voice a low whisper.\n \"I don\u0027t particularly want a wife at all .\"\n She took immediate exception to that honesty. \"Wel , you\u0027ve got one.\"\n \"Aye, I have, and English at that.\"\n If her back became any straighter, Alec thought her spine might crack.\n His new wife was blessed with a giant-sized temper. She looked ready to let go of that precious control of hers, too. She was clasping her hands together now in a grip that had to be painful.\n \"I wonder why you say the word \u0027English\u0027 as though it were a blasphemy.\"\n \"It is.\"\n \"It isn\u0027t.\"\n Her blush deepened when she realized she\u0027d just shouted at him. She glanced up to measure Alec\u0027s reaction. He was frowning, but she didn\u0027t think he realized how very angry he was making her. She was well disciplined in hiding her emotions.\n \"You could never care for an English wife, then?\"\n \"Care for?\"\n \"You know my meaning.\"\n \"Explain it.\"\n The man was as dense as fog. \"Love,\" Jamie snapped. Noticing that Mary and Daniel were both staring at her, she paused to give them a smile, then turned to glare at Alec. \"You could never love an English wife?\" she whispered.\n \"I doubt it.\"\n \"You doubt it?\"\n \"You needn\u0027t shout,\" Alec remarked. He was thoroughly enjoying her outrage. \"Does my honesty upset you?\"\n She had to take a deep breath before answering him. \"No, your honesty doesn\u0027t upset me, but I do find your amusement most insulting, milord.\n We\u0027re discussing a serious topic.\"\n \"Serious by your measure, not mine.\"\n \"You don\u0027t consider marriage an important undertaking?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"No?\"\n She looked appal ed and furious. Alec thought it was an enchanting combination. \"You\u0027re only an insignificant part of my life, wife. When you understand the way of life in the Highlands, you\u0027l see how foolish your fears are.\"\n \"I\u0027m insignificant and foolish? Alec, you must find me most inferior,\" she countered. \"Yet you\u0027re ready for sainthood, aren\u0027t you? Why, you never lose your temper or get angry. Isn\u0027t that what you told me?\"\n \"True,\" Alec admitted, grinning. \"I did say that.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t particularly want to marry you either, Kincaid.\"\n \"I noticed.\"\n \"You did?\"\n She actually seemed surprised. Alec let her see his exasperation. \"You wore a black gown to your wedding,\" he reminded her.\n \"I happen to like this gown,\" she returned, pausing to brush a bit of dust off the hem. \"I might wear it every other day.\"\n \"Ah, so you could never come to care for me?\" he asked.\n \"\u0027Tis most doubtful.\"\n Alec did laugh then, a low, rumbling sound that made Jamie think the earth was trembling.\n \"Why does my honesty make you laugh?\"\n \"\u0027Twas the way you gave it.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to continue this discussion, Alec. If you\u0027ve finished your meal, I\u0027l put the food away.\"\n \"Let your sister see to that duty.\"\n \"It\u0027s my responsibility,\" she explained.\n \"Just as it was your responsibility to protect her?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Mary believes this nonsense, too, doesn\u0027t she?\"\n \"Nonsense? Since when is doing one\u0027s duty nonsense?\"\n \"Daniel and I heard your sister order you to guard her when the English bastards attacked. We saw her use you as her shield.\"\n \"They weren\u0027t English bastards,\" Jamie corrected, concentrating on that remark. He was determined not to understand about Mary and she wasn\u0027t in the mood to argue. \"I\u0027m certain the infidels came from…\"\n She was about to tel him she was sure the scoundrels had crossed over the border from Scotland, then thought better of it. \"They belong to no country. That is why they\u0027re called outcasts, don\u0027t you suppose?\"\n \"I suppose,\" Alec all owed, letting her have her way. She was frowning enough to make him think that issue was of grave importance to her. \"I thought you were the youngest daughter,\" he stated. \"I heard your father cal you his baby.\" He smiled after making that comment, then added, \"I was mistaken?\"\n \"No, you weren\u0027t mistaken,\" Jamie replied. \"I am the youngest. And Papa does like to cal me his baby.\"\n She blushed after making that confession.\n \"Yet Mary forced you to be her shield.\"\n \"Oh, no, she didn\u0027t force me,\" Jamie argued.\n \"Aye, she did.\"\n Her voice had gone suspiciously soft. Jamie didn\u0027t retreat from his frown this time. \"You can\u0027t possibly understand, Alec. You\u0027re a Scot, if you\u0027l remember, and can\u0027t possibly know how the English do things.\n You\u0027l just have to take my word on this issue. It has always been my duty to protect my older sisters. It\u0027s probably the same in every household in England.\"\n \"Your opinions displease me.\"\n She didn\u0027t particularly care if her opinions pleased him. She shrugged to show her indifference.\n \"You\u0027re the baby,\" he continued. \"For that reason, your older sister should have looked after you.\"\n She shook her head. The man seemed determined to make her change her mind. \"No, it\u0027s the other way around, milord.\"\n Now Alec shook his head. \"The strong must always protect the weak, wife; the older must always protect the younger. And that\u0027s the way it is everywhere, even in the hall owed country of England.\"\n While he watched in fascination, Jamie\u0027s eyes turned a deep violet. She wasn\u0027t at all happy with his views.\n That truth was emphasized when she jabbed at his shoulder. \"I am not weak.\"\n Alec resisted the urge to take her into his arms and kiss the outrage out of her. Lord, she was really too beautiful for his peace of mind.\n \"No, you\u0027re not weak,\" he admitted.\n The bluster went out of her then. \"It was good of you to notice,\" she said.\n \"Yet you were afraid of me.\"\n \"Do you have to keep bringing that up? It\u0027s most unkind of you to remind me of that incident, Alec.\"\n \"Perhaps I have an unkind nature.\"\n \"You don\u0027t.\"\n He was surprised by her quick, vehement denial. \"You sound very sure of that.\"\n \"I am,\" Jamie admitted. \"You were kind to my father when he carried on so,\" she reminded him. \"You were patient and understanding. Most men wouldn\u0027t have shown such compassion.\"\n She thought she\u0027d just praised him, yet his shout of laughter told her he was more amused than appreciative.\n \"It\u0027s bad manners to laugh when given a compliment, Alec. Damn rude, too.\"\n \"Compliment? Wife, you just insulted me when you called me compassionate. Never has that word been put to me.\"\n \"I disagree,\" she countered. \"Just because you haven\u0027t been called compassionate before doesn\u0027t mean—\"\n \"A wife should never disagree with her husband.\"\n He looked sincere. It was high time, she decided, to set him straight. \"A wife must give her husband her opinion,\" she stated, \"whenever it seems needed. It\u0027s the only way a good marriage survives, Alec. You must take my word on this matter,\" she added before turning away from the incredulous look on his face.\n \"Stop trying to push my hands away. You belong to me now. I won\u0027t all ow you to pul away when I touch you.\"\n \"I\u0027ve already explained that I\u0027m not ready to belong to you just yet.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re ready or not.\"\n He sounded downright cheerful when he stated that truth. \"Alec, I\u0027m not going to sleep with you as wife until I\u0027ve gotten to know you better. Surely you can understand my reticence.\"\n \"Oh, I understand,\" he said.\n Jamie dared a quick look up, saw the laughter lurking in his dark eyes, and suddenly realized how much he was enjoying her embarrassment. She knew she was acting foolish. Her hands were clenched tight and she\u0027d started trembling again.\n \"You\u0027re frightened. Beak explained that you…\"\n \"I\u0027m not frightened. I\u0027m… worried.\"\n He stated the obvious then. \"You\u0027re blushing like a virgin.\"\n She gave him a disgruntled look before answering. \"I can\u0027t help that. I am a virgin.\"\n Alec laughed in spite of himself. She sounded ashamed, as if she\u0027d just confessed a dark sin.\n \"Will you please stop laughing at me? It\u0027s insulting.\"\n \"Your virginity belongs to me, Jamie. A bride shouldn\u0027t be embarrassed by her purity.\"\n He\u0027d finally used her name. Jamie was so pleased that she smiled.\n \"Alec? Would you have chosen me if I hadn\u0027t been… pure?\"\n \"I would,\" he answered immediately.\n \"Real y?\"\n \"Aye, and don\u0027t make me repeat myself, Jamie.\"\n He sounded irritated now. \"You\u0027re a most unusual man, Alec. Most knights wouldn\u0027t have a woman who\u0027d given herself to another man.\"\n \"Oh, I\u0027d have you all right,\" Alec returned. \"But I\u0027d also gain the name of the man who dishonored you before marriage.\"\n \"And then?\"\n \"I\u0027d kil him.\"\n Jamie believed he meant what he said. She shivered in reaction. Kil ing certainly didn\u0027t bother him much.\n \"The question isn\u0027t relevant since you\u0027re a virgin, is it?\"\n \"No, I suppose not,\" she admitted. \"Wel , Alec? Are you will ing to wait until I know you better? Before you… that is, before we…\"\n The poor lass couldn\u0027t even get the words out. Alec suddenly wanted to ease her fear, though he didn\u0027t have the damnedest idea why. He would take her, of course, but he didn\u0027t want her cringing away from him or waiting in dread. He decided to use a little diplomacy. \"Until you wear my plaid, Jamie. We\u0027l wait until then.\"\n She looked as though she\u0027d just been given a reprieve from purgatory. Her reaction did chafe his good mood.\n \"Will you give me your word, Alec?\"\n \"I\u0027ve just given it,\" he stated. He suddenly hauled her up against his side, tilted her chin back until she was forced to look into his eyes. \"Never ask me to repeat my word to you in future, wife.\"\n She would have nodded agreement if he had let go of her chin. Alec slowly leaned down and kissed her.\n She was too stunned to resist. His mouth was hard, yet wonderful y warm, too. Once again, just as she was beginning to respond, Alec pul ed away.\n \"I thank you for your understanding,\" Jamie murmured.\n \"Your feelings are of little significance to me. You\u0027re simply my wife, my chattel. Remember that and we\u0027l get along well together.\"\n \"Your chattel?\" Jamie all but strangled on her words. God\u0027s truth, she\u0027d never felt this humiliated, this inferior, in all her days.\n Alec reached up and gently tapped her between her shoulderblades. \"Chew your food, lass, before you try to swal ow it,\" he advised.\n He knew damn good and well she hadn\u0027t eaten anything. \"You\u0027re doing it on purpose, aren\u0027t you, Alec?\"\n \"Doing what?\"\n \"You needn\u0027t look so innocent, husband. You\u0027re trying to make me angry.\"\n Alec nodded. That slow grin was back in evidence.\n \"Why?\"\n \"To show you it\u0027s acceptable.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"No matter what you do or what you say, I will never lose my patience with you. It\u0027s my duty to keep you safe, Jamie. It\u0027s really very simple, this lesson I\u0027ve just given you, and when you think about it, you\u0027l see how I just all owed you to speak your thoughts without reacting the least unpleasantly.\"\n \"Are you tel ing me this entire conversation was just a lesson for your ignorant English bride?\"\n When Alec nodded, Jamie started laughing.\n \"And so, Alec, if I tel you I think you\u0027re the most insulting warrior I\u0027ve ever had the misfortune to meet, you wouldn\u0027t be at all bothered?\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t.\"\n \"You\u0027ve just given me your promise not to touch me until I wear your plaid, milord, and now I\u0027l give you a promise. You\u0027l rue the day you ever boasted of never losing your patience with me, husband. I give you my word.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-13.html","bookId":1852,"book":{"id":1852,"title":"The Bride (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #1)","description":"Storyline: \n By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.
