{"id":79039,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"She peeked around her husband to get a better look at the man they were mourning.\\n\\n At first she thought he was dead. Jamie was used to seeing injuries of every sort, and for that reason she barely blanched over the horrible sight before her. There was blood everywhere, or so it appeared to her at first notice. Jamie couldn\u0027t tel how much was bluster, though, and how much was real damage. A large curved gash took up a fair portion of the warrior\u0027s chest. His lower left arm was broken, too, near the wrist, but it looked like a clean break to her.\\n\\n He was a battle-scarred man with rugged features and dark brown hair. A large welt had made his brow swel up, giving him a grotesque appearance. Jamie stared at the bump a long while, wondering if that was the blow that had caused his death.\\n\\n The dead man suddenly grimaced. It was an ever-so-slight movement she would have missed if she hadn\u0027t been watching him so intently.\\n\\n A spark of hope was ignited in her mind. She concentrated on the way the warrior was breathing. It was a mite shal ow, she decided, yet true as a rooster\u0027s. A good sign, that, for there was usual y a rattle shivering through the air when death came stalking his prey.\\n\\n The truth stil took her by surprise. Angus wasn\u0027t dying …yet.\\n\\n The priest was taking forever to finish his prayers. Jamie didn\u0027t want to wait. The man they were mourning would surely catch a fever and die before morning unless she could take care of his injuries.\\n\\n Jamie reached up to tap Alec\u0027s shoulder. He immediately turned around, then moved to block her view of the wounded soldier. He didn\u0027t look overly happy to see her.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Angus?\" she whispered.\\n\\n Alec nodded. \"Go back to bed, Jamie.\"\\n\\n \"He isn\u0027t dead.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s dying.\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t think he is, Alec.\"\\n\\n \"Go to bed.\"\\n\\n \"But Alec—\"\\n\\n \"Now.\"\\n\\n The harshness in his command worried her. Jamie turned around and slowly walked back to her bed.\\n\\n She was already listing the items she would need to help Angus.\\n\\n When she returned to her husband, her arms were fil ed with her precious medicine jars. She had tucked a long needle and sturdy thread into one pocket of her robe. Three white stockings dangled from her other pocket. Jamie was determined to do what she could to save the warrior, with or without her husband\u0027s cooperation. She only hoped Alec wouldn\u0027t make too much of a fuss before he gave in.\\n\\n He was going to have to give in, though, and that was that.\\n\\n The priest gave the final blessing and knelt down. Alec motioned to his men, turned, and very nearly knocked Jamie to the floor. He instinctively reached out to steady her.\\n\\n He was bloody furious with her. The look on his face said as much. So did his hard grip on her shoulders. Jamie took a deep breath, then blurted out, \"In England we have a rather quaint custom, Alec.\\n\\n We don\u0027t mourn a man until he\u0027s dead, and we don\u0027t cal for our priest until we\u0027re sure he\u0027s dying.\" She\u0027d certainly gained his full attention with that statement. \"Alec, you cannot know for certain that Angus is dying. Let me see to his injuries. If God is determined to have him now, nothing I do will make any difference.\" She shrugged his hands away while she waited for his answer. It was a long time in coming.\\n\\n Alec was looking at her as though she\u0027d just lost her mind. Jamie tried to move to his side, but he blocked her view once again. \"There\u0027s blood.\"\\n\\n \"I saw it.\"\\n\\n \"Blood makes you sick.\"\\n\\n \"Alec, where do you get your ideas?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer that chal enge. \"It will not make me sick.\"\\n\\n \"If you get ill , I\u0027l be very displeased with you.\"\\n\\n And if his voice turned any harsher, it would probably cause lightning to strike, Jamie thought. \"I\u0027m going to take care of him, husband, with or without your permission. Now get out of my way.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t budge, but his eyes had widened over her sharp command. Jamie thought he might be considering strangling her. She decided then that ordering him about wasn\u0027t the right approach. \"Alec, did I tel you how to fight those bandits who attacked us on our way here?\"\\n\\n He thought that question was too ridiculous to answer. Jamie answered for him. \"No, of course I didn\u0027t. I don\u0027t know anything about fighting, husband, but I do know a bloody lot about healing. I\u0027m going to help Angus and that\u0027s that. Now please move out of my way. Your friend is in terrible pain.\"\\n\\n It was her last remark that gained his cooperation. \"How can you know he\u0027s in pain?\"\\n\\n \"I saw him grimace.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re certain?\"\\n\\n \"Very certain.\"\\n\\n The fierceness in her tone amazed him. Before his eyes she was turning into a tigress. \"Do what you can.\"\\n\\n Jamie let out a weary sigh as she hurried to the table. She placed her jars near one corner, then bent over Angus to study his injuries. The warriors all returned to the table. They looked outraged. Alec thought he might have a rebel ion on his hands. He folded his arms across his chest and slowly scanned his audience, for one and all had turned to look at him now. They were obviously waiting to see what he was going to do about his wife\u0027s disrespectful interference.\\n\\n Jamie didn\u0027t pay any attention to the soldiers. She gently prodded the edges of the welt on Angus\u0027s forehead. She studied his chest wound next.\\n\\n \"\u0027Tis just as I suspected,\" she said.\\n\\n \"The damage?\" Alec asked.\\n\\n Jamie shook her head. There was a smile in her voice when she said, \"It\u0027s mostly bluster.\"\\n\\n \"Bluster?\"\\n\\n \"Meaning it looks worse than it really is,\" Jamie explained.\\n\\n \"He isn\u0027t dying?\"\\n\\n The priest asked that question. The old man struggled to his feet, wheezing from the effort. He stared at Jamie with a frown as fierce as any she\u0027d ever seen.\\n\\n \"He has a good chance, Father,\" Jamie said. She heard a woman cry out and guessed it was Elizabeth.\\n\\n \"I would like to help you,\" the priest announced.\\n\\n \"I would appreciate your help,\" she replied. She heard the soldiers grumbling under their breath behind her. She ignored them and turned back to her husband. \"You were leaving with your men, I noticed, but if it wasn\u0027t an important errand, I could use your assistance.\"\\n\\n \"We were going to build a box,\" Alec explained.\\n\\n \"A box?\"\\n\\n \"A burial box,\" the priest interjected.\\n\\n Jamie looked incredulous. She felt like putting her hands over Angus\u0027s ears so he wouldn\u0027t hear this discouraging talk. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, you\u0027d put Angus in the ground before he quit breathing?\"\\n\\n \"No, we\u0027d wait,\" Alec answered. \"You really think you can save him, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"What can I do to help?\" Gavin asked before Jamie could answer her husband.\\n\\n \"I need more light, linen strips, a goblet of warm water, bowls with more water, and two slats of wood, Gavin, about this size and length,\" she instructed, showing him with her hands the desired dimensions.\\n\\n If they thought her requests didn\u0027t make any sense, they didn\u0027t mention it to her.\\n\\n \"His arm is broken, lass. Do you think to cut it off?\" the priest asked.\\n\\n A soldier behind Jamie\u0027s back muttered, \"Angus would rather die than have his arm removed.\"\\n\\n \"We aren\u0027t going to cut his arm off,\" Jamie announced in exasperation. \"We\u0027re going to straighten it.\"\\n\\n \"You can do this?\" the priest asked.\\n\\n \"I can.\"\\n\\n The circle of men tightened around the table. Gavin nudged his way next to his mistress. \"Here\u0027s the goblet of water you wanted. The bowls are behind you.\"\\n\\n Jamie opened one of the medicine jars, pinched a sprinkle of brown powder between her thumb and forefinger, and mixed it with the water in the goblet. When the liquid had turned murky, she handed it to Gavin. \"Please hold this for just a moment.\"\\n\\n \"What is it, mistress?\" Gavin asked, sniffing the potion.\\n\\n \"A sleeping drink for Angus. It will also ease his pain.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s already sleeping.\"\\n\\n Jamie didn\u0027t recognize the voice, knew another soldier had called out that comment. His tone had been fil ed with anger.\\n\\n \"Aye, he\u0027s sleeping,\" another muttered. \"Anyone can see he is.\"\\n\\n \"He is not sleeping,\" Jamie countered, trying to hold her patience. She knew she\u0027d have to gain their confidence if she was going to get their help.\\n\\n \"Then why ain\u0027t he talking to us or looking at us?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in too much pain,\" Jamie answered. \"Alec, would you hold his head up so he can drink more easily?\"\\n\\n Alec was the only one who didn\u0027t argue with her. He moved closer to the table and lifted Angus\u0027s head.\\n\\n Jamie leaned over his friend, cupped his face in her hands, and spoke to him. \"Angus, open your eyes and look at me.\"\\n\\n She had to repeat her demand three times, bel owing the last, before the warrior finally complied.\\n\\n A surprised murmur rushed around the table. The doubting Thomases had just been convinced.\\n\\n \"Angus, you must drink this,\" Jamie ordered. \"It will take your pain away.\" She didn\u0027t let up on her prodding until the warrior had swal owed a large portion.\\n\\n Then she sighed with satisfaction. \"It will only take a minute or two before the potion does its work.\"\\n\\n After making that statement, Jamie glanced up.\\n\\n Alec was smiling at her.\\n\\n \"He could stil catch fever and die,\" she whispered, fearing she\u0027d given him too much hope and not enough caution.\\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t dare.\"\\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"Not after the way you screamed at him,\" Alec replied.\\n\\n Jamie felt herself blush. \"I had to raise my voice,\" she explained. \" \u0027Twas the only way I could get him to respond.\"\\n\\n \"I think he\u0027s sleeping now,\" Gavin interjected.\\n\\n \"We shal see,\" Jamie announced. She once again leaned over Angus and cupped his face in her hands.\\n\\n \"Is the pain leaving you yet?\" she asked.\\n\\n The warrior slowly opened his eyes. Jamie could see the medicine was beginning to work, for his brown eyes were glazed.\\n\\n His face had taken on a tranquil expression, too. \"Have I gone to heaven?\" Angus asked, his voice a scratchy whisper. \"Are you my angel?\"\\n\\n Jamie smiled. \"No, Angus. You\u0027re stil in the Highlands.\"\\n\\n A look of horror crossed the warrior\u0027s face. \"Good God Almighty, I ain\u0027t in heaven. I\u0027m in hel . It be a cruel trick the devil plays. You look like an angel, but you sound… English.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d roared the last of his statement and immediately started struggling. Jamie leaned so close to his right ear she was almost kissing him, then whispered in Gaelic, \"Rest easy, friend. You\u0027re safe in Scots\u0027 hands, you are,\" she lied. \"Picture your next battle with the English if it will make you feel any better, but hush your talk now. Let the potion woo you to sleep.\"\\n\\n The soft burr she\u0027d deliberately put in her voice sounded awful to her. Angus was too drowsy to notice, though. He quit his struggles and closed his eyes again.\\n\\n He fel asleep with a smile on his face.\\n\\n Jamie thought he might be counting the number of English soldiers he was going to kil .\\n\\n \"What did you say to him, milady?\" a soldier asked over her shoulder.\\n\\n \"I told him he was too stubborn to die just yet,\" Jamie replied with a dainty shrug.\\n\\n Gavin was disconcerted. \"But how would you be knowing if Angus was stubborn or not?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a Scotsman, isn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n Gavin looked over at Alec to see if they were supposed to be amused or insulted by Lady Kincaid\u0027s comment. Alec was smiling. Gavin decided his mistress must have meant to jest with him. A frown marred his brow, and he began to wonder how long it was going to take him to understand this unusual Englishwoman. Her sweet voice was as deceptive as her appearance. She was such a delicate-looking little thing. Why, the top of her head barely reached her husband\u0027s shoulder. That husky voice of hers could coax him into complying with each and every request she gave if he didn\u0027t stay on his guard.\\n\\n \"I would also like to help you.\"\\n\\n The tearful voice belonged to Elizabeth. She stood across the table, facing Jamie. The fair-haired woman stil looked frightened, but determined, too, and when Jamie smiled at her, she gave a hesitant smile back.\\n\\n \"Angus is my husband. I\u0027l do whatever you tel me to do.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thankful for your help,\" Jamie told her. \"Dampen this cloth and press it to your husband\u0027s brow,\" she directed.\\n\\n Jamie pul ed three stockings out of her pocket and slipped one of them over the wood slat Gavin had provided. Before she was finished, one of the soldiers had covered the second slat for her.\\n\\n Her hands were shaking now, for the task she most dreaded couldn\u0027t be delayed any longer. It was time to straighten Angus\u0027s arm.\\n\\n \"In England, it has become fashionable to use a sleeping sponge to put a man to sleep, but I don\u0027t hold with that form of treatment,\" she rambled. \"I pray Angus will sleep through this.\"\\n\\n \"Would he sleep better if you\u0027d used the sponge?\" a soldier asked.\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" Jamie answered. \"But he might not wake up. Most don\u0027t. The disadvantage does outweigh the merit, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n The soldiers immediately blurted out their agreement.\\n\\n \"Alec? You\u0027re going to have to do this for me. I don\u0027t have the strength,\" she said. \"Gavin, I\u0027l need long strips of linen ready to bind the slats together.\"\\n\\n Jamie worked the third stocking over Angus\u0027s swol en hand, paused to cut five holes in the toe of the sock, then eased his fingers and thumb through the openings. Each time she touched his arm, she gave Angus a quick, worried glance to see if he\u0027d awakened.\\n\\n \"Alec, take hold of his hand. Gavin, you hold his upper arm,\" she directed. \"Pul , but ever so slowly please, until I can straighten the bone. Elizabeth, you must turn your back now. I don\u0027t want you watching this.\"\\n\\n Jamie took a deep, settling breath, then murmured, \"God, I do hate this part of my duties. Do it now.\"\\n\\n It took three attempts before she was satisfied that the broken ends of the bone were in the correct position. She slid the first slat under the arm, then put the second on top. Her hands shook. Alec held the slats in place while Jamie wound the strips of linen around and around the wood. When she was finished, Angus\u0027s arm was firmly locked in place.\\n\\n \"There, the worst is finished,\" she said with a deep sigh of relief.\\n\\n \"But his chest, milady,\" the priest reminded her. He let out a loud, painful-sounding cough, then added, \"It\u0027s got a gaping hole in it.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-22.html","bookId":1852,"book":{"id":1852,"title":"The Bride (Lairds\u0027 Fiancees #1)","description":"Storyline: By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride.
