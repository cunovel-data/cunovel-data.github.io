{"id":83788,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Chattanooga is a city that seems stopped in time, like a Rebel\u0027s rusted pocketwatch. The broad Tennessee River meanders around it, interstates pierce its heart, railroads connect the warehouses and factories with those in other places; the river, interstates, and railroads enter Chattanooga and leave it, but Chattanooga remains like a faded damsel waiting for some suitor long dead and buried. She turns her face away from the modern, and pines for what can never be again. The huge mass of Lookout Mountain rises over Chattanooga, the faded damsel\u0027s dowager hump. It was Lookout Mountain that Laura saw before she saw the city. Its appearance, at first a looming purple shadow on the horizon, made Laura\u0027s foot heavier on the BMW\u0027s gas pedal. at eighteen minutes after one she pulled off the interstate at Germantown Road, found a pay phone with a phone book, and looked up M.K. Treggs. The address was 904 Hilliard Street. Laura bought a city map at a gas station, pinpointed Hilliard Street on it, and got the gas jockey to tell her the best way to get there. Then she was off again, driving in the bright afternoon sunlight toward the northeastern side of Chattanooga. The address was a small wood-frame house in a nest of similar houses across from a shopping center. It was painted pale blue, and the house\u0027s postage-stamp-size lawn had been turned into a rock garden with a pebbled walkway. The mailbox was one of those plastic jobs with redbirds on it. a rope and tire swing hung from a tree branch, and in the driveway was a white Yugo with rust splotches. Laura pulled her car in front of the house and got out. The chill breeze ruffled her hair, and made the six or seven wind chimes that hung from the front porch\u0027s rafters clang and bong and jingle and clink. a dog next door began to bark furiously. Big brown dog behind a chain-link fence, she noted. She walked up onto the porch and rang the doorbell, surrounded by chimes. The inner door opened, but the screen door stayed closed. a slender, petite woman with braided brown hair peered cautiously out. \"Can I help youi\" \"I\u0027m Laura Clayborne. I called you from atlanta.\" The woman just stared at her. \"I called you at eleven,\" Laura went on. \"I\u0027ve come to talk to your husband.\" \"You\u0027re... the lady who calledi You came from atlantai\" She blinked, the information sinking in. \"That\u0027s right. I can\u0027t tell you how important it is that I see your husband.\" \"I know who you are.\" The woman nodded. \"You\u0027re the one whose baby was taken. Mark and I talked about that. I knew I\u0027d heard your name before!\" Laura stood there, waiting. Then the woman said, \"Oh! Come on in!\" She unlatched the screen door, and opened it wide to accept Laura. In her college days Laura had been in many dorm rooms and hippie apartments. Her own apartment had been pretty much \"hippified,\" or at least what passed for such at the University of Georgia. The house immediately took her back to those days. It was full of cheap apartment furniture, with crates serving as book and record cases, a big orange beanbag chair with UT emblazoned on it, and a beige sofa that looked as if it had been slept on for quite a number of years. Vases with dried flowers stood about, and on the walls were actual, genuine, real McCoy black light posters, one showing the astrological signs and the other depicting a three-masted ship against a full moon. a wood carving on one wall read LET IT BE. Laura was sure she smelted strawberry incense and lentils cooking. Fat, half-burned candles - those kinds with intricate wax designs and varicolored bands on them - were arranged on a countertop, next to books that included the works of Kahlil Gibran and Rod McKuen. Laura could look through a corridor and see a poster at the end of it: War Is Not Healthy for Children and Other Living Things. The sensation of stepping back into time might have been complete for Laura except for some GoBots scattered on the floor and a Nintendo atop the television set. The woman with braided hair scooped up the GoBots. \"Kids,\" she said with a toothy smile. \"They leave stuff everywhere, don\u0027t theyi\" Laura spotted a Barbie doll clad in a doll-size shimmery white gown, leaning against a record crate full of battered-looking album jackets. \"You have two childreni\" \"Right on. Mark Junior\u0027s ten, and Becca\u0027s just turned eight. Sorry the place is a wreck. Getting \u0027em off to school some mornings\u0027s like a tornado passing through. Get you some teai I\u0027ve just made some Red Zinger.\" It had been years since Laura had tasted Red Zinger tea. \"That would be fine,\" she said, and she followed the woman into the cramped little kitchen. The refrigerator had peace signs painted all over it in vivid colors. The crayon drawings of children were taped up. Love You, Mom was printed on one of them. Laura looked quickly away from it, because a lump had risen into her throat. \"I\u0027m Rose,\" the woman said. \"Pleased to meet you.\" She offered her hand, and Laura shook it. Then Rose went about her task of getting cups and pouring the tea from a brown clay pot. \"We\u0027ve got raw sugar,\" she said, and Laura told her that would be fine, too. as Rose got their tea ready, Laura saw the woman had on Birkenstock sandals, staple hippie footwear. Rose Treggs wore faded jeans with patched knees and a bulky sea-green sweater that was a dozen rubs away from giving at the elbows. She was about five feet tall, and she moved with the quick, birdlike energy of petite people. In the kitchen\u0027s sunlight, Laura could see the hints of gray in Rose Treggs\u0027s hair. The woman had an attractive, open face and freckles across her nose and cheeks, but the lines around her mouth and at the comers of her dark blue eyes told a tale of a hard life. \"Here you go,\" Rose said, giving Laura a rough clay cup with a hippie\u0027s long-jawed, bearded face molded into it. \"You want lemoni\" \"No, thanks.\" She sipped the tea. Few things in life remained the same, but Red Zinger persevered. They sat in the living room, amid the relics of a bygone age. Looking around at it all, Laura imagined the voice of Bob Dylan singing \"Blowin\u0027 in the Wind.\" She could feel Rose watching her, nervously waiting for her to speak. \"I read your husband\u0027s book,\" Laura began. \"Which onei He\u0027s written three.\" \"Burn This Book.\" \"Oh, right. That\u0027s sold the best. almost four hundred copies.\" \"I reviewed it for the Constitution. \"The review, however, had never been printed. \"It was interesting.\" \"We\u0027ve got our own publishing company,\" Rose said. \"Mountaintop Press.\" She smiled and shrugged. \"Well, it\u0027s just a typeset machine and some stuff in the basement, really. We sell mostly by mail order, to college bookstores. But that\u0027s how Benjamin Franklin started, huhi\" Laura leaned forward in her chair. \"Rosei I have to talk to your husband. You understand what\u0027s happened to me, don\u0027t youi\" Rose nodded. \"We saw it on the news and read about it, too. Blew our minds. But you don\u0027t look like your picture.\" \"My baby has been stolen from me,\" Laura said, holding the tears back by sheer willpower. \"He was two days old. His name is David, and I... I wanted a child very badly.\" Careful, she thought. Her eyes were burning. \"You know who took my baby, don\u0027t youi\" \"Yeah. Mary Terror. We thought she was dead by now.\" \"Mary Terror,\" Laura repeated, her gaze fixed on Rose\u0027s face. \"The FBI\u0027s looking for her. But they can\u0027t find her. It\u0027s been twelve days, and she\u0027s disappeared with my son. Do you have any idea how long twelve days can bei\" Rose didn\u0027t answer. She looked away from Laura because the woman\u0027s intense stare made her nervous. \"Every day can stretch and stretch until you feel as if it\u0027s never going to end,\" Laura continued. \"You think the hours are stuck. and at night, when it\u0027s so quiet you can hear your heart beat... at night it\u0027s the worst. I\u0027ve got an empty nursery in my house, and Mary Terrell has my son. I read your husband\u0027s book. I read about the Storm Front in it. He knows someone who was a member of the Storm Front, doesn\u0027t hei\" \"That was a long time ago.\" \"I realize that. But anything he could tell me might help the FBI, Rose. anything. as it is, they\u0027re spinning their wheels. I can\u0027t take many more days of waiting for a phone call to tell me if my David is alive or dead. Can you understand thati\" Rose released a long breath and nodded, her face downcast. \"Yeah. When we heard about it, we had a long talk. We wondered how we\u0027d feel if somebody took Mark Junior or Becca. It would be a heavy trip, that\u0027s for sure.\" She looked up. \"Mark did know a woman who belonged to the Storm Front. But he didn\u0027t know Mary Terror. He doesn\u0027t know anything that would help you get your baby back.\" \"How can you be sure about thati Maybe your husband knows something that he doesn\u0027t think is important, but it could be of real value. I don\u0027t think I have to tell you how desperate I am. You\u0027re a mother. You know how you\u0027d feel.\" She saw Rose frown, the lines deepening. \"Please. I need to find your husband and ask him some questions. I won\u0027t take much of his time. Will you tell me where I can find himi\" Rose\u0027s teeth worked her lower lip. She swirled the Red Zinger around her teacup, and then she said, \"Yeah. Okay. There\u0027s a phone number, but I didn\u0027t give it to you because they don\u0027t like to go out and track down the custodians. I mean, it\u0027s a big place.\" \"Where does your husband worki\" Rose told her where, and how to get there. Laura finished her tea, said thank you, and left the house. at the front door Rose wished her peace, and the chimes stirred in the chill breeze. Rock City was perched atop Lookout Mountain. It was not a suburb of Chattanooga, but rather a tourist attraction of walkways winding between huge, wind-chiseled boulders, a waterfall plummeting from a sheer cliff, and rock gardens with benches for the weary. Signs with bearded elves pointed out the admission gate and the parking lot. On such a cold day, even with the sun shining, the lot was all but empty. Laura paid her money in a building where Indian arrowheads and Confederate caps were on sale, and she was told by the clerk that Mark Treggs was probably out sweeping the path near the Swinging Bridge. She started off, following the walkway over, around, and sometimes even through the center of gargantuan rocks, the denuded bones of Lookout Mountain. She easily got through a crevice called Fatman\u0027s Squeeze, and she realized she was losing the weight of pregnancy. The pathway took her up into the sunlight again, out of the freezing shadows of the stones, and she at last saw the Swinging Bridge ahead of her. There was no one on the path, though. She crossed the bridge, which indeed did creak and swing, a gorge full of rocks about sixty feet below. She continued along the path, her hands thrust into the pockets of her overcoat. She didn\u0027t see anyone else anywhere. One thing she noticed, though: the walkways couldn\u0027t have been cleaner. and then she came around a curve and she heard it: the high, birdlike notes of a pennywhistle. Laura followed the music. In another moment she found him. He was sitting cross-legged atop a boulder, his rake and broom leaning against the stone, and he was playing a pennywhistle and staring toward a vast panorama of pine woods and blue sky. \"Mr. Treggsi\" she said, standing at the boulder\u0027s base. He kept playing. The music was slow and gentle, and sad in a way. a pennywhistle, Laura thought, was an instrument played in circuses by clowns with tears painted on their cheeks. \"Mr. Treggsi\" she repeated a little louder. The music stopped. Mark Treggs took the pennywhistle from his mouth and looked down at her. He had a long dark-brown beard peppered with gray and his hair hung over his shoulders, a blue baseball cap on his head. Under thick, gray-flecked brows, his large, luminous hazel eyes peered at Laura from behind wire-framed granny glasses. \"Yesi\" \"My name is Laura Clayborne. I\u0027ve come from atlanta to find you.\" Mark Treggs squinted, as if trying to get her into focus. \"I don\u0027t... think I know...\" \"Laura Clayborne,\" she said again. \"Mary Terrell stole my baby twelve days ago.\" His mouth opened, but he didn\u0027t say anything. \"I read Burn This Book, \"she went on. \"You talked about the Storm Front. You said you knew someone who belonged to it. I\u0027ve come to ask you -\" \"Oh,\" he said. It was a boyish voice that did not go with the gray. \"Oh, wow.\" \"For help,\" Laura finished. \"I saw you on the tube! My old lady and I both saw you! We were talking about you just last night!\" He scrambled down off the boulder with surefooted ease. He was wearing a brown uniform and a jacket with Rock City stenciled in red on one breast pocket and Mark on the other. Treggs stood about six three and was as skinny as a spider monkey, his face all beard, wild eyebrows, and goggly eyes behind the glasses. \"Man, what a trip! I swear, we were talking about you!\" \"I saw Rose. She told me where to find you.\" The cup, she thought. The face on it was his. \"You went to my housei Wow!\" \"Mr. Treggsi Listen to me. I need your help. You know someone who belonged to the Storm Front. Is that righti\" His goofy smile began to fade. He blinked a few times, regaining his equilibrium. \"Oh,\" he said. \"That\u0027s why you\u0027re herei\" \"Yes. I read your latest book.\" \"My book. Right.\" He nodded, and slid the pennywhistle into his back pocket. \"Listen... excuse me, but I\u0027ve got to get back to work.\" He retrieved the rake and broom. \"I can\u0027t sit around too long. They get mad.\" He started to move away. Laura followed him. \"Wait a minute! Didn\u0027t you hear what I saidi\" She reached out, grasped his shoulder, and stopped his gawky, long-legged strides. \"I\u0027m asking you for your help!\" \"I can\u0027t help you,\" he said flatly. \"Sorry.\" again he began striding away. Laura kept pace, a surge of anger rising and whorls of red in her cheeks. \"Mr. Treggs! Wait, please! Just give me one minute!\" He kept going, his speed picking up. \"Wait! Just hear me out!\" Faster still. \"I SaID WaIT, DaMN IT!\" Laura shouted, and she grabbed Mark Treggs by the left arm, spun him around with all her strength, and slammed his back against a smooth boulder. He gave a little grunt, and the rake and broom slid from his hand. His eyes had grown larger, owlish, and frightened. \"Please,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t stand violence.\" \"Neither can I! But by God my son was stolen from me by a murderess, and you\u0027re going to tell me what I want to know!\" She shook him. \"Can you dig it, mani\" He didn\u0027t answer. Then, quietly: \"Yeah, I can dig it.\" \"Good.\" Laura released him, but she blocked his way so he couldn\u0027t escape. \"You knew a Storm Fronter. Who was iti\" Treggs looked around. \"Okay, come on! Where\u0027re the pigs hidingi You brought \u0027em, didn\u0027t youi\" \"No police. Nobody but me.\" \"Well, it doesn\u0027t matter anyhow.\" He shrugged. \"I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re wired. So I was in a commune for a few months with Bedelia Morse. Didi to her friends. So whati I didn\u0027t hang out with the Storm Premiers, so you can put that in the pig pipe and let \u0027em smoke it.\" \"What happened to Bedelia Morsei Did she die at the Shootout in New Jerseyi\" \"No, she got away. Listen, that\u0027s all I know. I was in a commune with Didi and about eight other people back in \u0027sixty-nine, before she got into the Storm Front. We were in South Carolina, and we broke up after four months because everybody got tired of getting rousted by the local pigs. End of story.\" \"Didn\u0027t you know her at Berkeleyi\" \"Uh-uh. She didn\u0027t go to Berkeley. She got hooked on the Storm Front when she went to New York. Listen, I didn\u0027t know anything else about her. Okayi\" \"and you haven\u0027t heard from her sincei\" \"No way.\" Treggs bent his long body over and picked up the rake and broom. \"You got your wire turned up loud enough for the pigs to heari Read my lips: No way.\" \"What about Mary Terrelli Is there anything you can tell me about heri\" \"Yeah.\" He took off his glasses, pulled a handkerchief from his shirt, and cleaned the lenses. \"But you already know. She\u0027s crazy as hell. She won\u0027t give up to the pigs. They\u0027ll have to kill her.\" \"and she\u0027ll kill my son. Is that what you\u0027re sayingi\" \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" He put his glasses back on. \"Listen, Mrs. Clayborne, I\u0027m sorry about all this. Really I am. But I don\u0027t know anything else about the Storm Front that the pigs - I mean, that the police and FBI don\u0027t already know. I\u0027m sorry you came all this way, but I can\u0027t help you.\" Laura had an instant where she feared she might pass out. She\u0027d built up her hopes - for what, she wasn\u0027t sure - and now this was nothing but a dead end. \"You don\u0027t look so good,\" Treggs said. \"You want to sit downi\" She nodded, and he took her by the arm and led her to a bench. \"You want a Cokei I can get you one.\" She shook her head, fighting nausea. She realized that if she threw up, Treggs would have to clean up the mess. It might be worthwhile to do it, just for the hell of it. But she didn\u0027t, and she lifted her face to the breeze and felt the cold sweat begin to dry. She said in a husky voice, \"Is there anything elsei Do you have any idea where Mary Terrell might bei\" \"No. I don\u0027t know where Didi is, either. That was a long time ago.\" He sat down on the bench beside her, his long legs splayed out. He wore red adidas sneakers with stars on them. \"That commune,\" he mused. \"Man, it seems like that was part of a different world. Well, it was, wasn\u0027t iti\" He squinted in the sunlight, and watched a hawk circle above the mountain. \"Long time gone,\" he said. \"We had a nice life. Lived on a little farm, had a couple of cows and some chickens. We didn\u0027t bother anybody. all we wanted to do was find nirvana. Know what the pigs finally busted us fori\" He waited for Laura to shake her head. \"No business license. See, Didi made things. She was a potter, and she sold stuff in town. She was doing pretty good, too, then bam: no business license. Man, I don\u0027t see why we don\u0027t run out of trees, with all the paper you get choked with. I mean, how come we\u0027ve still got forests, with all the paper that\u0027s been used in all of historyi and think about wooden furniture, and houses, and everything else made of wood. How come we\u0027ve still got forestsi\" He prodded her with a sharp elbow. \"Huhi\" \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe you should write a book about it.\" \"Yeah, maybe I will,\" he said. \"But then that would be using more paper, wouldn\u0027t iti Seei a vicious cycle.\" They sat for a while in silence. The cold wind strengthened, and Laura heard the cry of a hawk on its current. Mark Treggs stood up. \"You ought to see the rest of Rock City while you\u0027re here. It\u0027s nice. Peaceful, this time of year. You feel like you own the whole place.\" \"I don\u0027t feel much like sightseeing.\" \"No, I guess not. Well, I\u0027ve got to get back to work. Can you find your way outi\" Laura nodded. Where was she going to goi and what was she going to do when she got therei Treggs hesitated, holding the broom and rake. \"Listen... for what it\u0027s worth, I\u0027m really sorry about what\u0027s happened. I thought Mary Terrell was dead, buried in an unmarked grave somewhere. I guess you never know who\u0027s going to turn up, huhi\" \"You never know,\" Laura agreed. \"Right. Well, you take care. Too bad you had to come all this way for nothing.\" He still lingered, throwing a skinny shadow at her feet. \"I hope they find your baby,\" he said. \"Peace.\" He made the sign, and then he turned and walked away. She let him go. What was the pointi at last, when she was sure she wasn\u0027t going to be sick, she stood up. What to do nowi Go back to atlanta. No, no. She didn\u0027t feel like making the drive this afternoon. Maybe she\u0027d find a motel room, get herself a bottle of cheap red wine, and let it rip. Two bottles, maybe. What the helli She followed her shadow along the winding trail of Rock City; it was the thin, compressed shadow of a woman crushed between the past and the future, and every direction it pointed toward seemed hopeless.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-21.html","bookId":2480,"book":{"id":2480,"title":"Mine","description":"Storyline: Adrift in the 1980s and slowly losing her mind, a heavily armed former \u002760s radical kidnaps a baby with the hope, deluded as it may be, of returning her life to simpler times.
