{"id":83786,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"as Laura prayed in atlanta, a gray Coupe De Ville slowed on a forested road sixty miles northwest of Richmond. The car took a curve off the main road onto one that was narrower, and continued another half mile. Its headlights glinted off the windows of a house on a bluff, nestled amid pines and century-old oaks. The windows of the house were dark, and no smoke rose from the white stone chimney. Telephone and electric lines stretched from here to the highway, a rugged distance. Natalie Terrell stopped her car before the steps of the front porch, and she got out into the bitter wind.\\n\\n a half moon had broken free of the clouds. It threw sparks of silver onto the ruffled water of Lake anna, which the house overlooked. another road snaked down the hill to a boathouse and pier. Natalie saw no other car, but she knew: her daughter was there.\\n\\n Shivering, she walked up the steps to the porch. She tried the doorknob, and the door opened. She walked inside, out of the wind, and she started to reach for the light switch.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n She stopped. Her heart had given a vicious jolt.\\n\\n \"are you alonei\"\\n\\n Natalie strained to see where her daughter was in the room, but couldn\u0027t find her. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"They didn\u0027t follow youi\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t turn on the lights. Close the door and step away from it.\"\\n\\n Natalie did. She saw a shape rise up from a chair, and she stood with her back against a wall as it passed her. Mary stared out a window, watching the road. Her size - her largeness - made pure fear leech to Natalie\u0027s stomach. Her daughter was taller than she by about four inches, and much broader through the shoulders. Mary stood motionless in the dark, her gaze on the road as her mother shrank back from her presence.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t they follow youi\" Mary asked.\\n\\n \"They... went somewhere else. I sent them...\" Fear had her by the throat and wouldn\u0027t let her speak. \"I sent them to the beach house.\"\\n\\n \"They had a tap on the line.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I figured they\u0027d have one of those new phone-tracer gizmos. That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t call from here. Like I said, Big Brother\u0027s in action, huhi\"\\n\\n Mary\u0027s face turned toward her mother. Natalie couldn\u0027t make out her features, but something about her face was brutal. \"So how come you didn\u0027t tell them I was coming herei\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Natalie answered. It was the truth.\\n\\n \"Mother,\" Mary said, and she walked to her and gave her a cold kiss on the cheek.\\n\\n Natalie couldn\u0027t suppress a shudder. Her daughter smelled unclean. She felt Mary\u0027s hand rest against her shoulder, there was something gripped in it, and Natalie realized Mary was holding a gun.\\n\\n Mary stepped back, and mother and daughter stared at each other in the dark. \"It\u0027s been a long time,\" Mary said. \"You\u0027ve gotten older.\"\\n\\n \"No doubt.\"\\n\\n \"Well, so have I.\" She wandered to the window again, peering out. \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d come. I figured you were going to send the pigs after me.\"\\n\\n \"Then why did you calli\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve missed you,\" Mary said. \"and Father, too. I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t bring the pigs. I saw your car pull in, and I knew pigs don\u0027t drive Cadillacs. But I\u0027m parked down at the boathouse, and if I saw somebody following you I was going to take my baby and get out on the lake road.\" The lake road was a trail, really, that wound around much of Lake anna before joining the main road. This time of year a gate closed the trail off, but Mary had already broken the gate off its hinges to allow a quick escape.\\n\\n My baby, Mary had said. \"Where\u0027s the childi\" Natalie asked.\\n\\n \"Back bedroom. I\u0027ve got him wrapped up in a blanket so he\u0027ll be all comfy-cozy. I didn\u0027t want to start a fire. You never can tell who might smell the smoke. The rangers\u0027 station is still a couple of miles north, isn\u0027t iti\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" The lake house, constructed for summer use, had no furnace but there were three fireplaces for cool nights. Right now the house was as chilly as a tomb.\\n\\n \"So why didn\u0027t you bring the pigsi\"\\n\\n Natalie could feel her daughter watching her, like a wary animal. \"Because I knew you wouldn\u0027t give up if they caught you. I knew they\u0027d have to kill you.\"\\n\\n \"But isn\u0027t that what you wanti You said it in the papers: you wouldn\u0027t cry if I was dead.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. I was thinking of the baby.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" She nodded. Her mother had always loved babies; it was when they got older that she turned her back in boredom. Mary had taken a gamble, and it had worked. \"Okay, I can dig it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to know why you stole him from his mother.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m his mother,\" Mary said flatly. \"I told you. I\u0027ve named him Drummer.\"\\n\\n Natalie moved out of the corner. Mary\u0027s gaze tracked her across the room, and her mother stopped near the cold fireplace made of fieldstones. \"Stealing a baby is a new one for you, isn\u0027t iti Murders, bombings, and terrorism weren\u0027t enough for youi You had to steal an innocent child not two days oldi\"\\n\\n \"Talk, talk,\" Mary said. \"You\u0027re still the same, talking that shit.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d better listen to me, damn it!\" Natalie snapped, much louder than she\u0027d intended. \"By God, they\u0027re going to hunt you down for this! They\u0027ll kill you and drag your body through the street! Sweet Jesus, what\u0027s in your mind to make you do such a thingi\"\\n\\n Mary was silent for a moment. She set the Colt down on a table, close enough to get it fast if she needed it. The coast was clear, though; the pigs were sniffing around the family\u0027s beach house by now. \"I always wanted a baby,\" Mary told her. \"One of my own, I mean. From my own body.\"\\n\\n \"and so you steal another woman\u0027s childi\"\\n\\n \"Talking shit,\" Mary chided her mother. Then: \"I almost had a baby once. Before I got hurt. That was a long time ago, but... sometimes I still think I can feel the baby kick. Maybe it\u0027s a ghost, huhi a ghost, up inside me trying to get out. Well, I let the ghost out. I gave him bones, skin, and a name: Drummer. He\u0027s my baby now, and no one in this mindfucked world\u0027s going to take him away from me.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll kill you. They\u0027ll hunt you down and kill you, and you know it.\"\\n\\n \"Let them try. I\u0027m ready.\"\\n\\n Natalie heard a sound that made her sick with anguish: the thin noise of a baby crying, from the guest bedroom. Mary said, \"He\u0027s a good kid. He doesn\u0027t cry very much.\"\\n\\n \"aren\u0027t you going to go get himi\"\\n\\n \"No. He\u0027ll go back to sleep in a few minutes.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s hungry!\" She felt her cold cheeks redden with anger. \"are you letting him starve to deathi\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got formula for him. Don\u0027t you get it, Motheri I love Drummer. I\u0027m not going to let anything hap -\"\\n\\n \"Balls,\" Natalie said, and she strode past her daughter into the hallway. She reached out, found a light switch, and turned on the overhead light. It stung her eyes for a few seconds, and she heard Mary pick up the gun again. Natalie continued into the guest bedroom, turned on a lamp, and looked at the crying, red-faced baby wrapped in a coarse gray blanket on the bed. She wasn\u0027t prepared for the sight of such a small infant, and her heart ached. This child\u0027s mother - Laura Clayborne they said her name was - must be ready for an asylum by now. She picked up the crying infant and held him against her. \"There, there,\" she said. \"It\u0027s all right, everything\u0027s going to be all -\"\\n\\n Mary came into the room. Natalie saw the animal cunning in her daughter\u0027s eyes, the years of hardscrabble living etched on her face. Mary once was a beautiful, vivacious young woman, the belle of the ball in Richmond society. Now she resembled a bag lady, used to living under train trestles and eating out of cast-iron pots. Natalie looked quickly away from her, before her eyes were overpowered by the waste of a human being. \"This child\u0027s hungry. You can hear it in his crying. and he needs his diaper changed! Damn right, you don\u0027t know the first thing about taking care of a baby, do youi\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve had some practice,\" Mary said, watching her mother rock Drummer with a gentle motion.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the formulai We\u0027re going to warm some up and feed this child, right this minute!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s in the car. You\u0027ll walk down to the boathouse with me, won\u0027t youi\" It was a command, not a question. Natalie hated the boathouse; it was where Grant had hanged himself from an overhead rafter.\\n\\n When they returned, Natalie switched on the kitchen stove and warmed a bottle of formula. Mary sat at the small table and watched her mother feed the freshly diapered Drummer, the Colt near at hand. The shine of light on her mother\u0027s diamond rings drew Mary\u0027s attention. \"That\u0027s right, that\u0027s right,\" Natalie crooned. \"Baby\u0027s having a good dinner now, isn\u0027t himi Yes, him is!\"\\n\\n \"Did you ever hold me like thati\" Mary asked.\\n\\n Natalie ceased her crooning. The baby sucked noisily at the nipple.\\n\\n \"What about Granti Did you hold him like that, tooi\"\\n\\n The nipple popped out of the infant\u0027s mouth. He made a little wailing sound of need, and Natalie guided the nipple back into his cupid\u0027s-bow lips. What would Mary do, she wondered, if she were to suddenly turn away, walk out of this house with David Clayborne, and get into the cari Her gaze fixed on the Colt and then skittered away.\\n\\n Mary read it. \"I\u0027ll take my son now,\" she said, and she stood up and lifted Drummer away from her mother. Drummer kept feeding, staring up at her with big, unfocused blue eyes. \"Isn\u0027t he prettyi I almost had a wreck looking at him. He\u0027s so pretty, isn\u0027t hei\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not your son.\"\\n\\n \"Talking shit,\" Mary crooned to Drummer. \"Talking shit shit shit, yes she is.\"\\n\\n \"Please listen to me! It\u0027s not right! I don\u0027t know why you did this, or what... what\u0027s in your mind, but you can\u0027t keep him! You\u0027ve got to give him up! Listen to me!\" she insisted as Mary turned her back. \"I\u0027m begging you! Don\u0027t put this child in danger! Do you hear mei\"\\n\\n Silence, but for the sucking. Then: \"I hear you.\"\\n\\n \"Leave him with me. I\u0027ll take him to the police. Then you can go on wherever you want to, I don\u0027t care. Lose yourself. Go underground. Just let me take that child back where he belongs.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s already where he belongs.\"\\n\\n Natalie glanced at the pistol again, lying on the table. Two steps away. Did she darei Was it loaded, or noti If she picked it up, could she use it if she had toi Her mind careened toward a decision.\\n\\n Mary held the baby with one hand and retrieved the gun with the other. She tucked it down in the waistband of her faded denims. \"Mother,\" she said, and she looked into Natalie\u0027s face with her cold, intense eyes in that hard and bitter face, \"we don\u0027t live in the same world. We never did. I played the game for as long as I could stand it. Then I knew: your world would break me if I didn\u0027t fight back. It would grind me down, put me in a wedding dress and give me a diamond ring, and I would look across the dining room table at some stupid stranger and hear the screams of injustice every day of my life, but by then I\u0027d be too weak to care. I\u0027d live in a big house in Richmond with foxhunt paintings on the walls, and I\u0027d worry about finding good help. I\u0027d think that maybe we should have nuked Vietnam, and I wouldn\u0027t give a shit about whether the pigs billy-clubbed students in the streets and whether the Mindfuck State got fat on the bodies of the uneducated masses. Your world would have killed me, Mother. Can\u0027t you understandi\"\\n\\n \"all that is past history,\" Natalie answered. \"The fighting in the streets is over. The student rebellions, the protests... all of it is gone. Why can\u0027t you let it goi\"\\n\\n Mary smiled thinly. \"It\u0027s not gone. People just forgot. I\u0027m going to make them remember.\"\\n\\n \"Howi By committing more murdersi\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a soldier. My war didn\u0027t end. It\u0027ll never end.\" She kissed Drummer on the forehead, and her mother flinched. \"He\u0027s part of the next generation. He\u0027ll carry on the fight. I\u0027ll teach him what we did for freedom, and he\u0027ll know the war\u0027s never over.\" She smiled into the baby\u0027s face. \"My sweet, sweet Drummer.\"\\n\\n Natalie Terrell had thought for over twenty years that her daughter was unbalanced. Now it came at her in a savage rush: she was standing in a kitchen with a madwoman who held a bottle of formula to an infant\u0027s lips. There was no way to reach her, she was beyond touching, a resident of a world of twisted patriotism and midnight slaughters. For the first time, she feared for her own life.\\n\\n \"So you sent them to the beach house,\" Mary said, still looking at Drummer. \"That was motherly of you. Well, they\u0027ll find out soon enough that I\u0027m not there. The pigs won\u0027t be kind to you, Mother. You may get a taste of the whip.\"\\n\\n \"I did it because I didn\u0027t want to see that child hurt, and I hoped -\"\\n\\n \"I know what you hoped. That you could put me in your fist and mold me, like you tried to mold Grant. No, no; I won\u0027t be molded. I suppose I can\u0027t stay here much longer, can Ii\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll find you wherever you go.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027ve done pretty well up until now.\" She looked at her mother, and saw she was afraid. It made her feel both elated and very sad. \"I\u0027ll take one of your rings.\"\\n\\n \"Whati\"\\n\\n \"One of your rings. I want the one with the two diamonds side by side.\"\\n\\n Natalie shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know what you -\"\\n\\n \"Take off that ring and put it on the table,\" Mary said; her voice had changed. It was a soldier\u0027s voice again, all daughterly pretense gone. \"Do it right now.\"\\n\\n Natalie looked at the ring Mary meant. It was worth seven thousand dollars, and had been given to her as a birthday gift by Edgar in 1965. \"No,\" she said. \u0027Wo. I won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t take it off, I\u0027ll do it for you.\"\\n\\n Natalie\u0027s chin lifted, like the prow of a battleship. \"all right, come ahead.\",\\n\\n Mary moved fast; she held Drummer in the crook of her left arm and was upon Natalie before she could back away. Mary\u0027s hand grasped her mother\u0027s. There was a fierce pull, some pain as skin was torn and the finger was almost wrenched from its socket, and the ring was gone.\\n\\n \"Damn you to hell,\" Natalie rasped, and she lifted her right hand and slapped Mary Terror across the face.\\n\\n Mary smiled, a handprint splayed across her cheek. \"I love you, too, Mother,\" she said, and she put the ring with its double diamonds into her pocket. \"Would you hold my babyi\" She gave Drummer to Natalie, and then she walked purposefully into the den and yanked the telephone from its wall socket. She flung the telephone against the wall and smashed it to pieces as Natalie stood with tears in her eyes and the baby in her arms. Mary offered her mother another smile as she passed her on the way out the front door. She drew her pistol, put the first bullet through the Cadillac\u0027s left front tire and the second bullet through the right rear tire. She returned to the house, bringing with her a whiff of gunsmoke. When they\u0027d walked down to the boathouse to get the formula, Mary had made her mother stand far enough away so Natalie couldn\u0027t tell she was in a van, not a \"car,\" what make it was or what color. That was for the best; when her mother got back to civilization, she would sing like a little teakettle to the pigs. Mary took Drummer back from Natalie\u0027s trembling hands, her mother\u0027s face drawn and pallid. \"Will you stay in the house, or do I have to take your shoesi\"\\n\\n \"What would you doi Tear them off my feeti\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Mary said, and her mother believed her. Natalie sat down in a chair in the den and listened to the squeal of air leaving the Cadillac\u0027s tires. Mary squeezed the last drink of formula into the baby\u0027s mouth, then she held him against her shoulder and patted his back, trying to draw forth a burp.\\n\\n \"Lower,\" Natalie said quietly. Mary moved her hand and kept patting. In a few seconds Drummer did his thing. He yawned in the folds of his blanket, getting sleepy again.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t try to walk to the ranger\u0027s station in the dark,\" Mary advised. \"You could break an ankle. I\u0027d wait until the sun comes up.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you for your concern.\"\\n\\n Mary rocked Drummer, a motion as soothing to her as it was to the infant. \"Let\u0027s don\u0027t say good-bye as enemies. Okayi\"\\n\\n \"Everyone\u0027s your enemy,\" Natalie told her. \"You hate everything and everybody, don\u0027t youi\"\\n\\n \"I hate what tries to kill me, body or spirit.\" She paused, thinking of something else to say though it was time to get going. \"Thanks for helping me with Drummer. Sorry I had to take the ring, but I\u0027m going to need some money.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Guns and bullets are expensive, aren\u0027t theyi\"\\n\\n \"So is gas. It\u0027s a long way to Canada.\" There\u0027s a morsel to feed the pigs, she thought. Maybe they wouldn\u0027t be so hard on her. \"Tell Father I asked about him, will youi\" She started to turn away, to go out through the back door the same way she\u0027d entered the house, using the key that always remained hidden on the doorjamb\u0027s ledge. She hesitated. One more thing to say. \"You can be proud of me for this, Mother: I never gave up what I believed in. I never quit. That counts for something, doesn\u0027t iti\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll make a fine epitaph on your gravestone,\" Natalie said.\\n\\n \"Good-bye, Mother.\"\\n\\n Natalie heard the creak of the back door opening. The thunk of its closing. She stayed where she was, her hands folded in her lap as if awaiting the soup course at a formal dinner. Perhaps five minutes slipped past. and then a sob broke in the woman\u0027s throat, and she lowered her face and began to cry. The tears fell from her cheeks onto her hands, where they glittered like false diamonds.\\n\\n Mary Terror, behind the van\u0027s wheel with Drummer swaddled and warm on the floorboard, saw the last of the house\u0027s light in her rearview mirror before the skeletal trees got in the way. She felt weakened; her mother had always had the knack of draining her. Didn\u0027t matter. Nothing mattered but being at the weeping lady at two o\u0027clock on the afternoon of the eighteenth, and giving Drummer to his new father. She could imagine the radiance of Lord Jack\u0027s smile.\\n\\n Today was Monday, the fifth. She had thirteen days. Time enough to find a cheap motel off the highway, lay low for a while and make some changes. Have to smell the wind and be sure the pigs weren\u0027t near. Have to disappear for a while, and let the heat drift past. She said to the sleeping Drummer, \"Mama loves you. Mama loves her sweet, sweet baby. You\u0027re mine now, did you know thati Yes you are. Mine forever and always.\"\\n\\n Mary smiled, her face daubed green by the dashboard glow. The van made a rocking motion, almost like a cradle. Mother and baby were at peace, for now.\\n\\n The van sped on, its tires tracking across the dark land. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-19.html","bookId":2480,"book":{"id":2480,"title":"Mine","description":"Storyline: Adrift in the 1980s and slowly losing her mind, a heavily armed former \u002760s radical kidnaps a baby with the hope, deluded as it may be, of returning her life to simpler times.
