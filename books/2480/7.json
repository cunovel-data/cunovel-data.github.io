It had been a long time since she had run, and her legs weren\u0027t used to the effort. It angered her that she\u0027d let herself get so out of shape; it was a weakness of the mind, a failure of willpower. as she ran through the sun-dappled Georgia forest about three miles from her apartment, she held the Colt.38 in her right hand, her index finger curled around the trigger guard. Sweat was on her face, her lungs beginning to labor though she\u0027d barely gone a third of a mile at an easy pace. The ravines and hillocks were rough on her knees, but she was in training and she gritted her teeth and took the pain like an old lover.\n It was just before two o\u0027clock on Sunday afternoon, four days after she\u0027d found the message in the Rolling Stone. Her pickup truck was parked at the end of an old logging road; she knew these woods, and often came here to practice her shooting. It had come upon her to run, to work up a sweat and make the hinges of her lungs wheeze, because the road to the weeping lady lay ahead. She knew the dangers of that road, knew that she was vulnerable out on the open byways of the Mindfuck State, where pigs of every description cruised for a killing. To reach her destination, she would have to be tough and smart, and she\u0027d lived too long as Ginger Coles in a redneck cocoon for the preparations to be easy. Her body wanted to rest, but she pushed herself onward. as she went up a hill she caught sight of the highway to atlanta in the distance, the sunlight sparking off the glass and metal of speeding cars; then she was going down again, through a pine tree thicket where shadows carpeted the earth, the breath burning in her lungs and her face full of heat. Faster! she urged herself. Faster! Her legs remembered the thrill of speed at a high school track meet, when she\u0027d strained past the other runners toward the tape. Faster! Faster! She ran along the bottom of a wooded ravine, pushing herself to go all out, and that was when her left foot hit a snag and she went down on her belly in the dead leaves and kudzu. The wind whooshed out of her and her chin scraped along the ground, and she lay there puffing and listening to a squirrel chatter angrily in a nearby tree.\n \"Shit,\" Mary said. She sat up, rubbed her chin, found scraped skin but no blood. When she tried to stand, her legs didn\u0027t want to. She sat there for a moment, breathing hard, dark motes spinning before her eyes in the cold, slanting sunlight. Falls were part of the training, she knew. Falls were cosmic teachers. That\u0027s what Lord Jack used to say. When you knew how to fall, you truly knew how to stand. She lay on the ground, catching her breath and remembering the commando training. The Storm Front\u0027s headquarters had been hidden in woods like these, only you could smell the sea in the eastern winds. Lord Jack had been a hard taskmaster: sometimes he awakened them with whispers at four o\u0027clock in the morning, other times with gunshots at midnight. Then he would run the soldiers through the obstacle course, keeping time with a stopwatch and shouting a melange of encouragement and threats. Mary recalled the wargames, when two teams hunted each other in the woods armed with pistols that fired paint pellets. Sometimes the hunt was one-against-one, and those were the trials she\u0027d enjoyed the most; she had never been tagged in all the dozens of hunts Lord Jack had put her into. She had enjoyed turning back on her adversary, coming around in a silent, stalking circle, and delivering the blow that finished the game. No one had ever beaten her at the hunt. No one.\n Mary forced herself up. The pain in her bones reminded her that she was no longer a young firebrand, but low coals burned longer. She began running again, with long, steady strides. Her thighs and calves were aching, but she closed her mind to the pain. Make friends with agony, Lord Jack had said. Embrace it, kiss it, stroke it. Love the pain, and you win the game. She ran with the pistol held at her side, and she saw a squirrel dart from the brush and scramble toward an oak tree to her right. She stopped, skidding in a flurry of leaves, slowing the squirrel down into strobelike motions with the force of her concentration. The squirrel was going up the treetrunk, now leaping for a higher branch.\n Mary lifted the pistol in a two-handed grip, took aim, and squeezed the trigger.\n The crack of the shot and the explosion of the squirrel\u0027s head were almost simultaneous. The body fell into the leaves, writhed for a few seconds, and lay still.\n She ran on, the sweet tang of gunpowder in her nostrils and the pistol warm in her hand.\n Her eyes searched the shadowed woods. Pig on the left! she thought, and she checked her progress and whirled in a crouch with her gun ready, aiming at a scraggly pine. She ran again, over a hillock and down. Pig on the right! She threw herself to the ground, raising dust, and as she slid on her stomach she took aim at another tree and fired a shot that clipped a top branch and sent a bluejay shrieking into the sky. Then up again - quick, quick! - and onward, her tennis shoes gouging the ground. another squirrel, drowsing in the sun, came to life and fled across her path; she tracked it, heading toward a group of pines. It was a fast one, desperate with fear. She fired at it as it clambered up a treetrunk, missed by a few inches to the left, but hit the squirrel in the spine with the second bullet. She heard it squeak as she passed on, a signature of blood across the treebark.\n Pig to the right! She crouched again, taking aim at an imaginary enemy. Off in the forest, crows called to each other. She smelled woodsmoke as she ran again, and she figured houses must be near. She entered a tangle of thicket, the sweat trickling down the back of her neck and dead leaves snagged in her hair. as she fought through the growth, battering it aside with her forearms, she thought of Jack urging her on with his stopwatch and whistle. He had written the message from the underground; of that she had no doubt. He was calling the Storm Fronters together again, after all these years. Calling for her, his true love. There had to be a purpose behind his summons. The Mindfuck State was still full of pigs, and all the Revolution had done was make them meaner. If the Storm Front could rise up again, with Lord Jack holding its red banner, she would be the happiest woman on earth. She had been born to fight the pigs, to grind them down under her boots and blow their shitty brains out. That was her life; that was reality. When she got back to Lord Jack and the Storm Front was on the move again, the pigs would tremble at the name of Mary Terror.\n She burst through the foliage, her face raked by thorns. Pig to the left! she thought, and she dove for the ground. She hit the clayey dirt on her shoulder, rolled through weeds, and contorted her body to the left, lifting the pistol to take aim at -\n He was standing maybe fifteen yards away, in a splash of sunlight. He wore bluejeans with patched knees and a camouflage-print windbreaker, and on his head was a dark blue woolen cap. His eyes were large and round, and in his arms he held a small, boy-sized rifle.\n Mary Terror lay where she was, the gun aimed in the boy\u0027s direction. Time stretched, breaking only when the boy opened his mouth.\n \"You okay, ladyi\"\n \"I fell,\" she said, trying to assemble her wits.\n \"Yeah, I saw. You okayi\"\n Mary glanced around. Was the boy alonei No one else in sight. She said, \"Who you out here withi\"\n \"Just me. My house is over that way.\" He motioned with a turning of his head, but the boy\u0027s home was about a half-mile away, over a hill and out of sight.\n Mary stood up. She saw the boy\u0027s eyes fix on the revolver in her hand. He was about nine or ten, she decided; his face was ruddy, the cheeks chill-burned. The rifle he held was a.22, and it had a small telescopic sight. \"I\u0027m all right,\" she told him. again her gaze searched the woods. Birds sang, cars droned on the distant highway, and Mary Terror was alone with the boy. \"I tripped,\" she said. \"Stupid, huhi\"\n \"You \u0027bout scared the life outta me, comin\u0027 through there and all.\"\n \"Sorry. Didn\u0027t mean to.\" She lifted her head slightly and sniffed the woodsmoke. Maybe a fire in the hearth at the kid\u0027s house, she thought.\n \"What\u0027re you doin\u0027 out herei Kinda far from the road.\" He kept his rifle pointed at the ground. The first thing his father had told him: never point a gun at a person unless you\u0027re gonna use it.\n \"Just hiking.\" She saw him look at the pistol again. \"Target shooting, too.\"\n \"I heard some shots. That was you, I reckon.\"\n \"That was me.\"\n \"I\u0027m squirrel-huntin\u0027,\" the boy said, and he offered a gap-toothed grin. \"I got me this here new rifle for my birthday. Seei\"\n She had never run into anyone out here before. She didn\u0027t like this, didn\u0027t like it at all. a boy alone with a squirrel rifle. She didn\u0027t like it. \"How come no one\u0027s with youi\" she asked.\n \"My daddy had to go in to work. He said if I was careful I could come on out by myself, but I wasn\u0027t to go too far from the house.\"\n Her mouth was dry. She was still breathing hard, but the sweat was drying on her face. She didn\u0027t like this; she could imagine this boy going home and saying to his parents I saw a woman in the woods today. She had a pistol and she said she was out hikin\u0027. She was a big, tall woman, and I can draw you a picture of what she looked like.\n \"Is your daddy a policemani\" Mary asked.\n \"No, ma\u0027am. He builds houses.\"\n She asked if you were a policeman, Daddy, she could imagine the boy saying. I can remember what she looked like. Wonder why she asked if you were a policeman, Daddyi\n \"What\u0027s your namei\" she asked him.\n \"Cory Peterson. My birthday was yesterday. See, I got this rifle.\"\n \"I see.\" She watched the boy\u0027s gaze tick to her.38 once more. How come she had a pistol. Daddyi How come she was out there in the woods by herself and she don\u0027t even live around herei \"Cory,\" she said. She smiled at him. The sun was warm out here, but the shadows still trapped winter. \"My name is Mary,\" she told him, and just that quick she decided it had to be done.\n \"Pleased to meet ya. Well, I guess I\u0027d best be gettin\u0027 on now. I said I wouldn\u0027t be gone too long.\"\n \"Coryi\" she said. He hesitated. \"Can I have a closer look at your riflei\"\n \"Yes ma\u0027am.\" He began walking toward her, his boots crunching on dead leaves.\n She watched him approach. Her heart was beating hard, but she was calm. The boy might decide to follow her if she let him go; he might follow her all the way to her truck, and he might remember her license number. He might be a lot smarter than he looked, and his father might know someone who was a policeman. She was going to be leaving soon, after she\u0027d gotten everything prepared, and she would worry about this boy if she didn\u0027t tie up the loose ends. Daddy, I saw this woman in the woods and she had a pistol and her name was Mary. No, no; that could screw up everything.\n When Cory got to her, Mary reached out and grasped the rifle\u0027s barrel. \"Can I hold iti\" she asked, and he nodded and gave it up. The rifle hardly had any weight at all, but she was interested in the telescopic sight. Having it might save her some money if she ever bought a long-range rifle. \"Real nice,\" she said. She kept her smile on, no trace of frost or tension around the edges. \"Hey, you know whati\"\n \"Whati\"\n \"I saw a place where a lot of squirrels are. Back that way.\" She nodded toward the thicket she\u0027d broken through. \"It isn\u0027t too far, if you want to see it.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Cory looked back in the direction of his house, then up into her face again. \"I figger I\u0027d better be gettin\u0027 on home.\"\n \"Really, it\u0027s not far. Won\u0027t take but just a few minutes to show you.\" She was thinking of the ravine where dead leaves and kudzu covered the bottom.\n \"Naw. Thanks anyway. Can I have my rifle back now, pleasei\"\n \"Going to make it hard on me, huhi\" she asked, and she felt her smile slip.\n \"Ma\u0027ami\" The boy blinked, his dark brown eyes puzzled.\n \"I don\u0027t mind,\" Mary said. She lifted her Colt and placed the barrel squarely in the middle of Cory Peterson\u0027s forehead.\n He gasped.\n She pulled the trigger, and with the crack of the shot the boy\u0027s head was flung backward. His mouth was open, showing little silver fillings in his teeth. His body went back, following the shock to his neck. He stumbled backward a few steps, the hole in the center of his forehead running crimson and his brains scattered on the ground behind him. His eyelids fluttered, and his face looked to Mary as if the boy were about to sneeze. He made a strangled little squeak, squirrel like, and then he fell on his back amid the detritus of winter. His legs trembled a few times, as if he were trying to stand up again. He died with his eyes and mouth open and the sun on his face. Mary stood over him until his lungs had stopped hitching. There was no use trying to drag the body away to hide it. She swept her gaze back and forth through the woods, her senses questing for sound and movement. The gunshot had scared the birds away, and the only noises were her heartbeat and blood trickling in the leaves. Satisfied that no one else was anywhere around, she turned away from the corpse and pushed back through the thicket again. Once clear of it, she began running in the direction she\u0027d come, the.38 in one hand and the boy-sized rifle clenched in the other.\n Her sweat turned cold. What she had just done fell upon her, and it made her stagger. But she regained her balance, her mouth grim-lipped and her eyes fixed toward the distant horizon. It had been his bad karma to cross her path, she thought. It had not been her fault that the boy was there; it was just karma, that\u0027s all. The boy was a minor piece of a larger picture, and that was what she had to focus on. His daddy might have wondered why a woman was stalking in the woods with a pistol on a Sunday afternoon. His daddy might have known a pig, or even a federal pig. One telephone call could start the pig machinery, and she\u0027d hidden too long and been too smart to allow that to happen. The boy had to be laid low. Period.\n a little whirlpool of anger had opened within her. Damn it! she raged. Shit! Why had that damned boy been therei It was a test, she thought. a karmic test. You fall down, and you stand up again. You keep going no matter what. She wished it were springtime, and that there were flowers in the woods. If there were flowers in the woods, she would\u0027ve put one in the dead boy\u0027s hand.\n She knew why she had killed him. Of course she did. The boy had seen Mary Terror without her mask. That was reason enough for execution.\n She couldn\u0027t make it on the run all the way back to her truck. She walked the last three hundred yards, her lungs rasping and her sweatsuit soaked. She leaned the rifle against the seat and put the handgun on the floorboard beneath her legs. There were the marks of other tires in the dirt, so she didn\u0027t have to worry about brushing out the tracks. The pigs might get a footprint or two, but so whati They\u0027d think it was a man\u0027s footprints. She started the engine, backed off the logging road to the paved highway where a sign said NO DUMPING and litter was everywhere. Then Mary drove home, knowing she had a lot of training to do but confident that she had not lost her touch. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-7.html","bookId":2480,"book":{"id":2480,"title":"Mine","description":"Storyline: \n Adrift in the 1980s and slowly losing her mind, a heavily armed former \u002760s radical kidnaps a baby with the hope, deluded as it may be, of returning her life to simpler times.
