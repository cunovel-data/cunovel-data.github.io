{"id":83787,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"On the fourteenth day of February, two things happened: a TWa jet carrying two hundred and forty-six people exploded in the air above Tokyo, Japan, and a deranged man with an aK-47 assault rifle opened fire in a shopping mall in La Crosse, Wisconsin, killing three people and wounding five others before he took refuge in a J.C. Penney\u0027s. Both these news items together drove the last nails into the flagging Mary Terror drama, dooming it to that part of the newscasts and papers known as \"the coffin corner\": dead items. The fifteenth dawned. Laura Clayborne awakened sometime around ten, after another restless night. She lay in bed for a while, getting her bearings; sometimes she thought she was awake when she was still dreaming. The sleeping pills tended to do it. Everything was confused and uncertain, an entanglement of reality and delusion. She gathered her strength to face another day, a monumental effort, and she got out of bed and peered through the blinds. The sun was shining, the sky was blue. It was windy outside, and it looked very cold. There were, of course, no more reporters. The reporters had trickled away, day after day. The press conferences held by the FBI - which were really only attempts to keep the story newsworthy - had ceased luring the reporters in. The press conferences had stopped. There was never any news. Mary Terror had vanished, and with her had vanished David. Laura went to the bathroom. She didn\u0027t look at her face in the mirror because she knew it would be a terrible sight. She felt as if she\u0027d aged ten years in the twelve days since David had been stolen. Her joints throbbed like an old woman\u0027s, and she constantly had headaches. Stress, the doctor had told her. Perfectly understandable in this situation. See this pink pilli Take half of one twice a day and call me if you need me. Laura splashed cold water into her face. Her eyelids were swollen, her body bloated and sluggish. She felt warm wetness between her thighs, and she touched down there. Watery reddish fluid on her fingertips. The stitches had pulled loose again; nothing would hold her together anymore since her baby was gone. It was the weight of not knowing that was killing her. Was David deadi Murdered and thrown into the weeds by the roadsidei Had she sold him on the black market for cashi Was she planning to use him in some kind of cultish ritei all those questions had been pondered by Neil Kastle and the FBI, but there were no answers. Sometimes the urge to cry suddenly overwhelmed her, and she was forced back to bed. She sensed it coming now, growing stronger. She gripped the sink, her head bent forward. an image of David\u0027s body lying in the weeds swept through her mind. \"No!\" she said as the first tears burned her eyes. \"No, damn it, no!\" She rode it out, her body trembling and her teeth clenched so hard her jaws ached. The storm of unbearable sadness passed, but it stayed flickering and rumbling on the horizon. Laura left the bathroom, walked through the untidy bedroom, through the den and to the kitchen. Her bare feet were cold on the floor. Her first stop, as usual, was the answering machine. No messages. She opened the refrigerator and drank orange juice straight from the carton. She took the array of vitamins the doctor had suggested for her, swallowing one after another the pills that might have choked a horse. Then she stood in the middle of the kitchen, blinking in the sunlight and trying to decide if she should have raisin bran or oatmeal. First, call Kastle. She did. His secretary, who\u0027d initially been sweetness and Georgia peaches but was now more crisp and lemony at Laura\u0027s sometimes-dozen calls a day, said Kastle was out of the office and wouldn\u0027t be back until after three. No, there was no progress. Yes, you\u0027ll be the first to know. Laura hung up. Raisin bran or oatmeali It seemed a very difficult decision. She had Wheat Chex. She ate standing up, and she spilled some milk on the floor and almost cried again, but she remembered the old saying so she let it go. She wiped the drops of milk away with her foot. Her parents had gone home the previous morning. It was the beginning, Laura knew, of a cold war between her and her mother. Doug\u0027s mother had returned to Orlando two days previously. Doug had started back to work. Somebody\u0027s got to make some money, he\u0027d told her. anyway, there\u0027s no use just sitting around here waiting, is therei Doug had said something the night before that had sent Laura into a rage. He\u0027d looked at her, the Wall Street Journal on the sofa beside him, and he\u0027d said, \"If David\u0027s dead, it won\u0027t be the end of the world.\" That remark had sliced through her heart like a burning blade. \"Do you think he\u0027s deadi\" she\u0027d asked him savagely. \"Is that what you thinki\" \"I\u0027m not saying he\u0027s dead. I\u0027m just saying that life goes on no matter what happens.\" \"My God. My God.\" Laura\u0027s hand had gone to her mouth, her stomach roiling with horror. \"You do think he\u0027s dead, don\u0027t youi Oh Jesus, you do!\" Doug had stared at her with heavy-lidded eyes, and Laura had seen the truth in them. The subsequent storm had driven Doug out of the house, racing away in his Mercedes. Laura had called C. Jannsen\u0027s number. When a woman had answered, Laura had said bitterly, \"He\u0027s on his way. You can have him, and I hope you enjoy what you get.\" She\u0027d hung up, but not with a slam as she\u0027d first intended. Doug wasn\u0027t worth the effort. Sometime before midnight she\u0027d found herself sitting on the bed, cutting apart their wedding pictures with scissors. It came to her, as she\u0027d sat with the shards of memories in her lap, that she was in real danger of losing her mind. Then she\u0027d put all the pieces into a little pile atop the dresser and she\u0027d taken two sleeping pills and searched for rest. What to doi What to doi She wasn\u0027t ready for work yet. She could imagine herself trying to cover a social function and collapsing in the foie gras. She put on the coffeepot, and she wandered around the kitchen straightening things that were already straight. as she passed near the telephone, she thought of calling Neil Kastle again. Maybe there would be some news. She picked up the phone, put it down, picked, it up once more, finally left it in a helter-skelter of indecision. Straighten up in the den, she thought. Yes, it needed straightening. Laura walked in and spent a few minutes going through magazines in the basket where they collected. She chose issues that were two or three months old and stacked them up for the trash. No, no; this one couldn\u0027t go. It had an article about breastfeeding in it. This one couldn\u0027t go, either, it had an article about how babies responded to music. She drifted away from the magazines to the bookshelves, and began to line the volumes up so that their spines were exactly even. The larger-sized books gave her a fit of consternation. and then she came to a volume that made her hand stop its relentless arranging. Its title was Burn This Book. Laura took the book down. Mark Treggs, the holdover hippie. No author\u0027s photo. Mountain top Press, Chattanooga, Tennessee. a post office box. She skimmed through the book, searching for the part where Treggs had talked about the Weather Underground and the Storm Front. On page 72, she found it: \"The Love Generation, bleeding from a thousand wounds inflicted by the militant counterculture, may well have expired on the night of July 1, 1972, when police in Linden, New Jersey, cornered the terrorist Storm Fronters in a suburban tract house. Four Storm Fronters died in the firefight, one was captured alive but wounded, and four more escaped, including their main man \u0027Lord Jack\u0027 Gardiner. The pigs searched, but they could not find. Some say Canada, that saint of america\u0027s political fugitives, took them into her forests. You can hear it still today if you put your ear to the right track: the Storm Front\u0027s out there somewhere. Maybe still licking their wounds, like old bears in a cave. Maybe muttering and dreaming, aging longhairs huddled over candles with their stashes of pot and acid. I knew one of the Storm Fronters, a long time ago before the flames destroyed the flowers. She was a nice kid from Cedar Falls, Iowa. a farmer\u0027s daughter, can you dig iti To her I send a message: keep the faith, and love the one you\u0027re with.\" Laura\u0027s gaze flickered back up the page. I knew one of the Storm Fronters. Not Mary Terrell. She was born in Richmond. Who, theni Somebody who might help the FBI find her babyi Laura took the book to the telephone. She dialed Kastle\u0027s number in such a hurry that she messed up and had to redial. His secretary, the lemony bitch, answered after the second ring. No, Mrs. Clayborne, Mr. Kastle isn\u0027t in yet. I told you before, he won\u0027t be back until after three. No, I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t have a number where he can be reached. Mrs. Clayborne, it\u0027s not doing anybody any good for you to keep calling. I\u0027m terribly sorry about your situation, but everything possible is being done to find your - Bullshit. Laura hung up. She paced the kitchen, her heart pounding. Whom could she tell about thisi Who could help heri She stopped at the telephone again, and this time she dialed Directory assistance in Chattanooga. The operator had no number for Mountaintop Press. There were two Treggses: Phillip and M.K. She scribbled down the latter number and called it, her stomach doing slow flip-flops. Four rings. \"Helloi\" a woman\u0027s voice. \"Mark Treggs, pleasei\" \"Mark\u0027s at work. Can I take a messagei\" Laura swallowed, her throat dry. \"Is this... the Mark Treggs who wrote the booki\" a pause. Then, cautiously: \"Yes.\" Thank God! she thought. Her hand was clenched around the receiver. \"are you his wifei\" \"Who is this, pleasei\" \"My name is Laura Clayborne. I\u0027m calling from atlanta. Is there a number where I can reach Mr. Treggsi\" another pause. \"No, I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Please!\" It came out too fast, too charged with emotion. \"I\u0027ve got to talk to him! Please tell me how I can find him!\" \"There\u0027s no number,\" the woman said. \"Laura Clayborne. I think I know that name. are you a friend of Mark\u0027si\" \"I\u0027ve never met him, but it\u0027s vitally important that I reach him. Please! Can\u0027t you help mei\" \"He\u0027ll be home after five. Can I give him a messagei\" Five o\u0027clock seemed an eternity. In frustration, Laura said, \"Thank you so much!\" and this time she did slam the receiver down. She stood for a moment with her hands pressed against her face, trying to decide what to do. The image of David in the weeds came to her again, and she shook it off before it latched in her mind. Chattanooga was about a two-hour drive from atlanta, northwest along I-75. Laura looked at the clock. If she left now, she could be there around one. I knew one of the Storm Fronters. Treggs might know more about the Storm Front than he\u0027d written in the book. a two-hour drive. She could make it in an hour and forty-five minutes. Laura went into the bedroom, put on a pair of bluejeans that fit snugly around the puffiness she was still carrying, and she shrugged into a white blouse and a beige cable-knit sweater. It occurred to her that she might have to stay in Chattanooga overnight. She began to pack a suitcase, another pair of jeans and a crimson sweater, extra underwear and socks. She loaded up her toothpaste and toothbrush, decided to take her shampoo and her hair dryer. Money, she thought. Have to go by the bank and get a check cashed. Got my Visa, MasterCard, and american Express. Have to get the BMW\u0027s tank filled. Leave a note for Doug; no, forget that. Get the tires checked, too. It wouldn\u0027t be good to have a blowout, a woman alone in this hard old world. She knew now that violence could strike from any direction, without warning, and leave tragedy in its wake. She walked to the dresser, opened the top drawer, and lifted up Doug\u0027s sweaters. She took the automatic pistol out, along with a box of ammunition. The shooting lessons be damned; if she had to use it, she\u0027d learn fast. Laura gave her hair a quick brushing. She forced herself to look at her face in the mirror. Her eyes had a glassy shine: either excitement or insanity, she couldn\u0027t decide which. But one thing she knew for sure: waiting in this house, day after day, for word about her baby would surely drive her over the edge. Mark Treggs might not know anything about the Storm Front. He might not have any information at all that could help her. But she was going to Chattanooga to find him, and nothing on earth was going to stop her. She put on her black Reeboks, then deposited the automatic pistol and the box of ammunition in her suitcase, along with her hairbrush. The pile of cut-up photographs caught her attention. She swept them into a trash can with the edge of her hand. Then she picked up her suitcase, got her tan overcoat, and walked into the garage. The BMW\u0027s engine started, a throaty growl. Laura drove away from the house on Moore\u0027s Mill Road, and she did not look back.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-20.html","bookId":2480,"book":{"id":2480,"title":"Mine","description":"Storyline: Adrift in the 1980s and slowly losing her mind, a heavily armed former \u002760s radical kidnaps a baby with the hope, deluded as it may be, of returning her life to simpler times.
