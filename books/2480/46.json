{"id":83813,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"Under the blue morning sky, an alarm was shrieking in Freestone.\\n\\n Laura followed the noise. She turned the Cutlass onto a street named Meacham, and found a green and gray police car parked in front of a brick building whose sign brought a gasp from her. a garbage truck was nearby, two men talking to a policeman. One of them pointed along Meacham, in the opposite direction. There were a few other onlookers: a trim elderly couple in sweatsuits, a teenaged girl wearing an MTV jacket, and a young man who wore a Day-Glo orange jersey and skin-tight black bicyclist shorts, his bike leaning on its kickstand as he talked to the girl. Laura could see that the front door of Dean Walker\u0027s foreign car dealership had been shattered, and a second policeman was walking around inside.\\n\\n Laura stopped the car across the street, got out, and walked to the group of bystanders. \"What\u0027s going oni\" she asked the young man, the alarm echoing across town.\\n\\n \"Somebody broke in,\" he answered. \"Just happened about ten minutes ago.\"\\n\\n She nodded, and then she drew the piece of Liberty Motor Lodge notepad paper from her pocket. \"Do you know where I can find these meni\" She showed him the three names, and the teenage girl looked too.\\n\\n \"This is Mr. Walker\u0027s place,\" the young man reminded her.\\n\\n \"I know that. Can you tell me where he livesi\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got the biggest house on Nautica Point,\" the girl said, and she pushed her long, lank hair away from her face. \"That\u0027s where.\"\\n\\n \"What about the other twoi\"\\n\\n \"I know Keith. He lives on Muir Road.\" The young man pointed toward the northwest. \"It\u0027s over that way, maybe five miles.\"\\n\\n \"addresses,\" Laura urged. \"Do you know the addressesi\"\\n\\n They shook their heads. The elderly couple were looking at her, so she moved to them. \"I\u0027m trying to find these three men!\" she told them. \"Can you help mei\"\\n\\n The man peered at the list, looked at her bandaged hand and then into her face. \"and who might you bei\"\\n\\n \"My name\u0027s Laura Clayborne. Please... it\u0027s very important that I find these men.\"\\n\\n \"Is that soi Whyi\"\\n\\n She was about to burst into tears. \"Would you at least tell me how to get to Muir Road and Nautica Pointi\"\\n\\n \"are you from around herei\" the man inquired.\\n\\n \"Tommy doesn\u0027t know how to be nice to strangers!\" the elderly woman spoke up. \"Dear, Muir Road\u0027s off Overhill. The second street that way is Overhill.\" She jabbed a finger toward it. \"Turn left and keep going about three miles. Muir Road goes off to the right, you can\u0027t miss it.\" The alarm suddenly ceased, dogs barking in its wake. \"Nautica Point is back the other way, off McGill. Turn right at the caution light and you go eight or nine miles.\" She grasped Laura\u0027s hand and angled it so she could look at the piece of paper. \"Oh, Nick\u0027s a town councilman! He lives on Overhill. It\u0027s a house with a birdbath in front.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Laura said. \"Thank you so much!\" She turned away and ran to the Cutlass, and she heard the elderly man say, \"Why didn\u0027t you just tell her where we live so she can go rob us, tooi\"\\n\\n Laura backed up to Parkway and drove toward Overbid. Nick Dudley\u0027s house seemed to be the nearest. She picked up speed, looking for a dark blue Jeep wagon, the automatic pistol on the floorboard under her seat\\n\\n Keith Cavanaugh\u0027s mouth worked. Nothing came out\\n\\n Mary Terror could find no words either. The baby gurgled happily.\\n\\n Shock settled between them like a purple haze.\\n\\n The man who stood before Mary did not wear white robes. He was dressed in a plaid shirt with a button-down collar, a charcoal gray sweater with a little red polo player on the breast, and khaki pants. On his feet were scuffed loafers instead of Birkenstocks. His hair was more gray than golden, and it didn\u0027t flow down to his shoulders. There wasn\u0027t enough of it to cover his scalp. His face - ah, there was the treachery of time - was still Lord Jack\u0027s, but grown softer, shaved beardless, loose at the jowls. a padding of fat encircled his waist, a little mound of it bulging his sweater at the belly.\\n\\n But his eyes... those blue-crystal, cunning, beautiful eyes...\\n\\n Lord Jack was still behind them, deep in that man who called himself Keith Cavanaugh and made coats of arms in lustrous frames.\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" he whispered, his face bleached of blood.\\n\\n \"Jacki\"\u0027 Mary took a step forward. He retreated two. There were tears in her eyes, her flesh and soul fevered. \"I brought you...\" She lifted Drummer toward him, like a holy offering. \"I brought you our son.\"\\n\\n His back met the wall, his mouth opening in a stunned gasp.\\n\\n \"Take him,\" Mary said. \"Take him. He belongs to us now.\"\\n\\n The telephone rang. From downstairs, the woman who did not know her husband\u0027s true name called, \"Jenny, would you get thati\"\\n\\n \"Okay!\" the voice of a little girl replied. The phone stopped ringing. The noise of TV cartoons went on.\\n\\n \"Take him,\" Mary urged. Tears streaked down her cheeks, ruining her makeup.\\n\\n \"Daddy, it\u0027s Mrs. Hunter!\" the little girl said. \"She can\u0027t come until this afternoon!\"\\n\\n Three heartbeats passed. Then, from downstairs: \"Keithi\"\\n\\n \"Take him,\" Mary whispered. \"Take him. Take me, Jack. Please...\" a sob welled up like a groan, because she could see that her one true love, her savior, her reason for living and the man who had caressed her in her dreams and beckoned her across three thousand miles, had wet his pants. \"We\u0027re together now,\" she said. \"Like we used to be, only more groovy because we\u0027ve got Drummer. He\u0027s ours, Jack. I took him for us.\"\\n\\n He slid away from her, stumbled in his retreat, and almost went down. Mary limped after him, through the foyer and toward a hallway. \"I did it all for us, Jack. Seei I did it so we can be together like we used to -\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re crazy,\" he said, his voice strangled. \"Oh my God... you... stole that baby... for mei\"\\n\\n \"For you.\" Her heart was growing wings again. \"Because I love you sooooo much.\"\\n\\n \"No. No.\" He shook his head. Jack had seen the story on the newscasts and in the papers, had followed its progress until more important matters had pushed it from the lead position. He had seen all the old pictures of the Storm Front, all the faces young in their years and ancient in their passions. He had relived those days a thousand times, and now the past had come through his door carrying a kidnapped infant. \"Oh God, no! You were always dumb, Mary... but I didn\u0027t know you were out of your mind!\"\\n\\n always dumb, he\u0027d said. Out of your mind.\\n\\n \"I... did it all for us...\"\\n\\n \"GET aWaY FROM ME!\" he shouted. Red flared in his pudgy cheeks. \"GET aWaY FROM ME, GODDaMN YOU!\"\\n\\n Sandy Cavanaugh came through a doorway and stopped when she saw the big woman holding her baby out to Keith. He looked at her and yelled, \"Get out! Get Jenny and get out! She\u0027s crazy!\" a pretty girl maybe ten or eleven years old, her hair blond and her eyes bright blue, peered into the corridor next to her mother. \"Get out!\" Jack Gardiner shouted again, and the woman grabbed up their child and ran toward the back of the house.\\n\\n \"Jacki\" Mary Terror\u0027s voice had a broken sound, the tears streaming from her eyes and all but blinding her. You were always dumb, he\u0027d said. \"I love you.\"\\n\\n \"YOU CRaZY BITCH!\" Spittle spewed from his mouth and hit both her and Drummer in their faces. \"YOU\u0027RE RUINING EVERYTHING!\"\\n\\n \"Police!\" Mary heard the woman cry out on the telephone. \"Operator, get me the police!\"\\n\\n \"Take him,\" Mary urged. \"Please... take our baby.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all over!\" he shouted. \"It was a game! a play! I was so high on acid all the time I didn\u0027t even know what I was doing! We all were!\" Realization hit him, and rocked his head back. \"My God... you mean... you still believei\"\\n\\n \"My... life... was yours,\" Mary whispered. \"It is yours!\"\\n\\n \"Policei This is... this is... Sandy Cavanaugh! We\u0027ve got... somebody\u0027s in our house!\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want you!\" he said. \"I don\u0027t want that baby! That was a long time ago, and it\u0027s all over and gone!\"\\n\\n Mary stood very still. Drummer was crying, too. Jack pressed his back against the wall in front of her, his hands up as if to ward off something filthy.\\n\\n She saw him, in that awful moment.\\n\\n There had never been a Lord Jack. There had been only a puppet master, pulling heartstrings and triggers. Lord Jack had been a fiction; before her stood the real Jack Gardiner, a trembling, terrified bag of guts and blood. His power had always been a lie, a deft juggling of counterculture slogans, acid dreams, and war games. He had lost the faith because he had had no faith to lose. He had sewn the Storm Front together with deceitful hands, built towers of clay and painted them as stone, merged horses with lions, called them freedom fighters, and thrown them to the flames. He had created a coat of many arms whose purpose was to clothe himself in the threads of glory. and now he stood there in the uniform of the Mindfuck State, while Gary and akitta and Janette and CinCin and all the rest of the faithful were ghosts. He was allowing a woman who knew nothing of fire and torment to call the pigs. and Mary knew why. It crushed her soul, but she knew. He loved the woman and the child.\\n\\n Lord Jack was dead.\\n\\n Jack Gardiner was about to die.\\n\\n She would save him from the pigs as her last act of love.\\n\\n She held Drummer in the crook of one arm, and she drew the revolver from her shoulder bag and aimed it at point-blank range.\\n\\n Jack jammed himself into a corner. Next to him on the wall there was a framed coat of arms: a castle on a cloud, bordered by stags and swords. Beneath it was the name Cavanaugh.\\n\\n Mary gritted her teeth, her eyes dark with death. Jack made a whimpering sound, like a whipped dog.\\n\\n She pulled the trigger.\\n\\n The noise was terrible in the hallway. Sandy Cavanaugh screamed. Mary fired a second time. Then a third shot rang out, all the rich red love gushing from the punctured body as Jack lay crumpled and twitching. Mary pressed the barrel against his balding scalp and delivered a fourth bullet that burst his head open and flung brains all over the wall and her sweater. Blood and tissue flecked her cheeks and clung to the Smiley Face.\\n\\n Two bullets left. The woman and the child.\\n\\n She started after them, but paused in the doorway.\\n\\n Two bullets. For a woman and child. But not the ones who cowered and cried in that room. and not in this house where the pigs would leer and pick at the corpses like hunters with big-game trophies.\\n\\n as Mary limped to the front door, she passed God skulking in a corner. \"You know where,\" he said under his floppy-brimmed hat, and she answered, \"Yes.\"\\n\\n She left the house with Drummer, the two of them against the world. She got into the Cherokee and reached for her roadmap as she backed along the driveway in a storm of gravel.\\n\\n Her finger marked the route and the place. It wasn\u0027t far, maybe twenty miles along the coast road. She knew the way. She wondered if Jack had ever gone there, to sit and dream of yesterday.\\n\\n No, she decided. He never had.\\n\\n a police car, its lights flashing, passed her as she turned onto Overhill. It took the curve to Muir Road and kept going. She drove on, heading home.\\n\\n The door opened, and a white-haired man in a green robe with sailboats on it said, \"Yesi\" as if he resented the intrusion.\\n\\n \"Nick Hudleyi\" Laura asked, her nerves jangling.\\n\\n \"I am. Who are youi\"\\n\\n \"My name is Laura Clayborne.\" She searched his face. He was too old to be Jack Gardiner. No, this wasn\u0027t him. \"Have you seen a woman - a big woman, stands about six feet tall - with a babyi She might\u0027ve been driving a -\"\\n\\n \"Dark blue Cherokee,\" Hudley said. \"Yes, she came to the door but I didn\u0027t see a baby.\" His gaze took stock of her dirty clothes and her bandaged hand. \"She knew my name, too. What the hell\u0027s this all abouti\"\\n\\n \"How long ago was thati The woman. When was she herei\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t over fifteen minutes ago. She said she was trying to find Muir Road. Listen, I think you\u0027d better explain -\" He suddenly looked toward the street, and Laura turned in time to see a police car speed by, going west with its lights flashing but no siren.\\n\\n Muir Road was to the west, Laura realized.\\n\\n She turned away from Nick Hudley and ran to the Cutlass. She started the engine and left rubber on the pavement as she sped west along Overhill, looking for Muir Road. Somehow, Mary Terror was only fifteen minutes ahead of her instead of three or four hours. There was still hope of getting David back... still hope... still...\\n\\n a dark blue vehicle roared around a curve in front of Laura, hugging the center line, and Laura saw the face of the woman behind the wheel. at that same instant Mary Terror recognized Laura, and the Cherokee and the Cutlass slid past each other by no more than three inches.\\n\\n Laura fought the wheel with her hand and elbow, taking the car up onto somebody\u0027s lawn, skidding it around and back onto Overhill but now going east. She put her foot to the floorboard, the Cutlass coughing black smoke but gaining speed. The Cherokee was flying in front of her, and in another few seconds they passed Nick Hudley\u0027s house, the scream of engines scaring birds out of the birdbath.\\n\\n On the next curve the Cherokee went up over the curb and knocked a mailbox into the air. Laura got forty feet behind Mary and stayed there, determined not to lose her again. She didn\u0027t know if David was in the vehicle or not, or why the police car was on its way toward Muir Road, or if Jack Gardiner was in Freestone, or how Mary\u0027s lead had dwindled to forty feet, but she knew Mary Terror would not get away from her. Never. No matter how long it took, no matter where she went. Never.\\n\\n The Cherokee and the Cutlass swerved onto Parkway, roared under the caution light and past the WELCOME TO FREE. STONE sign. Mary\u0027s eyes ticked back and forth from the winding road to the car in her rearview mirror. The shock of seeing Laura had been only a further kink in the warp of Mary\u0027s mind. Everything was karma, after all. Yes, Mary had decided, it was karma, and karma could not be denied. Let the bitch come. Before Mary took the baby\u0027s life and her own, she would execute the bitch who had killed Edward and Bedelia.\\n\\n Mary\u0027s tears had stopped. Her face was a ruin of smeared makeup, her eyes bloodshot and deep-sunken. Her heart had reached its final evolution. It was empty now; there was nothing to dream on anymore. She was the last survivor of the Storm Front, and she would end it where it had begun.\\n\\n Six miles out of Freestone, she turned onto a country road that led west to the Pacific. Laura kept with her. The miles flashed past, the road deserted. Mary took a turn to the left, following the route on her map, and Laura stayed close. Mary smiled to herself and nodded. The baby was quiet, his hands grasping the air.\\n\\n The road wound through dense woods. a sign said POINT REYES RaNGER STaTION, 2 MI. But before a mile had passed, Mary whipped the Cherokee to the right onto another narrow dirt road. She put on speed, dust billowing back into the windshield of the Cutlass as Laura took the turn, too. \"Come on!\" Mary said, her voice a husky rattle. \"Follow me! Come on!\"\\n\\n Laura sped after the Cherokee, her tires bouncing and jubbling over potholes. after a mile or so there was no more dust, but the woods on either side of the road were cob-webbed with mist. Laura could smell the salt air of the Pacific leaching into the car. She followed Mary Terror around a curve, mist swirling between them, and suddenly she saw the taillights flare.\\n\\n Mary had just stomped on the brake. Laura wrenched the wheel to the right, her shoulder muscles shrieking. The Cutlass missed a collision, but went off the road into the pine woods. The tires plowed through a mossy bog, blue mist hanging between the trees. Laura\u0027s foot was on the brake, and the Cutlass grazed a treetrunk and stopped in swampy, rim-deep water.\\n\\n Laura picked up her pistol. Through the mist she could see the Cherokee sitting there, its taillights no longer flared. The driver\u0027s seat was empty. Laura opened the door and stepped out into a bog that claimed her to her ankles. The Cherokee\u0027s engine wasn\u0027t running. In the silence, Laura heard the thudding of her heart and the cries of sea gulls.\\n\\n Where was Maryi Was David still with her, or noti\\n\\n Laura crouched down, moving through the muddy water, and got a treetrunk between herself and the Cherokee. She was expecting a shot at any second. None came.\\n\\n \"I want my baby!\" she shouted. Her finger was poised on the trigger, her broken hand throbbing with renewed pain. \"Do you hear mei\"\\n\\n But Mary Terror didn\u0027t answer. She was too smart to give herself away so easily.\\n\\n Laura would have to move from where she was. She scurried behind another tree, closer to the Jeep wagon, and waited for a few seconds. Mary didn\u0027t show herself. Laura worked her way closer to the Cherokee, mist drifting around her and the sunlight gray through its canopy in the treetops. She gritted her teeth and ran to the vehicle\u0027s rear, where she hunkered down and listened.\\n\\n She could hear distant thunder.\\n\\n Waves, she realized in another moment. The Pacific, beating against rocks.\\n\\n The air was cool and wet, moisture dripping from the trees. Laura peered around the Cherokee\u0027s side. The driver\u0027s door was open. Mary was gone.\\n\\n Laura stood up, ready to crouch again if she saw movement. She looked into the wagon, saw the clutter of Mary\u0027s journey, the smell of sweat and urine and soiled diapers.\\n\\n Laura walked past the Cherokee, following the dirt road. She went at a slow, careful pace, her senses sharp for any hint of an ambush. The flesh rippled on the back of her neck, the smell of salt in her nostrils. The sound of thunder was getting louder.\\n\\n and then the woods fell away from both sides of the road, and a house stood before her overlooking the Pacific and its wave-gnawed rocks. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-46.html","bookId":2480,"book":{"id":2480,"title":"Mine","description":"Storyline: Adrift in the 1980s and slowly losing her mind, a heavily armed former \u002760s radical kidnaps a baby with the hope, deluded as it may be, of returning her life to simpler times.
