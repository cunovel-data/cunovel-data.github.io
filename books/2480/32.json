{"id":83799,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"Laura didn\u0027t. Her hand trembled, and so did the gun. David\u0027s face was blotching with red, his hands clawing at the air. \"He\u0027ll smother in a few seconds. Then I\u0027ll come at you, and you don\u0027t know shit about killing anybody.\" Rage thrashed within Laura. The woman\u0027s big hand was clenched tight over David\u0027s nostrils and mouth. Laura could see his eyes, wide with panic. Didi couldn\u0027t move, her own throat squeezed by Mary\u0027s other arm. Edward said, \"Wait a minute. Wait,\" but who he was babbling to wasn\u0027t clear. \"Finger off the trigger,\" Mary repeated, her voice eerily calm. \"Point the gun down.\" Laura had no choice. She obeyed. \"Take the gun, Edward.\" He hesitated. \"Edward!\" Mary\u0027s voice snapped out like a whip. \"Take the gun!\" He walked forward, grasped the automatic, and it was gone from Laura\u0027s hand. Their eyes met. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t know -\" \"Shut up, Edward.\" Mary removed her hand from the baby\u0027s face. His mouth gasped, and then a shriek welled up out of it that almost destroyed the last of Laura\u0027s sanity. \"Bring the gun to me,\" Mary said. \"Listen. We don\u0027t have to -\" \"BRING IT TO ME!\" \"Okay, okay!\" He delivered the pistol to Mary\u0027s hand, and she placed the barrel against Didi\u0027s red-haired skull and took the child away from her with one arm. The shrieking went on as Mary backed away from Didi and turned the gun on Laura. \"Who\u0027s with youi\" She almost said the police. No, no; Mary would kill David for sure. \"No one.\" \"Liar! are the pigs out therei\" \"Would I be in here if they werei\" Laura wasn\u0027t afraid anymore. Her fear had steamed away. There was no time to be scared, her mind occupied with trying to think of a way to get David. Mary said, \"Stand against the wall. Didi, you with her. Move, you bitch!\" Didi took her place beside Laura, her face downcast and tears on her cheeks. She was waiting for the execution bullet. Laura would not look away from Mary Terror. She stared at the woman, fixing the hard-jawed, brutal face forever in her mind. \"Edward, go to the house and get my bag and the bassinet. Take them to the van. We\u0027re clearing out.\" Edward did as he was told. The child continued to cry, but Mary\u0027s attention was riveted to the two women. \"Damn you to hell,\" she said to Didi. \"You betrayed me.\" \"Mary... please listen.\" Her voice was husky from the pressure of Mary\u0027s arm on her windpipe. \"Let the baby go. He doesn\u0027t belong to -\" \"He\u0027s mine! Mine and Jack\u0027s!\" Splotches of red surfaced on Mary\u0027s cheeks, her eyes aflame. \"I trusted you! You were my sister!\" \"I\u0027m not who I used to be. I want to help you, Mary. Please leave David here.\" \"HIS NaME IS DRUMMER!\" Mary shouted. The gun remained steady, aimed somewhere between Laura and Didi. \"His name is David,\" Laura said. \"David Clayborne. No matter what you call him, you know what his real name is.\" Mary suddenly grinned. It was a savage grin, and she stalked across the workshop and stopped with the automatic almost touching the tip of Laura\u0027s nose. It took everything Laura had not to reach for David, but she kept her arms at her sides and her gaze locked with Mary\u0027s. \"Brave,\" Mary said. \"Brave piece of shit. I\u0027m going to flush you. Flush you right down the dark hole. Think you\u0027ll like thati\" \"I think... you\u0027re nothing but a lie. You\u0027ve got a baby who\u0027s not yours. You\u0027re looking for a man who\u0027s forgotten about you.\" Laura saw Mary\u0027s hatred flare, like napalm bomb blasts. She kept going, deeper into the fire. \"You don\u0027t stand for anything, and you don\u0027t believe in anything. and the worst lie is the one you tell yourself, that when you take David to Jack Gardiner, you\u0027ll be young again.\" Mary could not stand Jack\u0027s name coming from this woman\u0027s mouth. In a blur of motion, she hit Laura across the face with the automatic\u0027s barrel. There was a crunching noise and Laura fell to her knees, her head throbbing with pain. Blood pattered to the floor from her nostrils, her nose almost broken. a blue-edged welt had appeared across her cheek. Laura made no sound, dark motes spinning before her eyes. \"Get her up,\" Mary told Didi. \"We\u0027ve got business to finish.\" Mary herded them out of the workshop, Laura staggering and Didi holding her up. Edward was waiting at the van. She gave him the automatic and then took her Colt from under the driver\u0027s seat. \"Walk into the woods,\" Mary said, cradling Drummer with one arm. \"away from the road. Go.\" \"Maybe you could just lock them up somewhere,\" Edward said as they walked. \"You knowi Lock them up and leave them.\" Mary didn\u0027t answer. They walked on, through the oak and pine woods, leaves and sticks cracking underfoot. \"You don\u0027t have to kill them,\" Edward tried again, his breath white in the frosty air. \"Mary, do you hear mei\" She did, but did not answer. When they\u0027d gotten about a hundred yards from the cottage, Mary said, \"Stop.\" Her eyes were used to the dark now. She ripped Laura\u0027s purse off her shoulder, planning on searching it for cash and taking the credit cards. \"Face me,\" she told the two women, and she stepped back a few paces. \"Please... don\u0027t do it,\" Didi begged. Click. Mary had pulled the Colt\u0027s hammer back. The baby was silent, little plumes of white leaving his nostrils. \"Mary, don\u0027t,\" Edward said, standing beside her. \"Don\u0027t, okayi\" \"any last wordsi\" Mary asked. Laura spoke, the side of her face swelling up. \"Rot in hell.\" \"Good enough.\" Mary aimed the pistol at Laura\u0027s head, her finger on the trigger. Two squeezes, and there would be two less mindfuckers in the world. She started to pull the trigger. There was a shot: a quick pop! that echoed through the woods. Edward staggered into her, hit her arm, and the Colt went off with a harsher crack, the bullet going into the trees over Laura\u0027s head. Something warm and wet had sprayed into Mary\u0027s face, all over her shoulder, and onto the baby. The white blanket was mottled with dark clots. She looked at Edward, and could tell that a sizable piece of his head was gone, steam swirling into the air from his oozing brains. \"Oh,\" Edward\u0027s mouth gasped, his face a blood mask. \"Light hurts.\" another shot came. She saw the flare of fire off to her right in the woods. The bullet thunked into a treetrunk behind Mary and stung her scalp with pinebark. Edward was clinging to her arm. \"Mamai Mamai\" a sob left his dripping lips. \"Eddie be good boy.\" Mary shoved him aside. as she did, a third bullet exited Edward\u0027s chest in a hot spray, and she felt the slug pull at her sweater as it passed close to her back. Edward went down, gurgling like an overflowing drain. She dropped Laura\u0027s purse and squeezed off two shots toward the gun\u0027s flare, the Colt\u0027s noise making Drummer start screaming again. High-powered rifle, she thought. a pig gun. One sniper, at least. She turned away from Laura and Didi, and began racing back to the cottage with the baby trapped in her arm and Edward Fordyce\u0027s blood and brains on her face. The rifle spoke again, clipping a branch less than six inches above Mary\u0027s head. She fired another shot, saw sparks fly as the bullet ricocheted off a rock. Then she was running for her life, slipping in the leaves and trailing the infant\u0027s scream behind her. Someone shooting, Laura thought. Shooting at Mary Terror. David in her grasp. David in the path of the bullets. She, too, had seen the muzzle flash, saw it again as another bullet searched for Mary. Her gun. In Edward\u0027s hand. Laura took three strides forward and fell upon the twitching body, and she grasped the automatic and tore it free from Edward\u0027s fingers. Then she stood up, aimed into the darkness where the sniper was, and pulled the trigger. The gun almost jumped out of her hand, its report cracking her eardrums. She kept shooting, a second bullet and a third, ripping the fabric of night. The other gun was silent. Over the buzz of pistol noise, Laura heard the roar of Mary Terror\u0027s van starting. \"She\u0027s getting away!\" Didi shouted. Car keys! Laura thought. She grasped her purse from the ground, and she began running toward the house. Mary Terror threw the van into reverse and backed down the driveway, Drummer wailing in his bassinet on the floorboard. She saw it in her sideview mirror a BMW parked on the road, blocking the driveway. She pressed her foot to the accelerator, and the van\u0027s rear end slammed against the BMW\u0027s passenger door, crumpling it in with a crash of metal and glass. The BMW trembled and groaned, but would not give way. Sweat was on her face, the taste of Edward\u0027s blood on her lips. She fought the gearshift into first, roared back up the driveway to try to knock the car aside again. The headlights caught Laura coming, gun in hand, followed by Bedelia Morse. No time to waste. Mary gritted her teeth, put the van into reverse again, and wheeled it off the driveway, knocking down thin pines and smashing one of Didi\u0027s abstract sculptures to rubble. The van scraped past the BMW\u0027s front fender, and Mary twisted the wheel to straighten the van out, hit the accelerator once more, and the van shot forward with a scream of rubber. She sped away, heading west. Laura reached her car, saw the van\u0027s taillights in the distance - both the red lenses broken - before the vehicle took a curve and disappeared. She heard Didi breathing hard behind her, and she turned around and aimed the pistol into Didi\u0027s face. \"Get in the car.\" \"Whati\" \"Get in the car!\" She tried to open the rear door on the passenger side but the hinges were jammed. Laura grabbed Didi\u0027s arm and shoved her around to the other side, where she opened the driver\u0027s door. Didi balked, tried to fight free, but Laura put the gun\u0027s barrel up under Didi\u0027s jaw and all her resistance faded. When Didi was in, Laura slid under the wheel, fished her keys from her blood-spattered purse, and started the engine. Something rattled and shrieked under the hood, but the gauges showed no warning lights. Laura mashed down on the accelerator, and the battered car laid strips of rubber to match the van\u0027s. The window on Didi\u0027s side was broken out, freezing wind shrieking into the car as the speedometer\u0027s needle passed sixty. Laura took the curve at sixty-five, skidding over into the left-hand lane. No taillights ahead, but another sharp curve lay in wait. Laura\u0027s foot didn\u0027t move toward the brake. She battled the car around the curve, went off onto the shoulder and almost into the woods before she got the car back up onto the road again. Laura glanced at the speedometer the needle was moving past seventy. Didi was jammed back into her seat, her red hair flying in the wind, her face strained with terror in the dashboard\u0027s green glow. a third curve almost threw the BMW into the trees, but Laura held tight to the shuddering steering wheel. Then there was a long straightaway ahead, and two white lights on it. Laura wiped her bleeding nose with her forearm and let the car wind up, the engine roaring and the speedometer showing eighty. But the van was going fast, too, black smoke billowing from its crumpled exhaust pipe. On both sides of the road the barren trees swept past in a dark blur. Laura got up close enough to read the numbers on the Georgia tag, and then the taillights flashed; Mary was cutting her speed, going into another wicked right-hand curve. Laura had to hit the brakes, too, and she faded back as the tires bit into the curve, wrenched them right, left, and then led them into another straightaway. Now Mary was standing on the accelerator, the van shooting forward with a fishtailing slipslide that made the breath freeze in Laura\u0027s lungs. If the van went off the road, David could be killed. She realized she couldn\u0027t ram the van, force it off onto the shoulder, or fire a bullet at a tire. any of those things might cause Mary Terror to lose control of the wheel. a bullet aimed at a tire might go through the van\u0027s body, or hit the gas tank. David would die in the flaming wreckage as surely as by one of Mary Terror\u0027s bullets. Laura cut her speed, began to let the van pull away. The speedometer\u0027s needle dropped: through seventy-five... seventy... sixty-five... sixty. Mary kept the speed up at seventy and the van was moving away, dark smoke billowing behind. Laura saw a sign on the right: I-94, 6 MI. The highway west, she thought. The automatic\u0027s barrel pressed against Laura\u0027s right temple. Didi had picked the gun up from beside her. \"Stop the car,\" Didi said. Laura kept driving, the speed now at a constant sixty. \"Stop the car!\" Didi repeated. \"I\u0027m getting out!\" Laura didn\u0027t answer, her attention focused on the road and the van ahead. Mary Terror would take the interstate because it was the fastest route to California. \"I SaID STOP THE CaR!\" Didi shouted over the wind\u0027s racket. \"No,\" Laura said. Didi sat there, stunned and helpless with the gun in her hand. Laura\u0027s nostrils were jamming up with blood. She blew her nose into her hand, enduring a savage pain that shot through her cheekbones, and then she wiped the scarlet mess onto her jeans. \"I\u0027m not going to lose Mary.\" Didi\u0027s emotions ripped like a ragged flag. \"I\u0027LL KILL YOU IF YOU DON\u0027T STOP THE CaR!\" she screamed. \"I\u0027LL BLOW YOUR DaMNED BRaINS OUT!\" Laura didn\u0027t let up on the pedal. \"You\u0027re not a killer anymore,\" she said without even glancing in Didi\u0027s direction. \"That\u0027s all over. Besides, do you want to go back to your house and try to explain to the police why Edward Fordyce is lying dead in the woodsi\" \"Stop the car, I said.\" Didi\u0027s voice was weaker. \"Where are you going to go if I doi\" \"I\u0027ll find somewhere! Don\u0027t you worry about me!\" Laura\u0027s head was pounding fiercely, the blood beginning to thicken in her nostrils. She had to breathe through her mouth to get any air. Bitch knocked the shit out of me, she thought. \"I need you,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve already ruined my life for you!\" \"Then you don\u0027t have anything else to lose. I need you to help me get my baby back. I\u0027m going to keep following Mary Terror all the way to California. all the way to hell if I have to.\" \"You\u0027re crazy! She\u0027ll kill the kid before she\u0027ll let you take him!\" \"We\u0027ll see about that,\" Laura said. Didi was about to demand to be let out again when a pair of headlights blazed in the rearview mirror. Didi looked back, saw a car gaining fast on them. \"Christ!\" she said. \"I think it\u0027s the cops!\" She lowered the gun from Laura\u0027s temple. Laura watched the car coming. The damned thing was absolutely flying, doing over eighty. No siren or blue lights yet, but Laura\u0027s heart had jammed in her throat. She didn\u0027t know what to do: hit the accelerator or the brakesi and then the car was upon them, its headlights glowing like white suns in the rearview mirror. Laura jerked the BMW to the right as the car veered alongside them and screamed past. It was a big, dark blue or black Buick, maybe six or seven years old but immaculate, and the winds of its passage almost whirled the BMW off the road. The Buick tore on, swerved into the lane ahead of Laura, and kept going. It had a Michigan tag and a sticker that said WHEN GUNS aRE OUTLaWED, ONLY OUTLaWS WILL HaVE GUNS on the rear bumper. In the van, Mary Terror saw the new arrival coming. Drummer was still crying, his bassinet having overturned on one of the curves. Pigs, she thought. Here come the fucking pigs. Edward\u0027s blood was sticky on her face, bits of his skull and brains spattered on her clothes. She cocked her Colt and rolled down her window, and she eased up on the accelerator as the big car left its lane and started to pull around her. \"Come on,\" she said into the wind. \"Come on, little piggie!\" The car pulled up alongside her and hung there, both of them doing about seventy on the backwoods road. Mary saw no police or FBI markings, and she couldn\u0027t see the driver\u0027s face either. But suddenly the car whipped to the right, and there was a crash of metal as it slammed against the van. The wheel shuddered. Mary shouted a curse and the van veered toward the right shoulder. She fought its weight, the dark woods reaching out to embrace her and Drummer. Mary got the van back up onto the road again, and again the big car slammed into her side, trying to butt her off the pavement like an enraged bull. The car hit her a third time, and sparks flew into the air as pieces of metal ground together. The van was shoved sideways, the wheel trying to tear itself out of Mary\u0027s grip. She looked to her left, saw the passenger\u0027s window going down, a smooth electric slide. The car pulled up, its driver almost even with her. There was a loud crack, a flare of fire, and something metal clattered in the back of the van. Bullet, Mary realized. Handgun. Son of a bitch was shooting at her. It dawned on her, quite suddenly, that whoever was in the big Buick was the bastard who\u0027d killed Edward. This wasn\u0027t exactly pig procedure. The fucker was trying to kill her, that much was certain. She hit the accelerator again, whipping past a sign that read I-94, 2 MI. The Buick stayed abreast. another crack and fire flare, and she heard the whine of the slug ricocheting inside the van. The Buick remained with her, touching eighty miles an hour. Mary held on to the wheel with one hand and fired a shot at the car. The bullet didn\u0027t hit, but the Buick backed off a few yards. Then it lunged forward and crashed into the van\u0027s side again, shoving the van toward the shoulder. Mary fired once more, trying to hit the Buick\u0027s engine. The van\u0027s tires slipped on loose gravel, the vehicle\u0027s rear end fishtailing. Two seconds passed in which Mary thought the van was going over, but then the tires found pavement again and the scream died behind Mary\u0027s teeth. The Buick, its right side battered and scraped, started to pull up even with her. Mary\u0027s foot was already on the floor, the van at the limit of its power. The Buick was coming, its long, scarred snout easing up. Mary dropped the Colt, reached into her shoulder bag, and brought out the Compact Magnum. Before she could get off a shot, the BMW that had come up from behind veered into the left lane and slammed into the Buick\u0027s rear fender. The collision jarred the finger that was squeezing a pistol\u0027s trigger, and the bullet whacked into the van\u0027s side seven inches behind Mary Terror\u0027s skull. Mary fired downward with the Magnum, the noise explosive and the kick thrumming through her forearm and shoulder. The Buick\u0027s right front tire popped, and as the driver stomped on the brake Laura jerked the BMW\u0027s wheel to the right and cleared the Buick by half a foot, pulling her front fender right up behind the speeding van. The Buick, its tire shredding to pieces, went across the left lane and down a knoll into a copse of trees and bushes. \"Back off! Back off!\" Didi was shouting, and Laura hit her brakes just as Mary did the same. Fenders clanged together like swords. Laura veered to the left, saw the interstate\u0027s ramp just ahead. and then Mary Terror was swinging the van up onto it, black smoke gouting from the exhaust. I-94 WEST, the sign said. Mary swerved off the ramp onto the highway, reached down, and righted Drummer\u0027s bassinet. He was still wailing, but he would have to cry himself out. She glanced into the rearview mirror, saw the BMW about fifty yards behind, cutting its speed. She cut hers, too, down to about sixty. Whoever was in the Buick would have to change the tire, and by that time she\u0027d be long gone. But Laura Clayborne was in the car behind her. Maybe Bedelia was with her. Traitor, she thought. a bullet wasn\u0027t enough for her, she should be slit open and gutted for the crows, like the lowest kind of roadkill. The BMW kept its distance. Mary returned the Magnum to her shoulder bag. She was trembling, but she\u0027d shake it off soon enough. at this time of the morning the interstate was almost empty, just a few trucks hauling freight. Mary began to relax, but her gaze kept ticking to the BM Ws headlights. Should\u0027ve blown out the tires when I had the chance, she thought. Why didn\u0027t the bitch bring the pigs with heri Why had she come alonei Stupid, that\u0027s why. Stupid and weak. \"What are you going to doi\" she asked the headlights. \"Follow me to Californiai\" She laughed: a harsh, nervous bark. \"Earl Van Diver is his name,\" Didi was saying to Laura. \"an FBI agent. Mary shot him in the throat in 1972, at the Shootout in Linden. I think he found out who I am, but he doesn\u0027t want me.\" She nodded toward the van. \"He wants Mary.\" Laura had turned the heat up to high, but the BMW\u0027s interior was still uncomfortably cold, the wind shrieking in around them. There was nothing else left to do. Nothing except to keep that van with the broken taillights in sight. Sooner or later Mary would have to stop to get gas. She would get sleepy, hungry, and thirsty. She would have to pull off, sooner or later. and when that happened... what theni Laura checked her own gas gauge. a little less than half a tank. If she had to stop first, Mary would pull on out of sight. She might turn off the interstate, try to hide until she was sure Laura couldn\u0027t find her again. But Mary was interested in only one direction, and one destination. Between here and there was over two thousand miles, and who knew what might happen in that terrible distancei \"I want out,\" Didi said. \"I\u0027m not going with you.\" Laura was silent, her nose clogged with dried blood and her injured cheek turning blue-black. \"I swear to God!\" Didi told her. \"I\u0027m not going with you!\" Laura didn\u0027t answer. She had watched a human being be murdered this morning. His blood was all over her purse, and the smell of death was in the car. She felt the horror of what she\u0027d seen start to consume her mind, take her away from the task she had set for herself, and she did the only thing she could: she just stopped thinking about Edward Fordyce, and thrust the memory of his writhing body back to a place from where it couldn\u0027t easily be summoned. She had to think about one thing and one thing only: David, in the van fifty or sixty yards ahead. Mary Terror at the wheel. armed and dangerous. Two thousand miles between her and a man who might or might not be Jack Gardiner. \"I want out! First gas station!\" They passed one in a few minutes. It was all lit up. The van kept going, its speed constant at sixty-five. Didi was quiet. She put her hands to her ears, to shut out the wind\u0027s scream. You\u0027ll stop somewhere, Laura thought. Maybe ten miles. Maybe fifty. But you\u0027ll stop, and when you do I\u0027ll be right there behind you. She glanced at the automatic lying on the seat where Didi had put it down. The grip had a dried smear of scarlet on it. Then she returned her attention to the broken taillights, and she brushed aside the nagging question of how she could possibly get David away from Mary Terror without the woman putting a bullet through his head. Laura almost cried, but she held back the tears. Her face felt like leather stretched over hot iron. Tears wouldn\u0027t help the pain, and they wouldn\u0027t help get David back alive. She didn\u0027t need her eyes swollen up, that was for sure. \"You\u0027re crazy,\" Didi said. a last shot: \"Going to get us both killed and the baby, too.\" There was no reply from Laura, but the comment had worked itself in like a thorn. Laura concentrated on keeping a steady fifty yards or so behind the van. No need to spook Mary. Just make her feel nice and comfortable up there in her van with her two guns and the child she called Drummer. He was going to grow up as David. Laura vowed it, over her dead body. The van and the BMW, both dented and battered from their first encounter, headed west on the quiet interstate. Mary Terror checked her gas gauge and kept glancing back at Laura\u0027s car, marking its position. as Drummer\u0027s crying dwindled, Mary began to sing \"Light My Fire\" in a low, wandering voice. Follow me, she was thinking. Her gaze ticked to the BMW\u0027s headlights again. That\u0027s right. Follow me so I can kill you. The van and the car passed on. Back at the entrance ramp about thirty minutes later, Earl Van Diver tightened the last lug nut and released the air from the inflatable jack. He was wearing a black woolen cap and a jump suit in camouflage green and brown, his pallid, bony face scratched by foliage. He returned his tools to their proper niches in his trunk, where the sniper\u0027s rifle and boxes of ammunition were stored along with his SuperSnooper listening dish and tape recorder. He removed a palm-size black box from the trunk, which he mounted with adhesive pads on the underside of the dashboard. Then he plugged a connection into the cigarette lighter, started the engine, and turned a switch on the black box. a little blue light pulsed, but no numerals showed up yet on the display. On his rear windshield was an antenna that resembled that of a cellular phone, but was for a different purpose. Van Diver made another connection, the antenna\u0027s jack into the black box. Still no numerals. That was all right. The magnetic homing device he\u0027d planted in the right front wheel well of Mary Terror\u0027s van wouldn\u0027t pick up on the display until he was within about four miles. It had been a precaution, for such a case as this. Beneath his seat was a hiding place where his Browning automatic pistol could slide in and out. It would be used well before he was finished with Mary Terror. and if the other two women got in the way, they were dead meat, too. Earl Van Diver backed the Buick up the embankment to the road and then drove onto the interstate\u0027s ramp. West to California, he thought. Looking for Jack Gardiner. It was all on the tape, their voices caught by the SuperSnooper dish and the wireless amplification bug he\u0027d planted inside a pottery vase in Bedelia Morse\u0027s front room. Going to California, the land of nuts and fruits. It was a good place to kill a nightmare. The Buick\u0027s speed hung between seventy and seventy-five, the pavement singing beneath the new tire. Van Diver, an executioner on a mission long awaited, hurtled toward his target.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-32.html","bookId":2480,"book":{"id":2480,"title":"Mine","description":"Storyline: Adrift in the 1980s and slowly losing her mind, a heavily armed former \u002760s radical kidnaps a baby with the hope, deluded as it may be, of returning her life to simpler times.
