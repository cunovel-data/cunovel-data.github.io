{"id":83780,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"Hi.\" The nurse had red hair and freckled cheeks, and she beamed a smile. Her name tag identified her as Erin Kingman. She glanced quickly at the empty perambulator beside the bed. \"Where\u0027s Davidi\"\\n\\n \"Someone took him to be weighed,\" Laura said. \"I guess that was about fifteen minutes ago. I asked her for orange juice, but maybe she got busy.\"\\n\\n \"Who took himi\"\\n\\n \"a big woman. Janette was her first name. I hadn\u0027t seen her before.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh.\" Erin nodded, her smile still there but the first butterfly flutters beginning in her stomach. \"all right, I\u0027ll go find her. Excuse me.\" She hurried out of the room, leaving Laura and Miriam to their conversation.\\n\\n \"Divorce.\" It had a funeral-bell sound, coming from the older woman\u0027s mouth. \"Is that what you\u0027re sayingi\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Laura, it doesn\u0027t have to be divorce. You could go to a counselor and talk things out. Divorce is a messy, sticky thing. and David\u0027s going to need a father. Don\u0027t think just of yourself and not of David.\"\\n\\n Laura heard what was coming. She waited for it without speaking, her hands clenched under the sheet.\\n\\n \"Doug\u0027s given you a good life,\" her mother went on in that earnest tone of voice used by women who knew they\u0027d traded love for comfort long ago. \"He\u0027s been a good provider, hasn\u0027t hei\"\\n\\n \"We bought a lot of things together, if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"You have a history. a life together, and now a son. You have a fine house, you drive a fine car, and you\u0027re not wanting for anything. So divorce is a drastic option, Laura. Maybe you could get a good settlement, but a thirty-six-year-old woman with a baby on her own might have a hard time -\" She stopped. \"You know what I\u0027m saying, don\u0027t youi\"\\n\\n \"Not exactly.\"\\n\\n Her mother sighed, as if Laura had the brains of a wooden block. \"a woman your age, with a baby, might have a hard time finding another man. That\u0027s important to think about before you make any rash decisions.\"\\n\\n Laura closed her eyes. She felt dizzy and sick, and she clamped her teeth down on her tongue because she couldn\u0027t trust what she might say to her mother.\\n\\n \"Now I know you think I\u0027m wrong. You\u0027ve thought I was wrong before. I\u0027m looking out for your interests because I love you, Laura. What you\u0027ve got to figure out is why Doug decided to play around, and what you can do to make up for it.\"\\n\\n Her eyes opened. \"Make up for iti\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. I told you a long time ago, a headstrong man like Doug needs a lot of attention. and he needs a loose rope, too. Take your father. I\u0027ve always held him on a loose rope, and our marriage is the better for it. These are things a woman learns by experience, and no one can teach her. The looser the rope, the stronger the marriage.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t...\" Words failed her. She tried again, knocked breathless. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re saying these things! Do you mean... you want me to stay with Dougi To look the other way if he ever decides to\" - she used her mother\u0027s term - \"play around againi\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll outgrow it,\" the older woman said. \"You have to be there for him, and he\u0027ll know that what he has at home is priceless. Doug is a good provider and he\u0027s going to be a good father. Those are very important things in this day and time. You need to be thinking about healing the wound between you and Doug instead of talking about divorce.\"\\n\\n Laura didn\u0027t know what she was about to say. Her mouth was opening, the blood was pounding in her face, and she could feel the shout beginning to draw power from her lungs. She longed to see her mother cringe before her voice, longed to see her get up from that chair and march out of the room in a practiced sulk. Doug was a stranger to her, and so was her mother; she didn\u0027t know either of those pretenders to her love. She was about to shout in her mother\u0027s face, though she didn\u0027t yet know what she was going to say.\\n\\n She would never know.\\n\\n Two nurses - one of them Erin Kingman and the other an older, stockier woman - entered the room. Following behind them was a man in a dark blue blazer and gray slacks, his face round and fleshy and his brown hair receding from a high globe of a forehead. He wore black horn-rimmed glasses, and his shoes squeaked as he approached Laura\u0027s bed.\\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" the older nurse said to Laura\u0027s mother. Her name tag read: Kathryn Langner. \"Would you go with Miss Kingman for just a few minutes, pleasei\"\\n\\n \"What is iti\" Laura\u0027s mother stood up, her radar on full alert. \"What\u0027s wrongi\"\\n\\n \"Would you come with me, pleasei\" Erin Kingman stood at the woman\u0027s side. \"We\u0027ll just step out into the hall, all righti\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going oni Laura, what\u0027s this all abouti\"\\n\\n Laura couldn\u0027t answer. The older nurse and the man moved in to take positions on either side of the bed. a foreboding of horror swept like a cold tide through Laura\u0027s body. Oh Jesus! she thought. It\u0027s David! Something\u0027s happened to David!\\n\\n \"My baby,\" she heard herself say frantically. \"Where\u0027s my babyi\"\\n\\n \"Would you wait in the hall, pleasei\" The man spoke to Miriam in a flat tone that said she would, whether she liked it or not. \"Miss Kingman, close the door on your way out.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s my babyi\" Laura felt her heart pounding, and there was a fresh twinge of pain between her legs. \"I want to see David!\"\\n\\n \"Out,\" the man told Laura\u0027s mother. Miss Kingman closed the door. Kathryn Langner grasped one of Laura\u0027s hands, and the man said in a quieter, steady voice, \"Mrs. Clayborne, my name is Bill Ramsey. I\u0027m on the security staff here. Do you remember the name of the nurse who took your child from this roomi\"\\n\\n \"Janette something. It started with an L.\" She couldn\u0027t recall the last name, and her brain was sluggish with shock. \"What\u0027s wrongi She said she was going to bring my baby right back. I\u0027d like him back now.\"\\n\\n \"Mrs. Clayborne,\" Ramsey said, \"no nurse with that first name works on the maternity ward.\" Behind his glasses, his eyes were as black as the frames. a pulse beat at his balding left temple. \"We think the woman may have taken your child from the premises.\"\\n\\n Laura blinked. Her mind rejected the last three words. \"Whati Taken him wherei\"\\n\\n \"From the hospital,\" Ramsey repeated. \"Our people are checking all the exits right now. I want you to think carefully and tell me what this woman looked like.\"\\n\\n \"She was a nurse. She said she worked on weekends.\" The blood was roaring in Laura\u0027s head. She heard her voice as if at the far end of a long tunnel. I\u0027m about to faint, she thought. Dear God, I\u0027m really about to faint. She squeezed the nurse\u0027s hand and was met by forceful pressure.\\n\\n \"She wore a nurse\u0027s uniform, is that correcti\"\\n\\n \"Yes. a uniform. She was a nurse.\"\\n\\n \"Her first name was Janette. Did she tell you thati\"\\n\\n \"It was... it was... on her name tag. Next to the Smiley Face.\"\\n\\n \"Pardon mei\"\\n\\n \"The... Smiley Face,\" Laura said. \"It was yellow. a Smiley Face button.\"\\n\\n \"What color was the woman\u0027s hair and eyesi\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t -\" Her thinking was freezing solid, but there seemed to be pulsing heat trapped in her face. \"Brown hair. Shoulder-length. Her eyes were... blue, I think. No, gray. I can\u0027t remember.\"\\n\\n \"anything else about heri Crooked nosei Heavy eyebrowsi Frecklesi\"\\n\\n \"Tall,\" Laura said. \"a big woman. Tall.\" Her throat was closing up, dark motes spun before her eyes, and only the pressure of the nurse\u0027s hand kept her from passing out.\\n\\n \"How talli Five ninei Five teni Talleri\"\\n\\n \"Taller. Six feet. Maybe more.\"\\n\\n Bill Ramsey reached under his coat and pulled out a walkie-talkie. He clicked it on. \"Eugene, this is Ramsey. We\u0027re looking for a woman in a nurse\u0027s uniform, description as follows: brown shoulder-length hair, blue or gray eyes, approximately six feet tall. Hold on.\" He looked at Laura again, whose face had gone chalky except for red circles around her eyes. \"Heavyset, slim, or medium buildi\"\\n\\n \"Big. Heavyset.\"\\n\\n \"Eugenei Heavyset. Got a name tag that identifies her as Janette, last name begins with an L. Copyi\"\\n\\n \"Copy,\" the voice crackled over the walkie-talkie.\\n\\n \"The button,\" Laura reminded him. She was about to throw up, the nausea hot in her stomach. \"The Smiley Face button.\"\\n\\n Ramsey clicked the walkie-talkie on again and gave Eugene the extra information.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to be sick,\" Laura told Kathryn Langner, tears burning trails down her cheeks. \"Would you help me to the bathroom, pleasei\"\\n\\n The nurse helped her, but Laura didn\u0027t make it to the bathroom before she expelled her lunch. Laura, cold as death, slipped from the woman\u0027s grasp and fell to her knees onto the floor, and when she splayed there she felt the raw pain of the stitches tearing between her thighs. Someone was called to clean up the mess, Laura was returned to bed shivering and dazed with shock, and Ramsey allowed her mother back into the room with Miss Kingman. The young nurse had already told Laura\u0027s mother what was happening, and Ramsey sat beside the bed and directed more questions at both of them. Neither could recall the woman\u0027s last name. \"Lewisi Logani\" Ramsey prompted. \"Larsoni Lesteri\"\\n\\n \"Lester,\" Laura\u0027s mother said. \"That was it!\"\\n\\n \"No, it wasn\u0027t that,\" Laura disagreed. \"It was something close to Lester.\"\\n\\n \"Think hard. Try to see the name tag in your mind. Can you see iti\"\\n\\n \"It was Lester!\" the older woman insisted. \"I know what it was!\" Her face flamed with anger. \"Jesus Christ, is this your way of running a hospitali Letting crazy people come in and steal babiesi\"\\n\\n Ramsey paid her no attention. \"See the name tag,\" he told Laura while the nurse pressed a cold washrag against her forehead. \"Look at the last name. Something like Lester. What is iti\"\\n\\n \"Lester, for God\u0027s sake!\" Miriam insisted.\\n\\n Laura saw the name tag in her mind, white letters on a blue background. She saw the first name, and then the last name came clear of its fog. \"Leister, I think it was.\" She spelled it out. \"L-e-i-s-t-e-r.\"\\n\\n at once Ramsey was on his walkie-talkie again. \"Eugene, Ramsey. Call down to records and have them check a name: Leister.\" He spelled it, too. \"Get me a printout when it\u0027s done. Metro on the wayi\"\\n\\n \"Double quick,\" the disembodied voice answered.\\n\\n \"I want my baby back,\" Laura said, her eyes deep with tears. Her mind wasn\u0027t truly registering what was happening; this had to be a gruesome, hideous joke. They were hiding David from her. Why were they being so crueli She hung to sanity by the pressure of a nurse\u0027s hand. \"Please bring my baby back. Right now. Okayi Okayi\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d better find my grandson!\" Laura\u0027s mother was right up in Ramsey\u0027s face. \"You hear mei We\u0027ll sue your asses off if you don\u0027t find my grandson!\"\\n\\n \"The police are on their way.\" His voice was brittle with tension. \"Everything\u0027s under control.\"\\n\\n \"Like hell it is!\" the older woman shouted. \"Where\u0027s my grandsoni You people had better have a damned good lawyer!\"\\n\\n \"Be quiet,\" Laura rasped, but her voice was lost in her mother\u0027s anger. \"Please be quiet.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of security do you have around herei You don\u0027t even know who\u0027s a nurse and who\u0027s not a nursei You let just anybody off the street come in here and take babiesi\"\\n\\n \"Ma\u0027am, we\u0027re doing the best we can. You\u0027re not helping things.\"\\n\\n \"and you arei My God, there\u0027s no telling who\u0027s got my grandson! It could be any kind of lunatic!\"\\n\\n Laura began to cry, hopelessly and in great pain. Her mother raged on as Ramsey took it with a tight-lipped stare and rain slashed at the window. His walkie-talkie beeped. \"Ramsey,\" he said into it, and Miriam stopped shouting.\\n\\n The voice said, \"Need you down in the laundry, pronto.\"\\n\\n \"On my way.\" He clicked the walkie-talkie off. \"Mrs. Clayborne, I\u0027m going to have to leave you for a little while. Is your husband in the hospitali\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t... I don\u0027t know...\"\\n\\n \"Can you get in touch with himi\" he asked her mother.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll take care of that! You just do your job and find that baby!\"\\n\\n \"Stay with them,\" Ramsey told the two nurses, and he hurried out of the room.\\n\\n \"Get away from my daughter!\" Laura heard her mother command. The nurse\u0027s grip relaxed and fell away, leaving Laura with an empty hand. Her mother stood over her. \"It\u0027s going to be all right. Do you hear me, Laurai Look at me.\"\\n\\n Laura lifted her face and looked at her mother through blurred and burning eyes.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s going to be all right. They\u0027ll find David. We\u0027re going to sue this damned hospital for ten million dollars, that\u0027s what we\u0027re going to do. Doug knows some good lawyers. By God, we\u0027ll break this hospital, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll do.\" She turned away from Laura and picked up the telephone, dialing the house on Moore\u0027s Mill Road.\\n\\n The answering machine came on. Doug wasn\u0027t home.\\n\\n Laura lay on the bed and pulled herself into the fetal position, grasping a pillow against her. \"I want my baby,\" she whispered. \"I want my baby. I want my baby.\" Her voice broke, and she could speak no more. Her body, a hollow vessel, ached for her child. She squeezed her eyes shut, blocking out all light. Darkness filled her. She lay at the mercy of God, or fate, or luck. The world spun with her curled up in a tight, hurting ball and her baby stolen from her, and Laura struggled to hold back a scream that she feared might shred her soul to bloody ribbons.\\n\\n She lost. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-13.html","bookId":2480,"book":{"id":2480,"title":"Mine","description":"Storyline: Adrift in the 1980s and slowly losing her mind, a heavily armed former \u002760s radical kidnaps a baby with the hope, deluded as it may be, of returning her life to simpler times.
