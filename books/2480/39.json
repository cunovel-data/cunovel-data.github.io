{"id":83806,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"Horn blowing. Mary\u0027s eyes opened, the lids gummy and swollen. Horn blowing outside. Outside the house. Her heart kicked. She sat up in the Barcalounger, and every joint in her body seemed to scream in unison. a gasp of pain came from Mary\u0027s lips. Horn blowing outside, in the gray gloom of a winter morning. She\u0027d gone to sleep with the TV going and the lights on; a man with a crew cut was talking about soybean production on the tube. When she tried to stand up, the jolt of agony that shot through her thigh took her breath. The bandages were crusted with dark blood, the smell of copper rank in the room. Her forearm wound pulsed with heat, but it was numb and so was her right hand. She stood up from the chair with an effort that made the air hiss between her teeth, and she hobbled to a window where she could see the front of the house. a thin layer of snow had fallen during the night, and covered the fields. Out on the white-dusted road, about sixty yards from the farmhouse, sat a school bus with CEDaR COUNTY SCHOOLS on its side. Come to pick up Fudge Ripple, Mary knew. Except the boy wasn\u0027t ready for school. He was fast asleep, under the hay. The school bus sat there for fifteen seconds more, and then the driver gave a last frustrated honk on the horn and the bus pulled away, heading to the next house down the road. Mary found a clock. It was seven thirty-four. She felt weak, light-headed, and nausea throbbed in her stomach. She staggered into a bathroom and leaned over the toilet, and she retched a few times but nothing much came up. She looked at herself in the mirror her eyes sunken in swollen folds, her flesh as gray as the dawn. Death, she thought. That\u0027s what I look like. Her leg was hurting with a vengeance, and she searched through a closet in the bathroom until she found a bottle of Excedrin. She took three of them, crunching them between her teeth and washing them down with a handful of water from the tap. She longed to rest today. Longed to go back to sleep here in this warm house, but it was time to get out. The school bus driver would wonder why Fudge Ripple hadn\u0027t come out this morning when all the lights were on in the house. He\u0027d tell somebody about it, and they\u0027d wonder, too. Routines were the vital fabric of the Mindfuck State; when a routine was disrupted, like a missed stitch, all the little ants got stirred up. It was time to get out. Drummer began to cry; Mary recognized it as his hungry cry, pitched a tone or two lower and less intense than his frightened cry. It was more of a nasal buzzing with a few pauses for the summoning of breath. She\u0027d have to feed him and change his diaper before they left. a sense of urgency got her moving. First she changed her bandages, wincing as she peeled away the crusty cotton. She repacked the wounds and wrapped them tightly with fresh strips of torn sheet. Then she popped open her suitcase, put on fresh underwear, and got a pair of flannel socks from Rocky Road\u0027s dresser. Her jeans were too constrictive at the thighs for her swollen leg, so she pulled on a pair of looser denims - again, courtesy of her departed host - and cinched them tight with one of her belts. She put on a gray workshirt, a maroon sweater she\u0027d had since 1981, and she pinned the Smiley Face button on the front. Her scuffed boots went on last. In Rocky Road\u0027s closet hung a tempting assortment of heavy coats and parkas. She took a brown corduroy coat with a fleece-lined collar off its hanger and laid it aside for later, and chose a green goosedown parka to zip Drummer up in as a makeshift bassinet. a pair of man-sized leather gloves were also set aside for later. as Mary fed Drummer, she continually squeezed a tennis ball in her right hand to warm up the sinews. Her strength in that hand was about a third of what it normally was, her fingers cold and numb. Nerve damage, she thought. She could feel the twitching of the ravaged muscles down in the forearm wound; the damned dog had come close to gnawing an artery open, and if that had happened, she\u0027d be dead by now. The thigh wound was the real bitch, though. It needed fifty or sixty stitches and a hell of a lot better antiseptic than what she\u0027d found in Rocky Road\u0027s bathroom. But just as long as it stayed crusted over, she could make herself keep going. The telephone rang as she was changing Drummer\u0027s diaper. It stopped after twelve rings, was quiet for five minutes, and then rang eight more times. \"Somebody\u0027s curious,\" she told Drummer as she swabbed him clean with a Handi Wipe. \"Somebody wants to know why the boy didn\u0027t come out to the school bus, or why Rocky Road\u0027s not clocked in at work yet. Yes somebody does, yes him does!\" She started moving a little faster. The telephone rang again at eight-forty as Mary was loading up the Cherokee in the garage. It went silent, and Mary continued the task. She loaded her suitcase and a garbage bag full of food from the kitchen: the rest of the sliced ham, a pack of bologna, a loaf of wheat bread, a jug of orange juice and a few apples, a box of oat bran cereal and a big bag of Fritos corn chips. She found a bottle each of mineral supplement tablets and vitamins that might\u0027ve choked a horse. She swallowed two of both. When she was packed and ready to take Drummer out, she paused for a minute to make herself a bowl of Wheat Chex and drink down a Coke. She was standing in the kitchen, finishing the cereal, when she glanced through a window and saw a pig car coming slowly up the drive. It pulled up in front of the house, and a pig wearing a dark blue parka got out. The car had CEDaR COUNTY SHERIFF\u0027S DEPaRTMENT on its side. By the time the pig - who was maybe in his early twenties, just a kid - reached the front door and rang the buzzer, Mary had loaded one of the remaining rifles from the gun cabinet. She stood around a corner from the door, waiting. The pig rang the buzzer again, then knocked with a gloved fist. \"Hey, Mitch!\" he called, his breath showing in the frosty air. \"Where you at, boyi\" Go away, Mary thought. Her leg had started hurting her again, a deep biting ache. \"Mitchi You to homei\" The pig backed away from the door. He stood looking around for a minute, his hands on his hips, and then Mary watched him start to walk to the right. She went to another window, where she could track him. He walked to the back door and peered in, his breath fogging the glass. He knocked again, harder. \"Emmai anybodyi\" Nobody here you want to meet, she thought. The pig tried the back door\u0027s knob. Worked it left and right. Then she watched him turn his head and look toward the barn. He called \"Mitchi\" and then he began walking away from the house, his boots crunching in the icy snow on his way to where the bodies and the van were. Mary stood at the back door, the rifle in her hands. She decided to let him find Mitch and Emma. The pig opened the barn\u0027s door and walked inside. She waited, her eyes glittering with a kind of lust. It didn\u0027t take long. The pig came running out. He staggered, stopped, bent over, and threw up onto the snow. Then he started running again, his long legs pumping and his face ghastly. Mary unlocked the door and stepped out into the chill. The pig saw her, came to a skidding halt, and started reaching for his pistol. The holster\u0027s flap was snapped down, and as the pig\u0027s gloved fingers fumbled to unsnap it, Mary Terror flexed her numb hand, took aim, and shot him in the stomach at a range of thirty feet. He was knocked backward to the ground, the breath bursting white from his mouth and nostrils. as the pig rolled over and tried to struggle to his knees, Mary fired a second shot that took away a chunk of his left shoulder in a mist of steamy blood. The third bullet got him in the lower back as he was crawling across the crimson snow. He jerked a few times, like a fish on a hook. and then he lay still, facedown, his arms splayed out in an attitude of crucifixion. Mary breathed deeply of the cold air, savoring its sting in her lungs. Then she went back into the kitchen, set the rifle down, and finished the last two spoonfuls of Wheat Chex. She drank the milk, and followed it with the final swig of Coke. She limped to the bedroom, where she put on the corduroy coat and the gloves, then picked up Drummer in the folds of the goosedown parka. \"Pretty boy, yes you are!\" she said as she carried him to the kitchen. \"Mama\u0027s pretty little boy!\" She kissed his cheek, a surge of love rising within her like a glowing radiance. She looked out the back door again, verifying that the pig had not moved. Then she put Drummer into the Cherokee, cranked open the garage door, and slid behind the wheel. She pulled out of the garage, past the pig car and down the driveway. Then she turned right on the road that led back to I-80 and the route west. Her shoulder bag was on the floorboard, full of Pampers and formula and holding her Magnum and the new Smith Wesson revolver to replace the lost Colt. She felt so much better this morning. Still weak, yes, but so much better. It must be the vitamins, she decided. Got some iron in her blood, and that made all the difference. Or maybe it was the power of love, she thought as she glanced on the seat beside her at her beautiful baby. The list of names and phone numbers was in her pocket, along with the bloodstained Sierra Club newsletter article. To the west the sky was a dark purple haze, the land white as a peace dove. It was a morning rich with love. The Cherokee went on, aimed toward California, freighted with firepower and madness.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-39.html","bookId":2480,"book":{"id":2480,"title":"Mine","description":"Storyline: Adrift in the 1980s and slowly losing her mind, a heavily armed former \u002760s radical kidnaps a baby with the hope, deluded as it may be, of returning her life to simpler times.
