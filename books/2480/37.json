{"id":83804,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"The Darkness came. The wind blew cold across the plains, and flurries of snow spat from the clouds. at the Liberty Motor Lodge six miles east of Iowa City, Laura lay in bed in Room 10 and alternately shivered and sweated beneath the sheet and coarse blanket. The TV was on, tuned to a family sitcom. Laura couldn\u0027t focus on it, but she liked the sound of the voices. On the bedside table was the debris of her dinner - two plastic McDonald\u0027s burger containers, an empty french fries pack, and a half-finished Coke. a plastic bag full of crushed ice lay at her side, useful when the pain in her hand got to be excruciating and she needed to numb it. Laura stared fixedly at the TV set, waiting for Didi to come back. Didi had been gone thirty minutes, hunting for a drugstore. They had agreed on what needed to be done, and she knew what was ahead for her. Every so often she chewed her lower lip. It had gotten raw, but she kept chewing it. She could hear the whine of the wind outside, and once in a while she imagined she heard the sound of a baby crying in it. She had gotten up once to look outside, but the effort had so drained her that she couldn\u0027t force herself to get up again. So she listened to the wind and the crying baby and she knew she was very, very close to the edge and it would not take much for her to open that door and go wandering in the hungry dark. They had lost Mary Terror and David. That much was certain. Exactly how Van Diver had crashed into the milk tanker, Laura didn\u0027t know, but Mary and David were gone. But Mary had been badly hurt, too, losing a lot of blood. She\u0027d been weary - maybe even more weary than Laura - and she couldn\u0027t have gotten very far. Where would she have stoppedi Surely not a motel; not with blood all over her and her leg chewed up. Would she have just found a place to pull the van over and spend the nighti No, because she\u0027d have to run the engine all night or she and David would freeze to death. So that left one other possibility: that Mary had invited herself into somebody\u0027s house. It wouldn\u0027t be hard for her to do, not with the farmhouses spread hundreds of acres apart. How far west had Mary gotten before she\u0027d decided to leave the interstatei Was she ahead of them, or behind themi It was impossible to know, but Laura did know one vital thing: Mary Terror\u0027s destination. Wherever Mary was, however long she rested and let her wounds heal, she would sooner or later be back on the highway with David, heading for Freestone, California, and the memory of a lost hero. and that, too, was Laura\u0027s destination, even if she had to get there on her hands and knees. Minus one finger, with scar tissue toughening her heart. She was going to get David back, or die trying. When Laura heard the key slide into the door\u0027s lock, she thought she might be sick. But her food stayed down, and Didi came in with snowflakes in her red hair and a sack in her arms. \"Got the stuff,\" Didi said as she closed the door against the cold and double-latched it. She had found not a drugstore but a K-Mart, and she\u0027d bought them both gloves, woolen socks, fresh underwear, toothpaste, and toothbrushes as well as the other necessities. as Didi put the sack down, Laura realized Didi had gained about twenty pounds since she\u0027d left the motel. Didi pulled off her sweater and revealed the weight gain: there were two more thick sweaters underneath the first one. \"My God,\" Laura rasped. \"You shoplifted.\" \"I had to do it,\" Didi said as she peeled another layer off. \"We\u0027ve only got about thirty-five dollars left.\" She smiled, the lines deepening around her eyes. \"Shoplifting isn\u0027t what it used to be. They watch you like a hawk.\" \"So how\u0027d you do it without getting caughti\" \"You give a kid in a Quiet Riot jacket a buck to knock over a display of skiwear, and then you come out of the dressing room, put your head down, and walk. It helps to be buying other items, too. That way you don\u0027t go out past the guard, and those cashiers don\u0027t give a crap.\" She threw one of the sweaters on the bed beside Laura, who picked it up with her right hand. \"Inferior quality,\" Laura decided. It was dark gray, banded with green stripes the color of puke. Didi\u0027s new sweater was yellow with cardinals on the front. \"Did prisoners sew thesei\" \"Beggars can\u0027t be choosers. Neither can shoplifters.\" But the fact was that she had been careful to choose the bulkiest knits she could find. The cold of Nebraska and Wyoming would make Iowa\u0027s weather seem balmy. Didi continued to take items out of the sack. at last she came to the wooden tongue depressors, the gauze bandages, a small pair of scissors, a box of wide Band-aids, and a bottle of iodine and a bottle of hydrogen peroxide. Didi swallowed hard, getting herself ready for what had to be done. This was going to be like trying to build a house with thumbtacks, but it was the best they could do. She looked at Laura and offered another smile, the woman\u0027s face bleached with pain. \"Doctor Didi\u0027s come to call,\" Didi said, and then she looked away before her smile cracked and betrayed her. \"Do your ear first.\" \"Whati That scratchi Just got skin, that\u0027s all.\" Her wounded ear, hidden beneath her hair, had crusted over. It hurt like hell, but Laura needed the attention. \"Oh, I got this, too.\" She took a bottle of Extra-Strength Excedrin from her pocket and set it aside. \"Courtesy of my fast hands.\" She wished it were industrial strength, because before this night was over they were both going to need some heavy drugs. \"Sorry I couldn\u0027t get you any liquor.\" \"That\u0027s all right. I\u0027ll survive.\" \"Yeah, I believe you will.\" Didi went to the bathroom, wet a washrag, and brought it out for Laura. When the pain got really bad, Laura was going to need something to chew on. \"You readyi\" \"Ready.\" Didi got the tongue depressors out. a little wider than Popsicle sticks, they were. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Let\u0027s take a look.\" She peeled the covers back from Laura\u0027s hand. Laura watched Didi\u0027s face. She thought that Didi did a very good job of not flinching at the sight. Laura knew it was hideous. The mangled hand - hamburger hand, she thought - was burning hot, and every so often it throbbed with a pain so intense it sucked away Laura\u0027s breath. The stub of the little finger was still drooling some watery blood, which had soaked into a towel underneath her hand and onto the sheet. The three other fingers and thumb were curved into claws. \"What\u0027ll my manicurist sayi\" Laura asked. \"You should\u0027ve soaked in Palmolive.\" Laura laughed, but it had a nervous edge. Didi sighed, wishing to God there was someone else who could do this. It could\u0027ve been worse, though. The dogs could\u0027ve gotten to Laura\u0027s throat, or torn up her legs, or chewed into her other arm. Or killed the baby. Didi looked at the wedding band and engagement ring on the swollen finger. There was no way short of cutting them to get them off. \"The diamond,\" Laura said. \"Can you work it out of the settingi\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" She touched the upraised diamond and found it was already loose, two of its six prongs broken. \"Try. I\u0027ll hang on.\" \"Why do you want the diamond outi\" \"We\u0027ve got only thirty-five dollars left,\" Laura reminded her. \"Have we got anything else to pawn but my diamondi\" They did not. Didi grasped Laura\u0027s bruised wrist as gently as she could and went to work with the scissors, trying to pry the diamond out. Laura was braced for agony, but none came. \"That finger\u0027s dead,\" she said. In a few minutes Didi had managed to loosen a third prong. The diamond jiggled around, but it still didn\u0027t have quite enough room to be popped out. The fourth prong was tougher. \"Hurry, okayi\" Laura asked in a faint voice. after two or three more minutes, Didi got the fourth prong bent enough to slide a tip of the scissors blade under the diamond and lever it out. It popped free, and Didi held it in her palm. \"Nice rock. What\u0027d your husband pay for iti\" \"Three thousand dollars.\" Sweat sparkled on Laura\u0027s face. \"That was eight years ago.\" \"Maybe we can get five hundred for it. an honest pawnbroker\u0027s not going to touch an unmounted diamond without ownership papers.\" She wrapped the diamond up in a Band-aid and put it into her pocket. \"Okay. Ready for the big jobi\" \"Yes. Let\u0027s get it over with.\" Didi began by washing the hand with hydrogen peroxide. Bloody foam hissed up from the bite wounds, and Laura moaned and chewed on the washrag. Didi had to repeat the task twice more, until all the grit was washed away. Laura\u0027s eyes were squeezed shut, tears trickling from the corners. Didi reached for the iodine. \"Well,\" she said, \"this ought to sting just a little.\" Laura pushed the rag between her teeth again, and Didi began the awful work. There was a pain that Laura would always remember. She had been nine years old. She\u0027d been riding her bike, flying hell-for-leather on a country road, when the tires had slipped out from under her on loose gravel. There had been bloody holes in her knees, her arms were raw, her elbows bleeding, her chin gashed. and the worst of it was that she\u0027d been two miles from home. There was no one to hear her cry. No one to help her. So she got up, remounted that traitorous bike, and started pedaling again, because it was the only way. \"Laura!\" she remembered her mother screaming. \"You\u0027ve crippled yourself!\" No, the injury hadn\u0027t been crippling. She had grown scabs and scars, but on that day she had begun to grow up. This pain also taught a hard lesson. It was like sticking her hand into hot charcoals, dousing it with salty water, and then back into the coals again. She shivered, the sweat rising in beads from her pores. It was a mercy that ten seconds after Didi began the task, Laura lost consciousness. When she awakened, Didi had finished the application of disinfectant and was completing the splint on Laura\u0027s ring finger, pulling it out straight and bandaging one of the sticks along Laura\u0027s palm and finger. Then it was the middle finger\u0027s turn. When Didi touched it, Laura winced. \"Sorry,\" Didi said. \"There\u0027s no other way.\" She began to pull the finger out straight, and Laura screamed behind the washrag. again Laura passed out, which was a blessing because Didi could do the work quickly, getting the splint into place and securing it with Band-aids. She had just finished the index finger when Laura\u0027s eyelids fluttered. Laura spat the rag out, her face yellowish-white. \"Sick,\" she gasped, and Didi rushed to get a trash can up to Laura\u0027s mouth. The ordeal wasn\u0027t yet over. Didi splinted the thumb, another exercise in torment, and wrapped the hand with gauze bandages, the pressure again making Laura groan and sweat. \"You don\u0027t want to go through life with a claw, do youi\" Didi asked as she cut the gauze and began a new layer. Laura breathed like a slow bellows, her eyes vacant and clouded with pain. \"almost got it wrapped up,\" Didi said. \"That\u0027s supposed to be funny.\" It wasn\u0027t, really. In the morning the bandages would have to be changed, the wounds cleansed again, and they both knew it. \"Lucy,\" Laura whispered as Didi finished the wrapping. \"Whati Lucy whoi\" \"Lucy and Ethel.\" She swallowed, her throat parched. \"When they were... wrapping the candies... and the candies started coming faster and faster off the conveyor belt. Did you see that onei\" \"Oh, yeah! It\u0027s a scream!\" \"Good show,\" Laura said. Her hand was a seething mass of fire and anguish, but the healing process had begun. \"They don\u0027t... make \u0027em like that anymore.\" \"I liked the one where Lucy was in Las Vegas and she had to walk down a staircase with that big headdress on. Rememberi and the one where she puts too much yeast in the bread and it shoots out of the oven like a freight train. Those were great.\" She cut the gauze and taped it down with a couple of Band-aids. \"It always killed me when Lucy tried to get a part in one of Ricky\u0027s shows, and he blew up at her in Spanish.\" Didi rested Laura\u0027s bandaged hand against the ice pack. \"I watched those with my mom and dad. We had a TV with a round screen, and the damned thing was always shorting out. I remember my dad on his knees trying to fix the set, and he said, \u0027Didi, the guy who can figure out how to keep these things working is going to make a lot of money.\u0027\" \"Whyi\" Laura asked weakly. \"Why whati\" \"Why did you join the Storm Fronti\" Didi rolled the remainder of the gauze up and closed the box of Band-aids. She put the scissors and the other items atop the room\u0027s cheap dresser. Beyond the window, Didi could hear the high waspish whine of the freezing wind. \"What do you expect me to sayi\" Didi finally asked when she saw Laura still watching her. \"That I was a bad kidi That I pulled the legs off grasshoppers and beat kittens with baseball batsi No, I didn\u0027t grow up like that. I was president of the home economics club in high school, and I made the honor roll every semester. I played piano for the youth choir at my church.\" She shrugged. \"I wasn\u0027t a monster. The only thing was, I didn\u0027t know what was growing inside me.\" \"What was thati\" \"a yearning,\" Didi said. \"To be different. To know things. To go places my folks only read about. See, you take Lucy: if you only watched shows like that on TV, night after night, soon you\u0027d start thinking that\u0027s all the world had to offer. My folks were afraid of real life. They didn\u0027t want me out in it. They said I was going to make a fine wife for some local boy, that I\u0027d live maybe three or four miles from their front door and raise a houseful of kids and we\u0027d all get together for pot roast on Sundays.\" Didi opened the curtains and looked out the window. Snowflakes spun before the light; the cars in the parking lot were frosted over. \"They were amazed when I said I wanted to go to college. When I said I wanted to go to college out of Iowa, it was the first day of a long cold war. They couldn\u0027t understand why I didn\u0027t want to stay put. I was a fool, they said. I was breaking their hearts. Well, I didn\u0027t understand this then, but they needed me between them or they wouldn\u0027t have any common ground. They didn\u0027t want me to grow up, and when I did... they didn\u0027t know me anymore. They didn\u0027t want to.\" She let the curtains fall. \"So I guess part of why I left home was to find out what my folks were so afraid of.\" \"Did youi\" \"Yes, I did. Like any generation, they were terrified of the future. Terrified of being insignificant and forgotten.\" She nodded. \"It\u0027s a deep terror, Laura. Sometimes I feel it. I never got married - oh, bourgeois disease! - and I never had a child. My time for that is over. When I die, no one\u0027s going to cry at my funeral. No one\u0027s going to know my story. I\u0027ll lie under weeds near a road where strangers pass, and no one will remember the sound of my voice, the color of my hair, or what I gave a damn about. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve stayed with you, Laura. Do you understandi\" \"No.\" \"I want you to get your baby back,\" Didi said, \"because I\u0027m never going to have a child of my own. and if I can help you find David... that\u0027s kind of like he\u0027s mine, too, isn\u0027t iti\" \"Yes,\" Laura answered. She could feel herself drifting away from the world, on waves of raw pain. It was going to be a long, terrible night. \"Kind of.\" \"It\u0027s good enough for me.\" Didi got Laura a cup of water and gave her two aspirin. The fever sweat glistened on Laura\u0027s face again, and she groaned as her hand pulsed with white-hot agony. Didi drew a chair up beside the bed and sat there as Laura fought the pain as best she could. What was going to happen tomorrow, Didi didn\u0027t know. It depended on Laura: if she was well enough to travel, they ought to be heading west again as soon as possible. Didi got up after a while, and took the plastic bag out to the ice maker for a refill. While she was there, she found a newspaper vending machine, and used her last change to buy an Iowa City Journal. Back in the warm room, the smells of iodine and sickness thick in the air, Didi got Laura\u0027s hand situated on the ice pack and then sat down to read. She found the story of the crash on I-80 on page three. The body, a male, remained unidentified. \"Not much left to work from,\" the coroner had remarked. Except that the car, a late-model BMW, had a Georgia license plate. Didi realized that by now the tracing of the tag would be done and the FBI would know whose car it was. The police-beat reporters would smell a new scent on an old story, and pretty soon Laura\u0027s picture would start showing up in the papers again. and Mary Terror\u0027s picture, too. The death of Earl Van Diver might well make Mary and the baby front-page news once more. Didi looked at Laura, who had fallen into an exhausted sleep. any picture of the old Laura that appeared in a newspaper wouldn\u0027t resemble the woman who lay there, her face pinched with anguish and tough with determination. But if Mary and the baby were back prominently in the news, that meant more of a chance for someone to recognize her. and more of a chance that some Smokey with a macho complex might spot her, do something stupid, and get David killed. She turned on the TV, keeping the volume low, and she watched the ten o\u0027clock Iowa City newscast. Coverage of the wreck was there as well, and an interview with the milk tanker driver, a fat-cheeked man with a bloody bandage on his forehead and a glazed stare that said he\u0027d had a peek into his own grave. \"I seen this van and the other car comin\u0027 and the highway patrol right behind \u0027em,\" the driver explained in a quavering voice. \"Maybe doin\u0027 eighty, all three of \u0027em. The van was flyin\u0027 up on my tail and I tried to get over in the right lane and then wham the car hit my tanker and it was all she wrote.\" The newscaster said the highway patrol and state police were searching for a dark green van with a Georgia license plate. as Didi listened to the rest of the news, she picked up a notepad with Liberty Motor Lodge and a cracked bell printed across the top. With a motel pencil she wrote Mary Terror. Then Freestone, and three names she had memorized long ago: Nick Hudley, Keith Cavanaugh, Dean Walker. Beneath the third name she drew a circle, put two dots in it for eyes and the arc of a mouth: a Smiley Face, like the button she\u0027d seen on Mary\u0027s sweater there at the lumberyard. The troopers would be on the sniff for Mary\u0027s van. They\u0027d be out in droves tomorrow. But they might also be looking for a stolen Oldsmobile Cutlass with a Playboy bunny decal on the rear windshield. It wouldn\u0027t hurt to scrape that damned thing off, do away with the hanging dice, and, while she was out in the cold dark, swap license plates with one of the other cars parked outside. How many people looked at their plates, especially on a frigid gray morningi The scissor blades might work to loosen screws as well as the prongs of an engagement ring. If not, then not. Didi tore off the notepad\u0027s page, folded it, and put it into her pocket along with the diamond. She destroyed the next two pages, getting rid of the indentations. She put on her second sweater and her gloves, checked again on Laura\u0027s hand - blood coming up through the gauze, but there was nothing more to be done but freeze it with ice - and then Didi went outside to do things that told her she still had the instincts of a Storm Fronter.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-37.html","bookId":2480,"book":{"id":2480,"title":"Mine","description":"Storyline: Adrift in the 1980s and slowly losing her mind, a heavily armed former \u002760s radical kidnaps a baby with the hope, deluded as it may be, of returning her life to simpler times.
