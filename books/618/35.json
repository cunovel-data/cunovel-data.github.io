{"id":22513,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV","content":"At the entrance of Joe Ellison instead of the expected Dick, Barney and Old Jimmie had sprung up from the table in amazement. Joe strode past Maggie, hardly heeding his daughter, and faced the two men. “I guess you know me, Jimmie Carlisle!” said Joe with a terrifying restraint of tone. “The pal I trusted—the pal I turned everything over to—the pal who double-crossed me in every way!” “Joe Ellison!” gasped Jimmie, suddenly as ghastly as a dead man. “I—I didn\u0027t know you were out.” “I\u0027m out, all right. But I\u0027ll probably go in again for what I\u0027m going to do to you! And you there”—turning on Barney—“you\u0027re got up enough like a professional dancer to be the Barney Palmer I\u0027ve heard of!” “What business is it of yours who I am?” Barney tried to bluster. “Perhaps you won\u0027t mind introducing yourself.” “I\u0027m the man who\u0027s going to settle with you and Old Jimmie Carlisle! Is that introduction enough. If not, then I\u0027m Joe Ellison, the father of this girl here you call Maggie Carlisle and Maggie Cameron, that you two have made into a crook.” “Your daughter!” exclaimed Barney in stupefaction. “Why, she\u0027s Jimmie Carlisle\u0027s—” “He\u0027s always passed her off as such; that much I\u0027ve learned. Speak up, Jimmie Carlisle! Whose daughter is this girl you\u0027ve turned into a crook?” “Your daughter, Joe,” stammered Old Jimmie. “But about my making her into a crook—you\u0027re—you\u0027re all wrong there.” “So she\u0027s not a crook, and you didn\u0027t make her one?” demanded Joe with the calm of unexploded dynamite whose fuse is sputtering. “I left you about twelve or fifteen hundred a year to bring her up on—as a decent, respectable girl. That\u0027s twenty-five or thirty a week. If she\u0027s not a crook, how can she on twenty-five a week have all the swell clothes I\u0027ve seen her in, and be living in a suite like this that costs from twenty-five to fifty a day? And if she isn\u0027t a crook, why is she mixed up with two such crooks as you? And if she isn\u0027t a crook, why is she in a game to trim young Dick Sherwood?” The two men started and wilted at these driving questions. “But—but, Joe,” stammered Old Jimmie, “you\u0027ve gone out of your head. She\u0027s not in any such game. She never even heard of any Dick Sherwood.” “Cut out your lies, Jimmie Carlisle!” Joe ordered harshly. “We\u0027ve got something more to do here, the four of us, than to waste any time on lies. And just to prove to you that your lies will be wasted, I\u0027ll lay all my cards face up on the table. Since I got out I\u0027ve been working for the Sherwoods. Larry Brainard was working there before me, and got me my job. I\u0027ve seen this girl here—my daughter that you\u0027ve made into a crook—out there twice. Dick Sherwood was supposed to be in love with her. At the end of this afternoon some officers came to the Sherwoods\u0027 and arrested Larry Brainard. I was working outside, overheard what was happening, and crept up on the porch. Officer Gavegan, who was in charge, found a painting among Larry Brainard\u0027s things. Miss Sherwood said that it was a picture of Miss Maggie Cameron who had been visiting there, and I could see that it was. Officer Gavegan said it was a picture of Maggie Carlisle, daughter of Jimmie Carlisle, and that she was a crook. Larry Brainard, cornered, had to admit that Gavegan was right. I guessed at once who Maggie Carlisle was, since she was just the age my girl would have been and since you never had any children. And that\u0027s how, Jimmie Carlisle, standing there outside the window,” concluded the terrible voice of Joe Ellison, “I learned for the first time that the baby I\u0027d trusted with you to be brought up straight, and that I believed was now happy somewhere as a nice, decent girl, you had really brought up as your own daughter and trained to be a crook!” Old Jimmie shrank back from Joe\u0027s blazing eyes; his mouth opened spasmodically, but no words came therefrom. There was stupendous silence in the room. Within the closet, Larry now understood that low, strange sound he had heard on the Sherwoods\u0027 porch and which Gavegan and Hunt had investigated. It had been the suppressed cry of Joe Ellison when he had learned the truth—the difference between his dreams and the reality. He could not imagine what that moment had been to Joe: the swift, unbelievable knowledge that had seemed to be tearing his very being apart. Larry had an impulse to step out to Joe\u0027s side. But just as a little earlier he had felt the scene had belonged to Maggie, he now felt that this situation, the greatest in Joe\u0027s life, belonged definitely to Joe, was almost sacredly Joe\u0027s own property. Also he felt that he was about to learn many things which had puzzled him. Therefore he held himself back, at the same time keeping his hold upon Red Hannigan. During this moment of silence, while Larry was wondering what was going to happen, his eyes also took in the figure of Maggie, all her powers of action and expression still paralyzed by appalling consternation. He understood, at least to a degree, what she was going through. He knew this much of her plan: that she had intended to cut loose in some way from Barney and Old Jimmie, and that she had intended that her father should continue to cherish the dream that had been his happiness for so long. And now her father had come upon her in the company of Barney and Old Jimmie and in a situation whose every superficial circumstance was such as to make him believe the worst of her! Joe turned on the smartly dressed Barney. “I\u0027ll take you first, you imitation swell, because I\u0027m saving Jimmie Carlisle to the last!” went on Joe\u0027s crunching voice. “I\u0027m going to twist your damned neck for what you\u0027ve helped do to my girl, but if you want to say anything first, say it.” Barney\u0027s response was a swift movement of his right hand toward his left armpit. But Barney Palmer, like almost all his kind, was a very indifferent gunman; and he had no knowledge of the reputation for masterful quickness that had been Joe Ellison\u0027s twenty years earlier. Before his compact automatic was fairly out of its holster beneath his armpit, it was in Joe Ellison\u0027s hands. “I sized you up for that kind of rat and was watching you,” continued Joe in his same awful grimness. “I\u0027m not going to shoot you, unless you make me. I\u0027m going to twist that pretty neck of yours. But first, out with anything you\u0027ve got to say for yourself!” “I haven\u0027t had anything to do with this business,” said Barney, trying to affect a bold manner. “You lie! I know that in this game against Dick Sherwood, in which you used my girl, you were the real leader!” “Well—even if I did use your girl, I only used her the way I found her.” “You lie again! I know how your kind work: cleverly putting crooked ideas into girls\u0027 minds, and exciting their imagination, so they\u0027ll work with you. Your case is closed.” He turned to his one-time friend. “What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmie Carlisle?” Old Jimmie believed that his last hour was come. He showed something of the defiant, almost maniacal courage of a coward who realizes he can retreat no farther. “What I got to say, Joe Ellison,” he snarled in a sudden rage which bared his yellow teeth, “is that I\u0027m even with you at last!” “Even with me? What for?” “For the way you double-crossed me in nineteen-one in that Gordon business. You never gave me a dime—said the thing had fallen down—yet I know there was a big haul!” “I told you the truth. That Gordon thing was a fizzle.” “There\u0027s where you\u0027re lying! It was a clean-up! And I knew you\u0027d been cheating me out of my share in other deals!” “You\u0027re absolutely wrong, Jimmie Carlisle. But if you thought that, why didn\u0027t you have it out with me at the time?” “Because I knew you would lie! You were a better talker than I was, and since our outfit always sided with you, I knew I wouldn\u0027t have a chance then. But I reasoned that if I kept quiet and kept on being your friend, I\u0027d get my chance to get even if I waited awhile. I waited—and I certainly got my chance!” “Go on, Jimmie Carlisle!” And Old Jimmie went on—a startlingly different Old Jimmie, his pent-up evil now loosed into quivering, malignant triumph; went on with the feverish exultation of a twisted, perverted mind that has brooded long over an imagined injustice, that has brooded greedily and long in private over his revenge, and at last has his chance to gloat in the open. “When you were sent away, Joe Ellison, and turned over your daughter to me with those orders about seeing that she was brought up as a decent girl, I began to see the big chance I\u0027d been waiting for. I asked myself, What is the dearest thing in the world to Joe Ellison? The answer was, this idea he\u0027d got about his girl. I asked myself, What is the biggest way I can get even with Joe Ellison? The answer was, to make Joe Ellison believe all the time he\u0027s in stir that his girl is growing up the way he wants her to be and yet to bring her up the exact thing he didn\u0027t want her to be. And that\u0027s exactly what I did!” “You—did—such a thing?” breathed Joe Ellison, almost incredulous. “That\u0027s exactly what I did!” Old Jimmie went on, gloatingly. “It was easy. No one knew you had a daughter, so I passed her off as my own baby by a marriage I\u0027d not told any one about. I saw that she always lived among crooks, looked at things the way crooks do, and grew up with no other thought than to be a crook. I never had an idea of using her myself, till she began to look like such a good performer this last year; and then my idea, no matter what Barney Palmer may have planned, was to use her only in a couple of stunts. My main idea always was, when you came out with your grand idea of what your girl had grown up to be, for you suddenly to see your girl, and know her as your girl, and know her to be a crook. That smash to you was the big thing to me—what I\u0027d planned for, and waited for. I didn\u0027t expect the blow-off to come like this; I didn\u0027t expect to be caught in it when it did happen. But since it has happened, well—There\u0027s your daughter, Joe Ellison! Look at her! Look at what I\u0027ve made her! I guess I\u0027m even all right!” “My God!” breathed Joe Ellison, staring at the lean face twisting with triumphant malignancy. “I didn\u0027t think there could be such a man!” He slowly turned upon Maggie. This was the first direct recognition he had taken of her since his entrance. “I don\u0027t suppose you can guess what your being what you are has meant to me,” he began in a numbed tone which grew accusingly harsh as he continued. “But I\u0027d think that a daughter of mine, with such a mother, would have had more instinctive sense than to have gone into such a game with such a pair of crooks!” “It\u0027s true—I have been what you think me—I did go into this thing against Dick Sherwood,” Maggie responded in a voice that at first was faltering, then that stumbled rapidly on in her eagerness to pour out all the facts. “But—but Larry Brainard had kept after me—and finally he made me see how wrong I was headed. And then, this afternoon, before I spoke to you, Larry told me that you were my real father. When I learned the truth—how I had been cheated out of being something else—how I was the exact opposite of what you had wanted me to be and believed me to be—I felt about it almost exactly as you feel about it. I—I made up my mind to clear up at once all the wrong I was responsible for—and then disappear in such a way that you\u0027d never have your dream of me spoiled. And so—and so this afternoon, after I left Cedar Crest, I confessed the whole truth to Dick Sherwood—about our plan to cheat him. And like the really splendid fellow he is, Dick Sherwood offered to help me set straight the things I wanted to set straight. Particularly to clear Larry Brainard. And so my being here as you find me is part of a plan between Dick Sherwood and myself. It\u0027s really a frame-up. A frame-up to catch Barney Palmer and Jimmie Carlisle.” “A frame-up!” ejaculated these two in startled unison. “How a frame-up?” demanded her father, no bit of the accusing harshness gone out of his voice. “Our plan against Dick Sherwood was to have him propose to me, then for me to confess that I was really married to a mean sort of man I didn\u0027t love—the idea being that Dick would be infatuated enough to pay a big sum to a dummy husband, and the three of us would disappear as soon as we got Dick\u0027s money. Dick offered to go through with the plan as Barney Palmer and Jimmie Carlisle had shaped it up—go through with it to-night—and then after money had passed, we\u0027d have a criminal case against them. By reminding him that Larry Brainard knew just what we were up to, and might spoil everything if we didn\u0027t act at once, I got Barney Palmer worked up to the point where he was going to pose as my husband and take the money. Dick Sherwood was to come a little later, after he\u0027d first telephoned me, with a big roll of marked money.” There were stuttered exclamations from Barney and Old Jimmie, which were cut off by the dominant incisiveness of Joe Ellison\u0027s words to his daughter: “I think you\u0027re lying to me! Besides, even if you\u0027re telling the truth, it\u0027s a pretty way you\u0027ve taken to clear things up! Don\u0027t you see that by letting Dick Sherwood come here and play such a part, you\u0027d be dead sure to involve him and his family in a dirty police story that the papers of the whole country would play up as a sensation? It\u0027s plain to any one that that\u0027s no way a person who wanted to square things would use Dick Sherwood. And that\u0027s why I think you\u0027re lying!” “I had thought of that—you\u0027re right,” said Maggie. “And so I wasn\u0027t going to do it. He was going to telephone me—just about this time—and when he called up I was going to fake his message. I was going to tell Barney Palmer and Old Jimmie that Dick had just telephoned he wasn\u0027t coming, because one of the two had just sold him a tip for ten thousand dollars that this was a crooked game. I thought this would have started a quarrel between the two; they are suspicious of each other, anyhow. Each would have accused the other, and in their quarrel they would have been likely to have let out a lot of truth that would have completely given each other away.” “Not a bad plan at all,” commented Joe Ellison. He tried to peer deep into his daughter for a moment, his inflamed face relaxing neither in its harshness nor its doubt of her. “But since you are the clever crook I actually know you to be from your work on Dick Sherwood, and since Jimmie Carlisle says he has trained you to be a crook, I believe that everything you\u0027ve told me is just something you\u0027ve cleverly invented on the spur of the moment—just so many lies.” “But—but—” She broke off before the harsh, accusing doubt of his pale face. For a fraction of a moment no one spoke. Then the telephone bell began to ring. “Dick!” breathed Maggie, and started for the telephone. “Stay right where you are!” her father ordered. “I\u0027ll answer that telephone myself, and see whether you\u0027re lying to me about Dick Sherwood!... No, we\u0027ll do this together. I\u0027ll hold the receiver and hear what he says. You\u0027ll do the talking and you\u0027ll answer just what I tell you to, and you\u0027ll keep your hand tight over the mouthpiece while I\u0027m giving you your orders. You two”—to Barney and Old Jimmie, with a significant movement of Barney\u0027s automatic—“you\u0027d better behave while this telephone business is going on.” The next moment Larry was hearing, or rather witnessing, the strangest telephone conversation of his experience. Maggie was holding the transmitter, and Joe had the receiver at his ears, grimly covering the two men with the automatic. Maggie obediently kept her palm tight over the mouthpiece during Joe\u0027s brief whispered directions, and no one in the room except Joe, not even Maggie, had the slightest idea of what was really passing over the wires. What Larry heard was no more than a dozen most commonplace words in the world, transformed into the most absorbing words in the language. Joe ordered Maggie to answer with “hello” in her usual tone, which she did, and Joe, after a startled expression at the first words that came over the wire, listened with immobile face for four or five seconds. Then he nodded imperatively to Maggie and she put her hand over the mouthpiece. “Ask him how much, and when he wanted it to be paid,” he ordered. “How much, and when does he want it to be paid?” repeated Maggie. Again Joe listened for several moments; and then ordered as before: “Say \u0027Yes.\u0027” “Yes,” said Maggie. Another period of waiting, and Joe ordered: “Say, \u0027I\u0027ve got a much better plan that supersedes the old.\u0027” “I\u0027ve got a much better plan that supersedes the old.” There was yet another period of waiting, then Joe commanded: “Tell him he really mustn\u0027t and say good-bye quick.” “You really mustn\u0027t! Good-bye!” The instant her “Good-bye” was out of her mouth Joe clicked the receiver upon its hook, and stood regarding the breathless Maggie. His pale, stern face was not quite so severe as before. Presently he spoke: “I know now that you really were sick of what you\u0027d been trying to do—that you\u0027d really broken away from these two—that you\u0027d really confessed to Dick, and are now all square with him.” The word “Father!” struggled chokingly toward her lips. But she only said: “I\u0027m glad—you know.” “And you were shrewd in that guess you made of what one of these two would do.” Joe crossed back to Barney and Old Jimmie. “You two must have been almighty afraid, because of Larry Brainard, that your game was suddenly collapsing, and each must have been trying to grab a piece for himself before he ran away.” “What you talking about?” gruffly demanded Barney. “Perhaps I\u0027m talking about you. But more particularly about Jimmie Carlisle. For just now Dick Sherwood said when he telephoned, that an hour or two ago Jimmie Carlisle had hunted him up, had hinted that he was going to lose a lot of money unless he was properly advised, and offered to give him certain valuable information for five thousand cash.” Barney turned upon his partner. “You damned thief!” he snarled, tensed as if about to spring upon the other. Old Jimmie, turned greenishly pale, shrank away from Barney, his every expression proclaiming his guilt. Then Maggie again found her voice: “And at about the same time Barney was trying to double-cross Jimmie Carlisle, Barney proposed to me that, after we\u0027d got Dick Sherwood\u0027s money, we\u0027d tell Jimmie Carlisle we\u0027d got very little, and divide the real money fifty-fifty between just us two.” “You damned thief!” snarled Old Jimmie back at his partner. The next moment Barney and Old Jimmie were upon each other, striking wildly, clawing. But the moment after Joe Ellison, his repressed rage now unloosed, and with the super-strength of his supreme fury, had torn the two apart. “You don\u0027t do that to each other—that job belongs to me!” he cried. His right arm flung Barney backward so that Barney went staggering over himself and sprawled upon the floor. Joe gripped Old Jimmie\u0027s collar, and his right hand painfully twisted Jimmie\u0027s arm. “And I finish you off first, Jimmie Carlisle, for what you\u0027ve done to me and my girl! But for Larry Brainard you, Jimmie Carlisle, would have succeeded in your scheme to make my girl a crook! I\u0027d like to give you a thousand years of agony, you damned rat—but that\u0027s beyond me!” His right hand shifted swiftly from Old Jimmie\u0027s arm to his throat. “But I\u0027m going to choke your rat\u0027s life out of you!—your lying, sneaking devil\u0027s life out of you!” Old Jimmie squirmed and twisted with those long fingers clamped mercilessly around his throat, his eyes rolling, and his mouth gaping with voiceless cries. He was indeed being shaken as a rat might be shaken. “Don\u0027t!—Don\u0027t!” cried the frantic Maggie, and started to seize her father to pull him away. But she was halted by her arm being caught by Barney. “Let Jimmie have it!” he said fiercely to her, and flung her to the farthest corner of the room. And grimly exultant over what seemed to be Old Jimmie\u0027s doom, he started for the door to make his own escape. Up to the moment of Joe Ellison\u0027s eruption Larry had felt bound to remain a mere spectator where he was: long as the time had seemed to him, it had in fact been less than half an hour. He had felt bound at first by his promise to Maggie to let her work out her plan; and bound later by his sense that this situation belonged to Joe Ellison. But now this swift crisis dissolved all such obligations. He sprang from his closet to take his part in the drama that was so swiftly unfolding.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2142/60594.html","bookId":618,"book":{"id":618,"title":"Children of the Whirlwind","description":"简介： It was an uninspiring bit of street: narrow, paved with cobble; hot and noisy in summer, reeking with unwholesome mud during the drizzling and snow-slimed months of winter.
