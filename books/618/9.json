{"id":22487,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX","content":"Maggie, as she mounted to her room, was hardly conscious of the ring of menace in Barney\u0027s voice; but once she was in bed, his tone and his words came back to her and stirred a strange uneasiness in her mind. Barney was angry; Barney was cunning; Barney would stop at nothing to gain his ends. What might be behind his threatening words? \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning as she was coming in with milk for her breakfast coffee, she met Larry in the Duchess\u0027s room behind the pawnshop. He smilingly planted himself squarely in her way. \\n\\n \\n\\n “See here, Maggie—aren\u0027t you ever going to speak to a fellow?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Something within her surged up impelling her to tell him of Barney\u0027s savage yet unformulated threat. The warning got as far as her tongue, and there halted, struggling. \\n\\n \\n\\n Her strange, fixed look startled Larry. “Why, what\u0027s the matter, Maggie?” he exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n But her pride, her settled determination to unbend to him in no way and to have no dealings with him, were stronger than her impulse; and the struggling warning remained unuttered. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nothing\u0027s the matter,” she said, and brushed past him and hurried up the stairway. \\n\\n \\n\\n At times during the day, while tutoring with Mr. Bronson, Larry thought of Maggie\u0027s strange look. And his mind was upon it late in the afternoon when he entered the little street. But as he neared his grandmother\u0027s house all such thought was banished by Detective Gavegan of the Central Office stepping from the pawnshop and blocking the door with his big figure. There was grim, triumphant purpose on the hard features of Gavegan, conceited by nature and trained to harsh dominance by long rule as a petty autocrat. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Hello, Gavegan,” Larry greeted him pleasantly. “Gee, but you look tickled! Did the Duchess give you a bigger loan than you expected on the Carnegie medal you just hocked?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You\u0027ll soon be cuttin\u0027 out your line of comedy.” Gavegan slipped his left arm through Larry\u0027s right. “You\u0027re comin\u0027 along with me, and you\u0027d better come quiet.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Larry stiffened. “Come where?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Headquarters.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I haven\u0027t done a thing, Gavegan, and you know it! What do you want me for?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Me and the Chief had a little talk about you,” leered Gavegan. “And now the Chief wants to have a little personal talk with you. He asked me to round you up and bring you in.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027ve done nothing, and I\u0027ll not go!” Larry cried hotly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, yes, you will!” Gavegan withdrew his right hand from his coat pocket where it had been resting in readiness. In the hand, its thong about his wrist, was a short leather-covered object filled with lead. “I\u0027ve got my orders, and you\u0027ll come peaceably, or—But I\u0027d just as soon you\u0027d resist, for I owe you something for the punch you slipped over on me the other night.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Larry, taut with the desire to strike, gazed for a moment into the glowering face of the detective. Gavegan, gripping his right arm, with that bone-crushing slug-shot itching for instant use, was apparently master in the present circumstances. But before Larry\u0027s quick mind had decided upon a course, the door of the pawnshop opened and closed, and a voice said sharply: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nothing doing on that rough stuff, Gavegan!” The speaker was now on Larry\u0027s left side, a heavy-faced man in a black derby. “Larry, better be a nice boy and come with us.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, it\u0027s you, Casey!” said Larry. “If you say I\u0027ve got to go, I\u0027ll go—for you\u0027re one white copper, even if you do have Gavegan for a partner. Come on. What\u0027re we standing here for?” \\n\\n \\n\\n The trio made their way out of the narrow street, and after some fifteen minutes of walking through the twisting byways of that part of the city, they passed through the granite doorway at Headquarters and entered the office of Deputy Commissioner Barlow, Chief of the Detective Bureau. Barlow was talking over the telephone in a growling staccato, and the three men sat down. After a moment Barlow banged the receiver upon its hook, and turned upon them. He had a clenched, driving face, with small, commanding eyes. It was his boast that he got results, that it was his policy to make people do what you told \u0027em. He had no other code. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, Brainard,” he snapped, “here you are again. What you up to now?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Going to try the straight game, Chief,” returned Larry. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Don\u0027t try to put that old bunk over on me!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It\u0027s not bunk, Chief. It\u0027s the real stuff.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Cut it out, I say! Don\u0027t you suppose I had a clever bird like you picked up the minute you landed in the city, and have had you covered ever since? And if you are going straight, what about the session you had with Barney Palmer and Old Jimmie Carlisle the very night you blew in? And I\u0027m on to this bluff of your going to that business institute. So come across, Brainard! I\u0027ve got your every move covered!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027ve already come across, Chief,” replied Larry, trying to keep his temper in the face of the other\u0027s bullying manner. “I told Barney and Old Jimmie that I was through with the old game, and through with them as pals at the old game—that\u0027s all there was to that meeting. I\u0027m going to that business institute for the same reason that every other person goes there—to learn. That\u0027s all there is to the whole business, Chief: I\u0027m going to go straight.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Chief Barlow, hunched forward, his undershot jaw clenched on a cigar stub, regarded Larry steadily with his beady, autocratic eyes. Barlow was trained to penetrate to the inside of men\u0027s minds, and he recognized that Larry was in earnest. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You mean you think you are going to go straight,” Barlow remarked slowly and meaningly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I know I am going to go straight,” Larry returned evenly, meeting squarely the gaze of the Chief of Detectives. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Do you realize, young man,” Barlow continued in the same measured, significant tone, “that whether you go straight, and how you go straight, depends pretty much on me?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Mind making that a little clearer, Chief?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027ll show you part of my hand—just remember that I\u0027m holding back my high cards. I don\u0027t believe you\u0027re going to go straight, so we\u0027ll start with the proposition that you\u0027re not going to run straight and work on from there. You\u0027re clever, Brainard—I hand you that; and all the classy crooks trust you. That\u0027s why I had picked you out for what I wanted long before you left stir. Brainard, you\u0027re wise enough to know that some of our best pinches come from tips handed us from the inside. Brainard”—the slow voice had now become incisive, mandatory—“you\u0027re not going to go straight. You\u0027re going to string along with Barney and Old Jimmie and the rest of the bunch—we\u0027ll protect you—and you\u0027re going to slip us tips when something big is about to be pulled off.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Larry, experienced with police methods though he was, could hardly believe this thing which was being proposed to him, Larry Brainard. But he controlled himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n “If I get you, Chief, you are suggesting that I become a police stool?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Exactly. We\u0027ll never tip your hand. And any little thing you pull off on your own we\u0027ll not bother you about. And, besides, we\u0027ll slip you a little dough regular on the quiet.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And all you want me to do in exchange,” Larry asked quietly, “is to hand up my pals?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “That\u0027s all.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Larry found it required his all of strength to control himself; but he did. \\n\\n \\n\\n “There are only three small objections to your proposition, Chief.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “The first is, I shall not be a stool.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “What\u0027s that?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And the second is, I wouldn\u0027t squeal on a pal to you even if I were a crook. And the third is what I said in the beginning: I\u0027m not going to be a crook.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Barlow\u0027s squat, powerful figure arose menacingly. Casey also stood up. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I tell you you ARE going to be a crook!” Barlow\u0027s big fist crashed down on his desk in a tremendous exclamation point. “And you\u0027re going to work for me exactly as I tell you!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I have already given you my final word,” said Larry. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You—you—” Barlow almost choked at this quiet defiance. His face turned red, his breath came in a fluttering snarl, his powerful shoulders hunched up as if he were about to strike. But he held back his physical blows. \\n\\n \\n\\n “That\u0027s your ultimatum?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “If you care to call it so—yes.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then here\u0027s mine! I told you I was holding back my high cards. Either you do as I say, and work with Gavegan and Casey, or you\u0027ll not be able to hold a job in New York! My men will see to that. And here\u0027s another high card. You do as I\u0027ve said, or I\u0027ll hang some charge on you, one that\u0027ll stick, and back up the river you\u0027ll go for another stretch! There\u0027s an ultimatum for you to think about!” \\n\\n \\n\\n It certainly was. Larry gazed into the harsh, glaring face, set in fierce determination. He knew that Barlow, as part of his policy, loved to break down the spirit of criminals; and he knew that nothing so roused Barlow as opposition from a man he considered in his power. Close beside the Chief he saw the gloating, malignant face of Gavegan; Casey, who had been restless since the beginning of the scene, had moved to the window and was gazing down into Center Street. \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment Larry did not reply. Barlow mistook Larry\u0027s silence for wavering, or the beginning of an inclination to yield. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You turn that over in your noodle,” Barlow drove on. “You\u0027re going to go crooked, anyhow, so you might as well go crooked in the only way that\u0027s safe for you. I\u0027m going to have Gavegan and Casey watch you, and if in the next few days you don\u0027t begin to string along with Barney and Old Jimmie and that bunch, and if you don\u0027t get me word that your answer to my proposition is \u0027yes,\u0027 hell\u0027s going to fall on you! Now get out of here!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Larry got out. He was liquid lava of rage inside; but he had had enough to do with police power to know that it would help him not at all to permit an eruption against a police official while he was in the very heart of the police stronghold. \\n\\n \\n\\n He walked back toward his own street in a fury, beneath which was subconsciously an element of uneasiness: an uneasiness which would have been instantly roused to caution had he known that Barney Palmer had this hour and more been following him in a taxicab, and that across the street from the car\u0027s window Barney\u0027s sharp face had watched him enter Police Headquarters and had watched him emerge. \\n\\n \\n\\n Home reached, Larry briefly recounted his experience at Headquarters to Hunt and the Duchess. The painter whistled; the Duchess blinked and said nothing at all. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Maggie was more right than she knew when she first said you were facing a tough proposition!” exclaimed Hunt. “Believe me, young fellow, you\u0027re certainly up against it!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Can you beat it for irony!” said Larry, pacing the floor. “A man wants to go straight. His pals ask him to be a crook, and are sore because he won\u0027t be a crook. The police ask him to be a crook, and threaten him because he doesn\u0027t want to be a crook. Some situation!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Some situation!” repeated Hunt. “What\u0027re you going to do?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Do?” Larry halted, his face set with defiant determination. “I\u0027m going to keep on doing exactly what I\u0027ve been doing! And they can all go to hell!” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2142/60568.html","bookId":618,"book":{"id":618,"title":"Children of the Whirlwind","description":"简介： It was an uninspiring bit of street: narrow, paved with cobble; hot and noisy in summer, reeking with unwholesome mud during the drizzling and snow-slimed months of winter.
