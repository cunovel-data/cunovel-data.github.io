{"id":22482,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV","content":"While the preparations for dinner were going on in the studio, down below Larry turned a corner and swung up the narrow street toward the pawnshop. He halted and peered in before entering; in doing this he was obeying the caution that was his by instinct and training. \n \n Leaning over the counter within, and chatting with his grandmother\u0027s assistant was Casey, one of the two plain-clothesmen who had arrested him. Larry drew back. He was not afraid of Casey, or of Gavegan, Casey\u0027s partner, or of the whole police force, or of the State of New York; they had nothing on him, he had settled accounts by having done his bit. All the same, he preferred not to meet Casey just then. So he went down the street, crossed the cobbled plaza along the water-front, and slipped through the darkness among the trucks out to the end of the pier. Under his feet the East River splashed sluggishly against the piles, but out near the river\u0027s center he could see the tide swirling out to sea at six miles an hour, toward the great shadowy Manhattan Bridge crested with its splendid tiara of lights. \n \n He stretched himself and breathed deeply of the warm free spring. It tasted good after two long years of the prison\u0027s sealed air. He would have liked to shed his clothing and dive down for a brisk fight with the tingling water. Larry had always taken pleasure in keeping his body fit. He had not cared for the gymnasiums of the ward clubs where he would have been welcome; in them there had been too much rough horseplay and foulness of mouth, and such had always been offensive to him. And though he had ever looked the gentleman, he had known that the New York Athletic Club and other similar clubs were not for him; they pried a bit too much into a candidate\u0027s social and professional standing. So he had turned to a club where really searching inquiries were rarely made; for years he had belonged to a branch of the Y.M.C.A. located just off Broadway, and had played handball and boxed with chunky, slow-footed city detectives who were struggling to retain some physical activity, and with fat playwrights, and with Jewish theatrical managers, and with the few authentic Christians who occasionally strayed into the place and seemed ill at ease therein. He had liked this club for another reason; his sense of humor had often been highly excited by the thought of his being a member of the Y.M.C.A. \n \n Having this instinct for physical fitness, he had not greatly minded being a coal-passer during the greater part of his stay at Sing Sing; better that than working in the knitting mills; so that now, though underfed and under weight, he was active and hard-muscled. \n \n Larry Brainard could not have told why, and just when, he had turned to devious ways. He had never put that part of his life under the microscope. But the simple facts were that he had become an orphan at fifteen and a broker\u0027s clerk at nineteen after a course in a business college; and that experiences with wash-sales and such devious and dubious practices of brokers, his high spirits, his instinct for pleasure, his desire for big winnings—these had swept him into a wild crowd before he had been old enough to take himself seriously, and had started him upon a brilliant career of adventures and unlawful money-making in whose excitement there had been no let-up until his arrest. He had never thought about such technical and highly academic subjects as right and wrong up to the day when Casey and Gavegan had slipped the handcuffs upon him. To laugh, to dance, to plan and direct clever coups, to spend the proceeds gayly and lavishly—to challenge the police with another daring coup: that had been life to him, a game that was all excitement. \n \n And now, after two years in which there had been plenty of time for thinking, his conscience still did not trouble him on the score of his offenses. He believed, and was largely right in this belief, that the suckers he had trimmed had all been out to secure unlawful gain and to take cunning advantage of his supposedly foolish self and of other dupes. He had been too clever for them, that was all; in desire and intent they had been as great cheats as himself. So he felt no remorse over his victims; and as for anything he may have done against that impersonal entity, the criminal statutes, why, the period in prison had squared all such matters. So he now faced life pleasantly and with care-free soul. \n \n Larry had turned away from the dark river and had started to retrace his way, when he saw a man approaching through the darkness. Larry paused. The man drew near and halted exactly in front of Larry. By the swing of his body Larry had recognized the man, and his own figure instinctively grew tense. \n \n “What you doin\u0027 out here, Brainard?” The voice was peremptory and rough. \n \n “Throwing kisses over at Brooklyn,” Larry replied coolly. “And what are you doing out here, Gavegan?” \n \n “Following you. I wanted a quiet word with you. I\u0027ve been right behind you ever since you hit New York.” \n \n “I knew you would be. You and Casey. But you haven\u0027t got anything on me.” \n \n “I got plenty on you before!—with Casey helping,” retorted Gavegan. “And I\u0027ll get plenty on you again!—now that I know you are the main guy of a clever outfit. You\u0027ll be starting some smooth game—but I\u0027m going to be right after you every minute. And I\u0027ll get you. That\u0027s the news I wanted to slip you.” \n \n “So!” commented Larry drawlingly. “Casey\u0027s a fairly decent guy, considering his line—but, Gavegan, I don\u0027t see how Casey stands you as a partner. And, Gavegan, I don\u0027t see why the Board of Health lets you stay around the streets—when putrefying matter causes so much disease.” \n \n “None of your lip, young feller!” growled Gavegan. He stepped closer, bulking over Larry. “You think you are such a damned smart talker and such a damned clever schemer—but I\u0027ll bet I\u0027ll have you locked up in six months.” \n \n Anger boiled up within Larry. Against all the persons connected with his arrest, trial, and imprisonment, he had no particular resentment, except against this one man. He never could forget the time he and Gavegan, he handcuffed, had been locked in a sound-proof cell, and Gavegan had given him the third degree—in this case a length of heavy rubber hose, applied with a powerful arm upon head and shoulders—in an effort to make him squeal upon his confederates. And that third degree was merely a sample of the material of which Gavegan was made. \n \n Larry held his desire in leash. “So you bet you\u0027ll get me. I\u0027ll take that bet—any figure you like. I\u0027ve already got a new game cooked up, Gavegan. Cleverer than anything I\u0027ve ever tried before.” \n \n “Oh, I\u0027ll get you!” Gavegan growled again. \n \n “Oh, no, you won\u0027t!” And then Larry\u0027s old anger against Gavegan got into his tongue and made it wag tauntingly. “You didn\u0027t get me the last time; that was a slip and police stools got me. All by yourself, Gavegan, you couldn\u0027t get anything. Your brain\u0027s got flat tires, and its motor doesn\u0027t fire, and its clutch is broken. The only thing about it that still works is the horn. You\u0027ve got a hell of a horn, Gavegan, and it never stops blowing.” \n \n A tug was nearing the dock, and by its light Larry saw the terrific swing that the enraged detective started. Larry swayed slightly aside, and as Gavegan lunged by, Larry\u0027s right fist drove into Gavegan\u0027s chin—drove with all the power of his dislike and all the strength of five years in a Y.M.C.A. gymnasium and a year in a prison boiler-room. \n \n Gavegan went down and out. \n \n Larry gazed a moment at the dim, sprawling figure, then turned and made his way off the pier and again to the door of the pawnshop. Casey was gone; he could see no one within but Old Isaac, the assistant. \n \n Larry opened the door and entered. “Hello, Isaac. Where\u0027s grandmother?” \n \n It is not a desirable trait in one connected with a pawnshop, that is also reputed to be a fence, to show surprise or curiosity. So Isaac\u0027s reply was confined to a few facts and brief direction. \n \n Wondering, Larry mounted the stairway which opened from the confidential business room behind the pawnshop. It was common enough for his grandmother to rent out the third floor; but to a painter, and a crazy painter—that seemed strange. And yet more strange was it for her to be having dinner with the painter. \n \n Larry knocked at the door. A big male voice within gave order: \n \n “Be parlor-maid, Maggie, and see who\u0027s there.” \n \n The door opened and Larry half entered. Then he stopped, and in surprise gazed at the flushed, gleaming Maggie, slender and supple in the folds of the Spanish shawl. \n \n “Why, Maggie!” he exclaimed, holding out his hand. \n \n “Larry!” \n \n She was thrillingly confused by his surprised admiration. For a moment they stood gazing at each other, holding hands. The clothes given him on leaving prison were of course atrocious, but in all else he measured up to her dreams: lithe, well-built, handsome, a laugh ready on his lips, and the very devil of daring in his smiling, gray-blue eyes. \n \n “How you have grown up, Maggie!” he said, still amazed. \n \n “That\u0027s all I\u0027ve had to do for two years,” she returned. \n \n “Come on in, Larry,” said the Duchess. \n \n Larry shut the door, bowed with light grace as he had to pass in front of Maggie, and crossed to the Duchess. \n \n “Hello, grandmother,” he said as though he had last seen her the day before. He held out his hand, the left one, and she took it in a mummified claw. In all his life he had never kissed his grandmother, nor did he remember ever having been kissed by her. \n \n “Glad you\u0027re back, Larry.” She dropped his hand. “The man\u0027s name is Hunt.” \n \n Larry turned to the painter. His laughing eyes could be sharp; they were penetratingly sharp now. And so were Hunt\u0027s eyes. \n \n Larry held out his hand, again the left. “And so you\u0027re the painter?” \n \n “They call me a painter,” responded Hunt, “but none of them believe I\u0027m a painter.” \n \n Larry turned again to Maggie. “And so you\u0027re actually Maggie! Meaning no offense”—and there was a smiling audacity in his face that it would have been hard to have taken offense at—“I don\u0027t see how Old Jimmie Carlisle\u0027s daughter got such looks without stealing them.” \n \n “Well, then,” retorted Maggie, “I don\u0027t see how you got your looks unless—” \n \n She broke off and bit her tongue. She had been about to retort with the contrast between Larry\u0027s face and his shriveled, hook-nosed grandmother\u0027s. They all perceived her intention, however. \n \n Larry came instantly to her rescue with almost imperceptible ease. \n \n “Dinner!” he exclaimed, gazing at the miscellany of dishes on the table. “Am I invited?” \n \n “Invited?” said Hunt. “You\u0027re the guest of honor.” \n \n “Then might the guest of honor beg the privilege of cleaning up a bit?” Larry drew his right hand from his coat pocket, where it had been all this while, and started to unwind the handkerchief which he had wound about his knuckles as he had crossed from the pier. \n \n “Is your hand hurt much?” Maggie inquired eagerly. \n \n “Just skinned my knuckles.” \n \n “How?” \n \n “They happened to connect with a flatfoot\u0027s jaw while he was trying to make hypnotic passes at me. He\u0027s coming to about now. Officer Gavegan.” \n \n “Gavegan!” exclaimed Hunt. “You picked a tough bird. Young man, you\u0027re off to a grand start—a charge of assault on an officer the very day they turn you out of jail.” \n \n Larry smiled. “Gavegan is a dirty one, but he\u0027ll make no charge of assault. He claims to be heavy-weight champion boxer of the Police Department. Put a fine crimp in his reputation, wouldn\u0027t it, if he admitted in public that he\u0027d been knocked out by a fellow, bare-handed, supposed to be weak from prison life, forty pounds lighter. He\u0027d get the grand razoo all along the line. Oh, Gavegan will never let out a peep.” \n \n “He\u0027ll square things in some other way,” said Hunt. \n \n “I suppose he\u0027ll try,” Larry responded carelessly. “Where\u0027s the first-aid room?” \n \n Hunt showed him through the curtains. When he came out, Hunt, Maggie, and the Duchess were all engaged in getting the dinner upon the table. Additional help would only be interference, so Larry\u0027s eyes wandered casually to the canvases standing in the shadows against the walls. \n \n “Mr. Hunt,” he remarked, “you seem to have earned a very real reputation of its sort in the neighborhood. Old Isaac downstairs told me you were crazy—said they called you \u0027Nuts\u0027—said you were the worst painter that ever happened.” \n \n “Yeh, that\u0027s what they say,” agreed Hunt. \n \n “They certainly are awful, Larry,” put in Maggie, coming to his side. “Father thinks they are jokes, and father certainly knows pictures. Just look at a few of them.” \n \n “Yeh, look at \u0027em and have a good laugh,” invited Hunt. \n \n Larry carried the portrait of the Duchess to beneath the swinging electric bulb and examined it closely. Maggie, at his shoulder, waited for his mirth; and Hunt regarded him with a sidelong gaze. But Larry did not laugh. He silently returned the picture, and then examined the portrait of Old Jimmie—then of Maggie—then of the Italian madonna, throned on her curbstone. He replaced this last and crossed swiftly to Hunt. Maggie watched this move in amazement. \n \n Larry faced the big painter. His figure was tense, his features hard with suspicion. That moment one could understand why he was sometimes called “Terrible Larry”; just then he looked a devastating explosion that was still unexploded. \n \n “What\u0027s your game down here, Hunt?” he demanded harshly. \n \n “My game?” repeated the big painter. “I don\u0027t get you.” \n \n “Yes, you do! You\u0027re down here posing as a boob who smears up canvases!” \n \n “What\u0027s wrong with that?” \n \n “Only this: those are not crazy daubs. They\u0027re real pictures!” \n \n “Eh!” exclaimed Hunt. Maggie stared in bewilderment at the two men. \n \n Hunt spoke again. “What the dickens do you know about pictures? Old Jimmie, who\u0027s said to be a shark, thinks all these things are just comics.” \n \n “Jimmie only thinks a picture\u0027s good after a thousand press-agents have said it\u0027s good,” Larry returned. “I studied at the Academy of Design for two years, till I learned I could never paint. But I know pictures.” \n \n “And you think mine are good?” \n \n “Not in the popular manner—they\u0027re too original. But they\u0027re great. And you\u0027re a great painter. And I want to know—” \n \n “Hurray!” shouted Hunt, and flung an enthusiastic arm about Larry, and began to pound his back. “Oh, boy! Oh, boy!” \n \n Larry wrenched himself free. “Cut that out. Then you admit you\u0027re a great painter?” \n \n “Of course I\u0027m a great painter!” shouted Hunt. “Who should know it better than I do?” \n \n “Then what\u0027s a great painter doing down here? What\u0027s the game you\u0027re trying to put over, posing as—” \n \n “Listen, son,” Hunt grinned. “You\u0027ve called me and I\u0027ve got to show my cards. Only you mustn\u0027t ever tell—nor must Maggie; the Duchess doesn\u0027t talk, anyway. No need bothering you just now with a lot of details about myself. It\u0027s enough to say that people wouldn\u0027t pay me except when I did the usual pretty rot; no one believed in the other stuff I wanted to do. I wanted to get away from that bunch; I wanted to do real studies of human people, with their real nature showing through. So I beat it. Understand so far?” \n \n “But why pose as a dub down here?” \n \n “I never started the yarn that I was a dub. The people who looked at my work, and laughed, started that talk. I didn\u0027t shout out that I was a great artist for the mighty good reason that if I had, and had been believed, the people who posed for me either wouldn\u0027t have done it or would have been so self-conscious that they would have tried to look like some one else, and would never have shown me themselves at all. Thinking me a joke, they just acted natural. Which, young man, is about all you need to know.” \n \n Maggie looked on breathlessly at the two men, bewildered by this new light in which Hunt was presented, and fascinated by the tense alertness of her hero, Larry. \n \n Slowly Larry\u0027s tensity dissipated. “I don\u0027t know about the rest of your make-up,” he said slowly, “but as a painter you\u0027re a whale.” \n \n “The rest of him\u0027s all right, too,” put in the dry, unemotional voice of the Duchess. “Dinner\u0027s ready. Come on.” \n \n As they moved to the table Hunt clapped a big hand on Larry\u0027s shoulder. “And to think,” he chuckled, “it took a crook fresh from Sing Sing to discover me as a great artist! You\u0027re clever, Larry—clever! Maggie, get the corkscrew into action and fill the glasses with the choicest vintage of H2O. A toast. Here\u0027s to Larry!” \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2142/60563.html","bookId":618,"book":{"id":618,"title":"Children of the Whirlwind","description":"简介： It was an uninspiring bit of street: narrow, paved with cobble; hot and noisy in summer, reeking with unwholesome mud during the drizzling and snow-slimed months of winter.
