{"id":69329,"no":142,"title":"Page 142","content":"Somebody wearing a black ski mask is sitting in a swivel chair next to the examination table, screaming at the mannequin in what sounds like Japanese. Bruce sits nearby, staring intently at a metal box, his hands poised over the two levers that protrude from either side. Bentley Harrolds camcords the proceedings-the camera aimed solely at the mannequin. I\u0027m smiling, confused, weirded out at how focused Bentley seems and shocked at how gruesome and inauthentic the waxwork looks. The figure in the black ski mask keeps shouting in Japanese, then signals to Bruce. Bruce nods grimly and moves his hand to a lever, pressing it, causing lights to flicker, and in a flash my eyes move from the wires connected to the box over to where they have actually been inserted into gashes and cuts on what I\u0027m just realizing are the mannequin\u0027s ni**les, fingers, testicles, ears. The mannequin springs grotesquely to life in the freezing room, screeching, arching its body up, again and again, lifting itself off the examination table, tendons in its neck straining, and purple foam starts pouring out of its anus, which also has a wire, larger, thicker, inserted into it. Bunched around the wheels on the table legs are white towels spotted heavily with blood, some of it black. What looks like an intestine is slowly emerging, of its own accord, from another, wider slit across the mannequin\u0027s belly. There is, I\u0027m noticing, no camera crew around. I drop the Evian bottle, startled, causing Bentley to glance over at where I\u0027m standing. Behind me, Jamie screams, \"Get him out of here!\" Sam Ho is making noises I have never heard another person make before, and in between these arias of pain he\u0027s screaming, \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m sorry,\" and the figure in the swivel chair rolls out of view of the camcorder and takes off the ski mask. Sweaty and exhausted, Bobby Hughes mutters-I\u0027m not sure to whom-the words \"Kill him\" and then, to Bentley, \"Keep rolling.\" Bruce stands and with a small sharp knife swiftly slices off Sam Ho\u0027s penis. He dies screaming for his mother, blood shooting out of him like a fountain until there\u0027s none left. Somebody cuts the lights. I\u0027m trying to leave the room but Bobby blocks my exit and my eyes are closed and I\u0027m chanting \"please man please man please man,\" hyperventilating, breaking out into sobs. Someone who might be Jamie is attempting to hug me. 1 \"Victor,\" Bobby\u0027s saying. \"Victor, come on... come on, man, it\u0027s cool. Stand up-that\u0027s it.\" We\u0027re in one of the ash-gray bedrooms upstairs. I\u0027m on the floor hugging Bobby\u0027s legs, convulsing, unable to stop myself from moaning. Bobby keeps feeding me Xanax and for short stretches of time the shuddering subsides. But then I\u0027m in the bathroom-Bobby waiting patiently outside-vomiting until I\u0027m just gagging up spit, retching. When I\u0027m through I lie there in a fetal position, my face pressed against the tiles, breathing erratically, hoping he\u0027ll leave me alone. But then he\u0027s kneeling beside me, whispering my name, trying to prop me up, and I keep clutching him, weeping. He places another pill in my mouth and leads me back into the bedroom, where he forces me to sit on the bed while he leans over me. Sometime during all this my shirt came off, and I keep clawing at my chest, grabbing myself so hard that patches of skin are reddened, on the verge of bruising. \"Shhh,\" he says. \"It\u0027s okay, Victor, it\u0027s okay.\" \"It\u0027s not okay,\" I blurt out, sobbing. \"It\u0027s not okay, Bobby.\" \"No, it is, Victor,\" Bobby says. \"It\u0027s cool. You\u0027re gonna be cool, okay?\" \"Okay,\" I\u0027m sniffling. \"Okay okay man.\" \"Good, that\u0027s good,\" Bobby says. \"Just keep breathing in like that, just relax.\" \"Okay man, okay man.\" \"Now listen to me,\" Bobby says. \"There are some things that you need to know.\" He\u0027s handing me a tissue, which I can\u0027t help tearing apart the second my fingers touch it. \"I just want to go home,\" I\u0027m whimpering, shutting my eyes tight. \"I just want to go home, man.\" \"But you can\u0027t,\" Bobby says soothingly. \"You can\u0027t go home, Victor.\" Pause. \"That isn\u0027t going to happen.\" \"Why not?\" I ask, like a child. \"Please, man \"Because-\" \"I swear to God I won\u0027t tell anyone, Bobby,\" I say, finally able to look at him, wiping my eyes with the tattered Kleenex, shuddering \"I swear to God I won\u0027t say anything.\" \"No, you won\u0027t,\" Bobby says patiently, his tone changing slightly. \"I know that. I already know that, Victor.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-142.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
