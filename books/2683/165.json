I actually must be off. Later, Victor.\" He disappears into the nothingness of the party.\n I\u0027m hot even though steam keeps pouring from my mouth with every exhale and \"Beyond\"-the word that shows up in my dreams-keeps flashing over the party, buzzing electric near the ceiling. It seems that every one in this room has been here for ten hours.\n \"It\u0027s not fun to scare people away, is it, Victor?\" Felix, the cinematographer, suddenly appears, wearing a chartreuse jacket with little epaulets on the shoulders. His subsequent wink is some kind of cue. I\u0027m trying to recover and failing.\n \"I suppose,\" I manage.\n The director, whom I didn\u0027t notice, makes himself more apparent by standing in front of me and staring grimly.\n \"A stellar evening,\" he says.\n \"What?\" I ask, and then, \"Oh. I suppose.\"\n \"Is something wrong?\" the director asks. \"Is something troubling you, Victor?\"\n \"No, um, I\u0027m just overwhelmed.\"\n \"Well, you have a lot to live up to, right?\"\n \"Yes, that\u0027s right.\" I\u0027m nodding. \"And I\u0027m freaking out because of it.\"\n \"Victor,\" he starts.\n \"Yes?\"\n \"Who have you been holding court with recently?\" the director asks. \"I mean, besides the people in the house.\"\n \"Oh... no one.\" I shrug. \"Just... me.\"\n \"What was going on in the Louvre this morning?\" Felix suddenly asks. \"Dimity, the PA, mentioned you were being followed around by a camera crew.\n \"Dimity has no idea what she\u0027s talking about,\" I say, finding my voice. \"Even though she is, in her own... way, quite, um, a wonderful\"-I gulp-\"person.\"\n \"We would also like to know what happened to the actor playing Sam Ho,\" the director says without warning. \"Do you have any idea concerning his whereabouts?\"\n The name-Sam Ho-resonates dully, and briefly I\u0027m transports back to the gym in the basement of that house in London, Jamie screaming, Bobby in a ski mask, Bruce holding a knife, the blood and wires, the flickering lights, the gutted mannequin, the party we went t the next night and the girl who ignored me there.\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk about... the past,\" I manage to say. \"Let\u0027s concentrate on the pr-pr-present.\"\n \"You were the last one with the actor after you left Pylos,\" Felix says \"You were supposed to stay with the limo once you exited the club.\"\n Pause. \"Well...,\" I start. \"Have you talked to the... driver?\"\n \"We\u0027ve been unable to locate him as well,\" the director says. \"What happened that night, Victor?\"\n \"Victor, did Sam Ho come back to the house with you that night?\" Felix asks. \"This is very important, so think carefully.\"\n \"No, he did not,\" I say, straining, flushed.\n \"You\u0027re lying,\" the director snaps.\n \"I\u0027m profoundly insulted by that remark.\"\n \"Oh Jesus,\" he sneers.\n \"Victor,\" Felix says calmly, though his attitude seems menacing. \"What happened to Sam Ho that night? After the two of you left Pylos?\"\n \"He... started coming on to me-\"\n \"But where were you going?\" the director asks, advancing closer. \"Why didn\u0027t you stay outside the club? The crew was outside. They said they saw you run to the limousine. They said it took off screeching.\"\n \"Do you really think I\u0027m going to make some kind of-I don\u0027t know-surprise announcement concerning where... I mean, Jesus...\"\n \"Where did the two of you go?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I say, crumpling. \"We... went for a ride... at Sam\u0027s request... and we... were going for a ride... to another club, I think.\" I start squinting, pretending to think. \"I don\u0027t really remember... I think Bobby told me to bring him back to the house but-\"\n Felix and the director shoot glances at each other.\n \"Wait,\" the director says. \"Bobby told you to bring Sam back?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I say. Following Felix\u0027s gaze, I see Bobby across the room.\n Bobby\u0027s looking fresh and relaxed and lights a cigarette Cameron Diaz is holding and he glances over at me and, when he sees who I\u0027m talking to, does a very casual double take and excuses himself from the group he\u0027s standing with, people I can\u0027t even recognize because of how blurry my vision has rapidly become. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-165.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
