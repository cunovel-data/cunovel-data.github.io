Behind me Lauren Hynde lingers by the door and Chloe says something like \"The limo\u0027s waiting on the street\" and I nod okay and move sullenly into our bedroom, making sure Chloe catches the scowl I hurl at Baxter while he continues deseeding.\\n\\n In my closet: white jeans, leather belts, leather bomber jacket, black cowboy boots, a couple of black wool crepe suits, a dozen white shirts, a black turtleneck, crumpled silk pajamas, a high-class p**n o movie I\u0027ve watched hundreds of times starring people who look just like us. I\u0027m pretending to go through stuff until Chloe walks in seconds after I\u0027ve crouched down inspecting a pair of sandals I bought in Barcelona at a Banana Republic.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the story?\" I finally ask. \"Where\u0027s my three-snap blazer?\"\\n\\n \"About what?\" she asks back, tightly.\\n\\n \"Wasn\u0027t he a head in a Mr. Jenkins ad, baby?\"\\n\\n \"I told you he was coming.\"\\n\\n \"What do you think that antifashion look costs?\" I ask. \"Two thousand bucks? Three thousand bucks?\"\\n\\n \"Forget about it, Victor.\" She\u0027s searching for a pair of sunglasses to wear.\\n\\n \"Far out.\"\\n\\n \"Victor,\" she starts. \"What are you looking for?\"\\n\\n \"My hair gel.\" I walk away from the closet and brush by her into the bathroom where I start gelling my hair, slicking it back. My beeper goes off and I ignore it. When it goes off again I wash my hands and find out it\u0027s Alison and I\u0027m wondering how everything got so f**ked up, but checking out my profile calms me down and I take a few deep breaths, complete a couple of seconds of some deep-sea visualization and then: ready to go.\\n\\n \"The tux looks nice,\" Chloe says, standing in the bathroom door, watching me. \"Who was that?\" Pause. \"On the beeper?\"\\n\\n \"Someone at the club.\" I just stand there and then I look at my watch and then move back to the bed where I rummage through the Comme des Garcons bag so the clothes can go to Chloe\u0027s dry cleaners. Absently I find the hat Lauren gave me, all scrunched up.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" I hear Chloe ask.\\n\\n \"Oops, wrong hat,\" I say, tossing it back in the bag, a Bullwinkle impression that used to make her laugh but now she doesn\u0027t get and she\u0027s not really looking at the hat but thinking other thoughts.\\n\\n \"I really want things to work out,\" Chloe says hesitantly. \"Between us,\" she clarifies.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m mad about you.\" I shrug. \"You\u0027re mad about me.\" I shrug again.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t do this, Victor.\"\\n\\n \"Do what?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m happy for you, Victor,\" she says, strained, just standing there in front of me, exhausted. \"I\u0027m really happy for you about tonight.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-72.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
