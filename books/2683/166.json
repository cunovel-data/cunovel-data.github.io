It\u0027s almost as if they\u0027re obeying a silent vibe Bobby\u0027s sending out: I\u0027m beautiful, I have a purpose, go back to your dream.\n We brush past extras, Bobby\u0027s arm around my neck, and he\u0027s patting my shoulder, maneuvering me to where Jamie\u0027s waiting by the exit, laughing fakely at what someone she doesn\u0027t really know says, and then Bobby asks me, \"What would you think if all these people were to die and this entire hotel came crashing down?\" He\u0027s grinning, serious.\n \"Oh dude,\" I whisper, breaking up. \"Oh man.\"\n \"Here-take this,\" Bobby says, slipping a tablet into my mouth, offering me his glass of champagne while caressing the back of my neck. \"It\u0027s like a rainbow.\"\n 28\n In the shower in the bathroom Jamie and Bobby share Bobby\u0027s admiring the tans we acquired on the yacht today, at the shocking whiteness where our boxer-briefs blocked out the sun, at the white imprints Jamie\u0027s bikini left behind, the paleness almost glowing in the semidarkness of the bathroom, the water from the massive chrome head smashing down on us and both our cocks are sticking up at sharp angles and Bobby\u0027s pulling on his prick, stiff and thick, his balls banging tightly beneath it, the muscles in his shoulders flexing as he strokes himself off and he\u0027s looking at me, our eyes meeting, and in a thick voice he grunts, \"Look at your dick, man,\" and I look down at the c**k I\u0027m jerking off and past that, at my thickly muscled legs...\n In the shower Bobby lets me make out with Jamie and Bobby\u0027s head is between her legs and Jamie\u0027s knees buckle a couple of times and Bobby keeps propping her up with an arm and his face is pushed up into her cunt and she\u0027s arching her back, pushing herself onto his tongue, and one of his hands is gripping my cock, soaping it up, and then Bobby starts sucking it and it gets so hard I can feel the pulse in it and then it gets even harder, the shaft keeps thickening and Bobby pulls it out of his mouth and studies it, squeezing it, and then he flicks his tongue over the head and then he lifts it up by the tip and starts flicking his tongue in brief, precise movements over the place where the head meets the shaft as Jamie hungrily moans \"do it do it\" while fingering herself in the semi-darkness and then Bobby places the entire shaft into his mouth, taking as much of my c**k as he comfortably can, sucking eagerly, wetly, while crouching down on his haunches, still stroking his own prick, and below it the curves of his thighs keep swelling as he repositions himself. I\u0027m bending my neck back, letting the water stream down my chest, and when I look back down Bobby\u0027s looking up at me and grinning, his hair wet and pressed down on his forehead, his tongue extended, pink against his face. Then Bobby motions for me to turn around so that he can spread the checks of my ass and I can feel him extending his tongue up in it and then he removes his tongue and sticks his index finger halfway up my ass**le and keeps fingerfucking me until he\u0027s pushed the entire finger as far as it can go, causing my c**k to keep twitching uncontrollably...\n I drop to my knees and start licking Jamie\u0027s pu**y, my fingers spreading her lips, and as her hands massage my hair I lean her against the shower wall-Bobby still behind me on his knees, his finger moving in and out of my ass**le, another hand running over my hard, cubed abs-and I keep running my tongue from her clit to her ass**le and placing one of her legs over my shoulder I suck her clit into my mouth as I f**k her with two then three fingers and then I move my tongue into her ass**le, f**king it with my tongue while my fingers tug on her clit, and when I stand up Bobby\u0027s finger slips out of my hole and I turn Jamie around and squatting down behind her I spread her small, firm ass cheeks open and start pumping my tongue in and out of her ass**le and then I slide my tongue deep inside her anus and keep it there while rubbing her clit until she comes... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-166.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
