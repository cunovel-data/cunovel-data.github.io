I trudge by her without saying a word, gingerly stepping over the remains of my crushed and mangled Vespa, which lies crumpled by the trash lining the curb, a cigarette dangling from my lips, my sunglasses on.\n \"Hey, we were supposed to meet this morning,\" she says, clicking off the cell phone.\n I don\u0027t say anything, just busy myself looking for my keys.\n \"They canceled the piece on you anyway,\" she says.\n \"And you came to tell me in person?\" I find the keys. \"How intimidating.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you care?\" she asks.\n I sigh, take my sunglasses off. \"What did you think of me?\"\n She cocks her head \"meaningfully,\" studies the sidewalk, squinting, then looks back up at my face.\n \"I thought you were well-nigh inscrutable,\" she says, mimicking a British accent.\n \"Well, I thought you were a hodgepodge of banality,\" I say, mimicking a British accent too.\n I open the door and step inside. She shrugs, skips away.\n An eviction notice is pinned to my door and when I pull it off I glance over at the director and roll my eyes, groaning \"Oh puhleeeze.\" The instant I walk into my apartment the phone starts ringing and I flop down on my beanbag chair, exhausted, and pick it up, yawning. \"It\u0027s Victor-whass up?\"\n \"This is Palakon calling,\" a voice says crisply.\n \"Palakon, I really can\u0027t talk now, so-\"\n \"There\u0027s a manila envelope on your kitchen table,\" Palakon says, cutting me off. \"Open it.\"\n I stare into the kitchen from where I\u0027m slouching and spot the envelope on the table.\n \"Okay,\" I say, \"I\u0027m opening the vanilla envelope, dude.\"\n \"No, Mr. Johnson,\" Palakon says, annoyed. \"Please get up and go to the kitchen.\"\n \"Whoa,\" I say, impressed.\n \"I want you to take that envelope with you when you go to London to find Jamie Fields,\" Palakon says. \"You have a reservation in a first-class cabin on the QE2. It leaves New York at four o\u0027clock this afternoon. Your tickets are in that manila envelope on your kitchen table, along with-\"\n \"Wait a minute, wait a minute,\" I say. \"Hold on.\"\n \"Yes?\" Palakon asks politely.\n I pause for a long time, mulling things over before blurting out, \"You could\u0027ve at least put me on the f**king Concorde.\"\n \"You have a reservation in a first-class cabin on the QE2,\" Palakon says again, undeterred. \"It leaves New York at four o\u0027clock this afternoon. A car will be by to pick you up at one-thirty. Your tickets are in the manila envelope along with ten thousand dollars in cash for, er, expenses-\"\n \"Need receipts?\"\n \"That won\u0027t be necessary, Mr. Johnson.\"\n \"Cool.\"\n \"I will contact you on the ship. And don\u0027t forget to take the manila envelope with you. It\u0027s crucial.\"\n \"Why?\" I ask.\n \"Because everything you need is in it.\"\n \"It\u0027s a nice manila envelope,\" I say finally.\n \"Thank you.\"\n \"How did you know I\u0027d be able to go today, Palakon?\"\n \"I read the News,\" he says. \"I figured it out.\"\n \"Palakon-\"\n \"Oh yes,\" Palakon says, befor hanging up. \"Take the hat with you too.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-92.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
