Endless conversations concern title changes, budget reductions, the leasing of an eighty-foot-tall tower crane, roving release dates, a volatile producer in L.A. seething over a rewrite. Before leaving I shoot a scene with Tammy concerning our characters\u0027 reactions toward Bruce\u0027s death (motorcycle accident, a truck carrying watermelons, Athens, a curve misjudged) but since she\u0027s not even capable of forming sentences let alone mimicking movements I shoot my lines standing in a hallway while a PA feeds me Tammy\u0027s lines far more convincingly than Tammy ever did (cutaways to Tammy will presumably be inserted at a later date). For the scene to end, a wig is placed on another PA\u0027s head and the giant Panaflex dollies in on my saddened yet hopeful\" face while we hug.\\n\\n Jamie is either pretending to ignore me or just doesn\u0027t register my presence while she\u0027s sitting at the computer in the living room-vacantly scanning diagrams, decoding E-malls-as I try to walk casually past her.\\n\\n Outside, the sky is gray, overcast.\\n\\n An apartment building on Quai de Bethune.\\n\\n I\u0027m turning the corner at Pont de Sully.\\n\\n A black Citroen sits parked at the curb on Rue Saint-Louis-en-l\u0027Isle and seeing the car causes me to walk faster toward it.\\n\\n Russell drives us to an apartment building on Avenue Verdier in the Montrouge section of the city.\\n\\n I\u0027m carrying a.25-caliber Walther automatic.\\n\\n I\u0027m carrying the WINGS file printouts, folded in the pocket of my black leather Prada jacket.\\n\\n I swallow a Xanax the wrong way then chew a Mentos to get the taste off my tongue.\\n\\n Russell and I run up three flights of stairs.\\n\\n On the fourth floor is an apartment devoid of furniture except for six white folding chairs. The walls are painted crimson and black, and cardboard storage boxes sit stacked on top of one another in towering columns. A small TV set is hooked up to a VCR that rests on top of a crate. Darkness is occasionally broken by lamps situated throughout the apartment. It\u0027s so cold that the floor is slippery with ice.\\n\\n F. Fred Palakon sits in one of the white folding chairs next to two of his associates-introduced to me as David Crater and Laurence Delta-and everyone\u0027s in a black suit, everyone just slightly older than me. Cigarettes are lit, files are opened, Starbucks coffee is offered, passed around, sipped.\\n\\n Facing them, I sit in one of the white folding chairs, just now noticing in a shadowy corner the Japanese man sitting in a white folding chair next to a window draped with crushed-velvet curtains. He\u0027s definitely older than the other men-flabbier, more listless-but his age is indeterminate. He slouches back into the shadows, his eyes fixed on me.\\n\\n Russell keeps pacing, talking quietly into a cell phone. Finally he clicks off and leans in to Palakon, whispering something displeasing.\\n\\n \"Are you certain?\" Palakon asks.\\n\\n Russell closes his eyes, sighs while nodding.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Palakon says. \"We don\u0027t have much time, then.\"\\n\\n Russell brushes past, taking his stance at the door behind me, and I turn around to make sure he\u0027s not leaving.\\n\\n \"Thank you for coming, Mr. Ward,\" Palakon says. \"You followed directions splendidly.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re... welcome.\"\\n\\n \"This needs to be brief,\" Palakon says. \"We don\u0027t have much time here today. I simply wanted to introduce my associates\"-Palakon nods at Delta and Crater-\"and have a preliminary meeting. We just need you to verify some things. Look at a few photographs, that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Wait. So, like, the problem, like, hasn\u0027t been solved?\" I ask, my voice squeaking.\\n\\n \"Well, no, not yet...\" Palakon falters. \"David and Laurence have been briefed on what you told me two days ago and we\u0027re going to figure out a way to extract you from this...\" Palakon can\u0027t find a word. I\u0027m waiting. \"This... situation,\" he says.\\n\\n \"Cool, cool,\" I\u0027m saying nervously, crossing my legs, then changing my mind. \"Just some facts? Cool. Some photos? Okay. That\u0027s cool. I can do that.\"\\n\\n A pause.\\n\\n \"Um, Mr. Ward?\" Palakon asks gingerly.\\n\\n \"Uh, yeah?\"\\n\\n \"Could you please\"-Palakon clears his throat-\"remove your sunglasses.\"\\n\\n A longer pause, followed by a realization. \"Oh. Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Ward,\" Palakon starts, \"how long have you been living in that house?\"\\n\\n \"I... don\u0027t know,\" I say, trying to remember. \"Since we came to Paris?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-183.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
