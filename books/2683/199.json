But those cheekbones, that jawline-I\u0027ve seen them before and I\u0027m trying to place where I met him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just figuring out the best way to explain-\"\\n\\n \"Fuck the best way,\" I shout. \"Just f**king say it. Who do you work for?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m an independent contractor, Mr. Ward-\"\\n\\n I cut him off. \"I\u0027m not saying anything else until you tell me who you work for.\"\\n\\n A long pause, during which Delta sighs heavily, then nods at Palakon.\\n\\n \"Who in the f**k do you work for?\" I ask. \"Because Jamie Fields has nothing to do with any of this, right?\"\\n\\n \"Not... exactly.\" Palakon tilts his head.\\n\\n \"Goddamnit, Palakon, I\u0027m so f**king sick of your bullshit,\" I scream.\\n\\n \"Mr. Ward-\"\\n\\n \"They killed Tammy Devol,\" I\u0027m screaming. \"They f**king raped her and cut her throat open. Bobby Hughes ordered it done.\"\\n\\n Everyone just stares at me blankly from across the table like I\u0027ve lost it or as if losing it isn\u0027t understandable.\\n\\n \"Mr. Ward-\" Palakon starts, his patience dropping.\\n\\n \"Fuck you, Palakon!\" I\u0027m screaming. \"Who in the f**k do you work for?\" I\u0027m at the table now, gripping its edges, glaring into Palakon\u0027s face. \"Fucking tell me who you work for,\" I\u0027m screaming at maximum volume, my face twisted into a grimace.\\n\\n Palakon draws in a breath and stares icily at me.\\n\\n He says, simply, \"I work for your father.\"\\n\\n Palakon pauses, looks away, sighing, then back at me.\\n\\n \"I work for your father, Mr. Ward.\"\\n\\n This is uttered so matter-of-factly, delivered so deadpan, that its existence opens a door and if you looked through that door you would see me moving above a winter road then descending rapidly and no one\u0027s there to catch me and I\u0027m hitting pavement. What this implies simply is that truth equals chaos and that this is a regression. A physical sensation causes me to ignore everything in this room-to turn away from Russell running his hand through his hair, turn away from the Japanese man lighting another cigarette, turn away from the fly buzzing around my head. These men are perpetrators and the table they\u0027re sitting behind suddenly seems vaster and they\u0027re making plans, they\u0027re jotting memoranda, they\u0027re casting motives, they\u0027re plotting itineraries. Something invisible is forming itself in the cold air in the interrogation room and it\u0027s directed at me, wheeling forward. But the familiarity of the inspector from Interpol interrupts everything, makes me remember an earlier scene, and something emerges, obliterates the fuzz.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" I ask quietly.\\n\\n \"I was hired by your father,\" Palakon says. \"He came to me.\"\\n\\n I slowly move away from the table, my hand on my mouth, and I\u0027m sitting back down in the chair I\u0027d kicked away.\\n\\n \"Mr. Ward,\" the Japanese man starts, with a thick accent. \"Your father is leaving the U.S. Senate quite soon. Is this correct?\"\\n\\n I stare blankly at him. \"I... don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n The Japanese man continues. \"Your father will be making a bid for the-\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" I say, cutting him off. \"What does this have to do with anything?\"\\n\\n \"Victor,\" Palakon starts, \"your father-\"\\n\\n The Japanese man interrupts. \"Mr. Palakon, please. May I speak?\"\\n\\n Palakon nods uncertainly.\\n\\n \"We have not been formally introduced,\" the Japanese man says.\\n\\n \"Who are you?\" I ask.\\n\\n He hesitates. \"And for reasons owing to our mutual personal safety, Mr. Johnson, we will not be.\"\\n\\n \"Oh shit,\" I\u0027m muttering, clenching up. \"Oh shit oh shit-\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Johnson, your father is leaving the United States Senate.\" The Japanese man pauses. \"He is interested in moving on, shall we say?\" The Japanese man gestures with his hands, tries to smile kindly but is incapable. \"To a higher place. He is planning to announce his bid for a higher office, for-\"\\n\\n \"Oh shit oh shit oh shit.\" My moaning cuts him off, distracting the Japanese man.\\n\\n \"Mr. Ward,\" Crater starts, \"when your father came to us, he was concerned about certain... well, proclivities you had toward-\"\\n\\n \"What he\u0027s trying to say, Victor,\" Palakon interrupts, \"is that you\u0027re not exactly an unknown quantity.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-199.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
