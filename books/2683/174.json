I\u0027m trying to cling to Palakon as they lead me to the door.\n \"You must calm down, Mr. Ward,\" Palakon says. \"Now let Russell take you back and we\u0027ll contact you within a couple of days, possibly sooner. But you must remain calm. Things are different now and you must remain calm.\"\n \"Why can\u0027t I stay here?\" I plead, struggling as I\u0027m being led to the door. \"Please let me stay here.\"\n \"I need to get a full view,\" Palakon says. \"Right now it\u0027s just a partial view. And I need to get a full view.\"\n \"What\u0027s happening, Palakon?\" I ask, finally motionless. \"What\u0027s the story?\"\n \"Just that something has gone terribly wrong.\"\n In the backseat of the black Citroen everything is covered with confetti and it seems like hours before Russell drops me off on Boulevard Saint-Marcel and then I\u0027m crossing through the Jardin des Plantes and then I\u0027m at the Seine and above me the morning sky is white and I\u0027m thinking, Stay indoors, go to sleep, don\u0027t get involved, view everything without expression, drink whiskey, pose, accept.\n 25\n I\u0027m standing at a pay phone on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, calling Felix at the Ritz. The phone in his room rings six times before he answers. I\u0027m taking off my sunglasses then putting them on, again and again.\n \"Hello?\" Felix asks tiredly.\n \"Felix, it\u0027s me,\" I say. \"It\u0027s Victor.\"\n \"Yes?\" Felix asks. \"What is it? What do you want?\"\n \"We have to talk.\" Across the street from where I\u0027m standing someone\u0027s behaving oddly-weird hair, waving car fumes away with a newspaper, laughing uncontrollably. Across the street the sun is rising, then decides not to.\n \"Oh Victor, I am so tired of this,\" Felix says. \"I am so tired of you.\"\n \"Felix, please, not now, please don\u0027t go into a rant now,\" I\u0027m saying. \"There are things you need to know,\" I\u0027m saying. \"I\u0027ve figured some things out and I need to tell you these things.\"\n \"But I\u0027m not interested in listening to you anymore,\" Felix says. \"In fact, nobody is, Victor. And frankly I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything you need to tell anyone, except of course if it\u0027s about your hair or your gym routine or who you plan to f**k next week.\"\n (Bobby flies to Rome and then to Amman, Jordan, on Alitalia. A bag in the overhead compartment in first class contains spools of electric wire, needle-nosed pliers, silicon, large kitchen knives, aluminum foil, packets of Remform, hammers, a camcorder, a dozen files containing diagrams of military weapons, missiles, armored cars. On the plane Bobby reads an article in a fashionable magazine about the President\u0027s new haircut and what it means and Bobby memorizes lines he needs to deliver and flirts with a stewardess who mentions in passing that her favorite song is John Lennon\u0027s \"Imagine.\" In a soothing voice Bobby compliments her career choice. She\u0027s asking him what it was like being on the Oprah Winfrey show. He\u0027s recalling a visit to room 25 at the Dreamland Motel. He\u0027s planning a catastrophe. He\u0027s contemplatively eating a brownie.)\n \"Felix, remember when you were asking me what happened to Sam Ho?\" I\u0027m saying. \"Remember about the other film crew? The one Dimity saw me with at the Louvre yesterday?\"\n \"Victor, please, just calm down,\" Felix says. \"Get a grip. None of this matters anymore.\"\n \"Oh, yes it does, Felix, it does matter.\"\n \"No,\" he says. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\n \"Why not?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Why doesn\u0027t it matter?\"\n \"Because the movie\u0027s over,\" Felix says. \"The production has been shut down. Everybody\u0027s leaving tonight.\"\n \"Felix-\"\n \"You\u0027ve been shockingly unprofessional, Victor.\"\n (Jamie\u0027s in traffic circling the Arc de Triomphe, then she\u0027s turning down Avenue de Wagram, making a right onto Boulevard de Courcelles, heading for Avenue de Clichy to meet Bertrand Ripleis, and Jamie\u0027s thinking that this seems like the longest day of the year and she\u0027s thinking about a particular Christmas tree from her childhood, but it was never really the tree that impressed her, it was the ornaments adorning the tree, and then she\u0027s remembering how afraid of the ocean she was as a little girl-\"too watery,\" she\u0027d tell her parents-and then she\u0027s eighteen, in the Hamptons, a summer dawn, freshman year at Camden is a week away and she\u0027s staring out at the Atlantic, listening to a boy she met backstage at a Who concert at Nassau Coliseum snoring lightly behind her and two years later, in Cambridge, he\u0027ll commit suicide, pulled toward a force he could not evaluate, but now it was the end of August and she was thirsty and a giant gull circled above her and mourning didn\u0027t matter yet.) \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-174.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
