Isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"How did that happen?\"\n \"On the record?\"\n I nod.\n \"Some special-events impresario called,\" Damien says. \"And-voila.\"\n \"Can I ask you a question?\" I start, feeling daring.\n \"What is it?\"\n \"Where did you guys meet? I mean, you and Lauren.\"\n He downs the tequila, gently places the glass back on the bar and frowns.\n \"I met her while we were both having dinner with the world\u0027s richest people.\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"We\u0027re not allowed to give out these names.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"But you\u0027d know them\", Damien says. \"You wouldn\u0027t be surprised.\"\n \"Cool.\"\n \"Hint: they just spent the weekend at Neverland Ranch.\"\n \"Would you like a Mentos?\" I ask.\n \"I need a favor, Victor.\"\n \"I\u0027d do anything for you, man.\"\n \"Please don\u0027t grovel.\"\n \"Sorry.\"\n \"Will you take Lauren with you to the opening tonight?\" Damien asks. \"She won\u0027t come otherwise. Or if she does she\u0027s threatening to come with f**king Skeet Ulrich or Olivier Martinez or Mickey Hardt or Daniel Day-fucking-Lewis.\"\n \"That would be cool\", I consider. \"I mean if we could get Daniel Day-Lewis-\"\n \"Hey\", he snaps. \"Watch it.\"\n \"Oh yeah. My apologies.\"\n Damien still has traces of this morning\u0027s mud mask next to his right ear. I reach out and flick a speck gently away.\n \"What\u0027s that?\" he asks, flinching.\n \"Mud?\" I guess.\n He sighs. \"It\u0027s shit, Victor. It\u0027s all shit.\"\n I pause. \"You had... shit on your face?\" I ask. \"Whoa, dude. Don\u0027t go there.\"\n \"No. My life, Victor. My whole f**king life. It\u0027s all shit.\"\n \"Why, guy?\" I ask. \"When did this massive dumping occur?\"\n \"I have a girlfriend, Victor,\" Damien says, staring straight at me.\n \"Yeah-\" I stop, confused. \"Alison?\"\n \"No. Alison\u0027s my fiancee. Lauren\u0027s the girlfriend.\"\n \"You guys are engaged?\" I gasp involuntarily and when I try to hide the gasp, I gasp again. \"Oh, I knew that, dude. Um, I knew that.\"\n Damien\u0027s face hardens. \"How did you know that?\" he asks. \"Nobody knows that.\"\n Pause, then semi-effortlessly, in a tight voice while holding my breath, out comes: \"Man oh man this town, guy.\"\n Damien seems too depressed to not accept this. A long pause.\n \"You mean,\" I start, \"like getting-married engaged?\"\n \"That\u0027s usually what it means.\"\n \"So I\u0027ve heard,\" I murmur.\n \"When did you and Lauren get so close?\" he asks suddenly.\n \"I really don\u0027t know her at all, Damien,\" I say, squeezing the hat. \"She\u0027s a friend of Chloe\u0027s.\"\n \"She said she went to school with you,\" he mutters. \"She said you were-and don\u0027t take this the wrong way-a total ass**le.\"\n \"I won\u0027t take that the wrong way.\"\n \"I can see that your self-esteem is pretty high today, huh?\"\n \"It\u0027s funny-I thought she went to school with you, man.\" I chuckle lamely to myself, bowing a little, eyes half-closed. \"Didn\u0027t you guys go to school together, m-man?\"\n \"Victor, I\u0027ve got a f**king migraine. Just, y\u0027know, don\u0027t.\" He closes his eyes, reaches for the Patron, stops himself. \"So-will you do it? Will you take her?\"\n \"I\u0027m... taking Chloe.\"\n \"Just take Lauren with you guys.\" His beeper goes off. He checks it. \"Shit. It\u0027s Alison. I\u0027ve gotta go. Tell Lauren goodbye. And I\u0027ll see you at the club.\"\n \"Tonight\u0027s the night,\" I say.\n \"I think it\u0027ll work,\" he says. \"I think it won\u0027t be a disaster.\"\n \"We\u0027ll see, man.\" Damien reaches out his hand. Instinctively I shake it. Then he\u0027s gone.\n I\u0027m standing in the living room, taking a long time to notice Lauren leaning in the doorway.\n \"I heard everything,\" she murmurs.\n \"That\u0027s probably more than I heard,\" I murmur back. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-66.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
