It\u0027s time to relax and play it differently. I reach into my jeans, lifting up my shirt a little more so that she can see the rest of my stomach and spreading my legs even wider so she can spot the bulge in my jeans. I offer her a Mentos.\n \"You really look like you work out,\" I say. \"How do you keep in such buff shape, doll?\"\n \"Not eating helps,\" she mutters.\n \"So you\u0027re refusing the Mentos?\"\n She smiles, barely, and nods.\n \"Are you coming to the club tonight?\" I ask.\n \"To the Copa? The Copacabana? The hottest spot north of Havana?\" she asks, clapping her hands together, eyes wide with fake delight.\n \"Hey, don\u0027t be dissing me, sistah.\"\n \"Where\u0027s Chloe now, Victor?\" she asks, moving closer.\n \"Who was your last significant other, baby?\"\n \"An ex-rogue trader I met at a screenplay-writing seminar, then Gavin Rossdale,\" she says. \"Oh, and Adam Sandler for three days.\"\n \"Oh shit.\" I smack my forehead. \"Now I know who you are. Now I remember.\"\n She smiles a little, warming up. \"Who are you dating now, Victor?\" She pauses. \"Besides Alison Poole?\"\n \"Hey, I thought that name wasn\u0027t allowed in this apartment.\" \"Only someone who owns a voodoo doll of her with five hundred pins stuck in its head and an extra-large Snickers bar strapped to its ass can,\" she says. \"Now, who are you dating, Victor? Just say it. Just let me hear you say a name.\"\n \"Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me, one that says she\u0027s a friend of mine.\"\n She smiles now, standing over the bed.\n \"Can I ask you something?\" I ask.\n \"Can you?\"\n \"You won\u0027t freak out?\"\n \"It depends.\"\n \"Okay. Just promise me you\u0027ll take this within a certain context.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"It\u0027s just that...\" I stop, breathe in, laugh a little.\n \"It\u0027s just what?\"\n Now, playing it very seriously, I say, \"It\u0027s just that I really want to stick my tongue up your pu**y right now.\" I\u0027m squeezing my dick through my jeans, staring straight at her. \"I promise I won\u0027t do anything else. I just have this urge to lick your pu**y right now.\" I pause, shyly. \"Can I?\"\n She breathes in but doesn\u0027t move away.\n \"Are you going to complain about my behavior?\" I ask.\n \"No,\" she says.\n \"Come here,\" I say.\n Her eyes move over my body.\n \"Come here,\" I say again.\n She just stands there, deciding what to do, unmoving.\n \"Is there a... dilemma?\" I\u0027m asking.\n \"Victor,\" she sighs. \"I can\u0027t.\"\n \"Why?\" I ask. \"Come here.\"\n \"Because it\u0027s like you\u0027re back from... outer space or something,\" she says. \"And I don\u0027t know you.\"\n \"You\u0027re a little hard to unwrap too, baby.\"\n She lets her robe drop.\n \"I think we should maybe end the conversation here,\" I say.\n She kneels over me, pushing me back down on the bed, straddling my waist. I work one finger into her pu**y, finally just easing it in, then two fingers, and her own fingers are rubbing her clit and I sit up and start licking and sucking on her br**sts. I take my fingers out of her pu**y and put them in my mouth, telling her how much I want to eat her pu**y, and then I easily flip her onto her back and spread her legs wide apart and push them back so her whole pu**y is spread out, available, and I start fingerfucking her while licking and sucking on her clit. I stick another finger in my mouth and slip it in between her legs, lower, until it touches her ass**le, pressing lightly against it. I\u0027m rock hard and I\u0027ve pulled my pants down to my knees, my ass sticking up in the air, stroking myself off, my tongue way up her cunt, but then she pulls me up to her br**sts, urging me to suck her ni**les, and still stroking my prick I immediately move up and we start eating each other\u0027s mouths, sucking hungrily, and she\u0027s gripping my c**k and rubbing it against her lower lips and then my cock\u0027s sliding up into her without any effort and she starts humping hard on it and I start meeting her thrusts and she\u0027s coming and then the intercom buzzes and the doorman\u0027s voice announces, \"Lauren-Damien Ross is on his way up,\" and we both freeze. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-64.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
