Eva says she\u0027s very happy for me. \"So where\u0027s your boyfriend tonight?\" I ask, smiling. \"A certain guy is out of town,\" Eva says evasively. \"Where is he?\" I ask, teasing her. \"He\u0027s actually at the Fuji Rock Festival,\" she says, rolling her eyes, sipping the green tea. \"I know someone who went to that.\" \"Maybe they went together.\" \"Who knows?\" \"Yes,\" she says, opening a menu. \"Who knows?\" \"The point is: you don\u0027t know.\" \"Yes, that is the point.\" \"You look beautiful.\" She doesn\u0027t say anything. \"Did you hear me?\" I ask. \"Nice suit,\" she says without looking up. \"Are we making shoptalk?\" \"You\u0027re getting quite the press these days,\" Eva says, tapping the copy of the Observer. \"Wherever you seem to go there\u0027s a paparazzi alert.\" \"It\u0027s not all sunglasses and autographs, baby.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Aren\u0027t these people ridiculous?\" I ask, vaguely gesturing. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" she says. \"The simplicity is almost soothing. It\u0027s like being back in high school.\" \"Why is it like that?\" \"Because you realize that hanging out with dumb people makes you feel much smarter,\" she says. \"At least that\u0027s how I viewed high school.\" \"Where were you while we were getting high?\" I murmur to myself, concentrating on avoiding eye contact with anyone in the room. \"Pardon?\" \"My mind is definitely expanding,\" I say, clearing my throat. \"Without us this is all just trash,\" she agrees. I\u0027m reaching for the edamame. \"Speaking of,\" Eva starts. \"How\u0027s Alison Poole?\" \"I have a feeling I\u0027m breaking her heart.\" \"I have a feeling you\u0027re good at breaking hearts,\" Eva says. \"She keeps asking questions about Chloe Byrnes,\" I murmur. Eva doesn\u0027t say anything. Soon she\u0027s sipping a Stolichnaya Limonnaya vodka and I\u0027m picking at a plate of hijiki. \"What did you do today?\" I ask before realizing I\u0027m not particularly interested, even though I\u0027m squeezing Eva\u0027s thigh beneath the table. \"I had a photo shoot. I had lunch with Salt-n-Pepa. I avoided certain people. I contacted the people I didn\u0027t avoid.\" Eva breathes in. \"My life right now is actually simpler than I thought it was going to be.\" She sighs, but not unhappily. \"If there are some things I\u0027m not used to yet, it\u0027s still sweet.\" \"I dig it,\" I say. \"I hear where you\u0027re coming from, baby,\" I say, mimicking a robot. Eva giggles, says my name, lets me squeeze her thigh harder. But then I\u0027m looking away and things get difficult. I down another cup of sake. \"You seem distracted,\" Eva says. \"Something happened last night,\" I murmur. \"What?\" I tell her, whispering. \"We need to be careful,\" Eva says. Suddenly a couple is looming over us and I hear someone exclaim, \"Victor? Hey man, what\u0027s up.\" Breathing in, I look up with a practiced smile. \"Oh, hi,\" I say, reaching out a hand. A fairly hip couple, our age. The guy-who I don\u0027t recognize-grabs my hand and shakes it with a firm grip that says \"please remember me because you\u0027re so cool,\" and the girl he\u0027s with is bouncing up and down in the crush of the restaurant and she offers a little wave and Eva nods, offers a little wave back. \"Hey Corrine,\" the guy says, \"this is Victor Ward-oh, sorry\"-the guy catches himself-\"I mean Victor Johnson. Victor, this is Corrine.\" \"Hey, nice to meet you,\" I say, taking Corrine\u0027s hand. \"And this is Lauren Hynde,\" the guy says, gesturing toward Eva, who keeps smiling, sitting perfectly still. \"Hi, Lauren, I think we met already,\" Corrine says. \"At that Kevyn Aucoin benefit? At the Chelsea Piers? Alexander McQueen introduced us. You were being interviewed by MTV. It was a screening of that movie?\" \"Oh, right, right, of course,\" Eva says. \"Yeah. Right. Corrine.\" Hey, Lauren,\" the guy says, a little too shyly. \"Hi, Maxwell,\" Eva says with an undercurrent of sexiness. \"How do you guys know each other?\" I ask, looking first at Maxwell and then at Eva.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-226.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
