Okay? Could you please just do that?\" I ask, teeth clenched.\\n\\n \"I can confirm that, sir, but I cannot give out a passenger\u0027s room number.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not asking you to give out a room number,\" I say impatiently. \"I\u0027m not asking for a passenger\u0027s room number. I know her goddamn room number. just confirm she\u0027s in room 402.\"\\n\\n \"Marina...?\"\\n\\n \"Marina Gibson,\" I stress. \"Like Mel. Like Mel Gibson. Only the first name is Marina.\"\\n\\n The clerk has pulled open one of the spiral notebooks, which supposedly contains a computerized listing of all the passengers on this particular crossing. Then he wheels over to the monitor, taps a few keys, pretends to appear authoritative, consults one graph and then another, lapses into a series of sighs.\\n\\n \"What room did you say, sir?\"\\n\\n \"Cabin 402,\" I say, bracing myself.\\n\\n The clerk makes a face, cross-checks something in the spiral notebook, then looks vacantly back up at me.\\n\\n \"That room isn\u0027t inhabited on this crossing,\" he says simply.\\n\\n A long pause before I\u0027m able to ask, \"What do you mean? What do you mean, \u0027not inhabited\u0027? I called that room last night. Someone answered. I talked to someone in that room. What do you mean, \u0027not inhabited\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"What I mean, sir, is that this particular room is not inhabited,\" the clerk says. \"What I\u0027m saying, sir, is that nobody is staying in that room.\"\\n\\n \"But...\" I start shaking my head. \"No, no, that\u0027s not right.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Ward?\" the clerk begins. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll show up. \"\\n\\n \"How do you know?\" I ask, blanching. \"Where in the hell could she be?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe she\u0027s in the women\u0027s spa,\" the clerk suggests, shrugging.\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah, right,\" I\u0027m muttering. \"The women\u0027s spa.\" Pause. \"Wait-there\u0027s a women\u0027s spa?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a perfectly reasonable explanation for all this, Mr. Ward-\"\\n\\n \"Hey, wait, don\u0027t say things like that,\" I say, shuddering, holding my hands up.\\n\\n \"Whenever somebody says something like that, something is definitely f**ked up.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Ward, please-\"\\n\\n \"I think she\u0027s in trouble,\" I say, leaning in. \"Did you hear me? I said I think she\u0027s in trouble.\"\\n\\n \"But Mr. Ward, I don\u0027t even have a Marina Gibson on the passenger list,\" the clerk says. \"There\u0027s no Marina Gibson registered for this crossing.\"\\n\\n The clerk looks up at me as if he can\u0027t possibly comprehend the expression on my face.\\n\\n I wait in the hall in a small chair, watching everyone who enters and exits the women\u0027s spa until it closes.\\n\\n 2\\n\\n F. Fred Palakon calls at 7:00. I\u0027ve been in my room since the women\u0027s spa closed at 5, mulling over the prospect of roaming the entire ship to look for whoever it was who called herself Marina Gibson, ultimately discarding that prospect because the photo from last night\u0027s dinner was slid under my door in a manila envelope stamped with the QE2 imprimatur. The photo didn\u0027t come out too well, the main reason being that the Wallaces aren\u0027t in it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-114.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
