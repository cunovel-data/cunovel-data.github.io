{"id":69393,"no":206,"title":"Page 206","content":"\"Bobby?\" I call out. \"Are you here? Where are you,\" and then, under my breath, \"you f**k.\" I\u0027m just noticing that cell phones are scattered everywhere, across tables, under chairs, in piles on the floor, dozens of them smashed open, their antennas snapped off. Some of their transmission bars are lit but I can\u0027t get an outside line on any of them and then I you are the sort of person who doesn\u0027t see well in the dark turn into the darkness of the kitchen. I open the refrigerator door and then the freezer and light from inside illuminates a section of the black, empty kitchen. I grab a bottle that lies on its side in the freezer and take a swig from a half-empty gallon of Stoli, barely tasting it. Outside, the wind is a hollow roaring sound. In a drawer adjacent to the sink I find a flashlight and just as I turn toward another drawer something zooms past me. I whirl around. A reflection in the gilt-edged mirror that hangs over the stove: my grave expression. Then I\u0027m laughing nervously and I bring a hand to my forehead, leaving it there until I\u0027m calm enough to find the.25-caliber Walther I hid last week in another drawer. With the beam from the flashlight I\u0027m noticing that the microwave\u0027s door is open and inside it\u0027s splattered with a dried brown mixture of twigs, branches, stones, leaves. And then I notice the cave drawings. They\u0027re scrawled everywhere. Giant white spaces heavily decorated with stick figures of buffalos, crudely drawn horses, dragons, what looks like a serpent. \"Just be cool just be cool just be cool,\" I\u0027m telling myself. Suddenly, over the speaker system that runs throughout the house, a CD clicks on and covering the sound of wind roaring outside: water rushing, various whooshing noises, Paul Weller\u0027s guitar, Oasis, Liam Gallagher echoing out, singing the first verse from \"Champagne Supernova,\" and it blasts through the darkness of the house. \"This is so f**ked, this is so f**ked,\" I\u0027m muttering, on the edge of panic but not in it yet and the yellow fan of light washing across the walls keeps shaking as I move farther into the house and where were you while we were getting hi-i-i-igh? the house smells so much like shit I keep gagging. One hand is holding the flashlight and I clamp the other, holding the gun, over my nose and mouth. in the champagne supernova in the skyyyyyy I bend down, pick up another cell phone. I pull up the antenna, flipping the phone open. No transmission bars. I aim the flashlight down a hallway and then I shine its beam up into the circular staircase and I\u0027m squinting, trying to make out the dim star shapes that seem to have appeared everywhere. But then I see that those star shapes are actually pentagrams and they\u0027re drawn with red paint everywhere on the walls, on the ceiling, on the stairs leading to the second floor. Something turns in the darkness behind me. I whirl around. Nothing. I run up the stairs. Every five steps, I stop and look over my shoulder, waving the beam of the flashlight into the darkness floating below me. in a champagne supernova, in a champagne supernova in the sk-k-yyyyyyyyy I hesitate at the top of the staircase and then I\u0027m drifting unsteadily along one side of the hallway and I\u0027m feeling along the wall for light switches. I turn hesitantly around another corner and-except for the pentagrams and the cell phones scattered everywhere-the set is immactilate, untouched, everything in its place. I make it to the room I\u0027ve been staying in, my shadow moving across its door as I walk toward it. My hand freezes, then I reach tentatively for the doorknob, thinking, Don\u0027t open it don\u0027t open it don\u0027t After I open it I pocket the gun and shift the flashlight into my other hand. I reach out for a light switch but can\u0027t feel one. I shine the flashlight across the room. I open a drawer-it\u0027s empty. I open another drawer-also empty. All my clothes are gone. The passport I\u0027d hidden, wedged beneath my mattress, isn\u0027t there. In the bathroom -all my toiletries are gone. A giant red pentagram is slashed across the mirror. where were you while we were getting h-i-i-i-i-i-ighhhh I move toward the closet, my heart pounding. All my clothes have been removed. And in their place, posted all over the walls of the small walk-in closet, are Polaroid shots of me and Sam Ho, naked, sweaty, delirious, having sex. A larger photo rests in the middle of this collage. I\u0027m driving a butcher knife deep into Sam Ho\u0027s chest and I\u0027m lost and grinning, my eyes red, caught in the flash, my expression addressing the camera, asking do you like this? are you pleased?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-206.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
