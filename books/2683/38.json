Can you hear me panting?\" \"You motherfucker,\" I whisper. \"This is cosmic.\" \"Buddy, I feel like we\u0027ve become very close.\" \"Where\u0027s Hurley\u0027s brother? Curley?\" \"He hung himself.\" \"Who was at the funeral?\" \"Julia Roberts, Erica Kane, Melissa Etheridge, Lauren Holly and, um, Salma Hayek.\" \"Didn\u0027t she date his dad?\" \"Yeah.\" \"So he was in and out of the picture?\" \"So no photo, Buddy?\" \"The photo of you and Alison Poole has vanished.\" \"For the record, what was it of?\" \"For the record? You don\u0027t want to know.\" \"You know, Buddy, Alison just lost the role in the film version of The Real Thing,\" I add, \"for what it\u0027s worth.\" \"Which is nada. Thank you, Victor. `A Current Affair\u0027 has arrived.\" \"No-thank you, Buddy. And please, this was not from me.\" I pause, then realize something and shout, \"Don\u0027t say it, don\u0027t-\" \"Trust me.\" Buddy clicks off. 21 Nobu before noon and I\u0027m biting off half a Xanax while passing what\u0027s got to be Dad\u0027s limo parked out front, and inside: various executives from MTV, a new maitre d\u0027 being interviewed by \"The CBS Morning News,\" Helena Christensen, Milla Jovovich and the French shoe designer Christian Louboutin at one table, and at another Tracee Ross, Samantha Kluge, Robbie Kravitz and Cosima Von Bulow, and Dad is the thin Waspish dude wearing the navy-blue Ralph Lauren suit sitting in the second booth from the front doodling notes on a yellow legal pad, a folder lying thick and suspicious next to a bowl of sunomono. Two of his aides have the front booth. He should look middle-aged but with the not-too-recent facelift and since according to my sister he\u0027s been on Prozac since April (a secret), everything is vaguely cool. For relaxation: hunting deer, an astrologer to deal with those planetary vibes, squash. And his nutritionist has stressed raw fish, brown rice, no tempura but hijiki is okay and I\u0027m basically here for some toro sashimi, some jokey conversation and a charming inquiry about some cash. He smiles, bright caps. \"Sorry, Dad, I got lost.\" \"You look thin.\" \"It\u0027s all those drugs, Dad,\" I sigh, sliding into the booth. \"That\u0027s not funny, Victor,\" he says wearily. \"Dad, I don\u0027t do drugs. I\u0027m in great shape.\" \"No, really. How are you, Victor?\" \"I\u0027m a knockout, Dad. A total knockout. I\u0027m rippin\u0027. Things are happening. I\u0027m in control of all the elements. You are laughing somewhat jaggedly, Dad, but I am in continuous flux.\" \"Is that right?\" \"I\u0027m staking out new territory, Dad.\" \"Which is?\" I stare straight ahead. \"The future.\" Dad stares glumly back, gives up, looks around, smiles awkwardly. \"You\u0027ve become much more skillful, Victor, at expressing, um, your ambitions.\" \"You bet, Dad. I\u0027m streamlined and direct.\" \"That\u0027s wonderful.\" He motions to Evett, the waiter, for more iced tea. \"So where are you coming from?\" \"I had a photo shoot.\" \"I hope you\u0027re not doing any more of those naked Webster shots or whatever. Jesus.\" \"Near naked. Bruce Weber. I\u0027m not trying to freak you out, Dad.\" \"Wagging your ass around like-\" \"It was an Obsession ad, Dad. You\u0027re acting like it was some kind of p**n o movie.\" \"What\u0027s your point, Victor?\" \"Dad, the point is: the-column-blocked-my-crotch.\" He\u0027s already flipping through his menu. \"Before I forget, thank you for the, um, Patti Lupone CD you sent me for my birthday, Victor. It was a thoughtful gift.\" I scan the menu too. \"No sweat, dude.\" Dad keeps glancing uneasily over at the MTV table, some of the executives probably making wisecracks. I resist waving. Dad asks, \"Why are they staring over here like that?\" \"Maybe because you have `lost white guy\u0027 written all over you?\" I ask. \"Christ, I need a glass of bottled water. Or a dry beer.\" Evett comes over with the iced tea and silently takes our order, then moves uncertainly toward the back of the restaurant. \"Nice-looking girl,\" my dad says, admiringly.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-38.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
