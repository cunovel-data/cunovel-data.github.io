He watches passively, trying to listen to something the director is telling him while Jamie scratches at her face, makes gurgling noises, pleads with anyone who will listen.\\n\\n I can\u0027t form a sentence, all reflexes zapped. I\u0027m feebly reaching out a hand to steady myself, cameras swinging around us, capturing reactions.\\n\\n Bobby slaps Jamie across the face while Bentley continues holding on to her.\\n\\n \"No one cares,\" Bobby\u0027s saying. \"I thought we agreed on that.\"\\n\\n Jamie makes noises no one can translate.\\n\\n \"I thought we agreed on that,\" Bobby\u0027s saying. \"You understand me? No one cares.\" He slaps her across the face, harder. This time it gets her attention. She stares at him. \"This reaction of yours is useless. It carries no meaning with anyone here and it\u0027s useless. We agreed that no one would care.\"\\n\\n Jamie nods mutely and just as it seems she\u0027s going to relax into the moment, she suddenly freaks out. Bentley is panting with exertion, trying to wrestle her down, but he\u0027s laughing because he\u0027s so stressed out, and someone from the crew keeps rationalizing, frivolously, \"No one could have saved her.\" I\u0027m trying to move the other way, gracefully aiming for the door. I\u0027m trying to wake up momentarily by turning away from this scene, by becoming transparent, but also realizing that the Halcion prescription Jamie picked up was meant not for Tammy but only for herself\\n\\n 17\\n\\n Midnight and I\u0027m drinking Absolut from a plastic cup, overdressed in a black Prada suit with Gucci boots and eating Xanax, a cigarette burning between my fingers. A party at a massive new Virgin megastore that maybe Tommy Hilfiger has something to do with sponsoring; there\u0027s a stage, there\u0027s supposed to be bands, there\u0027s an Amnesty International banner, there\u0027s supposed to be the ubiquitous benefit concert (though right now the Bangles\u0027 \"Hazy Shade of Winter\" is blasting over the sound system), there\u0027s loads of negativity. There\u0027s the lead singer from the Verve, there are two members from Blur wearing vintage sneakers, there\u0027s Andre Agassi and William Hurt and three Spice Girls and people milling around holding guitars, there are the first black people I\u0027ve seen since I\u0027ve been in France, there\u0027re a lot of major dudes from Hollywood (or not enough, depending on who you ask), there are trays of ostrich on tiny crackers, opossum on bamboo skewers, shrimp heads tied up in vines, huge plates of tentacles draped over clumps of parsley, but I really can\u0027t keep anything down and I\u0027m looking for a leather sofa to fall into because I can\u0027t tell if people are really as disinterested as they appear or just extremely bored. Whatever-it\u0027s infectious. People keep swatting away flies when they aren\u0027t busy whispering or lurking. I\u0027m just saying \"Hi.\" I\u0027m just following directions. It\u0027s really an alarming party and everyone is a monster. It\u0027s also a mirror.\\n\\n And then a giant intake of breath. Uncertain of what I\u0027m seeing.\\n\\n On the edge of the crowd, beyond the crowd, perfectly]it, cameras flashing around her, surrounded by playboys, her hair sleek and dark gold, is a girl.\\n\\n Chloe.\\n\\n Everything rushes back and it knocks me forward, stunned, and I start pushing through the crowd dumbly, adrenaline washing through me, my breath exhaling so hard I\u0027m making noises and Elle Macpherson glimpses me and tries reaching over to say \"Hi\" but when she sees how freaked out I look-face twisted, gasping-something dawns on her and she decides to ignore me.\\n\\n At the precise moment Elle turns away I see Bertrand Ripleis across the record store, his eyes focused as if on a target, grimly advancing toward Chloe.\\n\\n Frantic, I start making swimming motions, butterfly strokes, to facilitate my way through the crowd, knocking into people, but it\u0027s so packed in the Virgin megastore that it\u0027s like moving upward and sideways across a slope and Chloe seems miles away.\\n\\n It\u0027s shocking how fast Bertrand Ripleis is moving toward her and he\u0027s practicing smiles, rehearsing an intro, a way to kiss her.\\n\\n \"No, no, no,\" I\u0027m muttering, pushing forward, the party roaring around me.\\n\\n Bertrand suddenly gets stuck, first by a waiter holding a tray of hors d\u0027oeuvres, who\\n\\n Bertrand angrily knocks away, and then by an unusually insistent Isabelle Adjani, straining to keep up his side of the conversation. When he glances over, sees how much ground I\u0027ve covered, he pushes her aside and starts cutting across to Chloe laterally.\\n\\n And then I\u0027m reaching out, my hand falling on Chloe\u0027s shoulder, and before even looking at her-because there\u0027s so much anxiety coursing through me-I glance over in time to see Bertrand suddenly stop, staring at me blank-faced until he retreats. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-191.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
