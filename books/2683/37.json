A specific picture? I don\u0027t think so, pookie.\"\n \"It\u0027s of me and a, um, certain girl.\"\n \"Who? Gwyneth Paltrow? Irina? Kristin Herold? Cheri Oteri?\"\n \"No,\" I shout. \"Goddamnit-it\u0027s of me and Alison Poole.\"\n \"You and Alison Poole? Doing-ahem-what?\"\n \"Having a little iced latte while playing footsie on the Internet, you raging f**khead.\"\n \"Alison Poole-as in Damien Nutchs Ross\u0027s girlfriend? That Alison Poole?\"\n \"She\u0027s also f**king like half the Knicks, so I\u0027m not alone.\"\n \"A naughty boy. Living on the edge. Not so nice.\"\n \"What is that-Bon Jovi\u0027s greatest hits? Listen to-\"\n \"I assume this photo was taken with Mr. Ross\u0027s and Miss Byrnes\u0027 permission and approval, you nonethical little bastard.\"\n \"Me nonethical?\" I choke. \"Whoa-wait a minute. You peddled Robert Maxwell\u0027s autopsy photos, you scumbag. You had f**king Polaroids of Kurt Cobain\u0027s blown-apart skull. You had shots of River Phoenix convulsing on Sunset. You-\"\n \"I also gave you your first break in the media, you ungrateful little shit.\"\n \"And you\u0027re totally, totally right. Listen, I wasn\u0027t putting you down. I meant to say I was impressed.\"\n \"Victor, you get written about, mainly by me, for doing nothing.\"\n \"No, man, I mean it, take it to the limit, that\u0027s my motto, so y\u0027know-\"\n \"Successful sucking up requires talent. Or at least a species of charm that you simply do not possess.\"\n \"Bottom line: what can I give you in exchange for the photo?\"\n \"What have you got? And let\u0027s make this fast. I\u0027m about to be interviewed by `A Current Affair.\u0027\"\n \"Well, um, what do you want to, like, know?\"\n \"Is Chloe dating Baxter Priestly and are you all involved in some kind of hot sicko threesome?\"\n \"Oh shit, man-no. For the last time-no,\" I groan. And then, after Buddy\u0027s suspicious pause, \"And I\u0027m not dating Stephen Dorff.\"\n \"Why is Chloe doing so much runway work this season?\"\n \"Oh, that\u0027s easy: it\u0027s her last year as a runway model. It\u0027s her big farewell, so to speak,\" I sigh, relieved.\n \"Why is Baxter Priestly at all her shows?\"\n I suddenly sit up and shout into the phone, \"Who is this little shit?\" Trying to relax, I shift modes. \"Hey Buddy-what about, um, Winona?\"\n \"What about Winona?\"\n \"She\u0027s, um, y\u0027know, coming to the opening tonight.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s an auspicious start, Victor. Oh sorry, my ass just yawned. Who\u0027s she with?\" he sighs.\n \"Dave Pirner and the Wrigley\u0027s Doublemint gum heiress and the bassist from Falafel Mafia.\"\n \"Doing what? Where?\"\n \"At the Four Seasons, discussing why Reality Bites didn\u0027t open bigger.\n \"My ass is yawning again.\"\n I pause, staring hard out the window. \"Hurley Thompson,\" I finally say, hoping he\u0027ll let it pass.\n \"Now I\u0027m vaguely enthralled.\"\n \"Um, oh shit, Buddy...\" I stop. \"This is totally not from me.\"\n \"I never reveal my sources, so please just tell your master what\u0027s going on.\n \"Just that, y\u0027know, Hurley\u0027s, like, in town.\"\n Pause. \"I\u0027m getting a little hot.\" The sound of computer keys clicking, and then, \"Where?\"\n Pause. \"Paramount.\"\n \"You\u0027re stroking my boner,\" Buddy says. \"Why isn\u0027t he in Phoenix shooting Sun City 3 with the rest of the cast?\"\n Pause. \"Um, Sherry Gibson...\"\n \"I\u0027m getting hot. You\u0027re getting me very very hot, Victor.\"\n \"She... dumped him...\"\n \"I\u0027m rock hard. Continue.\"\n \"Because of... a freebasing problem.
