You don\u0027t need to explain anything to me because it doesn\u0027t matter anymore. It does not apply.\"\n \"But they killed Sam Ho that night, Felix, they killed him,\" I say in a rush. \"And there\u0027s another movie being shot. One you don\u0027t know about. There\u0027s another crew here and Bruce Rhinebeck killed Sam Ho-\"\n \"Victor,\" Felix interrupts softly. \"Bruce Rhinebeck came over this morning and talked to us-the director, the writer, myself-and he explained the, um, situation.\" A pause. \"Actually he explained your situation.\"\n \"What situation? My situation? I don\u0027t have a situation.\"\n Felix groans. \"Forget it, Victor. We\u0027re leaving tonight. Back to New York. It\u0027s over, Victor. Goodbye.\"\n \"Don\u0027t trust him, Felix,\" I shout. \"He\u0027s lying. Whatever Bruce told you, it\u0027s a lie.\"\n \"Victor,\" Felix says tiredly.\n I suddenly notice that Felix\u0027s accent has disappeared.\n (Bruce replaces the cardboard frame in a piece of Gucci luggage with sheets of dark plastic that disguise the explosives, which are made up of narrow gray odorless strips. Embedded in the strips: gold-plated nickel wire. Bruce has lined up fifty-five pounds of plastic explosives end to end, then attached them to a detonator. The detonator is powered by AAA batteries. Occasionally Bruce glances at an instruction manual. Bentley stands behind him, arms crossed, staring silently at Bruce, at the back of his head, at how beautiful Bruce is, thinking, If only.., and when Bruce turns around Bentley plays it cool, just nods, shrugs, stifles a yawn.)\n \"I suppose I can tell you since obviously you don\u0027t like Bruce, even though I think he\u0027s quite charming and should have been the star of this production,\" Felix drones haughtily. \"You know why Bruce should have been the star of this production, Victor? Because Bruce Rhinebeck has star quality, Victor, that\u0027s why.\"\n \"I know, I know, Felix,\" I\u0027m saying. \"He should\u0027ve been the star, he should\u0027ve been the star.\"\n \"According to Bruce he has really tried to help you, Victor.\"\n \"Help me with what?\" I shout.\n \"He says you are under extreme emotional pressure, possibly due to a major drug habit,\" Felix sighs. \"He also says you tend to hallucinate frequently and that nothing coming out of your mouth is to be believed.\"\n \"Jesus f**king Christ, Felix,\" I shout. \"These people are murderers, you ass**le. They\u0027re f**king terrorists.\" Realizing how loud this comes out, I whirl around to see if anyone\u0027s behind me, then lower my voice and whisper, \"They\u0027re f**king terrorists.\"\n \"He also said he thinks that you\u0027re quite possibly an insane individual and also-however improbable the director and I thought this sounded-rather dangerous.\" Felix adds, \"He also said that you\u0027d tell us they were terrorists. So.\"\n \"He builds bombs, Felix,\" I whisper harshly into the phone. \"Oh f**k that-he\u0027s insane, Felix. That\u0027s all a lie.\"\n \"I\u0027m terminating this phone call, Victor,\" Felix says.\n \"I\u0027m coming over, Felix.\"\n \"If you do I\u0027ll call the police.\"\n \"Please, Felix,\" I\u0027m moaning. \"For god\u0027s sake.\"\n Felix doesn\u0027t say anything.\n \"Felix?\" I moan. \"Felix, are you there?\"\n Felix keeps pausing.\n \"Felix?\" I\u0027m crying silently, wiping my face.\n And then Felix says, \"Well, perhaps you could be useful.\"\n (In the Jardin du Luxembourg he\u0027s hungover again-another cocaine binge, another sleepless dawn, another sky made up of gray tile-but Tammy kisses the French premier\u0027s son, fortifying him, and in a flea market at Porte de Vanves, both her hands on his chest, he\u0027s hooking her in with his right arm and he\u0027s wearing slippers. \"Soulmates?\" he asks. Tammy smells like lemons and has a secret, something she wants to show him back at the house in the 8th or the 16th. \"I have enemies there,\" he says, buying her a rose. \"Don\u0027t worry, Bruce is gone,\" she says. But he wants to talk about a trip to southern California he\u0027s taking in November. \"S\u0027il vous plait?\" Tammy whines, eyes sparkling, and back at the house Tammy closes the door behind him, locking it as instructed, and Bentley\u0027s making drinks in the kitchen and hands the French premier\u0027s son a martini glass filled to the brim with a cloudy gimlet and as he sips it he senses something behind him and then-as planned-Bruce Rhinebeck rushes into the room shouting, holding up a claw hammer, and Tammy turns away and closes her eyes, clamping her hands over her ears as the French premier\u0027s son starts screaming and the noise being made in that room is the worst ever and Bentley wordlessly pours the pitcher of drugged alcohol into the sink and wipes the counter with an orange sponge.) \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-175.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
