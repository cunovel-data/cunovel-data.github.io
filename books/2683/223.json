This People for the Ethical Treatment of... oh shit, whatever.\"\n \"How unpredictable she is,\" Damien says. \"How, er, slippery,\" he adds. \"I guess people really do change, huh?\"\n After a careful pause, I venture, \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Well, you\u0027ve become quite the clean-cut, athletic go-getter.\"\n \"Not really,\" I say. \"You\u0027re just looking at the surface.\"\n \"There\u0027s something else?\" he asks. \"Just kidding,\" he adds desultorily.\n \"There\u0027s no swimsuit competition, dude,\" I warn.\n \"And I just got a bikini wax?\" He lifts his arms, sarcastic.\n Finally.\n \"No hard feelings?\" I ask genuinely.\n \"No feelings at all, man.\"\n I stare at Damien with admiration.\n \"I\u0027m going to the Fuji Rock Festival,\" Damien says when I start listening again. \"I\u0027ll be back next week.\"\n \"Will you call me?\"\n \"What do you think?\"\n I don\u0027t bother answering.\n \"Hey, who\u0027s this Mr. Leisure everyone\u0027s talking about?\" Damien asks.\n 3\n Bill, an agent from CAA, calls to let me know that I have \"won\" the role of Ohman in the movie Flatliners II. I\u0027m in a new apartment, wearing a conservative Prada suit, on my way out to make an appearance at a party that I have no desire to attend, and I lock onto a certain tone of jadedness that Bill seems to feed off of.\n \"Tell me what else is going on, Bill,\" I say. \"While I\u0027m brushing my hair.\"\n \"I\u0027m trying to develop interest in a script about a Jewish boy who makes a valiant attempt to celebrate his bar mitzvah under an oppressive Nazi regime.\"\n \"Your thoughts on the script?\" I sigh.\n \"My thoughts? No third act. My thoughts? Too much farting.\"\n Silence while I continue slicking my hair back.\n \"So Victor,\" Bill starts slyly. \"What do you think?\"\n \"About what?\"\n \"Flatliners II,\" he screams, and then, after catching his breath, adds in a very small voice, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Far out,\" I\u0027m saying. \"Baby, that\u0027s so cool,\" I\u0027m saying.\n \"This whole new look, Victor, is really paying off.\"\n \"People tell me it\u0027s exceedingly hip,\" I concede.\n \"You must have really studied all those old Madonna videos.\"\n \"In order.\"\n \"I think you are controlling the zeitgeist,\" Bill says. \"I think you are in the driver\u0027s seat.\"\n \"People have commented that I\u0027m near the wheel, Bill.\"\n \"People are paying attention, that\u0027s why,\" Bill says. \"People love repentance.\"\n A small pause as I study myself in a mirror.\n \"Is that what I\u0027m doing, Bill?\" I ask. \"Repenting?\"\n \"You\u0027re pulling a Bowie,\" Bill says. \"And certain people are responding. It\u0027s called reinventing yourself. It\u0027s a word. It\u0027s in the dictionary.\"\n \"What are you trying to say to me, Bill?\"\n \"I am fielding offers for Victor Johnson,\" Bill says. \"And I am proud to be fielding offers for Victor Johnson.\"\n A pause. \"Bill... I don\u0027t think...\" I stop, figure out a way to break the news. \"I\u0027m not... That\u0027s not me.\"\n \"What do you mean? Who am I talking to?\" Bill asks in a rush, and then, in a low, whispery voice, he asks, \"This isn\u0027t Dagby, is it?\" I can almost hear him shuddering over the line.\n \"Dagby?\" I ask. \"No, this isn\u0027t Dagby. Bill, listen, I\u0027m going to school now and-\"\n \"But that\u0027s just a publicity stunt, I assume,\" Bill yawns. \"Hmm?\"\n Pause. \"Uh, no, Bill. It\u0027s not a publicity stunt.\"\n \"Stop, in the name of love, before you break my heart,\" Bill says. \"Just give me a high-pitched warning scream when you read lines like that to me again.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a line, Bill,\" I say. \"I\u0027m in law school now and I don\u0027t want to do the movie.\"\n \"You\u0027ve been offered the role of an astronaut who helps save the world in Space Cadets-which is going to be directed by Mr. Will Smith, thank you very much.
