{"id":69313,"no":126,"title":"Page 126","content":"Music is melodic trip-hop on the level where Jamie and I have staked out a small lime-green couch below a massive steel staircase, white flowers surrounding us everywhere, a giant digital clock face glows in the dark, projected yards above us on the ceiling, and we\u0027re doing mellow coke Jamie scored effortlessly and because she stole a Waring blender from one of the kitchens we\u0027re drinking bright-orange slushy tequila punches and sometime during all of this Jamie changed into black Jil Sander, and unimportant paparazzi try to snap some shots but jamie\u0027s weary and I\u0027m looking a little too wired to be camera-ready so I push them away, snarling, \"Hey, she needs her privacy. Jesus-we\u0027re just people,\" and someone else floats by, taking up their interest, and I watch, a little disappointed, as the paparazzi follow, leaving us behind. Shadows are being taken aside and whispered to. We light each other\u0027s cigarettes. \"Thank you, Victor,\" Jamie says, exhaling. \"You didn\u0027t need to be that, um, firm, but I\u0027m glad you\u0027re feeling so... protective. \"Everyone\u0027s so thin and gorgeous, baby,\" I\u0027m gushing, the cocaine flowing through me. \"And their teeth are, like, white. It\u0027s not exactly how I remember London, baby.\" \"Well, since most of the people here are Americans I wouldn\u0027t worry about your memory.\" \"This is the coolest party,\" I\u0027m gushing. \"I thought you\u0027d be impressed,\" she sighs. \"What do you think of this place?\" I ask, moving closer to her on the lime-green couch. \"Well,\" she says, looking around, \"I think it looks a little too much like a new Philippe Starck hotel.\" \"Too much?\" I\u0027m asking, confused. \"I think it\u0027s multi-useful, but baby, I don\u0027t want to talk about interior design, baby.\" \"Well, what do you want to talk about?\" she says. \"Besides yourself \"No, baby, I wanna talk about you.\" Pause. \"Well, you and me.\" Another pause. \"But let\u0027s start with you. Can I have the coke?\" She slips the vial into my hand. \"Let me guess-you want to be one of those guys whose ex-girlfriends never get over them, right?\" I turn to the wall, do a few quick blasts and offer my nose for inspection. She nods her head, meaning it\u0027s fine, then I slip the vial back to her while she waves over to some guy in a gray three-button Prada suit who\u0027s talking to Oliver Payton. The guy in the suit waves back somewhat semi-pretentiously, I feel. They are both holding pythons. \"Who\u0027s that?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Someone who did the legs in that new Tommy Hilfiger ad,\" Jamie says. \"This is the coolest party, baby,\" I\u0027m gushing. \"You\u0027re feeling great and looking even better, right?\" I\u0027m nodding. \"The better you look, the more you see.\" \"I\u0027m seeing Emily Lloyd maintaining remarkable poise while eating a giant grilled shrimp,\" Jamie yawns, opening the vial, turning away. \"I\u0027m so exhausted.\" \"Hey look, there\u0027s Lulu Guinness-she made your bag,\" I\u0027m saying, totally wired. \"Hey, and there\u0027s Jared Leto-he\u0027s supposed to play me in the movie they\u0027re making of my life.\" Jamie flinches and turns back to me, wiping her nose and taking a large gulp of tequila punch. \"You need someone to teach you important life lessons, Victor.\" \"Yeah, yeah, baby, exactly,\" I\u0027m saying. \"But I think you\u0027re just having a hard time dealing with my hypermasculine vibe.\" \"Don\u0027t be a wuss, baby,\" she warns. \"Hey, if you didn\u0027t come to party, don\u0027t bother knocking on my door.\" I scoot closer to her, our thighs touching. \"Yeah, that\u0027s me.\" She lights a cigarette, smiling. \"Little Miss Trouble.\" \"\\Vhat happened to us at Camden, baby?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Because for the life of me I cannot remember.\" \"Well, I think what happened was that first we established that you were an idiot,\" she says casually, exhaling. \"Uh-huh, uh-huh, but I think I have major credibility now-\" \"You also had gigantic intimacy problems that I doubt you\u0027ve overcome. \"Oh spare me, spare me.\" I\u0027m giggling. \"Come on, baby.\" Leaning into her, I open my arms wide. \"What could have possibly been wrong with me?\" \"Besides not knowing your place?\" she asks. \"And that you liked to f**k complete strangers?\" \"Hey, I thought you were the slutty one, baby,\" I say. \"I also think that I\u0027ve, er, evolved.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-126.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
