Yanni?\" I ask the black girl. \"Really? What does Yanni mean?\"\n \"It means \u0027vagina,\u0027\" Yanni says in a very high voice, bowing.\n \"Hey honey,\" I say to Alison, nudging her. \"This is Mudpie and Yanni. Yanni means \u0027vagina.\u0027\"\n \"Great,\" Alison says, touching her hair, really drunk. \"That\u0027s really, really great.\" She hooks her arm through mine and starts pulling me away from Lauren, and Lauren, seeing Chloe approaching, lets go of my ass and finishes whatever she\u0027s drinking and Alison\u0027s tugging me away and I try to keep my footing to talk to Chloe, who grabs my other arm.\n \"Victor, what\u0027s Alison doing?\" Chloe calls out. \"Why is she wearing that dress?\"\n \"I\u0027m going to find that out now-\"\n \"Victor, why didn\u0027t you want me to wear this dress tonight?\" Chloe\u0027s asking me. \"Where are you going, goddamnit?\"\n \"Honey, I\u0027m checking for specks,\" I tell her, shrugging helplessly, Alison pulling my shoulder out of its socket. \"I\u0027ve seen none and am gratefully, er, relieved but there might be some upstairs-\"\n \"Victor, wait-\" Chloe says, holding on to my other arm.\n \" \u0027Allo, my leetle fashion plate.\" Andre Leon Talley and the massive-titted Glorinda greet Chloe with impossibly wettish airkisses, causing Chloe to let go of my arm, which causes me to collide with Alison, who, unfazed, just drags me up the stairs.\n We\u0027ll slide down the surface of things...\n Alison slams the bathroom door, locks it, then moves over to the toilet and lifts up her skirt, pulls her stockings down and falls onto the white porcelain seat, muttering to herself.\n \"Baby, this is not a good idea,\" I\u0027m saying, pacing back and forth in front of her. \"Baby, this is definitely not a good idea.\"\n \"Oh my god,\" she\u0027s moaning. \"That tuna has been giving me total shark-eye all night. Did she actually come with you, Victor? How in the f**k did she weasel in here? Did you see the f**king look she gave me when I first made eye contact?\" Alison wipes herself and, still sitting there, immediately begins to rummage through a Prada handbag. \"That bitch actually told Chris O\u0027Donnell that I run a quote-unquote highly profitable fat-substitute emporium.\"\n \"I think your meeting could definitely be construed as an uh-oh moment.\"\n \"And if you keep ignoring me you\u0027re gonna have a whole night chock-full of them.\" In the Prada handbag Alison finds two vials and stands up, her voice brimming with acid. \"Oh, but I forgot, you don\u0027t want to see me anymore. You want to break up. You need your space. You, Victor, are a major loser.\" She tries to compose herself, fails. \"I think I\u0027m gonna be sick. I\u0027m gonna be sick all over you. How could you do this to me? And of all nights!\" She\u0027s hissing to herself, unscrewing the top of one vial, doing two, three, six huge bumps of coke, then suddenly she stops, inspects the vial, then says \"Wrong vial\" and unscrews the other one and does four bumps from that. \"You\u0027re not going to get away with this. You\u0027re not. Oh my god.\" She grabs her head. \"I think I have sickle-cell anemia.\" Then, snapping her head up, she shrieks, \"And why in the hell is your girlfriend-sorry, ex-girlfriend-wearing the same f**king dress I am?\"\n \"Why?\" I shout out. \"Does it bother you?\"\n \"Let\u0027s just say-\" Alison starts coughing, her face crumples up and between huge sobs she wails, \"it was mildly horrifying?\" She immediately recovers, slaps my face, grabs my shoulders and screams, \"You\u0027re not getting away with this!\"\n \"With what?\" I shout, grabbing a vial away from her, scooping out two huge capfuls for myself. \"What am I not getting away with?\"\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-77.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
