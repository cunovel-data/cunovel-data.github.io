I\u0027ll be there by eleven.\" Bobby kisses Jamie hard on the mouth and tries to act casual but something\u0027s wrong and he can barely control his panic. I try not to stare. He notices. \"Stop gawking,\" he says irritably. \"I\u0027ll be back at the house by eleven. Maybe sooner.\" On his way out Bobby stops behind Tammy who\u0027s swaying from side to side, listening rapturously to a drug dealer called the Kaiser, and Bobby motions from across the room to Jamie, mouthing, Watch her. Jamie nods. \"Is Bobby gone?\" Jainie\u0027s asking. \"You\u0027re in fine form tonight,\" I spit out, glaring. \"Do you know how many people died at the Ritz yesterday?\" \"Victor, please,\" she says genuinely while trying to smile, in case anyone\u0027s watching. But the French film crew is surrounding a cluster of mourners laughing in the corner of the cavernous living room. Blenders are whirring at a bar, there\u0027s a fire raging in the fireplace, cell phones keep being answered. \"They killed the French premier\u0027s son yesterday too,\" I say calmly, for emphasis. \"They cut off his leg. I watched him die. How can you wear that dress?\" I ask, my face twisted with loathing. \"Is Bobby gone?\" she asks again. \"Just tell me if he\u0027s left yet.\" \"Yes,\" I say disgustedly. \"He left.\" Visibly, she relaxes. \"I have to tell you something, Victor,\" she says, gazing over my shoulder, then glancing sideways. \"What?\" I ask. \"You\u0027re all grown up now?\" \"No, not that,\" she says patiently. \"You and I-we can\u0027t see each other anymore.\" \"Oh really?\" I\u0027m glancing around the room. \"Why not?\" \"It\u0027s too dangerous.\" \"Is it?\" I ask, Smirking. \"What a cliche.\" \"I\u0027m serious.\" \"I don\u0027t want to talk to you anymore.\" \"I think this whole thing has gotten out of hand,\" Jamie says. I start giggling uncontrollably until a sudden spasm of fear causes my eyes to water, my face to contort. \"That\u0027s... all?\" I cough, wiping my eyes, sniffling. \"Just... out of hand?\" My voice sounds high and my eyes, girlish. \"Victor-\" \"You are not playing by the rules,\" I say, my chest tightening. \"You are not following the script.\" \"There are no rules, Victor,\" she says. \"What rules? That\u0027s all nonsense.\" She pauses. \"It\u0027s too dangerous,\" she says again. \"I\u0027m feeling a lack of progress,\" I\u0027m saying. \"I think we\u0027re all living in a box.\" \"I assume you understand more about Bobby now,\" she says. \"It\u0027s easier, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s easier to gauge the fear factor now, isn\u0027t it?\" A long pause. \"I suppose,\" I say, without looking at her. \"But you\u0027ll still be in my... periphery.\" \"I suppose,\" I say again. \"How reassuring.\" \"You also need to stay away from Bertrand Ripleis.\" \"Why?\" I\u0027m barely listening. \"He hates you.\" \"I wondered why he was always snarling at me.\" \"I\u0027m serious,\" she says, almost pleadingly. \"He still holds a grudge,\" she says, trying to smile as she waves to someone. \"From Camden.\" \"About what?\" I ask, irritation and fear laced together. \"He was in love with Lauren Hynde,\" she says. \"He thinks you treated her shittily.\" A pause. \"This is on the record.\" Another pause. \"Be careful.\" \"Is this a joke or like some kind of French thing?\" \"Just stay away from him,\" she warns. \"Don\u0027t provoke.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-180.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
