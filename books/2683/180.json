Maybe sooner.\"\\n\\n On his way out Bobby stops behind Tammy who\u0027s swaying from side to side, listening rapturously to a drug dealer called the Kaiser, and Bobby motions from across the room to Jamie, mouthing, Watch her.

But the French film crew is surrounding a cluster of mourners laughing in the corner of the cavernous living room. Blenders are whirring at a bar, there\u0027s a fire raging in the fireplace, cell phones keep being answered.\\n\\n \"They killed the French premier\u0027s son yesterday too,\" I say calmly, for emphasis. \"They cut off his leg. I watched him die. How can you wear that dress?\" I ask, my face twisted with loathing.\\n\\n \"Is Bobby gone?\" she asks again. \"Just tell me if he\u0027s left yet.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I say disgustedly. \"He left.\"\\n\\n Visibly, she relaxes. \"I have to tell you something, Victor,\" she says, gazing over my shoulder, then glancing sideways.\\n\\n \"What?\" I ask. \"You\u0027re all grown up now?\"\\n\\n \"No, not that,\" she says patiently. \"You and I-we can\u0027t see each other anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Oh really?\" I\u0027m glancing around the room. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"Is it?\" I ask, Smirking. \"What a cliche.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m serious.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk to you anymore.\"\\n\\n \"I think this whole thing has gotten out of hand,\" Jamie says.\\n\\n I start giggling uncontrollably until a sudden spasm of fear causes my eyes to water, my face to contort. \"That\u0027s... all?\" I cough, wiping my eyes, sniffling. \"Just... out of hand?\" My voice sounds high and my eyes, girlish.\\n\\n \"Victor-\"\\n\\n \"You are not playing by the rules,\" I say, my chest tightening. \"You are not following the script.\"\\n\\n \"There are no rules, Victor,\" she says. \"What rules?
