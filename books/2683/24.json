Or if they ask tell them their nose is too wide...\" I\u0027m sweating. \"But, y\u0027know, be careful about it...\" I pause faux- wistfully. \"Then they\u0027re yours.\" \"Jesus Christ,\" Damien says admiringly, nudging one of the goons. \"Did you hear that?\" \"How\u0027s Alison?\" I ask. \"Hell, you probably see her more than I do.\" \"Not really.\" \"I mean, don\u0027t you, Vic?\" \"Oh, y\u0027know, me and Chloe and, um, probably not, but whatever, never mind.\" After a long and chilly silence, Damien points out, \"You\u0027re not eating your muesli.\" \"Now I am,\" I say, lifting my spoon. \"JD, some milk, please.\" \"Alison, oh shit;\" Damien groans. \"I don\u0027t know whether she\u0027s a sexpot or a crackpot.\" A flash: Alison sneering at me while letting Mr. Chow lick her feet, punching open a coconut, listing her favorite male movie stars under twenty-four, including the ones she\u0027s slept with, slugging down Snapple after Snapple after Snapple. \"Both?\" I venture. \"Ah hell, I love her. She\u0027s like a rainbow. She\u0027s like a flower. Oh god,\" he moans. \"She\u0027s got that damn navel ring, and the tattoos need serious laser sessions.\" \"I... didn\u0027t know Alison had a, um, navel ring.\" \"How would you know that?\" he asks. \"Anywa-a-a-ay-\" JD starts. \"I also hear you\u0027re looking at your own space.\" Damien sighs, staring right at me. \"Please say I\u0027m hearing abstract, unfortunate rumors.\" \"A vicious rumor, my friend. I\u0027m not into even contemplating another club, Damien. I\u0027m looking at scripts now.\" \"Well, yeah, Victor, I know. It\u0027s just that we\u0027re getting a lot of press for this and I cannot deny that your name helps-\" \"Thanks, man.\" \"-but I also cannot deny the fact that if you use this as-oh, what\u0027s a good phrase? oh yeah-a stepping-stone and will then dump all of us the minute this place is SRO and then with that cachet open up your own place-\" \"Damien, wait a minute, this is a complex question, wait a minute-\" \"-leaving me and several investors along with various orthodontists from Brentwood-one who happens to be part vegetable-who have placed big bucks into this-\" \"Damien, man, where would I get the money to do this?\" \"Japs?\" He shrugs. \"Some movie star you\u0027ve boned? Some rich faggot who\u0027s after your ass?\" \"This is what\u0027s known as big news to me, Damien, and I will ponder who leaked this rumor profusely.\" \"My heartfelt thanks.\" Chapter Three \"I just wanna put a smile back on clubland\u0027s face.\" \"I\u0027ve gotta play golf,\" Damien says vacantly, checking his watch. \"Then I\u0027m having lunch at Fashion Cafe with Christy Turlington, who was just voted `least likely to sell out\u0027 in the new issue of Top Model. There\u0027s a virtual-reality Christy at Fashion Cafe-you should check it out. It\u0027s called a spokesmannequin. It looks exactly like Christy. She says things like `I look forward to seeing you here again soon, perhaps in person,\u0027 and she also quotes Somerset Maugham and discusses Salvadorian politics as well as her Kellogg cereal contract. I know what you\u0027re thinking, but she brings class to it.\" Damien finally stands up, and the goons follow suit. \"Are you going to any of the shows today?\" I ask. \"Or is another Gotti on trial?\" \"What? There\u0027s another one?\" Damien realizes something. \"Oh, you\u0027re kind of funny. But not really so much.\" \"Thank you.\" \"I\u0027m going to shows. It\u0027s Fashion Week, what else does one do in this world?\" Damien sighs. \"You\u0027re in one, right?\" \"Yeah. Todd Oldham. It\u0027s just guys who date models escorting them down the runway. Y\u0027know, it\u0027s like a theme: Behind every woman-\" \"There\u0027s a weasel? Ha!\" Damien stretches. \"Sounds fan-fuckingtastic. So you\u0027re ready for tonight?\" \"Hey man, I am a rock. I am an island.\" \"Who\u0027s gonna dispute that?\" \"That\u0027s me, Damien. All dos, and no don\u0027ts.\" \"Are you down with OPP?\" \"Hey, you know me.\" \"Crazy kid,\" he chuckles. \"Lucidity. Total lucidity, baby.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-24.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
