These people are not the Wallaces. Do you understand, Felix? I-don\u0027t-know-these-people.\"\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s the picture, Victor,\" Felix says. \"That\u0027s you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s me,\" I say. \"But who are these people, Felix?\" For emphasis I\u0027m running my hand over the photograph. \"I mean, what is this? What the hell\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"Deluded youth,\" he sighs.\\n\\n \"Where, Felix? Where?\" I ask, whirling around. \"I don\u0027t see anyone under sixty on this goddamn boat.\"\\n\\n Felix motions to the bartender for another.\\n\\n \"Felix,\" I say, breathing in. \"I think I\u0027m scared.\"\\n\\n \"You should be, but why?\"\\n\\n \"A lot of reasons,\" I whisper.\\n\\n \"A certain amount of hardship is to be expected in this life.\"\\n\\n \"I know, I know, I need to accept the bad if I want to accept the good-oh god, Felix, just shut the f**k up and look at the f**king photo.\"\\n\\n Felix\u0027s interest rises slightly as he holds the photo closer to his face and the atmosphere surrounding the bar is smoky and vague and the piano player continues with the mournful rendition of \"Anything Goes\" while various extras playing soused nannies, croupiers and beverage personnel listen, rapt, and I focus on the silence surrounding the music and try to get the bartender\u0027s attention.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been altered,\" Felix says, clearing his throat.\\n\\n \"How do you know?\"\\n\\n \"You should be able to see this girl\u0027s face.\" He points at Marina.\\n\\n \"Yeah, but I think she turned away when the flash went off.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Felix says. \"She didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"How can you tell?\"\\n\\n \"The position of her neck-see, here?\" Felix runs a finger along Marina\u0027s throat. \"The position of her neck suggests she was looking at the camera. Someone else has been-oh, how do you say?-superimposed over this girl.\" Felix pauses, then his eyes move to the Wallaces. \"I assume the same thing happened with this couple,\" he says, squinting at the photo. \"A rather crude job, actually.\" Felix sighs, placing the photo back on the bar. \"But hell, who knows? Maybe you were really drunk and feeling rather friendly so you joined another table.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m shaking my head. \"I\u0027d never sit with those people,\" I\u0027m saying. \"Look at that woman\u0027s hair.\" I order an Absolut-and-cranberry from the bartender-with lime, I stress-and when he brings it I drink it quickly, but it totally fails to relax me.\\n\\n Maybe I just need to get laid,\" I sigh.\\n\\n Felix starts giggling. \"You will.\" He keeps giggling. \"Oh, you will.\"\\n\\n \"Spare me the giggling, Felix.\"\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t you read the new draft?\" he\u0027s asking.\\n\\n \"I think the script keeps changing, Felix,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t think this is what I signed on for.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re really not accustomed to disappointment, are you, Victor?\"\\n\\n \"I think something bad happened to that girl,\" I\u0027m saying meekly. \"To... Marina.\"\\n\\n \"You think errors are being made?\" Felix asks, taking a long swallow of brandy, moving one snifter aside for another. \"I think people can know too much.\"\\n\\n \"I just... I just... think there\u0027s been some kind of- oh man-like emergency and...\" My voice trails off. I stare over at the piano player, at the extras sitting at tables, on couches, nodding thoughtfully to the music. \"And... I just think no one\u0027s responding-oh man.\"\\n\\n \"You need, I think, to find a more fruitful and harmonious way to live.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on the cover of YouthQuake magazine,\" I exclaim. \"What in god\u0027s name are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps the two are unrelated.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me I\u0027m not being wrongheaded and foolish,\" I plead. \"Tell me this isn\u0027t an \u0027extraneous matter,\u0027 Felix. I mean, I\u0027m a fairly easygoing person.\\n\\n \"I know, I know,\" Felix says sympathetically, inhaling on a cigarette. \"It\u0027s intolerable, eh?\"\\n\\n Finally I ask, \"What about Palakon? How is he involved in this?\"\\n\\n \"Who is Palakon?\" Felix asks.\\n\\n \"Palakon,\" I sigh. \"The guy who got me on this f**king boat.\"\\n\\n Felix stays quiet, then stubs the cigarette out. \"I don\u0027t know anyone named Palakon.\"\\n\\n While signaling the bartender for another drink, I mutter, annoyed, \"What?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-116.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
