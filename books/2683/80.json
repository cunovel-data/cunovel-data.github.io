Earlier in the day I was upset that Chloe and I weren\u0027t seated at Damien\u0027s table (because there were things I had to say to David Geffen and an apology I had to make to Calvin) but right now, watching Alison slumped against Damien while trying to light a joint the size of a very long roll of film, everyone very buzzed, people knocking into each other as table-hopping on a very massive scale resumes while cappuccino\u0027s served, everything sliding in and out of focus, it\u0027s okay.\\n\\n I\u0027m trying to light a cigarette someone\u0027s spilled San Pellegrino on and Lauren\u0027s talking to a kneeling Woody Harrelson about hemp production and so I tap in to Chloe, interrupting what I\u0027m sure is a stunning conversation with Baxter, and she turns reluctantly to me, finishing another Cosmopolitan, her face taut with misery, and then she simply asks, \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Um, baby, what\u0027s the story with Damien and Lauren?\" I inquire gingerly.\\n\\n \"I am so bored with you, Victor, that I don\u0027t even know how to answer that,\" she says. \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"How long have you known about Damien and your so-called best friend Lauren?\" I ask again, lowering my voice, glancing over at Lauren and Woody.\\n\\n \"Why is my so-called boyfriend asking someone he actually thinks supposedly cares?\" she sighs, looking away.\\n\\n \"Honey,\" I whisper patiently, \"they\u0027re having an affair.\"\\n\\n \"Who told you this?\" she asks, recoiling. \"Where did you read this? Oh god, I\u0027m so tired.\"\\n\\n \"What are you so tired of?\" I ask patiently.\\n\\n She looks down glassy-eyed at the scoops of sorbet melting into a puddle on her plate.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a big help,\" I sigh.\\n\\n \"Why do you even care? What do you want me to say? You wanna f**k her? You wanna f**k him? You-\"\\n\\n \"Shhh. Hey baby, why would you think that?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re whining, Victor.\" She waves a hand in front of my face tiredly, dismissing me.\\n\\n \"Alison and Damien are engaged-did you know that?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not interested in the lives of other people, Victor,\" Chloe says. \"Not now. Not tonight. Not when we\u0027re in serious trouble.\"\\n\\n \"I think you definitely need a toke off that major joint Alison\u0027s smoking.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" She snaps out of something. \"Why, Victor? Why do you think I need to do drugs?\"\\n\\n \"Because I have a feeling we\u0027re on the verge of having that conversation again about how lost and fat you were at fourteen.\"\\n\\n \"Why did you ask me last night not to wear this dress?\" she asks, suddenly alert, arms crossed.\\n\\n Pause. \"Because... you\u0027d resemble... Pocahontas, but really, baby, you look smashing and-\" I\u0027m just glancing around, smiling gently over at Beck, fidgeting with a Marlboro, searching for Chap Stick, smiling gently over at Beck again.\\n\\n \"No, no, no.\" She\u0027s shaking her head. \"Because you don\u0027t care about things like that. You don\u0027t care about things that don\u0027t have anything to do with you.\"\\n\\n \"You have something to do with me.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-80.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
