Okay.\" \"Has the money been transferred?\" I ask. \"Yes. It has.\" Pause. \"Are you okay?\" I ask. Pause. \"Yes, yes. I\u0027m just... distracted.\" \"Don\u0027t be. You need to focus,\" I say. \"Yes, yes. Of course.\" \"Someone will let you know when I\u0027m there.\" A long pause. \"Hello?\" I ask. \"I-I don\u0027t know,\" he says, breathing in. \"You\u0027re unraveling,\" I warn. \"Don\u0027t,\" I warn. \"We really don\u0027t need to see each other while you\u0027re here,\" he says. \"I mean, do we?\" \"No. Not really,\" I say. \"Only if you want.\" Pause. \"Are there any parties you want to show me off at?\" \"Hey-\" he snaps. \"Watch it,\" I warn. It takes him forty-three seconds to compose himself. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027ll be here,\" he finally says. Pause. I let it resonate. \"Are you?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m glad I\u0027ll be there too.\" \"Really?\" He breathes in, trembling. \"Anything to help the cause,\" I say. \"Are you being sarcastic?\" \"No.\" Pause. \"You figure it out.\" I sigh. \"Do you even really care?\" Pause. \"If there\u0027s anything you need...\" He trails off. \"Don\u0027t you trust me?\" I ask. It takes a long time for him to say, \"I think I do.\" I\u0027m smiling to myself. \"I\u0027ll be in touch.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"Goodbye.\" 4 I meet Damien for drinks at the Independent, not far from the club he and I are supposed to open a month from now in TriBeCa. Damien\u0027s smoking a cigar and nursing a Stoli Kafya, which personally I find disgusting. He\u0027s wearing a Gucci tie. I want to make this quick. Bittersweet folk rock plays in the background. \"Did you see this?\" Damien asks as I swing up onto a stool. \"What?\" I ask. He slides a copy of today\u0027s New York Post across the bar, open to \"Page Six.\" Gossip about the women Victor Johnson has been involved with since Chloe Byrnes\u0027 unfortunate death in a Paris hotel room. Peta Wilson. A Spice Girl. Alyssa Milano. Garcelle Beauvais. Carmen Electra. Another Spice Girl. \"For mature audiences only, right?\" Damien says, nudging me, arching his eyebrows up. There\u0027s a little hug between the two of us, not much else. I relax, order a Coke, which causes Damien to shake his head and mutter \"Oh, man\" too aggressively. \"I guess you know why I\u0027m here,\" I say. \"Victor, Victor, Victor,\" Damien sighs, shaking his head. I pause, confused. \"So... you do know?\" \"I forgive you entirely,\" he says, acting casual. \"Come on, you know that.\" \"I just want out, man,\" I say. \"I\u0027m older. I\u0027ve got school.\" \"How is law school?\" Damien asks. \"I mean, this isn\u0027t a rumor, right? You\u0027re really doing this?\" \"Yeah.\" I laugh. \"I am.\" I sip my Coke. \"It\u0027s a lot of work but...\" He studies me. \"Yeah? But?\" \"But I\u0027m adapting,\" I finally answer. \"That\u0027s great,\" Damien says. \"Is it?\" I ask seriously. \"I mean, really. Is it?\" \"Victor,\" Damien starts, grasping my forearm. \"Yeah, man?\" I gulp, but I\u0027m really not afraid of him. \"I am constantly thinking about human happiness,\" he admits. \"Whoa.\" \"Yeah,\" he says, tenderly sipping his vodka. \"Whoa.\" \"Is everything going to be cool?\" I ask. \"I\u0027m really not leaving you in a lurch?\" Damien shrugs. \"It\u0027ll be cool. Japanese investors. Things will work out.\" I smile, showing my appreciation. But I\u0027m still very cool about the situation, so I move on to other topics. \"How\u0027s Lauren?\" I ask. \"Ooh-ouch,\" Damien says. \"No, no, man,\" I say. \"I\u0027m just asking.\" Damien hits me lightly on the shoulder. \"I know, man. I\u0027m just goofing off. I\u0027m just playing around.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-222.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
