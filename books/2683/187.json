What was in the hat, Palakon?\" \"Mr. Ward, Victor, I promise you that at our next meeting I\u0027ll explain,\" Palakon says. \"But we simply don\u0027t have time now-\" \"What do you mean?\" I\u0027m asking, panicking. \"You have more important things to do? I mean, holy shit, Palakon. I have no idea what\u0027s going on and-\" \"We have other photos to show you,\" Palakon interrupts, handing three glossy 8 x 10s to me. Two people dressed in tropical clothing on a foamy shore. Yards and yards of wet sand. The sea rests behind them. White sunlight, purple at the edges, hangs above the couple. Because of their hair you can tell it\u0027s windy. He\u0027s sipping a drink from a coconut shell. She\u0027s smelling a purple lei hanging from her neck. In another photo she\u0027s (improbably) petting a swan. Bobby Hughes stands behind her, smiling (also improbably) in a kind way. In the last photo Bobby Hughes is kneeling behind the girl, helping her pick a tulip. The girl in all three photos is Lauren Hynde. I start weeping again. \"That\u0027s... Lauren Hynde.\" A long pause, and then I hear someone ask, \"When did you last have contact with Lauren Hynde, Victor?\" I keep weeping, unable to hold it to ether. \"Victor?\" Palakon asks. \"What is she doing with him?\" I sob. \"Victor met her while they were students at Camden, I believe,\" Palakon says softly to his colleagues, an explanation that doesn\u0027t accomplish anything, but I nod silently to myself, unable to look up. \"And after that?\" someone asks. \"When did you last have contact with Lauren Hynde?\" Still weeping, I manage, \"I met her last month... in Manhattan... at a Tower Records.\" Russell\u0027s cell phone rings, jarring all of us. \"Okay,\" I hear him say. After clicking off he implores Palakon to start moving. \"We\u0027ve got to go,\" Russell says. \"It\u0027s time.\" \"Mr. Johnson, we\u0027ll be in touch,\" Delta says. I\u0027m reaching into my jacket pocket while wiping my face. \"Yes, this was... illuminating,\" Crater says, not at all sincerely. \"Here.\" Ignoring Crater, I hand Palakon the printout of the WINGS file. \"This is something I found in the computer in the house. I don\u0027t know what it means.\" Palakon takes it from me. \"Thank you, Victor,\" he says genuinely, slipping it into his folder without even looking at it. \"Victor, I want you to calm down. We will be in touch. It might even be tomorrow-\" \"But since I last saw you, Palakon, they blew up a f**king hotel,\" I shout. \"They killed the French premier\u0027s son.\" \"Mr. Ward,\" Palakon says gently, \"other factions have already taken blame for the bombing at the Ritz.\" \"What other factions?\" I\u0027m shouting. \"They did it. Bruce Rhinebeck left a bomb at the f**king Ritz. There are no other factions. They are the faction.\" \"Mr. Ward, we really-\" \"I just don\u0027t feel you\u0027re concerned about my welfare, Palakon,\" I say, choking. \"Mr. Ward, that\u0027s simply not true,\" Palakon says, standing, which causes me to stand as well. \"Why did you send me to find her?\" I\u0027m shouting. \"Why did you send me to find Jamie Fields?\" I\u0027m about to grab Palakon but Russell pulls me back. \"Mr. Ward, please,\" Palakon says. \"You must go. We\u0027ll be in touch.\" I fall into Russell, who keeps propping me up. \"I don\u0027t care anymore, Palakon. I don\u0027t care.\" \"I think you do, Mr. Ward.\" \"Why is that?\" I ask, bewildered, staring at him. \"Why do you think that?\" \"Because if you didn\u0027t care, you wouldn\u0027t be here.\" I take this in. \"Hey, Palakon,\" I say, stunned. \"I didn\u0027t say I wasn\u0027t scared shitless.\" 18 Russell races down the stairs in the building on Avenue Verdier two steps at a time and I\u0027m tumbling behind him, for support grabbing on to a marble banister that\u0027s so encased with ice it burns my hand, and outside on the street I hold that hand up, panting, telling Russell to slow down. \"We can\u0027t,\" Russell savs. \"We have to go. Now.\" \"Why?\" I\u0027m asking uselessly, bent over. \"Why?\" I brace myself to be pulled along toward the black Citroen but Russell suddenly stops moving and he\u0027s breathing in, composing himself.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-187.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
