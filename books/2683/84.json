While I\u0027m craning my neck, looking for someone familiar, JD appears and takes me aside.\n \"Just let go,\" I say uselessly.\n \"Hold on. What happened to your head?\" JD asks calmly, handing me a napkin. \"Why is there blood on your tux?\"\n \"Nothing. I slipped,\" I mutter, looking down. \"That\u0027s not blood-it\u0027s an AIDS ribbon.\"\n JD flinches. \"Victor, we all know Hurley Thompson just pulverized you, so you don\u0027t need to-\"\n \"Where\u0027s Chloe?\" I keep craning my neck, looking out across the room. \"Where\u0027s Chloe, JD?\"\n JD breathes in. \"That is, however, a problem.\"\n \"JD-don\u0027t f**k with me!\" I\u0027m shouting.\n \"All I saw was Hurley Thompson dropping a newspaper into Chloe\u0027s lap. He leaned into her while he placed his hand in an ice bucket and whispered into her ear until her face-which was staring down at the paper Hurley Thompson dropped into her lap-fell, um, apart.\"\n I\u0027m just staring at JD wide-eyed, wondering at what point in the last ten seconds my hands started gripping his shoulders.\n \"And?\" I\u0027m panting, my entire body goes clammy.\n \"And she ran out and Hurley lit a cigar, very pleased with himself, and then Baxter Priestly ran after her.\"\n I\u0027m so alarmed by this that I must look really bashed-up, because JD looks into my face and whispers, \"Jesus, Victor.\"\n \"Everything\u0027s still sketchy, JD,\" I\u0027m saying while clutching the side of my stomach Hurley did the most damage to.\n \"No,\" he says. \"It\u0027s all clear to us.\" He pauses. \"It\u0027s only sketchy to you.\"\n \"JD, Cindy Crawford always says-\"\n \"Who gives a shit what Cindy Crawford says right now?\" JD yells. \"What are you talking about?\"\n I stare at him for a long time, confused, before I push him away and then I turn and race down the staircase, people rotating around me everywhere, cameras flashing, causing me to keep tripping into people who keep propping me up, until I\u0027m finally on the first level, where there\u0027s so much cigar and pot and cigarette smoke the air\u0027s not breathable and I\u0027m shoving people out of the way, constantly adjusting my focus, music booming out way too loud, minor chords crashing down around me, the Steadicam operator unable to keep up. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-84.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
