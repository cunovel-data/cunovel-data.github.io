I didn\u0027t commit any of them, Bobby.\"\\n\\n Bobby smiles patiently, making his way back to where I\u0027m sitting. I look up at him, hopefully.\\n\\n \"Is it so much better to be uninvolved, Victor?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I whisper. \"I think it is.\"\\n\\n \"Everyone\u0027s involved,\" he whispers back. \"That\u0027s something you need to know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just, man, I\u0027m just, man, I\u0027m just-\"\\n\\n \"Victor-\"\\n\\n \"-man, having a hard time having to, like, justify this and...\" I stare at him pleadingly.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you have to justify anything, man.\"\\n\\n \"Bobby, I\u0027m an... American, y\u0027know?\"\\n\\n \"Hey Victor,\" Bobby says, staring down at me. \"So am I.\"\\n\\n \"Why me, Bobby?\" I ask. \"Why do you trust me?\"\\n\\n \"Because you think the Gaza Strip is a particularly lascivious move an erotic dancer makes,\" Bobby says. \"Because you think the PLO recorded the singles \u0027Don\u0027t Bring Me Down\u0027 and \u0027Evil Woman.\u0027\"\\n\\n Silence until the phone rings. Bobby picks up. Bruce stops playing the guitar. It\u0027s the film crew from outside and they\u0027re ready. Bobby tells them we\u0027ll be right out. The film crew inside is already packing it in. The director, obviously satisfied, confers with Bobby, who keeps nodding while staring over at Bruce. On cue Tammy, Bentley and Jamie walk down the circular spiral staircase, and outside the film crew shoots us three times walking from the front door to the black Citroen, the six of us laughing, Bentley leading the way, Jamie and Bobby holding on to each other \"playfully,\" Bruce and I flanking Tammy and she\u0027s clasping our hands, looking at each of us happily, because in the movie the crew outside is shooting I\u0027m supposed to be in love with her. Jamie has to take a black Mercedes to Natacha because she\u0027s wearing a dress that cost $30,000.\\n\\n And at Natacha MTV\u0027s filming a party upstairs where the girls are all wasted and beautiful and the guys are looking their hunkiest and everyone\u0027s wearing sunglasses and waiting for assistants to light their cigarettes and there\u0027s another party downstairs where Lucien Pellat-Finet is hanging out with the hat designer Christian Liagre and Andre Walker shows up on the arm of Claudia Schiffer who\u0027s wearing a feathered jumpsuit and has a red pageboy and Galliano\u0027s wearing a little black trilby hat and Christian Louboutin plays \"Je T\u0027Aime\" on the piano with Stephanie Marais by his side singing the Jane Birkin part and we\u0027re receiving fans at the table we\u0027re slouched at, people flocking around us, whispering things, the prerequisite number of oohs and aahs, caviar sitting untouched on silver plates in front of us and it\u0027s all really youthquakey and the mood is light until Ralph and Ricky Lauren show up and tonight\u0027s theme is the unbearable lightness of being and everything is ubiquitous, the smell of shit rising up faintly from somewhere and floating all over the room.\\n\\n \"Victor,\" Bobby warns, after someone\u0027s handed me a packet of cocaine, reminding me of my assignment tomorrow. \"And hey Bentley, pay attention.\"\\n\\n Bentley\u0027s glassy-eyed from spending most of the day in a tanning bed and he\u0027s spacing out on good-looking teenage guys in muscle Ts. My foot has fallen asleep, the tingling moving slowly up my leg, my eyes glancing over at my name on tonight\u0027s invite. Photographers are taking pictures of our table. Tammy gazes away, her mouth caked with Urban Decay lipstick.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s madly in love with that busboy.\" Jamie smiles, lighting a cigarette.\\n\\n We all turn our heads.\\n\\n \"I read an article about good-looking busboys in Time magazine.\" Bentley shrugs. \"What can I say? I\u0027m easily influenced.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not going ahead with the Venice project,\" Bobby says loudly, over the din of the party.\\n\\n \"Harry\u0027s Bar?\" Bruce asks, turning away from Tammy.\\n\\n \"No.\" Bobby shakes his head while waving to someone across the room.\\n\\n Idly, without asking, I realize this means Harry\u0027s Bar will not be blown up.\\n\\n In the darkness downstairs at Natacha an MTV camera crew interrupts Bobby\u0027s discussion of something called the \"Band on the Run\" project. A VJ begs Bobby and Jamie and Bentley to move closer together so the camera can get all three of them in the frame. Happily, they comply. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-156.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
