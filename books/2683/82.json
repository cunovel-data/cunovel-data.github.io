Her eyes gleaming, Lauren brings the cocktail napkin to her lips, kissing it, wetting it, and I\u0027m holding my breath watching everything and Alison whispers something to Kelly Klein and Lauren leans away from Tim and with the hand holding the cocktail napkin pats Alison on the back and the napkin sticks and Damien makes a strangled noise.\n On the napkin is one word in giant garish purple letters: CUNT. Alison glances up briefly. She pushes Lauren\u0027s hand away.\n Next to me, Chloe\u0027s watching too and she lets out a little whimper. Damien lurches from the table.\n Lauren\u0027s laughing gaily, walking away from Tim Hutton in mid-sentence. And then he notices the napkin on Alison\u0027s back.\n Before Damien can get to Alison she\u0027s already reaching behind her neck and she feels the napkin and pulls it off and slowly brings it in front of her face and her eyes go wide and she lets out a giant mama of a scream.\n She spots Lauren making her way out of the dining room and hurls a glass at her, which misses Lauren and explodes against the wall.\n Alison leaps up from her chair and races toward Lauren but Lauren\u0027s out the door, heading up the stairs to the private VIP lounge that hasn\u0027t opened yet.\n Damien gets to Alison and while he wrestles with her she starts sobbing hysterically and the napkin falls out of Alison\u0027s hand and somebody takes it for a souvenir and then I\u0027m standing and about to run after Lauren when Chloe grabs my arm.\n \"Where are you going?\" she asks.\n \"I\u0027m going to try to, um, deal with this,\" I say, gesturing helplessly at the door Lauren just breezed through.\n \"Victor-\"\n \"What, baby?\"\n \"Victor-\" she says again.\n \"Honey, I\u0027ll be back in twenty\"-l check my wrist but there\u0027s no watch and then I look back at her-\"in like ten minutes.\"\n \"Victor-\"\n \"Honey, she needs some air-\"\n \"In the VIP lounge?\" Chloe asks. \"In the VIP lounge, Victor? She needs some air in the VIP lounge?\"\n \"I\u0027ll be right back.\"\n \"Victor-\"\n \"What?\" I say, loosening my arm from her grasp.\n \"Victor-\"\n \"Honey, we\u0027re having a fly time,\" I say, pulling awav. \"\u0027Talk to Baxter. Spin some damage control. That\u0027s what I\u0027m gonna do.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" she says, letting go. \"I don\u0027t care if you come back,\" Chloe says. \"I don\u0027t care anymore,\" she says. \"Do you understand?\" Dazed, I can only nod my head and rush out of the room.\n \"Victor-\"\n We\u0027ll slide down the surface of things... .\n I find Lauren in the private VIP room on the top floor where earlier lay I interviewed prospective DJs but now it\u0027s empty except for the bartender setting up behind a stainless-steel slab. Holly just points over a banquette, where Lauren\u0027s feet are sticking out from beneath a tablecloth, one high heel on, one high heel hanging off a totally delectable foot, and a just-opened bottle of Stoli Cristall is standing on the table and when a hand reaches up the bottle disappears, then reappears noticeably less full. The high heel falls off. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-82.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
