Reaching out, I try to touch the tattoo. \"Come on,\" I groan, \"take \u0027 your clothes off,\" but she keeps pushing me back, my c**k moving in and out of her mouth, her hair hanging down, brushing across my hips, her tongue expertly sliding up the shaft, and then I\u0027m angling myself so I can push the entire dick back into her mouth and with both hands holding my hips she starts swallowing it over and over and I\u0027m making soft moaning noises, pulling my shirt up, not wanting to come on it, and I start jacking myself off while she eats my balls, a finger pressing against my assholc that I keep brushing away but she slips it in and I start coming and afterwards, panting, things spinning away from me, through a blurry lens I notice her moving around the room opening drawers and I\u0027m murmuring \"Why are you wearing a wig?\" before I pass out, which I don\u0027t want to do because there are so many things I need to show her.\n 5\n The noon whistle is what stops the dreaming. In the middle of the night I was wrapped in blankets after I passed out but no one removed the tuxedo shirt and bow tie. Unable to stay motionless in the tightly curled fetal position I\u0027m in-due to a great deal of pain-I reach for the phone but in mid-reach realize I\u0027ve missed brunch and there\u0027s no possibility I could keep anything down anyway so I nix room service. In desperate need of water, I stumble up, stagger to the bathroom in pain, squealing \"Spare me, spare me,\" and drink greedily from the sink, which tastes awful, and then I stare at my reflection in the mirror, utterly confused: my face looks completely dehydrated and splotchy, the hair on my head is sticking up at weird angles in a totally ungroovy \u002780s kind of way and below that the sparse hair on my stomach is matted with dried se**n. After a shower the day seems halfway salvageable and much less grim. I get dressed, take three Advil, flush my eyes with Visine, then fall into a violent heap on the bed.\n I call Marina\u0027s room but there\u0027s no answer.\n 4\n I find Marina\u0027s room and knock on the door but there\u0027s no answer and, predictably, it\u0027s locked. I knock again, place my ear against the door: silence. While lingering in the corridor, out of it, still hazy, wondering what I should do after I apologize for being drunk, I notice maids five doors down cleaning rooms, moving slowly this way. I take a walk along the starboard deck but end up pacing just one small stretch of it, sunglasses on, mumbling to myself, the wind off the Atlantic causing me to weave around, until I move back to Marina\u0027s hall. Her door is open now and a maid is given her cue to enter, leaving in the open doorway a giant canvas hamper piled high with laundry.\n I knock, peering in, clearing my throat, causing the maid to look up while she\u0027s stripping the bed. Without smiling and with some sort of bossy Scottish accent, she asks, \"May I help you?\"\n \"Hello,\" I say, trying to be genial and totally failing. \"I\u0027m just looking for the girl whose room this is.\"\n \"Yes?\" the maid asks, waiting, holding the bundle of sheets.\n \"I, um, left something here,\" I say, moving into the cabin, noticing an unopened fruit basket, knocked over, on the dressing table, the phone Marina used to call me on the floor in the corner next to the bed instead of the nightstand, as if whoever was last talking on it was huddled down on the floor, hiding behind the bed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-112.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
