I look back and where Bobby\u0027s head was there is now just a slanted pile of bone and brain and tissue.\\n\\n The director is helping me into the production office that has been set up in a first-class lounge, because he wants to show me something on the video console. The crew is high-fiving one another, preparing to clean up.\\n\\n I wince when the director grabs my arm.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, nothing\u0027s broken,\" the director says, excited. \"You\u0027re just badly bruised.\"\\n\\n 1\\n\\n I\u0027m sitting on a couch by a bank of windows while the crew\u0027s doctor wraps my fingers with bandages, applies alcohol to disinfect various wounds, and I\u0027m whispering \"Everyone\u0027s dead\" to myself and a video monitor has been wheeled over to where I\u0027m sitting and the director takes a seat next to me.\\n\\n \"Everyone\u0027s dead,\" I say again, in a monotone. \"I think Jamie Fields is dead.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t rush to conclusions.\" The director brushes me off, peering at another console.\\n\\n \"She was wrapped in plastic and dying,\" I murmur.\\n\\n \"But her death wasn\u0027t in vain,\" the director says.\\n\\n \"Oh?\" I\u0027m asking.\\n\\n \"She tipped you off,\" the director explains. \"She saved lives. She saved an airliner.\"\\n\\n As if to remind me, the director hands me the printout I took from the computer in the house in the 8th or the 16th.\\n\\n WINGS. NOV 15. BAND ON THE RUN. 1985. 511.\\n\\n \"Victor,\" the director says. \"Watch this. It\u0027s rough and certain elements have to be edited out, but just watch.\"\\n\\n He pulls the console closer and black-and-white video images, hastily shot with handheld cameras, flash across the monitor, but I\u0027m zoning out on the month I grew a goatee after reading an article about them in Young Guy magazine, the afternoon I debated for hours the best angle a new designer beret should be tilted on my head, the various bodies I rejected because the girl didn\u0027t have any tits, she wasn\u0027t \"toned\" enough, she wasn\u0027t \"hard\" enough, was \"too old\" or not \"famous\" enough, how I waved hi to a model who kept calling my name from across First Avenue and all the CDs you bought because movie stars in VIP rooms late at night told you that the bands were cool. \"You were never taught what shame means, Victor,\" said a girl I didn\u0027t think was hot enough to lay but who I otherwise thought was pretty nice. \"Like I care,\" I told her before I walked into a Gap. I\u0027m vaguely aware that my entire body has fallen asleep.\\n\\n On the video monitor, soldiers storm a plane.\\n\\n \"Who are... they?\" I ask, vaguely gesturing.\\n\\n \"French commandos along with the occasional CIA agent,\" the director says blithely.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I say in a soft voice.\\n\\n Delta and Crater find what they think is a bomb in the first-class cabin and begin to dismantle it.\\n\\n but it\u0027s not really a bomb, it\u0027s a decoy, the agents are on the wrong plane, there\u0027s a bomb on a plane but not this one, what they found isn\u0027t really a bomb because this is the movie and those are actors and the real bomb is on a different plane \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-216.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
