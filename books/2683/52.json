You just don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Whoa, baby. I don\u0027t think I want to. Makes me nervous.\" I smile, shivering.\n The runner comes by the booth. \"Chloe, your limo\u0027s here and Taylor needs you in about five minutes.\"\n Chloe just nods. When it becomes clear that I\u0027ve got nothing else to say she fills the silence by murmuring, \"I just want to finish this thing,\" and since I don\u0027t know what thing she\u0027s really talking about I start to babble. \"Baby, why are you even doing this? I thought it was strictly features for Chloe Byrnes. You turned down that MTV thing.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t want me to do that MTV thing, Victor.\"\n \"Yeah, but only when I found out what your per diem was.\"\n \"No. You said no when you found out that you didn\u0027t have one.\"\n \"Might as well face it,\" I say. \"You\u0027re addicted to love.\"\n \"Chloe,\" Taylor calls from the egg. \"We\u0027re ready. And please hurry. Mr. Benoit might forget his line again.\"\n \"I\u0027ll see you later, Victor.\" She slides out of the booth.\n \"Okay,\" I say simply. \"Bye, baby.\"\n \"Oh Victor, before I forget.\"\n \"Yeah?\"\n \"Thanks for the flowers.\"\n She kisses me lightly, moves on.\n \"Yeah. Sure. Forget about it.\"\n 15\n 4:00. From my third-floor vantage the club hasn\u0027t been this bustling since its inception and tables are being set by handpicked busboys who just skateboarded in, waiters brandishing glasses and tablecloths and candles also set chairs around the tables and the carpets are being vacuumed by guys with shag haircuts and a couple of waitresses who arrived early are being photographed by shadowy clumps of people while dancers rehearse amid technicians and security teams and guest-list people and three gorgeous coat-check girls chew gum and flaunt their midriffs and pierced belly buttons and bars are being stocked and giant flower displays are in the process of being strategically lit and Matthew Sweet\u0027s \"We\u0027re the Same\" is blaring and the metal detectors sit in place at the entrance waiting to be entered and I\u0027m taking it all in blankly, considering fleetingly what it all means and also that being semi-famous is in itself difficult but since it\u0027s so cold in the club it\u0027s hard to stay still so I rush up two flights to the offices more relieved than I should be that everything\u0027s finally falling into place.\n \"Where was Beau? I called him four times today,\" I ask JD the second I enter.\n \"Acting class, then an audition for the new big vampire movie,\" JD says.\n \"What\u0027s it called?\" I throw a clump of invites on my desk. \"Fagula?\"\n \"Now he\u0027s interviewing DJs in the VIP room in case we don\u0027t get DJ X tonight,\" JD says, a fey warning.\n \"You know, JD, that outfit would look really good on a girl.\"\n \"Here, Victor,\" JD says, grimly handing me a fax.\n I KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND I KNOW WHAT YOU\u0027RE DOING is scrawled on the fax addressed to me that JD basically stuffs into my hands, looking vaguely panicked.\n \"What is this?\" I ask, staring at the words.\n \"Seven of them have arrived since you left for lunch.\"\n \"Seven of them?\" I ask. \"What the f**k does it mean?\"\n \"I think they\u0027re coming from the Paramount Hotel,\" JD says, finding another one. \"Someone has made sure that the logo was erased on top of the fax sheets but Beau and I caught half the number on the second one and it matched.\"\n \"The Paramount?\" I ask. \"What does this mean?\"\n \"Victor, I don\u0027t want to know what it means,\" JD says, shivering. \"Just make the bad man go away.\"\n \"Jesus, it could apply to anything,\" I mutter. \"So ultimately it\u0027s like meaningless.\" I crumple it up. \"Would you please eat this? Chew carefully.\"\n \"Victor, you need to make an appearance in front of the DJs upstairs,\" JD says carefully.\n \"Do you think I\u0027m actually being stalked?\" I ask. \"Wait-how cool.\"\n \"And the Details reporter is hanging out with the DJs and-\"\n I start to move out of the office, JD trailing behind.\n \"-here are more late RSVPs.\" JD hands me another fax as we head toward the VIP room.\n \"Dan Cortese?\" I\u0027m asking. \"A brave man. He bungee jumps, he sky surfs, he\u0027s a Burger King spokesperson, but he needs a nose job and I want Dan Cortese unplugged.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-52.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
