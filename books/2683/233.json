And as the final crashing verse of \u0027The Last Day of Our Acquaintance\u0027 boomed out, I faded away and my image overlapped and dissolved into an image of myself years later sitting in a hotel bar in Milan where I was staring at a mural. 15 I\u0027m drinking a glass of water in the empty hotel bar at the Principe di Savoia and staring at the mural behind the bar and in the mural there is a giant mountain, a vast field spread out below it where villages are celebrating in a field of long grass that blankets the mountains dotted with tall white flowers, and in the sky above the mountain it\u0027s morning and the sun is spreading itself across the mural\u0027s frame, burning over the small cliffs and the low-hanging clouds that encircle the mountain\u0027s peak, and a bridge strung across a pass through the mountains will take you to any point that you need to arrive at, because behind that mountain is a highway and along that highway are billboards with answers on them-who, what, where, when, why-and I\u0027m falling forward but also moving up toward the mountain, my shadow looming against its jagged peaks, and I\u0027m surging forward, ascending, sailing through dark clouds, rising up, a fiery wind propelling me, and soon it\u0027s it\u0027s night and stars hang in the sky above the mountain, revolving as they burn. The stars are real. The future is that mountain.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-233.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
