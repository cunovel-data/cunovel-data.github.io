Or so they say.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s her name?\" David asks.\\n\\n \"Shoo Shoo.\"\\n\\n \"Shoo Shoo what?\"\\n\\n \"No apparent last name.\"\\n\\n \"How did you lose the CK job, man?\" Nikitas asks him.\\n\\n \"Calvin got pissed,\" Scooter says. \"I cut my hair, but it\u0027s considerably more, er, complex than that.\"\\n\\n Silence, a considerable pause, heavy nodding, the camera crew from \"Fashion File\" still circling.\\n\\n \"Believe me,\" I say, holding up my hands, \"Calvin and I have tussled many a time.\" I do a few more bicep curls. \"Many a time.\"\\n\\n \"He gave you pretty good seats for the show, though,\" David says, stretching his calf muscles.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because Chloe was in it,\" Rick says.\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t at the Calvin Klein show,\" I say calmly, then shout, \"I wasn\u0027t at the f**king Calvin Klein show.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a picture of you at the show in WWD, baby,\" Rick says. \"You\u0027re with David and Stephen. In the second row.\"\\n\\n \"Someone find me that photo and you shall be proven wrong,\" I intone, rubbing my biceps, freezing. \"Second row my ass.\"\\n\\n One of the twins is reading today\u0027s WWD and cautiously hands it to me. I grab it and find the photos taken at yesterday\u0027s shows. It\u0027s not a clear photograph: Stephen Dorff, David Salle and myself, all wearing \u002750s knit shirts and sunglasses, slouching in our seats, stone-faced. Our names are in bold type beneath the photo, and after mine, as if an explanation was necessary, the words \"It Boy.\" A bottle of champagne topples from a table, someone calls out for a shawalla.\\n\\n So what\u0027s the story, Victor?\" David asks. \"Let me get this straight. You weren\u0027t at the show? You\u0027re not in that photo? Let me guess-that\u0027s Jason Gedrick.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t anybody going to ask how the club\u0027s going?\" I finally ask, thrusting the paper back at the twin, suddenly indignant over this fact.\\n\\n \"Um, how\u0027s the club going, Victor?\" the other twin asks.\"\\n\\n \"I want to rock-\u0027n\u0027-roll all night and party every day.\"\\n\\n \"Why wasn\u0027t I invited to the opening?\" Rick asks.\\n\\n \"I-want-to-rock-\u0027n\u0027-roll-all-night-and-party-everyday.\" I grab the WWD back from the twin and study the photo again. \"This must be a mistake. This must be from another show. In fact, that must be Jason Gedrick.\"\\n\\n \"What other shows have you been to this week?\" someone asks.\\n\\n \"None,\" I finally murmur.\\n\\n \"When you stop orbiting around Jupiter, let us know, okay?\" David says, patting me on the back. \"And Jason Gedrick\u0027s in Rome shooting Summer Lovers II, baby.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in the here and the now, baby.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what I hear,\" Nikitas says, crunching.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not really interested in what information you\u0027re able to process,\" I tell him.\\n\\n \"Everything cool with you and Baxter and Chloe?\" David asks this casually and Nikitas and Rick manage sly grins, which of course I notice.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so cool it\u0027s icy, baby.\" I pause. \"Er... what do you mean, O Wise One?\"\\n\\n The three of them seem confused and their expressions lead me to believe that they expected an admission of some kind.\\n\\n \"Um, well...,\" Rick stammers. \"It\u0027s, well, y\u0027know...\"\\n\\n \"Please,\" I groan. \"If you\u0027re going to hand out shitty gossip about me, at least make it fast.\"\\n\\n \"Did you ever see the movie Threesome?\" David ventures.\\n\\n \"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.\"\\n\\n \"Story is that Chloe, Baxter and Victor are intrigued by that premise.\"\\n\\n \"We are not speaking of Baxter Priestly, are we, gentlemen?\" I ask. \"Surely we are not speaking of that little mo waif.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s the mo?\"\\n\\n \"I mean, I know you\u0027re a hip guy, Victor,\" David says. \"I think it\u0027s like cool, really cool.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-30.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
