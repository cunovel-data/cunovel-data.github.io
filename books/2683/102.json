Listen-\" \"We read that interview with you in-oh, what\u0027s the name of that magazine?\" Stephen looks to Lorrie again. \"YouthQuake?\" Lorrie guesses. \"Yes, yes, YouthQuake,\" Stephen says. \"You were on the cover.\" \"Yeah?\" I ask, brightening a little. \"What did you think of it?\" \"Oh, it was excellent,\" Stephen says. \"Excellent.\" \"Yes,\" Lorrie adds. \"We thoroughly enjoyed it.\" \"Yeah, I thought it turned out pretty good too,\" I say. \"Dad wasn\u0027t too happy about it, though.\" \"Oh, but you\u0027ve got to be yourself,\" Stephen says. \"I\u0027m sure your father understands that.\" \"Not really.\" \"Victor,\" Lorrie says, \"we would love it if you joined us for dinner tonight.\" \"Yes, I think your father would be furious if he knew we were sailing together and we didn\u0027t have dinner at least one night,\" Stephen says. \"Or anytime you\u0027re in London,\" Lorrie adds. \"Yeah, yeah,\" I say. \"But I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to London. I think I\u0027m going to Paris first. I mean, Cherbourg, then Paris.\" When I say this, Lorrie glances at Stephen again as if I\u0027ve just made some kind of observation that displeases her. \"I\u0027ve gotta split,\" I say again. \"Please join us tonight, Victor,\" the man reiterates, as if this really wasn\u0027t an invitation but a kind of friendly demand. \"Listen, I don\u0027t mean to like seini-blow you guys off but I\u0027m really really tired,\" I say. They seem so worried by this excuse that I have to add, \"I\u0027ll try, I really will, but I\u0027ve given up on socializing and I\u0027m really quite out of it.\" \"Please,\" Stephen says. \"We\u0027re in the Princess Grill and our reservation\u0027s at eight.\" \"We insist, Victor,\" Lorrie says. \"You must join us.\" \"I feel wanted, guys,\" I\u0027m saying, walking away hurriedly. \"That\u0027s great. I\u0027ll try. Nice to meet you, cheerio and all that.\" I slip away and race around trying to find Marina, concentrating on all the practical places she might be. Nixing the Computer Learning Center, I hit various art galleries, the library, the bookshop, the Royal Shopping Promenade, elevators, the labyrinth of corridors, even the children\u0027s playroom. With a map in hand, I find then scope out the gym on deck 7: lines for the Lifecycles, the rowing machines, the treadmills, the aerobic room, jammed with elderly Japanese flopping around to lousy British synth-pop, with a male instructor with hideous teeth who waves me over to join in and I neatly barf. Drowsy, I go back to my cabin and lie down, vacantly noticing new pages of the script, faxed from somewhere, lying on a pillow along with the ship\u0027s daily paper, immigration formalities, invitations to parties. During this the entire sky is a low white cloud and the ship sails beneath it indifferently. 11 F. Fred Palakon calls after I\u0027ve finished the room service dinner I ordered and Schindler\u0027s List is playing on the small television set situated above the bed, a movie I had no interest in seeing when it came out but now, since Friday, have watched three times since it takes up an enormous amount of hours. My notes thus far? One, the Germans were not very cool; two, Ralph Fiennes is so fat; and three, I need more pot. The connection when Palakon calls seems unusually crisp and clear, as if he\u0027s calling from somewhere on the ship, but since no one else has called I can\u0027t be sure.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-102.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
