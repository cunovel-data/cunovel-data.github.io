{"id":69384,"no":197,"title":"Page 197","content":"Bobby sits at the computer wearing Helmut Lang jeans and a Helmut Lang moleskin jacket, a rusted-green Comme des Garcons sweater underneath. On the computer screen are the words BRINK OF DESTRUCTION and automatically I\u0027m thinking, Who\u0027s Brink? and I\u0027ve never heard of that band, and Bobby, in one of his \"barely tolerant\" moods, asks me, \"Where are you going?\" \"To see Chloe,\" I say, stiffly walking past him to the kitchen. I force myself to peer into the refrigerator, struggling to be casual, a very hard moment. Outside, lightning flickers and then, on cue, thunder sounds. Bobby\u0027s considering what I just said. \"Are you trying to rescue her?\" he muses. \"Or are you trying to rescue yourself?\" He pauses. \"That\u0027s not really a solution,\" he says, and then, less sweetly, \"Is it?\" \"I\u0027m just going to make sure everything\u0027s okay with her.\" \"I think that\u0027s another movie,\" Bobby says. \"And I think you\u0027re confused.\" \"So you have a problem?\" I ask, walking back into the living room. \"No,\" he says. \"I just don\u0027t think that\u0027s all you\u0027re going to do.\" He shrugs. \"It\u0027s just a... quandary.\" \"Do I really need to make arrangements with you in order to visit my ex-girlfriend?\" I ask. \"It\u0027s pretty f**king simple-\" \"Hey, don\u0027t talk that way to me.\" He scowls. \"-to grasp, Bobby. I\u0027m going to see Chloe. Bye-bye.\" Bobby\u0027s expression subtly changes, becoming bored, almost trusting. \"Don\u0027t act so wounded,\" he finally says, flashing a warning look. \"You\u0027re not very good at it.\" It seems impossible that I will ever get out of this house. Under my breath I\u0027m telling myself, It\u0027s just another scene, it\u0027s just another phase, like it\u0027s a lyric from a song that means something. \"Do you think I\u0027m lying?\" I ask. \"No, no,\" Bobby says. \"I just think there\u0027s a hole in your truth.\" \"Well, what do you want to hear?\" I ask, daring him. He ponders this, then simply turns back to the computer screen. \"I think I\u0027ve decided to listen to something else.\" \"What does that mean?\" I ask. \"You want it translated?\" he mutters. \"Sober up. Learn your ABCs.\" \"I\u0027m just trying to have a so-called normal conversation,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re being particularly successful,\" he says. \"I\u0027m not going to be put off by your negativity,\" I\u0027m saying, teeth clenched. \"Later, dude.\" The director glances up at me and nods, once. \"Okay, we need some spontaneous sound bites,\" the interviewer from \"House of Style\" says. I\u0027m walking by Bentley as he shows off a stack of 1960s movie magazines, a book of photographs featuring dismembered dolls, a new tattoo in the shape of a demon laced across his bicep. \"We\u0027ll miss you,\" Bentley says, batting his eyes at me. Outside, it\u0027s raining lightly. A bearded man worriedly walks a dog. A girl glides by holding a dozen sunflowers. I break down again, tears spilling out of my eyes. I hail a cab. Inside the cab, I\u0027m trying not to shriek. A moment of doubt rises, but I blame it on the rain and then I tell the driver, \"The American embassy.\" 11 I\u0027m sufficiently calm to minimize crying, to curb the hyperventilating. But I\u0027m also on so much Xanax that the following is merely a dark blur and the only thing keeping this scene from being totally black is the mid-level panic that still beats through me, acting as a dull light. I\u0027m just assuming we\u0027re on Avenue Gabriel as the taxi stops in front of what I\u0027m just assuming is the American embassy. I give the driver whatever bills I have left in my wallet-250, maybe 300 francs. I don\u0027t care, I tell myself as I stumble from the cab. I\u0027m vaguely aware of walking up steps past a sentry box into the building. I\u0027m glancing sideways at members of the Police Urbaine, at a machine gun, at a security camera, at a guard who responds only slightly with bland suspicion when I move by, serenely smiling. In the lobby I\u0027m allowed to walk through a metal detector without incident. I\u0027m allowed to step up to a plexiglass window. I tell the woman sitting behind the plexiglass window that I need to speak to an official. \"Un officiale...?\" In English, she asks if I have an appointment with anyone. \"No,\" I say. She asks me my name. I tell her, \"Victor Johnson.\" She asks me what this concerns.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-197.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
