He\u0027s a model-slash-actor. Unlike you, who\u0027s a model-slash-loser.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t he like a fag or something?\"\n \"I think Baxter has a major crush on Chloe Byrnes,\" she says, eyes flickering gleefully over my face for a reaction, then, after thinking about something, she shrugs. \"She could do worse.\"\n \"Oh boy, Alison.\"\n She\u0027s laughing, relaxed. \"Victor-just keep an eye out.\"\n \"What are you saying?\" I ask, stretching.\n \"What is it you always say?\" she asks. \"The better you look, the more you see. Is that it?\"\n \"Are you saying that Baxter Priestly and Chloe are-what, Alison?\" I ask, arms still spread out. \"Humping?!?\"\n \"Why are you even worried?\" She hands me back the cigarette. \"What do you see in that poor little girl besides a staggering intellect?\"\n \"What about Lauren Hynde?\" I ask casually.\n Alison stiffens up noticeably, plucks the cigarette from my lips, finishes it, starts moving toward the front of the restaurant.\n \"Barely anything. Two Atom Egoyan movies, two Hal Hartley movies, the latest Todd Haynes. Oh, and a small part in the new Woody Allen. That\u0027s about it. Why?\"\n \"Whoa,\" I say, impressed.\n \"She\u0027s so out of your league, Victor, it\u0027s not even funny.\" Alison takes her coat and purse from a stool at the bar.\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\n \"It means I don\u0027t think you have to worry about being taken seriously by her,\" Alison says. \"You\u0027re not gonna be.\"\n \"I\u0027m just having a fly time, bay-bee.\" I shrug.\n \"She apparently had that whole hair-pulling madness disease. It disappeared entirely under Prozac therapy. Or so they say.\"\n \"So you\u0027re basically saying we\u0027re caught in a trap and we can\u0027t back out? Is that it?\" I\u0027m asking.\n \"Well, you\u0027re going to have to take the back way out.\" She kisses me on the nose.\n \"There is no back way out, Alison.\"\n \"Then just give me five.\" She yawns, buttoning up.\n \"Where are you going?\" I ask sheepishly. \"I suppose a ride is out of the question considering the circumstances, huh?\"\n \"I have an extremely vital hair appointment at Stephen Knoll,\" Alison says, squeezing my cheek. \"Kiss-kiss, bye-bye.\"\n \"See you tonight,\" I say, waving wanly.\n \"Big time,\" she mutters, walking down the stairs, outside, away from me.\n 16\n Umberto guards the door at Spy Bar on Greene Street waving flies away with a hand\n holding a walkie-talkie and wishes me luck tonight and lets me in and I head up the stairs smelling my fingers then duck into the men\u0027s room where I wash my hands and stare at myself in the mirror above the sink before I remember time is fleeting, madness takes its toll and all that and in the main room the director, assistant director, lighting cameraman, gaffer, chief electrician, two more assistants, Scott Benoit, Jason Vorhee\u0027s sister, Bruce Hulce, Gerlinda Kostiff, scenic ops and a Steadicam operator stand around a very large white egg, mute, video cameras circling, filming a video of the making of the commercial, photographers taking pictures of the video team.\n Chloe sits away from them at a large booth in the back of the room. A group of makeup artists holding gels and brushes surround her and she\u0027s wearing rhinestone-studded hot pants, a minidress with a flippy skirt and she looks unnaturally happy in this twilight zone but after catching my gaze she just shrugs helplessly. Someone named, I think, Dario, who used to date Nicole Miller, wearing sunglasses and a Brooks Brothers coconut hat with a madras band and a telescope crown and sandals, is lying on a tatami mat nearby, with a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers tattoo on his bicep. I use the phone at the bar to check my messages: Balthazar Getty, a check for my tai chi instructor bounced, Elaine Irwin, a publicist from my gym, Val Kilmer, Reese Witherspoon. Someone hands me a cafe au lait and I hang out with this model named Andre and share a too tightly rolled joint by a long buffet table covered with really trendy sushi and Kenny Scharf- designed ice buckets and Andre\u0027s life is basically made up of lots of water, grilled fish and all the sports he can do and he has a look that\u0027s young, grungy, somewhat destitute but in a hip way. \"I just want people to smile a little more,\" Andre\u0027s saying. \"And I\u0027m also concerned with the planet\u0027s ecological problem.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-49.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
