Understood?\"\n \"Well, I guess I\u0027ll just have to max out my Visa.\"\n \"Really smart idea, son.\"\n Amanda deCadenet stops by the table and kisses me hard on the mouth and says she\u0027ll see me tonight and leaves without being introduced to Dad.\n \"How\u0027s Chloe?\" he asks.\n 20\n Lunch was mercifully short and now it\u0027s only 1:10 and I tell the driver to drop me off at Broadway and Fourth so I can stop by Tower Records before band practice to pick up some badly needed new CDs, and inside, the pop group Sheep-the new alternative rock band, whose single \"Diet Coke at the Gap\" is the buzz clip on MTV this month-is milling around the front of the store blinking into various video cameras as Michael Levine-the Annie Leibovitz of alternative rock-snaps pictures and \"Aeon Flux\" is on all the monitors and I scan the magazine rack for the new issue of YouthQuake to see if there are any letters about the article on me. In my basket: Trey Lewd, Rancid, Cece Pensiton, Yo La Tengo, Alex Chilton, Machines of Loving Grace, Jellyfish, the 6th\u0027s, Teenage Fanclub. I\u0027ve also snuck my modeling portfolio in and I spot this cute Oriental girl wearing white jeans with a silver chain-link belt, a V-neck jersey tunic and flat black sandals looking at the back of an ELO CD and I \"accidentally\" drop the portfolio, bathing suit shots scattering around her feet. I pause before I bend down to pick them up, pretending to be mortified, hoping that she\u0027ll check it out, but she just gives me a why-bother? look and walks away and then this cute-as-a-button little g*y guy starts helping me. \"It\u0027s okay, it\u0027s okay,\" I keep saying, pulling a thong shot out of his hand, and then I see the hottest-looking girl in Tower Records.\n She\u0027s standing by a listening station, headphones on, pressing buttons, swaying, wearing a pair of tight melon-colored Capri pants that meld into small black boots and an opened violet-beige Todd Oldham overcoat, and as I move closer I can see she\u0027s holding Blur, Suede, Oasis, Sleeper CDs. I\u0027m right behind her as she pulls the headphones off.\n \"That\u0027s the coolest record,\" I say, pointing at the Oasis CD. \"Tracks three, four, five and ten are all excellent.\"\n She turns around, startled, sees my face, and what can only be described as a strange expression-one-third worried, one-third smiling, maybe one-third something else-creases her features and then she asks, \"Do you know me?\" but it\u0027s in this teasing way that I\u0027m accustomed to and so I\u0027m able to answer confidently, \"Yeah-L.A. or Miami, right?\"\n \"No,\" she says, her eyes hardening.\n \"Did you\"-I have a small flash-\"go to Camden?\"\n \"You\u0027re getting less cold,\" she says simply.\n \"Wait-are you a model?\"\n \"No,\" she sighs. \"I\u0027m not.\"\n \"But Camden is near the target?\" I ask hopefully.\n \"Yes, it is.\" She sighs again.\n \"Yeah, yeah, foliage is definitely coming my way.\"\n \"That\u0027s good.\" She crosses her arms.\n \"So you did go to Camden?\" I ask and then, to make sure, \"The one in New Hampshire?\"\n \"Is there another one?\" she says impatiently.\n \"Hey baby, whoa.\"\n \"Well,\" she says, tapping the Oasis CD, \"thanks for the record review, Victor.\"\n \"Oh man, you know me?\"\n She slings a red suede zip-top circular purse over her shoulder and lowers Matsuda sunglasses-blue eyes-and pouts, \"Victor Johnson? I mean, that\u0027s if you are Victor Johnson.\"\n \"Well, yeah,\" I admit sheepishly. \"Actually it\u0027s Victor Ward now but, um, it\u0027s still the same me.\"\n \"Oh, that\u0027s just great,\" she says. \"So you got married? Who\u0027s the lucky guy?\"\n \"The little pinhead over there with the strawberry strudel on his head.\" I point to the g*y guy who I\u0027m just noticing has kept one of the bathing suit shots. He smiles, then scampers away. \"He\u0027s, uh, shy.\"\n Finally I realize that I actually know this girl. \"Oh man, I\u0027m so bad with names,\" I apologize. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Go ahead,\" she says, holding something in, \"be a big boy-take a guess.\"\n \"Okay, I\u0027m gonna have a psychic moment.\" I bring my hands to my temples and close my eyes. \"Karen... Nancy... Jojo... You have a brother named Joe?... I\u0027m seeing a lot of, er, Js... I\u0027m seeing, I\u0027m seeing a... a... a kitten... a kitten named Cootie?\" I open my eyes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-41.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
