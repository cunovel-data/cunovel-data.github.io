I sigh, then pause for the appropriate amount of time before asking, \"Why not?\" She stares at me, expressionless. \"People get away with more,\" I mutter. \"That\u0027s because everyone\u0027s smarter than you,\" she says. \"That\u0027s because everything you know is wrong and everyone is smarter than you. \"Baby, that picture... I don\u0027t know what it was but that didn\u0027t happen, that never happened-\" \"What never happened?\" she asks, suddenly interested. \"What that photo showed,\" I say. \"You didn\u0027t have sex with or attempt to have sex with or kiss Lauren Hynde?\" she asks. \"Is that what you\u0027re saying?\" I consider this, reword what she asked me, then blurt out, \"I\u0027m saying that-\" She moves away from me. \"Maybe you come to life when I\u0027m not around-who knows?\" I\u0027m gesturing with my hands, trying to make some kind of point, attempting to form even a sentence. \"Didn\u0027t you like, um, didn\u0027t Von talk to Lauren? Didn\u0027t she explain?\" I ask hopefully. \"No,\" she says. \"I like Lauren. I just never want to see her again.\" Chloe checks her watch, mumbles an inaudible curse. I lift myself up from the chair and move toward the bathroom where Chloe\u0027s placing jars filled with creams and oils and powders into another Gucci bag. I notice that the hand mirror I saw by the sink isn\u0027t there anymore. A razor blade and a small transparent straw sit by a bottle of perfume and I am not imagining this. \"What?\" she asks suddenly, turning around. \"Why are you still here?\" \"Because...\" I smile sadly. \"You\u0027re... my ideal mate?\" \"A mirror\u0027s your ideal mate.\" \"Maybe... \" I start, haltingly. \"Maybe if you didn\u0027t expect so much from me you might not be so... disappointed,\" I finally admit, and then, watching her reflection in the mirror, \"Don\u0027t cry.\" \"I\u0027m not crying,\" she says, surprised. \"I\u0027m yawning.\" And back down in the lobby, on my way outside, dazed, shuffling across the marble floor, I bump into Tristan, an ex-model who deals drugs, chatting with Ashton, and Tristan\u0027s magnetic in a gorgeous kind of way and though I\u0027m totally absent right now I\u0027m able to instinctively shake his hand, make the prerequisite small talk, avoid the obvious (Buddy Seagull\u0027s column, the stains on my shirt, the bruise above my eyebrow), trade compliments about our hair, recommend one or two cool foreign movies, a new band from Nevada (\"a really happening state,\" Tristan assures me), and then we move on. Outside, on the steps leading down to the sidewalk, I turn around, and through the lobby doors I see Tristan getting into the elevator and I want to ask him who he\u0027s going to see and then maybe buy a couple of grams but instead I start panicking because I make a connection and Tristan spots me staring at him and he gives a little wave just as the elevator doors close and a horrible vision breaks open in front of me of Chloe in an ambulance, another detox center in the desert somewhere, another series of failed suicide attempts followed up with a successful one and I cry out and try to run back into the lobby but crew members are struggling to hold me back and I\u0027m crying out \"No but why but why this wasn\u0027t in the script\" until I collapse and a technician props me up on the steps where I\u0027m still freaking out and shouting \"But you don\u0027t understand you don\u0027t understand\" and suddenly the director kneels beside me and gently tells the two crew members to let go, that it\u0027s okay, shhh.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-91.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
