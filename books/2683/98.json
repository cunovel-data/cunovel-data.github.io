{"id":69285,"no":98,"title":"Page 98","content":"12\n Just another sunny day and semi-balmy but with a constant headwind and I\u0027m at the pool deck holding a towel, wandering around, amiably spacey with rock-star stubble, wearing a tight Gap tank top, sunglasses lowered at the girl with the total Juliette-Binoche-if-Juliette-Binoche-were-blond-and-from-Darien-Connecticut look lying on a chaise longue in a row of twenty: tall, statuesque, killer abs, a little too muscular maybe but the hardness offset by large, soft-looking br**sts straining against a white gauzy half-shirt, the prerequisite curvy legs outlined beneath leopard-print Capri pants. On the table next to her, copies of Vogue, Details, a W Chloe and I are in, Vanity Fair and Harper\u0027s Bazaar are kept from flying overboard by a small pitcher of iced tea placed on top of them and I\u0027m instinctively moving into frame, hitting my mark. The girl suddenly rummages through an enormous Chanel tote bag-and then-a mascara wand falls from her hand which I gracefully stoop down to pick up-a rehearsed gesture I\u0027m pretty good at.\n \"Thank you,\" she says demurely, a familiar voice. She retrieves a pack of Silk Cuts from the Chanel tote and with absolutely no difficulty lights one. A cue to motion toward the empty chaise next to her.\n \"Please, go ahead,\" she says a little too loudly because of the Walkman she\u0027s wearing. I notice the case of the new Tricky cassette sticking out of the Chanel tote and mentally brush up on the last Tricky CD, reviews of certain Tricky concerts I\u0027ve read, any Tricky details from my own past I\u0027m about to use on the girl with the total Juliette Binoche look.\n Even though it\u0027s too cold to take off the tank top-and not like it\u0027s doing a good job of hiding anything- I slip out of it without removing my sunglasses, lay the towel down and ease myself on top of it, flexing my abs to get her attention. She\u0027s reading a book with the words MARTIN AMIS in giant black letters on the cover and I\u0027m hoping she\u0027s not a member of Amnesty International. A waiter appears and I order a light beer and a large bottle of mineral water, which he brings quickly. I tip him, he\u0027s gone.\n When the girl takes the Walkman off I remember a line, make a move.\n \"Hey, didn\u0027t we meet at that barbecue Kevyn Aucoin threw in New York?\"\n She takes off her sunglasses, stubs the cigarette in an ashtray, smiles without squinting and says, \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"Well, what\u0027s the story?\" I ask. \"How do I know you? You look disturbingly familiar.\" I lean on my side, staring admiringly. \"Though it could be because you\u0027re the only person on this boat born the same decade I was.\"\n But some element keeps distracting us. There is a couple-handsome and maybe in their mid-forties, dressed in fashionable beachwear that proves they\u0027re in pretty good shape-standing by the railing. The man camcords the woman clowning around in a semi-forced way against the backdrop of the ocean moving slowly behind them and occasionally they glance over at where I\u0027m lounging, the woman with a harsh, almost severe expression that morphs instantly into a garish smile whenever she catches me looking at her. The man is basically a blank and I\u0027m totally not interested.\n \"Are those your parents?\" I ask, nodding toward the couple.\n \"No, my parents are in the States,\" the girl says, glancing over as the couple now shuffles out of her line of vision when they notice her paying attention. \"Actually, though, I do know Kevyn Aucoin. I just haven\u0027t been invited to one of his soirees.\"\n \"They\u0027re quite fun as soirees go,\" I tell her, perking up. \"The whole gang is usually there. Cindy, Linda, Kate, the Sandras-Bullock, Bernhard and Gallin. Oh, and I met Sheryl Crow there too.\"\n \"I take it you\u0027re also a bold-faced name, no?\" she asks. \"Just quasi-famous,\" I shrug.\n The girl offers what doesn\u0027t seem like a fake smile.\n \"So maybe we\u0027ve run into each other at various VIP fashion events?\" I suggest. \"Brushed by each other in the front room at Doppelganger\u0027s or Jet Lounge? Shared cocktails at a private screening where we weren\u0027t aware of each other\u0027s presence, hmm?\" I\u0027m arching my eyebrows faux-lasciviously but she\u0027s not amused.\n \"You\u0027re not a photographer, are you?\" she asks suspiciously, her face tightening.\n \"Hey, no, baby, relax.\" I stall, then lift her iced tea and pick up W, flipping it open to the Star Spotting section, a photo of Chloe and me at a premiere at Radio City Music Hall. I hand it to the girl over the table. She glances at the page, then looks at me, then back at the photo.\n \"You\u0027re... Christian Slater?\" she asks, confused.\n \"No, no, the one below that.\"\n \"Oh, I see.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-98.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
