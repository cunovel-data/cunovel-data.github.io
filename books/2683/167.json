{"id":69354,"no":167,"title":"Page 167","content":"After we dry off we move into Jamie and Bobby\u0027s bedroom, next to the giant bed which has been stripped of its sheets, and all the lights in the room are on so we can see everything and Jamie\u0027s squeezing my cock, sucking on its head, and I\u0027m watching Bobby walk over to a drawer and when he bends down his ass cheeks spread wide, briefly exposing his ass**le as he picks up a bottle of lotion, and when he turns around his c**k is sticking up in a full erection and he strides back to us as I\u0027m watching Jamie put one finger inside her pu**y and then pull it out and then she starts stroking her clit and then she brings that finger up to my mouth and I start sucking on it. She sticks her finger back into her vagina and when she pulls it out she offers it to me again and I take her hand, licking the saltiness from her finger, sucking on it, and then I pull her face to mine and while I kiss her my hands slide down to her ass, then up to her waist and then up to the heavy firmness of her tits, my palms passing lightly over her tiny ni**les, causing them to harden, while she keeps trembling, moaning. Then I lay her on the bed and kneeling at the side of it I smell her cunt lips, inhaling deeply, beads of water still clinging to her pubic hair, and I\u0027m breathing gently on her and with one finger I trace the outline of her labia, not parting them yet, just teasing, and then I slide one finger deep into her pu**y, playing with her clit as I watch it deepen in color, and she\u0027s lying back on the bed, her eyes closed, and then I\u0027m strumming my tongue along her clit and then I lift her hips up and I\u0027m spreading her ass open until I can see the pink inside it... I move my mouth back up to her tits, sucking hard on the ni**les while squeezing the br**sts beneath them, and then I slide down again, my tongue traveling down the line bisecting her body, and Jamie raises then spreads her legs, her clit totally engorged now, but I barely touch it at first, deliberately avoiding it, causing Jamie to shift around continuously, trying to place herself against my tongue, whimpering, and when my tongue lightly laps at it her clit gets firmer, bigger, and my hands are squeezing the backs of her legs and then the insides of her thighs and I\u0027m still f**king her with my tongue and when I lift her hips up again I start sucking on her ass**le. Bobby\u0027s leaning in, staring intently as my tongue goes in and out of her anus while he strokes his prick off. \"God, you\u0027re so wet,\" I\u0027m whispering. \"You\u0027re so f**king wet.\" I start pumping a finger into her vagina and Jamie\u0027s bucking her hips as I move my mouth up and suck the whole labia into my mouth and then I lick her clit again, causing Jamie to thrash out another orgasm... In front of me Jamie steps into Bobby\u0027s arms and he places a huge hand under her chin and tilts her face upward and he kisses her deeply, their pink tongues entwined, and Jamie\u0027s hand falls onto Bobby\u0027s c**k and she squeezes it and then she eases Bobby down onto the bed next to where I\u0027m lying, his head at my feet, his dick at my face, and Jamie drops to her knees beside the bed and starts licking the sides of Bobby\u0027s prick while she\u0027s staring at me and Bobby\u0027s moaning and he\u0027s tonguing my feet and Jamie raises then lowers her mouth, taking in as much of his c**k as she can while Bobby\u0027s hips keep thrusting upward. She climbs onto the bed and raises herself over Bobby\u0027s dick then slowly lowers herself, her eyes riveted on mine as his c**k slides into her pu**y, and then she pulls it out until she\u0027s rubbing her slit over the head and then she falls onto it again and it slides into her effortlessly and then she stops, stays still, letting her cunt accustom itself, and then she starts riding Bobby\u0027s cock, rising up to its tip then lowering herself down hard onto his pelvis, Bobby groaning as he pumps into her, and suddenly all her muscles contract at once and she\u0027s trying not to come but she loses control and starts yelling \"fuck me f**k me f**k\" and somewhere across the room a beeper goes off, is ignored... I\u0027m on my knees in front of Bobby and he\u0027s urging me to lift his penis up so I can smell his balls and then he pushes my head back and slides his c**k all the way into my mouth and I\u0027m gagging, choking for air, but Bobby keeps it there until my throat relaxes, his hands on either side of my head guiding me up and down on his penis, then pulling it way out but keeping the head in my mouth and then pushing his c**k back into my throat until my upper lip is buried in his pubic hair and my nose is pressing against his hard, taut abdomen, his balls tight against my chin. When I look up, his head is thrown back, only the point of his chin visible above the thickly corded column of his neck. Bobby\u0027s abdominal muscles taper down from under his chest to the narrower ones at the base of his stomach and one of my hands is rubbing over them, my other hand on the place where his back fleshes out into the curves of his ass, and I\u0027m swallowing hard, my lips slicked over with my own spit and Bobby\u0027s pre-come, and I run my tongue around the head, sucking up and down, going all the way to the base of it in a slow, steady motion, my nose buried in Bobby\u0027s sweaty pubic hair, and then he starts f**king my face harder...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-167.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
