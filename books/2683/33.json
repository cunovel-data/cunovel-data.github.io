The probability rate is that it will, um...\" JD squints over at Beau again. \"Be published,\" Beau whispers. \"Be published are, um...\" JD pauses. \"Oh yeah, `up there.\u0027\" Silence, until I clear my throat and open my eyes. \"How long were you going to wait until you fed me this tidbit of info?\" \"I paged you the minute this rumor was verified.\" \"Verified by who?\" \"I don\u0027t divulge my sources.\" \"When?\" I\u0027m groaning. \"Okay? How about when?\" \"There really is no when, Victor.\" JD swallows nervously. \"I just confirmed what you wanted me to. The photo exists. Of what? I can only guess by your, um, description yesterday,\" JD says. \"And here\u0027s Buddy\u0027s number.\" A long pause, during which Blur plays and I\u0027m glancing around the office, finally touching a plant. \"And, um, Chloe called and said she wants to see you before Todd\u0027s show,\" JD says. \"What did you tell her?\" I sigh, looking at the phone number JD handed me. \"`Your poorly dressed bitter half is having lunch with his father at Nobu.\u0027\" \"I\u0027m being reminded of a bad lunch I haven\u0027t even had yet?\" I cringe. \"Jesus, what a day.\" \"And she says thanks for the flowers.\" \"What flowers?\" I ask. \"And will you puh-leeze stop staring at my bulge?\" \"Twelve white French tulips delivered backstage at the Donna Karan show.\" \"Well, thank you for sending them for me, JD,\" I mutter, moving back to the couch. \"There is a reason I\u0027m paying you two dollars an hour.\" Pause. \"I didn\u0027t... send the flowers, Victor.\" Pause. My turn. \"Well, I didn\u0027t send the flowers.\" Pause. \"There was a card, Victor. It said, \u0027Ain\u0027t no woman like the one I\u0027ve got\u0027 and `Baby, I\u0027m-a want you, Baby, I\u0027m-a need you.\u0027\" JD looks at the floor, then back at me. \"That sounds like you.\" \"I can\u0027t deal with this right now.\" I wave my arms around but then realize who might have sent the flowers. \"Listen, do you know this kid named Baxter Priestly?\" \"He\u0027s the next Michael Bergin.\" \"Who\u0027s the last Michael Bergin?\" \"Baxter Priestly\u0027s in the new Darren Star show and in the band Hey That\u0027s My Shoe. He\u0027s dated Daisy Fuentes, Martha Plimpton, Liv Tyler and Glenda Jackson, though not necessarily in that order.\" \"Beau, I\u0027m on a lot of Klonopin right now, okay, so nothing you\u0027re saying is really registering with me.\" \"Cool, that\u0027s cool, Victor.\" \"What do I do about Baxter Priestly?\" I moan. \"He of the faggy cheekbones.\" \"You jealous f**k,\" Beau hisses. \"What do you mean, what do you do about him?\" JD asks. \"I mean, I know what I\u0027d do.\" \"Amazing cheekbones,\" Beau says sternly. \"Yeah, but what a lunkhead. And I don\u0027t want to suck him off,\" I mutter. \"Hand me that fax.\" \"What does Baxter Priestly have to do with anything?\" \"Enrolling him in a total-immersion English course wouldn\u0027t hurt. Oh shit-I\u0027ve got to get going. Let\u0027s get down to business.\" I squint at the fax. \"Does Adam Horowitz go under Ad-Rock or Adam Horowitz?\" \"Adam Horowitz.\" \"Okay, what\u0027s this? New RSVPs?\" \"People requesting to be invited.\" \"Shoot. Run through \u0027em.\" \"Frank De Caro?\" \"No. Yes. No. Oh god, I can\u0027t do this now.\" \"Slash and Lars Ulrich are coming together,\" JD says. \"And from MTV, Eric Nies and Duff McKagan,\" Beau adds. \"Okay, okay.\" \"Chris Isaak is a yes, right?\" JD asks. \"The perfect cutie,\" Beau says. \"He\u0027s got ears like Dumbo, but whatever. I guess I\u0027d do him if I was a fag,\" I sigh. \"Is Flea under F or does he have like a real name?\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" JD says. \"Flea\u0027s coming with Slash and Lars Ulrich.\" \"Wait a minute,\" I say. \"Isn\u0027t Axl coming with Anthony?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Beau and JD look at each other uncertainly. \"Don\u0027t tell me Anthony Kiedis isn\u0027t coming,\" I groan. \"He\u0027s coming, Victor, he\u0027s coming,\" Beau says. \"Just not with Axl.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-33.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
