I tentatively sit up, bracing myself, but I\u0027ve apparently slept off what should have been a major hangover. I check out the surroundings: a room done in ash gray and totally minimalist, a large steel vase filled with white tulips, lots of gorgeous chrome ashtrays scattered everywhere, a steel nightstand where a tiny black phone sits on a copy of next month\u0027s Vanity Fair with Tom Cruise on the cover, a Jennifer Bartlett painting hanging over the bed. I open a steel blind and peer out at what looks like a reasonably fashionable London street, though I\u0027m not quite sure where. There are no clocks in the room so I have no idea what time it is but the way the clouds are racing past the sun above the skylight suggests it\u0027s not morning.\\n\\n I call the Four Seasons asking for messages but there aren\u0027t any and a flicker of panic I think I can control starts spreading and I wash it off in the shower adjacent to the bedroom, the stall made up of pale-green and dark-gray tiles, and the bathtub Jamie and I used last night is drained, melted candles on its rim, Kiehl\u0027s products neatly lined up next to stainless-steel sinks. I dry off and take a Ralph Lauren bathrobe hanging from a hook and drape it over me before opening the door very slowly because I\u0027m unsure of what\u0027s behind it.\\n\\n 6\\n\\n I\u0027m standing on what looks like the second floor of a three-story town house and everything is stark and functional and so open you can\u0027t really hide anywhere. I\u0027m moving down a hallway-passing bedrooms, a study, two bathrooms, rows of empty shelves-heading toward a staircase that will take me to the first floor, and the color scheme incorporates aqua and apple and cream but ash dominates-the color of chairs and couches and comforters and desks and vases and the carpets lining the bleached oak floors-and then moving down the stairs, gripping the cold steel railing, I step into a huge open space divided in two by a series of tall steel columns and the floors are suddenly terrazzo and the windows are just cubes of opaque glass. There\u0027s a dining area where Frank Gehry chairs surround a giant Budeiri granite table below diffused lighting. There\u0027s a salmon-hued kitchen where shelves hang by steel rods and the vintage refrigerator contains yogurt, various cheeses, a tin of unopened caviar, Evian, half a round of focaccia; and in a cupboard, Captain Crunch, bottles of wine. The whole place seems transitory and it\u0027s freezing and I\u0027m shivering uncontrollably and there\u0027s a profusion of cell phones piled on a fancy pink table and I\u0027m thinking this is all too 1991.\\n\\n The sound of Counting Crows on a stereo coming from the giant space in the middle of the house is what I\u0027m moving toward and as I turn a steel column what comes into view is a massive pistachio-colored sofa and a big-screen TV with the volume off-Beavis and Butthead sitting rigid-along with an unplugged pinball machine standing next to a long bar made of distressed granite where two backgammon boards sit and I\u0027m coming up behind a guy wearing a USA Polo Sport sweatshirt and baggy gray shorts hiked up a little too high and he\u0027s leaning over a computer where diagrams of airplanes keep flashing across the blue screen and on that desk is an Hermes rucksack with a copy of a book by Guy Debord hanging out of it along with various manila envelopes someone\u0027s doodled drawings of caterpillars all over. The guy turns around.\\n\\n \"I am freezing,\" he shouts. \"I am f**king freezing.\"\\n\\n Startled, I just nod and murmur, \"Yeah... it\u0027s cold, man.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s about six foot one with thick black hair cut very short and swept back, his impossibly natural-looking tan covering an underlying pink hue, and when I see those cheekbones I\u0027m immediately thinking: Hey, that\u0027s Bobby Hughes. Dark-green eyes flash over at me and a bleachy white smile lifts up a chiseled jawline.\\n\\n \"Please allow me to introduce myself,\" he says, holding out a hand attached to a muscular forearm, bicep bulging involuntarily. I\u0027m Bobby.\"\\n\\n \"Hey man,\" I say, taking it. \"I\u0027m Victor.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-132.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
