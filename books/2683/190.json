{"id":69377,"no":190,"title":"Page 190","content":"I\u0027m just trying not to cry again while standing behind Bobby. On the computer screen: designs for a device, a breakdown of the components that make up the plastic explosive Remform, prospective targets. Jamie\u0027s in the kitchen, carefully reading Tammy\u0027s prescription while pulling a bottle of Evian out of the refrigerator. \"How\u0027s she doing?\" Jamie asks Bobbv. \"If it\u0027s any consolation?\" he asks back. \"Better.\" Jamie walks past me blindly and moves slowly up the spiral staircase, maneuvering around crew members, thinking maybe she should feel more for me than she really does but my fear doesn\u0027t move her, it\u0027s isolated, it\u0027s not hip, it doesn\u0027t sing. I\u0027m touching Bobby\u0027s shoulders because I need to. He stretches away from me, mutters \"Don\u0027t\" and then, \"That\u0027s not a possibility anymore.\" A long silence, during which I try to learn something. \"You look thin,\" Bobby says. \"When\u0027s the last time you worked out? You\u0027re looking too skinny. Slightly whitish too.\" \"I just need some sleep, man.\" \"That\u0027s not an explanation,\" Bobby says. \"You need a motivational workshop.\" \"I don\u0027t think so,\" I say, my voice cracking. But Bobby might as well be submerged in a pool. We might as well be having a conversation underneath a waterfall. He doesn\u0027t even need to be in this room. He\u0027s just a voice. I might as well be talking on the phone with someone. I could be viewing this through a telescope. I might as well be dreaming this. Something hits me: but isn\u0027t that the point? Bobby walks silently into the kitchen. \"Things are, um, falling apart,\" I\u0027m saying. \"And no one\u0027s acting like they are.\" \"What\u0027s falling apart?\" Bobby says, walking back up to me. \"I think things are right on schedule.\" Pause. \"What... schedule?\" I\u0027m asking. \"What... things?\" Pause. \"Bobby?\" \"What things?\" \"Yeah... what things?\" \"Just things.\" Bobby shrugs. \"Just things. Things about to happen.\" Pause. \"And... then?\" \"And then?\" \"Yeah... and then?\" \"And then?\" I\u0027m nodding, tears spilling down my face. \"And then? Boom,\" he says serenely, lightly slapping my face, his hand the temperature of an icicle. On cue from upstairs: Jamie starts screaming. Even within the artfully lit shadows of the bathroom Tammy Devol and Bruce Rhinebeck shared, you can easily make out the bathtub overflowing with dark-red water, Tammy\u0027s floating face, its shade a light blue, her eyes open and yellowish. Our attention is also supposed to be drawn to the broken Amstel Light bottle that sits on the tub\u0027s edge and the groovy patterns her blood made on the tiled walls as it shot out of her veins. Tammy\u0027s slashed wrists have been cut to the bone-but even that wasn\u0027t \"enough,\" because somehow she managed to slice her throat open very deeply (but you know it\u0027s too deep, you know she couldn\u0027t have done this, though you can\u0027t say anything because you know that scenes are filmed without you and you know that a different script exists in which you are not a character and you know it\u0027s too deep) and because it smells so much like what I imagined a room covered in blood would smell like and Jamie\u0027s screaming so loudly, it\u0027s hard to start piecing things together, make the appropriate connections, hit that mark, and I can\u0027t stop gasping. Chapter Seventeen It\u0027s the things you don\u0027t know that matter most. Two propmen, both wearing dust masks, swiftly force themselves past us and lift Tammy nude from the tub, her wrists and neck looking like they burst open outward, and a large purple dildo slides out of her cunt, splashing back into the bloody bathwater. My eyes are homing in on her navel ring. Jamie has backed out of the bathroom and into Bentley\u0027s arms. She struggles, hugs him, pulls away again. She holds a hand to her mouth. Her face is red, like it\u0027s burning. In a corner of the bedroom Bobby is talking to the director, both of them motionless except for an occasional nod. Jamie tries to get away from Bentley and shambles madly toward Tammy\u0027s bedroom but she\u0027s blocked because another propman, also wearing a dust mask, is hauling a mattress soaked with blood down the hallway, to be burned in the courtyard. Jamie stares at the stained mattress in horror-at its truth-and Bentley holds on to her as she flings herself at Tammy\u0027s bed, Bentley falling with her, and screaming, she lunges for the script on Tammy\u0027s nightstand and hurls it at Bobby and the director. She struggles with a pillow, absurdly. Her screaming intensifies, is a variation on the earlier screaming.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-190.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
