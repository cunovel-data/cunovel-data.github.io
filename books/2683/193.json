Exhaling, I make a face and hand the cigarette to Chloe. \"No, I\u0027m not smoking anymore,\" she says, smiling, taking the cigarette from me and dropping it into a nearby beer bottle. \"I shouldn\u0027t even be chewing this stuff,\" she says, making a face. Bobby and Bentley get closer, casually determined. \"We can\u0027t talk here,\" I\u0027m saying. \"I can\u0027t talk here.\" \"It\u0027s really loud,\" she says, nodding. \"Listen.\" I breathe in. \"Where are you staying?\" \"At Costes,\" she says. \"Where are you staying?\" \"I\u0027m just, um, just staying with some people.\" \"Who?\" \"Bobby Hughes,\" I say because I can\u0027t get away with a lie. \"Oh really?\" she says. \"I didn\u0027t know you knew him.\" \"And Jamie Fields. I went to Camden with her. But they\u0027re a couple. Bobby and Jamie are a couple.\" \"You don\u0027t need to explain, Victor.\" \"No, no, no, it\u0027s not like that,\" I keep insisting. \"They\u0027re together. I\u0027m just staying at their place.\" A careful pause. \"But didn\u0027t you use to date her?\" Chloe asks. \"Yeah, yeah, but she\u0027s with Bobby Hughes now,\" I say. \"What\u0027s he like?\" Chloe asks, and then, \"Victor, you\u0027ve got to calm down, you\u0027re freaking me out.\" \"I\u0027m not seeing Jamie Fields,\" I say. \"I have no interest whatsoever in Jamie Fields anymore.\" \"Victor, you don\u0027t need to explain,\" Chloe says. \"I said it\u0027s okay.\" \"I know, I know.\" My eyes are wet and blinking. \"So what\u0027s the address?\" she asks. \"Where you are?\" I\u0027m too afraid to give it out so I just tell her the name of a street in the 8th. \"Posh,\" she says, and then, uneasily, \"People live there?\" \"So I\u0027ll call you, okay?\" Suddenly Chloe looks up at someone behind me and, smiling widely, jumps off the bench and shouts, \"Oh my god-Bentley!\" \"Chloe baby,\" Bentley cries out, swingerish, as he grabs her in a giant hug. She\u0027s squealing happily, spinning around, Bobby silently waiting on the sidelines, listening patiently to their requisite small talk. I force myself to acknowledge Bobby\u0027s presence as he continues to stare at Chloe, his eyes black and waxy, but then Chloe\u0027s smiling at him and suddenly cameras are flashing all around us and as the four of us stand together, pretending we\u0027re not posing casually for the paparazzi, Bobby lifts Chloe\u0027s hand up. \"How gallant,\" Chloe whispers mock-seriously as Bobby kisses her hand and when he lifts that hand to kiss it the urge to knock his face away almost destroys me and I fall back on the bench, defeated. Bobby\u0027s saying, \"We\u0027re sorry we have to take him away from you.\" He gestures vaguely at me. This moves me to say, \"I think I\u0027m being accosted.\" \"It\u0027s okay,\" Chloe says. \"I have a show tomorrow morning.\" \"Let\u0027s leave, Victor,\" Bentley says. \"Come on, guy.\" \"Leave for what?\" I ask, refusing to get up from the bench. \"It\u0027s midnight.\" \"No it\u0027s not,\" Bobby says, checking his watch. \"Leave for what?\" I ask again. \"We have a dinner party we\u0027re late for,\" Bobby explains to Chloe. \"Plus a really shitty band\u0027s about to play. It\u0027s a good opportunity to split.\" \"Baby.\" Bentley\u0027s kissing Chloe again. \"We are definitely partying while you\u0027re here. That is a promise.\" \"It\u0027s great to see you again, Bentley,\" Chloe says, and then to Bobby, \"And it\u0027s nice to finally meet you.\" Bobby blushes on cue. \"And you,\" is all he says but it\u0027s so loaded with references that I start shaking uncontrollably. \"Let\u0027s go,\" Bentley\u0027s saying to me. \"Get up.\" \"Maybe you should just leave without me,\" I tell him. \"It\u0027s too late to eat.\" \"I have a remarkable metabolism,\" Bobby says. \"It\u0027ll be okay.\" \"Chloe,\" I say. \"Do you want to have a drink with me?\" \"Victor,\" Bobby says, hurt. Chloe gauges Bobby\u0027s reaction. \"Listen, I have to unpack. I\u0027m jetlagged,\" Chloe says. \"We have a press conference tomorrow morning. I have a photo shoot with Gilles Bensimon at twelve, so... not tonight, sorry. \"Let\u0027s cancel,\" I tell Bobby.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-193.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
