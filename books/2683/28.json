Look, no hands!\"\n This causes Reed to push up the speed, which I thought was impossible because I didn\u0027t know StairMasters could go past level 10.\n \"Hey, am I invited to the dinner tonight?\" Reed asks. \"I didn\u0027t see my name mentioned in any of the columns.\"\n \"Yeah, you\u0027re at table 78 with the Lorax and Pauly Shore,\" I snap. \"JD-talk to me.\"\n \"Now don\u0027t get too excited, Victor,\" JD says breathlessly. \"But we\u0027ve-myself, Beau and Peyton-set up an interview with DJ X.\"\n \"With who?\"\n \"DJ X. You have a meeting with him at Fashion Cafe at five today,\" JD says. \"He\u0027s willing to do the party tonight.\"\n \"I\u0027m on a StairMaster now, baby.\" I\u0027m trying not to pant. \"What? Fashion Cafe?\"\n \"Victor, DJ X is the hottest DJ in town,\" JD says. \"Imagine the publicity and then come all over yourself. Go ahead-shoot that load.\"\n \"I know, I know. Just hire him,\" I say.\n \"Tell him we\u0027ll pay anything he wants.\"\n \"He wants to meet with you first.\"\n \"Oh dear god.\"\n \"He needs some kind of reassurance.\"\n \"Send him a bag of candy corn. Send him some cute, extrasuckable pacifiers. Tell him you give excellent head... do you?\"\n \"Victor,\" JD says, exasperated. \"He won\u0027t do it without meeting you first. We need him here tonight. Do it.\"\n \"I\u0027m taking commands from someone who uses the word `dish\u0027 as a verb?\" I yell. \"Shut up.\"\n \"Fashion Cafe,\" JD says. \"Five o\u0027clock. I\u0027ve checked your schedule. You can make it.\"\n \"JD, I\u0027m in the middle of becoming some kind of brooding god,\" I groan. \"I mean, is it too f**king much to ask-\"\n \"Fashion Cafe at five. Bye, Victor.\" JD clicks off.\n \"JD-don\u0027t click off on me, don\u0027t you dare click off on me.\" I click off myself and blindly announce, \"I\u0027m suddenly seized by the need to climb.\"\n \"I think you\u0027ve been doing that your whole life, buddy,\" Reed says sadly.\n \"You turned down a Reebok ad and that makes you tough?\"\n After \"ET\" films me doing a thousand crunches and I\u0027ve moved over to the Treadwall, an indoor rock-climbing simulator where you stay in one place while climbing, I notice Details girl slouching against a wall, holding her pad under the debut issue of a new magazine called Bubble. It\u0027s so cold in the gym that it feels like I\u0027m climbing a glacier.\n \"Jesus,\" I moan, noticing the magazine\u0027s cover. \"Yeah, that\u0027s just great. Luke Perry\u0027s opinion of Kurt f**king Russell. We need more of that.\"\n \"So what\u0027s the story?\" she asks vacantly. \"Excited about tonight?\"\n \"Remember what the dormouse said,\" I say cryptically, watching Dillon walk by slurping a powershake. \"Hey Matt, rock on.\"\n \"You\u0027re really into this,\" Details girl says.\n \"What\u0027s wrong with looking good?\"\n She ponders this semi-thoughtfully. \"Well, what if it\u0027s at the expense of something else? I\u0027m not implying anything. It\u0027s just a hypothetical. Don\u0027t be insulted.\"\n \"I forgot the question.\"\n \"What if it\u0027s at the expense of something else?\"\n \"What\u0027s... something else?\"\n \"I see.\" She attempts to complete a facial expression I\u0027d hoped she wouldn\u0027t.\n \"Hey baby, we\u0027re all in this together,\" I grunt, my hands dusted with chalk. \"Yeah, I wanna give this all up and feed the homeless. I wanna give this all up and teach orangutans sign language. I\u0027m gonna bike around the countryside with my sketchbook. I\u0027m gonna-what? Help improve race relations in this country? Run for f**king President? Read my lips: Spare me.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-28.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
