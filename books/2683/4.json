Peyton stands there looking hopefully up at me, quivering.\\n\\n \"Uh, Peyton, you\u0027re really whacked out, aren\u0027t you?\" I ask quietly.\\n\\n Shamefully, Peyton nods as if coaxed. He looks away.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve had a pretty tough life, right?\" I ask gently.\\n\\n \"Victor, please.\" JD steps in. \"Peyton was joking about the specks. We\u0027re not saving the specks. I\u0027m with you. They\u0027re just not worth it. They die.\"\\n\\n While lighting a gargantuan joint, camcorder guy shoots out the huge expanse of French windows, the lens staring at a view of a leafless Union Square Park, at a truck with a massive Snapple logo driving by, limousines parked at a curb. We are moving down another set of stairs, heading toward the bottom.\\n\\n \"Will someone please just give me one spontaneous act of goodness? Remove the specks. Bongo, go back to the kitchen. Kenny Kenny, you get a consolation prize. Peyton, make sure Kenny Kenny gets a couple of colanders and a nice flat spatula.\" I wave them off, glaring. We leave Kenny Kenny behind, on the verge of tears, rubbing a shaky hand over the tattoo of Casper the Friendly Ghost on his bicep. \"Ciao.\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Victor. The average life span of a club is what-four weeks? By the time we close, no one\u0027s gonna notice them.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s your attitude, JD, there\u0027s the door.\"\\n\\n \"Oh Victor, let\u0027s be realistic-or at least fake it. This isn\u0027t 1987 anymore.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not in a realistic mood, JD, so spare me.\"\\n\\n Passing a pool table, I grab the 8 ball and slam-roll it into the corner pocket. The group is moving farther down into the club. We\u0027re now at the first floor and it\u0027s getting darker and Peyton introduces me to a huge black guy with wraparound sunglasses standing by the front entrance eating takeout sushi.\\n\\n \"Victor, this is Abdullah, but we shall call him Rocko, and he\u0027s handling all the security and he was in that TLC video directed by Matthew Ralston. That toro looks good.\"\\n\\n \"My middle name is Grand Master B.\"\\n\\n \"His middle name is Grand Master B,\" JD says.\\n\\n \"We shook hands last week in South Beach,\" Abdullah tells me.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s nice, Abdullah, but I wasn\u0027t in South Beach last week even though I\u0027m semi-famous there.\" I glance over at the Details girl. \"You can write that down.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah man, you were in the lobby of the Flying Dolphin, getting your photo taken,\" Rocko tells me. \"You were surrounded by clams.\"\\n\\n But I\u0027m not looking at Rocko. Instead my eyes have focused on the three metal detectors that line the foyer, a giant white chandelier hanging above them, dimly twinkling.\\n\\n \"You did, um, know about these, right?\" JD asks. A meek pause. \"Damien... wants them.\"\\n\\n \"Damien wants what?\"\\n\\n \"Um.\" Peyton gestures with his arms as if the metal detectors were prizes. \"These.\"\\n\\n \"Well, why don\u0027t we just throw in a baggage check-in, a couple of stewardesses and a DC-10? I mean, what in the hell are these?\"\\n\\n \"This is security, man,\" Abdullah says.\\n\\n \"Security? Why don\u0027t you just spend the night frisking the celebrities as well?\" I ask. \"What? You think this is a party for felons?\"\\n\\n \"Mickey Rourke and Johnny Depp both RSVP\u0027d yes for dinner,\" Peyton whispers in my ear.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027d like us to frisk the guests-\" Rocko starts.\\n\\n \"What? I\u0027m gonna have Donna Karan frisked? I\u0027m gonna have Marky Mark frisked? I\u0027m gonna have f**king Diane Von Furstenberg frisked?\" I shout. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\\n\\n \"No, baby,\" Peyton says. \"You\u0027re going to have the metal detectors so Diane Von Furstenberg and Marky Mark aren\u0027t frisked.\"\\n\\n \"Chuck Pfeiffer has a metal plate in his goddamned head! Princess Cuddles has a steel rod in her leg?\" I shout.\\n\\n JD tells the girl reporter, \"Skiing accident in Gstaad, and don\u0027t ask me how to spell that.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s gonna happen when Princess Cuddles walks in through one of these things and alarms go off and buzzers and lights and - Jesus, she\u0027ll have a f**king heart attack. Does anybody really want to see Princess Cuddles have a coronary?\"\\n\\n \"On the guest list we\u0027ll mark down that Chuck Pfeiffer has a metal plate in his head and that Princess Cuddles has a steel cod in her leg,\" Peyton says, mindlessly writing it down on a notepad. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-4.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
