Now it\u0027s her turn to lean in. \"We have ways of making you talk,\" she whispers back.\\n\\n Playfully, I lean in again and say with a husky voice, \"Oh, I bet you do.\"\\n\\n But Jamie doesn\u0027t smile at this-just suddenly seems preoccupied with something else, which may or may not concern me. Withdrawn and pensive, she sighs and fixes her eyes on a point behind my back. I turn around and glance at a row of David Bailey photographs lining the wall.\\n\\n \"Hey baby,\" I start, \"you seem tired all of a sudden. Are you like really beat?\"\\n\\n \"If you had to deliver lines like \u0027Once Farris gets hold of the scepter it\u0027s over for your planet\u0027 all day, you\u0027d be soul-sick too,\" she says tiredly. \"Japanese investors-what\u0027s left to say?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, but I am soul-sick,\" I exclaim, trying to cheer her up. \"A girlfriend once told me so,\" I say mock-proudly.\\n\\n \"Who are you seeing now?\" she asks listlessly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m off relationships for now. \u0027Be more sensitive, be more macho.\u0027 Jesus, forget it.\" Pause. \"I\u0027m chasing hookers instead.\"\\n\\n Chapter Twelve\\n\\n \"Speaking of which-what ever happened to Chloe Byrnes?\" she asks. \"Or did she OD yet?\" Jamie shrugs, then reconsiders. \"I suppose I would\u0027ve heard about that.\"\\n\\n \"No, she\u0027s cool,\" I say, figuring out how to play the current situation, landing on: \"We\u0027re on hiatus. Like on vacation.\"\\n\\n \"What? That\u0027s code for she dumped your ass?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I start patiently. \"It means every... relationship has its, like, um-oh yeah-ups and downs.\"\\n\\n \"I take it this is a down?\"\\n\\n \"You could say so.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re welcome,\" I say glumly.\\n\\n \"I heard she had a run-in with heroin,\" Jamie says lightly.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t confirm that rumor,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Because it isn\u0027t true?\" Jamie pulls out a pack of cigarettes.\\n\\n \"Hey baby-\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" she says patiently. \"You can smoke in restaurants in London.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m hey-babying about.\"\\n\\n \"So just give me the lowdown. Chloe\u0027s not dead: have I got that much right?\" she asks.\\n\\n \"No, she\u0027s not dead, Jamie,\" I say, mildly pissed off.\\n\\n \"Well, rumor has it, Victor...,\" Jamie says, shaking her head faux-sadly, lighting the cigarette.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t give a shit about what gossip you\u0027ve heard.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, stop right there, please.\" Jamie sits back, exhaling smoke, arms crossed, marveling at me. \"Is this the same Victor Johnson I knew way back when, or have you suddenly got your act together?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just saying Chloe-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t really want to hear about your relationship with Chloe Byrnes.\" She cuts me off irritably, nodding at a waiter to remove a bowl. \"I can just imagine. Weekends in South Beach, lunches with An8ie MacDowell, discussions revolving around \u0027Will Chloe get into fashion heaven or not,\u0027 debating the color yellow, you keep finding syringes in Chloe\u0027s Prada handbag-\"\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I snap. \"It was a nasal habit.\"\\n\\n \"Ooh.\" Jamie\u0027s eyes light up. \"Is that on the record?\"\\n\\n \"Oh shit, I don\u0027t give a crap what people think,\" I mutter, pushing myself away from the table. \"Like I really care what people think, Jamie.\"\\n\\n A pause. \"I think you\u0027re adapting well,\" she says, smiling.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m a genius, baby.\"\\n\\n \"So why is the genius in London and not back in New York?\" Jamie asks herself. \"Let me guess: he\u0027s doing research on that screenplay he always wanted to write.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, I\u0027m a genius, baby,\" I tell her. \"I know you might find that hard to believe, but there it is.\"\\n\\n \"How snazzy,\" she says, then fatigue overtakes her and she whimpers, \"Oh no, I\u0027m having flashbacks-the eighties are coming back to me and an anxiety attack is imminent.\" She holds herself, shivering.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a good thing, baby,\" I say, urging, \"Float into it.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-123.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
