Pinch me?\" \"Cool cool cool.\" I nod. \"JD, you know what to do.\" \"After tonight no one should get in for free. Oh yeah-except very good-looking lesbians. Anyone dressed like Garth Brooks is purged. We want a clientele that will up the class quotient.\" \"Up the class quotient. Yeah, yeah.\" Suddenly I cannot tear my eyes off Damien\u0027s head. \"Ground Control to Major Tom,\" Damien says, snapping his fingers. \"Huh?\" \"What in the f**k are you looking at?\" I hear him ask. \"Nothing. Go ahead.\" \"What are you looking at?\" \"Nothing. Just spacing. Go ahead.\" After a brief, scary pause Damien continues icily. \"If I see anyone and I mean anyone unhip wandering around this party tonight I will kill you.\" \"My mouth suddenly is so dry I can\u0027t even like gulp, man.\" Damien starts laughing and joking around, so I try to laugh and joke around too. \"Listen, bud,\" he says. \"I just don\u0027t want the city\u0027s most bizarre bohemians or anyone who uses the term `fagulous\u0027 near me or my friends.\" \"Could you write that down, JD?\" I ask. \"No one who uses the term `fagulous.\u0027\" JD nods, makes a note. \"And what\u0027s with the f**king DJ situation?\" Damien asks disinterestedly. \"Alison tells me someone named Misha\u0027s missing?\" \"Damien, we\u0027re checking all the hotels in South Beach, Prague, Seattle,\" I tell him. \"We\u0027re checking every rehab clinic in the Northeast.\" \"It\u0027s a little late, hmm?\" Damien asks. \"It\u0027s a little late for Misha, hmm?\" \"Victor and I will be interviewing available DJs all day,\" JD assures him. \"We\u0027ve got calls in to everyone from Anita Sarko to Sister Bliss to Smokin Jo. It\u0027s happening.\" \"It\u0027s also almost eight o\u0027clock, dudes,\" Damien says. \"The worst thing in the world, guys, is a shitty DJ. I\u0027d rather be dead than hire a shitty DJ.\" \"Man, I am so with you it\u0027s unbelievable,\" I tell him. \"We have a hundred backups, so it\u0027s happening.\" I\u0027m sweating for some reason, dreading the rest of this breakfast. \"Damien, where can we find you if we need to get ahold of you today?\" \"I\u0027m in the Presidential Suite at the Mark while they finish doing something to my apartment. Whatever.\" He shrugs, chews some muesli. \"You still living downtown?\" \"Yeah, yeah.\" \"When are you gonna move uptown with everyone else-hey, leave the foot-shaking outside,\" he says, staring at a black lace-up from Agnes b. my foot happens to be in. \"Are you okay?\" \"Fine. Damien, we\u0027ve got-\" \"What is it?\" He stops chewing and is now carefully studying me. \"I was just gonna ask-\" I breathe in. \"What are you hiding, Victor?\" \"Nothing, man.\" \"Let me guess. You\u0027re secretly applying to Harvard?\" Damien laughs, looking around the room, encouraging everyone else to laugh with him. \"Yeah, right.\" I laugh too. \"I just keep hearing these vague rumors, man, that you\u0027re f**king my girlfriend, but there\u0027s like no proof.\" Damien keeps laughing. \"So, you know, I\u0027m concerned.\" The goons are not laughing. JD keeps studying his clipboard. I\u0027m inadvertently doing Kegels. \"Oh man, that\u0027s so not true. I wouldn\u0027t touch her, I swear to God.\" \"Yeah.\" You can see him thinking...\" You can see him thinking things out. \"You\u0027ve got Chloe Byrnes. Why would you do Alison?\" Damien sighs. \"Chloe f**king Byrnes.\" Pause. \"How do you do it, man?\" \"Do... what?\" \"Hey, Madonna once asked this guy for a date,\" Damien tells the bodyguards, who don\u0027t show it but in fact are impressed. \"I smile sheepishly. \"Well, dude, you dated Tatjana Patitz.\" \"Who?\" \"The girl who got f**ked to death on the table in Rising Sun.\" \"Ri-i-ight. But you\u0027re dating Chloe f**king Byrnes,\" Damien, says, in awe. \"How do you do it, man? What\u0027s your secret?\" \"About... hey, um, I don\u0027t have any secrets.\" \"No, moron.\" Damien tosses a raisin at me. \"Your secret with women.\" \"Um... never compliment them?\" I squeak out.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-23.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
