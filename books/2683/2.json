Nothing, nada. Remember that. I... know... nothing. Never assume I know anything. Nada. Nothing. I know nothing, not a thing. Never-\" \"I get it, I get it,\" JD says wearily, standing up. \"I really can\u0027t see anything, baby,\" Peyton says, still on the floor. JD sighs. \"Even Peyton can\u0027t see them, Victor.\" \"Ask the vampire to take off his f**king sunglasses,\" I snarl. \"Spare me, man.\" \"I will not tolerate being called a vampire, Victor.\" Peyton pouts. \"What? You tolerate being sodomized but not being called Dracula in jest? Am I on the same planet? Let\u0027s move on.\" I wave my arm, gesturing at something invisible. As the entire group follows me downstairs toward the third floor, the chef-Bongo from Venezuela via Vunderbahr, Moonclub, Paddy-O and MasaMasa-lights a cigarette and lowers his sunglasses while trying to keep up with me. \"Victor, we must talk.\" He coughs, waves smoke away. \"Please, my feet are killing me.\" The group stops. \"Uno momento, Bongo,\" I say, noticing the worried glances he\u0027s throwing Kenny Kenny, who\u0027s connected in some weird way to Glorious Foods and has yet to be informed he has nothing to do with catering tomorrow night\u0027s dinner. Peyton, JD, Bongo, Kenny Kenny, camcorder guy and Details girl wait for me to do something, and since I\u0027m at a loss I peer over the third-floor railing. \"Come on, guys. Shit, I mean I\u0027ve got three more floors and five more bars to check. Please, give me some space. This is all very hard. Those specks almost made me literally sick.\" \"Victor, no one would deny the existence of the specks,\" Peyton says carefully. \"But you have to place the specks within a, um, certain, well, context.\" On one of the monitors lining the walls on the third floor, MTV, a commercial, Helena Christensen, \"Rock the Vote.\" \"Beau!\" I yell up. \"Beau? Beau leans over the top railing. \"Chloe says she\u0027ll be at Metro CC at eleven-thirty.\" \"Wait, Beau-Ingrid Chavez? Has Ingrid Chavez RSVP\u0027d?\" I yell up. \"I\u0027m checking-wait, for the dinner?\" \"Yes, and I\u0027m gritting my teeth, Beau. Check the Cs for dinner.\" \"Oh my god I have got to speak to you, Victor,\" Bongo says in an accent so thick I\u0027m unsure of its origin, grabbing my arm. \"You must let me have my time with you.\" \"Bongo, why don\u0027t you just get get the the hell out of here,\" Kenny Kenny says, his face twisted. \"Here, Victor, try a crouton.\" I snatch one out of his hands. \"Mmm, rosemary. Delish, dude.\" \"It is sage, Victor. Sage.\" \"You you sh-sh-should go to hell,\" Bongo sputters. \"And take that sickening crouton with you.\" \"Will both of you mos take a Xanax and shut the f**k up? Go bake some pastries or something. Beau-goddamnit! Speak to me!\" \"Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen, Cindy Crawford, Sheryl Crow, David Charvet, Courteney Cox, Harry Connick, Jr., Francisco Clemente, Nick Constantine, Zoe Cassavetes, Nicolas Cage, Thomas Calabro, Cristi Conway, Bob Collacello, Whitfield Crane, John Cusack, Dean Cain, Jim Courier, Roger Clemens, Russell Crowe, Tia Carrere and Helena Bonham Carter-but I\u0027m not sure if she should be under B or C.\" \"Ingrid Chavez! Ingrid Chavez!\" I shout up. \"Has Ingrid Chavez f**king RSVP\u0027d or not?\" \"Victor, celebs and their overly attentive PR reps are complaining that your answering machine isn\u0027t working,\" Beau calls down. \"They say it\u0027s playing thirty seconds of `Love Shack\u0027 and then only five seconds to leave a message.\" \"It\u0027s a simple question. Yes or No is the answer. What else could these people possibly have to say to me? It\u0027s not a difficult question: Are you coming to the dinner and the club opening or are you not? Is that hard to grasp? And you look just like Uma Thurman, baby.\" \"Victor, Cindy is not `these people,\u0027 Veronica Webb is not `these people,\u0027 Elaine Irwin is not `these people\u0027-\" \"Beau! How are the As shaping up? Kenny Kenny, don\u0027t pinch Bongo like that.\" \"All nine of them?\" Beau calls down. \"Carol Alt, Pedro Almodovar, Dana Ashbrook, Kevyn Aucoin, Patricia, Rosanna, David and Alexis Arquette and Andre Agassi, but no Giorgio Armani or Pamela Anderson.\" \"Shit.\" I light another cigarette, then look over at the Details girl. \"Um, I mean that in a good way.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-2.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
