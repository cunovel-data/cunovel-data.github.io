We immediately light cigarettes. On this floor twenty tables have been set up for the dinner and really handsome busboys are lighting candles. On all the TV monitors: fashionable static.\n \"What in the f**k?\" Damien inhales deeply on the cigarette.\n \"They\u0027re just, um, lighting the candles for dinner,\" I say, gesturing innocently at the busboys.\n Damien smacks me lightly on the side of the head.\n \"Why in the f**k is Chloe\u0027s dress exactly like Alison\u0027s?\"\n \"Damien, I know they look alike but in actuality-\"\n He pushes me toward the railing and points down. \"What are you telling me, Victor?\"\n \"It\u0027s a-it\u0027s supposedly a, um, very popular dress this... y\u0027know...\" I trail off.\n Damien waits, wide-eyed. \"Yes?\"\n \"... season?\" I squeak out.\n Damien runs a hand over his face and stares over the railing to make sure Alison and Chloe haven\u0027t seen each other yet, but Alison\u0027s flirting with Baxter and Chloe\u0027s answering questions about how high the fabulous factor is tonight while a line of TV crews jostle for the perfect angle and Damien\u0027s muttering \"Why isn\u0027t she wearing that hat you picked up?\" and I\u0027m making excuses (\"Oribe said it was a no-no\") and he keeps asking \"Why isn\u0027t she wearing the goddamn hat you picked up?\" and Lauren\u0027s talking to f**king Chris O\u0027Donnell and Damien guzzles down a large glass of Scotch then sets it on the railing with a shaky hand and I\u0027m kind of like infused with panic and so tired.\n \"Damien, let\u0027s just try to have a cool-\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I care anymore about that,\" he says.\n \"About what? About having a cool time?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Don\u0027t say that.\" And then after a long patch of silence: \"I really don\u0027t know how to respond to that.\" And then after a longer patch of silence: \"You look really great tonight.\"\n \"About her,\" he says. \"About Alison. I don\u0027t think I care about that.\"\n I\u0027m staring out over the crowd, my eyes involuntarily refocusing on the expressions Lauren\u0027s making while Chris O\u0027Donnell chats her up, swigging from a bottle of Grolsch, Lauren seductively playing with the damp label, models everywhere. \"Why... did you ever?\" I hear myself ask, thinking, At least the press will be good.\n Damien turns to me and I look away but meet his gaze when he says, \"Whose money do you think this all is?\"\n \"Pardon?\" I ask, leaning away, my neck and forehead soaked with sweat.\n \"Who do you think is bankrolling all of this?\" he sighs.\n A long pause. \"Various... orthodontists... from, um, Brentwood?\" I ask, squinting, wiping my forehead. \"Um, you. Aren\u0027t you like responsible for all of, um, this?\"\n \"It\u0027s hers,\" he shouts. \"It\u0027s all Alison\u0027s.\"\n \"But...\" I stop, swaying.\n Damien waits, looking at me.\n \"But... I don\u0027t know how to respond to... that.\"\n \"Haven\u0027t you been paying attention?\" he snaps.\n We\u0027ll slide down the surface of things...\n \"They found Mica,\" Damien\u0027s saying.\n \"Who?\" I ask numbly, staring off.\n \"The police, Victor,\" he says. \"They found Mica.\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s a little too late,\" I\u0027m saying, trying to recover. \"Right? Do not pass Go? Do not collect two million bucks, right? Junior\u0027s doing a great job and personally I always felt Mica was sort of-\"\n \"Victor, she\u0027s dead,\" Damien says tiredly. \"She was found in a Dumpster in Hell\u0027s Kitchen. She was beaten with a hammer and... Jesus Christ\"-he breathes in, waves down into the crowd at Elizabeth Berkley and Craig Bierko, then brings his hand to his mouth-\"eviscerated.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-75.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
