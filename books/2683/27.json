We\u0027re not playing games here,\" JD asks, \"are we?\"\n \"No,\" I say. \"We\u0027re going to the gym.\"\n 25\n At a gym in the Flatiron District, in what last week became the most fashionable stretch of lower Fifth Avenue, my trainer, Reed, is being filmed for a segment of Entertainment Tonight about trainers for celebrities who are more famous than the celebrities they train, and in the gym now-which has no name, just a symbol and below that the motto \u0027Weakness Is a Crime, Don\u0027t Be a Criminal\u0027-beneath the row of video monitors showing episodes of The Flintstones and the low lighting from a crystal chandelier Matt Dillon, Toni Braxton, the sultan of Brunei\u0027s wife, Tim Jeffries, Ralph Fiennes - all in agony. A couple of male models, Craig Palmer and Scott Benoit, pissed off over something I said about Matt Nye\u0027s luck, semi-avoid me as they towel off in the Philippe Starck-designed changing room. Danny Errico from Equinox set the place up for Reed when the issue of Playgirl Reed appeared in sold something like ten million copies and he subsequently was dropped from the Gap\u0027s new ad campaign. Now Reed\u0027s costarring in a movie about a detective whose new partner is a pair of gibbons. Reed: $175 an hour and worth every goddamn penny (I stressed to Chloe), long blond hair never in a ponytail, light \u0027n\u0027 sexy stubble, naturally tan, silver stud in right ear, designer weight-belt, a body with muscles so well defined he looks skinned, license plate on his black BMW reads VARMINT, all the prerequisites. It\u0027s so freezing in the gym that steam rises from the lights the \"ET\" camera has set up.\n The Details reporter arrives late. \"Sorry, I got lost,\" she says vacantly, wearing a black cashmere sweater, white cotton shirt, white silk pants and, in true girl-reporter-from-Details fashion, tube-sock elbow pads and a bicycle-reflector armband. \"I had to interview President Omar Bongo of Gabon and his cute nephew, um...\" She checks her notepad. \"Spencer.\"\n \"Ladies and gentlemen.\" Reed spreads his hands out, introducing me. \"Victor Ward, the It Boy of the moment.\"\n Mumbled \"hey\"s and a few \"yeah\"s come from the crew, who remain darkened behind the steaming lights set up in front of the StairMaster, and finally someone tiredly says, \"We\u0027re rolling.\"\n \"Take those sunglasses off,\" Reed whispers to me.\n \"Not with those lights on, uh-uhn, spare me.\"\n \"I smell Marlboros,\" Reed says, pushing me toward the StairMaster. \"You shouldn\u0027t smoke, baby, it takes years off your life.\"\n \"Yeah, my sixties, great. Don\u0027t wanna miss those.\"\n \"Ooh, you\u0027re tough. Come on-hop up here,\" Reed says, patting the side of the machine.\n \"I want calves and thighs and definitely abs today,\" I stress. \"But no biceps,\" I warn. \"They\u0027re getting too big.\"\n \"What? They\u0027re thirteen inches, baby.\" Reed sets the StairMaster to Blind Random, level 10.\n \"Isn\u0027t your T-shirt, uh, a little tight?\" I ask, taunting.\n \"Arms are the new br**sts,\" Reed intones.\n \"Oh, and look,\" I say, noticing a tiny blackhead. \"You have a nipple.\"\n \"Cut,\" the segment director sighs.\n \"Victor,\" Reed warns. \"Pretty soon I\u0027m gonna bring up that bounced check of yours-\"\n \"Hey, Chloe took care of the bill.\"\n \"This is a business, baby,\" Reed says, trying to smile. \"Not a charity.\"\n \"Listen, if you need more work, I need bouncers.\"\n \"This is work, man.\"\n \"What? Being familiar with fitness equipment? Spare me.\"\n \"I already supplement my income, Victor.\"\n \"Listen, as long as the sex is safe I personally think being a male whore is cool-if it pays the bills.\"\n Reed smacks me upside the head and growls, \"We\u0027re doing squats today.\"\n \"And abs,\" I stress. \"I have a photo shoot, baby.\"\n \"Okay,\" the director calls out. \"We\u0027re running.\"\n Automatically, without trying, Reed starts clapping his hands and shouts, \"I want some strain, some pressure, some sweat, Victor. You\u0027re too tense, buddy. Out with that tension. In with some love.\"\n \"I\u0027ve sworn off caffeine, Reed. I\u0027m teaching myself how to relax by deep-sea visualization. I\u0027m avoiding the urge to check my voice mail on a half-hourly basis. I\u0027m hugging people left and right. And look.\" I reach under my CK T-shirt. \"My new tranquillity beads.\"\n \"Far out, baby,\" Reed wails, clapping his hands together. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-27.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
