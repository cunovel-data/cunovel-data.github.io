I stub out a half-smoked cigarette, cursing, and before I can finish the rest of the second martini the director takes it \"gently but firmly\" away, suggesting I\u0027ve had \"enough,\" that perhaps I should \"Pace\" myself, that maybe this will \"aid my performance.\" I grab the martini back from the director, finish it and, smacking my lips together, say loudly, \"I-don\u0027t-think-so.\" I toss the Gold VIP Caya prop at him and mutter, \"Sign for it, doofus.\"\n 8\n The Queen\u0027s Grill is jammed but the Wallaces are at a table for four up front by the entrance. As I make my way down the steps leading to the table, Stephen stands up, dressed in a tuxedo, waving me over as if this were some sort of grand occasion, Lorrie sitting primly next to him wearing the same strapless Armani gown from last night. There are huge flower arrangements everywhere in the Queen\u0027s Grill to navigate around and dozens of waiters carrying trays of champagne glasses brush past me. I gently bump into a maitre d\u0027 at the table next to ours as he prepares crepes for a group of Japanese women, who smile admiringly at the handsome young gall\u0027in as he shakes Stephen Wallace\u0027s beefy hand.\n \"Ah, Victor-hello,\" Stephen says as a waiter pulls a chair out for me. \"Where\u0027s your guest?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure, man,\" I say, about to lift my wrist to check my nonexistent watch. \"She said she\u0027d meet me in the lounge for a drink and never showed.\" I pause glumly. \"She knows where we\u0027re eating, but man, I\u0027m bummed.\"\n \"Well, we do hope she comes,\" Stephen says. \"in the meantime-champagne?\"\n Definitely,\" I say, reaching for a glass.\n \"That\u0027s, um, mine,\" Lorrie says tentatively.\n \"Oops, sorry,\" I say as a waiter pours from a bottle of Dom Perignon into a flute sitting by my napkin.\n \"So Victor, what is it you\u0027ve been doing?\" Stephen asks.\n \"You know, Stephen old chum,\" I start vaguely, pondering this while chugging down the bubbly, \"I\u0027m really not quite sure what I\u0027ve been doing.\"\n Dismayed, they both laugh.\n \"What do you two do?\" I finally ask, catching my breath.\n \"Well, I work in an advertising agency in London-\" Stephen starts.\n \"Oh really? That\u0027s nice,\" I interrupt. \"But I actually meant on this boat, but whatever. Continue. Can I get another glass of champagne?\"\n \"I open restaurants,\" Lorrie offers, a little too greedily, while a waiter fills my empty flute. \"We were just in Manhattan scouting locations in TriBeCa. It would be my first in the States.\"\n \"Oh really?\" I say again, groaning inwardly. \"That\u0027s super. What kind of restaurants?\" I finish the new glass of champagne and point to the flute again after the waiter finishes topping off Stephen\u0027s and Lorrie\u0027s glasses. Hesitantly, he fills mine again. Stephen then nods at the waiter, a gesture to bring another bottle.\n \"The last one I opened was in Holland Park,\" Lorrie says. \"Which I would love to have you visit when you\u0027re in London.\"\n \"But see, I\u0027m not-going-to-be-in-London, baby,\" I say, straining, leaning toward Lorrie for emphasis, but when I realize how rude that sounds, I add, \"Though that\u0027s a very, um, cool offer.\"\n \"Lorrie\u0027s a splendid cook,\" Stephen adds.\n \"Oh really?\" I say again, grinding my heels into the floor. \"What\u0027s your specialty, babe?\"\n \"It\u0027s a variation on classic Californian cuisine, you might say.\" Lorrie tilts her head thoughtfully.\n When it becomes apparent that I\u0027m supposed to say something, I ask, staring, \"You mean compared to just... Califomian cuisine?\" and then, measuring each word carefully, totally not interested in an answer, \"or... post-Californian cuisine?\"\n \"There\u0027s definitely a Pacific Rim influence as well,\" Stephen adds. \"I mean, we know it sounds awfully trendy, but there is a world of difference.\"\n Stuck, I ask, \"Between?\"\n \"Between... Californian cuisine and, well, post-Californian cuisine,\" Stephen says, a little too patiently.\n \"And Pacific Rim as well,\" Lorrie adds.\n There\u0027s a long pause.\n \"Does anybody have the time?\" I ask.\n Stephen checks his watch. \"Eight-forty.\"\n There\u0027s another long pause.\n \"So it\u0027s like the whole baby-vegetable-guava-pasta-blue-corn-scallops-in-wasabi-fajitas situation, huh?\" I ask, glazing over. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-107.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
