The usual.\" \"How is Elsa?\" she asks, still glaring. \"Elsa and I are both Capricorns so we get along very nicely,\" I say. \"Is it cold in here or is it just me?\" \"And otherwise?\" she asks, waiting. \"It was, er, very, very-oh yeah-important\" \"Important?\" Lauren asks semi-dubiously. \"Clothes are important, baby.\" \"They eventually clean furniture, Victor.\" \"Hey,\" I exclaim. \"Lighten up, baby.\" \"Victor, you\u0027ve got to get out of here.\" \"What were you doing?\" I ask, moving around the room, taking the whole apartment in. \"Why weren\u0027t you at the show?\" \"I had a photo shoot promoting a terrible movie I\u0027m in with Ben Chaplin and Rufus Sewell,\" she hisses, barely able to contain herself. \"Then I took a bubble bath and read an article on the impossibility of real emotion on the Upper East Side in New York magazine.\" She stubs out the cigarette. \"This was a draining conversation, yet one I\u0027m glad we had. The door\u0027s over there in case you\u0027ve forgotten.\" She walks past me, down a hallway covered with a Berber-style woven carpet and Moroccan embroidered pillows stacked against the walls and then I\u0027m in her bedroom, where I flop on the bed, leaning back on my elbows, my feet barely touching the floor, watching as Lauren stalks into the bathroom and begins toweling her hair dry. Behind her a poster for some indie film starring Steve Buscemi hangs above the toilet. She\u0027s so annoyed-but maybe in a fake way-that I have to say, \"Oh come off it, I\u0027m not so bad. I bet you hang out with guys who say things like \u0027But what if I want a new Maserati\u0027 all the time. I bet your life is filled with that.\" I stop, then add, \"Too.\" She picks up a half-empty glass of champagne by the sink, downs it. \"Hey,\" I say, pointing at the framed poster. \"You were in that movie?\" \"Unfortunately,\" she mutters. \"Notice where it\u0027s hanging?\" She closes her eyes, touches her forehead. \"You just finished a new movie?\" I ask softly. \"Yes.\" Suddenly she searches through an array of Estee Lauder jars, Lancome products, picks up a L\u0027Occitane butter massage balm that Chloe also uses, reads the ingredients, puts it down, finally gives up and just looks at herself in the mirror. \"What\u0027s it about?\" I ask as if it matters. \"It\u0027s kind of like Footloose,\" she says, then pauses and delicately whispers, \"But set on Mars.\" She waits for my reaction. I just stare at her from the bed. A longish silence. \"That\u0027s so cool, baby.\" \"I wept on the set every day.\" \"Did you just break up with someone?\" \"You-are-a-dunce.\" \"I\u0027m waiting to see if I\u0027m getting a role in Flatliners II,\" I mention casually, stretching. \"So we\u0027re in the same boat?\" she asks. \"Is that it?\" \"Alison Poole told me you were doing pretty well.\" She swigs from a nearby bottle of Evian. \"Let\u0027s just say it\u0027s been lucratively tedious.\" \"Baby, I\u0027m sensing that you\u0027re a star.\" \"Have you seen any of my movies?\" Pause. \"Alison Poole told me you were doing-\" \"Don\u0027t mention that cunt\u0027s name in this apartment,\" she screams, throwing a brush at me. \"Hey baby,\" I say, ducking. \"Come here, baby, chill out.\" \"What?\" she asks, irritably. \"Come where?\" \"Come here,\" I murmur, staring straight at her. \"Come here,\" I say, patting the comforter. She just stares at me lying on the bed, my shirt pulled up a little, showing off my lower abs, my legs slightly spread. Sometime during all of this my jacket came off. \"Victor?\" \"Yeah?\" I whisper. \"What does Chloe mean to you?\" \"Come here,\" I whisper. \"Just because you\u0027re a gorgeous guy doesn\u0027t give you any more rights than...,\" she falters, picks up: \"... anyone else.\" \"I know, baby. It\u0027s cool.\" I sit up, gazing at her, never breaking eye contact. She moves toward me. \"Come on,\" I say. \"That\u0027s it.\" \"What do you want, Victor?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-63.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
