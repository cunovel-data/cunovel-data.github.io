She pauses, reflects on something and sits up a little, sips her punch too, lets me leave a hand not holding my cigarette on her thigh. \"Rumor has it you fled the States, baby,\" I\u0027m saying. \"Why?\" \"Rumor?\" she asks, knocking my hand away by crossing her legs. \"Who told you that?\" Pause. \"There are rumors about me?\" \"Hey baby, you\u0027re a star.\" I\u0027m shrugging. \"You\u0027re in the press.\" \"You didn\u0027t even know I lived in New York, Victor,\" she says, frowning. \"Jesus-what are you talking about? What press?\" \"So... you did not flee the States?\" I ask tentatively. \"So-o-o you\u0027re not, like, hiding out here?\" \"Flee the States? Hiding out here?\" she asks. \"For f**k\u0027s sake, Victor -get your shit together. Does it look like I\u0027m hiding out?\" \"Well, um, baby, I heard things-\" \"I came here to make a lousy sci-fi movie,\" she says. \"Who were you talking to? Who told you this garbage?\" \"Hey baby, I heard things.\" I shrug. \"I heard something about boyfriend troubles. I\u0027m very well connected, you know.\" She just stares at me and then, after the appropriate amount of time passes, shakes her head and mutters, \"Oh my god.\" \"So when are you coming back?\" I\u0027m asking. \"To where?\" she asks. \"To where you\u0027re going? I don\u0027t think so.\" \"To the States, baby-\" \"The States? Who in the f**k calls it the States?\" \"Yeah, the States, baby.\" I\u0027m shrugging. \"You wanna join me?\" A long pause that\u0027s followed by \"Why are you so concerned whether I come back or not?\" \"I\u0027m not, baby, I\u0027m not,\" I say, paying attention to her again, moving closer again. \"I just want to know when and if you\u0027re leaving and if, uh, you need a lift.\" \"I don\u0027t know, Victor,\" she says, not moving away. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing. In fact I don\u0027t even know what I\u0027m doing at this party with you.\" \"Hey, I don\u0027t believe that,\" I say. \"Come on, baby.\" \"Why don\u0027t you believe that?\" \"Because of the way you said it.\" I shrug, but this time I\u0027m staring at her intently. She studies me too, then shudders. \"I have a terrible feeling you\u0027re gonna end up on a late-night talk show in a pink tuxedo in about three years. \"Hey,\" I whisper huskily, \"I\u0027m built to last, baby.\" It\u0027s the cue for a kiss. \"Baby-come to where the flavor is.\" The lights flicker, then dim, the chorus to U2\u0027s \"Staring at the Sun\" bursts out and she tilts her neck so her mouth is more easily available to mine, confetti starts drifting down around us, and Raquel Welch in One Million Years B.C. suddenly starts running around, projected on an entire wall above our heads, and as our lips touch there\u0027s an insistency on her part that I\u0027m reacting to but Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and the hat designer Philip Treacey stop by and that\u0027s when Jamie and I disengage and as we\u0027re all chatting Jamie asks Tara where the closest rest room is and as they all leave together Jamie winks at me and I not only experience a Camden flashback but also realize that I\u0027m going to get laid and make $300,000. Note to self: why bother modeling anymore? New plan: remember all the girls I dated who might need locating. I start mentally composing a list, wondering if Palakon would be even mildly interested. I\u0027m staring at a group of Japanese guys hunched over a small TV set smoking cigars and drinking bourbon while watching a tape of \"Friends\" and after one of them notices me he can\u0027t stop staring and, flattered, I pretend not to notice and, unsure of whether Jamie took the vial of cocaine with her, I start rifling through the Mark Cross suede tote bag she\u0027s carrying in this scene as the Smashing Pumpkins\u0027 \"1979\" starts playing at an earsplitting level, people crying out in protest until it\u0027s turned down and replaced by the melodic trip-hop at low volume.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-127.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
