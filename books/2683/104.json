Hello?\" \"Victor,\" they both cry out in unison, just yards away. \"Over here!\" I start limping as if in pain. \"Jovially,\" I hold out a hand, but then I gasp, grimacing and reaching down to massage my ankle. \"Victor, we wondered where you were for dinner,\" Lorrie says. \"Are you all right?\" \"Yes, you were sorely missed,\" Stephen adds. \"Is something wrong with your leg?\" \"Well, I fell asleep,\" I start. \"I was also, um, expecting a... phone call, but I... fell asleep.\" Pause. \"Did you get your call?\" Lorrie asks semi-worriedly. \"Oh yes,\" I say. \"So now everything\u0027s fine.\" \"But what happened to your leg?\" \"Well, when I was reaching over for the phone... it, well, I accidentally fell off the chair I\u0027d been sitting, er, sleeping in and then, well, while reaching for the phone... it actually fell and struck my\"-a really long pause-\"knee.\" Another really long pause. No one says anything. \"So then I tried to stand up-all this while speaking into the phone -and then I actually tripped over the chair... by the TV...\" I stop to let them interrupt. Finally Stephen says, \"That must have been quite a scene.\" Picturing how ridiculous this scenario seems, I delicately reexplain: \"Actually I handled it all quite suavely.\" Lorrie and Stephen both nod, assuring me they\u0027re certain that I did. The following is just basic exposition-these lines fall easily and rapidly into place-because I can see, in the distance, Marina, her back to me, standing at the railing, gazing out over the black ocean. \"Tomorrow night, Victor?\" Lorrie suggests, shivering. \"Please, Victor,\" Stephen demands. \"I insist you have dinner with us tomorrow night.\" \"Jeez, you guys are persistent. Okay, okay, tomorrow night,\" I say, staring at Marina. \"Oh wait-I\u0027m having dinner with someone else tomorrow night. How about next week?\" \"But we\u0027ll be off the boat next week.\" \"We will? Thank god.\" \"Please, bring your guest,\" Lorrie says. \"It\u0027s okay if I bring someone?\" I ask. \"Oh good-a quartet,\" Stephen says, rubbing his paws together. \"Actually she\u0027s an American.\" \"Pardon?\" Stephen leans in, smiling. \"She\u0027s an American.\" \"Why... yes, of course she is,\" Stephen says, confused. Lorrie tries not to stare incredulously at me and falls. \"And please,\" Stephen adds, \"when you\u0027re in London you must stop by as well.\" \"But I\u0027m definitely going to Paris,\" I murmur, staring off at the girl by the railing. \"I\u0027m definitely not going to England.\" The Wallaces take this in stride, seem finally to accept this info, and exit by saying \"Tomorrow night, then,\" like it\u0027s some kind of big deal they conjured up. But they seem sated and don\u0027t linger and I\u0027m not even bothering to limp away from them. Instead I glide slowly over the deck to where Marina\u0027s standing, wearing white slacks and a white cashmere sweater, and because of how these clothes fit on her she\u0027s semi-virginal, semi-naughty, and my steps become more timid and I almost slink back, stunned by how beautiful she looks right now and she\u0027s eating an ice cream cone and it\u0027s pink and white and the decks are generally well-lit but Marina\u0027s standing in a darkened spot, a place where it seems vaguely windier. Tapping her shoulder, I offer an inquiring look. \"Where did you get that?\" I ask, pointing at the ice cream cone. \"Oh, hi,\" she says, glancing casually at me. \"A nice elderly man-I believe his name was Mr. Yoshomoto-made it for me, though I don\u0027t think I asked him to.\" \"Ah.\" I nod and then gesture. \"What are you looking at out there?\" \"Oh, I know,\" she says. \"It\u0027s all black.\" \"And it\u0027s cold,\" I say, mock-shivering. \"It\u0027s not so bad,\" she says. \"I\u0027ve been colder.\" \"I tried to find you earlier but I forgot your last name.\" \"Really?\" she asks. \"Why did you want to find me?\" \"There was a jig-dancing contest I wanted us to enter,\" I say. \"Hornpipes, the works.\" \"It\u0027s Gibson,\" she says, smiling. \"Let\u0027s reintroduce ourselves,\" I suggest, backing away. \"Hi-I\u0027m Victor Ward.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-104.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
