{"id":69322,"no":135,"title":"Page 135","content":"\"So who lives here?\" I ask as Bobby pads back into the room. \"I mean, I know it\u0027s a set, but it\u0027s pretty nice.\"\\n\\n \"Well, sometimes I rent it from someone,\" he says as he heads toward the computer and studies the screen. \"And right now I\u0027m sharing it with Tammy and Bruce, who I think you\u0027ve met.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, they\u0027re cool.\"\\n\\n \"And Bentley Harrolds, who\u0027s an old friend of mine, and Jamie Fields, whom\"-a pause, without looking up at me-\"I take it you know from college.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah.\" I\u0027m nodding. \"Right. She\u0027s cool too.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Bobby says wearily, flicking off the screen, sighing. \"We\u0027re all pretty damn cool.\"\\n\\n I consider going somewhere, debate, then decide to press ahead.\\n\\n \"Bobby?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" He\u0027s looking over at me again.\\n\\n \"I just want to, um, let you know that- this is going to sound really corny-but you were\"-I take a deep breath-\"a really, like, a really, like an inspiration to a lot of us and you were like a major influence and I just want to let you know that.\" I pause, look away, distressed, my eyes watering. \"Did I just sound totally weird?\"\\n\\n Silence, then, \"No. No, you didn\u0027t, Victor.\" He\u0027s staring at me warmly. \"It\u0027s good. I like it. Thank you.\"\\n\\n Relief washes over me, my throat tightens, and with difficulty, my voice totally strained, I manage, \"No problem, man.\"\\n\\n Voices outside in the yard. A gate opens, then closes. Four gorgeous people dressed in black, wearing sunglasses and carrying chic grocery bags, move through the darkening garden and toward the house. Bobby and I watch them from behind the glass doors.\\n\\n \"Ah, the troops return,\" Bobby says.\\n\\n I wave at Jamie as the group walks toward the expanse of window I\u0027m standing behind, but no one waves back. Bentley scowls, flicking away a cigarette. Bruce, holding two bags piled high with groceries, playfully nudges Tammy off the stone path. Jamie strides forward, staring straight ahead impassively, chewing gum.\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t they see me?\" I\u0027m asking.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one-way glass,\" Bobby says.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I say. \"That\u0027s... cool.\"\\n\\n Chapter Thirteen\\n\\n The four of them stagger through a back entrance and into the kitchen, a series of small electronic beeps sounding as someone closes the door. Turning, Bobby and I watch as they drop grocery bags on a large steel counter. We move closer, hitting our marks. Jamie is the first to see us and she whips off her sunglasses, smiling.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re awake,\" Jamie says, walking toward us.\\n\\n I smile at her and as she heads toward me I start expecting a kiss and I close my eyes, bouncing lightly up and down on the soles of my feet. A small rush of lust starts gaining momentum and then gets out of control, shoots out all over the place. But Jamie passes by and I open my eyes and turn around.\\n\\n She and Bobby are embracing and he\u0027s kissing her hungrily, making noises. It takes too long for Jamie to notice me standing there staring, and as she pulls back a little Bobby hangs on and won\u0027t let go.\\n\\n \"You guys meet?\" is all Jamie can ask after taking in the expression on my face.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" I nod.\\n\\n \"Hey, let go,\" Jamie squeals, pushing Bobby off her. \"Let go, let go.\"\\n\\n But Bobby doesn\u0027t-he just keeps leaning in, kissing her face, her neck. I just stand there watching, hot, suddenly clearheaded.\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s cocktail hour,\" Bentley says, pouting.\\n\\n Tammy walks by where I\u0027m standing. \"We ran into Buffy. She just got back from climbing Everest. There were two deaths. She lost her cell phone.\"\\n\\n I have no idea who this is directed at, so I just slowly nod my head.\\n\\n \"Hey, I\u0027m ravenous,\" Bobby says, still holding Jamie in his arms, but she\u0027s not struggling anymore. \"When are we eating?\" he calls out. \"What are we eating?\" Then he whispers something into Jamie\u0027s ear and she giggles and then slaps his arms, grabbing at them with both hands where his biceps bulge.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m making bruschetta,\" Bruce calls out from the kitchen. \"Porcini risotto, prosciutto and figs, arugula and fennel salad.\"\\n\\n \"Hurry,\" Bobby bellows, nuzzling Jamie\u0027s face, squeezing her tighter. \"Hurry, Bruce. I\u0027m starving.\"\\n\\n \"Victor, what are you wearing under that robe?\" Bentley asks, staring at me, holding a bottle of Stoll. \"Wait-don\u0027t tell me. I don\u0027t think I can handle it.\" Walking back into the kitchen, he calls out, \"I have your underwear, by the way.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-135.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
