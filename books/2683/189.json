The director starts walking toward us again. My vision keeps blurring over, getting wavy. It starts drizzling.\n \"What are you doing here?\" I ask, trying not to whimper.\n \"I\u0027m picking up a prescription for Tammy,\" she says.\n \"Uh-huh. Because she\u0027s, like, very sick, right?\"\n \"Yeah, she\u0027s very upset,\" Jamie says coolly.\n \"Well, right, because she should be.\"\n I\u0027m wetting my lips, panic coursing through the muscles in my legs, my arms, my face-all tingling. Jamie keeps staring, appraising me. A longer pause. The director is jogging up the street, grimly advancing toward us, toward me.\n \"So let me get this straight,\" Jamie starts.\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"You\u0027re taking French lessons.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"From Christian Bale?\"\n \"No, we\u0027re having an affair,\" I blurt out. \"I didn\u0027t want to bring him to the house.\"\n \"I don\u0027t necessarily find that unbelievable.\"\n \"No, no, it\u0027s French lessons,\" I\u0027m saying. \"Merci beaucoup, bon soir, je comprends, oui, mademoiselle, bonjour, mademoiselle-\"\n \"All right, all right,\" she mutters, giving up.\n The director is getting closer.\n \"Send them away,\" I whisper. \"Please, just send them away, send them the f**k away,\" I say, putting my sunglasses on.\n Jamie sighs and walks over to the director. He\u0027s on a cell phone and he snaps the mouthpiece closed as she approaches. He listens to her, adjusting a red bandanna knotted around his neck. I\u0027m crying silently to myself and as Jamie walks back to me I start shivering. I rub a hand across my forehead, a headache\u0027s building.\n \"Are you okay?\" she asks.\n I try to speak but can\u0027t. I\u0027m only vaguely aware that it\u0027s starting to rain.\n In a cab heading back to the house she asks me, \"So where did you take your French lessons?\"\n I can\u0027t say anything.\n \"How did you and Christian Bale meet?\" she asks.\n The cab lurches forward in traffic, its windows streaked with rain. The air inside the cab is heavy with invisible things. I\u0027m slouching in the back of the cab. My foot has fallen asleep.\n \"What is this?\" she asks. \"Are you doing your big deaf routine?\"\n \"What\u0027s in the bag?\" I ask, nodding at the white shape in Jamie\u0027s lap. \"Tammy\u0027s prescription,\" she says.\n \"For what? Methadone?\"\n \"Halcion.\"\n \"I hope you got her a lot,\" I say, and then, \"Can I have some?\"\n \"No,\" Jamie says. \"What were you really doing with that guy?\"\n I blurt out, \"How did you know Marina Gibson?\"\n \"Oh god,\" she groans. \"Are we back to that?\"\n \"Jamie,\" I warn, then relent. \"Please.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she says irritably. \"I knew her in New York. Modeling. Whatever. Nightlife.\"\n I start giggling. \"You\u0027re lying.\"\n \"Oh shit.\"\n I ask softly, \"Could this have all been prevented?\"\n Finally she answers flatly, \"That\u0027s speculative.\"\n \"Who else is involved with this?\" I ask.\n She sighs. \"It\u0027s all very small.\" Pause. \"The larger the group, the greater the danger of detection. You know.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure that works well on paper.\"\n \"Did you look at the file?\" she asks.\n \"Yes,\" I murmur.\n \"Good,\" she says, relaxing, and then, \"I think Christian Bale\u0027s cool.\" She checks her fingernails. \"In a fairly obvious way.\"\n I turn to look at her. \"What does that mean?\"\n \"Christian Bale wasn\u0027t in Hooked, Victor,\" Jamie says. \"He wasn\u0027t in that movie.\"\n I stall, then move into, \"Maybe he was just being... polite.\"\n \"Don\u0027t bother,\" she mutters.\n And outside the house in the 8th or the 16th patches of sunlight start streaming through the dissolving clouds and Jamie and I open the gate and move together silently through the courtyard. Inside, with Bruce Rhinebeck gone the house seems less heavy, better, emptier, even with the second unit setting up. Bobby sits at the computer while talking on a cell phone, smoking a cigarette, tapping ashes into a Diet Coke can, stacks of spiral notebooks piled high on the desk in front of him, lounge music playing in the background. A pool table has been delivered, another BMW is read y to be picked up, new wallpaper has been ordered, there\u0027s a party somewhere tonight. \"It\u0027s all confirmed,\" Bobby says simply. Inside the house it\u0027s twenty degrees. Inside the house, shit, its fragrance, churns everywhere, muddy and billowing. Inside the house there\u0027s a lot of \"intense activity\" and everything\u0027s quickly being lit. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-189.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
