{"id":69265,"no":78,"title":"Page 78","content":"Alison grabs the vial away from me and says, \"No, that\u0027s, er, something else.\" She hands me the other vial.\n Already wired, I\u0027m not capable of stopping myself from kissing her on the nose, an involuntary reaction to whatever I just snorted.\n \"Oh hot,\" she sneers miserably. \"How hot.\"\n Unable to move my mouth, I gurgle, \"I\u0027m speechless too.\"\n \"That little conversation we had, Victor, upset me very much,\" Alison groans, fixing her hair, wiping her nose with Kleenex. She looks at my innocent face in the mirror, while I stand behind her doing a few more hits. \"Oh please, Victor, don\u0027t do this-do not do this.\"\n \"When?\" I\u0027m shouting out. \"What in the hell-\"\n \"About ninety minutes ago? Stop acting like such an idiot. I know you\u0027re a guy who\u0027s not exactly on the ball, but please-even this could not get past you.\"\n I hand back the vial, wiping my nose, and then say very quietly, hoping to reassure her, \"Baby, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"That\u0027s the problem, Victor,\" she screams. \"You never know.\"\n \"Baby, baby-\"\n \"Shut up, shut up, shut up,\" she screams, whirling away from her reflection. \"You stand in front of me just ninety minutes ago outside my apartment and tell me it\u0027s all over-that you\u0027re in love with Lauren Hynde? That you\u0027re dumping Chloe for her? Remember that, you humongous idiot?\"\n \"Wait a minute,\" I say, holding up my hands, both of which she smacks at. \"You\u0027re really coked up and you need a tranquilizer and you need to get your facts straight-\"\n \"Are you saying this didn\u0027t happen, Victor?\" she shouts, grabbing at me.\n Holding her back, I look intently into her face and offer, \"I\u0027m not saying it didn\u0027t happen, Alison.\" I breathe in. \"I\u0027m just saying that I wasn\u0027t conscious when this occurred and I guess I\u0027m saying that you weren\u0027t conscious either.\"\n \"Are you telling me we didn\u0027t have this conversation?\" she screams. \"Are you telling me I hallucinated it?\"\n I stare at her. \"Well, in a nutshell, yeah.\"\n Someone starts knocking on the bathroom door, which provokes Alison into some kind of massive freak-out. I grab her by the shoulders and turn her around to face me.\n \"Baby, I was doing my MTV \u0027House of Style\u0027 interview\"-I check the watch I\u0027m not wearing-\"ninety minutes ago, so-\"\n \"Victor, it was you!\" she shouts, pushing me away from her. \"You were standing there outside my place telling me that-\"\n \"You\u0027re wasted!\" I cry out. \"I\u0027m leaving and yeah, baby-it is all over. I\u0027m outta here and of this I\u0027m certain!\"\n \"If you think Damien\u0027s ever going to let you open a f**king door let alone a club after he finds out you\u0027re f**king his little girlfriend you\u0027re more pitifully deluded than I ever thought possible.\"\n \"That\"-I stop, look back at her questioningly-\"doesn\u0027t really mean anything to me.\"\n I swing the door open, Alison standing motionless behind me. A whole group of people squeeze past me and though they probably despise Alison they decide to surround her and take notes while she sobs, her face a wreck.\n \"You are not a player,\" is the last thing Alison ever screams at me.\n I slam the door shut.\n We\u0027ll slide down the surface of things ...\n Lauren stands with Jason London and Elle Macpherson exchanging recipe tips for smart drinks even though someone shockingly famous\u0027s penis exploded when his smart drink was mixed with \"the wrong elements\" and everyone goes \"oooh\" but Lauren\u0027s not really listening because she\u0027s watching Damien schmoozing a group that includes Demi Moore, Veronica Webb and Paulina Porizkova, and when Elle kisses me on the cheek and compliments my stubble Lauren abruptly looks away from Damien and just stares at me blankly-a replicant-and I wipe my nose and move toward her, suddenly in a very huggy mood.\n \"Have you heard?\" she asks, lighting a cigarette.\n \"That I\u0027m in dire need of a crisis-management team? Yes.\"\n \"Giorgio Armani couldn\u0027t make it because he\u0027s in rehearsals for \u0027Saturday Night Live,\u0027 which he\u0027s hosting.\"\n \"Dig it,\" I murmur.\n \"What did Alison want to show you?\" she asks. \"The third claw growing out of her ass?\"\n I grab a martini from a passing waiter. \"No.\"\n \"Oh damnit, Victor,\" she groans. \"Just live up to it.\"\n Chloe stands in the middle of the room chatting with Winona Ryder and Billy Norwich, and Baxter Priestly is perched nearby drinking a tiny white-wine spritzer and people squeezing past us block the view from where Chloe and Damien stand of my hand clutching Lauren\u0027s while Lauren keeps staring at Damien, who\u0027s touching the black fabric of Veronica Webb\u0027s dress and saying things like \"Love the dress but it\u0027s a tad Dracula-y, baby,\" and the girls laugh and Veronica grabs his hand playfully and Lauren\u0027s hand squeezes mine tightly. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-78.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
