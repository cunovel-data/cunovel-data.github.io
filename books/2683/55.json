In front of me she kisses Damien lightly on the lips and he touches the side of her face, each of them silently acknowledging the other, and I can\u0027t look away until Damien glances over at me.\\n\\n I can\u0027t say anything until we\u0027re outside the club. I picked up my Vespa from the coat-check room and am now wheeling it across Union Square, Lauren listlessly moving next to me, the sound of the vacuums inside the club fading behind us. Klieg lights are being rolled across patches of lawn and a film crew is shooting something and extras seem to be wandering aimlessly all around the park. Guillaume Griffin and Jean Paul Gaultier and Patrick Robinson stroll past us. Hordes of Japanese schoolchildren Rollerblade toward the new Gap on Park Avenue and beautiful girls drift by wearing suede hats and ribbed cardigans and Irish jockey caps and there\u0027s confetti strewn all over the benches and I\u0027m still looking down as my feet move slowly along the concrete, walking across large patches of ice so thick that the wheels on the Vespa can\u0027t even crack them and the bike still smells of the patchouli oil I rubbed into it last week, an impulsive move that seemed hip at the moment. I keep my eyes on the guys who pass Lauren by and a couple even seem to recognize her and squirrels skate over the patches of ice in the dim light and it\u0027s almost dark out but not yet.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the story?\" I finally ask.\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" Lauren hugs her wrap coat tighter around herself.\\n\\n \"Todd Oldham show,\" I sigh. \"I\u0027m in it.\"\\n\\n \"Modeling,\" she says. \"A man\u0027s job.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not as easy as it may look.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, modeling\u0027s tough, Victor,\" she says. \"The only thing you need to be is on time. Hard work.\"\\n\\n \"It is,\" I whine.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a job where you need to know how to wear clothes?\" she\u0027s asking. \"It\u0027s a job where you need to know how to-now let me get this straight-walk?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, all I did was learn how to make the most of my looks.\"\\n\\n \"What about your mind?\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" I snicker. \"Like in this world\"-I\u0027m gesturing-\"my mind matters more than my abs. Oh boy, raise your hand if you believe that.\" Pause. \"And I don\u0027t remember you majoring in Brain Surgery at Camden.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t even remember me at Camden,\" she says. \"I\u0027d be surprised if you even remember what happened Monday.\"\\n\\n Stuck, trying to catch her eyes, I say, \"I modeled... and had a... sandwich.\" I sigh.\\n\\n Silently we keep moving through the park.\\n\\n \"He looks like a goddamn schmuck,\" I finally mutter. \"He gets his shorts tailored. Jesus, baby.\" I keep wheeling the Vespa along.\\n\\n \"Chloe deserves better than you, Victor,\" she says.\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"When\u0027s the last time it was just you and her?\" she asks.\\n\\n \"Oh man-\"\\n\\n \"No, seriously, Victor,\" she says. \"Just you and her for a day without any of this bullshit around you?\"\\n\\n \"We went to the MTV Movie Awards,\" I sigh. \"Together.\"\\n\\n \"Oh god,\" she moans. \"Why?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-55.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
