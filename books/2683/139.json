They\u0027re mine,\" I say. \"Listen, if you are Sam Ho, I have a message for you from someone.\"\n \"Oh?\" Sam\u0027s interest perks up. \"Are you a little errand boy?\"\n \"Dirty deeds and they\u0027re done dirt cheap.\"\n \"Oh, and you quote AC/DC lyrics too,\" Sam says faux-sweetly. \"Who wants to give me a message?\"\n \"Bobby Hughes,\" I say flatly.\n Suddenly Sam Ho is in my face, standing so close I have to back away, almost tipping over. \"Hey!\" I warn.\n \"What?\" Sam\u0027s asking, grabbing me. \"Where? Where is he? Is he here?\"\n \"Hey, watch the shirt!\" I cry out, removing his hand from the collar, gently pushing him away. \"No, I\u0027m here instead.\"\n \"Oh, sorry,\" Sam says, backing off a little. \"You\u0027re very, very cute-whoever you are-but you are no Bobby Hughes.\" A pause, then Sam seems crestfallen and panicked. \"You two aren\u0027t a duo-are you?\"\n \"Hey, watch it, Sam,\" I snap. \"I\u0027ve got a very strong reputation and no.\"\n \"Where is he?\" Sam demands. \"Where\u0027s Bobby?\"\n \"Here,\" I say, handing him the envelope. \"I\u0027m just here to give you this and-\"\n Sam\u0027s not listening to me. He tears the envelope open greedily and pulls out the key and squints while reading the note and then he starts shivering uncontrollably and hugging himself, a beatific smile softening the angles of his face, making him seem less queeny, slightly more serene, not so jumpy. In seconds he\u0027s matured.\n \"Oh-my-God,\" Sam\u0027s saying, lost, holding the note against his chest. \"Oh my God-he\u0027s essential.\"\n \"That\u0027s a fan talking,\" I point out.\n \"Can I buy you a drink?\" Sam asks. \"Let me guess-a yuppie beer with a lime stuffed in it?\"\n \"The name\u0027s Victor,\" I point out. \"Victor Ward.\"\n \"Victor, you\u0027re the spitting image of a boy I always wanted to f**k in high school but never had the nerve to approach.\" To calm himself down he lights a Marlboro and exhales dramatically.\n \"I find that hard to believe, Sam,\" I sigh. \"So, like, spare me, okay?\"\n \"Are you staying with Bobby?\" he asks suspiciously.\n \"Yeah,\" I say, shrugging. \"He\u0027s a friend.\"\n \"No-he\u0027s a god, you\u0027re the friend,\" Sam corrects. \"Are you in the house on Charlotte Road?\"\n \"Er, no, we\u0027re in Hampstead.\"\n \"Hampstead?\" Sam looks back at the note. \"But it says here you\u0027re on Charlotte Road.\"\n \"I only stay in hotels,\" I tell him. \"So I\u0027m really not sure where we are.\" I pause, stub out my cigarette. \"It\u0027s just a set anyway.\"\n \"Okay.\" Sam breathes in. \"Do you have a car, and please say yes because I don\u0027t want to have to hijack a cab.\"\n \"Actually,\" I say, \"I have a car and driver out back.\"\n \"Oh, this is excellent,\" Sam says. \"But we have to elude someone.\"\n \"Who?\" I ask, glancing around the VIP room.\n \"Those guys,\" Sam says, nodding his head. \"Don\u0027t look, don\u0027t look. They\u0027re under that gold arch-over there. They just love to play games with me.\"\n What looks like two bodyguards dressed in identical Armani overcoats stand close together not even conferring with each other beneath a blue light that accentuates the size of already enormous heads and they\u0027re being cruised by various fashion victims but their arms are crossed and they don\u0027t seem distracted. Their focus is on Sam, at the bar, leaning in to me.\n \"Who are they?\"\n \"My father\u0027s idea,\" Sam says. \"He\u0027s not happy about certain elements of my life.\"\n \"He has you followed?\" I\u0027m asking, stunned. \"Jesus, and I thought my dad was a major fussbudget.\"\n \"I\u0027m going to tell them I need to use the rest room and then\"-he raps his fingers against my chest-\"ooh, nice pecs-that I\u0027m going home with you.\" He stuffs the envelope into his pocket. \"They\u0027re usually too scared to enter the men\u0027s room with me-for the obvious reasons.\" Sam checks his watch and takes a deep breath. \"I will tell them-before I disappear into the night-that I\u0027m coming back after a much-needed piss to take you home with me, my little freak. Got it?\"\n \"I-I guess that\u0027s, um, cool,\" I say, making a face.\n \"What color is the car?\"\n \"It\u0027s a black limo,\" I say, trying not to look over at the bodyguards. \"A guy with red hair is driving.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-139.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
