They just want to know that you, er, exist.\" JD thinks about it. \"On second thought-\" He\u0027s about to hold me back.\n \"You\u0027ve got to be sensitive to their needs, JD,\" I tell him. \"They\u0027re not just DJs. They\u0027re music designers.\"\n \"Before you go in, Jackie Christie and Kris Spirit are also available.\"\n \"Lesbian DJs, man? I don\u0027t know. Is it happening? Is it cool?\" I slap on a pair of wraparound green-tinted sunglasses before I slip into the VIP room, where a mix of seven guys and girls hang out in two booths, Beau sitting on a chair in front of them with a clipboard. The loony Details girl reporter, hovering dangerously nearby, waves and JD says \"Hey, Beau\" in a very professional way and then glumly introduces me. \"Hey everybody-here\u0027s Victor Ward.\"\n \"My nom de guerre in clubland,\" I faux-gush.\n \"Victor,\" Beau says, standing. \"This is Dollfish, Boomerang, Joopy, CC Fenton, Na Na and, um\"-he checks his clipboard-\"Senator Claiborne Pell.\"\n \"So-o-o,\" I ask, pointing at the guy with blond dreadlocks. \"What do you play?\"\n \"I play Ninjaman but also a lot of Chic and Thompson Twins, and man, this is all kind of borderline bogus.\"\n \"Beau, take note of that,\" I instruct. \"How about you?\" I ask, pointing at a girl wearing a harlequin outfit and dozens of love beads.\n \"Anita Sarko taught me everything I know and I also lived with Jonathan Peters,\" she says.\n \"You\u0027re warming this place up, bay-bee,\" I say.\n \"Victor,\" JD says, pointing at another DJ, hanging back in the dark. \"This is Funkmeister Flex.\"\n \"Hey Funky.\" I lower my sunglasses for a wink. \"Okay, guys, you got three turntables, a tape deck, a DAT player, two CD players and a reel- to-reel for delay effects to spin your respective magic. How does that sound?\"\n Muffled cool noises, mindless looks, more cigarettes lit.\n \"While you\u0027re spinning,\" I continue, pacing, \"I want you all to sulk. I don\u0027t want to see anyone enjoying themselves. Got it?\" I pause to light a cigarette. \"There is techno, there is house, there is hard house, there\u0027s Belgian house, there\u0027s gabba house.\" I pause again, unsure of where I\u0027m going with this, then decide to segue into \"I don\u0027t want to be sweating in an actual warehouse. I want that sweating-in-a-warehouse feeling in a three-million-dollar nightclub with two VIP rooms and four full bars.\"\n \"It should be very chill,\" JD adds. \"And don\u0027t forget ambient dub-we should have that too.\"\n \"I want instantaneous buzz,\" I say, pacing. \"It\u0027s not a lot to ask. I just want you to make these people dance.\" I pause before adding, \"And abortion-clinic violence does not interest me.\"\n \"Um...\" Dollfish tentatively raises a hand.\n \"Dollfish,\" I say. \"Please speak.\"\n \"Um, Victor, it\u0027s already four-fifteen,\" Dollfish says.\n \"Your point, sistah?\" I ask.\n \"What time do you need one of us?\" she asks.\n \"Beau-please take care of these questions,\" I say, bowing, before sweeping out of the room.\n JD follows me as I head back up toward Damien\u0027s office.\n \"Really nice, Victor,\" JD says. \"You inspired people, as usual.\"\n \"That\u0027s my job,\" I say. \"Where\u0027s Damien?\"\n \"Damien has instructed me not to have anyone interrupt him right now,\" JD says.\n \"I have got to complain to him about inviting Martin Davis,\" I say, heading back up the stairs. \"Things are getting horrific.\"\n \"That\u0027s not a good idea, Victor.\" JD runs ahead of me. \"He was very insistent that there be no interruptions.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-53.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
