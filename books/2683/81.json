How did you know Alison was going to be wearing the same dress? And you did know, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Baby,\" I say, semi-exasperated. \"The way you look at things is so hard-\"\\n\\n \"No, no, Victor,\" she says, sitting up. \"It\u0027s very simple. It\u0027s actually very, very simple.\"\\n\\n \"Baby, you\u0027re very, very cool.\"\\n\\n \"I am so tired of looking at that empty expanse that\u0027s supposed to be your face-\"\\n\\n \"Alfonse.\" I raise my hand at a passing busboy, making a pouring motion. \"Mineral water for the table. Con gas?\"\\n\\n \"And why does Damien keep asking me why I\u0027m not wearing a hat?\" she asks. \"Is everyone demented or something?\"\\n\\n Chloe zones out on her reflection in a mirror situated across the room while Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow celebrate her choice of fingernail polish and gradually we drift away from one another and those who aren\u0027t doing drugs light up cigars so I grab one too and somewhere above us, gazing down, the ghosts of River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain and my mother are totally, utterly bored.\\n\\n \"Is Lauren dating Baxter?\" I ask innocently, giving Chloe one last try for an answer, and I\u0027m leaning in, nodding goodbye to Brad and Gwyneth. \"\\n\\n \"\u0027Is Lauren dating Baxter?\u0027\" she mimics. \"I need another Cosmopolitan and then I\u0027m getting the hell out of here.\" She turns her attention to Baxter, completely ignoring me, and I\u0027m totally startled so I do a few cool moves with the cigar and turn to Lauren, who seems to be paying attention to my plight.\\n\\n \"She looks displeased,\" Lauren says, glancing over at Chloe.\\n\\n \"My fault.\" I shrug. \"Forget about it.\"\\n\\n \"Everyone here is just... so... dead.\"\\n\\n \"Alicia Silverstone doesn\u0027t look so dead. Noel Gallagher doesn\u0027t look so dead. JFK Jr. doesn\u0027t look so dead -\\n\\n \"JFK Jr. never showed up, Victor.\"\\n\\n \"Would you like some more dessert?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose it\u0027s all relative,\" she sighs, then starts drawing on a large cocktail napkin with purple Hard Candy nail polish.\\n\\n \"Are you dating Baxter Priestly?\" I finally ask.\\n\\n She looks up from the napkin briefly, smiles a private smile, continues drawing with the nail polish. \"Rumor has it that you are,\" she murmurs.\\n\\n \"Rumor has it that Naomi Campbell\u0027s shortlisted for the Nobel Prize but really, what are the odds?\" I ask, annoyed.\\n\\n Lauren\u0027s looking at Alison, considering her, while Alison pitches forward in her chair, drunkenly grabbing onto Calvin Klein for support, everyone knocking back shots of Patron tequila, a small gold bottle sitting half-empty in the middle of Damien\u0027s plate.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s like a tarantula,\" Lauren whispers.\\n\\n Alfonse starts pouring San Pellegrino into extra glasses scattered around our table. \"Could you please bring her another Diet Dr Pepper?\" I ask him, pointing at Lauren.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Lauren asks, overhearing me.\\n\\n \"Because everything needs to be redefined right now,\" I say. \"Because things need to be redefined for me. People need to sober up, that\u0027s why, and-\"\\n\\n Something crawls up my neck and I whirl around to slap it away but it\u0027s just one of Robert Isabell\u0027s floral arrangements going limp. Lauren looks at me like I\u0027m insane and I pretend to study the point where Mark Vanderloo\u0027s eyebrows don\u0027t meet. Someone says \"Pass the chips,\" someone else says \"Those aren\u0027t chips.\" I finally turn back to Lauren, who\u0027s still writing on the cocktail napkin, concentrating, her eyes slits. I notice the letters W, Q, J, maybe an R. We\u0027ll slide down the surface of things. Damien slowly disengages himself from his table and starts moving toward me, cigar in hand.\\n\\n \"Lauren-\" I start.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re high,\" she says somewhat menacingly.\\n\\n \"I was high. I\u0027m not high anymore. I am no longer high.\" I pause. \"You said that somewhat menacingly.\"\\n\\n I pause, testing the situation. \"But do you have any coke?\" and then, \"Are you, like, carrying?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-81.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
