I\u0027ve been here. Why did you think that?\"\\n\\n \"Victor?\" she asks, pulling back. \"Are you okay?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, baby, I\u0027m cool,\" I say, still crying, trying not to.\\n\\n Upstairs, at Chloe\u0027s request a PR person maneuvers us to a bench in the VIP section, which looks out over the rest of the party. Chloe\u0027s chewing Nicorette, carefully blotting her lipstick, and gold and taupe brow color has been applied to the outer corners of her eyes and I keep grabbing her hand, clutching it, and sometimes she squeezes back.\\n\\n \"How are you?\" she asks.\\n\\n \"Oh great, great.\" Pause. \"Not so great.\" Another pause. \"I think I need some help, baby.\" I try to smile.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not drugs... is it?\" she asks. \"We\u0027re not being bad... are we?\"\\n\\n \"No, no, no, not that, I just-\" I smile tightly, reach out again to rub her hand. \"I just missed you so much and I\u0027m just so glad you\u0027re here and I\u0027m just so sorry for everything,\" I say in a rush, breaking down again.\\n\\n \"Hey, shhh, what\u0027s bringing this on?\" she asks.\\n\\n I can\u0027t talk. My head slips from my hands and I\u0027m just sobbing, tears pouring out.\\n\\n \"Victor? Is everything okay?\" she asks softly. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n I take in a giant breath, then sob again.\\n\\n \"Victor, what\u0027s wrong?\" I hear her ask. \"Do you need any money? Is that it?\"\\n\\n I keep shaking my head, unable to speak. \"Are you in trouble?\" she asks. \"Victor?\" \"No, no, baby, no,\" I say, wiping my face.\\n\\n \"Victor, you\u0027re scaring me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just, it\u0027s just, this is my worst suit,\" I say, trying to laugh.\\n\\n \"Wardrobe dressed me. The director insisted. But it\u0027s just not fitting right.\"\\n\\n \"You look nice,\" she says, relaxing a little. \"You look tired but you look nice.\" She pauses, then adds sweetly, \"I\u0027ve missed you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh baby...\"\\n\\n \"I know I shouldn\u0027t but I do.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, hey...\"\\n\\n \"I left about a dozen messages on your machine in New York last week,\" she says. \"I guess you never\\n\\n got them.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I clear my throat, keep sniffling. \"No, I guess I didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Victor-\"\\n\\n \"So are you seeing anyone?\" I ask, hope cracking my voice apart. \"Did you come here with anyone?\"\\n\\n \"Please. No unpleasant questions. Okay?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, come on, Chloe, just let me know.\"\\n\\n \"Victor, Jesus,\" she says, pulling back. \"We already talked about that. I\u0027m not seeing anyone.\"\\n\\n \"What happened to Baxter?\" I ask, coughing.\\n\\n \"Baxter Priestly?\" she asks. \"Victor-\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Baxter.\" I wipe my face with my hand, then wipe my hand on my pants, still sniffling.\\n\\n \"Nothing. Why?\" Chloe pauses, chewing tensely. \"Victor, I\u0027m suddenly really, really worried about you.\"\\n\\n \"I thought he was in the same movie,\" I blurt out. \"I thought his part got bigger.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been written out,\" she says. \"Not like that should mean anything to you.\"\\n\\n \"Baby, listen, I\u0027m just so happy to see you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re shaking,\" she says. \"You\u0027re really shaking.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just... so cold,\" I say. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n \"Well, the shows,\" she says, staring at me strangely.\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah.\" I reach for her hand again. \"What else?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m also narrating a documentary on the history of the negligee.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s so cool, baby.\"\\n\\n \"Some might say,\" she concedes. \"And yourself? What are you doing in Paris?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just, um, moving on to the next project, y\u0027know?\" I say.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s... constructive.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Go figure,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t have a master plan yet.\"\\n\\n At the entrance of the VIP section, at the top of the steel staircase, Bobby is conferring with Bertrand, who is jabbing his finger at where Chloe and I are sitting while he angrily leans into Bobby and Bobby just nods \"understandingly\" and makes a calming motion with his hand, which Bertrand pushes away disgustedly. Bobby sighs visibly and as he starts making his way over to us, he\u0027s joined by Bentley. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-192.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
