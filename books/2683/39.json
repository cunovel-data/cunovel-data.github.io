He has that whole, y\u0027know, boy-girl thing going.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve forgotten to take off your sunglasses.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t forgotten.\" I take them off, blinking a couple of times. \"So what\u0027s the story, morning glory?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ve been keeping tabs on you.\" He taps the folder ominously. \"And whenever I think about my only son, my thoughts drift back to that conversation we had last summer about perhaps returning to school?\"\\n\\n \"Oh shit, Dad,\" I groan. \"I went to Camden. I barely graduated from Camden. I don\u0027t even know what I majored in.\"\\n\\n \"Experimental Orchestra, as I recall,\" Dad says dryly.\\n\\n \"Hey, don\u0027t forget Design Analysis.\"\\n\\n My father\u0027s gritting his teeth, dying for a drink, his eyes roaming the room. \"Victor, I have contacts at Georgetown, at Columbia, at NYU for Christ sakes. It\u0027s not as difficult as you might think.\"\\n\\n \"Oh shit, Dad, have I ever used you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m concerned about your career and-\"\\n\\n \"You know, Dad,\" I interrupt, \"the question that I always dreaded most at Horace Mann was whenever my counselor would ask me about my career plans.\"\\n\\n \"Why? Because you didn\u0027t have any?\"\\n\\n \"No. Because I knew if I answered him he\u0027d laugh.\"\\n\\n \"I just remember hearing about you being sent home for refusing to remove your sunglasses in algebra class.\"\\n\\n \"Dad, I\u0027m opening this club. I\u0027m doing some modeling.\" I sit up alittle for emphasis.\"\u0027Hey-and I\u0027m waiting to hear if I have a part in Flatliners II.\"\\n\\n \"This is a movie?\" he asks dubiously.\\n\\n \"No-it\u0027s a sandwich,\" I say, stunned.\\n\\n \"I mean, my god,\" he sighs. \"Victor, you\u0027re twenty-seven and you\u0027re only a model?\"\\n\\n \"Only a model?\" I say, still stunned. \"Only a model? I\u0027d rethink the way you phrased that, Dad.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thinking about you working hard at something that-\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Dad, I\u0027ve really grown up in an environment where hard work is the way people get rich. Right.\"\\n\\n \"Just don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re looking for, um, artistic and personal growth through-let me get this straight-modeling?\"\\n\\n \"Dad, a top male model can get eleven thousand dollars a day.\"\\n\\n \"Are you a top male model?\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not a top male model, but that\u0027s not my point.\"\\n\\n \"I lose a lot of sleep, Victor, trying to figure just what your point is.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a loser, baby,\" I sigh, slumping back into the booth. \"So why don\u0027t you kill me?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not a loser, Victor,\" Dad sighs back. \"You just need to, er, find yourself.\" He sighs again. \"Find-I don\u0027t know-a new you?\"\\n\\n \"`A new you\u0027?\" I gasp. \"Oh my god, Dad, you do a great job of making me feel useless.\"\\n\\n \"And opening this club tonight makes you feel what?\"\\n\\n \"Dad, I know, I know-\"\\n\\n \"Victor, I just want-\"\\n\\n \"I just want to do something where it\u0027s all mine,\" I stress. \"Where I\u0027m not... replaceable.\"\\n\\n \"So do I.\" Dad flinches. \"I want that for you too.\"\\n\\n \"A model... modeling is... I\u0027m replaceable,\" I sigh. \"There are a thousand guys who\u0027ve got pouty lips and nice symmetry. But opening something, a club, it\u0027s...\" My voice trails off.\\n\\n After a longish silence Dad says, \"A photo of you in People magazine last week was brought to my attention.\"\\n\\n \"What issue? I didn\u0027t see this. Who was on the cover?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he says, glaring. \"Someone on my staff brought it to my attention.\"\\n\\n \"Goddamnit!\" I slam my hand down on the table. \"This is why I need a publicist.\"\\n\\n \"The point being, Victor, that you were at a fairly lavish hotel somewhere-\"\\n\\n \"A fairly lavish hotel somewhere?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. In Miami.\"\\n\\n \"I was at a hotel? Somewhere in Miami?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. A hotel. In Miami. Wearing-barely-a bathing suit made of white linen and very, very wet-\"\\n\\n \"Did I look good?\"\\n\\n \"Sunglasses.
