I mean, Jesus, this is like a nightmare and you\u0027re taking it so-\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, Victor, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll wake up and figure it all out,\" she says. \"I wouldn\u0027t necessarily bet on it but I think you\u0027ll figure it all out. In the end.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, you sound like you don\u0027t want to ruin the surprise for me.\"\\n\\n \"Victor,\" she\u0027s sighing, \"I have to go.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not me, Lauren,\" I stress again. \"That might be you. But that\u0027s not me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it looks like you, Victor. The paper says it\u0027s you-\"\\n\\n \"Lauren,\" I shout, panicking. \"What in the hell\u0027s happening? Where in the f**k did that photo come from?\"\\n\\n \"Victor,\" she continues calmly. \"We cannot see each other anymore. We cannot talk to each other anymore. This relationship is terminated.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re saying this like you\u0027ve just completed some kind of f**king assignment,\" I cry out.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re projecting,\" she says sternly.\\n\\n \"I urge you, baby, one last time to reconsider,\" I say, breaking down. \"I want to be with you,\" I finally say.\\n\\n \"Trust me, Victor,\" she says. \"You don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Baby, he gets his shirts tailored-\"\\n\\n \"Frankly I couldn\u0027t care less,\" she says. \"Those are things you care about. Those are the things that make you decide a person\u0027s worth.\"\\n\\n After a long pause I say, \"I guess you heard about Mica.\"\\n\\n \"What about Mica?\" she asks, sounding totally uninterested.\\n\\n \"She was, um, murdered, baby,\" I point out, wiping my nose.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think that was a murder,\" Lauren says carefully.\\n\\n After another long pause I ask, \"What was it?\"\\n\\n Finally, solemnly, she says, \"It was a statement,\" giving it more meaning than I\u0027m capable of understanding.\\n\\n \"Spare me, Lauren,\" I whisper helplessly.\\n\\n She hangs up.\\n\\n The camera stops rolling and the makeup girl drops a couple glycerin tears onto my face and the camera starts rolling again and just like in rehearsals I hang the phone up in such a way that it drops out of my hand, swinging by its cord, and then carefully, gently, I lift it up, staring at it. We don\u0027t bother reshooting and it\u0027s on to the next setup.\\n\\n 3\\n\\n Chloe actually lets the doorman buzz me up after the director tells Ashton to give me the rundown so that I\u0027m prepared for the following scene, which is basically that when Chloe skipped the shows she was supposed to do today it caused some kind of horrible ruckus and since \"Hard Copy,\" \"Inside Edition,\" \"A Current Affair,\" \"Entertainment Tonight\" and \"Nightline\" have been calling all morning Chloe is heading to Canyon Ranch for two weeks with Baxter Priestly and in the elevator the director, getting fed up with me, hisses \"Look anguished\" and I try to but I\u0027m just vaguely unhappy and when I glance uncertainly at the camera it rises up as the elevator doors open and follows me into the darkness of the hallway that leads to Chloe\u0027s loft.\\n\\n Inside the apartment it\u0027s freezing, even with all the lights burning; the windows are covered with huge sheets of ice, and frost layers the kitchen cabinets and the giant glass coffee table, the floor slippery in places. The phone keeps ringing, competing with the TV in Chloe\u0027s bedroom, and as I walk in to turn it down a promo for this afternoon\u0027s \"Patty Winters Show\" appears, the host cradling a severely deformed four-year-old while Bette Midler sings \"From a Distance\" on the sound track, and then it\u0027s back to a soap opera, where a character says to another character, \"That wasn\u0027t nice,\" and I move slowly over to the bathroom but Chloe isn\u0027t in there. The tub is full of suds and there are two empty containers of Ben Jerry\u0027s Chubby Hubby ice cream sitting by the sink, next to the retainer Chloe uses to bleach her teeth, which sits beside a large hand mirror that with a twinge of panic I\u0027m about to inspect, but then Chloe walks into the bedroom and I whirl around and the phone keeps ringing.\\n\\n She\u0027s on a cellular, listening to someone, and looking remarkably composed, she glances over at me as she walks toward the bed, on top of which sits the set of Gucci luggage Tom Ford sent for her birthday, and she says something into the phone I can\u0027t hear, then clicks off, and I reconsider opening my arms and saying \"Ta-da!\" but instead ask \"Who was that?\" and then, when there isn\u0027t an answer, \"That\u0027s not your phone.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-89.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
