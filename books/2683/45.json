And they\u0027re all existing in this freezing, screwy-looking loft where DAT tapes and CDs are scattered everywhere, MTV\u0027s on, Presidents of the United States merging into a Mentos commercial merging into an ad for the new Jackie Chan movie, empty Zen Palate take-out boxes are strewn all over the place, white roses dying in an empty Stoli bottle, a giant sad rag-doll photo by Mike Kelly dominates one wall, the collected works of Philip K. Dick fill an entire row in the room\u0027s only bookcase, Lava lamps, cans of Play-Doh.\\n\\n I take a deep breath, enter the room casually, brush some confetti off my jacket.\\n\\n Except Fitz, they all look up, and Aztec immediately starts strumming something from Tommy on his Fender.\\n\\n \"He seems to be completely unreceptive,\" Aztec sings-talks. \"The tests I gave him show no sense at all.\"\\n\\n \"His eyes react to light-the dials detect it,\" Conrad chimes in. \"He hears but cannot answer to your call.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up,\" I yawn, grabbing an ice beer out of the fridge.\\n\\n \"His eyes can see, his ears can hear, his lips speak,\" Aztec continues.\\n\\n \"All the time the needles flick and rock,\" Conrad admits.\\n\\n \"No machine can give the kind of stimulation,\" Fergy points out, \"needed to remove his inner block.\"\\n\\n \"What is happening in his head?\" the three of them sing out.\\n\\n \"Ooh I wish I knew,\" Fitzgerald calls from the beanbag chair for one lucid moment. \"I wish I kneeeeew.\" He immediately rolls over into a fetal position.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re late,\" Conrad snaps.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m late? It takes you guys an hour just to tune up,\" I yawn, flopping onto a pile of Indian pillows. \"I\u0027m not late,\" I yawn again, sipping the ice beer, notice them all glaring at me. \"What? I had to cancel a hair appointment at Oribe to make it here.\" I toss a copy of Spin that\u0027s lying next to an antique hookah pipe at Fitz, who doesn\u0027t even flinch when it hits him.\\n\\n \"\u0027Magic Touch,\u0027\" Aztec shouts out.\\n\\n I answer without trying. \"Plimsouls, Everywhere at Once, 3:19, Geffen.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Walking Down Madison,\u0027\" he tosses out.\\n\\n \"Kirsty MacColl, Electric Landlady, 6:34, Virgin.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Real World.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Jesus Jones, Liquidizer, 3:03, SBK.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Jazz Police.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Leonard Cohen, I\u0027m Your Man, 3:51, CBS.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027You Get What You Deserve.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Big Star, Radio City, 3:05, Stax.\" I yawn. \"Oh, this is too easy.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Ode to Boy.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Yaz, You and Me Both, 3:35, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Top of the Pops.\u0027\" Aztec\u0027s losing interest.\\n\\n \"The Smithereens, Blow Up, 4:32, Capitol.\"\\n\\n \"If only you gave the band that much attention, Victor,\" Conrad says in Conrad\u0027s hey-I\u0027m-hostile-here mode.\\n\\n \"Who came in here last week with a list of songs we should cover?\" I retort.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not gonna sing an acid-house version of `We Built This City,\u0027 Victor,\" Conrad fumes.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re throwing money out the window, dude.\" I shrug.\\n\\n \"Covers are nowhere, Victor,\" Fergy pipes in. \"There\u0027s no money in covers.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what Chloe always tells me,\" I say. \"And if I don\u0027t believe her, how am I gonna believe you?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the point, Victor?\" someone sighs.\\n\\n \"You, babe\"-I\u0027m pointing at Aztec-\"have the ability to take a song that people have heard a million times and play it in a way that no one has ever heard it played before.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re too f**king lazy to write your own material,\" Conrad says, pointing back, full of indie-rock venom. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-45.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
