Hey Beau!\" I call up. \"Make sure all the monitors are either on that virtual-reality videotape or for god\u0027s sake MTV or something. I passed a screen that had VH1 on it, and some fat hick in a ten-gallon hat was weeping-\" \"Will you meet Chloe at Flowers-sorry, Metro CC?\" Beau yells down. \"Because I\u0027m not gonna lie anymore.\" \"Oh, you\u0027ll lie,\" I scream up. \"That\u0027s all you ever do.\" Then, after glancing casually at the Details girl: \"Ask Chloe if she\u0027s bringing Beatrice and Julie.\" Silence from upstairs makes me cringe, then Beau asks, thoroughly annoyed, \"Do you mean Beatrice Arthur and Julie Hagerty?\" \"No,\" I shout, gritting my teeth. \"Julie Delpy and Beatrice Dalle. Spare me. Just do it, Beau.\" \"Beatrice Dalle\u0027s shooting that Ridley Scott-\" \"The speck thing has really gotten to me. You know why?\" I ask the Details girl. \"Because there were... a lot?\" \"Nope. Because I\u0027m a perfectionist, baby. And you can write that down. In fact I\u0027ll wait a minute while you do so.\" Suddenly I rush back to the panel beneath the bar, everyone rushing back with me up the stairs, and I\u0027m wailing, \"Specks! Holy Christ! Help me, somebody, please? I mean everyone\u0027s acting like there\u0027s a question as to whether these specks are an illusion or a reality. I think they\u0027re pretty goddamn real.\" \"Reality is an illusion, baby,\" JD says soothingly. \"Reality is an illusion, Victor.\" No one says anything until I\u0027m handed an ashtray, in which I stub out the cigarette I just lit. \"That\u0027s, uh, pretty heavy,\" I say, looking at the girl reporter. \"That\u0027s pretty heavy, huh?\" She shrugs, rotates her shoulders, doodles again. \"My reaction exactly,\" I mutter. \"Oh, before I forget,\" JD says. \"Jann Wenner can\u0027t make it, but he wants to send a\"-JD glances at his notepad-\"check anyway.\" \"A check? A check for what?\" \"Just a\"-JD glances at his pad again-\"a, um, check?\" \"Oh god. Beau! Beau!\" I call up. \"I think people are wondering why we don\u0027t have a whatchamacallit,\" Peyton says. Then, after much finger snapping, \"Oh yeah, a cause!\" \"A cause?\" I moan. \"Oh god, I can only imagine what kind of cause you\u0027d want. Scholarship fund for Keanu. Find Marky Mark a g*y brain. Send Linda Evangelista to the rain forest so we can pounce on Kyle MacLachlan. No thank you.\" \"Victor, shouldn\u0027t we have a cause?\" JD says. \"What about global warming or the Amazon? Something. Anything.\" \"Passe. Passe. Passe.\" I stop. \"Wait-Beau! Is Suzanne DePasse coming?\" \"What about AIDS?\" \"Passe. Passe.\" \"Breast cancer?\" \"Oh groovy, far out,\" I gasp before slapping him lightly on the face. \"Get serious. For who? David Barton? He\u0027s the only one with tits anymore.\" \"You know what I\u0027m trying to say, Victor,\" JD says. \"Something like Don\u0027t Bungle the Jungle or-\" \"Hey, don\u0027t bungle my jungle, you little mo.\" I consider this. \"A cause, hmm? Because we can\"-I mindlessly light another cigarette-\"make more money?\" \"And let people have some fun,\" JD reminds me, scratching at a tattoo of a little muscle man on his bicep. \"Yeah, and let people have some fun.\" I take a drag. \"I\u0027m considering this, you know, even though the opening is in, oh, less than twenty-four hours.\" \"You know what, Victor?\" Peyton asks slyly. I\u0027m getting the, ah, perverse temptation, baby, to, ah-now don\u0027t get scared, promise?\" \"Only if you don\u0027t tell me who you\u0027ve slept with in the last week.\" Wide-eyed, Peyton claps his hands together and gushes, \"Keep the specks.\" Then, after seeing my face contort, more timidly offers, \"Save... the specks?\" \"Save the specks?\" JD gasps. \"Yes, save the specks,\" Peyton says. \"Damien wants techno, and those little fellas can definitely be construed as techno.\" \"We all want techno, but we want techno without specks,\" JD moans. The camcorder guy zooms in on the specks, and it\u0027s very quiet until he says, yawning, \"Far out.\" \"People people people.\" I lift my hands up. \"Is it possible to open this club without humiliating ourselves in the process?\" I start to walk away. \"Because I\u0027m beginning to think it\u0027s not possible. Comprende?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-3.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
