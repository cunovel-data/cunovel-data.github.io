{"id":69407,"no":220,"title":"Page 220","content":"As Reed walks me out onto Fifth Avenue he asks, \"How\u0027s that apple diet working out?\" \"Great,\" I say, waving down a cab. \"My girlfriend says my seminal fluid tastes sweeter.\" \"That\u0027s cool, man,\" Reed says. I hop into a cab. Before the door closes, Reed leans in and, offering his hand after a pause, says, \"I\u0027m sorry about Chloe, man.\" 7 After some impassioned clothing removal I\u0027m sucking lightly on Alison\u0027s br**sts and I keep looking up at her, making eye contact, rolling my tongue across her ni**les and holding on to her br**sts, applying slight pressure but not squeezing them, and she keeps sighing, content. Afterwards Alison admits she never faked an orgasm for my benefit. We\u0027re lying on her bed, the two dogs-Mr. and Mrs. Chow-snuggled deeply in the folds of a neon-pink comforter at our feet, and I\u0027m running my hands through their fur. Alison\u0027s talking about Aerosmith as a Joni Mitchell CD plays throughout the room at low volume. \"Steven Tyler recently admitted that his first wet dream was about Jane Fonda.\" Alison sighs, sucks in on a joint I didn\u0027t hear her light. \"How old does that make him?\" I keep stroking Mr. Chow, scratching his ears, both his eyes shut tight with pleasure. \"I want a dog,\" I murmur. \"I want a pet.\" \"You used to hate these dogs,\" Alison says. \"What do you mean, a pet? The only pet you ever owned was the Armani eagle.\" \"Yeah, but I changed my mind.\" \"I think that\u0027s good,\" Alison says genuinely. A long pause. The dogs reposition themselves, pressing in close to me. \"I hear you\u0027re seeing Damien tomorrow,\" Alison says. Chapter Twenty I stiffen up a little. \"Do you care?\" \"What are you seeing him about?\" she asks. \"I\u0027m telling him\"-I sigh, relax-\"I\u0027m telling him that I can\u0027t open this club with him. Law school\u0027s just too... time-consuming.\" I take the joint from Alison. Inhale, exhale. \"Do you care?\" I ask. \"I mean, about Damien?\" \"No,\" she says. \"I\u0027ve totally forgiven Damien. And though I really can\u0027t stand Lauren Hynde, compared to most of the other wenches that cling to guys in this town she\u0027s semi-acceptable.\" \"Is this on the record?\" I grin. \"Did you know she\u0027s a member of WANAH?\" Alison asks. \"That new feminist group?\" \"What\u0027s WANAH?\" \"It\u0027s an acronym for We Are Not A Hole,\" she sighs. \"We also share the same acupuncturist.\" Alison pauses. \"Some things are unavoidable.\" \"I suppose so.\" I\u0027m sighing too. \"And she\u0027s also a member of PETA,\" Alison says, \"so I can\u0027t totally hate her. Even if she was-even if she is-fucking what was once my fiance.\" \"What\u0027s PETA?\" I ask, interested. \"People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\" Alison slaps me playfully. \"You should know that, Victor.\" \"Why should I know that?\" I ask. \"Ethical treatment of... animals?\" \"It\u0027s very simple, Victor,\" she says. \"We want a world where animals are treated as well as humans are.\" I just stare at her. \"And... you don\u0027t think that\u0027s... happening?\" \"Not when animals are being killed as indiscriminately as they are now. No.\" \"I see.\" \"There\u0027s a meeting on Friday at Asia de Cuba,\" Alison says. \"Oliver Stone, Bill Maher, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, Grace Slick, Noah Wyle, Mary Tyler Moore. Alicia Silverstone\u0027s reading a speech that Ellen DeGeneres wrote.\" Alison pauses. \"Moby\u0027s the DJ.\" \"Everyone will be wearing camouflage pants, right?\" I ask. \"And plastic shoes? And talking about how great fake meat tastes?\" \"Oh, what\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" she snaps, rolling her eyes, distinctly less mellow. \"It doesn\u0027t mean anything.\" \"If you heard about leg-hold traps, the torture of baby minks, the maiming of certain rabbits-not to even mention medical experiments done on totally innocent raccoons and lynxes-my god, Victor, you\u0027d wake up.\" \"Uh-huh,\" I say. \"Oh baby,\" I mutter. \"It\u0027s animal abuse and you\u0027re just lying there.\" \"Honey, they save chickens.\" \"They have no voice, Victor.\" \"Baby, they\u0027re chickens.\" \"You try seeing the world through the eyes of an abused animal,\" she says.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-220.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
