A smallish article about you, and this pull quote: `In the uterus of love we are all blind cave fish.\u0027 Is this true, Victor? Could you please explain the term `uterus\u0027 in the context of that sentence? And also if blind cave fish actually exist?\" \"Oh boy-a two-parter.

Here it looks as if there are two guys-though what the hell do I know, it could be two gals-and yes, they\u0027re kissing each other and you\u0027re looking on with your hands down the front of your pants. Why are your hands down the front of your pants?

What you say and do actually affects my life, and because of what my life is like, it can be acutely embarrassing for me.\" \"Dad-\" \"I just wanted to point this out.\" \"Spare me, please.\" \"It also says here that you\u0027re in a band called Pussy Beat, which used to be called\"-he gulps-\"Kitchen Bitch.\" \"We\u0027ve changed the name.
