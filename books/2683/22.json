Just girls, just people on the street. This one girl-the only one who hadn\u0027t seen the 600SEL, who couldn\u0027t tell Versace from the Gap, who didn\u0027t even glance at the Patek Philippe-\" He turns to the goons, one who keeps eyeing me in a f**ked-up way. \"That\u0027s a watch you might never own. Anyway, she\u0027s the only one who would talk to me, just some dumpy chick who came on to me in Chemical Bank, and I motioned sadly to her that I was mute, you know, tongueless, that I simply couldn\u0027t speak, what have you. But get this-she knew sign language.\"\n After Damien stares at me, I say, \"Ah.\"\n \"I tell you, Victor,\" Damien continues, \"the world is full of surprises. Most of them not that interesting but surprising nonetheless. Needless to say, it was a mildly scary, humiliating moment. It actually bordered on the horrific, but I moved through it.\" He sips his latte. \"Could I actually not be in vogue? I panicked, man. I felt... old.\"\n \"Oh man, you\u0027re only twenty-eight.\" I nod to Beau, letting him know that he can slink back upstairs.\n \"Twenty-eight, yeah.\" Damien takes this in, but instead of dealing he just waves at the stacks of papers on the table. \"Everything going as planned? Or are there any imminent disasters I should be apprised of?\"\n \"Here are the invites.\" I hand him one. \"I don\u0027t think you ever had the time to see these.\"\n \"Nice, or as my friend Diane Von Furstenberg likes to say-nass.\"\n \"Yeah, they were printed on recycled paper with boy-based-I mean soy-based ink.\" I close my eyes, shake my head, clear it. \"Sorry, those little mos upstairs are getting to me.\"\n \"Opening this club, Victor, is tantamount to making a political statement,\" Damien says. \"I hope you know that.\"\n I\u0027m thinking, Spare me, but say, \"Yeah, man?\"\n \"We\u0027re selling myths.\"\n \"Mitts?\"\n \"No, myths. M-y-t-h-s. Like if a fag was gonna introduce you to Miss America, what would he say?\"\n \"Myth... America?\"\n \"Right on, babe.\" Damien stretches, then slouches back into the booth. \"I can\u0027t help it, Victor,\" he says blankly. \"I sense sex when I walk around the club. I feel... compelled.\"\n \"Man, I\u0027m so with you.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a club, Victor. It\u0027s an aphrodisiac.\"\n \"Here is the, um, seating arrangements for the dinner and then the list of press invited to the cocktail party beforehand.\" I hand him a sheaf of papers, which Damien hands to one of his goons, who stares at it, like duh.\n \"I just want to know who\u0027s at my table,\" Damien says vacantly.\n \"Um, here...\" I reach over to grab the papers back, and for an instant the goon glares at me suspiciously before gradually releasing his grip. \"Um, table one is you and Alison and Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger and Tim Hutton and Uma Thurman and Jimmy and Jane Buffett and Ted Field and Christy Turlington and David Geffen and Calvin and Kelly Klein and Julian Schnabel and Ian Schrager and Russell Simmons, along with assorted dates and wives.\"\n \"I\u0027m between Uma Thurman and Christy Turlington, right?\"\n \"Well, Alison and Kelly-\"\n \"No no no no. I\u0027m between Christy and Uma,\" Damien says, pointing a finger at me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-22.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
