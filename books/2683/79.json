They\u0027re the stars of Bill and Ted\u0027s Homosexual Adventure.\"\n \"It\u0027s, um, time for dinner,\" JD says tentatively, trying not to notice Alison vibrating with rage, emitting low rumbling sounds. She finally looks over at Damien\u0027s falsely placid face and sneers, dropping her cigarette into his glass. Damien makes a strangled noise, then averts his eyes from the martini.\n \"Um, great,\" Damien says. \"Dinnertime. Fantastic. Here, Beau.\" Damien hands Beau his martini glass. While we all watch, Beau stares at it and then very carefully places the glass on a nearby table.\n \"Yeah, great,\" I say, overly enthusiastic, unable to stop staring at the cigarette floating in the martini. \"Hey, who\u0027s this?\" I ask, shaking the surfer\u0027s limp hand.\n \"This is Plez,\" someone says.\n \"Hey Plez,\" Damien says, glancing quickly at Alison. \"How ya loin\u0027?\"\n \"Plez is a snowboarder,\" JD says.\n \"And he won the world half-pipe championship,\" Beau adds.\n \"And he\u0027s a messenger at UPS,\" JD adds.\n \"Cha cha cha,\" I say.\n Conversation stops. No one moves.\n \"Cha... cha... cha,\" I say again.\n \"So-o-o, dude-what are you doing in Manhattan?\" Damien asks Plez, glancing quickly at Lauren.\n \"He just returned from Spain, where he was shooting a video for Glam Hooker,\" Beau says, patting Plez on the head.\n Plez is shrugging amiably, eyes half-closed, reeking of marijuana, nodding out.\n \"How brill.\" I\u0027m nodding too.\n \"Total brill,\" JD says.\n \"Not to mention fagulous,\" Beau gushes.\n \"Totally brill and totally fagulous,\" JD adds.\n Chloe appears and her hand\u0027s freezing as it clasps mine and looking at the floor I\u0027m thinking my god someone will have to do a lot of vacuuming and Lauren offers Baxter a tight smile and the gravity of the situation starts to become apparent to most of us as Bridget Fonda and Gerlinda Kostiff pass by.\n \"Let\u0027s, er, eat.\" Damien claps his hands, knocking himself out of some kind of reverie, startling all of us out of our own respective silences. Alison looks so drunk and is staring at Lauren with so much hatred that the urge to sneak away is almost overwhelming.\n \"The way you said that was so, um... debonair,\" I tell Damien.\n \"Well, I just think we should sit down before the nonessential personnel arrive at eleven,\" he says, shoving Alison away from the rest of us, at the same time holding tightly on to one arm. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-79.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
