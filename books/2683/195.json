He decides something and shuffles toward a large-screen TV that\u0027s ensconced in a white-oak armoire across from the bed I\u0027m shivering in. \"But in light of what\u0027s about to happen, I think it\u0027s probably imperative that you view this.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, hey, wait,\" I\u0027m saying. \"No, please, don\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"I really think you should see this, Victor.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" I\u0027m pleading, afraid. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t for you,\" he says. \"This is for someone else\u0027s benefit.\"\\n\\n He blows confetti off the tape before slipping it into the VCR below the TV. \"We think that Bobby Hughes is getting out of hand.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m wrapping myself in a comforter, freezing, steam pouring from my mouth because of how cold it is in the house.\\n\\n \"I think things need to be reduced for you,\" the director says. \"In order for you to... see things clearly.\" He pauses, checks something on the VCR\u0027s console. \"Otherwise we\u0027ll be shooting this all year.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I have the energy to watch this.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s short,\" the director says. \"You still have some semblance of an attention span left. I checked.\"\\n\\n \"But I might get confused,\" I say, pleading. \"I might get thrown off-\"\\n\\n \"Thrown off what?\" the director snaps. \"You\u0027re not even on anything to get thrown off of.\"\\n\\n He presses Play on the console. I motion for him to sit next to me on the bed because I\u0027m getting so tense I need to hold his hand even though he\u0027s wearing leather gloves, and he lets me.\\n\\n Blackness on the screen blooms into random footage of Bobby.\\n\\n Bobby on Boulevard du Montparnasse. Bobby sitting in La Coupole. Bobby heading down the Champs Elyssees. Bobby taking notes while waiting for the Vivienne Westwood show to begin, sitting in a giant room in the basement of the Louvre. Bobby crossing Rue de Rivoli. Bobby crossing Quai des Celestins. He\u0027s turning down Rue de l\u0027Hotel-de-Ville. He enters the metro station at Pont Marie. He\u0027s on a train, grabbing an overhead handrail as the train slowly enters the Sully-Morland station. A shot of Bobby on an Air Inter flight from Paris to Marseilles, reading a copy of Le Figaro. Bobby\u0027s picking up a rental car at the Provence airport.\\n\\n \"What are these? Highlights?\" I\u0027m asking, relaxing a little.\\n\\n \"Shh. Just watch,\" the director says.\\n\\n \"Bobby doesn\u0027t know you\u0027re showing me this,\" I ask again. \"Does he?\"\\n\\n Bobby gets off a plane that just landed at Le Bourget airport.\\n\\n Bobby walks along the Place des Voyages and into a restaurant called Benoit.\\n\\n Bobby in the tunnel on the Place de l\u0027Alma, near its east end, crouching by the concrete divider that separates the eastbound and westbound lanes.\\n\\n Suddenly a scene I don\u0027t remember shooting. Cafe Flore. It\u0027s only me in the shot and I\u0027m tan, wearing white, my hair slicked back, and I\u0027m looking for a waitress.\\n\\n \"This cappuccino sucks, dude,\" I\u0027m muttering. \"Where\u0027s the froth?\" A boom mike is visible above my head.\\n\\n A voice-Bobby\u0027s-says, \"We\u0027re not here for the cappuccino, Victor.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you\u0027re not, baby, but I want some froth.\"\\n\\n A shot of a line of schoolgirls singing as they walk along Rue Saint-Honore.\\n\\n Then static.\\n\\n And then a close-up: airplane tickets to Tel Aviv.\\n\\n Bobby\u0027s outside Dschungel, a club in Berlin, calling a girl a slut. A famous American football player is idling behind him.\\n\\n Bobby in front of a Jewish synagogue in Istanbul.\\n\\n Bobby wearing a skullcap. Bobby praying in Hebrew.\\n\\n Bobby at the Saudi embassy in Bangkok.\\n\\n Bobby drifting out of a bungalow in Tripoli, walking past a discarded radio antenna, an expensive Nikon camera swinging around his neck. A group of men follow him, wearing head scarves, holding Samsonite briefcases.\\n\\n Someone singing a love song in Arabic plays over the sound track.\\n\\n Bobby hops into a battered Mercedes 450SEL. A Toyota bus with bulletproof windows trails the Mercedes as it heads into a dark, vast desert.\\n\\n The camera pans to a bulldozer scooping out a giant pit. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-195.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
