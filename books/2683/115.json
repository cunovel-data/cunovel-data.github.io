The man glowering at me is much older than Stephen; and the woman, confused, looking down at her plate, is much dowdier and plainer than Lorrie. Marina has turned her head away so her face is just a blur. I\u0027m the only one smiling and relaxed, which amazes me since the only things that look even remotely familiar are the small mound of caviar on my plate and the carafes of the wine Stephen ordered and the Japanese women, in shadows, at the next table. The original and the three copies I requested are spread out on a desk I\u0027m chain-smoking at, and it\u0027s so cold in the room I\u0027m half-frozen, wearing two J. Crew sweaters under the giant Versace overcoat, and the remains of today\u0027s hangover linger, insistent, like some kind of reminder. I\u0027m vaguely aware that tomorrow the QE2 docks in Southampton. \"So you\u0027re not going to Paris?\" Palakon asks. \"So you\u0027ll be in London after all?\" A long stretch of silence that I\u0027m responsible for causes Palakon to snap, \"Hello? Hello?\" \"Yes,\" I say hollowly. \"How did you figure that... out?\" \"I just sensed a change of heart,\" Palakon says. \"How did you manage that?\" \"Let\u0027s just say I know these precocious moments of yours usually come to an end,\" I hear him say. \"Let\u0027s just say I concentrate intensely on you and what you have to say and do.\" A pause. \"I\u0027m also viewing everything from a different angle.\" \"I\u0027m a lover, not a fighter, Palakon,\" I sigh. \"We\u0027ve located Jamie Fields,\" Paiakon says. Briefly, I glance up. \"So my job\u0027s over, right?\" \"No,\" Palakon says. \"Just made easier.\" \"What are you doing right now, Palakon?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Some lackey\u0027s giving you a pedicure while you\u0027re eating a giant box of mints? That\u0027s what I\u0027m picturing.\" \"Jamie Fields is in London,\" Palakon says. \"You\u0027ll find her the day after tomorrow on the set of the movie she\u0027s shooting. All the information you need will be waiting for you at the hotel. A driver will pick you up-\" \"A limo?\" I ask, interrupting. A pause, then Palakon gently says, \"Yes, Mr. Ward, a limo-\" \"Thank you.\" \"-will pick you up in Southampton and drive you into London, where I will contact you.\" I keep moving all four copies of the photograph around, repositioning them while Palakon drones on. I light another cigarette before stubbing out the last one. \"Do you understand, Mr. Ward?\" \"Yes, I understand, Mr. Palakon,\" I answer in a monotone. Pause. \"You sound on edge, Mr. Ward.\" \"I\u0027m just trying to ascertain something.\" \"Is that it, or are you just trying to strike a pose?\" \"Listen, Palakon, I\u0027ve gotta go-\" \"Where are you off to, Mr. Ward?\" \"There\u0027s a gnome-making class that\u0027s starting in ten minutes and I wanna get a head start.\" \"I\u0027ll talk to you when you arrive in London, Mr. Ward.\" \"I\u0027ve already marked it down in my datebook.\" \"I\u0027m relieved to hear it, Mr. Ward.\" 1 I find Felix the cinematographer at the piano bar, hunched over an array of snifters half-filled with brandy as he stares miserably at his own reflection in the mirrors situated above the racks of alcohol, relentlessly smoking Gauloises. The pianist-who I\u0027m just noticing much to my horror is also the male aerobics instructor with the hideous teeth- plays a mournful version of \"Anything Goes.\" I take the stool next to Felix and slap the photograph next to his arm. Felix doesn\u0027t flinch. Felix hasn\u0027t shaved in what looks like days. \"Felix,\" I say, trying to contain myself \"Look at this photo.\" \"I don\u0027t want to look at any photos,\" Felix says miserably in his halting, untraceable accent. \"Felix, please, it\u0027s important,\" I say. \"I think.\" \"I\u0027m not supposed to look at the photo, Victor.\" \"Fuck it-just look at the f**king photo, Felix,\" I spit out, panicking. Felix turns to me, muttering \"Grouchy, grouchy,\" then glances tiredly at the picture. \"Yeah? So? People having caviar, people not looking so happy.\" He shrugs. \"It happens.\" \"Felix, I did not have caviar with these people,\" I\u0027m saying. \"Yet this photograph ex-ex-exists,\" I sputter.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-115.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
