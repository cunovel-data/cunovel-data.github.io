I\u0027m not saying let\u0027s f**k. I\u0027m just saying maybe we can get... reacquainted.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, nothing shocks me anymore, baby.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good... That\u0027s very good, Victor.\"\\n\\n A voice above me, someone hanging over the banister wearing a Gucci tux, someone way too exquisitely handsome and my age, a guy who might or might not be Bentley Harrolds, the model, totally drunk, his tumbler filled to the brim with clear liquid dangling precariously from a hand attached to a sagging wrist:\\n\\n \"Oh, what a circus,\" he groans. \"Oh, what a show.\"\\n\\n I immediately turn off the recorder and drop it back into Jamie\u0027s tote bag, then look up at Bentley, flashing a sexy grin that causes Bentley\u0027s eyes to widen and then he\u0027s leering at me, blood rushing to his head turning his face crimson, and still hanging over the banister, he slurs, \"You certainly don\u0027t make a mundane first impression.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re Bentley Harrolds,\" I say and then, gesturing toward the glass, \"Hey bud, what are you drinking?\"\\n\\n \"Er...\" Bentley looks at his hand and then back at me, his eyes crossed with concentration. \"I\u0027m sipping chilled Bacardi,\" and then, still staring down at me: \"You\u0027re full-frontal gorgeous.\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ve been told,\" I say, and then, \"How gorgeous?\"\\n\\n Bentley\u0027s moving down the staircase and now he\u0027s standing over me, swaying back and forth, flushed.\\n\\n \"You look like Brad Pitt,\" Bentley says. \"After he\u0027s just wrestled a large... furry... bear.\" Pause. \"And that gets me hot.\"\\n\\n \"Just give me a minute to calm down.\"\\n\\n \"What were you doing going through Jamie Fields\u0027 tote bag, by the way?\" Bentley asks, trying to sit, but I\u0027m scooting all over the couch, making it virtually impossible. He gives up, sighs, tries to focus.\\n\\n \"Um, I suppose you don\u0027t want to hear about my strenuous workout in the Four Seasons gym this morning instead, huh?\"\\n\\n A long pause while Bentley considers this. \"I... might\"-he gulps-\"faint.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t be the first.\"\\n\\n The Japanese guy keeps swigging bourbon and glancing over at me, then nudges another Japanese guy, who waves him away and goes back to watching \"Friends,\" chewing down on a carton of Hagen-Dazs Chocolate Midnight Cookies. With a grunt, Bentley squeezes down next to me on the lime-green couch and-concentrating on my arms, chest and legs-finally has to admit something.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m capable of being thrilled by you, Victor.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, I thought you recognized me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you\u0027re recognizable, all right,\" Bentley guffaws.\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s me.\"\\n\\n Bentley pauses, considers something. \"Can I ask you something, Victor?\"\\n\\n \"Shoot.\"\\n\\n Bentley shakes his head side to side slowly and in a low voice warns, \"Oh, you shouldn\u0027t suggest that.\"\\n\\n \"I meant\"-I clear my throat-\"go ahead.\"\\n\\n Bentley clears his throat lightly, then asks, totally serious, \"Are you still dating Stephen Dorff?\"\\n\\n Jamie suddenly flops down between us as I\u0027m coughing up the tequila punch, taking in air. \"There\u0027s a croquet game on the sixth floor and accessories on five,\" she says, kissing Bentley on the cheek.\\n\\n \"Hello, darling,\" Bentley says, kissing her back.\\n\\n \"Why are you choking?\" Jamie asks me. \"Why is he choking?\" she asks Bentley, and then, \"Oh Bentley, what did you do?\"\\n\\n \"Moi?\" Bentley whines. \"Oh, just asked a personal question that got exactly the kind of response that satisfied me immensely.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t answer any question,\" I croak, wiping my mouth.\\n\\n \"Well, give Bentley an answer now, baby,\" Bentley says.\\n\\n Playing along-but also panicked-I shrug. \"Maybe it\u0027s true.\"\\n\\n Bentley takes this in calmly, then, totally deadpan, his eyes closed with pain and longing, asks, \"Would you move in with me, please?\"\\n\\n \"How disco, baby,\" I say, recovering. \"But I\u0027m, um\"-I glance over at Jamie, who seems like she could care less-\"involved.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-128.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
