Where\u0027s my Jacuzzi, man?\"\n \"Gentlemen do not talk about money,\" Palakon says. \"Especially when they\u0027re not paying.\"\n \"Whoa,\" I say, and then, \"Who\u0027s a gentleman?\"\n \"I\u0027m trying to imagine that you are, dear Victor.\"\n \"What are you, Palakon? You talk like some kind of pampered weenie.\"\n \"Is that a cheap attempt to play upon my emotions, Mr. Ward?\"\n \"This traveling-by-sea business is bor-ing,\" I say. \"There\u0027s no one famous or young on this damn boat. There are sixteen hundred people on this damn boat and they\u0027re all ancient. Everyone has Alzheimer\u0027s, everyone\u0027s blind, everyone\u0027s hobbling around on crutches.\"\n \"Surely you\u0027re exaggerating.\"\n \"I\u0027m really really tired of old people, Palakon,\" I say. \"I\u0027m just so tired.\"\n \"I\u0027ll call Cunard and tell them to set up a piercing parlor, a tattoo emporium, a cyberspace roller rink,\" Palakon says wearily. \"Something that has that kind of grungy honesty you young people respond to so well.\"\n \"I\u0027ll still be so tired, Palakon.\"\n \"Then get some sleep,\" Palakon says hollowly. \"Isn\u0027t that what people do who are tired?\"\n \"I\u0027m tired of muttering\u0027Where am I\u0027whenever I find myself in the wrong corridor or some wrong deck that\u0027s like miles away from the deck I wanted to be on.\" I pause, then add, \"Surrounded by old people!\"\n \"I\u0027m sure there is no shortage of you-are-here maps to help you out, Victor,\" he says, losing patience. \"Ask one of the old people for directions.\"\n \"But the old people are blind!\"\n \"Blind people often have an excellent sense of direction,\" Palakon practically shouts. \"They\u0027ll tell you where you are.\"\n \"Yeah, but where am I, Palakon?\"\n \"By my estimate somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,\" Palakon sighs, giving up. \"My god, must everything be explained to you?\"\n Mortified, I suddenly blurt out, \"Yeah!\"\n \"Mr. Ward, I\u0027m just checking in,\" Palakon says, seemingly disinterested in my problems. \"I\u0027ll call you once more before you arrive in Southampton.\"\n \"Hey, Palakon, about that,\" I start.\n \"Yes, Mr. Ward?\"\n \"How about if I take a little side trip to France before going to London?\" I ask.\n A long pause before Palakon asks, \"Why?\"\n \"I met a girl,\" I say.\n Another pause. \"And so?\"\n \"I-met-a-girl,\" I repeat.\n \"Yes, but I am not understanding you.\"\n \"Like, I\u0027m gonna go with this girl to Paris, duh,\" I say loudly. \"Why else do you think I\u0027d be going there? To take part in a fromage-eating contest? Christ, Palakon, get your shit together.\"\n \"Victor,\" Palakon starts, \"that\u0027s not a particularly good idea. Turning back-which is essentially what you\u0027d be doing-is unthinkable at this point.\"\n \"Hello?\" I say, sitting up. \"Could you please repeat that? Hello?\"\n \"Just go on about your business,\" Palakon sighs. \"Just follow the script.\"\n \"Palakon, I want to go to Paris with this girl,\" I warn.\n \"That would be a grim alternative,\" Palakon warns back, gravely. \"That would be self-destructive.\"\n \"But I think that\u0027s in my nature,\" I explain. \"I think that\u0027s what my character\u0027s all about.\"\n \"Maybe this trip will change your character.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure.\"\n \"I\u0027ll call you before you reach Southampton, Victor.\"\n \"Palakon, wait-\"\n He clicks off.\n 10\n Around 12 I dress casually and rouse myself from the cabin, heading ostensibly to the midnight buffct being served in the Mauretania Room but really to any bar where I can very quickly down four vodkaand-cranberries and find Marina. Prowling along the upper starboard deck as if on a catwalk-it\u0027s cold out and dark-I\u0027m spying into windows at all the joyless mingling taking place at the midnight buffet. I spot the g*y German holding a plate piled high with smoked salmon and even though he\u0027s heading toward a table just a foot or two away from where I\u0027m standing, I doubt he can see beyond his own reflection in the window, but then he begins to squint past his image and his face lights up so I whirl around and run straight into the Wallaces strolling along the deck. She\u0027s wearing what looks like a strapless Armani gown, Stephen\u0027s tuxedo jacket draped over her shoulders, protection from the midnight chill. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-103.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
