Jamie keeps staring at me. I\u0027m nodding my head to the music, trying to get a grip.\n \"What are you doing in London, Victor?\" Jamie asks.\n \"Having a fly time, bay-bee,\" I say, leaning up into her face, kissing her again on the lips, this time harder, a tongue slipping through. Jamie kisses back but suddenly it\u0027s broken because of shadows standing over us and someone saying, \"Kula Shaker\u0027s performing on the sixth floor.\"\n Above us is this impossibly gorgeous couple, smiling wryly at Jamie as if she\u0027d just done something wrong, and the girl is wearing a white Yohji Yamamoto sheer slip dress and I vaguely recognize her as Tammy, this model from Kentucky, and she\u0027s holding hands with Bruce Rhinebeck, also model handsome and wearing a shiny Gucci fitted suit with a Dolce Gabbana leather jacket over it and he automatically hands Jamie the joint they\u0027re sharing.\n \"And word is flashing about that the DJ on the roof is Laurent Garnier,\" Bruce says. \"Sounds crunchy, huh?\"\n \"Hey guys,\" Jamie says, and then, an afterthought, \"Oh, this is Victor Ward.\"\n \"Ah, terrific,\" Bruce says, not ungentlemanly. \"Another expatriate.\"\n \"Nice eyebrows, bud,\" I tell Bruce.\n \"Thanks,\" he says. \"They\u0027re mine.\"\n \"We\u0027re bored and need to split,\" Tammy says.\n \"Can we go to Speed tonight?\" Bentley asks. \"LTJ Bukem is spinning. Or we can stay here because I think I\u0027m having the time of my life.\"\n \"I\u0027ve had the most terrible day,\" Tammy says. \"I just want to go home and collapse.\"\n \"What are you drinking?\" Jamie asks, taking the glass out of Tammy\u0027s hand. \"Can I have a sip?\"\n \"It\u0027s rum, tonic and lime juice,\" Tammy says. \"We overheard somewhere that it\u0027s the new drink of the decade.\"\n \"Drink of the decade?\" Bentley groans. \"Oh, how horribly disgusting. What horribly disgusting person so named that measly little cocktail?\"\n \"Actually it was Stella McCartney,\" Tammy says.\n \"Oh, she\u0027s wonderful,\" Bentley says, sitting up. \"I love Stella - ooh, let me have a sip.\" He smacks his lips after tasting the drink. \"Oh my god-I think Stella\u0027s right. This little baby is the new drink of the decade. Jamie-alert the media. Somebody-nab a publicist.\"\n \"I spent most of the day at the Elite Premier offices.\" Tammy yawns, leaning into Bruce. \"Then lunch in Chelsea.\"\n \"Oh, where?\" Bentley asks, studying a white rose.\n \"Aubergine,\" Tammy sighs. \"I spent what could have been two hours in Vent and then I had drinks at the Sugar Club before coming here. Oh Jesus, what a day.\"\n \"I had that Craig McDean photo shoot,\" Bruce says, taking the joint back from Jamie. \"Then I watched representation for the Spice Girls sign a gargantuan record deal and had an early dinner at Oxo Tower with Nick Knight, Rachel Whitehead and Danny Boyle.\"\n \"You\u0027re a man of substance.\" Jamie smiles.\n \"I\u0027m a preeminent tastemaker.\" Bruce smiles back.\n \"You\u0027re sheer genius, baby,\" Tammy tells Jamie.\n \"And you\u0027re the fall\u0027s most revealing fashion trend,\" Bentley tells Tammy.\n \"A-list all the way,\" Bruce says, squeezing Tammy\u0027s hand.\n \"What is this?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Night of the Perpetually Chic?\"\n \"It looks like everybody\u0027s going somewhere, but they\u0027re not, really,\" Tammy says, looking around.\n \"Let\u0027s face it, the impression I get is: boom-this is over,\" Bruce says, finishing the roach.\n Since the tape of \"Friends\" is being rerun, the Japanese guy has engaged two of his buddies to start looking at me and he\u0027s gesturing wildly and I\u0027m trying to recall the ads I did that appeared in Japan but can\u0027t come up with any and Bruce is noticing my discomfort so he glances back at the Japanese guys and then Tammy and Jamie follow suit and I notice an almost imperceptible nod on Tammy\u0027s part that makes Bruce suggest, \"Maybe, guys, it\u0027s time we escape.\"\n Jamie leans into me and whispers, \"Why don\u0027t you come with us?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-130.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
