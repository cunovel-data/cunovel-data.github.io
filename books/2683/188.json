He\u0027s pretending to smile at someone.\\n\\n Jamie Fields is walking uncertainly toward us, clutching a small white paper bag-no makeup, sweatpants, hair pulled back with a scrunchie, Gucci sunglasses.\\n\\n Behind her the French film crew is piling equipment into a blue van that\u0027s double-parked on Avenue Verdier.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" she asks, lowering her sunglasses.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I\u0027m saying, gesturing mindlessly.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" she asks, a little mystified. \"Victor?\"\\n\\n \"Oh yeah, y\u0027know, just hanging,\" I\u0027m saying vacantly, semi-stunned. \"I\u0027m just... hanging, um, baby.\"\\n\\n Pause. \"What?\" she asks, laughing, as if she hasn\u0027t heard me. \"Hanging?\" She pauses. \"Are you okay?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, baby, I\u0027m fine, I\u0027m cool,\" I\u0027m saying, gesturing mindlessly. \"It looks like rain, huh, baby?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re white,\" she says. \"You look like you\u0027ve been... crying.\" She reaches out a hand to touch my face. Instinctively I pull away.\\n\\n \"No, no, no,\" I\u0027m saying. \"No, I haven\u0027t been crying. I\u0027m cool. I was just yawning. Things are cool.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she says, followed by a long pause.\\n\\n \"Whoa,\" I add to it.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" she asks.\\n\\n \"Well, baby, I\u0027m here with\"-I glance at Russell-\"my friend and we\u0027re...\" I land on, \"Well, I\u0027m taking French lessons from him.\"\\n\\n She just stares at me. Silence.\\n\\n \"You know, baby, I can\u0027t speak a word of it. So.\" I shrug.\\n\\n She\u0027s still staring at me. More silence.\\n\\n \"Not-one-word,\" I say stiffly.\\n\\n \"Right,\" she says, but now she\u0027s staring at Russell. \"You look totally familiar. Have we met?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Russell says. \"But maybe.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Jamie Fields,\" she says, holding out a hand.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Christian Bale,\" Russell says, taking it.\\n\\n \"Oh right,\" she says. \"Yeah, I thought I recognized you. You\u0027re the actor.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah.\" He\u0027s nodding boyishly. \"I recognized you too.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, looks like we\u0027re all famous, huh?\" I chuckle dreadfully. \"How about that, huh?\"\\n\\n \"I really liked you in Newsies and Swing Kids,\" Jamie says, not at all facetiously.\\n\\n \"Thanks, thanks.\" Russell keeps nodding.\\n\\n \"And also Hooked,\" Jamie says. \"You were great in Hooked.\"\\n\\n \"Oh thanks,\" Russell says, blushing, smiling on cue. \"That\u0027s so nice. That\u0027s so cool.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Hooked,\" Jamie murmurs, staring thoughtfully into Russell\u0027s face.\\n\\n A long pause follows. I concentrate on the film crew lifting a camera into the back of the van. The director nods at me. I don\u0027t nod back.\\n\\n From inside the van ABBA\u0027s \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" keeps playing, a reminder of something. I\u0027m squinting, trying to remember. The director starts moving toward us.\\n\\n \"So what are you doing in Paris?\" Jamie asks Russell.\\n\\n \"Oh, just hanging,\" Russell says confidently.\\n\\n \"And... teaching French?\" Jamie laughs, confused.\\n\\n \"Oh it\u0027s just a favor,\" I\u0027m saying, laughing with her. \"He\u0027s owing me a favor.\"\\n\\n Behind us, walking out of the front entrance of the apartment building on Avenue Verdier, are Palakon, Delta, Crater-all in overcoats and sunglasses-without the Japanese man. They maneuver past us, walking purposefully down the block, conferring with one another. Jamie barely notices them since she\u0027s preoccupied with staring at Russell. But the director stops walking toward me and stares at Palakon as he passes by, and something in the director\u0027s face tightens and he worriedly glances back at me and then once more at Palakon.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a favor,\" Russell says, putting on Diesel sunglasses. \"I\u0027m between roles. So it\u0027s cool.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s between roles,\" I\u0027m saying. \"He\u0027s waiting for a good part. One worthy of his skills.\"\\n\\n \"Listen, I gotta split,\" Russell says. \"I\u0027ll talk to you later, man. Nice meeting you, Jamie.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Jamie says tentatively. \"You too, Christian.\"\\n\\n \"Peace,\" he says, moving off. \"Victor, I\u0027ll be in touch. Au revoir.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah man,\" I say shakily. \"Bonjour, dude,\" I\u0027m saying. \"Oui, monsieur.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-188.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
