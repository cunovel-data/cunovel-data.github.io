Singular.\" The seventeen-year-old director moves over to the booth holding a walkie-talkie and he\u0027s wearing DKNY silver jeans and sunglasses and it\u0027s all kind of a glam combo. \"Chloe, we\u0027ve decided to shoot the first shot last.\" \"Taylor, I\u0027m desperately needed somewhere in less than an hour,\" Chloe pleads. \"It\u0027s a matter of life or death. Taylor, this is Victor.\" \"Hey,\" Taylor says. \"We met at Pravda last week.\" \"I wasn\u0027t at Pravda last week but oh what the hell, forget it-how\u0027s it going?\" \"The extras are cool kids but we want to portray a lifestyle that people can relate to,\" Taylor explains. I\u0027m nodding deeply. \"My vision is to create the opposite of whatever smuggling Pervitin back from Prague in a rented Toyota means.\" An interruption, static from the walkie-talkie, garbled screams from across the room. \"That\u0027s just Lars, the runner.\" Taylor winks. \"Taylor-\" Chloe starts. \"Baby, you will be whisked out of this room in less than thirty, I promise.\" Taylor moves back to the group surrounding the egg. \"God, my nerves are fraught,\" she says. \"What does that mean?\" \"It means it has taken a week to shoot this and we\u0027re three weeks behind schedule.\" Pause. \"No, what does `fraught\u0027 mean?\" \"It means I\u0027m tense. It means I\u0027m very tense.\" Finally: \"Baby, we gotta talk about something.\" \"Victor, I\u0027ve told you that if you need any money-\" \"No, no.\" Pause. \"Well, actually that too, but...\" \"What?\" She looks up at me, waiting. \"What is it, Victor?\" \"Baby, it\u0027s just that I\u0027m getting really, um, I\u0027m getting really nervous opening up magazines and reading about who your ideal man is.\" \"Why is that, Victor?\" She turns back to the mirror. \"Well, I guess the main reason is that\"-I glance over at La Tosh and lower my voice-\"it\u0027s like the total opposite of me?\" \"Oh, so what?\" She shrugs. \"I said I liked blonds.\" \"But baby, I\u0027m really a brunette.\" \"Victor, you read this in a magazine, for god\u0027s sake.\" \"Jesus, and all this shit about having kids.\" I\u0027m moving around now. \"Spare me, baby. What\u0027s the story? What\u0027s the megillah?\" \"You\u0027ll forgive me, Victor, if I have no idea what `megillah\u0027 means.\" \"Baby, I\u0027m your best friend, so why don\u0027t-\" \"A mirror\u0027s your best friend, Victor.\" \"Baby, it\u0027s just that...\" I trail off hopelessly. \"I... care about us and...\" \"Victor, what\u0027s wrong? What is it? Why are you doing this now?\" I recover slightly. \"Nothing, nothing. It\u0027s nothing.\" I\u0027m shaking my head, clearing it. \"I\u0027ve been holding an ice cube all day,\" Chloe says. \"Your fingers are turning blue and you\u0027ve been rolling around with Scott Benoit all day. Is that what you\u0027re saying?\" Music from a boom box, something British, Radiohead maybe, a ballad, lush and sad, plays over the scene. \"Victor, all I want to do, in the following order, is Todd\u0027s show, your opening and then collapse into bed, and I don\u0027t even wanna do two of those.\" \"Who\u0027s Baxter Priestly?\" I blurt out. \"He\u0027s a friend, Victor. A friend. My friend,\" she says. \"You should get to know some of them.\" I\u0027m about to take her hand but think better of it. \"I ran into one today. Lauren Hynde.\" I wait for a reaction but there isn\u0027t one. \"Yeah, I saw her before band practice when I was buying CDs at Tower Records. She seemed like really hostile.\" \"Buying CDs at Tower? Band practice? These are the essentials? You were swamped? What else did you do today? Visit a petting zoo? Take glass-blowing lessons?\" \"Hey baby, chill out. I met a friend of yours. That should soothe you-\" \"I\u0027m dating an imbecile and I should be soothed by this?\" A long pause, then, \"Baby, I\u0027m not an imbecile. You\u0027re very cool.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-51.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
