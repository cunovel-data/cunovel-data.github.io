Okay, what are we playing during cocktails?\" Beau asks as I start walking out the door.\\n\\n \"Start with something mellow. An Ennio Morricone soundtrack or Stereolab or even something ambient. Get the idea? Burt Bacharach.

I light a cigarette, then adjust a microphone that\u0027s hidden beneath the collar of my shirt.\\n\\n \"Hey, no smoking,\" the driver says.\\n\\n \"What are you gonna do? Just keep driving. Jesus.\"\\n\\n He sighs, keeps driving.\\n\\n Finally Buddy clicks on, sounds like accidentally.\\n\\n \"Buddy-Victor. What\u0027s the story?\"\\n\\n \"Confirm this rumor for me: Are you dating Stephen Dorff?\"\\n\\n \"Spare me, Buddy,\" I groan. \"Let\u0027s make a deal.\"\\n\\n \"Shoot,\" he sighs.\\n\\n I pause. \"Wait. I just, um, hope I\u0027m still not on your guys-I-wanna- f**k list.\"\\n\\n \"No, you already have a boyfriend.\"\\n\\n \"Stephen Dorff is not my goddamn boyfriend,\" I shout.\\n\\n The driver eyes me in the rearview mirror. I lean forward and bang on the back of his seat. \"Is there like a divider or partition or something that separates me from you?\" The driver shakes his head. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-36.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
