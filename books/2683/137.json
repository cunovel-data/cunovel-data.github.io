{"id":69324,"no":137,"title":"Page 137","content":"\"Yeah?\" \"I\u0027m supposed to pick him up around ten,\" Bobby says, moving closer, glancing at his watch. \"But I\u0027m totally beat.\" \"Man, you look great but\"-l c**k my head while searching his face for flaws-\"maybe a little tired.\" \"If I called a car for you, could you go to Pylos-\" \"Pylos? Hey, cool.\" \"-and pick him up for me?\" Bobby\u0027s standing so close I can feel his breath. \"I hate asking you but they\u0027re all fairly wasted.\" He gestures with his head at Tammy and Bruce and Bentley and Jamie, rolling around halfway behind the steel columns in front of the giantfv set, arguing over which video to watch. \"I noticed you didn\u0027t really drink tonight,\" Bobby says. \"So I\u0027m assuming that maybe you wouldn\u0027t mind going.\" \"Well, I\u0027m a little shaky from last night but-\" \"Yeah, last night,\" Bobby murmurs, momentarily far away. \"So where\u0027s this club?\" I ask quickly, redirecting him. \"The driver knows where it is,\" Bobby says. \"He\u0027ll wait outside Pylos with the car. just let the doorman know that you\u0027re my guest and Sam will be in the VIP room.\" \"Why don\u0027t you just put me on the guest list?\" \"Victor, this place is so fashionable you can\u0027t get in even if you\u0027re on the guest list.\" \"How will I know who Sam is?\" I ask hesitantly. \"He\u0027s Asian and small and his name is Sam Ho. Believe me, you\u0027ll know him when you see him,\" Bobby explains. \"He\u0027s a little, uh, theatrical.\" \"Okay, guy.\" I shrug, genuinely confused. \"Who is he?\" And then, \"Are you guys planning to party later?\" \"No, no-he doesn\u0027t deal drugs,\" Bobby says. \"Haven\u0027t you heard of Sam Ho?\" Bobby asks. \"He\u0027s a superfamous Asian model.\" \"Uh-huh, cool.\" I\u0027m nodding. \"Hey, don\u0027t worry,\" he says. \"It\u0027s not an improbable meeting. It\u0027s in the script.\" \"Oh, I know, I know,\" I say, trying to assure him. \"Here.\" Bobby hands me an envelope that I didn\u0027t notice he was holding. \"Give this to Sam. He\u0027ll know what it means. And then I\u0027ll see you guys back here.\" \"Cool, Cool.\" \"I hate like hell to do this, man, but I\u0027m just wiped out.\" \"Hey Bobby,\" I say, \"stop beating yourself up. I\u0027ll go. I\u0027ve been wanting to go to Pylos since it opened-what? Four weeks ago, right?\" \"It\u0027s sort of on again, off again.\" Bobby walks me outside into the misty night, where a black limousine waits at the curb and Felix has already set up the next shot. Bobby looks into my eyes. \"I really appreciate this, Victor.\" \"No, man, I\u0027m honored.\" \"Can we do that again?\" the director asks. \"Victor-put an emphasis on I\u0027m. Okay, go ahead-we\u0027re still rolling.\" Bobby looks into my eyes. \"I really appreciate this, Victor,\" he says with even more feeling. \"No, man, I\u0027m honored.\" \"You rule, man.\" \"No, man, you rule.\" \"Uh-uh. You rule, Victor.\" \"I can\u0027t believe that Bobby Hughes is telling me I rule,\" I gasp, pausing to take in a breath. \"No, you rule.\" Bobby hugs me and when he\u0027s about to step away I keep hugging, unable to stop. The driver moves in to open the passenger door and I recognize him as the guy who picked me up in Southampton (a scene that will be cut). He has red hair and seems cool. \"Hey Victor,\" Bobby calls before I get into the limo. \"Yeah, man?\" I ask, turning around. \"Do you speak French?\" he asks, just a shadow standing in the darkness outside the house. It takes me thirty seconds to form the words \"Un... petit peu.\" \"Good,\" he says, disappearing. \"Neither do any of us, really.\" And then the evening leads to its logical conclusion. 4 In the limo heading toward Charing Cross Road Everything But the Girl\u0027s \"Wrong\" plays while I\u0027m studying the small white envelope Bobby gave me to hand over to Sam Ho and there\u0027s the raised outline of a key folded inside a note but because I respect Bobby I don\u0027t even consider opening it and then it\u0027s 11 p.m. and the limo turns into a rainy alley where a sign reads DANCETERIA followed by a wobbly arrow that directs us to the back door of Pylos. Figures under umbrellas flock around a rope and behind that rope the proverbial \"big guy\"-this one wearing a Casely Hayford Chinese shirt, a Marie Antoinette wig and a black jacket with the words HELL BENT stitched over the heart in red-yells into a megaphone \"Nobody else is coming in!\" but then he spots me as I\u0027m jumping out of the limo and as I approach an empty space that opens up for me the bouncer leans in and I say \"I\u0027m a guest of Bobby Hughes.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-137.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
