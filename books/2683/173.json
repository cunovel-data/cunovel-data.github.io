{"id":69360,"no":173,"title":"Page 173","content":"The Christian Bale guy is leaning over, his hands on his knees, taking deep breaths.\n Everything suddenly seems displaced, subtle gradations erase borders, but it\u0027s more forceful than that.\n \"Palakon?\" I ask, slowly. \"Why was that hat so important?\"\n No answer.\n \"Why did Lauren Hynde give me that hat?\" I ask. \"Why is the hat so important, Palakon?\"\n \"Who says it is?\" Palakon asks, distracted, harassed, still pacing.\n \"Palakon,\" I sigh. \"I may be a lot of things, but stupid is not one of them.\" Finally I\u0027m so scared that I start breaking down. \"I need help. You\u0027ve got to get me out of here. I don\u0027t care about the money anymore. They\u0027ll kill me. I mean it, Palakon. They will kill me.\" Panicking, doubled over on the bed, I envision my corpse on a beach, someone\u0027s idea of a \"flourish,\" and there\u0027s a breeze, it\u0027s midday, a figure disappears into a cove. \"I shouldn\u0027t even be here-oh f**king god-I shouldn\u0027t even be here.\"\n \"You weren\u0027t followed,\" Palakon says. \"Please Mr. Ward, calm down.\"\n \"I can\u0027t,\" I\u0027m whining, still doubled over, clutching myself \"I can\u0027t, I cannot, I-\"\n \"Mr. Ward, is there anyone who can help you?\" Palakon asks. \"Anyone you can put us in touch with?\"\n \"No no no, there\u0027s no one-\"\n \"What about family? What about your parents? Maybe something can be arranged. Something monetary. Do they know where you are?\"\n \"No.\" I breathe in. \"My mother\u0027s dead. My father-I can\u0027t, I can\u0027t bring my father into this.\"\n Palakon suddenly stops pacing.\n \"Why not?\" Palakon asks. \"Maybe if you put us in touch with your father he could come over here and we could make an arrangement to somehow extract you from this mess-\"\n \"But, Palakon, what mess? What do you mean, a mess? And I can\u0027t can \u0027t get my father involved.\" I\u0027m shaking my head, weeping. \"No, no, I can\u0027t, no-\"\n \"Victor, why can\u0027t you get your father involved?\"\n \"Palakon, you don\u0027t understand,\" I\u0027m whispering.\n \"Mr. Ward, I\u0027m trying to help you-\"\n \"I can\u0027t I can\u0027t I-\"\n \"Mr. Ward-\" Palakon shouts.\n \"My father is a U.S. senator,\" I scream, glaring up at him. \"My father is a f**king U.S. senator. That is why he can\u0027t get involved, Palakon,\" I scream. \"Okay? Okay?\"\n Palakon swallows grimly, taking this in. Visibly alarmed, he closes his eyes, concentrating. Waves lap at the body on the beach and behind it hard brown surfers ride buoyantly over green swells below a burning sun high above the horizon and beyond them there\u0027s an island-boulders, woods, an old granite quarry, the smell of salt-and on that island another figure disappears into a cove and then it\u0027s night.\n \"Your father is Samuel Johnson?\" Palakon asks.\n \"Yes,\" I hiss, still glaring at him. \"Didn\u0027t you know this when you first contacted me?\"\n \"No, we didn\u0027t,\" Palakon says quietly, humbled. \"But now I\"-he clears his throat-\"see.\"\n \"No you don\u0027t,\" I\u0027m saying mindlessly, moving my head back and forth like a child. \"No you don\u0027t.\"\n \"Victor, you don\u0027t need to explain to me who your father is,\" Palakon says. \"I think I understand.\" He pauses again. \"And because of this I also understand why this makes the situation more... delicate.\"\n I start giggling. \"Delicate? The situation is delicate?\" I stop giggling, gasp in a sob.\n \"Victor, we can help you, I think-\"\n \"I\u0027m trapped, I\u0027m trapped, I\u0027m trapped, and they\u0027ll kill me-\"\n \"Mr. Ward,\" Palakon says, kneeling, leaning in to where I\u0027m sitting on the edge of the bed. \"Please, we will help you but-\"\n When I try to hug him he pushes me gently away.\n \"-you have got to act as if nothing has happened. You have got to pretend that you don\u0027t know anything. You\u0027ve got to play along until I can figure something out.\"\n \"No, no, no-\"\n Palakon motions for the Christian Bale guy. I feel a pair of hands on my shoulders. Someone\u0027s whispering.\n \"I\u0027m afraid, Palakon,\" I sob.\n \"Don\u0027t be, Mr. Ward,\" Palakon says. \"We know where you are. In the meantime I have to figure some things out. We\u0027ll contact you-\"\n \"You\u0027ve got to be careful,\" I say. \"Everything\u0027s bugged. Everything\u0027s wired. Everything\u0027s being filmed.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-173.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
