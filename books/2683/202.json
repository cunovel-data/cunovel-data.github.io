Don\u0027t tell me you don\u0027t know him.\"\n Palakon flinches. \"Mr. Ward, I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re talking about. But I have never met Bobby Hughes face-to-face.\"\n \"You\u0027re lying, you\u0027re f**king lying,\" I shout. \"Why are you lying, Palakon? I saw a videotape. You were shaking his hand.\" I\u0027m out of the chair again, stomping toward him.\n Palakon swallows grimly, then launches into, \"Mr. Ward, as you well know, they are quite sophisticated at altering photographs and videotapes.\" Palakon stops, starts again. \"What you probably saw was just a movie. A special effect. just a strip of film that was digitally altered. Why they showed this to you I don\u0027t know. But I have never met Bobby Hughes before-\"\n \"Blah blah blah,\" I\u0027m screaming. \"What a load of shit. No way, man.\" There\u0027s so much adrenaline rushing through me that I\u0027m shaking violently.\n \"Mr. Ward, I think you have been a victim of this as well,\" Palakon adds.\n \"So you\u0027re telling me we can\u0027t believe anything we\u0027re shown any more?\" I\u0027m asking. \"That everything is altered? That everything\u0027s a lie? That everyone will believe this?\"\n \"That\u0027s a fact,\" Palakon says.\n \"So what\u0027s true, then?\" I cry out.\n \"Nothing, Victor,\" Palakon says. \"There are different truths.\"\n \"Then what happens to us?\"\n \"We change.\" He shrugs. \"We adapt.\"\n \"To what? Better? Worse?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure those terms are applicable anymore.\"\n \"Why not?\" I shout. \"Why aren\u0027t they?\"\n \"Because no one cares about \u0027better.\u0027 No one cares about \u0027worse,\"\u0027 Palakon says. \"Not anymore. It\u0027s different now.\"\n Someone clears his throat as tears pour down my face.\n \"Mr. Ward, please, you\u0027ve helped us enormously,\" Crater says.\n \"How?\" I sob.\n \"Because of that printout you gave to Palakon, we believe that Bobby Hughes is using the Remform in a bombing this week,\" Crater explains. \"A bombing that we now have the power to stop.\"\n I mumble something, looking away.\n \"We think this has to do with a bombing scheduled for Friday,\" Palakon says matter-of-factly. \"That date is November 15. We think \u00271985\u0027 is actually a misprint. We think the 8 is actually an O.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"We think 1985 is actually 1905,\" Crater says. \"In military parlance that\u0027s 7:05 p.m.\"\n \"Yeah?\" I mutter. \"So?\"\n \"There\u0027s a TWA flight leaving Charles de Gaulle this Friday, November 15, at 7:05,\" Palakon says.\n \"So what?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Aren\u0027t there a lot of flights leaving on that date, near that time?\"\n \"Its flight number is 511,\" Palakon says.\n 9\n I\u0027m told to stay calm.\n I\u0027m told they will contact me tomorrow.\n I\u0027m told to return to the house in the 8th or the 16th and pretend nothing has happened.\n I\u0027m told that I can be placed, eventually, in a witness protection program. (I\u0027m told this after I have collapsed on the floor, sobbing hysterically.)\n I\u0027m told again to stay calm.\n On the verge of trust, I realize that the inspector from Interpol is the actor who played the clerk at the security office on the QE2.\n I\u0027m told, \"We\u0027ll be in touch, Mr. Ward.\"\n I\u0027m told, \"You\u0027ll be watched.\"\n \"I know,\" I say hollowly.\n Since I have no more Xanax left and it\u0027s starting to rain I head over to Hotel Costes, where I wait in the cafe pretending to be pensive, drinking tea, smoking Camel Lights out of a pack someone left discarded at the table next to mine, until Chloe walks in with a famous ballerina, a well-known former junkie just out of rehab and Aphex Twin, and they all start chatting pleasantly with Griffin Dunne, who\u0027s standing at the front desk, and then everyone but Chloe walks away and in a trance I move forward while she checks her messages and I grab her, embracing her fearfully while glancing around the hushed lobby and then I\u0027m kissing her lips, entering her life again, and we\u0027re both crying. The concierge turns his head away.\n I start relaxing but a film crew has followed Chloe into the lobby and a camera starts panning around us and we\u0027re asked to \"do that\" once more. Someone yells \"Action.\" Someone yells \"Cut.\" I stop crying and we do it again. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-202.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
