Then, quite suavely, \"Though of course, why not?\"\\n\\n \"Oh...\" She pauses, looks at all that boring black water. \"Let\u0027s just say certain individuals weren\u0027t sticking to the plan and leave it at that.\"\\n\\n I immediately sense boyfriend troubles and pounce gingerly. \"What\u0027s his name?\" I ask softly.\\n\\n \"Gavin,\" she says, a bit perturbed but still smiling.\\n\\n I make a face, mock-shiver. \"Ooh, I don\u0027t trust anyone named Gavin.\" I make another face, grimacing, holding the expression until she notices, then ask casually, \"Where\u0027s Gavin now?\"\\n\\n \"Gavin plans to run with the bulls in Pamplona,\" she says dryly.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a basketball player?\" I ask, wilting. \"I thought the Bulls were in Chicago.\"\\n\\n She just stares at me, a flicker of panic creasing her features. Suddenly the g*y German youth bounds down the stairs onto the pool deck, wearing a Garth Brooks tour T-shirt and giant black Nikes. He spots me and starts bounding over. I immediately feign sleep. Soon I feel a shadow cross my face and linger, followed by the sounds of footsteps bounding away. When I feel enough time has passed I open my eyes. Countless Japanese splash around in the pool. The noon whistle goes off. Elderly report: they\u0027re everywhere.\\n\\n \"Someone just... inspected you,\" Marina says.\\n\\n \"Just a fan. A hanger-on,\" I shrug. \"It\u0027s tough but I\u0027m used to it. So what do you do?\"\\n\\n \"I model,\" she says simply. \"Part time.\"\\n\\n I sit up, swing my legs across the chaise, then realize the move is a little too urgent and reach for the light beer instead.\\n\\n \"But just a little bit,\" she adds, noticing. \"Just here and there.\"\\n\\n \"Baby, that is so cool,\" I\u0027m saying. \"I knew you were a model. I knew you were recognizable.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m not Chloe Byrnes but I do okay.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Chloe...,\" I say \"wistfully.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry,\" Marina says and then-when I fail to say anything else-adds, \"Anyway, I\u0027m off to visit friends and do, oh, touristy things.\"\\n\\n Chapter Ten\\n\\n \"Hey, roam if you want to. That\u0027s my motto, baby.\"\\n\\n \"So why are you sailing?\" she asks. \"Afraid to fly?\" \"I saw The Poseidon Adventure twenty times as a small, frightened child,\" I explain. \"My favorite line in movies is \u0027My God-it\u0027s a giant wall of water, heading straight for us.\"\u0027\\n\\n A long pause on Marina\u0027s part that I\u0027m responsible for, and then, \"That\u0027s... your answer?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to London, babe,\" I say quickly. \"I\u0027m looking for a friend.\" I realize something, my eyes gliding over her body, and add, \"But I\u0027m in no hurry.\"\\n\\n \"So why do you have to find this friend?\"\\n\\n \"Off the record? It\u0027s a long story.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not going anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I was about to host this MTV show-\"\\n\\n \"Oh really?\" she asks, repositioning herself on the chaise. \"About what?\"\\n\\n Without stalling: \"Well, it was just going to be about me. My life, y\u0027know, what I do during an average day.\"\\n\\n \"I... see,\" she says, somewhat contemplatively.\\n\\n \"And the whole modeling grind was getting me down and being quasi-famous was just getting too overwhelming so\"-I breathe in for emphasis -\"I decided to chuck it all and I thought, man, Europe\u0027s not that far away. But I didn\u0027t really want to participate in that whole Prague scene. I didn\u0027t want to sit in a moldy cafe with my PowerBook and deal with chicks from RISD. I just wanted to write some poetry and, y\u0027know, make some videos... get away from that whole cyberspace scene. Just chill out... Get back to my roots. Gotta get back, back to my roots.\" I sip the light beer confidently. \"Come back down to earth and get back to my roots.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-99.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
