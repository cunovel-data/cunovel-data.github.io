Gold-rimmed plates are placed in front of us as a tin of Beluga is wheeled toward the table. While the maitre d\u0027arranges the caviar on our respective plates and I\u0027m babbling on about the new design-not the old design but the new design-of Raygun magazine, a photographer who has been combing the room interrupts us by askng if we\u0027d like our picture taken.\\n\\n Great idea,\" I say too loudly, clapping my hands together.\\n\\n \"No, no,\" the Wallaces insist, shaking their heads.\\n\\n \"Perhaps after dinner,\" Lorrie says.\\n\\n \"Oh come on,\" I say, turning to Marina. \"It\u0027ll be like a souvenir.\"\\n\\n \"Victor, no,\" Marina says. \"Not right now.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Victor,\" Stephen says. \"Perhaps later.\"\\n\\n The photographer crouches at the table, waiting for a decision.\\n\\n \"Well, damnit,\" I say. \"Come on, guys. Oh, just take it,\" I tell the photographer. \"Just do it.\"\\n\\n \"Victor, please,\" the Wallaces say in unison.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not feeling very photogenic right now,\" Marina adds improbably.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m camera-ready, babies,\" I exclaim. \"Go for it, dude.\"\\n\\n Just as the flash goes off I try to lean into Marina, who backs slightly away toward the maitre d\u0027, who has stepped aside, waiting patiently to continue serving the caviar.\\n\\n The Wallaces glare at me sternly while I give the photographer my name and cabin number and ask for four copies. As he walks away, the captain announces over the intercom that the QE2 will be stopping in a matter of minutes and to please stay seated, that there\u0027s really no need to get up since the fog will probably obliterate the view and we\u0027ll be moving again shortly. But most of the hoi polloi in the Queen\u0027s Grill ignore the captain\u0027s suggestion and drift from their tables to the starboard side, including-thankfully-the Wallaces, though it just seems like an excuse to confer with the director. The maitre d\u0027 finishes serving the caviar and moves away. I\u0027m pouring myself a glass of white wine from one of the carafes when Marina touches my shoulder.\\n\\n \"Victor,\" she says.\\n\\n \"I think they\u0027re mad at me,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t think they liked having their picture taken. The f**king English, y\u0027know? Jesus Christ. I mean, I know that you and I are used to it, but-\"\\n\\n \"Victor,\" she says again.\\n\\n \"I know, I know, I\u0027m sorry,\" I say. \"But baby, you look gorgeous.\"\\n\\n \"Victor, you\u0027re drunk,\" she says.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re gorgeous-\"\\n\\n \"Victor, I have to talk to you.\"\\n\\n \"And I have to talk to you, baby.\" I grab her hand beneath the table.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m serious,\" she says, pulling away.\\n\\n \"And so am I,\" I say, leaning toward her.\\n\\n \"Victor, stop it,\" she says. \"You have got to sober up.\"\\n\\n \"Baby, you\u0027re-\"\\n\\n \"I have to leave,\" she says, glancing over at the Wallaces. \"Call me when you\u0027re through with dinner.\"\\n\\n \"No-no-no-no,\" I say, immediately sobering up. \"No way, baby. You\u0027ve got to stay. Don\u0027t leave me with-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m leaving and you\u0027re calling me in my cabin when you\u0027re through with dinner,\" Marina explains patiently.\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t I come with you?\" I ask. \"What\u0027s the story? What\u0027s wrong?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-109.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
