Even in New York... that girl who died... that DJ...\" \"Mica?\" I ask. \"Whoever... you went to meet at Fashion Cafe... for a new DJ. Do you remember?\" I nod dumbly even though she\u0027s not looking. \"She was killed the night before... I saw a report.\" \"Oh Jesus oh Jesus.\" \"It was all a setup.\" \"Whose side are you on, Jamie?\" I\u0027m asking. She smiles and when she smiles her upper lip splits open but there\u0027s no blood. \"Who do you work for?\" \"It... hardly matters... now.\" \"Who did you work for?\" I scream, shaking her. \"I was working against... Bobby,\" she mutters. \"To do that, Victor... I had to work for him.\" I pull back, panting. \"I worked for the group... Marina worked for... and I worked for the group Bobby worked for... and I worked for Palakon... just like you do-\" \"I don\u0027t work for Palakon.\" \"Yes... you do.\" She swallows again with great difficulty. \"You have... ever since you met him.\" She starts shivering. \"Jamie, how\u0027s Lauren Hynde involved in all this?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Look at me-how\u0027s Lauren Hynde involved? She gave me the hat. I\u0027ve seen pictures of her with Bobby.\" Jamie starts laughing, delirious. \"You remember Lauren Hynde from Camden, right?\" I say. \"She knows Bobby. She gave me the hat.\" I pull Jamie closer to my face. \"They set me up with her, didn\u0027t they?\" \"That wasn\u0027t... Lauren Hynde, Victor.\" Jamie sighs. \"It was Lauren Hynde,\" I say. \"It was, Jamie.\" \"You didn\u0027t pay... attention.\" She sighs again. \"That girl was not Lauren-\" \"Jamie, I know that girl,\" I say. \"She\u0027s Chloe\u0027s best friend. What are you saying?\" \"That was someone else.\" Jamie keeps sighing. \"No, no, no...\" I\u0027m shaking my head adamantly. \"Lauren Hynde died in... December 1985... in a car accident... outside Camden, New Hampshire.\" She leans into me, lowering her voice, almost as if she\u0027s afraid someone is listening, and I\u0027m thinking, She\u0027s just a shell, and something huge and shapeless is flying over us in the, darkness, hanging above the courtyard, and a voice says, You all are. \"I\u0027ve gotta talk to Bobby,\" I gasp. \"Where\u0027s Bobby?\" \"No, Victor, don\u0027t-\" \"Where did he go, Jamie? Tell me.\" \"He went to-\" She gasps, rolls her head back. \"He was on his way to...\" She trails off. \"Where is he?\" I scream, shaking her. \"He... went to Hotel Costes,\" she gasps. \"To see... Chloe.\" I stand up and start moaning, the wind stinging my face, and Jamie\u0027s saying \"Wait, wait, don\u0027t\" and holding on to my arm, gripping it, but I yank it away. \"Victor...\" \"I\u0027m leaving.\" Panic bursts through me, spreading \"What do you want, Jamie?\" She says something I can\u0027t hear. Hurriedly I lean in. \"What is it?\" She mumbles something. \"I can\u0027t hear you, Jamie,\" I whisper. Her last words as she drifts off. \"I\u0027m... not... Jamie Fields,\" is all she says. And on cue a giant eruption of flies swarm into the courtyard in one massive black cloud. 4 I run back to the hotel. I burst through the entrance doors and force myself to walk calmly through the lobby and into an elevator. Once I reach Chloe\u0027s floor I race down the hallway. I start pounding on her door. \"Chloe? Chloe-are you okay?\" I\u0027m calling out, my voice high and girlish. \"Open up. Chloe? It\u0027s me.\" The door opens and Chloe stands there, smiling, wearing a white robe. \"You changed,\" she says, glancing at Bobby\u0027s clothes. \"Where\u0027s your stuff?\" I push past her and shamble into the room, running through the suite, panicked, not knowing what I\u0027d do if I found him here.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-211.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
