You\u0027re a mess.\"\n \"I\u0027m just... I\u0027m just so afraid,\" I sob. \"I\u0027m afraid of losing you again... and I want to make you understand that... I want to fix things...\"\n Her sadness creases the features of her face, making it look as if she\u0027s concentrating on something.\n \"We can\u0027t go back,\" she says. \"Really, Victor.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to go back,\" I\u0027m saying.\n \"A smart suit,\" she sighs. \"Being buff. A cool haircut. Worrying about whether people think you\u0027re famous enough or cool enough or in good enough shape or... or whatever.\" She sighs, gives up, stares at the ceiling. \"These are not signs of wisdom, Victor,\" she says. \"This is the bad planet.\"\n \"Yeah,\" I say. \"Yeah, baby... I think I was paying too much attention to the way things looked, right? I know, baby, I know.\"\n \"It happens.\" She shrugs. \"You have the standard regrets.\"\n I start crying again. Chloe\u0027s asking \"Why?\" She touches my arm. She\u0027s asking \"Why?\" again.\n \"But I can\u0027t find anything else... to put in its place,\" I say, choking.\n \"Baby-\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you just dump me?\" I sob.\n \"Because I\u0027d fallen in love with you,\" she says.\n My eyes are closed and I can hear her turning pages and Chloe breathes in as she delivers the following line (\"warmly w/affection\"): \"Because I still am in love with you.\"\n I pull away, wiping my face blindly.\n \"There are so many things I want to tell you.\"\n \"You can,\" she says. \"I\u0027ll listen. You can.\"\n My eyes fill up with tears again and this time I want her to see them.\n \"Victor,\" she says. \"Oh baby. Don\u0027t cry or you\u0027re gonna make me cry.\n \"Baby,\" I start. \"Things aren\u0027t the way... you might think they are...\"\n \"Shhh, it\u0027s okay,\" she says.\n \"But it\u0027s not,\" I say. \"It\u0027s so not okay, it\u0027s not.\"\n \"Victor, come on-\"\n \"But I plan to stick around a little while,\" I say in a rush before bursting into tears again.\n I\u0027m closing my eyes and she stirs lightly on the bed, turning pages in the script, and she keeps pausing, deciding whether to say something or not, and I\u0027m saying, clearing my throat, my nose hopelessly stuffed, \"Don\u0027t, baby, don\u0027t, just put it away,\" and Chloe sighs and I hear her drop the script onto the floor next to the bed we\u0027re lying on and then she\u0027s holding my face in her hands and I\u0027m opening my eyes.\n \"Victor,\" she says.\n \"What?\" I\u0027m asking. \"What is it, baby?\"\n \"Victor?\"\n \"Yeah?\"\n Finally she says, \"I\u0027m pregnant.\"\n A problem. Things get sketchy. We skipped a stage. I missed a lesson, we moved backward, we disappeared into a valley, a place where it\u0027s always January, where the air is thin and I\u0027m pulling a Coca-Cola out of a bucket of ice. The words \"I\u0027m pregnant\" sounded harsh to me but in an obscure way. I\u0027m in the center of the room, flattened out by this information and what it demands from me. I keep trying to form a sentence, make a promise, not wander away. She\u0027s asking are you coming in? I\u0027m telling myself you always took more than you gave, Victor. I keep trying to postpone the next moment but she\u0027s staring at me attentively, almost impatient.\n \"And yes, it\u0027s yours,\" she says.\n Because of how startled I am, all I can ask is, \"Can you, like, afford to do this now?\" My voice sounds falsetto.\n \"It\u0027s not like I\u0027ve been underpaid,\" she says, gesturing around the suite. \"It\u0027s lot like I can\u0027t retire. That\u0027s not an issue.\"\n \"What is?\" I ask, swallowing.\n \"Where you\u0027re going to be,\" she says quietly. \"What role you\u0027re going to take in this.\"\n \"How do you... know it\u0027s mine?\" I ask.\n She sighs. \"Because the only person I\u0027ve been with since we broke up\"-she laughs derisively-\"is you.\"\n \"What do you mean?\" I ask. \"What about Baxter?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-204.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
