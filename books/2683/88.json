We\u0027ve taken care of Burl, and JD\u0027s been fired too. He\u0027ll actually never work anywhere in Manhattan again because of his unfortunate association with you.\" \"Damien, hey,\" I say softly. \"Come on, man, JD didn\u0027t do anything.\" \"He has AIDS,\" Damien says, slipping on a pair of black leather gloves. \"He\u0027s not going to be around much longer anyway.\" I just stare at Damien, who notices. \"It\u0027s a blood disease,\" he says. \"It\u0027s some kind of virus. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard of it.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" I say uncertainly. \"Baxter Priestly\u0027s with me now,\" Damien says, getting ready to make an exit. \"It somehow seems...\" He searches for the right word, cocks his head, comes up with \"appropriate.\" Juan shrugs at me as he follows Damien and the goons out of the club and I pick up one of the photographs of Lauren and me and turn it over as if there might be some kind of explanation for its existence on the back but it\u0027s blank and I\u0027m drained, my head spinning, swearing \"fuck f**k f**k\" as I move over to a dusty sink behind what would have been the bar and I\u0027m waiting for the director to shout \"Cut\" but the only sounds I\u0027m hearing are Damien\u0027s limo screeching out of TriBeCa, my feet crunching what\u0027s left of the mirror ball, sleigh bells not in the shooting script, a buzzing fly circling my head which I\u0027m too tired to wave away. 4 I\u0027m standing at a pay phone on Houston Street, three blocks from Lauren\u0027s apartment. Extras walk by, looking stiff and poorly directed. A limousine cruises toward Broadway. I\u0027m crunching on a Mentos. \"Hey pu**ycat, it\u0027s me,\" I say. \"I need to see you.\" \"That\u0027s not possible,\" she says, and then less surely, \"Who is this?\" \"I\u0027m coming over.\" \"I won\u0027t be here.\" \"Why not?\" \"I\u0027m going to Miami with Damien.\" She adds, \"In about an hour. I\u0027m packing.\" \"What happened to Alison?\" I ask. \"What happened to his fiancee?\" I spit out. \"Huh, Lauren?\" \"Damien dumped Alison and she\u0027s put a contract out on his head,\" she says casually. \"If you can believe that, which I actually can.\" While I\u0027m processing this information the cameraman keeps circling the pay phone, distracting me into forgetting my lines, so I decide to improvise and surprisingly the director allows it. \"What about... what about when you get back, baby?\" I ask hesitantly. \"I\u0027m going on location,\" she says, very matter-of-fact. \"To Burbank.\" \"For what?\" I\u0027m asking, covering my eyes with my hand. \"I\u0027m playing the squealing genie in Disney\u0027s new live-action feature Aladdin Meets Roger Rabbit, which is being directed by-oh, what\u0027s his name?-oh yeah, Cookie Pizarro.\" She pauses. \"CAA thinks it\u0027s my big break.\" I\u0027m stuck. \"Give Cookie my, um, best,\" and then I sigh. \"I really want to come over.\" \"You can\u0027t, honey,\" she says sweetly. \"You\u0027re impossible,\" I say through clenched teeth. \"Then why don\u0027t you come meet me?\" \"Where are you?\" \"In a big deluxe suite at the SoHo Grand.\" \"Well, that sounds like neutral ground, but no.\" \"Lauren -what about last night?\" \"My opinion?\" A very long pause that I\u0027m about to break when I remember my line, but she speaks first. \"My opinion is: I guess you shouldn\u0027t expect too much from people. My opinion is: You\u0027re busted and you did it to yourself.\" \"I\u0027ve been... I\u0027ve been under... a lot of pressure, baby,\" I\u0027m saying, trying not to break down. \"I... stumbled.\" \"No, Victor,\" she says curtly. \"You fell.\" \"You sound pretty casual, huh, baby?\" \"That\u0027s what people sound like when they don\u0027t care anymore, Victor,\" she says. \"I\u0027m surprised it doesn\u0027t sound more familiar to you.\" Pause. \"There\u0027s nothing, um, very encouraging about that answer, baby.\" \"You sound like your tongue\u0027s pierced,\" she says tiredly. \"And you exude glamour and, um, radiance... even over the phone,\" I mumble, feeding another quarter into the slot. \"See, Victor, the problem is you\u0027ve got to know things,\" she says. \"But you don\u0027t.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-88.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
