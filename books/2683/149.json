You don\u0027t love Bobby. It\u0027s a job, right? It\u0027s part of the plan, right? You\u0027re just acting, right?\"\\n\\n She says nothing.\\n\\n Bobby parts a green velvet curtain and walks in wearing a dazzling Valentino tuxedo with a Prada backpack strapped over his shoulders that he didn\u0027t check and he surveys the room while lighting a cigarette, briefly blinded by paparazzi, and he just came from a party at Anahi and his hair looks wet and he starts moving toward us, grinning tightly as he strides across the dance floor.\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027re afraid of him,\" I say. \"But you don\u0027t love him.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s just get through this week, okay?\u0027 she says, tensing up.\\n\\n \"Tell me you love him-say it,\" I whisper. \"Tell me you even like him.\"\\n\\n The camera suddenly stops circling, holding us both in the frame tightly while we stare helplessly as Bobby comes nearer.\\n\\n \"Be quiet,\" she says, nodding at someone passing by in the shadows.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say something to him,\" I whisper. \"I don\u0027t care.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s lower the volume, Victor,\" she warns, smiling widely.\\n\\n \"I hope that\u0027s a humorous reference to something I didn\u0027t hear you say, Victor,\" Bobby says, leaning in and kissing Jamie on the mouth.\\n\\n \"Mmm,\" Jamie purrs, tasting her lips. \"Margarita?\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about, Bobby?\" I deliver the line in such a way that it\u0027s impossible to tell whether I\u0027m feigning innocence or acting hard but Bobby\u0027s distracted by something across the room and in a suave way doesn\u0027t seem to care.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m starving,\" Jamie says.\\n\\n \"What?\" Bobby murmurs, craning his neck.\\n\\n \"I said I\u0027m starving,\" she repeats anxiously.\\n\\n Vaguely panicked, I swallow another Xanax and focus on an MTV crew interviewing Nicole Kidman, who has a bindi on her forehead.\\n\\n \"Rhinebeck is in a rotten mood,\" Bobby says, staring over at Bruce slouched stony-faced in a booth on the outer limits of the party with Tammy beside him, gorgeous and shell-shocked, wearing sunglasses, both of them surrounded by a smattering of young Londoners.\\n\\n \"I think he\u0027ll be okay,\" Jamie says. \"It\u0027ll be over soon.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but Tammy\u0027s getting damaged and that could screw things up,\" Bobby says. \"Excuse me.\"\\n\\n Bobby walks over to the booth, shaking hands with everyone who\u0027s impressed by his presence, and when he leans in, Bruce barely registers him and then Bentley strolls over with Marc Jacobs and finally Tammy looks up at Bentley as he shows her the watch he\u0027s wearing and she smiles briefly at Marc but the moment the entire booth bursts into cackling her face becomes a mask.\\n\\n \"Talk to him,\" I\u0027m telling Jamie. \"Tell him it\u0027s over between you two. Tell him it\u0027ll be okay.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be okay?\" she asks. \"You dummy,\" she mutters.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just trying to articulate how I\u0027m really feeling.\"\\n\\n \"Your primary responsibility, Victor, at this juncture, is to just-\"\\n\\n \"Shut up,\" I say softly.\\n\\n \"Get over me.\"\\n\\n \"You started this.\"\\n\\n \"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\" Jamie says, and then she can\u0027t help it-her face relaxes and glancing over at me her eyes acknowledge mine and she whispers quickly, \"Please, Victor, just act low-key and we\u0027ll talk later.\"\\n\\n \"When?\" I whisper back.\\n\\n Bobby returns with Bentley and Marc Jacobs and Marc and Bentley just got back from checking out Marc\u0027s headquarters at the Pont Neuf and Marc\u0027s very nervous because one of the new hot designers is a teenage drag queen who gets his inspiration from a Chihuahua named Hector.\\n\\n \"I was trapped in a conversation with a Belgian iconoclast and Mr. Jacobs here saved me,\" Bentley says, waving a fly away.\\n\\n Marc bows and then kisses Jamie on the cheek, nonchalantly nods my way and says, \"Hey, Victor.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, it\u0027s freezing in here,\" Bentley says, his breath steaming, and then, eyeing me, adds, \"You\u0027re looking tired, Victor. Gorgeous but t red.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m cool, I\u0027m cool,\" I say evenly. \"Everything\u0027s cool.\"\\n\\n \"Here-you forgot this.\" Bobby hands Bentley the Prada backpack while Marc charms Jamie by making goofy faces behind Bentley\u0027s back, causing even Bobby to crack half a smile. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-149.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
