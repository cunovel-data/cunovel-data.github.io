I\u0027m a legend. But in reality everything\u0027s a big world party and there are no VIP rooms.\"\\n\\n MTV (pause, confusion): \"But aren\u0027t there three VIP rooms at your new club?\"\\n\\n ME: \"Um... cut. Cut. Cut.\"\\n\\n Everyone huddles together and I explain the game plan-that I want to discuss my personal relationships with Robert Downey, Jr., Jennifer Aniston, Matt Dillon, Madonna, Latouse LaTrek and Dodi Fayed-and people finally nod, satisfied. Life moves on with a few soft-lob inquiries and a chance to be fashionably rude, which I grab.\\n\\n MTV: \"How was it guest-starring on \u0027Beverly Hills 90210\u0027?\"\\n\\n ME: \"A classic cliche. Luke Perry looks like a little Nosferatu and Jason Priestley is a caterpillar.\"\\n\\n MTV: \"Do you see yourself as a symbol of a new generation in America?\"\\n\\n ME: \"Well, I represent a pretty big pie-wedge of the new generation. I\u0027m maybe a symbol.\" Pause. \"An icon? No.\" Longer pause. \"Not yet.\" Long pause. \"Have I mentioned that I\u0027m a Capricorn? Oh yeah, and I\u0027m also for regaining the incentive to get this generation more involved in environmental issues.\"\\n\\n MTV: \"That\u0027s so cool.\"\\n\\n ME: \"No, you\u0027re so cool, dude.\"\\n\\n MTV. \"But what do you picture when you envision your generation?\"\\n\\n ME: \"At its worst? Two hundred dead-ass kids dressed like extras from The Crow dancing to C+C Music Factory.\"\\n\\n MTV: \"And what do you think about this?\"\\n\\n ME (genuinely moved to be asked): \"It stresses me out.\"\\n\\n MTV: \"But aren\u0027t the 1980s over? Don\u0027t you think opening a club like this is a throwback to an era most people want to forget? Don\u0027t kids want less opulence?\"\\n\\n ME: \"Hey, this is a personal vision, man.\" Pause. \"No matter how commercial it, y\u0027know, feels. And\"-finally realizing something-\"I just want to give something back to the community.\" Pause. \"I do it for the people.\" Pause. \"Man.\"\\n\\n MTV: \"What are your thoughts on fashion?\"\\n\\n ME: \"Fashion may be about insecurity but fashion is a good way to relieve tension.\"\\n\\n MTV (pause): \"Really?\"\\n\\n ME: \"I\u0027m completely absorbed by fashion. I seek it. I crave it. Seven days a week, twenty-eight hours a day. Did I mention that I\u0027m a Capricorn? Oh, and yeah-being the best at only one thing is counterproductive.\"\\n\\n MTV (long pause, mild confusion): \"You and Chloe Byrnes have been together how long now?\"\\n\\n ME: \"Time is meaningless when it comes down to Chloe. She defies time, man. I hope she has a long-term career as an actress-slash-model. She\u0027s gorgeous and, er, is my... best friend.\"\\n\\n (Sounds of Details reporter laughing.)\\n\\n Chapter Eight\\n\\n MTV. \"There have been rumors that-\"\\n\\n ME: \"Hey, maintaining a relationship is one of the difficulties of my job, babe.\"\\n\\n MTV: \"Where did you meet?\"\\n\\n ME: \"At a pre-Grammy dinner.\"\\n\\n MTV. \"What did you say when you met?\"\\n\\n ME: \"I said `Hey pu**ycat\u0027 and then that I was-and still am-an aspiring male model of the year.\"\\n\\n MTV (after longish pause): \"I can tell that you were in a, um, reflective mood that evening.\"\\n\\n ME: \"Hey, success is loving yourself, and anyone who doesn\u0027t think so can f**k off.\"\\n\\n MTV: \"How old are you?\"\\n\\n ME: \"Twentysomething.\"\\n\\n MTV: \"No, really. Exact.\"\\n\\n ME: \"Twen-ty-something.\"\\n\\n MTV: \"What really pisses Victor Ward off?\"\\n\\n ME: \"The fact that David Byrne named his new album after a \u0027tea from Sri Lanka that\u0027s sold in Britain.\u0027 I swear to God I heard that somewhere and it drove me nuts.\"\\n\\n MTV (after polite laughter): \"No. What really makes you mad? What really gets you angry?\"\\n\\n ME (long pause, thinking): \"Well, recently, missing DJs, badly behaved bartenders, certain gossipy male models, the media\u0027s treatment of celebs... um...\"\\n\\n MTV: \"We were thinking more along the lines of the war in Bosnia or the AIDS epidemic or domestic terrorism. How about the current political situation?\"\\n\\n ME (long pause, tiny voice): \"Sloppy Rollerbladers?... The words \u0027dot com\u0027?...\"\\n\\n MTV (long pause): \"Anything else?\"\\n\\n ME (realizing something, relieved): \"A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-71.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
