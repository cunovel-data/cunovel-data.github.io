Ready for tomorrow?\"\\n\\n \"Do you have the time to listen to me whine?\"\\n\\n We sit there sort of looking out over the rest of the room, my eyes fixed on the big table in the center, beneath a chandelier made of toilet floats and recycled refrigerator wire, where Eric Bogosian, Jim Jarmusch, Larry Gagosian, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and oddly enough, Ricki Lake are all having salads, which touches something in me, a reminder to deal with the crouton situation before it gets totally out of hand.\\n\\n Finally sensing my vibe, Baxter gets up, pockets his Audiovox MVX cell phone, which is sitting next to Chloe\u0027s Ericsson DF, and clumsily shakes my hand again.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you guys tomorrow.\" He lingers, removes the peppermint from full pink lips. \"Until then, um, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Bye, Baxter,\" Chloe says, tired but sweet, as usual.\\n\\n \"Yeah, bye, man,\" I mutter, a well-practiced dismissal, and once he\u0027s barely out of earshot I delicately ask, \"What\u0027s the story, baby? Who was that?\"\\n\\n She doesn\u0027t answer, just glares at me.\\n\\n Pause. \"Hey, honey, you\u0027re looking at me like I\u0027m at a Hootie and the Blowfish concert. Chill.\"\\n\\n \"Baxter Priestly?\" she says-asks morosely, picking at a plate of cilantro.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s Baxter Priestly?\" I pull out some excellent weed and a package of rolling papers. \"Who the f**k is Baxter Priestly?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in the new Darren Star show and plays bass in the band Hey That\u0027s My Shoe,\" she says, lighting another cigarette.\\n\\n \"Baxter Priestly? What the f**k kind of name is that?\" I mutter, spotting seeds that cry out for removal.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re complaining about someone\u0027s name? You hang out with Plez and Fetish and a person whose parents actually named him Tomato-\"\\n\\n \"They conceded it might have been a mistake.\"\\n\\n \"-and you do business with people named Benny Benny and Damien Nutchs Ross? And you haven\u0027t apologized for being an hour late? I had to wait upstairs in Eric\u0027s office.\"\\n\\n \"Oh god, I bet he loved that,\" I moan, concentrating on the pot.\\n\\n \"Hell, baby, I thought I\u0027d let you entertain the paparazzi.\" Pause. \"And that\u0027s Kenny Kenny, honey.\"\\n\\n \"I did that all day,\" she sighs.\\n\\n \"Baxter Priestly? Why am I drawing a blank?\" I ask earnestly, waving down Cliff the maitre d\u0027 for a drink but it\u0027s too late: Eric has already sent over a complimentary bottle of Cristal 1985.\\n\\n \"I guess I\u0027m used to your oblivion, Victor,\" she says.\\n\\n \"Chloe. You do fur ads and donate money to Greenpeace. You\u0027re what\u0027s known as a bundle of contradictions, baby, not this guy.\"\\n\\n \"Baxter used to date Lauren Hynde.\" She stubs her cigarette out, smiles thankfully at the very good-looking busboy pouring the champagne into flutes.\\n\\n \"Baxter used to date Lauren Hynde?\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s Lauren Hynde?\"\\n\\n \"Lauren Hynde, Victor,\" she stresses as if the name means something. \"You dated her.\"\\n\\n \"I did? I did? Yeah? Hmm.\"\\n\\n \"Good night, Victor.\"\\n\\n \"I just don\u0027t remember Lauren Hynde, baby. Solly Cholly.\"\\n\\n \"Lauren Hynde?\" she asks in disbelief. \"You don\u0027t remember dating her? My god, what are you going to say about me?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing, baby,\" I tell her, finally done deseeding. \"We\u0027re gonna get married and grow old together. How did the shows go? Look-there\u0027s Scott Bakula. Hey, peace, man. Richard\u0027s looking for you, bud.\"\\n\\n \"Lauren Hynde, Victor.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s so cool. Hey Alfonse-great tattoo, guy.\" I turn back to Chloe.\\n\\n \"Did you know Damien wears a hairpiece? He\u0027s some kind of demented wig addict.\"\\n\\n \"Who told you this?\"\\n\\n \"One of the guys at the club,\" I say without pausing.\\n\\n \"Lauren Hynde, Victor. Lauren Hynde.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s dat?\" I say, making a crazy face, leaning over, kissing her neck noisily. Suddenly Patrick McMullan glides by, politely asks for a photo, complimenting Chloe on the shows today. We move in close together, look up, smile, the flash goes off. \"Hey, crop the pot,\" I warn as he spots Patrick Kelly and scampers off.\\n\\n \"Do you think he heard me?\"\\n\\n \"Lauren Hynde\u0027s one of my best friends, Victor.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know her, but hey, if she\u0027s a friend of yours, well, need I say anything but automatically?\" I start rolling the joint. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-16.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
