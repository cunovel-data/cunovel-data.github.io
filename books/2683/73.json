Spare me. It\u0027s freezing in this apartment.\" \"Hey Victor, look at me.\" I stop, sigh, turn around. \"I don\u0027t want to apologize about how good my boyfriend is at irritating people, okay?\" I\u0027m just staring at nothing or what I imagine is nothing until I\u0027m finally moved to say, \"As a general rule you shouldn\u0027t expect too much from people, darling,\" and then I kiss her on the cheek. \"I just had my makeup done, so you can\u0027t make me cry.\" 7 We\u0027ll slide down the surface of things... Old U2 on the stereo and gridlock jams the streets two blocks from the club and I\u0027m not really hearing the things that are being said in the back of the limousine, just words-technobeat, slamming, moonscape, Semtex, nirvana, photogenic-and names of people I know-Jade Jagger, Iman, Andy Garcia, Patsy Kensit, the Goo-Goo Dolls, Galliano-and fleeting pieces of subjects I\u0027m usually interested in-Doc Martens, Chapel Hill, the Kids in the Hall, alien abduction, trampolines-because right now I\u0027m fidgeting with an unlit joint, looking up through the limo\u0027s sunroof, spacing on the sweeping patterns spotlights are making on the black buildings above and around us. Baxter and Lauren are sitting across from Chloe and me and I\u0027m undergoing a slow-motion hidden freak-out, focusing on our excruciating progress toward the club while Chloe keeps trying to touch my hand, which I let her do for seconds at a time before I pull away to light one of Baxter\u0027s cigarettes or to rewind the U2 tape or to simply touch my forehead, specifically not looking in the direction of Lauren Hynde or how her legs are slightly spread or the way she\u0027s staring sadly back at her own reflection in the tinted windows. \"We all live in a yellow limousine,\" Baxter sing-laughs. \"A yellow limousine,\" Chloe sings too, giggling nervously, looking over at me for approval. I give it by nodding at Baxter, who\u0027s nodding back, and I\u0027m shuddering. We\u0027ll slide down the surface of things... Finally we\u0027re at the curb in front of the club and the first thing I hear is someone yelling \"Action!\" and U2\u0027s \"Even Better Than the Real Thing\" starts playing somewhere out of the sky as the driver opens the door and Baxter\u0027s checking his hair in Chloe\u0027s compact and I toss him my cummerbund. \"Just wrap this around your head and look dreamy,\" I mutter. \"You\u0027ll be okay.\" \"Victor,\" Chloe starts. A wave of cold wind sweeps over the crowd standing behind the barricades in front of the club and causes the confetti strewn over the plush purple-and-green carpet leading up to the entrance to dance and swirl around the legs of cops guarding the place and behind the velvet ropes stand three cool Irish guys Damien hired, each of them holding a walkie-talkie and a separate guest list, and on either side of the velvet ropes are huge gangs of photographers and then the head publicist-smiling warmly until she sees Chloe\u0027s dress-asks us to wait where we are because Alison, wearing the same Todd Oldham dress Chloe has on, and Damien in a Gucci tuxedo are making their entrance and posing for the paparazzi, but people in the crowd have already noticed Chloe and shout out her name in high, garbled voices. Damien appears unusually tense, his jaw clenching and unclenching itself, and Lauren suddenly grabs my hand and I\u0027m also holding Chloe\u0027s and when I look over at Chloe I notice she\u0027s holding Baxter\u0027s. Damien turns around when he hears people shouting out Chloe\u0027s name and he nods at me, then smiles sadly at Lauren, who just mutters something indifferent, and when he sees Chloe\u0027s dress he does a hideous double take and tries valiantly to smile back a humongous gag and then he hurriedly ushers Alison into the club even though she\u0027s in the middle of taking major advantage of the photo ops, obviously pissed at the interruption, and thankfully Chloe\u0027s already too blinded by the flashing cameras to have noticed Alison\u0027s dress and I\u0027m making a significant mental note about what should happen once inside: dim all the lights, sweet darling, or the night will be over with. The photographers start shouting out all our names as we move toward the stairs leading up into the club and we linger for the appropriate amount of time-our faces masks, Chloe smiling wanly, Baxter smiling sullenly, Lauren genuinely smiling for the first time tonight, me sufficiently dazed-and above the door in giant \u002770s lettering is a warning from MTV (\"This Event Is Being Videotaped. By Entering You Consent to the Cablecast and Other Exhibition of Your Name, Voice and Likeness\") and then we\u0027re inside moving through the metal detectors and Chloe whispers something into my ear that I can\u0027t hear. We\u0027ll slide down the surface of things...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-73.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
