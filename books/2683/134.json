Well, it was in Notting Hill -\"\n \"Of course,\" he says derisively, which almost puts me at ease.\n \"Oh gosh, I know, man, I know.\" Stuck, just staring at him as he glances back at the computer screen, I tighten the robe around me.\n \"It was for the painter Gary Hume, right?\" he asks, coaxing.\n \"Oh yeah,\" I say. \"But everyone knew it was really for Patsy and Liam.\"\n \"Right, right,\" he says, tapping three keys and rapidly calling onto the screen more airplane diagrams. \"Who was there? What luminaries showed up?\"\n \"Well, um, Kate Moss and Stella Tennant and Iris Palmer and I think Jared Leto and Carmen Electra and, um, Damon Albarn and... we drank orange punch and... I got pretty wasted... and there were lots of... ice sculptures.\"\n \"Yeah?\"\n \"Where were you, man?\" I ask, finally easing into a more comfortable vibe.\n \"I was in Paris.\"\n \"Modeling?\"\n \"Business,\" he says simply.\n \"But not modeling?\"\n \"No, that\u0027s all over,\" he says, checking something in a notebook that lies open next to the computer. \"I completed that part of my life.\"\n \"Oh yeah man,\" I say, nodding. \"I know what you mean.\"\n \"Really?\" He grins, looking over his shoulder. \"Do you?\"\n \"Yeah.\" I shrug. \"I\u0027m thinking of calling it quits too.\"\n \"So what are you doing in London, then, Victor?\" Bobby asks.\n \"Off the record?\"\n \"Modeling?\" He grins again.\n \"Oh spare me, man, spare me,\" I laugh. \"No way-I mean, I really want to get out of that, branch out.\"\n \"It\u0027s a very rough life, right?\"\n \"Man, it\u0027s so hard.\"\n \"Potentially devastating.\"\n \"I\u0027m just kicking back and taking a breather.\"\n \"I think that\u0027s a smart move.\"\n \"Yeah?\"\n \"It can ruin people. I\u0027ve seen people destroyed.\"\n \"Me too, man. I am so with you.\"\n \"I have no stomach for it,\" he says. \"I have absolutely no stomach for it.\"\n \"But... you have, like, a great stomach, man,\" I say, confused.\n \"What?\" Bobby looks down at himself, realizes where I\u0027m coming from and starts smiling, his confused expression turning sweet. \"Oh, right. Thanks. Hmm.\"\n \"So when did you get in?\" I ask, beginning the bonding process.\n \"This morning,\" he yawns, stretching. \"How about you?\"\n \"A couple days ago,\" I tell him.\n \"You came in from New York?\"\n \"Yeah man.\"\n \"What\u0027s New York like these days?\" he asks, concentrating on the screen again. \"I\u0027m rarely there. And what I read about I\u0027m not sure I can handle. Maybe I\u0027m just all grown up or something.\"\n \"Oh, y\u0027know, it\u0027s all kind of, um, bogus, man,\" I say. \"Young people are such idiots, you know what I\u0027m saying?\"\n \"People applauding madly as supermodels gyrate down runways? No thanks, man.\"\n \"Oh man, I am so with you.\"\n \"What do you do there?\"\n \"The usual. Modeling. I helped open a club last week.\" I pause. \"I\u0027m up for a part in Flatliners II.\"\n \"God, it\u0027s freezing,\" he shouts again, hugging himself \"Are you cold too?\"\n \"I\u0027m a little chilly,\" I concede.\n He pads out of the room and from somewhere in the house he yells, \"Where is the f**king heater in this place?\" and then he calls out, \"Should we start a fire?\"\n CDs scattered on top of one of the giant speakers include Pete Gabriel, John Hiatt, someone named Freedy Johnston, the las Replacements album. Outside, through glass doors, a small terrace is surrounded by a garden filled with white tulips, and tiny birds congregate on a steel fountain, and as the wind picks up and shadows star crossing the lawn they decide something\u0027s wrong and fly away in unison. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-134.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: \n The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
