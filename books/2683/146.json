She\u0027s told good news by her agent: Tammy has the next cover for British Vogue. Everyone\u0027s wearing sunglasses. A discussion about \"Seinfeld\" and ceiling fans commences. Tammy declines a glass of champagne, then reconsiders.\\n\\n The sky, is starting to clear and clouds are dissolving and the temperature rises ten degrees in fifteen minutes so the students eating lunch in the open courtyard at the Institute of Political Studies start sunning themselves as the BMW the Lebanese is driving rolls to a stop on the Boulevard Raspail, where a different film crew is waiting on neighboring rooftops prepared to record the following events with telephoto lenses.\\n\\n Below them everyone\u0027s sighing with pleasure and students are drinking beer and lying shirtless across benches and reading magazines and sharing sandwiches while plans to skip classes start formulating and someone with a camcorder roams the courtyard, finally focusing in on a twenty-year-old guy who\u0027s sitting on a blanket weeping silently while reading a note from his girlfriend who has just left him and she\u0027s written that they will never get back together again and he\u0027s rocking back and forth telling himself it\u0027s okay, it\u0027s okay, and the cam- corder angles away and focuses in on a girl giving another girl a back rub. A German television crew interviews students on the upcoming elections. Joints are shared. Rollerbladers whiz by.\\n\\n The instructions the Lebanese received were simple: just remove the top of the Vuitton box before leaving the carbut since Bobby Hughes lied about when the bomb will go off-he simply told the driver to park the car and leave it on Boulevard Raspail in front of the institute-the driver will die in the blast. The Lebanese, who was involved in the planning of an attack in January on CIA headquarters in Langley, is eating M M\u0027s and thinking about a girl named Siggi he met last month in Iceland. A student named Brigid walks by the BMW and notices the Lebanese leaning over the passenger seat and she even registers the panic on his face as he lifts something up in the seconds before the car explodes.\\n\\n A simple flash of light, a loud sound, the BMW bursts apart.\\n\\n The extent of the destruction is a blur and its aftermath somehow feels beside the point. The point is the bomb itself, its placement, its activation-that\u0027s the statement. Not Brigid blown apart beyond recognition or the force of the blast flinging thirty students closest to the car forty, fifty feet into the air or the five students killed instantly, two of them by flying shrapnel that sailed across the courtyard and was embedded in their chests, and not the other section of car, which flies by, lopping off an arm, and not the three students immediately blinded. It\u0027s not the legs blown off, the skulls crushed, the people bleeding to death in minutes. The uprooted asphalt, the blackened trees, the benches splattered with gore, some of it burned-all of this matters just as much. It\u0027s really about the will to accomplish this destruction and not about the outcome, because that\u0027s just decoration.\\n\\n A stunned silence and then-among the conscious covered with blood, not always their own-the screaming starts.\\n\\n Fifty-one injured. Four people will never walk again. Three others are severely brain-damaged. Along with the driver of the BMW, thirteen are dead, including an older man who dies, blocks away, of a heart attack at the time of the blast. (A week later a teacher\u0027s assistant from Lyons will die from head injuries, raising the number of dead to fourteen.) By the time the flashing blue lights of ambulances start arriving at the darkening scene, the film crew has packed up and disappeared and will show up later in the week at another designated spot. Without staring through the lens of the cameras, everything at that distance looks tiny and inconsequential and vaguely unreal to them. You can tell who is dead and who is not only by the way the bodies look when they\u0027re picked up.\\n\\n And later that night at a very cool, sexy dinner in an upstairs room at the Hotel Crillon, past a door flanked by dark-haired, handsome guards, Tammy mingles with Amber Valletta, Oscar de la Renta, Gianfranco Ferre, Brad Renfro, Christian Louboutin, Danielle Steel, the Princess of Wales, Bernard Arnault and various Russians and Vogue editors and everyone is into very serious slouching and some people just got back from Marrakech-a few less jaded because of that trip-and others pay their respects to Tammy as she huddles in a corner gossiping with Shalom Harlow about how all the girls are dating so many inappropriate people (nobodies, gangsters, fishermen, boys, members of the House of Lords, Jamaicans with whom they have no rapport) and Tammy\u0027s fanning herself with an invitation to a party at Queen that a boy who looks just like Christian Bale offered her but she\u0027s going to bypass it in favor of one in the 16th arrondissement that Naomi\u0027s throwing and then sashimi\u0027s served and more cigarettes are bummed then lit and Tammy leans into John Galliano and whispers \"You\u0027re so nuts, baby\" and she\u0027s drinking too much red wine and switches to Coke and more than one lesbian vaguely comes on to her and someone wearing a kimono asks how Bruce Rhinebeck is and Tammy, gazing at a figure prancing by in the darkness, answers \"Wait\" dreamily because she\u0027s realizing it\u0027s really just another difficult evening.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-146.html","bookId":2683,"book":{"id":2683,"title":"Glamorama","description":"Storyline: The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.
