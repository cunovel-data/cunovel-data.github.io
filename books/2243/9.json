{"id":84869,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"By the time I got back to my house, Phillip was home and more than willing to help me unload the groceries - so he could find out what I\u0027d gotten that he wanted to eat. I\u0027d seen about half the people I knew dashing frantically through the grocery store, and all of them looked as scatterbrained as I felt, but I hadn\u0027t been so frantic that I\u0027d forgotten to buy some snack stuff. I told Phillip he was going to help me cook, and he stared longingly at the television before he agreed. \"How was your lunch with Robin?\" I asked. \"We had ham sandwiches,\" Phillip said, which was not exactly the information I was after. \"He\u0027s pretty cool,\" Phillip added almost grudgingly after I\u0027d put away the contents of one bag. \"We had a long talk about stuff. The only dumb thing about him is his name.\" \"I\u0027m glad you two are getting along,\" I said. I was very curious to hear Robin\u0027s account of their conversation. \"You gonna marry him?\" It would be beyond coy to pretend I\u0027d never thought of it. \"If he asks me, I\u0027ll think about it,\" I said. \"You could ask him.\" Hmmm. \"No,\" I said. \"I just don\u0027t think I could do that.\" Though I was a raving liberal compared to 50 percent of the people I knew in Lawrenceton, I knew asking Robin to marry me was way beyond my possibility level, even though I was now an Uppity Woman. \"Chicken,\" Phillip said fondly. \"Yep,\" I said. \"That\u0027s me. Oh, by the way, I found a gas receipt on the floor Monday night. Did your friend stop for gas on her way into Lawrenceton?\" His face turned red just at the mention. \"No,\" he said. \"We stopped for gas in Rome. Remember, I took a bus into Lawrenceton.\" Phillip had no reason to lie, and he\u0027d never known Poppy. I had enough confirmation to drop him from my list. Though Emma had narrowed the list down, I needed to talk to the other people who might have dropped the receipt. I wanted to hear their stories with my own ears. Opening the refrigerator, I poked the turkey breast with an anxious finger. It was close to being thawed. I got the package of ready-made piecrust out so it could be reaching room temperature, then took the pecans out of the freezer for the pecan pie. I handed my little brother a recipe for pumpkin pie and a can of pumpkin. \"Put all of this stuff in there,\" I said. I got everything required out of the cabinet and put it in a clump on the counter. I pulled out my little electric mixer and a mixing bowl and set them on the counter by his stuff. \"There you go,\" I said briskly. I turned on both of my ovens, yanked two pie plates out of the cabinet, and patted the piecrusts into place. Then I threw together the pecan pie. Phillip worked quite a bit slower, but once he found out where the measuring spoons were and so on, he did a creditable job of preparing the pumpkin filling. Since Robin\u0027s mom was coming, I felt obliged to follow Lizanne\u0027s example in making my own cranberry sauce, but that\u0027s the easiest thing in the world, and I got that ready while the pies were baking. Phillip ran the vacuum for me while I cooked the sweet potatoes and put them through the food processor for the sweet potato casserole, and I decided after that was done, we could rest. Every dish went into the dishwasher, I started it running, and then Phillip and I watched a stupid game show on television. We competed with each other to see who could shout out the answer the fastest, and in general we had a silly good time. I called out for Chinese - we considered ourselves on the cutting edge, in Lawrenceton, having a Chinese restaurant that delivered - and though it was late in the evening to be eating, I was feeling relaxed, since the house looked good, I\u0027d gotten a head start on the cooking, and, most of all, my brother just couldn\u0027t be involved in any way in Poppy\u0027s death. Tomorrow, I would meet Robin\u0027s mother, and while I was a bit anxious about that, I figured since Robin spoke so lovingly of her, she couldn\u0027t be too formidable... . And after all, I\u0027d been a grown woman, married and widowed, for many years now. Just when I was feeling fairly saturated with satisfaction, the phone rang. I reached over to the table by my chair, gestured to Phillip to turn down the volume on the television, and answered it. \"Aurora,\" Mother said. \"Hi, Mother. How are things at your house?\" \"John is doing fairly well,\" she said, giving me the most important news first. \"John David hasn\u0027t been arrested, thank God. Melinda called. He was over at her house, and he announced he was taking the baby and they were spending the night in a motel. He said he felt like he\u0027d been enough trouble to people and that he should spend some time with his son.\" I held the phone away and gaped at it. Would wonders never cease? \"That\u0027s amazing,\" I said, finally realizing I had to say something. \"Yes,\" she said a little dryly. \"I thought so, too.\" \"Can you and John come over tomorrow to have a glass of wine with Phillip and Robin and Robin\u0027s mother?\" \"His mother? His mother\u0027s in town?\" Mother was shocked out of her weariness. \"Oh my Lord, you should have told me!\" \"Yes, she\u0027s over at his apartment now. She\u0027s coming to Thanksgiving here tomorrow.\" I knew Mother had too much on her shoulders right now, but it was good to hear her sounding more like her normal self. \"What about you and John? If you want to come here to eat, I\u0027ll have plenty. Did John David tell you any plans he might have? Should I invite him?\" Three extra adults would be stretching it, but I could manage. I had assumed that John David would be staying with John and my mother and that they\u0027d be eating together, though celebrating would be impossible. \"Of course John and I will come over for a glass of wine, and to meet Robin\u0027s mother. But I don\u0027t think we\u0027d be exactly up to a festive meal. I\u0027m feeding us out of the refrigerator tomorrow, since I just couldn\u0027t work up the energy for anything else. I think we have enough food here to last us for two weeks, and we actually have a smoked turkey breast and a ham. John David is coming over here. What time would you like us to drop by?\" I had planned to serve the holiday meal at one, so we settled on three o\u0027clock. I told mother I\u0027d call John David at his motel and at least invite him to come eat (no matter how much I secretly hoped he would decline). I remembered one more question for my mother before I hung up. \"Has John David heard from the police about when he\u0027s going to get Poppy\u0027s body back to bury?\" \"It seems as though there\u0027s a backlog in Atlanta, so it won\u0027t be until Monday at the earliest.\" \"Oh no.\" Though in a way it was a relief that Poppy\u0027s funeral wouldn\u0027t be within the next couple of days, I didn\u0027t want to think about that backlog. \"I\u0027m so glad the Wynns decided to go back home,\" Mother continued. \"I know they had things to take care of, because they left to come over here in such a hurry. It\u0027ll be much better if they just come back when the funeral\u0027s settled. I think they assumed they\u0027d be making the arrangements, and it took them aback when John David told them what he was going to do.\" \"The Wynns are leaving? Where are they now?\" I had actually forgotten about the Wynns, and to my shame, my Thanksgiving plans had never included them. I carried the cordless phone over to the door of the room the Wynns had been using and glanced inside. Their things were still there. Hmm. \"Why, I don\u0027t know.\" Mother sounded surprised. \"Aren\u0027t they - they haven\u0027t come to your house and gotten their bags?\" \"No,\" I said, anxiety making my voice sharp. \"I haven\u0027t seen them since last night.\" \"I talked to them about four today,\" Mother said, \"and they told me they were leaving. Where do you suppose they could be?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" I had a shameful, petulant moment of wishing someone would just do the predictable thing. I don\u0027t deal well with prolonged upheaval. \"Do they have any good friends left in town?\" \"You know, they didn\u0027t have a lot even when they lived here.\" That was true, though I\u0027d never posed it to myself that way. The Wynns, tall and thin and aggressively healthy, bright and articulate, had never been the most popular ministerial couple in town. The church youth group had been popular, though, because Marvin Wynn, awkward with his own belated child, was a whiz with other people\u0027s children. I sighed, trying to aim it away from the phone. All I wanted to do was go to bed. But I had to track down my guests, and I had to relieve my mother of this anxiety. \"I\u0027ll call around a little,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll get back to you. Maybe they\u0027re with John David, playing with the baby. Which motel?\" I called the Lawrenceton Best Western, and John David was in. \"Poppy\u0027s folks didn\u0027t leave our key with you?\" John David sounded tired, and numb. I could hear the baby crying in the background. \"They wanted to get some family heirloom to take back to their house with them - something of Sandy\u0027s mother\u0027s. I told them I had no idea where it was but said they were welcome to go over there and look. They were supposed to leave my house key with you.\" \"How long ago was that?\" \"Hours. I thought they were long gone back home.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll go over there and check,\" I said. It was the last thing in the world I wanted to do, but it was what I should do. \"Please do.\" There was a long pause. John David said, \"I don\u0027t know what they could be doing in our house for so long. Poppy always had a very tense relationship with her parents. If you\u0027d do this, I\u0027d really appreciate it. I\u0027m just not up to dealing with them tonight. This little guy is missing Poppy.\" I knew my stepbrother was referring to Chase, but I think he was also talking about himself. It was pitch-black, and I didn\u0027t know what I would find over at the house on Swanson. I wanted someone to go with me, preferably someone bigger than I, or at least well armed. My dad and his wife would kill me if I took Phillip to a place where he might have any sort of bad experience. Robin\u0027s mother was at his place, and I hated to butt in on their time together; plus, it wouldn\u0027t make a good impression, would it - calling Robin to come help me, when his mom was in residence? Calling the police seemed a little over the top. I thought of Angel or Shelby Youngblood, who used to work for Martin and me - and then I remembered they\u0027d gone to Florida. That left only one possibility on my list. Reluctantly, I called Bryan Pascoe. That was better than calling Arthur anyway. Why\u0027d I call a guy? Politically incorrect, huh? Because I was scared, that\u0027s why. And I figured Melinda was busy with her kids. And I didn\u0027t like Avery. Bryan, to my near dismay, was delighted to hear from me, and willing to go to Poppy\u0027s and meet me there. Phillip, engrossed in his TV show, gave me an offhand wave as I left. It took only five minutes to get to Poppy and John David\u0027s place, but the lawyer was already there. Bryan was wearing jeans and a sweater, which for him was really letting his hair down. I apologized again for getting him out of his house so late in the evening. \"No problem,\" he said. \"I\u0027m a full-service lawyer. Besides, all I had to do was sit around and watch a tape of Buffy the Vampire Slayer!\" I laughed, much to my own surprise. \"What are you doing for the holiday?\" I asked, just to stave off going up that sidewalk and into the house. Sure enough, the house wasn\u0027t dark; even though it ought to have been. Sandy and Marvin Wynn were apparently still there. What on earth were they doing? \"I\u0027m going to have dinner with my mother at the Assisted Living Center,\" Bryan said. Again I was surprised. Somehow, I couldn\u0027t picture Bryan with his mother. \"Your dad\u0027s gone?\" I asked. \"Nope, he\u0027s living in Atlanta with his second wife, a very nice woman he met in his nursing home. He and my mother have been divorced for the past twenty years or so.\" \"And he remarried. I guess you\u0027re never too old for romance.\" \"Definitely not,\" Bryan said. \"Now, what are we doing here?\" \"The Wynns are in the house. They borrowed John David\u0027s key. They were supposed to come by and get their bags and leave for their home. They told my mother they\u0027d return when the funeral was definitely scheduled. They told John David they wanted to retrieve something of Sandy\u0027s mother\u0027s, some family heirloom Poppy had. I don\u0027t believe he asked or cared what it was. They\u0027ve been here much longer than that should take. And we\u0027re almost certain that Sandy was in the area the morning Poppy was killed.\" Bryan considered for a minute. \"So, am I here as John David\u0027s lawyer or as your bodyguard?\" I smiled again, though I don\u0027t know if he could make it out in the gloom. Poppy and John David lived in the middle of the block, and the streetlights on the corners didn\u0027t really illuminate their yard. \"A bit of both,\" I said. \"I\u0027m worried about them. But if they\u0027re okay, I plan on being mad at them. They\u0027ve been here way too long.\" I took a deep breath. \"Mostly, this is just weird and needs to be looked into. John David asked me to do that for him.\" \"Clear as a bell,\" Bryan said. We went up the flagstones to the front door, and after a moment\u0027s hesitation, I opened it without knocking. This wasn\u0027t the Wynns\u0027 house, after all. Bryan shut the door behind us, and we stood in the hallway at the foot of the stairs leading up to the bedrooms, trying to make sense of what we saw. Marvin Wynn was crouched by Poppy\u0027s rolltop desk, in the small room to the right of the stairs, the room originally intended for a dining room. Both Poppy and John David used it as an office, and they each had a computer there. A large bookshelf covered one wall, and it was crammed with all kinds of books and knickknacks. Now the room was in an utter jumble. Half the books were on the floor. Marvin, crouched on the floor, was pulling the drawers out of the rolltop desk and turning them over to examine the bottoms. He was so startled when he looked up and discovered two people observing him that he jumped, visibly. He gasped and dropped the drawer, which landed painfully on his thighs. He made another noise, this one surprising from a minister. Poppy would not have taped a family heirloom to the bottom of the drawer. \"What are you doing?\" I asked, and I didn\u0027t sound polite. \"What is it, Marv?\" Sandy called from the top of the stairs. She froze when she saw us. Her large brown eyes, magnified many times by her outsize brown-framed glasses, were wide and shocked. \"What are you two doing?\" I said again, with even more of an edge to my voice now. Someone had already helped himself to searching the contents of Poppy\u0027s closet and her bedroom. Now Poppy\u0027s mom and dad were ransacking the house under the guise of parental love. I was very unhappy with them. I was also angry that people I\u0027d always respected were making a mockery of that respect by their behavior. The Wynns appeared to be groping for an answer to my abrupt question. \"We, ah, we were looking for something. We asked John David if he\u0027d mind.\" \"You told John David you were looking for an heirloom Mrs. Wynn\u0027s mom had left her,\" I said bluntly. \u0027You\u0027ve been here for hours, searching this house, as far as I can see. And I\u0027m sure whatever precious heirloom it was, Poppy wouldn\u0027t have taped it to the bottom of a drawer, or stuffed it into a book!\" The Wynns didn\u0027t seem to be able to come up with a response. Finally, Marvin said, \"Who is this man with you?\" \"I\u0027m Bryan Pascoe, John David\u0027s attorney.\" Sandy Wynn came farther down the stairs, the first time she\u0027d moved since she\u0027d called to her husband. She exchanged glances with Marvin. \"Surely you didn\u0027t need to bring a lawyer\" Marvin said in his best ministerial voice. \"After all, we\u0027re family here.\" He could not have said anything more calculated to make my neck crawl. \"We are not family,\" I said clearly. \"Please explain yourselves.\" \"Listen, missy,\" Sandy said. \"We are thirty years older than you are, and you will treat us with some respect.\" \"When you deserve it.\" Sandy\u0027s face sagged on its bones, making her look much older in an instant. \"We were just looking for some old family things,\" she insisted. \"We haven\u0027t found them. Since you\u0027re in such a snit, missy, we\u0027ll just leave.\" She said this as if it was a big threat. \"We\u0027ll stop by your house and get our bags and go home. You\u0027ll excuse me, under the circumstances, if I don\u0027t write a thank-you note.\" \"It\u0027s very late for you to start home,\" Bryan said, sounding irritatingly reasonable. \"Why don\u0027t you check into the motel here in town, instead, and start back in the morning?\" \"No, young man,\" Marvin Wynn said. \"I\u0027m not too old to drive at night, and we want to get out of this town. The day I retired from my job here was one of the best days of my life.\" I\u0027d learned, years ago, that being a pastor is a job - a difficult and stressful one at that - but nonetheless, I found it shocking to hear the former Reverend Wynn speak in such a vicious way. Bryan didn\u0027t respond, which was a relief. I didn\u0027t want to hear any more discussion. I just wanted the absence of the Wynns. I nudged an open book with my foot. The house was in a terrible state now. I sighed, already guessing whose task it would be to set it to rights. Sandy and Marvin took some time getting their coats; with Bryan and me standing there, there was little opportunity for them to take anything. I hated being so suspicious, but I knew I had to be alert. This situation was completely fishy. Sandy had seemed so broken up on Monday night, but now I knew she\u0027d already been in Lawrenceton that morning. Marvin, too, had appeared grief-stricken and miserable, at least to my eyes. And yet here they were, trashing their daughter\u0027s home. Finally, they were at the door. Swaddled in all their winter gear (pretty much not necessary, for the night was in the fifties), the older couple looked harmless and beneficent with their silver hair and glasses. Sandy opened her mouth to say something else insulting, but I preempted her. \"What were you doing out at the Grabbit Kwik getting gas Monday morning? Have you told the police about your little trip to Lawrenceton before Poppy\u0027s body was found?\" \"We never came here Monday morning,\" Marvin said with dignity. \"I went to get my annual physical, and Sandy went to do some comparison shopping for a new stove.\" \"Good cover story,\" I said to Sandy. \"Something you could spend a long time doing, with no tangible results.\" If Sandy had looked tense before, she looked beleaguered now. But her lips stayed pressed together. I couldn\u0027t have wiggled one bit of truth between them. \"Key,\" I said tersely, holding out my hand. Sandy fished in her pocket and dropped the key on my palm, which closed around it instantly. But then I had a thought, and I opened my palm to compare this key to the one John David had loaned me. They matched. The Wynns gave us twin glares as they left. I sat down on the stairs when the door shut behind them. This had shaken me more than I\u0027d realized. I was actually surprised at how much the week\u0027s events were depleting my normal energy. I\u0027d had several of these shaky spells. Bryan sat by me. He put his arm around me, which I could have done without, but it was okay. It didn\u0027t feel sexual, not until his fingers started playing with my hair, that is. \"Do you want to call John David from here?\" \"Would you?\" I was just plain being weak. \"Sure,\" he said, but he didn\u0027t move. \"What do you think they were looking for?\" he asked after a moment or two. \"I don\u0027t know. Something small. And the person who was searching Poppy\u0027s closet was looking for something small, too. Something that could be hidden in a book, or a shoe box.\" \"Jewelry?\" \"That would fit. Or documents.\" \"What kind of documents? She left a will. Poppy and John David both made wills when Poppy found out she was pregnant.\" \"John David tell you that?\" \"Yes. But it wasn\u0027t the first thing he said. He didn\u0027t come out with it until I asked him that specifically.\" I thought Bryan was telling me that in his opinion, John David hadn\u0027t been thinking of his possible financial gain from Poppy\u0027s death. I had never considered the fact that Poppy might have some money stashed away, and I couldn\u0027t imagine where such a stash could have come from. Her dad was a minister, so his pay had been low, and he and his wife were still very much alive. If Poppy had ever gotten any substantial inheritance from another relative, I\u0027d never heard of it. And Poppy had worked for a few years, but working for a few years as a teacher and living off the proceeds were almost a guarantee you didn\u0027t have a lot left over. \"What lawyer drew up the wills?\" I asked. \"Bubba Sewell.\" \"Hmm. You know what I wonder? I wonder if Poppy gave Bubba a key during the course of their affair.\" \"I hope I don\u0027t have to ask him that in court.\" Bryan\u0027s hand kept combing through my hair. I moved a little farther from him, and his hand dropped into his lap. \"I can ask him.\" Especially after our confrontation the day before (or had it been Monday?), Bubba and I were quite ready to be rude to each other. My mind moved on ahead. \"Do you think ... do you suppose... that Poppy gave a key to each of her, um, men friends?\" \"There\u0027d be quite a few around, if that\u0027s the case.\" Bryan looked thoughtful. \"Yes.\" I had a lot of unpleasant thoughts circling in my tired brain. \"But Bubba ...\" \"Yes?\" Suddenly, I didn\u0027t want to continue. \"Nothing,\" I said. \"While I check out the house, why don\u0027t you call John David and let him know what happened? Then we can go. I really appreciate your doing this.\" \"This is just the kind of thing a good lawyer does for his clients,\" Bryan said with a wide, sharklike smile. \"There must be a lot I don\u0027t know about good lawyers.\" I smiled back. I went up the stairs. The closet, of course, was still in disarray. This time, even John David\u0027s clothes and ties and coats and sweaters had been gone through. What the hell were people looking for? I was assuming that two different people (or groups of people) had gone through the house. The first intruder, the one who\u0027d confined the search to Poppy\u0027s half of the closet, had had a specific idea of where the object - whatever it was - had been stashed. In contrast, the Wynns had used a shotgun approach. \"You could find out,\" Bryan said, and I looked at him blankly. I\u0027d been lost in my thoughts. I didn\u0027t even realize for a few seconds that he had followed me and was continuing the conversation. I was too slow responding. Bryan\u0027s face wasn\u0027t too happy. \"Excuse me,\" I said. \"I was wondering what they could be looking for.\" \"Okay. Anything else you want to do here tonight?\" \"No. I\u0027ll clean it up Friday. I\u0027ll see if my sister-in-law will help.\" \"Then I\u0027ll call John David.\" Bryan went off to use the telephone. I sat where I was and eyed the devastation around me. I didn\u0027t see how the Wynns could have hoped to conceal their depredations. They\u0027d have had to work all night to put things back. I wondered how they\u0027d hoped to explain it. This looked like a go-for-broke situation. If they\u0027d found what they needed, they wouldn\u0027t care if they couldn\u0027t explain it. For a couple who placed tremendous importance on community opinion, they were acting recklessly. That meant they were desperate. So, they were searching for something of vital importance, something so significant to their future that their need for it eclipsed their daughter\u0027s death. I could not understand parents like that, though I reminded myself of the notorious struggles between the Wynns and Poppy when she was in her teens. And I recalled what Emma McKibbon had told me about the Reverend Wynn\u0027s predilection for young women. Was there proof of the retired minister\u0027s dalliance with female members of his congregation? Maybe such proof was what Poppy had concealed in her home. I shook my head, all to myself. Why would she do that? What leverage would it give her with her parents? I couldn\u0027t imagine what she would want from them; want it so badly that she\u0027d keep such unpleasant things. And what could those things be? Pictures? I swallowed hard, disgusted at downing such an indigestible idea. \"Are you going to be sick?\" Bryan, having returned from calling John David, sounded terrified at the prospect. \"No, just thinking bad thoughts.\" \"I talked to John David. He\u0027s baffled. I told him they said they were going home until they heard from him about the funeral - they\u0027re reverting to the original plan - and he seemed relieved. I also called Arthur Smith again and left yet another message on his voice mail at work. So far, he hasn\u0027t responded to any of my calls. I want to tell him what we found out about Sandy Wynn, and I want to tell him that the Wynns were here tonight.\" \"I hope he calls back soon,\" I said dutifully, though in truth I found it hard to care. I felt very tired, which seemed about par lately. I dragged myself to my feet. I didn\u0027t want to ask Bryan for help. My stomach curdled with anxiety. Oh boy. Maybe I was going to be sick. I managed to get to my car without disgracing myself, and after thanking Bryan for coming out and providing moral and tactical assistance, I drove home. Phillip was on the phone when I walked in, and he was smiling broadly, so I figured the person on the other end was a female. After a minute, I deduced it was Josh Finstermeyer\u0027s sister, Joss. After ten more minutes, I grew a wee bit exasperated and gestured to Phillip to wind up the conversation. He did so willingly enough, then told me all about what the Finstermeyers were doing for their Thanksgiving celebration - remarkably, almost exactly what we would be doing. He asked if he could go over to their house tomorrow afternoon, after we\u0027d eaten, and I told him that would probably be okay. He beamed at me. It was the first time I\u0027d seen Phillip look carefree, and it made him very attractive. I felt sorry for Joss. I hoped she was a self-sufficient young woman. \"What happened with the Wynns?\" Phillip asked. \"I was sitting here watching TV when they came stomping in like someone had stuck a cattle prod up their - like they were really fired up. They didn\u0027t even speak.\" \"They were mad at me,\" I said, realizing I should have called ahead and warned Phillip what to expect. He didn\u0027t seem unduly shaken by the incident, and I reminded myself all over again that Phillip had been raised in a different world from the one I\u0027d been reared in. (That made me feel old, by the way.) Robin had learned something about Phillip over lunch, I hoped, something worth telling me. I couldn\u0027t picture my dad telling Phillip about the facts of life - well, Phillip knew the facts. What I meant, I decided, was the responsibilities. I was aware that I was absolutely exhausted. \"Phillip, I have to go to bed,\" I said. \"Sure, Roe. Anything you need me to do?\" \"No. I just hope I\u0027m not catching anything.\" \"You look kind of, ah, tired.\" Nice way of saying I looked like warm Jell-O. \"Yeah, I am. I\u0027m going to call it a day. Come get me if you need me.\" I went into my bedroom, and after a trip to my bathroom, I pulled on my nightgown and crawled into bed. No Robin to join me tonight, I reflected as I began to get drowsy (which was almost immediately). Maybe that was good. I didn\u0027t feel up to making whoopee. I felt achy all over, my skin extra sensitive. As I drifted into sleep, I prayed that I wasn\u0027t getting the flu.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/poppy-done-to-death-aurora-teagarden-8/page-9.html","bookId":2243,"book":{"id":2243,"title":"Poppy Done to Death (Aurora Teagarden #8)","description":"Storyline: Poppy Done to Death (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #8) Small-town Georgia librarian Aurora Teagarden finds her stepsister-in-law, Poppy, dead on the kitchen floor...and must sift through the sordid details of her relative\u0027s life to find the killer.
