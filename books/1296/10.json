{"id":13763,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X WYATT\u0027S TORCH","content":"\"God have mercy on us, ma\u0027am!\" said the clerk of the Hall of Records. \"Nobody knows who owns that factory now. I guess nobody will ever know it.\" The clerk sat at a desk in a ground-floor office, where dust lay undisturbed on the files and few visitors ever called. He looked at the shining automobile parked outside his window, in the muddy square that had once been the center of a prosperous county seat; he looked with a faint, wistful wonder at his two unknown visitors. \"Why?\" asked Dagny. He pointed helplessly at the mass of papers he had taken out of the files. \"The court will have to decide who owns it, which I don\u0027t think any court can do. If a court ever gets to it. I don\u0027t think it will.\" \"Why? What happened?\" \"Well, it was sold out-the Twentieth Century, I mean. The Twentieth Century Motor Company. It was sold twice, at the same time and to two different sets of owners. That was sort of a big scandal at the time, two years ago, and now it\u0027s just\"-he pointed-\"just a bunch of paper lying around, waiting for a court hearing. I don\u0027t see how any judge will be able to untangle any property rights out of it-or any right at all.\" \"Would you tell me please just what happened?\" \"Well, the last legal owner of the factory was The People\u0027s Mortgage Company, of Rome, Wisconsin. That\u0027s the town the other side of the factory, thirty miles north. That Mortgage Company was a sort of noisy outfit that did a lot of advertising about easy credit. Mark Yonts was the head of it. Nobody knew where he came from and nobody knows where he\u0027s gone to now, but what they discovered, the morning after The People\u0027s Mortgage Company collapsed, was that Mark Yonts had sold the Twentieth Century Motor factory to a bunch of suckers from South Dakota, and that he\u0027d also given it as collateral for a loan from a bank in Illinois. And when they took a look at the factory, they discovered that he\u0027d moved all the machinery out and sold it piecemeal, God only knows where and to whom. So it seems like everybody owns the place-and nobody. That\u0027s how it stands now-the South Dakotans and the bank and the attorney for the creditors of The People\u0027s Mortgage Company all suing one another, all claiming this factory, and nobody having the right to move a wheel in it, except that there\u0027s no wheels left to move.\" \"Did Mark Yonts operate the factory before he sold it?\" \"Lord, no, ma\u0027am! He wasn\u0027t the kind that ever operates anything. He didn\u0027t want to make money, only to get it. Guess he got it, too-more than anyone could have made out of that factory.\" He wondered why the blond, hard-faced man, who sat with the woman in front of his desk, looked grimly out the window at their car, at a large object wrapped in canvas, roped tightly under the raised cover of the car\u0027s luggage compartment. \"What happened to the factory records?\" \"Which do you mean, ma\u0027am?\" \"Their production records. Their work records. Their . . . personnel files.\" \"Oh, there\u0027s nothing left of that now. There\u0027s been a lot of looting going on. All the mixed owners grabbed what furniture or things they could haul out of there, even if the sheriff did put a padlock on the door. The papers and stuff like that-I guess it was all taken by the scavengers from Starnesville, that\u0027s the place down in the valley, where they\u0027re having it pretty tough these days. They burned the stuff for kindling, most likely.\" \"Is there anyone left here who used to work in the factory?\" asked Rearden. \"No, sir. Not around here. They all lived down in Starnesville.\" \"All of them?\" whispered Dagny; she was thinking of the ruins. \"The . . . engineers, too?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am. That was the factory town. They\u0027ve all gone, long ago.\" \"Do you happen to remember the names of any men who worked there?\" \"No, ma\u0027am.\" \"What owner was the last to operate the factory?\" asked Rearden. \"I couldn\u0027t say, sir. There\u0027s been so much trouble up there and the place has changed hands so many times, since old Jed Starnes died. He\u0027s the man who built the factory. He made this whole part of the country, I guess. He died twelve years ago.\" \"Can you give us the names of all the owners since?\" \"No, sir. We had a fire in the old courthouse, about three years ago, and all the old records are gone. I don\u0027t know where you could trace them now.\" \"You don\u0027t know how this Mark Yonts happened to acquire the factory?\" \"Yes, I know that. He bought it from Mayor Bascom of Rome. How Mayor Bascom happened to own it, I don\u0027t know.\" \"Where is Mayor Bascom now?\" \"Still there, in Rome.\" \"Thank you very much,\" said Rearden, rising. \"We\u0027ll call on him.\" They were at the door when the clerk asked, \"What is it you\u0027re looking for, sir?\" \"We\u0027re looking for a friend of ours,\" said Rearden. \"A friend we\u0027ve lost, who used to work in that factory.\" Mayor Bascom of Rome, Wisconsin, leaned back in his chair; his chest and stomach formed a pear-shaped outline under his soiled shirt. The air was a mixture of sun and dust, pressing heavily upon the porch of his house. He waved his arm, the ring on his finger flashing a large topaz of poor quality. \"No use, no use, lady, absolutely no use,\" he said. \"Would be just a waste of your time, trying to question the folks around here. There\u0027s no factory people left, and nobody that would remember much about them. So many families have moved away that what\u0027s left here is plain no good, if I do say so myself, plain no good, just being Mayor of a bunch of trash.\" He had offered chairs to his two visitors, but he did not mind it if the lady preferred to stand at the porch railing. He leaned back, studying her long-lined figure; high-class merchandise, he thought; but then, the man with her was obviously rich. Dagny stood looking at the streets of Rome. There were houses, sidewalks, lampposts, even a sign advertising soft drinks; but they looked as if it were now only a matter of inches and hours before the town would reach the stage of Starnesville. \"Naw, there\u0027s no factory records left,\" said Mayor Bascom. \"If that\u0027s what you want to find, lady, give it up. It\u0027s like chasing leaves in a storm now. Just like leaves in a storm. Who cares about papers? At a time like this, what people save is good, solid, material objects. One\u0027s got to be practical.\" Through the dusty windowpanes, they could see the living room of his house: there were Persian rugs on a buckled wooden floor, a portable bar with chromium strips against a wall stained by the seepage of last year\u0027s rains, an expensive radio with an old kerosene lamp placed on top of it. \"Sure, it\u0027s me that sold the factory to Mark Yonts. Mark was a nice fellow, a nice, lively, energetic fellow. Sure, he did trim a few corners, but who doesn\u0027t? Of course, he went a bit too far. That, I didn\u0027t expect. I thought he was smart enough to stay within the law-whatever\u0027s left of it nowadays.\" Mayor Bascom smiled, looking at them in a manner of placid frankness. His eyes were shrewd without intelligence, his smile good-natured without kindness. \"I don\u0027t think you folks are detectives,\" he said, \"but even if you were, it wouldn\u0027t matter to me. I didn\u0027t get any rake-off from Mark, he didn\u0027t let me in on any of his deals, I haven\u0027t any idea where he\u0027s gone to now.\" He sighed. \"I liked that fellow. Wish he\u0027d stayed around. Never mind the Sunday sermons. He had to live, didn\u0027t he? He was no worse than anybody, only smarter. Some get caught at it and some don\u0027t- that\u0027s the only difference. . . . Nope, I didn\u0027t know what he was going to do with it, when he bought that factory. Sure, he paid me quite a bit more than the old booby trap was worth. Sure, he was doing me a favor when he bought it. Nope, I didn\u0027t put any pressure on him to make him buy it. Wasn\u0027t necessary. I\u0027d done him a few favors before. There\u0027s plenty of laws that\u0027s sort of made of rubber, and a mayor\u0027s in a position to stretch them a bit for a friend. Well, what the hell? That\u0027s the only way anybody ever gets rich in this world\"-he glanced at the luxurious black car-\"as you ought to know.\" \"You were telling us about the factory,\" said Rearden, trying to control himself. \"What I can\u0027t stand,\" said Mayor Bascom, \"is people who talk about principles. No principle ever filled anybody\u0027s milk bottle. The only thing that counts in life is solid, material assets. It\u0027s no time for theories, when everything is falling to pieces around us. Well, me-I don\u0027t aim to go under. Let them keep their ideas and I\u0027ll take the factory. I don\u0027t want ideas, I just want my three square meals a day.\" \"Why did you buy that factory?\" \"Why does anybody buy any business? To squeeze whatever can be squeezed out of it. I know a good chance when I see it. It was a bankruptcy sale and nobody much who\u0027d want to bid on the old mess. So I got the place for peanuts. Didn\u0027t have to hold it long, either-Mark took it off my hands in two-three months. Sure, it was a smart deal, if I say so myself. No big business tycoon could have done any better with it.\" \"Was the factory operating when you took it over?\" \"Naw. It was shut down.\" \"Did you attempt to reopen it?\" \"Not me. I\u0027m a practical person.\" \"Can you recall the names of any men who worked there?\" \"No. Never met \u0027em.\" \"Did you move anything out of the factory?\" \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you. I took a look around-and what I liked was old Jed\u0027s desk. Old led Starnes. He was a real big shot in his time. Wonderful desk, solid mahogany. So I carted it home. And some executive, don\u0027t know who he was, had a stall shower in his bathroom, the like of which I never saw. A glass door with a mermaid cut in the glass, real art work, and hot stuff, too, hotter than any oil painting. So I had that shower lifted and moved here. What the hell, I owned it, didn\u0027t I? I was entitled to get something valuable out of that factory.\" \"Whose bankruptcy sale was it, when you bought the factory?\" \"Oh, that was the big crash of the Community National Bank in Madison. Boy, was that a crash! It just about finished the whole state of Wisconsin-sure finished this part of it. Some say it was this motor factory that broke the bank, but others say it was only the last drop in a leaking bucket, because the Community National had bum investments all over three or four states. Eugene Lawson was the head of it. The banker with a heart, they called him. He was quite famous in these parts two-three years ago.\" \"Did Lawson operate the factory?\" \"No. He merely lent an awful lot of money on it, more than he could ever hope to get back out of the old dump. When the factory busted, that was the last straw for Gene Lawson. The bank busted three months later.\" He sighed. \"It hit the folks pretty hard around here. They all had their life savings in the Community National.\" Mayor Bascom looked regretfully past his porch railing at his town. He jerked his thumb at a figure across the street: it was a white-haired charwoman, moving painfully on her knees, scrubbing the steps of a house. \"See that woman, for instance? They used to be solid, respectable folks. Her husband owned the dry-goods store. He worked all his life to provide for her in her old age, and he did, too, by the time he died- only the money was in the Community National Bank.\" \"Who operated the factory when it failed?\" \"Oh, that was some quicky corporation called Amalgamated Service, Inc. Just a puff-ball. Came up out of nothing and went back to it.\" \"Where are its members?\" \"Where are the pieces of a puff-ball when it bursts? Try and trace them all over the United States. Try it.\" \"Where is Eugene Lawson?\" \"Oh, him? He\u0027s done all right. He\u0027s got a job in Washington-in the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources.\" Rearden rose too fast, thrown to his feet by a jolt of anger, then said, controlling himself, \"Thank you for the information.\" \"You\u0027re welcome, friend, you\u0027re welcome,\" said Mayor Bascom placidly. \"I don\u0027t know what it is you\u0027re after, but take my word for it, give it up. There\u0027s nothing more to be had out of that factory.\" \"I told you that we are looking for a friend of ours.\" \"Well, have it your way. Must be a pretty good friend, if you\u0027ll go to so much trouble to find him, you and the charming lady who is not your wife.\" Dagny saw Rearden\u0027s face go white, so that even his lips became a sculptured feature, indistinguishable against his skin. \"Keep your dirty -\" he began, but she stepped between them. \"Why do you think that I am not his wife?\" she asked calmly. Mayor Bascom looked astonished by Rearden\u0027s reaction; he had made the remark without malice, merely like a fellow cheat displaying his shrewdness to his partners in guilt. \"Lady, I\u0027ve seen a lot in my lifetime,\" he said good-naturedly. \"Married people don\u0027t look as if they have a bedroom on their minds when they look at each other. In this world, either you\u0027re virtuous or you enjoy yourself. Not both, lady, not both.\" \"I\u0027ve asked him a question,\" she said to Rearden in time to silence him. \"He\u0027s given me an instructive explanation.\" \"If you want a tip, lady,\" said Mayor Bascom, \"get yourself a wedding ring from the dime store and wear it. It\u0027s not sure fire, but it helps.\" \"Thank you,\" she said, \"Good-bye.\" The stern, stressed calm of her manner was a command that made Rearden follow her back to their car in silence. They were miles beyond the town when he said, not looking at her, his voice desperate and low, \"Dagny, Dagny, Dagny . . . I\u0027m sorry!\" \"I\u0027m not.\" Moments later, when she saw the look of control returning to his face, she said, \"Don\u0027t ever get angry at a man for stating the truth.\" \"That particular truth was none of his business.\" \"His particular estimate of it was none of your concern or mine.\" He said through his teeth, not as an answer, but as if the single thought battering his brain turned into sounds against his will, \u0027T couldn\u0027t protect you from that unspeakable little-\" \"I didn\u0027t need protection.\" He remained silent, not looking at her. \"Hank, when you\u0027re able to keep down the anger, tomorrow or next week, give some thought to that man\u0027s explanation and see if you recognize any part of it.\" He jerked his head to glance at her, but said nothing. When he spoke, a long time later, it was only to say in a tired, even voice, \"We can\u0027t call New York and have our engineers come here to search the factory. We can\u0027t meet them here. We can\u0027t let it be known that we found the motor together. . . . I had forgotten all that . . . up there . . . in the laboratory.\" \"Let me call Eddie, when we find a telephone. I\u0027ll have him send two engineers from the Taggart staff. I\u0027m here alone, on my vacation, for all they\u0027ll know or have to know.\" They drove two hundred miles before they found a long-distance telephone line. When she called Eddie Willers, he gasped, hearing her voice. \"Dagny! For God\u0027s sake, where are you?\" \"In Wisconsin. Why?\" \"1 didn\u0027t know where to reach you. You\u0027d better come back at once. As fast as you can.\" \"What happened?\" \"Nothing-yet. But there are things going on, which . . . You\u0027d better stop them now, if you can. If anybody can.\" \"What things?\" \"Haven\u0027t you been reading the newspapers?\" \"No.\" \"I can\u0027t tell you over the phone. I can\u0027t give you all the details. Dagny, you\u0027ll think I\u0027m insane, but I think they\u0027re planning to kill Colorado.\" \"I\u0027ll come back at once,\" she said. Cut into the granite of Manhattan, under the Taggart Terminal, there were tunnels which had once been used as sidings, at a time when traffic ran in clicking currents through every artery of the Terminal every hour of the day. The need for space had shrunk through the years, with the shrinking of the traffic, and the side tunnels had been abandoned, like dry river beds; a few lights remained as blue patches on the granite over rails left to rust on the ground. Dagny placed the remnant of the motor into a vault in one of the tunnels; the vault had once contained an emergency electric generator, which had been removed long ago. She did not trust the useless young men of the Taggart research staff; there were only two engineers of talent among them, who could appreciate her discovery. She had shared her secret with the two and sent them to search the factory in Wisconsin. Then she had hidden the motor where no one else would know of its existence. When her workers carried the motor down to the vault and departed, she was about to follow them and lock the steel door, but she stopped, key in hand, as if the silence and solitude had suddenly thrown her at the problem she had been facing for days, as if this were the moment to make her decision. Her office car was waiting for her at one of the Terminal platforms, attached to the end of a train due to leave for Washington in a few minutes. She had made an appointment to see Eugene Lawson, but she had told herself that she would cancel it and postpone her quest-if she could think of some action to take against the things she had found on her return to New York, the things Eddie begged her to fight. She had tried to think, but she could see no way of fighting, no rules of battle, no weapons. Helplessness was a strange experience, new to her; she had never found it hard to face things and make decisions; but she was not dealing with things-this was a fog without shapes or definitions, in which something kept forming and shifting before it could be seen, like semi-clots in a not-quite-liquid-it was as if her eyes were reduced to side-vision and she were sensing blurs of disaster coiling toward her, but she could not move her glance, she had no glance to move and focus. The union of Locomotive Engineers was demanding that the maximum speed of all trains on the John Galt Line be reduced to sixty miles an hour. The union of Railway Conductors and Brakemen was demanding that the length of all freight trains on the John Galt Line be reduced to sixty cars. The states of Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona were demanding that the number of trains run in Colorado not exceed the number of trains run in each of these neighboring states. A group headed by Orren Boyle was demanding the passage of a Preservation of Livelihood Law, which would limit the production of Rearden Metal to an amount equal to the output of any other steel mill of equal plant capacity, A group headed by Mr. Mowen was demanding the passage of a Fair Share Law to give every customer who wanted it an equal supply of Rearden Metal. A group headed by Bertram Scudder was demanding the passage of a Public Stability Law, forbidding Eastern business firms to move out of their states. Wesley Mouch, Top Co-ordinator of the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, was issuing a great many statements, the content and purpose of which could not be denned, except that the words \"emergency powers\" and \"unbalanced economy\" kept appearing in the text every few lines. \"Dagny, by what right?\" Eddie Willers had asked her, his voice quiet, but the words sounding like a cry. \"By what right are they all doing it? By what right?\" She had confronted James Taggart in his office and said, \"Jim, this is your battle. I\u0027ve fought mine. You\u0027re supposed to be an expert at dealing with the looters. Stop them.\" Taggart had said, not looking at her, \"You can\u0027t expect to run the national economy to suit your own convenience.\" \"I don\u0027t want to run the national economy! I want your national economy runners to leave me alone! I have a railroad to run-and I know what\u0027s going to happen to your national economy if my railroad collapses!\" \"I see no necessity for panic.\" \"Jim, do I have to explain to you that the income from our Rio Norte Line is all we\u0027ve got, to save us from collapsing? That we need every penny of it, every fare, every carload of freight-as fast as we can get it?\" He had not answered. \"When we have to use every bit of power in every one of our broken-down Diesels, when we don\u0027t have enough of them to give Colorado the service it needs-what\u0027s going to happen if we reduce the speed and the length of trains?\" \"Well, there\u0027s something to be said for the unions\u0027 viewpoint, too. With so many railroads closing and so many railroad men out of work, they feel that those extra speeds you\u0027ve established on the Rio Norte Line are unfair-they feel that there should be more trains, instead, so that the work would be divided around-they feel that it\u0027s not fair for us to get all the benefit of that new rail, they want a share of it, too.\" \"Who wants a share of it? In payment for what?\" He had not answered. \"Who\u0027ll bear the cost of two trains doing the work of one?\" He had not answered. \"Where are you going to get the cars and the engines?\" He had not answered. \"What are those men going to do after they\u0027ve put Taggart Transcontinental out of existence?\" \"I fully intend to protect the interests of Taggart Transcontinental.\" \"How?\" He had not answered. \"How-if you kill Colorado?\" \"It seems to me that before we worry about giving some people a chance to expand, we ought to give some consideration to the people who need a chance of bare survival.\" \"If you kill Colorado, what is there going to be left for your damn looters to survive on?\" \"You have always been opposed to every progressive social measure. I seem to remember that you predicted disaster when we passed the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule-but the disaster has not come.\" \"Because I saved you, you rotten fools! I won\u0027t be able to save you this time!\" He had shrugged, not looking at her. \"And if I don\u0027t, who will?\" He had not answered. It did not seem real to her, here, under the ground. Thinking of it here, she knew she could have no part in Jim\u0027s battle. There was no action she could take against the men of undefined thought, of unnamed motives, of unstated purposes, of unspecified morality. There was nothing she could say to them-nothing would be heard or answered. What were the weapons, she thought, in a realm where reason was not a weapon any longer? It was a realm she could not enter. She had to leave it to Jim and count on his self-interest. Dimly, she felt the chill of a thought telling her that self-interest was not Jim\u0027s motive. She looked at the object before her, a glass case containing the remnant of the motor. The man who made the motor-she thought suddenly, the thought coming like a cry of despair. She felt a moment\u0027s helpless longing to find him, to lean against him and let him tell her what to do. A mind like his would know the way to win this battle. She looked around her. In the clean, rational world of the underground tunnels, nothing was of so urgent an importance as the task of finding the man who made the motor. She thought: Could she delay it in order to argue with Orren Boyle?-to reason with Mr. Mowen?-to plead with Bertram Scudder? She saw the motor, completed, built into an engine that pulled a train of two hundred cars down a track of Rearden Metal at two hundred miles an hour. When the vision was within her reach, within the possible, was she to give it up and spend her time bargaining about sixty miles and sixty cars? She could not descend to an existence where her brain would explode under the pressure of forcing itself not to outdistance incompetence. She could not function to the rule of: Pipe down-keep down-slow down-don\u0027t do your best, it is not wanted! She turned resolutely and left the vault, to take the train for Washington. It seemed to her, as she locked the steel door, that she heard a faint echo of steps. She glanced up and down the dark curve of the tunnel. There was no one in sight; there was nothing but a string of blue lights glistening on walls of damp granite. Rearden could not fight the gangs who demanded the laws. The choice was to fight them or to keep his mills open. He had lost his supply of iron ore. He had to fight one battle or the other. There was no time for both. He had found, on his return, that a scheduled shipment of ore had not been delivered. No word or explanation had been heard from Larkin. When summoned to Rearden\u0027s office, Larkin appeared three days later than the appointment made, offering no apology. He said, not looking at Rearden, his mouth drawn tightly into an expression of rancorous dignity: \"After all, you can\u0027t order people to come running to your office any time you please.\" Rearden spoke slowly and carefully. \"Why wasn\u0027t the ore delivered?\" \"I won\u0027t take abuse, I simply won\u0027t take any abuse for something I couldn\u0027t help. I can run a mine just as well as you ran it, every bit as well, I did everything you did-I don\u0027t know why something keeps going wrong unexpectedly all the time. I can\u0027t be blamed for the unexpected.\" \"To whom did you ship your ore last month?\" \"I intended to ship you your share of it, I fully intended it, but I couldn\u0027t help it if we lost ten days of production last month on account of the rainstorm in the whole of north Minnesota-I intended to ship you the ore, so you can\u0027t blame me, because my intention was completely honest.\" \"If one of my blast furnaces goes down, will I be able to keep it going by feeding your intention into it?\" \"That\u0027s why nobody can deal with you or talk to you-because you\u0027re inhuman.\" \"I have just learned that for the last three months, you have not been shipping your ore by the lake boats, you have been shipping it by rail. Why?\" \"Well, after all, I have a right to run my business as I see fit.\" \"Why are you willing to pay the extra cost?\" \"What do you care? I\u0027m not charging it to you.\" \"What will you do when you find that you can\u0027t afford the rail rates and that you have destroyed the lake shipping?\" \"I am sure you wouldn\u0027t understand any consideration other than dollars and cents, but some people do consider their social and patriotic responsibilities.\" \"What responsibilities?\" \"Well, I think that a railroad like Taggart Transcontinental is essential to the national welfare and it is one\u0027s public duty to support Jim\u0027s Minnesota branch line, which is running at a deficit.\" Rearden leaned forward across the desk; he was beginning to see the links of a sequence he had never understood. \"To whom did you ship your ore last month?\" he asked evenly. \"Well, after all, that is my private business which-\" \"To Orren Boyle, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"You can\u0027t expect people to sacrifice the entire steel industry of the nation to your selfish interests and-\" \"Get out of here,\" said Rearden. He said it calmly. The sequence was clear to him now. \"Don\u0027t misunderstand me, I didn\u0027t mean-\" \"Get out.\" Larkin got out. Then there followed the days and nights of searching a continent by phone, by wire, by plane-of looking at abandoned mines and at mines ready to be abandoned-of tense, rushed conferences held at tables hi the unlighted corners of disreputable restaurants. Looking across the table, Rearden had to decide how much he could risk to invest upon the sole evidence of a man\u0027s face, manner and tone of voice, hating the state of having to hope for honesty as for a favor, but risking it, pouring money into unknown hands in exchange for unsupported promises, into unsigned, unrecorded loans to dummy owners of failing mines- money handed and taken furtively, as an exchange between criminals, in anonymous cash; money poured into unenforceable contracts-both parties knowing that in case of fraud, the defrauded was to be punished, not the defrauder-but poured that a stream of ore might continue flowing into furnaces, that the furnaces might continue to pour a stream of white metal. \"Mr. Rearden,\" asked the purchasing manager of his mills, \"if you keep that up, where will be your profit?\" \"We\u0027ll make it up on tonnage,\" said Rearden wearily. \"We have an unlimited market for Rearden Metal.\" The purchasing manager was an elderly man with graying hair, a lean, dry face, and a heart which, people said, was given exclusively to the task of squeezing every last ounce of value out of a penny. He stood in front of Rearden\u0027s desk, saying nothing else, merely looking straight at Rearden, his cold eyes narrowed and grim. It was a look of the most profound sympathy that Rearden had ever seen. There\u0027s no other course open, thought Rearden, as he had thought through days and nights. He knew no weapons but to pay for what he wanted, to give value for value, to ask nothing of nature without trading his effort in return, to ask nothing of men without trading the product of his effort. What were the weapons, he thought, if values were not a weapon any longer? \"An unlimited market, Mr. Rearden?\" the purchasing manager asked dryly. Rearden glanced up at him. \"I guess I\u0027m not smart enough to make the sort of deals needed nowadays,\" he said, in answer to the unspoken thoughts that hung across his desk. The purchasing manager shook his head. \"No, Mr. Rearden, it\u0027s one or the other. The same kind of brain can\u0027t do both. Either you\u0027re good at running the mills or you\u0027re good at running to Washington.\" \"Maybe I ought to learn their method.\" \"You couldn\u0027t learn it and it wouldn\u0027t do you any good. You wouldn\u0027t win in any of those deals. Don\u0027t you understand? You\u0027re the one who\u0027s got something to be looted.\" When he was left alone, Rearden felt a jolt of blinding anger, as it had come to him before, painful, single and sudden like an electric shock-the anger bursting out of the knowledge that one cannot deal with pure evil, with the naked, full-conscious evil that neither has nor seeks justification. But when he felt the wish to fight and kill in the rightful cause of self-defense-he saw the fat, grinning face of Mayor Bascom and heard the drawling voice saying, \". . . you and the charming lady who is not your wife.\" Then no rightful cause was left, and the pain of anger was turning into the shameful pain of submission. He had no right to condemn anyone-he thought-to denounce anything, to fight and die joyously, claiming the sanction of virtue. The broken promises, the unconfessed desires, the betrayal, the deceit, the lies, the fraud-he was guilty of them all. What form of corruption could he scorn? Degrees do not matter, he thought; one does not bargain about inches of evil. He did not know-as he sat slumped at his desk, thinking of the honesty he could claim no longer, of the sense of justice he had lost- that it was his rigid honesty and ruthless sense of justice that were now knocking his only weapon out of his hands. He would fight the looters, but the wrath and fire were gone. He would fight, but only as one guilty wretch against the others. He did not pronounce the words, but the pain was their equivalent, the ugly pain saying: Who am I to cast the first stone? He let his body fall across the desk. . . . Dagny, he thought, Dagny, if this is the price I have to pay, I\u0027ll pay it. . . . He was still the trader who knew no code except that of full payment for his desires. It was late when he came home and hurried soundlessly up the stairs to his bedroom. He hated himself for being reduced to sneaking, but he had done it on most of his evenings for months. The sight of his family had become unbearable to him; he could not tell why. Don\u0027t hate them for your own guilt, he had told himself, but knew dimly that this was not the root of his hatred. He closed the door of his bedroom like a fugitive winning a moment\u0027s reprieve. He moved cautiously, undressing for bed: he wanted no sound to betray his presence to his family, he wanted no contact with them, not even in their own minds. He had put on his pajamas and stopped to light a cigarette, when the door of his bedroom opened. The only person who could properly enter his room without knocking had never volunteered to enter it, so he stared blankly for a moment before he was able to believe that it was Lillian who came in. She wore an Empire garment of pale chartreuse, its pleated skirt streaming gracefully from its high waistline; one could not tell at first glance whether it was an evening gown or a negligee; it was a negligee. She paused in the doorway, the lines of her body flowing into an attractive silhouette against the light. \"I know I shouldn\u0027t introduce myself to a stranger,\" she said softly, \"but I\u0027ll have to: my name is Mrs. Rearden.\" He could not tell whether it was sarcasm or a plea. She entered and threw the door closed with a casual, imperious gesture, the gesture of an owner. \"What is it, Lillian?\" he asked quietly. \"My dear, you mustn\u0027t confess so much so bluntly\"-she moved in a leisurely manner across the room, past his bed, and sat down in an armchair-\"and so unflatteringly. It\u0027s an admission that I need to show special cause for taking your time. Should I make an appointment through your secretary?\" He stood in the middle of the room, holding the cigarette at his lips, looking at her. volunteering no answer. She laughed. \"My reason is so unusual that I know it will never occur to you: loneliness, darling. Do you mind throwing a few crumbs of your expensive attention to a beggar? Do you mind if I stay here without any formal reason at all?\" \"No,\" he said quietly, \"not if you wish to.\" \"I have nothing weighty to discuss-no million-dollar orders, no transcontinental deals, no rails, no bridges. Not even the political situation. I just want to chatter like a woman about perfectly unimportant things.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Henry, there\u0027s no better way to stop me, is there?\" She had an air of helpless, appealing sincerity. \"What can I say after that? Suppose I wanted to tell you about the new novel which Balph Eubank is writing-he is dedicating it to me-would that interest you?\" \"If it\u0027s the truth that you want-not in the least.\" She laughed. \"And if it\u0027s not the truth that I want?\" \"Then I wouldn\u0027t know what to say,\" he answered-and felt a rush of blood to his brain, tight as a slap, realizing suddenly the double infamy of a lie uttered in protestation of honesty; he had said it sincerely, but it implied a boast to which he had no right any longer. \"Why would you want it, if it\u0027s not the truth?\" he asked. \"What for?\" \"Now you see, that\u0027s the cruelty of conscientious people. You wouldn\u0027t understand it-would you?-if I answered that real devotion consists of being willing to lie, cheat and fake in order to make another person happy-to create for him the reality he wants, if he doesn\u0027t like the one that exists.\" \"No,\" he said slowly, \"I wouldn\u0027t understand it.\" \"It\u0027s really very simple. If you tell a beautiful woman that she is beautiful, what have you given her? It\u0027s no more than a fact and it has cost you nothing. But if you tell an ugly woman that she is beautiful, you offer her the great homage of corrupting the concept of beauty. To love a woman for her virtues is meaningless. She\u0027s earned it, it\u0027s a payment, not a gift. But to love her for her vices is a real gift, unearned and undeserved. To love her for her vices is to defile all virtue for her sake-and that is a real tribute of love, because you sacrifice your conscience, your reason, your integrity and your invaluable self-esteem.\" He looked at her blankly. It sounded like some sort of monstrous corruption that precluded the possibility of wondering whether anyone could mean it; he wondered only what was the point of uttering it. \"What\u0027s love, darling, if it\u0027s not self-sacrifice?\" she went on lightly, in the tone of a drawing-room discussion. \"What\u0027s self-sacrifice, unless one sacrifices that which is one\u0027s most precious and most important? But I don\u0027t expect you to understand it. Not a stainless-steel Puritan like you. That\u0027s the immense selfishness of the Puritan. You\u0027d let the whole world perish rather than soil that immaculate self of yours with a single spot of which you\u0027d have to be ashamed.\" He said slowly, his voice oddly strained and solemn, \"I have never claimed to be immaculate.\" She laughed. \"And what is it you\u0027re being right now? You\u0027re giving me an honest answer, aren\u0027t you?\" She shrugged her naked shoulders. \"Oh, darling, don\u0027t take me seriously! I\u0027m just talking.\" He ground his cigarette into an ashtray; he did not answer. \"Darling,\" she said, \"I actually came here only because I kept thinking that I had a husband and I wanted to find out what he looked like.\" She studied him as he stood across the room, the tall, straight, taut lines of his body emphasized by the single color of the dark blue pajamas. \"You\u0027re very attractive,\" she said. \"You look so much better-these last few months. Younger. Should I say happier? You look less tense. Oh, I know you\u0027re rushed more than ever and you act like a commander in an air raid, but that\u0027s only the surface. You\u0027re less tense-inside.\" He looked at her, astonished. It was true; he had not known it, had not admitted it to himself. He wondered at her power of observation. She had seen little of him in these last few months. He had not entered her bedroom since his return from Colorado. He had thought that she would welcome their isolation from each other. Now he wondered what motive could have made her so sensitive to a change in him-unless it was a feeling much greater than he had ever suspected her of experiencing. \"I was not aware of it,\" he said. \"It\u0027s quite becoming, dear-and astonishing, since you\u0027ve been having such a terribly difficult time.\" He wondered whether this was intended as a question. She paused, as if waiting for an answer, but she did not press it and went on gaily: \"I know you\u0027re having all sorts of trouble at the mills-and then the political situation is getting to be ominous, isn\u0027t it? If they pass those laws they\u0027re talking about, it will hit you pretty hard, won\u0027t it?\" \"Yes. It will. But that is a subject which is of no interest to you, Lillian, is it?\" \"Oh, but it is!\" She raised her head and looked straight at him; her eyes had the blank, veiled look he had seen before, a look of deliberate mystery and of confidence in his inability to solve it. \"It is of great interest to me . . . though not because of any possible financial losses,\" she added softly. He wondered, for the first time, whether her spite, her sarcasm, the cowardly manner of delivering insults under the protection of a smile, were not the opposite of what he had always taken them to be-not a method of torture, but a twisted form of despair, not a desire to make him suffer, but a confession of her own pain, a defense for the pride of an unloved wife, a secret plea-so that the subtle, the hinted, the evasive in her manner, the thing begging to be understood, was not the open malice, but the hidden love. He thought of it, aghast. It made his guilt greater than he had ever contemplated. \"If we\u0027re talking politics, Henry, I had an amusing thought. The side you represent-what is that slogan you all use so much, the motto you\u0027re supposed to stand for? \u0027The sanctity of contract\u0027-is that it?\" She saw his swift glance, the intentness of his eyes, the first response of something she had struck, and she laughed aloud. \"Go on,\" he said; his voice was low; it had the sound of a threat. \"Darling, what for?-since you understood me quite well.\" \"What was it you intended to say?\" His voice was harshly precise and without any color of feeling. \"Do you really wish to bring me to the humiliation of complaining? It\u0027s so trite and such a common complaint-although I did think I had a husband who prides himself on being different from lesser men. Do you want me to remind you that you once swore to make my happiness the aim of your life? And that you can\u0027t really say in all honesty whether I\u0027m happy or unhappy, because you haven\u0027t even inquired whether I exist?\" He felt them as a physical pain-all the things that came tearing at him impossibly together. Her words were a plea, he thought-and he felt the dark, hot flow of guilt. He felt pity-the cold ugliness of pity without affection. He felt a dim anger, like a voice he tried to choke, a voice crying in revulsion: Why should I deal with her rotten, twisted lying?-why should I accept torture for the sake of pity?-why is it I who should have to take the hopeless burden of trying to spare a feeling she won\u0027t admit, a feeling I can\u0027t know or understand or try to guess? -if she loves me, why doesn\u0027t the damn coward say so and let us both face it in the open? He heard another, louder voice, saying evenly: Don\u0027t switch the blame to her, that\u0027s the oldest trick of all cowards-you\u0027re guilty-no matter what she does, it\u0027s nothing compared to your guilt-she\u0027s right-it makes you sick, doesn\u0027t it, to know it\u0027s she who\u0027s right?-let it make you sick, you damn adulterer-it\u0027s she who\u0027s right! \"What would make you happy, Lillian?\" he asked. His voice was toneless. She smiled, leaning back in her chair, relaxing; she had been watching his face intently. \"Oh, dear!\" she said, as in bored amusement. \"That\u0027s the shyster question. The loophole. The escape clause.\" She got up, letting her arms fall with a shrug, stretching her body in a limp, graceful gesture of helplessness. \"What would make me happy, Henry? That is what you ought to tell me. That is what you should have discovered for me. I don\u0027t know. You were to create it and offer it to me. That was your trust, your obligation, your responsibility. But you won\u0027t be the first man to default on that promise. It\u0027s the easiest of all debts to repudiate. Oh, you\u0027d never welsh on a payment for a load of iron ore delivered to you. Only on a life.\" She was moving casually across the room, the green-yellow folds of her skirt coiling in long waves about her, \"I know that claims of this kind are impractical,\" she said. \"I have no mortgage on you, no collateral, no guns, no chains. I have no hold on you at all, Henry-nothing but your honor.\" He stood looking at her as if it took all of his effort to keep his eyes directed at her face, to keep seeing her, to endure the sight. \"What do you want?\" he asked. \"Darling, there are so many things you could guess by yourself, if you really wished to know what I want. For instance, if you have been avoiding me so blatantly for months, wouldn\u0027t I want to know the reason?\" \"I have been very busy.\" She shrugged. \"A wife expects to be the first concern of her husband\u0027s existence. I didn\u0027t know that when you swore to forsake all others, it didn\u0027t include blast furnaces.\" She came closer and, with an amused smile that seemed to mock them both, she slipped her arms around him. It was the swift, instinctive, ferocious gesture of a young bridegroom at the unrequested contact of a whore-the gesture with which he tore her arms off his body and threw her aside. He stood, paralyzed, shocked by the brutality of his own reaction. She was staring at him, her face naked in bewilderment, with no mystery, no pretense or protection; whatever calculations she had made, this was a thing she had not expected. \"I\u0027m sorry, Lillian . . .\" he said, his voice low, a voice of sincerity and of suffering. She did not answer. \"I\u0027m sorry . . . It\u0027s just that I\u0027m very tired,\" he added, his voice lifeless; he was broken by the triple lie, one part of which was a disloyalty he could not bear to face; it was not the disloyalty to Lillian. She gave a brief chuckle. \"Well, if that\u0027s the effect your work has on you, I may come to approve of it. Do forgive me, I was merely trying to do my duty. I thought that you were a sensualist who\u0027d never rise above the instincts of an animal in the gutter. I\u0027m not one of those bitches who belong in it.\" She was snapping the words dryly, absently, without thinking. Her mind was on a question mark, racing over every possible answer. It was her last sentence that made him face her suddenly, face her simply, directly, not as one on the defensive any longer. \"Lillian, what purpose do you live for?\" he asked. \"What a crude question! No enlightened person would ever ask it.\" \"Well, what is it that enlightened people do with their lives?\" \"Perhaps they do not attempt to do anything. That is their enlightenment.\" \"What do they do with their time?\" \"They certainly don\u0027t spend it on manufacturing plumbing pipes.\" \"Tell me, why do you keep making those cracks? I know that you feel contempt for the plumbing pipes. You\u0027ve made that clear long ago. Your contempt means nothing to me. Why keep repeating it?\" He wondered why this hit her; he did not know in what manner, but he knew that it did. He wondered why he felt with absolute certainty that that had been the right thing to say. She asked, her voice dry, \"What\u0027s the purpose of the sudden questionnaire?\" He answered simply, \"I\u0027d like to know whether there\u0027s anything that you really want. If there is, I\u0027d like to give it to you, if I can.\" \"You\u0027d like to buy it? That\u0027s all you know-paying for things. You get off easily, don\u0027t you? No, it\u0027s not as simple as that. What I want is non-material.\" \"What is it?\" \"You.\" \"How do you mean that, Lillian? You don\u0027t mean it in the gutter sense.\" \"No, not in the gutter sense.\" \"How, then?\" She was at the door, she turned, she raised her head to look at him and smiled coldly. \"You wouldn\u0027t understand it,\" she said and walked out. The torture remaining to him was the knowledge that she would never want to leave him and he would never have the right to leave- the thought that he owed her at least the feeble recognition of sympathy, of respect for a feeling he could neither understand nor return-the knowledge that he could summon nothing for her, except contempt, a strange, total, unreasoning contempt, impervious to pity, to reproach, to his own pleas for justice-and, hardest to bear, the proud revulsion against his own verdict, against his demand that he consider himself lower than this woman he despised. Then it did not matter to him any longer, it all receded into some outer distance, leaving only the thought that he was willing to bear anything-leaving him in a state which was both tension and peace-because he lay in bed, his face pressed to the pillow, thinking of Dagny, of her slender, sensitive body stretched beside him, trembling under the touch of his fingers. He wished she were back in New York. If she were, he would have gone there, now, at once, in the middle of the night. Eugene Lawson sat at his desk as if it were the control panel of a bomber plane commanding a continent below. But he forgot it, at times, and slouched down, his muscles going slack inside his suit, as if he were pouting at the world. His mouth was the one part of him which he could not pull tight at any time; it was uncomfortably prominent in his lean face, attracting the eyes of any listener: when he spoke, the movement ran through his lower lip, twisting its moist flesh into extraneous contortions of its own. \"I am not ashamed of it,\" said Eugene Lawson. \"Miss Taggart, I want you to know that I am not ashamed of my past career as president of the Community National Bank of Madison.\" \"I haven\u0027t made any reference to shame,\" said Dagny coldly. \"No moral guilt can be attached to me, inasmuch as I lost everything I possessed in the crash of that bank. It seems to me that I would have the right to feel proud of such a sacrifice.\" \"I merely wanted to ask you some questions about the Twentieth Century Motor Company which-\" \"I shall be glad to answer any questions. I have nothing to hide. My conscience is clear. If you thought that the subject was embarrassing to me, you were mistaken.” \"I wanted to inquire about the men who owned the factory at the time when you made a loan to-\" \"They were perfectly good men. They were a perfectly sound risk-though, of course, I am speaking in human terms, not in the terms of cold cash, which you are accustomed to expect from bankers. I granted them the loan for the purchase of that factory, because they needed the money. If people needed money, that was enough for me. Need was my standard, Miss Taggart. Need, not greed. My father and grandfather built up the Community National Bank just to amass a fortune for themselves. I placed their fortune in the service of a higher ideal. I did not sit on piles of money and demand collateral from poor people who needed loans. The heart was my collateral. Of course, I do not expect anyone in this materialistic country to understand me. The rewards I got were not of a kind that people of your class, Miss Taggart, would appreciate. The people who used to sit in front of my desk at the bank, did not sit as you do, Miss Taggart. They were humble, uncertain, worn with care, afraid to speak. My rewards were the tears of gratitude in their eyes, the trembling voices, the blessings, the woman who kissed my hand when I granted her a loan she had begged for in vain everywhere else.\" \"Will you please tell me the names of the men who owned the motor factory?\" \"That factory was essential to the region, absolutely essential. I was perfectly justified in granting that loan. It provided employment for thousands of workers who had no other means of livelihood.\" \"Did you know any of the people who worked in the factory?\" \"Certainly. I knew them all. It was men that interested me, not machines. I was concerned with the human side of industry, not the cash register side.\" She leaned eagerly across the desk. \"Did you know any of the engineers who worked there?\" \"The engineers? No, no. I was much more democratic than that. It\u0027s the real workers that interested me. The common men. They all knew me by sight. I used to come into the shops and they would wave and shout, \u0027Hello, Gene.\u0027 That\u0027s what they called me-Gene. But I\u0027m sure this is of no interest to you. It\u0027s past history. Now if you really came to Washington in order to talk to me about your railroad\"-he straightened up briskly, the bomber-plane pose returning-\"I don\u0027t know whether I can promise you any special consideration, inasmuch as I must hold the national welfare above any private privileges or interests which-\" \"1 didn\u0027t come to talk to you about my railroad,\" she said, looking at him in bewilderment. \"I have no desire to talk to you about my railroad.\" \"No?\" He sounded disappointed. \"No. I came for information about the motor factory. Could you possibly recall the names of any of the engineers who worked there?\" \"I don\u0027t believe I ever inquired about their names. I wasn\u0027t concerned with the parasites of office and laboratory. I was concerned with the real workers-the men of calloused hands who keep a factory going. They were my friends.\" \"Can you give me a few of their names? Any names, of anyone who worked there?\" \"My dear Miss Taggart, it was so long ago, there were thousands of them, how can I remember?\" \"Can\u0027t you recall one, any one?\" \"I certainly cannot. So many people have always filled my life that I can\u0027t be expected to recall individual drops in the ocean.\" \"Were you familiar with the production of that factory? With the kind of work they were doing-or planning?\" \"Certainly. I took a personal interest in all my investments. I went to inspect that factory very often. They were doing exceedingly well. They were accomplishing wonders. The workers\u0027 housing conditions were the best in the country. I saw lace curtains at every window and flowers on the window sills. Every home had a plot of ground for a garden. They had built a new schoolhouse for the children.\" \"Did you know anything about the work of the factory\u0027s research laboratory?\" \"Yes, yes, they had a wonderful research laboratory, very advanced, very dynamic, with forward vision and great plans.\" \"Do you . . . remember hearing anything about . . . any plans to produce a new type of motor?\" \"Motor? What motor, Miss Taggart? I had no time for details. My objective was social progress, universal prosperity, human brotherhood and love. Love, Miss Taggart. That is the key to everything. If men learned to love one another, it would solve all their problems.\" She turned away, not to see the damp movements of his mouth. A chunk of stone with Egyptian hieroglyphs lay on a pedestal in a corner of the office-the statue of a Hindu goddess with six spider arms stood in a niche-and a huge graph of bewildering mathematical detail, like the sales chart of a mail-order house, hung on the wall. \"Therefore, if you\u0027re thinking of your railroad, Miss Taggart-as, of course, you are, in view of certain possible developments-I must point out to you that although the welfare of the country is my first consideration, to which I would not hesitate to sacrifice anyone\u0027s profits, still, I have never closed my ears to a plea for mercy and-\" She looked at him and understood what it was that he wanted from her, what sort of motive kept him going. \"I don\u0027t wish to discuss my railroad,\" she said, fighting to keep her voice monotonously flat, while she wanted to scream in revulsion. \"Anything you have to say on the subject, you will please say it to my brother, Mr. James Taggart.\" \"I\u0027d think that at a time like this you wouldn\u0027t want to pass up a rare opportunity to plead your case before-\" \"Have you preserved any records pertaining to the motor factory?\" She sat straight, her hands clasped tight together. \"What records? I believe I told you that I lost everything I owned when the bank collapsed.\" His body had gone slack once more, his interest had vanished. \"But I do not mind it. What I lost was mere material wealth. I am not the first man in history to suffer for an ideal. I was defeated by the selfish greed of those around me. I couldn\u0027t establish a system of brotherhood and love in just one small state, amidst a nation of profit-seekers and dollar-grubbers. It was not my fault. But I won\u0027t let them beat me. I am not to be stopped. I am fighting-on a wider scale-for the privilege of serving my fellow men. Records, Miss Taggart? The record I left, when I departed from Madison, is inscribed in the hearts of the poor, who had never had a chance before.\" She did not want to utter a single unnecessary word; but she could not stop herself: she kept seeing the figure of the old charwoman scrubbing the steps. \"Have you seen that section of the country since?\" she asked. \"It\u0027s not my fault!\" he yelled. \"It\u0027s the fault of the rich who still had money, but wouldn\u0027t sacrifice it to save my bank and the people of Wisconsin! You can\u0027t blame me! I lost everything!\" \"Mr. Lawson,\" she said with effort, \"do you perhaps recall the name of the man who headed the corporation that owned the factory? The corporation to which you lent the money. It was called Amalgamated Service, wasn\u0027t it? Who was its president?\" \"Oh, him? Yes, I remember him. His name was Lee Hunsacker. A very worthwhile young man, who\u0027s taken a terrible beating.\" \"Where is he now? Do you know his address?\" \"Why-I believe he\u0027s somewhere in Oregon. Grangeville, Oregon. My secretary can give you his address. But I don\u0027t see of what interest . . . Miss Taggart, if what you have in mind is to try to see Mr. Wesley Mouch, let me tell you that Mr. Mouch attaches a great deal of weight to my opinion in matters affecting such issues as railroads and other-\" \"I have no desire to see Mr. Mouch,\" she said, rising. \"But then, I can\u0027t understand . . . What, really, was your purpose in coming here?\" \"I am trying to find a certain man who used to work for the Twentieth Century Motor Company.\" \"Why do you wish to find him?\" \"I want him to work for my railroad.\" He spread his arms wide, looking incredulous and slightly indignant. \"At such a moment, when crucial issues hang in the balance, you choose to waste your time on looking for some one employee? Believe me, the fate of your railroad depends on Mr. Mouch much more than on any employee you ever find.\" \"Good day,\" she said. She had turned to go, when he said, his voice jerky and high, \"You haven\u0027t any right to despise me.\" She stopped to look at him. \"I have expressed no opinion.\" \"I am perfectly innocent, since I lost my money, since I lost all of my own money for a good cause. My motives were pure. I wanted nothing for myself. I\u0027ve never sought anything for myself. Miss Taggart, I can proudly say that in all of my life I have never made a profit!\" Her voice was quiet, steady and solemn: \"Mr. Lawson, I think I should let you know that of all the statements a man can make, that is the one I consider most despicable.\" \"I never had a chance!\" said Lee Hunsacker. He sat in the middle of the kitchen, at a table cluttered with papers. He needed a shave; his shirt needed laundering. It was hard to judge his age: the swollen flesh of his face looked smooth and blank, untouched by experience; the graying hair and filmy eyes looked worn by exhaustion; he was forty-two. \"Nobody ever gave me a chance. I hope they\u0027re satisfied with what they\u0027ve made of me. But don\u0027t think that I don\u0027t know it. I know I was cheated out of my birthright. Don\u0027t let them put on any airs about how kind they are. They\u0027re a stinking bunch of hypocrites.\" \"Who?\" asked Dagny. \"Everybody,\" said Lee Hunsacker. \"People are bastards at heart and it\u0027s no use pretending otherwise. Justice? Huh! Look at it!\" His arm swept around him. \"A man like me reduced to this!\" Beyond the window, the light of noon looked like grayish dusk among the bleak roofs and naked trees of a place that was not country and could never quite become a town. Dusk and dampness seemed soaked into the walls of the kitchen. A pile of breakfast dishes lay in the sink; a pot of stew simmered on the stove, emitting steam with the greasy odor of cheap meat; a dusty typewriter stood among the papers on the table. \"The Twentieth Century Motor Company,\" said Lee Hunsacker, \"was one of the most illustrious names in the history of American industry. I was the president of that company. I owned that factory. But they wouldn\u0027t give me a chance.\" \"You were not the president of the Twentieth Century Motor Company, were you? I believe you headed a corporation called Amalgamated Service?\" \"Yes, yes, but it\u0027s the same thing. We took over their factory. We were going to do just as well as they did. Better. We were just as important. Who the hell was Jed Starnes anyway? Nothing but a backwoods garage mechanic-did you know that that\u0027s how he started?-without any background at all. My family once belonged to the New York Four Hundred. My grandfather was a member of the national legislature. It\u0027s not my fault that my father couldn\u0027t afford to give me a car of my own, when he sent me to school. All the other boys had cars. My family name was just as good as any of theirs. When I went to college-\" He broke off abruptly. \"What newspaper did you say you\u0027re from?\" She had given him her name; she did not know why she now felt glad that he had not recognized it and why she preferred not to enlighten him. \"I did not say I was from a newspaper,\" she answered, \"I need some information on that motor factory for a private purpose of my own, not for publication.\" \"Oh.\" He looked disappointed. He went on sullenly, as if she were guilty of a deliberate offense against him. \"I thought maybe you came for an advance interview because I\u0027m writing my autobiography.\" He pointed to the papers on the table. \"And what I intend to tell is plenty. I intend-Oh, hell!\" he said suddenly, remembering something. He rushed to the stove, lifted the lid off the pot and went through the motions of stirring the stew, hatefully, paying no attention to his performance. He flung the wet spoon down on the stove, letting the grease drip into the gas burners, and came back to the table. \"Yeah, I\u0027ll write my autobiography if anybody ever gives me a chance,\" he said. \"How can I concentrate on serious work when this is the sort of thing I have to do?\" He jerked his head at the stove. \"Friends, huh! Those people think that just because they took me in, they can exploit me like a Chinese coolie! Just because I had no other place to go. They have it easy, those good old friends of mine. He never lifts a finger around the house, just sits in his store all day; a lousy little two-bit stationery store-can it compare in importance with the book I\u0027m writing? And she goes out shopping and asks me to watch her damn stew for her. She knows that a writer needs peace and concentration, but does she care about that? Do you know what she did today?\" He leaned confidentially across the table, pointing at the dishes in the sink. \"She went to the market and left all the breakfast dishes there and said she\u0027d do them later. I know what she wanted. She expected me to do them. Well, I\u0027ll fool her. I\u0027ll leave them just where they are.\" \"Would you allow me to ask you a few questions about the motor factory?\" \"Don\u0027t imagine that that motor factory was the only thing in my life. I\u0027d held many important positions before. I was prominently connected, at various times, with enterprises manufacturing surgical appliances, paper containers, men\u0027s hats and vacuum cleaners. Of course, that sort of stuff didn\u0027t give me much scope. But the motor factory-that was my big chance. That was what I\u0027d been waiting for.\" \"How did you happen to acquire it?\" \"It was meant for me. It was my dream come true. The factory was shut down-bankrupt. The heirs of Jed Starnes had run it into the ground pretty fast. I don\u0027t know exactly what it was, but there had been something goofy going on up there, so the company went broke. The railroad people closed their branch line. Nobody wanted the place, nobody would bid on it. But there it was, this great factory, with all the equipment, all the machinery, all the things that had made millions for Jed Starnes. That was the kind of setup I wanted, the kind of opportunity I was entitled to. So I got a few friends together and we formed the Amalgamated Service Corporation and we scraped up a little money. But we didn\u0027t have enough, we needed a loan to help us out and give us a start. It was a perfectly safe bet, we were young men embarking on great careers, full of eagerness and hope for the future. “But do you think anybody gave us any encouragement? They did not. Not those greedy, entrenched vultures of privilege! How were we to succeed in life if nobody would give us a factory? We couldn\u0027t compete against the little snots who inherit whole chains of factories, could we? Weren\u0027t we entitled to the same break? Aw, don\u0027t let me hear anything about justice! I worked like a dog, trying to get somebody to lend us the money. But that bastard Midas Mulligan put me through the wringer.\" She sat up straight. \"Midas Mulligan?\" \"Yeah-the banker who looked like a truck driver and acted it, too!\" \"Did you know Midas Mulligan?\" \"Did I know him? I\u0027m the only man who ever beat him-not that it did me any good!\" At odd moments, with a sudden sense of uneasiness, she had wondered-as she wondered about the stories of deserted ships found floating at sea or of sourceless lights flashing in the sky-about the disappearance of Midas Mulligan. There was no reason why she felt that she had to solve these riddles, except that they were mysteries which had no business being mysteries: they could not be causeless, yet no known cause could explain them. Midas Mulligan had once been the richest and, consequently, the most denounced man in the country. He had never taken a loss on any investment he made; everything he touched turned into gold. \"It\u0027s because I know what to touch,\" he said. Nobody could grasp the pattern of his investments: he rejected deals that were considered flawlessly safe, and he put enormous amounts into ventures that no other banker would handle. Through the years, he had been the trigger that had sent unexpected, spectacular bullets of industrial success shooting over the country. It was he who had invested in Rearden Steel at its start, thus helping Rearden to complete the purchase of the abandoned steel mills in Pennsylvania. When an economist referred to him once as an audacious gambler, Mulligan said, \"The reason why you\u0027ll never get rich is because you think that what I do is gambling.\" It was rumored that one had to observe a certain unwritten rule when dealing with Midas Mulligan: if an applicant for a loan ever mentioned his personal need or any personal feeling whatever, the interview ended and he was never given another chance to speak to Mr. Mulligan. \"Why yes, I can,\" said Midas Mulligan, when he was asked whether he could name a person more evil than the man with a heart closed to pity. \"The man who uses another\u0027s pity for him as a weapon.\" In his long career, he had ignored all the public attacks on him, except one. His first name had been Michael; when a newspaper columnist of the humanitarian clique nicknamed him Midas Mulligan and the tag stuck to him as an insult, Mulligan appeared in court and petitioned for a legal change of his first name to \"Midas.\" The petition was granted. In the eyes of his contemporaries, he was a man who had committed the one unforgivable sin: he was proud of his wealth. These were the things Dagny had heard about Midas Mulligan; she had never met him. Seven years ago, Midas Mulligan had vanished. He left his home one morning and was never heard from again. On the next day, the depositors of the Mulligan Bank in Chicago received notices requesting that they withdraw their funds, because the bank was closing. In the investigations that followed, it was learned that Mulligan had planned the closing in advance and in minute detail; his employees were merely carrying out his instructions. It was the most orderly run on a bank that the country ever witnessed. Every depositor received his money down to the last fraction of interest due. All of the bank\u0027s assets had been sold piecemeal to various financial institutions. When the books were balanced, it was found that they balanced perfectly, to the penny; nothing was left over; the Mulligan Bank had been wiped out. No clue was ever found to Mulligan\u0027s motive, to his personal fate or to the many millions of his personal fortune. The man and the fortune vanished as if they had never existed. No one had had any warning about his decision, and no events could be traced to explain it. If he had wished to retire-people wondered-why hadn\u0027t he sold his establishment at a huge profit, as he could have done, instead of destroying it? There was nobody to give an answer. He had no family, no friends. His servants knew nothing: he had left his home that morning as usual and did not come back; that was all. There was-Dagny had thought uneasily for years-a quality of the impossible about Mulligan\u0027s disappearance; it was as if a New York skyscraper had vanished one night, leaving nothing behind but a vacant lot on a street corner. A man like Mulligan, and a fortune such as he had taken along with him, could not stay hidden anywhere; a skyscraper could not get lost, it would be seen rising above any plain or forest chosen for its hiding place; were it destroyed, even its pile of rubble could not remain unnoticed. But Mulligan had gone-and in the seven years since, in the mass of rumors, guesses, theories, Sunday supplement stories, and eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen him in every part of the world, no clue to a plausible explanation had ever been discovered. Among the stories, there was one so preposterously out of character that Dagny believed it to be true: nothing in Mulligan\u0027s nature could have given anyone ground to invent it. It was said that the last person to see him, on the spring morning of his disappearance, was an old woman who sold flowers on a Chicago street corner by the Mulligan Bank. She related that he stopped and bought a bunch of the year\u0027s first bluebells. His face was the happiest face she had ever seen; he had the look of a youth starting out into a great, unobstructed vision of life lying open before him; the marks of pain and tension, the sediment of years upon a human face, had been wiped off, and what remained was only joyous eagerness and peace. He picked up the flowers as if on a sudden impulse, and he winked at the old woman, as if he had some shining joke to share with her. He said, \"Do you know how much I\u0027ve always loved it-being alive?\" She stared at him, bewildered, and he walked away, tossing the flowers like a ball in his hand-a broad, straight figure in a sedate, expensive, businessman\u0027s overcoat, going off into the distance against the straight cliffs of office buildings with the spring sun sparkling on their windows. \"Midas Mulligan was a vicious bastard with a dollar sign stamped on his heart,\" said Lee Hunsacker, in the fumes of the acrid stew. \"My whole future depended upon a miserable half-million dollars, which was just small change to him, bat when I applied for a loan, he turned me down flat-for no better reason than that I had no collateral to offer. How could I have accumulated any collateral, when nobody had ever given me a chance at anything big? Why did he lend money to others, but not to me? It was plain discrimination. He didn\u0027t even care about my feelings-he said that my past record of failures disqualified me for ownership of a vegetable pushcart, let alone a motor factory. What failures? I couldn\u0027t help it if a lot of ignorant grocers refused to co-operate with me about the paper containers. By what right did he pass judgment on my ability? Why did my plans for my own future have to depend upon the arbitrary opinion of a selfish monopolist? I wasn\u0027t going to stand for that. I wasn\u0027t going to take it lying down. I brought suit against him.\" \"You did what?\" \"Oh yes,\" he said proudly, \"I brought suit. I\u0027m sure it would seem strange in some of your hidebound Eastern states, but the state of Illinois had a very humane, very progressive law under which I could sue him. I must say it was the first case of its kind, but I had a very smart, liberal lawyer who saw a way for us to do it. It was an economic emergency law which said that people were forbidden to discriminate for any reason whatever against any person in any matter involving his livelihood. It was used to protect day laborers and such, but it applied to me and my partners as well, didn\u0027t it? So we went to court, and we testified about the bad breaks we\u0027d all had in the past, and I quoted Mulligan saying that I couldn\u0027t even own a vegetable pushcart, and we proved that all the members of the Amalgamated Service corporation had no prestige, no credit, no way to make a living -and, therefore, the purchase of the motor factory was our only chance of livelihood-and, therefore, Midas Mulligan had no right to discriminate against us-and, therefore, we were entitled to demand a loan from him under the law. Oh, we had a perfect case all right, but the man who presided at the trial was Judge Narragansett, one of those old-fashioned monks of the bench who thinks like a mathematician and never feels the human side of anything. He just sat there all through the trial like a marble statue-like one of those blindfolded marble statues, At the end, he instructed the jury to bring in a verdict in favor of Midas Mulligan-and he said some very harsh things about me and my partners. But we appealed to a higher court-and the higher court reversed the verdict and ordered Mulligan to give us the loan on our terms. He had three months in which to comply, but before the three months were up, something happened that nobody can figure out and he vanished into thin air, he and his bank. There wasn\u0027t an extra penny left of that bank, to collect our lawful claim. We wasted a lot of money on detectives, trying to find him-as who didn\u0027t?-but we gave it up.\" No-thought Dagny-no, apart from the sickening feeling it gave her, this case was not much worse than any of the other things that Midas Mulligan had borne for years. He had taken many losses under laws of a similar justice, under rules and edicts that had cost him much larger sums of money; he had borne them and fought and worked the harder; it was not likely that this case had broken him. \"What happened to Judge Narragansett?\" she asked involuntarily, and wondered what subconscious connection had made her ask it. She knew little about Judge Narragansett, but she had heard and remembered his name, because it was a name that belonged so exclusively to the North American continent. Now she realized suddenly that she had heard nothing about him for years. \"Oh, he retired,\" said Lee Hunsacker. \"He did?\" The question was almost a gasp. \"Yeah.\" \"When?\" \"Oh, about six months later.\" \"What did he do after he retired?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think anybody\u0027s heard from him since.\" He wondered why she looked frightened. Part of the fear she felt, was that she could not name its reason, either. \"Please tell me about the motor factory,\" she said with effort. \"Well, Eugene Lawson of the Community National Bank in Madison finally gave us a loan to buy the factory-but he was just a messy cheapskate, he didn\u0027t have enough money to see us through, he couldn\u0027t help us when we went bankrupt. It was not our fault. We had everything against us from the start. How could we run a factory when we had no railroad? Weren\u0027t we entitled to a railroad? I tried to get them to reopen their branch line, but those damn people at Taggart Trans-\" He stopped. \"Say, are you by any chance one of those Taggarts?\" \"I am the Operating Vice-President of Taggart Transcontinental.\" For a moment, he stared at her in blank stupor; she saw the struggle of fear, obsequiousness and hatred in his filmy eyes. The result was a sudden snarl: \"I don\u0027t need any of you big shots! Don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to be afraid of you. Don\u0027t expect me to beg for a job. I\u0027m not asking favors of anybody. I bet you\u0027re not used to hear people talk to you this way, are you?\" \"Mr. Hunsacker, I will appreciate it very much if you will give me the information I need about the factory.\" \"You\u0027re a little late getting interested. What\u0027s the matter? Your conscience bothering you? You people let Jed Starnes grow filthy rich on that factory, but you wouldn\u0027t give us a break. It was the same factory. We did everything he did. We started right in manufacturing the particular type of motor that had been his biggest money-maker for years. And then some newcomer nobody ever heard of opened a two bit factory down in Colorado, by the name of Nielsen Motors, and put out a new motor of the same class as the Starnes model, at half the price! We couldn\u0027t help that, could we? It was all right for Jed Starnes, no destructive competitor happened to come up in his time, but what were we to do? How could we fight this Nielsen, when nobody had given us a motor to compete with his?\" \"Did you take over the Starnes research laboratory?\" \"Yes, yes, it was there. Everything was there.\" \"His staff, too?\" \"Oh, some of them. A lot of them had gone while the factory was closed.\" \"His research staff?\" \"They were gone.\" \"Did you hire any research men of your own?\" \"Yes, yes, some-but let me tell you, I didn\u0027t have much money to spend on such things as laboratories, when I never had enough funds to give me a breathing spell. I couldn\u0027t even pay the bills I owed for the absolutely essential modernizing and redecorating which I\u0027d had to do -that factory was disgracefully old-fashioned from the standpoint of human efficiency. The executive offices had bare plaster walls and a dinky little washroom. Any modern psychologist will tell you that nobody could do his best in such depressing surroundings. I had to have a brighter color scheme in my office, and a decent modern bathroom with a stall shower. Furthermore, I spent a lot of money on a new cafeteria and a playroom and rest room for the workers. We had to have morale, didn\u0027t we? Any enlightened person knows that man is made by the material factors of his background, and that a man\u0027s mind is shaped by his tools of production. But people wouldn\u0027t wait for the laws of economic determinism to operate upon us. We never had a motor factory before. We had to let the tools condition our minds, didn\u0027t we? But nobody gave us time.\" \"Can you tell me about the work of your research staff?\" \"Oh, I had a group of very promising young men, all of them guaranteed by diplomas from the best universities. But it didn\u0027t do me any good. I don\u0027t know what they were doing. I think they were just sitting around, eating up their salaries.\" \"Who was in charge of your laboratory?\" \"Hell, how can I remember that now?\" \"Do you remember any of the names of your research staff?\" \"Do you think I had time to meet every hireling in person?\" \"Did any of them ever mention to you any experiments with a . . . with an entirely new kind of motor?\" \"What motor? Let me tell you that an executive of my position does not hang around laboratories. I spent most of my time in New York and Chicago, trying to raise money to keep us going.\" \"Who was the general manager of tie factory?\" \"A very able fellow by the name of Roy Cunningham. He died last year in an auto accident. Drunk driving, they said.\" \"Can you give me the names and addresses of any of your associates? Anyone you remember?\" \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s become of them. I wasn\u0027t in a mood to keep track of that.\" \"Have you preserved any of the factory records?\" \"I certainly have.\" She sat up eagerly. \"Would you let me see them?\" \"You bet!\" He seemed eager to comply; he rose at once and hurried out of the room. What he put down before her, when he returned, was a thick album of clippings: it contained his newspaper interviews and his press agent\u0027s releases. \"I was one of the big industrialists, too,\" he said proudly. \"I was a national figure, as you can see. My life will make a book of deep, human significance. I\u0027d have written it long ago, if I had the proper tools of production.\" He banged angrily upon his typewriter. \"I can\u0027t work on this damn thing. It skips spaces. How can I get any inspiration and write a best seller with a typewriter that skips spaces?\" \"Thank you, Mr. Hunsacker,\" she said. \"I believe this is all you can tell me.\" She rose. \"You don\u0027t happen to know what became of the Starnes heirs?\" \"Oh, they ran for cover after they\u0027d wrecked the factory. There were three of them, two sons and a daughter. Last I heard, they were hiding their faces out in Durance, Louisiana.\" The last sight she caught of Lee Hunsacker, as she turned to go, was his sudden leap to the stove; he seized the lid off the pot and dropped it to the floor, scorching his fingers and cursing: the stew was burned. Little was left of the Starnes fortune and less of the Starnes heirs. \"You won\u0027t like having to see them, Miss Taggart,\" said the chief of police of Durance, Louisiana; he was an elderly man with a slow, firm manner and a look of bitterness acquired not in blind resentment., but in fidelity to clear-cut standards. \"There\u0027s all sorts of human beings to see in the world, there\u0027s murderers and criminal maniacs-but, somehow, I think these Starnes persons are what decent people shouldn\u0027t have to see. They\u0027re a bad sort, Miss Taggart. Clammy and bad . . . “Yes, they\u0027re still here in town-two of them, that is. The third one is: dead. Suicide. That was four years ago. It\u0027s an ugly story. He was the youngest of the three, Eric Starnes. He was one of those chronic young men who go around whining about their sensitive feelings, when they\u0027re well past forty. He needed love, was his line. He was being kept by older women, when he could find them. Then he started running after a girl of sixteen, a nice girl who wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with him. “She married a boy she was engaged to. Eric Starnes got into their house on the wedding day, and when they came back from church after the ceremony, they found him in their bedroom, dead, messy dead, his wrists slashed. . . . Now I say there might be forgiveness for a man who kills himself quietly. Who can pass judgment on another man\u0027s suffering and on the limit of what he can bear? But the man who kills himself, making a show of his death in order to hurt somebody, the man who gives his life for malice-there\u0027s no forgiveness for him, no excuse, he\u0027s rotten clear through, and what he deserves is that people spit at his memory, instead of feeling sorry for him and hurt, as he wanted them to be. . . . Well, that was Eric Starnes. I can tell you where to find the other two, if you wish.\" She found Gerald Starnes in the ward of a flophouse. He lay half twisted on a cot. His hair was still black, but the white stubble of his chin was like a mist of dead weeds over a vacant face. He was soggy drunk. A pointless chuckle kept breaking his voice when he spoke, the sound of a static, unfocused malevolence, \"It went bust, the great factory. That\u0027s what happened to it. Just went up and bust. Does that bother you, madam? The factory was rotten. Everybody is rotten. I\u0027m supposed to beg somebody\u0027s pardon, but I won\u0027t. I don\u0027t give a damn. People get fits trying to keep up the show, when it\u0027s all rot, black rot, the automobiles, the buildings and the souls, and it doesn\u0027t make any difference, one way or another. You should\u0027ve seen the kind of literati who turned flip-flops when I whistled, when I had the dough. The professors, the poets, the intellectuals, the world-savers and the brother-lovers. Any way I whistled. I had lots of fun. I wanted to do good, but now I don\u0027t. There isn\u0027t any good. Not any goddamn good in the whole goddamn universe. I don\u0027t propose to take a bath if I don\u0027t feel like it, and that\u0027s that. If you want to know anything about the factory, ask my sister. My sweet sister who had a trust fund they couldn\u0027t touch, so she got out of it safe, even if she\u0027s in the hamburger class now, not the filet mignon a la Sauce Bearnaise, but would she give a penny of it to her brother? The noble plan that busted was her idea as much as mine, but will she give me a penny? Hah! Go take a look at the duchess, take a look. What do I care about the factory? It was just a pile of greasy machinery. I\u0027ll sell you all my rights, claims and title to it-for a drink. I\u0027m the last of the Starnes name. It used to be a great name-Starnes. I\u0027ll sell it to you. You think I\u0027m a stinking bum, but that goes for all the rest of them and for rich ladies like you, too. I wanted to do good for humanity. Hah! I wish they\u0027d all boil in oil. Be lots of fun. I wish they\u0027d choke. What does it matter? What does anything matter?\" On the next cot, a white-haired, shriveled little tramp turned in his sleep, moaning; a nickel clattered to the floor out of his rags. Gerald Starnes picked it up and slipped it into his own pocket. He glanced at Dagny. The creases of his face were a malignant smile. \"Want to wake him up and start trouble?\" he asked. \"If you do, I\u0027ll say that you\u0027re lying.\" The ill-smelling bungalow, where she found Ivy Starnes, stood on the edge of town, by the shore of the Mississippi. Hanging strands of moss and clots of waxy foliage made the thick vegetation look as if it were drooling; the too many draperies, hanging in the stagnant air of a small room, had the same look. The smell came from undusted corners and from incense burning in silver jars at the feet of contorted Oriental deities. Ivy Starnes sat on a pillow like a baggy Buddha. Her mouth was a tight little crescent, the petulant mouth of a child demanding adulation-on the spreading, pallid face of a woman past fifty. Her eyes were two lifeless puddles of water. Her voice had the even, dripping monotone of rain: \"I can\u0027t answer the kind of questions you\u0027re asking, my girl. The research laboratory? The engineers? Why should I remember anything about them? It was my father who was concerned with such matters, not I, My father was an evil man who cared for nothing but business. He had no time for love, only for money. My brothers and I lived on a different plane. Our aim was not to produce gadgets, but to do good. We brought a great, new plan into the factory. It was eleven years ago. We were defeated by the greed, the selfishness and the base, animal nature of men. It was the eternal conflict between spirit and matter, between soul and body. They would not renounce their bodies, which was all we asked of them. I do not remember any of those men. I do not care to remember. . . . The engineers? I believe it was they who started the hemophilia. . . . Yes, that is what I said: the hemophilia-the slow leak-the loss of blood that cannot be stopped. They ran first. “They deserted us, one after another . . . Our plan? We put into practice that noble historical precept: From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. Everybody in the factory, from charwomen to president, received the same salary-the barest minimum necessary. Twice a year, we all gathered in a mass meeting, where every person presented his claim for what he believed to be his needs. We voted on every claim, and the will of the majority established every person\u0027s need and every person\u0027s ability. The income of the factory was distributed accordingly. Rewards were based on need, and penalties on ability. Those whose needs were voted to be the greatest, received the most. Those who had not produced as much as the vote said they could, were fined and had to pay the fines by working overtime without pay. That was our plan. It was based on the principle of selflessness. It required men to be motivated, not by personal gain, but by love for their brothers.\" Dagny heard a cold, implacable voice saying somewhere within her: Remember it-remember it well-it is not often that one can see pure evil-look at it-remember-and some day you\u0027ll find the words to name its essence. . . . She heard it through the screaming of other voices that cried in helpless violence: It\u0027s nothing-I\u0027ve heard it before -I\u0027m hearing it everywhere-it\u0027s nothing but the same old tripe-why can\u0027t I stand it?-I can\u0027t stand it-I can\u0027t stand it! \"What\u0027s the matter with you, my girl? Why did you jump up like that? Why are you shaking? . . . What? Do speak louder, I can\u0027t hear you. . . . How did the plan work out? I do not care to discuss it. Things became very ugly indeed and went fouler every year. It has cost me my faith in human nature. In four years, a plan conceived, not by the cold calculations of the mind, but by the pure love of the heart, was brought to an end in the sordid mess of policemen, lawyers and bankruptcy proceedings. But I have seen my error and I am free of it, I am through with the world of machines, manufacturers and money, the world enslaved by matter. I am learning the emancipation of the spirit, as revealed in the great secrets of India, the release from bondage to flesh, the victory over physical nature, the triumph of the spirit over matter.\" Through the blinding white glare of anger, Dagny was seeing a long strip of concrete that had been a road, with weeds rising from its cracks, and the figure of a man contorted by a hand plow. \"But, my girl, I said that I do not remember. . . . But I do not know their names, I do not know any names, I do not know what sort of adventurers my father may have had in that laboratory! . . .Don\u0027t you hear me? . . . I am not accustomed to being questioned in such manner and . . . Don\u0027t keep repeating it. Don\u0027t you know any words but \u0027engineer\u0027? . . . Don\u0027t you hear me at all? . . . What\u0027s the matter with you? I-I don\u0027t like your face, you\u0027re . . . Leave me alone. I don\u0027t know who you are, I\u0027ve never hurt you, I\u0027m an old woman, don\u0027t look at me like that, I . . . Stand back! Don\u0027t come near me or I\u0027ll call for help! I\u0027ll . . . Oh, yes, yes, I know that one! The chief engineer. Yes. He was the head of the laboratory. Yes. William Hastings. That was his name-William Hastings. I remember. He went off to Brandon, Wyoming. He quit the day after we introduced the plan. He was the second man to quit us. . . . No. No, I don\u0027t remember who was the first. He wasn\u0027t anybody important.\" The woman who opened the door had graying hair and a poised, distinguished look of grooming; it took Dagny a few seconds to realize that her garment was only a simple cotton housedress, \"May I see Mr. William Hastings?\" asked Dagny. The woman looked at her for the briefest instant of a pause; it was an odd glance, inquiring and grave. \"May I ask your name?\" \"I am Dagny Taggart, of Taggart Transcontinental.\" \"Oh. Please come in, Miss Taggart. I am Mrs. William Hastings.\" The measured tone of gravity went through every syllable of her voice, like a warning. Her manner was courteous, but she did not smile. It was a modest home in the suburbs of an industrial town. Bare tree branches cut across the bright, cold blue of the sky, on the top of the rise that led to the house. The walls of the living room were silver-gray; sunlight hit the crystal stand of a lamp with a white shade; beyond an open door, a breakfast nook was papered in red-dotted white. \"Were you acquainted with my husband in business, Miss Taggart?\" \"No. I have never met Mr. Hastings. But I should like to speak to him on a matter of business of crucial importance.\" \"My husband died five years ago, Miss Taggart.\" Dagny closed her eyes; the dull, sinking shock contained the conclusions she did not have to make in words: This, then, had been the man she was seeking, and Rearden had been right; this was why the motor had been left unclaimed on a junk pile. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said, both to Mrs. Hastings and to herself. The suggestion of a smile on Mrs. Hastings\u0027 face held sadness, but the face had no imprint of tragedy, only a grave look of firmness, acceptance and quiet serenity. \"Mrs. Hastings, would you permit me to ask you a few questions?\" \"Certainly. Please sit down.\" \"Did you have some knowledge of your husband\u0027s scientific work?\" \"Very little. None, really. He never discussed it at home.\" \"He was, at one time, chief engineer of the Twentieth Century Motor Company?\" \"Yes. He had been employed by them for eighteen years.\" \"I wanted to ask Mr. Hastings about his work there and the reason why he gave it up. If you can tell me, I would like to know what happened in that factory.\" The smile of sadness and humor appeared fully on Mrs. Hastings\u0027 face. \"That is what I would like to know myself,\" she said. \"But I\u0027m afraid I shall never learn it now. I know why he left the factory. It was because of an outrageous scheme which the heirs of led Starnes established there. He would not work on such terms or for such people. But there was something else. I\u0027ve always felt that something happened at Twentieth Century Motors, which he would not tell me.\" \"I\u0027m extremely anxious to know any clue you may care to give me.\" \"I have no clue to it. I\u0027ve tried to guess and given up. I cannot understand or explain it. But I know that something happened. When my husband left Twentieth Century, we came here and he took a job as head of the engineering department of Acme Motors. It was a growing, successful concern at the time. It gave my husband the kind of work he liked. He was not a person prone to inner conflicts, he had always been sure of his actions and at peace with himself. But for a whole year after we left Wisconsin, he acted as if he were tortured by something, as if he were struggling with a personal problem he could not solve. At the end of that year, he came to me one morning and told me that he had resigned from Acme Motors, that he was retiring and would not work anywhere else. He loved his work; it was his whole life. Yet he looked calm, self-confident and happy, for the first time since we\u0027d come here. He asked me not to question him about the reason of his decision. I didn\u0027t question him and I didn\u0027t object. We had this house, we had our savings, we had enough to live on modestly for the rest of our days. I never learned his reason. We went on living here, quietly and very happily. He seemed to feel a profound contentment. He had an odd serenity of spirit that I had never seen in him before. There was nothing strange in his behavior or activity-except that at times, Very rarely, he went out without telling me where he went or whom he saw. In the last two years of his life, he went away for one month, each summer; he did not tell me where. Otherwise, he lived as he always had. He studied a great deal and he spent his time on engineering research of his own, working in the basement of our house. I don\u0027t know what he did with his notes and experimental models. I found no trace of them in the basement, after his death. He died five years ago, of a heart ailment from which he had suffered for some time.\" Dagny asked hopelessly, \"Did you know the nature of his experiments?\" \"No. I know very little about engineering.\" \"Did you know any of his professional friends or co-workers, who might have been acquainted with his research?\" \"No. When he was at Twentieth Century Motors, he worked such long hours that we had very little time for ourselves and we spent it together. We had no social life at all. He never brought his associates to the house.\" \"When he was at Twentieth Century, did he ever mention to you a motor he had designed, an entirely new type of motor that could have changed the course of all industry?\" \"A motor? Yes. Yes, he spoke of it several times. He said it was an invention of incalculable importance. But it was not he who had designed it. It was the invention of a young assistant of his.\" She saw the expression on Dagny\u0027s face, and added slowly, quizzically, without reproach, merely in sad amusement, \"I see.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry!\" said Dagny, realizing that her emotion had shot to her face and become a smile as obvious as a cry of relief. \"It\u0027s quite all right. I understand. It\u0027s the inventor of that motor that you\u0027re interested in. I don\u0027t know whether he is still alive, but at least I have no reason to think that he isn\u0027t.\" \"I\u0027d give half my life to know that he is-and to find him. It\u0027s as important as that, Mrs. Hastings. Who is he?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know his name or anything about him. I never knew any of the men on my husband\u0027s staff. He told me only that he had a young engineer who, some day, would up-turn the world. My husband did not care for anything in people except ability. I think this was the only man he ever loved. He didn\u0027t say so, but I could tell it, just by the way he spoke of this young assistant. I remember-the day he told me that the motor was completed-how his voice sounded when he said, \u0027And he\u0027s only twenty-six!\u0027 This was about a month before the death of Jed Starnes. He never mentioned the motor or the young engineer, after that.\" \"You don\u0027t know what became of the young engineer?\" \"No.\" \"You can\u0027t suggest any way to find him?\" \"No.\" \"You have no clue, no lead to help me learn his name?\" \"None. Tell me, was that motor extremely valuable?\" \"More valuable than any estimate I could give you.\" \"It\u0027s strange, because, you see, I thought of it once, some years after we\u0027d left Wisconsin, and I asked my husband what had become of that invention he\u0027d said was so great, what would be done with it. He looked at me very oddly and answered, \u0027Nothing.\u0027 \" \"Why?\" \"He wouldn\u0027t tell me.\" \"Can you remember anyone at all who worked at Twentieth Century? Anyone who knew that young engineer? Any friend of his?\" \"No, I . . . Wait! Wait, I think I can give you a lead. I can tell you where to find one friend of his. I don\u0027t even know that friend\u0027s name, either, but I know his address. It\u0027s an odd story. I\u0027d better explain how it happened. One evening-about two years after we\u0027d come here-my husband was going out and I needed our car that night, so he asked me to pick him up after dinner at the restaurant of the railroad station. He did not tell me with whom he was having dinner. When I drove up to the station, I saw him standing outside the restaurant with two men. One of them was young and tall. The other was elderly; he looked very distinguished. I would still recognize those men anywhere; they had the kind of faces one doesn\u0027t forget. My husband saw me and left them. They walked away toward the station platform; there was a train coming. My husband pointed after the young man and said, \u0027Did you see him? That\u0027s the boy I told you about.1 \u0027The one who\u0027s the great maker of motors?\u0027 The one who was.\u0027 \" \"And he told you nothing else?\" \"Nothing else. This was nine years ago. Last spring, I went to visit my brother who lives in Cheyenne. One afternoon, he took the family out for a long drive. We went up into pretty wild country, high in the Rockies, and we stopped at a roadside diner. There was a distinguished, gray-haired man behind the counter. I kept staring at him while he fixed our sandwiches and coffee, because I knew that I had seen his face before, but could not remember where. We drove on, we were miles away from the diner, when I remembered. You\u0027d better go there. It\u0027s on Route 86, in the mountains, west of Cheyenne, near a small industrial settlement by the Lennox Copper Foundry. It seems strange, but I\u0027m certain of it: the cook in that diner is the man I saw at the railroad station with my husband\u0027s young idol.\" The diner stood on the summit of a long, hard climb. Its glass walls spread a coat of polish over the view of rocks and pines descending in broken ledges to the sunset. It was dark below, but an even, glowing light still remained in the diner, as in a small pool left behind by a receding tide. Dagny sat at the end of the counter, eating a hamburger sandwich. It was the best-cooked food she had ever tasted, the product of simple ingredients and of an unusual skill. Two workers were finishing their dinner; she was waiting for them to depart. She studied the man behind the counter. He was slender and tall; he had an air of distinction that belonged in an ancient castle or in the inner office of a bank; but his peculiar quality came from the fact that he made the distinction seem appropriate here, behind the counter of a diner. He wore a cook\u0027s white jacket as if it were a full-dress suit. There was an expert competence in his manner of working; his movements were easy, intelligently economical. He had a lean face and gray hair that blended in tone with the cold blue of his eyes; somewhere beyond his look of courteous sternness, there was a note of humor, so faint that it vanished if one tried to discern it. The two workers finished, paid and departed, each leaving a dime for a tip. She watched the man as he removed their dishes, put the dimes into the pocket of his white jacket, wiped the counter, working with swift precision. Then he turned and looked at her. It was an impersonal glance, not intended to invite conversation; but she felt certain that he had long since noted her New York suit, her high-heeled pumps, her air of being a woman who did not waste her time; his cold, observant eyes seemed to tell her that he knew she did not belong here and that he was waiting to discover her purpose. \"How is business?\" she asked. \"Pretty bad. They\u0027re going to close the Lennox Foundry next week, so I\u0027ll have to close soon, too, and move on.\" His voice was clear, impersonally cordial. \"Where to?\" \"I haven\u0027t decided.\" \"What sort of thing do you have in mind?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m thinking of opening a garage, if I can find the right spot in some town.\" \"Oh no! You\u0027re too good at your job to change it. You shouldn\u0027t want to be anything but a cook.\" A strange, fine smile moved the curve of his mouth. \"No?\" he asked courteously. \"No! How would you like a job in New York?\" He looked at her, astonished. \"I\u0027m serious. I can give you a job on a big railroad, in charge of the dining-car department.\" \"May I ask why you should want to?\" She raised the hamburger sandwich in its white paper napkin. \"There\u0027s one of the reasons.\" \"Thank you. What are the others?\" \u0027T don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve lived in a big city, or you\u0027d know how miserably difficult it is to find any competent men for any job whatever.\" \"I know a little about that.\" \"Well? How about it, then? Would you like a job in New York at ten thousand dollars a year?\" \"No.\" She had been carried away by the joy of discovering and rewarding ability. She looked at him silently, shocked. \"I don\u0027t think you understood me,\" she said. \"I did.\" \"You\u0027re refusing an opportunity of this kind?\" \"Yes.\" \"But why?\" \"That is a personal matter.\" \"Why should you work like this, when you can have a better job?\" \"I am not looking for a better job.\" \"You don\u0027t want a chance to rise and make money?\" \"No. Why do you insist?\" \"Because I hate to see ability being wasted!\" He said slowly, intently, \"So do I.\" Something in the way he said it made her feel the bond of some profound emotion which they held in common; it broke the discipline that forbade her ever to call for help. \"I\u0027m so sick of them!\" Her voice startled hen it was an involuntary cry. \"I\u0027m so hungry for any sight of anyone who\u0027s able to do whatever it is he\u0027s doing!\" She pressed the back of her hand to her eyes, trying to dam the outbreak of a despair she had not permitted herself to acknowledge; she had not known the extent of it, nor how little of her endurance the quest had left her. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, his voice low. It sounded, not as an apology, but as a statement of compassion. She glanced up at him. He smiled, and she knew that the smile was intended to break the bond which he, too, had felt: the smile had a trace of courteous mockery. He said, \"But I don\u0027t believe that you came all the way from New York just to hunt for railroad cooks in the Rockies.\" \"No. I came for something else.\" She leaned forward, both forearms braced firmly against the counter, feeling calm and in tight control again, sensing a dangerous adversary. \"Did you know, about ten years ago, a young engineer who worked for the Twentieth Century Motor Company?\" She counted the seconds of a pause; she could not define the nature of the way he looked at her, except that it was the look of some special attentiveness. \"Yes, I did,\" he answered. \"Could you give me his name and address?\" \"What for?\" \"It\u0027s crucially important that I find him.\" \"That man? Of what importance is he?\" \"He is the most important man in the world.\" \"Really? Why?\" \"Did you know anything about his work?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you know that he hit upon an idea of the most tremendous consequence?\" He let a moment pass. \"May I ask who you are?\" \"Dagny Taggart. I\u0027m the Vice-Pres-\" \"Yes, Miss Taggart. I know who you are.\" He said it with impersonal deference. But he looked as if he had found the answer to some special question in his mind and was not astonished any longer. \"Then you know that my interest is not idle,\" she said. \"I\u0027m in a position to give him the chance he needs and I\u0027m prepared to pay anything he asks.\" \"May I ask what has aroused your interest in him?\" \"His motor.\" \"How did you happen to know about his motor?\" \"I found a broken remnant of it in the ruins of the Twentieth Century factory. Not enough to reconstruct it or to learn how it worked, But enough to know that it did work and that it\u0027s an invention which can save my railroad, the country and the economy of the whole world. Don\u0027t ask me to tell you now what trail I\u0027ve followed, trying to trace that motor and to find its inventor. That\u0027s not of any importance, even my life and work are not of any importance to me right now, nothing is of any importance, except that I must find him. Don\u0027t ask me how I happened to come to you. You\u0027re the end of the trail. Tell me his name.\" He had listened without moving, looking straight at her; the attentiveness of his eyes seemed to take hold of every word and store it carefully away, giving her no clue to his purpose. He did not move for a long time. Then he said, \"Give it up, Miss Taggart. You won\u0027t find him.\" \"What is his name?\" \"I can tell you nothing about him.\" \"Is he still alive?\" \"I can tell you nothing.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Hugh Akston.\" Through the blank seconds of recapturing her mind, she kept telling herself: You\u0027re hysterical . . . don\u0027t be preposterous . . . it\u0027s just a coincidence of names-while she knew, in certainty and numb, inexplicable terror, that this was the Hugh Akston. \"Hugh Akston?\" she stammered. \"The philosopher? . . . The last of the advocates of reason?\" \"Why, yes,\" he answered pleasantly. \"Or the first of their return.\" He did not seem startled by her shock, but he seemed to find it unnecessary. His manner was simple, almost friendly, as if he felt no need to hide his identity and no resentment at its being discovered. \"I didn\u0027t think that any young person would recognize my name or attach any significance to it, nowadays,\" he said. \"But . . . but what are you doing here?\" Her arm swept at the room. \"This doesn\u0027t make sense!\" \"Are you sure?\" \"What is it? A stunt? An experiment? A secret mission? Are you studying something for some special purpose?\" \"No, Miss Taggart. I\u0027m earning my living.\" The words and the voice had the genuine simplicity of truth, \"Dr. Akston, I . . . it\u0027s inconceivable, it\u0027s . . . You\u0027re . . . you\u0027re a philosopher . . . the greatest philosopher living . . . an immortal name . . . why would you do this?\" \"Because I am a philosopher, Miss Taggart.\" She knew with certainty-even though she felt as if her capacity for certainty and for understanding were gone-that she would obtain no help from him, that questions were useless, that he would give her no explanation, neither of the inventor\u0027s fate nor of his own. \"Give it up, Miss Taggart,\" he said quietly, as if giving proof that he could guess her thoughts, as she had known he would. \"It is a hopeless quest, the more hopeless because you have no inkling of what an impossible task you have chosen to undertake. I would like to spare you the strain of trying to devise some argument, trick or plea that would make me give you the information you are seeking. Take my word for it: it can\u0027t be done. You said I\u0027m the end of your trail. It\u0027s a blind alley, Miss Taggart, Do not attempt to waste your money and effort on other, more conventional methods of inquiry: do not hire detectives. They will learn nothing. You may choose to ignore my warning, but I think that you are a person of high intelligence, able to know that I know what I am saying. Give it up. The secret you are trying to solve involves something greater-much greater-than the invention of a motor run by atmospheric electricity. There is only one helpful suggestion that I can give you: By the essence and nature of existence, contradictions cannot exist. If you find it inconceivable that an invention of genius should be abandoned among ruins, and that a philosopher should wish to work as a cook in a diner-check your premises. You will find that one of them is wrong.\" She started: she remembered that she had heard this before and that it was Francisco who had said it. And then she remembered that this man had been one of Francisco\u0027s teachers. \"As you wish, Dr. Akston,\" she said. \"I won\u0027t attempt to question you about it. But would you permit me to ask you a question on an entirely different subject?\" \"Certainly.\" \"Dr. Robert Stadler once told me that when you were at the Patrick Henry University, you had three students who were your favorites and his, three brilliant minds from whom you expected a great future. One of them was Francisco d\u0027Anconia.\" \"Yes. Another was Ragnar Danneskjold.\" \"Incidentally-this is not my question-who was the third?\" \"His name would mean nothing to you. He is not famous.\" \"Dr. Stadler said that you and he were rivals over these three students, because you both regarded them as your sons.\" \"Rivals? He lost them.\" \"Tell me, are you proud of the way these three have turned out?\" He looked off, into the distance, at the dying fire of the sunset on the farthest rocks; his face had the look of a father who watches his sons bleeding on a battlefield. He answered: \"More proud than I had ever hoped to be,\" It was almost dark. He turned sharply, took a package of cigarettes from his pocket, pulled out one cigarette, but stopped, remembering her presence, as if he had forgotten it for a moment, and extended the package to her. She took a cigarette and he struck the brief flare of a match, then shook it out, leaving only two small points of fire in the darkness of a glass room and of miles of mountains beyond it. She rose, paid her bill, and said, \"Thank you, Dr. Akston. I will not molest you with tricks or pleas. I will not hire detectives. But I think I should tell you that I will not give up, I must find the inventor of that motor. I will find him.\" \"Not until the day when he chooses to find you-as he will.\" When she walked to her car, he switched on the lights in the diner, she saw the mailbox by the side of the road and noted the incredible fact that the name \"Hugh Akston\" stood written openly across it. She had driven far down the winding road, and the lights of the diner were long since out of sight, when she noticed that she was enjoying the taste of the cigarette he had given her: it was different from any she had ever smoked before. She held the small remnant to the light of the dashboard, looking for the name of the brand. There was no name, only a trademark. Stamped in gold on the thin, white paper there stood the sign of the dollar. She examined it curiously: she had never heard of that brand before. Then she remembered the old man at the cigar stand of the Taggart Terminal, and smiled, thinking that this was a specimen for his collection. She stamped out the fire and dropped the butt into her handbag. Train Number 57 was lined along the track, ready to leave for Wyatt Junction, when she reached Cheyenne, left her car at the garage where she had rented it, and walked out on the platform of the Taggart station. She had half an hour to wait for the eastbound main liner to New York. She walked to the end of the platform and leaned wearily against a lamppost; she did not want to be seen and recognized by the station employees, she did not want to talk to anyone, she needed rest. A few people stood in clusters on the half-deserted platform; animated conversations seemed to be going on, and newspapers were more prominently in evidence than usual. She looked at the lighted windows of Train Number 57-for a moment\u0027s relief in the sight of a victorious achievement. Train Number 57 was about to start down the track of the John Galt Line, through the towns, through the curves of the mountains, past the green signals where people had stood cheering and the valleys where rockets had risen to the summer sky. Twisted remnants of leaves now hung on the branches beyond the train\u0027s roof line, and the passengers wore furs and mufflers, as they climbed aboard. They moved with the casual manner of a daily event, with the security of expecting a performance long since taken for granted. . . . We\u0027ve done it-she thought-this much, at least, is done. It was the chance conversation of two men somewhere behind her that came beating suddenly against her closed attention. \"But laws shouldn\u0027t be passed that way, so quickly.\" \"They\u0027re not laws, they\u0027re directives.\" \"Then it\u0027s illegal.\" \"It\u0027s not illegal, because the Legislature passed a law last month giving him the power to issue directives.\" \"I don\u0027t think directives should be sprung on people that way, out of the blue, like a punch in the nose.\" \"Well, there\u0027s no time to palaver when it\u0027s a national emergency.\" \"But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s right and it doesn\u0027t jibe. How is Rearden going to do it, when it says here-\" \"Why should you worry about Rearden? He\u0027s rich enough. He can find a way to do anything.\" Then she leaped to the first newsstand in sight and seized a copy of the evening paper. It was on the front page. Wesley Mouch, Top Co-ordinator of the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, \"in a surprise move,\" said the paper, \"and in the name of the national emergency,\" had issued a set of directives, which were strung in a column down the page: The railroads of the country were ordered to reduce the maximum speed of all trains to sixty miles per hour-to reduce the maximum length of all trains to sixty cars-and to run the same number of trains in every state of a zone composed of five neighboring states, the country being divided into such zones for the purpose. The steel mills of the country were ordered to limit the maximum production of any metal alloy to an amount equal to the production of other metal alloys by other mills placed in the same classification of plant capacity-and to supply a fair share of any metal alloy to all consumers who might desire to obtain it. All the manufacturing establishments of the country, of any size and nature, were forbidden to move from their present locations, except when granted a special permission to do so by the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. To compensate the railroads of the country for the extra costs involved and \"to cushion the process of readjustment,\" a moratorium on payments of interest and principal on all railroad bonds-secured and unsecured, convertible and non-convertible-was declared for a period of five years. To provide the funds for the personnel to enforce these directives, a special tax was imposed on the state of Colorado, \"as the state best able to assist the needier states to bear the brunt of the national emergency,\" such tax to consist of five per cent of the gross sales of Colorado\u0027s industrial concerns. The cry she uttered was one she had never permitted herself before, because she made it her pride always to answer it herself-but she saw a man standing a few steps away, she did not see that he was a ragged bum, and she uttered the cry because it was the plea of reason and he was a human figure: \"What are we going to do?\" The bum grinned mirthlessly and shrugged: \"Who is John Galt?\" It was not Taggart Transcontinental that stood as the focus of terror in her mind, it was not the thought of Hank Rearden tied to a rack pulled in opposite directions-it was Ellis Wyatt. Wiping out the rest, filling her consciousness, leaving no room for words, no time for wonder, as a glaring answer to the questions she had not begun to ask, stood two pictures: Ellis Wyatt\u0027s implacable figure in front of her desk, saying, \"It is now in your power to destroy me; I may have to go; but if I go, I\u0027ll make sure that I take all the rest of you along with me\"- and the circling violence of Ellis Wyatt\u0027s body when he flung a glass to shatter against the wall. The only consciousness the pictures left her was the feeling of the approach of some unthinkable disaster, and the feeling that she had to outrun it. She had to reach Ellis Wyatt and stop him. She did not know what it was that she had to prevent. She knew only that she had to stop him. And because, were she lying crushed under the ruins of a building, were she torn by the bomb of an air raid, so long as she was still in existence she would know that action is man\u0027s foremost obligation, regardless of anything he feels-she was able to run down the platform and to see the face of the stationmaster when she found him-she was able to order: \"Hold Number 57 for me!\"-then to run to the privacy of a telephone booth in the darkness beyond the end of the platform, and to give the long-distance operator the number of Ellis Wyatt\u0027s house. She stood, propped up by the walls of the booth, her eyes closed, and listened to the dead whirl of metal which was the sound of a bell ringing somewhere. It brought no answer. The bell kept coming in sudden spasms, like a drill going through her ear, through her body. She clutched the receiver as if, unheeded, it were still a form of contact. She wished the bell were louder. She forgot that the sound she heard was not the one ringing in his house. She did not know that she was screaming, \"Ellis, don\u0027t! Don\u0027t! Don\u0027t I\"-until she heard the cold, reproving voice of the operator say, \"Your party does not answer.\" She sat at the window of a coach of Train Number 57, and listened to the clicking of the wheels on the rails of Rearden Metal, She sat, unresisting, swaying with the motion of the train. The black luster of the window hid the countryside she did not want to see. It was her second run on the John Galt Line, and she tried not to think of the first. The bondholders, she thought, the bondholders of the John Galt Line-it was to her honor that they had entrusted their money, the saving and achievement of years, it was on her ability that they had staked it, it was on her work that they had relied and on their own-and she had been made to betray them into a looters\u0027 trap: there would be no trains and no life-blood of freight, the John Galt Line had been only a drainpipe that had permitted Jim Taggart to make a deal and to drain their wealth, unearned, into his pocket, in exchange for letting others drain his railroad-the bonds of the John Galt Line, which, this morning, had been the proud guardians of their owners\u0027 security and future, had become in the space of an hour, scraps of paper that no one would buy, with no value, no future, no power, save the power to close the doors and stop the wheels of the last hope of the country-and Taggart Transcontinental was not a living plant, fed by blood it had worked to produce, but a cannibal of the moment, devouring the unborn children of greatness. The tax on Colorado, she thought, the tax collected from Ellis Wyatt to pay for the livelihood of those whose job was to tie him and make him unable to live, those who would stand on guard to see that he got no trains, no tank cars, no pipeline of Rearden Metal-Ellis Wyatt, stripped of the right of serf-defense, left without voice, without weapons, and worse: made to be the tool of his own destruction, the supporter of his own destroyers, the provider of their food and of their weapons-Ellis Wyatt being choked, with his own bright energy turned against him as the noose-Ellis Wyatt, who had wanted to tap an unlimited source of shale oil and who spoke of a Second Renaissance. . . . She sat bent over, her head on her arms, slumped at the, ledge of the window-while the great curves of the green-blue rail, the mountains, the valleys, the new towns of Colorado went by in the darkness, unseen. The sudden jolt of brakes on wheels threw her upright. It was an unscheduled stop, and the platform of the small station was crowded with people, all looking off in the same direction. The passengers around her were pressing to the windows, staring. She leaped to her feet, she ran down the aisle, down the steps, into the cold wind sweeping the platform. In the instant before she saw it and her scream cut the voices of the crowd, she knew that she had known that which she was to see. In a break between mountains, lighting the sky, throwing a glow that swayed on the roofs and walls of the station, the hill of Wyatt Oil was a solid sheet of flame. Later, when they told her that Ellis Wyatt had vanished, leaving nothing behind but a board he had nailed to a post at the foot of the hill, when she looked at his handwriting on the board, she felt as if she had almost known that these would be the words: \"I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It\u0027s yours.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1551/46031.html","bookId":1296,"book":{"id":1296,"title":"Atlas Shrugged 阿特拉斯耸耸肩","description":"简介： 作为一部乌托邦小说，《阿特拉斯耸耸肩》描绘了一个由自私而精明的商人、科学家、艺术家等社会精英组成的世外桃源，有着田园诗般的诗意和现实社会中的欲望的满足。在这里，维系着一切的不是道德而是金钱，金钱被视作为崇拜的偶像，是自由交换和公平正义的象征，每个人都...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/05/14-26-07-23-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1551","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM"}}
