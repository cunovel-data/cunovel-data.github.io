{"id":13773,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER X THE SIGN OF THE DOLLAR","content":"She sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, not moving, wishing she would never have to move again. The telegraph poles went racing past the window, but the train seemed lost in a void, between a brown stretch of prairie and a solid spread of rusty, graying clouds. The twilight was draining the sky without the wound of a sunset; it looked more like the fading of an anemic body in the process of exhausting its last drops of blood and light. The train was going west, as if it, too, were pulled to follow the sinking rays and quietly to vanish from the earth. She sat still, feeling no desire to resist it. She wished she would not hear the sound of the wheels. They knocked in an even rhythm, every fourth knock accented-and it seemed to her that through the rapid, running clatter of some futile stampede to escape, the beat of the accented knocks was like the steps of an enemy moving toward some inexorable purpose. She had never experienced it before, this sense of apprehension at the sight of a prairie, this feeling that the rail was only a fragile thread stretched across an enormous emptiness, like a worn nerve ready to break. She had never expected that she, who had felt as if she were the motive power aboard a train, would now sit wishing, like a child or a savage, that this train would move, that it would not stop, that it would get her there on time-wishing it, not like an act of will, but like a plea to a dark unknown. She thought of what a difference one month had made. She had seen it in the faces of the men at the stations. The track workers, the switchmen, the yardmen, who had always greeted her, anywhere along the line, their cheerful grins boasting that they knew who she was-had now looked at her stonily, turning away, their faces wary and closed. She had wanted to cry to them in apology, \"It\u0027s not I who\u0027ve done it to you!\"-then had remembered that she had accepted it and that they now had the right to hate her, that she was both a slave and a driver of slaves, and so was every human being in the country, and hatred was the only thing that men could now feel for one another. She had found reassurance, for two days, in the sight of the cities moving past her window-the factories, the bridges, the electric signs, the billboards pressing down upon the roofs of homes-the crowded, grimy, active, living conflux of the industrial East. But the cities had been left behind. The train was now diving into the prairies of Nebraska, the rattle of its couplers sounding as if it were shivering with cold. She saw lonely shapes that had been farmhouses in the vacant stretches that had been fields. But the great burst of energy, in the East, generations ago, had splattered bright trickles to run through the emptiness; some were gone, but some still lived. She was startled when the lights of a small town swept across her car and, vanishing, left it darker than it had been before. She would not move to turn on the light. She sat still, watching the rare towns. Whenever an electric beam went flashing briefly at her face, it was like a moment\u0027s greeting. She saw them as they went by, written on the walls of modest structures, over sooted roofs, down slender smokestacks, on the curves of tanks: Reynolds Harvesters-Macey Cement-Quinlan \u0026 Jones Pressed Alfalfa-Home of the Crawford Mattress-Benjamin Wylie Grain and Feed-words raised like flags to the empty darkness of the sky, the motionless forms of movement, of effort, of courage, of hope, the monuments to how much had been achieved on the edge of nature\u0027s void by men who had once been free to achieve-she saw the homes built in scattered privacy, the small shops, the wide streets with electric lighting, like a few luminous strokes criss-crossed on the black sheet of the wastelands-she saw the ghosts between, the remnants of towns, the skeletons of factories with crumbling smokestacks, the corpses of shops with broken panes, the slanting poles with shreds of wire-she saw a sudden blaze, the rare sight of a gas station, a glittering white island of glass and metal under the huge black weight of space and sky -she saw an ice-cream cone made of radiant tubing, hanging above the corner of a street, and a battered car being parked below, with a young boy at the wheel and a girl stepping out, her white dress blowing in the summer wind-she shuddered for the two of them, thinking: I can\u0027t look at you, I who know what it has taken to give you your youth, to give you this evening, this car and the ice-cream cone you\u0027re going to buy for a quarter-she saw, on the edge beyond a town, a building glowing with tiers of pale blue light, the industrial light she loved, with the silhouettes of machines in its windows and a billboard in the darkness above its roof-and suddenly her head fell on her arm, and she sat shaking, crying soundlessly to the night, to herself, to whatever was human in any living being: Don\u0027t let it go! . . . Don\u0027t let it go! . . . She jumped to her feet and snapped on the light. She stood still, fighting to regain control, knowing that such moments were her greatest danger. The lights of the town were past, her window was now an empty rectangle, and she heard, in the silence, the progression of the fourth knocks, the steps of the enemy moving on, not to be hastened or stopped. In desperate need of the sight of some living activity, she decided she would not order dinner in her car, but would go to the diner. As if stressing and mocking her loneliness, a voice came back to her mind: \"But you would not run trains if they were empty.\" Forget it!-she told herself angrily, walking hastily to the door of her car. She was astonished, approaching her vestibule, to hear the sound of voices close by. As she pulled the door open, she heard a shout: \"Get off, God damn you!\" An aging tramp had taken refuge in the corner of her vestibule. He sat on the floor, his posture suggesting that he had no strength left to stand up or to care about being caught. He was looking at the conductor, his eyes observant, fully conscious, but devoid of any reaction. The train was slowing down for a bad stretch of track, the conductor had opened the door to a cold gust of wind, and was waving at the speeding black void, ordering, \"Get going! Get off as you got on or I\u0027ll kick you off head first!\" There was no astonishment in the tramp\u0027s face, no protest, no anger, no hope; he looked as if he had long since abandoned any judgment of any human action. He moved obediently to rise, his hand groping upward along the rivets of the car\u0027s wall. She saw him glance at her and glance away, as if she were merely another inanimate fixture of the train. He did not seem to be aware of her person, any more than of his own, he was indifferently ready to comply with an order which, in his condition, meant certain death. She glanced at the conductor. She saw nothing in his face except the blind malevolence of pain, of some long-repressed anger that broke out upon the first object available, almost without consciousness of the object\u0027s identity. The two men were not human beings to each other any longer. The tramp\u0027s suit was a mass of careful patches on a cloth so stiff and shiny with wear that one expected it to crack like glass if bent; but she noticed the collar of his shirt: it was bone-white from repeated laundering and it still preserved a semblance of shape. He had pulled himself up to his feet, he was looking indifferently at the black hole open upon miles of uninhabited wilderness where no one would see the body or hear the voice of a mangled man, but the only gesture of concern he made was to tighten his grip on a small, dirty bundle, as if to make sure he would not lose it in leaping off the train. It was the laundered collar and this gesture for the last of his possessions-the gesture of a sense of property-that made her feel an emotion like a sudden, burning twist within her. \"Wait,\" she said. The two men turned to her. \"Let him be my guest,\" she said to the conductor, and held her door open for the tramp, ordering, \"Come in.\" The tramp followed her, obeying as blankly as he had been about to obey the conductor. He stood in the middle of her car, holding his bundle, looking around him with the same observant, unreacting glance. \"Sit down,\" she said. He obeyed-and looked at her, as if waiting for further orders. There was a kind of dignity in his manner, the honesty of the open admission that he had no claim to make, no plea to offer, no questions to ask, that he now had to accept whatever was done to him and was ready to accept it. He seemed to be in his early fifties; the structure of his bones and the looseness of his suit suggested that he had once been muscular. The lifeless indifference of his eyes did not fully hide that they had been intelligent; the wrinkles cutting his face with the record of some incredible bitterness, had not fully erased the fact that the face had once possessed the kindliness peculiar to honesty. \"When did you eat last?\" she asked. \"Yesterday,\" he said, and added, \"I think.\" She rang for the porter and ordered dinner for two, to be brought to her car from the diner. The tramp had watched her silently, but when the porter departed, he offered the only payment it was in his power to offer: \"I don\u0027t want to get you in trouble, ma\u0027am,\" he said. She smiled. \"What trouble?\" \"You\u0027re traveling with one of those railroad tycoons, aren\u0027t you?\" \"No, alone.\" \"Then you\u0027re the wife of one of them?\" \"No.\" \"Oh.\" She saw his effort at a look of something like respect, as if to make up for having forced an improper confession, and she laughed. \"No, not that, either. I guess I\u0027m one of the tycoons myself. My name is Dagny Taggart and I work for this railroad.\" \"Oh . . . I think I\u0027ve heard of you, ma\u0027am-in the old days.\" It was hard to tell what \"the old days\" meant to him, whether it was a month or a year or whatever period of time had passed since he had given up. He was looking at her with a sort of interest in the past tense, as if he were thinking that there had been a time when he would have considered her a personage worth seeing. \"You were the lady who ran a railroad,\" he said. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I was.\" He showed no sign of astonishment at the fact that she had chosen to help him. He looked as if so much brutality had confronted him that he had given up the attempt to understand, to trust or to expect anything. \"When did you get aboard the train?\" she asked. \"Back at the division point, ma\u0027am. Your door wasn\u0027t locked.\" He added, \"I figured maybe nobody would notice me till morning on account of it being a private car.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" Then, almost as if he sensed that this could sound too much like an appeal for pity, he added, \"I guess I just wanted to keep moving till I saw some place that looked like there might be a chance to find work there.\" This was his attempt to assume the responsibility of a purpose, rather than to throw the burden of his aimlessness upon her mercy-an attempt of the same order as his shirt collar. \"What kind of work are you looking for?\" \"People don\u0027t look for kinds of work any more, ma\u0027am,\" he answered impassively. \"They just look for work.\" \"What sort of place did you hope to find?\" \"Oh . . . well . . . where there\u0027s factories, I guess.\" \"Aren\u0027t you going in the wrong direction for that? The factories are in the East.\" \"No.\" He said it with the firmness of knowledge. \"There are too many people in the East. The factories are too well watched. I figured there might be a better chance some place where there\u0027s fewer people and less law.\" \"Oh, running away? A fugitive from the law, are you?\" \"Not as you\u0027d mean it in the old days, ma\u0027am. But as things are now, I guess I am. I want to work.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"There aren\u0027t any jobs back East. And a man couldn\u0027t give you a job, if he had one to give-he\u0027d go to jail for it. He\u0027s watched. You can\u0027t get work except through the Unification Board. The Unification Board has a gang of its own friends waiting in line for the jobs, more friends than a millionaire\u0027s got relatives. Well, me-I haven\u0027t got either.\" \"Where did you work last?\" \"I\u0027ve been bumming around the country for six months-no, longer, I guess-I guess it\u0027s closer to about a year-I can\u0027t tell any more-mostly day work it was. Mostly on farms. But it\u0027s getting to be no use now. I know how the farmers look at you-they don\u0027t like to see a man starving, but they\u0027re only one jump ahead of starvation themselves, they haven\u0027t any work to give you, they haven\u0027t any food, and whatever they save, if the tax collectors don\u0027t get it, then the raiders do-you know, the gangs that rove all through the country-deserters, they call them.\" \"Do you think that it\u0027s any better in the West?\" \"No. I don\u0027t.\" \"Then why are you going there?\" \"Because I haven\u0027t tried it before. That\u0027s all there is left to try. It\u0027s somewhere to go. Just to keep moving . . . You know,\" he added suddenly, \"I don\u0027t think it will be any use. But there\u0027s nothing to do in the East except sit under some hedge and wait to die. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d mind it much now, the dying. I know it would be a lot easier. Only I think that it\u0027s a sin to sit down and let your life go, without making a try for it.\" She thought suddenly of those modern college-infected parasites who assumed a sickening air of moral self-righteousness whenever they uttered the standard bromides about their concern for the welfare of others. The tramp\u0027s last sentence was one of the most profoundly moral statements she had ever heard; but the man did not know it; he had said it in his impassive, extinguished voice, simply, dryly, as a matter of fact. \"What part of the country do you come from?\" she asked. \"Wisconsin,\" he answered. The waiter came in, bringing their dinner. He set a table and courteously moved two chairs, showing no astonishment at the nature of the occasion. She looked at the table; she thought that the magnificence of a world where men could afford the time and the effortless concern for such things as starched napkins and tinkling ice cubes, offered to travelers along with their meals for the price of a few dollars, was a remnant of the age when the sustenance of one\u0027s life had not been made a crime and a meal had not been a matter of running a race with death-a remnant which was soon to vanish, like the white filling station on the edge of the weeds of the jungle. She noticed that the tramp, who had lost the strength to stand up, had not lost the respect for the meaning of the things spread before him. He did not pounce upon the food; he fought to keep his movements slow, to unfold his napkin, to pick up his fork in tempo with hers, his hand shaking-as if he still knew that this, no matter what indignity was ever forced upon them, was the manner proper to men. \"What was your line of work-in the old days?\" she asked, when the waiter left. \"Factories, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"What trade?\" \"Skilled lathe-operator.\" \"Where did you work at it last?\" \"In Colorado, ma\u0027am. For the Hammond Car Company.\" \"Oh . . . !\" \"Ma\u0027am?\" \"No, nothing. Worked there long?\" \"No, ma\u0027am. Just two weeks.\" \"How come?\" \"Well, I\u0027d waited a year for it, hanging around Colorado just to get that job. They had a waiting list too, the Hammond Car Company, only they didn\u0027t go by friendships and they didn\u0027t go by seniority, they went by a man\u0027s record. I had a good record. But it was just two weeks after I got the job that Lawrence Hammond quit. He quit and disappeared. They closed the plant. Afterwards, there was a citizens\u0027 committee that reopened it. I got called back. But five days was all it lasted. They started layoffs just about at once. By seniority. So I had to go. I heard they lasted for about three months, the citizens\u0027 committee. Then they had to close the plant for good.\" \"Where did you work before that?\" \"Just about in every Eastern state, ma\u0027am. But it was never more than a month or two. The plants kept closing.\" \"Did that happen on every job you\u0027ve held?\" He glanced at her, as if he understood her question. \"No, ma\u0027am,\" he answered and, for the first time, she caught a faint echo of pride in his voice. \"The first job I had, I held it for twenty years. Not the same job, but the same place, I mean-I got to be shop foreman. That was twelve years ago. Then the owner of the plant died, and the heirs who took it over, ran it into the ground. Times were bad then, but it was since then that things started going to pieces everywhere faster and faster. Since then, it seems like anywhere I turned-the place cracked and went. At first, we thought it was only one state or another. A lot of us thought that Colorado would last. But it went, too. Anything you tried, anything you touched-it fell. Anywhere you looked, work was stopping-the factories were stopping-the machines were stopping-\" he added slowly, in a whisper, as if seeing some secret terror of his own, \"the motors . . . were . . . stopping.\" His voice rose: \"Oh God, who is-\" and broke off. \"-John Galt?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" he said, and shook his head as if to dispel some vision, \"only I don\u0027t like to say that.\" \"I don\u0027t, either. I wish I knew why people are saying it and who started it.\" \"That\u0027s it, ma\u0027am. That\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of. It might have been me who started it.\" \"What?\" \"Me or about six thousand others. We might have. I think we did. I hope we\u0027re wrong.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well, there was something that happened at that plant where I worked for twenty years. It was when the old man died and his heirs took over. There were three of them, two sons and a daughter, and they brought a new plan to run the factory. They let us vote on it, too, and everybody-almost everybody-voted for it. We didn\u0027t know. We thought it was good. No, that\u0027s not true, either. We thought that we were supposed to think it was good. The plan was that everybody in the factory would work according to his ability, but would be paid according to his need. We-what\u0027s the matter, ma\u0027am? Why do you look like that?\" \"What was the name of the factory?\" she asked, her voice barely audible. \"The Twentieth Century Motor Company, ma\u0027am, of Starnesville, Wisconsin.\" \"Go on.\" \"We voted for that plan at a big meeting, with all of us present, six thousand of us, everybody that worked in the factory. The Starnes heirs made long speeches about it, and it wasn\u0027t too clear, but nobody asked any questions. None of us knew just how the plan would work, but every one of us thought that the next fellow knew it. And if anybody had doubts, he felt guilty and kept his mouth shut-because they made it sound like anyone who\u0027d oppose the plan was a child killer at heart and less than a human being. They told us that this plan would achieve a noble ideal. Well, how were we to know otherwise? Hadn\u0027t we heard it all our lives-from our parents and our schoolteachers and our ministers, and in every newspaper we ever read and every movie and every public speech? Hadn\u0027t we always been told that this was righteous and just? Well, maybe there\u0027s some excuse for what we did at that meeting. Still, we voted for the plan-and what we got, we had it coming to us. You know, ma\u0027am, we are marked men, in a way, those of us who lived through the four years of that plan in the Twentieth Century factory. What is it that hell is supposed to be? Evil-plain, naked, smirking evil, isn\u0027t it? Well, that\u0027s what we saw and helped to make-and I think we\u0027re damned, every one of us, and maybe we\u0027ll never be forgiven. . . . \"Do you know how it worked, that plan, and what it did to people? Try pouring water into a tank where there\u0027s a pipe at the bottom draining it out faster than you pour it, and each bucket you bring breaks that pipe an inch wider, and the harder you work the more is demanded of you, and you stand slinging buckets forty hours a week, then forty-eight, then fifty-six-for your neighbor\u0027s supper-for his wife\u0027s operation-for his child\u0027s measles-for his mother\u0027s wheel chair -for his uncle\u0027s shirt-for his nephew\u0027s schooling-for the baby next door-for the baby to be born-for anyone anywhere around you-it\u0027s theirs to receive, from diapers to dentures-and yours to work, from sunup to sundown, month after month, year after year, with nothing to show for it but your sweat, with nothing in sight for you but their pleasure, for the whole of your life, without rest, without hope, without end. . . . From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. . . . \"We\u0027re all one big family, they told us, we\u0027re all in this together. But you don\u0027t all stand working an acetylene torch ten hours a day-together, and you don\u0027t all get a bellyache-together. What\u0027s whose ability and which of whose needs comes first? When it\u0027s all one pot, you can\u0027t let any man decide what his own needs are, can you? If you did, he might claim that he needs a yacht-and if his feelings is all you have to go by, he might prove it, too. Why not? If it\u0027s not right for me to own a car until I\u0027ve worked myself into a hospital ward, earning a car for every loafer and every naked savage on earth-why can\u0027t he demand a yacht from me, too, if I still have the ability not to have collapsed? No? He can\u0027t? Then why can he demand that I go without cream for my coffee until he\u0027s replastered his living room? . . . Oh well . . . Well, anyway, it was decided that nobody had the right to judge his own need or ability. We voted on it. Yes, ma\u0027am, we voted on it in a public meeting twice a year. How else could it be done? Do you care to think what would happen at such a meeting? It took us just one meeting to discover that we had become beggars-rotten, whining, sniveling beggars, all of us, because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning, he had no rights and no earnings, his work didn\u0027t belong to him, it belonged to \u0027the family,\u0027 and they owed him nothing in return, and the only claim he had on them was his \u0027need\u0027-so he had to beg in public for relief from his needs, like any lousy moocher, listing all his troubles and miseries, down to his patched drawers and his wife\u0027s head colds, hoping that \u0027the family\u0027 would throw him the alms. He had to claim miseries, because it\u0027s miseries, not work, that had become the coin of the realm-so it turned into a contest among six thousand panhandlers, each claiming that his need was worse than his brother\u0027s. How else could it be done? Do you care to guess what happened, what sort of men kept quiet, feeling shame, and what sort got away with the jackpot? \"But that wasn\u0027t all. There was something else that we discovered at the same meeting. The factory\u0027s production had fallen by forty per cent, in that first half-year, so it was decided that somebody hadn\u0027t delivered \u0027according to his ability\u0027 Who? How would you tell it? \u0027The family\u0027 voted on that, too. They voted which men were the best, and these men were sentenced to work overtime each night for the next six months. Overtime without pay-because you weren\u0027t paid by time and you weren\u0027t paid by work, only by need. \"Do I have to tell you what happened after that-and into what sort of creatures we all started turning, we who had once been human? We began to hide whatever ability we had, to slow down and watch like hawks that we never worked any faster or better than the next fellow. What else could we do, when we knew that if we did our best for \u0027the family,\u0027 it\u0027s not thanks or rewards that we\u0027d get, but punishment? We knew that for every stinker who\u0027d ruin a batch of motors and cost the company money-either through his sloppiness, because he didn\u0027t have to care, or through plain incompetence-it\u0027s we who\u0027d have to pay with our nights and our Sundays. So we did our best to be no good. \"There was one young boy who started out, full of fire for the noble ideal, a bright kid without any schooling, but with a wonderful head on his shoulders. The first year, he figured out a work process that saved us thousands of man-hours. He gave it to \u0027the family,\u0027 didn\u0027t ask anything for it, either, couldn\u0027t ask, but that was all right with him. It was for the ideal, he said. But when he found himself voted as one of our ablest and sentenced to night work, because we hadn\u0027t gotten enough from him, he shut his mouth and his brain. You can bet he didn\u0027t come up with any ideas, the second year. \"What was it they\u0027d always told us about the vicious competition of the profit system, where men had to compete for who\u0027d do a better job than his fellows? Vicious, wasn\u0027t it? Well, they should have seen what it was like when we all had to compete with one another for who\u0027d do the worst job possible. There\u0027s no surer way to destroy a man than to force him into a spot where he has to aim at not doing his best, where he has to struggle to do a bad job, day after day. That will finish him quicker than drink or idleness or pulling stick-ups for a living. But there was nothing else for us to do except to fake unfitness. The one accusation we feared was to be suspected of ability. Ability was like a mortgage on you that you could never pay off. And what was there to work for? You knew that your basic pittance would be given to you anyway, whether you worked or not-your \u0027housing and feeding allowance,\u0027 it was called-and above that pittance, you had no chance to get anything, no matter how hard you tried. You couldn\u0027t count on buying a new suit of clothes next year-they might give you a \u0027clothing allowance\u0027 or they might not, according to whether nobody broke a leg, needed an operation or gave birth to more babies. And if there wasn\u0027t enough money for new suits for everybody, then you couldn\u0027t get yours, either. \"There was one man who\u0027d worked hard all his life, because he\u0027d always wanted to send his son through college. Well, the boy graduated from high school in the second year of the plan-but \u0027the family\u0027 wouldn\u0027t give the father any \u0027allowance\u0027 for the college. They said his son couldn\u0027t go to college, until we had enough to send everybody\u0027s sons to college-and that we first had to send everybody\u0027s children through high school, and we didn\u0027t even have enough for that. The father died the following year, in a knife fight with somebody in a saloon, a fight over nothing in particular-such fights were beginning to happen among us all the time. \"Then there was an old guy, a widower with no family, who had one hobby: phonograph records. I guess that was all he ever got out of life. In the old days, he used to skip meals just to buy himself some new recording of classical music. Well, they didn\u0027t give him any \u0027allowance\u0027 for records-\u0027personal luxury,\u0027 they called it. But at that same meeting, Millie Bush, somebody\u0027s daughter, a mean, ugly little eight-year-old, was voted a pair of gold braces for her buck teeth-this was \u0027medical need,\u0027 because the staff psychologist had said that the poor girl would get an inferiority complex if her teeth weren\u0027t straightened out. The old guy\u0027 who loved music, turned to drink, instead. He got so you never saw him fully conscious any more. But it seems like there was one tiling he couldn\u0027t forget. One night, he came staggering down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung his fist and knocked all her teeth out. Every one of them. \"Drink, of course, was what we all turned to, some more, some less. Don\u0027t ask how we got the money for it. When all the decent pleasures are forbidden, there\u0027s always ways to get the rotten ones. You don\u0027t break into grocery stores after dark and you don\u0027t pick your fellow\u0027s pockets to buy classical symphonies or fishing tackle, but if it\u0027s to get stinking drunk and forget-you do. Fishing tackle? Hunting guns? Snapshot cameras? Hobbies? There wasn\u0027t any \u0027amusement allowance\u0027 for anybody. \u0027Amusement\u0027 was the first thing they dropped. Aren\u0027t you always supposed to be ashamed to object when anybody asks you to give up anything, if it\u0027s something that gave you pleasure? Even our \u0027tobacco allowance\u0027 was cut to where we got two packs of cigarettes a month-and this, they told us, was because the money had to go into the babies\u0027 milk fund. Babies was the only item of production that didn\u0027t fall, but rose and kept on rising-because people had nothing else to do, I guess, and because they didn\u0027t have to care, the baby wasn\u0027t their burden, it was \u0027the family\u0027s.\u0027 In fact, the best chance you had of getting a raise and breathing easier for a while was a \u0027baby allowance.\u0027 Either that, or a major disease. \"It didn\u0027t take us long to see how it all worked out. Any man who tried to play straight, had to refuse himself everything. He lost his taste for any pleasure, he hated to smoke a nickel\u0027s worth of tobacco or chew a stick of gum, worrying whether somebody had more need for that nickel. He felt ashamed of every mouthful of food he swallowed, wondering whose weary nights of overtime had paid for it, knowing that his food was not his by right, miserably wishing to be cheated rather than to cheat, to be a sucker, but not a blood-sucker. He wouldn\u0027t marry, he wouldn\u0027t help his folks back home, he wouldn\u0027t put an extra burden on \u0027the family.\u0027 Besides, if he still had some sort of sense of responsibility, he couldn\u0027t marry or bring children into the world, when he could plan nothing, promise nothing, count on nothing. But the shiftless and the irresponsible had a field day of it. They bred babies, they got girls into trouble, they dragged in every worthless relative they had from all over the country, every unmarried pregnant sister, for an extra \u0027disability allowance,\u0027 they got more sicknesses than any doctor could disprove, they ruined their clothing, their furniture, their homes-what the hell, \u0027the family\u0027 was paying for it! They found more ways of getting in \u0027need\u0027 than the rest of us could ever imagine -they developed a special skill for it, which was the only ability they showed. \"God help us, ma\u0027am! Do you see what we saw? We saw that we\u0027d been given a law to live by, a moral law, they called it, which punished those who observed it-for observing it. The more you tried to live up to it, the more you suffered; the more you cheated it, the bigger reward you got. Your honesty was like a tool left at the mercy of the next man\u0027s dishonesty. The honest ones paid, the dishonest collected.The honest lost, the dishonest won. How long could men stay good under this sort of a law of goodness? We were a pretty decent bunch of fellows when we started. There weren\u0027t many chiselers among us. We knew our jobs and we were proud of it and we worked for the best factory in the country, where old man Starnes hired nothing but the pick of the country\u0027s labor. Within one year under the new plan, there wasn\u0027t an honest man left among us. That was the evil, the sort of hell-horror evil that preachers used to scare you with, but you never thought to see alive. Not that the plan encouraged a few bastards, but that it turned decent people into bastards, and there was nothing else that it could do-and it was called a moral ideal! \"What was it we were supposed to want to work for? For the love of our brothers? What brothers? For the bums, the loafers, the moochers we saw all around us? And whether they were cheating or plain incompetent, whether they were unwilling or unable-what difference did that make to us? If we were tied for life to the level of their unfitness, faked or real, how long could we care to go on? We had no way of knowing their ability, we had no way of controlling their needs-all we knew was that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in some sort of place that was half-hospital, half-stockyards-a place geared to nothing but disability, disaster, disease-beasts put there for the relief of whatever whoever chose to say was whichever\u0027s need. \"Love of our brothers? That\u0027s when we learned to hate our brothers for the first time in our lives. We began to hate them for every meal they swallowed, for every small pleasure they enjoyed, for one man\u0027s new shirt, for another\u0027s wife\u0027s hat, for an outing with their family, for a paint job on their house-it was taken from us, it was paid for by our privations, our denials, our hunger. We began to spy on one another, each hoping to catch the others lying about their needs, so as to cut their \u0027allowance\u0027 at the next meeting. We began to have stool pigeons who informed on people, who reported that somebody had bootlegged a turkey to his family on some Sunday-which he\u0027d paid for by gambling, most likely. We began to meddle into one another\u0027s lives. We provoked family quarrels, to get somebody\u0027s relatives thrown out. Any time we saw a man starting to go steady with a girl, we made life miserable for him. We broke up many engagements. We didn\u0027t want anyone to marry, we didn\u0027t want any more dependents to feed. \"In the old days, we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby, we used to chip in and help him out with the hospital bills, if he happened to be hard-pressed for the moment. Now, if a baby was born, we didn\u0027t speak to the parents for weeks. Babies, to us, had become what locusts were to farmers. In the old days, we used to help a man if he had a bad illness in the family. Now-well, I\u0027ll tell you about just one case. It was the mother of a man who had been with us for fifteen years. She was a kindly old lady, cheerful and wise, she knew us all by our first names and we all liked her-we used to like her. One day, she slipped on the cellar stairs and fell and broke her hip. We knew what that meant at her age. The staff doctor said that she\u0027d have to be sent to a hospital in town, for expensive treatments that would take a long time. The old lady died the night before she was to leave for town. They never established the cause of death. No, I don\u0027t know whether she was murdered. Nobody said that. Nobody would talk about it at all. All I know is that I-and that\u0027s what I can\u0027t forget!-I, too, had caught myself wishing that she would die. This-may God forgive us!-was the brotherhood, the security, the abundance that the plan was supposed to achieve for us! \"Was there any reason why this sort of horror would ever be preached by anybody? Was there anybody who got any profit from it? There was. The Starnes heirs. I hope you\u0027re not going to remind me that they\u0027d sacrificed a fortune and turned the factory over to us as a gift. We were fooled by that one, too. Yes, they gave up the factory. But profit, ma\u0027am, depends on what it is you\u0027re after. And what the Starnes heirs were after, no money on earth could buy. Money is too clean and innocent for that. \"Eric Starnes, the youngest-he was a jellyfish that didn\u0027t have the guts to be after anything in particular. He got himself voted as Director of our Public Relations Department, which didn\u0027t do anything, except that he had a staff for the not doing of anything, so he didn\u0027t have to bother sticking around the office. The pay he got-well, I shouldn\u0027t call it \u0027pay,\u0027 none of us was \u0027paid\u0027-the alms voted to him was fairly modest, about ten times what I got, but that wasn\u0027t riches. Eric didn\u0027t care for money-he wouldn\u0027t have known what to do with it. He spent his time hanging around among us, showing how chummy he was and democratic. He wanted to be loved, it seems. The way he went about it was to keep reminding us that he had given us the factory. We couldn\u0027t stand him. \"Gerald Starnes was our Director of Production. We never learned just what the size of his rake-off-his alms-had been. It would have taken a staff of accountants to figure that out, and a staff of engineers to trace the way it was piped, directly or indirectly, into his office. None of it was supposed to be for him-it was all for company expenses. Gerald had three cars, four secretaries, five telephones, and he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no tax-paying tycoon in the country could have afforded. He spent more money in one year than his father had earned in profits in the last two years of his life. We saw a hundred-pound stack-a hundred pounds, we weighed them-of magazines in Gerald\u0027s office, full of stories about our factory and our noble plan, with big pictures of Gerald Starnes, calling him a great social crusader. Gerald liked to come into the shops at night, dressed in his formal clothes, flashing diamond cuff links the size of a nickel and shaking cigar ashes all over. Any cheap show-off who\u0027s got nothing to parade but his cash, is bad enough-except that he makes no bones about the cash being his, and you\u0027re free to gape at him or not, as you wish, and mostly you don\u0027t. But when a bastard like Gerald Starnes puts on an act and keeps spouting that he doesn\u0027t care for material wealth, that he\u0027s only serving \u0027the family,\u0027 that all the lushness is not for himself, but for our sake and for the common good, because it\u0027s necessary to keep up the prestige of the company and of the noble plan in the eyes of the public-then that\u0027s when you learn to hate the creature as you\u0027ve never hated anything human. \"But his sister Ivy was worse. She really did not care for material wealth. The alms she got was no bigger than ours, and she went about in scuffed, flat-heeled shoes and shirtwaists-just to show how selfless she was. She was our Director of Distribution. She was the lady in charge of our needs. She was the one who held us by the throat. Of course, distribution was supposed to be decided by voting-by the voice of the people. But when the people are six thousand howling voices, trying to decide without yardstick, rhyme or reason, when there are no rules to the game and each can demand anything, but has a right to nothing, when everybody holds power over everybody\u0027s life except his own-then it turns out, as it did, that the voice of the people is Ivy Starnes. By the end of the second year, we dropped the pretense of the \u0027family meetings\u0027-in the name of \u0027production efficiency and time economy,\u0027 one meeting used to take ten days-and all the petitions of need were simply sent to Miss Starnes\u0027 office. No, not sent. They had to be recited to her in person by every petitioner. Then she made up a distribution list, which she read to us for our vote of approval at a meeting that lasted three-quarters of an hour. We voted approval. There was a ten-minute period on the agenda for discussion and objections. We made no objections. We knew better by that time. Nobody can divide a factory\u0027s income among thousands of people, without some sort of a gauge to measure people\u0027s value. Her gauge was bootlicking. Selfless? In her father\u0027s time, all of his money wouldn\u0027t have given him a chance to speak to his lousiest wiper and get away with it, as she spoke to our best skilled workers and their wives. She had pale eyes that looked fishy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure evil, you should have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some man who\u0027d talked back to her once and who\u0027d just heard his name on the list of those getting nothing above basic pittance. And when you saw it, you saw the real motive of any person who\u0027s ever preached the slogan: \u0027From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\u0027 \"This was the whole secret of it. At first, I kept wondering how it could be possible that the educated, the cultured, the famous men of the world could make a mistake of this size and preach, as righteousness, this sort of abomination-when five minutes of thought should have told them what would happen if somebody tried to practice what they preached. Now I know that they didn\u0027t do it by any kind of mistake. Mistakes of this size are never made innocently. If men fall for some vicious piece of insanity, when they have no way to make it work and no possible reason to explain their choice-it\u0027s because they have a reason that they do not wish to tell. And we weren\u0027t so innocent either, when we voted for that plan at the first meeting. We didn\u0027t do it just because we believed that the drippy old guff they spewed was good. We had another reason, but the guff helped us to hide it from our neighbors and from ourselves. The guff gave us a chance to pass off as virtue something that we\u0027d be ashamed to admit otherwise. There wasn\u0027t a man voting for it who didn\u0027t think that under a setup of this kind he\u0027d muscle in on the profits of the men abler than himself. There wasn\u0027t a man rich and smart enough but that he didn\u0027t think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this plan would give him a share of his better\u0027s wealth and brain. But while he was thinking that he\u0027d get unearned benefits from the men above, he forgot about the men below who\u0027d get unearned benefits, too. He forgot about all his inferiors who\u0027d rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain his superiors. The worker who liked the idea that his need entitled him to a limousine like his boss\u0027s, forgot that every bum and beggar on earth would come howling that their need entitled them to an icebox like his own. That was our real motive when we voted-that was the truth of it-but we didn\u0027t like to think it, so the less we liked it, the louder we yelled about our love for the common good. \"Well, we got what we asked for. By the time we saw what it was that we\u0027d asked for, it was too late. We were trapped, with no place to go. The best men among us left the factory in the first week of the plan. We lost our best engineers, superintendents, foremen and highest skilled workers. A man of self-respect doesn\u0027t turn into a milch cow for anybody. Some able fellows tried to stick it out, but they couldn\u0027t take it for long. We kept losing our men, they kept escaping from the factory like from a pesthole-till we had nothing left except the men of need, but none of the men of ability. \"And the few of us who were still any good, but stayed on, were only those who had been there too long. In the old days, nobody ever quit the Twentieth Century-and, somehow, we couldn\u0027t make ourselves believe that it was gone. After a while, we couldn\u0027t quit, because no other employer would have us-for which I can\u0027t blame him. Nobody would deal with us in any way, no respectable person or firm. All the small shops, where we traded, started moving out of Starnesville fast-till we had nothing left but saloons, gambling joints and crooks who sold us trash at gouging prices. The alms we got kept falling, but the cost of our living went up. The list of the factory\u0027s needy kept stretching, but the list of its customers shrank. There was less and less income to divide among more and more people. In the old days, it used to be said that the Twentieth Century Motor trademark was as good as the karat mark on gold. I don\u0027t know what it was that the Starnes heirs thought, if they thought at all, but I suppose that like all social planners and like savages, they thought that this trademark was a magic stamp which did the trick by some sort of voodoo power and that it would keep them rich, as it had kept their father. Well, when our customers began to see that we never delivered an order on time and never put out a motor that didn\u0027t have something wrong with it-the magic stamp began to work the other way around: people wouldn\u0027t take a motor as a gift, if it was marked Twentieth Century, And it came to where our only customers were men who never paid and never meant to pay their bills. But Gerald Starnes, doped by his own publicity, got huffy and went around, with an air of moral superiority, demanding that businessmen place orders with us, not because our motors were good, but because we needed the orders so badly. \"By that time, a village half-wit could see what generations of professors had pretended not to notice. What good would our need do to a power plant when its generators stopped because of our defective engines? What good would it do to a man caught on an operating table when the electric light went out? What good would it do to the passengers of a plane when its motor failed in mid-air? And if they bought our product, not because of its merit, but because of our need, would that be the good, the right, the moral thing to do for the owner of that power plant, the surgeon in that hospital, the maker of that plane? \"Yet this was the moral law that the professors and leaders and thinkers had wanted to establish all over the earth. If this is what it did in a single small town where we all knew one another, do you care to think what it would do on a world scale? Do you care to imagine what it would be like, if you had to live and to work, when you\u0027re tied to all the disasters and all the malingering of the globe? To work -and whenever any men failed anywhere, it\u0027s you who would have to make up for it. To work-with no chance to rise, with your meals and your clothes and your home and your pleasure depending on any swindle, any famine, any pestilence anywhere on earth. To work-with no chance for an extra ration, till the Cambodians have been fed and the Patagonians have been sent through college. To work-on a blank check held by every creature born, by men whom you\u0027ll never see, whose needs you\u0027ll never know, whose ability or laziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right to question -just to work and work and work-and leave it up to the Ivys and the Geralds of the world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort, the dreams and the days of your life. And this is the moral law to accept? This-a moral ideal? \"Well, we tried it-and we learned. Our agony took four years, from our first meeting to our last, and it ended the only way it could end: in bankruptcy. At our last meeting, Ivy Starnes was the one who tried to brazen it out. She made a short, nasty, snippy little speech in which she said that the plan had failed because the rest of the country had not accepted it, that a single community could not succeed in the midst of a selfish, greedy world-and that the plan was a noble ideal, but human nature was not good enough for it. A young boy-the one who had been punished for giving us a useful idea in our first year-got up, as we all sat silent, and walked straight to Ivy Starnes on the platform. He said nothing. He spat in her face. That was the end of the noble plan and of the Twentieth Century.\" The man had spoken as if the burden of his years of silence had slipped suddenly out of his grasp. She knew that this was his tribute to her: he had shown no reaction to her kindness, he had seemed numbed to human value or human hope, but something within him had been reached and his response was this confession, this long, desperate cry of rebellion against injustice, held back for years, but breaking out in recognition of the first person he had met in whose hearing an appeal for justice would not be hopeless. It was as if the life he had been about to renounce were given back to him by the two essentials he needed: by his food and by the presence of a rational being. \"But what about John Galt?\" she asked. \"Oh . . .\" he said, remembering. \"Oh, yes . . .\" \"You were going to tell me why people started asking that question.\" \"Yes . . .\" He was looking off, as if at some sight which he had studied for years, but which remained unchanged and unsolved; his face had an odd, questioning look of terror. \"You were going to tell me who was the John Galt they mean-if there ever was such a person.\" \"I hope there wasn\u0027t, ma\u0027am. I mean, I hope that it\u0027s just a coincidence, just a sentence that hasn\u0027t any meaning.\" \"You had something in mind. What?\" \"It was . . . it was something that happened at that first meeting at the Twentieth Century factory. Maybe that was the start of it, maybe not. I don\u0027t know . . . The meeting was held on a spring night, twelve years ago. The six thousand of us were crowded on bleachers built way up to the rafters of the plant\u0027s largest hangar. We had just voted for the new plan and we were in an edgy sort of mood, making too much noise, cheering the people\u0027s victory, threatening some kind of unknown enemies and spoiling for a fight, like bullies with an uneasy conscience. There were white arclights beating down on us and we felt kind of touchy and raw, and we were an ugly, dangerous mob in that moment. Gerald Starnes, who was chairman, kept hammering his gavel for order, and we quieted down some, but not much, and you could see the whole place moving restlessly from side to side, like water in a pan that\u0027s being rocked. \u0027This is a crucial moment in the history of mankind!\u0027 Gerald Starnes yelled through the noise. \u0027Remember that none of us may now leave this place, for each of us belongs to all the others by the moral law which we all accept!\u0027 ‘I don\u0027t,’ said one man and stood up. He was one of the young engineers. Nobody knew much about him. He\u0027d always kept mostly by himself. When he stood up, we suddenly turned dead-still. It was the way he held his head. He was tall and slim-and I remember thinking that any two of us could have broken his neck without trouble-but what we all felt was fear. He stood like a man who knew that he was right. \u0027I will put an end to this, once and for all,\u0027 he said. His voice was clear and without any feeling. That was all he said and started to walk out. He walked down the length of the place, in the white light, not hurrying and not noticing any of us. Nobody moved to stop him. Gerald Starnes cried suddenly after him, \u0027How?\u0027 He turned and answered, \u0027I will stop the motor of the world.’ Then he walked out. We never saw him again. We never heard what became of him. But years later, when we saw the lights going out, one after another, in the great factories that had stood solid like mountains for generations, when we saw the gates closing and the conveyor belts turning still, when we saw the roads growing empty and the stream of cars draining off, when it began to look as if some silent power were stopping the generators of the world and the world was crumbling quietly, like a body when its spirit is gone-then we began to wonder and to ask questions about him. We began to ask it of one another, those of us who had heard him say it. We began to think that he had kept his word, that he, who had seen and known the truth we refused to know, was the retribution we had called upon our heads, the avenger, the man of that justice which we had defied. We began to think that he had damned us and there was no escape from his verdict and we would never be able to get away from him-and this was the more terrible because he was not pursuing us, it was we who were suddenly looking for him and he had merely gone without a trace. We found no answer about him anywhere. We wondered by what sort of impossible power he could have done what he had promised to do. There was no answer to that. We began to think of him whenever we saw another collapse in the world, which nobody could explain, whenever we took another blow, whenever we lost another hope, whenever we felt caught in this dead, gray fog that\u0027s descending all over the earth. Perhaps people heard us crying that question and they did not know what we meant, but they knew too well the feeling that made us cry it. They, too, felt that something had gone from the world. Perhaps this was why they began to say it, whenever they felt that there was no hope. I\u0027d like to think that I am wrong, that those words mean nothing, that there\u0027s no conscious intention and no avenger behind the ending of the human race. But when I hear them repeating that question, I feel afraid. I think of the man who said that he would stop the motor of the world. You see, his name was John Galt.\" She awakened, because the sound of the wheels had changed. It was an irregular beat, with sudden screeches and short, sharp cracks, a sound like the broken laughter of hysteria, with the fitful jerking of the car to match it. She knew, before she glanced at her watch, that this was the track of the Kansas Western and that the train had started on its long detour south from Kirby, Nebraska. The train was half-empty; few people had ventured across the continent on the first Comet since the tunnel disaster. She had given a bedroom to the tramp, and then had remained alone with his story. She had wanted to think of it, of all the questions she intended to ask him tomorrow-but she had found her mind frozen and still, like a spectator staring at the story, unable to function, only to stare. She had felt as if she knew the meaning of that spectacle, knew it with no further questions and had to escape it. To move-had been the words beating in her mind with peculiar urgency-to move-as if movement had become an end in itself, crucial, absolute and doomed. Through a thin layer of sleep, the sound of the wheels had kept running a race with the growth of her tension. She had kept awakening, as in a causeless start of panic, finding herself upright in the darkness, thinking blankly: What was it?-then telling herself in reassurance: We\u0027re moving . . . we\u0027re still moving. . . . The track of the Kansas Western was worse than she had expected-she thought, listening to the wheels. The train was now carrying her hundreds of miles away from Utah. She had felt a desperate desire to get off the train on the main line, abandon all the problems of Taggart Transcontinental, find an airplane and fly straight to Quentin Daniels. It had taken a cheerless effort of will to remain in her car. She lay in the darkness, listening to the wheels, thinking that only Daniels and his motor still remained like a point of fire ahead, pulling her forward. Of what use would the motor now be to her? She had no answer. Why did she feel so certain of the desperate need to hurry? She had no answer. To reach him in time, was the only ultimatum left in her mind. She held onto it, asking no questions. Wordlessly, she knew the real answer: the motor was needed, not to move trains, but to keep her moving. She could not hear the beat of the fourth knocks any longer in the jumbled screeching of metal, she could not hear the steps of the enemy she was racing, only the hopeless stampede of panic. . . .I\u0027ll get there in time, she thought, I\u0027ll get there first, I\u0027ll save the motor. There\u0027s one motor he\u0027s not going to stop, she thought . . . he\u0027s not going to stop . . . he\u0027s not going to stop . . . He\u0027s not going to stop, she thought-awakening with a jolt, jerking her head off the pillow. The wheels had stopped. For a moment, she remained still, trying to grasp the peculiar stillness around her. It felt like the impossible attempt to create a sensory image of non-existence. There were no attributes of reality to perceive, nothing but their absence: no sound, as if she were alone on the train-no motion, as if this were not a train, but a room in a building-no light, as if this were neither train nor room, but space without objects-no sign of violence or physical disaster, as if this were the state where disaster is no longer possible. In the moment when she grasped the nature of the stillness, her body sprang upright with a single curve of motion, immediate and violent like a cry of rebellion. The loud screech of the window shade went like a knife-cut through the silence, as she threw the shade upward. There was nothing outside but anonymous stretches of prairie; a strong wind was breaking the clouds, and a shaft of moonlight fell through, but it fell upon plains that seemed as dead as those from which it came. The sweep of her hand pressed the light switch and the bell to summon the porter. The electric light came on and brought her back to a rational world. She glanced at her watch: it was a few minutes past midnight. She looked out of the rear window: the track went off in a straight line and, at the prescribed distance, she saw the red lanterns left on the ground, placed conscientiously to protect the rear of the train. The sight seemed reassuring. She pressed the porter\u0027s bell once more. She waited. She went to the vestibule, unlocked the door and leaned out to look down the line of the train. A few windows were lighted in the long, tapering band of steel, but she saw no figures, no sign of human activity. She slammed the door, came back and started to dress, her movements suddenly calm and swift. No one came to answer her bell. When she hastened across to the next car, she felt no fear, no uncertainty, no despair, nothing but the urgency of action. There was no porter in the cubbyhole of the next car, no porter in the car beyond. She hurried down the narrow passageways, meeting no one. But a few compartment doors were open. The passengers sat inside, dressed or half-dressed, silently, as if waiting. They watched her rush by with oddly furtive glances, as if they knew what she was after, as if they had expected someone to come and to face what they had not faced. She went on, running down the spinal cord of a dead train, noting the peculiar combination of lighted compartments, open doors and empty passages: no one had ventured to step out. No one had wanted to ask the first question. She ran through the train\u0027s only coach, where some passengers slept in contorted poses of exhaustion, while others, awake and still, sat hunched, like animals waiting for a blow, making no move to avert it In the vestibule of the coach, she stopped. She saw a man, who had unlocked the door and was leaning out, looking inquiringly ahead through the darkness, ready to step off. He turned at the sound of her approach. She recognized his face: it was Owen Kellogg, the man who had rejected the future she had once offered him. \"Kellogg!\" she gasped, the sound of laughter in her voice like a cry of relief at the sudden sight of a man in a desert. \"Hello, Miss Taggart,\" he answered, with an astonished smile that held a touch of incredulous pleasure-and of wistfulness. \"I didn\u0027t know you were aboard.\" \"Come on,\" she ordered, as if he were still an employee of the railroad. \"I think we\u0027re on a frozen train.\" \"We are,\" he said, and followed her with prompt, disciplined obedience. No explanations were necessary. It was as if, in unspoken understanding, they were answering a call to duty-and it seemed natural that of the hundreds aboard, it was the two of them who should be partners-in-danger. \"Any idea how long we\u0027ve been standing?\" she asked, as they hurried on through the next car. \"No,\" he said. \"We were standing when I woke up.\" They went the length of the train, finding no porters, no waiters in the diner, no brakemen, no conductor. They glanced at each other once in a while, but kept silent. They knew the stories of abandoned trains, of the crews that vanished in sudden bursts of rebellion against serfdom. They got off at the head end of the train, with no motion around them save the wind on their faces, and they climbed swiftly aboard the engine. The engine\u0027s headlight was on, stretching like an accusing arm into the void of the night. The engine\u0027s cab was empty. Her cry of desperate triumph broke out in answer to the shock of the sight: \"Good for them! They\u0027re human beings!\" She stopped, aghast, as at the cry of a stranger. She noticed that Kellogg stood watching her curiously, with the faint hint of a smile. It was an old steam engine, the best that the railroad had been able to provide for the Comet. The fire was banked in the grates, the steam gauge was low, and in the great windshield before them the headlight fell upon a band of ties that should have been running to meet them, but lay still instead, like a ladder\u0027s steps, counted, numbered and ended. She reached for the logbook and looked at the names of the train\u0027s last crew. The engineer had been Pat Logan. Her head dropped slowly, and she closed her eyes. She thought of the first run on a green-blue track, that must have been in Pat Logan\u0027s mind-as it was now in hers-through the silent hours of his last run on any rail. \"Miss Taggart?\" said Owen Kellogg softly. She jerked her head up. \"Yes,\" she said, \"yes . . . Well\"-her voice had no color except the metallic tinge of decision-\"we\u0027ll have to get to a phone and call for another crew.\" She glanced at her watch. \"At the rate we were running, I think we must be about eighty miles from the Oklahoma state line. I believe Bradshaw is this road\u0027s nearest division point to call. We\u0027re somewhere within thirty miles of it.\" \"Are there any Taggart trains following us?\" \"The next one is Number 253, the transcontinental freight, but it won\u0027t get here till about seven A.M., if it\u0027s running on time, which 1 doubt.\" \"Only one freight in seven hours?\" He said it involuntarily, with a note of outraged loyalty to the great railroad he had once been proud to serve. Her mouth moved in the brief snap of a smile. \"Our transcontinental traffic is not what it was in your day.\" He nodded slowly. \"I don\u0027t suppose there are any Kansas Western trains coming tonight, either?\" \"I can\u0027t remember offhand, but I think not.\" He glanced at the poles by the side of the track. \"I hope that the Kansas Western people have kept their phones in order.\" \"You mean that the chances are they haven\u0027t, if we judge by the state of their track. But we\u0027ll have to try it,\" \"Yes.\" She turned to go, but stopped. She knew it was useless to comment, but the words came involuntarily. \"You know,\" she said, \"it\u0027s those lanterns our men put behind the train to protect us that\u0027s the hardest thing to take. They . . . they felt more concern for human lives than their country had shown for theirs.\" His swift glance at her was like a shot of deliberate emphasis, then he answered gravely, \"Yes, Miss Taggart.\" Climbing down the ladder on the side of the engine, they saw a cluster of passengers gathered by the track and more figures emerging from the train to join them. By some special instinct of their own, the men who had sat waiting knew that someone had taken charge, someone had assumed the responsibility and it was now safe to show signs of life. They all looked at her with an air of inquiring expectation, as she approached. The unnatural pallor of the moonlight seemed to dissolve the differences of their faces and to stress the quality they all had in common: a look of cautious appraisal, part fear, part plea, part impertinence held in abeyance. \"Is there anyone here who wishes to be spokesman for the passengers?\" she asked. They looked at one another. There was no answer. \"Very well,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t have to speak. I\u0027m Dagny Taggart, the Operating Vice-President of this railroad, and\"-there was a rustle of response from the group, half-movement, half-whisper, resembling relief-\"and I\u0027ll do the speaking. We are on a train that has been abandoned by its crew. There was no physical accident. The engine is intact. But there is no one to run it. This is what the newspapers call a frozen train. You all know what it means-and you know the reasons. Perhaps you knew the reasons long before they were discovered by the men who deserted you tonight. The law forbade them to desert. But this will not help you now.\" A woman shrieked suddenly, with the demanding petulance of hysteria, \"What are we going to do?\" Dagny paused to look at her. The woman was pushing forward, to squeeze herself into the group, to place some human bodies between herself and the sight of the great vacuum-the plain stretching off and dissolving into moonlight, the dead phosphorescence of impotent, borrowed energy. The woman had a coat thrown over a nightgown; the coat was slipping open and her stomach protruded under the gown\u0027s thin cloth, with that loose obscenity of manner which assumes all human self-revelation to be ugliness and makes no effort to conceal it. For a moment, Dagny regretted the necessity to continue. \"I shall go down the track to a telephone,\" she continued, her voice clear and as cold as the moonlight. \"There are emergency telephones at intervals of five miles along the right-of-way. I shall call for another crew to be sent here. This will take some time. You will please stay aboard and maintain such order as you are capable of maintaining.\" \"What about the gangs of raiders?\" asked another woman\u0027s nervous voice. \"That\u0027s true,\" said Dagny. \"I\u0027d better have someone to accompany me. Who wishes to go?\" She had misunderstood the woman\u0027s motive. There was no answer. There were no glances directed at her or at one another. There were no eyes-only moist ovals glistening in the moonlight. There they were, she thought, the men of the new age, the demanders and recipients of self-sacrifice. She was struck by a quality of anger in their silence-an anger saying that she was supposed to spare them moments such as this-and, with a feeling of cruelty new to her, she remained silent by conscious intention. She noticed that Owen Kellogg, too, was waiting; but he was not watching the passengers, he was watching her face. When he became certain that there would be no answer from the crowd, he said quietly, \"I\u0027ll go with you, of course, Miss Taggart.\" \"Thank you.\" \"What about us?\" snapped the nervous woman. Dagny turned to her, answering in the formal, inflectionless monotone of a business executive, \"There have been no cases of raider gang attacks upon frozen trains-unfortunately.\" \"Just where are we?\" asked a bulky man with too expensive an overcoat and too flabby a face; his voice had a tone intended for servants by a man unfit to employ them. \"In what part of what state?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" she answered. \"How long will we be kept here?\" asked another, in the tone of a creditor who is imposed upon by a debtor. \"1 don\u0027t know.\" \"When will we get to San Francisco?\" asked a third, in the manner of a sheriff addressing a suspect. \"I don\u0027t know.\" The demanding resentment was breaking loose, in small, crackling puffs, like chestnuts popping open in the dark oven of the minds who now felt certain that they were taken care of and safe. \"This is perfectly outrageous!\" yelled a woman, springing forward, throwing her words at Dagny\u0027s face. \"You have no right to let this happen! I don\u0027t intend to be kept waiting in the middle of nowhere! I expect transportation!\" \"Keep your mouth shut,\" said Dagny, \"or I\u0027ll lock the train doors and leave you where you are.\" \"You can\u0027t do that! You\u0027re a common carrier! You have no right to discriminate against me! I\u0027ll report it to the Unification Board!\" \"-if I give you a train to get you within sight or hearing of your Board,\" said Dagny, turning away. She saw Kellogg looking at her, his glance like a line drawn under her words, underscoring them for her own attention. \"Get a flashlight somewhere,\" she said, \"while I go to get my handbag, then we\u0027ll start.\" When they started out on their way to the track phone, walking past the silent line of cars, they saw another figure descending from the train and hurrying to meet them. She recognized the tramp. \"Trouble, ma\u0027am?\" he asked, stopping. \"The crew has deserted.\" \"Oh. What\u0027s to be done?\" \"I\u0027m going to a phone to call the division point.\" \"You can\u0027t go alone, ma\u0027am. Not these days. I\u0027d better go with you.\" She smiled. \"Thanks. But I\u0027ll be all right. Mr. Kellogg here is going with me. Say-what\u0027s your name?\" \"Jeff Allen, ma\u0027am.\" \"Listen, Allen, have you ever worked for a railroad?\" \"No, ma\u0027am.\" \"Well, you\u0027re working for one now. You\u0027re deputy-conductor and proxy-vice-president-in-charge-of-operation. Your job is to take charge of this train in my absence, to preserve order and to keep the cattle from stampeding. Tell them that I appointed you. You don\u0027t need any proof. They\u0027ll obey anybody who expects obedience.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" he answered firmly, with a look of understanding. She remembered that money inside a man\u0027s pocket had the power to turn into confidence inside his mind; she took a hundred-dollar bill from her bag and slipped it into his hand. \"As advance on wages,\" she said. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" She had started off, when he called after her, \"Miss Taggart!\" She turned. \"Yes?\" \"Thank you,\" he said. She smiled, half-raising her hand in a parting salute, and walked on. \"Who is that?\" asked Kellogg. \"A tramp who was caught stealing a ride.\" \"He\u0027ll do the job, I think.\" \"He will.\" They walked silently past the engine and on in the direction of its headlight. At first, stepping from tie to tie, with the violent light beating against them from behind, they still felt as if they were at home in the normal realm of a railroad. Then she found herself watching the light on the ties under her feet, watching it ebb slowly, trying to hold it, to keep seeing its fading glow, until she knew that the hint of a glow on the wood was no longer anything but moonlight. She could not prevent the shudder that made her turn to look back. The headlight still hung behind them, like the liquid silver globe of a planet, deceptively close, but belonging to another orbit and another system. Owen Kellogg walked silently beside her, and she felt certain that they knew each other\u0027s thoughts. \"He couldn\u0027t have. Oh God, he couldn\u0027t!\" she said suddenly, not realizing that she had switched to words. \"Who?\" \"Nathaniel Taggart. He couldn\u0027t have worked with people like those passengers. He couldn\u0027t have run trains for them. He couldn\u0027t have employed them. He couldn\u0027t have used them at all, neither as customers nor as workers.\" Kellogg smiled. \"You mean that he couldn\u0027t have grown rich by exploiting them, Miss Taggart?\" She nodded. \"They . . .\" she said, and he heard the faint trembling of her voice, which was love and pain and indignation, \"they\u0027ve said for years that he rose by thwarting the ability of others, by leaving them no chance, and that . . . that human incompetence was to his selfish interest. . . . But he . . . it wasn\u0027t obedience that he required of people.\" \"Miss Taggart,\" he said, with an odd note of sternness in his voice, \"just remember that he represented a code of existence which-for a brief span in all human history-drove slavery out of the civilized world. Remember it, when you feel baffled by the nature of his enemies.\" \"Have you ever heard of a woman named Ivy Starnes?\" \"Oh yes.\" \"I keep thinking that this was what she would have enjoyed-the spectacle of those passengers tonight. This was what she\u0027s after. But we-we can\u0027t live with it, you and I, can we? No one can live with it. It\u0027s not possible to live with it.\" \"What makes you think that Ivy Starnes\u0027s purpose is life?\" Somewhere on the edge of her mind-like the wisps she saw floating on the edges of the prairie, neither quite rays nor fog nor cloud-she felt some shape which she could not grasp, half-suggested and demanding to be grasped. She did not speak, and-like the links of a chain unrolling through their silence-the rhythm of their steps went on, spaced to the ties, scored by the dry, swift beat of heels on wood. She had not had time to be aware of him, except as of a providential comrade-in-competence; now she glanced at him with conscious attention. His face had the clear, hard look she remembered having liked in the past. But the face had grown calmer, as if more serenely at peace. His clothes were threadbare. He wore an old leather jacket, and even in the darkness she could distinguish the scuffed blotches streaking across the leather. \"What have you been doing since you left Taggart Transcontinental?\" she asked. \"Oh, many things.\" \"Where are you working now?\" \"On special assignments, more or less.\" \"Of what kind?\" \"Of every kind.\" \"You\u0027re not working for a railroad?\" \"No.\" The sharp brevity of the sound seemed to expand it into an eloquent statement. She knew that he knew her motive. \"Kellogg, if I told you that I don\u0027t have a single first-rate man left on the Taggart system, if I offered you any job, any terms, any money you cared to name-would you come back to us?\" \"No.\" \"You were shocked by our loss of traffic. I don\u0027t think you have any idea of what our loss of men has done to us. I can\u0027t tell you the sort of agony I went through three days ago, trying to find somebody able to build five miles of temporary track. I have fifty miles to build through the Rockies. I see no way to do it. But it has to be done. I\u0027ve combed the country for men. There aren\u0027t any. And then to run into you suddenly, to find you here, in a day coach, when I\u0027d give half the system for one employee like you-do you understand why I can\u0027t let you go? Choose anything you wish. Want to be general manager of a region? Or assistant operating vice-president?\" \"No.\" \"You\u0027re still working for a living, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Yes.\" \"You don\u0027t seem to be making very much.\" \"I\u0027m making enough for my needs-and for nobody else\u0027s.\" \"Why are you willing to work for anyone but Taggart Transcontinental?\" \"Because you wouldn\u0027t give me the kind of job I\u0027d want.\" \"I?\" She stopped still. \"Good God, Kellogg!-haven\u0027t you understood? I\u0027d give you any job you name!\" \"All right. Track walker.\" \"What?\" \"Section hand. Engine wiper.\" He smiled at the look on her face. \"No? You see, I said you wouldn\u0027t.\" \"Do you mean that you\u0027d take a day laborer\u0027s job?\" \"Any time you offered it.\" \"But nothing better?\" \"That\u0027s right, nothing better.\" \"Don\u0027t you understand that I have too many men who\u0027re able to do those jobs, but nothing better?\" \"I understand it, Miss Taggart. Do you?\" \"What I need is your-\" \"-mind, Miss Taggart? My mind is not on the market any longer.\" She stood looking at him, her face growing harder. \"You\u0027re one of them, aren\u0027t you?\" she said at last. \"Of whom?\" She did not answer, shrugged and went on, \"Miss Taggart,\" he asked, \"how long will you remain willing to be a common carrier?\" \"I won\u0027t surrender the world to the creature you\u0027re quoting.\" \"The answer you gave her was much more realistic.\" The chain of their steps had stretched through many silent minutes before she asked, \"Why did you stand by me tonight? Why were you willing to help me?\" He answered easily, almost gaily, \"Because there isn\u0027t a passenger on that train who needs to get where he\u0027s going more urgently than I do. If the train can be started, none will profit more than I. But when I need something, I don\u0027t sit and expect transportation, like that creature of yours.\" \"You don\u0027t? And what if all trains stopped running?\" \"Then I wouldn\u0027t count on making a crucial journey by train.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"West.\" \"On a \u0027special assignment\u0027?\" \"No. For a month\u0027s vacation with some friends.\" \"A vacation? And it\u0027s that important to you?\" \"More important than anything on earth.\" They had walked two miles when they came to the small gray box on a post by the trackside, which was the emergency telephone. The box hung sidewise, beaten by storms. She jerked it open. The telephone was there, a familiar, reassuring object, glinting in the beam of Kellogg\u0027s flashlight. But she knew, the moment she pressed the receiver to her ear, and he knew, when he saw her finger tapping sharply against the hook, that the telephone was dead. She handed the receiver to him without a word. She held the flashlight, while he went swiftly over the instrument, then tore it off the wall and studied the wires. \"The wire\u0027s okay,\" he said. \"The current\u0027s on. It\u0027s this particular instrument that\u0027s out of order. There\u0027s a chance that the next one might be working.\" He added, \"The next one is five miles away.\" \"Let\u0027s go,\" she said. Far behind them, the engine\u0027s headlight was still visible, not a planet any longer, but a small star winking, through mists of distance. Ahead of them, the rail went off into bluish space, with nothing to mark its end. She realized how often she had glanced back at that headlight; so long as it remained in sight, she had felt as if a life-line were holding them anchored safely; now they had to break it and dive into . . .and dive off this planet, she thought. She noticed that Kellogg, too, stood looking back at the headlight. They glanced at each other, but said nothing. The crunch of a pebble under her shoe sole burst like a firecracker in the silence. With a coldly intentional movement, he kicked the telephone instrument and sent it rolling into a ditch: the violence of the noise shattered the vacuum. \"God damn him,\" he said evenly, not raising his voice, with a loathing past any display of emotion. \"He probably didn\u0027t feel like attending to his job, and since he needed his pay check, nobody had the right to ask that he keep the phones in order.\" \"Come on,\" she said. \"We can rest, if you feel tired, Miss Taggart.\" \"I\u0027m all right. We have no time to feel tired.\" \"That\u0027s our great error, Miss Taggart. We ought to take the time, some day.\" She gave a brief chuckle, she stepped onto a tie of the track, stressing the step as her answer, and they went on. It was hard, walking on ties, but when they tried to walk along the trackside, they found that it was harder. The soil, half-sand, half-dust, sank under their heels, like the soft, unresisting spread of some substance that was neither liquid nor solid. They went back to walking from tie to tie; it was almost like stepping from log to log in the midst of a river. She thought of what an enormous distance five miles had suddenly become, and that a division point thirty miles away was now unattainable-after an era of railroads built by men who thought in thousands of transcontinental miles. That net of rails and lights, spreading from ocean to ocean, hung on the snap of a wire, on a broken connection inside a rusty phone-no, she thought, on something much more powerful and much more delicate. It hung on the connections in the minds of the men who knew that the existence of a wire, of a train, of a job, of themselves and their actions was an absolute not to be escaped. When such minds were gone, a two thousand-ton train was left at the mercy of the muscles of her legs. Tired?-she thought; even the strain of walking was a value, a small piece of reality in the stillness around them. The sensation of effort was a specific experience, it was pain and could be nothing else-in the midst of a space which was neither light nor dark, a soil which neither gave nor resisted, a fog which neither moved nor hung still. Their strain was the only evidence of their motion: nothing changed in the emptiness around them, nothing took form to mark their progress. She had always wondered, in incredulous contempt, about the sects that preached the annihilation of the universe as the ideal to be attained. There, she thought, was their world and the content of their minds made real. When the green light of a signal appeared by the track, it gave them a point to reach and pass, but-incongruous in the midst of the floating dissolution-it brought them no sense of relief. It seemed to come from a long since extinguished world, like those stars whose light remains after they are gone. The green circle glowed in space, announcing a clear track, inviting motion where there was nothing to move. Who was that philosopher, she thought, who preached that motion exists without any moving entities? This was his world, too. She found herself pushing forward with increasing effort, as if against some resistance that was, not pressure, but suction. Glancing at Kellogg, she saw that he, too, was walking like a man braced against a storm. She felt as if the two of them were the sole survivors of . . . of reality, she thought-two lonely figures fighting, not through a storm, but worse: through non-existence. It was Kellogg who glanced back, after a while, and she followed his glance: there was no headlight behind them. They did not stop. Looking straight ahead, he reached absently into his pocket; she felt certain that the movement was involuntary; he produced a package of cigarettes and extended it to her. She was about to take a cigarette-then, suddenly, she seized his wrist and tore the package out of his hand. It was a plain white package that bore, as single imprint, the sign of the dollar. \"Give me the flashlight!\" she ordered, stopping. He stopped obediently and sent the beam of the flashlight at the package in her hands. She caught a glimpse of his face: he looked a little astonished and very amused. There was no printing on the package, no trade name, no address, only the dollar sign stamped in gold. The cigarettes bore the same sign. \"Where did you get this?\" she asked. He was smiling. \"If you know enough to ask that, Miss Taggart, you should know that I won\u0027t answer.\" \"I know that this stands for something.\" \"The dollar sign? For a great deal. It stands on the vest of every fat, pig like figure in every cartoon, for the purpose of denoting a crook, a grafter, a scoundrel-as the one sure-fire brand of evil. It stands-as the money of a free country-for achievement, for success, for ability, for man\u0027s creative power-and, precisely for these reasons, it is used as a brand of infamy. It stands stamped on the forehead of a man like Hank Rearden, as a mark of damnation. Incidentally, do you know where that sign comes from? It stands for the initials of the United States.\" He snapped the flashlight off, but he did not move to go; she could distinguish the hint of his bitter smile. \"Do you know that the United States is the only country in history that has ever used its own monogram as a symbol of depravity? Ask yourself why. Ask yourself how long a country that did that could hope to exist, and whose moral standards have destroyed it. It was the only country in history where wealth was not acquired by looting, but by production, not by force, but by trade, the only country whose money was the symbol of man\u0027s right to his own mind, to his work, to his life, to his happiness, to himself. If this is evil, by the present standards of the world, if this is the reason for damning us, then we -we, the dollar chasers and makers-accept it and choose to be damned by that world. We choose to wear the sign of the dollar on our foreheads, proudly, as our badge of nobility-the badge we are willing to live for and, if need be, to die.\" He extended his hand for the package. She held it as if her fingers would not let it go, but gave up and placed it on his palm. With deliberate slowness, as if to underscore the meaning of his gesture, he offered her a cigarette. She took it and placed it between her lips. He took one for himself, struck a match, lighted both, and they walked on. They walked, over rotting logs that sank without resistance into the shifting ground, through a vast, uncongealed globe of moonlight and coiling mist-with two spots of living fire in their hands and the glow of two small circles to light their faces. \"Fire, a dangerous force, tamed at his fingertips . . .\" she remembered the old man saying to her, the old man who had said that these cigarettes were not made anywhere on earth. \"When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind-and it\u0027s proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression.\" \"I wish you\u0027d tell me who makes them,\" she said, in the tone of a hopeless plea. He chuckled good-naturedly. \"I can tell you this much: they\u0027re made by a friend of mine, for sale, but-not being a common carrier -he sells them only to his friends.\" \"Sell me that package, will you?\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to afford it, Miss Taggart, but-all right, if you wish.\" \"How much is it?\" \"Five cents.\" \"Five cents?\" she repeated, bewildered. \"Five cents-\" he said, and added, \"in gold.\" She stopped, staring at him. \"In gold?\" \"Yes, Miss Taggart.\" \"Well, what\u0027s your rate of exchange? How much is it in our normal money?\" \"There is no rate of exchange, Miss Taggart. No amount of physical-or spiritual-currency, whose sole standard of value is the decree of Mr. Wesley Mouch, will buy these cigarettes.\" \"I see.\" He reached into his pocket, took out the package and handed it to her. \"I\u0027ll give them to you, Miss Taggart,\" he said, \"because you\u0027ve earned them many times over-and because you need them for the same purpose we do.\" \"What purpose?\" \"To remind us-in moments of discouragement, in the loneliness of exile-of our true homeland, which has always been yours, too, Miss Taggart.\" \u0027Thank you,\" she said. She put the cigarettes in her pocket; he saw that her hand was trembling. When they reached the fourth of the five mileposts, they had been silent for a long time, with no strength left for anything but the effort of moving their feet. Far ahead, they saw a dot of light, too low on the horizon and too harshly clear to be a star. They kept watching it, as they walked, and said nothing until they became certain that it was a powerful electric beacon blazing in the midst of the empty prairie. \"What is that?\" she asked. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"It looks like-\" \"No,\" she broke in hastily, \"it couldn\u0027t be. Not around here.\" She did not want to hear him name the hope which she had felt for many minutes past. She could not permit herself to think of it or to know that the thought was hope. They found the telephone box at the fifth milepost. The beacon hung like a violent spot of cold fire, less than half a mile farther south. The telephone was working. She heard the buzz of the wire, like the breath of a living creature, when she lifted the receiver. Then a drawling voice answered, \"Jessup, at Bradshaw.\" The voice sounded sleepy. \"This is Dagny Taggart, speaking from-\" \"Who?\" \"Dagny Taggart, of Taggart Transcontinental, speaking-\" \"Oh . . . Oh yes . . . I see . . . Yes?\" \"-speaking from your track phone Number 83. The Comet is stalled seven miles north of here. It\u0027s been abandoned. The crew has deserted.\" There was a pause. \"Well, what do you want me to do about it?\" She had to pause in turn, in order to believe it. \"Are you the night dispatcher?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Then send another crew out to us at once.\" \"A full passenger train crew?\" \"Of course.\" \"Now?\" \"Yes.\" There was a pause. \"The rules don\u0027t say anything about that.\" \"Get me the chief dispatcher,\" she said, choking. \"He\u0027s away on his vacation.\" \"Get the division superintendent.\" \"He\u0027s gone down to Laurel for a couple of days.\" \"Get me somebody who\u0027s in charge.\" \"I\u0027m in charge.\" \"Listen,\" she said slowly, fighting for patience, \"do you understand that there\u0027s a train, a passenger limited, abandoned in the middle of the prairie?\" \"Yeah, but how am I to know what I\u0027m supposed to do about it? The rules don\u0027t provide for it. Now if you had an accident, we\u0027d send out the wrecker, but if there was no accident . . . you don\u0027t need the wrecker, do you?\" \"No. We don\u0027t need the wrecker. We need men. Do you understand? Living men to run an engine.\" \"The rules don\u0027t say anything about a train without men. Or about men without a train. There\u0027s no rule for calling out a full crew in the middle of the night and sending them to hunt for a train somewhere. I\u0027ve never heard of it before.\" \"You\u0027re hearing it now. Don\u0027t you know what you have to do?\" \"Who am I to know?\" \"Do you know that your job is to keep trains moving?\" \"My job is to obey the rules. If I send out a crew when I\u0027m not supposed to, God only knows what\u0027s going to happen! What with the Unification Board and all the regulations they\u0027ve got nowadays, who am I to take it upon myself?\" \"And what\u0027s going to happen if you leave a train stalled on the line?\" \"That\u0027s not my fault. I had nothing to do with it. They can\u0027t blame me. I couldn\u0027t help it.\" \"You\u0027re to help it now.\" \"Nobody told me to.\" \"I\u0027m telling you to!\" \"How do I know whether you\u0027re supposed to tell me or not? We\u0027re not supposed to furnish any Taggart crews. You people were to run with your own crews. That\u0027s what we were told.\" \"But this is an emergency!\" \"Nobody told me anything about an emergency.\" She had to take a few seconds to control herself. She saw Kellogg watching her with a bitter smile of amusement. \"Listen,\" she said into the phone, \"do you know that the Comet was due at Bradshaw over three hours ago?\" \"Oh, sure. But nobody\u0027s going to make any trouble about that. No train\u0027s ever on schedule these days,\" \"Then do you intend to leave us blocking your track forever?\" \"We\u0027ve got nothing due till Number 4, the northbound passenger out of Laurel, at eight thirty-seven A.M. You can wait till then. The day-trick dispatcher will be on then. You can speak to him.\" \"You blasted idiot! This is the Comet!\" \"What\u0027s that to me? This isn\u0027t Taggart Transcontinental. You people expect a lot for your money. You\u0027ve been nothing but a headache to us with all the extra work at no extra pay for the little fellows.\" His voice was slipping into whining insolence. \"You can\u0027t talk to me that way. The time\u0027s past when you could talk to people that way.\" She had never believed that there were men with whom a certain method, which she had never used, would work; such men were not hired by Taggart Transcontinental and she had never been forced to deal with them before. \"Do you know who I am?\" she asked, in the cold, overbearing tone of a personal threat. It worked. \"I . . . I guess so,\" he answered. \"Then let me tell you that if you don\u0027t send a crew to me at once, you\u0027ll be out of a job within one hour after I reach Bradshaw, which I\u0027ll reach sooner or later. You\u0027d better make it sooner.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" he said. \"Call out a full passenger train crew and give them orders to run us to Laurel, where we have our own men.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" He added, \"Will you tell headquarters that it was you who told me to do it?\" \"I will.\" \"And that it\u0027s you who\u0027re responsible for it?\" \"I am.\" There was a pause, then he asked helplessly, \"Now how am I going to call the men? Most of them haven\u0027t got any phones.\" \"Do you have a call boy?\" \"Yes, but he won\u0027t get here till morning.\" \"Is there anybody in the yards right now?\" \"There\u0027s the wiper in the roundhouse.\" \"Send him out to call the men.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am. Hold the line.\" She leaned against the side of the phone box, to wait. Kellogg was smiling. \"And you propose to run a railroad-a transcontinental railroad- with that?\" he asked. She shrugged. She could not keep her eyes off the beacon. It seemed so close, so easily within her reach. She felt as if the unconfessed thought were struggling furiously against her, splattering bits of the struggle all over her mind: A man able to harness an untapped source of energy, a man working on a motor to make all other motors useless . . . she could be talking to him, to his kind of brain, in a few hours . . . in just a few hours. . . . What if there was no need to hurry to him? It was what she wanted to do. It was all she wanted. . . . Her work? What was her work: to move on to the fullest, most exacting use of her mind-or to spend the rest of her life doing his thinking for a man unfit to be a night dispatcher? Why had she chosen to work? Was it in order to remain where she had started-night operator of Rockdale Station-no, lower than that-she had been better than that dispatcher, even at Rockdale-was this to be the final sum: an end lower than her beginning? . . . There was no reason to hurry? She was the reason. . . . They needed the trains, but they did not need the motor? She needed the motor. . . . Her duty? To whom? The dispatcher was gone for a long time; when he came back, his voice sounded sulky: \"Well, the wiper says he can get the men all right, but it\u0027s no use, because how am I going to send them out to you? We have no engine.\" \"No engine?\" \"No. The superintendent took one to run down to Laurel, and the other\u0027s in the shops, been there for weeks, and the switch engine jumped a rail this morning, they\u0027ll be working on her till tomorrow afternoon.\" \"What about the wrecker\u0027s engine that you were offering to send us?\" \"Oh, she\u0027s up north. They had a wreck there yesterday. She hasn\u0027t come back yet.\" \"Have you a Diesel car?\" \"Never had any such thing. Not around here.\" \"Have you a track motor car?\" \"Yes. We have that.\" \"Send them out on the track motor car.\" \"Oh . . . Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"Tell your men to stop here, at track phone Number 83, to pick up Mr. Kellogg and myself.\" She was looking at the beacon, \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"Call the Taggart trainmaster at Laurel, report the Comet\u0027s delay and explain to him what happened.\" She put her hand into her pocket and suddenly clutched her fingers: she felt the package of cigarettes. \"Say-\" she asked, \"what\u0027s that beacon, about half a mile from here?\" \"From where you are? Oh, that must be the emergency landing field of the Flagship Airlines.\" \"I see . . . Well, that\u0027s all. Get your men started at once. Tell them to pick up Mr. Kellogg by track phone Number 83.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" She hung up. Kellogg was grinning. \"An airfield, isn\u0027t it?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" She stood looking at the beacon, her hand still clutching the cigarettes in her pocket. \"So they\u0027re going to pick up Mr. Kellogg, are they?\" She whirled to him, realizing what decision her mind had been reaching without her conscious knowledge. \"No,\" she said, \"no, I didn\u0027t mean to abandon you here. It\u0027s only that I, too, have a crucial purpose out west, where I ought to hurry, so I was thinking of trying to catch a plane, but I can\u0027t do it and it\u0027s not necessary.\" \"Come on,\" he said, starting in the direction of the airfield. \"But I-\" \"If there\u0027s anything you want to do more urgently than to nurse those morons-go right ahead.\" \"More urgently than anything in the world,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027ll undertake to remain in charge for you and to deliver the Comet to your man at Laurel.\" \"Thank you . . . But if you\u0027re hoping . . . I\u0027m not deserting, you know.\" \"I know.\" \"Then why are you so eager to help me?\" \"I just want you to see what it\u0027s like to do something you want, for once.\" \"There\u0027s not much chance that they\u0027ll have a plane at that field.\" \"There\u0027s a good chance that they will.\" There were two planes on the edge of the airfield: one, the half charred remnant of a wreck, not worth salvaging for scrap-the other, a Dwight Sanders monoplane, brand-new, the kind of ship that men were pleading for, in vain, all over the country. There was one sleepy attendant at the airfield, young, pudgy and, but for a faint smell of college about his vocabulary, a brain brother of the night dispatcher of Bradshaw. He knew nothing about the two planes: they had been there when he first took this job a year ago. He had never inquired about them and neither had anybody else. In whatever silent crumbling had gone on at the distant headquarters, in the slow dissolution of a great airline company, the Sanders monoplane had been forgotten-as assets of this nature were being forgotten everywhere . . . as the model of the motor had been forgotten on a junk pile and, left in plain sight, had conveyed nothing to the inheritors and the takers-over. . . .There were no rules to tell the young attendant whether he was expected to keep the Sanders plane or not. The decision was made for him by the brusque, confident manner of the two strangers-by the credentials of Miss Dagny Taggart, Vice-President of a railroad-by brief hints about a secret, emergency mission, which sounded like Washington to him-by the mention of an agreement with the airline\u0027s top officials in New York, whose names he had never heard before-by a check for fifteen thousand dollars, written by Miss Taggart, as deposit against the return of the Sanders plane-and by another check, for two hundred bucks, for his own, personal courtesy. He fueled the plane, he checked it as best he could, he found a map of the country\u0027s airports-and she saw that a landing field on the outskirts of Afton, Utah, was marked as still in existence. She had been too tensely, swiftly active to feel anything, but at the last moment, when the attendant switched on the floodlights, when she was about to climb aboard, she paused to glance at the emptiness of the sky, then at Owen Kellogg. He stood, alone in the white glare, his feet planted firmly apart, on an island of cement in a ring of blinding lights, with nothing beyond the ring but an irredeemable night-and she wondered which one of them was taking the greater chance and facing the more desolate emptiness, \"In case anything happens to me,\" she said, \"will you tell Eddie Willers in my office to give Jeff Allen a job, as I promised?\" \"I will. . . . Is this all you wish to be done . . . in case anything happens?\" She considered it and smiled sadly, in astonishment at the realization. \"Yes, I guess that\u0027s all . . . Except, tell Hank Rearden what happened and that I asked you to tell him.\" \"I will.\" She lifted her head and said firmly, \"I don\u0027t expect it to happen, however. When you reach Laurel, call Winston, Colorado, and tell them that I will be there tomorrow by noon.\" \"Yes, Miss Taggart.\" She wanted to extend her hand in parting, but it seemed inadequate, and then she remembered what he had said about times of loneliness. She took out the package and silently offered him one of his own cigarettes. His smile was a full statement of understanding, and the small flame of his match lighting their two cigarettes was their most enduring handshake. Then she climbed aboard-and the next span of her consciousness was not separate moments and movements, but the sweep of a single motion and a single unit of time, a progression forming one entity, like the notes of a piece of music: from the touch of her hand on the starter-to the blast of the motor\u0027s sound that broke off, like a mountain rockslide, all contact with the time behind her-to the circling fall of a blade that vanished in a fragile sparkle of whirling air that cut the space ahead-to the start for the runway-to the brief pause-then to the forward thrust-to the long, perilous run, the run not to be obstructed, the straight line ran that gathers power by spending it on a harder and harder and ever-accelerating effort, the straight line to a purpose-to the moment, unnoticed., when the earth drops off and the line, unbroken, goes on into space in the simple, natural act of rising. She saw the telegraph wires of the trackside slipping past at the tip of her toes. The earth was falling downward, and she felt as if its weight were dropping off her ankles, as if the globe would go shrinking to the size of a ball, a convict\u0027s ball she had dragged and lost. Her body swayed, drunk with the shock of a discovery, and her craft rocked with her body, and it was the earth below that reeled with the rocking of her craft-the discovery that her life was now in her own hands, that there was no necessity to argue, to explain, to teach, to plead, to fight-nothing but to see and think and act. Then the earth steadied into a wide black sheet that grew wider and wider as she circled, rising. When she glanced down for the last time, the lights of the field were extinguished, there was only the single beacon left and it looked like the tip of Kellogg\u0027s cigarette, glowing as a last salute in the darkness. Then she was left with the lights on her instrument panel and the spread of stars beyond her film of glass. There was nothing to support her but the beat of the engine and the minds of the men who had made the plane. But what else supports one anywhere?-she thought. The line of her course went northwest, to cut a diagonal across the state of Colorado. She knew she had chosen the most dangerous route, over too long a stretch of the worst mountain barrier-but it was the shortest line, and safety lay in altitude, and no mountains seemed dangerous compared to the dispatcher of Bradshaw. The stars were like foam and the sky seemed full of flowing motion, the motion of bubbles settling and forming, the floating of circular waves without progression. A spark of light flared up on earth once in a while, and it seemed brighter than all the static blue above. But it hung alone, between the black of ashes and the blue of a crypt, it seemed to fight for its fragile foothold, it greeted her and went. The pale streak of a river came rising slowly from the void, and for a long stretch of time it remained in sight, gliding imperceptibly to meet her. It looked like a phosphorescent vein showing through the skin of the earth, a delicate vein without blood. When she saw the lights of a town, like a handful of gold coins flung upon the prairie, the brightly violent lights fed by an electric current, they seemed as distant as the stars and now as unattainable. The energy that had lighted them was gone, the power that created power stations in empty prairies had vanished, and she knew of no journey to recapture it. Yet these had been her stars-she thought, looking down-these had been her goal, her beacon, the aspiration drawing her upon her upward course. That which others claimed to feel at the sight of the stars-stars safely distant by millions of years and thus imposing no obligation to act, but serving as the tinsel of futility-she had felt at the sight of electric bulbs lighting the streets of a town. It was this earth below that had been the height she had wanted to reach, and she wondered how she had come to lose it, who had made of it a convict\u0027s ball to drag through muck, who had turned its promise of greatness into a vision never to be reached. But the town was past, and she had to look ahead, to the mountains of Colorado rising in her way. The small glass dial on her panel showed that she was now climbing. The sound of the engine, beating through the metal shell around her, trembling in the wheel against her palms, like the pounding of a heart strained to a solemn effort, told her of the power carrying her above the peaks. The earth was now a crumpled sculpture that swayed from side to side, the shape of an explosion still shooting sudden spurts to reach the plane. She saw them as dented black cuts ripping through the milky spread of stars, straight in her path and tearing wider. Her mind one with her body and her body one with the plane, she fought the invisible suction drawing her downward, she fought the sudden gusts that tipped the earth as if she were about to roll off into the sky, with half of the mountains rolling after. It was like fighting a frozen ocean where the touch of a single spray would be fatal. There were stretches of rest when the mountains shrank down, over valleys filled with fog. Then the fog rose higher to swallow the earth and she was left suspended in space, left motionless but for the sound of the engine. But she did not need to see the earth. The instrument panel was now her power of sight-it was the condensed sight of the best minds able to guide her on her way. Their condensed sight, she thought, offered to hers and requiring only that she be able to read it. How had they been paid for it, they, the sight-givers? From condensed milk to condensed music to the condensed sight of precision instruments-what wealth had they not given to the world and what had they received in return? Where were they now? Where was Dwight Sanders? Where was the inventor of her motor? The fog was lifting-and in a sudden clearing, she saw a drop of fire on a spread of rock. It was not an electric light, it was a lonely flame in the darkness of the earth. She knew where she was and she knew that flame: it was Wyatt\u0027s Torch. She was coming close to her goal. Somewhere behind her, in the northeast, stood the summits pierced by the Taggart Tunnel. The mountains were sliding in a long descent into the steadier soil of Utah. She let her plane slip closer to the earth. The stars were vanishing, the sky was growing darker, but in the bank of clouds to the east thin cracks were beginning to appear-first as threads, then faint spots of reflection, then straight bands that were not yet pink, but no longer blue, the color of a future light, the first hints of the coming sunrise. They kept appearing and vanishing, slowly growing clearer, leaving the sky darker, then breaking it wider apart, like a promise struggling to be fulfilled. She heard a piece of music beating in her mind, one she seldom liked to recall: not Halley\u0027s Fifth Concerto, but his Fourth, the cry of a tortured struggle, with the chords of its theme breaking through, like a distant vision to be reached. She saw the Afton airport from across a span of miles, first as a square of sparks, then as a sunburst of white rays. It was lighted for a plane about to take off, and she had to wait for her landing. Circling in the outer darkness above the field, she saw the silver body of a plane rising like a phoenix out of the white fire and-in a straight line, almost leaving an instant\u0027s trail of light to hang in space behind it-going off toward the east. Then she swept down in its stead, to dive into the luminous funnel of beams-she saw a strip of cement flying at her face, she felt the jolt of the wheels stopping it in time, then the streak of her motion ebbing out and the plane being tamed to the safety of a car, as it taxied smoothly off the runway. It was a small private airfield, serving the meager traffic of a few industrial concerns still remaining in Afton, She saw a lone attendant hurrying to meet her. She leaped down to the ground the moment the plane stood still, the hours of the flight swept from her mind by the impatience over the stretch of a few more minutes. \"Can I get a car somewhere to drive me to the Institute of Technology at once?\" she asked. The attendant looked at her, puzzled. \"Why, yes, I guess so, ma\u0027am. But . . . but what for? There\u0027s nobody there.\" \"Mr. Quentin Daniels is there.\" The attendant shook his head slowly-then jerked his thumb, pointing east to the shrinking taillights of the plane. \"There\u0027s Mr. Daniels going now.\" \"What?\" \"He just left.\" \"Left? Why?\" \"He went with the man who flew in for him two-three hours ago.\" \"What man?\" \"Don\u0027t know, never saw him before, but, boy!-he\u0027s got a beauty of a ship!\" She was back at the wheel, she was speeding down the runway, she was rising into the air, her plane like a bullet aimed at two sparks of red and green light that were twinkling away into the eastern sky-while she was still repeating, \"Oh no, they don\u0027t! They don\u0027t! They don\u0027t! They don\u0027t!\" Once and for all-she thought, clutching the wheel as if it were the enemy not to be relinquished, her words like separate explosions with a trail of fire in her mind to link them-once and for all . . . to meet the destroyer face to face . . . to learn who he is and where he goes to vanish . . . not the motor . . . he is not to carry the motor away into the darkness of his monstrously closed unknown . . . he is not to escape, this time. . . . A band of light was rising in the east and it seemed to come from the earth, as a breath long-held and released. In the deep blue above it, the stranger\u0027s plane was a single spark changing color and flashing from side to side, like the tip of a pendulum swinging in the darkness, beating time. The curve of distance made the spark drop closer to the earth, and she pushed her throttle wide open, not to let the spark out of her sight, not to let it touch the horizon and vanish. The light was flowing into the sky, as if drawn from the earth by the stranger\u0027s plane. The plane was headed southeast, and she was following it into the coming sunrise. From the transparent green of ice, the sky melted into pale gold, and the gold spread into a lake under a fragile film of pink glass, the color of that forgotten morning which was the first she had seen on earth. The clouds were dropping away in long shreds of smoky blue. She kept her eyes on the stranger\u0027s plane, as if her glance were a towline pulling her ship. The stranger\u0027s plane was now a small black cross, like a shrinking check mark on the glowing sky. Then she noticed that the clouds were not dropping, that they stood congealed on the edge of the earth-and she realized that the plane was headed toward the mountains of Colorado, that the struggle against the invisible storm lay ahead for her once more. She noted it without emotion; she did not wonder whether her ship or her body had the power to attempt it again. So long as she was able to move, she would move to follow the speck that was fleeing away with the last of her world. She felt nothing but the emptiness left by a fire that had been hatred and anger and the desperate impulse of a fight to the kill; these had fused into a single icy streak, the single resolve to follow the stranger, whoever he was, wherever he took her, to follow and . . . she added nothing in her mind, but, unstated, what lay at the bottom of the emptiness was: and give her life, if she could take his first. Like an instrument set to automatic control, her body was performing the motions of driving the plane-with the mountains reeling in a bluish fog below and the dented peaks rising in her path as smoky formations of a deadlier blue. She noticed that the distance to the stranger\u0027s plane had shrunk: he had checked his speed for the dangerous crossing, while she had gone on, unconscious of the danger, with only the muscles of her arms and legs fighting to keep her plane aloft. A brief, tight movement of her lips was as close as she could come to a smile: it was he who was flying her plane for her, she thought; he had given her the power to follow him with a somnambulist\u0027s unerring skill. As if responding of itself to his control, the needle of her altimeter was slowly moving upward. She was rising and she went on rising and she wondered when her breath and her propeller would fail. He was going southeast, toward the highest mountains that obstructed the path of the sun. It was his plane that was struck by the first sunray. It flashed for an instant, like a burst of white fire, sending rays to shoot from its wings. The peaks of the mountains came next: she saw the sunlight reaching the snow in the crevices, then trickling down the granite sides; it cut violent shadows on the ledges and brought the mountains into the living finality of a form. They were flying over the wildest stretch of Colorado, uninhabited, uninhabitable, inaccessible to men on foot or plane. No landing was possible within a radius of a hundred miles; she glanced at her fuel gauge: she had one half-hour left. The stranger was heading straight toward another, higher range. She wondered why he chose a course no air route did or ever would travel. She wished this range were behind her; it was the last effort she could hope to make. The stranger\u0027s plane was suddenly slacking its speed. He was losing altitude just when she had expected him to climb. The granite barrier was rising in his path, moving to meet him, reaching for his wings-but the long, smooth line of his motion was sliding down. She could detect no break, no jolt, no sign of mechanical failure; it looked like the even movement of a controlled intention. With a sudden flash of sunlight on its wings, the plane banked into a long curve, rays dripping like water from its body-then went into the broad, smooth circles of a spiral, as if circling for a landing where no landing was conceivable. She watched, not trying to explain it, not believing what she saw, waiting for the upward thrust that would throw him back on his course. But the easy, gliding circles went on dropping, toward a ground she could not see and dared not think of. . . Like remnants of broken jaws, strings of granite dentures stood between her ship and his; she could not tell what lay at the bottom of his spiral motion. She knew only that it did not look like, but was certain to be, the motion of a suicide. She saw the sunlight glitter on his wings for an instant. Then, like the body of a man diving chest-first and arms outstretched, serenely abandoned to the sweep of the fall, the plane went down and vanished behind the ridges of rock. She flew on, almost waiting for it to reappear, unable to believe that she had witnessed a horrible catastrophe taking place so simply and quietly. She flew on to where the plane had dropped. It seemed to be a valley in a ring of granite walls. She reached the valley and looked down. There was no possible place for a landing. There was no sign of a plane. The bottom of the valley looked like a stretch of the earth\u0027s crust mangled in the days when the earth was cooling, left irretrievable ever since. It was a stretch of rocks ground against one another, with boulders hanging in precarious formations, with long, dark crevices and a few contorted pine trees growing half-horizontally into the air. There was no level piece of soil the size of a handkerchief. There was no place for a plane to hide. There was no remnant of a plane\u0027s wreck. She banked sharply, circling above the valley, dropping down a little. By some trick of light, which she could not explain, the floor of the valley seemed more clearly visible than the rest of the earth. She could distinguish it well enough to, know that the plane was not there; yet this was not possible. She circled, dropping down farther. She glanced around her-and for one frightening moment, she thought that it was a quiet summer morning, that she was alone, lost in a region of the Rocky Mountains which no plane should ever venture to approach, and, with the last of her fuel burning away, she was looking for a plane that had never existed, in quest of a destroyer who had vanished as he always vanished; perhaps it was only his vision that had led her here to be destroyed. In the next moment, she shook her head, pressed her mouth tighter and dropped farther. She thought that she could not abandon an incalculable wealth such as the brain of Quentin Daniels on one of those rocks below, if he was still alive and within her reach to help. She had dropped inside the circle of the valley\u0027s walls. It was a dangerous job of flying, the space was much too tight, but she went on circling and dropping lower, her life hanging on her eyesight, and her eyesight flashing between two tasks: searching the floor of the valley and watching the granite walls that seemed about to rip her wings. She knew the danger only as part of the job. It had no personal meaning any longer. The savage thing she felt was almost enjoyment. It was the last rage of a lost battle. No!-she was crying in her mind, crying it to the destroyer, to the world she had left, to the years behind her, to the long progression of defeat-No! . . .No!. . . No! . . . Her eyes swept past the instrument panel-and then she sat still but for the sound of a gasp. Her altimeter had stood at 11,000 feet the last time she remembered seeing it. Now it stood at 10,000. But the floor of the valley had not changed. It had come no closer. It remained as distant as at her first glance down. She knew that the figure 8,000 meant the level of the ground in this part of Colorado. She had not noticed the length of her descent. She had not noticed that the ground, which had seemed too clear and too close from the height, was now too dim and too far. She was looking at the same rocks from the same perspective, they had grown no larger, their shadows had not moved, and the oddly unnatural light still hung over the bottom of the valley. She thought that her altimeter was off, and she went on circling downward. She saw the needle of her dial moving down;, she saw the walls of granite moving up, she saw the ring of mountains growing higher, its peaks coming closer together in the sky-but the floor of the valley remained unchanged, as if she were dropping down a well with a bottom never to be reached. The needle moved to 9,500-to 9,300-to 9,000-to 8,700. The flash of light that hit her had no source. It was as if the air within and beyond the plane became an explosion of blinding cold fire, sudden and soundless. The shock threw her back, her hands off the wheel and over her eyes. In the break of an instant, when she seized the wheel again, the light was gone, but her ship was spinning, her ears were bursting with silence and her propeller stood stiffly straight before her: her motor was dead. She tried to pull for a rise, but the ship was going down-and what she saw flying at her face was not the spread of mangled boulders, but the green grass of a field where no field had been before. There was no time to see the rest. There was no time to think of explanations. There was no time to come out of the spin. The earth was a green ceiling coming down upon her, a few hundred swiftly shrinking feet away. Flung from side to side, like a battered pendulum, clinging to the wheel, half in her seat, half on her knees, she fought to pull the ship into a glide, for an attempt to make a belly-landing, while the green ground was whirling about her, sweeping above her, then below, its spiral coils coming closer. Her arms pulling at the wheel, with no chance to know whether she could succeed, with her space and time running out-she felt, in a flash of its full, violent purity, that special sense of existence which had always been hers. In a moment\u0027s consecration to her love-to her rebellious denial of disaster, to her love of life and of the matchless value that was herself-she felt the fiercely proud certainty that she would survive. And in answer to the earth that flew to meet her, she heard in her mind, as her mockery at fate, as her cry of defiance, the words of the sentence she hated-the words of defeat, of despair and of a plea for help: \"Oh hell! Who is John Galt?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1551/46041.html","bookId":1296,"book":{"id":1296,"title":"Atlas Shrugged 阿特拉斯耸耸肩","description":"简介： 作为一部乌托邦小说，《阿特拉斯耸耸肩》描绘了一个由自私而精明的商人、科学家、艺术家等社会精英组成的世外桃源，有着田园诗般的诗意和现实社会中的欲望的满足。在这里，维系着一切的不是道德而是金钱，金钱被视作为崇拜的偶像，是自由交换和公平正义的象征，每个人都...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/05/14-26-07-23-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1551","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM"}}
