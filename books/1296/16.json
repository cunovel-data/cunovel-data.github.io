{"id":13769,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER VI MIRACLE METAL","content":"\"But can we get away with it?\" asked Wesley Mouch. His voice was high with anger and thin with fear. Nobody answered him. James Taggart sat on the edge of an armchair, not moving, looking up at him from under his forehead, Orren Boyle gave a vicious tap against an ashtray, shaking the ash off his cigar. Dr. Floyd Ferris smiled. Mr. Weatherby folded his lips and hands. Fred Kinnan, head of the Amalgamated Labor of America, stopped pacing the office, sat down on the window sill and crossed his arms. Eugene Lawson, who had sat hunched downward, absent-mindedly rearranging a display of flowers on a low glass table, raised his torso resentfully and glanced up. Mouch sat at his desk, with his fist on a sheet of paper. It was Eugene Lawson who answered. \"That\u0027s not, it seems to me, the way to put it. We must not let vulgar difficulties obstruct our feeling that it\u0027s a noble plan motivated solely by the public welfare. It\u0027s for the good of the people. The people need it. Need comes first, so we don\u0027t have to consider anything else.\" Nobody objected or picked it up; they looked as if Lawson had merely made it harder to continue the discussion. But a small man who sat unobtrusively in the best armchair of the room, apart from the others, content to be ignored and fully aware that none of them could be unconscious of his presence, glanced at Lawson, then at Mouch, and said with brisk cheerfulness, \"That\u0027s the line, Wesley. Tone it down and dress it up and get your press boys to chant it-and you won\u0027t have to worry.\" \"Yes, Mr. Thompson,\" said Mouch glumly. Mr. Thompson, the Head of the State, was a man who possessed the quality of never being noticed. In any group of three, his person became indistinguishable, and when seen alone it seemed to evoke a group of its own, composed of the countless persons he resembled. The country had no clear image of what he looked like: his photographs had appeared on the covers of magazines as frequently as those of his predecessors in office, but people could never be quite certain which photographs were his and which were pictures of \"a mail clerk\" or \"a white-collar worker,\" accompanying articles about the daily life of the undifferentiated-except that Mr. Thompson\u0027s collars were usually wilted. He had broad shoulders and a slight body. He had stringy hair, a wide mouth and an elastic age range that made him look like a harassed forty or an unusually vigorous sixty. Holding enormous official powers, he schemed ceaselessly to expand them, because it was expected of him by those who had pushed him into office. He had the cunning of the unintelligent and the frantic energy of the lazy. The sole secret of his rise in life was the fact that he was a product of chance and knew it and aspired to nothing else. \"It\u0027s obvious that measures have to be taken. Drastic measures,\" said James Taggart, speaking, not to Mr. Thompson, but to Wesley Mouch. \"We can\u0027t let things go the way they\u0027re going much longer.\" His voice was belligerent and shaky. \"Take it easy, Jim,\" said Orren Boyle. \"Something\u0027s got to be done and done fast!\" \"Don\u0027t look at me,\" snapped Wesley Mouch. \"I can\u0027t help it. I can\u0027t help it if people refuse to co-operate. I\u0027m tied. I need wider powers.\" Mouch had summoned them all to Washington, as his friends and personal advisers, for a private, unofficial conference on the national crisis. But, watching him, they were unable to decide whether his manner was overbearing or whining, whether he was threatening them or pleading for their help. \"Fact is,\" said Mr. Weatherby primly, in a statistical tone of voice, \"that in the twelve-month period ending on the first of this year, the rate of business failures has doubled, as compared with the preceding twelve-month period. Since the first of this year, it has trebled.\" \"Be sure they think it\u0027s their own fault,\" said Dr. Ferris casually. \"Huh?\" said Wesley Mouch, his eyes darting to Ferris. \"Whatever you do, don\u0027t apologize,\" said Dr, Ferris. \"Make them feel guilty.\" \"I\u0027m not apologizing!\" snapped Mouch. \"I\u0027m not to blame. I need wider powers.\" \"But it is their own fault,\" said Eugene Lawson, turning aggressively to Dr. Ferris. \"It\u0027s their lack of social spirit. They refuse to recognize that production is not a private choice, but a public duty. They have no right to fail, no matter what conditions happen to come up. They\u0027ve got to go on producing. It\u0027s a social imperative. A man\u0027s work is not a personal matter, it\u0027s a social matter. There\u0027s no such thing as a personal matter-or a personal life. That\u0027s what we\u0027ve got to force them to learn.\" \"Gene Lawson knows what I\u0027m talking about,\" said Dr. Ferris, with a slight smile, \"even though he hasn\u0027t the faintest idea that he does.\" \"What do you think you mean?\" asked Lawson, his voice rising. \"Skip it,\" ordered Wesley Mouch. \"I don\u0027t care what you decide to do, Wesley,\" said Mr. Thompson, \"and I don\u0027t care if the businessmen squawk about it. Just be sure you\u0027ve got the press with you. Be damn sure about that.\" \"I\u0027ve got \u0027em,\" said Mouch. \"One editor who\u0027d open his trap at the wrong time could do us more harm than ten disgruntled millionaires.\" \"That\u0027s true, Mr. Thompson,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"But can you name one editor who knows it?\" \"Guess not,\" said Mr. Thompson; he sounded pleased. \"Whatever type of men we\u0027re counting on and planning for,\" said Dr. Ferris, \"there\u0027s a certain old-fashioned quotation which we may safely forget: the one about counting on the wise and the honest. We don\u0027t have to consider them. They\u0027re out of date.\" James Taggart glanced at the window. There were patches of blue in the sky above the spacious streets of Washington, the faint blue of mid-April, and a few beams breaking through the clouds, A monument stood shining in the distance, hit by a ray of sun: it was a tall, white obelisk, erected to the memory of the man Dr. Ferris was quoting, the man in whose honor this city had been named. James Taggart looked away. \"I don\u0027t like the professor\u0027s remarks,\" said Lawson loudly and sullenly. \"Keep still,\" said Wesley Mouch. \"Dr. Ferris is not talking theory, but practice.\" \"Well, if you want to talk practice,\" said Fred Kinnan, \"then let me tell you that we can\u0027t worry about businessmen at a time like this. What we\u0027ve got to think about is jobs. More jobs for the people. In my unions, every man who\u0027s working is feeding five who aren\u0027t, not counting his own pack of starving relatives. If you want my advice-oh, I know you won\u0027t go for it, but it\u0027s just a thought-issue a directive making it compulsory to add, say, one-third more men to every payroll in the country.\" \"Good God!\" yelled Taggart. \"Are you crazy? We can barely meet our payrolls as it is! There\u0027s not enough work for the men we\u0027ve got now! One-third more? We wouldn\u0027t have any use for them whatever!\" \"Who cares whether you\u0027d have any use for them?\" said Fred Kinnan. \"They need jobs. That\u0027s what comes first-need-doesn\u0027t it?-not your profits.\" \"It\u0027s not a question of profits!\" yelled Taggart hastily. \"I haven\u0027t said anything about profits. I haven\u0027t given you any grounds to insult me. It\u0027s just a question of where in hell we\u0027d get the money to pay your men-when half our trains are running empty and there\u0027s not enough freight to fill a trolley car.\" His voice slowed down suddenly to a tone of cautious thoughtfulness: \"However, we do understand the plight of the working men, and-it\u0027s just a thought -we could, perhaps, take on a certain extra number, if we were permitted to double our freight rates, which-\" \"Have you lost your mind?\" yelled Orren Boyle. \"I\u0027m going broke on the rates you\u0027re charging now, I shudder every time a damn boxcar pulls in or out of the mills, they\u0027re bleeding me to death, I can\u0027t afford it-and you want to double it?\" \"It is not essential whether you can afford it or not,\" said Taggart coldly, \"You have to be prepared to make some sacrifices. The public needs railroads. Need comes first-above your profits.\" \"What profits?\" yelled Orren Boyle. \"When did I ever make any profits? Nobody can accuse me of running a profit-making business! Just look at my balance sheet-and then look at the books of a certain competitor of mine, who\u0027s got all the customers, all the raw materials, all the technical advantages and a monopoly on secret formulas-then tell me who\u0027s the profiteer! . . . But, of course, the public does need railroads, and perhaps I could manage to absorb a certain raise in rates, if I were to get-it\u0027s just a thought-if I were to get a subsidy to carry me over the next year or two, until I catch my stride and-\" \"What? Again?\" yelled Mr. Weatherby, losing his primness. \"How many loans have you got from us and how many extensions, suspensions and moratoriums? You haven\u0027t repaid a penny-and with all of you boys going broke and the tax receipts crashing, where do you expect us to get the money to hand you a subsidy?\" \"There are people who aren\u0027t broke,\" said Boyle slowly. \"You boys have no excuse for permitting all that need and misery to spread through the country-so long as there are people who aren\u0027t broke.\" \"I can\u0027t help it!\" yelled Wesley Mouch. \"I can\u0027t do anything about it! I need wider powers!\" They could not tell what had prompted Mr. Thompson to attend this particular conference. He had said little, but had listened with interest. It seemed as if there were something which he had wanted to learn, and now he looked as if he had learned it. He stood up and smiled cheerfully. \"Go ahead, Wesley,\" he said. \"Go ahead with Number 10-289. You won\u0027t have any trouble at all.\" They had all risen to their feet, in gloomily reluctant deference. Wesley Mouch glanced down at his sheet of paper, then said in a petulant tone of voice, \"If you want me to go ahead, you\u0027ll have to declare a state of total emergency.\" \"I\u0027ll declare it any time you\u0027re ready.\" \"There are certain difficulties, which-\" \"I\u0027ll leave it up to you. Work it out any way you wish. It\u0027s your job. Let me see the rough draft, tomorrow or next day, but don\u0027t bother me about the details. I\u0027ve got a speech to make on the radio in half an hour.\" \"The chief difficulty is that I\u0027m not sure whether the law actually grants us the power to put into effect certain provisions of Directive Number 10-289.1 fear they might be open to challenge.\" \"Oh hell, we\u0027ve passed so many emergency laws that if you hunt through them, you\u0027re sure to dig up something that will cover it.\" Mr. Thompson turned to the others with a smile of good fellowship. \"I\u0027ll leave you boys to iron out the wrinkles,\" he said. \"I appreciate your coming to Washington to help us out. Glad to have seen you.\" They waited until the door closed after him, then resumed their seats; they did not look at one another. They had not heard the text of Directive No. 10-289, but they knew what it would contain. They had known it for a long time, in that special manner which consisted of keeping secrets from oneself and leaving knowledge untranslated into words. And, by the same method, they now wished it were possible for them not to hear the words of the directive. It was to avoid moments such as this that all the complex twistings of their minds had been devised, They wished the directive to go into effect. They wished it could be put into effect without words, so that they would not have to know that what they were doing was what it was. Nobody had ever announced that Directive No. 10-289 was the final goal of his efforts. Yet, for generations past, men had worked to make it possible, and for months past, every provision of it had been prepared for by countless speeches, articles, sermons, editorials-by purposeful voices that screamed with anger if anyone named their purpose. \u0027The picture now is this,\" said Wesley Mouch. \"The economic condition of the country was better the year before last than it was last year, and last year it was better than it is at present. It\u0027s obvious that we would not be able to survive another year of the same progression. Therefore, our sole objective must now be to hold the line. To stand still in order to catch our stride. To achieve total stability. Freedom has been given a chance and has failed. Therefore, more stringent controls are necessary. Since men are unable and unwilling to solve their problems voluntarily, they must be forced to do it.\" He paused, picked up the sheet of paper, then added in a less formal tone of voice, \"Hell, what it comes down to is that we can manage to exist as and where we are, but we can\u0027t afford to move! So we\u0027ve got to stand still. We\u0027ve got to stand still. We\u0027ve got to make those bastards stand still!\" His head drawn into his shoulders, he was looking at them with the anger of a man declaring that the country\u0027s troubles were a personal affront to him. So many men seeking favors had been afraid of him that he now acted as if his anger were a solution to everything, as if his anger were omnipotent, as if all he had to do was to get angry. Yet, facing him, the men who sat in a silent semicircle before his desk were uncertain whether the presence of fear in the room was their own emotion or whether the hunched figure behind the desk generated the panic of a cornered rat. Wesley Mouch had a long, square face and a flat-topped skull, made more so by a brush haircut. His lower lip was a petulant bulb and the pale, brownish pupils of his eyes looked like the yolks of eggs smeared under the not fully translucent whites. His facial muscles moved abruptly, and the movement vanished, having conveyed no expression. No one had ever seen him smile. Wesley Mouch came from a family that had known neither poverty nor wealth nor distinction for many generations; it had clung, however, to a tradition of its own: that of being college-bred and, therefore, of despising men who were in business. The family\u0027s diplomas had always hung on the wall in the manner of a reproach to the world, because the diplomas had not automatically produced the material equivalents of their attested spiritual value. Among the family\u0027s numerous relatives, there was one rich uncle. He had married his money and, in his widowed old age, he had picked Wesley as his favorite from among his many nephews and nieces, because Wesley was the least distinguished of the lot and therefore, thought Uncle Julius, the safest. Uncle Julius did not care for people who were brilliant. He did not care for the trouble of managing his money, either; so he turned the job over to Wesley. By the time Wesley graduated from college, there was no money left to manage. Uncle Julius blamed it on Wesley\u0027s cunning and cried that Wesley was an unscrupulous schemer. But there had been no scheme about it; Wesley could not have said just where the money had gone. In high school, Wesley Mouch had been one of the worst students and had passionately envied those who were the best. College taught him that he did not have to envy them at all. After graduation, he took a job in the advertising department of a company that manufactured a bogus corn-cure. The cure sold well and he rose to be the head of his department. He left it to take charge of the advertising of a hair-restorer, then of a patented brassiere, then of a new soap, then of a soft drink-and then he became advertising vice-president of an automobile concern. He tried to sell automobiles as if they were a bogus corn-cure. They did not sell. He blamed it on the insufficiency of his advertising budget. It was the president of the automobile concern who recommended him to Rearden. It was Rearden who introduced him to Washington-Rearden, who knew no standard by which to judge the activities of his Washington man. It was James Taggart who gave him a start in the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources-in exchange for double crossing Rearden in order to help Orren Boyle in exchange for destroying Dan Conway. From then on, people helped Wesley Mouch to advance, for the same reason as that which had prompted Uncle Julius: they were people who believed that mediocrity was safe. The men who now sat in front of his desk had been taught that the law of causality was a superstition and that one had to deal with the situation of the moment without considering its cause. By the situation of the moment, they had concluded that Wesley Mouch was a man of superlative skill and cunning, since millions aspired to power, but he was the one who had achieved it. It was not within their method of thinking to know that Wesley Mouch was the zero at the meeting point of forces unleashed in destruction against one another. \"This is just a rough draft of Directive Number 10-289,\" said Wesley Mouch, \"which Gene, Clem and I have dashed off just to give you the general idea. We want to hear your opinions, suggestions and so forth-you being the representatives of labor, industry, transportation and the professions.\" Fred Kinnan got off the window sill and sat down on the arm of a chair. Orren Boyle spit out the butt of his cigar. James Taggart looked down at his own hands. Dr. Ferris was the only one who seemed to be at ease. \"In the name of the general welfare,\" read Wesley Mouch, \"to protect the people\u0027s security, to achieve full equality and total stability, it is decreed for the duration of the national emergency that- \"Point One. All workers, wage earners and employees of any kind whatsoever shall henceforth be attached to their jobs and shall not leave nor be dismissed nor change employment, under penalty of a term in jail. The penalty shall be determined by the Unification Board, such Board to be appointed by the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. All persons reaching the age of twenty-one shall report to the Unification Board, which shall assign them to where, in its opinion, their services will best serve the interests of the nation. \"Point Two. All industrial, commercial, manufacturing and business establishments of any nature whatsoever shall henceforth remain in operation, and the owners of such establishments shall not quit nor leave nor retire, nor close, sell or transfer their business, under penalty of the nationalization of their establishment and of any and all of their property. \"Point Three. All patents and copyrights, pertaining to any devices, inventions, formulas, processes and works of any nature whatsoever, shall be turned over to the nation as a patriotic emergency gift by means of Gift Certificates to be signed voluntarily by the owners of all such patents and copyrights. The Unification Board shall then license the use of such patents and copyrights to all applicants, equally and without discrimination, for the purpose of eliminating monopolistic practices, discarding obsolete products and making the best available to the whole nation. No trademarks, brand names or copyrighted titles shall be used. Every formerly patented product shall be known by a new name and sold by all manufacturers under the same name, such name to be selected by the Unification Board. All private trademarks and brand names are hereby abolished. \"Point Four. No new devices, inventions, products, or goods of any nature whatsoever, not now on the market, shall be produced, invented, manufactured or sold after the date of this directive. The Office of Patents and Copyrights is hereby suspended. \"Point Five. Every establishment, concern, corporation or person engaged in production of any nature whatsoever shall henceforth produce the same amount of goods per year as it, they or he produced during the Basic Year, no more and no less. The year to be known as the Basic or Yardstick Year is to be the year ending on the date of this directive. Over or under production shall be fined, such fines to be determined by the Unification Board. \"Point Six. Every person of any age, sex, class or income, shall henceforth spend the same amount of money on the purchase of goods per year as he or she spent during the Basic Year, no more and no less. Over or under purchasing shall be fined, such fines to be determined by the Unification Board. \"Point Seven. All wages, prices, salaries, dividends, profits, interest rates and forms of income of any nature whatsoever, shall be frozen at their present figures, as of the date of this directive. \"Point Eight. All cases arising from and rules not specifically provided for in this directive, shall be settled and determined by the Unification Board, whose decisions will be final.\" There was, even within the four men who had listened, a remnant of human dignity, which made them sit still and feel sick for the length of one minute. James Taggart spoke first. His voice was low, but it had the trembling intensity of an involuntary scream: \"Well, why not? Why should they have it, if we don\u0027t? Why should they stand above us? If we are to perish, let\u0027s make sure that we all perish together. Let\u0027s make sure that we leave them no chance to survive!\" \"That\u0027s a damn funny thing to say about a very practical plan that will benefit everybody,\" said Orren Boyle shrilly, looking at Taggart in frightened astonishment. Dr. Ferris chuckled. Taggart\u0027s eyes seemed to focus, and he said, his voice louder, \"Yes, of course. It\u0027s a very practical plan. It\u0027s necessary, practical and just. It will solve everybody\u0027s problems. It will give everybody a chance to feel safe. A chance to rest.\" \"It will give security to the people,\" said Eugene Lawson, his mouth slithering into a smile. \"Security-that\u0027s what the people want. If they want it, why shouldn\u0027t they have it? Just because a handful of rich will object?\" \"It\u0027s not the rich who\u0027ll object,\" said Dr. Ferris lazily. \"The rich drool for security more than any other sort of animal-haven\u0027t you discovered that yet?\" \"Well, who\u0027ll object?\" snapped Lawson. Dr. Ferris smiled pointedly, and did not answer. Lawson looked away. \"To hell with them! Why should we worry about them? We\u0027ve got to run the world for the sake of the little people. It\u0027s intelligence that\u0027s caused all the troubles of humanity. Man\u0027s mind is the root of all evil. This is the day of the heart. It\u0027s the weak, the meek, the sick and the humble that must be the only objects of our concern,\" His lower lip was twisting in soft, lecherous motions. \"Those who\u0027re big are here to serve those who aren\u0027t. If they refuse to do their moral duty, we\u0027ve got to force them. There once was an Age of Reason, but we\u0027ve progressed beyond it. This is the Age of Love.\" \"Shut up!\" screamed James Taggart. They all stared at him. \"For Christ\u0027s sake, Jim, what\u0027s the matter?\" said Orren Boyle, shaking. \"Nothing,\" said Taggart, \"nothing . . . Wesley, keep him still, will you?\" Mouch said uncomfortably, \"But I fail to see-\" \"Just keep him still. We don\u0027t have to listen to him, do we?\" \"Why, no, but-\" \"Then let\u0027s go on.\" \"What is this?\" demanded Lawson, \"I resent it. I most emphatically-\" But he saw no support in the faces around him and stopped, his mouth sagging into an expression of pouting hatred. \"Let\u0027s go on,\" said Taggart feverishly. \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" asked Orren Boyle, trying not to know what was the matter with himself and why he felt frightened. \"Genius is a superstition, Jim,\" said Dr. Ferris slowly, with an odd kind of emphasis, as if knowing that he was naming the unnamed in all their minds. \"There\u0027s no such thing as the intellect. A man\u0027s brain is a social product. A sum of influences that he\u0027s picked up from those around him. Nobody invents anything, he merely reflects what\u0027s floating in the social atmosphere. A genius is an intellectual scavenger and a greedy hoarder of the ideas which rightfully belong to society, from which he stole them. All thought is theft. If we do away with private fortunes, we\u0027ll have a fairer distribution of wealth. If we do away with the genius, we\u0027ll have a fairer distribution of ideas.\" \"Are we here to talk business or are we here to kid one another?\" asked Fred Kinnan. They turned to him. He was a muscular man with large features, but his face had the astonishing property of finely drawn lines that raised the corners of his mouth into the permanent hint of a wise, sardonic grin. He sat on the arm of the chair, hands in pockets, looking at Mouch with the smiling glance of a hardened policeman at a shoplifter. \"All I\u0027ve got to say is that you\u0027d better staff that Unification Board with my men,\" he said. \"Better make sure of it, brother-or I\u0027ll blast your Point One to hell.\" \"I intend, of course, to have a representative of labor on that Board,\" said Mouch dryly, \"as well as a representative of industry, of the professions and of every cross-section of-\" \"No cross-sections,\" said Fred Kinnan evenly. \"Just representatives of labor. Period.\" \"What the hell!\" yelled Orren Boyle. \"That\u0027s stacking the cards, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Sure,\" said Fred Kinnan. \"But that will give you a stranglehold on every business in the country!\" \"What do you think I\u0027m after?\" \"That\u0027s unfair!\" yelled Boyle. \"I won\u0027t stand for it! You have no right! You-\" \"Right?\" said Kinnan innocently. \"Are we talking about rights?\" \"But, I mean, after all, there are certain fundamental property rights which-\" \"Listen, pal, you want Point Three, don\u0027t you?\" \"Well, I-\" \"Then you\u0027d better keep your trap shut about property rights from now on. Keep it shut tight.\" \"Mr. Kinnan,\" said Dr. Ferris, \"you must not make the old fashioned mistake of drawing wide generalizations. Our policy has to be flexible. There are no absolute principles which-\" \"Save it for Jim Taggart, Doc,\" said Fred Kinnan. \"I know what I\u0027m talking about. That\u0027s because I never went to college.\" \"I object,\" said Boyle, \"to your dictatorial method of-\" Kinnan turned his back on him and said, \"Listen, Wesley, my boys won\u0027t like Point One. If I get to run things, I\u0027ll make them swallow it. If not, not. Just make up your mind.\" \"Well-\" said Mouch, and stopped. \"For Christ\u0027s sake, Wesley, what about us?\" yelled Taggart. \"You\u0027ll come to me,\" said Kinnan, \"when you\u0027ll need a deal to fix the Board. But I\u0027ll run that Board. Me and Wesley.\" \"Do you think the country will stand for it?\" yelled Taggart. \"Stop kidding yourself,\" said Kinnan. \"The country? If there aren\u0027t any principles any more-and I guess the doc is right, because there sure aren\u0027t-if there aren\u0027t any rules to this game and it\u0027s only a question of who robs whom-then I\u0027ve got more votes than the bunch of you, there are more workers than employers, and don\u0027t you forget it, boys!\" \"That\u0027s a funny attitude to take,\" said Taggart haughtily, \"about a measure which, after all, is not designed for the selfish benefit of workers or employers, but for the general welfare of the public.\" \"Okay,\" said Kinnan amiably, \"let\u0027s talk your lingo. Who is the public? If you go by quality-then it ain\u0027t you, Jim, and it ain\u0027t Orrie Boyle. If you go by quantity-then it sure is me, because quantity is what I\u0027ve got behind me.\" His smile disappeared, and with a sudden, bitter look of weariness he added, \"Only I\u0027m not going to say that I\u0027m working for the welfare of my public, because I know I\u0027m not. I know that I\u0027m delivering the poor bastards into slavery, and that\u0027s all there is to it. And they know it, too. But they know that I\u0027ll have to throw them a crumb once in a while, if I want to keep my racket, while with the rest of you they wouldn\u0027t have a chance in hell. So that\u0027s why, if they\u0027ve got to be under a whip, they\u0027d rather I held it, not you-you drooling, tear-jerking, mealy-mouthed bastards of the public welfare! Do you think that outside of your college-bred pansies there\u0027s one village idiot whom you\u0027re fooling? I\u0027m a racketeer-but I know it and my boys know it, and they know that I\u0027ll pay off. Not out of the kindness of my heart, either, and not a cent more than I can get away with, but at least they can count on that much. Sure, it makes me sick sometimes, it makes me sick right now, but it\u0027s not me who\u0027s built this kind of world-you did-so I\u0027m playing the game as you\u0027ve set it up and I\u0027m going to play it for as long as it lasts-which isn\u0027t going to be long for any of us!\" He stood up. No one answered him. He let his eyes move slowly from face to face and stop on Wesley Mouch. \"Do I get the Board, Wesley?\" he asked casually. \"The selection of the specific personnel is only a technical detail,\" said Mouch pleasantly. \"Suppose we discuss it later, you and I?\" Everybody in the room knew that this meant the answer Yes. \"Okay, pal,\" said Kinnan. He went back to the window, sat down on the sill and lighted a cigarette. For some unadmitted reason, the others were looking at Dr. Ferris, as if seeking guidance. \"Don\u0027t be disturbed by oratory,\" said Dr. Ferris smoothly. \"Mr. Kinnan is a fine speaker, but he has no sense of practical reality. He is unable to think dialectically.\" There was another silence, then James Taggart spoke up suddenly. \"I don\u0027t care. It doesn\u0027t matter. He\u0027ll have to hold things still. Everything will have to remain as it is. Just as it is. Nobody will be permitted to change anything. Except-\" He turned sharply to Wesley Mouch. \"Wesley, under Point Four, we\u0027ll have to close all research departments, experimental laboratories, scientific foundations and all the rest of the institutions of that kind. They\u0027ll have to be forbidden.\" \"Yes, that\u0027s right,\" said Mouch. \"I hadn\u0027t thought of that. We\u0027ll have to stick in a couple of lines about that.\" He hunted around for a pencil and made a few scrawls on the margin of his paper. \"It will end wasteful competition,\" said James Taggart. \"We\u0027ll stop scrambling to beat one another to the untried and the unknown. We won\u0027t have to worry about new inventions upsetting the market. We won\u0027t have to pour money down the drain in useless experiments just to keep up with over ambitious competitors.\" \"Yes,\" said Orren Boyle. \"Nobody should be allowed to waste money on the new until everybody has plenty of the old. Close all those damn research laboratories-and the sooner, the better.\" \"Yes,\" said Wesley Mouch. \"We\u0027ll close them. All of them.\" \"The State Science Institute, too?\" asked Fred Kinnan. \"Oh, no!\" said Mouch. \"That\u0027s different. That\u0027s government. Besides, it\u0027s a non-profit institution. And it will be sufficient to take care of all scientific progress.\" \"Quite sufficient,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"And what will become of all the engineers, professors and such, when you close all those laboratories?\" asked Fred Kinnan. \"What are they going to do for a living, with all the other jobs and businesses frozen?\" \"Oh,\" said Wesley Mouch. He scratched his head. He turned to Mr. Weatherby. \"Do we put them on relief, Clem?\" \"No,\" said Mr. Weatherby. \"What for? There\u0027s not enough of them to raise a squawk. Not enough to matter.\" \"I suppose,\" said Mouch, turning to Dr. Ferris, \"that you\u0027ll be able to absorb some of them, Floyd?\" \"Some,\" said Dr. Ferris slowly, as if relishing every syllable of his answer. \"Those who prove co-operative.\" \"What about the rest?\" asked Fred Kinnan. \"They\u0027ll have to wait till the Unification Board finds some use for them,\" said Wesley Mouch. \"What will they eat while they\u0027re waiting?\" Mouch shrugged. \"There\u0027s got to be some victims in times of national emergency. It can\u0027t be helped.\" \"We have the right to do it!\" cried Taggart suddenly, in defiance to the stillness of the room. \"We need it. We need it, don\u0027t we?\" There was no answer. \"We have the right to protect our livelihood!\" Nobody opposed him, but he went on with a shrill, pleading insistence. \"We\u0027ll be safe for the first time in centuries. Everybody will know his place and job, and everybody else\u0027s place and job-and we won\u0027t be at the mercy of every stray crank with a new idea. Nobody will push us out of business or steal our markets or undersell us or make us obsolete. Nobody will come to us offering some damn new gadget and putting us on the spot to decide whether we\u0027ll lose our shirt if we buy it, or whether we\u0027ll lose our shirt if we don\u0027t but somebody else does! We won\u0027t have to decide. Nobody will be permitted to decide anything. It will be decided once and for all.\" His glance moved pleadingly from face to face. \"There\u0027s been enough invented already-enough for everybody\u0027s comfort-why should they be allowed to go on inventing? Why should we permit them to blast the ground from under our feet every few steps? Why should we be kept on the go in eternal uncertainty? Just because of a few restless, ambitious adventurers? Should we sacrifice the contentment of the whole of mankind to the greed of a few non-conformists? We don\u0027t need them. We don\u0027t need them at all. “I wish we\u0027d get rid of that hero worship! Heroes? They\u0027ve done nothing but harm, all through history. They\u0027ve kept mankind running a wild race, with no breathing spell, no rest, no ease, no security. Running to catch up with them . . . always, without end . . . Just as -we catch up, they\u0027re years ahead. . . . They leave us no chance . . . They\u0027ve never left us a chance. . . .\" His eyes were moving restlessly; he glanced at the window, but looked hastily away: he did not want to see the white obelisk in the distance. \"We\u0027re through with them. We\u0027ve won. This is our age. Our world. We\u0027re going to have security-for the first time in centuries-for the first time since the beginning of the industrial revolution!\" \"Well, this, I guess,\" said Fred Kinnan, \"is the anti-industrial revolution.\" \"That\u0027s a damn funny thing for you to say!\" snapped Wesley Mouch. \"We can\u0027t be permitted to say that to the public.\" \"Don\u0027t worry, brother. I won\u0027t say it to the public.\" \"It\u0027s a total fallacy,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"It\u0027s a statement prompted by ignorance. Every expert has conceded long ago that a planned economy achieves the maximum of productive efficiency and that centralization leads to super-industrialization.\" \"Centralization destroys the blight of monopoly,\" said Boyle. \"How\u0027s that again?\" drawled Kinnan. Boyle did not catch the tone of mockery, and answered earnestly, \"It destroys the blight of monopoly. It leads to the democratization of industry. It makes everything available to everybody. Now, for instance, at a time like this, when there\u0027s such a desperate shortage of iron ore, is there any sense in my wasting money, labor and national resources on making old-fashioned steel, when there exists a much better metal that I could be making? A metal that everybody wants, but nobody can get. Now is that good economics or sound social efficiency or democratic justice? Why shouldn\u0027t I be allowed to manufacture that metal and why shouldn\u0027t the people get it when they need it? Just because of the private monopoly of one selfish individual? Should we sacrifice our rights to his personal interests?\" \"Skip it, brother,\" said Fred Kinnan. \"I\u0027ve read it all in the same newspapers you did.\" \"I don\u0027t like your attitude,\" said Boyle, in a sudden tone of righteousness, with a look which, in a barroom, would have signified a prelude to a fist fight. He sat up straight, buttressed by the columns of paragraphs on yellow-tinged paper, which he was seeing in his mind: \"At a time of crucial public need, are we to waste social effort on the manufacture of obsolete products? Are we to let the many remain in want while the few withhold from us the better products and methods available? Are we to be stopped by the superstition of patent rights? \"Is it not obvious that private industry is unable to cope with the present economic crisis? How long, for instance, are we going to put up with the disgraceful shortage of Rearden Metal? There is a crying public demand for it, which Rearden has failed to supply. When are we going to put an end to economic injustice and special privileges? Why should Rearden be the only one permitted to manufacture Rearden Metal?\" \"I don\u0027t like your attitude,\" said Orren Boyle. \"So long as we respect the rights of the workers, we\u0027ll want you to respect the rights of the industrialists.\" \"Which rights of which industrialists?\" drawled Kinnan. \"I\u0027m inclined to think,\" said Dr. Ferris hastily, \"that Point Two, perhaps, is the most essential one of all at present. We must put an end to that peculiar business of industrialists retiring and vanishing. We must stop them. It\u0027s playing havoc with our entire economy.\" \"Why are they doing it?\" asked Taggart nervously. \"Where are they all going?\" \"Nobody knows,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"We\u0027ve been unable to find any information or explanation. But it must be stopped. In times of crisis, economic service to the nation is just as much of a duty as military service. Anyone who abandons it should be regarded as a deserter. I have recommended that we introduce the death penalty for those men, but Wesley wouldn\u0027t agree to it.\" \"Take it easy, boy,\" said Fred Kinnan in an odd, slow voice. He sat suddenly and perfectly still, his arms crossed, looking at Ferris in a manner that made it suddenly real to the room that Ferris had proposed murder. \"Don\u0027t let me hear you talk about any death penalties in industry.\" Dr. Ferris shrugged. \"We don\u0027t have to go to extremes,\" said Mouch hastily. \"We don\u0027t want to frighten people. We want to have them on our side. Our top problem is, will they . . . will they accept it at all?\" \"They will,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"I\u0027m a little worried,\" said Eugene Lawson, \"about Points Three and Four. Taking over the patents is fine. Nobody\u0027s going to defend industrialists. But I\u0027m worried about taking over the copyrights. That\u0027s going to antagonize the intellectuals. It\u0027s dangerous. It\u0027s a spiritual issue. Doesn\u0027t Point Four mean that no new books are to be written or published from now on?\" \"Yes,\" said Mouch, \"it does. But we can\u0027t make an exception for the book-publishing business. It\u0027s an industry like any other. When we say \u0027no new products,\u0027 it\u0027s got to mean \u0027no new products.\u0027 \" \"But this is a matter of the spirit,\" said Lawson; his voice had a tone, not of rational respect, but of superstitious awe. \"We\u0027re not interfering with anybody\u0027s spirit. But when you print a book on paper, it becomes a material commodity-and if we grant an exception to one commodity, we won\u0027t be able to hold the others in line and we won\u0027t be able to make anything stick.\" \"Yes, that\u0027s true. But-\" \"Don\u0027t be a chump, Gene,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"You don\u0027t want some recalcitrant hacks to come out with treatises that will wreck our entire program, do you? If you breathe the word \u0027censorship\u0027 now, they\u0027ll all scream bloody murder. They\u0027re not ready for it-as yet. But if you leave the spirit alone and make it a simple material issue-not a matter of ideas, but just a matter of paper, ink and printing presses- you accomplish your purpose much more smoothly. You\u0027ll make sure that nothing dangerous gets printed or heard-and nobody is going to fight over a material issue.\" \"Yes, but . . . but I don\u0027t think the writers will like it.\" \"Are you sure?\" asked Wesley Mouch, with a glance that was almost a smile, \"Don\u0027t forget that under Point Five, the publishers will have to publish as many books as they did in the Basic Year. Since there will be no new ones, they will have to reprint-and the public will have to buy-some of the old ones. There are many very worthy books that have never had a fair chance.\" \"Oh,\" said Lawson; he remembered that he had seen Mouch lunching with Balph Eubank two weeks ago. Then he shook his head and frowned. \"Still, I\u0027m worried. The intellectuals are our friends. We don\u0027t want to lose them. They can make an awful lot of trouble.\" \"They won\u0027t,\" said Fred Kinnan. \"Your kind of intellectuals are the first to scream when it\u0027s safe-and the first to shut their traps at the first sign of danger. They spend years spitting at the man who feeds them-and they lick the hand of the man who slaps their drooling faces. Didn\u0027t they deliver every country of Europe, one after another, to committees of goons, just like this one here? Didn\u0027t they scream their heads off to shut out every burglar alarm and to break every padlock open for the goons? Have you heard a peep out of them since? Didn\u0027t they scream that they were the friends of labor? Do you hear them raising their voices about the chain gangs, the slave camps, the fourteen-hour workday and the mortality from scurvy in the People\u0027s States of Europe? No, but you do hear them telling the whip-beaten wretches that starvation is prosperity, that slavery is freedom, that torture chambers arc brother-love and that if the wretches don\u0027t understand it, then it\u0027s their own fault that they suffer, and it\u0027s the mangled corpses in the jail cellars who\u0027re to blame for all their troubles, not the benevolent leaders! Intellectuals? You might have to worry about any other breed of men, but not about the modern intellectuals: they\u0027ll swallow anything. I don\u0027t feel so safe about the lousiest wharf rat in the longshoremen\u0027s union: he\u0027s liable to remember suddenly that he is a man-and then I won\u0027t be able to keep him in line. But the intellectuals? That\u0027s the one thing they\u0027ve forgotten long ago. I guess it\u0027s the one thing that all their education was aimed to make them forget. Do anything you please to the intellectuals. They\u0027ll take it.\" \"For once,\" said Dr. Ferns, \"I agree with Mr. Kinnan. I agree with his facts, if not with his feelings. You don\u0027t have to worry about the intellectuals, Wesley. Just put a-few of them on the government payroll and send them out to preach precisely the sort of thing Mr. Kinnan mentioned: that the blame rests on the victims. Give them moderately comfortable salaries and extremely loud titles-and they\u0027ll forget their copyrights and do a better job for you than whole squads of enforcement officers.\" \"Yes,\" said Mouch. \"I know.\" \"The danger that I\u0027m worried about will come from a different quarter,\" said Dr. Ferris thoughtfully. \"You might run into quite a bit of trouble on that \u0027voluntary Gift Certificate1 business, Wesley.\" \"I know,\" said Mouch glumly. \"That\u0027s the point I wanted Thompson to help us out on. But I guess he can\u0027t. We don\u0027t actually have the legal power to seize the patents. Oh, there\u0027s plenty of clauses in dozens of laws that can be stretched to cover it-almost, but not quite. Any tycoon who\u0027d want to make a test case would have a very good chance to beat us. And we have to preserve a semblance of legality-or the populace won\u0027t take it.\" \"Precisely,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"It\u0027s extremely important to get those patents turned over to us voluntarily. Even if we had a law permitting outright nationalization, it would be much better to get them as a gift, We want to leave to people the illusion that they\u0027re still preserving their private property rights. And most of them will play along. They\u0027ll sign the Gift Certificates. Just raise a lot of noise about its being a patriotic duty and that anyone who refuses is a prince of greed, and they\u0027ll sign. But-\" He stopped. \"I know,\" said Mouch; he was growing visibly more nervous. \"There will be, I think, a few old-fashioned bastards here and there who\u0027ll refuse to sign-but they won\u0027t be prominent enough to make a noise, nobody will hear about it, their own communities and friends will turn against them for their being selfish, so it won\u0027t give us any trouble. We\u0027ll just take the patents over, anyway-and those guys won\u0027t have the nerve or the money to start a test case. But-\" He stopped. James Taggart leaned back in his chair, watching them; he was beginning to enjoy the conversation. \"Yes,\" said Dr. Ferris, \"I\u0027m thinking of it, too. I\u0027m thinking of a certain tycoon who is in a position to blast us to pieces. Whether we\u0027ll recover the pieces or not, is hard to tell. God knows what is liable to happen at a hysterical time like the present and in a situation as delicate as this. Anything can throw everything off balance. Blow up the whole works. And if there\u0027s anyone who wants to do it, he does. He does and can. He knows the real issue, he knows the things which must not be said-and he is not afraid to say them. He knows the one dangerous, fatally dangerous weapon. He is our deadliest adversary.\" \"Who?\" asked Lawson. Dr. Ferris hesitated, shrugged and answered, \"The guiltless man.\" Lawson stared blankly. \"What do you mean and whom are you talking about?\" James Taggart smiled. \"I mean that there is no way to disarm any man,\" said Dr. Ferris, \"except through guilt. Through that which he himself has accepted as guilt. If a man has ever stolen a dime, you can impose on him the punishment intended for a bank robber and he will take it. He\u0027ll bear any form of misery, he\u0027ll feel that he deserves no better. If there\u0027s not enough guilt in the world, we must create it. If we teach a man that it\u0027s evil to look at spring flowers and he believes us and then does it -we\u0027ll be able to do whatever we please with him. He won\u0027t defend himself. He won\u0027t feel he\u0027s worth it. He won\u0027t fight. But save us from the man who lives up to his own- standards. Save us from the man of clean conscience. He\u0027s the man who\u0027ll beat us.\" \"Are you talking about Henry Rearden?\" asked Taggart, his voice peculiarly clear. The one name they had not wanted to pronounce struck them into an instant\u0027s silence. \"What if I were?\" asked Dr. Ferris cautiously. \"Oh, nothing,\" said Taggart. \"Only, if you were, I would tell you that I can deliver Henry Rearden. He\u0027ll sign.\" By the rules of their unspoken language, they all knew-from the tone of his voice-that he was not bluffing. \"God, Jim! No!\" gasped Wesley Mouch. \"Yes,\" said Taggart. \"I was stunned, too, when I learned-what I learned. I didn\u0027t expect that. Anything but that.\" \"I am glad to hear it,\" said Mouch cautiously. \"It\u0027s a constructive piece of information. It might be very valuable indeed.\" \"Valuable-yes,\" said Taggart pleasantly. \"When do you plan to put the directive into effect?\" \"Oh, we have to move fast. We don\u0027t want any news of it to leak out. I expect you all to keep this most strictly confidential. I\u0027d say that we\u0027ll be ready to spring it on them in a couple of weeks.\" \"Don\u0027t you think that it would be advisable-before all prices are frozen-to adjust the matter of the railroad rates? I was thinking of a raise. A small but most essentially needed raise.\" \"We\u0027ll discuss it, you and I,\" said Mouch amiably. \"It might be arranged.\" He turned to the others; Boyle\u0027s face was sagging. \"There are many details still to be worked out, but I\u0027m sure that our program won\u0027t encounter any major difficulties.\" He was assuming the tone and manner of a public address; he sounded brisk and almost cheerful. \"Rough spots are to be expected. If one thing doesn\u0027t work, we\u0027ll try another. Trial-and-error is the only pragmatic rule of action. We\u0027ll just keep on trying. If any hardships come up, remember that it\u0027s only temporary. Only for the duration of the national emergency.\" \"Say,\" asked Kinnan, \"how is the emergency to end if everything is to stand still?\" \"Don\u0027t be theoretical,\" said Mouch impatiently. \"We\u0027ve got to deal with the situation of the moment. Don\u0027t bother about minor details, so long as the broad outlines of our policy are clear. We\u0027ll have the power. We\u0027ll be able to solve any problem and answer any question.\" Fred Kinnan chuckled. \"Who is John Galt?\" \"Don\u0027t say that!\" cried Taggart. \"I have a question to ask about Point Seven,\" said Kinnan. \"It says that al! wages, prices, salaries, dividends, profits and so forth will be frozen on the date of the directive. Taxes, too?\" \"Oh no!\" cried Mouch. \"How can we tell what funds we\u0027ll need in the future?\" Kinnan seemed to be smiling. \"Well?\" snapped Mouch. \"What about it?\" \"Nothing,\" said Kinnan. \"I just asked.\" Mouch leaned back in his chair. \"I must say to all of you that I appreciate your coming here and giving us the benefit of your opinions. It has been very helpful.\" He leaned forward to look at his desk calendar and sat over it for a moment, toying with his pencil, Then the pencil came down, struck a date and drew a circle around it. \"Directive 10-289 will go into effect on the morning of May first.\" All nodded approval. None looked at his neighbor. James Taggart rose, walked to the window and pulled the blind down over the white obelisk. In the first moment of awakening, Dagny was astonished to find herself looking at the spires of unfamiliar buildings against a glowing, pale blue sky. Then she saw the twisted seam of the thin stocking on her own leg, she felt a wrench of discomfort in the muscles of her waistline, and she realized that she was lying on the couch in her office, with the clock on her desk saying 6:15 and the first rays of the sun giving silver edges to the silhouettes of the skyscrapers beyond the window. The last thing she remembered was that she had dropped down on the couch, intending to rest for ten minutes, when the window was black and the clock stood at 3:30. She twisted herself to her feet, feeling an enormous exhaustion. The lighted lamp on the desk looked futile in the glow of the morning, over the piles of paper which were her cheerless, unfinished task. She tried not to think of the work for a few minutes longer, while she dragged herself past the desk to her washroom and let handfuls of cold water run over her face. The exhaustion was gone by the time she stepped back into the office. No matter what night preceded it, she had never known a morning when she did not feel the rise of a quiet excitement that became a tightening energy in her body and a hunger for action in her mind-because this was the beginning of day and it was a day of her life. She looked down at the city. The streets were still empty, it made them look wider, and in the luminous cleanliness of the spring air they seemed to be waiting for the promise of all the greatness that would take form in the activity about to pour through them. The calendar in the distance said: May 1. She sat down at her desk, smiling in defiance at the distastefulness of her job. She hated the reports that she had to finish reading, but it was her job, it was her railroad, it was morning. She lighted a cigarette, thinking that she would finish this task before breakfast; she turned off the lamp and pulled the papers forward. There were reports from the general managers of the four Regions of the Taggart system, their pages a typewritten cry of despair over the breakdowns of equipment. There was a report about a wreck on the main line near Winston, Colorado. There was the new budget of the Operating Department, the revised budget based on the raise in rates which Jim had obtained last week. She tried to choke the exasperation of hopelessness as she went slowly over the budget\u0027s figures: all those calculations had been made on the assumption that the volume of freight would remain unchanged and that the raise would bring them added revenue by the end of the year; she knew that the freight tonnage would go on shrinking, that the raise would make little difference, that by the end of this year their losses would be greater than ever. When she looked up from the pages, she saw with a small jolt of astonishment that the clock said 9:25. She had been dimly aware of the usual sound of movement and voices in the anteroom of her office, as her staff had arrived to begin their day; she wondered why nobody had entered her office and why her telephone had remained silent; as a daily rule, there should have been a rush of business by this hour. She glanced at her calendar; there was a note that the McNeil Car Foundry of Chicago was to phone her at nine A.M. in regard to the new freight cars which Taggart Transcontinental had been expecting for six months. She flicked the switch of the interoffice communicator to call her secretary. The girl\u0027s voice answered with a startled little gasp: \"Miss Taggart! Are you here, in your office?\" \"I slept here last night, again. Didn\u0027t intend to, but did. Was there a call for me from the McNeil Car Foundry?\" \"No, Miss Taggart.\" \"Put them through to me immediately, when they call.\" \"Yes, Miss Taggart.\" Switching the communicator off, she wondered whether she imagined it or whether there had been something strange in the girl\u0027s voice: it had sounded unnaturally tense. She felt the faint light-headedness of hunger and thought that she should go down to get a cup of coffee, but there was still the report of the chief engineer to finish, so she lighted one more cigarette. The chief engineer was out on the road, supervising the reconstruction of the main track with the Rearden Metal rail taken from the corpse of the John Galt Line; she had chosen the sections most urgently in need of repair. Opening his report, she read-with a shock of incredulous anger-that he had stopped work in the mountain section of Winston, Colorado. He recommended a change of plans: he suggested that the rail intended for Winston be used, instead, to repair the track of their Washington-to-Miami branch. He gave his reasons: a derailment had occurred on that branch last week, and Mr. Tinky Holloway of Washington, traveling with a party of friends, had been delayed for three hours; it had been reported to the chief engineer that Mr. Holloway had expressed extreme displeasure. Although, from a purely technological viewpoint-said the chief engineer\u0027s report-the rail of the Miami branch was in better condition than that of the Winston section, one had to remember, from a sociological viewpoint, that the Miami branch carried a much more important class of passenger traffic; therefore, the chief engineer suggested that Winston could be kept waiting a little longer, and recommended the sacrifice of an obscure section of mountain trackage for the sake of a branch where \"Taggart Transcontinental could not afford to create an unfavorable impression.\" She read, slashing furious pencil marks on the margins of the pages, thinking that her first duty of the day, ahead of any other, was to stop this particular piece of insanity. The telephone rang. \"Yes?\" she asked, snatching the receiver. \"McNeil Car Foundry?\" \"No,\" said the voice of her secretary. \"Senor Francisco d\u0027Anconia.\" She looked at the phone\u0027s mouthpiece for the instant of a brief shock. \"All right. Put him on.\" The next voice she heard was Francisco\u0027s. \"I see that you\u0027re in your office just the same,\" he said; his voice was mocking, harsh and tense. \"Where did you expect me to be?\" \"How do you like the new suspension?\" \"What suspension?\" \"The moratorium on brains.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Haven\u0027t you seen today\u0027s newspapers?\" \"No.\" There was a pause; then his voice came slowly, changed and grave: \"Better take a look at them, Dagny.\" \"All right.\" \"I\u0027ll call you later.\" She hung up and pressed the switch of the communicator on her desk. \"Get me a newspaper,\" she said to her secretary. \"Yes, Miss Taggart,\" the secretary\u0027s voice answered grimly. It was Eddie Willers who came in and put the newspaper down on her desk. The meaning of the look on his face\u0027 was the same as the tone she had caught in Francisco\u0027s voice: the advance notice of some inconceivable disaster. \"None of us wanted to be first to tell you,\" he said very quietly and walked out. When she rose from her desk, a few moments later, she felt that she had full control of her body and that she was not aware of her body\u0027s existence. She felt lifted to her feet and it seemed to her that she stood straight, not touching the ground. There was an abnormal clarity about every object in the room, yet she was seeing nothing around her, but she knew that she would be able to see the thread of a cobweb if her purpose required it, just as she would be able to walk with a somnambulist\u0027s assurance along the edge of a roof. She could not know that she was looking at the room with the eyes of a person who had lost the capacity and the concept of doubt, and what remained to her was the simplicity of a single perception and of a single goal. She did not know that the thing which seemed so violent, yet felt like such a still, unfamiliar calm within her, was the power of full certainty-and that the anger shaking her body, the anger which made her ready, with the same passionate indifference, either to kill or to die, was her love of rectitude, the only love to which all the years of her life had been given. Holding the newspaper in her hand, she walked out of her office and on toward the hall. She knew, crossing the anteroom, that the faces of her staff were turned to her, but they seemed to be many years away. She walked down the hall, moving swiftly but without effort, with the same sensation of knowing that her feet were probably touching the ground but that she did not feel it. She did not know how many rooms she crossed to reach Jim\u0027s office, or whether there had been any people in her way, she knew the direction to take and the door to pull open to enter unannounced and walk toward his desk. The newspaper was twisted into a roll by the time she stood before him. She threw it at his face, it struck his cheek and fell down to the carpet. \"There\u0027s my resignation, Jim,\" she said. \"I won\u0027t work as a slave or as a slave-driver.\" She did not hear the sound of his gasp; it came with the sound of the door closing after her. She went back to her office and, crossing the anteroom, signaled Eddie to follow her inside. She said, her voice calm and clear, \"I have resigned.\" He nodded silently. \"I don\u0027t know as yet what I\u0027ll do in the future. I\u0027m going away, to think it over and to decide. If you want to follow me, I\u0027ll be at the lodge in Woodstock.\" It was an old hunting cabin in a forest of the Berkshire Mountains, which she had inherited from her father and had not visited for years. \"I want to follow,\" he whispered, \"I want to quit, and . . . and I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t make myself do it.\" \"Then will you do me a favor?\" \"Of course.\" \"Don\u0027t communicate with me about the railroad. I don\u0027t want to hear it. Don\u0027t tell anyone where I am, except Hank Rearden. If he asks, tell him about the cabin and how to get there. But no one else. I don\u0027t want to see anybody.\" \"All right.\" \"Promise?\" \"Of course.\" \"When I decide what\u0027s to become of me, I\u0027ll let you know.\" \"Ill wait.\" \"That\u0027s all, Eddie.\" He knew that every word was measured and that nothing else could be said between them at this moment. He inclined his head, letting it say the rest, then walked out of the office. She saw the chief engineer\u0027s report still lying open on her desk, and thought that she had to order him at once to resume the work on the Winston section, then remembered that it was not her problem any longer. She felt no pain. She knew that the pain would come later and that it would be a tearing agony of pain, and that the numbness of this moment was a rest granted to her, not after, but before, to make her ready to bear it. But it did not matter. If that is required of me, then I\u0027ll bear it-she thought. She sat down at her desk and telephoned Rearden at his mills in Pennsylvania. \"Hello, dearest,\" he said. He said it simply and clearly, as if he wanted to say it because it was real and right, and he needed to hold on to the concepts of reality and rightness. \"Hank, I\u0027ve quit.\" \"I see.\" He sounded as if he had expected it. \"Nobody came to get me, no destroyer, perhaps there never was any destroyer, after all. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do next, but I have to get away, so that I won\u0027t have to see any of them for a while. Then I\u0027ll decide. I know that you can\u0027t go with me right now.\" \"No. I have two weeks in which they expect me to sign their Gift Certificate. I want to be right here when the two weeks expire.\" \"Do you need me-for the two weeks?\" \"No. It\u0027s worse for you than for me. You have no way to fight them. I have. I think I\u0027m glad they did it. It\u0027s clear and final. Don\u0027t worry about me. Rest. Rest from all of it, first.\" \"Yes.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"To the country. To a cabin I own in the Berkshires. If you want to see me, Eddie Willers will tell you the way to get there. I\u0027ll be back in two weeks.\" \"Will you do me a favor?\" \"Yes.\" \"Don\u0027t come back until I come for you.\" \"But I want to be here, when it happens.\" \"Leave that up to me.\" \"Whatever they do to you, I want it done to me also.\" \"Leave it up to me. Dearest, don\u0027t you understand? I think that what I want most right now is what you want: not to see any of them. But I have to stay here for a while. So it will help me if I know that you, at least, are out of their reach. I want to keep one clean point in my mind, to lean against. It will be only a short while-and then I\u0027ll come for you. Do you understand?\" \"Yes, my darling. So long.\" It was weightlessly easy to walk out of her office and down the stretching halls of Taggart Transcontinental. She walked, looking ahead, her steps advancing with the unbroken, unhurried rhythm of finality. Her face was held level and it had a look of astonishment, of acceptance, of repose. She walked across the concourse of the Terminal. She saw the statue of Nathaniel Taggart. But she felt no pain from it and no reproach, only the rising fullness of her love, only the feeling that she was going to join him, not in death, but in that which had been his life. The first man to quit at Rearden Steel was Tom Colby, rolling mill foreman, head of the Rearden Steel Workers union. For ten years, he had heard himself denounced throughout the country, because his was a \"company union\" and because he had never engaged in a violent conflict with the management. This was true: no conflict had ever been necessary; Rearden paid a higher wage scale than any union scale in the country, for which he demanded-and got-the best labor force to be found anywhere. When Tom Colby told him that he was quitting, Rearden nodded, without comment or questions. \"I won\u0027t work under these conditions, myself,\" Colby added quietly, \"and I won\u0027t help, to keep the men working. They trust me. I won\u0027t be the Judas goat leading them to the stockyards.\" \"What are you going to do for a living?\" asked Rearden. \"I\u0027ve saved enough to last me for about a year.\" \"And after that?\" Colby shrugged. Rearden thought of the boy with the angry eyes, who mined coal at night as a criminal. He thought of all the dark roads, the alleys, the back yards of the country, where the best of the country\u0027s men would now exchange their services in jungle barter, in chance jobs, in unrecorded transactions. He thought of the end of that road. Tom Colby seemed to know what he was thinking. \"You\u0027re on your way to end up right alongside of me, Mr. Rearden,\" he said. \"Are you going to sign your brains over to them?\" \"No.\" \"And after that?\" Rearden shrugged. Colby\u0027s eyes watched him for a moment, pale, shrewd eyes in a furnace-tanned face with soot-engraved wrinkles. \"They\u0027ve been telling us for years that it\u0027s you against me, Mr. Rearden. But it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s Orren Boyle and Fred Kinnan against you and me.\" \"I know it.\" The Wet Nurse had never entered Rearden\u0027s office, as if sensing that that was a place he had no right to enter. He always waited to catch a glimpse of Rearden outside. The directive had attached him to his job, as the mills\u0027 official watchdog of over-or-under-production. He stopped Rearden, a few days later, in an alley between the rows of open-hearth furnaces. There was an odd look of fierceness on the boy\u0027s face. \"Mr. Rearden,\" he said, \"I wanted to tell you that if you want to pour ten times the quota of Rearden Metal or steel or pig iron or anything, and bootleg it all over the place to anybody at any price-I wanted to tell you to go ahead. Ill fix it up. I\u0027ll juggle the books, I\u0027ll fake the reports, I\u0027ll get phony witnesses, I\u0027ll forge affidavits, I\u0027ll commit perjury-so you don\u0027t have to worry, there won\u0027t be any trouble!\" \"Now why do you want to do that?\" asked Rearden, smiling, but his smile vanished when he heard the boy answer earnestly: \"Because I want, for once, to do something moral.\" \"That\u0027s not the way to be moral-\" Rearden started, and stopped abruptly, realizing that- it was the way, the only way left, realizing through how many twists of intellectual corruption upon corruption this boy had to struggle toward his momentous discovery. \"I guess that\u0027s not the word,\" the boy said sheepishly. \"I know it\u0027s a stuffy, old-fashioned word. That\u0027s not what I meant. I meant-\" It was a sudden, desperate cry of incredulous anger: \"Mr. Rearden, they have no right to do it!\" \"What?\" \"Take Rearden Metal away from you.\" Rearden smiled and, prompted by a desperate pity, said, \"Forget it, Non-Absolute. There are no rights.\" \"I know there aren\u0027t. But I mean . . . what I mean is that they can\u0027t do it.\" \"Why not?\" He could not help smiling. \"Mr. Rearden, don\u0027t sign the Gift Certificate! Don\u0027t sign it, on principle.\" \"I won\u0027t sign it. But there aren\u0027t any principles.\" \"I know there aren\u0027t.\" He was reciting it in full earnestness, with the honesty of a conscientious student: \"I know that everything is relative and that nobody can know anything and that reason is an illusion and that there isn\u0027t any reality. But I\u0027m just talking about Rearden Metal. Don\u0027t sign, Mr. Rearden. Morals or no morals, principles or no principles, just don\u0027t sign it-because it isn\u0027t right!\" No one else mentioned the directive in Rearden\u0027s presence. Silence was the new aspect about the mills. The men did not speak to him when he appeared in the workshops, and he noticed that they did not speak to one another. The personnel office received no formal resignations. But every other morning, one or two men failed to appear and never appeared again. Inquiries at their homes found the homes abandoned and the men gone. The personnel office did not report these desertions, as the directive required; instead, Rearden began to see unfamiliar faces among the workers, the drawn, beaten faces of the long unemployed, and heard them addressed by the names of the men who had quit. He asked no questions. There was silence throughout the country. He did not know how many industrialists had retired and vanished on May 1 and 2, leaving their plants to be seized. He counted ten among his own customers, including McNeil of the McNeil Car Foundry in Chicago. He had no way of learning about the others; no reports appeared in the newspapers. The front pages of the newspapers were suddenly full of stories about spring floods, traffic accidents, school picnics and golden-wedding anniversaries. There was silence in his own home. Lillian had departed on a vacation trip to Florida, in mid-April; it had astonished him, as an inexplicable whim; it was the first trip she had taken alone since their marriage. Philip avoided him, with a look of panic. His mother stared at Rearden in reproachful bewilderment; she said nothing, but she kept bursting into tears in his presence, her manner suggesting that her tears were the most important aspect to consider in whatever disaster it was that she sensed approaching. On the morning of May 15, he sat at the desk in his office, above the spread of the mills, and watched the colors of the smoke rising to the clear, blue sky. There were spurts of transparent smoke, like waves of heat, invisible but for the structures that shivered behind them; there were streaks of red smoke, and sluggish columns of yellow, and light, floating spirals of blue-and the thick, tight, swiftly pouring coils that looked like twisted bolts of satin tinged a mother-of-pearl pink by the summer sun. The buzzer rang on his desk, and Miss Ives voice said, \"Dr. Floyd Ferris to see you, without appointment, Mr. Rearden.\" In spite of its rigid formality, her tone conveyed the question: Shall I throw him out? There was a faint movement of astonishment in Rearden\u0027s face, barely above the line of indifference: he had not expected that particular emissary. He answered evenly, \"Ask him to come in.\" Dr. Ferris did not smile as he walked toward Rearden\u0027s desk; he merely wore a look suggesting that Rearden knew full well that he had good reason to smile and so he would abstain from the obvious. He sat down in front of the desk, not waiting for an invitation; he carried a briefcase, which he placed across his knees; he acted as if words were superfluous, since his reappearance in this office had made everything clear. Rearden sat watching him in patient silence. \"Since the deadline for the signing of the national Gift Certificates expires tonight at midnight,\" said Dr. Ferris, in the tone of a salesman extending a special courtesy to a customer, \"I have come to obtain your signature, Mr. Rearden.\" He paused, with an air of suggesting that the formula now called for an answer. \"Go on,\" said Rearden. \"I am listening.\" \"Yes, I suppose I should explain,\" said Dr. Ferris, \"that we wish to get your signature early in the day in order to announce the fact on a national news broadcast. Although the gift program has gone through quite smoothly, there are still a few stubborn individualists left, who have failed to sign-small fry, really, whose patents are of no crucial value, but we cannot let them remain unbound, as a matter of principle, you understand. They are, we believe, waiting to follow your lead. You have a great popular following, Mr. Rearden, much greater than you suspected or knew how to use. Therefore, the announcement that you have signed will remove the last hopes of resistance and, by midnight, will bring in the last signatures, thus completing the program on schedule.\" Rearden knew that of all possible speeches, this was the last Dr. Ferris would make if any doubt of his surrender remained in the man\u0027s mind. \"Go on,\" said Rearden evenly. \"You haven\u0027t finished.\" \"You know-as you have demonstrated at your trial-how important it is, and why, that we obtain all that property with the voluntary consent of the victims.\" Dr. Ferris opened his briefcase. \"Here is the Gift Certificate, Mr. Rearden. We have filled it out and all you have to do is to sign your name at the bottom.\" The piece of paper, which he placed in front of Rearden, looked like a small college diploma, with the text printed in old-fashioned script and the particulars inserted by typewriter. The thing stated that he, Henry Rearden, hereby transferred to the nation all rights to the metal alloy now known as \"Rearden Metal,\" which would henceforth be manufactured by all who so desired, and which would bear the name of \"Miracle Metal,\" chosen by the representatives of the people. Glancing at the paper, Rearden wondered whether it was a deliberate mockery of decency, or so low an estimate of their victims\u0027 intelligence, that had made the designers of this paper print the text across a faint drawing of the Statue of Liberty. His eyes moved slowly to Dr. Ferris\u0027 face. \"You would not have come here,\" he said, \"unless you had some extraordinary kind of blackjack to use on me. What is it?\" \"Of course,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"I would expect you to understand that. That is why no lengthy explanations are necessary.\" He opened his briefcase. \"Do you wish to see my blackjack? I have brought a few samples.\" In the manner of a cardsharp whisking out a long fan of cards with one snap of the hand, he spread before Rearden a line of glossy photographic prints. They were photostats of hotel and auto court registers, bearing in Rearden\u0027s handwriting the names of Mr. and Mrs. J. Smith. \"You know, of course,\" said Dr. Ferris softly, \"but you might wish to see whether we know it, that Mrs. J. Smith is Miss Dagny Taggart.\" He found nothing to observe in Rearden\u0027s face. Rearden had not moved to bend over the prints, but sat looking down at them with grave attentiveness, as if, from the perspective of distance, he were discovering something about them which he had not known. \"We have a great deal of additional evidence,\" said Dr. Ferris, and tossed down on the desk a photostat of the jeweler\u0027s bill for the ruby pendant. \"You wouldn\u0027t care to see the sworn statements of apartment house doormen and night clerks-they contain nothing that would be new to you, except the number of witnesses who know where you spent your nights in New York, for about the last two years. You mustn\u0027t blame those people too much. It\u0027s an interesting characteristic of epochs such as ours that people begin to be afraid of saying the things they want to say-and afraid, when questioned, to remain silent about things they\u0027d prefer never to utter. That is to be expected. But you would be astonished if you knew who gave us the original tip.\" \"I know it,\" said Rearden; his voice conveyed no reaction. The trip to Florida was not inexplicable to him any longer. \"There is nothing in this blackjack of mine that can harm you personally,\" said Dr. Ferris, \"We knew that no form of personal injury would ever make you give in. Therefore, I am telling you frankly that this will not hurt you at all. It will only hurt Miss Taggart.\" Rearden was looking straight at him now, but Dr. Ferris wondered why it seemed to him that the calm, closed face was moving away into a greater and greater distance. \"If this affair of yours is spread from one end of the country to the other,\" said Dr, Ferris, \"by such experts in the art of smearing as Bertram Scudder, it will do no actual damage to your reputation. Beyond a few glances of curiosity and a few raised eyebrows in a few of the stuffier drawing rooms, you will get off quite easily. Affairs of this sort are expected of a man. In fact, it will enhance your reputation. It will give you an aura of romantic glamour among the women and, among the men, it will give you a certain kind of prestige, in the nature of envy for an unusual conquest. But what it will do to Miss Taggart-with her spotless name, her reputation for being above scandal, her peculiar position of a woman in a strictly masculine business-what it will do to her, what she will see in the eyes of everyone she meets, what she will hear from every man she deals with-I will leave that up to your own mind to imagine. And to consider.\" Rearden felt nothing but a great stillness and a great clarity. It was as if some voice were telling him sternly: This is the time-the scene is lighted-now look. And standing naked in the great light, he was looking quietly, solemnly, stripped of fear, of pain, of hope, with nothing left to him but the desire to know. Dr. Ferris was astonished to hear him say slowly, in the dispassionate tone of an abstract statement that did not seem to be addressed to his listener, \"But all your calculations rest on the fact that Miss Taggart is a virtuous woman, not the slut you\u0027re going to call her.\" \"Yes, of course,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"And that this means much more to me than a casual affair.\" \"Of course.\" \"If she and I were the kind of scum you\u0027re going to make us appear, your blackjack wouldn\u0027t work.\" \"No, it wouldn\u0027t.\" \"If our relationship were the depravity you\u0027re going to proclaim it to be, you\u0027d have no way to harm us.\" \"No.\" \"We\u0027d be outside your power.\" \"Actually-yes.\" It was not to Dr. Ferris that Rearden was speaking. He was seeing a long line of men stretched through the centuries from Plato onward, whose heir and final product was an incompetent little professor with the appearance of a gigolo and the soul of a thug. \"I offered you, once, a chance to join us,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"You refused. Now you can see the consequences. How a man of your intelligence thought that he could win by playing it straight, I can\u0027t imagine.\" \"But if I had joined you,\" said Rearden with the same detachment, as if he were not speaking about himself, \"what would I have found worth looting from Orren Boyle?\" \"Oh hell, there\u0027s always enough suckers to expropriate in the world!\" \"Such as Miss Taggart? As Ken Danagger? As Ellis Wyatt? As I?\" \"Such as any man who wants to be impractical.\" \"You mean that it is not practical to live on earth, is it?\" He did not know whether Dr. Ferris answered him. He was not listening any longer. He was seeing the pendulous face of Orren Boyle with the small slits of pig\u0027s eyes, the doughy face of Mr. Mowen with the eyes that scurried away from any speaker and any fact-he was seeing them go through the jerky motions of an ape performing a routine it had learned to copy by muscular habit, performing it in order to manufacture Rearden Metal, with no knowledge and no capacity to know what had taken place in the experimental laboratory of Rearden Steel through ten years of passionate devotion to an excruciating effort. It was proper that they should now call it \"Miracle Metal\".-a miracle was the only name they could give to those ten years and to that faculty from which Rearden Metal was born-a miracle was all that the Metal could be in their eyes, the product of an unknown, unknowable cause, an object in nature, not to be explained, but to be seized, like a stone or a weed, theirs for the seizing-\"are we to let the many remain in want while the few withhold from us the better products and methods available?\" If I had not known that my life depends on my mind and my effort-he was saying soundlessly to the line of men stretched through the centuries-if I had not made it my highest moral purpose to exercise the best of my effort and the fullest capacity of my mind in order to support and expand my life, you would have found nothing to loot from me, nothing to support your own existence. It is not my sins that you\u0027re using to injure me, but my virtues-my virtues by your own acknowledgment, since your own life depends on them, since you need them, since you do not seek to destroy my achievement but to seize it. He remembered the voice of the gigolo of science saying to him: \"We\u0027re after power and we mean it. You fellows were pikers, but we know the real trick.\" We were not after power-he said to the gigolo\u0027s ancestors-in-spirit-and we did not live by means of that which we condemned. We regarded productive ability as virtue-and we let the degree of his virtue be the measure of a man\u0027s reward. We drew no advantage from the things we regarded as evil-we did not require the existence of bank robbers in order to operate our banks, or of burglars in order to provide for our homes, or of murderers in order to protect our lives. But you need the products of a man\u0027s ability-yet you proclaim that productive ability is a selfish evil and you turn the degree of a man\u0027s productiveness into the measure of his loss. We lived by that which we held to be good and punished that which we held to be evil. You live by that which you denounce as evil and punish that which you know to be good. He remembered the formula of the punishment that Lillian had sought to impose on him, the formula he had considered too monstrous to believe-and he saw it now in its full application, as a system of thought, as a way of life and on a world scale. There it was: the punishment that required the victim\u0027s own virtue as the fuel to make it work-his invention of Rearden Metal being used as the cause of his expropriation-Dagny\u0027s honor and the depth of their feeling for each other being used as a tool of blackmail, a blackmail from which the depraved would be immune-and, in the People\u0027s States of Europe, millions of men being held in bondage by means of their desire to live, by means of their energy drained in forced labor, by means of their ability to feed their masters, by means of the hostage system, of their love for their children or wives or friends-by means of love, ability and pleasure as the fodder for threats and the bait for extortion, with love tied to fear, ability to punishment, ambition to confiscation, with blackmail as law, with escape from pain, not quest for pleasure, as the only incentive to effort and the only reward of achievement-men held enslaved by means of whatever living power they possessed and of whatever joy they found in life. Such was the code that the world had accepted and such was the key to the code: that it hooked man\u0027s love of existence to a circuit of torture, so that only the man who had nothing to offer would have nothing to fear, so that the virtues which made life possible and the values which gave it meaning became the agents of its destruction, so that one\u0027s best became the tool of one\u0027s agony, and man\u0027s life on earth became impractical. \"Yours was the code of life,\" said the voice of a man whom he could not forget. \"What, then, is theirs?\" Why had the world accepted it?-he thought. How had the victims come to sanction a code that pronounced them guilty of the fact of existing? . . . And then the violence of an inner blow became the total stillness of his body as he sat looking at a sudden vision: Hadn\u0027t he done it also? Hadn\u0027t he given his sanction to the code of self damnation? Dagny-he thought-and the depth of their feeling for each other . . . the blackmail from which the depraved would be immune . . . hadn\u0027t he, too, once called it depravity? Hadn\u0027t he been first to throw at her all the insults which the human scum was now threatening to throw at her in public? Hadn\u0027t he accepted as guilt the highest happiness he had ever found? \"You who won\u0027t allow one per cent of impurity into an alloy of metal,\" the unforgotten voice was saying to him, \"what have you allowed into your moral code?\" \"Well, Mr. Rearden?\" said the voice of Dr, Ferris. \"Do you understand me now? Do we get the Metal or do we make a public showplace out of Miss Taggart\u0027s bedroom?\" He was not seeing Dr. Ferris. He was seeing-in the violent clarity that was like a spotlight tearing every riddle open to him-the day he met Dagny for the first time. It was a few months after she had become Vice-President of Taggart Transcontinental. He had been hearing skeptically, for some time, the rumors that the railroad was run by Jim Taggart\u0027s sister. That summer, when he grew exasperated at Taggart\u0027s delays and contradictions over an order of rail for a new cutoff, an order which Taggart kept placing, altering and withdrawing, somebody told him that if he wished to get any sense or action out of Taggart Transcontinental, he\u0027d better speak to Jim\u0027s sister. He telephoned her office to make an appointment and insisted on having it that same afternoon. Her secretary told him that Miss Taggart would be at the construction site of the new cutoff, that afternoon, at Milford Station between New York and Philadelphia, but would be glad to see him there if he wished. He went to the appointment resentfully; he did not like such businesswomen as he had met, and he felt that railroads were no business for a woman to play with; he expected a spoiled heiress who used her name and sex as substitute for ability, some eyebrow-plucked, over groomed female, like the lady executives of department stores. He got off the last car of a long train, far beyond the platform of Milford Station. There was a clutter of sidings, freight cars, cranes and steam shovels around him, descending from the main track down the slope of a ravine where men were grading the roadbed of the new cutoff. He started walking between the sidings toward the station building. Then he stopped. He saw a girl standing on top of a pile of machinery on a flatcar. She was looking off at the ravine, her head lifted, strands of disordered hair stirring in the wind. Her plain gray suit was like a thin coating of metal over a slender body against the spread of sun-flooded space and sky. Her posture had the lightness and unself-conscious precision of an arrogantly pure self-confidence. She was watching the work, her glance intent and purposeful, the glance of competence enjoying its own function. She looked as if this were her place, her moment and her world, she looked as if enjoyment were her natural state, her face was the living form of an active, living intelligence., a young girl\u0027s face with a woman\u0027s mouth, she seemed unaware of her body except as of a taut instrument ready to serve her purpose in any manner she wished. Had he asked himself a moment earlier whether he carried in his mind an image of what he wanted a woman to look like, he would have answered that he did not; yet, seeing her, he knew that this was the image and that it had been for years. But he was not looking at her as at a woman. He had forgotten where he was and on what errand, he was held by a child\u0027s sensation of joy in the immediate moment, by the delight of the unexpected and undiscovered, he was held by the astonishment of realizing how seldom he came upon a sight he truly liked, liked in complete acceptance and for its own sake, he was looking up at her with a faint smile, as he would have looked at a statue or a landscape, and what he felt was the sheer pleasure of the sight, the purest esthetic pleasure he had ever experienced. He saw a switchman going by and he asked, pointing, \"Who is that?\" \"Dagny Taggart,\" said the man, walking on. Rearden felt as if the words struck him inside his throat. He felt the start of a current that cut his breath for a moment, then went slowly down his body, carrying in its wake a sense of weight, a drained heaviness that left him no capacity but one. He was aware-with an abnormal clarity-of the place, the woman\u0027s name, and everything it implied, but all of it had receded into some outer ring and had become a pressure that left him alone in the center, as the ring\u0027s meaning and essence-and his only reality was the desire to have this woman, now, here, on top of the flatcar in the open sun-to have her before a word was spoken between them, as the first act of their meeting, because it would say everything and because they had earned it long ago. She turned her head. In the slow curve of the movement, her eyes came to his and stopped. He felt certain that she saw the nature of his glance, that she was held by it, yet did not name it to herself. Her eyes moved on and he saw her speak to some man who stood beside the flatcar, taking notes. Two things struck him together: his return to his normal reality, and the shattering impact of guilt. He felt a moment\u0027s approach to that which no man may feel fully and survive: a sense of self-hatred-the more terrible because some part of him refused to accept it and made him feel guiltier. It was not a progression of words, but the instantaneous verdict of an emotion, a verdict that told him: This, then, was his nature, this was his depravity-that the shameful desire he had never been able to conquer, came to him in response to the only sight of beauty he had found, that it came with a violence he had not known to be possible, and that the only freedom now left to him was to hide it and to despise himself, but never to be rid of it so long as he and this woman were alive. He did not know how long he stood there or what devastation that span of time left within him. All that he could preserve was the will to decide that she must never know it. He waited until she had descended to the ground and the man with the notes had departed; then he approached her and said coldly: \"Miss Taggart? I am Henry Rearden.\" \"Oh!\" It was just a small break, then he heard the quietly natural \"How do you do, Mr. Rearden.\" He knew, not admitting it to himself, that the break came from some faint equivalent of his own feeling: she was glad that a face she had liked belonged to a man she could admire. When he proceeded to speak to her about business, his manner was more harshly abrupt than it had ever been with any of his masculine customers. Now, looking from the memory of the girl on the flatcar to the Gift Certificate lying on his desk, he felt as if the two met in a single shock, fusing all the days and doubts he had lived between them, and, by the glare of the explosion, in a moment\u0027s vision of a final sum, he saw the answer to all his questions. He thought: Guilty?-guiltier than I had known, far guiltier than I had thought, that day-guilty of the evil of damning as guilt that which was my best. I damned the fact that my mind and body were a unit, and that my body responded to the values of my mind. I damned the fact that joy is the core of existence, the motive power of every living being, that it is the need of one\u0027s body as it is the goal of one\u0027s spirit, that my body was not a weight of inanimate muscles, but an instrument able to give me an experience of superlative joy to unite my flesh and my spirit. That capacity, which I damned as shameful, had left me indifferent to sluts, but gave me my one desire in answer to a woman\u0027s greatness. That desire, which I damned as obscene, did not come from the sight of her body, but from the knowledge that the lovely form I saw, did express the spirit I was seeing-it was not her body that I wanted, but her person-it was not the girl in gray that I had to possess, but the woman who ran a railroad. But I damned my body\u0027s capacity to express what I felt, I damned, as an affront to her, the highest tribute I could give her-just as they damn my ability to translate the work of my mind into Rearden Metal, just as they damn me for the power to transform matter to serve my needs. I accepted their code and believed, as they taught me, that the values of one\u0027s spirit must remain as an impotent longing, unexpressed in action, untranslated into reality, while the life of one\u0027s body must be lived in misery, as a senseless, degrading performance, and those who attempt to enjoy it must be branded as inferior animals. I broke their code, but I fell into the trap they intended, the trap of a code devised to be broken. I took no pride in my rebellion, I took it as guilt, I did not damn them, I damned myself, I did not damn their code, I damned existence-and I hid my happiness as a shameful secret. I should have lived it openly, as of our right-or made her my wife, as in truth she was. But I branded my happiness as evil and made her bear it as a disgrace. What they want to do to her now, I did it first. I made it possible. I did it-in the name of pity for the most contemptible woman I know. That, too, was their code, and I accepted it. I believed that one person owes a duty to another with no payment for it in return. I believed that it was my duty to love a woman who gave me nothing, who betrayed everything I lived for, who demanded her happiness at the price of mine. I believed that love is some static gift which, once granted, need no longer be deserved-just as they believe that wealth is a static possession which can be seized and held without further effort. I believed that love is a gratuity, not a reward to be earned- just as they believe it is their right to demand an unearned wealth. And just as they believe that their need is a claim on my energy, so I believed that her unhappiness was a claim on my life. For the sake of pity, not justice, I endured ten years of self-torture. I placed pity above my own conscience, and this is the core of my guilt. My crime was committed when I said to her, \"By every standard of mine, to maintain our marriage will be a vicious fraud. But my standards are not yours. I do not understand yours, I never have, but I will accept them.\" Here they are, lying on my desk, those standards I accepted without understanding, here is the manner of her love for me, that love which I never believed, but tried to spare. Here is the final product of the unearned. I thought that it was proper to commit injustice, so long as I would be the only one to suffer. But nothing can justify injustice. And this is the punishment for accepting as proper that hideous evil which is self-immolation. I thought that I would be the only victim. Instead, I\u0027ve sacrificed the noblest woman to the vilest. When one acts on pity against justice, it is the good whom one punishes for the sake of the evil; when one saves the guilty from suffering, it is the innocent whom one forces to suffer. There is no escape from justice, nothing can be unearned and unpaid for in the universe, neither in matter nor in spirit-and if the guilty do not pay, then the innocent have to pay it. It was not the cheap little looters of wealth who have beaten me-it was I. They did not disarm me-I threw away my weapon. This is a battle that cannot be fought except with clean hands-because the enemy\u0027s sole power is in the sores of one\u0027s conscience-and I accepted a code that made me regard the strength of my hands as a sin and a stain. \"Do we get the Metal, Mr. Rearden?\" He looked from the Gift Certificate on his desk to the memory of the girl on the flatcar. He asked himself whether he could deliver the radiant being he had seen in that moment, to the looters of the mind and the thugs of the press. Could he continue to let the innocent bear punishment? Could he let her take the stand he should have taken? Could he now defy the enemy\u0027s code, when the disgrace would be hers, not his-when the muck would be thrown at her, not at him-when she would have to fight, while he\u0027d be spared? Could he let her existence be turned into a hell he would have no way of sharing? He sat still, looking up at her, I love you, he said to the girl on the flatcar, silently pronouncing the words that had been the meaning of that moment four years ago, feeling the solemn happiness that belonged with the words, even though this was how he had to say it to her for the first time. He looked down at the. Gift Certificate. Dagny, he thought, you would not let me do it if you knew, you will hate me for it if you learn-but I cannot let you pay my debts. The fault was mine and I will not shift to you the punishment which is mine to take. Even if I have nothing else now left to me, I have this much: that I see the truth, that I am free of their guilt, that I can now stand guiltless in my own eyes, that I know I am right, right fully and for the first time-and that I will remain faithful to the one commandment of my code which I have never broken: to be a man who pays his own way. I love you, he said to the girl on the flatcar, feeling as if the light of that summer\u0027s sun were touching his forehead, as if he, too, were standing under an open sky over an unobstructed earth, with nothing left to him except himself. \"Well, Mr. Rearden? Are you going to sign?\u00271 asked Dr. Ferris. Rearden\u0027s eyes moved to him. He had forgotten that Ferris was there, he did not know whether Ferris had been speaking, arguing or waiting in silence. \"Oh, that?\" said Rearden. He picked up a pen and with no second glance, with the easy gesture of a millionaire signing a check, he signed his name at the foot of the Statue of Liberty and pushed the Gift Certificate across the desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1551/46037.html","bookId":1296,"book":{"id":1296,"title":"Atlas Shrugged 阿特拉斯耸耸肩","description":"简介： 作为一部乌托邦小说，《阿特拉斯耸耸肩》描绘了一个由自私而精明的商人、科学家、艺术家等社会精英组成的世外桃源，有着田园诗般的诗意和现实社会中的欲望的满足。在这里，维系着一切的不是道德而是金钱，金钱被视作为崇拜的偶像，是自由交换和公平正义的象征，每个人都...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/05/14-26-07-23-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1551","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM"}}
