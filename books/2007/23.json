Your hands are bigger than her little body,” she replied.\\n\\n Alex chuckled. He’d been so afraid to hold his tiny daughter the first time. She was so little, he felt as if he’d break her but once Jessica placed Emily in his arms he knew he could hold her twenty-four hours a day and it still wouldn’t be enough.\\n\\n Alex finished burping her and she was sound asleep. He laid her down in her bassinet and then walked hand in hand towards the laughter coming from the dining room.\\n\\n Joseph was out on the balcony saying a prayer. He was so thankful for his ever-growing family. He got a twinkle in his eyes as he thought about his youngest son. “Ah Mark, I’ve found you the perfect match,” he whispered into the night.\\n\\n Joseph chuckled to himself as he imagined his youngest son fighting to keep his bachelorhood. He would definitely fight it but the fall would be ever so sweet.\\n\\n “Joseph, everyone’s waiting on you,” came the sweet sound of his Katherine’s voice.\\n\\n “They can wait one more moment. Come here my beautiful wife,” he said, while holding his arm out towards her.\\n\\n He pulled her into his arms and kissed her with a deep love that went beyond passion. She was a part of his soul. He’d been through the good and the bad with his wife and prayed each night they’d have many more years together.\\n\\n “Okay my bride, let’s go have some dinner,” he finally said. They walked hand in hand into the dining room. Joseph looked around the large table, filled with laughter and a bit of chaos.\\n\\n Jacob was mashing his food all over his face and high chair. Jasmine was giggling about something her uncle Mark said to her and Isaiah was asleep in his father’s arms. Joseph looked towards the den and knew baby Emily was safe in her basinet.\\n\\n He was so filled with love he had to sit there for a few moments before finally standing to make a toast. Everyone knew Thanksgiving dinner didn’t officially begin until he’d made a toast and each year the blessings became greater and greater, making him appreciate so much more.\\n\\n “I would like to make a toast,” Joseph began in his normal booming voice. “I’m so thankful for the new additions to our family. Amy and Jessica, you have brought such light and joy to my sons and I will be grateful each and every day you somehow manage to tame these hooligans,” he said.\\n\\n Everyone at the table laughed, while the happy couples moved just a little bit closer to each other.\\n\\n “Of course the biggest blessing of all is to finally have the pattering of little feet running about. I love each of you beautiful babies,” he continued, as he looked at Jacob, Jasmine and Isaiah. “And what a blessing to have Emily born just one week before this most thankful of days,” he said and then gave a slight cough.\\n\\n Everyone knew he was trying to contain his emotion, so they all pretended not to notice and gave him a moment to regain his composure.\\n\\n “I know this next year will be filled with many more blessings,” he said and looked over at Mark, his youngest son, who started to squirm a bit in his seat.\\n\\n “Ha little brother, I think dad’s prophesying you’re going to be the next to give him a grandkid,” Lucas goaded his youngest brother.\\n\\n “You know that’s not going to happen. I’m a confirmed bachelor,” he said on a laugh but there also seemed to be a longing in his eyes which both Jessica and Amy spotted. They looked at each other and smiled.\\n\\n “Your brothers were too until they met the love of their lives. Now they’re far happier than they ever were before. We’re meant to have someone by our side,” he said. He then took his beautiful wife Katherine’s hand in his.\\n\\n “I’m most grateful of all for every day I’m blessed enough to spend with you. You’re my light, my whole reason for being,” he said. Everyone was silent as they witnessed a love that couldn’t be matched.\\n\\n “I love you too Joseph,” she replied, before discretely wiping a tear from her face.\\n\\n “Now let’s eat this wonderful food that’s been prepared,” he said in a slightly cracked voice.\\n\\n “Here, here,” everyone shouted. The rest of the night was filled with laughter and remembered times.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-billionaire-s-dance-billionaire-bachelors-2/page-23.html","bookId":2007,"book":{"id":2007,"title":"The Billionaire\u0027s Dance (Billionaire Bachelors #2)","description":"Storyline: The Billionaire\u0027s Dance (Billionaire Bachelors #2) \\n Joseph Anderson has decided it is time his three successful sons find brides.
