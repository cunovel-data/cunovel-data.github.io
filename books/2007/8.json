She knew he was happy to be a father. It wasn’t what either one of them had expected but he’d quickly taken to his role as father and he was doing an amazing job.\\n\\n She wasn’t anxious to get back out to the reception. She knew most of the people out there had to be talking about how poor Alex had to marry to make his son legitimate. It made her very uncomfortable. Even though no one had treated her badly or said anything negative, they had to be thinking she’d trapped him. Even though she had plenty of her own money, Alex Anderson was a real catch. He could literally choose any bride he wanted but the choice had been stolen from him the minute he found out he was a father.\\n\\n As Jessica took a few moments longer rocking Jacob, she heard footsteps enter the softly lit den. “I’m glad to have a few moments to speak with you alone,” Joseph said softly. “I know all of this has been a little overwhelming for you and I just wanted to let you know how happy I am you’re a part of our family,” he continued, as he sat down next to her.\\n\\n “I’m very pleased to join your family, Joseph. This is all quite overwhelming though,” she finished speaking with a nervous laugh.\\n\\n “I understand how you feel Jessica but know you have a lot of people to turn to for support. Also remember that lasting marriages have started with less going for them that what you and Alex have. I think your union is off to a great start. You have this beautiful baby boy and it’s obvious to anyone who watches, you and Alex have chemistry. I can understand if you’re afraid to admit love yet but I see the way you look at my boy and it fills my heart with joy,” he finished.\\n\\n Jessica didn’t know what to say. She didn’t want to admit her growing love for Alex but she couldn’t tell his father a lie either so she thought it best to simply keep silent.\\n\\n “Let me take that amazing grandson of mine and lay him down so you can get back out to the party,” Joseph offered. She was reluctant to hand Jacob over but knew she was just being silly.\\n\\n “Thank you,” was her only reply and then empty handed again, she had no choice but to head back outdoors.\\n\\n “It’s time for our first dance as a married couple,” Alex said to her, taking her hand and pulling her onto the dance floor. All her worries washed away again as he pulled her close into his arms. Dancing intimately with him was a prelude to sex. The way he moved his hips against hers and rubbed on her lower back had her insides burning.\\n\\n When he bent down and kissed her on the neck, goose bumps appeared and a light shiver spread throughout her middle. He gazed into her eyes and neither of them needed to say a word. Her breathing increased as he whirled her around the floor and she breathed a sigh of relief as the song came to an end.\\n\\n She didn’t think she would’ve been able to remain in his arms much longer without beginning to undress him. She’d never been such a wanton woman before she’d met Alex.\\n\\n The next half hour passed slowly as she was passed from one person to the next on the dance floor. She enjoyed her father-daughter dance and a few tears fell as he told her how much he would miss his little girl being only his.\\n\\n She laughed with both Lucas and Mark, genuinely enjoying Alex’s brothers. She couldn’t understand how Mark hadn’t been snatched up yet. Of course, from her understanding, all the Anderson males held onto their bachelorhood like a rancher held onto his prize bull.\\n\\n After being whisked around, she was once again in Alex’s arms and it felt like coming home. “Are you ready to get out of here,” he whispered in her ear. Before she had a chance to reply, the music stopped.\\n\\n “I hope everyone is having a great time,” Joseph spoke into the microphone. There was an outbreak of applause at his words.\\n\\n “Good, good. Now I would like to make a toast for my son and beautiful daughter-in-law. I couldn’t be happier to have you join our family, Jessica. You are a true blessing and a perfect match for our stubborn son, who we happen to think is just about perfect. Although, we were worried no woman would ever put up with him.” The crowd erupted with laughter.\\n\\n “All joking aside, we’re grateful for this union and the blessing of our first grandson. Katherine and I both wish you the best and hope your marriage will be filled with laughter, joy and surprises. And best of all, remember a little fight now and again makes life exciting and gives you a chance to make up,” he said with a wink.\\n\\n “Katherine and I have a wedding gift for you we couldn’t quite gift wrap,” he said with a chuckle. “A new family needs a real home and not to be living in some apartment in the city. We got you a place about a mile down the road from here. It’s all set up for a nice honeymoon since Jessica doesn’t want to leave somewhere without the baby. We do insist on babysitting so you two can get some alone time together though,” he finished.\\n\\n Jessica gasped at his words. She couldn’t believe Joseph and Katherine had bought them a house. What if this all fell apart within a week, or even a month? So many people were already involved in their union and now they would have a home, which she would get attached to. She watched as Alex strode over to his father and gave him a huge hug, then did the same for his mom.\\n\\n She didn’t realize tears were falling down her cheeks until Alex came back and gently wiped them away. “If you don’t like the place, we can find something different,” he said, mistaking her anxiety.\\n\\n “No, it’s just we aren’t in a real marriage. This is all too much.” She couldn’t say anymore and quickly hugged Joseph and Katherine and then excused herself to check on the baby.\\n\\n Alex stood there, shocked for a few moments and then he was angry. He’d been enjoying the wedding and his bride and then she had to remind him it was a forced marriage. He knew she was having a hard time with the whole situation but a lot of people had gone the extra mile to make it enjoyable for her. He needed to keep his guard up around her or he could see himself getting hurt deeply.\\n\\n The party finally slowed down and they were able to make their escape. Jessica gathered up Jacob, while Alex grabbed their bags and they ran through the throng of people to the awaiting limo.\\n\\n Birdseed flew at them and cameras snapped and they were both more than grateful to be inside the safe confines of the limo. They didn’t have a very far drive, thanks to the generosity of his parents.\\n\\n Jessica was exhausted and more nervous than ever being alone with her husband. Was he going to expect her to sleep with him, or would she be allowed her own room? Did she even want her own room? The thought of sharing a house with the virile, masculine Alex and not sleeping with him seemed worse.\\n\\n She was going to have to wait and see what happened.\\n\\n They arrived at the gated driveway within a few minutes. Jessica rolled her window down to look out. The driveway seemed endless and was flanked by huge pine trees on either side, giving privacy to the house still hidden from view. When they turned another corner, the driveway opened up to a huge circular turn-around done in colored bricks. In the center was an enormous water fountain with angels dancing in the center, looking as if they were splashing each other.\\n\\n Jessica didn’t know what to say. The home was a smaller version of the Anderson Mansion. There were three stories with wrap around balconies on each level. There were five huge columns across the front, giving the home a southern plantation look. She was immediately in love with the place. She was afraid to step inside because the minute she did she knew she’d be even more in love and never want to leave. She had plenty of her own money. When things in the marriage failed, as she knew they would, maybe he would allow her to buy the place and stay there. She was tired of apartment living anyway.\\n\\n The driver opened her door and she reached in for Jacob but Alex had him already. “I can take him,” she said, not liking him taking control all of the time.\\n\\n “I’ve got him. Go ahead and check out the house. I’ll come back for the bags in a few minutes.”\\n\\n She wanted to argue with his high-handedness but decided it wasn’t worth the hassle. He would win once again but she was exhausted. The door opened, which surprised her, as she didn’t know anyone was there.\\n\\n “Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Anderson. I have a snack prepared for you in the kitchen and your room has been prepared. Would you like me to lay down the baby so you can look around?”\\n\\n Alex handed Jacob over to the woman, which Jessica immediately was going to protest. She wasn’t going to let him hand her child over to a stranger. “Jessica, this is Tina, our cook. She’s worked for my family for over twenty years and is one hundred percent trustworthy,” he said, noticing her concern.\\n\\n Jessica still wanted to rip her baby away from the stranger but knew she would look bad in doing so. “I will walk with you to the nursery so I know where Jacob is. Are baby monitors set up so I’ll be able to hear him in other parts of the house?” Jessica asked with concern.\\n\\n “Yes, and you can carry around portable listening and video devices so you know your precious one is safe at all times,” Tina reassured Jessica, as they walked up the grand staircase.\\n\\n They reached the second story and walked down a well lit hallway. “This is the master bedroom, here to the right and the baby’s room is right here across the hall. Mr. Anderson said you’d want the baby close by.” Tina pointed out a few more doorways and then led Jessica into a lovely baby’s room. The walls were identical to what she’d done at her old place. Alex must have taken pictures and had someone reproduce her artwork. All her nursery items were there, along with many new things. She noticed the camera angled in the corner and felt some relief.\\n\\n Tina laid Jacob in his crib and Jessica bent down to kiss his soft cheek and cover him up. She could stand there all day and night watching him sleep.\\n\\n “Here’s the monitor, Mrs. Anderson,” Tina said, handing over a small device. Jessica looked at it and not only were their voices coming through but there was a small screen showing her son sleeping in his crib.\\n\\n “Thank you so much Tina,” Jessica said with real gratitude. The home was very large and she would feel comforted being able to keep an eye on her son no matter where she was.\\n\\n Jessica turned to find Alex right behind her. “I tried to match Jacob’s old room as much as possible,” he said in explanation of the decorations. “My father bought this home a while ago waiting for the day one of us would choose to settle down,” That explained how he’d been able to have the nursery prepared.\\n\\n “It’s lovely, thank you. It has a lot more room than his old one,” she said honestly. She really did like the room. She liked everything about the home.\\n\\n “This door over here leads to the nanny’s room…Now before you protest, we’ll hire one together and I’m not expecting you to not take care of our son. It’s simply a good idea to have a nanny here to help you. That way you can have some free time to do whatever it is you want or need to do.”\\n\\n “I, in no way need a nanny.” She wasn’t happy about him thinking he could control everything. She’d been doing fine taking care of her son on her own. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-billionaire-s-dance-billionaire-bachelors-2/page-8.html","bookId":2007,"book":{"id":2007,"title":"The Billionaire\u0027s Dance (Billionaire Bachelors #2)","description":"Storyline: The Billionaire\u0027s Dance (Billionaire Bachelors #2) \\n Joseph Anderson has decided it is time his three successful sons find brides.
