She could try and fake an illness but her mother knew her more than anyone. She would take one look at her and it would be over. “I just had to work on an article I was writing but I’ll do it the next day,” she finally conceded, hoping he bought her story. She didn’t want him to know she was really just a coward. Alex continued to look at her for a while before he nodded. She knew he didn’t buy her story but thankfully he was man enough to not call her on her lies. “I’m going to head up to bed and read for a while,” Jessica finally said, having lost all of her appetite. “I have some work to finish up. I’ll join you in a while,” Alex replied before getting up and heading out of the room. Jessica wanted to talk to him about her feelings and try and make the marriage about more than just their son and sex but she didn’t know how to bridge the gap. She was afraid if she brought anything real up, he would run from her. Chapter Six “Surprised you could climb out of the newlywed bed long enough to join us,” Mark took a shot at his brother, while punching his arm. “Heck we didn’t see Lucas for at least six months,” he continued. “You’re lucky you’re seeing me now. Amy’s about to have the baby,” Lucas said, while looking down at his phone for the hundredth time. “Trust me; your ringer is working just fine. If anything happens you will be the first one who knows about it,” Mark laughed. “I know. I know. I worry so much about her being so pregnant. I know she’s with mom and dad but man, it’s hard to be away from her right now,” he smiled sheepishly. “Thank the lord I’m still single. You two are just a little too gushy for my tastes,” Mark sighed before jumping the fence. Lucas and Alex were right behind him. “You’ll be next you know. We both thought we would hold out and look at us. Not only are we married but fathers as well. Your day is coming,” Alex grinned at his younger brother. “No way man, I’m a confirmed bachelor and that’s how I would like to keep it. I have my hands full with all of these animals. I don’t have any time for women or babies in my life,” he added. Lucas and Alex just looked at each other and smiled. They knew their younger brother would fall and it would be their pleasure to watch it happen. “I thought you said there was some work to be done,” Alex goaded him. “You’ll be begging me to stop by the end of the day. I bet you fall over and embarrass yourself in front of your bride,” he said with a hopeful wink. “Bring it on little brother,” Alex replied, accepting the challenge. If an outsider was looking at the trio of men they’d think they belonged on a ranch. No one would be able to tell Lucas and Alex both worked in offices and flew around the world on Jets. Mark, of course was a full time rancher but it was by choice. He’d decided early on in his life office work wasn’t what he wanted to do. Their father, Joseph loved his boys intensely and supported their decisions. When Mark decided to ranch he supported him one hundred percent. Lucas, Alex and Mark looked dashing in their worn Stetson hats and boots and painted on jeans. They rode the horses around like rodeo champions and literally stopped women in their tracks when they went by. The brothers spent the afternoon bringing the cattle in and branding them. Mid afternoon they stopped by the lake for some lunch and basked in the summer heat. “Any time you boys are ready to trade in your suits and run the ranch with me, you know you’re welcome,” Mark said with a cheeky grin. “You know I love the land and helping you out here is a little slice of heaven but it wouldn’t take long before the appeal of travel and a nice clean suit would be calling my name,” Alex said. “You know dad would lasso you up for trying to take me away from the office. He’s retired and doesn’t want to go back,” Lucas added. “I’m just saying…” Mark left the sentence unfinished. Lucas and Alex both sighed in unison. “Ok last one in has to do the grilling,” Mark said while stripping down to his boxers in record time and diving into the lake. “Ah crap,” Alex yelled while trying to yank his boots off. He glanced over and saw Lucas had the lead. Lucas dived in about two seconds before he did. “I think you guys cheated again,” Alex laughed. “You know you just want me grilling because I’m the best one at it. You guys always burn that beautiful Angus Meat,” he added. “Hey, when you’re right, you’re right,” Mark said before sending a slew of water right into Alex’s face. “Now the war’s on,” Alex stated before a massive water fight erupted. When the brothers all got together, it was like they were teenagers once again. They had a bond stronger than most siblings and all three of them would take a bullet for one another. They knew they were so close due to being raised by phenomenal parents. “Ok, ok, I call a truce,” Lucas finally said, while dragging himself out of the water. Mark and Alex followed. The three of them settled down on the soft grass and enjoyed the sounds of nature all around them. “So how are things with your wife and amazing son going?” Lucas asked Alex. “Things are great. Jacob is growing like a weed. I can’t believe how important he is to me. I can even imagine having about ten more of him running around,” Alex said with true fondness for his son. “And what about Jessica?” Mark asked. Alex hesitated for a moment. He didn’t really know how to describe his relationship with his wife. He knew if he told his brothers it was none of their business they’d back off and leave him alone but it would feel good to talk about his conflicted emotions. “Honestly, it’s really complicated. We married because basically I didn’t give her any choice. She had my son, which she kept from me,” he said with an edge to his voice. He was still unhappy she hadn’t told him about the pregnancy. “Somewhere along the line though, in the last few months I’ve found I’m excited to see her. I look forward to coming home, knowing she’ll be there.” He didn’t add anything else. He didn’t want to even mention the Love word. Neither brother spoke for a few moments. They seemed to understand he was trying to figure things out in his own head. “You know things didn’t start out so well for Amy and me either, little brother,” Lucas finally said. “I fought hard against my attraction to her. I, in no way wanted to be in a relationship. On the other hand I’d never wanted a woman like I wanted her. She would walk into the room and I was on instant alert. I tried to tell myself it was just some weird hormonal imbalance but even though I was fighting it I knew it was a losing battle,” he finished. “Everyone can see you and Amy were meant to be together. Things may have started out rocky for you but you’re disgustingly in love now. There isn’t a woman out there who could love you like she does. It’s the only reason she puts up with your ugly hide,” Alex finished and punched Lucas in the arm. “Yeah, it sounds to me as if the both of you are just love sick. Thank the Lord it will never happen to me,” Mark added with a cocky smile. Lucas and Alex looked at each other and smiled. They knew their brother would go down kicking and screaming but they knew he would go down. It would be immensely pleasurable for them both to watch. “I may not be in love like Lucas but it’s nice to have something to come home too,” Alex said. He felt a twinge of pain as he said the words. He figured he was lying to himself, saying he wasn’t in love but it was better than the alternative of being vulnerable. “Yeah, I think you’re fooling yourself little bro. I’ve seen the way you look at Jessica. It’s more than just lust. You look at her the way I look at Amy. The sooner you accept that fact and enjoy being married, the sooner you can stop hurting all the time. Man, when I finally just let myself open up, my whole world changed. Seriously, if something were to ever happen to Amy, I couldn’t survive it,” Lucas finished. He then pulled his phone out for the millionth and one time to see if he’d missed a call from his very pregnant wife. “Give it a break bro; your wife will call you if she goes into labor. Your phone will not miraculously miss a call and if one or either of these things did happen, someone would come running to find you and rush you into the hospital,” Mark said. “I know, I know but wait until you’re the one in my position. There’s nothing greater than your wife giving birth. It’s amazing and beautiful and at the same time terrifying. I’d gladly take her every pain if I could. It kills me to just stand by, only holding her hand. But then there’s this beautiful child resting in her arms and she’s smiling at you with this radiant joy showing on her face. There’s nothing like it in the world,” Lucas finished. Alex sat there quietly, listening to Lucas talk. He was jealous of his brother, which was very unusual. He wished so much he could’ve been there for the birth of his son. He was still angry Jessica had taken that from him. He should’ve been there for his son’s first cry. He should’ve been there to be able to protect them both. “That sounds like heartache I don’t want to deal with,” Mark laughed. The joke brought Alex back to the present. He laughed but it was forced. Thankfully his brothers let it go. “Well, we better get back to work. Everyone should be here in a couple of hours. We don’t want them to realize we play out here more than we work,” Lucas said. He got up and headed over to get back on his horse. They all finished up with the cows and headed into the barn to brush down their horses. “It’s about time you boys quit playing around and got back here,” came the booming voice of their father, Joseph. “Hey Dad,” all three boys said in unison and then went up and gave their father a big hug. “You have a house full of people all waiting on you three,” he said good naturedly. “Well, that’s because they all know I’m doing the grilling,” Alex smiled. “I think it’s because they know your mama and your beautiful brides have been busy making everything else,” Joseph answered back. “Mmm, I hope Mom made her famous chicken salad,” Lucas said. “Well you should know your mom still spoils you boys rotten. I try and tell her you’re all grown up and don’t need her spoiling but she won’t listen to me,” Joseph said. The three boys looked at each other and rolled their eyes. They knew their father was the biggest softie of them all. “Sure Dad, Mom’s the only one who spoils us,” Mark said, while smacking his dad on the back. “Let’s head on in so we can get some of Mom’s salad and Alex can get those steaks on the grill,” he continued. His mouth was starting to water just thinking about it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-billionaire-s-dance-billionaire-bachelors-2/page-13.html","bookId":2007,"book":{"id":2007,"title":"The Billionaire\u0027s Dance (Billionaire Bachelors #2)","description":"Storyline: The Billionaire\u0027s Dance (Billionaire Bachelors #2) Joseph Anderson has decided it is time his three successful sons find brides.
