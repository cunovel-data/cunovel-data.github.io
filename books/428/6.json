{"id":13468,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. DEAN DUNHAM FINDS HIS UNCLE.","content":"When Adin Dunham reached the fork in the road from which there were two different routes to Waterford, he halted his horse in indecision. \"Seems to me as if I\u0027d rather go over the creek road,\" he said to himself. \"I don\u0027t know why \u0027tis that I don\u0027t fancy goin\u0027 through the woods to-day. It\u0027s a silly fancy, no doubt, for I\u0027ve gone that way hundreds of times, and I told the squire I\u0027d go that way, and I\u0027ll do it, or he\u0027ll think strange of it.\" So he turned to the left instead of the right, and continued his journey. Is it true that we have presentiments of coming evil? This was at any rate the case with Adin Dunham. He felt a growing uneasiness, especially when he drew near the tract of woods through which the road ran for nearly quarter of a mile. \"What is the matter with me?\" he asked, as he wiped the perspiration from his brow. \"I suppose it must be because I have so much money with me. I wish I had taken a check.\" Then he tried to laugh it off, but he could not drive away the feeling of uneasiness. Somehow the40 thought of robbers would present itself to his mind. \"I\u0027d give a five-dollar bill if I was safe at home,\" he said to himself. He had reached the middle point of the woods, and was beginning to breathe easier. Neither before nor behind was any one in sight. \"It\u0027s all right!\" he thought. \"As soon as I get through them woods I shall have nothing to worry about.\" But just then a noise was heard to the right, and a tramp burst out, his features concealed by a mask, and sprang for the horse\u0027s head. \"Halt there!\" he exclaimed in a hoarse voice. Adin Dunham\u0027s tongue refused service, and with pallid cheeks, betokening intense fear, he stared at the apparition. \"What do you want?\" he managed to ejaculate at last. \"Quick! Give me that money,\" hissed the stranger. \"What money?\" asked Adin Dunham, aghast, though he knew well enough what money was meant. \"No trifling, or it will be the worse for you! Give me the thousand dollars you have in your pocket.\" \"Are you a robber?\" asked Dunham, with blanched face. \"Never mind what I am! I want that money. It will be as much as your life is worth to refuse.\" Adin Dunham was not a brave man, but the prospect of losing his fortune, for which he had waited41 so long, made him desperate. He drew out his whip and lashed the horse. \"Get up, Captain!\" he shouted. Then, he hardly knew how it happened, the tramp clambered into the wagon, and pressed a handkerchief to his mouth. He felt his senses going, but before he lost consciousness he saw something that startled him. The tramp opened his mouth, and he caught sight of the long tusk-like teeth. \"Why, it\u0027s Squire Bates!\" he ejaculated, in horror-struck dismay. Then he lost all consciousness, and knew not what followed. \"Confusion!\" muttered the tramp. \"Why did I open my mouth?\" He thrust his hand into Adin Dunham\u0027s pocket, after stopping the horse. Then, as it would not be safe to leave the horse under the management of a man in a faint, he took the passive form of the carpenter from the wagon, and laid him down under a tree by the roadside. \"There! It will be supposed that he fell from the wagon in a fit!\" he said to himself, as he left the scene. This was what had happened to Adin Dunham. How long he lay in his senseless condition cannot be told. At length he opened his eyes, and looked about him in a dazed way. \"Where is the horse and wagon?\" he asked himself. The horse and wagon were not to be seen. The42 Captain had waited patiently, looking round from time to time, and gazing in evident doubt at his driver, whinneying a hint that they had been stopping long enough. Probably he wondered what was the matter with Adin Dunham, who, though not his master, was well known to him. At length the Captain decided that he must settle the matter for himself. He started for home at an easy pace, and arrived there at length, as we know, very much to the surprise of Mr. Gould, and the uneasiness of Dean Dunham. We have already related the sequel—how Mr. Gould and Dean got into the buggy, and, somewhat to the dissatisfaction of the horse, started back on the road to Rockmount. \"I can\u0027t see what has happened to uncle,\" said Dean. \"Does your uncle ever—drink anything strong?\" asked Mr. Gould, cautiously. \"No, Mr. Gould, he is very temperate. He has often cautioned me about drinking.\" \"I always thought he was temperate, Dean,\" said Mr. Gould, \"but I thought it just possible he might have met some old friends in Rockmount, and ventured upon a social glass.\" \"I don\u0027t believe he would do it.\" \"He might have got off for a minute, and the horse taken advantage and started without him. But that doesn\u0027t seem like the Captain. He is a very steady, reliable horse, and isn\u0027t up to any tricks.\" \"I hope uncle wasn\u0027t taken sick, and fell from the buggy.\" 43 \"Has he ever been taken that way?\" asked Mr. Gould quickly. \"Not that I ever heard. Aunt would know.\" \"We will ask her if we don\u0027t find him on the road. Do you know whether your uncle had any particular business in Rockmount to-day?\" \"No; I didn\u0027t hear him say why he was going. I asked him to take me, but he thought two would be too heavy a load for the horse such a long distance.\" \"He is very considerate of the Captain, more so than I am,\" said Mr. Gould, laughing. \"I drove to Rockmount with Mrs. Gould, who weighs considerably more than you, only last week, but I couldn\u0027t see that the horse minded it much. There\u0027s one thing I\u0027m sure of, your uncle wouldn\u0027t over-drive the horse.\" \"No, he doesn\u0027t drive fast enough for me. If I had gone, I would have asked him to let me drive.\" \"Then perhaps it\u0027s just as well that you didn\u0027t go, Dean.\" They reached the point where it was necessary to decide whether to go by the creek road or through the woods. \"I declare, Dean, it puzzles me to decide which way to go.\" \"If anything happened to uncle on the creek road somebody would be sure to pass and see him.\" \"That\u0027s a very sensible suggestion. On the woods road, on the contrary, there are but few passengers, and he might be overlooked. So be it! We\u0027ll go by the woods road.\" 44 Not far from the place where Adin Dunham was waylaid, Dean pointed eagerly to an advancing figure. \"Isn\u0027t that Uncle Adin?\" he asked eagerly pointing with his whip. \"Yes, it is, I declare.\" Adin Dunham was walking with his head drooping, and seemed to drag one leg after the other in a weary way. He did not seem at all like himself. \"Uncle Adin,\" called Dean, when they were within hearing, \"what\u0027s the matter? What has happened to you?\" Adin Dunham looked up, and sighed heavily. \"Dean,\" he said hoarsely, \"I\u0027ve been robbed!\" \"Robbed, neighbor Dunham?\" said Mr. Gould in surprise. \"What have you been robbed of?\" \"A thousand dollars!\" answered Dunham in a spiritless way. Dean and Mr. Gould looked at each other in amazement. The same thought came to each. That the carpenter could have had in his possession a thousand dollars seemed preposterous. His mind must suddenly have gone astray. \"Did you say a thousand dollars, neighbor Dunham?\" asked Mr. Gould. \"Yes,\" said poor Adin, bursting into tears. \"A man sprang at me when I was riding through the woods, jumped into the buggy and searched my pockets. I think I must have fainted away. When I came to the horse was gone, and I was lying under a tree by the roadside.\" 45 This story, though strictly correct, seemed a wild dream to Mr. Gould and Dean. \"How did you happen to have a thousand dollars with you? Was it yours?\" asked Mr. Gould, almost with a smile. \"I received it to-day at Rockmount, for the land I sold the hotel people.\" \"Have you any idea who robbed you of the money?\" \"It was Squire Bates. I knew him by his teeth.\" \"Dean,\" said Mr. Gould, in a low voice, \"your uncle is as crazy as a bedbug! What can have put such notions into his head?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81472.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
