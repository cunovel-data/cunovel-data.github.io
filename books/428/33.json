{"id":13495,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. OUT OF THE ENEMY\u0027S HANDS.","content":"\"Eben and I will hide and leave you to receive them alone,\" said Rawson, rising hastily. \"But——\" expostulated Dean in considerable alarm. \"Don\u0027t be afeared, lad. They shan\u0027t do you any harm. We want a little fun, that\u0027s all. We shall be close at hand.\" The two darted behind a tree, leaving Dean reclining on the turf. Kirby and Dan approached, engaged apparently in earnest conversation. They were close upon Dean before they recognized him. It is needless to say that their amazement was profound. \"Look there, Dan!\" said Kirby, stopping short. \"There\u0027s the kid!\" \"Well, I\u0027m beat!\" ejaculated Dan. \"How on earth can he have escaped? If he233 got away without Pompey\u0027s knowledge he\u0027s about the smartest youngster I ever came across. I will take care it shan\u0027t happen again.\" Striding forward, Kirby confronted Dean with a stern face. Dean, by way of carrying out the deception, started and assumed a look of terror. \"What does all this mean, boy?\" demanded Kirby. \"What does what mean?\" asked Dean in apparent perplexity. \"How came you here? You know well enough what I mean.\" \"I walked,\" answered Dean demurely. \"Of course you did! How did you get out of the place where I put you?\" \"I went out at the back door.\" Kirby turned to Dan in alarm. \"Was it unlocked?\" he asked, resuming his examination of the boy. \"Yes; if it hadn\u0027t been I couldn\u0027t have got out.\" \"Where is Pompey—the negro? What did you do to him?\" asked Kirby suspiciously. \"He fell asleep after dinner.\" \"And I suppose you took the key from him in his sleep,\" said Kirby, rather as a statement than an inquiry. 234 Dean made no reply, and Peter Kirby took this as an admission that he was right. \"That must be the way, Dan,\" he said, turning to his companion. \"It\u0027s lucky we met our young friend here, or we might have been deprived of his society.\" Dean looked depressed, and Kirby was deceived by his manner. \"I suppose you know what\u0027s going to happen?\" he said, addressing himself to Dean. \"No.\" \"Well, you\u0027ll soon know. You\u0027re going back to keep company with Pompey. He is very lonesome there in the cave, and he will be brightened up by having a boy as company.\" \"Oh, Mr. Kirby, please let me go on my way!\" pleaded Dean. \"I am sorry to disappoint you, but it can\u0027t be done. Sit down, Dan. We\u0027ve got a long walk before us, and we will rest a while.\" The two men seated themselves one on each side of Dean, occupying the exact places recently vacated by the two miners. Kirby had been angry at first with Dean, but the exultation he felt at recovering him abated his wrath and made him good-natured. He felt like the cat who has the mouse securely in his power. 235 \"Oho!\" he laughed, \"this is a good joke! This foolish lad really supposed that he had bidden us good-by. Didn\u0027t you, lad?\" \"Yes; I never expected to see you again.\" Kirby laughed again. \"My lad,\" he said, \"you are not yet smart enough to circumvent Peter Kirby. You\u0027ll have to be several years older at least.\" \"Mr. Kirby,\" said Dean, earnestly, \"will you tell me why you want to keep me a prisoner?\" \"Suppose I say that I like your society?\" \"I shouldn\u0027t believe you.\" \"You are a sharp one, youngster. That isn\u0027t the only reason.\" \"So I thought. What is the reason, then?\" \"You know too much and suspect too much, boy. You\u0027re a pesky young spy. We don\u0027t propose to leave you at liberty to injure us.\" \"Was that why Squire Bates arranged for you to take me with you?\" asked Dean, with a penetrating look. \"What motive could he have except to help you to a position?\" answered Kirby, evasively. \"I don\u0027t know,\" answered Dean, emphasizing the last word. \"But you suspect something. Is that it?\" Dean nodded. 236 \"Boy, you are too candid for your own good. It is clear that you are too sharp to be kept at liberty.\" \"Do you mean to take me back to the cave?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why not let me travel with you instead? I should prefer it to such a gloomy prison.\" \"No doubt you would, but, as it happens, I am not bound to respect or consult your wishes. No doubt you think you would have a better chance to escape if I let you go with me.\" \"Yes,\" answered Dean demurely. \"So I thought, and that is the very reason I can\u0027t gratify you. I can\u0027t be bothered with a boy I must constantly watch, though, for that matter, if you played me false again,\" he added sternly, \"I shouldn\u0027t scruple to put a bullet through your head.\" He looked fiercely at Dean as if he meant it. Dean had no doubt that nothing but a fear of the consequences would deter him from the desperate act he hinted at, and he rejoiced more than ever that he had two stalwart friends so near at hand. There was a little more conversation between Kirby and Dan, and then Kirby rose to his feet. \"Well, boy,\" he said abruptly, \"it is time for us to be going.\" \"Go if you like, Mr. Kirby!\" said Dean quietly. \"I prefer to remain where I am.\" 237 \"What, boy?\" exclaimed Kirby angrily, \"do you mean to defy us?\" \"I mean, Mr. Kirby, that you have no right to interfere with me, or to deprive me of my freedom.\" \"No right, have I?\" inquired Kirby in a sarcastic tone. \"That is what I said.\" \"Then, boy, you\u0027d better not have said it. You won\u0027t fare any better for it, I can tell you that. Come, get up, and at once!\" He leaned over, and grasping Dean by the collar pulled him roughly to his feet. The next moment, he thought he had been struck by lightning. He received a blow on the side of his head that stretched him full length on the ground. When he rose, vaguely wondering what had happened, he confronted not the boy he had assaulted, but a strong, athletic man, with a powerful frame, and a stern, resolute eye. This was Rawson, but he was not alone. Standing between Dean and Dan was another man, younger, but looking quite as powerful, Eben Jones, of Connecticut. \"What do you mean by this outrage?\" demanded Kirby, with a baffled look, gnawing his nether lip in abortive wrath. \"That\u0027s a question for me to ask, stranger,\" retorted238 Rawson coolly. \"What do you mean by assaulting this boy?\" \"What do I mean? He is my servant, who has deserted and deceived me.\" \"Is this true, lad?\" \"No, it isn\u0027t. I came West with this man, as a secretary, not knowing his character. I found out that he was a thief and then I left him.\" \"You shall answer for this, boy!\" said Kirby, almost frothing at the mouth. \"How dare you insult me?\" \"The boy is telling the truth. I make no doubt, if you call that insulting you,\" said Rawson. \"He tells us you shut him up in a cave.\" \"Yes, and I\u0027ll do it again.\" \"Will you indeed? You are at liberty to try.\" \"What have you got to do with the boy, any way?\" \"A good deal. We have just admitted him as a partner in our mining firm. You\u0027ll find us in Gilpin County if you want to call, though on the whole I wouldn\u0027t advise it, as we miners make short shrift of such fellows as you are.\" \"The boy must come with us!\" said Kirby, doggedly, unwilling to own himself beaten. \"I\u0027ve got something to say to that, stranger, and239 it\u0027s quickly said. Make yourselves scarce both of you, or you\u0027ll never know what hit you.\" He pulled from his girdle a six shooter, and pointed it at Kirby. The latter needed no second hint. He and Dan turned and walked away, muttering some ugly threats to which the two miners paid no heed. \"Now, lad, we\u0027ll have some supper,\" said Rawson, \"and look out for a good place to pass the night. I can\u0027t say much for your friends. They\u0027re about as ugly-looking knaves as I ever saw.\" \"I agree with you,\" said Dean, heartily. \"I hope I shall never see them again.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81499.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
