{"id":13496,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV. SIX MONTHS AMONG THE MINES.","content":"Six months later among the hills in Gilpin County we find three old acquaintances. They are Ben Rawson, Ebenezer Jones, and Dean Dunham. Dean has grown taller and there is a healthy brown hue on his cheeks. His eyes are bright, and his look is cheerful. The three are sitting in front of a miner\u0027s cabin, resting after the fatigues of the day. \"Have a pipe, Dean?\" asks Rawson. \"No, Ben; you know I don\u0027t smoke.\" \"You\u0027re right, lad, no doubt, but I couldn\u0027t get along without it. Do you know, boys, it is just six months to-day since we came here, after our brief interview with Dean\u0027s friends. By the way, what are their names?\" \"Peter Kirby and Dan—I don\u0027t know his last name.\" 241 \"I wonder what has become of them. It is easy to tell what will befall them at last.\" \"I hope I shall never set eyes on them again,\" said Dean, fervently. \"Well, I won\u0027t just say that; I might like to meet them if they were about to receive their deserts.\" \"Do you know how we stand, Rawson?\" asked Eben Jones, taking the pipe from his mouth. \"I was just figuring up, Eben, this afternoon, since you have made me treasurer. There\u0027s a little over three thousand dollars in the common fund.\" \"A thousand dollars apiece.\" \"Precisely. It isn\u0027t a bad showing, is it? What do you say to that, Dean? How old are you?\" \"Sixteen, but I am nearer seventeen.\" \"There are not many boys of your age who are worth a thousand dollars.\" \"I owe it to your kindness, Ben—yours and Eben\u0027s.\" \"I don\u0027t admit that, Dean. You have worked hard for it.\" \"But then I am only a boy, and yet you admit me to an equal partnership.\" \"And we\u0027re glad to do it, Dean,\" said Rawson, warmly. \"Isn\u0027t that so, Eben?\" \"You\u0027re talkin\u0027 for us both, Ben. The kid\u0027s been a great deal of company for us.\" 242 \"Besides, Dean, Eben and I have got ten thousand dollars between us in a bank in Denver, unless the bank\u0027s busted, which I haven\u0027t heard of. I say, Eben, old chap, I feel rich!\" \"I feel rich enough to go home,\" said Eben, after a thoughtful pause. \"Would you mind if I did, Ben?\" \"I should mind so much, Eben, that I should probably go along too.\" \"But that would be leaving Dean alone,\" objected Eben. \"Perhaps he would like to make a trip East also.\" \"Yes, I would,\" said Dean. \"It\u0027s a long time since I\u0027ve heard from my uncle and aunt. I think my last letter couldn\u0027t have reached them.\" \"There\u0027s one thing in the way,\" observed Rawson. \"Our claims are valuable—more so than six months ago. If we leave \u0027em some one will take possession, and that\u0027ll be an end of our ownership.\" \"Sell \u0027em,\" said Eben, concisely. \"That will take time.\" \"I\u0027ll stay till it\u0027s done. I\u0027m not going to give \u0027em away.\" \"Trust a Connecticut Yankee for that,\" said Rawson, laughing. \"Well, to-morrow, then, we\u0027ll let our neighbors know that our claims are for sale.\" Dean and his two friends retired at an early hour.243 They usually became fatigued by the labors of the day, and did not require to court slumber long. They rose early, and took their breakfast at a restaurant near by. Before this was opened, they took turns at cooking breakfast themselves, but were glad to delegate that duty to some one else. Dean, as the best penman, prepared the sign, THESE CLAIMS FOR SALE. rather fortunately, as Rawson was weak not only in writing but in spelling, and would have been very likely to write \"Theas clames fer sail,\" without a thought that he had committed an error. About nine o\u0027clock on the second morning, a small man, dressed in a drab suit, walked leisurely up to Rawson, and remarked: \"I understand that you wish to sell these claims.\" \"Exactly, if we can get a fair price.\" \"By we you mean——?\" \"Myself, Mr. Jones, and the boy. We are partners. Where might you be from, friend?\" \"I have an office in Denver. I am commissioned by a Philadelphia syndicate to buy some mining property, which will be worked with the help of improved machinery in a systematic manner.\" \"Then you will need more than we have to sell.\" 244 \"I have secured the property on each side of you,\" said the agent composedly. \"What figures are you prepared to offer?\" asked Rawson, with a look of business. \"I don\u0027t want to be extortionate, but the claims are good ones, and we don\u0027t want to sacrifice them.\" Then ensued a few minutes of bargaining, in which Dean took no part. Eben, though usually the most silent of the three, now developed the qualities characteristic of the New England Yankee, and it was due to him that the property was sold for six thousand dollars. \"I might have got more if I\u0027d stood out a little longer,\" he said, half regretfully. \"We\u0027ve done pretty well, though,\" said Rawson, complacently. \"It\u0027s two thousand dollars apiece, say three, with what we\u0027ve taken from it in the last six months. What do you say to that, lad? You\u0027ll go home with three thousand dollars.\" \"It doesn\u0027t seem possible, Ben. Why, Uncle Adin has been at work for forty years, and I don\u0027t believe the old place would fetch that.\" \"Money\u0027s easier to come at than in the old times. You\u0027ll astonish the old folks, lad.\" \"There\u0027ll be some others that\u0027ll be surprised,\" said Dean, smiling. \"Squire Bates and Brandon among the rest.\" 245 \"It\u0027s better than going home like a tramp. It\u0027s strange how much more people think of you when you\u0027re worth a little property. And I don\u0027t know but they\u0027re right. To get money, I mean honestly, a man must have some brains, and he must be willing to work. How much money do you think I had when I arrived here?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Eighteen dollars. It was grit or brains with me, I can tell you. Eben here wasn\u0027t much better off.\" \"Not so well. I only had nine dollars.\" \"And now we\u0027ve got eight thousand apiece. That\u0027ll make us comfortable for a while, eh, Eben?\" \"For life, Rawson. I shall never come back here, but settle down at home, where people will call me a rich man.\" \"I can\u0027t answer for myself. How is it with you, Dean?\" \"I shall come back,\" said Dean, positively. \"There\u0027s very little chance for me in Waterford.\" \"Well, perhaps you are right. You\u0027ll have a fair start, and you\u0027re industrious and enterprising.\" They stopped in Denver on their way home, and called at the office of the agent through whom their claims had been sold. \"Gentlemen,\" said the agent, \"may I venture to give you some advice?\" 246 \"Certainly,\" said Rawson. \"The best thing you can do with a part of your money is to invest in real estate in this town.\" Eben Jones shook his head. \"I\u0027m going to buy a farm at home, and put the rest of the money in the savings bank,\" he said. \"How is it with you, Mr. Rawson?\" \"No doubt your advice is good, but I want to let the folks at home see what I have brought in solid cash.\" \"And you?\" continued the agent, turning to Dean. \"I will invest two thousand dollars in Denver lots,\" said Dean, promptly, \"and take the rest home as a present to my uncle and aunt.\" \"You won\u0027t regret it. Denver is growing rapidly. I predict that the lots will double in your hands in a year.\" Dean took a walk round the embryo city with the agent, and made a purchase of ten lots on Lawrence street, in accordance with his judgment. \"Now,\" said the agent, smiling, \"I shall be sure to see you out here again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81500.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
