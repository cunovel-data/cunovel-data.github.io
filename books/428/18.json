{"id":13480,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. ON THE FALL RIVER BOAT.","content":"Dean didn\u0027t see his employer till the next morning. Mr. Kirby did not ask him where he had spent the evening previous, as Dean thought it possible he might do. Indeed he seemed in unusual good spirits, and handed his new clerk a couple of dollars to defray any expenses he might incur. \"Are we going to stay long in New York?\" Dean ventured to ask. \"No, we go to Boston this afternoon by the Fall River line.\" This was a surprise to Dean, who fancied they were bound west. When he suggested this, Mr. Kirby said, \"I have a little business to transact in Boston first. We can go West from there as well as from New York.\" Dean was not upon the whole sorry that he should have an opportunity of seeing a city so famous as Boston. \"I shall feel that I am quite a traveler,\" he said to himself. During the forenoon he was called upon to bid120 good-bye to Guy Gladstone. That young man had concluded his arrangements for a visit to his Indian hunting grounds, and was in a hurry to leave New York, as he was liable at any moment to meet some friend of his father\u0027s who might detain him, or ask him questions which it would embarrass him to answer. At about fifteen minutes to five o\u0027clock Dean and his employer went down to the foot of Murray Street, and went on board the steamer Pilgrim of the famous Fall River line. Mr. Kirby succeeded in obtaining a stateroom, with two berths, and allowed Dean to occupy the upper one. Our young hero surveyed with admiration the palatial accommodations of the great steamer; the grand saloon, the showy chandeliers, the handsome furniture and costly mirrors. \"You can amuse yourself as you please,\" said Kirby. \"I shall be occupied till about ten o\u0027clock, when I shall be ready to go to bed.\" He showed Dean the way to the supper room, and told him he could take supper whenever he pleased. Dean availed himself of this permission, and after supper stopped at the book table in the main saloon, which was under the charge of a boy rather older than himself, arrayed in a blue uniform. This boy he found very social and agreeable. He learned that he was called Dan, but did not inquire his last name. \"Don\u0027t you get tired of traveling on the boat?\" asked Dean. 121 \"No.\" \"But it\u0027s the same thing every night.\" \"I have my business to attend to. That prevents it becoming monotonous.\" \"Are you ever sea-sick?\" \"No,\" answered Dan with a smile. \"It would take a good deal to upset me now, I\u0027m so used to it.\" \"Do you expect to follow the business when you\u0027re a man?\" \"No, I think I shall look for a place in a wholesale store in Boston next fall. It won\u0027t pay as well at first, but it will lead to a good salary in time. I suppose you are going to Boston?\" \"Yes, but not to stay.\" \"How long do you stay there?\" \"I don\u0027t know yet. That depends upon my employer.\" \"The man you are traveling with?\" \"Yes.\" \"I noticed him. He is a tall, sallow man, isn\u0027t he?\" \"Yes.\" \"Have you been working for him long?\" \"No, I\u0027ve only just started.\" \"What do you do?\" \"I am his private secretary—that\u0027s what he calls me, but I don\u0027t know yet what my duties will be.\" \"He don\u0027t look like a man likely to employ a private secretary,\" said Dan shrewdly. \"I don\u0027t know what sort of men do have secretaries,\" Dean said in a perplexed tone. 122 \"Oh, governors, members of Congress, and sometimes authors. I don\u0027t suppose he\u0027s either of those three.\" \"I think not,\" answered Dean smiling. \"Well, he has a right to have one, at any rate. Do you like him?\" \"I can\u0027t say I do, though I have nothing to complain of. He seems to be liberal.\" \"How much does he pay you, if you don\u0027t mind telling me?\" \"Twenty-five dollars a month.\" \"And your expenses besides?\" Dean nodded. \"My, that\u0027s fine pay. I\u0027d be a private secretary myself for that.\" \"If he wants two, I\u0027ll recommend you.\" \"You can tell all you know about me,\" said Dan laughing. \"That wouldn\u0027t be much, but I can judge of you by your looks.\" \"Thank you. I couldn\u0027t recommend your employer very highly on that ground.\" Here two or three customers came up and inquired of the young news-agent about some of the latest novels. Dean, seeing that his friend was occupied, went to the after part of the boat, and seating himself on a camp stool watched with interest the progress of the vessel and the shores so far as they were visible. It was now dusk, and shadows played over the surface of the water. Meanwhile where was Mr. Kirby? 123 After a hearty supper in the dining saloon he smoked a cigar on the lower deck, and then began to wander about the steamer, choosing especially the walk that ran between the outside staterooms and the side railing. As he stood beside the railing a stout man looking like a prosperous merchant came out of his stateroom, and locked the door behind him. Then he passed through the nearest passage way into the saloon. \"He looks as if he might carry something of value,\" thought Kirby. \"I\u0027ll venture to examine.\" Waiting till the coast was clear he produced a pass key, of which he had managed to gain possession, and inserted it in the lock of stateroom No. 157, as we will venture to designate it. The door opened, and Kirby entered the room. He drew a match from his pocket, and lighting it looked swiftly and searchingly about him. There was a small hand-bag on the lower berth. \"I\u0027d take the bag if I dared, but it is too large to put in my pocket,\" thought Kirby. \"Perhaps I can open it.\" He drew from his pocket a bunch of keys of various sizes, and tried one after another. The fourth proved to fit. The bag, when opened, displayed a variety of contents in which Kirby was not interested. But one article attracted his attention. This was a square pasteboard box with the name of Tiffany upon it. \"I\u0027ll take that at a venture,\" soliloquized Kirby. \"Since it bears Tiffany\u0027s name the contents must be of124 value. I won\u0027t stay any longer, for it might prove dangerous.\" He relocked the bag, opened the door of the stateroom, and locking it again securely prepared to leave the spot. He was only just in time, for the occupant of the stateroom appeared a minute later, accompanied by a younger man. \"Yes,\" Kirby heard him say. \"I bought a watch for my daughter from Tiffany. I\u0027ll show it to you.\" \"A narrow escape!\" murmured Kirby. \"If he had found me in his stateroom, there would have been no end of a disturbance. I got through just in time.\" Kirby went into the saloon, and taking out an evening paper began to read it attentively, or rather he appeared to, but out of the corner of his eyes he was watching for the return of the gentleman he had robbed. He did not have long to wait. The two gentlemen came into the saloon, and one, the elder, seemed much excited. \"I tell you, Johnson,\" he said, \"there are thieves on board. I left the watch in a pasteboard box in my hand bag less than half an hour since—indeed I think it is only fifteen minutes, and it has disappeared.\" \"Are you absolutely sure, Mr. Margrave?\" \"Yes, for when I went to my stateroom, after coming up from the supper room, I opened the bag and saw that the box was there.\" 125 \"And now it is gone?\" \"Yes, you saw that yourself.\" \"But I don\u0027t see how, in the short time you were absent, any one could have got in and effected the robbery.\" \"Nor do I, but it was done.\" \"What shall you do about it?\" \"Notify the officers of the boat, but I fear that won\u0027t do any good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81484.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
