{"id":13482,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. MR. KIRBY WRITES A LETTER FOR EFFECT.","content":"Any lingering doubts Dean might have were of course dissipated by the sight of the watch. It was evident that his employer was a professional thief and pickpocket. The question arose, ought he or ought he not to expose and denounce him? Should he do so he would find himself adrift, without money or situation. Moreover, he would lose the chance of proving Kirby the accomplice of Squire Bates in the robbery of his uncle. On the whole, he decided to wait, and conceal from Kirby the knowledge that he had acquired concerning him. Kirby remained but a day in Boston. What business he attended to Dean didn\u0027t know. He was left to his own devices, and managed to see Boston Common, Bunker Hill Monument, and to ride out on a Washington Street line of cars to Roxbury. Late in the evening he started for Chicago with Mr. Kirby, and two days later the two registered at the Commercial Hotel, corner of Lake and Dearborn Streets. Dean enjoyed the journey. He caught sight of the134 famous falls of Niagara, and would like to have stopped for a few hours there to see the cataract at his leisure, but of course didn\u0027t venture to make such a request of Mr. Kirby, who, as he knew, was traveling for his own purposes, not for the gratification of his private secretary. They reached Chicago in the morning and took breakfast at the hotel. After breakfast Kirby said, \"Come out with me, Dean; I will show you a little of the city.\" Dean accepted the invitation with alacrity. The two walked through some of the principal thoroughfares. Dean was impressed by the large and handsome buildings everywhere to be seen in the business portions of the city. Finally they turned into a minor street, lined with smaller and less pretentious structures. Peter Kirby halted at last before a pawnbroker\u0027s office, with the three golden balls displayed above the entrance. \"Oh, by the way, Dean,\" said Kirby, suddenly, \"I am a little short of money, and must borrow some on an article I don\u0027t need at present.\" \"Yes, sir?\" said Dean, inquiringly. \"This is a pawnbroker\u0027s office. Take this watch, and ask the pawnbroker to lend you twenty-five dollars on it. You can give him your own name, and for address you may say Buffalo.\" \"But I don\u0027t live in Buffalo.\" \"That doesn\u0027t matter. He will be more apt to let you have the money if he thinks you came from a135 distance. It isn\u0027t necessary to give the correct address.\" Mr. Kirby drew from his pocket the gold watch which Dean had seen in the stateroom of the Pilgrim, and which he was sure had been stolen from the elderly gentleman who had complained of being robbed. Dean started and flushed, as Kirby held the watch in his hand. \"Is that your watch?\" he asked. \"No; it belongs to my wife. I shall redeem it before I return East. If the pawnbroker won\u0027t give you twenty-five dollars, get as much as you can. You look like a boy sharp at a bargain. Say that it belonged to your uncle.\" \"Mr. Kirby,\" said Dean, \"I would rather not do what you ask me.\" \"What do you mean?\" demanded Kirby, angrily. \"What I say. I would rather not pawn that watch for you.\" \"Look here, boy,\" said Kirby, roughly, \"are you aware that you are behaving in a very foolish, not to say impudent manner?\" \"I have my reasons for declining,\" said Dean. \"Why do you think I pay you wages?\" asked Kirby, frowning. \"I understood that I was to be your private secretary.\" \"And a mighty easy place you have had so far!\" \"That is true, sir.\" \"This is almost the first thing I have asked you to do, and you refuse.\" 136 \"I told you that I had my reasons for it,\" said Dean, resolutely, though his look was troubled. \"The boy suspects me,\" thought Kirby. \"It is time I got rid of him.\" \"We will discuss this matter hereafter,\" he said quietly. \"We shall have to come to an understanding. Stay here till I come out.\" He went into the pawnbroker\u0027s, and in less than five minutes returned with a roll of bills. \"It appears that I have to do my own work, though you are in my employ,\" he said with a sneer. Dean didn\u0027t reply. He began to suspect that he would not long retain the place which he at present filled. He resolved to look about him, and if he saw anywhere a chance to get into the employ of some one else to take advantage of it. In a money way he might not do so well, but he did not wish to remain connected any longer than he could help with a man of Mr. Kirby\u0027s character. At the Commercial Hotel, Dean and his employer occupied the same room. They remained in the Lake City for a week. Dean\u0027s labors were very light, being confined to the writing of four letters, one of which is subjoined as a specimen. It was addressed to a certain John Carver, of San Francisco. It ran thus: Dear Sir: You may sell out the two hundred shares of mining stock which you hold of mine as soon as a satisfactory price can be obtained. I think I ought to get137 twenty dollars per share, but will accept eighteen if you think it best. The amount you can deposit to my credit in the Bank of Nevada. Yours truly,????? Peter Kirby. Kirby watched Dean\u0027s face when he was writing this letter. It was intended for effect simply, and to dispel the suspicions of his young secretary. But Dean had been gaining rapidly in knowledge of the world, and especially in the knowledge of his employer, and he had little belief in his mining property. \"How much do you think that mining stock cost me, Dean?\" said Kirby, in a confidential tone. \"I couldn\u0027t guess, sir.\" \"Four dollars and a quarter per share. How much would that be on two hundred shares?\" \"Eight hundred and fifty dollars.\" \"Correct! I see you are quick at figures. Now, even if I sell at eighteen, and I am certain to get that, I shall make a very tidy profit. Let me see, it would foot up thirty-six hundred dollars—a profit of twenty seven hundred, allowing the extra fifty for broker\u0027s commission.\" \"Are you going to San Francisco, Mr. Kirby?\" asked Dean. \"I may; I am not quite sure. It is a lucky city for me. Whenever I go there I make money.\" Dean could not help wondering whether he made it in the same way as on the Fall River boat. 138 \"I have been rather short of money lately,\" continued Mr. Kirby, \"because I was not willing to sell out my shares except at the top of the market. However I think I may venture to sell now.\" Dean made no comment He did not believe that Kirby owned any mining shares at all. \"Shall I mail the letter for you, Mr. Kirby?\" asked the young secretary. \"No; I shall be going out myself,\" answered his employer. \"You may hand me the letter when you have put it in the envelope.\" Kirby carelessly dropped the letter into his pocket, and when Dean was out of the way he destroyed it. It was never intended to be mailed. \"The boy looks skeptical,\" said Kirby to himself, as he sent Dean to the office to buy a postage stamp. \"It isn\u0027t easy to pull the wool over his eyes. I must get rid of him, and that soon.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81486.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
