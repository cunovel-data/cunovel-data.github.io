{"id":13466,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. TOMMY BOYLE IS RESCUED.","content":"\"Who is that?\" asked Dean, quickly. \"It is Tommy Boyle.\" \"How did he get there?\" \"I carried him in my boat.\" \"And left him there?\" \"Yes,\" answered Brandon, with an amused laugh. \"Didn\u0027t he want to come back?\" \"Of course he did. He\u0027s awfully frightened to be left there alone. I told him he would make a good Robinson Crusoe, but the little beggar never heard of him.\" \"Why did you do such a mean thing, Brandon Bates?\" demanded Dean. \"That\u0027s my business, Dean Dunham,\" answered Brandon, in an offended tone. \"Then I\u0027ll make it my business,\" said Dean, sternly. \"Get right into your boat and go after Tommy.\" \"Why, you impudent beggar!\" exclaimed Brandon, almost foaming at the mouth with rage, \"how dare you say that to me?\" \"There\u0027s no courage needed,\" said Dean, dryly. \"Are you going to do as I ask you?\" 26 \"No, I\u0027m not,\" said Brandon, shortly. \"Be off with you, if you know what\u0027s best for yourself, or I may take it into my head to thrash you.\" \"I am ready—any time, except now. I have something else to do.\" Brandon Bates was standing with the boat rope in his hands, preparing to draw it into the boat-house. He was by no means prepared for what was coming. Dean with a quick movement snatched the rope from him, jumped into the boat, seized the oars, and before the owner had recovered from his astonishment, was two lengths away, rowing in the direction of the island. \"Come back here, you rascal!\" exclaimed Brandon, almost purple with rage, and stamping in his fury. \"I have no time,\" answered Dean, coolly. \"What do you mean by stealing my boat?\" \"Your boat is safe, I have only borrowed it.\" \"I never saw such impudence! I will have you arrested!\" \"Do so if you want to. I am going to rescue the poor little fellow you have left on the island.\" \"Then take your own boat.\" \"Tommy went over on your boat, and he\u0027s going back on the same.\" Brandon called out again, but Dean was now too far away to hear him. The temper of Brandon Bates was not the sweetest, but it is doubtful whether he had ever been more angry than at the present moment. He felt that his27 dignity had been outraged, and himself insulted, and that, too, by a working boy. \"I\u0027d like to shoot him!\" he vociferated, shaking his fist in impotent rage at the rapidly-receding boat. Tommy meanwhile had seen what was going on, the distance being inconsiderable. As soon as he saw that his situation was known to Dean, the little fellow\u0027s excitement and alarm subsided. \"Dean will come for me, and take me home,\" he said to himself. When he saw Dean\u0027s bold seizure of the boat, he clapped his hands in joy. \"Dean\u0027s a good deal better boy than Brandon,\" he said. He rose from his place, and stood watching eagerly for the coming of his deliverer. \"Hallo, Tommy!\" called out Dean, when he was within hearing distance. \"Hallo, Dean!\" \"Were you very much frightened?\" \"Yes; I thought I\u0027d have to stay here all night.\" Swiftly the boat sped through the water till it grazed the pebbly shore. \"Jump in, Tommy!\" Tommy needed no second bidding. \"Oh, Dean, I\u0027m so glad you came for me.\" \"And I\u0027m glad I saw you. What made Brandon play such a trick on you?\" \"I don\u0027t know. When I begged him to take me back he only laughed.\" \"He doesn\u0027t look much like laughing now,\" said28 Dean, smiling, as he saw Brandon still standing at the boat wharf, shaking his fist angrily. \"I hope he won\u0027t fight you, Dean,\" said Tommy, rather troubled. \"He may if he wants to. I think he will get the worst of it.\" Meanwhile Brandon caught sight of the village constable, walking along the road a few rods from the shore of the pond. He ran to the road and intercepted him. \"Mr. Pray,\" he said. \"Well, Brandon?\" \"I want you to arrest Dean Dunham.\" \"What am I to arrest Dean Dunham for?\" asked the constable in surprise. \"He took my boat from me by force, like an impudent young loafer as he is, and is out in the boat rowing.\" \"Yes, I see him. Tommy Boyle is with him. How does that happen?\" \"He went over to the island and took him off.\" \"I don\u0027t understand. How came Tommy on the island?\" \"I took him there.\" \"You took him there? Did he want to stay?\" \"No, I left him there—as a joke.\" \"You left the poor little boy there to get off as he could!\" said the constable, indignantly. \"It didn\u0027t do him any harm,\" said Brandon, sullenly. \"There are no wild animals there that I ever heard,\" he added sarcastically. 29 \"And Dean Dunham took your boat to go after him?\" \"Yes, he did. He took it away from me without asking my permission.\" \"He did perfectly right. Would you have had him leave poor Tommy there?\" \"Why didn\u0027t he take his own boat, then?\" said Brandon in a sullen tone. \"Because he didn\u0027t want to leave Tommy there any longer than was necessary. He has only done what you ought to have done.\" \"He had no business to steal my boat. I want him arrested.\" \"I am more likely to arrest you for kidnapping the boy.\" \"You don\u0027t seem to know who I am, Mr. Pray,\" said Brandon angrily. \"Oh yes, I do. You are Brandon Bates, but you are not so important a person as you suppose.\" \"If I am not, my father is, and he\u0027ll have you turned out of your office.\" He expected the constable to show dismay at this threat, but Mr. Pray, who was very independent, only laughed. \"All right,\" he answered. \"I am glad you let me know what\u0027s going to happen. I\u0027ll see what else I can find to do. How soon do you think I shall lose my place?\" Brandon turned from the constable in disgust. Everybody seemed to be in a conspiracy to insult him. 30 Dean was now very near shore, and Brandon\u0027s attention was called elsewhere. The constable remained, a little curious to witness the interview between the two boys. Perhaps because he could not find words to express his feelings, Brandon did not say a word while Dean was landing his young passenger. As he jumped out himself he held out the rope to the angry owner. \"I have brought back your boat safe,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll pay for this, Dean Dunham,\" said Brandon, as he took the rope with a red face. \"Can I help you put the boat into the boat-house?\" asked Dean calmly. \"I want none of your help. Never dare to touch my boat again!\" \"Then don\u0027t play any more such dirty tricks on my friend Tommy! Tommy, I wouldn\u0027t advise you to go out rowing with Brandon again.\" \"I won\u0027t,\" said Tommy, fervently. \"You won\u0027t get a chance, you dirty little brat!\" snarled Brandon. \"Come away, Tommy. When you want a boat ride come to me. I\u0027ll give you a ride any time.\" \"It\u0027s a great privilege riding in your old scow,\" sneered Brandon. \"I don\u0027t think much of the boat myself,\" said Dean, smiling. \"I\u0027ve seen those I liked better.\" Dean went home, and attended to various chores. About four o\u0027clock that afternoon Mrs. Dunham began to look for her husband. \"It\u0027s time your Uncle Adin was at home,\" she31 said. \"I suppose his business kept him longer than he expected.\" Just then Mr. Gould entered the yard. He looked excited and anxious. \"Dean,\" he said, \"something\u0027s happened to your uncle. My horse just ran into my yard with the empty buggy.\" Dean turned pale. \"What shall we do? he asked. \"Come with me. We\u0027ll go back over the road, and see if we can find him. Not a word to your aunt! We don\u0027t want to make her anxious.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81470.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
