{"id":13476,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. DEAN IS ENGAGED AS PRIVATE SECRETARY.","content":"\"Brandon,\" said his father, \"I would like to have you call at Adin Dunham\u0027s with a note.\" Brandon frowned. He did not fancy being employed as an errand boy. \"Can\u0027t you get somebody else?\" he asked. \"I wouldn\u0027t mind going to any other place, but I don\u0027t like to go there on an errand.\" \"Perhaps that will overcome your objections,\" said his father, producing a silver dollar. \"Thank you, papa, I\u0027ll go,\" said Brandon with alacrity, for he was always in want of money. \"Who is the note for?\" \"For the boy—Dean.\" \"Oh!\" Brandon\u0027s face changed. \"Seems to me Dean Dunham is getting to be a person of a good deal of importance,\" he said. \"What is the note about? If you are going to haul him over the coals I won\u0027t mind taking it.\" \"On the contrary, Mr. Kirby, our guest, is going to offer him a position as his clerk and private secretary.\" \"And did you recommend him to Mr. Kirby?\" asked Brandon, considerably disgusted. 93 Squire Bates was sharp enough to understand the cause of Brandon\u0027s dissatisfaction. \"I don\u0027t mind telling you confidentially,\" he said with a smile, \"that I don\u0027t envy the boy who works for Peter Kirby.\" \"Then it isn\u0027t such a great chance after all?\" \"I suspect that Dean will be sorry he engaged to work for him within a week. But of course you won\u0027t let drop a word to prejudice the boy against accepting Mr. Kirby\u0027s offer.\" \"You may rely upon me, papa,\" said Brandon with a chuckle. Dean was reading aloud to his uncle when there was a knock at the door, which was answered by Mrs. Dunham. \"Brandon Bates!\" she said in surprise. \"Yes, Mrs. Dunham. Is Dean at home?\" \"Won\u0027t you come in? Yes, he\u0027s at home.\" \"I won\u0027t stop. I should like to see him a minute.\" \"Dean, here\u0027s Brandon Bates wants to see you a minute,\" said his aunt. Dean shared in Mrs. Dunham\u0027s surprise. He laid down the paper from which he was reading, and went to the door. \"Good-evening, Brandon!\" he said politely, \"do you wish to see me?\" \"Yes. I\u0027ve got a note for you. I happened to be coming this way, and I told my father I\u0027d take it,\" continued Brandon, anxious to have it understood that he was not specially sent to the cottage. 94 \"Thank you, Brandon. Won\u0027t you come in while I am reading it?\" \"No, but I\u0027ll wait. I think it\u0027s short.\" Dean tore open the envelope, and read as follows in the handwriting of Squire Bates: \"Dean Dunham: \"I understand from my son Brandon that you are seeking employment, and have no objection to leave home. A gentleman at present visiting me is in want of a clerk and secretary, and he would like to have an interview with you. As he leaves town to-morrow, I send for you this evening. \"Renwick Bates.\" Dean felt that nothing would suit him better. He felt grateful to Squire Bates for what he regarded as a piece of unexpected kindness. \"Your father is very kind, Brandon,\" he said as he folded up the note. \"He offers me a position with a friend of his.\" \"He just mentioned the matter to me,\" Brandon said indifferently. \"I wonder if the gentleman is one to whom I showed the way to your father\u0027s house this afternoon?\" \"Like as not. I don\u0027t know him; I never saw him before.\" \"Then you don\u0027t know whether he lives far from here or not?\" \"No.\" 95 \"I wonder whether I shall suit him,\" queried Dean anxiously. \"My father seems to think you will,\" answered Brandon. \"Of course I don\u0027t know anything about it.\" \"I will try to suit him at any rate,\" said Dean earnestly. \"Do you think your uncle will let you go?\" \"Yes, it is a fair chance. I\u0027ve talked over the matter with him and he sees that there isn\u0027t anything for me to do in Waterford, and that I shall have to leave town to get a place that is worth having.\" \"I shall envy you for one thing,\" said Brandon. \"What is that?\" \"Because you will be leaving Waterford.\" \"It is a pretty village.\" \"I am sick and tired of it. There is nothing going on here. I don\u0027t see why a gentleman of my father\u0027s wealth should bury himself in such a one-horse place.\" \"It isn\u0027t very lively,\" Dean admitted. \"I should say not. Why even the circus doesn\u0027t come any nearer than ten miles. I shall tease papa to go to New York to live. I should like to live on Madison or Fifth Avenue.\" Dean knew very little about either of the avenues referred to, though he had heard of them as tenanted by rich families. He rather congratulated himself that Brandon had not sought the place which was to be offered to him. By this time they had reached the home of Squire Bates, and Dean followed Brandon into the house.96 He soon found himself in the presence of the squire and of Peter Kirby. \"Good-evening, Dean,\" said the squire pleasantly. \"This is my friend, Mr. Kirby. \"I have seen the young man before,\" said Kirby, opening his mouth in what he tried to make a pleasant smile. \"Yes, sir. I remember you.\" Looking at Kirby as his future employer, Dean was not prepossessed in his favor. He was certainly far from an agreeable looking man, but Dean was disposed to judge him without prejudice. He knew that a fair outside sometimes accompanies very undesirable traits, and the reverse might also be the case. \"If you read my note, you understand that Mr. Kirby is in want of a young man, or boy, to assist him in the capacity of clerk or private secretary,\" the squire put in. \"I hope I may suit you, sir,\" said Dean earnestly, addressing himself to Peter Kirby. \"Oh, I am not very hard to suit. If a boy does his duty, and studies my interests, he won\u0027t find me a hard master.\" \"I think I can promise that I will serve you faithfully, sir.\" \"Is your uncle willing to have you leave home?\" asked the squire. Dean made the same answer as he had done to Brandon. \"Then there will be no difficulty there.\" \"How soon would you like to have me begin,97 sir; that is, if you are willing to engage me?\" \"Well, you can report at French\u0027s Hotel on Saturday—day after to-morrow. I suppose you can find your way to New York alone?\" \"Oh, yes, sir. I have never been there, but I am sure I shall have no difficulty.\" \"I will give the boy the necessary directions, Kirby,\" said Squire Bates. \"He has a tongue in his head, and can ask questions.\" \"What salary do you expect, Master Dunham?\" asked Kirby. \"I will leave that to you, sir.\" \"I am willing to pay a fair salary, say twenty-five dollars a month and your board and lodging thrown in. Will that be satisfactory?\" \"It is more than I anticipated,\" said Dean, quite dazzled by the offer. He reckoned that he would be able to send some money home to his uncle and aunt every month—and thus have the pleasure of making up to some extent for the expense which they had incurred on his account. \"Then that matter is settled. Here is a card with my address on it. You will find me at French\u0027s Hotel at one o\u0027clock in the day. If anything occurs to detain me, you can wait in the office till I return. My friend Bates here will supply money for your journey.\" Dean understood that there was nothing more to be said, and he rose and took his leave. He went home in a fever of excitement, for he felt that he was about to enter the great world of which he had heard so much, and which he so earnestly longed to see. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81480.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
