{"id":13487,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.","content":"Mr. Gunnison had several children, including one boy of about Dean\u0027s age, who was disposed at first to regard our hero with distant respect as a professional star, but soon became intimate with him on finding that Dean had the same tastes as himself. This appeared to surprise him. \"I say,\" he remarked, \"I thought you wouldn\u0027t have anything to say to a fellow like me.\" \"Why not?\" asked Dean, innocently. \"Oh, because you\u0027re a big gun.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"You give concerts, and have your name in the papers.\" \"Oh!\" said Dean smiling, \"I have to do that for a living, you know. I\u0027m only a boy after all.\" \"And do you like to play baseball?\" \"I only wish I had a chance.\" \"Do you?\" said Gus Gunnison, brightening up.170 \"Well, our club is going to play the Resolutes from the next town this afternoon. We are one man short. Will you take his place?\" \"Yes, I shall be glad to.\" \"What place do you prefer?\" \"I\u0027ll take any you choose to give me.\" \"Can you catch?\" \"I like it better than anything else.\" \"Then that\u0027s settled. Come over and I\u0027ll show you the ground, and introduce you to some of the fellows.\" When the members of the Carterville club learned that the famous young musician, Dean Dunham, had agreed to play on their side, they were very much elated. There was, however, a slight uneasiness lest he should not prove a skillful player, as they were eager to beat their visitors. A little practice playing, however, showed them that Dean was quite equal to any one in their club, and they became eager for the fray. Dean did not disappoint them. He entered into the game with enthusiasm, and played with unusual skill, so that the Resolutes were beaten by a score of 18 to 8, and the victory was largely attributed to the good playing of the new catcher, who proved equally good in batting. 171 The members of the club came up and tendered their thanks to Dean. \"If you can play on the harmonica as well as you can play ball,\" said Gus Gunnison, \"you\u0027ll do. Our club will attend the entertainment in a body, and hear you.\" \"I hope you won\u0027t be disappointed,\" said Dean smiling. Evening came, and Dean was called upon to play at four different points in the entertainment. On the front seats just facing him were the members of the Active Baseball Club. Dean nodded to them from the platform, and they felt proud of such a public recognition. Dean was stimulated to do his best, as he did not wish his new friends to be disappointed. During the day he practiced \"Home, Sweet Home\" with variations, partly original, partly remembered from a performance to which he had listened at a public entertainment a year or two previous. His efforts were crowned with success. The applause, led by the members of the Active club, was tumultuous, and Dean was compelled to repeat his performance. He did so, but towards the close he nearly broke down in consequence of a surprising discovery that he made. In looking round the audience, not far from the center aisle his glance chanced to fall upon172 a face which he had the best cause to remember. It was no other than Mr. Peter Kirby, whose presence will be afterwards explained. Mr. Kirby on his part was even more amazed to find the country boy whom he had left to his own resources emerging in such a conspicuous manner into public notice. He had thought of Dean as wandering about the country a forlorn and penniless tramp, begging for charity. How on earth he had managed to achieve the position of a musical star performer he could not imagine. \"That boy is getting dangerous,\" thought he. \"If the captain knew of his success he would feel very nervous.\" Mr. Kirby was in Carterville as the guest of Dr. Sidney Thorp, a wealthy gentleman, into whose good graces he had ingratiated himself at a hotel where they chanced to meet. He had accepted Dr. Thorp\u0027s invitation to spend a couple of days at his house, with the intention of robbing his hospitable entertainer if he should have the opportunity. \"A remarkable young performer!\" said Dr. Thorp, as Dean closed his playing. \"Yes,\" assented Kirby absently. \"How does he happen to be here?\" \"He had been giving an entertainment in a town near by, in connection with a variety actor. Our173 committee, finding that he gave satisfaction, invited him to play here this evening.\" \"Do you pay him anything?\" \"Certainly,\" answered Dr. Thorp, with surprise. \"We couldn\u0027t expect to obtain a performer of so much talent gratuitously.\" Kirby opened his eyes in surprise at hearing his quondam secretary spoken of in such terms. \"Do you know how much he is to be paid?\" \"I believe he agreed to come for five dollars, considering that the entertainment was for a charitable purpose.\" Kirby could scarcely refrain from whistling, so great was his surprise. He recognized Dean some time before his former secretary\u0027s glance fell upon him. Dean\u0027s start showed that the recognition was mutual. \"I am going to speak to this boy—Dean Dunham,\" said he to Dr. Thorp, when the entertainment was at an end. \"Mr. Gunnison will introduce you. Shall I ask him?\" \"I need no introduction. The boy and I have met.\" Dean was standing on the platform watching the departing audience, when he saw Mr. Kirby approaching. He felt a little nervous, not knowing174 what the intentions of his old employer might be. Kirby paused a moment, and a peculiar smile overspread his countenance. \"I presume you remember me?\" he said. \"Yes,\" answered Dean, coldly. \"I am rather surprised to meet you again under such circumstances.\" \"I am rather surprised myself—at the circumstances.\" \"You have become quite a star!\" said Kirby with a sneer. Dean answered gravely, \"I had to make a living in some way. It was an accident, my trying this way.\" \"Would you like to return to me—as my secretary?\" \"Thank you, Mr. Kirby, I prefer to travel independently.\" \"Suppose I should tell why I discharged you? That might prove inconvenient to you.\" \"Then I should have a story to tell that might prove inconvenient to you, Mr. Kirby.\" Dean looked Kirby straight in the face, and the latter saw that he no longer had an inexperienced country boy to deal with, but one who might prove dangerous to his plans. 175 \"On the whole,\" he said, after a pause, \"suppose we both keep silence as to the past.\" \"I will do so, unless I should have occasion to speak.\" No one was near enough to listen to this conversation. Now Dr. Thorp came up, and Kirby said with an abrupt turn of the conversation, \"I am glad to have met you again, my young friend. I wish you success.\" Dean bowed gravely, but didn\u0027t speak. He was not prepared to wish success to Peter Kirby, knowing what he did of him. During the evening Dr. Thorp called at the house of Mr. Gunnison, but unaccompanied by his guest. Dean had heard meanwhile at whose house Kirby was staying, and he felt that he ought to drop a hint that would put the unsuspecting host on his guard. He finally decided that it was his duty to do so. \"May I speak with you a moment in private, Dr. Thorp?\" he asked, as the guest arose to go. \"Certainly,\" answered the doctor, in some surprise. Dean accompanied him into the hall. \"Do you know much of the gentleman who is staying at your house?\" asked Dean. \"No; why do you ask?\" 176 \"Because I have reason to think that he is a professional thief.\" \"Good Heavens! What do you mean!\" Dean briefly recounted the robberies of which he was himself cognizant, adding that he gave this information in strict confidence. \"I thought I ought to put you on your guard,\" he concluded. \"Thank you, Mr. Dunham,\" said Dr. Thorp, warmly. \"You have done me a great service. I happen to have a considerable sum in money and bonds at my house. I shall look out for Mr. Kirby,\" he added, with a grim nod. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81491.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
