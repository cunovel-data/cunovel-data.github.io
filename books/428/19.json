{"id":13481,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. DEAN BECOMES SUSPICIOUS.","content":"Of course great excitement followed among the passengers. The two gentlemen went below, and soon returned with a quiet-looking man, not particularly noticeable except for a pair of keen, sharp eyes. \"That\u0027s the detective,\" whispered a traveling man whose business required him to make the journey between New York and Boston twice a week. The two gentlemen and the detective went outside, and made an examination of the stateroom, but didn\u0027t find any traces of the lost watch. \"I\u0027d like to be sure the article is really lost,\" said the detective. \"On several occasions I have found that it was only mislaid. In the present instance there seems really to have been a robbery.\" \"There is no doubt of that,\" said Margrave ruefully. \"Did you notice any one loitering near the stateroom when you left it?\" \"Yes, sir; I observed that a man was leaning over the rail.\" 127 \"Ha! we are coming to something. Can you describe him?\" \"I am afraid I cannot. You see I had no suspicion that any one was likely to rob me.\" \"Very natural, but rather disappointing! You didn\u0027t casually notice whether the man was short or tall, or how he was dressed?\" \"I think he was tall, and dressed in dark clothing.\" \"I fear this is too general to afford much satisfaction. You see most of the men on board wear dark clothes.\" \"I see, Mr. Lynx, that I am not likely to recover the watch.\" \"Well, it is doubtful. Still, if you will give me a description of it I can quietly put it into the hands of the Boston police.\" Mr. Margrave, at the suggestion of the detective, wrote out a description before he left the boat, and put it into his hands. \"I will keep my eyes open, Mr. Margrave,\" continued the detective, \"and notice whether I recognize any professional thief among the passengers. I know many of those who operate in New York and Boston, and if I meet one of my old acquaintances shall take the liberty of examining him.\" Fortunately for Peter Kirby the scene of his operations had been at the West, and though the detective regarded him with some suspicion, for criminals carry about with them a certain tell-tale look, he did not feel justified in arresting him. If Margrave had128 been able to identify him as the man who had been loitering near the stateroom, of course that would have simplified matters. It was not for some time that Dean heard what had happened. On re-entering the saloon, Dan, the young news agent, said to him: \"Where have you been?\" \"Outside.\" \"Very suspicious. A gentleman occupying an outside stateroom has had his room entered and robbed.\" \"Is that true?\" asked Dean in excitement. \"Yes, he made a great fuss about it I saw him going out with the boat detective, but I don\u0027t think they found out anything.\" Instantly Dean\u0027s mind reverted to the scene at the theater, and the loss of a pocket-book by one of the patrons of Niblo\u0027s. Was it possible that Mr. Kirby could be connected with both robberies? It really seemed that thefts took place wherever he went. \"What was taken?\" he asked earnestly. \"A gold watch. The gentleman meant it for his daughter. I think it was bought at Tiffany\u0027s in New York.\" \"I was at a theater last evening,\" said Dean, \"and as we were coming out a man ahead of us called out that he had been robbed of his pocket-book.\" \"Who do you mean by us—yourself and your employer?\" \"No. A boy was with me—Guy Gladstone.\" 129 \"Is he with you here?\" \"No, he has gone out West to hunt Indians.\" Dan, the news-agent, laughed. \"He\u0027ll be coming back soon without having seen an Indian, I have no doubt. I say, Dean, isn\u0027t it rather remarkable that there are robberies wherever you go?\" \"Yes, it is singular,\" said Dean in a musing tone. \"It really looks suspicious,\" continued Dan. \"However, you are my friend and I won\u0027t give you away.\" \"No, don\u0027t!\" said Dean, accepting the joke in good humor. Dean walked away, plunged in thought. Again he went outside, and walked round to an unfrequented part of the steamer. Suddenly he saw a man in front of him draw something from his pocket, and with a quick movement throw it far out upon the water. It was light enough to see that it was a white pasteboard box of small size. Rather surprised, Dean scanned the person who had done this, and to his further astonishment recognized him as Mr. Kirby, his employer. Turning quickly, Peter Kirby in his turn saw Dean\u0027s eyes fixed upon him, and he became irritated and alarmed. \"What are you out here for?\" he demanded harshly. \"Why, is there any harm in being out here?\" asked Dean surprised. 130 Kirby saw that he had made a false move, and that this unreasonable taking to task of Dean was likely to excite the boy\u0027s suspicions. \"No,\" he answered, calming down, \"I don\u0027t know that there is any harm in being out here, but you might be imprudent and endanger your safety.\" \"How, Mr. Kirby?\" \"I was once on board a steamer like this, when a boy about your age came out, got up on the rail, and by a sudden movement of the steamer was thrown into the water. The poor fellow was drowned.\" \"I shan\u0027t imitate his example,\" said Dean. \"I think he was very foolish.\" \"Well, I haven\u0027t found out yet whether you are prudent or imprudent. I haven\u0027t known you long enough. I thought it best to warn you, however.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"I am going into the saloon, but if you care to remain outside I have no objection as long as you are careful. I feel a certain responsibility about you, as you are not used to traveling.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" Dean would have been more grateful if he had believed what Mr. Kirby was saying, but, young and inexperienced though he was, he did not take much stock in the sudden interest shown in him. He had not noticed that Mr. Kirby felt any particular solicitude about him in New York, though there were plenty of scrapes that he might have got into there. Peter Kirby went back into the saloon, and soon131 after Dean followed. He again sought the book table. \"Well,\" said Dan, pleasantly, \"have you found out the robber?\" Dean shook his head. \"Do you know, or did you hear, whether the stolen watch was in a box?\" he asked. \"Yes, I heard Mr. Margrave say that it was in a white pasteboard box. Have you found the box?\" \"No,\" answered Dean. He did not feel at liberty to tell what he had seen, but it confirmed him in the idea that his employer, Peter Kirby, was the robber of the stateroom. At ten o\u0027clock Mr. Kirby came up to him. \"It is ten o\u0027clock,\" he said. \"I think you had better go to bed.\" \"All right, sir.\" Kirby led the way into the stateroom. \"I shall give you the top berth,\" he said. \"You are younger, and can climb up there more easily than I.\" \"I shall be satisfied with either,\" said Dean. Both went to bed and Dean was soon asleep. Towards morning he thought it must be when he woke up. The light was burning, and peeping out from behind the curtains he saw that Kirby was standing in the stateroom with something in his hand which he was examining with evident satisfaction. Dean\u0027s heart gave a sudden bound, when he recognized this object as a beautiful gold watch of small pattern. He laid back his head on the pillow, but the132 slight noise attracted the attention of Kirby, who looked up to where his boy companion was lying. \"Pshaw! he\u0027s fast asleep!\" he heard Kirby mutter, \"but I must be cautious, as, if he saw this watch, he might suspect something.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81485.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
