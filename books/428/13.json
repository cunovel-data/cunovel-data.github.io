{"id":13475,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. PETER KIRBY.","content":"If Brandon had supposed the stranger would prove an unwelcome visitor to his father, he would have been undeceived if he could have been present at the interview between them. \"What, Kirby!\" said the squire, as the new arrival entered his study. \"Yes, it is I, captain,\" answered Peter Kirby, sinking into an arm-chair. \"You seem comfortably fixed here.\" \"Yes; I have tried to make myself comfortable.\" \"And I understand you go by the name of squire?\" \"How did you learn that?\" \"From a boy who guided me here.\" \"I hope you did not express any surprise.\" \"Oh, no! I did nothing to arouse suspicion. Are you a justice of the peace?\" \"Yes.\" \"And perhaps preside over trials?\" \"Well, yes, sometimes.\" \"Ha, ha!\" 86 \"What are you laughing at?\" demanded the squire irritably. \"It is a good joke. Suppose the good people here were acquainted with your real character?\" \"Hush; this is no time for jesting. You might be overheard. Now, what news?\" \"Well, there isn\u0027t much. Things have been pretty quiet. You haven\u0027t been at any of our meetings lately?\" \"No; I did not care to excite suspicion. I\u0027ve been engaged in a little enterprise on my own account.\" \"What, here?\" \"Yes.\" \"What was it?\" asked Kirby with interest. \"I learned that one of my neighbors—a simple minded carpenter—was to receive a considerable sum of money, which I had reason to think he would bring home in person. I disguised myself, lay in wait for him, and took the whole.\" \"How much was there?\" \"A thousand dollars!\" \"Excellent! And you have it here?\" \"Yes. It happened to be in fifty-dollar bills, and I have not dared to use any of it lest it should be traced to me. Besides, there is one who suspects me of having been implicated in the affair?\" \"Is it a person likely to prove dangerous?\" \"I don\u0027t know. It is a boy.\" \"A boy! How should a boy be likely to suspect you?\" 87 \"I will tell you. It is a nephew of the man who lost the money. Near the scene of the robbery he found a sleeve button marked with my initial, which I had the ill luck to drop.\" \"Does he know it is yours?\" \"Yes, my son recognized it in his possession, and unfortunately let out that it was mine. I at once sent for the boy, asked to see the button, and admitted it was mine.\" \"How then did you explain?\" \"I am coming to that. I told him that both buttons had been stolen from me, probably by a tramp who had been seen prowling round my house, and that I presumed the same man had robbed his uncle.\" \"Very ingenious, upon my word! You always were a man of ideas, captain. I suppose this allayed his suspicions.\" \"Not wholly, though it puzzled him. I must tell you that while I was relieving the uncle of his money, though otherwise disguised I unfortunately opened my mouth.\" \"And showed your teeth?\" \"Precisely. I have often had occasion to regret that Nature supplied me with such ugly looking tusks, for they are a dangerous means of identification. I understand the carpenter—one Adin Dunham—has spoken of this, but it seemed absurd to those who heard him that a man in my position should be a robber, and it was taken as a proof that he was out of his head. I strengthened this impression by taking88 a foremost part in raising a subscription for the carpenter to compensate him partially for his loss, and myself contributed fifty dollars.\" \"Out of the man\u0027s own money?\" asked Kirby laughing. \"No, I didn\u0027t venture to use one of the fifty dollars. I used other money which I had.\" \"Then you have the money by you still?\" \"Yes.\" Squire Bates rose from his seat, locked the door, and then opening a small cabinet drew out a roll of bills—which he counted before his visitor. \"See,\" he said, \"Here are twenty bills, amounting in all to a thousand dollars.\" Peter Kirby\u0027s eyes brightened covetously as he eyed this large sum of money. \"It was a good haul for one man to make, in a quiet place like this,\" he said. \"So I flatter myself,\" said Squire Bates complacently. \"But I can\u0027t help expressing my surprise at your burying yourself in such a small, out of the way place. If you were in one of our large cities, for instance, it would be much more convenient, and the rest of the band could communicate with you better.\" Squire Bates rose and paced the room thoughtfully. \"That is true,\" he said, after a pause, \"but you must remember also that I should stand a better chance of being recognized in a large and important place, where there is a well disciplined and efficient89 police force and an organized body of detectives. No one would think of looking for me in a small, unimportant village like Waterford, where I pass as the village lawyer, and have a commission as justice of the peace.\" \"How do you sustain the part of a lawyer?\" \"I have a few law books, and there was a time in earlier years—I think I was nineteen—when I passed six months in the office of a lawyer, where I picked up some of the rudiments of practical jurisprudence.\" \"Where was that?\" \"In a Western town, not far from Chicago. Here no very complicated matters come before me. I am perfectly competent to draft a will, to write out a deed, make out a lease, and so on—that is all that is required of me.\" \"You must find it very dull living here. I couldn\u0027t stand it.\" \"I must live somewhere, and you must remember that I have a wife and son who are entirely ignorant of my real character.\" \"They suppose you to be a lawyer?\" \"Yes.\" \"I saw your son outside. It was easy to recognize him as your son.\" \"Why?\" Peter Kirby touched his teeth with a significant gesture. \"He has your teeth,\" he said. \"They are a perfect facsimile.\" \"Yes,\" said the squire soberly. \"He too is cursed with this deformity.\" 90 \"Still, as teeth, I have no doubt they are strong and—durable.\" \"Yes, they will last me all my life. I have no excuse for having them extracted, and procuring an artificial set. Yet I want to do it, if I were not a coward as regards dentists. But, to come back to business. I shall hand you these bills, and ask you to exchange them for bills of other denominations. You can send them to me in an express package.\" \"There will be some risk about this, won\u0027t there, as it is known that the stolen money was in fifty-dollar bills?\" \"Not if you go far enough away. I shall want you to go to Chicago on other business which I will communicate to you. There you will have no difficulty in effecting the change.\" \"I suppose I am to have a commission?\" \"Yes; you can retain fifty dollars.\" \"That is small, captain,\" said Kirby, in a tone of discontent. \"It may be, but I have other work for you to do which will increase your remunerations.\" \"What sort of work?\" \"I have already told you of a boy in the village who suspects me of being implicated in the robbery.\" \"Yes.\" \"I mean you to take him with you.\" \"What, and to abduct him? That will be difficult and dangerous.\" \"No, you are to offer him lucrative employment, and he will go with you willingly. Then you are to91 get him into trouble, involve him in a crime perhaps, and he won\u0027t dare to come back. I learn from Brandon that he is anxious to obtain a position. However, I will give you detailed instructions how to proceed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81479.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
