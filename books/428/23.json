{"id":13485,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. DEAN\u0027S DEBUT.","content":"The next morning the Granville Weekly Palladium appeared, containing a flaming notice of the forthcoming entertainment, in which the merits of the two performers were extolled in the highest terms. Dean opened his eyes in amazement when he read the following tribute to himself: At immense expenses the service of DEAN DUNHAM the Champion Harmonica player of America have been secured. This young performer, still only a boy in years, will spend the next season in Europe, having been offered engagements in London, Paris and Vienna, and he is now playing a farewell series of engagements in his native land. Probably the citizens of Granville may never again have the opportunity of hearing him. 155 \"What do you say to that, Dean, my boy?\" asked Montgomery, nudging him in the side. \"It makes me feel foolish, Mr. Montgomery,\" said Dean, blushing. \"If it should be read in Waterford the people would never get through laughing at me.\" \"They won\u0027t read it, my boy, unless it turns out true.\" \"Turns out true?\" \"Yes. I believe you can win popularity by your playing. We can tell better this time to-morrow. If you do, how can we tell but the rest may also come true?\" \"If it were the violin or the banjo! But a little cheap harmonica!\" \"Never mind what the instrument is if you know how to handle it. Now let me tell you one thing that will encourage you: I think we are going to have a big house.\" \"What makes you think so?\" \"There hasn\u0027t been an entertainment in Granville for several weeks. The people are hungry to be amused. They patronize performances like ours much better in the West than at the East. There the people are more humdrum and steady going. Here they are more excitable. Now I am going to give you a hint. Take a walk out into the woods, or anywhere156 where you will be alone, and practice popular songs. I want you to make a sensation this evening.\" \"It seems ridiculous, my playing for money!\" \"How much money have you in your pocket?\" \"Five cents.\" \"Then it strikes me it would be more ridiculous not playing for money. Whatever talents we possess our Creator meant us to exercise for our benefit and the pleasure of the community.\" \"At any rate I\u0027ll do my best.\" \"Then you\u0027ll do all I ask. By the way, I am going to have you take the tickets this evening, up to the time of the performance. It will save money, and draw public attention.\" \"I can do that, at any rate.\" During the forenoon Dean went to a secluded place a mile from the village, and began to practice on the harmonica. He had a quick ear, and was really an excellent performer. He was unaware that he had an audience till a boy attracted his attention peeping from behind a tree at a little distance. Dean nodded and smiled, and the boy was encouraged to come forward. \"Are you Dean Dunham, the boy that\u0027s going to be at the concert?\" asked the young auditor, bashfully. 157 \"Yes.\" \"How long have you played?\" \"Four or five years.\" \"How old are you?\" \"Almost sixteen.\" \"What lots of money you must have made!\" Dean smiled. He thought it most prudent not to speak definitely on this point. He was rather curious to know what the boy thought of his playing. \"Can you play on the harmonica?\" he asked. \"Only a little. Of course I can\u0027t play like you.\" \"Do you like my playing, then?\" \"You play bully.\" Dean was gratified, not so much out of vanity, as because it encouraged him to think that others also might regard his performance with favor. \"I am glad you like it,\" he said. \"Are you going to the entertainment this evening?\" \"I should like to,\" said the boy, wistfully, \"but I don\u0027t have much money to spend. I have to work for a living.\" \"He little thinks that I am worse off than he,\" thought Dean. \"He has a home, while I am over a thousand miles from mine, and with only five cents in my pocket.\" \"It won\u0027t cost you anything to come in,\" he said158 in a friendly manner. \"I shall be at the door, and I will let you in free.\" \"Will you, really?\" queried the boy, overjoyed. \"Certainly I will. I shall remember your face. If I don\u0027t, just remind me of my promise.\" As a matter of business, Dean\u0027s offer of a free ticket proved a stroke of policy. The boy spread among his comrades a highly colored report of Dean\u0027s wonderful performance on the harmonica, and the result was a large attendance of young people in the evening. When Dean took his place at the door he found himself the object of many wondering and curious glances, and he was at first abashed; but finally, reminding himself that he was among strangers who were disposed to look upon him as a genius, he accommodated himself to the position, and applied himself assiduously to his duties. The hall in which the entertainment was to take place contained about four hundred people. When eight o\u0027clock struck it was packed, many having come from neighboring towns. The price of admission was thirty-five cents for adults, and twenty-five for children. It was clear, therefore, that the receipts must be considerably over a hundred dollars. The rent of the hall being but ten dollars, this allowed a large margin for profit. 159 Punctually at eight o\u0027clock the entertainment commenced with a brief introductory speech from Mr. Montgomery. \"Gentlemen and ladies,\" he said, \"it has long been the desire of Mr. Dunham and myself to appear in your beautiful village, and at length our wishes are to be gratified. We shall do our utmost to please you, and if we fail, think that it is our ability and not our will that is lacking. I will commence with a humorous recitation, in the character of an old darky.\" He disappeared behind the screen, and emerged in a very short time disguised as a Southern negro. This impersonation hit the popular taste. It was followed by a song, and then Mr. Montgomery introduced Dean in a highly flattering manner. Dean appeared with a flushed face, and a momentary feeling of trepidation. Making a bow to the audience, he struck up the favorite melody of the day. He really played very well, the excitement of playing before an audience helping rather than interfering with him, and his performance was greeted with hearty and long continued applause. At Mr. Montgomery\u0027s suggestion he gratified the audience with an encore. Among those who applauded loudest was the boy to whom he had given free admission. 160 \"You have done yourself proud, Dean, my boy,\" said Montgomery, when Dean retired behind the screen. \"Our entertainment is a success. Our audience is good-natured.\" \"I can\u0027t help thinking how the folks at home would be surprised if they knew I was performing in public,\" said Dean, smiling. \"And making money out of it. That\u0027s where the best part comes in. Follow up your success, my boy. I shall go out twice and then call on you again.\" The next time Dean appeared with confidence, being satisfied that the audience were friendly. His second appearance was equally satisfactory, and he was compelled to blush when he overheard one school-girl on the front row of benches whisper to another, \"Isn\u0027t he sweet?\" \"It seems to me I am learning a good deal about myself,\" thought Dean. \"I must take care not to get conceited.\" The dual entertainment lasted about an hour and a half, Mr. Montgomery of course using up the lion\u0027s share of the time. At last it concluded, and Dean and his companion gathered up the money and went home. The profits over and above expenses amounted to eighty dollars, of which the editor, according to the agreement, received forty per cent, or161 thirty-two dollars. The remainder, forty-eight dollars, was divided equally between Dean and Mr. Montgomery. As the hotel charge was but a dollar a day for each, they felt handsomely compensated for their exertions.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81489.html","bookId":428,"book":{"id":428,"title":"Dean Dunham Or, the Waterford Mystery","description":"简介： I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah, said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
