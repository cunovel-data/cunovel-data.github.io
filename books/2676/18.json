Water pressure will hold the air until we reach operational depth. We\u0027re going to need all the help we can get and as soon as we can get it.\"\n Ramsey\u0027s hands moved over the tow board carrying out his orders.\n They inched upward. Ramsey stared at the red dials of the slug\u0027s pressure system. \"Bow tank\u0027s beginning to bubble.\"\n They could feel it in the deck: a return to normal climb gradient, speed picking up.\n \"Bow tank just blew,\" said Ramsey. \"There goes the stern.\" He wiped perspiration from his forehead.\n \"That was the thing Les should have considered,\" said Sparrow. \"Now we know we can get off. As long as we have external weight which we can drop for the initial buoyancy.\"\n \"How do you know that Les didn\u0027t --\"\n \"I know my shipmates,\" said Sparrow. \"Learn something from this, Johnny, and you\u0027ll make a good submariner. Never head into anything with a sub unless you have already worked out a plan for coming out the other side.\"\n Ramsey chose his words carefully. \"What\u0027s your plan for making the big come-out on the other side -with the oil?\"\n \"Not just one plan,\" said Sparrow. \"I have plans for every contingency I can think of. And for some maybe I shouldn\u0027t have thought of.\"\n \"Like for instance?\"\n Sparrow turned and looked full at him. \"Like for instance my crew going psychotic, one by one.\"\n Ramsey\u0027s eyes widened. The words leaped out before he could stop them. \"And what about yourself?\"\n Sparrow\u0027s eyes glittered. \"That\u0027s one of the ones maybe I shouldn\u0027t have thought of,\" he said. He swung back to the controls.\n He\u0027s like a piece of machinery, thought Ramsey. Great God in heaven, what went into making a man like that?\n Bonnett entered carrying a hypodermic, its needle covered by a sterile pad. \"Time for your shot, Skipper.\"\n \"In my left arm?\" asked Sparrow.\n \"Well --\"\n \"Don\u0027t I get to keep any dignity?\" asked Sparrow.\n Ramsey grinned.\n \"I swear you guys take a perverse delight in this,\" growled Sparrow.\n \"It\u0027s really too much for your arm,\" said Bonnett. He glanced up at the static gauge. \"Six thousand feet! What\u0027re we doing up here in the shallows?\"\n Sparrow chuckled. \"Okay, take my mind off my troubles.\" He backed away from the board. \"Take over here, Johnny.\n Ramsey stepped into control position. Behind him, he heard Sparrow grunt. \"Easy, Les!\"\n \"Easy as I could, Skipper. There. Have Joe check you on his watch. You seem to be coming along okay.\"\n \"I should be. I\u0027ve three nursemaids.\"\n Sparrow moved up beside Ramsey. \"Hold us on course sixty-four degrees, forty-five minutes.\"\n Ramsey turned the helm, looked up at the sonoran chart. \"That\u0027ll bring us around Nordkapp.\" He did some mental figuring, glanced at the shaftlog counter. \"About twenty-six and a half hours.\"\n Sparrow looked startled.\n \"He\u0027s good with figures,\" said Bonnett.\n \"He\u0027s also too interested in where we\u0027re, going to be and when,\" said Sparrow.\n \"That Security pap is for the birds,\" said Ramsey. \"I wish to remind you that we found a dead man aboard this vessel, that we\u0027ve been sabotaged right and left, that --\" He broke off, staring at Ramsey.\n It was Bonnett\u0027s turn to look startled.\n And now I\u0027m in over my head, thought Ramsey. My plan had better be right or I won\u0027t . . . come out the other side.\n Sparrow looked at the timelog. \"Time for Les to go on watch now.\" He gestured for Bonnett to take the helm. \"Put us on auto-pilot. Steady as she goes.\"\n Ramsey went to the aft door, found Sparrow staring at him. The captain turned deliberately away, moved closer to Bonnett. \"Stand by the search board as soon as we\u0027re on auto-pilot.\"\n \"Aye, Skipper.\"\n Ramsey went out the door, swung it almost closed behind him, stood there with his ear to the crack. Bonnett said, \"How\u0027s Joe?\"\n \"He\u0027s all right. He\u0027ll stand his regular watch.\"\n \"What\u0027s with this Long John Ramsey? Skipper, could he be a phony?\"\n \"No doubt of it,\" said Sparrow. \"The only question in my mind is: What kind of phony?\"\n \"Could he be a --\"\n \"He very definitely could be. Someone loaded us with spy beams and trapped that Security officer.\"\n \"But Ramsey wasn\u0027t aboard then.\"\n \"That\u0027s what bothers me. Unless there was something wrong with the Security man\u0027s timing. That would explain it.\"\n \"I\u0027ll watch him, Skipper.\"\n \"You do that. I\u0027m also alerting Joe.\"\n Ramsey tiptoed away from the door. Well, I did it, he thought, I\u0027d better be right. He shuddered, turned at the end of the companionway, dropped down to his cabin level. He paused in front of Garcia\u0027s cabin, looked at the blank metal of the door. Again the thought passed through his mind: I\u0027d better be right.\n He went into his cabin, closing the door softly behind him, locking it. Then he brought out the telemeter, unreeled the tapes. There was response for Sparrow\u0027s time in the tunnel repairing the pile controls, but now Sparrow was under rigid control. The wave patterns on the tapes were like the path of a rubber ball bouncing between two walls.\n I have to be able to crack that control at will, thought Ramsey. He has to fail -- just once. At the right time and at the right thing.\n And another part of his mind said: That\u0027s a helluva way to make someone well.\n He fought down that thought. It has to be. It\u0027s accepted practice. It works. Most of the time.\n Sparrow\u0027s advice came back to him: \"Never head into anything unless you have already worked out a plan for coming out the other side.\"\n Ramsey sat down on his bunk, reset the telemeter, sealed it, slid it back beneath his desk.\n What if my plan doesn\u0027t work? What\u0027s my alternative for that contingency?\n He lay back on his bunk, staring at the rivet pattern overhead. Around him, the muted throbbing and humming of the subtug took on a fantasy life. As though it knew where it was going and how to get there.\n Ramsey fell into a troubled sleep, awoke for his next watch to find his body soaked in perspiration, a disturbing half memory of a dream -- no, a nightmare -- which he could not bring to consciousness.\n The automatic timelog read twelve days, seven hours, and five minutes from departure. Last half of Garcia\u0027s watch, first half of Bonnett\u0027s. The red dot on the sonoran chart stood well into the shore off Nordkapp: shallow water with the Ram creeping along the bottom in one hundred fathoms.\n In the control room, a brightly lighted sweep of bulkhead, telltales flashing, heavy shadows on the undersides of levers and valve wheels. Wavering admonitions of dial needles. The two men bent over their work like laborers in a metal cave.\n Bonnett looked up to the static pressure: 260 pounds to the square inch. \"What\u0027s the skipper thinking of, coming in close like this?\"\n \"Don\u0027t ask so many questions.\" Garcia made a minute adjustment in the bow planes, watched the depth repeater. \"We\u0027re twenty feet from bottom.\"\n Sparrow ducked through the door from the aft companionway. \"Anything showing on the search board?\" His voice was husky with a sense of fatigue. He coughed.\n \"Negative,\" said Bonnett.\n \"This is their water,\" said Sparrow. \"They\u0027ve no shore stations along the north coast; only along the Norway reaches.\"\n \"This is still awful close,\" said Bonnett. Again he looked to the depth gauge. \"And awful shallow.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think this is a safe place for us?\" asked Sparrow.\n \"No.\"\n \"Good. That means they don\u0027t either. They know this is a deep tug. They\u0027re out scouring the Norwegian basin. The sill depth there is right on our known limit.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"So we\u0027re going to shoot right across the shallows.\" He glanced at Garcia, then up to the sonoran chart \"Course seventy degrees, Joe.\"\n Garcia swung the helm, watched the compass until they were heading true, then he, too, looked at the chart. \"Novaya Zemlya,\" he whispered.\n \"We\u0027re shallow enough to start taking outside samples,\" said Sparrow. \"Les, look for an isobaric surface running almost parallel with our course. We could use the shielding of some cold water.\"\n Bonnett pulled down a density-gradient chart for the area, checked the isobaric differences, ran a siphon sample of the exterior water. \"Give us sixty-nine degrees for five minutes,\" he said.\n Garcia touched the helm. They watched the thermocouple repeater. Suddenly, it dipped fifteen degrees. \"Resume course,\" said Sparrow.\n The Ram returned to seventy degrees, cruising under the sheltering mask of the cold current which spilled down around them.\n \"Steady as she goes,\" said Sparrow. \"Push search to limit. It\u0027s a straight run from here on in.\"\n \"It\u0027s Novaya Zemlya, isn\u0027t it?\" asked Garcia.\n Sparrow hesitated, then: \"It\u0027s obvious anyway. Yes.\"\n \"That\u0027s an EP rocket-testing base,\" said Bonnett. \"It\u0027ll be bristling with buzzards and snoopers.\"\n \"We dug the well right under their noses,\" said Sparrow. \"If we could dig without their hearing us, we ought to be able to drain it dry undetected.\"\n \"Are they tapping the reservoir, too?\"\n Sparrow grinned wolfishly, his long face glistening in the multihued lights of the control board. \"That\u0027s the beauty of it. They don\u0027t even know it\u0027s there.\"\n \"Lord,\" whispered Bonnett. \"A fresh well. What\u0027re we looking for in the way of landmarks?\"\n Again Sparrow hesitated while his eyes sought out the red dot on the sonoran chart. It wouldn\u0027t even be a secret from the EPs if they spotted us here, he thought. Now, we\u0027re in God\u0027s hands for sure.\n \"We\u0027re looking for a narrow fault fissure,\" he said. \"It\u0027s called the gut and it slants right up into the island shelf. You can\u0027t miss it once you range across it. Depth down to 3600 feet and only 400 feet across.\"\n \"Fissure is right,\" said Garcia. \"Do we go down into that thing?\"\n \"No. It\u0027s our trail. We track it in.\" Again he looked at the chart. \"Thirty-three hours at this rate.\" He turned to the aft door. \"Call me if anything develops.\"\n And he was gone down the companionway.\n \"If anything develops,\" muttered Bonnett. \"We\u0027re sitting ducks. The only development we\u0027ll get is a fish in our belly. That\u0027ll wake him!\"\n \"I think he\u0027s right,\" said Garcia. \"They\u0027re all out in the deeps looking for us. This is going to be a milk run.\"\n \"I\u0027m curdled already,\" said Bonnett. He fell silent, watching the search board.\n The Ram drove onward, headlong across the shallows like a frightened fish. The hands of the timelog swept around, around.\n \"Relieving Mr. Garcia on watch.\" Ramsey spoke as he ducked through the door into the control room. He could sense the immediate stiffening of the two men on the board, the mounting tension.\n Garcia made an attempt at casual banter. \"Look who\u0027s gone all Navy formal on us.\"\n Ramsey took up his position beside Garcia. \"What course?\"\n \"Seventy degrees.\" Garcia surrendered the helm.\n \"Busting right across the shallows,\" said Ramsey. \"If we make this, I\u0027m going to burn a candle to St. Cuthbert.\"\n \"That\u0027s not good talk,\" said Bonnett.\n \"Have you heard what the EPs have done now?\" asked Ramsey. \"They\u0027ve put engines in Novaya Zemlya. When we get close they\u0027re going to move it right out of our way, let us go lumbering off into Siberia.\"\n \"Clever chaps,\" said Garcia.\n \"Skipper\u0027s going to run us right into an EP trap net,\" said Ramsey. \"Well spend the rest of the war in a prison camp being brainwashed while they take the Ram apart bolt by --\"\n \"Button your bloody lip,\" said Garcia. \"We\u0027re going to pull this one off. And when we set foot on that blessed dock I\u0027m going to take an obscene pleasure in pushing you --\"\n \"That will be enough!\" said Bonnett. \"This is no time for fighting among ourselves.\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t say that if you knew all about this wise guy,\" said Garcia. \"The superior brain: knows all, sees all, tells nothing!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-18.html","bookId":2676,"book":{"id":2676,"title":"The Dragon in the Sea","description":"Storyline: \n In the twenty-first century, the United States has begun stealing desperately needed oil from underwater deposits in enemy territory.
