They were lying doggo!\"\\n\\n Sparrow kicked the alarm buzzer, brought the engines to life.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re right in our path,\" said Ramsey. \"Range fifteen miles.\"\\n\\n \"Sure-kill range,\" said Sparrow. He brought the sub-tug and tow around to the northeast, pulled the power bar to its last notch.\\n\\n Bonnett and Garcia hurried into the control room.\\n\\n \"A pack on us,\" said Ramsey.\\n\\n \"On the controls, you two,\" said Sparrow.\\n\\n Bonnett and Garcia moved into their battle stations, Bonnett at the helm, Garcia on the torpedo board. Sparrow stepped to Ramsey\u0027s side.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s bottom at 8800 feet,\" said Ramsey.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to chance it,\" said Sparrow. \"Les, take us down. Johnny, monitor the atmosphere.\"\\n\\n Ramsey opened the control valve on the anhydrase generator one notch.\\n\\n The subtug\u0027s deck slanted downward.\\n\\n \"Joe, call the depths,\" said Sparrow.\\n\\n \"Sixty-eight hundred feet and 2880 pounds . . . 7000 feet and 3010 pounds . . . 7500 and 3235 . . . 8000 and 3440 . . . 8500 and 3655 --\"\\n\\n \"Coast in,\" said Sparrow.\\n\\n Bonnett silenced the drive.\\n\\n Garcia\u0027s voice continued: \"-- 8600 and 3700 . . . variation, Skipper --\"\\n\\n \"-- 8700 and 3750 . . . that\u0027s nine pounds over normal, Skipper --\"\\n\\n \"Noted.\"\\n\\n \"-- 8750 and 3780 . . . that\u0027s eighteen pounds over . . .\"\\n\\n \"Noted. Les, flatten the glide angle and give us the bow eye on the main screen.\"\\n\\n \"Bottom is forty feet,\" said Ramsey. \"The pack is closing fast. Range about eleven miles.\"\\n\\n The big screen above their heads showed its pie slice of light and, abruptly, bottom mud.\\n\\n \"Drop the slug in first,\" said Sparrow.\\n\\n Bonnett brought up the bow planes until they felt the drag of the slug behind them. The Ram settled onto bottom mud in 8800 feet. The big static pressure gauge read 3804 pounds even: Twenty pounds above normal for the depth.\\n\\n \"Pack range nine miles and fanning out,\" said Ramsey. \"I count sixteen of them.\"\\n\\n \"Fanning out,\" said Sparrow. \"That means they\u0027re confused by our --\"\\n\\n \"Two breaking away toward the surface,\" said Ramsey. \"They think we\u0027ve floated up.\"\\n\\n \"Over normal pressure,\" said Sparrow. \"There\u0027s a cold density layer above us confusing our sound pattern. Unless they detect metal, we\u0027re safe.\"\\n\\n \"Unless we implode,\" said Bonnett.\\n\\n \"If we had some ham we\u0027d have some ham and eggs, if we had some eggs,\" said Ramsey.\\n\\n Garcia chuckled.\\n\\n \"The important thing is for us all to relax,\" said Sparrow. \"We don\u0027t want the same complications we had last --\"\\n\\n \"Complishmashuns,\" said Garcia. \"Alla time talk-talk-talk-talk. So he can psycho . . . psy --So he can find out what makes us go tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick. Don\u0027t y\u0027, Johnny boy?\"\\n\\n Ramsey raised his eyebrows, looked at Sparrow. Sparrow shrugged, said, \"Come along, Joe. You need a shot.\"\\n\\n \"Need a whole bottle,\" said Garcia. \"Need a shycoan\u0027lyst like Johnny boy here. Don\u0027 I, Johnny boy?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ordering you to come with me, Joe,\" said Sparrow.\\n\\n Tears welled up in Garcia\u0027s eyes. \"I need a conscience,\" he sobbed. \"I wanna confess, but no one --\"\\n\\n \"Come along!\" Sparrow grabbed Garcia\u0027s arm, jerked him toward the aft door.\\n\\n \"Easy, Skipper,\" said Ramsey.\\n\\n Sparrow took a deep breath. \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come quietly,\" said Garcia. \"No need get excited. I don\u0027 wanna be any trouble. I been enough trouble. I been terrible trouble. Never forgive me. Never.\"\\n\\n He allowed himself to be led out the door, still mumbling, \"Never . . . never . . . never . . . never . . .\"\\n\\n \"Quoth the raven,\" said Ramsey. He rubbed absently at the still-sensitive bruise on his jaw where Bonnett had hit him.\\n\\n \"That figures,\" said Bonnett.\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"Head thumper. BuPsych rang you in on us.\"\\n\\n \"Not you, too, Brutus,\" said Ramsey.\\n\\n \"Sure, it figures,\" said Bonnett. \"Hepp went loco, so they rang you in on us to find out why.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. You want to see which of us is next.\"\\n\\n \"Me, if I hear any more of this nutty talk. I\u0027ve --\"\\n\\n \"Otherwise you\u0027re a spy,\" said Bonnett. \"I guess you\u0027re not that.\"\\n\\n \"Of all the --\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to apologize,\" said Bonnett. \"It isn\u0027t easy. Basically, I don\u0027t like head thumpers. You screw-doctors are all alike. Superior . . . know-it-all. Explanations for everything: Religion is a manifestation of deep-seated anxieties which --\"\\n\\n \"Oh, knock it off,\" said Ramsey.\\n\\n \"What I\u0027m trying to say is that I\u0027ve felt better ever since I pounded you. Call it a cathartic. For a minute I had the enemy in my own hands. He was an insect I could crush.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ve never had the enemy in my hands before.\" He held up his hands and looked at them. \"Right there. I learned something.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"This may sound asinine.\"\\n\\n \"Say it anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027d better not.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing was ever more important than for you to focalize that thought,\" said Ramsey. And he thought: No matter what I do, I\u0027m cast in the role of analyst!\\n\\n Bonnett rubbed his hands against his shirt, looked at the control board. \"When you meet your enemy and recognize him and touch him, you find out that he\u0027s like yourself: that maybe he\u0027s part of you.\" He shook his head. \"I\u0027m not saying this right.\"\\n\\n \"Try.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t do it.\" Bonnett lowered his head, stared at the deck.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s it like? Try a comparison.\"\\n\\n In a low, almost inaudible voice, Bonnett said, \"It\u0027s like when you\u0027re the youngest and weakest kid on the playground. And when the biggest kid smacks you, that\u0027s all right because he noticed you. That means you\u0027re alive. It\u0027s better than when they ignore you.\" He looked up at Ramsey. \"Or it\u0027s like when you\u0027re with a woman and she looks at you and her eyes say you\u0027re a man. Yeah, that\u0027s it. When you\u0027re really alive, other people know it.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that have to do with having the enemy in your hands?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s alive,\" said Bonnett. \"Dammit all, man, he\u0027s alive and he\u0027s got the same kind of aliveness that you have. Each of us is the enemy\" -- Bonnett\u0027s voice grew firmer -- \"to the other and to himself. That\u0027s what I mean: I\u0027m the enemy within myself. Unless I master that enemy, I always lose.\"\\n\\n Ramsey stared at Bonnett in amazement.\\n\\n \"Not the kind of thinking you\u0027d expect from me,\" said Bonnett.\\n\\n Ramsey shook his head.\\n\\n \"Why not? I feel things just like anybody else. So I hide it most of the time. Who am I hiding it from?\" He sneered. \"Me. That\u0027s who.\"\\n\\n \"What set you off?\"\\n\\n \"I found someone I could talk to, someone who had to keep his professional mouth shut because --\"\\n\\n \"Just a minute.\" Ramsey\u0027s gaze, never off the search-board instruments for more than a few seconds, had caught a sharp needle deflection. \"Sonic search blast. There\u0027s another. If they\u0027re spaced on us, our hull will stick up like a sore thumb: a fat metal finger.\"\\n\\n \"They won\u0027t look for us down here.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t count on it. There\u0027s anoth --\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" Sparrow ducked through the door into the control room.\\n\\n \"Sonic search bombs,\" said Ramsey. \"The EPs are looking for a metallic bounce labeled Fenian Ram.\"\\n\\n Sparrow moved closer to stand at Ramsey\u0027s shoulders. \"And here comes one ranging over us.\"\\n\\n \"Fast,\" said Ramsey. He put his hand on the anti-torp volley switch.\\n\\n \"Leave that alone,\" said Sparrow. \"They won\u0027t use a fish on an unidentified bump.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s inside of a mile,\" said Ramsey. \"In the six-thousand foot level. There goes another search bomb.\"\\n\\n They felt the dull bump of it through the hull.\\n\\n \"If one of our external fittings implodes, the shock wave\u0027ll crack us like --\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve all read the manual, Les,\" said Sparrow. He turned away from the board, bent his head. \"Lord, we who have no right to ask it, do plead for your mercy. Thy will be done. . . . Whatever.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s turning away,\" whispered Ramsey.\\n\\n \"Lord, turn not away from thy --\"\\n\\n \"That EP sub,\" said Ramsey. \"He\u0027s turning away.\"\\n\\n Sparrow lifted his head. \"Thank you, Lord.\" He looked at Bonnett. \"Joe\u0027s under sedation. Go back and stay with him.\"\\n\\n Bonnett went out the aft door.\\n\\n Sparrow again moved to stand beside Ramsey. \"That was a good thing you did for Les.\"\\n\\n Ramsey stiffened.\\n\\n \"I stood outside the door until he\u0027d shed the load on his chest,\" said Sparrow. \"You\u0027re a much deeper man than I\u0027d suspected, Johnny.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, for Heaven\u0027s sake!\"\\n\\n \"Yes, for Heaven\u0027s sake,\" said Sparrow. \"You\u0027re a devious one.\"\\n\\n Ramsey closed his eyes in exasperation, opened them. I\u0027m the father-confessor whether I like it or not, he thought. \"Garcia is off his rocker,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve shipped with Joe for quite a number of years,\" said Sparrow. \"I\u0027ve seen him drunk before. Pressure drunkenness is no different. He\u0027s not the kind to make false accusations. That would be bearing false witness against --\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just talking to --\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s troubled in the spirit,\" said Sparrow. \"He needs someone like you -- a confessor. Did you ever stop to think that you boys are like priests in the way --\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard it mentioned,\" said Ramsey, and realized he had made a confession of identity.\\n\\n Sparrow smiled. \"Always have a way out the other side, Johnny. Have your safe line of retreat prepared. Joe hates you right now because he doesn\u0027t want to admit he needs you.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-23.html","bookId":2676,"book":{"id":2676,"title":"The Dragon in the Sea","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-first century, the United States has begun stealing desperately needed oil from underwater deposits in enemy territory.
