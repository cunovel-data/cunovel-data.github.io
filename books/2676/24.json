He said, \"Are you suggesting I copper my bets in the religious gamble?\" \"No bet-coppering there,\" said Sparrow. \"Yeah, I guess you\u0027re right,\" agreed Ramsey. His mouth twisted into a wry smile. \"That\u0027s like telling your psychoanalyst, \u0027I\u0027m going to get married as soon as my analysis is finished.\u0027 You\u0027ll never finish.\" And he thought: Well, the mask is off. Why do I feel relieved? That\u0027s suspicious. I shouldn\u0027t feel relieved. Sparrow studied the search board. \"They\u0027re almost out of range.\" He began to hum, then in a low voice sang, \"You\u0027ll never get to heaven on roller skates! You\u0027ll roll right past those pearly gates.\" \"\u0027I ain\u0027 gonna grieve my Lord no more,\u0027\" said Ramsey. \"What?\" Sparrow turned away from the board. \"That\u0027s what you were singing: \u0027I ain\u0027 gonna grieve my Lord no more.\u0027\" \"So I was.\" Sparrow cocked his head toward the search board. \"They\u0027re going out of range in the northeast quadrant. Surface currents set northeast here. That means they\u0027ve decided we floated up. Give them an hour out of range.\" Ramsey checked the sonic pickup monitor on the board, said, \"All accounted for in that quadrant, Skipper. No stakeouts.\" \"Certain?\" Ramsey nodded toward the monitor tape. \"They\u0027re flustered and that means bad judgment every time,\" said Sparrow. \"Remember that, Johnny. Keep calm no matter what and you\u0027ll --\" \"Skipper!\" It was Bonnett at the door behind them. They whirled. \"Joe\u0027s blood pressure. It\u0027s going up, then down, wider and wider. He acts like he\u0027s in shock and --\" Sparrow turned back to the board. \"They\u0027re beyond range. Slide off, Johnny. Take us to 6000 feet. Fast!\" He hurried toward the door. \"Les, come with me.\" \"What about the slug?\" called Ramsey. Sparrow stopped in mid-stride, turned back to Ramsey. \"I should listen to my own advice. Les, do what you can for Joe. Johnny, free the clutch on the tow cables.\" Sparrow moved to the main controls. \"We\u0027ll have to lift the Ram and leave the slug on the bottom until we reach cable limit.\" \"Then try to jerk it off,\" said Ramsey. \"If we can get it started up, the compensator system will keep it coming,\" said Sparrow. \"If,\" said Ramsey. \"Drop two of our fish,\" said Sparrow. Ramsey depressed two of the red-banded torpedo switches. The subtug shifted, remained on the bottom. \"Two more,\" said Sparrow. Again Ramsey selected two matched torpedo switches, depressed them. The subtug\u0027s nose lifted gently, seemed to hesitate, resumed its rise. The tail came up. Ramsey fed power into the drive, raised the bow planes. The Ram slid upward. They could feel the faint rum-bung of the giant cable reel into the outer hull. At 1700 feet, Sparrow said, \"Try the brake.\" Ramsey put pressure on the reel hub. The Ram strained against the lines. \"Five hundred feet more cable,\" said Ramsey. Sparrow threw full power into the drive. \"Lock the reel.\" Ramsey closed the switch on the magnetic brake. The subtug came almost to a full stop, then slowly resumed its climb. Ramsey watched the tow board. \"That freed her, Skipper. Now, how much mud are we going to lose out of the compensator system?\" He leaned to the right to adjust the atmosphere controls. \"If we lose ballast, it\u0027ll be --\" \"Skipper.\" It was Bonnett at the aft door. Sparrow spoke without turning away from the controls. \"How is he?\" \"Resting easier.\" Bonnett looked at the big static pressure gauge. \"It\u0027s only 2790 pounds now. We got off okay.\" \"Not okay yet,\" said Sparrow. \"Take over the helm.\" He turned the wheel over to Bonnett, moved across to Ramsey\u0027s station. \"What course?\" asked Bonnett. \"Steady on 197 degrees.\" \"Steady on 197 degrees,\" acknowledged Bonnett. \"We need some more luck,\" said Ramsey. \"St. Christopher is already getting overtime on this trip,\" said Bonnett. \"She seems to be maintaining hydrostatic balance,\" said Ramsey. \"Stay with that board,\" said Sparrow. \"It\u0027s too soon to tell.\" \"Compartment twenty-seven is fluctuating a little,\" said Ramsey. \"How much?\" \"Maybe five percent.\" \"Keep an eye on it.\" Sparrow went back to Bonnett\u0027s station. He stared up at the sonoran chart. \"That pack left us in the corner of the northeast quadrant.\" \"They made a bad guess,\" said Bonnett. Sparrow said, \"Are you sure Joe is all right?\" \"Everything was back to normal when I left him.\" \"Mmmm, hmmm.\" Sparrow nodded. \"Don\u0027t sell that enemy commander short. He had inadequate information. The surface currents set that way.\" Sparrow pointed to the lower portion of the chart. \"That\u0027s radioactive water to the south -- contaminated by the British Isles. He knows we wouldn\u0027t turn east into the range of their shore station. Ergo: We went with the current.\" Bonnett pointed to the red-outlined radioactive area west of the British Isles. \"There are deep cold currents setting south into that area, Skipper.\" \"You\u0027re reading my mind,\" said Sparrow. \"They wouldn\u0027t be as hot as the surface layers,\" said Bonnett. \"It depends on how well we\u0027re able to follow the thermal layer,\" said Sparrow. \"It\u0027d be like nosing into a one-way pipe,\" said Ramsey, \"We\u0027d have to follow the thermal current of uncontaminated water. And what would happen if we had to come up through all that hot water? Uh, uh.\" Sparrow said, \"Let me figure this.\" He took a sheet of paper from his pocket, scribbled on it, stared at it, scribbled some more, again examined his work. \"Steady as she goes on 197 degrees,\" he said. \"It\u0027s our best chance.\" Bonnett said, \"What about Joe?\" \"I\u0027ll go back and check him now. Stay here with Johnny. Let me know if outside water goes above 1000 milli-R.\" \"Aye.\" The Ram coursed southeast, moving closer and closer to the blighted Scottish coast, rising to shallower and shallower waters. The relatively radiation-free thermal current thinned until it was not quite twice the Ram\u0027s hull diameter from top to bottom: about 120 feet. Sparrow returned from the rec room. \"He\u0027s okay now. No residual effects.\" He stepped across to the tow board. \"Any more fluctuation in compartment twenty-seven?\" \"Negative. We haven\u0027t been in one depth long enough for me to get a check on the pressure constant.\" Ramsey looked at the search board, watched the green face of the ranging scope. \"Not a pip out of those EP packs.\" He turned to Sparrow. \"Could we risk a slave pulse inside the slug? I\u0027d like to get something positive on the relative densities.\" Sparrow pulled at his lower lip, looked at the ranging scope. \"Okay. Just one.\" Ramsey set up the recording dials on the tow board, pushed the sonar-pulse button. Dial needles surged: the time-over-density counter buzzed. Sparrow said: \"Ballast compartment\u0027s slow forward.\" Ramsey compared the outer and inner time recordings. \"Oil in the ballast,\" he said. \"There\u0027s a pressure break on the inside.\" \"And we\u0027re painting an oily path on the surface!\" barked Sparrow. \"If the EPs have an air patrol over this area they\u0027ll spot the slick. They might just as well have an engraved chart of our course.\" Ramsey turned to the timelog. \"Four hours to daylight topside. What\u0027s the Security word on EP air patrols over these hot waters?\" \"Dunno. I wish they\u0027d --\" \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Garcia stood in the aft door. Sparrow said, \"You\u0027re not supposed to be up. Get back to sick bay.\" \"I\u0027m okay.\" He stepped onto the control deck. \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"We\u0027re leaking oil,\" said Bonnett. Garcia\u0027s gaze darted to the sonoran chart. \"Holy Mother! What\u0027re we doing down here?\" Sparrow said, \"Les, take us up. Johnny, monitor the outside radiation. Mark each 1000-milli-R increase. Let me know immediately if that ruptured oil compartment starts to blow.\" He turned toward Garcia, studied him for a minute. \"Joe, do you feel up to rigging us for slug repair?\" Garcia shrugged. \"Why not? I\u0027ve just had a good rest. What\u0027d I do this time?\" \"A cheap drunk,\" said Bonnett. \"Where\u0027d you hide the bottle?\" He bent to turn the wheel on the bow planes. \"Two degrees! No more,\" barked Sparrow. \"Two degrees,\" acknowledged Bonnett. Garcia moved forward, went through the door onto the engine-room catwalk. \"Reading 2200 milli-R,\" said Ramsey. \"Pressure 690 pounds to the square inch.\" Sparrow said, \"Oil loss?\" \"Fifty-five gallons a minute. Constant.\" Sparrow said, \"I\u0027ll take over here, Johnny. Go forward and help Joe.\" \"Aye.\" Ramsey surrendered his position, went to the forward door, stepped through onto the catwalk. The electric engines were four droning hives around him, the gray metal of their casings gleaming dully in the stand-by lights. Through the webwork of girders, catwalks, and ladders, Ramsey could see Garcia high above him near the escape hatch unreeling a safety line, readying it for the outside spools. Ramsey mounted the ladders, came up behind Garcia. \"Looks like I\u0027m going swimming again, Joe.\" Garcia glanced back, returned his attention to his work. \"This one\u0027s on me.\" Ramsey bent over, steadied the spool. \"Why?\" \"I\u0027m the best swimmer aboard. It stands to --\" \"Somehow I got the idea you might be afraid of the water.\" Garcia grinned, then frowned. \"I was responsible for a man dying in a water-polo game. Broke his neck. That was supposed to be a game. This is business.\" \"But you just got up from pressure sickness.\" \"I\u0027ve had a good rest.\" He straightened. \"Hand me down that patching kit from the bulkhead rack. That\u0027s a good fellow.\" Ramsey turned to the bulkhead, found the underwater patch kit, removed it. Behind him, he heard Garcia on the intercom. \"Is it compartment twenty-seven?\" \"Yes. Why?\" Sparrow\u0027s voice impersonalized by the speaker system. \"How\u0027m I going to fix --\" \"I\u0027m doing this one, Joe. That\u0027s --\" \"I\u0027m rested, Skipper, and I feel fine. Remember me? Swimming champ?\" Silence. Then: \"Are you sure you feel okay?\" \"Tiptop, Skipper. Never better.\" \"Ramsey.\" Ramsey turned, then grinned at the reaction, pushed the button on his chest mike. \"Here, Skipper.\" \"How\u0027s Joe look?\" Ramsey looked at Garcia. \"Same as ever.\" \"Okay, Joe. But if you start feeling funny, come back in immediately. That\u0027s an order.\" \"Righto, Skipper. How much oil we losing?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-24.html","bookId":2676,"book":{"id":2676,"title":"The Dragon in the Sea","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-first century, the United States has begun stealing desperately needed oil from underwater deposits in enemy territory.
