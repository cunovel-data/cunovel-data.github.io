A church provides a common bond for people, a clear line of communication.\" He shook his head. \"Unless BuPsych can uncover telepathy or absolute proof of the hereafter, it can\u0027t substitute for religion. The sooner we face that, the sooner we\u0027ll be able to offer --\"\\n\\n Dr. Oberhausen slapped his hand on the desk top. \"Religion is not scientific! It\u0027s faith!\" He said faith as he might have said dirty.\\n\\n He\u0027s needling me, thought Ramsey. He said, \"Okay, Obe. All I\u0027m saying is this: We don\u0027t have a substitute for religion. But we\u0027re offering our so-called science as a substitute. That\u0027s all I\u0027m --\"\\n\\n \"So-called?\"\\n\\n \"How many distinct schools of psychology can you name?\"\\n\\n Dr. Oberhausen smiled thinly. \"At least as many as there are distinct religions.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re following the pattern even there,\" said Ramsey.\\n\\n The BuPsych chief chuckled. \"Did I interrupt a chain of thought?\"\\n\\n Ramsey paused. \"Only that I\u0027ve never met a psychoanalyst who didn\u0027t -- at least subconsciously -- offer his system as a substitute for religion. Present company included. We set ourselves up as little gods -all-knowing, all-healing. People resent that and rightly. We have polite labels for our failures. We agree among ourselves that anything bearing one of those labels is, of course, incurable.\"\\n\\n Dr. Oberhausen\u0027s voice held a sense of remoteness. \"That\u0027s quite an indictment, Johnny. Do I take it that you\u0027ve been converted by our good Captain Sparrow?\"\\n\\n Ramsey leaned back, laughed. \"Hell, no! I\u0027m just going to stop posing as a messiah.\"\\n\\n Dr. Oberhausen took a deep breath. \"That\u0027s encouraging.\"\\n\\n \"And I guess I\u0027ll go on poking around inside people\u0027s minds. If that describes whatever it is we do.\" He smiled. \"I\u0027ll keep on being a psychologist.\"\\n\\n \"What do you expect to find?\"\\n\\n Ramsey was silent a moment, then: \"A good scientist doesn\u0027t expect to find anything, Obe. He reports what he sees.\"\\n\\n Dr. Oberhausen clasped his hands. \"If you find God, please let me know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do that.\" Ramsey forced briskness into his voice. \"As long as we\u0027re clearing up loose ends, what about me? When do I get out of this damned uniform and into my nice new department of BuPsych?\"\\n\\n Dr. Oberhausen pushed his chair back, resting his hands on the edge of the desk. He tipped his head down, appeared to be staring at the bat-eye box. \"First, you\u0027ll have to play out your hero role. The President\u0027s going to pin medals on all of you. That\u0027s Belland\u0027s doing. By the way, the admiral has given Mrs. Garcia a job in his department, his polite way of keeping her under surveillance. But it works out for the best of all concerned.\"\\n\\n \"In this best of all possible worlds,\" said Ramsey. He sensed hesitancy in Dr. Oberhausen\u0027s manner. \"But when do I get out of the service?\"\\n\\n Dr. Oberhausen lifted his chin. \"I may not be able to get you out immediately, Johnny.\"\\n\\n Ramsey felt pressure building up inside him. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027re a hero. They\u0027ll want to exploit that.\" The BuPsych chief cleared his throat. \"Some things are difficult even for BuPsych. Look, I couldn\u0027t even get past BuMed and in to see you while --\"\\n\\n \"You promised me a --\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027ll keep my promise, Johnny. In time.\" He leaned back. \"Meanwhile, there\u0027s a commodore on the board of classification and promotion. He\u0027s a presidential errand boy and he needs an -- an aide-de-camp.\"\\n\\n \"Oh no!\" Ramsey stared at Dr. Oberhausen.\\n\\n The little doctor shrugged. \"Well, Johnny, he found out that you\u0027re the clever Long John Ramsey who improvised a vampire gauge from a hypodermic and two glass tubes and saved the Dolphin during that training-mission breakdown. He wants --\"\\n\\n Ramsey groaned.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be jumped to lieutenant,\" said Dr. Oberhausen.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" said Ramsey bitterly. He curled his lips, copied Dr. Oberhausen\u0027s voice: \"Sure, Johnny. You\u0027ll have your own department.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re young,\" said Dr. Oberhausen. \"There\u0027s time.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll have me polishing his shoes.\"\\n\\n \"Oh no. He\u0027s quite impressed by your talents. Says you\u0027re too good for BuPsych. Bringing home that oil has done nothing to reduce his admiration.\" Again the BuPsych chief cleared his throat. \"And while you\u0027re with the commodore there are some things about this department that I\u0027d like you to --\"\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s it!\" barked Ramsey. \"Another of your damned spy jobs! You want me to ferret out the dope on the commodore so you can move in on him. I\u0027ll bet you set this job up yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you see the necessity,\" said Dr. Oberhausen. \"That way lies sanity.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure,\" said Ramsey.\\n\\n \"I like your Captain Sparrow\u0027s analogy about sanity and swimming,\" said Dr. Oberhausen. \"But I would add to it, the swimmer must be prepared at all times to grasp a paddle.\"\\n\\n Ramsey smiled even as he realized that Dr. Oberhausen was amusing him to ease the tension between them. \"Okay, Obe. One more. But I\u0027m telling you now: that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Fair enough, Johnny. Now, if you\u0027ll just --\"\\n\\n A door slammed in the outer hall behind Ramsey. He heard a flurry of sounds. A woman\u0027s voice shouted: \"You can\u0027t stop me from going in there!\"\\n\\n Janet!\\n\\n His pulse quickened.\\n\\n The woman\u0027s voice mounted almost to a scream: \"I know he\u0027s in there with that damned Dr. Oberhausen! And by Heaven I\u0027m going in!\"\\n\\n The office door behind Ramsey burst open. He turned. It was a secretary. \"Please excuse me,\" she said. \"There\u0027s --\"\\n\\n \"Let her come in,\" said Dr. Oberhausen.\\n\\n Ramsey stood up, feeling suddenly giddy. Janet came rushing through the door and into his arms. A familiar perfume. The contours of a familiar face pressing against his cheek, a familiar body against his own.\\n\\n \"Johnny! Oh, Johnny!\"\\n\\n He heard Dr. Oberhausen get up, saw him walk past him toward the office door, fastening the bat-eye box to his shoulder as he went.\\n\\n \"Johnny, I missed you so.\"\\n\\n \"I missed you, too,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I never knew it would be so dangerous. Why, they told me --\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t bad, Janet. Really.\"\\n\\n \"But you were so long in the hospital!\"\\n\\n Dr. Oberhausen paused at the door, a figure in new perspective, grown suddenly smaller, giving off a sense of loneliness. Ramsey wanted to call out something but didn\u0027t know what. He said, \"Obe.\"\\n\\n The BuPsych chief turned.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see you soon,\" said Ramsey.\\n\\n The doctor smiled, nodded, went out, closing the door behind him.\\n\\n And then Ramsey had to explain to Janet why he wanted to include \"that awful old Obe\" in their reunion plans. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-33.html","bookId":2676,"book":{"id":2676,"title":"The Dragon in the Sea","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-first century, the United States has begun stealing desperately needed oil from underwater deposits in enemy territory.
