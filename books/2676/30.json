He rubbed the side of his jaw with his long-fingered hand. \"I had to know what it was I was doing. So I studied me. I analyzed me. I computed me against every background I could think of. I was completely ruthless with me.\" He fell silent. Cautiously, Ramsey said, \"And?\" \"I\u0027m nuts,\" said Sparrow. \"But I\u0027m nuts in a way which fits me perfectly to my world. That makes my world nuts and me normal. Not sane. Normal. Adapted.\" \"You\u0027re saying the world\u0027s schizoid, fragmented.\" \"Hasn\u0027t it always been?\" asked Sparrow. \"Where are there completely unbroken lines of communication? Show me complete social integration.\" He shook his long head from side to side in a slow negation. \"It\u0027s the pressure, Johnny.\" Ramsey made a minute adjustment on the flow meter controlling the exchange of blood in Garcia\u0027s body. He looked down at the drugged engineering officer. Face relaxed, peaceful. Pressures gone for the moment. \"We look to a Utopian existence as sanity,\" said Sparrow. \"No pressures against survival. That\u0027s why we get a dreamy nostalgia about us when we think of the old South Seas. Minimum threat to survival.\" Again he shook his head. \"Whatever the pressure and whatever the adaptation, that adaptation is definable by your science as non-sane. I sometimes think that\u0027s the proper interpretation of the Biblical phrase: \u0027A child shall lead them.\u0027 Children generally don\u0027t have survival pressures. Ergo: They\u0027re more sane than adults.\" \"They have their pressures,\" said Ramsey. \"Of a different character,\" said Sparrow. He bent, felt Garcia\u0027s pulse. \"How many changes left?\" \"Two.\" \"What\u0027s the radiation reading?\" Ramsey\u0027s head jerked as he turned to stare fully at the dial. \"Fifty-fifty.\" \"He\u0027ll live,\" said Sparrow. His voice carried a tone of absolute decision, an irrevocable judgment. Ramsey fought down an unaccountable irritation. \"How can you be so damned sure?\" \"You were startled when you focused on the meter,\" said Sparrow. \"It\u0027s a miracle he\u0027s come this far.\" In spite of himself, Ramsey\u0027s voice betrayed his irritation. \"That\u0027s right, a miracle,\" said Sparrow. \"Listen to me, Johnny. In spite of all your science and your medicine, there\u0027s something you people often refuse to admit.\" \"Which is?\" Now his voice was openly hostile. \"There\u0027s such a thing as being on God\u0027s side. Being right with the world. That\u0027s really the thing behind miracles. It\u0027s quite simple. You get in . . . well, phase. That\u0027s the mechanical way of saying it. You ride the wave instead of bucking it.\" Sparrow\u0027s voice carried a tone of calm detachment. Ramsey pressed his lips together to keep from speaking his thoughts. And over it all, his own psychological training was feeding data to a train of thought: Religious fanaticism. Fragmentation. Impenetrable belief in own righteousness. The evidence for a diagnosis of paranoiac type is very strong. \"Your particular adaptation is dictation by your psychological training,\" said Sparrow. \"You have a function: to keep operating. Call it normal. You have to believe I\u0027m insane and that your diagnosis of insanity type is accurate. That way, you\u0027re on top; you\u0027re in control. It\u0027s your way to survival. You can guide me and direct me like the proper animal that I am, and I\u0027ll take you back where the pressures are reduced.\" \"This is nonsense,\" barked Ramsey. \"Psychological nonsense! You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about!\" \"If your diagnosis is correct, what\u0027s the probable course of my life?\" asked Sparrow. Before he could stop himself, Ramsey said, \"You\u0027ll go completely psychotic! Completely --\" He broke off. Sparrow laughed. He shook his head. \"No, Johnny. I\u0027ll go back where the pressures are less. And I\u0027ll take a deep breath. And I\u0027ll play a little poker at Garden Glen. And I\u0027ll get drunk a time or two because it\u0027s expected of me. I\u0027ll have another honeymoon with my wife. She\u0027ll be very nice to me. Very contrite because of all the times she\u0027s cuckolded me while I\u0027ve been away. That\u0027s her adaptation. It doesn\u0027t really hurt me. Why should it?\" Ramsey stared at him. \"And, of course, I\u0027ll do some more wondering: What\u0027s this all about? What are we human animals? What\u0027s the meaning behind all this? If there is a meaning. But my roots are solid, Johnny. I\u0027ve seen miracles.\" He nodded toward Garcia. \"I\u0027ve known the outcome of events before even the events. That gives me a --\" The warning buzzer sounded on the blood-exchange unit. Ramsey slapped the transfer switch. Sparrow moved around the cot, disengaged the artery and vein taps. \"Sixty-forty,\" said Ramsey. \"We\u0027ll be at Charleston in twenty-two hours,\" said Sparrow. He looked at Ramsey. \"What do you intend to tell Admiral Belland\u0027s boys about Joe?\" \"I don\u0027t remember anything about Joe worth telling Belland,\" said Ramsey. A slow smile formed on Sparrow\u0027s lips. \"That\u0027s normal,\" he said. \"Not sane, but normal.\" Ramsey sniffed. Why am I irritated? he asked himself. And his psychological training gave him the unavoidable answer: Because I\u0027m not facing something about myself. There\u0027s something I don\u0027t want to see. \"Let\u0027s talk about Heppner,\" said Sparrow. Ramsey suppressed an urge to shout: For Christ\u0027s sake! What for? \"He got to wondering about sanity,\" continued Sparrow. \"And one day the truth dawned on him that I\u0027m not particularly sane. Then he got to wondering: What is sanity? He talked about some of his thoughts. And he found he couldn\u0027t define sanity. Not for sure. Which meant to him that he himself was off balance.\" Sparrow closed his eyes. \"So?\" whispered Ramsey. \"So he applied for a transfer out of the subtugs. He gave me the application to submit when we landed. That last trip.\" Ramsey said, \"He cast himself adrift.\" Sparrow nodded. \"And he\u0027d already admitted to himself that he had no anchor, no point of reference from which to navigate.\" Ramsey felt a curious internal stimulation, as though he were on the brink of a great revelation. \"And that,\" said Sparrow, \"is why I have to train another new electronics officer. You have to go back to BuPsych where you have your roots. That\u0027s an ocean in which you can navigate.\" Ramsey could contain the question no longer. \"What\u0027s your definition of sanity, Skipper?\" \"The ability to swim,\" said Sparrow. Ramsey felt a cold shock, as though he had been immersed suddenly in freezing water. He had to force himself to continue breathing normally. As though from a great distance, he heard Sparrow\u0027s voice: \"That means the sane person has to understand currents, has to know what\u0027s required in different waters.\" Ramsey heard a heavy thundering, counterpoint to Sparrow\u0027s matter-of-fact tones. \"Insanity is something like drowning,\" said Sparrow. \"You go under; you flounder without direction; you --Johnny! What\u0027s wrong?\" He heard the words, but they lacked meaning. The room was a spinning centrifuge with himself at the rim . . . faster . . . faster . . . faster . . . He caught at the blood-exchange unit, missed, crashed to the floor. A detached part of him sensed hands on his face, a finger lifting an eyelid. Sparrow\u0027s voice squeaked insanely down an inverted funnel: \"Shock!\" Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! footsteps slamming of cabinet door clinking of glass He floated in a gelatin hammock, bound in upon himself. A miniature stage opened before his eyes. Sparrow, Garcia, and Bonnett stood arm in arm, doll figures staring across Lilliputian footlights. Puppets. In a dull monotone, the miniature Sparrow said, \"I am a Commander, Submarine, Portable, Mark I.\" The miniature Garcia said, \"I am an Engineering Officer, Submarine, Portable, Mark I.\" The miniature Bonnett said, \"I am a First Officer, Submarine, Portable, Mark I.\" Ramsey tried to speak, but his lips would not respond. On the doll stage, Sparrow said, \"I am not sane; he is not sane; you are not sane; we are not sane; they are not sane.\" Garcia said, \"I regret to report the failure of a component: myself.\" He dissolved, leaving Sparrow and Bonnett separated by a space. Bonnett said, \"That Ramsey is a catalyst.\" Sparrow said, \"I cannot help you; he cannot help you; we cannot help you; they cannot help you; you cannot help yourself.\" Garcia\u0027s voice came from the empty space, \"I regret that I cannot thank you in person.\" Bonnett said, \"My generation doesn\u0027t believe in vampires.\" Again Ramsey tried to speak, but no sound came.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-30.html","bookId":2676,"book":{"id":2676,"title":"The Dragon in the Sea","description":"Storyline: In the twenty-first century, the United States has begun stealing desperately needed oil from underwater deposits in enemy territory.
