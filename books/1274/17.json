{"id":28316,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII WILD SURMISES","content":"WHEN THE paroxysm was over he felt Gala\u0027s hand in his hair. He looked round and saw her wince at the sight of him. She tugged at his hair and pointed up the cliffs. As she did so a shower of small pieces of chalk rattled down beside them. \\n\\n Weakly he got to his knees and then to his feet and together they scrambled and slid down off the mountain of chalk and away from the crater against the cliff from which they had escaped. \\n\\n The harsh sand under their feet was like velvet. They both collapsed full length and lay clutching at it with their horrible white hands as if its rough gold would wash the filthy whiteness away. Then Gala too was mercifully sick and Bond crawled a few paces away to leave her alone. He hauled himself to his feet against a single lump of chalk as big as a small motor-car, and at last his bloodshot eyes took in the hell that had almost engulfed them. \\n\\n Down to the beginning of the rocks, now lapped by the incoming tide, sprawled the debris of the cliff face, an avalanche of chalk blocks and shapes. The white dust of its collapse covered nearly an acre. Above it a jagged rent had appeared in the cliff and a wedge of blue sky had been bitten out of the distant top where before the line of the horizon had been almost straight. There were no longer any seabirds near them and Bond guessed that the smell of disaster would keep them away from the place for days. \\n\\n The nearness of their bodies to the cliff was what had saved them, that and the slight protection of the overhang below which the sea had bitten into the base of the cliff. They had been buried by the deluge of smaller stuff. The heavier chunks, any one of which would have crushed them, had fallen outwards, the nearest missing them by a few feet. And their nearness to the cliff was the reason for Bond\u0027s right arm having been comparatively free so that they had been able to burrow out of the mound before they were stifled. Bond realized that if some reflex had not hurled him on top of Gala at the moment of the avalanche they would now both be dead. \\n\\n He felt her hand on his shoulder. Without looking at her he put his arm round her waist and together they got down to the blessed sea and let their bodies fall weakly, thankfully into the shallows. \\n\\n Ten minutes later it was two comparatively human beings who walked back up the sand to the rocks where their clothes lay, a few yards away from the cliff-fall. They were both completely naked. The rags of their underclothing lay somewhere under the pile of chalk dust, torn off in their struggle to escape. But, like survivors from a ship-wreck, their nakedness meant nothing. Washed clean of the cloying gritty chalk dust and with their hair and mouths scoured with the salt water, they felt weak and bedraggled, but by the time they had got their clothes on and had shared Gala\u0027s comb there was little to show what they had been through. \\n\\n They sat with their backs to a rock and Bond lit a first delicious cigarette, drinking the smoke deeply into his lungs and expelling it slowly through his nostrils. When Gala had done the best she could with her powder and lipstick he lit a cigarette for her and, as he handed it to her, for the first time they looked into each other\u0027s eyes and smiled. Then they sat and looked silently out to sea, at the golden panorama that was the same and yet entirely new. Bond broke the silence. \"Well, by God,\" he said. \"That was close.\" \\n\\n \"I still don\u0027t know what happened,\" said Gala. \"Except that you saved my life.\" She put her hand on his and then took it away. \\n\\n \"If you hadn\u0027t been there I should be dead,\" said Bond. \"If I\u0027d stayed where I was-\" He shrugged his shoulders. Then he turned and looked at her. \"I suppose you realize,\" he said flatly, \"that someone pushed the cliff down on us?\" She looked back at him with wide eyes. \"If we searched around in all that,\" he gestured towards the avalanche of chalk, \"we would find the marks of two or three drill-holes and traces of dynamite. I saw the smoke and I heard the bang of the explosion a split second before the cliff came down. And so did the gulls,\" he added. \\n\\n \"And what\u0027s more,\" continued Bond after a pause, \"it can\u0027t have been only Krebs. It was done in full view of the site. And it was done by several people, well organized, with spies on us from the moment we went down the cliff path to the beach.\" \\n\\n There was comprehension in Gala\u0027s eyes and a flash of fear. \"What are we to do?\" she asked anxiously. \"What\u0027s it all about?\" \\n\\n \"They want us dead,\" said Bond calmly. \"So we have to stay alive. As to what it\u0027s all about, we\u0027ll just have to find that out. \\n\\n \"You see,\" he went on, \"I\u0027m afraid even Vallance isn\u0027t going to be much help. When they made up their minds we were properly buried, they\u0027ll have got away from the top of the cliff as fast as they could. They\u0027d know that even if someone saw the cliff-fall, or heard it, they wouldn\u0027t get very excited. There are twenty miles of these cliffs and not many people come here until the summer. If the coastguards heard it they may have made a note in the log. But in the spring I expect they get plenty of falls. The winter frosts thaw out in cracks that may be hundreds of years old. So our friends would wait until we didn\u0027t turn up tonight and then get the police and coastguards to search for us. They\u0027d keep quiet until the high tide had made porridge out of a good deal of this.\" He gestured towards the shambles of fallen chalk. \"The whole scheme is admirable. And even if Vallance believes us, there\u0027s not enough evidence to make the Prime Minister interfere with the Moonraker. The damn thing\u0027s so infernally important. All the world\u0027s waiting to see if it\u0027ll work or not. And anyway, what\u0027s our story? What the hell\u0027s it all about? Some of those bloody Germans up there seem to want us dead before Friday. But what for?\" He paused. \"It\u0027s up to us, Gala. It\u0027s a lousy business but we\u0027ve simply got to solve it ourselves.\" \\n\\n He looked into her eyes. \"What about it?\" \\n\\n Gala laughed abruptly. \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" she said. \"It\u0027s what we\u0027re paid for. Of course we\u0027ll take them on. And I agree we\u0027d get nowhere with London. We\u0027d look absolutely ridiculous telephoning reports about cliffs falling on our heads. What are we doing down here anyway, fooling around without any clothes on instead of getting on with our jobs?\" \\n\\n Bond grinned. \"We only lay down for ten minutes to get dry,\" he protested mildly. \"How do you think we ought to have spent the afternoon? Taking everybody\u0027s fingerprints all over again? That\u0027s about all you police think about.\" He felt ashamed when he saw her stiffen. He held his hand up. \"I didn\u0027t really mean that,\" he said. \"But can\u0027t you see what we\u0027ve done this afternoon? Just what had to be done. We\u0027ve made the enemy show his hand. Now we\u0027ve got to take the next step and find out who the enemy is and why he wanted us out of the way. And then if we\u0027ve got enough evidence that someone\u0027s trying to sabotage the Moonraker we\u0027ll have the whole place turned inside out, the practice shoot postponed, and to hell with politics.\" \\n\\n She jumped to her feet. \"Oh, of course you\u0027re right,\" she said impatiently. \"It\u0027s just that I want to do something about it in a hurry.\" She looked for a moment out to sea, away from Bond. \"You\u0027ve only just come into the picture. I\u0027ve been living with this rocket for more than a year and I can\u0027t bear the idea that something may happen to it. So much seems to depend on it. For all of us. I want to get back there quickly and to find out who wanted to kill us. It may be nothing to do with the Moonraker, but I want to make sure.\" \\n\\n Bond stood up, showing nothing of the pain from the cuts and bruises on his back and legs. \"Come on,\" he said, \"it\u0027s nearly six o\u0027clock. The tide\u0027s coming in fast but we can get to St Margaret\u0027s before it catches us. We\u0027ll clean up at the Granville there and have a drink and some food and then we\u0027ll go back to the house in the middle of dinner. I shall be interested to see what sort of a reception we get. After that we\u0027ll have to concentrate on staying alive and seeing what we can see. Can you make it to St Margaret\u0027s?\" \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be silly,\" said Gala. \"Policewomen aren\u0027t made of gossamer.\" She gave a reluctant smile at Bond\u0027s ironically respectful \u0027Of course not\u0027, and they turned towards the distant tower of the South Foreland lighthouse and set off through the shingle. \\n\\n At half-past eight the taxi from St Margaret\u0027s dropped them at the second guard gate and they showed their passes and walked quietly up through the trees on to the expanse of concrete. They both felt keyed up and in high spirits. A hot bath and an hour\u0027s rest at the accommodating Granville had been followed by two stiff brandies-and-sodas for Gala and three for Bond followed by delicious fried soles and Welsh rarebits and coffee. And now, as they confidently approached the house, it would have needed second sight to tell that they were both dead tired and that they were naked and bruised under their walking clothes. \\n\\n They let themselves quietly in through the front door and stood for a moment in the lighted hall. A cheerful mumble of voices came from the dining-room. There was a pause followed by a burst of laughter which was dominated by the harsh bark of Sir Hugo Drax. \\n\\n Bond\u0027s mouth twisted wryly as he led the way across the hall to the door of the dining-room. Then he fixed a cheerful smile on his face and opened the door for Gala to pass through. \\n\\n Drax sat at the head of the table, festive in his plum-coloured smoking-jacket. A forkful of food, halfway to his open mouth, had stopped in mid-air as they appeared in the doorway. Unnoticed, the food slid off the fork and fell with a soft, distinct \u0027plep\u0027 on to the edge of the table. \\n\\n Krebs had been in the act of drinking a glass of red wine and the glass, frozen against his mouth, poured a thin trickle down his chin and thence on to his brown satin tie and yellow shirt. \\n\\n Dr Walter had had his back to the door and it was not until he observed the unusual behaviour of the others, the bulging eyes, the gape of the mouths, and the blood-drained faces, that he whipped his head round towards the door. His reactions, thought Bond, were slower than the others, or else his nerves were steadier. \"Ach so,\" he said softly. \"Die Engldnder.\" \\n\\n Drax was on his feet. \"My dear chap,\" he said thickly. \"My dear chap. We were really very worried. Just wondering whether to send out a search party. Few minutes ago one of the guards came in and reported there seemed to have been a cliff-fall.\" He came round towards them, his napkin in one hand and the fork still erect in the other. \\n\\n With the movement the blood surged back into his face, which became first mottled and then its usual red. \"You really might have let me know,\" he spoke to the girl, anger rising in his voice. \"Most extraordinary behaviour.\" \\n\\n \"It was my fault,\" said Bond, moving forward into the room so that he could keep them all in view. \"The walk was longer than I expected. I thought we might get caught by the tide so we went on to St Margaret\u0027s and had something to eat there and took a taxi. Miss Brand wanted to telephone but I thought we would be back before eight. You must put the blame on me. But please go ahead with your dinner. Perhaps I might join you for coffee and dessert. I expect Miss Brand would prefer to go to her room. She must be tired after her long day.\" \\n\\n Bond walked deliberately round the table and took the chair next to Krebs. Those pale eyes, he noticed, after the first shock, had been fixed firmly on his plate. As Bond came up behind him he was delighted to see a large mound of Elastoplast on the crown of Krebs\u0027s head. \\n\\n \"Yes, go to bed, Miss Brand, I will talk to you in the morning,\" said Drax testily. Gala obediently left the room and Drax went to his chair and sat heavily down. \\n\\n \"Most remarkable those cliffs,\" said Bond blithely. \"Quite awe-inspiring walking along wondering if they\u0027re going to choose just that moment to collapse on one. Reminded me of Russian roulette. And yet one never reads of people being killed by cliffs falling on them. The odds against getting hurt must be terrific.\" He paused. \"By the way, what was that you were saying about a cliff-fall just now?\" \\n\\n There was a faint groan on Bond\u0027s right, followed by a crash of glass and china as Krebs\u0027s head fell forward on to the table. \\n\\n Bond looked at him with polite curiosity. \\n\\n \"Walter,\" said Drax sharply. \"Can\u0027t you see that Krebs is ill? Take the man out and put him to bed. And don\u0027t be too soft with him. The man drinks too much. Hurry up.\" \\n\\n Walter, his face crumpled and angry, strode round the table and jerked Krebs\u0027s head out of the debris. He took him by his coat collar and hauled him to his feet and away from his chair. \\n\\n \"Du Scheisskerl,\" hissed Walter at the mottled, vacant face. \"Marsch!\" He turned him round and hustled him to the swing door into the pantry and rammed him through. There were muffled sounds of stumbling and cursing and then a door banged and there was silence. \\n\\n \"He must have had a heavy day,\" said Bond looking at Drax. \\n\\n The big man was sweating freely. He wiped his face with a circular sweep of his napkin. \"Nonsense,\" he said shortly. \"He drinks.\" \\n\\n The butler, erect and unperturbed by the apparition of Krebs and Walter in his pantry, brought in the coffee. Bond took some and sipped it. He waited for the pantry door to close again. Another German, he thought. He\u0027ll already have passed the news back to the barracks. Or perhaps all the team weren\u0027t involved. Perhaps there was a team within a team. And if so, did Drax know about it? His behaviour when Bond and Gala had come through the door had been inconclusive. Had part of his astonishment been affronted dignity, the shock of a vain man whose programme had been upset by a chit of a secretary? He had certainly covered up well. And all the afternoon he had been down the shaft supervising the fuelling. Bond decided to probe a little. \\n\\n \"How did the fuelling go?\" he asked, his eyes fixed on the other man. \\n\\n Drax was lighting a long cigar. He glanced up at Bond through the smoke and the flame of his match. \\n\\n \"Excellently.\" He puffed at the cigar to get it going. \"Everything is ready now. The guards are out. An hour or two clearing up down there in the morning and then the site will be closed. By the way,\" he added. \"I shall be taking Miss Brand up to London in the car tomorrow afternoon. I shall need a secretary as well as Krebs. Have you got any plans?\" \\n\\n \"I have to go to London too,\" said Bond on an impulse. \"I have my final report to make to the Ministry.\" \\n\\n \"Oh, really?\" said Drax casually. \"What about? I thought you were satisfied with the arrangements.\" \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Bond non-committally. \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right then,\" said Drax breezily. \"And now if you don\u0027t mind,\" he got up from the table, \"I\u0027ve got some papers waiting for me in my study. So I\u0027ll say good-night.\" \\n\\n \"Good-night,\" said Bond to the already retreating back. \\n\\n Bond finished his coffee and went out into the hall and up to his bedroom. It was obvious that it had been searched again. He shrugged his shoulders. There was only the leather case. Its contents would show nothing except that he had come equipped with the tools of his trade. \\n\\n His Beretta in its shoulder-holster was still where he had hidden it, in the empty leather case that belonged to Tallon\u0027s night-glasses. He took the gun out and slipped it under his pillow. \\n\\n He took a hot bath and used half a bottle of iodine on the cuts and bruises he could reach. Then he got into bed and turned out the light. His body hurt and he was exhausted. \\n\\n For a moment he thought of Gala. He had told her to take a sleeping pill and lock her door, but otherwise not to worry about anything until the morning. \\n\\n Before he emptied his mind for sleep he wondered uneasily about her trip with Drax the next day to London. \\n\\n Uneasily, but not desperately. In due course many questions would have to be answered and many mysteries probed, but the basic facts seemed solid and unanswerable. This extraordinary millionaire had built this great weapon. The Ministry of Supply were pleased with it and considered it sound. The Prime Minister and Parliament thought so too. The rocket was to be fired in less than thirty-six hours under full supervision and the security arrangements were as strict as they could possibly be. Somebody, and probably several people, wanted him and the girl out of the way. Nerves were stretched down here. There was a lot of tension about. Perhaps there was jealousy. Perhaps some people actually suspected them of being saboteurs. But what would that matter so long as he and Gala kept their eyes open? Not much more than a day to go. They were right out in the open here, in May, in England, in peacetime. It was crazy to worry about a few lunatics so long as the Moonraker was out of danger. And as for tomorrow, reflected Bond as sleep reached out for him, he would arrange to meet Gala in London and bring her back with him. Or she could even stay up in London for the night. Either way he would look after her until the Moonraker was safely fired and then, before work began on the Mark II weapon, there would have to be a very thorough clean-up indeed. \\n\\n But these were treacherously comforting thoughts. There was danger about and Bond knew it. \\n\\n He finally drifted into sleep with one small scene firmly fixed in his mind. \\n\\n There had been something very disquieting about the dinner-table downstairs. It had been laid for only three people. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46608.html","bookId":1274,"book":{"id":1274,"title":"007之大破太空城 MoonRaker","description":"简介： 美国运送英国太空船半途失事，引起两国警觉，英方怀疑有不法组织劫持，因此派007前去查办，007追查之下发现某种组织在制造一种神经麻痹气体，该气体是由一种极稀有的尼格拉兰花提取出来的，007前往兰花产地调查，终于发现该组织的重大阴谋，就是在太空中建立了一个太空...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/01/10-00-10-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
