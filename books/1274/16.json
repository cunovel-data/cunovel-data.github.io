{"id":28315,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI A GOLDEN DAY","content":"IT WAS a wonderful afternoon of blue and green and gold. When they left the concrete apron through the guard-gate near the empty firing-point, now connected by a thick cable with the launching site, they stopped for a moment on the edge of the great chalk cliff and stood gazing over the whole corner of England where Caesar had first landed two thousand years before. \n To their left the carpet of green turf, bright with small wildflowers, sloped gradually down to the long pebble beaches of Walmer and Deal, which curved off towards Sandwich and the Bay. Beyond, the cliffs of Margate, showing white through the distant haze that hid the North Foreland, guarded the grey scar of Manston aerodrome above which American Thunderjets wrote their white scribbles\" in the sky. Then came the Isle of Thanet and, out of sight, the mouth of the Thames. \n It was low tide and the Goodwins were golden and tender in the sparkling blue of the Straits with only the smattering of masts and spars that stretched along their length to tell the true story. The white lettering on the South Goodwins Lightship was easy to read and even the name of her sister ship to the north showed white against the red of her hull. Between the sands of the coast, along the twelve-fathom channel of the Inner Leads, there were half a dozen ships beating up through the Downs, the thud of their engines coming clearly off the quiet sea, and between the evil sands and the sharp outline of the French coast there were ships of all registries going about their business-liners, merchantmen, ungainly Dutch schuyts, and even a slim corvette hastening down south, perhaps to Portsmouth. As far as the eye could reach the Eastern Approaches of England were dotted with traffic plying towards near or distant horizons, towards a home port, or towards the other side of the world. It was a panorama full of colour and excitement and romance and the two people on the edge of the cliff were silent as they stood for a time and watched it all. \n The peace was broken by two blasts on the siren from the house and they turned to gaze back at the ugly concrete world that had been cleaned out of their minds. As they watched, a red flag was broken out above the dome of the launching site and two RAF crash-wagons with red crosses on their sides rolled out of the trees to the edge of the blast-wall and pulled up. \n \"Fuelling\u0027s going to begin,\" said Bond. \"Let\u0027s get on with our walk. There\u0027ll be nothing to see and if there happened to be something we probably wouldn\u0027t survive it at this range.\" \n She smiled at him. \"Yes,\" she said. \"And I\u0027m sick of the sight of all this concrete.\" \n They walked on down the gentle slope and were soon out of sight of the firing point and the high wire fence. \n The ice of Gala\u0027s reserve melted quickly in the sunshine. \n The exotic gaiety of her clothes, a black and white striped cotton shirt tucked into a wide hand-stitched black leather belt above a medium length skirt in shocking pink, seemed to have infected her, and it was impossible for Bond to recognize the chill woman of the night before in the girl who now walked beside him and laughed happily at his ignorance of the names of the wildflowers, the samphire, Viper\u0027s bug-loss, and fumitory round their feet. \n Triumphantly she found a bee orchis and picked it. \n \"You wouldn\u0027t do that if you knew that flowers scream when they are picked,\" said Bond. \n Gala looked at him. \"What do you mean?\" she asked, suspecting a joke. \n \"Didn\u0027t you know?\" He smiled at her reaction. \"There\u0027s an Indian called Professor Bhose, who\u0027s written a treatise on the nervous system of flowers. He measured their reaction to pain. He even recorded the scream of a rose being picked. It must be one of the most heartrending sounds in the world. I heard something like it as you picked that flower.\" \n \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" she said, looking suspiciously at the torn root. \"Anyway,\" she said maliciously, \"I wouldn\u0027t have thought you were a person to get sentimental. Don\u0027t people in your section of the Service make a business of killing? And not just flowers either. People.\" \n \"Flowers can\u0027t shoot back,\" said Bond. \n She looked at the orchis. \"Now you\u0027ve made me feel like a murderer. It\u0027s very unkind of you. But,\" she admitted reluctantly, \"I shall have to find out about this Indian and if you\u0027re right I shall never pick a flower again as long as I live. What am I to going to do with this one? You make me feel it\u0027s bleeding all over my hands.\" \n \"Give it to me,\" said Bond. \"According to you, my hands are dripping with blood already. A little more won\u0027t hurt.\" \n She handed it to him and their hands touched. \"You can stick it in the muzzle of your revolver,\" she said to cover the flash of contact. \n Bond laughed. \"So the eyes aren\u0027t only for decoration,\" he said. \"Anyway it\u0027s an automatic and I left it in my room.\" He drew the stalk of the flower through one of the button holes in his blue cotton shirt. \"I thought a shoulder-holster would look a bit conspicuous without a coat to cover it. And I don\u0027t think anyone will be going over my room this afternoon.\" \n By tacit agreement they edged away from the moment of warmth. Bond told her of his discovery of Krebs and of the scene in his bedroom. \n \"Serves him right,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve never trusted him. But what did Sir Hugo say?\" \n \"I had a word with him before lunch,\" said Bond. \"Gave him Krebs\u0027s knife and keys as proof. He was furious and went straight off to see the man, muttering with rage. When he came back he said that Krebs seemed to be in a pretty bad way and was I satisfied that he\u0027d been punished enough? All that business about not wanting to upset the team at the last moment and so forth. So I agreed that he\u0027d be sent back to Germany next week and that meanwhile he would consider himself under open arrest-only allowed out of his room under surveillance.\" \n They scrambled down a steep cliff-path to the beach and turned to the right beside the deserted small-arms range of the Royal Marine Garrison at Deal. They walked along in silence until they came to the two-mile stretch of shingle that runs at low tide beneath the towering white cliffs to St Margaret\u0027s Bay. \n As they trudged slowly through the deep smooth pebbles Bond told her of all that had gone through his mind since the previous day. He held nothing back and he showed each false hare as it had been started and finally run to earth, leaving nothing but a thin scent of ill-founded suspicions and a muddle of clues that all ended in the same question mark… where was a pattern? Where was a plan into which the clues would fit? And always the same answer, that nothing Bond knew or suspected seemed to have any conceivable bearing on the security from sabotage of the Moonraker. And that, when all was said and done, was the only matter with which he and the girl were concerned. Not with the death of Tallon and Bartsch, not with the egregious Krebs, but only with the protection of the whole Moonraker project from its possible enemies. \n \"Isn\u0027t that so?\" Bond concluded. \n Gala stopped and stood for a moment looking out across the tumbled rocks and seaweed towards the quiet glimmering swell of the sea. She was hot and out of breath from the hard going through the shingle and she thought how wonderful it would be to bathe-to step back for a moment into those childish days beside the sea before her life had been caught up in this strange cold profession with its tensions and hollow thrills. She glanced at the ruthless brown face of the man beside her. Did he have moments of longing for the peaceful simple things of life? Of course not. He liked Paris and Berlin and New York and trains and aeroplanes and expensive food, and, yes certainly, expensive women. \n \"Well?\" said Bond, wondering if she was going to come out with some piece of evidence that he had overlooked. \"What do you think?\" \n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Gala. \"I was dreaming. No,\" she answered his question. \"I think you\u0027re right. I\u0027ve been down here since the beginning and although there\u0027ve been odd little things from time to time, and of course the shooting, I\u0027ve seen absolutely nothing wrong. Every one of the team, from Sir Hugo down, is heart and soul behind the rocket. It\u0027s all they live for and it\u0027s been wonderful to see the whole thing grow. The Germans are terrific workers-and I can quite believe that Bartsch broke under the strain-and they love being driven by Sir Hugo and he loves driving them. They worship him. And as for security, the place is solid with it and I\u0027m sure that anyone who tried to get near the Moonraker would be torn to pieces. I agree with you about Krebs and that he was probably working under Drax\u0027s orders. It was because I believed that, that I didn\u0027t bother to report him when he went through my things. There was nothing for him to find, of course. Just private letters and so on. It would be typical of Sir Hugo to make absolutely sure. And I must say,\" she said candidly, \"that I admire him for it. He\u0027s a ruthless man with deplorable manners and not a very nice face under all that red hair, but I love working for him and I\u0027m longing for the Moonraker to be a success. Living with it for so long has made me feel just like his men do about it.\" \n She looked up to see his reactions. \n He nodded. \"After only a day I can understand that,\" he said. \"And I suppose I agree with you. There\u0027s nothing to go on except my intuition and that will have to look after itself. The main thing is that the Moonraker looks as safe as the Crown Jewels, and probably safer.\" He shrugged his shoulders impatiently, dissatisfied with himself for disowning the intuitions that were so much of his trade. \"Come on,\" he said, almost roughly. \"We\u0027re wasting time.\" \n Understanding, she smiled to herself and followed. \n Round the next bend of the cliff they came up with the base of the hoist, encrusted with seaweed and barnacles. Fifty yards further on they reached the jetty, a strong tubular iron frame paved with latticed iron strips that ran out over the rocks and beyond. \n Between the two, and perhaps twenty feet up the cliff face, yawned the wide black mouth of the exhaust tunnel which slanted up inside the cliff to the steel floor beneath the stern of the rocket. From the under-lip of the cave melted chalk drooled like lava and there were splashes of the stuff all over the pebbles and rocks below. In his mind\u0027s eye Bond could see the blazing white shaft of flame come howling out of the face of the cliff and he could hear the sea hiss and bubble as the liquid chalk poured into the water. \n He looked up at the narrow section of the launching dome that showed above the edge of the cliff two hundred feet up in the sky, and imagined the four men in their gas-masks and asbestos suits watching the gauges as the terrible liquid explosive pulsed down the black rubber tube into the stomach of the rocket. He suddenly realized that they were in range if anything went wrong with the fuelling. \n \"Let\u0027s get away from here,\" he said to the girl. \n When they had put a hundred yards between themselves and the cave Bond stopped and looked back. He imagined himself with six tough men and all the right gear, and he wondered how he would set about attacking the site from the sea-kyaks to the jetty at low tide; a ladder to the lip of the cave? and then what? Impossible to climb the polished steel walls of the exhaust tunnel. It would be a question of firing an anti-tank weapon through the steel floor beneath the rocket, following up with some phosphorus shells and hoping that something would catch fire. Untidy business, but it might be effective. Getting away afterwards would be nasty. Sitting targets from the top of the cliff. But that wouldn\u0027t worry a Russian suicide squad. It was all quite feasible. \n Gala had been standing beside him watching the eyes that measured and speculated. \"It\u0027s not as easy as you might think,\" she said, seeing the frown on his face. \"Even when it\u0027s high tide and very rough they have guards along the top of the cliff at night. And they\u0027ve got searchlights and Brens and grenades. Their orders are to shoot and ask questions afterwards. Of course it would be better to floodlight the cliff at night. But that would only pinpoint the site. I really believe they\u0027ve thought of everything.\" \n Bond was still frowning. \"If they had covering fire from a submarine or an X-craft, a good team could still do it,\" he said. \"It\u0027ll be hell, but I\u0027m going for a swim. The Admiralty chart says there\u0027s a twelve-fathom channel out there, but I\u0027d like to have a look. There must be plenty of water at the end of the jetty but I\u0027ll be happier when I\u0027ve seen for myself.\" He smiled at her. \"Why don\u0027t you have a bathe too? It\u0027s going to be dam\u0027 cold, but it would do you good after stewing inside that concrete dome all the morning.\" \n Gala\u0027s eyes lit up. \"Do you think I could?\" she asked doubtfully. \"I\u0027m frightfully hot. But what are we going to wear?\" She blushed at the thought of her brief and almost transparent nylon pants and brassiere. \n \"To hell with that,\" said Bond airily. \"You must have got some bits and pieces on underneath and I\u0027ve got pants on. We shall be perfectly respectable and there\u0027s no one to see, and I promise not to look,\" he lied cheerfully, leading the way round the next bend in the cliff. \"You undress behind that rock and I\u0027ll use this one,\" he said. \"Come on. Don\u0027t be a goose. It\u0027s all in the line of duty.\" \n Without waiting for her to answer he moved behind the tall rock, taking off his shirt as he did so. \n \"Oh, well,\" said Gala, relieved to have the decision taken out of her hands. She went behind her rock and slowly unbuttoned her skirt. \n When she peered nervously out, Bond was already halfway down the strip of coarse brown sand that led out among the pools to where the incoming tide eddied through the green and black moraine of the rocks. He looked lithe and brown. The blue pants were reassuring. \n Gingerly she followed him, and then suddenly she was in the water. At once nothing else mattered but the velvet ice of the sea and the beauty of the patches of sand between the waving hair of the seaweed that she could see in the clear green depths below her as she buried her head and swam along parallel with the shore in a fast crawl. \n When she was level with the jetty she stopped for a moment to get her breath. There was no sign of Bond whom she had last seen streaking along a hundred yards ahead of her. She trod water hard to keep up her circulation and then started back again, unwillingly thinking of him, thinking of the hard brown body that must be somewhere near her, among the rocks, perhaps, or diving to the sand to gauge the depth of water that would be available to an enemy. \n She turned back to look for him again and it was then that he suddenly surged up from the sea beneath her. She felt the quick tight clasp of his arms round her and the swift hard impact of his lips on hers. \n \"Damn you,\" she said furiously, but already he had dived again and by the time she had spat out a mouthful of sea-water and got her bearings he was swimming blithely twenty yards away. \n She turned and swam aloofly out to sea, feeling rather ridiculous but determined to snub him. It was just as she had thought. These Secret Service people always seemed to have time for sex however important their jobs might be. \n But her body obstinately tingled with the shock of the kiss and the golden day seemed to have taken on a new beauty. As she swam further out to sea and then turned back and looked along the snarling milk-white teeth of England to the distant arm of Dover and at the black and white confetti of the ravens and gulls tossed against the vivid backcloth of green fields, she decided that anything was permissible on such a day and that, just this once, she would forgive him. \n Half an hour later they were lying, waiting for the sun to dry them, separated by a respectable yard of sand at the foot of the cliff. \n The kiss had not been mentioned, but Gala\u0027s efforts to preserve an atmosphere of aloofness had collapsed under the excitement of examining a lobster that Bond had dived for and caught with his hands. Reluctantly they put it back into one of the rockpools and watched it scuttle backwards into the shelter of the seaweed. And now they lay, tired and exhilarated by their icy swim, and prayed that the sun would not slip behind the clifftop high above their heads before they were warm and dry enough to get back into their clothes. \n But those were not Bond\u0027s only thoughts. The beautiful strapping body of the girl beside him, incredibly erotic in the tight emphasis of the clinging brassiere and pants, came between him and his concern about the Moonraker. And anyway there was nothing he could do about the Moonraker for another hour. It was not yet five o\u0027clock and the fuelling would not be finished until after six. It would only be then that he could get hold of Drax and make certain that for the next two nights the guards were strengthened on the cliff and that they had the right weapons. For he had seen for himself that there was plenty of water, even at low tide, for a submarine. \n So there was at least a quarter of an hour to spare before they would have to start back. \n Meanwhile this girl. The half-stripped body splayed above him on the surface as he swam up from below; the soft-hard quick kiss with his arms about her; the pointed hillocks of her breasts, so close to him, and the soft flat stomach descending to the mystery of her tightly closed thighs. \n To hell with it. \n He wrenched his mind out of its fever and gazed straight up into the endless blue of the sky, forcing himself to watch the soaring beauty of the herring gulls as they ranged effortlessly among the air currents that fountained up over the high clifftop above them. But the soft down of the birds\u0027 white underbellies seduced his thoughts back to her and gave him no rest. \n \"Why are you called Gala?\" he said to break his hot crouching thoughts. \n She laughed. \"I was teased about it all through school,\" she said, and Bond was impatient at the easy, clear voice, \"and then through the Wrens and then by half the police force of London. But my real name\u0027s even worse. It\u0027s Galatea. She was a cruiser my father was serving in when I was born. I suppose Gala\u0027s not too bad. I\u0027ve almost forgotten what I\u0027m called. I\u0027m always having to change my name now that I\u0027m in the Special Branch.\" \n \"In the Special Branch.\" \n \"In the Special Branch.\" \n \"In the…\" \n When the bomb falls. When the pilot miscalculates and the plane hits short of the runway. When the blood leaves the heart and consciousness goes, there are thoughts in the mind, or words, or perhaps a phrase of music, which ring on for the few seconds before death like the dying clang of a bell. \n Bond wasn\u0027t killed, but the words were still in his mind, several seconds later, after it had all happened. \n Ever since they had lain down on the sand up against the cliff, while his thoughts had been of Gala, his eyes had been carelessly watching two gulls playing around a wisp of straw that was the edge of their nest on a small ledge about ten feet below the distant top of the cliff. They would crane and bow in their love-play, with only their heads visible to Bond against the dazzling white of the chalk, and then the male would soar out and away and at once back to the ledge to take up his love-making again. \n Bond was dreamily watching them as he listened to the girl, when suddenly both gulls dashed away from the ledge with a single shrill scream of fear. At the same moment there was a puff of black smoke and a soft boom from the top of the cliff and a great section of the white chalk directly above Bond and Gala seemed to sway outwards, zigzag cracks snaking down its face. \n The next thing Bond knew was that he was lying on top of Gala, his face pressed into her cheek, that the air was full of thunder, that his breath was stifled and that the sun had gone out. His back was numb and aching under a great weight and in his left ear, besides the echo of the thunder, there was the end of a choking scream. \n He was barely conscious and he had to wait until his senses came halfway back to life. \n The Special Branch. What was it she had said about the Special Branch? \n He made frantic efforts to move. Only in his right arm, the arm nearest to the cliff, was there any play at all, but as he jerked his shoulder the arm became freer until at last, with a great backward heave, light and air reached down to them. Retching in the fog of chalk-dust, he widened the hole until his head could take its crushing weight off Gala. He felt the feeble movement as she turned her head sideways towards the light and air. A growing trickle of dust and stones into the hole he had cleared made him dig fiercely again. Gradually he enlarged the space until he could get a purchase on his right elbow and then, coughing so that he thought his lungs would burst, he heaved his right shoulder up until suddenly it and his head were free. \n His first thought was that there had been an explosion in the Moonraker. He looked up at the cliff and then along the shore. No. They were a hundred yards from the site. It was only in the skyline directly above them that a great mouthful had been bitten out of the cliff. \n Then he thought of their immediate danger. Gala moaned and he could feel the frantic thud of her heart against his chest, but the ghastly white mask of her face was now free to the air and he wrenched his body from side to side on top of her to try and ease the pressure on her lungs and stomach. Slowly, inch by inch, his muscles cracking under the strain, he worked his way under the pile of dust and rubble towards the cliff face where he knew the weight would be less. \n And then at last his chest was free and he could snake his body into a kneeling position beside her. Blood dripped from his cut back and arms and mingled with the chalk dust that continually poured down the sides of the hole he had made, but he could feel that no bones were broken and, in the rage of the rescue work, he felt no pain. \n Grunting and coughing and without a pause to take breath he heaved her up into a sitting position and with a bleeding hand wiped some of the chalk dust from her face. Then, freeing his legs from the tomb of chalk, he somehow manhandled her up on to the top of the mound with her back against the cliff. \n He knelt and looked at her, at the terrible white scarecrow that minutes before had been one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen, and as he looked at her and at the streaks of his blood down her face he prayed that her eyes would open. \n When, seconds later, they did, the relief was so great that Bond turned away and was rackingly sick. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46607.html","bookId":1274,"book":{"id":1274,"title":"007之大破太空城 MoonRaker","description":"简介： 美国运送英国太空船半途失事，引起两国警觉，英方怀疑有不法组织劫持，因此派007前去查办，007追查之下发现某种组织在制造一种神经麻痹气体，该气体是由一种极稀有的尼格拉兰花提取出来的，007前往兰花产地调查，终于发现该组织的重大阴谋，就是在太空中建立了一个太空...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/01/10-00-10-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
