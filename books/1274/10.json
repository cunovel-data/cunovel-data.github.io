{"id":28309,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X SPECIAL BRANCH AGENT","content":"AT six o\u0027clock that Tuesday evening towards the end of May, James Bond was thrashing the big Bentley down the Dover road along the straight stretch that runs into Maidstone. \\n\\n Although he was driving fast and with concentration, part of his mind was going back over his movements since he had left M.\u0027s office four and a half hours earlier. \\n\\n After giving a brief outline of the case to his secretary and eating a quick lunch at a table to himself in the canteen, he had told the garage for God\u0027s sake to hurry up with his car and deliver it, filled up, to his flat not later than four o\u0027clock. Then he had taken a taxi down to Scotland Yard where he had an appointment with Assistant Commissioner Vallance at a quarter to three. \\n\\n The courtyards and cul-de-sacs of the Yard had reminded him as usual of a prison without roofs. The overhead strip lighting in the cold corridor took the colour out of the cheeks of the police sergeant who asked his business and watched him sign the apple-green chit. It did the same for the face of the constable who led him up the short steps and along the bleak passage between the rows of anonymous doors to the waiting-room. \\n\\n A quiet, middle-aged woman with the resigned eyes of someone who had seen everything came in and said the Assistant Commissioner would be free in five minutes. Bond had gone to the window and had looked out into the grey courtyard below. A constable, looking naked without his helmet, had come out of a building and walked across the yard munching a split roll with something pink between the two halves. It had been very quiet and the noise of the traffic on Whitehall and on the Embankment had sounded far away. Bond had felt dispirited. He was getting tangled up with strange departments. He would be out of touch with his own people and his own Service routines. Already, in this waiting-room, he felt out of his element. Only criminals or informers came and waited here, or influential people vainly trying to get out of a dangerous driving charge or desperately hoping to persuade Vallance that their sons were not really homosexuals. You could not be in the waiting-room of the Special Branch for any innocent purpose. You were either prosecuting or defending. \\n\\n At last the woman came for him. He stubbed out his cigarette in the top of the Player\u0027s cigarette tin that serves as an ashtray in the waiting-rooms of government departments, and followed her across the corridor. \\n\\n After the gloom of the waiting-room the unseasonable fire in the hearth of the large cheerful room had seemed like a trick, like the cigarette offered you by the Gestapo. \\n\\n It had taken Bond a full five minutes to shake off his depression and realize that Ronnie Vallance was relieved to see him, that he was not interested in inter-departmental jealousies and that he was only looking to Bond to protect the Moonraker and get one of his best officers out of what might be a bad mess. \\n\\n Vallance was a man of great tact. For the first few minutes he had spoken only of M. And he had spoken with inside knowledge and with sincerity. Without even mentioning the case he had gained Bond\u0027s friendship and co-operation. \\n\\n As Bond swung the Bentley through the crowded streets of Maidstone he reflected that Vallance\u0027s gift had come from twenty years of avoiding the corns of MI5, of working in with the uniformed branch of the police, and of handling ignorant politicians and affronted foreign diplomats. \\n\\n When Bond had left him after a quarter of an hour\u0027s hard talking, each man knew that he had acquired an ally. Vallance had seized up Bond and knew that Gala Brand would get all Bond\u0027s help and whatever protection she needed. He also respected Bond\u0027s professional approach to the assignment and his absence of departmental rivalry with the Special Branch. As for Bond, he was full of admiration for what he had learned about Vallance\u0027s agent, and he felt that he was no longer naked and that he had Vallance and the whole of Vallance\u0027s department behind him. \\n\\n Bond had left Scotland Yard with the feeling that he had achieved Clausewitz\u0027s first principle. He had made his base secure. \\n\\n His visit to the Ministry of Supply had added nothing to his knowledge of the case. He had studied Tallon\u0027s record and his reports. The former was quite straightforward-a lifetime in Army Intelligence and Field Security-and the latter painted a picture of a very lively and well-managed technical establishment-one or two cases of drunkenness, one of petty theft, several personal vendettas leading to fights and mild bloodshed but otherwise a loyal and hardworking team of men. \\n\\n Then he had had an inadequate half-hour in the Operations Room of the Ministry with Professor Train, a fat, scruffy, undistinguished-looking man who had been runner-up for the Physics Division of the Nobel Prize the year before and who was one of the greatest experts on guided missiles in the world. \\n\\n Professor Train had walked up to a row of huge wall maps and had pulled down the cord of one of them. Bond was faced with a ten-foot horizontal scale diagram of some thing that looked like a V2 with big fins. \\n\\n \"Now,\" said Professor Train, \"you know nothing about - rockets so I\u0027m going to put this in simple terms and not fill you up with a lot of stuff about Nozzle Expansion Ratios, Exhaust Velocity, and the Keplerian Ellipse. The Moon-raker, as Drax chooses to call it, is a single-stage rocket. It uses up all its fuel shooting itself into the air and then it homes on to the objective. The V2\u0027s trajectory was more like a shell fired from a gun. At the top of it\u0027s 200-mile flight it had climbed to about 70 miles. It was fuelled with a very combustible mixture of alcohol and liquid oxygen which was watered down so as not to burn out the mild steel which was all they were allocated for the engine. There are far more powerful fuels available but until now we hadn\u0027t been able to achieve very much with them for the same reason, their combustion temperature is so high that they would burn out the toughest engine.\" \\n\\n The professor paused and stuck a finger in Bond\u0027s chest. \"All you, my dear sir, have to remember about this rocket is that, thanks to Drax\u0027s Columbite, which has a melting point of about 3500 degrees Centigrade, compared with 1300 in the V2 engines, we can use one of the super fuels without burning out the engine. In fact,\" he looked at Bond as if Bond should be impressed, \"we are using fluorine and hydrogen.\" \\n\\n \"Oh, really,\" said Bond reverently. \\n\\n The Professor looked at him sharply. \"So we hope to achieve a speed in the neighbourhood of 1500 miles an hour and a vertical range of about 1000 miles. This should produce an operational range of about 4000 miles, bringing every European capital within reach of England. Very useful,\" he added drily, \"in certain circumstances. But, for the scientists, chiefly desirable as a step towards escape from the earth. Any questions?\" \\n\\n \"How does it work?\" asked Bond dutifully. \\n\\n The Professor gestured brusquely towards the diagram. \"Let\u0027s start from the nose,\" he said. \"First comes the warhead. For the practice shoot this will contain upper-atmosphere instruments, radar and suchlike. Then the gyro compasses to make it fly straight-pitch-and-yaw gyro and roll gyro. Then various minor instruments, servo motors, power supply. And then the big fuel tanks-30,000 pounds of the stuff. \\n\\n \"At the stern you get two small tanks to drive the turbine. Four hundred pounds of hydrogen peroxide mixes with forty pounds of potassium permanganate and makes steam which drives the turbines underneath them. These drive a set of centrifugal pumps which force the main fuel into the rocket motor. Under terrific pressure. Do you follow me?\" He cocked a dubious eyebrow at Bond. \\n\\n \"Sounds much the same principle as a jet plane,\" said Bond. \\n\\n The Professor seemed pleased. \"More or less,\" he said, \"but the rocket carries all its fuel inside it, instead of sucking in oxygen from outside like the Comet. Well then,\" he continued, \"the fuel gets ignited in the motor and squirts out at the end in a continuous blast. Rather like a continuous recoil from a gun. And this blast forces the rocket into the air like any other firework. Of course it\u0027s at the stern that the Columbite comes in. It\u0027s allowed us to make a motor that won\u0027t be melted by .the fantastic heat. And then,\" he pointed, \"those are the tail fins to keep it steady at the beginning of its flight. Also made of Columbite alloy or they\u0027d break away with the colossal air pressure. Anything else?\" \\n\\n \"How can you be certain it\u0027ll come down where you mean it to?\" asked Bond. \"What\u0027s to prevent it falling on The Hague next Friday?\" \\n\\n \"The gyros will see to that. But as a matter of fact we\u0027re taking no chances on Friday and we\u0027re using a radar homing device on a raft in the middle of the sea. There\u0027ll be a radar transmitter in the nose of the rocket which will pick up an echo from our gadget in the sea and home on to it automatically. Of course,\" the Professor grinned, \"if we ever had to use the thing in wartime it would be a great help to have a homing device transmitting energy from the middle of Moscow or Warsaw or Prague or Monte Carlo or wherever we might be shooting at. It\u0027ll probably be up to you chaps to get one there. Good luck to you.\" \\n\\n Bond smiled non-committally. \"One more question,\" he said. \"If you wanted to sabotage the rocket what would be the easiest way?\" \\n\\n \"Any number,\" said the Professor cheerfully. \"Sand in the fuel. Grit in the pumps. A small hole anywhere on the fuselage or the fins. With that power and at those speeds the smallest fault would finish it.\" \\n\\n \"Thanks very much,\" said Bond. \"It seems you\u0027ve got fewer worries about the Moonraker than I have.\" \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a wonderful machine,\" said the Professor. \"She\u0027ll fly all right if nobody interferes with her. Drax has done a sound job. Wonderful organizer. That\u0027s a brilliant team he put together. And they\u0027ll do anything for him. We\u0027ve got a lot to thank him for.\" \\n\\n Bond did a racing change and swung the big car left at the Charing fork, preferring the clear road by Chilham and Canterbury to the bottlenecks of Ashford and Folkestone. The car howled up to eighty in third and he held it in the same gear to negotiate the hairpin at the top of the long gradient leading up to the Molash road. \\n\\n And, he wondered, going back into top and listening with satisfaction to the relaxed thunder of the exhaust, and what about Drax? What sort of a reception was Drax going to give him this evening? According to M., when his name had been suggested over the telephone, Drax had paused for a moment and then said, \"Oh yes. I know the fellow. Didn\u0027t know he was mixed up in that racket. I\u0027d be interested to have another look at him. Send him along. I\u0027ll expect him in time for dinner.\" Then he had rung off. \\n\\n The people at the Ministry had their own view of Drax. In their dealings with him they had found him a dedicated man, completely bound up in the Moonraker, living for nothing but its success, driving his men to the limit, fighting for priorities in material with other departments, goading the Ministry of Supply into clearing his requirements at Cabinet level. They disliked his hectoring manners but they respected him for his know-how and his drive and his dedication. And, like the rest of England, they considered him a possible saviour of the country. \\n\\n Well, thought Bond, accelerating down the straight stretch of road past Chilham Castle, he could see that picture too and if he was going to work with the man he must adjust himself to the heroic version. If Drax was willing, he would put the whole affair at Blades out of his mind and concentrate on protecting Drax and his wonderful project from their country\u0027s enemies. There were only about three days to go. The security precautions were already minute and Drax might resent suggestions for increasing them. It was not going to be easy and a great deal of tact would have to be used. Tact. Not Bond\u0027s long suit and not, he reflected, connected in any way with that he knew of Drax\u0027s character. \\n\\n Bond took the short cut out of Canterbury by the Old Dover road and looked at his watch. It was six-thirty. Another fifteen minutes to Dover and then another ten minutes along the Deal road. Were there any other plans to be made? The double killing was out of his hands, thank heaven. \u0027Murder and suicide while of unsound mind\u0027 had been the coroner\u0027s verdict. The girl had not even been called. He would stop for a drink at the \u0027World Without Want\u0027 and have a quick word with the innkeeper, The next day he would have to try and smell out the \u0027something fishy\" that Tallon had wanted to see the Minister about. No clue about that. Nothing had been found in Tallon\u0027s room, which presumably he would now be taking over. Well, at any rate that would give him plenty of leisure to go through Tallon\u0027s papers. \\n\\n Bond concentrated on his driving as he coasted down into Dover. He kept left and was soon climbing out of the town again past the wonderful cardboard castle. \\n\\n There was a patch of low cloud on top of the hill and a spit of rain on his windshield. There was a cold breeze coming in from the sea. The visibility was bad and he switched on his lights as he motored slowly along the coast-road, the ruby-spangled masts of the Swingate radar station rising like petrified Roman candles on his right. \\n\\n The girl? He would have to be careful how he contacted her and careful not to upset her. He wondered if she would be any use to him. After a year on the site she would have had all the opportunities of a private secretary to \u0027The Chief to get under the skin of the whole project-and of Drax. And she had a mind trained to his own particular craft. But he would have to be prepared for her to be suspicious of the new broom and perhaps resentful. He wondered what she was really like. The photograph on her record-sheet at the Yard had shown an attractive but rather severe girl and any hint of seductiveness had been abstracted by the cheerless jacket of her policewoman\u0027s uniform. \\n\\n Hair : Auburn. Eyes : Blue. Height: 5 ft 7. Weight: 9 stone. Hips: 38. Waist: 26. Bust: 38. Distinguishing marks : Mole on upper curvature of right breast. \\n\\n Hm! thought Bond. \\n\\n He put the statistics out of his mind as he came to the turning to the right. There was a signpost that said Kingsdown, and the lights of a small inn. \\n\\n He pulled up and switched off the engine. Above his head a sign which said \u0027World Without Want\" in faded gold lettering groaned in the salt breeze that came over the cliffs half a mile away. He got out, stretched and walked over to the door of the public bar. It was locked. Closed for cleaning? He tried the next door, which opened and gave access to the small private bar. Behind the bar a stolid-looking man in shirt-sleeves was reading an evening paper. \\n\\n He looked up as Bond entered, and put his paper down. \"Evening, sir,\" he said, evidently relieved to see a customer. \\n\\n \"Evening,\" said Bond. \"Large whisky and soda, please.\" \\n\\n He sat up at the bar and waited while the man poured two measures of Black and White and put the glass in front of him with a syphon of soda. \\n\\n Bond filled the glass with soda and drank. \"Bad business you had here last night,\" he said, putting the glass down. \\n\\n \"Terrible, sir,\" said the man. \"And bad for trade. Would you be from the Press, sir? Had nothing but reporters and policemen in and out of the house all day long.\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said Bond. \"I\u0027ve come to take over the job of the fellow who got shot. Major Tallon. Was he one of your regular customers?\" \\n\\n \"Never came here but the once, sir, and that was the end. of him. Now I\u0027ve been put out of bounds for a week and the public has got to be painted from top to bottom. But I will say that Sir Hugo has been very decent about it. Sent me fifty quid this afternoon to pay for the damage. He must be a fine gentleman that. Made himself well liked in these parts. Always very generous and a cheery word for all.\" \\n\\n \"Yes. Fine man,\" said Bond. \"Did you see it all happen?\" \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t see the first shot, sir. Serving a pint at the time. Then of course I looked up. Dropped the ruddy pint on the floor.\" \\n\\n \"What happened then?\" \\n\\n \"Well, everybody\u0027s standing back of course. Nothing but Germans in the place. About a dozen of them. There\u0027s the body on the floor and the chap with the gun looking down at him. Then suddenly he stands to attention and sticks his left arm up in the air. \u0027Eil!\u0027 he shouts like the silly bastards used to do during the war. Then he puts the end of the gun in his mouth. Next thing,\" the man made a grimace, \"he\u0027s all over my ruddy ceiling.\" \\n\\n \"That was all he said after the shot?\" asked Bond, \"Just \u0027Heil\u0027?\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all, sir. Don\u0027t seem to be able to forget the bloody word, do they?\" \\n\\n \"No,\" said Bond thoughtfully, \"they certainly don\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46601.html","bookId":1274,"book":{"id":1274,"title":"007之大破太空城 MoonRaker","description":"简介： 美国运送英国太空船半途失事，引起两国警觉，英方怀疑有不法组织劫持，因此派007前去查办，007追查之下发现某种组织在制造一种神经麻痹气体，该气体是由一种极稀有的尼格拉兰花提取出来的，007前往兰花产地调查，终于发现该组织的重大阴谋，就是在太空中建立了一个太空...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/01/10-00-10-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
