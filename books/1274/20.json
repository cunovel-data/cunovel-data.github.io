{"id":28319,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX DRAX\u0027S GAMBIT","content":"THERE WERE three separate sources of pain in Gala\u0027s body. The throbbing ache behind her left ear, the bite of the flex at her wrists, and the chafing of the strap round her ankles. \n Every bump in the road, every swerve, every sudden pressure of Drax\u0027s foot on the brakes or the accelerator awoke one or another of these pains and rasped at her nerves. If only she had been wedged into the back seat more tightly. But there was just room enough for her body to roll a few inches on the occasional seat so that she was constantly having to twist her bruised face away from contact with the walls of shiny pig-skin. \n The air she breathed was stuffy with a smell of new leather upholstery, exhaust fumes, and the occasional sharp stench of burning rubber as Drax flayed the tyres on a sharp corner. \n And yet the discomfort and pain were nothing. \n Krebs! Curiously enough her fear and loathing of Krebs tormented her most. The other things were too big. The mystery of Drax and his hatred of England. The riddle of his perfect command of German. The Moonraker. The secret of the atomic warhead. How to save London. These were matters which she had long ago put away in the back of her mind as insoluble. \n But the afternoon alone with Krebs was present and dreadful and her mind went back and back to the details of it like a tongue to an aching tooth. \n Long after Drax had gone she had kept up her pretence of unconsciousness. At first Krebs had occupied himself with the machines, talking to them in German in a cooing baby-talk. \"There, my Liebchen. That\u0027s better now, isn\u0027t it? A drop of oil for you, my Pupperl? But certainly. Coming up at once. No, no, lazybones. I said a thousand revolutions. Not nine hundred. Come along now. We can do better than that, can\u0027t we. Yes, my Schatz. That\u0027s it. Round and round we go. Up and down. Round and round. Let me wipe your pretty face for you so that we can see what the little dial is saying. Jesu Maria, hist du ein braves Kind!\" \n And so it had gone on with intervals of standing in front of Gala, picking his nose and sucking his teeth in a horribly ruminative way. Until he stayed longer and longer in front of her, forgetting the machines, wondering, making up his mind. \n And then she had felt his hand undo the top button of her dress and the automatic recoil of her body had had to be covered by a realistic groan and a pantomime of consciousness returning. \n She had asked for water and he had gone into a bathroom and fetched some for her in a toothglass. Then he had pulled a kitchen chair up in front of her and had sat down astride it, his chin resting on the top rail of its back, and had gazed at her speculatively from under his pale drooping lids. \n She had been the first to break the silence. \"Why have I been brought here?\" she asked. \"What are all those machines?\" \n He licked his lips and the little pouting red mouth opened under the smudge of yellow moustache and formed itself slowly into a rhomboid-shaped smile. \"That is a lure for little birds,\" he said. \"Soon it will lure a little bird into this warm nest. Then the little bird will lay an egg. Oh, such a big round egg! Such a beautiful fat egg.\" The lower half of his face giggled with delight while his eyes mooned. \"And the pretty girl is here because otherwise she might frighten the little bird away. And that would be so sad, wouldn\u0027t it,\" he spat out the next three words, \"filthy English bitch?\" \n His eyes became intent and purposeful. He hitched his chair nearer so that his face was only a foot away from hers and she was enveloped in the miasma of his breath. \"Now, English bitch. Who are you working for?\" He waited. \"You must answer me, you know,\" he said softly. \"We are all alone here. There is no one to hear you scream.\" \n \"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" said Gala desperately. \"How could I be working for anyone except Sir Hugo?\" (Krebs smiled at the name.) \"I was just curious about the flight plan…\" she went into a rambling explanation about her figures and Drax\u0027s figures and how she had wanted to share in the success of the Moonraker. \n \"Try again,\" whispered Krebs when she had finished. \"You must do better than that,\" and suddenly his eyes had turned hot with cruelty and his hands had reached towards her from behind the back of his chair… \n In the rear of the hurtling Mercedes Gala ground her teeth together and whimpered at the memory of the soft crawling fingers on her body, probing, pinching, pulling, while all the time the hot vacant eyes gazed curiously into hers until finally she gathered the saliva in her mouth and spat full in his face. \n He hadn\u0027t even paused to wipe his face, but suddenly he had really hurt her and she had screamed once and then mercifully fainted. \n And then she had found herself being pushed into the back of the car, a rug was thrown over her, and they were hurtling through the streets of London and she could hear other cars near them, the frantic ringing of a bicycle bell, an occasional shout, the animal growl of an old klaxon, the whirring putter of a motor-scooter, a scream of brakes, and she had realized that she was back in the real world, that English people, friends, were all around her. She had struggled to get to her knees and scream, but Krebs must have felt her movement because his hands were suddenly at her ankles, strapping them to the foot-rail along the floor, and she knew that she was lost and suddenly the tears were pouring down her cheeks and she was praying that somehow, somebody would be in time. \n That had been less than an hour ago and now she could tell from the slow pace of the car and the noise of other traffic that they had reached a large town-Maidstone if she was being taken back to the site. \n In the comparative silence of their progress through the town she suddenly heard Krebs\u0027s voice. There was a note of urgency in it. \n \"Mein Kapitдn\" he said. \"I have been watching a car for some time. It is certainly following us. It has seldom been using its lights. It is only a hundred metres behind us now. I think it is the car of Commander Bond.\" \n Drax grunted with surprise and she could hear his big body shift round to get a quick look. \n He swore sharply and then there was silence and she could feel the big car weaving and straining in the thin traffic. \"Ja, sowas!\" said Drax finally. His voice was thoughtful. \"So that old museum-piece of his can still move. So much the better, my dear Krebs. He seems to be alone.\" He laughed harshly. \"So we will give him a run for his money and if he survives it we will get him in the bag with the woman. Turn on the radio. Home Service. We will soon find out if there is a hitch.\" \n There was a short crackle of static and then Gala could hear the voice of the Prime Minister, the voice of all the great occasions in her life, coming through in broken fragments as Drax put the car into third and accelerated out of the town, \u0027… weapon devised by the ingenuity of man… a thousand miles into the firmament… area patrolled by Her Majesty\u0027s ships… designed exclusively for the defence of our beloved island… a long era of peace… development for Man\u0027s great journey away from the confines of this planet… Sir Hugo Drax, that great patriot and benefactor of our country…\u0027 \n Gala heard Drax\u0027s roar of laughter above the howling of the wind, a great scornful bray of triumph, and then the set was switched off. \n \"James,\" whispered Gala to herself. \"There\u0027s only you left. Be careful. But make haste.\" \n Bond\u0027s face was a mask of dust and filthy with the blood of flies and moths that had smashed against it. Often he had had to take a cramped hand off the wheel to clear his goggles but the Bentley was going beautifully and he felt sure of holding the Mercedes. \n He was touching ninety-five on the straight just before the entrance to Leeds Castle when great lights were suddenly switched on behind him and a four-tone windhorn sounded its impudent \u0027pom-pim-pom-pam\u0027 almost in his ear. \n The apparition of a third car in the race was almost unbelievable. Bond had hardly troubled to look in his driving-mirror since he left London. No one but a racing-driver or a desperate man could have kept up with them, and his mind was in a turmoil as he automatically pulled over to the left and saw out of the corner of his eye a low, fire-engine-red car come up level with him and draw away with a good ten miles an hour extra on its clock. \n He caught a glimpse of the famous Alfa radiator and along the edge of the bonnet in bold white script the words Attaboy II. Then there was the grinning face of a youth in shirtsleeves who stuck two rude fingers in the air before he pulled away in the welter of sound which an Alfa at speed compounds from the whine of its supercharger, the Gatling crackle of its exhaust, and the thunderous howl of its transmission. \n Bond grinned in admiration as he raised a hand to the driver. Alfa-Romeo supercharged straight-eight, he thought to himself. Must be nearly as old as mine. \u0027Thirty-two or \u002733 probably. And only half my c.c. Targa Florio in 1931 and did well everywhere after that. Probably a hot-rod type from one of the RAF stations round here. Trying to get back from a party in time to sign in before he\u0027s put on the report. He watched affectionately as the Alfa wagged its tail in the S-bend abreast of Leeds Castle and then howled off on the long wide road towards the distant Charing-fork. \n Bond could imagine the grin of delight as the boy came up with Drax. \u0027Oh, boy. It\u0027s a Merc!\u0027 And the rage of Drax at the impudent music of the windhorn. Must be doing 105, reflected Bond. Hope the damn fool doesn\u0027t run out of road. He watched the two sets of tail lights closing up, the boy in the Alfa preparing for his trick of coming up behind and suddenly switching everything on when he could see a chance to get by. \n There. Four hundred yards away the Mercedes showed white in the sudden twin shafts from the Alfa. There was a mile of clear road ahead, straight as a die. Bond could almost feel the boy\u0027s feet stamping the pedal still further into the floorboards. Attaboy! \n Up front in the Mercedes Krebs had his mouth close to Drax\u0027s ear. \"Another of them,\" he shouted urgently. \"Can\u0027t see his face. Coming up to pass now.\" \n Drax let out a harsh obscenity. His bared teeth showed white in the pale glimmer from the dashboard. \"Teach the swine a lesson,\" he said, setting his shoulders and gripping the wheel tightly in the great leather gauntlets. Out of the corner of his eye he watched the nose of the Alfa creep up to starboard. \u0027Pom-pim-pom-pam\u0027 chirped the windhorn, softly, delicately, Drax inched the wheel of the Mercedes to the right and, at the horrible crash of metal, whipped it back again to correct the slew of his tail. \n \"Bravo! Bravo!\" screamed Krebs, beside himself with excitement as he knelt on the seat and looked back. \"Double somersault. Jumped the hedge upside down. I think he\u0027s burning already. Yes. There are flames.\" \n \"That\u0027ll give our fine Mister Bond something to think about,\" snarled Drax, breathing heavily. \n But Bond, his face a tight mask, had hardly checked his speed and there was nothing but revenge in his mind as he hurtled on after the flying Mercedes. \n He had seen it all. The grotesque flight of the red car as it turned over and over, the flying figure of the driver, his arms and legs spreadeagled as he soared out of the driving seat, and the final thunder as the car hurdled the hedge upside down and crashed into the field. \n As he flashed by, noting the horrible graffiti of the black skid-marked across the tarmac, his mind recorded one final macabre touch. Somehow undamaged in the holocaust, the windhorn was still making contact and its ululations were going on up to the sky, stridently clearing imaginary roads for the passage of Attaboy II-\u0027Pom-pim-pom-pam.\u0027 Tom-pim-pom-pam…\u0027 \n So a murder had taken place in front of his eyes. Or at any rate an attempted murder. So, whatever his motives, Sir Hugo Drax had declared war and didn\u0027t mind Bond knowing it. This made a lot of things easier. It meant that Drax was a criminal and probably a maniac. Above all it meant certain danger for the Moonraker. That was enough for Bond. He reached under the dashboard and from its concealed holster drew out the long-barrelled .45 Colt Army Special and laid it on the seat beside him. The battle was now in the open and somehow the Mercedes must be stopped. \n Using the road as if it was Donington, Bond rammed his foot down and kept it there. Gradually, with the needle twitching either side of the hundred mark he began to narrow the gap. \n Drax took the left-hand fork at Charing and hissed up the long hill. Ahead, in the giant beam of his headlights, one of Bowaters\u0027 huge eight-wheeled AEC Diesel carriers was just grinding into the first bend of the hairpin, labouring under the fourteen tons of newsprint it was taking on a night run to one of the East Kent newspapers. \n Drax cursed under his breath as he saw the long carrier with the twenty gigantic rolls, each containing five miles of newsprint, roped to its platform. Right in the middle of the tricky S-bend at the top of the hill. \n He looked in the driving mirror and saw the Bentley coming into the fork. \n And then Drax had his idea. \n \"Krebs,\" the word was a pistol shot. \"Get out your knife.\" \n There was a sharp click and the stiletto was in Krebs\u0027s hand. One didn\u0027t dawdle when there was that note in the master\u0027s voice. \n \"I am going to slow down behind this lorry. Take your shoes and socks off and climb out on to the bonnet and when I come up behind the lorry jump on to it. I shall be going at walking-pace. It will be safe. Cut the ropes that hold the rolls of paper. The left ones first. Then the right. I shall have pulled up level with the lorry and when you have cut the second lot jump into the car. Be careful you are not swept off with the paper. Verstanden? Also. Hals und Beinbruch!\" \n Drax dowsed his headlights and swept round the bend at eighty. The lorry was twenty yards ahead and Drax had to brake hard to avoid crashing into its tail. The Mercedes executed a dry skid until its radiator was almost underneath the platform of the carrier. \n Drax changed down to second. \"Now!\" He held the car steady as a rock as Krebs, with bare feet, went over the windscreen and scrambled along the shining bonnet, his knife in his hand. \n With a leap he was up and hacking at the left-hand ropes. Drax pulled away to the right and crawled up level with the rear wheels of the Diesel, the oily smoke from its exhaust in his eyes and nostrils. \n Bond\u0027s lights were just showing round the bend. \n There was a series of huge thuds as the left-hand rolls poured off the back of the lorry into the road and went hurtling off into the darkness. And more thuds as the right-hand ropes parted. One roll burst as it landed and Drax heard a tearing rattle as the unwinding paper crashed back down the one-in-ten gradient. \n Released of its load the lorry almost bounded forward and Drax had to accelerate a little to catch the flying figure of Krebs who landed half across Gala\u0027s back and half in the front seat. Drax stamped his foot into the floor and sped off up the hill, ignoring a shout from the lorry-driver above the clatter of the Diesel pistons as he shot ahead. \n As he hurtled round the next bend he saw the shaft of two headlights curve up into the sky above the tops of the trees until they were almost vertical. They wavered there for an instant and then the beams whirled away across the sky and went out. \n A great barking laugh broke out of Drax as for a split second he took his eyes off the road and raised his face triumphantly towards the stars. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46611.html","bookId":1274,"book":{"id":1274,"title":"007之大破太空城 MoonRaker","description":"简介： 美国运送英国太空船半途失事，引起两国警觉，英方怀疑有不法组织劫持，因此派007前去查办，007追查之下发现某种组织在制造一种神经麻痹气体，该气体是由一种极稀有的尼格拉兰花提取出来的，007前往兰花产地调查，终于发现该组织的重大阴谋，就是在太空中建立了一个太空...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/01/10-00-10-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
