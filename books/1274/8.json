{"id":28307,"no":8,"title":"PART TWO: TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY CHAPTER VIII THE RED TELEPHONE","content":"ALTHOUGH HE had not got to bed until two, Bond walked into his headquarters punctually at ten the next morning. He was feeling dreadful. As well as acidity and liver as a result of drinking nearly two whole bottles of champagne, he had a touch of the melancholy and spiritual deflation that were partly the after-effects of the benzedrine and partly reaction to the drama of the night before. \\n\\n When he went up in the lift towards another routine day, the bitter taste of the midnight hours was still with him. \\n\\n After Meyer had scuttled thankfully off to bed, Bond had taken the two packs of cards out of the pockets of his coat and had put them on the table in front of Basildon and M. One was the blue pack that Drax had cut to him and that he had pocketed, substituting instead, under cover of his handkerchief, the stacked blue pack in his right-hand pocket. The other was the stacked red pack in his left-hand pocket which had not been needed. \\n\\n He fanned the red pack out on the table and showed M. and Basildon that it would have produced the same freak grand slam that had defeated Drax. \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a famous Culbertson hand,\" he explained. \"He used it to spoof his own quick-trick conventions. I had to doctor a red and a blue pack. Couldn\u0027t know which colour I would be dealing with.\" \\n\\n \"Well, it certainly went with a bang,\" said Basildon gratefully. \"I expect he\u0027ll put two and two together and either stay away or play straight in future. Expensive evening for him. Don\u0027t let\u0027s have any arguments about your winnings,\" he added. \"You\u0027ve done everyone-and particularly Drax-a good turn tonight. Things might have gone wrong. Then it would have been your fingers that would have got burned. Cheque will reach you on Saturday.\" \\n\\n They had said good-night and Bond, in a mood of anticlimax, had gone off to bed. He had taken a mild sleeping pill to try and clear his mind of the bizarre events of the evening and prepare himself for the morning and the office. Before he slept he reflected, as he had often reflected in other moments of triumph at the card table, that the gain to the winner is, in some odd way, always less than the loss to the loser. \\n\\n When he closed the door behind him Loelia Ponsonby looked curiously at the dark shadows under his eyes. He noticed the glance, as she had intended. \\n\\n He grinned. \"Partly work and partly play,\" he explained. \"In strictly masculine company,\" he added. \"And thanks very much for the benzedrine. It really was badly needed. Hope I didn\u0027t interfere with your evening?\" \\n\\n \"Of course not,\" she said, thinking of the dinner and the library book she had abandoned when Bond telephoned. She looked down at her shorthand pad. \"The Chief of Staff telephoned half an hour ago. He said that M. would be wanting you today. He couldn\u0027t say when. I told him that you\u0027ve got Unarmed Combat at three and he said to cancel it. That\u0027s all, except the dockets left over from yesterday.\" \\n\\n \"Thank heavens,\" said Bond. \"I couldn\u0027t have stood being thrown about by that dam\u0027 Commando chap today. Any news of 008?\" \\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said. \"They say he\u0027s all right. He\u0027s been moved to the military hospital at Wahnerheide. Apparently it\u0027s only shock.\" \\n\\n Bond knew what \u0027shock\u0027 might mean in his profession. \"Good,\" he said without conviction. He smiled at her and went into his office and closed the door. \\n\\n He walked decisively round his desk to the chair, sat down, and pulled the top file towards him. Monday was gone. This was Tuesday. A new day. Closing his mind to his headache and to thoughts about the night, he lit a cigarette and opened the brown folder with the Top Secret red star on it. It was a memorandum from the Office of the Chief Preventive Officer of the United States Customs Branch and it was headed The Inspectoscope. \\n\\n He focused his eyes. \\n\\n \u0027The Inspectoscope,\u0027 he read, \u0027is an instrument using fluoroscopic principles for the detection of contraband. It is manufactured by the Sicular Inspectoscope Company of San Francisco and is widely used in American prisons for the secret detection of metal objects concealed in the clothing or on the person of criminals and prison visitors. It is also used in the detection of IDE (Illicit Diamond Buying) and diamond smuggling in the diamond fields of Africa and Brazil. The instrument costs seven thousand dollars, is approximately eight feet long by seven feet high and weighs nearly three tons. It requires two trained operators. Experiments have been made with this instrument in the customs hall of the International Airport at Idlewild with the following results…\u0027 \\n\\n Bond skipped two pages containing details of a number of petty smuggling cases and studied the \u0027Summary of Conclusions\u0027 from which he deduced, with some irritation, that he would have to think of some place other than his armpit for carrying his .25 Beretta the next time he travelled abroad. He made a mental note to discuss the problem with the Technical Devices Section. \\n\\n He ticked and initialled the distribution slip and automatically reached for the next folder entitled Philopon. A Japanese murder-drug. \\n\\n \u0027Philopon\u0027, his mind was trying to wander and he dragged it sharply back to the typewritten pages. \\n\\n \u0027Philopon is the chief factor in the increase in crime in Japan. According to the Welfare Ministry there are now 1,500,000 addicts in the country, of whom one million are under the age of 20, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police attribute 70 per cent of juvenile crime to the influences of the drug. \\n\\n \u0027Addiction, as in the case of marijuana in the United States, begins with one \"shot\". The effect is \"stimulating\" and the drug is habit-forming. It is also cheap-about ten yen (sixpence) a shot-and the addict rapidly increases his shots to the neighbourhood of one hundred a day. In these quantities the addiction becomes expensive and the victim automatically turns to crime to pay for the drug. That the crime often includes physical assault and murder is due to a peculiar property of the drug. It induces an acute persecution complex in the addict who becomes prey to the illusion that people want to kill him and that he is always being followed with harmful intent. He will turn with his feet and fists, or with a razor, on a stranger in the streets who he thinks has scrutinized him offensively. Less advanced addicts tend to avoid an old friend who has reached the one hundred shots a day dosage, and this of course merely increases his feeling of persecution. \\n\\n \u0027In this way murder becomes an act of self-defence, virtuous and justified, and it will readily be seen what a dangerous weapon it can become in the handling and direction of organized crime by a \"master-mind\". \\n\\n Thilopon has been traced as the motive power behind the notorious Bar Mecca murder case and as a result of that unpleasant affair the police rounded up more than 5000 purveyors of the drug in a matter of weeks. \\n\\n \u0027As usual Korean nationals are being blamed…\" \\n\\n Suddenly Bond rebelled. What the hell was he doing reading all this stuff? When would he conceivably require to know about a Japanese murder-drug called Philopon? \\n\\n Inattentively he skimmed through the remaining pages, ticked himself off the distribution slip, and threw the docket into his out-tray. \\n\\n His headache was still sitting over his right eye as if it had been nailed there. He opened one of the drawers of his desk and took out a bottle of Phensic. He considered asking his secretary for a glass of water, but he disliked being cossetted. With distaste he crunched two tablets between his teeth and swallowed down the harsh powder. \\n\\n Then he lit a cigarette and got up and stood by the window. He looked across the green panorama far below him and, without seeing it, let his eyes wander aimlessly along the jagged horizon of London while his mind focused on the strange events of the night before. \\n\\n And the more he thought about it, the stranger it all seemed. \\n\\n Why should Drax, a millionaire, a public hero, a man with a unique position in the country, why should this remarkable man cheat at cards? What could he achieve by it? What could he prove to himself? Did he think that he was so much a law unto himself, so far above the common herd and their puny canons of behaviour that he could spit in the face of public opinion? \\n\\n Bond\u0027s mind paused. Spit in their faces. That just about described his manner at Blades. The combination of superiority and scorn. As if he was dealing with human muck so far beneath contempt that there was no need to put up even a pretence of decent behaviour in its company. \\n\\n Presumably Drax enjoyed gambling. Perhaps it eased the tensions in him, the tensions that showed in his harsh voice, his nail-biting, the constant sweating. But he mustn\u0027t lose. It would be contemptible to lose to these inferior people. So, at whatever risk, he must cheat his way to victory. As for the possibility of detection, presumably he thought that he could bluster his way out of any corner. If he thought about it at all. And people with obsessions, reflected Bond, were blind to danger. They even courted it in a perverse way. Kleptomaniacs would try to steal more and more difficult objects. Sex maniacs would parade their importunities as if they were longing to be arrested. Pyromaniacs often made no attempt to avoid being linked with their fire-raising. \\n\\n But what obsession was it that was consuming this man? What was the origin of the compulsive urge that was driving him down the steep hill into the sea? \\n\\n All the signs pointed to paranoia. Delusions of grandeur and, behind that, of persecution. The contempt in his face. The bullying voice. The expression of secret triumph with which he had met defeat after a moment of bitter collapse. . The triumph of the maniac who knows that whatever the facts may say he is right. Whoever may try to thwart him he can overcome. For him there is no defeat because of his secret power. He knows how to make gold. He can fly like a bird. He is almighty-the man in the padded cell who is God. Yes, thought Bond, gazing blindly out over Regent\u0027s Park. That is the solution. Sir Hugo Drax is a raving paranoiac. That is the power which has driven him on, by devious routes, to make his millions. That is the mainspring of the gift to England of this giant rocket that will annihilate our enemies. Thanks to the all-powerful Drax. \\n\\n But who can tell how near to breaking-point this man is? Who has penetrated behind that bluster, behind all that red hair on his face, who has read the signs as more than the effect of his humble origins or of sensitivity about his war wounds? \\n\\n Apparently no one. Then was he, Bond, right in his analysis? What was it based on? Was this glimpse through a shuttered window into a man\u0027s soul sufficient evidence? Perhaps others had caught such a glimpse. Perhaps there had been other moments of supreme tension in Singapore, Hong Kong, Nigeria, Tangier, when some merchant sitting across a table from Drax had noticed the sweat and the bitten nails and the red blaze of the eyes in the face from which all the blood had suddenly been drained. \\n\\n If one had time, thought Bond, one ought to seek those people out, if they existed, and really find out about this man, perhaps get him in the killing-bottle before it was too late. \\n\\n Too late? Bond smiled to himself. What was he being so dramatic about? What had this man done to him? Made him a present of ?15,000. Bond shrugged. It was none of his business anyway. But that last remark of his, \u0027Spend it quickly, Commander Bond.\u0027 What had he meant by that? It must be those words, Bond reflected, that had stayed in the back of his mind and made him ponder so carefully over the problem of Drax. \\n\\n Bond turned brusquely away from the window. To hell with it, he thought. I\u0027m getting obsessed myself. Now then. Fifteen thousand pounds. A miraculous windfall. All right then, he would spend it quickly. He sat down at his desk and picked up a pencil. He thought for a moment and then wrote carefully on a memorandum pad headed \u0027Top Secret\u0027: \\n\\n (1) Rolls-Bentley Convertible, say ?5000. \\n\\n (2) Three diamond clips at ?250 each, ?750. \\n\\n He paused. That still left nearly ?10,000. Some clothes, paint the flat, a set of the new Henry Cotton irons, a few dozen of the Taittinger champagne. But those could wait. He would go that afternoon and buy the clips and talk to Bentleys. Put all the rest into gold shares. Make a fortune. Retire. \\n\\n In angry protest the red telephone splintered the silence \"Can you come up? M. wants you.\" It was the Chief of Staff, speaking urgently. \\n\\n \"Coming,\" said Bond, suddenly alert. \"Any clue?\" \\n\\n \"Search me,\" said the Chief of Staff. \"Hasn\u0027t touched his signals yet. Been over at the Yard and the Ministry of Supply all the morning.\" \\n\\n He rang off. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46599.html","bookId":1274,"book":{"id":1274,"title":"007之大破太空城 MoonRaker","description":"简介： 美国运送英国太空船半途失事，引起两国警觉，英方怀疑有不法组织劫持，因此派007前去查办，007追查之下发现某种组织在制造一种神经麻痹气体，该气体是由一种极稀有的尼格拉兰花提取出来的，007前往兰花产地调查，终于发现该组织的重大阴谋，就是在太空中建立了一个太空...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/01/10-00-10-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
