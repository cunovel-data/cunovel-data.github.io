{"id":28308,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX TAKE IT FROM HERE","content":"A FEW minutes later Bond was walking through the familiar door and the green light had gone on over the entrance. M. looked sharply at him. \"You look pretty dreadful, 007,\" he said. \"Sit down.\" \n It\u0027s business, thought Bond, his pulse quickening. No Christian names today. He sat down. M. was studying some pencilled notes on a scratch-pad. He looked up. His eyes were no longer interested in Bond. \n \"Trouble down at Drax\u0027s plant last night,\" he said. \"Double killing. Police tried to get hold of Drax. Didn\u0027t think of Blades apparently. Caught up with him when he got back to the Ritz about half-past one this morning. Two men from the Moonraker got shot in a public house near the plant. Both dead. Drax told the police he couldn\u0027t care less and then hung up. Typical of the man. He\u0027s down there now. Taking the thing a bit more seriously, I gather.\" \n \"Curious coincidence,\" said Bond thoughtfully. \"But where do we come in, sir? Isn\u0027t it a police job?\" \n \"Partly,\" said M., \"but it happens that we\u0027re responsible for a lot of the key personnel down there. Germans,\" he added. \"I\u0027d better explain.\" He looked down at his pad. \"It\u0027s an RAF establishment and the cover-plan is that it\u0027s part of the big radar network along the East Coast. The RAF are responsible for guarding the perimeter and the Ministry of Supply only has authority at the centre where the work is going on. It\u0027s on the edge of the cliffs between Dover and Deal. The whole area covers about a thousand acres, but the site itself is about two hundred. On the site there are only Drax and fifty-two others left. All the construction team have gone.\" \n Pack of cards and a joker, reflected Bond. \"Fifty of these are Germans,\" continued M. \"More or less all the guided missile experts the Russians didn\u0027t get. Drax paid for them to come over here and work on the Moonraker. Nobody was very happy with the arrangement but there was no alternative. The Ministry of Supply couldn\u0027t spare any of their experts from Woomera. Drax had to find his men where he could. To strengthen the RAF security people, the Ministry of Supply appointed their own security officer to live on the site. Man called Major Tallon.\" \n M. paused and looked up at the ceiling. \n \"He was one of the two who got killed last night. Shot by one of the Germans, who then shot himself.\" \n M. lowered his eyes and looked at Bond. Bond said nothing, waiting for the rest of the story. \n \"It happened in a public house near the site. Plenty of witnesses. Apparently it\u0027s an inn on the edge of the site that is in bounds to the men. Must have somewhere to go to, I suppose.\" M. paused. He kept his eyes on Bond. \"Now you asked where we come in on all this. We come in because we cleared this particular German, and all the others, before they were allowed to come over here. We\u0027ve got the dossiers of all of them. So when this happened the first thing RAF Security and Scotland Yard wanted was the dossier of the dead man. They got on to the Duty Officer last night and he dug the papers out of Records and sent them over to the Yard. Routine job. He noted it in the log. When I got here this morning and saw the entry in the log I suddenly got interested.\" M. spoke quietly. \"After spending the evening with Drax, it was, as you remarked, a curious coincidence.\" \n \"Very curious, sir,\" said Bond, still waiting. \n \"And there\u0027s one more thing,\" concluded M. \"And this is the real reason why I\u0027ve let myself get involved instead of keeping clear of the whole business. This has got to take priority over everything.\" M.\u0027s voice was very quiet. \"They\u0027re going to fire the Moonraker on Friday. Less than four days\u0027 time. Practice shoot.\" \n M. paused and reached for his pipe and busied himself lighting it. \n Bond said nothing. He still couldn\u0027t see what all this had to do with the Secret Service whose jurisdiction runs only outside the United Kingdom. It seemed a job for the Special Branch of Scotland Yard, or conceivably for MI5. He waited. He looked at his watch. It was noon. \n M. got his pipe going and continued. \n \"But quite apart from that,\" said M., \"I got interested because last night I got interested in Drax.\" \n \"So did I, sir,\" said Bond. \n \"So when I read the log,\" said M., ignoring Bond\u0027s comment, \"I telephoned Vallance at the Yard and asked him what it was all about. He was rather worried and asked me to come over. I said I didn\u0027t want to tread on Five\u0027s corns but he said he had already spoken to them. They maintained it was a matter between my department and the police since it was we who had cleared the German who did the killing. So I went along.\" \n M. paused and looked down at his notes. \n \"The place is on the coast about three miles north of Dover,\" he said. \"There\u0027s this inn nearby on the main coast road, the \u0027World without Want\u0027, and the men from the site go there in the evening. Last night, about seven-thirty, the Security man from the Ministry, this man Tallon, went along there and was having a whisky and soda and chatting away with some of the Germans when the murderer, if you like to call him that, came in and walked straight up to Tallon. He pulled out a Luger-no serial numbers by the way-out of his shirt and said,\" M. looked up, \u0027\"I love Gala Brand. You shall not have her.\u0027 Then he shot Tallon through the heart and put the smoking gun in his own mouth and pulled the trigger.\" \n \"What a ghastly business,\" said Bond. He could see every detail of the shambles in the crowded taproom of a typical English public house. \"Who\u0027s the girl?\" \n \"That\u0027s another complication,\" said M. \"She\u0027s an agent of the Special Branch. Bilingual in German. One of Val-lance\u0027s best girls. She and Tallon were the only two non-Germans Drax had with him on the site. Vallance is a suspicious chap. Has to be. This Moonraker plan is obviously the most important thing happening in England. Without telling anyone and acting more or less on instinct, he planted this Brand girl on Drax and somehow fixed for her to be taken on as his private secretary. Been on the site since the beginning. She\u0027s had absolutely nothing to report. Says that Drax is an excellent chief, except for his manners, and drives his men like hell. Apparently he started by making passes at her, even after she\u0027d spun the usual yarn about being engaged, but after she\u0027d shown she could defend herself, which of course she can, he gave up and she says they\u0027re perfectly good friends. Naturally she knew Tallon, but he was old enough to be her father, besides being happily married with four children, and she told Vallance\u0027s man who got a word with her this morning that he\u0027s taken her to the cinema in a paternal sort of way twice in eighteen months. As for the killer, man called Egon Bartsch, he was an electronics expert whom she barely knew by sight.\" \n \"What do his friends say about all this?\" asked Bond. \n \"The man who shared his room with him backs up Bartsch. Says he was madly in love with the Brand woman and put his whole lack of success down to \u0027The Englishman\u0027. He says Bartsch had been getting very moody and reserved lately and that he wasn\u0027t a bit surprised to hear of the shooting.\" \n \"Sounds pretty corroborative,\" said Bond. \"Somehow one can see the picture. One of those highly strung nervous chaps with the usual German chip on the shoulder. What does Val-lance think?\" \n \"He\u0027s not sure,\" said M. \"He\u0027s mainly concerned with protecting his girl from the Press and seeing that her cover doesn\u0027t get blown. All the papers are on to it, of course. It\u0027ll be in the midday editions. And they\u0027re all howling for a picture of the girl. Vallance is having one cooked up and got down to her that\u0027ll look more or less like any girl, but just sufficiently like her. She\u0027ll send it out this evening. Fortunately the reporters can\u0027t get near the place. She\u0027s refusing to talk and Vallance is praying that some friend or relation won\u0027t blow the gaff. They\u0027re holding the inquest today and Vallance is hoping that the case will be officially closed by this evening and that the papers will have to let it die for lack of material.\" \n \"What about this practice shoot?\u0027 asked Bond. \n \"They\u0027re sticking to the schedule,\" said M. \"Noon on Friday. They\u0027re using a dummy warhead and firing her vertically with only three-quarter tanks. They\u0027re clearing about a hundred square miles of the North Sea from about Latitude 52 up. That\u0027s north of a line joining The Hague and the Wash. Full details are going to be given out by the PM on Thursday night.\" \n M. stopped talking. He swivelled his chair round so that he could look out of the window. Bond heard a distant clock chime the four quarters. One o\u0027clock. Was he going to miss his lunch again? If M. would stop ferreting about in the business of other Departments he could have a quick lunch and get round to Bentley\u0027s. Bond shifted slightly in his chair. \n M. turned back and faced him again across the desk. \n \"The people who are most worried about all this,\" he said, \"are the Ministry of Supply. Tallon was one of their best men. His reports had been completely negative all along. Then he suddenly rang up the Assistant Under-Secretary yesterday afternoon and said he thought something fishy was going on at the site and he asked to see the Minister personally at ten o\u0027clock this morning. Wouldn\u0027t say anything more on the telephone. And a few hours later he gets shot. Another funny coincidence, wasn\u0027t it?\" \n \"Very funny,\" said Bond. \"But why don\u0027t they close down the site and have a wholesale inquiry? After all, this thing\u0027s too big to take a chance on.\" \n \"The cabinet met early this morning,\" said M., \"and the Prime Minister asked the obvious question. What evidence was there of any attempt, or even of any intention, to sabotage the Moonraker? The answer was none. There were only fears which had been brought to the surface in the last twenty-four hours by Tallon\u0027s vague message and the double murder. Everyone agreed that unless there was a grain of evidence, which so far hasn\u0027t turned up, both these incidents could be put down to the terrific nervous tension on the site. The way things are in the world at the moment it was decided that the sooner the Moonraker could give us an independent say in world affairs the better for us and,\" M. shrugged his shoulders, \"quite possibly for the world. And it was agreed that for a thousand reasons why the Moonraker should be fired the reasons against didn\u0027t stand up. The Minister of Supply had to agree, but he knows as well as you or I that, whatever the facts, it would be a colossal victory for the Russians to sabotage the Moonraker on the eve of her practice shoot. If they did it well enough they might easily get the whole project shelved. There are fifty Germans working on the thing. Any one of them could have relatives still being held in Russia whose lives could be used as a lever.\" M. paused. He looked up at the ceiling. Then his eyes came down and rested thoughtfully on Bond. \n \"The Minister asked me to go and see him after the Cabinet. He said that the least he could do was replace Tallon at once. The new man must be bilingual in German, a sabotage expert, and have had plenty of experience of our \n Russian friends. MI5 have put up three candidates. They\u0027re all on cases at the moment, but they could be extricated in a few hours. But then the Minister asked my opinion. I gave it. He talked to the Prime Minister and a lot of red tape got cut very quickly.\" \n Bond looked sharply, resentfully, into the grey, uncompromising eyes. \n \"So,\" said M. flatly, \"Sir Hugo Drax has been notified of your appointment and he expects you down at his headquarters in time for dinner this evening.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46600.html","bookId":1274,"book":{"id":1274,"title":"007之大破太空城 MoonRaker","description":"简介： 美国运送英国太空船半途失事，引起两国警觉，英方怀疑有不法组织劫持，因此派007前去查办，007追查之下发现某种组织在制造一种神经麻痹气体，该气体是由一种极稀有的尼格拉兰花提取出来的，007前往兰花产地调查，终于发现该组织的重大阴谋，就是在太空中建立了一个太空...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/01/10-00-10-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
