{"id":28323,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV ZERO","content":"\"THEN WE\u0027RE all agreed?\" \"Yes, Sir Hugo,\" it was the Minister of Supply speaking. Bond recognized the dapper, assured figure. \"Those are the settings. My people have checked them independently with the Air Ministry this morning.\" \"Then if you\u0027ll allow me the privilage,\" Drax held up the slip of paper and made to turn towards the launching-dome. \"Hold it, Sir Hugo. Just like that, please. Arm in the air.\" The bulbs flashed and the bank of cameras whirred and clicked for the last time and Drax turned and walked the few yards towards the dome, almost, it seemed to Bond, looking him straight in the eye through the grating above the door of the site. The small crowd of reporters and cameramen dissolved and straggled off across the concrete apron, leaving only a nervously chatting group of officials to wait for Drax to emerge. Bond looked at his watch. 11.45. Hurry up, damn you, he thought. For the hundredth time he repeated to himself the figures Gala had taught him during the hours of cramped pain that had followed their ordeal by steam, and for the hundredth time he shifted his limbs to keep the circulation going. \"Get ready,\" he whispered into Gala\u0027s ear. \"Are you all right?\" He could feel the girl smile. \"Fine.\" She shut her mind to the thought of her blistered legs and the quick rasping descent back down the ventilator shaft. The door clanged shut beneath them followed by the click of the lock and, preceded by the five guards, the figure of Drax appeared below striding masterfully towards the group of officials, the slip of lying figures in his hand. Bond looked at his watch. 11.47. \"Now,\" he whispered. \"Good luck,\" she whispered back. Slither, scrape, rip. His shoulders carefully expanding and contracting; blistered, bloodstained feet scrabbling for the sharp knobs of iron, Bond, his lacerated body tearing its way down the forty feet of shaft, prayed that the girl would have strength to stand it when she followed. A last ten-foot drop that jarred his spine, a kick at the grating and he was out on the steel floor and running for the stairs, leaving a trail of red footprints and a spray of blood-drops from his raw shoulders. The arcs had been extinguished, but the daylight streamed down through the open roof and the blue from the sky mingling with the fierce glitter of the sunshine gave Bond the impression that he was running up inside a huge sapphire. The great deadly needle in the centre might have been made of glass. Looking above him as he sweated and panted up the endless sweep of the iron stairway, it was difficult for him to see where its tapering nose ended and the sky began. Behind the crouching silence that enveloped the shimmering bullet, Bond could hear a quick, deadly ticking, the hasty tripping of tiny metal feet somewhere in the body of the Moonraker. It filled the great steel chamber like the beating heart in Poe\u0027s story and Bond knew that directly Drax at the firing point pressed the switch that sent the radio beam zing ing over two hundred yards to the waiting rocket, the ticking would suddenly cease, there would be the soft whine of the lighted pinwheel, a wisp of steam from the turbines, and then the howling jet of flame on which the rocket would slowly rise and sweep majestically out on the start of its gigantic acceleration curve. And then in front of him there was the spidery arm of the gantry folded back against the wall and Bond\u0027s hand was at the lever and the arm was slowly stretching down and out towards the square hairline on the glittering skin of the rocket that was the door of the gyro chamber. Bond, on hands and knees, was along it even before the rubber pads came to rest against the polished chrome. There was the flush disc the size of a shilling, just as Gala had described. Press, click, and the tiny door had flicked open on its hard spring. Inside. Careful not to cut your head. The gleaming handles beneath the staring compass-roses. Turn. Twist. Steady. That\u0027s for the roll. Now the pitch and yaw. Turn. Twist. Ever so gently. And steady. A last look. A glance at his watch. Four minutes to go. Don\u0027t panic. Back out. Door click. A cat-like scurry. Don\u0027t look down. Gantry up. Clang against the wall. And now for the stairs. Tick-tick-tick-tick. As Bond shot down he caught a glimpse of Gala\u0027s tense, white face as she stood holding open the outer door of Drax\u0027s office. God, how his body hurt! A final leap and a clumsy swerve to the right. Clang as Gala slammed the outer door. Another clang and they were across the room and into the shower and the water was hissing down on their clinging, panting bodies. Through the noise of it all, above the beating of his heart, Bond heard the sudden crackle of static and then the voice of the BBC announcer coming from the big set in Drax\u0027s room a few inches away through the thin wall of the bathroom. It had been Gala again who had remembered Drax\u0027s wireless and who had found time to throw the switches while Bond was working on the gyros. \"… be five minutes\u0027 delay,\" said the breezy, excited voice. \"Sir Hugo has been persuaded to say a few words into the microphone.\" Bond turned off the shower and the voice came to them more clearly. \"He looks very confident. Just saying something into the Minister\u0027s ear. They\u0027re both laughing. Wonder what it was? Ah, here\u0027s my colleague with the latest weather report from the Air Ministry. What\u0027s that? Perfect at all altitudes. Good show. It certainly is a wonderful day down below here. Haha. Those crowds in the distance by the coastguard station will be getting quite a sunburn. There must be thousands. What\u0027s that you say? Twenty thousand? Well, it certainly looks like it. And Walmer Beach is black with them too. The whole of Kent seems to be out. Terrible crick in the neck we\u0027re all going to get, I\u0027m afraid. Worse than Wimbledon. Haha. Hullo, what\u0027s going on down there by the jetty? By jove, there\u0027s a submarine just surfaced alongside. I say, what a sight. One of our biggest I should say. And Sir Hugo\u0027s team is down there too. Lined up on the jetty as if they were on parade. Magnificent body of men. Now they\u0027re filing on board. Perfect discipline. Must be an idea of the Admiralty\u0027s. Give them a special grandstand out in the Channel. Splendid show. Wish you could be here to see it. Now Sir Hugo is coming towards us. In a moment he\u0027ll be speaking to you. Fine figure of a man. Everyone in the firing point is giving him a cheer. I\u0027m sure we all feel like cheering him today. He\u0027s coming into the firing point. I can see the sun glinting on the nose of the Moonraker way over there behind him. Just showing out of the top of the launching dome. Hope somebody\u0027s got a camera. Now here he is,\" a pause. \"Sir Hugo Drax.\" Bond looked into Gala\u0027s dripping face. Soaked and bleeding they stood in each other\u0027s arms, speechless and trembling slightly with the storm of their emotions. Their eyes were blank and fathomless as they met and held each other\u0027s gaze. \"Your majesty, men and women of England,\" the voice was a velvet snarl. \"I am about to change the course of England\u0027s history.\" A pause. \"In a few minutes\u0027 time the lives of all of you will be altered, in some cases, ahem, drastically, by the, er, impact of the Moonraker. I am very proud and pleased that fate has singled me out, from amongst all my fellow countrymen, to fire this great arrow of vengeance into the skies and thus to proclaim for all time, and for all the world to witness, the might of my fatherland. I hope that this occasion will be forever a warning that the fate of my country\u0027s enemies will be written in dust, in ashes, in tears, and,\" a pause, \"in blood. And now thank you all for listening and I sincerely hope that those of you who are able will repeat my words to your children, if you have any, tonight.\" A rattle of rather hesitant applause sounded out of the machine and then came the breezy voice of the announcer. \"And that was Sir Hugo Drax saying a few words to you before he walks across the floor of the firing point to the switch on the wall which will fire the Moonraker. The first time he has spoken in public. Very, ahem, forthright. Doesn\u0027t mince his words. However, a lot of us will say there\u0027s no harm in that. And now it\u0027s time for me to hand over to the expert, Group Captain Tandy of the Ministry of Supply, who will describe to you the actual firing of the Moonraker. After that you will hear Peter Trimble in one of the naval security patrol, HMS Merganzer, describe the scene in the target area. Group Captain Tandy.\" Bond glanced at his watch. \"Only a minute more,\" he said to Gala. \"God, I\u0027d like to get my hands on Drax. Here,\" he reached for the cake of soap and gouged some pieces off it. \"Stuff this in your ears when the time comes. The noise is going to be terrific, I don\u0027t know about the heat. It won\u0027t last long and the steel walls may stand up to it.\" Gala looked at him. She smiled. \"If you hold me it won\u0027t be too bad,\" she said. \"… and now Sir Hugo has his hand on the switch and he\u0027s watching the chronometer.\" \"TEN,\" broke in another voice, heavy and sonorous as the toll of a bell. Bond turned on the shower and the water hissed down on their clinging bodies. \"NINE,\" tolled the voice of the time-keeper. \"… the radar operators are watching the screens. Nothing but a mass of wavy lines…\" \"EIGHT.\" \"… all wearing ear-plugs. Blockhouse should be indestructable. Concrete walls are twelve feet thick. Pyramid roof, twenty-seven feet thick at the point…\" \"SEVEN.\" \"… first the radio beam will stop the time mechanism alongside the turbines. Set the pinwheel going. Flaming thing like a Catherine wheel…\" \"SIX.\" \"… valves will open. Liquid fuel. Secret formula. Terrific stuff. Dynamite. Pours down from the fuel tanks…\" \"FIVE.\" \"… ignited by the pinwheel when the fuel gets to the rocket motor…\" \"FOUR.\" \"… meanwhile the peroxide and permanganate have mixed, made steam and the turbine pumps begin to turn…\" \"THREE.\" \"… pumping the flaming fuel through the motor out of the stern of the rocket into the exhaust pit. Gigantic heat… 3500 degrees…\" \"TWO.\" \"… Sir Hugo is about to press the switch. He\u0027s staring out through the slit. Perspiration on his forehead. Absolute silence in here. Terrific tension.\" \"ONE.\" Nothing but the noise of the water, steadily pouring down on the two clinging bodies. FIRE! Bond\u0027s heart jumped into his throat at the shout. He felt Gala shudder. Silence. Nothing but the hissing of the water… \"… Sir Hugo\u0027s left the firing point. Walking calmly over to the edge of the cliff. So confident. He\u0027s stepped on to the hoist. He\u0027s going down. Of course. He must be going out to the submarine. Television screen shows a little steam coming out of the tail of the rocket. A few more seconds. Yes, he\u0027s out on the jetty. He looked back and raised his arm in the air. Good old Sir Hu…\" A soft thunder came to Bond and Gala. Louder. Louder. The tiled floor began to tremble under their feet. A hurricane scream. They were being pulverized by it. The walls were quaking, steaming. Their legs began going out of control under their teetering bodies. Hold her up. Hold her up. Stop it! Stop it!! STOP THAT NOISE!!! Christ, he was going to faint. The water was boiling. Must turn it off. Got it. No. Pipe\u0027s burst. Steam, smell, iron, paint. Get her out! Get her out!! Get her out!!! And then there was silence. Silence you could feel, hold, squeeze. And they were on the floor of Drax\u0027s office. Only the light in the bathroom still shining out. And the smoke\u0027s clearing. And the filthy smell of burning iron and paint. Being sucked out by the air-conditioner. And the steel wall is bent towards them like a huge blister. Gala\u0027s eyes are open and she\u0027s smiling. But the rocket. What happened? London? North Sea? The radio. Looks all right. He shook his head and the deafness slowly cleared. He remembered the soap. Gouged it out. \"… through the sound barrier. Travelling perfectly right in the centre of the radar screen. A perfect launching. Afraid you couldn\u0027t hear anything because of the noise. Terrific. First of all the great sheet of flame coming out of the cliff from the exhaust pit and then you should have seen the nose slowly creep up out of the dome. And there she was like a great silver pencil. Standing upright on this huge column of flame and slowly climbing into the air and the flame splashing for hundreds of yards over the concrete. The howl of the thing must have nearly burst our microphones. Great bits have fallen off the cliff and the concrete looks like a spider\u0027s web. Terrible vibration. And then she was climbing faster and faster. A hundred miles an hour. A thousand. And,\" he broke off, \"what\u0027s that you say? Really! And now she\u0027s travelling at over ten thousand miles an hour! She\u0027s three hundred miles up. Can\u0027t hear her any more, of course. We could only see her flame for a few seconds. Like a star. Sir Hugo must be a proud man. He\u0027s out there in the Channel now. The submarine went off like a rocket, haha, must be doing more than thirty knots. Throwing up a huge wake. Off the East Goodwins now. Travelling north. She\u0027ll soon be up with the patrol ships. They\u0027ll have a view of the launching and of the landing. Quite a. surprise trip that. No one here had an inkling. Even the naval authorities seem a bit mystified. C-in-G Nore has been on the telephone. But now that\u0027s all I can tell you from here and I\u0027ll hand you over to Peter Trimble on board HMS Merganzer somewhere off the East Coast.\" Nothing but the pumping lungs showed that the two limp bodies in the creeping pool of water on the floor were still alive, but their battered ear-drums were desperately clinging to the crackle of static that came briefly from the blistered metal cabinet. Now for the verdict on their work. \"And this is Peter Trimble speaking. It\u0027s a beautiful morning, I mean-er-afternoon here. Just north of the Good win Sands. Calm as a millpond. No wind. Bright sunshine. And the target area is reported clear of shipping. Is that right, Commander Edwards? Yes, the Captain says it\u0027s quite clear. Nothing on the radar screens yet. I\u0027m not allowed to tell you the range we shall pick her up at. Security and all that. But we shall only catch the rocket for a split second. Isn\u0027t that right, Captain? But the target\u0027s just showing on the screen. Out of sight from the bridge, of course. Must be seventy miles north of here. We could see the Moonraker going up. Terrific sight. Noise like thunder. Long flame coming out of the tail. Must have been ten miles away but you couldn\u0027t miss the light. Yes, Captain? Oh yes, I see. Well, that\u0027s very interesting. Big submarine coming up fast. Only about a mile away. Suppose it\u0027s the one they say Sir Hugo\u0027s aboard with his men. None of us here were told anything about her. Captain Edwards says she doesn\u0027t answer the Aldis lamp. Not flying colours. Very mysterious. I\u0027ve got her now. Quite clear in my glasses. We\u0027ve changed course to intercept her. Captain says she isn\u0027t one of ours. Thinks she must be a foreigner. Hullo! She\u0027s broken out her colours. What\u0027s that? Good heavens. The Captain says she\u0027s a Russian. I say! And now she\u0027s hauled down her colours and she\u0027s submerging. Bang. Did you hear that? We fired a shot across her bows. But she\u0027s disappeared. What\u0027s that? The asdic operator says she\u0027s going even faster under water. Twenty-five knots. Terrific. Well, she can\u0027t see much under water. But she\u0027s right in the target area now. Twelve minutes past noon. The Moonraker must have turned and be on her way down. A thousand miles up. Coming down at ten thousand miles an hour. She\u0027ll be here any second now. Hope there\u0027s not going to be a tragedy. The Russian\u0027s well inside the danger zone. The radar operator\u0027s holding up his hand. That means she\u0027s due. She\u0027s coming. She\u0027s COMING.... Whew! Not even a whisper. GOD! What\u0027s that? Look out! Look out! Terrific explosion. Black cloud going up into the air. There\u0027s a tidal wave coming at us. Great wall of water tearing down. There goes the submarine. God! Thrown out of the water upside down. It\u0027s coming. It\u0027s COMING…\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46615.html","bookId":1274,"book":{"id":1274,"title":"007之大破太空城 MoonRaker","description":"简介： 美国运送英国太空船半途失事，引起两国警觉，英方怀疑有不法组织劫持，因此派007前去查办，007追查之下发现某种组织在制造一种神经麻痹气体，该气体是由一种极稀有的尼格拉兰花提取出来的，007前往兰花产地调查，终于发现该组织的重大阴谋，就是在太空中建立了一个太空...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/01/10-00-10-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
