{"id":28321,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII PANDORA\u0027S BOX","content":"My REAL name,\" said Drax, addressing himself to Bond, is Graf Hugo von der Drache. My mother was English and because of her I was educated in England until I was twelve. Then I could stand this filthy country no longer and I completed my education in Berlin and Leipzig.\" Bond could imagine that the hulking body with the ogre\u0027s teeth had not been very welcome at an English private school. And being a foreign count with a mouthful of names would not have helped much. \"When I was twenty,\" Drax\u0027s eyes glowed reminiscently, \"I went to work in the family business. It was a subsidiary of the great steel combine Rheinmetall Borsig. Never heard of it, I suppose. Well, if you\u0027d been hit by an 88 mm. shell during the war it would probably have been one of theirs. Our subsidiary were experts in special steel\u0027s and I learned all about them and a lot about the aircraft industry. Our most exacting customers. That\u0027s when I first heard about Columbite. Worth diamonds in those days. Then I joined the party and almost immediately we were at war. A wonderful time. I was twenty-eight and a lieutenant in the 140th Panzer Regiment. And we ran through the British Army in France like a knife through butter. Intoxicating.\" For a moment Drax puffed luxuriously at his cigar and Bond guessed that he was seeing the burning villages of Belgium in the smoke. \"Those were great days, my dear Bond.\" Drax reached out a long arm and tapped the ash of his cigar off on to the floor. \"But then I was picked out for the Brandenburg Division and I had to leave the girls and the champagne and go back to Germany and start training for the big water-jump to England. My English was needed in the Division, We were all going to be in English uniforms. It would have been fun, but the damned generals said it couldn\u0027t be done and I was transferred to the Foreign Intelligence Service of the SS. The RSHA it was called, and SS Obergruppenfьhrer Kaltenbrunner had just taken over the command after Heydrich was assassinated in \u002742. He was a good man and I was under the direct orders of a still better one, Obersturmbannfьhrer,\" he rolled out the delicious title with relish, \"Otto Skorzeny. His job in the RSHA was terrorism and sabotage. A pleasant interlude, my dear Bond, during which I was able to bring many an Englishman to book which,\" Drax beamed coldly at Bond, \"gave me much pleasure. But then,\" Drax\u0027s fist crashed down on the desk, \"Hitler was betrayed again by those swinish generals and the English and Americans were allowed to land in France.\" \"Too bad,\" said Bond drily. \"Yes, my dear Bond, it was indeed too bad.\" Drax chose to ignore the irony.\"But for me it was the high-spot of the whole war. Skorzeny turned all his saboteurs and terrorists into SS Jagdverbдnde for use behind the enemy lines. Each Jagdverband was divided into Streifkorps and then into Kommandos, each carrying the names of its commanding officer. With the rank of Oberleutnant,\" Drax swelled visibly, \"at the head of Kommando \u0027Drache\u0027 I went right through the American lines with the famous 150 Panzer Brigade in the Ardennes break-through in December \u002744. No doubt you will remember the effect of this Brigade in its American uniforms and with its captured American tanks and vehicles. Kolossal! When the Brigade had to withdraw I stayed where I was and went to ground in the Forests of Ardennes, fifty miles behind the Allied lines. There were twenty of us, ten good men and ten Hitlerjugend Werewolves. In their teens, but good lads all of them. And, by a coincidence, in charge of them was a young man called Krebs who turned out to have certain gifts which qualified him for the post of executioner and \u0027persuader\u0027 to our merry little band.\" Drax chuckled pleasantly. Bond licked his lips as he remembered the crack Krebs\u0027s head had made against the dressing-table. Had he kicked him as hard as he possibly could? Yes, his memory reassured him, with every ounce of strength he could put into his shoe. \"We stayed in those woods for six months,\" continued Drax proudly, \"and all the time we reported back to the Fatherland by radio. The location vans never spotted us. Then one day disaster came.\" Drax shook his head at the memory. \"There was a big farmhouse a mile away from our hideout in the forest. A lot of Nissen huts had been built round it and it was used as a rear headquarters for some sort of liaison group. English and Americans. A hopeless place. No discipline, no security, and full of hangers-on and shirkers from all over the place. We had kept an eye on it for some time and one day I decided to blow it up. It was a simple plan. In the evening, two of my men, one in American uniform and one in British, were to drive up in a captured scout car containing two tons of explosive. There was a car park-no sentries of course-near the mess hall and they were to run the car in as close to the mess hall as possible, time the fuse for the seven o\u0027clock dinner hour, and then get away. All quite easy and I went off that morning on my own business and left the job to my second in command I was dressed in the uniform of your Signal Corps and I set off on a captured British motor-cycle to shoot a dispatch rider from the same unit who made a daily run along a near-by road. Sure enough he came along dead on time and I went after him out of a side road. I caught up with him,\" said Drax conversationally, \"and shot him in the back, took his papers and put him on top of his machine in the woods and set fire to him.\" Drax saw the fury in Bond\u0027s eyes and held up his hand. \"Not very sporting? My dear chap, the man was already dead However, to continue. I went on my way and then what should happen? One of our own planes coming back from a reconnaissance came after me down the road with his cannon. One of our own planes! Blasted me right off the road. God knows how long I lay in the ditch. Some time in the afternoon I came to for a bit and had the sense to hide my cap and jacket and the dispatches. In the hedge. They\u0027re probably still there. I must go and collect them one day. Interesting souvenirs. Then I set fire to the remains of the motor-cycle and I must have fainted again because the next thing I knew I had been picked up by a British vehicle and we were driving into that damned liaison headquarters! \u0027 Believe it or not! And there was the scout car, right up alongside the mess hall! It was too much for me. I was full of shell splinters and my leg was broken. Well, I fainted and when I came round there was half the hospital on top of me and I only had half a face.\" He put up his hand and stroked the shiny skin on his left temple and cheek. \"After that it was just a question of acting a part. They had no idea who I was. The car that had picked me up had gone or been blown to pieces. I was just an Englishman in an English shirt and trousers who was nearly dead.\" Drax paused and took out another cigar and lit it. There was silence in the room save for the soft diminished roar of the blowtorch. Its threatening voice was quieter. Pressure running out, reflected Bond. He turned his head and looked at Gala. For the first time he saw the ugly bruise behind her left ear. He gave her a smile of encouragement and she smiled wryly back. Drax spoke through the cigar smoke : \"There is not much more to tell,\" he said. \"During the year that I was being pushed from one hospital to the next I made my plans down to the smallest detail. They consisted quite simply of revenge on England for what she had done to me and to my country. It gradually became an obsession, I admit it. Every day during the year of the rape and destruction of my country my hatred and scorn for the English grew more bitter \" The veins on Drax\u0027s face started to swell and suddenly he pounded on the desk and shouted across at them, looking with bulging eyes from one to the other. \"I loathe and despise you all. You swine! Useless, idle, decadent fools, hiding behind your bloody white cliffs while other people fight your battles. Too weak to defend your colonies, toadying to America with your hats in your hands. Stinking snobs who\u0027ll do anything for money. Hah!\" he was triumphant. \"I knew that all I needed was money and the faзade of a gentleman. Gentleman! Pfui Teufel! To me a gentleman is just someone I can take advantage of. Those bloody fools in Blades for instance. Moneyed oafs. For months I took thousands of pounds off them, swindled them right under their noses until you came along and upset the apple-cart.\" Drax\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"What put you on to the cigarette case?\" he asked sharply. Bond shrugged his shoulders. \"My eyes,\" he said indifferently. \"Ah well,\" said Drax, \"perhaps I was a bit careless that night. But where was I? Ah yes, in hospital. And the good doctors were so anxious to help me find out who I really was \" He let out a roar of laughter. \"It was easy. So easy His eyes became cunning. \"From the identities they offered me so helpfully I came upon the name of Hugo Drax, What a coincidence! From Drache to Drax! Tentatively I though it might be me. They were very proud Yes, they said of course it is you. The doctors triumphantly forced me into his shoes. I put them on and walked out of the hospital in them and I walked round London looking for someone to kill and rob. And one day, in a little office high above Piccadilly, a Jewish moneylender.\" (Now Drax was talking faster. The words poured excitedly from his lips. Bond watched a fleck of foam gather at one corner of his mouth and grow.) \"Ha. It was easy. Crack on his bald skull. ?15,000 in the safe. And then away and out of the country, Tangier-where you could do anything, buy anything, fix anything, Columbite. Rarer than platinum and everyone would want it. The Jet Age. I knew about these things. I had not forgotten my own profession. And then by God I worked. For five years I lived for money. And I was brave as a lion. I took terrible risks. And suddenly the first million was there. Then the second. Then the fifth. Then the twentieth. I came back to England. I spent a million of it and London was in my pocket. And then I went back to Germany. I found Krebs. I found fifty of them. Loyal Germans. Brilliant technicians. All living under false names like so many others of my old comrades. I gave them their orders and they waited, peacefully, innocently. And where was I?\" Drax stared across at Bond, his eyes wide. \"I was in Moscow. Moscow! A man with Columbite to sell can go anywhere. I got to the right people. They listened to my plans. They gave me Walter, the new genius of their guided missile station at Peenemunde, and the good Russians started to build the atomic warhead,\" he gestured up to the ceiling, \"that is now waiting up there. Then I came back to London.\" A pause. \"The Coronation. My letter to the Palace. Triumph. Hooray for Drax,\" he burst into a roar of laughter. \"England at my feet. Every bloody fool in the country! And then my men come over and we start. Under the very skirts of Britannia. On top of her famous cliffs. We work like devils. We built a jetty into your English Channel. For supplies! For supplies from my good friends the Russians that came in dead on time last Monday night. But then Tallon had to hear something. The old fool. He talks to the Ministry. But Krebs is listening. There were fifty volunteers to kill the man. Lots are drawn and Bartsch dies a hero\u0027s death.\" Drax paused. \"He will not be forgotten.\" Then he went on. \"The new warhead is hoisted into place. It fits. A perfect piece of design. The same weight. Everything perfect, and the old one, the tin can full of the Ministry\u0027s cherished instruments, is now in Stettin-behind the Iron Curtain. And the faithful submarine is on her way back here and will soon,\" he looked at his watch, \"be creeping under the waters of the English Channel to take us all off at one minute past midday tomorrow.\" Drax wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and lay back in his chair gazing up at the ceiling, his eyes full of visions. Suddenly he chuckled and squinted quizzically down his nose at Bond. \"And do you know what we shall do first when we go on board? We shall shave off those famous moustaches you were so interested in. You smelt a mouse, my dear Bond, where you ought to have smelt a rat. Those shaven heads and those moustaches we all cultivated so assiduously. Just a precaution, my dear fellow. Try shaving your own head and growing a big black moustache. Even your mother wouldn\u0027t recognize you. It\u0027s the combination that counts. Just a tiny refinement. Precision, my dear fellow. Precision in every detail. That has been my watchword.\" He chuckled fatly and puffed away at his cigar. Suddenly he looked sharply, suspiciously up at Bond. \"Well. Say something. Don\u0027t sit there like a dummy. What do you think of my story? Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s extraordinary, remarkable? For one man to have done all that? Come on, come on.\" A hand came up to his mouth and he started tearing furiously at his nails. Then it was plunged back into his pocket and his eyes became cruel and cold. \"Or do you want me to have to send for Krebs,\" he made a gesture towards the house telephone on his desk. \"The Persuader. Poor Krebs. He\u0027s like a child who\u0027s had his toys taken away from him. Or perhaps Walter. He would give you both something to remember. There\u0027s no softness in that one. Well?\" \"Yes,\" said Bond. He looked levelly at the great red face across the desk. \"It\u0027s a remarkable case-history. Galloping paranoia. Delusions of jealousy and persecution. Megalomaniac hatred and desire for revenge. Curiously enough,\" he went on conversationally, \"it may have something to do with your teeth. Diastema, they call it. Comes from sucking your thumb when you\u0027re a child. Yes. I expect that\u0027s what the psychologists will say when they get you into the lunatic asylum. \u0027Ogre\u0027s teeth.\u0027 Being bullied at school and so on. Extraordinary the effect it has on a child. Then Nazism helped to fan the flames and then came the crack on your ugly head. The crack you engineered yourself. I expect that settled it. From then on you were really mad. Same sort of thing as people who think they\u0027re God. Extraordinary what tenacity they have. Absolute fanatics. You\u0027re almost a genius. Lombroso would have been delighted with you. As it is you\u0027re just a mad dog that\u0027ll have to be shot. Or else you\u0027ll commit suicide. Paranoiacs generally do. Too bad. Sad business.\" Bond paused and put all the scorn he could summon into his voice. \"And now let\u0027s get on with this farce, you great hairy-faced lunatic.\" It worked. With every word Drax\u0027s face had become more contorted with rage, his eyes were red with it, the sweat of fury was dripping off his jowls on to his shirt, the lips were drawn back from the gaping teeth and a string of saliva had crept out of his mouth and was hanging down from his chin. Now, at the last private-school insult that must have awoken God knows what stinging memories, he leapt up from his chair and lunged round the desk at Bond, his hairy fists flailing. Bond gritted his teeth and took it. When Drax had twice had to pick the chair up with Bond in it, the tornado of rage suddenly passed. He took out his silk handkerchief and wiped his face and hands. Then he walked quietly to the door and spoke across the lolling head of Bond to the girl. \"I don\u0027t think you two will give me any more trouble,\" he said, and his voice was quite calm and certain. \"Krebs never makes a mistake with his knots.\" He gesticulated towards the bloody figure in the other chair. \"When he wakes up,\" he said, \"you can tell him that these doors will open once more, just before noon tomorrow. A few minutes later there will be nothing left of either of you. Not even,\" he added as he wrenched open the inner door, \"the stoppings in your teeth.\" The outer door slammed. Bond slowly raised his head and grinned painfully at the girl with his bloodstained lips. \"Had to get him mad,\" he said with difficulty. \"Didn\u0027t want to give him time to think. Had to work up a brainstorm.\" Gala looked at him uncomprehendingly, her eyes wide at the terrible mask of his face. \"\u0027S\u0027all right,\" said Bond thickly. \"Don\u0027t worry. London\u0027s okay. Got a plan.\" Over on the desk the blowtorch gave a quiet \u0027plop\u0027 and went out.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46613.html","bookId":1274,"book":{"id":1274,"title":"007之大破太空城 MoonRaker","description":"简介： 美国运送英国太空船半途失事，引起两国警觉，英方怀疑有不法组织劫持，因此派007前去查办，007追查之下发现某种组织在制造一种神经麻痹气体，该气体是由一种极稀有的尼格拉兰花提取出来的，007前往兰花产地调查，终于发现该组织的重大阴谋，就是在太空中建立了一个太空...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/01/10-00-10-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
