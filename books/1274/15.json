{"id":28314,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV ROUGH JUSTICE","content":"THERE WAS a moment\u0027s silence in the room during which Bond reflected how odd it was that suspicions should have fallen so suddenly and so unanimously on one man. And did that automatically clear all the others? Might not Krebs be the inside man of a gang? Or was he working on his own and, if so, with what object? And what did his snooping have to do with the death of Talon and Bartsch? Drax broke the silence. \"Well, that seems to settle it,\" he said, looking to Bond for confirmation. Bond gave a noncommittal nod. \"Just have to leave him to you. At all events, we must see he is kept well away from the site. As a matter of fact I shall be taking him to London tomorrow. Last-minute details to be settled with the Ministry and Walter can\u0027t be spared. Krebs is the only man I\u0027ve got who can do the work of an ADC. That\u0027ll keep him out of trouble. We\u0027ll all have to keep an eye on him until then. Unless of course you want to put him under lock and key straight away. I\u0027d prefer not,\" he said candidly. \"Don\u0027t want to upset the team any more.\" \"It shouldn\u0027t be necessary,\" said Bond. \"Has he got any particular friends among the other men?\" \"Never seen him speak to any of them except Walter and the household;\" said Drax. \"Daresay he considers himself a cut above the others. Personally, I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s much harm in the chap or I wouldn\u0027t have kept him. He\u0027s left alone in that house all day long and I expect he\u0027s one of those people who like playing the detective and prying into other people\u0027s affairs. What do you say? Perhaps we could leave it like that?\" Bond nodded, keeping his thoughts to himself. \"Well, then,\" said Drax, obviously glad to leave a distasteful subject and get back to business, \"we\u0027ve got other things to talk about. Two more days to go and I\u0027d better tell you the programme.\" He got up from his chair and paced heavily up and down the room behind his desk. \"Today is Wednesday,\" he said. \"At one o\u0027clock the site will be closed for fuelling. This will be supervised by Dr Walter and myself and two men from the Ministry. Just in case anything goes wrong a television camera will record everything we do. Then, if there is an explosion, our successors will know better next time,\" he barked a short laugh. \"Weather permitting, the roof will be opened tonight to allow the fumes to clear. My men will stand guard in watches at ten-yard intervals a hundred yards from the site. There will be three armed men on the beach opposite the exhaust hole in the cliff. Tomorrow morning the site will be opened again until midday for a final check and from that moment, except for the gyro settings, the Moonraker will be ready to go. The guards will be permanently on duty round the site. On Friday morning I shall personally supervise the gyro settings. The men from the Ministry will take over the firing point and the RAF will man the radar. The BBC will set up their vans behind the firing point and will begin their running commentary at eleven-forty-five. At midday exactly I shall press the plunger, a radio beam will break an electric circuit and,\" he smiled broadly, \"we shall see what we shall see.\" He paused, fingering his chin. \"Now what else? Well now. Shipping will be cleared from the target area from midnight on Thursday. The Navy will provide a patrol of the boundaries of the area all through the morning. There will be a BBC commentator in one of the Ships. The Ministry of Supply experts will be in a salvage ship with deep-sea television and after the rocket has landed they will try to bring up the remains. You may be interested to know,\" continued Drax, rubbing his hands with almost childish pleasure, \"that a messenger from the Prime Minister has brought me the very welcome news that not only will there be a special Cabinet Meeting to listen to the broadcast, but the Palace will also be listening in to the launching.\" \"Splendid,\" said Bond, pleased for the man\u0027s sake. \"Thank you,\" said Drax. \"Now I want to be quite certain that you are satisfied with my security arrangements on the site itself. I don\u0027t think we need worry about what goes on outside. The RAF and the police seem to be doing a very thorough job.\" \"Everything seems to have been taken care of,\" said Bond. \"There doesn\u0027t seem to be very much for me to do in the time that\u0027s left.\" \"Nothing that I can think of,\" agreed Drax, \"except our friend Krebs. This afternoon he will be in the television van taking notes, so he will be out of trouble. Why don\u0027t you have a look at the beach and the bottom of the cliff while he\u0027s out of action? That\u0027s the only weak spot I can think of. I\u0027ve often thought that if someone wanted to get into the site he would try the exhaust pit. Take Miss Brand with you. Two pairs of eyes, and so forth, and she won\u0027t be able to use her office until tomorrow morning.\" \"Good,\" said Bond. \"I\u0027d certainly like to have a look at the seaward side after lunch, and if Miss Brand\u0027s got nothing better to do…\" He turned towards her with his eyebrows raised. Gala Brand looked down her nose. \"Certainly, if Sir Hugo wishes,\" she said without enthusiasm. Drax rubbed his hands together. \"Then that\u0027s settled,\" he said. \"And now I must get down to work. Miss Brand, would you ask Dr Walter to come along if he\u0027s free. See you at lunch,\" he said to Bond, on a note of dismissal. Bond nodded. \"I think I\u0027ll walk over and have a look at the firing point,\" he said, not quite knowing why he lied. He turned and followed Gala Brand out through the double doors into the base of the shaft. A huge black snake of rubber piping meandered over the shining steel floor and Bond watched the girl pick her way among its coils to where Walter was standing alone. He was gazing up at the mouth of the fuel pipe being hoist to where a gantry, outstretched to the threshold of an access door halfway up the rocket, indicated the main fuel tanks. She said something to Walter and then stood beside him looking upwards as the pipe was delicately manhandled through into the interior of the rocket. Bond thought she looked very innocent standing there with her brown hair falling back from her head and the curve of her ivory throat sweeping down into the plain white shirt. With her hands clasped behind her back, gazing raptly upwards at the glittering fifty feet of the Moonraker, she might have been a schoolgirl looking up at a Christmas tree-except for the impudent pride of the jutting breasts, swept up by the thrown-back head and shoulders. Bond smiled to himself as he walked to the foot of the iron stairway and started to climb. That innocent, desirable girl, he reminded himself, is an extremely efficient policewoman. She knows how to kick, and where; she can break my arm probably more easily and quickly than I can break hers, and at least half of her belongs to the Special Branch of Scotland Yard. Of course, he reflected, looking down just in time to see her follow Dr Walters into Drax\u0027s office, there is always the other half. Outside, the brilliant May sunshine seemed particularly golden after the blue-white of the arcs and Bond could feel it hot on his back as he walked purposefully across the concrete towards the house. The foghorn from the Goodwins was silent and the morning was so quiet that he could hear the rhythmic thump of a ship\u0027s engines as a coaster negotiated the Inner Leads, between the Goodwins and the shore, on its way northwards. He approached the house under cover of the wide blast-wall and then quickly crossed the few yards to the front door, the crepe rubber soles of his shoes making no noise. He eased open the door and left it ajar and walked softly into the hall and stood listening. There was the early summer noise of a bumble-bee fussing against the pane of one of the windows and a distant clatter from the barracks behind the house. Otherwise the silence was deep and warm and reassuring. Bond walked carefully across the hall and up the stairs, placing his feet flat on the ground and using the extreme edges of the steps where the boards would be less likely to creak. There was no noise in the corridor but Bond saw that his door at the far end was open. He took his gun from under his armpit and walked swiftly down the carpeted passage. Krebs had his back to him. He was kneeling forward in the middle of the floor with his elbows on the ground. His hands were at the wheels of the combination lock of Bond\u0027s leather case. His whole attention was focused on the click of the tumblers in the lock. The target was tempting and Bond didn\u0027t hesitate. His teeth showed in a hard smile, he took two quick paces into the room and his foot lashed out. All his force was behind the point of his shoe and his balance and timing were perfect. The scream of a jay was driven out of Krebs as, like the caricature of a leaping frog, he hurtled over Bond\u0027s case, across a yard or so of carpet, and into the front of the mahogany dressing-table. His head hit the middle of it so hard that the heavy piece of furniture rocked on its base. The scream was abruptly cut off and he crashed in an inert spreadeagle on the floor and lay still. Bond stood looking at him and listening for the sound of hurrying footsteps, but there was still silence in the house. He walked over to the sprawling figure and bent down and heaved it over on its back. The face around the smudge of yellow moustache was pale and some blood had oozed down over the forehead from a cut in the top of the skull. The eyes were closed and the breathing was laboured. Bond knelt down on one knee and went carefully through every pocket of Krebs\u0027s neat grey pinstripe suit, laying the disappointingly meagre contents on the carpet beside the body. There was no pocketbook and no papers. The only objects of interest were a bunch of skeleton keys, a spring knife with a well-sharpened stiletto blade, and an obscene little truss-shaped black leather cosh. Bond pocketed these and then went to his bedside table and fetched the untouched bottle of Vichy water. It took five minutes to revive Krebs and get him into a sitting position with his back to the dressing-table and another five for him to be capable of speaking. Gradually the colour came back to his face and the craftiness to his eyes. \"I answer no questions except to Sir Hugo,\" he said as Bond started the interrogation. \"You have no right to question me. I was doing my duty.\" His voice was surly and assured. Bond took the empty Vichy bottle by the neck. \"Think again,\" he said. \"Or I\u0027ll beat the daylight out of you until this breaks and then use the neck for some plastic surgery. Who told you to go over my room?\" \"Leck mich am Arsch.\" Krebs spat the obscene insult at him. Bond bent down and cracked him sharply across the shins. Krebs\u0027s body cringed, but, as Bond raised his arm again, he suddenly shot up from the floor and dived under the descending bottle. The blow caught him hard on the shoulder, but it didn\u0027t check his momentum and he was out of the door and halfway down the corridor before Bond started in pursuit. Bond stopped outside the door and watched the flying figure swerve down the stairs and out of sight. Then, as he heard the scurrying squeak of the rubber-soled shoes as they fled down the stairs and across the hall, he laughed abruptly to himself and went back into his room and locked the door. Short of beating the man\u0027s brains out it hadn\u0027t looked as if he would get much out of Krebs. He had given him something to think about. Crafty little brute. His injuries couldn\u0027t have been so bad after all. Well, it would be up to Drax to punish him. Unless, of course, Krebs had been carrying out Drax\u0027s orders. Bond cleaned up the mess in his room and sat down on his bed and gazed at the opposite wall with unseeing eyes. It had not been only instinct that had made him tell Drax he was going to the firing point instead of to the house. It had seriously crossed his mind that the snooping of Krebs was on Drax\u0027s orders, and that Drax ran his own security system. And yet how did that tally with the deaths of Tallon and Bartsch? Or had the double killing been a coincidence unrelated to the marks on the chart and the fingerprints of Krebs? As if summoned by his thoughts, there came a knock on the door and the butler came in. He was followed by a police sergeant in road patrol uniform who saluted and handed Bond a telegram. Bond took it over to the window. It was signed Baxter, which meant Vallance, and it read : FIRSTLY CALL WAS FROM HOUSE SECONDLY FOG REQUIRED OPERATION OF FOGHORN SO SHIP HEARD COMMA OBSERVED NOTHING THIRDLY YOUR COMPASS RECKONING TOO NEAR SHORE THUS OUT OF SIGHT OF SAINT MARGARETS OR DEAL COASTGUARD ENDS. \"Thank you,\" said Bond. \"No answer.\" When the door was closed Bond put his lighter to the telegram and dropped it in the fireplace, scuffing the charred remains into powder with the sole of his shoe. Nothing much there except that Tallon\u0027s call to the Ministry might indeed have been heard by someone in the house, which might have resulted in the search of his room, which might have resulted in his death. But what about Bartsch? If all this was part of something much bigger how could it be linked up with an attempt to sabotage the rocket? Wasn\u0027t it much simpler to conclude that Krebs was a natural snooper, or more likely that he was operating for Drax, who seemed to be meticulously security-conscious and who might want to be sure of the loyalty of his secretary, of Tallon, and certainly, after their encounter at Blades, of Bond? Wasn\u0027t it just acting like the chief (and Bond had known many of them who would fit the picture) of some super-secret project during the war who had reinforced official security with his own private spy system? If that theory was correct there only remained the double killing. Now that Bond had caught the magic and the tension of the Moonraker the facts of the hysterical shooting seemed more reasonable. As for the mark on the chart, that might have been made any day in the past year; the night-glasses were just night-glasses and the moustaches on the men were just a lot of moustaches. Bond sat on in the silent room, shifting the pieces in the jigsaw so that two entirely different pictures alternated in his mind. In one the sun shone and all was clear and innocent as the day. The other was a dark confusion of guilty motives, obscure suspicions, and nightmare queries. When the gong sounded for lunch he still did not know which picture to choose. To shelve a decision he cleared his mind of everything but the prospect of his afternoon alone with Gala Brand.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571/46606.html","bookId":1274,"book":{"id":1274,"title":"007之大破太空城 MoonRaker","description":"简介： 美国运送英国太空船半途失事，引起两国警觉，英方怀疑有不法组织劫持，因此派007前去查办，007追查之下发现某种组织在制造一种神经麻痹气体，该气体是由一种极稀有的尼格拉兰花提取出来的，007前往兰花产地调查，终于发现该组织的重大阴谋，就是在太空中建立了一个太空...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/01/10-00-10-70-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1571","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
