INTRODUCES A DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGE.","content":"\"\u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027!\" cried Rough and Ready, from his old place in front of the \"Times\" building. \"All the news that\u0027s going, for only four cents! That\u0027s cheap enough, isn\u0027t it? Have a paper, sir?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Is there any particular news this morning?\" asked the individual addressed. \"Yes, sir, lots of it. You will find ten cents\u0027 worth in every one of the papers, which will give you a clear profit of six cents on your investment. Which will you have?\" \"Let me look at a paper a minute, and I\u0027ll see.\" \"I don\u0027t do business that way,\" said the newsboy; \"not since one morning when I let an old gentleman look at a paper just for a minute. He read it for half an hour, and then returned it, sayin\u0027 there wasn\u0027t much in it, and he guessed he wouldn\u0027t buy.\" \"Well, here\u0027s your money. Give me the \u0027Times,\u0027\" said the other. \"Here you are!\" said the newsboy, pocketing the money, and placing a \"Times\" in the hand of the purchaser. \"Give me the \u0027Herald,\u0027\" said another. Unfolding the paper, he glanced his eye over it, and said, in evident disappointment, \"I heard there was a railroad accident somewhere, with about fifty persons killed and wounded; but I don\u0027t see it anywhere.\" \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re disappointed,\" said the newsboy. \"It\u0027s soothin\u0027 to the feelings to read about a smash-up, with lots of persons killed and wounded. Just come along to-morrow mornin\u0027, and I guess you\u0027ll find what you want.\" \"What makes you think so?\" asked the customer, suspiciously. \"If you won\u0027t mention it,\" said Rough and Ready, lowering his voice, \"I don\u0027t mind telling you that the \u0027Herald\u0027 has sent up a reporter to put a big rock on the Erie Road, and throw off the afternoon train. As he will be on the spot, he can give a full report, exclusive for the \u0027Herald\u0027! Then again, the \u0027Times\u0027 and \u0027Tribune\u0027 are arrangin\u0027 to get up some \u0027horrid murders.\u0027 Maybe they\u0027ll have \u0027em in to-morrow\u0027s paper. You\u0027d better come round, and buy \u0027em all. I\u0027ll make a discount to a wholesale customer.\" \"It\u0027s my belief that you\u0027re a humbug,\" said the disappointed customer. \"Thank you, sir,\" said Rough and Ready; \"I\u0027ve been takin\u0027 lessons of Barnum, only I haven\u0027t made so much money yet.\" The next customer asked for the \"Tribune.\" \"Here it is, sir.\" \"Did you ever see Mr. Greeley?\" he inquired. \"I live in the country, and I have often thought I should like to see so intrepid a champion of the people\u0027s rights.\" \"There he is now,\" said the newsboy, pointing to a somewhat portly man, who had just got out of a horse-car. \"You don\u0027t say so!\" ejaculated the country reader of the \"Tribune.\" \"I should like to go and shake hands with him, but he might take it as too great a liberty. I didn\u0027t know he was so stout.\" \"Go ahead!\" said the newsboy. \"He won\u0027t mind. He\u0027s used to it.\" \"I think I will. I should like to tell the folks at home that I had shaken hands with Horace Greeley.\" Now it happened that the personage who had been pointed out as Horace Greeley was really no other than Mr. Barnum himself, the illustrious showman. The newsboy was well aware of this, and was led to make the statement by his desire to see a little fun. I shall not attempt to justify him in this deception; but I have undertaken to set Rough and Ready before the reader as he was, not as he ought to be, and, though a good boy in the main, he was not without faults. Mr. Greeley\u0027s admirer walked up to Mr. Barnum, and grasped his hand cordially. \"Sir,\" he said, \"I hope you will excuse the liberty I am taking, but I couldn\u0027t help addressing you.\" \"I am glad to meet you, sir,\" said Mr. Barnum, courteously. \"Perhaps I have met you before, but I meet so many people that I cannot always remember faces.\" \"No, sir, we have never met before, but your fame has reached our village; indeed, I may say, it has spread all over the country, and when I was told who you were I could not help coming up and telling you how much we all sympathize with you in your philanthropic efforts.\" Mr. Barnum looked somewhat perplexed. He was not altogether certain whether his temperance lectures were referred to, or his career as manager of the Museum. He answered therefore rather vaguely, \"I try to do something to make the world happier. I am very glad my efforts are appreciated.\" \"Yes, sir, you may be certain they are appreciated throughout the length and breadth of the land,\" said the other, fervently. \"You are very kind,\" said Barnum; \"but I am afraid you will not get all to agree with you. There are some who do not view me so favorably.\" \"Of course. Such is always the fate of the philanthropist. There are some, no doubt, who decry you, but their calumnies are unavailable. \u0027Truth crashed to earth will rise again.\u0027 I need not continue the quotation.\" \"You are certainly very complimentary, Mr.——; perhaps you will oblige me with your name.\" \"Nathan Bedloe. I keep a seminary in the country. I have read the \u0027Tribune\u0027 for years, Mr. Greeley, and have found in your luminous editorials the most satisfactory exposition of the principles which I profess.\" Mr. Barnum\u0027s eyes distended with astonishment as he caught the name Greeley, and his facial muscles twitched a little. \"How did you know me?\" he asked. \"That newsboy pointed you out to me,\" said the other, indicating Rough and Ready, who was watching with interest the conversation between the two. \"Yes, the newsboys know me,\" said Barnum. \"So you like the \u0027Tribune\u0027?\" \"Yes, sir, it is an admirable paper. I would as soon do without my dinner as without it.\" \"I am very glad you like it,\" said Barnum; \"but I fear my own contributions to it (referring to the advertisement of the Museum) are not worthy of such kind compliments. I must bid you good-morning, at present, as my engagements are numerous.\" \"I can easily believe it, Mr. Greeley. Good-by, sir. Thank you for your kind reception of an humble stranger.\" There was another shaking of hands, and Mr. Bedloe departed under the firm conviction that he had seen and talked with Horace Greeley. Three minutes later, Rough and Ready felt a hand upon his shoulder. Lifting up his eyes, he recognized Mr. Barnum. \"Do you know me?\" asked the latter. \"Yes, sir, you are Mr. Barnum.\" \"Were you the boy who pointed me out as Horace Greeley?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Rufus, laughing; \"but I didn\u0027t think the man would believe it.\" \"He thinks so still,\" said Barnum. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much personal resemblance between me and the editor of the \u0027Tribune,\u0027\" he continued, meditatively. \"No, sir, not much.\" \"Don\u0027t do it again, my lad. It\u0027s wrong to hum-bug people, you know. By the way, do you ever come to the Museum?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, your joke is worth something. Here is a season ticket for three months.\" He handed the newsboy, as he spoke, a slip of paper on which was written:— \"Admit the bearer to any performance in the Museum during the next three months. P. T. Barnum.\" \"I got off better than I expected,\" thought Rough and Ready. \"I didn\u0027t know but both of \u0027em would get mad, and be down upon me. I wish he\u0027d given me a ticket for three, and I\u0027d have taken Miss Manning and Rose along with me.\" As he thought of Rose, it was with a feeling of satisfaction that she was so well provided for. He had the utmost confidence in Miss Manning, and he saw that a mutual affection had sprung up between her and his little sister. \"It\u0027ll be jolly when Rose grows up, and can keep house for me,\" he said to himself. \"I hope I\u0027ll be in some good business then. Selling papers will do very well now, but I want to do something else after a while. I wonder whether that three hundred dollars I\u0027ve got in the bank wouldn\u0027t set me up in some kind of business.\" While these thoughts were passing through his mind, he still kept crying his papers, and presently he had sold the last one. It was still comparatively early, and he thought he would look about a little to see if there was no chance of earning a little extra money by running on an errand. After a while he was commissioned to carry a message to Twenty-Second Street, for which he was to receive twenty-five cents, and his car fares. \"I\u0027ll walk back,\" he thought, \"and in that way I\u0027ll save six cents out of the fares.\" The walk being a long one, he was absent a considerable time, especially as he stopped for a while at an auction on Broadway. At last he reached his old stand, and was thinking of buying some evening papers, when he heard his name called in a tone of anxiety. Turning suddenly, he recognized Miss Manning. \"Miss Manning!\" he exclaimed, in surprise. \"How do you happen to be here?\" \"I came to see you, Rufus.\" \"Has anything happened?\" he asked anxiously, seeing the troubled expression of her countenance. \"Nothing is the matter with Rose, is there?\" \"She has gone.\" \"Gone!\" \"Yes, she has disappeared.\" \"Don\u0027t say that, Miss Manning. Tell me quick all about it.\" \"I sent her out on an errand this morning, just around the corner, for a spool of cotton, and she has not got back.\" \"Do you think she lost her way?\" \"She couldn\u0027t very well do that, it was so near by. No, Rufus, I am afraid she has been carried off by your stepfather.\" \"What makes you think so, Miss Manning?\" demanded Rufus, in excitement. \"I waited half an hour after she went out, wondering what could keep her so long. Then I began to feel anxious, and put on my bonnet, and slipped downstairs into the street. I went round to the store, and found she had gone there and made the purchase, and gone away directly. I was wondering what to do next, when one of the neighbors came up, and said she saw Rose dragged away by a tall man. She gave me a description of him, and it corresponds exactly to the description of Mr. Martin. I am afraid, Rufus, that he has carried our dear little Rose away. What shall we do?\" \"I\u0027ll have her back,\" said Rufus, energetically. \"He\u0027s got her now; but he shan\u0027t keep her. But I\u0027m afraid,\" he added, sorrowfully, \"she\u0027ll be ill-treated before I can recover her, poor Rose!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82749.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
