{"id":32109,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. NEW FRIENDS.","content":"Rufus slept so soundly, that his slumber was only ended by the sound of the warning bell, at seven in the morning. \"Where am I?\" he thought in bewilderment, as, opening his eyes, his first glance took in the appointments of the bedchamber. Recollections quickly came to his aid, and, springing out of bed, he began to dress. His feelings were rather mixed. He wished that he could glide softly downstairs, and out of the house, without stopping to breakfast. But this would not do, since Mr. Turner had expressly requested him to stay. But he dreaded meeting the rest of the family at the breakfast-table. He was afraid that he wouldn\u0027t know how to act in such unwonted circumstances, for, though bold enough, and ready enough in the company of boys and out in the street, he felt bashful in his present position. He dressed himself slowly, and, finding a clothes-brush, brushed his clothes carefully. He arranged his hair neatly at the glass, which, though the news boy was not vain enough to suspect it, reflected the face and figure of a very attractive and handsome boy. When his preparations were all completed, he sat down in some perplexity. Should he go downstairs? He decided not to do so, for he did not know his way to the room where the family ate breakfast. \"I will wait till I hear the bell,\" he thought. He had to wait ten or fifteen minutes, feeling somewhat nervous the while. At length the bell rang, and Rufus knew that it was time to go downstairs. He looked upon it as rather a trying ordeal, considering that he knew only the head of the family. Just as he was preparing to leave the room, the door was thrown open, and a boy of ten entered impetuously. \"Breakfast\u0027s ready,\" he said; \"Pa-pa sent me up to show you the way.\" \"Thank you,\" said Rufus. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Rufus.\" \"There\u0027s a boy in my class at school named Rufus, but he don\u0027t look much like you. Where\u0027s the bat you knocked the robber down with?\" \"Here,\" said the newsboy, smiling. \"I guess you gave him a crack, didn\u0027t you? I wouldn\u0027t like to get hit with it. Do you play base-ball?\" \"Not much.\" \"What do you want a bat for, then?\" \"To knock robbers down,\" said Rufus, smiling. \"I belong to a base-ball club at school. We call it the \"Sea-Birds.\" We go up to the Park once a week and play.\" By this time they had reached the breakfast-room. Mr. Turner, who was already down, advanced to meet our hero, and took him by the hand. \"Did you sleep well, Rufus?\" he said. \"Yes, sir. I only waked up when the bell rang.\" \"It was late when we retired. Louisa, my dear, this is the young lad who bravely came to my rescue when I was assaulted by two robbers.\" Mrs. Turner, who was a pleasant-looking lady, took his hand cordially. \"I am very glad my husband brought you home,\" she said. \"I shudder to think what would have happened, if you had not come up. I shouldn\u0027t have minded the money; but he might have been killed. I don\u0027t see how you could have had the courage to attack them.\" \"I had a stout club,\" said Rufus; \"if it hadn\u0027t been for that, I couldn\u0027t have done any good.\" \"Nor would the club have done any good, if it hadn\u0027t been in the hands of a brave boy,\" said Mr. Turner. \"But the breakfast is getting cold. Let us sit down.\" Rufus took his seat in a chair indicated to him. He was glad to find that he was seated next to the boy, who had shown him the way downstairs, for with a boy he felt more at home than with an older person. \"What is your name?\" he asked. \"Walter,\" was the reply. \"I\u0027m named after my Uncle Walter. He\u0027s travelling in Europe. Are you in a store?\" \"No.\" \"Do you go to school?\" \"No, I sell papers. I\u0027m a newsboy.\" \"Do you make much money?\" \"About eight dollars a week.\" \"That\u0027s a good deal. I only get fifty cents a week for spending money.\" \"Which is twice as much as you ought to have,\" said his father. \"I\u0027m afraid you spend most of it for candy.\" \"I didn\u0027t know newsboys made so much money,\" said Walter. \"Rufus has a sister to support,\" said Mr. Turner. \"You wouldn\u0027t think eight dollars much, if you had to pay all your expenses out of it, and support a sister besides.\" \"What is your sister\u0027s name?\" asked Mrs. Turner. \"Rose.\" \"A very pretty name. How old is she?\" \"Seven years old.\" \"That\u0027s just as old as my sister Carrie,\" said Walter; \"here she comes. She\u0027s so lazy she always gets up late in the morning.\" \"No, I don\u0027t either,\" said the young lady referred to; \"I\u0027m not so lazy as you are, Master Walter.\" \"Well, then, why didn\u0027t you come down earlier?\" \"Because I had to have my hair braided,\" said Carrie. \"Didn\u0027t I have to brush my hair?\" said Walter. \"Your hair doesn\u0027t look as if you had spent much time on it,\" said his father. \"Pa-pa,\" said Walter, as he helped himself to a second piece of toast, \"I wish you\u0027d let me stop going to school, and sell papers.\" \"Do you think that would be a good plan?\" asked his father, smiling. \"Yes, I could earn money, you know.\" \"Not much, I think. I suppose, if I agree to that arrangement, you will promise to pay all your expenses out of your earnings.\" \"Yes, I guess I could,\" said Walter, hesitating, \"I can learn the business of Rufus.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027d like it very well,\" said our hero, amused. \"Don\u0027t you like it?\" \"I don\u0027t think I should like to sell papers all my life.\" \"What are you going to do when you are a man?\" \"I can\u0027t tell yet.\" \"By the way, Rufus, I should be glad to have you call at my counting-room, No. —— Wall Street, this morning.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Rufus; \"but I should prefer to call to-morrow. This morning, I am going over to Brooklyn to see if I can recover my sister.\" \"To-morrow will answer just as well. Don\u0027t fail to come, however, I wish to have a talk with you about your prospects.\" \"I will not fail to come,\" answered the newsboy. Rufus did not find it so embarrassing as he anticipated at the breakfast table. His young neighbor, Walter, plied him with questions, many of which amused him, and occasionally his sister Carrie, on the opposite side of the table, joined in. Mrs. Turner asked him questions about his little sister, and sympathized with him when he described the plot by which she had been taken from him. \"Do you know Latin?\" inquired Walter. \"No,\" said Rufus. \"I don\u0027t see what\u0027s the use of studying it, for my part. I never expect to talk Latin.\" \"I don\u0027t think you ever will,\" said his father; \"judging from your school report, your success has not been very brilliant in that study, so far.\" \"I know one Latin sentence, anyway,\" said Walter, complacently. \"What is it?\" \"Sum stultus.\" \"I regret to hear it,\" said his father, in a tone of amusement. \"Why?\" asked Walter, surprised. \"Do you understand the meaning of the words you have just used?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, what is it?\" \"They mean, \u0027I am good.\u0027\" \"Indeed,—I had an idea that their meaning was quite different. Suppose you look out stultus in your dictionary.\" \"I am sure I am right,\" said Walter, confidently. \"I will prove it to you.\" He got his dictionary, and looked for the word. He looked a little abashed when he found it. \"Well,\" said his father, \"what does it mean?\" \"I am a fool,\" returned Walter. At this there was a laugh at Walter\u0027s expense. Breakfast was now over, and they rose from the table. \"I hope you will come and see us again,\" said Mrs. Turner. \"Thank you,\" said our hero. \"Come again, Rufus,\" said Walter; \"I\u0027m making a boat, and perhaps you can help me. I\u0027d show it to you, only I\u0027ve got to get ready to go to school. I\u0027m going to sail it in the bath-tub.\" \"I shall expect to see you at my office, to-morrow,\" said Mr. Turner, as Rufus took his leave. \"Don\u0027t forget the number, —— Wall Street.\" The door closed behind him, and Rufus descended the steps. On the whole, he was glad now that he had remained to breakfast. It had not proved so trying an ordeal as he anticipated, and he felt that he had acquitted himself pretty well under the circumstances. It occurred to him that it would be very pleasant to live in the same way if he could afford it; not that he cared so much for himself, but he would like it if Rose could have the same advantages, and live in as pleasant a home as Carrie Turner. This recalled to his mind that Rose was still in the power of his stepfather, and if he wished to secure her it would be well to lose no time. He jumped on a horse-car, and rode down-town. As he got out, Ben Gibson, who had just finished a job, caught sight of him. \"Why wasn\u0027t you at the Lodge last night?\" he asked. \"A gentleman invited me to stop at his house up-town.\" \"Oh, yes, of course,\" said Ben, incredulously. \"It\u0027s true. But I want you to go over to Brooklyn with me, and show me just where Mr. Martin lives. You shan\u0027t lose anything by it. I\u0027ll tell you about my adventure last night, as we are walking along.\" \"All right,\" said Ben; \"my health\u0027s getting delicate, and a trip to Brooklyn will be good for it.\" Ben shouldered his box, and the two boys bent their steps towards Fulton Ferry. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82757.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
