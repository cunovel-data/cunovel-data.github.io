{"id":32099,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. ROSE AND HER ENEMY.","content":"James Martin waited at the Fulton Ferry for the return of his emissary. But he had to wait a long time, as the lodgings occupied by Miss Manning and little Rose were rather more than a mile distant, and their progress was somewhat delayed by their stopping to listen to a little Italian boy and his sister, who were singing near the head of Fulton Street. Then there was a difficulty in crossing Broadway, on account of the stream of vehicles. Owing to these causes, it was an hour and a quarter before the messenger returned. James Martin had about made up his mind that the boy had given up the quest, and was starting away in vexation and disappointment, just as he appeared in sight. \"Well, you\u0027ve been gone long enough,\" he said, roughly. \"Why didn\u0027t you stay all night?\" \"I came as quick as I could. It\u0027s a long ways,\" said the boy. \"Then they stopped two or three times.\" \"Did you find out where they lived?\" asked Martin, eagerly. \"Yes, I followed \u0027em clear to the door.\" \"Where is it?\" \"Where\u0027s the half dollar you promised me?\" said the boy, with commendable caution. \"I\u0027ll give it to you when you\u0027ve told me where it is.\" \"I want it first.\" \"Do you think I won\u0027t give it to you?\" demanded Martin, angrily. \"Maybe you will, and maybe you won\u0027t. I never saw you before.\" \"I\u0027ll give you the money as soon as you tell me.\" \"It\u0027s No. 125 Centre Street.\" \"All right, my lad, I\u0027ll pay you when I get ready as long as you\u0027ve made such a fuss about it.\" \"Well,\" said the boy, coolly, \"I guess you won\u0027t make any more out of it than I do.\" \"Why not?\" asked Martin suspiciously. \"Because I\u0027ve told you the wrong street and number.\" \"Is that so?\" \"If you don\u0027t believe it, go to 125 Centre Street, and see if you can find them.\" \"You\u0027re a young rascal,\" said Martin, angry at being foiled. \"Maybe I am; but I don\u0027t mean to be cheated by you or any other man.\" \"I\u0027ve a good mind to give you a thrashing.\" \"You\u0027d better if you want to sleep in the station-house to-night,\" returned the boy, not in the least alarmed. \"So you were going to tell me the wrong place, and take my money, were you?\" \"No; if you\u0027d given me the money, I\u0027d have told you right afterwards.\" \"Well, here\u0027s your money,\" said Martin, taking out fifty cents. \"I want seventy-five cents now.\" \"What for?\" \"Because you tried to cheat me.\" \"Then I won\u0027t give you anything.\" \"All right. Then you must find out for yourself where they live.\" \"Come, boy, don\u0027t be foolish. Here\u0027s your fifty cents.\" \"Keep it yourself till there\u0027s twenty-five more.\" Further effort proving unavailing, James Martin recalled the boy, who had already started to go, and very unwillingly complied with his demand. \"Well,\" said the boy, depositing the money carefully in his pocket, \"now I\u0027ll tell you. It\u0027s No. — Franklin Street, near the North River.\" \"Are you telling me the truth?\" asked Martin, suspiciously, for he would never have thought of this quarter. \"Yes, it\u0027s the truth. If you don\u0027t believe it, you can go and see for yourself.\" \"Franklin Street!\" repeated Martin to himself. \"Perhaps it\u0027s true. The boy\u0027s a deep one. He thought I wouldn\u0027t find him out there. Perhaps he\u0027ll find himself mistaken. I\u0027d like to see him when he finds the girl gone.\" James Martin, not relying wholly on the boy\u0027s information, determined to go round and find the place indicated, and see if he couldn\u0027t ascertain definitely whether it was correct. If so, he would lay his plans accordingly. Following up this determination, twenty minutes later found him standing in front of the house. But he could not, without inquiring, obtain the desired information, and this he hardly liked to do, lest it should be reported to Rough and Ready, and so put him on his guard. He stood undecided what to do; but chance favored him. While he was considering, he saw the newsboy himself come up the street and enter the house, with a loaf of bread under his arm. He was just returning from a bakery near by, and the bread was to form a part of the supper to which all three brought excellent appetites. James Martin crouched back in a door-way, in order to escape observation, at the same time pulling his hat over his eyes. The precaution, however, proved unnecessary, for the newsboy never looked across the street, and was far enough from suspecting the danger that menaced the little household. He was thinking rather of the nice supper,—a little better than usual,—which was being prepared in honor of the holiday, and thinking how much more pleasantly they were situated than in the room at Leonard Street, on the other side of the city. \"It\u0027s all right!\" muttered Martin to himself with satisfaction. \"The boy told me the truth, and I don\u0027t mind the seventy-five cents, as long as I\u0027ve found out where they live. They\u0027ll find I aint so easily fooled as I might be. A day or two\u0027ll tell the story.\" He had learned all he wished to know, and walked back to Broadway, where it is unnecessary to follow him. The next day Rose and Miss Manning were sitting together in the neat little room to which both had become attached. Miss Manning was sewing as usual. Rose was sitting on a stool at her feet, with her eyes fixed on a small reading-book. \"I think I know my lesson, Miss Manning,\" she said at last, raising her eyes. \"Very well, Rose, I am ready to hear you.\" The seamstress laid down her work, and Rose standing by her side, read the lesson to her without a mistake. \"Didn\u0027t I say it well, Miss Manning?\" she asked, proudly. \"Yes, Rose, you are doing famously; I am quite proud of my pupil.\" \"I shall soon get through my book. Then Rufie will have to buy me another.\" \"I have no doubt he will be very glad to do so, Rose. He is very anxious that you should get along fast.\" \"Isn\u0027t he a good boy, Miss Manning?\" \"Yes, he is a very kind, considerate brother.\" \"I like it so much better than when I lived with—Mr. Martin. Do you think I shall ever see him again, Miss Manning?\" \"I cannot tell, Rose. I hope not; for I do not think you would be happy with him.\" \"He used to drink rum, and it made him so cross I used to be afraid of him.\" \"Rum ruins a great many people, Rose.\" \"I don\u0027t see how anybody can like it,\" said the little girl. \"Once fath—I mean Mr. Martin, brought some home in a bottle, and when he was out, I thought I would just taste a little—\" \"O Rose!\" \"Only a very little, a tiny spoonful, to see how it tasted. But it was so strong, and tasted so bad, I could not swallow it. I don\u0027t see how anybody can like it.\" \"Yes, Rose, it does seem strange. But I am going to ask you to go on a little errand for me.\" \"I should like to go,\" said the little girl, jumping up. \"What is it, Miss Manning?\" \"I need a spool of cotton. You know the little store round the corner.\" \"Lindsay\u0027s?\" \"Yes. I should like to have you go there and buy me another spool, the same number as this. I will give you the spool, so that you can show it to the man behind the counter.\" \"Yes, Miss Manning.\" \"Here are ten cents. You can bring me back the change. If you want to, you can stop at the candy-shop, and buy a stick of candy out of what is left.\" \"Oh, thank you, Miss Manning. Shan\u0027t I buy you a stick too?\" \"No, Rose, I have got over my love for candy.\" \"Didn\u0027t you use to like it when you were a little girl?\" \"Yes, Rose; but now make haste, for I have only a needleful of cotton left, and I want to finish this work to-night, if I can.\" Rose put on her bonnet, and went downstairs, proud of the commission with which she was intrusted. She was actually going shopping, just as grown women do, and this gave her a feeling of dignity which made her carry her little form with unusual erectness. She little suspected that the danger which her brother and herself most dreaded lay in wait for her in the street beneath; that she was about to be torn from the pleasant home which she had begun to enjoy so much. Nor did Miss Manning suspect to what peril she was exposing her young charge, and what grief she was unconsciously laying up for Rufus and herself. James Martin was lurking near the house, and had been lounging about there for three or four hours He had notified his employer in the morning that he had business in New York, and should be unable to work that day. He had also given notice to his landlady that he expected to bring his daughter home that night, and he wanted her to prepare accommodations for her. With the design of procuring her he had come over and repaired to Franklin Street; but Rose and Miss Manning seldom stirred out in the morning, and he had watched and waited in vain until now. He had made several visits to a neighboring groggery and indulged in potations which helped to while away the time, but he was getting very impatient, when, to his great joy, he saw Rose come out upon the sidewalk, and alone, which was better still. He had made up his mind to claim her, even if she were accompanied by Miss Manning; but this might excite a disturbance, and he knew there would be danger of interference from the police, which he did not court. So he considered it a remarkable stroke of good luck when he saw Rose coming out alone. \"There she is,\" he said to himself. \"I\u0027ll soon nab her. But I wonder where she is going.\" He might have seized her at once, but he thought it best not to do so. Very likely there might be somebody who might witness the seizure, who would know that she was living with Miss Manning, and might be inclined to interfere. He thought it would be better to follow her a little distance, and effect the capture in another locality. Rose pursued her way, unconscious of the danger that menaced her. She entered the store, made her purchase, and it wasn\u0027t till she had gone a little away from the store that she felt a heavy hand upon her shoulder, and, looking round, to her indescribable dismay and terror, recognized her stepfather. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82747.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
