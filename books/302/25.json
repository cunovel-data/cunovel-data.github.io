{"id":32110,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. MR. MARTIN HAS AN IDEA.","content":"We must now return to Rose, whom we left confined in the cellar. Now, a cellar is not a very pleasant place, and Rose had a dismal time of it. She was considerably frightened also, when, as she sat on the lower step of the cellar stairs she saw a large rat running rapidly past. It is not to be wondered at that Rose was alarmed. I know many persons much older who would have done precisely what she did under the circumstances, namely, scream with all their might. The little girl\u0027s scream brought Mrs. Waters to the door at the head of the stairs. \"What are you howling at?\" she demanded, roughly. \"I just saw a big rat,\" said Rose. \"Do let me come up; I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll bite me.\" \"Most likely he will,\" said Mrs. Waters. \"But I can\u0027t let you come up. You\u0027ve acted too bad. Next time you\u0027ll find it best to behave. And, mind you don\u0027t yell again! If you do, I\u0027ll come down and give you something to yell for.\" Saying this, she slammed the door, and returned to her work, leaving Rose in a very unhappy state of mind. She sat in momentary expectation of the reappearance of the rat, thinking it very likely it would bite her, as Mrs. Waters had told her. She began to cry quietly, not daring to scream, lest Mrs. Waters should carry out her threat and give her a whipping. At the end of an hour—it seemed more like a day to Rose—Mrs. Waters came to the door, and said, \"You can come up now, if you can make up your mind to behave yourself.\" Rose needed no second invitation. She ran upstairs hastily, under the impression that the rat might pursue her, and breathed a sigh of relief when she was fairly out of danger. Fanny was sitting at the table, eating a piece of apple-pie. \"Did the rats bite you?\" she asked, laughing maliciously. \"No,\" answered Rose. \"I wish they had. It would have been such fun to hear you holler.\" \"You\u0027re a mean girl,\" said Rose, indignantly. \"Hoity-toity! What\u0027s all this?\" demanded Mrs. Waters. \"Have you begun to call Fanny names already?\" \"She said she wished the rats had bitten me,\" said Rose. \"Well, so do I. It would have been a good lesson to you. Now, miss, I\u0027ve got one word to say. If you abuse and quarrel with Fanny, I\u0027ll just put you down cellar again, and this time I\u0027ll keep you there all night. Do you hear?\" \"Yes,\" said Rose, shuddering. She privately made up her mind that she should die if this threat were carried out, and the very thought of it made her turn pale. \"Don\u0027t you want some pie, Rose?\" asked Fanny, with her mouth full. \"Yes,\" said Rose, \"I should like some.\" \"Well, you can\u0027t have any,\" said Fanny, maliciously. \"Can she, ma?\" \"Of course not. She don\u0027t deserve any,\" said the mother. \"Pie is too good for wicked girls. Here, you Rose, here\u0027s something for you to do, to keep you out of mischief. Sit down to the table here, and shell these beans. Don\u0027t you want to help, Fanny?\" \"No, I don\u0027t,\" said Fanny, decidedly. \"She can do \u0027em alone.\" A tin-pan half full of bean-pods was placed on the table, and Rose was ordered to be \"spry,\" and not to waste her time. Fanny, having finished her pie, began to tease the cat, which employment she found much more satisfactory than helping Rose. That night Mrs. Waters presented her bill to Mr. Martin for a week\u0027s board in advance for himself and Rose. The fact that he had apparently given up working made her a little doubtful whether he would prove good pay. She determined to ask payment in advance, and thus guard against all risk of loss. \"Mr. Martin,\" she said, \"here\u0027s my bill for your board, and the little girl\u0027s. I\u0027m rather short of money, and have got some bills to pay, and I should feel particularly obliged if you could pay me now.\" Mr. Martin took the bill, and looked at it. \"It\u0027s seven dollars,\" said Mrs. Waters. \"I can\u0027t afford to take any less. Beef\u0027s two cents a pound higher, and potatoes is rising every day. You can\u0027t say it\u0027s unreasonable.\" \"It\u0027s all right, Mrs. Waters,\" said Martin, slipping it into his vest-pocket. \"It\u0027s all right. I\u0027ll attend to it in a day or two.\" \"Can\u0027t you pay me to-day?\" persisted the landlady. \"I\u0027ve got my rent to pay to-morrow, and it\u0027ll take all I can get to pay it.\" \"Can you change a fifty-dollar bill?\" asked Martin. \"I can get it changed.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll get it changed myself,\" said Martin. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 out on business.\" \"I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s got so much money,\" thought Mrs. Waters, suspiciously, and it is needless to say that she was quite right in her suspicions. The exact amount of Mr. Martin\u0027s cash in hand was a dollar and thirty-seven cents, and his entire wardrobe and the sum of his earthly possessions would not probably have brought over fifteen dollars. Strong as Mrs. Waters\u0027 suspicions were, however, she could not very well press the matter then. She resolved to wait till Mr. Martin returned, and then renew the subject. She would be guided in her action by what happened then. Martin, meanwhile, began to consider that possibly he had made a mistake in kidnapping Rose. The necessary outlay for her board and clothes would be a serious drain upon him, especially as for years he had barely earned enough to pay his own personal expenses. On the whole, he thought he might as well restore her to her brother; but he would take care that the newsboy paid for the concession. He thought he might by good management get twenty dollars out of him, or, if he had not so much, part down, and the rest in a week or fortnight. He resolved to see Rough and Ready about it the very next morning. There are some who say that money earned is enjoyed the most. James Martin did not believe this. Earning money was very disagreeable to him, and he considered any other mode of getting it preferable. He was lounging along the street, with his hands in his pockets, meditating as above, when a little girl came up to him, and, holding out her hand, whined out, \"Won\u0027t you give me a few pennies for my poor sick mother?\" Suddenly a brilliant idea came to Mr. Martin. He determined to question the little girl. \"How long have you been out beggin\u0027?\" he asked. \"Ever since morning.\" \"How much money have you made?\" The little girl hesitated. \"Come, little girl, if you\u0027ll tell me true, I\u0027ll give you five cents.\" \"I\u0027ll show you,\" she answered, regaining confidence. She drew from her pocket a miscellaneous collection of pennies and silver pieces, which Martin counted, and found to amount to sixty-eight cents. \"Do you make as much every day, little gal?\" he asked. \"Sometimes more,\" she answered. \"Pretty good business, isn\u0027t it? How long\u0027s your mother been sick?\" \"Most a year,\" said the little girl, hesitating. \"What\u0027s the matter with her?\" \"I don\u0027t know. She can\u0027t set up,\" said the girl, again hesitating, for she was a professional mendicant, and the sick mother was a sham, being represented in reality by a lazy, able-bodied woman, who spent most of the charitable contributions collected by her daughter on drink. \"Oh, yes, I understand,\" said Martin, with a wink. \"Good-by, little gal. Give my love to your poor sick mother, and tell her I\u0027d come round and inquire after her health if I had time.\" As he said this he turned to go away. \"You promised me five cents,\" said the little girl, running after him. \"Did I? Well, you\u0027ll have to wait till next time, unless you can change a fifty-dollar bill.\" \"I aint got money enough.\" \"Then you must wait till you see me again.\" Mr. Martin\u0027s questions had not been without an object. The idea which had occurred to him was this. Why might he not make Rose, in like manner, a source of income? Perhaps he might in that way more than pay expenses, and then he would still be able to keep her, and so continue to spite Rough and Ready, which would be very agreeable to his feelings. \"I\u0027ll send her out to-morrow morning,\" he said to himself. \"If she\u0027s smart, she can make a dollar a day, and that\u0027ll help along considerable. I\u0027ll be her poor sick mother. It\u0027ll save my workin\u0027 so hard, and injurin\u0027 my health in my old age.\" The more Mr. Martin thought of this plan, the better he liked it, and the more he wondered that he had never before thought of making Rose a source of income. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82758.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
