{"id":32108,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. A RESCUE.","content":"Armed with the bat, Rufus took his way up-town. As the distance was considerable, he jumped on board a horse-car. The conductor, noticing the bat, asked him whether he was going to play a game by moonlight. \"Yes,\" said the newsboy. \"I belong to a club called \u0027The Owls.\u0027 We can play best in the dark.\" He got out of the car at the point nearest to the place which he had heard mentioned as the probable scene of attack, and walked cautiously towards it. He had no doubt of being in full time, for it was not yet half-past eleven. But circumstances had hastened the attack; so that, as he turned the corner of a quiet side street, he was startled by seeing a gentleman struggling desperately in the hands of two ruffians. He saw at a glance that they were the same he had overheard in the oyster saloon. The gentleman appeared to be overpowered, for he was on the ground, with one man clutching his throat to prevent his giving the alarm, while the other was rifling his pockets. There was no time to lose. The newsboy darted forward, and before the villains were aware that their plans were menaced by defeat, he brought down the bat with force upon the back of the one who had his victim by the throat. The bat, wielded by the vigorous hand of Rough and Ready, fell with terrible emphasis upon the form of the bending ruffian. He released his hold with a sharp cry of pain, and fell back on the sidewalk. His companion looked up, but only in time to receive an equally forcible blow on his shoulder, which compelled him also to desist from his purpose. At the same time the voice of the newsboy rang out clear and loud on the night air: \"Help! Police!\" He sprang to the side of the prostrate gentleman, saying, \"Get up at once, sir. We\u0027ll defeat these villains yet.\" The gentleman sprang to his feet, and prepared to do his part in resisting an attack; but none was apparently intended. The man, who had been struck in the back, was not in a position to do anything, but lay groaning with pain, while the other did not think it expedient to continue the attack under the changed aspect of affairs. Besides, the newsboy\u0027s cry for help was likely to bring the police, so that the only thing left was to effect an immediate escape. He paused but an instant before making his decision; but that instant nearly destroyed his chance. The policeman, who had heard the cry for help, turned the corner hastily, and at once made chase. But by exerting all his strength the fellow managed to escape. The policeman returned, and began to inquire into the circumstances of the attack. \"How did this happen, Mr. Turner?\" he inquired of the gentleman, whom he recognized. \"Those two villains attacked me,\" said the gentleman, \"just as I turned the corner. They must have learned that I was likely to have a considerable sum of money about me, and were planning to secure it. Their attack was so sudden and unexpected that they would have accomplished their object but for this brave boy.\" \"Curse him!\" said the prostrate burglar, who was the shorter of the two.\"I saw him in the oyster saloon. He must have heard what I and my pal were saying, and followed us.\" \"Did you know anything of this intended robbery?\" asked the policeman. \"Yes,\" said Rough and Ready, \"the man is right. I did overhear him and the other man planning it. We were in an oyster saloon in the lower part of the city. I was in one of the little rooms, and they in the other. They were talking it over in a low voice; but I overheard the whole. As soon as I heard it, I determined to stop it if I could. I had no weapon with me, but was lucky enough to buy this bat of a boy I met, and came up at once. I came near not being in time.\" \"Let me see the bat,\" said the policeman. \"It\u0027s a tough customer,\" he said, weighing it in his hand; \"you settled one of the parties, at any rate.\" \"Curse him!\" muttered the burglar once more. \"Come, my man,\" said the policeman, \"you must go with me. The city provides accommodations for such as you.\" \"I can\u0027t get up,\" he groaned. \"I guess you can if you try. You can\u0027t lie here, you know.\" After some delay the man rose sullenly, groaning meanwhile. \"My back is broken,\" he said. \"I hope not,\" said the newsboy, who was moved with pity for the burglar, bad as he was. \"Don\u0027t pity him too much,\" said the policeman; \"he deserves what he\u0027s got.\" \"I\u0027ll pay you off some time, boy, curse you!\" said the injured man, with a vindictive glance at Rufus. \"I\u0027ll give you as good as you gave.\" \"It\u0027ll be some time before you get a chance,\" said the policeman. \"You\u0027ll get a five years in Sing Sing for this job.\" He marched off with the culprit, and Rough and Ready was left alone with Mr. Turner. \"I don\u0027t know how to thank you, my brave boy, for your timely assistance,\" he said, grasping the hand of the newsboy. \"I don\u0027t need any thanks, sir,\" said Rufus. \"You may not need any, but you deserve them richly. Are you far from home?\" \"Yes, sir; but I can take the horse-cars.\" \"Where do you live?\" \"At the Newsboys\u0027 Lodging House.\" \"Are you a newsboy?\" asked Mr. Turner, with interest. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Have you parents living?\" \"No, sir, except a stepfather; but he\u0027s a drunkard, and I don\u0027t live with him.\" \"Have you any brothers or sisters?\" \"A little sister, about seven years old.\" \"Does she live with your stepfather?\" \"I took her away, but Mr. Martin found out where I had placed her, and he managed to get hold of her. I found out to-day where he carried her, and to-morrow I shall try to get her back. He isn\u0027t a fit man to have the charge of her.\" \"And can you support your little sister, and yourself too?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You are a good brother, and I believe you are a good boy. I want to know more of you. It is too late to go to the Newsboys\u0027 Lodging House to-night. I live close by, and will take you home with me.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Rough and Ready, bashfully, \"but I don\u0027t want to trouble you so much.\" \"There will be no trouble, and I owe something to a boy who has rendered me such a service. Besides, Mrs. Turner will want to see you.\" The newsboy knew not what further objections to make, and, indeed, Mr. Turner gave him no time to think of any, for, placing his arm in his, he drew him along. His home was in the next block. As Rufus ascended the steps, he saw that it was of fine appearance, and a new fit of bashfulness seized him. He wished himself in his accustomed bed at the Newsboys\u0027 Lodging House. There he would be under no constraint. Now he was about to enter a home where customs prevailed of which he knew nothing. But, whatever his feelings were, there was no chance to draw back. Besides, the alternative was between accepting Mr. Turner\u0027s invitation, and sleeping in the streets, for punctually at twelve o\u0027clock the Lodging House closes, and it would be later than this before he could reach there. Mr. Turner drew out a night-key, and opened the front door. The hall was dimly lighted, for the gas was partially shut off. Still the newsboy could see that it was handsomely furnished. How it compared with other houses up-town he could not tell, for this was the first he had entered. \"The servants have gone to bed,\" said Mr. Turner; \"I never require them to sit up after eleven. I will myself show you the room where you are to sleep. Your hat you may leave here.\" According to directions, Rufus hung up his hat on the hat-stand. He congratulated himself, as he did so, that he had only bought it the week before, so that its appearance would do him no discredit Indeed his whole suit, though coarse, was whole, and not soiled, for he paid greater attention to dress than most boys in his line of business. This was due partly to a natural instinct of neatness, but partly also to the training he had received from his mother, who had been a neat woman. \"Now come upstairs with me, Rufus,\" said Mr. Turner, who had made himself acquainted with our hero\u0027s name. \"I will ask you to step softly, that we may wake no one.\" The thick carpet which covered the stairs rendered it easy to follow this direction. \"One more flight,\" said Mr. Turner, at the first landing. He paused before a door on the third floor, and opened it. Rufus followed him into a large and handsomely furnished bedchamber, containing a bed large enough for three, as the newsboy thought. \"I think you will find everything you need,\" said the master of the house, casting a rapid glance around. \"I hope you will have a comfortable night\u0027s rest. We have breakfast at half-past seven o\u0027clock. The bell will ring to awake you half an hour earlier.\" \"I think I won\u0027t stop to breakfast,\" said Rough and Ready, bashfully; \"thank you, sir, for the invitation.\" \"You mustn\u0027t think of going away before breakfast,\" said Mr. Turner; \"I wish to talk with you, and my wife will wish to see you.\" \"But,\" said the newsboy, still anxious to get away, \"I ought to be down-town early to get my papers.\" \"Let them go one morning. I will take care that you lose nothing by it. You will find a brush and comb on the bureau. And now, good-night. I am tired, and I have no doubt you are also.\" \"Good-night, sir.\" The door closed, and the newsboy was left alone. It had come so rapidly upon him, that he could hardly realize the novel circumstances in which he was placed. He, who had been accustomed to the humble lodgings appropriated to his class, found himself a welcome guest in a handsome mansion up-town. He undressed himself quickly, and, shutting off the gas, jumped into bed. He found it very soft and comfortable, and, being already fatigued, did not long remain awake, as he glided unconsciously into slumber, wondering vaguely what Ben Gibson would say if he knew where he was spending the night. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82756.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
