{"id":32100,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. ROSE KIDNAPPED.","content":"\"So I\u0027ve found you at last,\" said James Martin, looking grimly at Rose, bending over so that the fumes of his breath, tainted with liquor, seemed to scorch her innocent cheek. \"Let me go,\" said Rose, terrified and ready to cry. \"Let you go!\" repeated Martin, with a sneer. \"Is that all the welcome you\u0027ve got for me, after I\u0027ve taken the pains to come clear over from Brooklyn to find you? No, I can\u0027t let you go; I\u0027m your father, and you must go with me.\" \"I can\u0027t, indeed I can\u0027t,\" said Rose, in distress \"I want to stay with Rufie and Miss Manning.\" \"I can\u0027t allow it. I\u0027m your father, and I\u0027m responsible for you. Your brother aint fit to have charge of you. Come along.\" He seized her by the shoulder, and began to push her along. \"I don\u0027t want to go,\" said Rose, crying. \"I don\u0027t want to leave Rufie.\" \"I don\u0027t care what you want,\" said Martin, roughly.\"You\u0027ve got to come with me, anyhow. As for your brother, I don\u0027t want him. He\u0027d be trying to kidnap you again. I might have put him in prison for it; but I\u0027ll let him go this time, if you don\u0027t make any fuss.\" \"What is the matter?\" asked a policeman, who came up as Rose was struggling weakly in the grasp of her stepfather. \"What are you pulling along the little girl for?\" \"Because she won\u0027t come without,\" said Martin. \"She ran away from home with her brother a few weeks ago, and I\u0027ve just found her.\" \"Is she your child?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is that true?\" asked the policeman, not particularly prepossessed in Martin\u0027s favor by his personal appearance, his face being unusually inflamed by his morning potations. His question was of course directed to Rose. \"No, I aint his child now,\" said Rose. \"Rufie has the care of me.\" \"And who is Rufie?\" \"He is my brother.\" \"He\u0027s a young rascal,\" said Martin, \"up to all sorts of mischief. He\u0027ll lie and steal, and anything else that\u0027s bad. He aint fit to have charge of Rose.\" \"It isn\u0027t true,\" said the little girl, indignantly. \"He doesn\u0027t lie nor steal. He\u0027s the best boy that ever lived.\" \"I haven\u0027t anything to do with that,\" said the policeman. \"The question is, is this your father?\" \"He was mother\u0027s husband,\" said Rose, reluctantly. \"Then he is your stepfather.\" \"Don\u0027t let him take me away,\" said Rose, imploringly. \"If he\u0027s your stepfather, I can\u0027t stop him. But, hark you, my man, I advise you to be kind to the little girl. If you are not, I hope she\u0027ll run away from you. You look as if you\u0027d been drinking pretty hard this morning.\" \"It\u0027s the trouble I\u0027ve had about her that made me drink,\" said Martin, apologetically. \"I was afraid she wasn\u0027t taken good care of. Come along now, Rose. He says you must go.\" \"Let me go and speak to Miss Manning first,\" entreated Rose. \"I\u0027ve got a spool of cotton I\u0027ve just bought for her.\" \"I\u0027m not such a fool as that,\" said Martin. \"I\u0027ve looked for you long enough, and now I\u0027ve got you I mean to hold on to you.\" \"But Miss Manning won\u0027t know where I am,\" pleaded Rose. \"It\u0027s none of her business where you are. She aint no relation of yours.\" \"But she\u0027s been very kind to me.\" \"She was kind enough to keep you away from me, she hasn\u0027t anything to do with you, and I don\u0027t mean she shall ever see you again.\" Poor Rose! the thought that she was to be forever separated from her kind friend, Miss Manning, smote her with a sharp sorrow, and she began to cry bitterly. \"Stop your whimpering,\" said Martin, roughly, \"or I\u0027ll give you something to cry about.\" But, even with this threat hanging over her, Rose could not check the flow of her tears. Those persons whom they met looked with sympathy at the pretty little girl, who was roughly pulled along by the red-faced, rough-looking man; and more than one would have been glad to interfere if he had felt authorized to do so. James Martin did not relish the public attention drawn to them by Rose\u0027s tears, for he knew instinctively that the sympathy would be with her, and not with himself. As soon as possible he got the child on board a horse-car bound for the South Ferry. This was something of an improvement, for he was no longer obliged to drag her along. But even in the cars her tears continued to flow. \"What\u0027s the matter with your little girl?\" asked a kind, motherly-looking woman, who had a daughter at home about Rose\u0027s age, and whose sympathies were therefore more readily excited by the appearance of distress in the child\u0027s face. \"She\u0027s been behaving badly, ma\u0027am,\" said Martin. \"She doesn\u0027t look like a bad child,\" said the good woman, kindly. \"You can\u0027t tell by her looks,\" said Martin. \"Maybe you\u0027d think, to look at her, that she was one of the best children out; but she\u0027s very troublesome.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that. You should try to be good, my dear,\" said the woman, gently. Rose didn\u0027t reply, but continued to shed tears. \"She\u0027s got a brother that\u0027s a regular bad one,\" continued Mr. Martin. \"He\u0027s a little scamp, if there ever was one. Would you believe it, ma\u0027am, he induced his sister to run away from home some weeks ago, and ever since I\u0027ve been hunting all around to find her?\" \"Is it possible?\" exclaimed the other, interested. \"Where did you find her, if I may be allowed to ask?\" \"In a low place, in the western part of the city,\" said Mr. Martin. \"It wasn\u0027t a fit place for a child like her. Her brother carried her away from a good home, just out of spite, because he got angry with me.\" \"It must have made you feel very anxious.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Martin, pathetically. \"It worried me so I couldn\u0027t sleep nights. I\u0027ve been hunting night and day for her ever since, but it\u0027s only to-day that I got track of her. She\u0027s crying now because she didn\u0027t want to leave the woman her brother placed her with.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to hear it. My dear, you will be better off at home than among strangers. Don\u0027t you think you will?\" \"No, I shan\u0027t,\" said Rose. \"Miss Manning was a good woman, and was very kind to me.\" \"She isn\u0027t old enough to judge,\" said Martin, shrugging his shoulders. \"No, of course not. Where do you live?\" \"In Brooklyn.\" \"Well, good-by; I get out here.\" \"Good-by, ma\u0027am. I hope you won\u0027t have so much trouble with your children as I have.\" \"I am sure your little girl will be better when she gets home.\" \"I hope so, ma\u0027am.\" Rose did not speak. She was too much distressed, and, child as she was, she had an instinctive feeling that her stepfather was false and hypocritical, and she did not feel spirit enough to contradict his assertions about herself and Rufus. At length they reached the ferry, and embarked on the ferry-boat. Rose no longer tried to get away. In the first place, she was now so far away from home that she would not have known her way back. Besides, she saw that Mr. Martin was determined to carry her with him, and that resistance would be quite useless, so in silent misery she submitted herself to what it seemed impossible to escape. They got into the cars on the other side, and the trip passed without incident. \"We get out here,\" said Mr. Martin, when they had been riding about half an hour. Rose meekly obeyed his summons, and followed him out of the car. \"Now, young lady,\" said Mr. Martin, sternly, \"I am going to give you a piece of advice. Are you listening?\" \"Yes,\" said Rose, dispiritedly. \"Then you had better give up snivelling at once. It aint going to do you any good. Maybe, if you behave well, I\u0027ll let your brother see you after a while, but if you kick up a fuss you\u0027ll never see him again in the world. Do you understand?\" \"Yes.\" \"I hope you do. Anyway, you\u0027d better. I live over here now. I\u0027ve took board for you and myself in the house of a woman that\u0027s got a girl about as big as you. If you aint foolish you\u0027ll have a good time playing with her.\" \"I want to see Rufie,\" moaned Rose. \"Well, you can\u0027t, and the sooner you make up your mind to that the better. Here we are.\" He opened the front door of the shabby boarding house, and said to the servant whom he met in the entry, \"Where\u0027s Mrs. Waters?\" \"I\u0027ll call her directly, if you\u0027d like to see her.\" \"Yes, I want to see her.\" Mrs. Waters shortly appeared, her face red with heat, from the kitchen. \"I\u0027ve brought my little girl along, as I told you,\" said Martin. \"So this is your little girl, is it? She\u0027s a nice child,\" said Mrs. Waters, rather surprised to find that a man of Mr. Martin\u0027s unpromising exterior had so attractive a child. \"No, she isn\u0027t,\" said Martin, shaking his head. \"She\u0027s very badly behaved. I\u0027ve let her stay in New York with some relations, and she didn\u0027t want to come back and see father. She\u0027s been making a great fuss about it.\" \"She\u0027ll feel better to-morrow,\" said Mrs. Waters. \"How old is she?\" \"Seven years old.\" \"Just the age of my Fanny.\" \"You said you could let her occupy the same bed with your little girl.\" \"Yes, they can sleep together. Fanny will like to have a girl of her own age to play with. Wait a minute,—I\u0027ll call her.\" Fanny Waters was a short, dumpy little girl, of extreme plainness. Rose looked at her, but didn\u0027t appear to feel much attracted. \"You can go out into the back yard together and play,\" said Mrs. Waters; \"only mind and don\u0027t get into any mischief.\" \"Wait a minute,\" said Mr. Martin, calling Rose aside, \"I want to speak to her a minute. If,\" he continued, addressing the child, \"you try to run away, I\u0027ll go over to New York, and shoot your brother through the head with a pistol. So mind what you\u0027re about.\" Rose listened in silent terror, for she thought her stepfather might really do as he threatened, and it had a greater effect upon her than if he had threatened harm to herself. James Martin witnessed with satisfaction the effect produced in the pale, scared face of the child, and he said to himself, \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll run away in a hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82748.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
