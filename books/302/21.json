{"id":32106,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XX. HOW BEN SUCCEEDED.","content":"Ben Gibson was very willing to suspend blacking boots and follow in the track of James Martin, partly because he considered it easier work, but partly also, because he was glad to be of service to the newsboy. The fact was that Rough and Ready was popular among the street boys. He was brave and manly, rough with those who tried to impose upon him, but always ready to do a favor to a boy who needed it. Ben had not forgotten how two winters before, when he had been laid up with a sickness brought on by exposure, Rufus had himself contributed liberally to help him, and led other boys to follow his example, thus defraying his expenses until he got about again. A kind heart will make its possessor popular sooner than anything else, and it was this, together with his well-known prowess, which made Rough and Ready not only popular, but admired in the circle to which he belonged. Ben followed James Martin down Spruce Street, keeping sufficiently in the background, so as not to excite the suspicions of the latter. \"I wonder where he\u0027s goin\u0027,\" thought Ben; \"I don\u0027t think I could follow him more\u0027n a hundred miles without wantin\u0027 to rest. Anyhow I guess I can stand it as well as he can.\" Martin walked along in a leisurely manner. The fact was that he had made up his mind not to work that day, and therefore he felt in no particular hurry. This was rather improvident on his part, since he had voluntarily assumed the extra expense of supporting Rose; but then prudence and foresight were not his distinguishing traits. He had a vague idea that the world owed him a living, and that he would rub along somehow or other. This is a mischievous doctrine, and men who deserve to succeed never hold it. It is true, however, that the world is pretty sure to provide a living for those who are willing to work for it, but makes no promises to those who expect to be taken care of without any exertions of their own. The difference between the rich merchant and the ragged fellow who solicits his charity as he is stepping into his carriage, consists, frequently, not in natural ability, but in the fact that the one has used his ability as a stepping-stone to success, and the other has suffered his to become stagnant, through indolence, or dissipation. But we must come back to Mr. Martin. He walked down towards the East River till he reached Water Street, then turning to the left, he brought up at a drinking-saloon, which he had visited more than once on a similar errand. He found an old acquaintance who invited him to drink,—an invitation which he accepted promptly. Ben remained outside. \"I thought he did business at some such place by the looks of his nose,\" soliloquized Ben. \"What shall I do while I\u0027m waitin\u0027 for him?\" Looking around him, Ben saw two boys of about his own age pitching pennies. As this was a game with which long practice had made him familiar, he made overtures towards joining them. \"Let a feller in, will you?\" he said. \"How much you got?\" asked one of the boys, in a business-like way. \"Ten cents,\" said Ben. \"I lent old Vanderbilt most of my money day afore yesterday, to buy up a new railroad, and he haint forked over.\" Ben need not have apologized for his comparative poverty, as he proved to be the richest of the three. The game commenced, and continued for some time with various mutations of fortune; but at the end of half an hour Ben found himself richer by two cents than when he had commenced. From time to time he cast a watchful glance at the saloon opposite, for he had no intention of suffering the interest of the game to divert him from the object of his expedition. At length he saw James Martin issue from the saloon, and prepared to follow him. \"Are you going?\" asked one of the boys with whom he had been playing. \"Yes, I\u0027ve got some important business on hand. Here\u0027s your money;\" and he threw down the two cents he had won. \"You won it?\" \"What if I did? I only played for amoosement. What\u0027s two cents to a gentleman of fortune, with a big manshun up town?\" \"It\u0027s the Tombs, he manes,\" said one of his late opponents, laughing. \"He can blow, he can,\" remarked the other. But Ben couldn\u0027t stop to continue the conversation, as James Martin had already turned the corner of the street. It was observable that his gait already showed a slight unsteadiness, which he tried to remedy by walking with unusual erectness. The consequence of this was that he didn\u0027t keep fairly in view the occupants of the sidewalk, which led to his deliberately walking into rather a stout female, who was approaching in the opposite direction. \"Is it goin\u0027 to murther me ye are, you spalpeen?\" she exclaimed, wrathfully, as soon as she could collect her breath. \"Don\u0027t you know better than to run into a dacent woman in that way?\" \"It was you run into me,\" said Martin, steadying himself with some difficulty after the collision. \"Hear him now,\" said the woman, looking about her to call attention to the calumny. \"I see how it is,\" said Martin; \"you\u0027re drunk, ma\u0027am, you can\u0027t walk straight.\" This led to a voluble outburst from the irate woman, to which Ben listened with evident enjoyment. \"Am I drunk, boy?\" asked Martin, appealing to Ben, whom he for the first time noticed. \"Of course you aint, gov\u0027nor,\" said Ben. \"You never did sich a thing in your life.\" \"What do you know about it?\" demanded the woman. \"It\u0027s my belief you\u0027re drunk yourself.\" \"Do you know who this gentleman is?\" asked Ben, passing over the personal charge. \"No, I don\u0027t.\" \"He\u0027s President of the Fifth Avenue Temperance Society,\" said Ben, impressively. \"He\u0027s just been drinking the health of his feller-officers in a glass of something stiff, round in Water Street, that\u0027s all.\" The woman sniffed contemptuously, but, not deigning a reply, passed on. \"Who are you?\" asked Martin, turning to Ben. \"You\u0027re a good feller.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" said Ben. \"That\u0027s what everybody says.\" \"So\u0027m I a good feller,\" said Martin, whose recent potations must have been of considerable strength, to judge from their effects. \"You know me.\" \"Of course I do,\" said Ben. \"I\u0027ve knowed you from infancy.\" \"Take a drink?\" said Martin. \"Not at present,\" said Ben. \"My health don\u0027t require it this mornin\u0027.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Well,\" said Ben, \"I aint very particular. I\u0027m a wealthy orphan, with nothin\u0027 to do. I\u0027ll walk along with you, if it\u0027s agreeable.\" \"I wish you would,\" said Martin; \"I aint feeling quite well this morning. I\u0027ve got the headache.\" \"I don\u0027t wonder at that,\" thought Ben. \"I\u0027ll accompany you to your residence, if it aint too far off.\" \"I live in Brooklyn,\" said Martin. \"Oho!\" thought Ben. \"Well, that information is worth something. Shall we go over Fulton Ferry?\" he asked, aloud. \"Yes,\" said Martin. \"Take hold of my arm, and I\u0027ll support your totterin\u0027 steps,\" said Ben. Mr. Martin, who found locomotion in a straight line rather difficult on account of his headache, willingly availed himself of this obliging offer, and the two proceeded on their way to Fulton Ferry. \"Have you got much of a family?\" inquired Ben, by way of being sociable. \"I\u0027ve got a little girl,\" said Martin, \"and a boy, but he\u0027s an impudent young rascal.\" \"What\u0027s his name?\" \"Rufus. He sells newspapers in front of the \u0027Times\u0027 office.\" \"The boys call him Rough and Ready, don\u0027t they?\" \"Yes. Do you know him?\" asked Martin, a little suspiciously. \"He aint a friend of yours, is he?\" \"I owe him a lickin\u0027,\" said Ben, with a show of indignation. \"So do I,\" said Martin. \"He\u0027s an impudent young rascal.\" \"So he is,\" chimed in Ben. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027d do, if I were you.\" \"What?\" \"I\u0027d disinherit him. Cut him off with a shilling\u0027.\" \"I mean to,\" said Martin, pleased to find sympathy in his dislike to his stepson. Probably the newsboy would not have suffered acute anguish, had he learned his stepfather\u0027s intention to disinherit him, as the well-known lines, \"Who steals my purse, steals trash,\" might at almost any time have been appropriately applied to Mr. Martin\u0027s purse, when he happened to carry one. Ben paid the toll at the ferry, and the two entered the boat together. He conducted Mr. Martin to the Gentleman\u0027s Cabin, where he found him a seat in the corner. James Martin sank down, and closed his eyes in a drowsy fit, produced by the liquor he had drunk. Ben took a seat opposite him. \"You\u0027re an interestin\u0027 object,\" soliloquized Ben, as he looked across the cabin at his companion \"It\u0027s a great blessin\u0027 to be an orphan, if a feller can\u0027t own a better father than that. However, I\u0027ll stick to him till I get him home. I wonder what he\u0027d say if he knowed what I was goin\u0027 with him for. If things don\u0027t go contrary, I guess I\u0027ll get the little girl away from him afore long.\" When the boat struck the Brooklyn pier, James Martin was asleep. \"There aint no hurry,\" thought Ben; \"I\u0027ll let him sleep a little while.\" After the boat had made three or four trips, Ben went across and shook Martin gently. The latter opened his eyes, and looked at him vacantly. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" he said, thickly. \"We\u0027ve got to Brooklyn,\" said Ben. \"If you want to go home, we\u0027ll have to go off the boat.\" James Martin rose mechanically, and, walking through the cabin, passed out upon the pier, and then through the gates. \"Where\u0027ll we go now?\" asked Ben. \"Is it far off?\" \"Yes,\" said Martin. \"We\u0027ll take a horse-car.\" \"All right, gov\u0027nor; just tell us what one we want, and we\u0027ll jump aboard.\" Martin was sufficiently in his senses to be able to impart this information correctly. He made no objection to Ben\u0027s paying the fare for both, which the latter did, as a matter of policy, thinking that in his present friendly relations with Mr. Martin he was likely to obtain the information he desired, with considerably less difficulty than he anticipated. On the whole, Ben plumed himself on his success, and felt that as a detective he had done very well. Martin got out at the proper place, and Ben of course got out with him. \"That\u0027s where I live,\" said Martin, pointing to the house. \"Won\u0027t you go in?\" \"Thank you for the compliment,\" said Ben; \"but I\u0027ve got some important business to attend to, and shall have to be goin\u0027. How\u0027s your headache?\" \"It\u0027s better,\" said Martin. \"Glad to hear it,\" said Ben. Martin, on entering the house, was informed of the ill-conduct of Rose, as Mrs. Waters chose to represent it, and that in consequence she had been shut up in the cellar. \"Keep her there as long as you like,\" said Martin. \"She\u0027s a bad girl, and it won\u0027t do her any harm.\" If Rose had known that an agent of her brother\u0027s was just outside the house, and was about to carry back to Rufus tidings of her whereabouts, she would have felt considerably better. There is an old saying that the hour which is darkest is just before day.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82754.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
