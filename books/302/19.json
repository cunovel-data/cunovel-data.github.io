{"id":32104,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. A PARLEY WITH THE ENEMY.","content":"It has already been stated that James Martin\u0027s motive in recovering Rose was not a feeling of affection for her, for this he had never had, but rather a desire to thwart Rufus in his plans. The newsboy\u0027s refusal to work for his support had incensed his stepfather, and Martin was a man who was willing to take considerable trouble to gratify his spite. It was quite in accordance with this disposition of his, that, after recovering Rose in the manner we have seen, he was not content, until he had seen her brother, and exulted over him. On the day succeeding, therefore, instead of going to work, he came over to New York, for the express purpose of witnessing our hero\u0027s grief and chagrin at the loss of his sister. He knew very well where to find him. Rough and Ready surveyed the approach of his stepfather with mingled anger and anxiety. He it was that held in his power the one whom the newsboy loved best. Rufus guessed his motive in seeking him now, and, knowing that he intended to speak to him, awaited his address in silence. \"Well, Rufus,\" said Mr. Martin, with a malicious grin, \"how are you this morning?\" \"I am well,\" said the newsboy, shortly. \"I am glad to hear it,\" said Martin; \"I\u0027d ought to feel glad of it, you\u0027ve been such a dootiful son.\" \"I am not your son,\" said Rough and Ready, in a tone which indicated that he was very glad that no such relationship existed between them. \"That\u0027s lucky for me,\" said Martin; \"I wouldn\u0027t own such a young cub. When I have a son, I hope he\u0027ll be more dootiful, and treat me with more gratitude.\" \"What should I be grateful for?\" demanded the newsboy, quickly. \"Didn\u0027t I take care of you, and give you victuals and clothes for years?\" \"Not that I know of,\" said Rufus, coolly. \"I\u0027ve had to support myself, and help support you, ever since we came to New York.\" \"So you complain of having to work, do you? \u0027Cause I was a poor man, and couldn\u0027t support you in idleness, you think you\u0027re ill used.\" \"I never complained of having to work. I am willing to work hard for myself—and Rose.\" \"How is Rose now? I hope she is well,\" said Martin, with a smile of triumph. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027d like to have you tell me,\" said Rufus, looking steadily at Martin. \"Where have you carried my sister?\" \"What should I know of your sister?\" said Martin. \"The last I knew, you kidnapped her from my care and protection.\" \"Your care and protection!\" repeated Rough and Ready, disdainfully. \"What care did you ever take of her? You did nothing for her support, but came home drunk about every day. You couldn\u0027t take care of yourself, much less any one else.\" \"Do you want a licking?\" asked Martin, angrily, approaching a little nearer. Rough and Ready didn\u0027t budge an inch, for he was not in the least afraid of his stepfather. \"I wouldn\u0027t advise you to try it, Mr. Martin,\" he said, composedly. \"I am able to take care of myself.\" \"Are you? I am happy to hear it,\" sneered Martin, repressing his anger, as he thought that, after all, he had it in his power to punish Rufus more effectually and safely through his sister than by any attempt at present violence. \"I\u0027m happy to hear it, for I\u0027ve relieved you of any other care. I will take care of Rose now.\" \"Where is she?\" asked Rufus, anxiously. \"She\u0027s safe,\" said Martin. \"Is that all you are going to tell me?\" \"It\u0027s all you need to know. Only, if you\u0027re very anxious to contribute to your sister\u0027s support, you can hand me the money, and it shall go for her board.\" As he looked at Martin with his air of insolent triumph, the newsboy felt that he hated him. It was not a Christian feeling, but it was a very natural one. This was the man who had made his mother\u0027s life a wretched one, and hastened her death; who in this and other ways had brought grief and trouble upon Rose and himself, and who now seemed determined to continue his persecutions, out of a spirit of miserable spite and hatred. He would hardly have been able to control his temper, but he knew that Martin would probably wreak vengeance upon his sister for anything he might do to provoke him, and he resolved, poor as the chance was, to try and see if he could not conciliate him, and induce him, if possible, to give up Rose again to his own care. \"Mr. Martin,\" he said, \"Rose will only be a trouble and expense to you. Why won\u0027t you bring her back? You don\u0027t care for her; but she is my sister, and I will willingly work for her support.\" \"Rose must stay with me,\" said Martin. \"If you\u0027re so anxious to pay her expenses, you can pay me.\" \"I want her to live with me.\" \"Sorry I couldn\u0027t accommodate you,\" said Martin, \"but your influence was bad on her. I can\u0027t allow you to be together. She\u0027s been growing a great deal wus since she was with me. I carried her yesterday to a nice, respectable boarding-place, and the fust thing she did was to get to fighting with another little gal in the house.\" \"Where was that?\" \"Maybe you\u0027d like to have me tell you.\" \"Rose is a very sweet, peaceable little girl, and if she got into trouble, the other girl was to blame.\" \"The other girl\u0027s a little angel, so her mother says, and she ought to know. Rose has got a sullen, bad temper; but I\u0027ll break her of it, see if I don\u0027t.\" \"If you ill-treat my sister, it\u0027ll be the worse for you,\" said Rough and Ready, hotly. \"Hoity-toity, I guess I can punish my child, if I see fit, without asking your leave.\" \"She isn\u0027t your child.\" \"I\u0027ve got her in my charge, and I mean to keep her.\" This was unfortunately true, and Rufus chafed inwardly that it was so. To think that his darling little Rose should be in the power of such a coarse brute was enough to fill him with anger and despair. But what could he do? Was there any way in which he could get her back? If he only knew where she was! But of this he was entirely ignorant. Indignant as he was, he must use conciliating means as long as there was any chance that these would avail anything. He thought of the money he had laid aside, and it occurred to him that Mr. Martin might be accessible to a bribe. He knew that his stepfather was very poorly provided with money, unless he had greatly improved in his habits upon his former mode of life. At all events, he could but fail, and he determined to make the attempt. \"Mr. Martin,\" he said, \"if you\u0027ll bring my sister back, and agree not to take her away from me again, I\u0027ll give you ten dollars.\" \"Have you got so much money?\" asked Martin, doubtfully. \"Yes.\" \"Where did you get it?\" \"I earned it.\" \"Have you got any more?\" \"A little.\" The newsboy did not think it expedient to let his stepfather know precisely how much he had, for he knew his demands would rise with the knowledge. \"How much more?\" persisted Martin. \"I can\u0027t exactly say.\" \"Have you got fifteen dollars?\" \"I will try to raise it, if you will bring back my sister.\" Martin hesitated. Fifteen dollars was not to be despised. This sum would enable him to live in idleness for a time. Besides he would be relieved of the expenses of Rose, and this would amount in time to considerable. As he did not pretend to feel any attachment to his stepdaughter, and didn\u0027t expect to receive any pleasure or comfort from her society, it certainly seemed to be a desirable arrangement. But, on the other hand, it was pleasant to a man like Martin to feel that he had some one in his power over whom he could exercise control, and upon whom he might expend his anger. Besides, he would keep Rufus in a constant state of trouble and anxiety, and this, too, was something. Still he did not like to give up wholly the chance of gaining the fifteen dollars. After a little hesitation, he said, \"Have you got the money with you?\" \"No.\" \"Have you any of it with you?\" \"Only a dollar or two.\" \"That won\u0027t do.\" \"Why do you ask?\" \"Because I should want part or the whole of it in advance.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t be willing to pay you in advance,\" said the newsboy, whose confidence in his stepfather\u0027s integrity was by no means large. \"Why not?\" \"I\u0027ll pay you when you bring Rose. That\u0027s fair enough.\" \"Perhaps you wouldn\u0027t have the money.\" \"Then you could carry her back again.\" \"And have all my trouble for nothing!\" \"You won\u0027t have all your trouble for nothing. I want Rose back, and I shall be sure to have the money with me.\" Mr. Martin reflected a moment. He knew that he could trust the newsboy\u0027s word. Much as he disliked him, he knew that if he made a promise he would keep it, if there was a possibility of his doing so. Fifteen dollars was quite a sum to him, for it was a long time since he had had so much, and such were his shiftless habits, that it would probably be a long time before he would have it, especially if he had to pay for the board of Rose. Again, it occurred to him that if he should surrender Rose, and receive the money, he might steal her again, and thus lose nothing But then it was probable that Rufus would guard against this by removing to a different quarter of the city, and not permitting Rose to go out unaccompanied. So there was a little conflict in his mind, and finally he came to this decision. He would not surrender Rose quite yet. He wanted to torment both her and her brother a little longer. There was time enough to make the arrangement a week hence. Perhaps by that time the newsboy would be ready to increase his offer. \"Well,\" said Rough and Ready, \"what do you say?\" \"I\u0027ll think about it.\" \"You\u0027d better decide now.\" \"No, I don\u0027t feel like it. Do you think I\u0027m ready to give up my little daughter\u0027s society, after having her with me only a day?\" and he smiled in a way that provoked Rufus, as he knew it would. \"Will you bring her to-morrow?\" asked the news boy, who felt that he must hold his anger in check. \"Maybe I\u0027ll bring her in the course of a week; that is, if she behaves herself. I must break her of some of her faults. She needs trainin\u0027.\" \"She\u0027s a good little girl.\" \"She\u0027s got to be better before I give her back. Hope you won\u0027t fret about her;\" and Martin walked away, with a half laugh, as he saw the trouble which the newsboy couldn\u0027t help showing in his face. A sudden idea came to Rufus. \"Ben,\" he said, beckoning to Ben Gibson, who had just got through with a job, \"do you see that man?\" \"The one you\u0027ve been talking with?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, what about him?\" \"I\u0027ll give you a dollar if you\u0027ll follow him, and find out where he lives. Of course he mustn\u0027t know that you are following him.\" \"Maybe he isn\u0027t going home.\" \"Never mind. Follow him if it takes you all day, and you shall have the dollar.\" \"Maybe I\u0027ll get off the track.\" \"You\u0027re too sharp for that. You see, Ben, he\u0027s carried off my little sister, and I want to find out where he has put her. Just find out for me where she is, and we\u0027ll carry her off from him.\" \"That\u0027ll be bully fun,\" said Ben. \"I\u0027m your man. Just take care of my box, and I\u0027ll see what I can do.\" Mr. Martin had turned down Spruce Street. He kept on his way, not suspecting that there was some one on his track. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82752.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
