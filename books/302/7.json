{"id":32092,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. MARTIN\u0027S AWAKENING.","content":"James Martin lay in a drunken stupor for about an hour after Rough and Ready and his sister left the room. Then he roused a little, and muttered \"Rose.\" But there was no answer. \"Rose,\" he repeated, not stirring from his recumbent position, \"have you got anything to eat in the house?\" But the little girl whom he addressed was already in her new home on Franklin Street. \"Why don\u0027t you answer?\" demanded he, angrily. \"I\u0027ll give you a licking.\" As this threat also elicited no response, he turned over and rose slowly. \"The gal isn\u0027t here,\" he said, after looking about him. \"She\u0027s gone out with her scamp of a brother. He\u0027s an obstinate young rascal. I\u0027ll give him a flogging some time.\" Martin had often had the disposition to inflict punishment upon our hero, but there was a sturdy courage and firmness about Rough and Ready that promised a determined opposition. So he had escaped where a weaker and more timid boy would have suffered bad treatment. Though Martin missed Rose he had no idea yet that she had left him for good, as the saying is. He supposed that she had gone out to stand by her brother when he was selling papers. He had often been drunk before, and probably expected to be often again. He felt no particular shame at disposing of the little girl\u0027s clothes for rum. He had somehow formed the idea that it was the newsboy\u0027s duty to support the family, and felt that he had no business to spend so much money on his sister\u0027s dress. He could not understand, therefore, why Rough and Ready should be so angry. \"Dressing up Rose like a princess!\" he muttered. \"We\u0027re too poor to spend money on good clothes I have to go about in rags, and why shouldn\u0027t she?\" Martin wore a suit which had done long and hard service. He wore a jacket of green cloth, frayed and dirty, while his other garments, originally black, were stained and patched. He wore no collar or necktie. On his head was a tall hat, which had already reached that outward condition when it is usually considered fit only to supply the place of a broken pane. Such was the stepfather of the newsboy and his sister, and when to the description I add inflamed eyes, a red face, and swollen nose, I think my young readers will hardly wonder that the children had long lost all respect and attachment for him, if indeed they had ever felt any. When I think of the comfortable home he might have had, for he was a skilful workman and capable of earning good wages, I feel out of patience with him for preferring to lead a life so degraded and useless, doing harm both to himself and to others. But, in a great city like New York, there are many men who lead lives no better than James Martin, who, for the brief pleasure of the intoxicating cup, throw away their own happiness and welfare, and spoil the happiness of others. Think of this picture, boy-reader, and resolve thus early that such a description shall never apply to you! Feeling hungry, Martin looked into the cupboard, and discovered part of a loaf of bread. He was disappointed to find no cold meat, as he had hoped. \"This is pretty poor living,\" he muttered. \"That boy must pay me more money. He don\u0027t work hard enough. How can he expect three people to live on fifty cents a day?\" It did not seem to occur to Martin that he ought to have contributed something himself to the support of the family. So, while he was eating the bread, he continued to rail against our hero, and resolved to exact from him in future sixty cents daily. \"He can pay it,—a smart boy like him,\" he muttered. \"He\u0027s lazy, that\u0027s what\u0027s the matter. He\u0027s got to turn over a new leaf.\" Having eaten up the bread, and feeling still hungry, he explored the contents of his pocket-book. It contained twenty-five cents, being half of the money he had received from the old-clothes dealer for the little girl\u0027s dress. \"That\u0027ll buy me a drink and a plate of meat,\" he thought; \"only there won\u0027t be any left. Money don\u0027t go far in these days.\" But persons who get money as this was got, are not very apt to be disturbed much by economical thoughts. \"Easy come, easy go,\" is an old adage and a true one. So Martin, reflecting that the newsboy was out earning money, of which he would receive the benefit, saw nothing to prevent his using the balance of the money to gratify the cravings of appetite. He accordingly went to a neighboring saloon, where he soon invested his money, and then, thrusting his hands in his empty pockets, strolled listlessly about the streets. Passing through the City Hall Square, he saw Rough and Ready, at a little distance, selling his papers. \"Rose isn\u0027t with him,\" said Martin to himself. \"Maybe she\u0027s gone home.\" However, this was a point in which he felt very little interest. There was no particular object in addressing the newsboy on the subject, so he wandered on in a listless way wherever caprice led. Strolling down Broadway, he turned into Dey Street, though he had no definite object in so doing. All at once he felt a touch upon his shoulder. \"Well, Martin, how goes it?\" said a stout, active-looking man, of much more respectable appearance than Martin himself. \"Hard luck!\" said Martin. \"Well, you don\u0027t look very prosperous, that\u0027s a fact. Where are you at work now?\" \"Nowhere.\" \"Can\u0027t you find work?\" \"No,\" said Martin. The fact was that he had not tried, preferring to live on the earnings of his stepson. \"That\u0027s strange,\" said the new-comer. \"Carpenters are in demand. There\u0027s a good deal of building going on in Brooklyn just now. I\u0027ll give you employment myself, if you\u0027ll come over to-morrow morning. I\u0027m putting up three houses on Fourth Avenue, and want to hurry them through as soon as possible, as they are already let, and the parties want to move in. Come, what do you say?\" \"I didn\u0027t think of going to work just yet,\" said Martin, reluctantly. \"The fact is, I don\u0027t feel quite strong.\" \"Perhaps there\u0027s a reason for that,\" said the other, significantly. \"I don\u0027t feel well, and that\u0027s all about it.\" \"Perhaps you drink a little too often.\" \"I don\u0027t drink enough to hurt me. It\u0027s all that keeps me up.\" \"Well, that\u0027s your affair, not mine. Only, if you make up your mind to go to work, come over to-morrow morning to Brooklyn, and I\u0027ll have something for you to do.\" To this Martin assented, and the builder, for such was his business, passed on. Martin had very little thought of accepting the proposal; but, as we shall see, circumstances soon brought it to his mind, and changed his determination. It is not necessary to follow Martin in his afternoon wanderings. He took no more drink, for the simple reason that he was out of money, and his credit was not good; so when evening came he was comparatively free from the influence of his earlier potations. About six o\u0027clock he went back to the room in Leonard Street. It was about that time that Rough and Ready usually went home to eat his supper, and, as he was still hungry, he proposed to eat supper with the children. But when he opened the door of the room, he was surprised to find it empty. He expected to find Rose there, at all events, even if her brother had not yet returned home. \"Rose,\" he cried out, \"where are you?\" There was no answer. \"If you\u0027re hiding anywhere, you\u0027d better come out, or I\u0027ll give you something you don\u0027t like.\" \"This is strange,\" he said to himself when again there was no reply. He went across the landing, and knocked at the door opposite. A stout woman, with her sleeves rolled up, opened the door. \"Have you seen anything of my two children, Mrs. Flanagan?\" asked Martin. \"I saw them this morning.\" \"I mean since morning.\" \"No; the boy took the little girl out about the middle of the day, and I haven\u0027t seen either one of \u0027em since.\" \"They didn\u0027t say anything to you about going out, did they?\" \"Shure they didn\u0027t, and why should they? They go out every day, for that matter.\" \"Well, it\u0027s time for them to be home now.\" \"They\u0027ll be comin\u0027 soon, it\u0027s likely;\" and Mrs. Flanagan closed her door, and went back to washing,—for this was her business. Martin returned to the lonely room, not altogether satisfied with what he had learned. It was, as he knew, quite unusual for Rose to be gone out all the afternoon, or, at any rate, not to be back at this hour. Besides, as he called to mind, she was not with Rough and Ready when he saw him in the afternoon. Where, then, could she be? It was from no particular affection for Rose that Martin put to himself these queries. But it was through Rose that he retained his hold upon Rufus and his earnings. Besides, Rose, though only seven years old, had been accustomed to get the supper, and make tea at times when Martin had not money enough to buy any beverage more stimulating. So, on the whole, he felt rather uncomfortable, and resolved to go out and find the newsboy, and learn from him where Rose was. He descended the stairs, therefore, and made his way to the sidewalk in front of the \"Times\" office, where Rough and Ready was usually to be found. But here he looked for him in vain. The fact was that our hero had sold off his papers, and a large number of them, with greater rapidity than usual, and was at this very moment sitting at Miss Manning\u0027s little table with Rose, eating a comfortable, though not very extravagant, supper. Martin went back to Leonard Street, therefore, still with a vague hope that he might find the children at home. But he was destined to be disappointed. The room was as dark and cheerless and lonely as ever. \"What does it all mean?\" thought Martin. \"Has the young rascal given me the slip?\" He had been in the room only five minutes, when there was a knock at the door. It proved to be the landlord\u0027s agent, who collected the rent. \"Your month\u0027s rent is due, Mr. Martin,\" he said. \"I haven\u0027t got any money.\" \"That answer won\u0027t do,\" said the man, shortly. \"You\u0027ll have to come again to-morrow, at any rate. My boy\u0027s got the money for the rent, and he isn\u0027t in now.\" \"You must be ready to-morrow, or move out.\" \"I guess it\u0027ll be move then, if the boy doesn\u0027t come back,\" muttered Martin. \"One good thing, he can\u0027t escape me. I can catch him to-morrow morning when he\u0027s selling papers. Rent or no rent, I\u0027ll get one more night\u0027s rest in this room.\" Although it was yet early he lay down, and did not rise till the morning light entered the room. Then, feeling the cravings of appetite, he got up, and went out in search of the newsboy. \"He won\u0027t find it quite so easy to get rid of me as he thinks for,\" muttered Martin, with a scowl. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82740.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
