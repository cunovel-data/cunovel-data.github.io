{"id":32093,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII. THE NEWSBOY AND HIS STEPFATHER.","content":"Rough and Ready passed the night at the Lodging House, as he had previously determined. The bed which he obtained there was considerably better than the one he had usually rested upon in the room in Leonard Street. He slept soundly, and only awoke when the summons came to all the boys to get up. As our hero lifted up his head, and saw the rows of beds, with boys sitting up and rubbing their eyes, the thought of his freedom from the sway of his stepfather recurred to his mind, and he jumped up in very good spirits. He breakfasted at the Lodge, paying only six cents for the meal, and then hastened to the offices of the morning papers to secure a supply of merchandise. He began to estimate his probable weekly expenses. He had agreed to pay Miss Manning four dollars a week for Rose\u0027s board and his own supper. His expenses at the Lodging House would be seventy-two cents a week. His dinner would perhaps amount to a dollar more. This would be five dollars and seventy-two cents, which he must earn at any rate. But, besides this, both Rose and himself would need clothes. Probably these would cost annually fifty dollars apiece, averaging, for the two, two dollars per week. Thus his entire expenses footed up seven dollars and seventy-two cents, or about one dollar and twenty-nine cents per working day. \"That is considerable,\" thought the newsboy. \"I wonder if I can do it.\" Some boys might have been frightened at this estimate. But Rough and Ready had good courage. He felt that his sister and he could not live comfortably for less, and he resolved that if he could not make it all by selling papers, he would get a chance to do errands, or manage in some other way to eke out the necessary amount. But he resolved to make his newspaper trade pay as much of it as possible. He went to work, therefore, with a good deal of energy, and the pile of morning papers, with which he started, melted away fast. At last he had but one left. Looking out for a purchaser for that, he saw advancing towards him an old woman, dressed in quaint, old-fashioned costume. \"Won\u0027t you let me look at that paper of yourn?\" asked the old lady. \"Certainly, ma\u0027am,\" said Rough and Ready; \"it\u0027s made to be looked at.\" \"Wait a minute. I dunno as I\u0027ve got my specs,\" said she, diving her hand into a pocket of great depth, and bringing up first a snuff-box, and next a red cotton handkerchief. \"There, I know\u0027d I\u0027d mislaid \u0027em,\" she said, in a tone of disappointment. \"Can you read, boy?\" \"More or less,\" said Rough and Ready. \"What is it you wanted?\" \"Why, you see I live to Danbury when I\u0027m at home, and I heerd tell that Roxanna Jane Pinkham was married, and I want to know ef it\u0027s true. Maybe you\u0027ll find it in the marriages.\" \"All right, ma\u0027am,\" said Rough and Ready, glancing over the paper till he came to the list of marriages. \"Is this it, ma\u0027am?\" asked the newsboy, reading, \"In Danbury, Miss Roxanna Jane Pinkham to Pompey Smith, a very respectable colored man from New York.\" \"Massy sakes!\" ejaculated the old lady. \"Has Roxanna married a nigger? Well, she must have been put to\u0027t for a husband. Thank you, boy. I\u0027d buy your paper, but I only wanted to know for certain if Roxanna was married. That does beat me,â€”her marryin\u0027 a colored person!\" \"That\u0027s a profitable customer,\" thought the newsboy. \"I guess she won\u0027t find that marriage in any of the other papers. This one has got it exclusive.\" Immediately upon her return, the old lady spread the news of Roxanna Pinkham\u0027s strange marriage, and wrote comments upon it to her daughter in Danbury. When the report was indignantly denied by the lady most interested, and she threatened to sue the old lady for circulating a slanderous report, the latter stoutly asserted that she heard it read from a New York paper, and she had no doubt there was something in it, or it wouldn\u0027t have got into print. This trick was hardly justifiable in the newsboy; but he was often troubled by people who wanted to look at his papers, but were not willing to buy them, and he repaid himself by some imaginary news of a startling description. After disposing of his last paper, he procured a fresh supply, and was engaged in selling these, when, on looking up, he saw advancing towards him James Martin, his stepfather. Before chronicling the incidents of the interview between them, we must go back to the time of Martin\u0027s awaking in the room in Leonard Street. He remembered, at once, the visit of the landlord\u0027s agent the day previous, and felt that the time for action had arrived. He knew that the scanty furniture in the room was liable to seizure for rent, and this he resolved the landlord should not get hold of. Accordingly, dressing hastily, he went round to Baxter Street, and accosted the proprietor of a general second-hand establishment, with whom he had previously had some dealings. \"I\u0027ve got some furniture to sell,\" he said. \"Do you want to buy?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said the other. \"Trade is very dull. I don\u0027t sell a dollar\u0027s worth in a day.\" \"Come, you shall have them cheap,\" said Martin. \"What have you got?\" \"Come and see.\" \"Where is it?\" \"In Leonard Street, just round the corner.\" The dealer, always ready for a bargain, was induced to climb up to the attic room, and take a look at the cheap wooden bedstead, with its scanty bedding, and the two chairs, which were about all the furniture the room contained. \"It\u0027s not worth much,\" he said. \"Well, I suppose it\u0027s worth something,\" said Martin. \"What\u0027ll you take for it?\" \"Three dollars.\" \"I\u0027ll give you one dollar.\" \"That\u0027s too bad. You ought to give me two dollars, at any rate.\" At length, after considerable chaffering, the dealer agreed to give a dollar and a quarter, which Martin pocketed with satisfaction. Just as he had effected the sale, the landlord\u0027s agent appeared. \"Have you got your rent ready?\" he asked of Martin. \"No, I haven\u0027t,\" said Martin. \"Then you must move out.\" \"I\u0027m just moving.\" \"But I shall seize the furniture,\" said the agent. \"I can\u0027t allow you to move that.\" \"Take it, if you want to,\" said Martin, in a coarse laugh. \"I\u0027ve just sold it to this man here.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" said the agent, angrily. \"Oh, well, it\u0027s nothing to me. Settle it between you,\" said Martin, carelessly, going downstairs, leaving the dealer and the agent to an animated and angry dispute over the broken-down bedstead. \"That was neatly done,\" thought Martin, laughing to himself. \"I don\u0027t care which gets it. I suppose they\u0027ll have a fight about it. Now I must have a good breakfast, and then for a talk with that young rebel. He thinks he\u0027s cheated me cleverly, but I\u0027m not through with him yet.\" Martin strayed into a restaurant at the lower end of Chatham Street, where he made a satisfactory breakfast, with as little regard to expense as if his resources were ample. Indeed, he felt little trouble about the future, being fully determined that in the future, as in the past, Rufus should support him. \"Aint I entitled to his earnings, I\u0027d like to know till he comes of age?\" thought Martin. So he convinced himself readily that law and right were on his side, and it was with no misgivings as to the result that he approached the newsboy whom, from some distance away, he saw actively engaged in plying his business. \"\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027!\" cried Rough and Ready, looking about him for possible customers. \"So I\u0027ve found you at last,\" said James Martin, grimly addressing the newsboy. \"I haven\u0027t been lost that I know of,\" said Rough and Ready, coolly. \"Where were you last night?\" \"At the Newsboys\u0027 Lodge.\" \"What made you leave home?\" \"I didn\u0027t like staying there.\" \"You\u0027re a mighty independent young man. How old do you pretend to be?\" \"Fifteen, as near as I can remember,\" said the newsboy. \"I didn\u0027t know but you were twenty-one, as you claim to be your own master,\" sneered Martin. \"I don\u0027t see why I shouldn\u0027t be my own master,\" said Rough and Ready, \"as long as I have to support myself.\" \"Aint I your father?\" \"No, you aint,\" said the newsboy, bitterly. \"You married my mother, and killed her with your ill-treatment. I don\u0027t want to have anything more to do with you.\" \"Oh, you\u0027re mighty smart. What have you done with your sister?\" \"She\u0027s safe,\" said the newsboy, shortly. \"What business had you to take her away from her home?\" demanded Martin, angrily. \"I\u0027ve got the care of her.\" \"She\u0027s my child, and you must bring her back again.\" \"Your child!\" said Rufus, contemptuously. \"You did not give a cent towards supporting her. What little you earned you spent for rum. I had to pay all the expenses, and when I bought my sister some new clothes, you were mean enough to carry them off and sell them. If it hadn\u0027t been for that, I would have left her a little while longer. But that was more than I could stand, and I\u0027ve carried her where you won\u0027t find her.\" \"Tell me, instantly, where you have carried her,\" said James Martin, stung by the newsboy\u0027s reproaches, and doggedly resolved to get the little girl back, at all hazards. \"I don\u0027t mean to tell you,\" said Rough and Ready. \"Why not?\" \"Because she is in a good place, where she will be taken care of, and I don\u0027t mean that you shall get hold of her again.\" \"You\u0027d better take care what you say,\" said Martin, his red nose growing redder still, in his angry excitement. \"I\u0027m not afraid of your threats,\" said the newsboy, quietly. \"I\u0027ve a great mind to give you a flogging on the spot.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t advise you to try it, unless you want me to call a copp.\" James Martin had no great love for the police, with whom he had before now got into difficulty. Besides, he knew that Rufus, though not as strong as himself, was strong enough to make a very troublesome resistance to any violence, and that the disturbance would inevitably attract the attention of the police. So he forbore to attack him, though he found it hard to resist the impulse. But he shook his fist menacingly at Rufus, and said, \"Some day I\u0027ll get hold of your sister, you may be sure of that, and when I do, I\u0027ll put her where you\u0027ll never set eyes on her again. Just remember that!\" He went off muttering, leaving Rufus a little troubled. He knew that his stepfather had an ugly spirit, and he feared that he would keep on the watch for Rose, and some day might get hold of her. The very thought was enough to make him tremble. He determined to warn Miss Manning of the danger which threatened his little sister, and request her to be very careful of her, keeping her continually under her eye. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82741.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
