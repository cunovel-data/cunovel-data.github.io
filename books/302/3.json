{"id":32088,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II. LITTLE ROSE.","content":"Rough and Ready had sold out his stock of morning papers, and would have no more to do until the afternoon, when the \"Evening Post\" and \"Express\" appeared. The \"Mail,\" \"Telegram,\" and \"News,\" which now give employment to so many boys, were not then in existence. I may as well take this opportunity to describe the newsboy who is to be the hero of my present story. As already mentioned, he was fifteen years old, stoutly built, with a clear, fresh complexion, and a resolute, good-humored face. He was independent and self-reliant, feeling able to work his own way without help, and possessed a tact and spirit of enterprise which augured well for his success in life. Though not so carefully dressed as most of the boys who will read this story, he was far from being as ragged as many of his fellow-newsboys. There were two reasons for this: he had a feeling of pride, which made him take some care of his clothes, and besides, until within a year, he had had a mother to look after him. In this respect he had an advantage over the homeless boys who wander about the streets, not knowing where they shall find shelter. But, within a year, circumstances had changed with our young hero. His mother had been left a widow when he was nine years old. Two years later she married a man, of whom she knew comparatively little, not from love, but chiefly that she might secure a comfortable support for her two children. This man, Martin, was a house-carpenter, and was chiefly employed in Brooklyn and New York. He removed his new wife and the children from the little Connecticut village, where they had hitherto lived, to New York, where he found lodgings for them. In the course of a few months, she found that the man she had so hastily married had a violent, and even brutal, temper, and was addicted to intemperate habits, which were constantly interfering with his prospects of steady employment. Instead of her care and labor being lessened, both were increased. The lodgings to which Martin carried his wife, at first, were respectable, but after a while there was a difficulty about the rent, and they were obliged to move. They moved frequently, each time compelled to take dirtier and shabbier accommodations. Rufus was soon taken from school, and compelled, as a newsboy, to do his part towards supporting the family. In fact, his earnings generally amounted to more than his stepfather\u0027s, who only worked irregularly. A year before the date of our story, Mrs. Martin died, solemnly intrusting to her son the charge of his little sister Rose, then six years old. \"Take good care of her,\" said the dying mother. \"You know what your stepfather is. Don\u0027t let him beat or ill-treat her. I trust her wholly to you.\" \"I\u0027ll take care of her, mother,\" said Rufus, sturdily. \"Don\u0027t be afraid for her.\" \"God will help you, Rufus,\" said the poor mother \"I am glad you are such a boy as I can trust.\" \"I aint so good as I might be, mother,\" said Rufus, touched by the scene; \"but you can trust me with Rosie.\" Mrs. Martin knew that Rufus was a sturdy and self-relying boy, and she felt that she could trust him. So her last moments were more peaceful than they would have been but for this belief. After her death, Rufus continued the main support of the household. He agreed to pay the rent,—five dollars monthly,—and fifty cents a day towards the purchase of food. This he did faithfully. He found himself obliged, besides, to buy clothing for his little sister, for his stepfather, who spent his time chiefly in bar-rooms, troubled himself very little about the little girl, except to swear at her when he was irritated. Rough and Ready gained his name partly from its resemblance in sound to his right name of Rufus, but chiefly because it described him pretty well. Any of his street associates, who attempted to impose upon him, found him a rough customer. He had a pair of strong arms, and was ready to use them when occasion seemed to require it. But he was not quarrelsome. He was generous and kind to smaller boys, and was always willing to take their part against those who tried to take advantage of their weakness. There was a certain Tom Price, a big, swaggering street-bully, a boot black by profession, with whom Rough and Ready had had more than one sharp contest, which terminated in his favor, though a head shorter than his opponent. To tell the truth, Rough and Ready, in addition to his strength, had the advantage of a few lessons in boxing, which he had received from a young man who had been at one time an inmate of the same building with himself. This knowledge served him in good stead. I hope my young readers will not infer that I am an advocate of fighting. It can hardly help being brutal under any circumstances; but where it is never resorted to except to check ruffianism, as in the case of my young hero, it is less censurable. After setting up Johnny Nolan in business, Rough and Ready crossed to the opposite side of the street, and walked up Centre Street. He stopped to buy a red-cheeked apple at one of the old women\u0027s stalls which he passed. \"Rosie likes apples,\" he said to himself. \"I suppose she\u0027s waiting to hear me come upstairs.\" He walked for about quarter of a mile, till he came in sight of the Tombs, which is situated at the north west corner of Centre and Leonard Streets, fronting on the first. It is a grim-looking building, built of massive stone. Rough and Ready did not quite go up to it, but turned off, and went down Leonard Street in an easterly direction. Leonard Street, between Centre and Baxter Streets, is wretched and squalid, not as bad perhaps as some of the streets in the neighborhood,—for example, Baxter Street,—but a very undesirable residence. Here it was, however, that our hero and his sister lived. It was not his own choice, for he would have gladly lived in a neat, clean street; but he could not afford to pay a high rent, and so was compelled to remain where he was. He paused in front of a dilapidated brick building of six stories. The bricks were defaced, and the blinds were broken, and the whole building looked miserable and neglected. There was a grocery shop kept in the lower part, and the remaining five stories were crowded with tenants, two or three families to a floor. The street was generally littered up with old wagons, in a broken-down condition, and odors far from savory rose from the garbage that was piled up here and there. Crowds of pale, unhealthy-looking children, with dirty faces, generally bare-headed and bare-footed, played about, managing, with the happy faculty of childhood, to show light-hearted gayety, even under the most unpromising circumstances. Rough and Ready, who was proud of his little sister, liked to have her appear more decently clad than most of the children in the street. Little Rose never appeared without a bonnet, and both shoes and stockings, and through envy of her more respectable appearance, some of the street girls addressed her with mock respect, as Miss Rose. But no one dared to treat her otherwise than well, when her brother was near, as his prowess was well known throughout the neighborhood. Our hero dashed up the dark and rickety stair case, two stairs at a time, ascending from story to story, until he stood on the fifth landing. A door was eagerly opened, and a little girl of seven called out joyfully:— \"Is it you, Rufus?\" At home, Rough and Ready dropped his street nickname, and was known by his proper appellation. \"Yes, Rosie. Did you get tired of waiting?\" \"I\u0027m always tired of waiting. The mornings seem so long.\" \"Yes, it must seem long to you. Did you go out and play?\" \"Only a few minutes.\" \"Didn\u0027t you want to stay?\" The little girl looked embarrassed. \"I went out a little while, but the girls kept calling me Miss Rose, and I came in.\" \"I\u0027d like to hear \u0027em!\" said Rufus, angrily. \"They don\u0027t do it when you are here. They don\u0027t dare to,\" said Rose, looking with pride at her brother, whom she looked upon as a young hero. \"They\u0027d better not,\" said the newsboy, significantly. \"They\u0027d wish they hadn\u0027t, that\u0027s all.\" \"You see I wore my new clothes,\" said Rose, by way of explanation. \"That made them think I was proud, and putting on airs. But they won\u0027t do it again.\" \"Why not?\" asked her brother, puzzled. \"Because,\" said Rose, sadly, \"I shan\u0027t wear them again.\" \"Shan\u0027t wear them!\" repeated Rough and Ready. \"Are you afraid to?\" \"I can\u0027t.\" \"Why can\u0027t you?\" \"Because I haven\u0027t got them to wear.\" Rose\u0027s lip quivered as she said this, and she looked ready to cry. \"I don\u0027t understand you, Rosie,\" said the newsboy, looking perplexed. \"Why haven\u0027t you got them, I should like to know?\" \"Because father came home, and took them away,\" said the little girl. \"What!\" exclaimed Rough and Ready, quickly. \"Took them away?\" \"Yes.\" \"What did he do that for?\" said the boy, angrily. \"He said he shouldn\u0027t let you waste your money in buying nice clothes for me. He said that my old ones were good enough.\" \"When did he take them away?\" said the boy, his heart stirred with indignation. \"Only a little while ago.\" \"Do you know where he took them, Rosie?\" \"He said he was going to take them to Baxter Street to sell. He said he wasn\u0027t going to have me dressed out like a princess, while he hadn\u0027t a cent of money in his pocket.\" Poor Rufus! He had been more than a month saving up money to buy some decent clothes for his little sister. He had economized in every possible way to accomplish it, anticipating her delight when the new hat and dress should be given her. He cared more that she should appear well than himself, for in other eyes, besides her brother\u0027s, Rose was a charming little girl. She had the same clear complexion as her brother, an open brow, soft, silken hair hanging in natural curls, fresh, rosy cheeks in spite of the unhealthy tenement-house in which she lived, and a confiding look in her dark blue eyes, which proved very attractive. Only the day before, the newsboy had brought home the new clothes, and felt abundantly rewarded by the delight of his little sister, and the improvement in her appearance. He had never before seen her looking so well. But now—he could not think of it without indignation—his intemperate stepfather had taken away the clothes which he had worked so hard to buy, and, by this time, had probably sold them for one quarter of their value at one of the old-clothes shops in Baxter Street. \"It\u0027s too bad, Rosie!\" he said. \"I\u0027ll go out, and see if I can\u0027t get them back.\" While he was speaking, an unsteady step was heard on the staircase. \"He\u0027s coming!\" said Rose, with a terrified look. A hard and resolute look came into the boy\u0027s face, as, turning towards the door, he awaited the entrance of his stepfather.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999/82736.html","bookId":302,"book":{"id":302,"title":"Rough and Ready","description":"简介： On the sidewalk in front of the Times office, facing Printing-House Square, stood a boy of fifteen, with a pile of morning papers under his arm.\u0027Herald,\u0027 \u0027Times,\u0027 \u0027Tribune,\u0027 \u0027World\u0027! he vociferated, with a quick glance at each passer-by....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2999","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
