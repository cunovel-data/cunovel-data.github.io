{"id":80704,"no":52,"title":"Page 52","content":"Holden knew that humans could tolerate extremely high g-forces over short durations. With proper safety systems, professional daredevils had sustained impacts in excess of twenty-five g\u0027s and survived. The human body deformed naturally, absorbed energy in soft tissues, and diffused impacts across larger areas. He also knew that the problem with extended exposure to high g was that the constant pressure on the circulatory system would begin exposing weaknesses. Have a weak spot in an artery that could turn into an aneurysm in forty years? A few hours at seven g might just pop it open now. Capillaries in the eyes started to leak. The eye itself deformed, sometimes causing permanent damage. And then there were the hollow spaces, like the lungs and digestive tract. You piled on enough gravity, and they collapsed. And while combat ships might maneuver at very high g for short durations, every moment spent under thrust multiplied the danger. Eros didn\u0027t need to shoot anything at them. It could just keep speeding up until their bodies exploded under the pressure. His console was showing five g, but even as he watched, it shifted to six. They couldn\u0027t keep this up. Eros was going to get away. There was nothing he could do about it. But he still didn\u0027t order Alex to stop accelerating. As if Naomi were reading his mind, WE CAN\u0027T KEEP THIS UP POPPED UP on his console, her user ID in front of the text. FRED\u0027S WORKING ON IT. THEY MIGHT NEED US TO BE WITHIN RANGE OF EROS WHEN THEY COME UP WITH A PLAN, he replied. Even moving his fingers the millimeters necessary to use the controls built into his chair for exactly this reason was painfully difficult. WITHIN RANGE FOR WHAT? NAOMI TYPED. Holden didn\u0027t answer. He had no idea. His blood was burning with drugs to keep him awake and alert even while his body was being crushed. The drugs had the contradictory effect of making his brain run at double speed while not allowing him to actually think. But Fred would come up with something. Lots of smart people were thinking about it. And Miller. Miller was lugging a fusion bomb through Eros right now. When your enemy had the tech advantage, you came at him as low-tech as you could get. Maybe one sad detective pulling a nuclear weapon on a wagon would slip through their defenses. Naomi had said they weren\u0027t magic. Maybe Miller could make it and give them the opening they needed. Either way, Holden had to be there, even if it was just to see. FRED, Naomi typed to him. Holden opened the connection. Fred looked to him like a man suppressing a grin. \"Holden,\" he said. \"How are you guys holding up?\" SIX G\u0027S. SPIT IT OUT. \"Right. So it turns out that the UN cops have been ripping Protogen\u0027s network apart, looking for clues as to what the hell\u0027s been going on. Guess who showed up as public enemy number one for the Protogen bigwigs? Yours truly. Suddenly all is forgiven, and Earth welcomes me back into her warm embrace. The enemy of my enemy thinks I am a righteous bastard.\" GOODY. MY SPLEEN IS COLLAPSING. HURRY UP. \"The idea of Eros crashing into Earth is bad enough. Extinction-level event, even if it\u0027s just a rock. But the UN people have been watching the Eros feeds, and it\u0027s scaring the shit out of them.\" AND. \"Earth is preparing to launch her entire ground-based nuclear arsenal. Thousands of nukes. They\u0027re going to vaporize that rock. The navy will intercept what\u0027s left after the initial attack and sterilize that entire area of space with constant nuclear bombardment. I know it\u0027s a risk, but it\u0027s what we have.\" Holden resisted the urge to shake his head. He didn\u0027t want to wind up with one cheek stuck to the chair permanently. EROS DODGED THE NAUVOO. IT\u0027S GOING SIX G\u0027S RIGHT NOW, AND ACCORDING TO NAOMI, MILLER FEELS NO ACCELERATION. WHATEVER IT\u0027S DOING, IT DOESN\u0027T HAVE THE SAME INERTIAL LIMITATIONS WE HAVE. WHAT\u0027S TO STOP IT FROM JUST DODGING AGAIN? AT THESE SPEEDS, THE MISSILES WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND CATCH IT. AND WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TARGETING ON? EROS DOESN\u0027T REFLECT RADAR ANYMORE. \"That\u0027s where you come in. We need you to try bouncing a laser off of it. We can use the Rocinante\u0027s targeting system to guide the missiles in.\" I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT WE\u0027LL BE OUT OF THIS GAME LONG BEFORE THOSE MISSILES SHOW. WE CAN\u0027T KEEP UP. WE CAN\u0027T GUIDE THE MISSILES IN FOR YOU. AND ONCE WE LOSE VISUAL, NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO TRACK WHERE EROS IS. \"You might have to put it on autopilot,\" Fred said. Meaning You might all have to die in the seats you\u0027re in right now. I\u0027VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DIE A MARTYR AND ALL, BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THE ROCI CAN BEAT THIS THING ON ITS OWN? I\u0027M NOT KILLING MY CREW BECAUSE YOU CAN\u0027T COME UP WITH A GOOD PLAN. Fred leaned toward the screen, his eyes narrowing. For the first time, Fred\u0027s mask slipped and Holden saw the fear and helplessness behind it. \"Look, I know what I\u0027m asking, but you know the stakes. This is what we have. I didn\u0027t call you to hear how it won\u0027t work. Either help or give up. Right now devil\u0027s advocate is just another name for asshole.\" I\u0027m crushing myself to death, probably doing permanent damage, just because I wouldn\u0027t give up, you bastard. So sorry I didn\u0027t sign my crew up to die the minute you said to do it. Having to type everything out had the advantage of restraining emotional outbursts. Instead of ripping into Fred for questioning his commitment, Holden just typed LET ME THINK ABOUT IT and cut the connection. The optical tracking system watching Eros flashed a warning to him that the asteroid was increasing speed again. The giant sitting on his chest added a few pounds as Alex pushed the Rocinante to keep up. A flashing red indicator informed Holden that because of the duration they\u0027d spent at the current acceleration, he could expect as much as 12 percent of the crew to stroke out. It would go up. Enough time, and it would reach 100 percent. He tried to remember the Roci\u0027s maximum theoretical acceleration. Alex had already flown it at twelve g briefly when they\u0027d left the Donnager. The actual limit was one of those trivial numbers, a way to brag about something your ship would never really do. Fifteen g, was it? Twenty? Miller hadn\u0027t felt any acceleration at all. How fast could you go if you didn\u0027t even feel it? Almost without realizing he was going to do it, Holden activated the master engine cutoff switch. Within seconds he was in free fall, wracked with coughs as his organs tried to find their original resting places inside his body. When Holden had recovered enough to take one really deep breath, his first in hours, Alex came on the comm. \"Cap, did you kill the engines?\" the pilot said. \"Yeah, that was me. We\u0027re done. Eros is getting away no matter what we do. We were just prolonging the inevitable, and risking some crew deaths in the process.\" Naomi turned her chair and gave him a sad little smile. She was sporting a black eye from the acceleration. \"We did our best,\" she said. Holden shoved out of his chair hard enough that he bruised his forearms on the ceiling, then shoved off hard again and pinned his back to a bulkhead by grabbing on to a fire extinguisher mount. Naomi was watching him from across the deck, her mouth a comical O of surprise. He knew he probably looked ridiculous, like a petulant child throwing a tantrum, but he couldn\u0027t stop himself. He broke free of his grip on the fire extinguisher and floated into the middle of the deck. He hadn\u0027t known he\u0027d been pounding on the bulkhead with his other fist. Now that he did, his hand hurt. \"God dammit,\" he said. \"Just God dammit.\" \"We - \" Naomi started, but he cut her off. \"We did our best? What the hell does that matter?\" Holden felt a red haze in his mind, and not all of it was from the drugs. \"I did my best to help the Canterbury, too. I tried to do the right thing when I let us be taken by the Donnager. Did my good intentions mean jack shit?\" Naomi\u0027s expression went flat. Now her eyelids dropped, and she stared at him from narrow slits. Her lips pressed together until they were almost white. They wanted me to kill you, Holden thought. They wanted me to kill my crew just in case Eros can\u0027t break fifteen g, and I couldn\u0027t do it. The guilt and rage and sorrow played against each other, turning into something thin and unfamiliar. He couldn\u0027t put a name to the feeling. \"You\u0027re the last person I\u0027d expect to hear self-pity from,\" she said, her voice tight. \"Where\u0027s the captain who\u0027s always asking, \u0027What can we do right now to make things better?\u0027 \" Holden gestured around himself helplessly. \"Show me which button to push to stop everyone on Earth from being killed, I\u0027ll push it.\" Just as long as it doesn\u0027t kill you. Naomi unbuckled her harness and floated toward the crew ladder. \"I\u0027m going below to check on Amos,\" she said, then opened the deck hatch. She paused. \"I\u0027m your operations officer, Holden. Monitoring communication lines is part of the job. I know what Fred wanted.\" Holden blinked, and Naomi pulled herself out of sight. The hatch slammed behind her with a bang that couldn\u0027t have been any harder than normal but felt like it was anyway. Holden called up to the cockpit and told Alex to take a break and get some coffee. The pilot stopped on his way through the deck, looking like he wanted to talk, but Holden just waved him on. Alex shrugged and left. The watery feeling in his gut had taken root and bloomed into a full-fledged, limb-shaking panic. Some vicious, vindictive, self-flagellating part of his mind insisted on running nonstop movies of Eros hurtling toward Earth. It would come screaming down out of the sky like every religion\u0027s vision of apocalypse made real, fire and earthquakes and pestilential rain sweeping the land. But each time Eros hit the Earth in his mind, it was the explosion of the Canterbury he saw. A shockingly sudden white light, and then nothing but the sound of ice pebbles rattling across his hull like gentle hail. Mars would survive, for a while. Pockets of the Belt would hold out even longer, probably. They had a culture of making do, surviving on scraps, living on the bleeding edge of their resources. But in the end, without Earth, everything would eventually die. Humans had been out of the gravity well a long time. Long enough to have developed the technology to cut that umbilical cord, but they\u0027d just never bothered to do it. Stagnant. Humanity, for all its desire to fling itself into every livable pocket it could reach, had become stagnant. Satisfied to fly around in ships built half a century before, using technology that hadn\u0027t changed in longer than that. Earth had been so focused on her own problems that she\u0027d ignored her far-flung children, except when asking for her share of their labors. Mars had bent her entire population to the task of remaking the planet, changing its red face to green. Trying to make a new Earth to end their reliance on the old. And the Belt had become the slums of the solar system. Everyone too busy trying to survive to spend any time creating something new. We found the protomolecule at exactly the right time for it to do the most damage to us, Holden thought. It had looked like a shortcut. A way to avoid having to do any of the work, to just jump straight to godhood. And it had been so long since anything was a real threat to humanity outside of itself that no one was even smart enough to be scared. Dresden had said it himself: The things that had made the protomolecule, loaded it into Phoebe, and shot it at the Earth were already godlike back when humanity\u0027s ancestors thought photosynthesis and the flagellum were cutting-edge. But he\u0027d taken their ancient engine of destruction and turned the key anyway, because when you got right down to it, humans were still just curious monkeys. They still had to poke everything they found with a stick to see what it did. The red haze in Holden\u0027s vision had taken on a strange strobing pattern. It took him a moment to realize that a red telltale on his panel was flashing, letting him know that the Ravi was calling. He kicked off a nearby crash couch, floated back to his station, and opened the link. \"Rocinante here, Ravi, go ahead.\" \"Holden, why are we stopped?\" McBride asked. \"Because we weren\u0027t going to keep up anyway, and the danger of crew casualties was getting too high,\" he replied. It sounded weak even to him. Cowardly. McBride didn\u0027t seem to notice. \"Roger. I\u0027m going to get new orders. Will let you know if anything changes.\" Holden killed the connection and stared blankly at the console. The visual tracking system was doing its very best to keep Eros in sight. The Roci was a good ship. State of the art. And since Alex had tagged the asteroid as a threat, the computer would do everything in its power to keep track of it. But Eros was a fast-moving, low-albedo object that didn\u0027t reflect radar. It could move unpredictably and at high speed. It was just a matter of time before they lost track of it, especially if it wanted to be lost track of. Next to the tracking information on his console, a small data window opened to inform him that the Ravi had turned on its transponder. It was standard practice even for military ships to keep them on when there was no apparent threat or need for stealth. The radio man on the little UNN corvette must have flipped it back on out of habit. And now the Roci registered it as a known vessel and threw it onto the threat display with a gently pulsing green dot and a name tag. Holden looked at it blankly for a long moment. He felt his eyes go wide. \"Shit,\" Holden said, then opened the shipwide comm. \"Naomi, I need you in ops.\" \"I think I\u0027d rather stay down here for a bit,\" she replied. Holden hit the battle station\u0027s alert button on his console. The deck lights shifted to red and a Klaxon sounded three times. \"XO Nagata to ops,\" he said. Let her chew him out later. He\u0027d have it coming. But right now he didn\u0027t have any time to waste. Naomi was on the ops deck in less than a minute. Holden had already buckled back into his crash couch and was pulling up the comm logs. Naomi pushed over to her chair and belted in as well. She gave him an inquiring look - Are we going to die after all? - but said nothing. If he said so, she would. He felt a spike of equal parts admiration for and impatience with her. He found what he was looking for in the logs before speaking. \"Okay,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve had radio contact with Miller after Eros dropped off of radar. Is that right?\" \"Yes, that\u0027s right,\" she said. \"But his suit isn\u0027t powerful enough to transmit through the shell of Eros out to much distance, so one of the moored ships is boosting the signal for him.\" \"Which means that whatever Eros is doing to kill the radar isn\u0027t killing all radio transmissions from outside.\" \"That seems right,\" Naomi said, a growing curiosity in her voice. \"And you still have the control codes for the five OPA freighters on the surface, right?\" \"Yes, sir.\" And then a moment later: \"Oh, shit.\" \"Okay,\" Holden said, turning in his chair to face Naomi with a grin. \"Why do the Roci and every other naval ship in the system have a switch to turn off their transponders?\" \"So the enemy can\u0027t get a missile lock on the transponder signal and blow them up,\" she said, sharing his grin now. Holden spun his chair back around and began opening a comm channel to Tycho Station. \"XO, would you be so kind as to use the control codes Miller gave you to turn those five OPA freighters back on and fire up their transponders? Unless our visitor on Eros can outrun radio waves, I think we\u0027ve gotten around the acceleration problem.\" \"Aye, aye, Captain,\" Naomi replied. Even looking the other way, Holden could hear the smile in her voice, and it melted the last of the ice in his gut. They had a plan. They were going to make a difference. \"Call coming in from the Ravi,\" Naomi said. \"You want it before I turn the transponders on?\" \"Hell yes.\" The line clicked. \"Captain Holden. We\u0027ve got our new orders. Seems we\u0027re going to be chasing that thing a little further.\" McBride sounded almost like someone who hadn\u0027t just been sent to her death. Stoic. \"You might want to hold off on that for a couple minutes,\" Holden said. \"We have an alternative.\" As Naomi activated the transponders on the five OPA freighters Miller had left moored to the surface of Eros, Holden laid out the plan to McBride and then, on a separate line, Fred. By the time Fred had gotten back to him with an enthusiastic approval of the plan from both him and the UN Naval command, the five freighters were pinging away, telling the solar system where they were. An hour after that, the largest swarm of interplanetary nuclear weapons in the history of humanity had been fired and were winging their way toward Eros. We\u0027re going to win, Holden thought as he watched the missiles take flight like a swarm of angry red dots on his threat display. We\u0027re going to beat this thing. And what was more, his crew was going to see the end of it. No one else had to die. Except... \"Miller\u0027s calling,\" Naomi said. \"Probably noticed we turned his ships back on.\" Holden had a wrenching feeling in his stomach. Miller would be there, on Eros, when those missiles arrived. Not everyone would get to celebrate the coming victory. \"Hey. Miller. How you doing?\" he said, not quite able to keep the funereal tone out of his voice. Miller\u0027s voice was choppy, and half drowned by static, but not so garbled that Holden couldn\u0027t hear the tone in it and know that he was about to take a piss all over their parade. \"Holden,\" Miller said. \"We have a problem.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-52.html","bookId":2454,"book":{"id":2454,"title":"Leviathan Wakes (Expanse #1)","description":"Storyline: Leviathan Wakes is a 2011 science fiction novel by James S.
