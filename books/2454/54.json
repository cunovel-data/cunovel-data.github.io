{"id":80706,"no":54,"title":"Page 54","content":"Actually, we\u0027ve sort of figured out how to solve the problem,\" Holden replied.\n \"I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m linking you to my suit\u0027s med data,\" Miller said.\n A few seconds later, four columns of numbers popped up in a small window on Holden\u0027s console. It all looked fairly normal, though there were subtleties that only a med-tech, like Shed, would be able to interpret correctly.\n \"Okay,\" Holden said. \"That\u0027s great. You\u0027re getting a little irradiated, but other than that - \"\n Miller cut him off.\n \"Am I suffering from hypoxia?\" he said.\n The data from his suit showed 87 mmHg, comfortably above baseline.\n \"No,\" Holden said.\n \"Anything that would make a guy hallucinate or get demented? Alcohol, opiates. Something like that?\"\n \"Not that I can see,\" Holden said, growing impatient. \"What\u0027s this about? Are you seeing things?\"\n \"Just the usual,\" Miller replied. \"I wanted to get that shit out the way, because I know what you\u0027re going to say next.\"\n He stopped talking, and the radio hissed and popped in Holden\u0027s ear. When Miller spoke again after several seconds of silence, his voice had taken on a different tone. It wasn\u0027t quite pleading, but close enough to make Holden shift uncomfortably in his seat.\n \"She\u0027s alive.\"\n There was only one she in Miller\u0027s universe. Julie Mao. \"Uh, okay. Not sure how to respond to that.\"\n \"You\u0027ll have to take my word that I\u0027m not having a nervous breakdown or psychotic episode or anything like that. But Julie\u0027s in here. She\u0027s driving Eros.\"\n Holden looked at the suit\u0027s medical data again, but it kept reporting normal readings, all the numbers except for radiation comfortably in the green. His blood chemistry didn\u0027t even look like he was particularly stressed for a guy carrying a fusion bomb to his own funeral.\n \"Miller, Julie\u0027s dead. We both saw the body. We saw what the protomolecule... did to it.\"\n \"We saw her body, sure. We just assumed she was dead because of the damage - \"\n \"She didn\u0027t have a heartbeat,\" Holden said. \"No brain activity, no metabolism. That\u0027s pretty much the definition of dead.\"\n \"How do we know what dead looks like to the protomolecule?\"\n \"We - \" Holden started, then stopped. \"We don\u0027t, I guess. But no heartbeat, that\u0027s a pretty good start.\"\n Miller laughed.\n \"We\u0027ve both seen the feeds, Holden. Those rib cages equipped with one arm that drag themselves around, think they have a heartbeat? This shit hasn\u0027t been playing by our rules since day one, you expect it to start now?\"\n Holden smiled to himself. Miller was right.\n \"Okay, so what makes you think Julie isn\u0027t just a rib cage and a mass of tentacles?\"\n \"She might be, but it\u0027s not her body I\u0027m talking about,\" Miller said. \"She\u0027s in here. Her mind. It\u0027s like she\u0027s flying her old racing pinnace. The Razorback. She\u0027s been babbling about it on the radio for hours now, and I just didn\u0027t put it together. But now that I have, it\u0027s pretty goddamn clear.\"\n \"Why is she headed toward Earth?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Miller said. He sounded excited, interested. More alive than Holden had ever heard him. \"Maybe the protomolecule wants to get there and it\u0027s messing with her. Julie wasn\u0027t the first person to get infected, but she\u0027s the first one that survived long enough to get somewhere. Maybe she\u0027s the seed crystal and everything that the protomolecule\u0027s doing is built on her. I don\u0027t know that, but I can find out. I just need to find her. Talk to her.\"\n \"You need to get that bomb to wherever the controls are and set it off.\"\n \"I can\u0027t do that,\" Miller said. Because of course he couldn\u0027t.\n It doesn\u0027t matter, Holden thought. In a little less than thirty hours, you\u0027re both radioactive dust.\n \"All right. Can you find your girl in less than\" - Holden had the Roci do a revised time of impact for the incoming missiles - \"twenty-seven hours?\"\n \"Why? What happens in twenty-seven hours?\"\n \"Earth fired her entire interplanetary nuclear arsenal at Eros a few hours ago. We just turned the transponders on in the five freighters you parked on the surface. The missiles are targeting them. The Roci is guessing twenty-seven hours to impact based on the current acceleration curve. The Martian and UN navies are on their way to sterilize the area after detonation. Make sure nothing survives or slips the net.\"\n \"Jesus.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Holden said with a sigh. \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t tell you sooner. I\u0027ve had a lot going on, and it sort of slipped my mind.\"\n There was another long silence on the line.\n \"You can stop them,\" Miller said. \"Shut down the transponders.\"\n Holden spun his chair around to face Naomi. Her face had the same what did he just say? look that he knew was on his own. She pulled the suit\u0027s medical data over to her console, then called up the Roci\u0027s medical expert system and began running a full medical diagnostic. The implication was clear. She thought something was wrong with Miller that wasn\u0027t immediately apparent from the data they were getting. If the protomolecule had infected him, used him as a last-ditch misdirection...\n \"Not a chance, Miller. This is our last shot. If we blow this one, Eros can orbit the Earth, spraying brown goo all over it. No way we take that risk.\"\n \"Look,\" Miller said, his tone alternating between the earlier pleading and a growing frustration. \"Julie is in here. If I can find her, a way to talk to her, I can stop this without the nukes.\"\n \"What, ask the protomolecule to pretty please not infect the Earth, when that was what it was designed to do? Appeal to its better nature?\"\n Miller paused for a moment before speaking again.\n \"Look, Holden, I think I know what\u0027s going on here. This thing was intended to infect single-celled organisms. The most basic forms of life, right?\"\n Holden shrugged, then remembered there was no video feed and said, \"Okay.\"\n \"That didn\u0027t work, but it\u0027s a smart bastard. Adaptive. It got into a human host, a complex multicelled organism. Aerobic. Huge brain. Nothing like what it was built for. It\u0027s been improvising ever since. That mess on the stealth ship? That was its first try. We saw what it was doing with Julie in that Eros bathroom. It was learning how to work with us.\"\n \"Where are you going with this?\" Holden said. There was no time pressure yet, with the missiles still more than a day away, but he couldn\u0027t quite keep the impatience out of his voice.\n \"All I\u0027m saying is Eros now isn\u0027t what the protomolecule\u0027s designers planned on. It\u0027s their original plan laid over the top of billions of years of our evolution. And when you improvise, you use what you\u0027ve got. You use what works. Julie\u0027s the template. Her brain, her emotions are all over this thing. She sees this run to Earth as a race, and she\u0027s crowing about winning. Laughing at you because you can\u0027t keep up.\"\n \"Wait,\" Holden said.\n \"She\u0027s not attacking Earth, she\u0027s going home. For all we know, she\u0027s not heading for Earth at all. Luna, maybe. She grew up there. The protomolecule piggybacked on her structure, her brain. And so she infected it as much as it infected her. If I can make her understand what\u0027s really going on, then maybe I can negotiate with her.\"\n \"How do you know that?\"\n \"Call it a hunch,\" Miller said. \"I\u0027m good with hunches.\"\n Holden whistled, the entire situation doing a flip-flop in his head. The new perspective was dizzying.\n \"But the protomolecule still wants to obey its program,\" Holden said. \"And we have no idea what that is.\"\n \"I can damn sure tell you it isn\u0027t wiping humans out. The things that shot Phoebe at us two billion years ago didn\u0027t know what the hell humans were. Whatever it wants to do needed biomass, and it\u0027s got that now.\"\n Holden couldn\u0027t stop himself from snorting at that.\n \"So, what? They don\u0027t mean us any harm? Seriously? You think if we explain that we\u0027d rather not have it land on Earth, then it will just agree and go somewhere else?\"\n \"Not it,\" Miller said. \"Her.\"\n Naomi looked up at Holden, shaking her head. She wasn\u0027t seeing anything organic wrong with Miller either.\n \"I\u0027ve been working this case for, shit, almost a year,\" Miller said. \"I\u0027ve climbed into her life, read her mail, met her friends. I know her. She\u0027s about as independent as a person can be, and she loves us.\"\n \"Us?\" Holden asked.\n \"People. She loves humans. She gave up being the little rich girl and joined the OPA. She backed the Belt because it was the right thing to do. No way she kills us if she knows that\u0027s what\u0027s happening. I just need to find a way to explain. I can do this. Give me a chance.\"\n Holden ran a hand through his hair, grimacing at the accumulating grease. A day or two at high g was not conducive to regular showering.\n \"Can\u0027t do it,\" Holden said. \"Stakes are too high. We\u0027re going ahead with the plan. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"She\u0027ll beat you,\" Miller said.\n \"What?\"\n \"Okay, maybe she won\u0027t. You\u0027ve got a shitload of firepower. But the protomolecule\u0027s figured out how to get around inertia. And Julie? She\u0027s a fighter, Holden. If you take her on, my money\u0027s on her.\"\n Holden had seen the video of Julie fighting off her attackers on board the stealth ship. She\u0027d been methodical and ruthless in her own defense. She\u0027d fought without giving quarter. He\u0027d seen the wildness in her eyes when she felt trapped and threatened. Only her attackers\u0027 combat armor had kept her from doing a lot more damage before they took her down.\n Holden felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up at the idea of Eros actually fighting. So far it had been content to run from their clumsy attacks. What happened when it went to war?\n \"You could find her,\" Holden said, \"and use the bomb.\"\n \"If I can\u0027t get through to her,\" Miller said, \"that\u0027s my deal. I\u0027ll find her. I\u0027ll talk to her. If I can\u0027t get through, I\u0027ll take her out, and you can turn Eros into a cinder. I\u0027m fine with that. But you have to give me time to try it my way first.\"\n Holden looked at Naomi looking back at him. Her face was pale. He wanted to see the answer in her expression, to know what he should do based on what she thought. He didn\u0027t. It was his call.\n \"Do you need more than twenty-seven hours?\" Holden finally asked.\n He heard Miller exhale loudly. There was gratitude in his voice that was, in its own way, worse than the pleading had been.\n \"I don\u0027t know. There are a couple thousand kilometers of tunnels down here, and none of the transit systems work. I have to walk everywhere pulling this damn wagon. Not to mention the fact that I don\u0027t really know what I\u0027m even looking for. But give me a little time, I\u0027ll figure it.\"\n \"And you know that if this doesn\u0027t work, you\u0027ll have to kill her. Yourself and Julie?\"\n \"I know.\"\n Holden had the Roci calculate how long it would take Eros to reach the Earth at the current rate of acceleration. The missiles from Earth were covering the distance a lot faster than Eros was. The IPBMs were just overpowered Epstein drives with nuclear bombs riding up front. Their acceleration limits were the functional limits of the Epstein drive itself. If the missiles didn\u0027t arrive, it would still take nearly a week for Eros to get to Earth, even if it kept a constant rate of acceleration.\n There was some flexibility in there.\n \"Hold on, let me work something out here,\" Holden said to Miller, then muted the connection. \"Naomi, the missiles are flying in a straight line toward Eros, and the Roci thinks they\u0027ll intercept it in about twenty-seven hours, give or take. How much time do we buy if we turn that straight line into a curve? How much of a curve can we do and still give the missiles a chance to catch Eros before it gets too close?\"\n Naomi tipped her head to one side, looking at him suspiciously through narrowed eyes.\n \"What are you about to do?\" she said.\n \"Maybe give Miller a chance to head off the first interspecies war.\"\n \"You trust Miller?\" she said with surprising vehemence. \"You think he\u0027s insane. You threw him off the ship because you thought he was a psychopath and a killer, and now you\u0027re going to let him speak for humanity to an alien God-thing that wants to rip us to shreds?\"\n Holden had to suppress a smile. Telling an angry woman was how attractive her anger made her would make it stop being cute very quickly. And besides that, he needed it to make sense to her. That was how he\u0027d know if he was right.\n \"You told me once that Miller was right, even when I thought he was wrong.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t make it a blanket statement,\" Naomi said, spacing her words out like she was speaking to an idiot child. \"I said he was right to shoot Dresden. That doesn\u0027t mean Miller\u0027s stable. He\u0027s in the process of committing suicide, Jim. He\u0027s fixated on this dead girl. I can\u0027t even begin to imagine what might be going through his head right now.\"\n \"Agreed. But he\u0027s there, on the scene, and he\u0027s got a keen eye for observation and just plain figuring shit out. This guy tracked us to Eros based on the ship name we picked. That\u0027s pretty damned impressive. He\u0027d never even met me, and he knew me well enough from researching me to know I\u0027d like naming my ship after Don Quixote\u0027s horse.\"\n Naomi laughed. \"Really? Is that where that comes from?\"\n \"So when he says that he knows Julie, I believe him.\"\n Naomi started to say something, then paused.\n \"You think she\u0027ll beat the nukes?\" Naomi said, more softly.\n \"He thinks she can. And he thinks he can talk her into not killing us all. I have to give him that chance. I owe it to him.\"\n \"Even if it means killing Earth?\"\n \"No,\" Holden said. \"Not that much.\"\n Naomi paused again. Her anger faded.\n \"So delay the impact, not abort,\" Naomi said.\n \"Buy him some time. How much can we get?\"\n Naomi frowned, looking at the readouts. He could almost see the options clicking through her mind. She smiled, her fierceness gone now, replaced by the mischievous look she got when she knew she was being really clever.\n \"As much as you want.\"\n \"You want to do what?\" Fred asked.\n \"Pull the nukes off course for a while to buy Miller some time, but not so much that we can\u0027t still use them to destroy Eros if we need to,\" Holden said.\n \"It\u0027s simple,\" Naomi added. \"I\u0027m sending you detailed instructions.\"\n \"Give me the overview,\" Fred said.\n \"Earth has targeted their missiles on the five freighter transponders on Eros,\" Naomi said, pulling her plan up as an overlay on the comm video. \"You have ships and stations all over the Belt. You use the transponder reconfiguring program you gave us way back when, and you keep shifting those transponder codes to ships or stations along these vectors to pull the missiles into a long arc that eventually wraps back around to Eros.\"\n Fred shook his head.\n \"Won\u0027t work. The minute UNN Command sees we\u0027re doing it, they\u0027ll just tell the missiles to stop following those particular codes, and they\u0027ll try to figure out some other way to target Eros,\" he said. \"And they\u0027ll also be really pissed at us.\"\n \"Yeah, they\u0027re going to be pissed all right,\" Holden said. \"But they\u0027re not going to get their missiles back. Just before you start leading the missiles off course, we\u0027re going to launch a massive hacking attempt from multiple locations on the missiles.\"\n \"So they\u0027ll assume an enemy is trying to trick them, and shut down mid-flight reprogramming,\" Fred said.\n \"Yep,\" Holden replied. \"We\u0027ll tell them we\u0027re going to trick them so they stop listening, and once they\u0027re not listening, we\u0027ll trick them.\"\n Fred shook his head again, this time giving Holden the vaguely frightened look of a man who wanted to back slowly out of the room.\n \"There is no way in hell I am going along with this,\" he said. \"Miller isn\u0027t going to work some magical deal with the aliens. We\u0027re going to wind up nuking Eros no matter what. Why delay the inevitable?\"\n \"Because,\" Holden said. \"I\u0027m starting to think it might be less dangerous this way. If we use the missiles without taking out Eros\u0027 command center... brain... whatever, we don\u0027t know if it\u0027ll work, but I\u0027m pretty sure our chances go down. Miller\u0027s the only one who can do that. And these are his terms.\"\n Fred said something obscene.\n \"If Miller doesn\u0027t manage to talk to it, he\u0027ll take it out. I do trust him for that,\" Holden said. \"Come on, Fred, you know these missile designs as well as I do. Better. They put enough fuel pellets in those drives to fly around the solar system twice. We aren\u0027t losing anything by giving Miller a little more time.\"\n Fred shook his head a third time. Holden saw his face go hard. He wasn\u0027t going to buy it. Before he could say no, Holden said, \"Remember that box with the protomolecule samples, and all the lab notes? Want to know what my price is for it?\"\n \"You,\" Fred said slowly, drawing it out, \"are out of your God damn mind.\"\n \"Want to buy it or what?\" Holden replied. \"You want the magic ticket to a seat at the table? You know my price now. Give Miller his chance, and the sample\u0027s yours.\"\n \"I\u0027d be curious to know how you talked them into it,\" Miller said. \"I was thinking I was probably screwed.\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t matter,\" Holden said. \"We bought you your time. Go find the girl and save humanity. We\u0027ll be waiting to hear back.\" And ready to nuke you into dust if we don\u0027t remained unsaid. There was no need.\n \"I\u0027ve been thinking about where to go, if I can talk to her,\" Miller said. He had the already lost hopefulness of a man with a lottery ticket. \"I mean, she\u0027s got to park this thing somewhere.\"\n If we live. If I can save her. If the miracle is true.\n Holden shrugged, even though no one could see it.\n \"Give her Venus,\" he said. \"It\u0027s an awful place.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-54.html","bookId":2454,"book":{"id":2454,"title":"Leviathan Wakes (Expanse #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Leviathan Wakes is a 2011 science fiction novel by James S.
