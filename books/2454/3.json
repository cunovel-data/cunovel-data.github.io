{"id":80655,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Detective Miller sat back on the foam-core chair, smiling gentle encouragement while he scrambled to make sense of the girl\u0027s story. \"And then it was all pow! Room full up with bladeboys howling and humping shank,\" the girl said, waving a hand. \"Look like a dance number, \u0027cept that Bomie\u0027s got this look he didn\u0027t know nothing never and ever amen. You know, que?\" Havelock, standing by the door, blinked twice. The squat man\u0027s face twitched with impatience. It was why Havelock was never going to make senior detective. And why he sucked at poker. Miller was very good at poker. \"I totally,\" Miller said. His voice had taken on the twang of an inner level resident. He waved his hand in the same lazy arc the girl used. \"Bomie, he didn\u0027t see. Forgotten arm.\" \"Forgotten fucking arm, yeah,\" the girl said as if Miller had spoken a line of gospel. Miller nodded, and the girl nodded back like they were two birds doing a mating dance. The rent hole was three cream-and-black-fleck-painted rooms - bathroom, kitchen, living room. The struts of a pull-down sleeping loft in the living room had been broken and repaired so many times they didn\u0027t retract anymore. This near the center of Ceres\u0027 spin, that wasn\u0027t from gravity so much as mass in motion. The air smelled beery with old protein yeast and mushrooms. Local food, so whoever had bounced the girl hard enough to break her bed hadn\u0027t paid enough for dinner. Or maybe they did, and the girl had chosen to spend it on heroin or malta or MCK. Her business, either way. \"Follow que?\" Miller asked. \"Bomie vacuate like losing air,\" the girl said with a chuckle. \"Bang-head hops, kennis tu?\" \"Ken,\" Miller said. \"Now, all new bladeboys. Overhead. I\u0027m out.\" \"And Bomie?\" The girl\u0027s eyes made a slow track up Miller, shoes to knees to porkpie hat. Miller chuckled. He gave the chair a light push, sloping up to his feet in the low gravity. \"He shows, and I asked, que si?\" Miller said. \"Como no?\" the girl said. Why not? The tunnel outside was white where it wasn\u0027t grimy. Ten meters wide, and gently sloping up in both directions. The white LED lights didn\u0027t pretend to mimic sunlight. About half a kilometer down, someone had rammed into the wall so hard the native rock showed through, and it still hadn\u0027t been repaired. Maybe it wouldn\u0027t be. This was the deep dig, way up near the center of spin. Tourists never came here. Havelock led the way to their cart, bouncing too high with every step. He didn\u0027t come up to the low gravity levels very often, and it made him awkward. Miller had lived on Ceres his whole life, and truth to tell, the Coriolis effect up this high could make him a little unsteady sometimes too. \"So,\" Havelock said as he punched in their destination code, \"did you have fun?\" \"Don\u0027t know what you mean,\" Miller said. The electrical motors hummed to life, and the cart lurched forward into the tunnel, squishy foam tires faintly squeaking. \"Having your outworld conversation in front of the Earth guy?\" Havelock said. \"I couldn\u0027t follow even half of that.\" \"That wasn\u0027t Belters keeping the Earth guy out,\" Miller said. \"That was poor folks keeping the educated guy out. And it was kind of fun, now you mention it.\" Havelock laughed. He could take being teased and keep on moving. It was what made him good at team sports: soccer, basketball, politics. Miller wasn\u0027t much good at those. Ceres, the port city of the Belt and the outer planets, boasted two hundred fifty kilometers in diameter, tens of thousands of kilometers of tunnels in layer on layer on layer. Spinning it up to 0.3 g had taken the best minds at Tycho Manufacturing half a generation, and they were still pretty smug about it. Now Ceres had more than six million permanent residents, and as many as a thousand ships docking in any given day meant upping the population to as high as seven million. Platinum, iron, and titanium from the Belt. Water from Saturn, vegetables and beef from the big mirror-fed greenhouses on Ganymede and Europa, organics from Earth and Mars. Power cells from Io, Helium-3 from the refineries on Rhea and Iapetus. A river of wealth and power unrivaled in human history came through Ceres. Where there was commerce on that level, there was also crime. Where there was crime, there were security forces to keep it in check. Men like Miller and Havelock, whose business it was to track the electric carts up the wide ramps, feel the false gravity of spin fall away beneath them, and ask low-rent glitz whores about what happened the night Bomie Chatterjee stopped collecting protection money for the Golden Bough Society. The primary station house for Star Helix Security, police force and military garrison for the Ceres Station, was on the third level from the asteroid\u0027s skin, two kilometers square and dug into the rock so high Miller could walk from his desk up five levels without ever leaving the offices. Havelock turned in the cart while Miller went to his cubicle, downloaded the recording of their interview with the girl, and reran it. He was halfway through when his partner lumbered up behind him. \"Learn anything?\" Havelock asked. \"Not much,\" Miller said. \"Bomie got jumped by a bunch of unaffiliated local thugs. Sometimes a low-level guy like Bomie will hire people to pretend to attack him so he can heroically fight them off. Ups his reputation. That\u0027s what she meant when she called it a dance number. The guys that went after him were that caliber, only instead of turning into a ninja badass, Bomie ran away and hasn\u0027t come back.\" \"And now?\" \"And now nothing,\" Miller said. \"That\u0027s what I don\u0027t get. Someone took out a Golden Bough purse boy, and there\u0027s no payback. I mean, okay, Bomie\u0027s a bottom-feeder, but... \" \"But once they start eating the little guys, there\u0027s less money coming up to the big guys,\" Havelock said. \"So why hasn\u0027t the Golden Bough meted out some gangster justice?\" \"I don\u0027t like this,\" Miller said. Havelock laughed. \"Belters,\" he said. \"One thing goes weird and you think the whole ecosystem\u0027s crashing. If the Golden Bough\u0027s too weak to keep its claims, that\u0027s a good thing. They\u0027re the bad guys, remember?\" \"Yeah, well,\" Miller said. \"Say what you will about organized crime, at least it\u0027s organized.\" Havelock sat on the small plastic chair beside Miller\u0027s desk and craned to watch the playback. \"Okay,\" Havelock said. \"What the hell is the \u0027forgotten arm\u0027?\" \"Boxing term,\" Miller said. \"It\u0027s the hit you didn\u0027t see coming.\" The computer chimed and Captain Shaddid\u0027s voice came from the speakers. \"Miller? Are you there?\" \"Mmm,\" Havelock said. \"Bad omen.\" \"What?\" the captain asked, her voice sharp. She had never quite overcome her prejudice against Havelock\u0027s inner planet origins. Miller held up a hand to silence his partner. \"Here, Captain. What can I do for you?\" \"Meet me in my office, please.\" \"On my way,\" he said. Miller stood, and Havelock slid into his chair. They didn\u0027t speak. Both of them knew that Captain Shaddid would have called them in together if she\u0027d wanted Havelock to be there. Another reason the man would never make senior detective. Miller left him alone with the playback, trying to parse the fine points of class and station, origin and race. Lifetime\u0027s work, that. Captain Shaddid\u0027s office was decorated in a soft, feminine style. Real cloth tapestries hung from the walls, and the scent of coffee and cinnamon came from an insert in her air filter that cost about a tenth of what the real foodstuffs would have. She wore her uniform casually, her hair down around her shoulders in violation of corporate regulations. If Miller had ever been called upon to describe her, the phrase deceptive coloration would have figured in. She nodded to a chair, and he sat. \"What have you found?\" she asked, but her gaze was on the wall behind him. This wasn\u0027t a pop quiz; she was just making conversation. \"Golden Bough\u0027s looking the same as Sohiro\u0027s crew and the Loca Greiga. Still on station, but... distracted, I guess I\u0027d call it. They\u0027re letting little things slide. Fewer thugs on the ground, less enforcement. I\u0027ve got half a dozen mid-level guys who\u0027ve gone dark.\" He\u0027d caught her attention. \"Killed?\" she asked. \"An OPA advance?\" An advance by the Outer Planets Alliance was the constant bogeyman of Ceres security. Living in the tradition of Al Capone and Hamas, the IRA and the Red Martials, the OPA was beloved by the people it helped and feared by the ones who got in its way. Part social movement, part wannabe nation, and part terrorist network, it totally lacked an institutional conscience. Captain Shaddid might not like Havelock because he was from down a gravity well, but she\u0027d work with him. The OPA would have put him in an airlock. People like Miller would only rate getting a bullet in the skull, and a nice plastic one at that. Nothing that might get shrapnel in the ductwork. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he said. \"It doesn\u0027t smell like a war. It\u0027s... Honestly, sir, I don\u0027t know what the hell it is. The numbers are great. Protection\u0027s down, unlicensed gambling\u0027s down. Cooper and Hariri shut down the underage whorehouse up on six, and as far as anyone can tell, it hasn\u0027t started up again. There\u0027s a little more action by independents, but that aside, it\u0027s all looking great. It just smells funny.\" She nodded, but her gaze was back on the wall. He\u0027d lost her interest as quickly as he\u0027d gotten it. \"Well, put it aside,\" she said. \"I have something. New contract. Just you. Not Havelock.\" Miller crossed his arms. \"New contract,\" he said slowly. \"Meaning?\" \"Meaning Star Helix Security has accepted a contract for services separate from the Ceres security assignment, and in my role as site manager for the corporation, I\u0027m assigning you to it.\" \"I\u0027m fired?\" he said. Captain Shaddid looked pained. \"It\u0027s additional duty,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll still have the Ceres assignments you have now. It\u0027s just that, in addition... Look, Miller, I think this is as shitty as you do. I\u0027m not pulling you off station. I\u0027m not taking you off the main contract. This is a favor someone down on Earth is doing for a shareholder.\" \"We\u0027re doing favors for shareholders now?\" Miller asked. \"You are, yes,\" Captain Shaddid said. The softness was gone; the conciliatory tone was gone. Her eyes were dark as wet stone. \"Right, then,\" Miller said. \"I guess I am.\" Captain Shaddid held up her hand terminal. Miller fumbled at his side, pulled out his own, and accepted the narrow-beam transfer. Whatever this was, Shaddid was keeping it off the common network. A new file tree, labeled JMAO, appeared on his readout. \"It\u0027s a little-lost-daughter case,\" Captain Shaddid said. \"Ariadne and Jules-Pierre Mao.\" The names rang a bell. Miller pressed his fingertips onto the screen of his hand terminal. \"Mao-Kwikowski Mercantile?\" he asked. \"The one.\" Miller whistled low. Maokwik might not have been one of the top ten corporations in the Belt, but it was certainly in the upper fifty. Originally, it had been a legal firm involved in the epic failure of the Venusian cloud cities. They\u0027d used the money from that decades-long lawsuit to diversify and expand, mostly into interplanetary transport. Now the corporate station was independent, floating between the Belt and the inner planets with the regal majesty of an ocean liner on ancient seas. The simple fact that Miller knew that much about them meant they had enough money to buy and sell men like him on open exchange. He\u0027d just been bought. \"They\u0027re Luna-based,\" Captain Shaddid said. \"All the rights and privileges of Earth citizenship. But they do a lot of shipping business out here.\" \"And they misplaced a daughter?\" \"Black sheep,\" the captain said. \"Went off to college, got involved with a group called the Far Horizons Foundation. Student activists.\" \"OPA front,\" Miller said. \"Associated,\" Shaddid corrected him. Miller let it pass, but a flicker of curiosity troubled him. He wondered which side Captain Shaddid would be on if the OPA attacked. \"The family put it down to a phase. They\u0027ve got two older children with controlling interest, so if Julie wanted to bounce around vacuum calling herself a freedom fighter, there was no real harm.\" \"But now they want her found,\" Miller said. \"They do.\" \"What changed?\" \"They didn\u0027t see fit to share that information.\" \"Right.\" \"Last records show she was employed on Tycho Station but maintained an apartment here. I\u0027ve found her partition on the network and locked it down. The password is in your files.\" \"Okay,\" Miller said. \"What\u0027s my contract?\" \"Find Julie Mao, detain her, and ship her home.\" \"A kidnap job, then,\" he said. \"Yes.\" Miller stared down at his hand terminal, flicking the files open without particularly looking at them. A strange knot had tied itself in his guts. He\u0027d been working Ceres security for sixteen years, and he hadn\u0027t started with many illusions in place. The joke was that Ceres didn\u0027t have laws - it had police. His hands weren\u0027t any cleaner than Captain Shaddid\u0027s. Sometimes people fell out airlocks. Sometimes evidence vanished from the lockers. It wasn\u0027t so much that it was right or wrong as that it was justified. You spent your life in a stone bubble with your food, your water, your air shipped in from places so distant you could barely find them with a telescope, and a certain moral flexibility was necessary. But he\u0027d never had to take a kidnap job before. \"Problem, Detective?\" Captain Shaddid asked. \"No, sir,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll take care of it.\" \"Don\u0027t spend too much time on it,\" she said. \"Yes, sir. Anything else?\" Captain Shaddid\u0027s hard eyes softened, like she was putting on a mask. She smiled. \"Everything going well with your partner?\" \"Havelock\u0027s all right,\" Miller said. \"Having him around makes people like me better by contrast. That\u0027s nice.\" Her smile\u0027s only change was to become half a degree more genuine. Nothing like a little shared racism to build ties with the boss. Miller nodded respectfully and headed out. His hole was on the eighth level, off a residential tunnel a hundred meters wide with fifty meters of carefully cultivated green park running down the center. The main corridor\u0027s vaulted ceiling was lit by recessed lights and painted a blue that Havelock assured him matched the Earth\u0027s summer sky. Living on the surface of a planet, mass sucking at every bone and muscle, and nothing but gravity to keep your air close, seemed like a fast path to crazy. The blue was nice, though. Some people followed Captain Shaddid\u0027s lead by perfuming their air. Not always with coffee and cinnamon scents, of course. Havelock\u0027s hole smelled of baking bread. Others opted for floral scents or semipheromones. Candace, Miller\u0027s ex-wife, had preferred something called EarthLily, which had always made him think of the waste recycling levels. These days, he left it at the vaguely astringent smell of the station itself. Recycled air that had passed through a million lungs. Water from the tap so clean it could be used for lab work, but it had been piss and shit and tears and blood and would be again. The circle of life on Ceres was so small you could see the curve. He liked it that way. He poured a glass of moss whiskey, a native Ceres liquor made from engineered yeast, then took off his shoes and settled onto the foam bed. He could still see Candace\u0027s disapproving scowl and hear her sigh. He shrugged apology to her memory and turned back to work. Juliette Andromeda Mao. He read through her work history, her academic records. Talented pinnace pilot. There was a picture of her at eighteen in a tailored vac suit with the helmet off: pretty girl with a thin, lunar citizen\u0027s frame and long black hair. She was grinning like the universe had given her a kiss. The linked text said she\u0027d won first place in something called the Parrish/Dorn 500K. He searched briefly. Some kind of race only really rich people could afford to fly in. Her pinnace - the Razorback - had beaten the previous record and held it for two years. Miller sipped his whiskey and wondered what had happened to the girl with enough wealth and power to own a private ship that would bring her here. It was a long way from competing in expensive space races to being hog-tied and sent home in a pod. Or maybe it wasn\u0027t. \"Poor little rich girl,\" Miller said to the screen. \"Sucks to be you, I guess.\" He closed the files and drank quietly and seriously, staring at the blank ceiling above him. The chair where Candace used to sit and ask him about his day stood empty, but he could see her there anyway. Now that she wasn\u0027t here to make him talk, it was easier to respect the impulse. She\u0027d been lonely. He could see that now. In his imagination, she rolled her eyes. An hour later, his blood warm with drink, he heated up a bowl of real rice and fake beans - yeast and fungus could mimic anything if you had enough whiskey first - opened the door of his hole, and ate dinner looking out at the traffic gently curving by. The second shift streamed into the tube stations and then out of them. The kids who lived two holes down - a girl of eight and her brother of four - met their father with hugs, squeals, mutual accusations, and tears. The blue ceiling glowed in its reflected light, unchanging, static, reassuring. A sparrow fluttered down the tunnel, hovering in a way that Havelock assured him they couldn\u0027t on Earth. Miller threw it a fake bean. He tried to think about the Mao girl, but in truth he didn\u0027t much care. Something was happening to the organized crime families of Ceres, and it made him jumpy as hell. This thing with Julie Mao? It was a sideshow.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-3.html","bookId":2454,"book":{"id":2454,"title":"Leviathan Wakes (Expanse #1)","description":"Storyline: Leviathan Wakes is a 2011 science fiction novel by James S.
