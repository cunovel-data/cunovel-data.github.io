{"id":80709,"no":57,"title":"Page 57","content":"Frederick Lucius Johnson. Former colonel in Earth\u0027s armed forces, Butcher of Anderson Station. Thoth Station now too. Unelected prime minister of the OPA. He had faced his own mortality a dozen times, lost friends to violence and politics and betrayal. He\u0027d lived through four assassination attempts, only two of which were on any record. He\u0027d killed a pistol-wielding attacker using only a table knife. He\u0027d given the orders that had ended hundreds of lives, and stood by his decisions.\\n\\n And yet public speaking still made him nervous as hell. It didn\u0027t make sense, but there it was.\\n\\n Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads -\\n\\n \"General Sebastian will be at the reception,\" his personal secretary said. \"Remember not to ask after her husband.\"\\n\\n \"Why? I didn\u0027t kill him, did I?\"\\n\\n \"No, sir. He\u0027s having a very public affair, and the general\u0027s a bit touchy about it.\"\\n\\n \"So she might want me to kill him.\"\\n\\n \"You can make the offer, sir.\"\\n\\n The \"greenroom\" was actually done in red and ochre, with a black leather couch, a mirrored wall, and a table laid out with hydroponic strawberries and carefully mineralized drinking water. The head of Ceres security, a dour-faced woman named Shaddid, had escorted him from the dock to the conference facilities three hours earlier. Since then, he\u0027d been pacing - three steps in one direction, turn, three steps back - like the captain of an ancient ship of the line on his quarterdeck.\\n\\n Elsewhere in the station, the representatives of the formerly warring factions were in rooms of their own, with secretaries of their own. Most of them hated Fred, which wasn\u0027t particularly a problem. Most of them feared him too. Not because of his standing in the OPA, of course. Because of the protomolecule.\\n\\n The political rift between Earth and Mars was probably irreparable; the Earth forces loyal to Protogen had engineered a betrayal too deep for apologies, and too many lives had been lost on both sides for the coming peace to look anything like it had been before. The naive among the OPA thought this was a good thing: an opportunity to play one planet against the other. Fred knew better. Unless all three forces - Earth, Mars, and the Belt - could reach a real peace, they would inevitably fall back into a real war.\\n\\n Now if only Earth or Mars thought of the Belt as something more than an annoyance to be squashed after their true enemy was humiliated... But in truth, anti-Mars sentiment on Earth was higher now than it had been during the shooting war, and Martian elections were only four months away. A significant shift in the Martian polity could ease the tensions or make things immeasurably worse. Both sides had to see the big picture.\\n\\n Fred stopped before a mirror, adjusted his tunic for the hundredth time, and grimaced.\\n\\n \"When did I turn into a damned marriage counselor?\" he said.\\n\\n \"We aren\u0027t still talking about General Sebastian, are we, sir?\"\\n\\n \"No. Forget I said anything. What else do I need to know?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a possibility that Blue Mars will try to disrupt your presentation. Hecklers and signs, not guns. Captain Shaddid has several Blues in custody, but some may have slipped past her.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"You have interviews scheduled with two political narrowcasts and a news source based on Europa. The Europa interviewer is likely to ask about Anderson Station.\"\\n\\n \"All right. Anything new from Venus?\"\\n\\n \"Something\u0027s happening down there,\" his secretary said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not dead, then.\"\\n\\n \"Apparently not, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Great,\" he said bitterly.\\n\\n Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads. On one hand there is the very real threat of mutual annihilation, and on the other -\\n\\n And on the other, there\u0027s the bogeyman of Venus, getting ready to crawl up out of its well and slaughter you all in your sleep. I have the live sample, which is your best, if not only, hope of divining what its intentions and capabilities are, and which I have hidden so that you can\u0027t just march over and take it from me. It\u0027s the only reason any of you are listening to me in the first place. So how about a little respect here?\\n\\n His secretary\u0027s terminal chirped, and she consulted it briefly.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Captain Holden, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Do I have to?\"\\n\\n \"It would be best if he felt he was part of the effort, sir. He has a track record of amateur press releases.\"\\n\\n \"Fine. Bring him in.\"\\n\\n The weeks that had passed since Eros Station had come apart in the thick skies of Venus had been good to Holden, but prolonged high-g dives like the one the Rocinante had sustained chasing Eros had long-lasting effects. The burst blood vessels in the man\u0027s sclera had healed; the pressure bruising was gone from around his eyes and the back of his neck. Only a little hesitation in the way he walked spoke of the deep joint pain, cartilage still on its way back to its natural form. Acceleration swagger, they\u0027d called it, back when Fred had been a different man.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" Holden said. \"You\u0027re looking pretty. Did you see the latest feed from Venus? Two-kilometer-high crystal towers. What do you think that is?\"\\n\\n \"Your fault?\" Fred suggested, keeping the tone friendly. \"You could have told Miller to drive it into the sun.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, because two-kilometer-high crystal towers coming out of the sun wouldn\u0027t be creepy at all,\" Holden said. \"Are those strawberries?\"\\n\\n \"Have some,\" Fred said. He hadn\u0027t been able to eat anything since that morning.\\n\\n \"So,\" Holden said around a mouthful of fruit, \"are they really going to sue me over this?\"\\n\\n \"Unilaterally giving away all mineral and development rights to an entire planet on an open radio channel?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Holden said.\\n\\n \"I would guess the people who actually owned those rights are probably going to sue you,\" Fred said. \"If they ever figure out who they are.\"\\n\\n \"Could you give me a hand with that?\" Holden asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be a character witness,\" Fred said. \"I don\u0027t actually make the law.\"\\n\\n \"Then what exactly are you all doing here? Couldn\u0027t there be some kind of amnesty? We retrieved the protomolecule, tracked down Julie Mao on Eros, broke Protogen, and saved Earth.\"\\n\\n \"You saved Earth?\"\\n\\n \"We helped,\" Holden said, but his voice had a more somber tone. Miller\u0027s death still bothered the captain. Fred knew how that felt. \"It was a joint effort.\"\\n\\n Fred\u0027s personal secretary cleared her throat and glanced toward the door. They\u0027d need to go soon.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do what I can,\" Fred said. \"I\u0027ve got a lot of other things on the plate, but I\u0027ll do what I can.\"\\n\\n \"And Mars can\u0027t have the Roci back,\" Holden said. \"Right of salvage says that\u0027s my ship now.\"\\n\\n \"They aren\u0027t going to see it that way, but I will do what I can.\"\\n\\n \"You keep saying that.\"\\n\\n \"It keeps being all I can do.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ll tell them about him, right?\" Holden said. \"Miller. He deserves the credit.\"\\n\\n \"The Belter who went back into Eros of his own free will in order to save Earth? You\u0027re damn right I\u0027m going to tell them about him.\"\\n\\n \"Not \u0027the Belter.\u0027 Him. Josephus Aloisus Miller.\"\\n\\n Holden had stopped eating the free strawberries. Fred crossed his arms.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been reading up,\" Fred said.\\n\\n \"Yeah. Well. I didn\u0027t know him all that well.\"\\n\\n \"Neither did anybody else,\" Fred said, and then softened a little. \"I know it\u0027s hard, but we don\u0027t need a real man with a complex life. We need a symbol of the Belt. An icon.\"\\n\\n \"Sir,\" the secretary said. \"We really do need to go now.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what got us here,\" Holden said. \"Icons. Symbols. People without names. All of those Protogen scientists were thinking about biomass and populations. Not Mary who worked in supply and raised flowers in her spare time. None of them killed her.\"\\n\\n \"You think they wouldn\u0027t have?\"\\n\\n \"I think if they were going to, they owed it to her to know her name. All their names. And you owe it to Miller not to make him into something he wasn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Fred laughed. He couldn\u0027t help it.\\n\\n \"Captain,\" he said, \"if you\u0027re saying that I should amend my address to the peace conference so that it wasn\u0027t a noble Belter sacrificing himself to save the Earth - if you\u0027re suggesting that I say something like \u0027We happened to have a suicidal ex-cop on-site\u0027 instead - you understand this process less than I thought you did. Miller\u0027s sacrifice is a tool, and I\u0027m going to use it.\"\\n\\n \"Even if it makes him faceless,\" Holden said. \"Even if it makes him something he never was?\"\\n\\n \"Especially if it makes him something he never was,\" Fred said. \"Do you remember what he was like?\"\\n\\n Holden frowned and then something flickered in his eyes. Amusement. Memory.\\n\\n \"He was kind of a pain in the ass, wasn\u0027t he?\" Holden said.\\n\\n \"That man could take a visitation from God with thirty underdressed angels announcing that sex was okay after all and make it seem vaguely depressing.\"\\n\\n \"He was a good man,\" Holden said.\\n\\n \"He wasn\u0027t,\" Fred said. \"But he did his job. And now I\u0027ve got to go do mine.\"\\n\\n \"Give \u0027em hell,\" Holden said. \"And amnesty. Keep talking up the amnesty.\"\\n\\n Fred walked down the curving hallway, his secretary close behind him. The conference halls had been designed for smaller things. Petty ones. Hydroponics scientists getting away from their husbands and wives and children to get drunk and talk about raising bean sprouts. Miners coming together to lecture each other about waste minimization and tailings disposal. High school band competitions. And instead, these work carpets and brushed-stone walls were going to have to bear the fulcrum of history. It was Holden\u0027s fault that the shabby, small surroundings reminded him of the dead detective. They hadn\u0027t before.\\n\\n The delegations were seated across the aisle from each other. The generals and political appointees and general secretaries of Earth and Mars, the two great powers together at his invitation to Ceres, to the Belt. Territory made neutral because neither side took it seriously enough to be concerned about their demands.\\n\\n All of history had brought them here, to this moment, and now, in the next few minutes, Fred\u0027s job was to change that trajectory. The fear was gone. Smiling, he stepped up to the speaker\u0027s dais, the podium.\\n\\n The pulpit.\\n\\n There was a scattering of polite applause. A few smiles, and a few frowns. Fred grinned. He wasn\u0027t a man anymore. He was a symbol, an icon. A narrative about himself and about the forces at play in the solar system.\\n\\n And for a moment, he was tempted. In that hesitation between drawing breath and speaking, part of him wondered what would happen if he shed the patterns of history and spoke about himself as a man, about the Joe Miller who he\u0027d known briefly, about the responsibility they all shared to tear down the images they held of one another and find the genuine, flawed, conflicted people they actually were.\\n\\n It would have been a noble way to fail.\\n\\n \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said. \"We stand at a crossroads. On one hand, there is the very real threat of mutual annihilation. On the other... \"\\n\\n He paused for effect.\\n\\n \"On the other, the stars.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-57.html","bookId":2454,"book":{"id":2454,"title":"Leviathan Wakes (Expanse #1)","description":"Storyline: Leviathan Wakes is a 2011 science fiction novel by James S.
