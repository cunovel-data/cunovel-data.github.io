{"id":80678,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Miller gestured at Holden and headed for the elevator without waiting to see if he was following. The presumption irritated him, but he went anyway.\\n\\n \"So,\" Holden said, \"we were just in a gunfight where we killed at least three people, and now we\u0027re just leaving? No getting questioned or giving a statement? How exactly does that happen?\" Holden asked.\\n\\n \"Professional courtesy,\" Miller said, and Holden couldn\u0027t tell if he was joking.\\n\\n The elevator door opened with a muffled ding, and Holden and the others followed Miller inside. Naomi was closest to the panel, so she reached out to press the lobby button, but her hand was shaking so badly that she had to stop and clench it into a fist. After a deep breath, she reached out a now steady finger and pressed the button.\\n\\n \"This is bullshit. Being an ex-cop doesn\u0027t give you a license to get in gunfights,\" Holden said to Miller\u0027s back.\\n\\n Miller didn\u0027t move, but he seemed to shrink a little bit. His sigh was heavy and unforced. His skin seemed grayer than before.\\n\\n \"Sematimba knows the score. Half the job is knowing when to look the other way. Besides, I promised we wouldn\u0027t leave the station without letting him know.\"\\n\\n \"Fuck that,\" Amos said. \"You don\u0027t make promises for us, pal.\"\\n\\n The elevator came to a stop and opened onto the bloody scene of the gunfight. A dozen cops were in the room. Miller nodded at them and they nodded back. He led the crew out of the lobby to the corridor, then turned around.\\n\\n \"We can work that out later,\" Miller said. \"Right now, let\u0027s get someplace we can talk.\"\\n\\n Holden agreed with a shrug. \"Okay, but you\u0027re paying.\"\\n\\n Miller headed off down the corridor toward the tube station.\\n\\n As they followed, Naomi put a hand on Holden\u0027s arm and slowed him down a bit so that Miller could get ahead. When he was far enough away, she said, \"He knew her.\"\\n\\n \"Who knew who?\"\\n\\n \"He,\" Naomi said, nodding at Miller, \"knew her.\" She jerked her head back toward the crime scene behind them.\\n\\n \"How do you know?\" Holden said.\\n\\n \"He wasn\u0027t expecting to find her there, but he knew who she was. Seeing her like that was a shock.\"\\n\\n \"Huh, I didn\u0027t get that at all. He\u0027s seemed like Mr. Cool all through this.\"\\n\\n \"No, they were friends or something. He\u0027s having trouble dealing with it, so maybe don\u0027t push him too hard,\" she said. \"We might need him.\"\\n\\n The hotel room Miller got was only slightly better than the one they\u0027d found the body in. Alex immediately headed for the bathroom and locked the door. The sound of water running in the sink wasn\u0027t quite loud enough to cover the pilot\u0027s retching.\\n\\n Holden plopped down on the small bed\u0027s dingy comforter, forcing Miller to take the room\u0027s one uncomfortable-looking chair. Naomi sat next to Holden on the bed, but Amos stayed on his feet, prowling around the room like a nervous animal.\\n\\n \"So, talk,\" Holden said to Miller.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s wait for the rest of the gang to finish up,\" Miller replied with a nod toward the bathroom.\\n\\n Alex came out a few moments later, his face still white, but now freshly washed.\\n\\n \"Are you all right, Alex?\" Naomi asked in a soft voice.\\n\\n \"Five by five, XO,\" Alex said, then sat down on the floor and put his head in his hands.\\n\\n Holden stared at Miller and waited. The older man sat and played with his hat for a minute, then tossed it onto the cheap plastic desk that cantilevered out from the wall.\\n\\n \"You knew Julie was in that room. How?\" Miller said.\\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t even know her name was Julie,\" Holden replied. \"We just knew that it was someone from the Scopuli.\"\\n\\n \"You should tell me how you knew that,\" Miller said, a frightening intensity in his eyes.\\n\\n Holden paused a moment. Miller had killed someone who had been trying to kill them, and that certainly helped make the case that he was a friend, but Holden wasn\u0027t about to sell out Fred and his group on a hunch. He hesitated, then went halfway.\\n\\n \"The fictional owner of the Scopuli had checked into that flophouse,\" he said. \"It made sense that it was a member of the crew raising a flag.\"\\n\\n Miller nodded. \"Who told you?\" he said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not comfortable telling you that. We believed the information was accurate,\" Holden replied. \"The Scopuli was the bait that someone used to kill the Canterbury. We thought someone from the Scopuli might know why everyone keeps trying to kill us.\"\\n\\n Miller said, \"Shit,\" and then leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been looking for Julie. You\u0027d hoped we were looking for her too. That we knew something,\" Naomi said, not making it a question.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Miller said.\\n\\n It was Holden\u0027s turn to ask why.\\n\\n \"Parents sent a contract to Ceres looking for her to be sent home. It was my case,\" Miller said.\\n\\n \"So you work for Ceres security?\"\\n\\n \"Not anymore.\"\\n\\n \"So what are you doing here?\" Holden asked.\\n\\n \"Her family was connected to something,\" Miller replied. \"I just naturally hate a mystery.\"\\n\\n \"And how did you know it was bigger than just a missing girl?\"\\n\\n Talking to Miller felt like digging through granite with a rubber chisel. Miller grinned humorlessly.\\n\\n \"They fired me for looking too hard.\"\\n\\n Holden consciously decided not to be annoyed by Miller\u0027s non-answer. \"So let\u0027s talk about the death squad in the hotel.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, seriously, what the fuck?\" Amos said, finally pausing in his pacing. Alex took his head out of his hands and looked up with interest for the first time. Even Naomi leaned forward on the edge of the bed.\\n\\n \"No idea,\" Miller replied. \"But someone knew you were coming.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, thanks for the brilliant police work,\" Amos said with a snort. \"No way we woulda figured that out on our own.\"\\n\\n Holden ignored him. \"But they didn\u0027t know why, or they would have already gone up to Julie\u0027s room and gotten whatever they wanted.\"\\n\\n \"Does that mean Fred\u0027s been compromised?\" Naomi said.\\n\\n \"Fred?\" Miller asked.\\n\\n \"Or maybe someone figured out the Polanski thing too, but didn\u0027t have a room number,\" Holden said.\\n\\n \"But why come out guns blazing like that?\" Amos said. \"Doesn\u0027t make any sense to shoot us.\"\\n\\n \"That was a mistake,\" Miller said. \"I saw it happen. Amos here drew his gun. Somebody overreacted. They were yelling cease-fire right up until you folks started shooting back.\"\\n\\n Holden began ticking off points on his fingers.\\n\\n \"So someone finds out we\u0027re headed to Eros, and that it is related to the Scopuli. They even know the hotel, but not the room.\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t know it\u0027s Lionel Polanski either,\" Naomi said. \"They could have looked it up at the desk, just like we did.\"\\n\\n \"Right. So they wait for us to show, and have a squad of gunmen ready to take us in. But that goes to shit and it turns into a gunfight in the lobby. They absolutely don\u0027t see you coming, Detective, so they aren\u0027t omniscient.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" Miller said. \"The whole thing screams last minute. Grab you guys and find out what you\u0027re looking for. If they\u0027d had more time, they could have just searched the hotel. Might have taken two or three days, but it could have been done. They didn\u0027t, so that means grabbing you was easier.\"\\n\\n Holden nodded. \"Yes,\" he said. \"But that means that they already had teams here. Those didn\u0027t seem like locals to me.\"\\n\\n Miller paused, looking disconcerted.\\n\\n \"Now you say it, me either,\" he agreed.\\n\\n \"So whoever it is, they already have teams of gunmen on Eros, and they can redeploy them to come at a moment\u0027s notice to pick us up,\" Holden said.\\n\\n \"And enough pull with security that they could have a firefight and nobody came,\" Miller said. \"Police didn\u0027t know anything was happening until I called them.\"\\n\\n Holden cocked his head to one side, then said, \"Shit, we really need to get out of here.\"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" Alex said loudly. \"Just wait a goddamn minute here. How come no one is talkin\u0027 about the mutant horror show in that room? Was I the only one that saw that?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Jesus, what was that all about?\" Amos said quietly.\\n\\n Miller reached into his coat pocket and took out the evidence bag with Julie\u0027s hand terminal in it.\\n\\n \"Any of you guys a techie?\" he asked. \"Maybe we could find out.\"\\n\\n \"I could probably hack it,\" Naomi said. \"But there\u0027s no way I\u0027m touching that thing until we know what did that to her and that it isn\u0027t catching. I\u0027m not pushing my luck by handling anything she\u0027s touched.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to touch it. Keep the bag sealed. Just use it right through the plastic. The touch screen should still work.\"\\n\\n Naomi paused for a second, then reached out and took the bag.\\n\\n \"Okay, give me a minute,\" she said, then set to work on it.\\n\\n Miller leaned back in his chair again, letting out another heavy sigh.\\n\\n \"So,\" Holden said. \"Did you know Julie before this? Naomi seems to think finding her dead like that really knocked you for a loop.\"\\n\\n Miller shook his head slowly. \"You get a case like that, you look into whoever it is. You know, personal stuff. Read their e-mail. Talk to the people they know. You get a picture.\"\\n\\n Miller stopped talking and rubbed his eyes with his thumbs. Holden didn\u0027t push him, but he started talking again anyway.\\n\\n \"Julie was a good kid,\" Miller said as if he were confessing something. \"She flew a mean racing ship. I just... I wanted to get her back alive.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s got a password,\" Naomi said, holding up the terminal. \"I could hack the hardware, but I\u0027d have to open the case.\"\\n\\n Miller reached out and said, \"Let me give it a try.\"\\n\\n Naomi handed the terminal to him, and he tapped a few characters on the screen and handed it back.\\n\\n \"Razorback,\" Naomi said. \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a sled,\" Miller replied.\\n\\n \"Is he talking to us?\" Amos said, pointing his chin at Miller. \" \u0027Cause there\u0027s no one else here, but I swear half the time I don\u0027t know what the fuck he\u0027s on about.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" Miller said. \"I\u0027ve been working more or less solo. Makes for bad habits.\"\\n\\n Naomi shrugged and went back to work with Holden and Miller now looking over her shoulders.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s got a lot of stuff on here,\" Naomi said. \"Where to start?\"\\n\\n Miller pointed at a text file simply labeled notes sitting on the terminal\u0027s desktop.\\n\\n \"Start there,\" he said. \"She\u0027s a fanatic about putting things in the right folders. If she left that on the desktop, it means she wasn\u0027t sure where it went.\"\\n\\n Naomi tapped on the document to open it up. It expanded into a loosely organized collection of text that read like someone\u0027s diary.\\n\\n First off, get your shit together. Panic doesn\u0027t help. It never helps. Deep breaths, figure this out, make the right moves. fear is the mind-killer. Ha. Geek.\\n\\n Shuttle Pros:\\n\\n No reactor, just batteries. V. low radiation.\\n\\n Supplies for eight\\n\\n Lots of reaction mass\\n\\n Shuttle Cons:\\n\\n No Epstein, no torch\\n\\n Comm not just disabled, but physically removed (feeling a little paranoid about leaks, guys?)\\n\\n Closest transit is Eros. Is that where we were going? Maybe go someplace else? On just teakettle, this is gonna be a slow boat. Another transit adds seven more weeks. Eros, then.\\n\\n I\u0027ve got the Phoebe bug, no way around it. Not sure how, but that brown shit was everywhere. It\u0027s anaerobic, must have touched some. Doesn\u0027t matter how, just work the problem.\\n\\n I just slept for THREE WEEKS. Didn\u0027t even get up to pee. What does that?\\n\\n I\u0027m so fucked.\\n\\n Things you need to remember:\\n\\n * BA834024112\\n\\n * Radiation kills. No reactor on this shuttle, but keep the lights off. Keep the e-suit on. Video asshat said this thing eats radiation. Don\u0027t feed it.\\n\\n * Send up a flag. Get some help. You work for the smartest people in the system. They\u0027ll figure something out.\\n\\n * Stay away from people. Don\u0027t spread the bug. Not coughing up the brown goo yet. No idea when that starts.\\n\\n * Keep away from bad guys - as if you know who they are. Fine. So keep away from everyone. Incognito is my name. Hmm. Polanski?\\n\\n Damn. I can feel it. I\u0027m hot all the time, and I\u0027m starving. Don\u0027t eat. Don\u0027t feed it. Feed a cold, starve a flu? Other way around? Eros is a day out, and then help is on the way. Keep fighting.\\n\\n Safe on Eros. Sent up the flag. Hope the home office is watching. Head hurts. Something\u0027s happening on my back. Lump over my kidneys. Darren turned into goo. Am I going to be a suit full of jelly?\\n\\n Sick now. Things coming out of my back and leaking that brown stuff everywhere. Have to take the suit off. If you read this, don\u0027t let anyone touch the Brown stuff. Burn me. I\u0027m burning up.\\n\\n Naomi put the terminal down, but no one spoke for a moment. Finally, Holden said, \"Phoebe bug. Anyone have an idea?\"\\n\\n \"There was a science station on Phoebe,\" Miller said. \"Inner planets place, no Belters allowed. It got hit. Lots of dead people, but... \"\\n\\n \"She talks about being on a shuttle,\" Naomi said. \"The Scopuli didn\u0027t have a shuttle.\"\\n\\n \"There had to be another ship,\" Alex said. \"Maybe she got the shuttle off it.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" Holden said. \"They got on another ship, they got infected with this Phoebe bug, and the rest of the crew... I don\u0027t know. Dies?\"\\n\\n \"She gets out, not realizing she\u0027s infected till she\u0027s on the shuttle,\" Naomi continued. \"She comes here, she sends up the flag to Fred, and she dies in that hotel room of the infection.\"\\n\\n \"Not, however, turned to goo,\" Holden said. \"Just really badly... I don\u0027t know. Those tubes and bone spurs. What kind of disease does that?\"\\n\\n The question hung in the air. Again no one spoke. Holden knew they were all thinking the same thing. They hadn\u0027t touched anything in the flophouse room. Did that mean they were safe from it? Or did they have the Phoebe bug, whatever the hell it was? But she\u0027d said anaerobic. Holden was pretty sure that meant you couldn\u0027t get it by breathing it in the air. Pretty sure...\\n\\n \"Where do we go from here, Jim?\" Naomi asked.\\n\\n \"How about Venus?\" Holden said, his voice higher and tighter than he\u0027d expected. \"Nothing interesting happening on Venus.\"\\n\\n \"Seriously,\" Naomi said.\\n\\n \"Okay. Seriously, I think Miller there lets his cop friend know the story, and then we get the hell off of this rock. It\u0027s got to be a bioweapon, right? Someone steals it off a Martian science lab, seeds this shit in a dome, a month later every human being in the city is dead.\"\\n\\n Amos interrupted with a grunt.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s some holes in that, Cap\u0027n,\" Amos said. \"Like what the fuck does that have to do with taking down the Cant and the Donnager?\"\\n\\n Holden looked Naomi in the eye and said, \"We have a place to look now, don\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, we do,\" she said. \"BA834024112. That\u0027s a rock designation.\"\\n\\n \"What do you think is out there?\" Alex asked.\\n\\n \"If I was a betting man, I\u0027d say it\u0027s whatever ship she stole that shuttle from,\" Holden replied.\\n\\n \"Makes sense,\" Naomi said. \"Every rock in the Belt is mapped. You want to hide something, put it in a stable orbit next to one and you can always find it later.\"\\n\\n Miller turned toward Holden, his face even more drawn.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re going there, I want in,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Holden asked. \"No offense, but you found your girl. Your job\u0027s over, right?\"\\n\\n Miller looked at him, his lips a thin line.\\n\\n \"Different case,\" Miller said. \"Now it\u0027s about who killed her.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-26.html","bookId":2454,"book":{"id":2454,"title":"Leviathan Wakes (Expanse #1)","description":"Storyline: Leviathan Wakes is a 2011 science fiction novel by James S.
