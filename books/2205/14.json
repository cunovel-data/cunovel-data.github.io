{"id":101780,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Um... Paen?... Paen?... Helloooo?\n Sam?\n Oh, good, I was hoping you didn\u0027t have your mental voice mail turned on.\n My what?\n Nothing. Little joke.\n Very little.\n Yeah, well, you try making a joke when you\u0027re caught between realities, and see how well you do.\n A pause filled my head. You\u0027re caught between realities?\n Yes. I seem to be stuck here. I was wondering if there was something you could do to help me out?\n His silence was telling. Where are you?\n I don\u0027t think I\u0027m anywhere, to be honest. I seem to be nowhere, caught in some sort of a web between reality and the beyond.\n Then how do you expect me to help you?\n We have to pass through this to get to the beyond. I was hoping you\u0027d merge with me, and that would pull me out. Kind of a reverse of what I did with you earlier.\n Or it might just pull me in.\n True. I hesitated, hating to ask him for anything, but not seeing any other choice. I\u0027d been stuck here for the last couple of hours as I tried everything I knew to get out, to no avail. Can you help me, please?\n He didn\u0027t answer, but I knew the moment he merged with me, the two of us like separate pools of mercury forming into one glorious entity. Joined as we were, I could feel everything he felt, and what it was he was thinking.\n And he could do likewise.\n He had to know I was trying to avoid confronting the emotions that swirled around in me, a vortex of love and anger and pain. But he said nothing as the merging pulled me back into reality, separating us into two people again.\n I found myself standing in my office at the window, blinking at the bright afternoon sun that poured in and spilled into a warm pool on the floor. Thanks, Paen. I appreciate that.\n I wish to talk to you about what\u0027s happened.\n Sorry, can\u0027t right now. Things to do, places to go, people to curse.\n What?\n Nothing. Another little joke.\n Sam -\n Signing off for now. I\u0027ll see you for dinner later. Bye.\n I\u0027m just outside your office -\n La la la, my fingers are in my ears and I can\u0027t hear you!\n You\u0027re not listening to me with your ears, woman. I\u0027ll be at your office in twenty seconds or less, and then we will discuss the situation.\n It wasn\u0027t easy to tune him out of my mind, but I did it. I hurried out the front way so I wouldn\u0027t run into him coming in the back, my soul bleeding tears of anguish. I just about cried salty ones when I got to Diviners\u0027 House and discovered that the shoebox in my bag was empty.\n \"Sam? Are you all right?\" Jake asked as I stared numbly at the inside of the empty shoebox.\n \"No, I\u0027m not all right. I\u0027m just about as far from all right as you can possibly get and still be alive. God damn it, Jake! Someone stole my statue!\"\n He gave me a thin-lipped look. \"After what you told me about being shot by that man Pilar, I\u0027d think it would be a relief to have it off your hands.\"\n I narrowed my eyes as I thought back to the visit to Caspar\u0027s house. \"I bet it was Pilar who zapped me. I bet he stole the statue while I was immobile between realities. How on earth am I going to get it back?\"\n \"Why do you want it back? It sounds to me like it hasn\u0027t brought you anything but bad luck.\"\n \"It\u0027s mine,\" I said, putting the empty box back into my bag. \"The demon gave it to me. Yes, by mistake, but both Clare and I were shot for it - that means I have the right to get to the bottom of what it is, and why Pilar wants it so bad. Thanks, Jake. Sorry to disrupt your day for nothing.\"\n He saw me to the door, stopping me briefly as I stood on the doorstep, soaking in the warmth of the sunshine. \"So, this thing with you and Paen - I can\u0027t tell you how happy I am that you\u0027ve found someone at last. I wasn\u0027t sure about him, since Dark Ones tend to be a bit intense, but he seems like a nice bloke. I wish you both an eternity of happiness. One question - should I be buying a wedding present anytime soon?\"\n The sun went behind a cloud. Pain gripped my chest and didn\u0027t allow me to breathe. \"No,\" I said, and left.\n I was pretty much on autopilot all the way back to the office, finding my way to the correct bus, getting off at the correct stop, and walking the two blocks to the office without seeing, feeling, or registering anything around me. I was too caught up in my own misery to even notice the sudden bank of black clouds that started rolling in from the north.\n \"Life sucks,\" I said as I opened the door to my office. Finn and Clare, back from wherever it is they\u0027d gone off to, looked up from her computer, questions evident in their expressions. At my desk, Paen sat, making notes on a notepad. I noticed he was left-handed, as I was. It warmed my heart for a moment before I remembered that as far as he was concerned, my heart could take a flying leap.\n \"You look horrible,\" Clare said, getting up to take my coat and hang it properly on the coat-tree. \"Did Brother Jacob not have anything helpful to say about the statue?\"\n \"What statue?\" I asked, pulling the shoebox out of my purse and handing it to her.\n She opened it. \"I don\u0027t understand. Where is the statue?\"\n Grief built up inside me until I thought I\u0027d break down into a good, old-fashioned elf-dirge. I\u0027d lost Paen, lost the statue, and I wasn\u0027t the tiniest bit closer to finding either the Jilin God or the Coda. A big old pity party welled up inside me and whined to be set free. \"The statue was stolen from me sometime while I was held prisoner.\"\n It took only a few minutes to tell my startled audience the events of the last two hours, ending up with a brief rant against everything that had gone wrong of late. \"I can\u0027t believe this,\" I said, storming around the office, waving my hands in the best drama queen fashion. \"I\u0027m known for my ability to find things. It\u0027s what I do best! Nothing has ever stayed lost once I\u0027ve tried to find it, and yet here I am, employed to find two simple items, and I\u0027m no closer now to finding their whereabouts than I was when I was hired, not to mention losing a third item I wanted to keep!\"\n Clare popped a lilac blossom in her mouth, her eyes huge as she watched me emote.\n \"I think you\u0027re allowing things to get to you,\" Paen offered, getting to his feet. He tucked his notebook away into his jacket pocket.\n I pointed a finger at him. \"You\u0027re a big part of the problem, buster.\"\n He raised his eyebrows. \"I fail to see how our personal situation - \"\n \"I\u0027m not talking about your commitment issues - I\u0027m referring to the fact that you didn\u0027t tell me everything you knew about the Jilin statue. You willfully withheld information about it, information that might have helped me if I had known it two days ago.\" That wasn\u0027t strictly fair, but I was grasping at straws.\n \"What information?\" Finn asked, frowning at his brother.\n Paen frowned back at him for a moment before turning to me. \"I told you everything I knew about the statue.\"\n I marched over to stand in front of him, my hand on my hip. \"Oh you did, huh? You didn\u0027t mention that the statue represents the origins of immortal races, and that it supposedly contains some big secret of how they were created. You didn\u0027t tell me that it was priceless, worth so much that someone would offer me fifty thousand pounds just to find it for him.\"\n \"Fifty thousand - \" Paen grabbed the finger I was using to punctuate my sentences by poking it into his chest. I squelched the little tremor of pleasure that zipped through me at his touch. \"Who offered you money to find my statue?\"\n \"The mage expert I consulted earlier. It turns out he is also looking for the Jilin God, only he was a bit more forthcoming with information about it.\" I let Paen see the full extent of my discontent.\n He glared right back at me. \"I had no idea it represented the origin of immortal races any more than I knew it was priceless. I\u0027ve done extensive research into the origin of the Moravians and never heard of it, so perhaps the information from your source is questionable. Who is this mage expert?\"\n \"Possibly it\u0027s questionable, but it sounded like the truth. It would explain why a demon lord would want it - if it held secrets of the immortals, surely that would give a demon lord power over the various races?\"\n \"It is within the realm of possibility, but just barely,\" Paen said, releasing my hand. \"The expert\u0027s name?\"\n \"Hmm? Oh. Caspar Green.\"\n I thought Paen\u0027s eyeballs were going to pop out of his head.\n \"Who?\" he roared.\n \"Caspar Green. Why are you so upset?\"\n \"That\u0027s not a man, that\u0027s a demon,\" Paen snarled, slamming his fist into the wall. I flinched at both the hole he left and the red welts that appeared on his hand. \"He\u0027s the one who is demanding I repay my father\u0027s debt.\"\n It was my turn to do the eyeball pop. \"You\u0027re kidding. Caspar is the one doing this? We\u0027re going to have to have another talk with him.\"\n \"Right now,\" Paen said, snatching up his coat and heading for the door.\n All four of us trooped out and descended upon Caspar. Or tried to, at least. He didn\u0027t answer his door buzzer or the phone, and when Paen, driven by fury, scaled the outside of the building and deliberately broke into the apartment, he came up empty-handed.\n \"He\u0027s gone to earth,\" Paen growled a few minutes later, as I dabbed at the cuts on his hand made by the broken glass. \"Search the flat. We may find something that says where he is, or what he\u0027s up to playing us against each other like this.\"\n We found nothing. The flat was almost sterile in its pristine state, as if it were there for show and not really lived in.\n \"So what do we do now?\" Clare asked when we returned disheartened to the office. She munched lilac blossoms like they were popcorn. \"Just wait around for Caspar and Mr. Race to return? Do we have time for that? What if Mr. Race doesn\u0027t know anything about the statue? What if the demon who talked to Paen was wrong? What if Caspar won\u0027t cooperate?\"\n \"Race is the only lead we have,\" Finn said.\n \"Yes, and we can\u0027t talk to him if we can\u0027t find him. Evidently he\u0027s en route, and no, he doesn\u0027t have a cell phone. I asked his housekeeper. So we\u0027re playing the waiting game for both him and Caspar.\"\n \"But we should be doing something!\" Clare wailed, waving her hands around.\n Paen jumped up from a chair and marched over to the window, staring out it with an expression of extreme frustration, anger, and a tinge of hopelessness that just about broke my heart.\n I slumped into the chair that he vacated, the faint warmth left behind by his body sinking into mine until it made my soul want to weep. Life suddenly seemed so overwhelming, so bloody impossible. I had tried everything I knew how to do, and yet repeatedly failed. \"This is beyond frustrating. Why can\u0027t I find that damned statue and manuscript? I\u0027ve never not found anything I\u0027ve looked for before, so why am I now having absolutely no luck? What is Caspar up to? Why is Race suddenly incommunicado when we need to talk to him? I tell you, it\u0027s enough to make an elf-girl cry.\"\n \"Poor sweet Sam,\" Clare said, gliding over to me. \"Maybe you\u0027ve lost your power?\"\n \"Huh?\"\n Clare nudged the phone over so she could perch elegantly on the edge of my desk. \"Because you... you know.\" She nodded to where Paen was standing at the window, careful to avoid direct light. \"Maybe that caused you to lose your powers.\"\n I pulled out a small mirror from my desk and checked. \"Nope. Still half elf. And we were in the beyond today. I wouldn\u0027t have been able to do that if I\u0027d lost my elfly powers.\"\n \"You went to the beyond?\" she asked, slanting another glance at Paen. \"Together?\"\n \"Yes, not that it has any relevance to my sudden inability to find things,\" I said glumly, resting my forehead on the desk.\n \"But you lost that bird statue, too. That\u0027s incredibly careless and irresponsible.\"\n I raised my head to glare at her.\n \"Which is not like you at all,\" she added quickly. \"Perhaps someone has cast a spell or cursed you?\"\n \"We\u0027d see a curse, and surely Sam would be able to tell if someone cast a spell on her? Elves are notoriously hard to enchant,\" Finn said, taking his place next to Clare, and giving her shoulder a supportive squeeze.\n As if her shoulder needed the reassurance that it was cherished... I dropped my forehead to the desk again. \"I\u0027m not cursed, and not enchanted. I\u0027m just suddenly... ineffective. But that\u0027s going to change.\"\n \"You have another plan,\" Clare said, clapping her hands with delight. \"I knew you\u0027d come up with something, Sam. It\u0027s best not to put too much reliance on what a demon says. What are you going to do?\"\n \"Desperate times call for desperate measures,\" I told the desk.\n \"I told you she wouldn\u0027t give up,\" Clare said to Finn. He started to protest that he never doubted me, but I held up a hand to stop him.\n \"I don\u0027t trust that demon who spoke to Paen,\" I said thoughtfully. \"Not Caspar, the other one.\"\n He half turned toward me. \"Is there any particular reason why, or do you just have a general distrust of demons?\"\n \"The latter.\" I pushed Clare\u0027s hip off the desk and replaced the phone where I wanted it. \"It\u0027s too pat, too convenient. It smacks too much of trying to divide and conquer.\"\n Everyone looked at me.\n \"Don\u0027t you see?\" I asked, waving my hands around in a vague gesture intended to convey coherence. \"The demon wants to confuse us, throw us off the track by sending us on a wild-goose chase. And who does it want us to chase? Our other client. No, it just seems too coincidental.\"\n \"She has a point,\" Clare said. Finn nodded. Paen frowned.\n I took a deep breath. \"Since I can\u0027t seem to locate either object we were hired to find - nor hang on to a simple bird statue - I\u0027ve decided that I\u0027m going to engage the services of someone who can.\"\n \"Who is that?\" Clare asked, blinking. \"Brother Jacob?\"\n I shook my head.\n \"Another Diviner?\" Finn asked.\n I shook my head again, avoiding looking at the silent man whose presence behind me registered on every molecule in my body. \"No. I\u0027m going to have to bring in some big help. I\u0027m going to consult a seer.\"\n I thought for a moment that Clare was going to choke. \"You\u0027re... you\u0027re... no, you can\u0027t! Finn, tell her she can\u0027t! Seers are bad!\"\n \"They\u0027re not bad, they\u0027re just a bit... pricey. And Finn has nothing to do with the matter, so don\u0027t try to drag him into it,\" I said. \"We were hired to do a job, Clare, and we\u0027re going to do it by one means or another.\"\n \"But... a seer, Sam? That\u0027s even worse than a Guardian or a theurgist!\" Clare, distraught, ran for her flower vase.\n \"I accepted the job. I don\u0027t have a choice in the matter.\"\n \"Paen?\" Clare turned to him. \"Don\u0027t you have something to say about Sam\u0027s plan to use a seer?\"\n \"No,\" he answered, crossing his arms over his chest as he leaned against the wall. His eyes, normally so bright, were dulled like tarnished silver plate. \"But only because the idea is so ridiculous it doesn\u0027t merit an answer.\"\n \"Ridiculous!\" I gasped, sitting up straight.\n \"That\u0027s what I said. Anyone who deludes themselves into believing that they can consult a seer without paying an unthinkable price deserves the label of ridiculous.\" My gasp changed into an outraged huff. \"You are not going to turn this over to a seer,\" he added, walking around the client\u0027s chair in front of my desk where his coat and hat lay. \"I want to find this statue more than anyone, but not at the cost of others\u0027 lives. You\u0027re hungry and exhausted. You need food. I believe we can spare an hour to feed you and Clare while we discuss the next step.\"\n \"Correction - you can talk about it all you like over dinner, dessert, and the swivel hips of a troop of dancing girls. I, however, have work to do, and I intend to do it before the night ages any more.\"\n \"Sam!\" Clare looked scandalized.\n I sighed. She was right. Just because Paen had all but ripped my heart out and stomped it into nothing but a smear on the ground didn\u0027t mean I had to be rude. He was a client. A professional, rather than personal, demeanor was clearly called for. Henceforth, I would be the personification of investigative professionalism.\n \"My apologies, gentlemen. I didn\u0027t mean to sound so brusque. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll all have a lovely dinner, but I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to be a bit busy.\"\n Sam, why are you doing this?\n I glanced at Paen. \"If you have something to say to me, please say it out loud. The mental broadcasting station has been closed due to FCC conflicts.\"\n \"You\u0027re not going to use a seer. I forbid it.\"\n I gathered up my coat and purse. \"You\u0027re my client, Paen, not my father.\" I was unable to keep from sliding him a hurt look. \"Or my lover anymore, for that matter. Therefore, I\u0027ll do as I please. I\u0027ll see you all later. Enjoy dinner.\"\n Paen blocked the way to the door. \"Very well, since you insist on playing this game - if you will not respect my wishes with regards to the seer, I will fire you.\"\n \"Really?\" I stopped directly in front of him, my body demanding I keep walking until it was pressed up against all those lovely hard lines of his. \"You\u0027re willing to give up your mother\u0027s soul over this?\"\n He hesitated for a moment. \"I don\u0027t believe that a seer is the solution. If I had, I would have consulted one myself. Seers are not always what they seem, and seldom give the help you need.\"\n \"Yes, well, the bottom line is that I said I\u0027d find that statue in the amount of time you have left, and I intend to do just that. Now please step out of the way and allow me to do my job.\"\n His jaw tightened. \"I\u0027m removing you from the case.\"\n \"Too late. I\u0027ve accepted the retainer. I\u0027m going to find the statue,\" I said, trying to step around him. He grabbed for my arm. I backed up until I was out of reach.\n \"Sam, you can\u0027t do this,\" Clare said, closing in on me from the other side. Her face was puckered with worry, the remains of a flower clutched in her hand.\n \"I can\u0027t? Watch me,\" I said calmly, determination seeping from all the gaping holes Paen had left in my soul.\n \"There\u0027s no way out of here,\" Finn said, moving so he stood next to Paen. \"We\u0027re not going to let you endanger yourself with a seer, Sam. Come to dinner and we\u0027ll talk about it.\"\n I smiled, just smiled at Clare and Finn. Paen I couldn\u0027t look at without wanting to scream, sob, and rip all his clothes off in order to have my wicked way with him. Instead of any of those, I reached out and found the opening to the beyond, slipping through it before anyone realized what I was doing.\n I heard an echo of my name, but it was distant and tinny, as if spoken from a long way away. I had to pass through Paen to get to the door, an act that almost brought me to tears with the pain of rejection. For one brief moment, time held its breath as my soul merged with his. Like the other times we\u0027d merged, it was so right, so perfect I didn\u0027t want to leave. For a moment, I allowed my love to shine bright. Paen reeled in surprise. With a cry of anguish that ripped from my throat, I tore myself away from him and left the office, waiting until I was at the edge of the founded area to slip back to reality.\n Paen tried a few times to mind-speak to me, but I barely had the strength to walk away from him - there was no way I could argue my feelings with him. After our last merging, he\u0027d be well aware of the depths of my emotions, and I knew he wasn\u0027t happy about them. In a move of sheerest self-preservation, I put up a mental do not disturb sign, and blocked his mind from mine.\n It took a good half hour of solid persuasion to get the name and phone number of an area seer from Jake, but after I told him I would rather sacrifice my own soul than lose Paen\u0027s mother\u0027s, he caved and gave it to me.\n \"Just remember that a seer\u0027s services come at an exorbitantly high price,\" he advised as he wrote out a name and phone number. \"She\u0027ll ask you for something very precious indeed. I hope you\u0027re prepared to lose something that matters to you.\"\n \"I\u0027m immortal now,\" I said, pocketing the slip of paper. \"I can afford to lose a few years of my life.\"\n \"Just because the seer that Brother Bartholomew used demanded seven years of his life does not guarantee that\u0027s what this seer will ask of you,\" he warned, concern filling his eyes.\n I gave his hand a squeeze and kissed his cheek. \"Thanks for everything, Jake - both the name and the worry. But you can relax. I\u0027m not suicidal, nor overly stupid. I\u0027ll only barter something that I can do without.\"\n He shook his head as I left. \"That\u0027s not how it works, Sam. Just remember that whatever the price she asks, it\u0027s bound to be too high. Try to get it down to something that won\u0027t deprive you too much.\"\n I thanked him again and walked to the corner where there was a pay phone. Three minutes later I was running to a taxi stand, having managed to get an appointment with Kelsey Franklin, local seer. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-vampires-get-the-blues-dark-ones-4/page-14.html","bookId":2205,"book":{"id":2205,"title":"Even Vampires Get the Blues (Dark Ones #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Even Vampires Get the Blues (Dark Ones #4) \n Paen Scott is a Dark One: a vampire without a soul.
