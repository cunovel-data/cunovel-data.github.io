{"id":101768,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"What do you think of the sign?\" Clare set down a box of desk supplies and a bouquet of fresh cut flowers, and frowned. \"Well, to be honest, Sam, I wasn\u0027t going to say anything about it, but I don\u0027t think the crow landing on your head this morning is a good omen. It means your life is about to go crisis central. But I\u0027m here to help, and you know I\u0027ll do what I can to keep you from going outright insane.\" \"No... I meant the sign on the door.\" I nodded to where a local sign painter was putting away her stencils and paints. \"Oh. Mmm.\" Clare tipped her head and considered the freshly painted words on the upper half of the open office door, \"EYE SCRY, SAMANTHA COSSE AND CLARE BENNET, DISCREET PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS. It\u0027s nice, but I Still think it\u0027s a bit too strange. People are going to think we\u0027re not normal private investigators.\" \"We aren\u0027t normal, Clare.\" \"Speak for yourself. I\u0027m as normal as they come.\" She plucked a tulip from the bouquet and went to the window, using her elbow to wipe a small clean patch on the grimy glass. \"Isn\u0027t it a lovely morning?\" I glanced out the window at the grey, sodden-looking sky, and shrugged as I arranged paper in my new printer/copier/fax machine. \"It\u0027s a typical Scottish May: grey, cold, and wet.\" \"When I woke up this morning,\" Clare said dreamily, unconsciously striking an elegant pose that made her a star on the fashion runways, \"the dew had kissed all the sweet little flowers just as if faeries had danced upon them with damp little slippers. Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s lovely? I thought that up all by myself.\" \"Very, um...\" Clare blinked silver-tipped lashes at me. I relented under her hopeful expression. \"Very poetic. But not terribly accurate, is it?\" She blinked again, her large blue eyes clouded with confusion. \"What do you mean?\" \"Well... just look at you.\" I waved a hand toward her torso. \"You\u0027re the opposite of short, sturdy, dark-haired me - you\u0027re tall, lovely, elegant, and have that silver blond hair that everyone seems to rave about, but you\u0027re hardly in a dancing-on-the-dew-kissed-flowers sort of form, are you? You\u0027d squash the little buggers flat were you to try it in your human form.\" She rolled her expressive eyes and bopped me on the arm with her tulip. Clare always had flowers with her - she couldn\u0027t help it any more than my mother could. It was just part of their genetic makeup. \"You\u0027re going to start that silly business again, and I won\u0027t listen to it, I simply won\u0027t listen to it.\" I took her by both arms and shook her gently. \"You\u0027re a faery, Clare. It\u0027s time you face up to that fact. You\u0027re a faery, your real name is Glimmerharp, and you were left with my aunt and uncle because your faery parents wanted you to have a better life than running around in wet shoes, stamping dew onto flowers. I doubt if they would have done so had they known that your idea of a better life is to parade up and down in scanty lingerie in front of strangers with cameras, but that\u0027s neither here nor there. You are a faery, and the sooner you admit that, the happier everyone around you will be.\" \"I am not a faery; I am an underwear model.\" \"You\u0027re both.\" \"Oh!\" She plucked a piece of the smooth red tulip\u0027s flower and popped it in her mouth. \"You take that back!\" \"I won\u0027t,\" I said calmly, releasing her to hook the printer up to the laptop that sat on the scarred and battered oak desk I\u0027d claimed as my own. \"It\u0027s the truth, and you know it, even if you are in denial.\" \"You\u0027re a fine one to talk about denial!\" she said, marching over to her desk, a trail of tulip petals gently drifting to the floor behind her. \"You deny your heritage every chance you get.\" I laughed. I couldn\u0027t help it - the mere thought of me being able to ignore who I was, was beyond ridiculous. \"There\u0027s no way I could deny my parentage - not after growing up the only kid in my neighborhood whose mother is a bona fida poetry-spouting, pointy-eared, gonna-live-forever elf. Years of Keebler jokes made sure I knew just how different I was, and we won\u0027t even go into what a mention of Lord of the Rings does to me. What I\u0027ve never understood is how you can accept the fact that my mother is an elf, and yet insist that there are no such things as faeries.\" \"I refuse to talk to you when you get in that mood,\" Clare said, and picked up an empty milk jug she\u0027d brought to serve as a vase. \"I won\u0027t let you ruin the excitement of the day with all that nonsense.\" \"Excitement?\" I looked around the small office as Clare left to fill the vase with water. The painter had toddled off, leaving the faint odor of acrylic paints behind her. Through the open door I could see a dark, dingy hallway that led to a couple of flats and a shared bathroom. \"That\u0027s not quite the word that comes to mind,\" I said loud enough that Clare could hear me down the hall. \"But never fear! A little elbow grease and some creative decorating courtesy of that thrift store you saw on the way in should do much to wipe out the years of neglect. I just wish Mila would come and get her boxes of sex toys.\" Clare\u0027s muffled voice drifted into the room as I crawled under the desk to plug in the computer equipment. \"You shouldn\u0027t have told her she could keep her stock here.\" \"I had a hard enough time persuading her to rent this office to me - ow!\" I rubbed the back of my head where I cracked it on the underside of the desk. \"Evidently her sex store is doing a tremendous amount of business and she needs all the storage space she can get. Besides, she knocked a hundred pounds off the rent just for us putting up with a few extra boxes.\" Clare\u0027s answer was drowned out by the sound of running water. I scooted backward under the desk, dragging with me the phone cord to plug in the new set of phones I\u0027d purchased. \"Regardless of the naughty toys, I don\u0027t know how exciting this job is going to be to someone who spends time in Milan and Paris and Berlin being paid thousands of pounds to stand around and pout in her panties.\" \"It\u0027s not nearly as exciting as you might think,\" Clare said, coming back into the room. \"That\u0027s why I decided to go on hiatus for a year. My modeling batteries need to be recharged, and this job should do wonders for that.\" \"Eh... OK.\" I plugged the cord into the appropriate wall socket, and jumped violently when the phone above me rang loudly, causing me to whack my head on the desk a second time. \"Phone,\" Clare said helpfully. \"Oh, thank you. I might have thought it was my umbrella ringing, otherwise.\" I hunkered down under the desk rubbing my abused head. \"I\u0027ll get it,\" Clare said, hurrying over to her desk. \"Your umbrella is ringing. Honestly, Sam! Your imagination! Good morning, Eye Scry, discreet private enquiries, this is Clare. How can I help?\" I crawled out from under my desk, wondering as I brushed off the dusty knees of my pants who was calling us. I\u0027d only set up the phone lines the day before, and had given the number out to just one person other than Clare. It was probably just the phone company checking to see if the line worked. I turned on my laptop and sat down at my desk while Clare made little murmurs of encouragement to whoever was on the phone. \"I see. Well, I don\u0027t believe that will be a problem, Mr. Race. My partner has a particular talent with finding lost objects. Oh, you did?\" Clare looked at me, her eyes round. \"Then perhaps it would be best if you talked to her yourself. Can you hold? Thank you.\" \"Lost items?\" I asked. \"That\u0027s not a client, is it?\" \"Yes, it is. It\u0027s a Mr. Owen Race. He\u0027s a medieval specialist of some sort, and he wants us to find some sort of an antique book for him. But Sam - he says that Brother Jacob recommended you to him. I thought you were kicked out of the Order of Diviners?\" \"I was, but Jake said he\u0027d keep an ear out for me for anyone who might be able to use the services of a failed Diviner. Sounds like he found someone. Hello, this is Samantha Cosse. I understand you need some help locating an object?\" Like Clare\u0027s, the man\u0027s voice was English, very upper-class, positively reeking of places like Eton and Cambridge and of the BBC. It made me all the more aware of my flat, accentless (to my ears) Canadian speech. \"Good morning, Miss Cosse. Yes, as I told your associate, I am seeking to locate a very rare medieval manuscript that was stolen from me recently - the Simia Gestor Coda is its name. I understand from Brother Jacob at the Diviners\u0027 House that you studied there for several years and have a good deal of experience in locating missing items?\" Oh dear. He wanted a Diviner, and I was anything but one. I\u0027d have to let him know right away that I wasn\u0027t what he thought I was. \"I\u0027ve had some luck locating missing items, yes. But if you are seeking the assistance of a true Diviner, Mr. Race, I\u0027m afraid you may have been misled. I did study at the Diviners\u0027 House with the Order, but I was... well, to put it bluntly, I was kicked out before my novitiate was completed. Although I have been trained in elementary divination, I\u0027m afraid I am unable to conduct the more advanced rituals.\" \"I see. I appreciate such frankness, and can assure you that I have no need for the services of a professional Diviner. Brother Jacob recommended you to me because you apparently have a talent for locating items that goes beyond mere divination.\" I slumped back in my chair in relief. I hadn\u0027t anticipated Jake sending me a customer, despite his declarations that he would do all he could to help me, but now that I had bared the ugly truth in my past, I could focus on the job being offered. \"I will be happy to put the full resources of my firm at your disposal,\" I said. \"Perhaps we can meet to discuss this further?\" \"Excellent. I\u0027m in Barcelona at the moment, but I would be happy to pay your airfare out here.\" I blinked back my surprise. \"Er... I appreciate the offer, Mr. Race, but we are still in the process of setting up our business, and I wouldn\u0027t be comfortable leaving all the remaining work to my partner.\" I motioned to Clare and wrote he wants me to go to Barcelona on the notepad. Clare looked panicky. I\u0027d had to promise her, when we thought up the idea of the investigation agency, that I would handle all of what she termed the \"messy businessy stuff.\" \"Sam, no,\" she whispered. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" I mouthed, then said into the phone, \"That\u0027s very generous of you, but I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s out of the question. However - \" I raised my eyebrows in question. Clare nodded quickly. \"However, my partner would be available to fly to Barcelona. She would be very happy to stand in my place and discuss with you all the necessary details.\" \"Erm... no, that won\u0027t be necessary,\" he said, sounding disappointed. I shook my head at Clare. \"I will be returning to Edinburgh at the end of the week, so we can meet then.\" \"I would be happy to get started on your project if you can give me the details over the phone,\" I said in my most professional voice, opening a text document. \"Why don\u0027t you give me the specifics of the item that was stolen, and later you can fax me any insurance documents you have, as well as the police report.\" Twenty minutes later I hung up the phone and hit SAVE on my document file. \"Well?\" Clare asked, absently nibbling on a carnation. \"Do we have a job?\" I smiled. \"We are employed! Let fly the doves and all that.\" \"Hurrah! I told you this was going to be exciting! Although I\u0027m disappointed I won\u0027t be going to Barcelona. Such a pretty city. So, we\u0027re looking for a book?\" \"Yes, some sort of medieval manuscript that was stolen. Evidently Mr. Race has quite a collection, and he didn\u0027t notice the theft until he had ordered an inventory of his holdings a month ago. He\u0027s going to have his housekeeper round up some information about the manuscript, but until then, we can get to work on the little info he gave me. He believes the manuscript could well have been taken by a rival collector.\" \"Oooh. How thrilling! It\u0027s like an art theft, only with a medieval book.\" \"Mmm,\" I said, gathering up my bag and jacket. \"I\u0027m going to go visit a couple of antique shops and see if I can\u0027t get some info on who the big collectors are in Britain.\" \"What would you like me to do?\" Clare asked, chewing another bit of flower. \"You\u0027d better stop eating those flowers, or you won\u0027t have anything left but a vase full of stems,\" I said at the door. She shot me a look of pure outrage. \"I do not eat flowers!\" I raised my eyebrows and looked at the half-eaten carnation in her hand. She glared at it for a minute as if it had magically appeared there. \"You\u0027re a faery, Clare. No one else eats flowers but really hard-core vegetarians, and I\u0027ve seen you wolf down a steak, so I know you\u0027re not that. If you want to do something helpful, do an Internet search for me on the\" - I consulted my notes - \"Simia Gestor Coda. With a name like that, it has to have some sort of a history. I\u0027d like to know everything you can find out about its past. All Mr. Race told me was that it was written by a mage who was supposedly in Marco Polo\u0027s service. Oh, also, pull up a list of the major antiquities dealers for England. It wouldn\u0027t hurt to know who might be dealing in something like a rare antique manuscript.\" I spent the next couple of hours visiting various antique shops in and around the Royal Mile, the most famous street in all of Edinburgh. By the time I tottered into the last shop on my list, a small, dusty shop tucked away between a bookstore and a gyro shop, I was feeling uninspired. The antique dealers were particularly loath to talk about their clients, and none of them had heard of the Coda. A little bell over the door jangled as I entered the shop. Like others of its ilk, this antiquities shop was filled to the rafters with statuary, objets d\u0027art, stuffed animals, strange old mechanical pieces, books and illuminated manuscripts, and a myriad of other items whose use and purpose were shrouded in the distant reaches of the past. I browsed through the items, glancing periodically at a man I took to be the owner as he stood with his back to me in the doorway to another room, speaking to someone I couldn\u0027t see. \"Shoot,\" I said to myself as I glanced at my watch. I was three hours away from the office already, and I wanted to get back to help Clare. I stopped in front of a bookcase bearing a stuffed spider monkey, and sent yet another impatient look toward the man in the doorway. \"I don\u0027t have time for thiaaaaieeeeeee!\" My heart just about leaped out of my chest as the spider monkey I\u0027d assumed was stuffed suddenly jumped from the bookcase to my shoulder. \"Oh, man alive, you just scared a good ten years off me. Hello there, Mr. Monkey. Um... that is, I assume you\u0027re a mister. I can\u0027t tell, what with that little sailor suit you\u0027re wearing. Do you belong here? Of course you do, what a stupid question. What else would a monkey be doing in an antiques shop? Would you mind asking your owner if he could talk to me for a few minutes? No? Drat. Well, doesn\u0027t matter - you\u0027ll do as an excuse to interrupt him.\" The monkey, evidently satisfied with his evil plan to give me a heart attack, leaped back onto the bookcase, where he smoothed down the fur on his tail. \"Um... I can\u0027t use you as an excuse unless you\u0027re on my shoulder, so hop on... er... what\u0027s your name?\" I reached out a tentative hand to stroke his arm. He didn\u0027t seem to mind being petted, so I gently touched the jeweled collar he wore around his neck. Tiny rivets spelled out a series of letters. \"B... E... P... well, hello there, Beppo.\" The monkey stopped examining his tail and held out a rust-fingered hand. Stifling a giggle at the dignified look on his little face, I carefully shook his hand. Satisfied, he returned to his grooming. \"You are one strange little monkey. All right, Beppo, hop on and let\u0027s go interrupt your owner.\" He dropped his tail and held out his hand again. \"Hee!\" I shook his hand again. That completed, he picked up his tail. \"Beppo,\" I said again, unable to resist. Down went the tail; out went his hand. \"OK, cute but could well become annoying. Here, if you don\u0027t mind - \" I hoisted the monkey off the bookcase and set him onto my shoulder. His tail wrapped around my neck as he clung with one hand to my ponytail. \"Groovy. Now let\u0027s go pretend that I just found you in a dangerous situation and see if I can\u0027t have a quick word with your owner before toddling on my merry - holy crap! What is it with everyone trying to startle me into an early grave?\" A being popped up in front of me. I mean, literally popped up right out of the floor. All my supernatural senses went into high tingle mode at the sight of what appeared to be a short, middle-aged man. Only he wasn\u0027t a man. I didn\u0027t know exactly what he was, but he wasn\u0027t human. \"Hello,\" I said politely, feeling it was better to give him the benefit of the doubt. I\u0027d come across a few different types of beings in my time with the Diviners, and although only a couple of them had turned out to be from the wrong side of the tracks, metaphorically speaking, some who looked bad had turned out to be quite nice. \"That was an impressive entrance. Was it for me in particular, or are you just a fan of antiques?\" The man looked from Beppo to me. \"You bear the monkey.\" \"Beppo?\" The monkey promptly held out his hand. I gave it a little two-fingered shake. \"He jumped on me earlier, but I was just taking him back to his - what\u0027s this?\" The man shoved a shoebox-sized package at me. \"I am charged to give it to you. It is yours now,\" the man said, then without another word, dissolved into black smoke that sank down into the floor.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-vampires-get-the-blues-dark-ones-4/page-2.html","bookId":2205,"book":{"id":2205,"title":"Even Vampires Get the Blues (Dark Ones #4)","description":"Storyline: Even Vampires Get the Blues (Dark Ones #4) Paen Scott is a Dark One: a vampire without a soul.
