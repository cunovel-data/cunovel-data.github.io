{"id":101776,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve ever run across a butterfly I\u0027d classify as murderous,\" Paen commented a few minutes later. He stood in the shadow of an overhang of a maintenance building, clad in the same ankle-length black coat and hat that he\u0027d worn to my office.\n \"Yeah, well, you didn\u0027t hear those little monsters chanting about drinking you.\" I stopped brushing off the butterfly dust - which Jake helpfully informed me was actually miniscule scales off the butterflies\u0027 wings - and scrunched my nose. \"Why was I emitting light? I\u0027ve never done that before.\"\n \"You\u0027ve never channeled power from the sun before, either,\" Jake said, watching Paen with bright, interested eyes. \"You probably pulled more than you needed, and it had to go somewhere.\"\n I patted my torso, still a bit weirded out by the experience. Unlike Clare, I was not immortal, nor did I recover quickly from wounds. The fact that sunlight could burst out of me without doing damage relieved my mind on one level, and disturbed me greatly on another. I\u0027d have to worry about it at another time, though. Right now I had more important concerns. \"Whatever the reason, I\u0027m glad it\u0027s done. I\u0027m just sorry I couldn\u0027t pinpoint the location of the statue.\"\n \"You have no idea where it is?\" Paen asked.\n \"Somewhere fairly close, that\u0027s the only sense of location I got.\"\n \"Close meaning Edinburgh? Scotland? The planet Earth?\"\n \"Very funny,\" I said, walking toward the parking lot. I stopped and looked back at Paen, still standing in the shadows. \"Mind giving us a lift back to town?\"\n He angled his hat so it shaded his face, stuffed his hands in his pockets, and strode past me into the sunlight. Jake and I followed, hurrying to keep up with Paen\u0027s long-legged stride.\n \"The answer to your question is this area. I think. Lowlands of Scotland. Somewhere around here, there\u0027s a tomb holding that statue. Any obvious spots you\u0027d like to search first?\"\n \"No,\" Paen said, turning his back to the sun so he could open the car door. I noticed for the first time that the windows of the car were heavily tinted. From the inside, they appeared normal, but anyone standing outside it saw windows almost as dark as my scrying mirror. \"But I have information that may make such a search moot.\"\n \"Really? What sort of information?\" I asked as I got into the car, claiming the front seat while Jake took the rear. I scooted around on the seat so I had my back to the door, able to see both men. \"What did you find out?\"\n Paen\u0027s gaze flickered to the rearview mirror for a moment.\n He\u0027s absolutely trustworthy, you know. You can say anything you want in front of him. He won\u0027t repeat it.\n I could feel Paen hesitate, unwilling to share information in front of a stranger.\n I know it\u0027s asking a lot, but I trust him with my life. You really don\u0027t have to worry about anything you say in front of him getting spread around.\n \"There was a demon waiting for me outside your flat when I left this morning,\" he said finally, evidently deciding to trust us both.\n Jake\u0027s eyes widened.\n \"It\u0027s not like it sounds,\" I said hastily, giving Paen a small frown. \"We didn\u0027t have sex.\"\n \"We didn\u0027t?\" Paen asked.\n \"No, we didn\u0027t!\"\n \"We were both naked,\" he pointed out. \"And you begged me to make love to your ears.\"\n Jake\u0027s eyes practically bugged out.\n \"Paen\u0027s blowing this totally out of proportion,\" I told him, waving a hand at my would-be lover. \"The ear sex thing was unexpected. And just so you know, all he did was bite my ears. There were no ear-to-genital encounters. That\u0027s just creepy.\"\n \"I think this is probably none of my business,\" Jake said, looking oddly delighted. He kept shooting little questioning looks at Paen, then grinning at me.\n I frowned in return. \"True, so if Mr. Blabberfangs there doesn\u0027t mind, we can move on past the fact that we were naked and indulging in a little ear make-out session, and get to the point.\" Unbidden, my gaze dropped to Paen\u0027s lap. \"Er... point of the conversation. You saw a demon?\"\n \"Yes. On the street. It was waiting for me. It said it had been sent by its master, the demon lord who demanded the statue. The demon said that there was a man in Edinburgh, a theurgist who has an interest in art from the Dark Ages. This man evidently has information about the statue, and possibly knows where it is located.\"\n \"Oooh, good clue, even if it does come from a demon,\" I said, pulling out my PDA to take notes. \"What\u0027s the name of the guy?\"\n \"Owen Race. Professor Owen Race.\"\n I almost dropped my PDA. \"Huh?\"\n Paen didn\u0027t seem to notice for a second or two that Jake and I stared at him with mouths hanging open in surprise. \"What? Do you know him?\"\n \"Kind of,\" I said, choking slightly. \"He\u0027s a client. Jake referred him to me.\"\n \"Client!\" Paen looked as surprised as I felt. \"What did he hire you for?\"\n I bit my lip (a bad habit, but one I am unable to stop). \"I can\u0027t tell you. That would be violating my ethics. It\u0027s not to find your statue, though, I\u0027ll tell you that.\"\n \"I appreciate that you wish to adhere to client confidentiality, but I must insist on knowing what work Owen Race has engaged you to undertake.\"\n \"Insist away. You are a client - I respect your right to privacy. Likewise, I respect Mr. Race\u0027s. I\u0027ll go so far as to assure you that my job for him has nothing to do with your statue, but that\u0027s all I\u0027m saying.\"\n \"That\u0027s not good enough. There may be a connection that you don\u0027t see,\" Paen argued, turning onto a familiar street.\n \"Might I remind you that I\u0027m a professional?\" My frown got a little tighter. \"I\u0027m not a complete idiot, you know. I can tell the difference between a job locating a stolen book and one to find a missing statue.\"\n \"Stolen book? What book was stolen?\"\n I growled to myself.\n \"I think this is where I get off,\" Jake said, evidently sensing the coming argument. He waited until Paen pulled past a zebra crossing and hopped out, poking his head back into the car for a moment. \"Nice meeting you, Paen. Thanks for the entertainment, Sam.\"\n \"Bye, and thank you for all the support,\" I said, upping my frown at Paen to a full-frontal glare. \"I\u0027ll let you know later how things turn out, OK?\"\n \"It\u0027s a deal. Later.\"\n Paen drove off, heading not toward my office as I wanted, but into the newer part of town where our apartment was.\n \"You\u0027re taking me home? I don\u0027t want to go home. I have work to do at the office,\" I said. \"There\u0027s a little business about your mother\u0027s soul, remember?\"\n \"Of course I remember! How could you possibly imagine I\u0027d forget something like that? I am, however, capable of dealing with more than one situation at a time. Since we are going to continue to work closely together, I think it\u0027s appropriate to discuss a few things regarding our personal relationship.\" Paen\u0027s jaw was set as he whipped us around a corner.\n \"Oh. That makes sense. But we can talk at the office.\"\n \"Finn is there with Clare.\"\n \"So? I bet if we tried hard, we could talk with them there anyway.\"\n \"Would you also like to have sex with them there?\"\n My lips formed an O. I was about to protest that I wasn\u0027t interested in having sex with him, but the truth was, the idea was more than a little intriguing. Just the thought of his hot breath on my ears made me shiver. \"Um. No. But it\u0027s the middle of the day, and I have work to do. I hate to waste time.\"\n One of his eyebrows rose. \"I have heard sex referred to as many things, but a waste of time is not one of them.\"\n \"You\u0027re not planning on sexing me up, then trying to worm out secrets about Owen Race, are you?\" I asked, sudden suspicion causing me to narrow my eyes. No wonder he suddenly was interested in doing the sheet tango.\n Paen turned onto my street and headed for the tiny lot behind my building. \"The thought had crossed my mind, yes.\"\n \"Ha! I knew it. Well, it won\u0027t work.\"\n \"That was my conclusion as well. You are too honorable to do such a thing.\"\n I basked for a moment or two in the warm glow of his approval, frowning when I realized that his tone added a different interpretation to the statement. \"So why are we going to my apartment if you know I don\u0027t kiss and tell?\"\n He shot me a look that had every cell in my body clamoring for action. \"I desire you. I believe you desire me. That emotion is impairing my ability to function. I need that ability to continue directing the pursuit of the statue. Therefore, a lovemaking session will do much to clear both our minds. Consider it work therapy.\"\n \"Whoa, wait a second,\" I said as he slipped the car into my parking spot. I put my hand on his arm, holding him in the car when he would have jumped out. \"Your desire for me is impairing your ability to function? What\u0027s that all about?\"\n He frowned. \"Surely you understand the power of desire? You said you feel an attraction to me.\"\n \"Yes, I do. But I don\u0027t have to give in to that attraction.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you?\" he asked, getting out of the car, suddenly flooding my head with the emotions he felt during our previous almost-sex session. Hunger was uppermost in his emotions, but it wasn\u0027t just a hunger for blood - it was a need for something to fill the gaping hole inside him. It was a silent plea for light to fill his darkness, for someone to take away the pain of utter loneliness, the hopelessness that seeped into every corner of his being.\n He needed love.\n He needed me.\n \"OK,\" I said, dropping all objections as I leaped out of the car. We made it to the door of my apartment before I gave in to temptation and flung myself at him, kissing the breath right out of his mouth.\n \"You\u0027re good for someone who hasn\u0027t had a lot of practice,\" he admitted three minutes later, when I retrieved my tongue and broke off the kiss long enough to get the door to the apartment unlocked.\n \"I\u0027m inspired by the subject,\" I told him before racing to the bedroom. I yanked off my jacket en route, simultaneously beating back the shrubberies in my room and hopping on one foot while trying to pull off my shoe. Without thinking, I yanked open the blinds to let the sunshine in, stopping for a moment to soak up the wonderfully warm rays before turning to see what was keeping Paen.\n He was pinned up against the door, his shirt in one hand, the sunshine lapping at his shoes.\n \"Oh. Sorry about that. It\u0027s instinctive,\" I said as I angled the blinds to limit the sun to an area directly in front of the window.\n \"So I gathered,\" he answered, whapping at a narrow-leafed Australian Tree Fern that was infringing on his personal space.\n I got both shoes and socks removed, and peeled off my jeans, standing for a moment with them in my hand, the sun warming my back as I looked at Paen. There was a lot of him to look at, too, what with that glorious bare chest right there for me to ogle. I gave in and had a good ogle, then managed to get my mind back to the question uppermost. \"Foreplay or no?\"\n He stopped mid-unzipping. \"Pardon?\"\n \"Are you going to get naked now? Or just torment me with that chest first, driving me to a frenzy of lust-crazed wantonness that will make me rip the rest of your clothes off?\"\n He looked down at his chest. \"You want to rip my clothes off just by looking at my chest?\"\n \"Very much so.\"\n \"It\u0027s just a chest. Skin and hair.\"\n \"Oh, I beg to differ.\" I tossed aside my jeans and walked over to where he stood in a shady patch, stroking my hand down his chest from his clavicle to his sternum, following the lovely, sleek trail of hair that led straight down his belly and disappeared into his pants. \"This is not just skin and hair. This is no mere chest. It\u0027s chest deluxe. Chest supreme.\"\n He gave me an odd look, a mixture of disbelief and amusement. \"You\u0027re a strange woman.\"\n \"So it\u0027s said. I know a good thing when I see it, however,\" I said, pulling my hand back with an effort. \"So, did you want to dally with a bit of foreplay, or just go straight for the meat-and-potatoes thing?\"\n He dropped his pants. \"What do you think?\"\n \"Whoa! You\u0027ve been anticipating,\" I said, admiring the view as I backed up a few steps. I pulled off my sweater and dropped it onto the chair so I stood in the sunlight clad in nothing but my underwear and bra. \"OK. I\u0027m good with that. Investigating to do, people to see... and evidently, penises to ride. Do you like oral sex?\"\n \"Do you always talk so much during lovemaking?\" he asked, an odd look on his face.\n \"Not normally.\"\n He looked thoughtful for a moment. \"Are you still nervous?\"\n \"Maybe a little. In case you haven\u0027t noticed, I tend to blabber when I\u0027m nervous.\"\n I\u0027ve never met anyone like you before, Paen thought. I don\u0027t think he intended me to hear him, but I grinned anyway as I did a sinuous little dance in the sunshine while slowly removing my bra.\n Good. This\u0027ll be new territory for us both. Kind of puts us on equal footing.\n \"Is equal footing that important to you?\" he asked, taking an aborted step forward, stopping because his toes hit the pool of sunlight that surrounded me.\n \"You hack your way through the foliage and I\u0027ll meet you at the bed,\" I told him, giving in to the energy that flowed through me from the sunlight. I\u0027m not very adept at dancing, or singing for that matter, but put me in the sun and I feel an indescribable rhythm, kind of like those solar-powered, highly annoying desk toys that weave and bob endlessly until you throw them against the wall or dump them in a dark closet.\n \"You\u0027re going to dance now?\" Paen asked, having fought his way through the plants to the bedside. He was watching with interest as I slipped one side of my bra down in a sunny parody of a striptease. \"Not that I mind. You\u0027re very graceful. And I enjoy looking at your breasts. As well as the rest of you.\"\n I did a few slow-motion hip moves as I shimmied out of my bra, turning to slide my hands down my breasts, along my hips, to the lace bits of my underwear. \"I don\u0027t normally do this in front of people, but the sunshine makes it hard for me to stand still.\"\n \"Take your time. I\u0027m enjoying the show.\"\n I smiled coyly over my shoulder at him and skinnied my way out of my undies, tossing them over my head like they were a bridal bouquet.\n \"Do I get to keep them?\" Paen asked when I turned around. He held my underwear in one hand.\n \"If you really want, you can. Or you can keep me, instead,\" I said, slinking my way over to him.\n \"Hmm.\" His thumb rubbed over the satin of the underwear. \"They\u0027re warm, silky, and very feminine.\"\n I smiled as he tossed them aside and pulled me up against his chest. His body was hard and unyielding as I rubbed myself against him, my soft, smooshy parts very different from his solid, flat lines.\n \"But you\u0027re warmer, silkier, and infinitely more feminine. I choose you instead.\"\n \"Sounds good to me. Oh, wait...\"\n I slipped away from him to dig a packet out from under my pillow. \"Now or later?\" I asked, holding it up.\n \"Might as well be now. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be able to stop once I get started,\" he answered.\n I had to remember for a moment how to breathe at the promise that showed in his eyes, but got the condom on him in record time, and flung myself against him to enjoy the tactile experience of his flesh against mine. \"Oooh! Man alive, it\u0027s going to be all over for me if you\u0027re going to do that!\" My legs went boneless as he nipped the top of my ear with his sharp canines.\n \"There\u0027s not a large enough supply of blood for me to drink from this spot,\" he murmured, his tongue licking away the sting.\n I almost came right then and there.\n \"Dear god in heaven, don\u0027t do that!\" I yelled, jumping backward, the backs of my knees hitting the bed so that I went sprawling across it.\n \"Enough earplay?\" he asked, looking down at me.\n My body quivered. All of it, every last single inch of it, quivered and twitched and tingled at the look in his bright eyes, so light they all but burned my flesh. \"I don\u0027t think I can take any more eargasms right now. I really want to experience the regular kind, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\n \"Very well. Perhaps you would prefer this, then,\" he said, kneeling next to the bed, spreading my legs so he was positioned between them.\n \"Oh, man,\" I said on a half gasp as he rubbed his cheeks on my inner thighs. One minute I was me, Sam, a half-elf private detective with a secret addiction to greasy hamburgers, and the next I was a shining orb of rapture, as bright as Paen\u0027s eyes, my whole body attuned to every move his mouth made against me. He nibbled, he touched, he probed, his tongue swirled a tango of delight against sensitive parts that suddenly roared to life with a demand to be taken to heaven and back. Without conscious thought, I opened my mind to Paen and shared it with him, shared the ecstasy and euphoria and glory that was his mouth on my tingling parts. He adjusted his angle of attack, and sent me flying... right out of my body.\n \"Dammit, no! NO! NOT NOW! Aaaaaaaaargh!\" I all but sobbed as my conscious being parted with my body, and started drifting around the bedroom, at the mercy of the dancing motes of light. \"God damn it! DAMN DAMN DAMN!\" Paen, help me!\n The scene below me was arousing, enticing, sexy as hell... and I wasn\u0027t there to experience the joy I knew Paen was bringing to my body.\n Why is this happening? Why isn\u0027t it different with you? Why? I wailed.\n Come back to me, Sam. Share this with me. Feel what I feel.\n Before the words finished rolling around my head I was back in my body, just in time for the glorious Technicolor orgasm that swept over me. I screamed his name as he slid up my body, the pleasure he felt as his teeth sank deep into my breast almost as great as the pleasure he\u0027d just given me.\n Our minds merged, his exhilaration feeding mine until it spiraled into something more profound than anything I\u0027d ever felt, a feeling that doubled, trebled as he moved against me, thrusting hard into me as he released my breast to bite hard on my shoulder. Pain flared bright for a moment, then dissolved into rhapsody, so mind-numblingly overwhelming that I could do nothing more than clutch his back as his body moved against mine, the sensations of him moving hard and deep inside me joining with the sensations he felt as he both gave and took life.\n It was the experience of a lifetime, and one that seared itself onto my soul as he took me to another orgasm, one that triggered his own, the echoes of both rolling around our joined minds, the light from the being we made together filling every corner of darkness within him, bursting out until we were the light.\n That was... dear god, are you still breathing?... that was the most amazing thing I\u0027ve ever felt. It defies description. It was so astounding, I want to dance and sing and cry with the beauty of it. Paen - you\u0027re absolutely amazing. You pulled me back when I had left! Twice! No one has ever done that even once! I think I may faint. Or do a backflip. I can\u0027t decide which.\n Paen lifted his head from where it had been nestled against my neck, his back covered in a sheen of sweat, his dark curls tousled, his eyes fading from brilliant, blinding silver to a rich grey. \"I told you so,\" was all he said, a smile curling his lips.\n I laughed as he kissed me, a kiss so tender it brought tears to my eyes.\n \"Smugness ill becomes you,\" I said as he rolled off me to lie next to me on the bed. He peeled off the condom and tossed it into the elephant-foot trash can before collapsing, exhausted. \"Besides, I know you felt the same thing I did, so don\u0027t be pretending it was just another day at the office. Ow. Are you OK?\"\n Paen looked down at himself as I stroked a hand down his chest. The whole front of his torso, from groin to collarbone, was bright red.\n \"You look like you\u0027re sunburned or something. Does it hurt?\"\n He touched a red spot on his stomach, looked at his hand for a moment, then narrowed his eyes as he reached out and cupped one of my breasts.\n \"Um,\" I said, a little ripple of happiness sweeping through me.\n He pulled his hand back and showed it to me. His palm was beet red. \"It\u0027s you.\"\n \"Me?\" I asked, looking at my breast. \"I\u0027m turning you red?\"\n \"You\u0027re giving me a sunburn. I can feel the sunlight in you when I touch you.\"\n \"Well, how do you like that? I didn\u0027t do this to you before. It must be because I got all charged up in the sun.\" I pressed my hand for a couple of seconds to a non-burned spot on his side. When I removed my hand, a faint pinkish image of my palm remained. \"Whoops. Sorry about that. Does it hurt?\"\n \"No,\" Paen said, lying back, his eyes closed. I could feel him concentrating, focusing his mind. As I watched, the redness washed away on his chest and stomach, as if someone was wiping it off. Only his penis remained startlingly red as it rested against his thigh.\n \"Wow, it even went through the condom. You can heal yourself, too, huh? Not going to do that as well?\" I asked, looking at it.\n It twitched. \"No. Stop looking at it.\"\n \"Why?\" I couldn\u0027t stop myself. It was fascinating how just looking made it start to stiffen up again.\n \"Because I don\u0027t have the energy to make love to you again right now. Not if you want me to be of any other practical use to you today.\"\n I smiled at his penis and gave it a quick pat that I hoped wouldn\u0027t scorch it any further, and rolled onto my side so I was lying close to Paen, but not actually touching. \"That\u0027s OK, I\u0027m still recovering as well. That was the most amazing, most sensual, most... profound experience of my life. I had no idea it was possible to take intimacy past the physical level and into the spiritual. I feel as if I\u0027m seeing you for the first time, Paen. And I\u0027ll always be grateful to you for making my first real time so absolutely, mind-numbingly wondrous. Is sex always like that?\"\n \"No,\" he said abruptly, changing the subject. \"I wish to meet Owen Race. Get dressed and let\u0027s go see him.\"\n I sighed. \"So much for pillow talk, eh?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-vampires-get-the-blues-dark-ones-4/page-10.html","bookId":2205,"book":{"id":2205,"title":"Even Vampires Get the Blues (Dark Ones #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Even Vampires Get the Blues (Dark Ones #4) \n Paen Scott is a Dark One: a vampire without a soul.
