{"id":101769,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\"What the... OK, this day is really starting to go strange. What the heck is in this? It\u0027s heavy... hey!\"\n At the front of the store a man\u0027s voice rose in anger. He was speaking some language I\u0027d never heard, but the threat in his voice was unmistakable. The bell on the door tinkled distantly, sending Beppo flying off my shoulder with an agitated squawk. The little monkey loped down the aisle until he was out of sight.\n \"Damn it, just when I needed - ouch! Who on earth would want to buy a guillotine? - just when I needed him, he runs off.\"\n I made my way around the blocky guillotine, rubbing my arm where I had hit it on a pointy bit of wood, past an eight-foot-tall reproduction of the Sphinx, and into the aisle that would take me to the front of the store. The small man I had seen earlier standing in the doorway was at the desk bearing an antique cash register. He looked startled to see me.\n \"Good morning. I had no idea there was anyone in the shop. Can I assist you? Are you looking for something in particular, or just browsing?\"\n \"I was just browsing while you were busy with the other customer, but I am looking for something in particular. It\u0027s a fifteenth-century manuscript named the Simia Gestor Coda. It was stolen from a nearby collector. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve heard of it?\"\n \"Stolen! Oh no, we do not deal in stolen goods,\" the man said, his soft voice filled with outrage.\n \"No, no, I didn\u0027t mean to imply you did. The owner just found out about the theft, which could have occurred up to six years ago, so there\u0027s no way anyone would have known that it was stolen.\"\n \"Regardless, I do not have any medieval manuscripts,\" the owner said stiffly.\n \"Well, it was a long shot. I\u0027m interested in contacting some of the area collectors,\" I said carefully. \"People who collect medieval antiquities such as the manuscript. Would you be able to tell me who in this region might be interested in acquiring something of that sort?\"\n \"I would be happy to appraise any object you wish to sell,\" he said quickly, moving around the desk.\n \"Thank you, that\u0027s very kind, but I prefer to talk to collectors myself.\"\n His helpful expression turned to one of stone.\n I sighed. \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d go for that. None of the other dealers and sellers have. Well, thank you anyway.\" I had started to leave when I remembered the box that had so oddly been thrust upon me. \"Oh - something popped up while I was in the back of the shop with your monkey, and gave me this. I thought maybe he mistook me for you... ?\"\n The man looked at me as if I had spider monkeys growing out of my ears. \"Something popped up?\"\n \"Yes, some sort of being or entity. Perhaps a spirit, although I haven\u0027t heard of spirits acting as delivery services. Then again, it could have been a demon - I\u0027m afraid I haven\u0027t had much experience with the dark beings, so I\u0027m not absolutely sure I would recognize one if I saw it.\"\n \"Erm...\" The man\u0027s eyes turned wary as he edged toward the part of the desk bearing a phone.\n \"Not a demon?\" I asked.\n He shook his head slowly and glanced toward the front door. \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t quite follow you, madam. I don\u0027t have a monkey, nor is my store haunted with demons and ghosts. If there\u0027s anything else I can help you with?\"\n Clearly this man was not hip to all the woo-woo stuff that went on in the Otherworld. I smiled what I hoped wouldn\u0027t look like the smile of an insane person, and said very carefully, \"My apologies for startling you - my imagination gets away with me sometimes. I assume you don\u0027t want this box?\"\n I held out the shoebox to him. He backed away as though it contained projectile leprosy. \"I\u0027m afraid I cannot accept gifts from... visitors.\"\n The words \"freakish Canadians who babble about weird stuff\" hung unspoken in the air, but I took his meaning. \"All right. I\u0027ll just leave you my card in case you do happen to hear of anyone with the Coda for sale.\"\n I extracted one of the brand-new business cards from my purse and set it down on the counter, thanking the man as I left. The box was heavy in my hands, reminding me of the rashness of hauling around a strange gift from an even stranger being. With all sorts of visions of plagues and blights in mind, I stood outside the antique store for a moment, chewing my lip.\n \"When in doubt, go to an expert,\" I said to myself, and hustled my way through the misty drizzle to the nearest bus stop. A short time and a pound coin later, I stood outside a familiar white brick building. The buildings were designed in Georgian style, all clean, classical lines, but the Diviners\u0027 House itself (donated to the Order by a grateful client) was unremarkable, its polished oak and brass door speaking of the same quiet affluence as the hotels that sat on either side of it. I shook away the bad memories of the last few years and entered the house, quickly locating one of the few remaining Diviners who would acknowledge my existence.\n \"... so I thought it would be better to have it checked out before I opened it, in case there was some sort of Pandora\u0027s box thing going on,\" I finished five minutes later, carefully watching the man who stood next to me with the box in his hands. \"What do you think? Is it something bad?\"\n Brother Jacob, head of the Scottish branch of Diviners, and erstwhile schoolmate from a childhood spent in Calgary, gave me a look that almost made me squirm. Almost. \"Sam, you didn\u0027t leave here utterly ignorant. You possess the skills to determine if this object is tainted by dark powers.\"\n \"Uh... Jake, I hate to disillusion you about any of my so-called skills, but I flunked divination, remember? I was kicked out of the Order.\"\n \"You left voluntarily,\" he said, still giving me the look that said I shouldn\u0027t be bothering him with petty things.\n \"Right. Only I was volunteered to leave by the head of the Order.\"\n \"Master Tsang was acting in your best interests - \" Jake started to say, his brow furrowed.\n I laughed and held up a hand. \"Don\u0027t worry, Jake, I\u0027m not here to start up that whole how-I-left-and-why-I-left thing. Honestly, I\u0027m over it. And perfectly willing to accept that Master Tsang was right and I was wrong about divination being my calling. I\u0027m a mutt, half human and half elf, neither one thing or another, and as we both know, divination is a gift, not a skill. Hence my inability to tell if that box is nasty or not. What do you think?\"\n Jake sighed and gave up trying to glare me into being something I just wasn\u0027t. He looked off into the distance as his hands spread across the box, an abstracted look on his face indicating he was deep in a world that only Diviners could access. \"The box itself has been in the possession of a demon.\"\n \"So that was a demon? Interesting.\"\n \"However, the object inside it does not seem to be imbued with any dark powers.\"\n \"That\u0027s good to know. So what is it?\" I asked, curious.\n Jake blinked and shot me a jaded look. \"I\u0027m not an X-ray machine, Sam. If you want to know what\u0027s in it, you\u0027ll have to find out for yourself.\"\n \"But I told you, I can\u0027t divine anything - \"\n He rolled his eyes, shoving the box back at me. \"I meant you\u0027ll have to open the box, you idiot.\"\n \"Oh.\" I smiled and punched him lightly in the shoulder, just to let him know I appreciated the insult. I bummed a pair of scissors from him to cut the leather thongs that bound the box, then popped off the lid, wondering what on earth a demon could be delivering, and whom it was supposed to be delivered to. \"Huh. It\u0027s a statue.\"\n \"Of what?\" Jake asked, peering over my shoulder. \"A bird?\"\n \"Yeah.\" I lifted the small statue from a nest of velvet material, surprised by its weight. It was gold-colored, about nine inches tall, apparently of a bird of prey. \"Looks like a hawk or falcon or some raptor like that.\"\n \"Ooooh. Is it gold?\" he asked, his voice hushed as if he was in the presence of something awe-inspiring.\n I turned the statue around, flipping it over to look at the bottom. \"I don\u0027t think so. I think it\u0027s brass.\"\n \"How can you tell?\" he asked. \"It looks like gold to me.\"\n \"One word.\" I pointed at the letters on the bottom of the statue. \"Last I heard, Taiwan wasn\u0027t knocking off gold bird statues.\"\n \"Why would someone go to the trouble of having a demon deliver a non-gold Taiwanese statue?\" Jake asked, looking as confused as I felt.\n \"That is the question, isn\u0027t it?\" I gave the bird statue another quick once-over, then put it back in the box and strapped the lid on with some packing tape. \"Maybe if I knew that, I\u0027d know who it was meant for. Thanks for your help, Jake. And for the referral. I appreciate you spreading the word about our agency.\"\n \"What are you going to do with the statue?\" he asked, waving away my thanks as he walked me to the door.\n \"You said it\u0027s not evil or anything, so...\" I shrugged, pulling my jacket close against the chilly, damp May air. \"I\u0027ll put it in a safe place until after this job is over, and then try to track down the person it was intended for. Thanks again. And stop frowning - my mother always says a frown is what brings the rain.\"\n \"That\u0027s because your mother\u0027s frowns literally do,\" he answered, yelling after me as I hurried off toward the bus stop a few streets away. \"Be careful, Sam. The statue may not be made of gold, but it clearly has some value if a demon was engaged to deliver it. Whoever it was intended for may not take kindly to you possessing it.\"\n I waved to let him know I heard, then made my way back to the office, stopping off at the store occupying the floor below to leave off the shoebox with Mila, sex shop diva, landlady extraordinaire, and more importantly, possessor of a huge black safe that squatted in the corner of her small office.\n \"I\u0027m back,\" I called to Clare as I trotted upstairs to our office. \"Did you get a list of antique dealers? Did you find out anything about that book? Why are the shades drawn? You would not believe the guy I saw in one of those long dusters that are so sexy on men. He was browsing through the condoms at the back of Mila\u0027s shop, and wow, talk about slobber city! Tall, dark, and handso - oh. Hello.\"\n \"Good afternoon.\" A man wearing a long leather coat and holding a black fedora loomed into view. For a fraction of a second my mouth hung open. Even though the room was dark, the lights on the desk illuminated him enough to see one hell of a specimen of man - short curly black hair, liquid silver eyes that glowed brightly in the dark room, and shoulders that seemed to go on forever. On the other side of the office, Clare quickly stuffed a tulip petal in her mouth, her eyes huge as she looked back and forth between the man and me. \"You are the Diviner Samantha Cosse?\"\n \"I\u0027m Sam, yes,\" I said, skating around the non-applicable Diviner label. \"Can I help you?\"\n \"I hope so. My brother - he\u0027s the tall, dark and handsome one downstairs condom shopping - referred you to me as someone who might locate a missing object for me.\"\n I sent Clare a woohoo, two-cases-in-one-day look, but she was too busy gawking at the man to catch it. Clearly, though, something was up to have her so flustered. \"I see. Well, Mr... er...\"\n \"My name is Paen Scott.\"\n \"Pain? As in... pain?\"\n \"Paen. It\u0027s a medieval name, one that runs in my family. My mother liked it.\"\n \"It\u0027s... unique. Won\u0027t you have a seat at my desk, Mr. Scott?\" I sidled over, grabbed Clare\u0027s arm, and hustled her toward the door. \"I just need a quick word with my partner. I\u0027ll be right back to take down all the details of your missing item.\"\n \"You\u0027re leaving him alone in there?\" Clare whispered as I opened the door to the hallway.\n I glanced back inside. The man stood next to the client chair in front of my desk, his hat in his hands, a dark, vibrant figure that seemed to catch my gaze and hold it.\n \"He is something, isn\u0027t he?\" I whispered back, pushing Clare through the doorway to the hall beyond. \"I know he\u0027s a potential client and all, but hoo! The guy downstairs was nice-looking, but this man is drop-dead gorgeous.\"\n Clare stared at me as if a second head had magically sprouted on my shoulders. She popped another bit of tulip in her mouth and chewed quickly. \"You think he\u0027s... handsome?\"\n She said the word like it was made up of maggots. Rotten maggots. \"Well, of course I do. I\u0027d have to be dead not to notice. What\u0027s wrong with you? Why are you so wonked out?\"\n She stared at me again. \"Don\u0027t you know what he is?\"\n \"A client?\" I asked, suddenly concerned. Clare liked men. Men worshipped Clare. For her to be in the presence of a devastatingly handsome man and not be responding with her typical flirtatious manner was very unusual.\n \"No. Yes, I mean, he is a client, but he\u0027s also...\" Her voice trailed away as she waved the remains of the tulip around.\n \"What? Gay? Married? A homicidal maniac?\"\n \"Vampire,\" she whispered, her eyes getting even bigger as she looked over my shoulder. A little shiver washed down my spine.\n \"We prefer the term Dark One, actually,\" a voice behind me said. I spun around to face the man. He had been right behind me, which meant I was now all but pressed up against him. Up close, he was even more handsome than standing across the room, the blunt line of his jaw and those bright silver eyes making my breath catch in my throat. \"Moravian Dark One is the technical name, to be exact. If you are finished with your conference, perhaps we could get to my missing statue?\"\n \"Statue?\" I asked stupidly, wondering if it was wrong to be so instantly and wholly attracted to a man, especially when that man was a... vampire? Good lord, it was almost dinnertime. What if he was peckish?\n A Diviner with a sense of humor. How amusing.\n I blinked a couple of times (like that was going to do me any good). \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m clearly a bit out of it... Did she say vampire? You\u0027re a real vampire? A Dracula-type vampire?\"\n \"I am a Dark One, yes. Is that going to be a problem to a working relationship?\" Paen asked, his voice deep, with a lovely Scottish accent that seemed to roll right through me. I shivered and rubbed my arms, wondering about my reaction to him.\n \"Well... I don\u0027t know,\" I said, thinking furiously. \"I\u0027ve never worked with a vam - er... Dark One before. I\u0027ve never even seen one. To be honest, I wasn\u0027t entirely sure that you guys existed.\"\n \"Really?\" His silver eyes roamed over my face, finally touching on my ears. Without a thought, my left hand went to my ear for a moment. \"And yet I would have guessed from your facial structure and eyes that you have some Fae blood in you.\"\n \"Something like that. My mother is an elf.\"\n \"Ah,\" he said, glancing at my nearest ear again.\n I rubbed it self-consciously. \"I had them bobbed when I was twelve. It was a coming-of-age present. I can\u0027t do anything about the tilt of my eyes, though.\"\n \"Don\u0027t. They are lovely as they are. Do I take it that your immortal heritage means you have no issues with taking my case and performing as many divinations as will be necessary to help me?\"\n I pulled myself together. Paen was a man, a potential client. His preferred choice of food was no business of mine, so long as I wasn\u0027t on the receiving end of those fangs.\n A shame. I can think of so many places I would like to nibble.\n \"I\u0027m only half elf, and not immortal, but yes, absolutely I will take your case. I have no issues whatsoever. Although, regarding the divinations...\" I bit my lip, hesitating, ignoring my inner voice to worry over something that could become an issue. He seemed to want a Diviner to do the job for him. Clearly he didn\u0027t know that I wasn\u0027t fully qualified to conduct divinations.\n \"Is there a problem?\" Paen asked, interrupting my uncomfortable thoughts.\n If I told him I wasn\u0027t a Diviner, would he take his business elsewhere? How unethical was it for me to take a job under false pretences?\n \"Miss Cosse?\"\n I sighed. It was unethical enough to make me admit the truth. \"I\u0027m not sure where you heard I was a Diviner\" - Paen glanced at Clare, who suddenly busied herself with something in a desk drawer - \"but I must tell you that although I\u0027ve had some training as a Diviner, I am not, in fact, one. So if you\u0027d like to withdraw your request for help, I will understand. However, I do have some skills in finding lost objects, and I will be happy to apply my full effort to your problem if you see fit to entrust it to us.\"\n He rubbed his chin for a moment, his eyes darkening until they were a cloudy grey. \"I appreciate your honesty. If you are confident you can help me, I see no reason to go elsewhere.\"\n I smiled, and heaved a mental sigh of relief. \"Excellent. Shall we?\" I gestured him back into the office. \"You mentioned something about a statue. It wouldn\u0027t happen to be a brass statue of a bird, a hawk or falcon, would it?\"\n He didn\u0027t even bat an eye. \"No. The statue I seek is black, of a monkey. It is called the Jilin God. Have you heard of it?\"\n My fingers itched to type the phrase into Google, but I didn\u0027t want to look so ignorant in front of a potential client. \"No, I\u0027m afraid I haven\u0027t, but admittedly, I haven\u0027t made a study of art. Can you tell me a little about it?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Ah.\" I waited a moment to see if he wanted to add to that. He just watched me. \"Er... nothing about it? Nothing at all?\"\n He made a brief, annoyed, shrugging gesture. \"Virtually nothing. I can\u0027t tell you when it was stolen from my home, what its history is, or even exactly what it looks like. All I know is its name, that it\u0027s black, and depicts a monkey. It\u0027s up to you to find it for me.\"\n Paen leaned back in his chair, a slight arrogant twist to his eyebrows, as if he was challenging me to turn down his outrageous request.\n I glanced over to Clare. She had thankfully stopped consuming flowers, but sat at her desk taking notes, a wary look on her face. That didn\u0027t bode well. Clare as a full-blooded faery (albeit one who didn\u0027t admit the fact) had an uncanny sense about people, a sense I had learned to appreciate. \"I see. Well...\" I stopped and nibbled my lip again, unsure of what I wanted to do.\n \"Yes?\"\n The fact that Clare was hesitant about Paen raised enough warning bells in my head that I considered refusing the job offer. I had one job already, after all. I wasn\u0027t desperate for another one. I hesitated for a moment, and then looked back at the man sitting in front of me, intending to tell him that I was unable to help him. But as I opened my mouth to do just that, waves of coldness rolled off him, a coldness of despair and utter emptiness that buffeted me, leaving me shivering with a sadness that seemed to have no end. \"I\u0027d like to come home with you,\" my mouth said without consulting my brain.\n I almost died. Mentally, I slapped a hand over my mouth and asked myself what my problem was.\n Paen\u0027s eyes widened. Clare\u0027s just about bugged right out of her head. \"Pardon?\" he finally asked.\n \"I\u0027m sorry. That sounded like a base proposition, which I assure you it wasn\u0027t.\"\n That\u0027s a shame, a voice in my head said.\n I ignored it. \"What I\u0027d like to do is go over your home, examining it for clues as to the nature and whereabouts of the statue. Assuming it was there in the past, I might be able to pick up some whatchamacallit... vibes and things.\"\n \"Vibes and things?\" he asked, disbelief evident for a moment in those gorgeous quicksilver eyes.\n \"Yes. Emanations and such - very powerful things. They can tell a lot about an object.\" Oh, great, Sam - babble like an idiot in front of a client. A very handsome client, not that his appearance had anything to do with it.\n But man alive, he sure rang my chimes, what with those shoulders, and that jaw, and those flashing silver eyes... A quick glance at his expression had me pulling back from that particular mental excursion. I dug through my memory of Diviner precepts and trotted out something I thought had a bit more of a professional ring to it. \"Sometimes objects leave behind a non-tangible record of their existence. Diviners can use that trail to learn more about the object itself, and tune into its wavelength, if you will, thus allowing them to locate the item.\"\n \"Hmm.\" He didn\u0027t look convinced, but at least he lost that what-the-hell-are-you-saying-you-idiot-woman-you look. In fact, for a moment there, it looked like he was trying not to smile. \"I suppose that\u0027s possible, although the statue must have been removed from my home many years ago. Its intangible record may be so weak you can\u0027t read it.\"\n \"I won\u0027t know until I can examine the house,\" I said brightly. For some reason - oh, who am I trying to fool? It was because he was so damned gorgeous, and it had been so very long since I had been with a man - I was quite determined to do anything to prolong our contact, and that included checking out his home. Honesty forced me to admit that common curiosity about what sort of a place a vampire inhabited was not going to do for an explanation of my interest in him. It was the man himself that caught my attention, and held it. \"You never know what sorts of things you can learn until you open yourself up to new experiences.\"\n An interesting array of emotions flitted across his face. At first he looked obstinate, then somewhat surprised, followed by smug, ending with a smile so fleeting I almost missed it, which quickly dissolved into a bland, expressionless look that left me even colder than before. \"Very well. As you feel it\u0027s necessary, I will allow you to conduct whatever divination rituals you need in my home. What will you require as a retainer fee?\"\n \"Nothing,\" I said, quickly flipping over the little sign that stood on the edge of my desk proclaiming that a 10 percent retainer was due at the time of engagement. \"We can talk fees and such after I\u0027ve had a chance to get a better feel for the case, if that\u0027s agreeable with you.\"\n His eyebrows rose for a moment, but settled down almost immediately. \"As you like. When would you like to examine my home?\"\n \"Anything wrong with right now?\" I asked, standing when he did.\n The surprised look was back for a moment or two in his eyes.\n A straightforward woman. What a refreshing change.\n I jerked as if I\u0027d been shocked. That wasn\u0027t my inner voice speaking to me as I had assumed it was - this was someone else. Someone male, someone with a Scottish accent that made me think of Braveheart, and men wearing kilts, and wild, sexy masculinity. In other words, it made me think of...\n \"As you put it like that, no,\" Paen said, his eyes shuttered. \"There is nothing wrong with right now.\"\n Why on earth was he talking in my head? Why and how? And why didn\u0027t I particularly mind such an intimate feeling? I ignored the questions squirreling around in my brain, confident that I would work out the answers in the near future. It was just one more curious element in what I was coming to believe was a fascinating man.\n \"Excellent. We have another case we\u0027re presently engaged with,\" I said, shooting Clare a meaningful look that, judging by the confused expression on her face, went totally over her head. I gathered up my coat and tapestry bag, closing my laptop and slipping it into the bag. \"But I think we can handle both cases without any difficulty. Clare, another minute of your time, please?\"\n Paen walked to the door as I conducted a quick whispered conference with Clare. \"You don\u0027t mind if I go check out this statue thing, do you? I was going to swing by Mr. Race\u0027s house to pick up the information about the manuscript he asked his housekeeper to get for me, but I can\u0027t do both tonight. Can you work on the manuscript case by yourself for a bit?\"\n \"Of course. I have arranged for a meeting with a fence in two hours. I can go to Mr. Race\u0027s house first, then meet the fence.\"\n \"A fence!\" I stared at Clare.\n \"Yes. Raul the fence. He wouldn\u0027t talk to me on the phone, so I am going to meet him later tonight - \"\n \"How on earth does an underwear-modeling faery know a fence?\"\n Clare gave me a wounded look. \"I do wish you would stop being so silly about that faery business. And as for Raul, I met him at a party. He is a very nice man for a criminal.\"\n Now, how on earth was I supposed to reason with that sort of an attitude? I didn\u0027t even try.\n \"Be careful, no matter how nice a criminal he is. I\u0027ll call you in a bit, after I check out Paen. Er.. check out Paen\u0027s house. It shouldn\u0027t take long, so hopefully I will be back in time to help you with your fence guy.\"\n \"All right,\" she said, her eyes worried. As I started to leave she tugged on my arm, saying in her soft, sweet voice, \"Sam, I\u0027m not sure you going to this man\u0027s home by yourself is a smart idea. He\u0027s a vampire! He\u0027s powerful! He could do any number of wicked things to you, and you wouldn\u0027t have any way of stopping him!\"\n I sighed as I looked at the dark figure waiting for me in the hallway. \"Yeah, I know. Makes me goose bumpily all over just imagining what sorts of wicked things he could do, too. Especially with those delectable lips.\"\n \"Sam - \"\n \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be fine. Unless I get lucky and Paen tries to seduce me over to the dark side.\"\n \"Sam!\"\n I laughed and patted her arm as I passed. \"Stop making that scandalized face, I\u0027m just teasing you. Nothing is going to happen. Nothing ever happens to me, remember?\"\n I really hate it when my own words come back to haunt me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-vampires-get-the-blues-dark-ones-4/page-3.html","bookId":2205,"book":{"id":2205,"title":"Even Vampires Get the Blues (Dark Ones #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Even Vampires Get the Blues (Dark Ones #4) \n Paen Scott is a Dark One: a vampire without a soul.
