{"id":36492,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV GENERAL MATRAVERS REPAYS","content":"Mademoiselle Suzanne de Freyne was travelling back to England in hot haste. On the French train she received courtesies rarely extended in these days to any solitary passenger, and at Boulogne she was hurried from the gangway of the steamer back on to the dock and into an evil-looking, four-funnelled British destroyer. Almost as she set foot on board, they moved away from the landing-stage. An officer came forward to meet her and saluted. \n \n \u0027The Captain\u0027s cabin is at your disposal, Miss de Freyne,\u0027 he announced. \u0027We have an invalided General on board, but we\u0027ve tucked him up in a bunk. Afraid we shall give you a bit of a shaking up.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I am a very good sailor,\u0027 Suzanne assured him. \u0027It is delightful that I am able to come across with you. Time counts for so much, these days.\u0027 \n \n \u0027We haven\u0027t any stewardess,\u0027 the young officer remarked, as he threw open the door of the cabin. \u0027You\u0027ll ring the bell for anything you want, though. Parsons is an awfully good fellow. And you\u0027ll excuse me, won\u0027t you? I\u0027m on duty.\u0027 \n \n He hurried up on deck, and in a few moments the destroyer was clear of the harbour and tearing across the Channel into the sombre blackness of the night. Huge waves, with a thunderous roar, swept her decks. The spray leapt high above the tops of her squat funnels, from which flashed little jets of flame. Suzanne, driven from the cabin by the craving for air, stood half-way up the companion-way, looking into the blackness. Here and there, a star seemed to reel across the face of the sky and more than once a cloud of spray swept over her head. Unhesitatingly, as though driven by some superhuman hand, they ploughed their way through the black wall of space to their destination. After the turmoil of the Channel, their slow gliding up to the side of the dock seemed almost ghostlike. Suzanne felt almost as though she herself were breathless as she stood at last upon the soaking deck. There were a couple of dim lights and a few shadowy figures upon the quay. The young officer who had spoken to her at Boulogne, stood by her side. \n \n \u0027We are throwing a gangway across for you, Miss de Freyne. I\u0027m afraid we gave you rather a rough crossing. \n \n \u0027I do not mind it,\u0027 she declared. \u0027I was only anxious to come quickly. Do you know if I shall be able to get on to London at once?\u0027 \n \n \u0027There will be a special for the General,\u0027 he told her. \u0027They\u0027ll probably take you, too.\u0027 \n \n The gangway was thrown across. The young man saluted, and Suzanne stepped on to the rain-sodden dock. An official stepped up to her at once. \n \n \u0027Miss de Freyne?\u0027 he inquired. \n \n \u0027Yes?\u0027 \n \n \u0027There is a special waiting here for General Matravers. I have had instructions to attach a coach for you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027That is very delightful!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027Shall I follow you?\u0027 \n \n The man piloted her across the track and handed her into an ordinary first-class compartment attached to the waiting train. \n \n \u0027Sorry we\u0027ve had to give the saloon to General Matravers,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Will you have any tea or coffee, or anything to eat?\u0027 \n \n She gave an order to the refreshment boy whom he summoned, and threw herself down with a sigh of content into the corner seat. Presently a tall man in khaki, with his arm in a sling and leaning upon a stick, came up the platform, followed by two junior officers. He was shown at once into the saloon and a little murmur of animated conversation arose. Five minutes later the train glided away, leaving the two junior officers disconsolate upon the long, wooden platform; passed through the two stations, and, gathering speed at every moment, rushed away northwards. \n \n Suzanne had more than once boasted that she had no nerves. She finished her coffee and sandwiches, lit a cigarette and curled herself up in her corner. For a few moments she looked out into the darkness, watching the scanty lights. Then her eyes turned, entirely by chance, towards the door which connected her carriage with the saloon. They had no sooner rested upon it than a queer, inexplicable sense of uneasiness crept over her. She tried to look away from it, to look out of the opposite window, to interest herself in the evening paper. She read a line or two, then found herself slowly lowering the sheet, found herself peering over the top towards that closed door of dark red mahogany with its brass handle. She threw the paper down, walked to the end of the carriage and back again. She must be going mad, she told herself. The only occupant of that saloon was a wounded soldier of great distinction, a General whose deeds in the earlier stages of the war had made history. He was alone there without even an A.D.C., and in any case the door was probably locked. What cause of uneasiness for her could there be in his proximity? She fought against her fit of nerves valiantly, but she found herself tearing the paper into small pieces, crumbling the remains of her roll between her fingers, sipping desperately the remnants of her cold coffee. And all the time her eyes seemed glued upon that brass door-knob. If it should move! She set her teeth to keep from screaming. When the thing really happened, it seemed to bring, to a certain extent, release from her hysterical fears. Yet for the first few seconds it paralyzed her. The handle turned, slowly and deliberately. The door was pushed open towards her. A man looked in, stooping by reason of his height, a lean, gaunt man clad in the uniform of a General. He looked at her for a moment without speech. Then he came into the compartment and closed the door behind him. \n \n \u0027What do you want?\u0027 she asked hoarsely. \n \n He saluted mechanically. \n \n \u0027I am General Matravers,\u0027 he announced. \u0027May I sit down?\u0027 \n \n She glanced at the communication cord—it was on the distant side of the carriage. Why she should have been afraid of him she could not tell, yet she felt as though she had never been in such danger in her life as when he took the seat opposite to her. \n \n \u0027I am General Matravers,\u0027 he repeated. \u0027You have heard of me, perhaps?\u0027 \n \n \u0027But naturally,\u0027 she assented. \u0027We have all read of your wonderful exploits at Mons.\u0027 \n \n He moistened his lips with his tongue. His face seemed curiously dried up, his eyes were hard, his features grim and bony. He presented somehow a queer impression of lifelessness. \n \n \u0027Mons!\u0027 he muttered ruminatingly. \u0027You\u0027ve never been to Hell, have you, young lady?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Not yet,\u0027 she answered, watching him closely. \n \n \u0027That was the beginning of it,\u0027 he went on. \u0027We need a Dante, young lady, to sing to us of those days, when the winds were driven from the face of the earth by the screeching of the shells and the roar and the clash of the guns, and they seemed to be always nearer.... Every foot of ground was red with blood, the blood of our dear soldiers, and one thought of the people at home.... I know men who lost their reason at Mons.\u0027 \n \n \u0027It must have been terrible,\u0027 she faltered. \n \n He sat opposite to her, nervously opening and closing the interlocked fingers of his hands. \n \n \u0027You know why I am coming home?\u0027 he asked abruptly. \u0027Medals enough here, you see, for a field-marshal, and I am sent home in disgrace.\u0027 \n \n She murmured something to which he paid no attention whatever. \n \n \u0027I left my two A.D.C.\u0027s at Folkestone,\u0027 he went on, \u0027forbade them to enter the train. They are worried about me. Perhaps they are right. You see, it was at—but we don\u0027t mention names—my headquarters last week. It was the night before our advance. You read about that. I won\u0027t mention the name of the place. We called it a partial success. But for the thing I am going to tell you, it might have been the turning point of the war. The attack failed—my fault.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I read that your division did splendidly,\u0027 she remarked. \n \n Again he moistened his dry lips. His hands were shaking now by his side; he seemed like a man on the verge of paralysis. \n \n \u0027This is what happened,\u0027 he continued. \u0027I was at headquarters, my own headquarters. My orderly reported a Staff Officer from the French headquarters. He came in, a typical-looking young French soldier, wearing the uniform of one of their best regiments, one of those which I knew were in the division which was to join up with ours in the morning. He was tall and dark, with a thin, black moustache, long, narrow eyes, a scar on his right cheek, sallow, and with a queer habit of swinging his left arm. He brought me some intelligible, perfectly coherent verbal instructions, asked a few questions as to my plans for the next day, gave me a personal message from the French General commanding the division, saluted, got back into his motor-car and drove off. And I thought no more about it until we found out that our whole scheme of attack was known to the enemy, and that they were prepared for us at every point. He was a German. We were sold. Thousands of my men were lost through that. My fault. He was a German. Are you a German, young lady?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Ah, but no!\u0027 she exclaimed, shrinking a little back. \n \n \u0027You are not wholly English.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I am half French and half English,\u0027 she told him. \n \n \u0027The French are good people,\u0027 he went on, relapsing into his former far-away tone, \u0027very fine people. They can fight too, and they can tell Germans when they see them. That is why I am going home—because I couldn\u0027t. I\u0027ve sworn that the next German I see, I\u0027ll kill. You\u0027re not a German, are you?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I told you just now,\u0027 she reminded him quietly, \u0027that I am half French and half English—mostly French. I am in the service of the French Government at the present moment, trying to help you, General.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Good girl,\u0027 he said absently. \u0027I thought there might have been a German in here when I heard some one moving. If I can\u0027t find one, I suppose I must shoot myself.\u0027 \n \n He took out a little revolver and examined it. He opened the breech and she saw that it was fully loaded. \n \n \u0027May I look?\u0027 she asked. \n \n He handed it to her at once. The window by which they sat was half down. She calmly threw it out. He looked at her in a mildly-vexed manner. \n \n \u0027You should not have done that, young lady,\u0027 he expostulated. \u0027I was very fond of that revolver. Besides, how am I to kill myself now?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I should wait,\u0027 she advised him. \u0027When you get to London you will easily find Germans—too many of them.\u0027 \n \n He shook his head. \n \n \u0027But I\u0027ve nothing to kill them with, and I\u0027ve left my army behind. I am sent home,\u0027 he added, with a sudden hoarse pathos. \n \n Her sense of personal fear had passed. She knew that the dangerous moment, if indeed there had been one, lay behind. \n \n \u0027There is so much work to be done in England,\u0027 she said. \n \n He seemed to be looking through the carriage windows; his hands were twitching horribly. \n \n \u0027Those nights,\u0027 he muttered, \u0027when we thought that an hour\u0027s rest had come, and the red fires came spitting from our flanks just when we thought ourselves safe, when we thought them far and away behind——\u0027 \n \n His words became unintelligible. He sat quite quiet. Presently, to her joy, she saw a carpet of lights on either side and knew that they were running into London. \n \n \u0027You had better get back to your saloon,\u0027 she said. \u0027We shall be at Charing Cross in a few minutes, and there will probably be some one to meet you.\u0027 \n \n He rose obediently to his feet. The tears were in her eyes as he turned away with a stiff little salute, and, stooping low, disappeared through the doorway. Then she leaned back with a long-drawn sigh of relief. It was a strange little episode, another of the little adventures which gave colour to her life. She leaned out of the window and saw the last of him as they drew up. He was met by an officer and an elderly lady. She saw him pass out and take his place in a waiting motor-car. Then she stepped out herself, handed her bag to a porter and was conducted to a taxicab. \n \n ***** \n \n Suzanne sat, the next afternoon, under the trees at Ranelagh with Lavendale. She leaned back in her chair and breathed a little sigh of contentment. \n \n \u0027And you, my friend,\u0027 she asked, \u0027what have you been doing? \n \n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 he answered. I am waiting for a man to arrive from America. His coming, I fancy, will provide me with work, but until then there is nothing for me. To pass the time while you were in France, I went over to Holland last week.\u0027 \n \n She nodded. \n \n \u0027The one country left which may provide us with a sensation,\u0027 she remarked. \u0027I suppose that is why you went.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I made a few inquiries,\u0027 he replied. \u0027My own impression of the people was that they wanted peace very badly and Schnapps more than anything else in the world.\u0027 \n \n She laughed softly. It was significant of his attitude towards her that he asked no questions of her own doings. \n \n \u0027I had a curious adventure on my way back from Paris yesterday,\u0027 she told him. \u0027I travelled up from Boulogne in a special with General Matravers.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Matravers?\u0027 he repeated. \u0027Isn\u0027t he one of the British Generals who have been sent home?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I believe so,\u0027 she assented, \u0027in fact I am sure of it. He told me the whole story on the way up. Afterwards he brought out a revolver and swore that he was going to shoot himself.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What on earth did you do?\u0027 he exclaimed. \n \n \u0027I took it away from him,\u0027 she replied. \u0027He wasn\u0027t in the least dangerous, really.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Look here,\u0027 Lavendale declared earnestly, \u0027I think it\u0027s quite time you left off this travelling about alone.\u0027 \n \n She laughed gaily. \n \n \u0027But, my friend,\u0027 she protested, \u0027what would you have? Can a trusted agent\u0027—she glanced around for a moment and lowered her voice—\u0027of the French and English Secret Service engage a chaperon?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t care,\u0027 he answered, a little doggedly. \u0027It\u0027s all very well for us men to take a risk or two, but it\u0027s no sort of life for a girl——\u0027 \n \n She checked him at once. \n \n \u0027You don\u0027t understand,\u0027 she interrupted. \u0027I am a daughter of France. Every drop of blood in my body, every part of myself, my soul, even, belongs to my country. The work I am doing I shall go on with, whatever it might cost me.\u0027 \n \n He did not attempt to argue with her, the finality of her tone was too absolute. \n \n \u0027I suppose it is because of this spirit,\u0027 he said, \u0027that France is invincible. Tell me——\u0027 \n \n He broke off in his sentence. Her fingers had suddenly gripped his arm, she had leaned forward in her place. Coming down the steps on to the terrace was a little group of soldiers in staff uniform. One of them, in the centre of the group, was obviously a foreigner, and, from the respect with which they all treated him, a person of distinction. \n \n \u0027Who are they?\u0027 she asked. \n \n \u0027I expect they are members of the military mission from France,\u0027 he explained. \u0027They are being entertained down here to dinner to-night by some officials from the War Office. The head-waiter told me about it. I tackled him about a table in case you cared to stay down.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But only one of them is a foreigner,\u0027 she observed. \n \n He shrugged his shoulders. \n \n \u0027I really don\u0027t know anything more about it,\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t suppose any one does. Why are you so interested?\u0027 \n \n She said nothing for a moment. The Frenchman was standing chatting amiably in the centre of the terrace, and Suzanne watched him with curious intensity. He was tall, he had a slight black moustache, his eyes were long and narrow, there was a scar on his right cheek. He was the very prototype of the man who had arisen in her mind a few hours ago, called into being by those hoarse, broken-hearted words of the ruined General. \n \n \u0027I must know his name,\u0027 she insisted. \n \n He looked at her wonderingly. \n \n \u0027But, my dear——\u0027 \n \n \u0027I must know his name,\u0027 she repeated. \u0027Please help me. Don\u0027t ask me why.\u0027 \n \n He rose at once. \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll do my best,\u0027 he promised her. \n \n He disappeared into the house. The little party of men strolled backwards and forwards along the terrace. In about five minutes Lavendale reappeared. He smiled as he approached. \n \n \u0027I got hold of the dinner cards,\u0027 he announced in triumph. \u0027His name is Lieutenant-Colonel Leychelles.\u0027 \n \n The little company of soldiers at that moment began to descend the steps. Suzanne rose to her feet and, standing under the shadow of the trees, she leaned forward. The man whom she had been watching with so much interest, was distinctly swinging his left arm. She gripped Lavendale by the elbow. \n \n \u0027Come with me,\u0027 she insisted. \u0027Come with me at once. Take me up to town.\u0027 \n \n He obeyed promptly. They passed through the house and Lavendale ordered up his car. \n \n \u0027Where to?\u0027 he asked, as he took his place at the driving wheel. \n \n \u0027I must find General Matravers,\u0027 she declared. \u0027Drive up towards London. I must think as we go.\u0027 \n \n They glided down the drive, over Hammersmith Bridge and up to the Park. \n \n \u0027Don\u0027t you belong to a club somewhere?\u0027 she asked. \u0027We must get a Who\u0027s Who.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Why, of course,\u0027 he answered. \u0027We can manage that easily enough.\u0027 \n \n He pulled up presently outside the door of the Bath Club in Dover Street. \n \n \u0027If you\u0027ll wait here for half a moment,\u0027 he suggested. \n \n She nodded and he sprang down and ran lightly up the steps. He was back again almost at once. \n \n \u0027The first name I came across,\u0027 he announced,—\u002717 Belgrave Square is the town address. Shall I drive there? It\u0027s quite close.\u0027 \n \n She assented. In a few moments they arrived at their destination. Suzanne stood under the stone portico and rang the bell. In due course a butler appeared. \n \n \u0027General Matravers is not seeing anybody, madam,\u0027 was his prompt reply to Suzanne\u0027s inquiry. \u0027The doctor has ordered him complete rest.\u0027 \n \n \u0027My business,\u0027 Suzanne explained, \u0027is very urgent.\u0027 \n \n \u0027So every reporter who has been here to-day has told me,\u0027 the man replied a little wearily. No one has been allowed to see him.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Is Lady Matravers in?\u0027 Suzanne persisted. \n \n \u0027Lady Matravers is not receiving. Perhaps you would like to leave your name and a message, madam?\u0027 the man suggested. \n \n A tall, dark-haired woman, who had been crossing the hall, paused. She came a few steps towards Suzanne. \n \n \u0027I am Lady Matravers,\u0027 she announced, \u0027Can I do anything for you?\u0027 \n \n Suzanne pressed forward and the butler stood on one side. \n \n \u0027Lady Matravers,\u0027 the former said earnestly, I have the most important business with your husband. I know he is ill—I came up from Folkestone with him yesterday—and yet I must see him.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You were his companion in the special train?\u0027 Lady Matravers asked. \u0027He spoke of a young lady who travelled up with him.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I am the young lady,\u0027 Suzanne assented. \u0027I am in the Secret Service of France,\u0027 she went on, dropping her voice a little. \u0027Your husband told me some curious things last night. It is in connection with one of them that I wish to see him. It isn\u0027t for my own sake, Lady Matravers. It is for the sake of the country.\u0027 \n \n The door was thrown open. General Matravers, leaning upon his stick, came into the hall. He was looking very white and shaken, but he seemed to recognize Suzanne. He looked at her doubtfully. \n \n \u0027It is the young lady whom I found last night in the carriage attached to my saloon,\u0027 he remarked, \u0027the young lady, my dear,\u0027 he added, turning to his wife, \u0027who threw my revolver out of the window.\u0027 \n \n Lady Matravers glanced towards the servant who was lingering in the background and led Suzanne back into the room from which she herself had issued. The General followed her. A quiet-faced woman in nurse\u0027s uniform rose from a chair as they entered. \n \n \u0027If you are really the young lady who travelled with my husband from Folkestone last night,\u0027 Lady Matravers said kindly, \u0027I am very glad indeed to meet you. He has told me such very nice things about you. The doctor\u0027s orders are that he is not to be disturbed on any account, but if you wish to speak to him for a few minutes, here he is. I was just trying to persuade him to go to bed when you came.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Perhaps what I have come to say may do your husband more good than harm,\u0027 Suzanne assured her. \u0027General,\u0027 she added, turning towards him, \u0027do you mind describing to me once more the man who came to your headquarters masquerading as a French officer, an envoy from the French Brigadier-General?\u0027 \n \n The General\u0027s face darkened. \n \n \u0027Describe him!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027Why, I can\u0027t get him out of my thoughts for a minute! He was tall, soldierly, dark, sallow, black moustache, narrow eyes, black hair cut short, a scar on his right cheek, and he had a habit swinging his left arm when he walked.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I need not ask you whether you would know him again,\u0027 Suzanne said, \u0027because I am sure you would. I may be very foolish and I may be making a very silly mistake, but there is a man over here now attached to the French Military Mission. He is being entertained to-night at Ranelagh by officials from the War Office. He leaves to-morrow, ostensibly for French headquarters, and he answers your description exactly.\u0027 \n \n All the nervousness had left the General\u0027s manner. He was perfectly calm, a little eager. He picked up his cap and cane from a table. \n \n \u0027Where is he to be found?\u0027 he asked. \n \n \u0027If you will come with me,\u0027 Suzanne promised, \u0027I will take you to him.\u0027 \n \n The nurse hastened towards them. The General pushed her aside. His tone had acquired a new firmness. \n \n \u0027Please understand, both of you,\u0027 he said, \u0027that no nurse or doctor\u0027s injunctions will keep me from doing my duty. My dear,\u0027 he added, turning to his wife and kissing her upon the forehead, \u0027this is not a matter in which you must interfere. If the young lady is mistaken, I shall come back at once. If by any chance she is right, it is imperative that I should go. I am at your service, madam.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I will take care of him,\u0027 Suzanne whispered to Lady Matravers. \n \n They let him go, doubtfully but of compulsion. He took his place in the car and acknowledged his introduction to Lavendale with a stiff salute. They started off at once. For the first time Suzanne began to be a little nervous about the outcome of their journey. \n \n \u0027This man,\u0027 she explained, \u0027is being entertained at dinner at Ranelagh at the present moment. We can go down there and you can see from the open doorway of the dining-room whether there is any truth in my suspicions. If we are wrong——\u0027 \n \n \u0027You need have no fear, young lady,\u0027 the General assured her calmly. \u0027I am a member of Ranelagh and well-known there. It will be quite in order that I stroll round the place and glance in at the dining-room. If your suspicions are, as you suggest, ill-founded, no harm will be done. If they are true,\u0027 he added, his voice shaking for a moment, \u0027if really it is vouchsafed to me in this life to find myself face to face once more with that man——\u0027 \n \n He broke off abruptly and muttered something under his breath. Not another word was spoken until they had turned in at the avenue and pulled up in front of the clubhouse. The General had become preternaturally calm. He waited, however, for Suzanne to precede him. \n \n \u0027If you will lead the way, young lady,\u0027 he suggested. \n \n They crossed through the two rooms, out on to the terrace the other side, and turned towards the dining-room. The gardens were bright with flowers, and the glow of the sunset seemed still to linger about the place. One or two visitors who had dined early were already having their coffee under the trees. From a hidden spot the musicians were tuning their instruments. Suzanne felt her heart beat rapidly as they drew near the dining-room; the General, apparently unmoved, walked with measured tread, a commanding and dignified figure. A couple of young soldiers stood up as he passed, and he accepted their salute genially. Then he passed into the dining-room. Almost immediately in front of him, at the table usually reserved for the golfers\u0027 luncheon, the dinner-party was proceeding, and on the right-hand side of the host sat the distinguished Frenchman. He was facing the door and he glanced up at the entrance of the little party. Suzanne asked no questions. She felt her breath almost stop, a little sob choked her. The faces of almost every one in the room, the laughter, the murmur of conversation, seemed suddenly in her mind to have become arrested. More than anything else in the world she was conscious of this one thing—the man who sat there knew that his hour had come, knew that Fate was marching towards him in the shape of that grim, military figure. \n \n The General walked towards the party very much with the air of one who had come to make some casual inquiry. It was only when he was recognized that a little interested murmur stole around the room. He walked to within a few feet of the Frenchman and his right hand seemed to have disappeared for a moment. \n \n \u0027Gentlemen,\u0027 he said, without unduly raising his voice but with curious distinctness, \u0027the man whom you are entertaining here as an emissary from our French allies, is an impostor, a German and a spy. He cost me, a few weeks ago, the lives of two thousand of my men. A far smaller thing, he is responsible for the ruin of my reputation. This is less than he deserves.\u0027 \n \n With hand as steady as a rock, the General held his revolver out before him and deliberately fired three times at the man whom he had accused, and who had fallen forward now, his outstretched hands sweeping the wineglasses from in front of him—stone dead.

To Suzanne de Freyne, however, it remained always one of the tense moments of her life.
