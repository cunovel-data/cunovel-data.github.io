{"id":36495,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII THE INDISCREET TRAVELLER","content":"Lavendale walked slowly down the sunny side of Pall Mall. It was early in August, and for the first time he seemed to notice some reflection in the faces of the passers-by of the burden under which the country was groaning. The usual fashionable little throng about the entrance to the Carlton, was represented by a few sombrely-dressed women and one or two wounded warriors. The glances of the passers-by towards the contents bill of the evening papers had in them a certain furtive eagerness, the fear of evil news triumphing now over the sanguine optimism of earlier days. It was just at that tragical epoch when Russia, to the amazement of the whole world, was being swept back from her frontier cities, when there were murmurs of an investment of Petrograd. Lavendale, in his light grey suit and straw hat, sunburnt, over six feet tall, broad and athletic, seemed somehow a strange figure as he passed along through streets which appeared destitute of a single man under middle-age who was not in khaki. The recruiting sergeant at the corner of Trafalgar Square, where Lavendale paused for a moment to cross the road, caught his eye and smiled insinuatingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Fine figure for a uniform, sir,\u0027 he ventured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am an alien,\u0027 Lavendale replied, watching a troop of recruits pass by. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027American, sir?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s so,\u0027 Lavendale admitted. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sergeant looked him up and down and sighed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027America\u0027s a country, begging your pardon, sir, that don\u0027t seem to have much stomach for fighting,\u0027 he remarked, as the young man passed on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale crossed the street with a slight frown upon his forehead. He made his way to the War Office and found Captain Merrill in his room alone. The two men exchanged the greetings of intimate friends. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Say, Reggie,\u0027 Lavendale began, \u0027you folks are getting kind of nervy, aren\u0027t you? A recruiting sergeant in Trafalgar Square has just gently intimated to me that I belong to a country which has no stomach for fighting.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Merrill grinned as he tossed his cigarette case over. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 he remarked, \u0027you don\u0027t seem to be exactly spoiling for the fray, do you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale lit a cigarette. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look here,\u0027 he said, \u0027it\u0027s all very well for you fellows to talk. You\u0027ve got the war fever in your blood. You\u0027re in it deep yourselves and there\u0027s a sort of gloomy satisfaction in seeing every one else in the same box. The chap who goes out to provoke a fight is worse, of course, but the one who springs up and reaches for his gun at the first chance of joining in, is playing his game, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Perhaps you are right,\u0027 Merrill admitted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not telling you or any one else exactly what my opinion is about America\u0027s policy,\u0027 Lavendale continued. \u0027I\u0027ll only remind you that, even when those truculent forefathers of ours went out to fight, they stopped to put on their armour. Is there anything fresh?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 was the somewhat doubtful reply. \u0027There is a queer sort of feeling of apprehension everywhere this morning. The Chief\u0027s been round to see the Prime Minister and on to the Admiralty. There\u0027s a rumour that he went round to Buckingham Palace, too. Looks as though there were something up.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You know all about it, I suppose,\u0027 Lavendale remarked quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not a thing!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The young American knocked the ash from his cigarette. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The history of this war,\u0027 he went on, \u0027will make mighty interesting reading, but there\u0027s another history, a history that will never be written, the history of the unrecorded things. Gee, that would make people gossip if they could get hold of only a few chapters of it! You know there\u0027s something strange afoot, Reggie. So do I, though we sit here lying to one another. I doubt whether the man in the street will ever know.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Merrill selected another cigarette. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t see where you come in here, Ambrose.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Neither do I,\u0027 the other agreed. \u0027Still, the truth comes to light in strange ways sometimes. Last night I had a cable from a friend in Petrograd, advising me to buy all Russian securities.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If there is to be any change for the better in the valuations of Russian stock,\u0027 Lavendale continued slowly, \u0027that is to say any immediate change, it can only mean one thing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Merrill struggled hard to preserve his expression of polite vacuity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There are very few people,\u0027 he murmured, \u0027who really understand Russia.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It isn\u0027t exactly my show, you know!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It ought to be,\u0027 Merrill retorted curtly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Just common-sense. If we don\u0027t win in this war, it will be your turn next. Japan and Germany you\u0027ll have to face—you can take my word for that—and I hope you\u0027ll like it. If we lose our Fleet, it\u0027s good-bye to American independence.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Plain and simple words, young fellow!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not so plain or so simple as they are true.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale threw away his cigarette and stretched out his hand for his hat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, \u0027I used to flatter myself that I was an out-and-out neutral, but I\u0027m beginning to fancy that my sympathies are leaning a little towards your side of the show. Anyhow, I\u0027ve no reason to keep secret the little I know about this affair—in fact I came down here to tell you. New York was talking openly last night of peace being proclaimed between Germany and Russia within a week.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve tried her sorely,\u0027 Merrill confessed doggedly, \u0027but I don\u0027t believe it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale rose to his feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I tell you, Merrill,\u0027 he said, \u0027if you\u0027d been about town as much as I have for the last twenty-four hours, you\u0027d begin to wonder yourself whether something wasn\u0027t amiss. These rumours and feelings of depression are one of the strangest features of the war, but there it is at the present moment, in the streets and the clubs and the restaurants—wherever you turn. I\u0027ve noticed nothing like it since the beginning of the war. The optimists are still cackling away, but it\u0027s there all the same—a grim, disheartening fear. One man told me last night that he knew for a fact that Russia was on the point of suing for peace.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Merrill shook his head as he resumed his place at his desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just a phase,\u0027 he declared. \u0027Look in and see me again, Ambrose, when you\u0027re feeling a little more cheerful.\u0027 ... \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale made a call in the Strand and passed along that crowded, illuminative thoroughfare towards the Milan. Everywhere the faces of the passers-by seemed indicative of some new apprehension. He bought an early paper, but there was no word in it of any change in the situation. On any printed presentation of the rumours which were on every one\u0027s tongue, the censor had set his foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale called in at the bar at the Milan for a few minutes. The same feeling was there even more in evidence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s it all mean?\u0027 he asked an American pressman whom he knew slightly. \\n\\n \\n\\n The newspaper man nodded sagely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Guess the cat\u0027s out of the bag now,\u0027 he opined. \u0027Russia has asked for peace and she is going to have it on generous terms. They say that negotiations are going on right here, under the Britisher\u0027s very nose. Things\u0027ll be pretty lively here soon.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale took his place in the luncheon-room, a few minutes later. As usual he glanced expectantly towards the corner which Suzanne de Freyne frequently occupied. There were no signs of her to-day, however. He gave his order and leaned back in his place. Then some fancy impelled him to glance towards the glass entrance doors on his left. He sprang at once to his feet. Suzanne, her face whiter than ever, a queer, furtive gleam in her dark eyes, was looking eagerly into the room. She saw him almost at the same moment and hurried in. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Suzanne!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027What luck! You are going to lunch with me, of course?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n A ma?tre d\u0027h?tel was holding the vacant chair at his table. With a little sigh she relapsed into it. She was plainly dressed and had the appearance of having newly arrived from a journey. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I suppose I had better have something to eat,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027Order something—anything,\u0027 she added, brushing the carte away. \u0027It was you I came to see.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He recognized at once the fact that she was in no humour for trivialities. He gave a brief order to the waiters, waved them away and leaned towards her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You can command me,\u0027 he assured her. \u0027My time is yours.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She drew a little sigh of relief. For a moment her little white fingers rested upon his strong brown hand, the tenseness passed from her manner, it was as though she found something composing in his strength. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I have been travelling for forty-eight hours,\u0027 she said, speaking under her breath, \u0027and I had an escape, a very narrow escape, in Belgium. You do not want to understand everything, do you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nothing more than you choose,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I am your Man Friday.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Listen, then. Your car—it is in order?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Perfect. I came up from Bath the day before yesterday—sixty miles on the level and never changed speeds.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027How long would it take you to get me down to the east coast?\u0027 she asked eagerly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What part?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She hesitated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A small place called Blakeney, between Sheringham and Wells.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He figured it out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Let me see,\u0027 he said,—\u0027two hours to Newmarket, two more to Fakenham, saving a little on both runs if we escaped a puncture—say four hours and a half, Suzanne.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And your car?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027In the garage, five minutes away in a taxicab.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She breathed another sigh of relief. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now I shall eat some luncheon,\u0027 she declared. \u0027You will not mind if we commit ourselves to rather a wild-goose adventure?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I shall enjoy it immensely,\u0027 he assured her, \u0027if one can use such a word at all these days.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He ordered some wine and watched the colour come back to her cheeks. Towards the end of the meal, however, she glanced often at the clock. He read her thoughts, signed his bill and stood up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am going upstairs to my room for a moment,\u0027 she said briskly. \u0027Will you have a taxicab waiting?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She was gone barely ten minutes. When she came down she carried a small travelling case and wore a thick veil. He hurried her into the taxi, drove to the garage, and in less than half-an-hour London lay behind them, and the car was gathering speed at every moment. They passed through Finchley and Potter\u0027s Bar, slowed up through St. Albans, and settled down at racing speed, northwards. Suzanne opened her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am having a delicious rest,\u0027 she murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where would you like some tea?\u0027 he inquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not yet. Push on as far as you can,\u0027 she begged. \u0027What time shall we reach Fakenham?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He glanced at the clock on the splashboard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If you really like to run right through,\u0027 he said, \u0027you shall be there by six o\u0027clock.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She patted the hand which gripped the steering wheel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You dear person!\u0027 she exclaimed softly. \u0027Now I close my eyes again. I think I will sleep a little. Until I reached my rooms at twelve o\u0027clock to-day I had not had my clothes off for two days. This air and the rest are wonderful.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She settled back in her place and he touched the accelerator with his foot. Through Stevenage and Baldock, across the great open spaces to Royston, at sixty miles an hour to Newmarket, up the hill, along the Norwich road, then round to the left to Brandon, across the miles of heath with the stunted pine trees and miles of heather, into the more luxurious pastoral country of eastern Norfolk. It was half-past five when they crossed Fakenham Common and crept through the narrow streets of the old-fashioned town. He turned to look at her. She was still sleeping. She woke, however, as the car slackened speed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where are we?\u0027 she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Fakenham,\u0027 he told her, \u0027with half-an-hour to spare. It\u0027s just half-past five.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You wonderful person,\u0027 she sighed, shaking herself free from the rugs. \\n\\n \\n\\n They drew up in the archway 01 the hotel and made their way up the outside stairs into the old-fashioned coffee-room. She drank tea and toyed with her bread and butter absently. She looked continually out of the window, seawards. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is a wonderful day,\u0027 she said thoughtfully. \u0027There is no wind at all. They might come even before the time.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He made her light a cigarette, followed her example, and in a few minutes they were again in the car. Half-an-hour later they looked down upon the quaint, old-world village of Blakeney, set amidst the marshlands, and beyond, the open sea. Suzanne was all alertness now and sat up by his side, gazing eagerly towards the line of white breakers. Suddenly, with a warning hoot, a long, grey car which had come up noiselessly behind them, swept past at a great speed. Suzanne gave a little exclamation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is the car, I am sure!\u0027 she declared. \u0027It has come to meet him! All that I was told is true.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s some car, all right,\u0027 Lavendale remarked, \u0027but I wouldn\u0027t have taken his dust as quietly as this if I\u0027d heard him coming.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She laughed at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That car,\u0027 she said, \u0027is bound on the same errand that we are. It is on its way to Blakeney to meet the same passenger.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, we\u0027re in time, anyway,\u0027 was his only comment. \\n\\n \\n\\n They slackened speed as they turned into the long, narrow street. About half-way down, the car in front of them was stopped by a soldier with drawn bayonet. A non-commissioned officer by the side was talking to the driver. Close at hand, a man in civilian clothes was lounging in front of what seemed to be the guardroom. Suzanne clutched her companion\u0027s arm in excitement. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ambrose!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027That\u0027s Major Elwell—the man in mufti, I mean! He is one of the chiefs of the English Secret Service.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I shall have to know a little more about this before I can catch on,\u0027 Lavendale confessed. \\n\\n \\n\\n He brought his car slowly up behind the other one. The driver had raised his goggles and was seated in an impassive attitude whilst his license was being examined. Presently the little green book was returned to him and he moved slowly down the village street. Lavendale\u0027s license was inspected in the same fashion, after which they, too, followed down the village street, which terminated abruptly in a small dock, reached by an arm of the sea. Lavendale turned his car into the gateway of the inn, and together, a few moments later, they strolled down to the harbour. Only a thin stream of water covered the bottom of the estuary, scarcely enough to float a rowing boat, and one or two sailing barques were lying high and dry upon the mud. The stranger, who had drawn up his car by the side of the wall, was standing looking out seaward through a pair of field-glasses. Lavendale gazed across the marshes in the same direction, doubtfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Say, you don\u0027t expect any ship that could cross the North Sea to come into dock here, do you?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n She nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Quite a large ship could come up at high tide,\u0027 she explained, \u0027but to-night they will not wait for the deep water. They will anchor outside and sail up in a smaller boat. Come for a walk a little way. That man is watching us.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They strolled along a sandy lane, through a gate on the left opening on to the marshes. It was a grey and sombre evening, strangely still, colourless alike on sea and land and sky. A thin handful of cattle was stretched across the dyke-riven plain, a crowd of seagulls flapped their wings wearily overhead. Everywhere else an intense and almost mournful silence prevailed. Suzanne climbed to the top of one of the dykes and looked intently seaward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You see!\u0027 she exclaimed, pointing. \\n\\n \\n\\n A small boat was anchored at the opening of the estuary. Beyond, almost on the horizon, was a thin line of smoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They will not wait for the tide,\u0027 she told him, \u0027not the full tide, that is. They will come up as soon as that sailing boat can make the passage.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And who,\u0027 Lavendale inquired, \u0027will be the passenger?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Her eyes flashed for a moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He will be the man,\u0027 she said solemnly, \u0027who seeks to destroy France.\u0027 ... \\n\\n \\n\\n They wandered a little way further out into the marshland. The air seemed to possess a peculiar saltiness—even in that slightly moving breeze they could feel the brackish taste upon their lips. They watched the tidal way grow deeper every minute. On either side of them the narrow dykes and curving waterways grew fuller and fuller with the tendrils of the sea. About a mile from the distant coast-line the steamer seemed to have come to an anchor, and the white-sailed boat was fluttering about her. Suzanne took Lavendale\u0027s arm. He could feel that she was trembling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look here,\u0027 he begged, \u0027tell me a little more of what is going to happen?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Somebody will be landed from that steamer,\u0027 she said. \u0027They will come up here, get into the motor-car and start for London. That some one will be empowered to put certain propositions before the Russian Ambassador here, which he in his turn can convey to the Tsar in code. Those propositions will be for a peace which will exclude my country and yours, which will give Russia, temporarily defeated, the terms of a conquering nation.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He laughed a little contemptuously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t need to worry, child,\u0027 he assured her. \u0027Russia isn\u0027t going to cave in yet awhile.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not in any ordinary fashion,\u0027 she replied, \u0027but one lives in dread of some terrible disaster, and then—— These terms, they say, are to be left over for a month. Think of the temptation—all the fruits of victory offered in the very blackest moment of despair. Look!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She pointed to the mouth of the river. The white-sailed boat was already commencing the passage of the estuary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Come,\u0027 she exclaimed, \u0027we must get back.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They hurried across the marsh, finding their way with more difficulty now owing to the inward sweep of the tide, filling the narrow places with the soft swirl of salt-water. When they reached the raised path by the side of the estuary, the sailing boat was almost by their side. A man was seated in the stern, muffled up in an overcoat and wearing a tweed cap. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There he is,\u0027 she murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale glanced at the man in a puzzled fashion. Just at that moment the latter turned his head. He was dark, clean-shaven, and slightly built. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Something rather familiar about him,\u0027 Lavendale muttered. \u0027You don\u0027t know his name?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She shook her head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Wait,\u0027 she begged. \\n\\n \\n\\n They reached the dock just as the boat was drawing up to the quay-side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Get out the car, please,\u0027 Suzanne directed, \u0027and drive slowly up the street, just past the guardroom. Wait there as though we had been stopped again.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale obeyed. This time, as they drew up, Major Elwell leaned over the front of the car. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He is here, I understand, Miss de Freyne,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Are you going to stay? There may be a little trouble.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She laughed derisively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This is Mr. Lavendale,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027He will take care of me, Major Elwell.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The latter looked keenly at Lavendale and nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a queer piece of business, this,\u0027 he observed. \u0027Maybe our information is all wrong, after all.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The other car came gliding up the village street and was brought to a standstill only a foot behind them. The driver addressed the sergeant almost angrily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I showed you my license a few minutes ago,\u0027 he protested. \u0027What\u0027s that other car doing ahead, blocking up the way?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale drew slightly on one side. A soldier, with fixed bayonet, slipped into the little space between the two cars. Major Elwell turned towards the passenger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sorry to trouble you, sir,\u0027 he said, \u0027but I must ask you to step inside the guardroom for a moment.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What do you want with me?\u0027 was the quick reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve landed from a steamer here, rather an exceptional thing to do anyway,\u0027 Major Elwell explained. \u0027There are just a few questions we should like to ask.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m an American citizen,\u0027 the other declared. \u0027I have my passport here. I can land where I choose.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027In ordinary times, without a doubt,\u0027 the Major replied smoothly. \u0027Just now, I am sorry to be troublesome, but there are some new enactments which have to be considered. We shall have to ask you to give up anything you may have in the way of correspondence, for instance, to be censored.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a moment\u0027s silence. The face of the man in the car had suddenly become tense. Lavendale, who had been looking around, gave a little start. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Why, it\u0027s Johnson!\u0027 he exclaimed—\u0027Leonard Johnson! You remember me, don\u0027t you—Lavendale?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The man in the car nodded eagerly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course!\u0027 he assented. \u0027Look here, if you\u0027ve any pull in these parts, I wish you\u0027d persuade this officious gentleman to let me go on quickly. I\u0027m in a hurry to reach London.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t,\u0027 Lavendale regretted. \u0027I\u0027m hung up myself for some piffling reason. Where have you come from?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Holland,\u0027 was the brief reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If you are really in a hurry, sir,\u0027 Major Elwell intervened politely,\u0027 you are only wasting time by this discussion with your friend. Before you proceed, you will have to come into the guardroom with me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m damned if I do!\u0027 Mr. Johnson replied. \u0027If you lay hands on me, I\u0027ll report the whole affair at the Embassy directly I arrive in London. I\u0027m well enough known there, and they\u0027ll tell you that I am in the American Embassy at Berlin.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale shook his head gently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not at the present moment, I think, Johnson,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027I\u0027ll answer for it, though, that you are a reputable American citizen.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My instructions are entirely independent of your nationality,\u0027 Major Elwell said firmly. \u0027I must trouble you to descend at once.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was scarcely a whisper, scarcely even a glance between the two men in the hindmost car. Action seemed to be entirely spontaneous. Their car, which had moved perhaps a foot or so back while they were talking, as though the brakes had failed to hold, was suddenly swung to the right. The front wing caught the soldier who was standing on guard, and the car, plunging forward with one wheel upon the pavement, threw him off his balance. He reeled back against the wall, and almost before they could realize what had happened, the car was tearing up the hill. The sergeant snatched a rifle from one of the men but Major Elwell stretched out his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t want that!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027Telephone at once to all the places en route to London, car number LC 3221. Can you make any sort of speed, Mr. Lavendale?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Jump in,\u0027 was the grim reply. \u0027You\u0027ll soon see.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They dashed up the hill, travelling almost at the same speed as the other car. As they passed the church they saw it a speck in the distance, climbing the next hill. Lavendale slipped in his fourth speed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Thank God for the dust!\u0027 he muttered. \u0027We shall see which way they go. Hold on, Suzanne. We\u0027ll have to take risks.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The air rushed past them. The finger of the spedometer crept up from thirty to fifty and sixty miles an hour. They swung round the corner, and through a tiny village, a cloud of dust rising behind, heedless of the curses shouted after them by the irate foot passengers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s gone to the right,\u0027 Lavendale announced. \u0027That\u0027s Letheringsett. He\u0027ll leave the London road, though, if he can.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll try to give you the slip,\u0027 Major Elwell remarked, \u0027and take the train from somewhere.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale smiled. The finger in front of them was still creeping upwards. They missed a hay wagon by a few inches. The pillar of dust in front of them grew nearer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll shepherd him into Fakenham,\u0027 Lavendale muttered. \u0027I could catch him now, if I wanted. They\u0027ll have had the message there, though.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They skirted Letheringsett, up the hill, round corner after corner, through Thursford, with barely a hundred yards dividing them. Once, at some cross-roads, the car in front seemed to hesitate and they shot up to within fifty yards. The light now was becoming bad. There were little patches of shadow where the trees overhung the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re giving it up!\u0027 Lavendale exclaimed. \u0027By Jove, we\u0027ve got them!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He pointed forward. The road running into Fakenham narrowed. A line of three soldiers stood across the thoroughfare. With a grinding of brakes and ponderous swaying of the foremost car, the chase was over. Mr. Leonard Johnson descended, shaking the dust from his coat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Following me?\u0027 he asked Lavendale sarcastically. \\n\\n \\n\\n Major Elwell\u0027s hand fell upon his shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re not meaning to lose sight of you again just yet, sir,\u0027 he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You know what risk you run in interfering with an American citizen?\u0027 the other demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Perfectly,\u0027 Major Elwell replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t, that\u0027s certain, or you wouldn\u0027t attempt it,\u0027 Johnson snapped. \u0027However, we can\u0027t talk in the street. I\u0027ll get into your car and go on to the inn with you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They drove on to the Crown Inn, mounted the outside staircase, Lavendale in front and Major Elwell bringing up the rear. The coffee-room was empty. They rang for refreshments and dismissed the waiter. Johnson threw back his overcoat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now, let\u0027s have this out,\u0027 he began truculently, addressing Major Elwell. \u0027Who the mischief are you, and what do you mean by following me like this?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am censor for the neighbourhood in which you landed from Holland, Mr. Johnson,\u0027 was the quiet reply. \u0027Your present position is entirely the result of your own injudicious behaviour.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What exactly do you want?\u0027 Johnson demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027After your attempts to escape,\u0027 Major Elwell announced, \u0027I shall be compelled to search you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnson drew a revolver from his pocket. His manner remained bellicose. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look here,\u0027 he said, \u0027if you\u0027re looking for trouble you can have it. I don\u0027t recognize the right of anybody to interfere with my movements.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Major Elwell strolled slowly across the room to where Johnson was standing, looking all the time down the muzzle of the outstretched revolver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027One moment, Mr. Johnson,\u0027 he said. \u0027Do you mind glancing out of this window? No, you can keep your weapon—I\u0027ve no designs on that. Just look down into the street.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnson did as he was bidden. Half a dozen soldiers were lined up outside the entrance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Then out of the door, if you please,\u0027 the Major further suggested. \\n\\n \\n\\n He held it open. At the bottom of the stairs a sentry was standing with drawn bayonet. Johnson stared at him for a moment. Then he turned abruptly away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look here,\u0027 he said hoarsely, \u0027this censor business don\u0027t go with me. You\u0027re lying!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Perhaps so,\u0027 Major Elwell admitted smoothly, \u0027and so are you. You mentioned, I think, that you had been in the American Embassy at Berlin. You omitted to mention, however, that you have since joined the German Secret Service. As that fact is well-known to us, you can understand, I dare say, why we regard this landing of yours upon a lonely part of the coast with some—shall I say suspicion?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnson stood very still for a moment. He seemed to be thinking deeply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This censorship of yours is a bluff, I suppose,\u0027 he muttered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Amongst many other positions,\u0027 Major Elwell admitted, \u0027I also hold a somewhat important place in the English Secret Service. You have, I trust, one of the first qualifications for useful service in your profession—you are able to recognize the inevitable? You are face to face with it now.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a brief silence. Johnson was standing at the window with his hands behind him. Presently he turned around. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 he pronounced curtly, \u0027you\u0027ve got me fairly enough. Go ahead.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You see,\u0027 Major Elwell explained, \u0027you might, under the present laws, be treated as an ordinary indiscreet traveller—or as a spy. Better hand over everything you are carrying.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnson opened his coat pocket and threw a few letters and a pocket-book upon the table. Major Elwell glanced them through and sighed. Then he turned towards Suzanne. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If you would give us a couple of minutes, please,\u0027 he begged. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale led her out into the yard. In a few minutes the door behind them was thrown open. The Major was standing at the top of the steps. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s the car?\u0027 he shouted—\u0027the car they came in?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale looked down the yard and dashed into the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s the other car?\u0027 he asked one of the soldiers on guard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No instructions to detain it, sir,\u0027 the man replied. \u0027The chauffeur drove it to the garage to fill up with petrol.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They ran across the street in a little procession. The man in charge of the place stared at them, a little dazed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Car came in about ten minutes ago—a great Delauney-Belleville,\u0027 he informed them. \u0027She filled up and started off for London.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Major Elwell turned towards Lavendale and laughed hardly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That fellow\u0027s first job, he muttered, \u0027and he\u0027s done us in! The documents he was carrying are in that car!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n \\n\\n Major Elwell spent the next hour in the telegraph office whilst Lavendale and Suzanne raced southwards. More than once they had news of the car of which they were in pursuit. At Brandon it was only twenty minutes ahead, and at Newmarket they learnt that the driver had called at the station, found there was no train for an hour and continued his journey. From Newmarket, through Six-Mile-Bottom and onwards, they touched seventy miles an hour, and even Suzanne shivered a little in her seat. At the Royston turn the sparks flew upwards through the grey light as Lavendale\u0027s brakes bit their way home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Two ways to London here,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027Wait.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He took a little electric torch from his pocket and stooped down in the road. In less than a dozen seconds he was back in the driving seat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027By Royston,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027I fancy, somehow, we are gaining on him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They tore onwards along the narrow but lonelier road. Once, on a distant hillside far in front, they caught the flash of a light. Lavendale gave a little whoop of triumph. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We shall get him,\u0027 he cried fiercely. \u0027We\u0027ve twenty miles of road like this to Royston.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The excitement of the chase began to tell on both of them. Suzanne, sitting close to the side of the car, leaned a little forward, her eyes bright, her hair wind-tossed, her cheeks flushed, breathless all the time with the lashing of their speed-made wind. Lavendale sat like a figure of wood, leaning a little over his wheel, his hands rigid, his whole frame tense with the strain. Once more they saw the light, this time a little nearer. Then they skidded crossing an unexpected railway track, took a few seconds to right themselves, and the light shot ahead. They passed through Royston and shot up the hill, scarcely slackening speed. It was a little before moonlight now, and the heath stretching away on their left seemed like some silent and frozen sea on which the mists rested lightly. Suddenly a little cry broke from Lavendale\u0027s lips, his foot crushed down upon the brakes. In front of them, by the side of the road, was the other car, disabled, its left wheel missing, the driving seat empty. They came to a standstill within a few feet of it and Lavendale leapt lightly out. Lying with his head upon the grass was the driver. Lavendale bent rapidly over him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The front wheel must have shot off and pitched him forward,\u0027 he explained to Suzanne. \u0027I\u0027m afraid he is hurt. You\u0027d better go and sit in the car.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the woman he had seen nothing of blazed out from the girl by his side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do not be foolish,\u0027 she cried fiercely. \u0027He is alive, is he not? Quick! Search him!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale for a moment was staggered. He was feeling for the man\u0027s heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What is the life or death of such as he!\u0027 she continued, almost savagely. \u0027Search him, I say!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale obeyed her, a little dazed. There was a license, a newspaper of that morning\u0027s date, a few garage receipts for petrol, a handkerchief, a penknife and a large cigarette case—not another thing. She pushed him on one side while she felt his body carefully. The man opened his eyes, groaning. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My leg!\u0027 he muttered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale stood up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I think that\u0027s all that\u0027s the matter with him,\u0027 he pronounced—\u0027fracture of the leg. We\u0027d better take him back to the hospital.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Leave him alone,\u0027 she ordered. \u0027Come here with me at once.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale obeyed mutely. She sprang up into the dismantled car and began feeling the cushions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look in the pockets,\u0027 she directed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale turned them inside out. There were maps, a contour book, an automobile handbook, more garage receipts, an odd glove—nothing of interest. Suddenly Suzanne gave a little cry. She bent closer over the driving cushion, pulled at a little hidden tab, opened it. There reposed a letter in a thick white envelope, the letter of their quest. Lavendale flashed his electric torch upon it. It was addressed in plain characters:— \\n\\n \\n\\n To His Excellency. \\n\\n \\n\\n He thrust it into his pocket. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look here,\u0027 he insisted, \u0027we\u0027ve found what we want. We must see about that man now.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They lifted him into their car and drove him back to the hospital. Lavendale left money, called at the police-station and gave information about the accident. Then they ran up to the hotel and stood side by side for a moment in the dimly-lit, stuffy coffee-room. He drew the letter from his pocket. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n She glanced at the seal—huge and resplendent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is only the first part of our task that is done,\u0027 she sighed, \u0027yet everything is ready for the second. That letter will be delivered. It is the answer we want.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She took the letter and placed it in the small bag she was carrying. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Some sandwiches, please,\u0027 she begged, \u0027and then London.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n \\n\\n Twenty-four hours later they sat in her little sitting-room. Suzanne was restless and kept glancing at the clock, lighting cigarettes and throwing them away. Often she glanced at Lavendale, imperturbable, a little troubled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Why do you frown?\u0027 she demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he answered simply. \u0027This business has its dark side, you know. I was thinking of it from your point of view. You are going to open a friend\u0027s letter—that\u0027s what it comes to. You\u0027re on fire to see whether your friend, whom you should trust, is as honourable as you think him. It leaves an unpleasant flavour, you know.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She came to a standstill before him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My friend,\u0027 she said, \u0027you have something yet to learn in our profession. It is this—honour and joy, conduct itself, idealism, all those things that make up the mesh of life, lose their significance to the man or woman who works for his country as I have done, as you have commenced to do. I am for France alone, and for France\u0027s sake I have no character. For France\u0027s sake I have sent a dummy messenger to the Prince. For France\u0027s sake I shall open the reply. It may tell me everything, it may tell me nothing, but one must be warned.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a ring at the bell. A young man entered, closing the door behind him. Suzanne almost sprang towards him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You have the answer?\u0027 she cried. \\n\\n \\n\\n The messenger bowed. Suzanne was suddenly calm. She tore open the long, thick envelope with trembling fingers. She peered inside for a moment, doubtfully. Then her whole face relaxed, her eyes flashed with joy. She held the envelope up over the table. A little stream of torn pieces of paper fell from it. Her eyes were moist as she watched them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is the offer of our enemy,\u0027 she cried, \u0027and the answer of our ally! Some scraps of paper!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1900/54746.html","bookId":924,"book":{"id":924,"title":"Ambrose Lavendale, Diplomat","description":"简介： It was a few minutes after one o\u0027clockthe busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in London.
