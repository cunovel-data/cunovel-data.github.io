{"id":36498,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT","content":"Lavendale was closeted with a Personage, and the interview to which he found himself committed came as something of a shock to him. The Personage was not in the habit of wasting his words, and he spoke succinctly and to the point. \n \n \u0027To sum up, Mr. Lavendale,\u0027 he concluded. \u0027we have received direct and categorical complaints concerning you, forwarded to us through the German Ambassador in Washington. It is stated that whilst enjoying the shelter and privileges of your association with the Embassy here, you have rendered direct aid to a Branch of the French Secret Service in this country, and that you were yourself responsible for the interception of an important communication from Berlin.\u0027 \n \n \u0027That\u0027s Leonard Johnson,\u0027 Lavendale muttered. \n \n \u0027The case of Leonard Johnson has, I believe, been cited,\u0027 the Personage admitted, \u0027but your association with a certain member of the French Secret Service has led you, I am informed, into further enterprises not entirely in accordance with your position as an American official.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Am I to understand that you wish me to resign, sir?\u0027 Lavendale asked. \n \n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 the Personage replied cheerfully, \u0027is further from my intentions. I wish you to reform. Remember you are an American, that\u0027s all. Now go and pay us a visit on the other side. I am coming in to do a little hand-shaking myself presently.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale put behind him what he felt might be one of the crises of his life, and made his way to the ambassadorial reception rooms. He paid his respects to his Chief\u0027s wife and family and talked for a while to one of the junior secretaries. A clean-shaven man, tall and slim, with gold spectacles and smooth hair, came up to them presently with a smile. \n \n \u0027I hope you haven\u0027t quite forgotten me, Mr. Lavendale,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m Anthony Silburn. Four years before your time, but we\u0027ve met once or twice in New York.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Of course,\u0027 Lavendale assented. \u0027As a matter of fact, we are connections, aren\u0027t we? You married my cousin, Lydia Green.\u0027 \n \n They sat in a corner and talked for some time of common acquaintances. Mr. Anthony Silburn, besides having the advantage of a frank and engaging manner and a distinct sense of humour, was, as Lavendale very well knew, one of the wealthiest and most enlightened of American millionaires. \n \n \u0027I tell you what it is, young fellow,\u0027 Mr. Silburn declared, as they parted, \u0027you\u0027ll have to come down and spend a week-end with us, any time you like. I\u0027ve got a real old country house in Norfolk—leased it before the war broke out—Hookam Court, near Wells. Bring your guns down. Well, I\u0027m off now to catch the five o\u0027clock train home.\u0027 \n \n He departed, with a little farewell nod. Lavendale looked after him thoughtfully. \n \n \u0027One of the most successful men in America,\u0027 somebody by his side remarked. \u0027I wonder what he thinks about the war. He was educated in Germany—I am not sure that he wasn\u0027t born there.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale made his adieux a little later and walked thoughtfully towards the Milan Court. He sent his name up, but there was no reply from Suzanne\u0027s rooms. \n \n \u0027Miss de Freyne went out on Monday night,\u0027 the hall-porter told him. \u0027She was motoring, I think, but she had very little luggage. She hasn\u0027t been back since. We\u0027ve had a great many telephone messages for her.\u0027 \n \n The circumstance was not in itself unusual, but Lavendale was conscious of a queer little feeling of uneasiness. Suzanne never left town without letting him know and she had been engaged to dine with him that night. \n \n \u0027I think I\u0027ll go up and speak to her maid,\u0027 he said. \n \n The man pointed towards the lift. \n \n \u0027There she is, sir, just come in.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale crossed the hall and touched the woman on the shoulder. She was a dark-visaged, melancholy-looking person of middle age, with an extraordinary gift for taciturnity. \n \n \u0027Do you know where your mistress is, Anne?\u0027 he asked. \n \n The woman appeared to recognize him with some relief. She evaded a direct reply, however. \n \n \u0027Would you be so kind as to come upstairs, sir?\u0027 she invited. \n \n Lavendale followed her to Suzanne\u0027s suite. She stood on one side for him to enter and closed the door carefully. \n \n \u0027Monsieur,\u0027 she began, \u0027my mistress once told me that if there was trouble I was to come to you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Quite right,\u0027 Lavendale assented quickly. \u0027What is it?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Mademoiselle left me at six o\u0027clock on Monday night,\u0027 the maid proceeded. \u0027I know nothing as to her destination except that her journey was decided upon quite suddenly and that she had a motor ride of over a hundred miles. She expected to be back the next day. If not, she promised to send me some instructions. Since then I have heard nothing of her.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale reflected for a moment. \n \n \u0027How much are you in your mistress\u0027 confidence?\u0027 he inquired. \n \n \u0027She has trusted me often with her life,\u0027 was the quiet reply. \n \n \u0027You understand her real position?\u0027 \n \n \u0027But naturally.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Then do you know,\u0027 Lavendale went on, \u0027if there is any headquarters of the French Secret Service in this country—any one from whom we could get any idea as to her mission?\u0027 \n \n The woman shook her head. \n \n \u0027There are others working often with Mademoiselle,\u0027 she said. \u0027I know no names—only this. In case of the very deepest anxiety, but only in extremes, I have a telephone number here which I could ring up.\u0027 \n \n She opened her purse and drew out a slip of paper. \n \n \u0027It is, I believe, a private number,\u0027 she continued, \u0027and not in the book. I made up my mind that if Mademoiselle had not returned this afternoon, I would ring up.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Let us do so at once,\u0027 Lavendale suggested. \n \n \u0027If monsieur would be so kind,\u0027 she begged, pointing to the instrument. \u0027My English is not good, and I do not know with whom I should speak.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Whom am I to ask for?\u0027 Lavendale inquired. \n \n \u0027No names are to be mentioned,\u0027 the woman replied, \u0027and the number can only be rung up between five and seven. It is six o\u0027clock now,\u0027 she added. \n \n Lavendale took off the receiver and asked for the number. There was a moment\u0027s pause. Then a remarkably clear voice answered him. \n \n \u0027Well?\u0027 \n \n \u0027It is a friend of Mademoiselle de Freyne who speaks,\u0027 Lavendale said. \n \n \u0027That is well,\u0027 the voice replied. \u0027Continue.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Miss de Freyne left her rooms at the Milan Court last Monday night, on secret business. She promised to communicate with her maid the next day. She has not done so. She left in a motor-car and with very little luggage. She made the remark that she had a ride of over a hundred miles.\u0027 \n \n \u0027That is all you know, Mr. Lavendale?\u0027 \n \n Lavendale started a little at the sound of his own name. \n \n \u0027It is all,\u0027 he assented. \n \n \u0027Kindly go and repeat what you have told me to Major Elwell, room 17, number 33, Whitehall.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale replaced the receiver and turned to Anne. \n \n \u0027I am instructed,\u0027 he said, \u0027to apply to a man whom I know to be in the English Secret Service.\u0027 \n \n \u0027It would be well,\u0027 the maid advised, \u0027if monsieur applied there at once.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale walked briskly out of the Milan by the back exit, through the Gardens, along the Embankment and into Whitehall. He found number 33 a long, narrow, private house taken over by the Government. Number 17 consisted of a small office in which two men were busy writing, and an inner room. Lavendale made his inquiry and was told that Major Elwell would be back in an hour. He scribbled a note, making an appointment, and walked back to his own rooms. He let himself in, paused to speak for a moment with his servant, who was laying out his clothes, and turned towards the sitting-room. As he opened the door the telephone bell began to ring insistently. He crossed the room, took up the receiver, and tapped the instrument. \n \n \u0027What is it?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Hullo? Hullo?\u0027 \n \n Somewhere in the distance he heard a voice say faintly—\u0027Trunk call\u0027—and for a moment he was patient. Then he gave a little start. A familiar voice, yet unfamiliar, shaking with something like fear, tremulous, hysterical, terrified, murmured his name. His heart leapt with quick sympathy, his fingers shook. \n \n \u0027Ambrose! Ambrose! Is that you? Speak quickly!\u0027 \n \n \u0027I am here, Suzanne,\u0027 he cried. \u0027Where are you?\u0027 \n \n Suddenly he seemed to hear turmoil and confusion, a man\u0027s voice, a woman\u0027s shriek. \n \n \u0027At Hook——\u0027 \n \n Then there was silence. The connection had been broken. Lavendale rang up furiously. At last he got the exchange. The young man who answered his inquiry could tell him nothing. He rang through to the inquiry office with little better result. They would make inquiries and let him know from whence the call came. They believed that it was from a call office. He could gain no further information. He set down the instrument at last in despair and walked up and down the room. She was in trouble, danger. \u0027Hook—?\u0027 \u0027Hook—?\u0027 What was there familiar to him in the commencement of that word? He repeated it feverishly. Then he remembered—Hookam Court—Anthony Silburn, whom he had met that afternoon at the Embassy. It was hard to discover any connection, however. He drove back to the Milan Court and found Anne. \n \n \u0027Is there any news, monsieur?\u0027 she asked anxiously. \n \n \u0027None at present,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027I cannot see Major Elwell for another half-hour. Tell me, have you ever heard your mistress mention any place of which the first syllable is \"Hook\"?\u0027 \n \n \u0027\"Ook,\"\u0027 Anne repeated dubiously. \u0027No, monsieur!\u0027 \n \n \u0027Hookam Court,\u0027 Lavendale went on, \u0027Anthony Silburn—Norfolk—none of that is familiar?\u0027 \n \n \u0027But no, monsieur!\u0027 \n \n He kept the secret of the telephone message to himself and made his way round once more to Whitehall. Major Elwell was seated in his office and received him at once. There was nothing unusual about the place except a large array of telephones. Lavendale told his story quickly. The Major listened without comment. \n \n \u0027Well?\u0027 Lavendale asked eagerly, when he had finished. \n \n Major Elwell was occupied in drawing small diagrams with his pencil on the edge of the blotting-paper. \n \n \u0027We must see what can be done,\u0027 he remarked at last. \u0027Hook\u0027—that is absolutely all you heard?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Absolutely,\u0027 Lavendale assured him. \n \n \u0027And you have a friend who lives at Hookam Court in Norfolk—Mr. Anthony Silburn?\u0027 he said meditatively. \u0027A very remarkable man, Silburn—likely to be President some day, they tell me.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Who cares about that!\u0027 Lavendale exclaimed, a little curtly. \u0027What can we do, Major Elwell? I dare say you know as much as I do, and more. Miss de Freyne has been very successful during the last few months, and there is no doubt they\u0027d give anything they could to get hold of her on the other side. But in England—surely there can\u0027t be any organization over here strong enough for actual mischief!\u0027 \n \n \u0027Scarcely,\u0027 Major Elwell agreed. \u0027Scarcely. \u0027H—double O—K,\u0027 he went on meditatively. \u0027You see, there are about fifty places in the United Kingdom beginning like that.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale felt his courage slipping away. There was something curiously unimpressive in the carefully-dressed, imperturbable Englishman, who was occupied now in polishing his eyeglass. \n \n \u0027Isn\u0027t there anything we can be doing instead of sitting here talking?\u0027 he asked impatiently. \n \n \u0027Always a mistake,\u0027 Major Elwell declared, \u0027to do things in a hurry. Have a cigarette,\u0027 he went on, offering his case. \u0027I think I\u0027ll stroll out and talk with a friend over this little matter.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Isn\u0027t there a thing I can do?\u0027 Lavendale persisted. \n \n \u0027Well,\u0027 Major Elwell said thoughtfully, \u0027you spoke of an invitation to visit your friend Mr. Anthony Silburn at Hookam Court. Why not motor down there to-morrow? It\u0027s one of the places in the country that your call might have come from, at any rate.\u0027 \n \n A derisive reply quivered upon Lavendale\u0027s lips. Then, for some reason or other, he changed his mind and remained silent. Major Elwell, without any appearance of hurrying him, was holding the door open. \n \n \u0027All right,\u0027 Lavendale agreed, \u0027I\u0027ll motor down there to-morrow.\u0027 \n \n ***** \n \n Lavendale was conscious of a queer sensation of unreality as late on the following afternoon he followed the butler across the white-flagged entrance hall of Hookam Court. He felt as though he were an unwilling actor in a play of which the setting was all too perfect. The little party of guests, still in shooting clothes and lounging before the great wood fire, brought into their surroundings a vivid note of flamboyant artificiality. The high walls, with their ecclesiastically-curved frescoes, the row of family portraits, the armour standing in the recesses, even the little local touch afforded by the game-keeper in brown whipcord and gaiters, standing waiting in a distant corner, seemed to him like part of some cinema production in which the men and women were supers and the setting tinsel. \n \n His host\u0027s greeting was all that it should have been. He advanced across the hall with outstretched hand, quietly but sincerely cordial. \n \n \u0027Good man, Lavendale!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027I was delighted to get your telegram.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Very nice of you,\u0027 Lavendale murmured. \u0027I hadn\u0027t any idea of being at a loose end so soon when you were kind enough to ask me.\u0027 \n \n \u0027It couldn\u0027t have happened more fortunately,\u0027 Mr. Anthony Silburn assured him. \u0027I\u0027ve another man coming down to-night, but I\u0027ve room for two more guns. Now let me introduce you to those of your fellow-guests whom you don\u0027t know. Mr. Lavendale—Lady Marsham, Mr. Kindersley, Mr. Barracombe, Sir Julius Marsham, Mr. Henry D. Steinletter.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale bowed, individually to the women and collectively to the men. Lady Marsham, a stout, dark-haired lady with a heavy jaw, made room for him by her side. \n \n \u0027It is quite a treat, Mr. Lavendale,\u0027 she declared, \u0027to see a young man. One feels that he must be either an American or a hopeless invalid. You are an American, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 \n \n Lavendale admitted the fact and rose to welcome his hostess, who was coming down the stairs. She suddenly recognized Lavendale and stopped short. For the first time he was conscious of something which freed him from that sense of being part of a carefully concerted picture. There was something absolutely human, entirely spontaneous in his cousin\u0027s expression as she recognized him. Her fingers gripped the oak banisters, her lips were parted, her eyes were filled with something which was scarcely a welcoming light. It all passed in a moment and she came into the picture naturally and easily. \n \n \u0027My dear Ambrose, how delightful to see you again! Does Tony know? \n \n Lavendale advanced to meet her and took her hands. \n \n \u0027He asked me down for a few days only yesterday, when I met him in town, and I wired to say that I was coming to-day. I am afraid I didn\u0027t give him a chance to turn me down, but I meant to say, although he hasn\u0027t given me an opportunity yet, that if it\u0027s at all inconvenient I could go on to Norwich and look up some friends near there. \n \n For a single moment she hesitated. Her little laugh was not altogether natural. Again Lavendale had a queer fancy that there was a leaven of insincerity in her welcome—that if it had been possible she would even have sent him away. \n \n \u0027Don\u0027t be foolish, Ambrose. Of course we are delighted. I see you people have had tea,\u0027 she went on. \u0027I really couldn\u0027t resist a bath and tea-gown.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And I was much too lazy,\u0027 Lady Marsham yawned, lighting a cigarette. \u0027I shall go up and change early for dinner.\u0027 \n \n Mr. Silburn\u0027s voice was heard from the other end of the hall. He was dismissing the game-keeper with a few parting instructions. \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll have another covering stand at the long wood, Reynolds,\u0027 he was saying. \u0027You can put it on the extreme left, near the old oak. I\u0027ll take that myself, and Mr. Lavendale will shoot from number three. You\u0027ve got your guns, Lavendale?\u0027 he added, strolling up to them. \n \n \u0027They are in the car,\u0027 Lavendale replied, \u0027but I warn you that I haven\u0027t shot for two years.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t think my pheasants will bother you any,\u0027 Mr. Silburn promised him. \u0027Barracombe here finds them on the slow side. We had a very good day to-day—over a thousand head altogether. Sure you won\u0027t have some tea or a whisky-and-soda?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Nothing, thanks.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Then I\u0027ll show you your rooms,\u0027 his host continued, \u0027if you\u0027ll come this way.\u0027 \n \n Lydia Silburn, who had been standing a little irresolutely on the other side of the round tea-table, suddenly turned towards her husband. \n \n \u0027Why didn\u0027t you tell me, Tony, that Ambrose was coming?\u0027 she inquired. \n \n \u0027I meant to,\u0027 her husband admitted. \u0027As it happens, however, I haven\u0027t seen much of you to-day, have I? Come along, young fellow. Did you bring a servant, by-the-by? No? Well, I\u0027ve quite a smart second boy who can look after you. We dine at eight. And, Lavendale, just one word,\u0027 he concluded, as he glanced around the spacious rooms into which he had ushered his guest, \u0027we have a sort of unwritten rule to which every one subscribes here. It saves so much unpleasant argument on a subject where our opinions are a little divided. We don\u0027t mention the war until half-past ten.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Very sound,\u0027 Lavendale remarked, \u0027but why half-past ten?\u0027 \n \n \u0027After dinner,\u0027 Mr. Silburn promised, \u0027I will explain that to you. We have a little conversazione sometimes—but just wait.\u0027 ... \n \n Again, an hour or so later, when Lavendale stood once more in the hall talking to one or two of the men, whilst a footman was passing round cock-tails upon a tray, he felt oppressed by that curious sense of unreality. He took himself severely to task for it. He told himself that it must lie simply in the innate incongruity of this occupation of a ducal home by an American millionaire. In every other respect the men and women were obviously fitting figures. One or two of them were even known to him by reputation. The whole atmosphere of their conversation was natural and spontaneous. And then, as he turned resolutely to continue a discussion about wild pheasants with Barracombe—Barracombe, whom he knew well to be a great scientific traveller, a man of distinction—it was then that the climax came, the dramatic note which alone was needed to convince him of the spuriousness of his surroundings. He had turned his head quite naturally towards the broad, western corridor on hearing the soft rustling of a woman\u0027s skirts—and he talked no more of wild pheasants! It was Suzanne, in a black evening gown and carrying a handful of pink roses in her hand, who was coming slowly across the hall. \n \n \u0027Suzanne! Miss de Freyne!\u0027 he exclaimed, taking a quick step forward. \n \n He was conscious of many things in those few seconds, conscious of his host\u0027s strenuous regard, of Suzanne\u0027s unnatural pallor, of the warning in her eyes. His rush of joy at seeing her, however, was all-conquering. He took her hands in his and held them tightly. \n \n \u0027And to think that no one told me you were here!\u0027 he exclaimed. \n \n There was a moment\u0027s strained silence. Then a cold wave of doubt, a premonition of evil, suddenly chilled him. In the background he had caught a glimpse of a peculiar smile upon his host\u0027s lips, and again there was the warning in Suzanne\u0027s eyes. \n \n \u0027I have been down in the neighbourhood for several days,\u0027 she told him. \u0027It is rather a coincidence, is it not?\u0027 \n \n Anthony Silburn, who had remained all the time within earshot, strolled over towards them. \n \n \u0027So you young people have discovered one another,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027The gong at last!\u0027 he added, with a little burst of enthusiasm. \u0027Lavendale, as it is your first evening, will you take Lydia in? Miss de Freyne, I am going to give myself the happiness to-night.\u0027 \n \n He held out his arm and led Suzanne away. Lavendale loitered behind with his cousin. \n \n \u0027Lydia,\u0027 he whispered, as they passed into the great dining-room, \u0027how long has Miss de Freyne been here?\u0027 \n \n \u0027In this house since the day before yesterday,\u0027 she answered. \u0027She was staying before at the Hookam Arms, down in the village.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Say, is there anything wrong about this place?\u0027 he asked. \u0027I don\u0027t know what it is, but I feel as though I\u0027d come into some sort of a theatrical performance. I suppose you are all alive, aren\u0027t you? That really is Barracombe, the traveller, and old Steinletter?\u0027 \n \n His tone had been one of half banter, but her reply made him suddenly serious. \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t know, Ambrose,\u0027 she confessed nervously. \u0027Sometimes I feel like that myself. Don\u0027t talk too loudly.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale became a watcher through the progress of the wonderfully served meal. The servants, in a way, were all of the usual type, obviously well-trained and attentive. The dining-room at Hookam had been built out by a favourite of one of the Georges almost in the form of a pagoda, and under the high, domed roof, listening to the somewhat stereotyped conversation of those strangely-assorted guests, Lavendale became slowly conscious of a new sensation, the sensation of restriction. It was hard to believe that outside lay the park; that in the morning he would be wandering about, free to come and go as he pleased; that in the garage was his own car, and a couple of miles away across the park, the road to London. He tried to talk lightly to Lydia of their relatives and friends in America, but he found her distraite and depressed. Dinner was no sooner over, however, than he made a bold attempt to dissipate some of his presentiments. \n \n \u0027Can I use the telephone, Silburn?\u0027 he asked. \n \n \u0027With pleasure, my dear boy,\u0027 was the unhesitating reply. \u0027You\u0027ll find an instrument this way.\u0027 \n \n They were all crossing the hall. The men and the women were to smoke and take their coffee together. Silburn led his young guest into a small waiting-room, comfortably furnished. On a table in the middle of the apartment was a telephone instrument and a book of subscribers. Lavendale took up the receiver. \n \n \u0027Can you get through to London?\u0027 he asked. \n \n \u0027Sorry, sir, the line is engaged,\u0027 the operator regretted. \n \n \u0027Will it be free presently?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll ring up as soon as we can get through. What number?\u0027 \n \n Lavendale gave the number of his own rooms and rejoined the little group in the hall. He found Barracombe on one side of Suzanne and his host on the other, but he drew a chair as near to her as he could. \n \n \u0027Get through all right?\u0027 Silburn inquired. \n \n \u0027I didn\u0027t get through anywhere,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027The line was engaged.\u0027 \n \n \u0027We\u0027ve a lot of soldiers down here,\u0027 Mr. Silburn explained. \u0027They are always commandeering the line for military purposes.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You seem to get plenty of messages,\u0027 Lavendale remarked, as a servant for the third or fourth time brought a slip of folded paper to his master. \n \n Silburn smiled. \n \n \u0027I have a private line,\u0027 he announced. \u0027Sorry I can\u0027t ask you to use it, but I have promised the military here that no one else save myself shall communicate by means of it. Are you a bridger, Lavendale?\u0027 \n \n Lavendale excused himself, but gained nothing, for Suzanne was almost forced into the game by her host. He wandered about the hall, glancing up at the pictures. Then he went back to the telephone room. \n \n \u0027Line\u0027s still engaged, sir,\u0027 was the laconic reply to his inquiry. \n \n Lavendale strolled back. He wandered uneasily about the hall for a time and then approached the great front door. \n \n \u0027Think I\u0027ll have a look at the night,\u0027 he remarked, with his hand upon the bolt. \n \n The servant who was standing by, intervened. \n \n \u0027I beg your pardon, sir,\u0027 he said, \u0027we are not allowed to open the front door after dusk. The military have complained so much about the lights.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Show me another way out from the back, then?\u0027 Lavendale persisted. \n \n \u0027No one is allowed to leave the house at all until morning,\u0027 the man told him. \n \n Lavendale turned slowly round towards the bridge-table. \n \n \u0027Silburn,\u0027 he asked, \u0027are we prisoners?\u0027 \n \n \u0027My dear fellow,\u0027 his host replied, dealing out a hand, \u0027it is not I who am to blame, but the English military authorities. Look how closely-curtained we are everywhere. You will find double blinds in every room in the house. Yet even that has not been enough to satisfy them. I have had to promise that no members of my household shall even open a door after dark. \"Defence of the Realm Act\" they call it, I think.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale turned a little discontentedly away. It was difficult to protest further, but he was not in the least satisfied that Silburn\u0027s explanation was a genuine one. He talked for a few moments to several of the other guests and then drew a low chair up close to Suzanne. It was evident to him, watching her closely, that she was playing under great tension. More than ever he was convinced that something was wrong. With an excuse about fetching some cigarettes of a particular brand, he made up to his room and searched in his dressing-case. Within a few minutes he found himself face to face with a very grim reality. The revolver which he carried always with him had been removed! ... \n \n Lavendale, with small hopes of any success, called once more at the telephone room before he rejoined the little party. The reply was almost brusque. \n \n \u0027Line blocked. No chance of getting through to London to-night.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Can I ring up Norwich?\u0027 Lavendale asked, with a sudden inspiration. \n \n \u0027Line to Norwich engaged,\u0027 was the reply. \n \n \u0027Is there anywhere I can speak to?\u0027 Lavendale persisted. \u0027Is there any number upon the exchange I can be connected with?\u0027 \n \n There was no reply. He rang again and tapped the wire. There was still silence. Then he replaced the receiver upon the instrument and stood for a moment in the little room, thinking. There was no doubt but that he had simply followed Suzanne into a trap. He rapidly reviewed in his memory the guests. Lady Marsham, it was well known, had been educated in Berlin and had German relatives. Barracombe wore an order conferred upon him by the Kaiser. Steinletter belonged to the greatest German-American banking firm in the world. Kindersley\u0027s daughter had married an Austrian prince. Suzanne had succeeded, then, in this last quest of hers, a success which, although inadvertently, he might be said to share. They had in all probability discovered the headquarters of the great Teutonic espionage system in England. How was it going to profit them? His mind rapidly reviewed the situation. They were prisoners—of that he was certain—yet to what extent? How far was Silburn prepared to go? It was, after all, rather an opera-bouffe sort of trap. If they were caught, there was still the question of silencing them. Then he thought of that abstracted revolver, and a queer little wave of apprehension, not for himself but for Suzanne, suddenly chilled him. \n \n He made his way back into the hall. The rubber was just over and he leaned boldly over the chair in which Suzanne was seated. \n \n \u0027Come and talk to me for a few minutes,\u0027 he begged. \n \n She hesitated. Mr. Silburn, who was playing idly with the cards, glanced at the clock and back again. \n \n \u0027At half-past ten,\u0027 he announced, \u0027in ten minutes, that is to say, we all meet in the cloister room. It is a queer custom, perhaps, but my guests have been kind in conforming to it.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Prayers?\u0027 Lavendale inquired. \n \n \u0027Not a bad name for our few minutes\u0027 serious diversion,\u0027 Mr. Silburn remarked dryly. \n \n Lavendale led Suzanne towards a couch at the further end of the hall. He laid his hand upon hers and found it as cold as ice. \n \n \u0027Suzanne,\u0027 he said quietly, \u0027are we in a trap?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I believe we are,\u0027 she answered. \u0027It is entirely my fault. I have never been so foolish before in my life. I have always had people behind me who have known my whereabouts and who could come to the rescue, if necessary. This time I told no one. I was selfish. I wanted the whole credit. But tell me of yourself—how you came here?\u0027 \n \n \u0027It was just the merest chance,\u0027 he replied. \u0027Silburn had asked me to shoot here, and then you half told me where you were, over the telephone. I think that the rest must have been instinct. You haven\u0027t told me yet, though, how you found your way here?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I was down at the village,\u0027 she said. \u0027I followed Mr. Steinletter here. I had a special permit, a military pass. I was supposed to be related to one of the officers quartered at the inn. I made a few inquiries about this place, which increased my suspicions. Then I met Mrs. Silburn outside the lodge gates. She was with the Colonel in command here and they stopped to speak to the officer I was with. She was delightful and asked me to call. I was only too glad to have a chance of obtaining the entrée to the house. They made me send for my clothes, to spend the night. That was two days ago. Since then I have tried in vain to get away.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Let me understand what you mean by trying to get away?\u0027 he begged. \u0027Surely you could ask for a car to take you to the station?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I have done so three times,\u0027 she replied, \u0027always with the same result. They assure me that every car in the garage has been requisitioned by the Government. I go to that dummy telephone—the exchange is in the house, you know—and of course nothing happens. If I start out to walk, I am shadowed by one of the men-servants, and, as you know, it is two miles before one reaches the road.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Well, there isn\u0027t much they can do with us, dear,\u0027 Lavendale assured her coolly. \u0027Tell me now, have you made any actual discovery?\u0027 \n \n \u0027There is a private telegraph and telephone exchange here in the place,\u0027 she said, \u0027and Mr. Silburn gets messages every few hours. There are people always coming and going, all people of the same class. There is not the slightest doubt that this is the place for which we have searched. Ambrose, if only we could stretch out the net now, at this moment, we could make a great haul.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Instead of which,\u0027 he remarked grimly, \u0027we seem to be in the meshes ourselves!\u0027 \n \n \u0027Tell me,\u0027 she begged, \u0027does any one know that you were coming here?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I told Elwell—Major Elwell,\u0027 Lavendale replied, with a suddenly inspired flash of memory. \u0027I told him why I was coming here, too.\u0027 \n \n She clutched at his arm. Then suddenly she looked down. \u0027They are watching us,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Ambrose, that may save us yet if only he comes in time!\u0027 \n \n \u0027In time for what?\u0027 Lavendale answered cheerfully. \u0027I can\u0027t look upon this as very serious, dear. Why, Lydia Silburn is my own cousin.\u0027 \n \n \u0027She is our only hope,\u0027 Suzanne declared. \u0027As for the rest, I have grown to suspect every one of them.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What does this half-past ten business mean?\u0027 he asked. \n \n She shook her head. \n \n \u0027At half-past ten they all go into what they call the cloister room,\u0027 she said. \u0027As yet I have not been invited there, but I have an idea that to-night we are both to be present. Yes, here comes Mr. Silburn.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Now, you young people,\u0027 their host observed pleasantly, \u0027we are going to let you into a few secrets. This way.\u0027 \n \n They both rose. The others were crossing the hall towards the eastern corridor. Mr. Silburn drew Suzanne\u0027s arm through his. As they walked his face became more serious. Lavendale had a wild idea, for a moment, of snatching Suzanne away, opening the front door by force and clamouring for freedom. Then he remembered the two miles to the lodge gate and shrugged his shoulders. \n \n \u0027It\u0027s rather a queer apartment into which I am going to take you,\u0027 Mr. Silburn explained, \u0027a crazy sort of place, really, but to us Americans this sort of room, I must confess, appeals some. Allow me, Miss de Freyne.\u0027 \n \n He motioned them both to precede him. They found themselves in what seemed to be, from the bareness of the walls and the shape of the windows, a small chapel, built on different levels. The larger part of the room, which was below, was wrapped in complete gloom. The smaller part was unfurnished save for a long table, around which was ranged a number of chairs. One by one, the guests seated themselves. Lavendale and Suzanne followed their example as indifferently as possible. Mr. Silburn sat at the head of the table, with Lady Marsham on his right and Mr. Steinletter opposite. There was a certain significance to Lavendale in the fact that his cousin was not present. A somewhat gloomy light was thrown upon the faces of the little company from a heavily-shaded oil lamp suspended by a brass chain from the roof, and, looking around at their mingled expressions, Lavendale for the first time felt a sense of real danger, a thrill of something like fear, not for his own sake but for Suzanne\u0027s. He groped for her hand beneath the table and held the icy-cold fingers tightly. \n \n \u0027Courage, dear,\u0027 he murmured under his breath. \n \n She smiled at him plaintively, and with the fear still lurking in her dark eyes. Then Mr. Silburn leaned forward in his place and tapped upon the table with his forefinger. His voice in the hollow spaces sounded strangely. \n \n \u0027My friends,\u0027 he began, \u0027few words are best. We live, as you all know, from day to day in danger. No such association as ours could continue to exist without hourly peril. So far we have triumphed over the secret service of every country. So far we have carried on our great work without hindrance or suspicion. Those days I am forced to tell you, are passing. The hour of our supreme peril is close at hand. There are two people here present who have guessed our secret. One of them, this young lady upon my left, Miss de Freyne, is here for no other purpose than to spy upon us.\u0027 \n \n Suzanne seemed to have regained her courage. In the moment of trial she was stronger than in the indeterminate hours of suspense. She turned her head towards Silburn. \n \n \u0027What are you all but spies,\u0027 she demanded, \u0027spies of the lowest and most dastardly class? You are here under the shelter of a friendly country to do her all the harm you can, to stab in the dark, to take advantage of your nationality—your American nationality—to pose as an Anglo-Saxon. You abuse the country which shelters you. You call me a spy! Compared with you, all of you, I am the most innocent person who ever breathed.\u0027 \n \n A strange impassivity seemed to be reflected from all the faces of the little gathering. Only in Mr. Kindersley\u0027s face there trembled for a moment some shadow of sympathy. \n \n \u0027You have heard the young lady,\u0027 Mr. Silburn continued calmly. \u0027We come now to her companion. Mr. Lavendale, although an American by birth, has embraced the cause of this country; doubtless,\u0027 he added, with a little satirical bow, \u0027for reasons upon which I will not enlarge. He has become the ally of mademoiselle. We secured his presence here, I admit, by a ruse. My friends, these two people\u0027s knowledge of our secret is fatal to our safety.\u0027 \n \n There was a moment\u0027s silence. Then Lady Marsham leaned back in her chair. \n \n \u0027I propose,\u0027 she said firmly, \u0027that the same steps be taken with these two people as heretofore.\u0027 \n \n There was a little murmur of approval. Only Mr. Kindersley sighed. \n \n \u0027One must remember,\u0027 he observed reflectively, \u0027that it is not only for our own safety—it is for the preservation of a great cause.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale took a cigarette from a box in the centre of the table, and lit it. \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t know what this penalty is that you propose to inflict upon us,\u0027 he remarked, \u0027but I should just like to remind you that you are living in a very highly civilized country, where people do not disappear.\u0027 \n \n \u0027At Hookam,\u0027 Mr. Silburn said calmly, \u0027people have disappeared for the last nine hundred years. Below there, the secret cloisters reach almost to the sea. The cleverest and most astute criminologists who ever breathed might track you to these doors, Lavendale, and search until their hair was grey before they discovered a single trace of you. My servants are mine, body and soul. For my wife\u0027s sake, Lavendale——\u0027 \n \n \u0027Look here,\u0027 Lavendale interrupted, \u0027I am not sure whether you are in earnest or not, but whatever you might be thinking about for me, you couldn\u0027t be such brutes——\u0027 \n \n He stopped short. There was a sudden light in his face. From outside the door they could clearly hear the sound of an angry voice. A little ripple of terrified excitement flashed around the table. Mr. Silburn\u0027s teeth came together with a little click. There was a curious tremor of emotion in his tone. \n \n \u0027Lock the door,\u0027 he ordered Barracombe. \n \n It was too late. In a long travelling ulster, with his cap still in his hand, Major Elwell stood already upon the threshold. Behind him, still protesting, was Lydia Silburn. \n \n \u0027Elwell!\u0027 Lavendale shouted. \u0027Thank God!\u0027 \n \n Major Elwell gazed around at them all through his eye-glass and looked back at the woman by his side. He seemed bewildered. \n \n \u0027What in the name of all that\u0027s holy is this?\u0027 he demanded. \n \n There was a moment\u0027s silence. Lavendale drew a long breath. His arm was stretched out accusingly towards his host. Suddenly the words failed upon his lips. He looked around him, speechless, amazed. It was as though the whole world had gone mad. Mr. Barracombe, from the opposite side of the table, had removed his spectacles from his nose and was wiping the tears from his eyes. Lady Marsham was leaning on one side, doubled up. There was only one common sound everywhere—laughter, irresistible, compelling, unmistakable. Mr. Silburn, taking off his pince-nez and struggling for composure, rose to his feet. \n \n \u0027The sentence of the court upon you two,\u0027 he declared unsteadily, \u0027would have been delivered with more solemnity but for the premature arrival of our friend Jack Elwell. I hereby pronounce it, however, finally and irrevocably. It is this, Ambrose Lavendale—that you offer your arm to Miss de Freyne, that you lead the way in to supper, and that you produce your marriage certificate within three weeks.\u0027 \n \n Almost as he spoke, lights flashed out from the great room below. A long table was laid for supper. There were servants who seemed to appear like magic, with bottles and dishes. Lavendale turned towards Elwell, looked back at his host and finally down at Suzanne. \n \n \u0027Suzanne,\u0027 he exclaimed, \u0027I believe we\u0027re spoofed!\u0027 \n \n She shook her head. There were tears of relief in her eyes, but a delicious curve of laughter upon her lips. \n \n \u0027I do not know the word,\u0027 she admitted, \u0027but I believe it is true.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Lead the way, young fellow,\u0027 Mr. Silburn insisted. \u0027Forgive us, you two, but when we heard of Miss de Freyne down at the village, making inquiries about us—well, you remember I had to leave Harvard for a practical joke!\u0027 \n \n \u0027All the same,\u0027 Lydia Silburn declared from the background, \u0027the sentence of the court is final.\u0027 \n \n They took their places, and the supper party very soon became a much gayer meal than the dinner which had preceded it. Towards its close, Lavendale whispered to Suzanne. \n \n \u0027Dear,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ll have to own up that we haven\u0027t been quite as astute as usual. Perhaps we are getting a little stale. Supposing we take—a holiday?\u0027 \n \n She flashed a wonderful smile up at him. \n \n \u0027It was the sentence of the court,\u0027 she murmured. \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1900/54749.html","bookId":924,"book":{"id":924,"title":"Ambrose Lavendale, Diplomat","description":"简介： It was a few minutes after one o\u0027clockthe busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in London.
