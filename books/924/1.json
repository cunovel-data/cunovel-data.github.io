{"id":36489,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I THE MAN WHO COULD HAVE ENDED THE WAR","content":"It was a few minutes after one o\u0027clock—the busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in London. The usual little throng of Americans, journalists, men of business and loiterers, were occupying their accustomed chairs in one corner of the long, green-carpeted room. Around the bar, would-be customers were crowded three or four deep—many of them stalwart Canadians in khaki, making the most of their three days\u0027 leave, and a thin sprinkling of men about town on their way to lunch in the grill-room adjoining. On the outskirts of the group was a somewhat incongruous figure, a rather under-sized, ill-dressed, bespectacled little man, neither young nor old, colourless, with a stoop which was almost a deformity. His fingers were stained to the tip of his nails as though by chemicals or tobacco juice. He held the glass of vermouth which he had just succeeded in obtaining from the bar, half-way suspended to his lips. He was listening to the conversation around him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The most blackguardly trick that has ever been known in civilized warfare!\u0027 a Canadian officer declared indignantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s put the lid on all pretence of conducting this war decently,\u0027 another assented. \u0027What about the Hague Convention?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The Hague Convention!\u0027 a young journalist from the other side repeated sarcastically. \u0027I should like to know when Germany has ever shown the slightest regard for the Hague Convention or any other agreement which didn\u0027t happen to suit her!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The little man on the outskirts of the group, who had been listening eagerly to the conversation, ventured upon a question. His accent at once betrayed his transatlantic origin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Say, is there anything fresh this morning?\u0027 he inquired. \u0027I haven\u0027t seen the papers yet.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The Canadian glanced down at the speaker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We were talking,\u0027 he said, \u0027about the use of poisonous gases by the Germans. They started pumping them at us yesterday and pretty nearly cleared us out of Ypres.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The effect of this statement upon the little man was, in its way, extraordinary. For a moment he stood with his mouth open, the glass shaking between his fingers, a queer, set expression in his pale face. Then his lips parted and he began to laugh. It was a mirth so obviously ill-timed, so absolutely unaccountable, that they all turned and stared at him. There was no doubt whatever that for some reason or other the news which he had just heard had excited this strange little person almost hysterically. His lips grew further apart, the whole of his face was puckered up in little creases. Then, just as suddenly as his extraordinary impulse towards mirth had come, it seemed to pass away. He drained his glass, set it down on the edge of the counter, and, turning around, walked slowly out of the place. The remarks that followed him were not altogether inaudible and they were distinctly uncomplimentary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027All I could do to keep my toe off the little devil!\u0027 the Canadian exclaimed angrily. \u0027I\u0027d like to take him back with me out into the trenches for a few days!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n A young man who had been talking to an English officer on the outskirts of the group, turned around. He was a tall, well-set-up young man, with a face rather grave for his years and a mouth a little over-firm. He, too, had watched the exit of the stranger half in indignation, half in contempt. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Who was that extraordinary little man?\u0027 he inquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n No one seemed to know. The waiter paused with a tray full of glasses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s staying in the hotel—arrived yesterday from America, sir,\u0027 he announced. \u0027I don\u0027t know his name, but I think he\u0027s a little queer in his head.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The young man set down his glass upon the counter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A person,\u0027 he remarked, \u0027who can laugh at such a ghastly thing, must be either very queer in his head indeed, or——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Or what, Ambrose?\u0027 his companion asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 the other replied thoughtfully. \u0027Well, au revoir, you fellows! I\u0027m going in to lunch. Sure you won\u0027t come with me, Reggie?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sorry, I have to be back in ten minutes,\u0027 the other replied. \u0027See you to-morrow.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Ambrose Lavendale strolled out of the room, crossed the smoke-room and descended into the restaurant. At a table in a remote corner, seated by himself, the little man who had been guilty of such a breach of good-feeling was studying the menu with a waiter by his side. Lavendale watched him for a moment curiously. Then he turned to speak to one of the ma?tres d\u0027h?tel, a short, dark man with a closely-cropped black moustache. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I shan\u0027t want my usual table this morning, Jules,\u0027 he announced. \u0027I am going to sit in that corner.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He indicated a vacant table close to the little man whom he had been watching. The ma?tres d\u0027h?tel bowed and ushered him towards it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Just as you like, Mr. Lavendale,\u0027 he said. \u0027It isn\u0027t often you care about this side of the room, though.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale seated himself at the table he had selected, gave a brief order, and, leaning back, glanced around him. The little man had sent for a newspaper and was reading it eagerly, but for a moment Lavendale\u0027s interest was attracted elsewhere. At the very next table, also alone, also reading a newspaper, was the most striking-looking young woman he had ever seen in his life. Lavendale was neither susceptible nor imaginative. He considered himself a practical, hard-headed person, notwithstanding the fact that he had embraced what was for his country practically a new profession. Nevertheless, he was conscious of what almost amounted to a new interest in life as he studied, a little too eagerly, perhaps, the girl\u0027s features. She was dark, with hair brushed plainly back from a somewhat high and beautifully shaped forehead. Her complexion was pale, her eyes a deep shade of soft brown. Her eyebrows were almost Japanese, fine and silky yet intensely dark. Her mouth, even in repose, seemed full of curves. She appeared to be of medium height and she was undoubtedly graceful, and what made her more interesting still to Lavendale was the fact that, although her manner of doing so was stealthy, she, too, was watching the little man who was now commencing his luncheon. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale, after a few moments\u0027 reflection, adopted the obvious course. He summoned Jules and inquired the young lady\u0027s name. The man was able at once to give him the desired information. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Miss de Freyne, sir,\u0027 he whispered discreetly. \u0027She is a writer, I believe. I am not quite sure,\u0027 the man added, \u0027whether she is not the agent over here of some French dramatists. I have seen her sometimes with theatrical parties.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale nodded and settled down rather ineffectively to his lunch. Before he had finished he had arrived at two conclusions. The first was that Miss de Freyne, although obviously not for the same reason, was as much interested in the stranger as he was; and the second that his first impressions concerning her personality were, if anything, too weak. He ransacked his memory for the names of all the theatrical people whom he knew, and made mental notes of them. It was his firm intention to make her acquaintance before the day was over. Once their eyes met, and, notwithstanding a reasonable amount of savoir faire, for the moment he was almost embarrassed. He found it impossible to glance away, and she returned a regard which he felt in a way was semi-committal, with a queer sort of nonchalant interest in a sense provocative, although it contained nothing of invitation. At the end of the meal Lavendale had come to a decision. He signed his bill, rose from his place and approached the table at which the little man was seated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sir,\u0027 he said, \u0027I am a stranger to you, but I should like, if I may, to ask you a question.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Even in that moment\u0027s pause, when the little man laid down his newspaper and was staring up at his questioner in manifest surprise, Lavendale felt that his proceeding had attracted the strongest interest from the young woman seated only a few feet away. She had leaned ever so slightly forward. A coffee cup with which she had been toying had been noiselessly returned to its saucer. It was genuine interest, this, not curiosity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Say, how\u0027s that?\u0027 the little man exclaimed. \u0027Ask me a question? Why, I don\u0027t know as there\u0027d be any harm in that. I\u0027m not promising that I\u0027ll answer it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I was in the bar a moment ago,\u0027 Lavendale continued, \u0027when they were talking of these poisonous gases which the Germans are using. I heard you ask a question and I heard the answer. You were apparently for the first time informed of this new practice of theirs. Will you tell me why, when you heard of it, you laughed?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The little man nodded his head slowly as though in response to some thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sit down, young fellow,\u0027 he invited. \u0027Are you an American?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am,\u0027 Lavendale admitted. \u0027My name is Ambrose Lavendale and I was attached to the Embassy here until last August.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That so?\u0027 the other replied with some interest. \u0027Well, mine\u0027s Hurn. I don\u0027t know a soul in London and you may be useful to me, so if you like I\u0027ll answer your question. You thought my laugh abominable, I guess?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I did,\u0027 Lavendale assented,—\u0027we all did. I dare say you heard some of the comments that followed you out!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It was a selfish laugh, perhaps,\u0027 the little man continued thoughtfully, \u0027but it was not an inhuman one. Now, sir, I will answer your question. I will tell you what that piece of information which I heard at the bar, and which I find in the paper here, means to me and means to the world. Hold tight, young man. I am going to make a statement which, if you are sensible enough to believe it, will take your breath away. If you don\u0027t, you\u0027ll think I\u0027m a lunatic. Are you ready?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Go ahead,\u0027 Lavendale invited. \u0027I guess my nerves are in pretty good order.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Hurn laid the flat of his hand upon the table and looked upwards at his companion. He spoke very slowly and very distinctly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I can stop the war,\u0027 he declared. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale smiled at him incredulously—the man was mad! \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Really?\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027Well, you\u0027ll be the greatest benefactor the world has ever known, if you can.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The little man, who had arrived at the final stage of his luncheon, helped himself to another pat of butter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t believe me, of course,\u0027 he said, \u0027yet it happens that I am speaking the truth. You are thinking, I guess, that I am a pitifully insignificant little unit in this great city, in this raging world. Yet I have spoken the solid truth. I can stop the war, and, if you like, you can help me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale withdrew his eyes from his new acquaintance\u0027s face for a moment and glanced towards the girl. Something that was almost a smile of mutual understanding flashed between them. Doubtless she had overheard some part of their conversation. Lavendale raised his voice a little in order that she might hear more. He felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought that they were establishing a mutual confidence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll help, of course,\u0027 he promised. \u0027In what direction are your efforts to be made?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The little man paused in the act of drinking a glass of water, squinted at his questioner, and set the tumbler down empty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Wondering what sort of a crank you\u0027ve got hold of, eh?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale began to be impressed. The little man did not look in the least like a lunatic. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s rather a sweeping proposition, yours,\u0027 Lavendale remarked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Everything in the world,\u0027 the other reminded him didactically, \u0027was impossible before it was done. Your help needn\u0027t be very strenuous. I guess there\u0027s some sort of headquarters in London from which this war is run, eh?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s the War Office,\u0027 Lavendale explained. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Know any one there?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, I know a good many soldiers who have jobs there just now.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Then I guess you can help by saving me time. Do you happen to be acquainted with any one in the Ordnance Department?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale reflected for a moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, I know a man there,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027It\u0027s just as well to warn you, though, that they\u0027re absolutely fed up with trying new shells and powder.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The little man smiled—a queer, reflective smile, filled with some quality of self-appreciation which seemed at once to lift him above the whole world of crazy inventors. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Your friend there now,\u0027 he asked, \u0027or will he be taking his British two hours for lunch?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He never leaves the building after he gets there in the morning,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Daniel H. Hurn signed his bill and laid down an insignificant tip. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You through with your luncheon?\u0027 he inquired. \u0027Right! Then what about taking me along and letting me have a word with your friend?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t mind,\u0027 Lavendale agreed, a little doubtfully, \u0027but he hasn\u0027t very much influence.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Again the other smiled, and again Lavendale was impressed by that mysterious contortion. He glanced towards the adjoining table. The girl was still watching them closely. Jules, whom she had apparently just summoned, was standing by her side, and Lavendale was convinced that the questions which she was obviously asking, referred to him. He left the room with reluctance and followed his companion through the hall and into a taxi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not sure whether I told you,\u0027 the latter remarked, as he seated himself, \u0027that my name is Hurn—Daniel H. Hurn—and I come from way out west.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Glad to meet you, Mr. Hurn,\u0027 Lavendale murmured mechanically. \u0027You are not taking anything with you to show the people at the War Office, then?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Hurn shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not necessary,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Bring me face to face with a live man—that\u0027s all I need, that\u0027s all you need to end the war.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am an American,\u0027 Lavendale reminded him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Hurn glanced at his companion curiously. Lavendale, dressed by an English tailor and at home in most of the capitals of Europe, was an unfamiliar type. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t have thought it,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027This the place?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale nodded and paid for the taxi without any protest from his companion, whom he piloted down many corridors until they reached a room in the rear of the building. A boy scout guarded the door. He stood on one side to let Lavendale pass, but glanced at his companion questioningly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Would you mind waiting here just for a moment?\u0027 Lavendale suggested. \u0027My friend is in this room, working with several other men. It would be better for me to have a word with him first.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sure!\u0027 the other agreed. \u0027You run the show. I\u0027ll wait.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale entered the apartment and approached the desk before which his friend was sitting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hullo, Reggie!\u0027 he exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n The young man, who was hard at work, looked up from a sheaf of papers and held out his left hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027How are you, Ambrose? Sit down by the side of me, if you want to talk. We\u0027re up to the eyes here.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale leaned over the desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look here, old chap,\u0027 he went on, \u0027I\u0027ve come on a sort of fool\u0027s errand, perhaps. I\u0027ve got a little American outside. He\u0027s a most unholy-looking object, but he wants a word with some one in the Ordnance Department.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Merrill shook his head reproachfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is this quite fair?\u0027 he protested. \u0027We\u0027ve had our morning dose of cranks already.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 Lavendale said, \u0027but you\u0027ve got to deal with one more.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Know anything about him?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not a thing,\u0027 Lavendale admitted. \u0027I\u0027ve talked to him for five minutes, and I have just an idea that you ought to hear what he has to say.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Merrill laid down a paperweight upon his documents. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look here, old fellow,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027ll take your little pal round to Bembridge, if you say the word, but I warn you, he is as fed up as I am and he\u0027ll be pretty short with him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t think my man was sensitive,\u0027 Lavendale observed. \u0027Anyhow, my trouble\u0027s over if you\u0027ll do that.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Merrill sighed and closed his desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This way, then.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They passed out of the room to where Mr. Daniel H. Hurn was waiting. Merrill seemed a little taken aback as Lavendale briefly introduced them, and his glance towards his friend was significant. However, he led them both down the corridor and knocked at a door at the further end. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is the General disengaged?\u0027 he asked the orderly who opened it. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were immediately ushered in. Two clerks were seated at a great round table, apparently copying plans. There were models in the room of every form of modern warfare. A tall, thin man in the uniform of a General, was examining some new pattern of hand grenade as they entered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sir,\u0027 Merrill began, addressing him apologetically, \u0027my friend here, Mr. Ambrose Lavendale, who was in the American Embassy for some time, has brought Mr. Daniel Hurn of Chicago to have a word with you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The General dropped his eyeglass and sighed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027An invention?\u0027 he asked patiently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Something of the sort,\u0027 Mr. Hurn admitted briskly. \u0027Do I understand that you are a General in the British Army?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am, sir,\u0027 General Bembridge admitted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Very well, then,\u0027 Mr. Hurn proceeded, \u0027I am here to tell you this—I can end your war. When you\u0027re through with smiling at me, you\u0027ll probably say \u0027Prove it.\u0027 I will prove it. There\u0027s a row of taxicabs down below. Take me outside this city of yours to where there\u0027s a garden and a field beyond. Afterwards we\u0027ll talk business. You\u0027ll want to, right enough. It\u0027ll take about an hour of your time—and I can end the war!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a moment\u0027s silence. The two clerks who had been writing at the table, had turned around. General Bembridge was looking a little curiously at his unusual visitor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Hurn,\u0027 he said, \u0027I will be frank with you. The average number of visitors who present themselves here during the day with devices which will end the war, is twenty. To-day that average has been exceeded. I have already spoken to twenty-four. You make, you see, the twenty-fifth. If we were to go out in taxicabs and watch experiments with every one of them——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Pshaw! I\u0027m not one of those cranks,\u0027 Mr. Hurn interrupted. \u0027Read this.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He handed a half sheet of notepaper across to the General, who adjusted his eyeglass and read. The heading at the top of the notepaper was \u0027The Chicago School of Chemical Research\u0027 and its contents were brief: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Daniel H. Hurn is a distinguished member of this society. We recommend the attention of the British War Office to any suggestion he may make.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Here\u0027s another,\u0027 Mr. Hurn went on. \u0027This is from the greatest firm of steel producers in the world—kind of personal.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n General Bembridge glanced at the historic name which recommended Mr. Hurn to the consideration of the Government. Then he sighed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am going to-morrow morning at ten o\u0027clock,\u0027 he said, \u0027to inspect a battery at Hatton Park, three miles from Hatfield, on the road to Baldock. You can meet me at the lodge gate at a quarter to ten and I will give you a quarter of an hour.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This afternoon would have been better,\u0027 Mr. Hurn observed, buttoning up the letters in his coat, \u0027but to-morrow morning it shall be.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The General waved them away. Merrill glanced curiously at the American as the three men walked down the corridor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Those letters did the trick,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027Forgive me if I hurry, Lavendale. Don\u0027t let your friend be a minute late to-morrow morning or he\u0027ll lose his chance.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll see to that,\u0027 Mr. Hurn promised. \u0027Guess I can hire some sort of an automobile to take me out there. Good morning, Captain Merrill,\u0027 he added, by way of parting salute, holding out his curiously stained hand. \u0027I am much obliged to you for your help, and you can sleep to-night feeling you\u0027ve done more than any man in this great building to save your country.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Merrill winked at Lavendale as he disappeared within his room. The latter, with the inventor by his side, stepped out into the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027About going down there to-morrow morning——\u0027 he began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Young man,\u0027 Mr. Hurn interrupted impressively, \u0027you\u0027ve done your best for me and it\u0027s only right you should have your reward. You may accompany me to this place, wherever it is.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale laughed softly, a laugh which his companion absolutely failed to understand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he agreed, \u0027I\u0027ll take you down in my car. I\u0027ll be at the hotel at nine o\u0027clock.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027At five minutes to ten, if the General is punctual,\u0027 Mr. Hurn promised, \u0027you shall see the most wonderful sight you have ever witnessed in your life.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n II \\n\\n \\n\\n Punctually at nine o\u0027clock on the following morning, Lavendale brought his car to a standstill before the front door of the Milan Hotel. Mr. Hurn, looking, if possible, shabbier and more insignificant than ever, was waiting under the portico. He clambered at once to the seat by Lavendale\u0027s side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t you any apparatus to bring, or anything?\u0027 the latter inquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Hurn smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not a darned thing!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale was puzzled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You mean you\u0027re ready to start with your experiment, just as you are, like this?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sure!\u0027 the little man answered, \u0027and you\u0027d better get her going.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They started off in silence. Once more Lavendale, as he glanced at the shabby little object by his side, began to lose confidence. As they swung round into Golder\u0027s Green he spoke again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What sort of a show are you going to give us?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Hurn glanced at his watch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll know inside of an hour,\u0027 he replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale frowned. His protégé\u0027s appearance that morning was certainly not prepossessing. His collar showed distinct traces of its vicissitudes upon the previous day. His ugly, discoloured hands were ungloved; his boots were of some dull, indescribable material which seemed to have escaped the attentions of the valet; his flannel shirt was of the style and pattern displayed in Strand establishments which cater for the un?sthetic. He had discarded his hat for a black cloth cap and he had developed a habit of muttering to himself. Lavendale pressed the accelerator of his car and increased its pace. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I suppose I\u0027ve made a fool of myself,\u0027 he muttered. \\n\\n \\n\\n They reached the open country and drew up in due time before the lodge gates of what seemed to be a very large estate. There was no sign as yet of the General. Mr. Hurn descended briskly and at once embarked upon a survey of the neighbourhood. Lavendale lit a cigarette and paused to watch the approach of a great limousine car rushing up the hill. It passed them in a cloud of dust,—he stood staring after it. Notwithstanding the closed windows, he had caught a glimpse of a face, of eyes gazing with strained intentness out on to his side of the road—the face of a woman convulsed with urgency—the woman who had played such queer havoc with his thoughts. Almost at the same moment there was a rasping voice in his ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Say, Mr. Lavendale, there\u0027s just one thing I ought to have warned you people about, you don\u0027t want any spectators to this show. There ain\u0027t no one on this earth has seen what you are going to see.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale was conscious of a queer flash of premonition. They three—the girl, the crazy little American and he himself—at this critical moment seemed to have come once more together. What was the girl doing out here? Could her appearance really be fortuitous? The little man\u0027s warning became automatically associated with this unexpected glimpse of her. Then, with a returning impulse of sanity, Lavendale brushed his suspicions on one side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There\u0027ll only be farm labourers within sight, anyway,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027You see, no one could have known that we were coming here.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That may be so or it mayn\u0027t,\u0027 Mr. Hurn replied dryly. \u0027Anyway, I guess this is the boss coming along.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n An open touring car, driven by a man in khaki, drew up at the lodge gate. General Bembridge descended briskly and came towards them, followed by Captain Merrill. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Glad to see you are punctual, Mr. Hurn,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now, if you please, I am at your disposal for a quarter of an hour. What is it that you have brought to show me?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s all right, General,\u0027 Mr. Hurn replied affably. \u0027You don\u0027t need to worry. I\u0027ve been taking my fixings round here. Just step this way.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He shambled along across the turf. The others followed him, the General walking by Lavendale\u0027s side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hasn\u0027t your friend brought any apparatus to show us?\u0027 he inquired irritably. \u0027What\u0027s he going to do?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Heaven knows, sir!\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027He has told me nothing. If it weren\u0027t for those letters he showed you, I should have thought he was a lunatic.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Hurn assembled the little party about twenty-five yards ahead of a fringe of trees which bordered the road-side and terminated after a slight break in a compact little spinney. He turned to Captain Merrill. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Say, young man,\u0027 he suggested, \u0027you just hop round the other side and make sure there\u0027s no one about.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Merrill, in obedience to a glance from the General, hurried off. The latter turned towards Mr. Hurn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are leaving us very much in the dark, sir, he remarked. \u0027What is it that you propose to attempt?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I propose to accomplish on a small scale,\u0027 Mr. Hurn said grandiloquently, \u0027a work of destruction which you can repeat upon any scale you choose. See here.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n With the utmost solemnity he drew from his pocket a schoolboy\u0027s ordinary catapult and a pill-box. From the latter he selected a pellet a little smaller than a marble. He fitted it carefully into the back of the catapult. Captain Merrill, who had completed his tour of the spinney, returned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There is no one about, sir,\u0027 he announced. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Hurn had suddenly the air of a man who attempts great deeds. His attitude, as he stepped forward, was almost theatrical. The General had become very stern and was obviously annoyed. Lavendale\u0027s heart was sinking fast. He was already trying to think out some form of apology for his share in what he felt had developed into a ridiculous fiasco. Nevertheless, their eyes were all riveted upon the strange little figure a few feet in front of them. Slowly he drew back the elastic of the catapult and discharged the pellet. It struck a tree inside the spinney and there was immediately a curious report, which sounded more like a slow muttering of human pain than an ordinary detonation. Mr. Hurn pointed towards the spinney. There were great things in his attitude and in his gesture. A queer, very faint, grey smoke seemed to be stealing through the place. There was a sound like the splitting of branches amongst the trees, the shrill death cries of terrified animals. The General would have moved forward, but Mr. Hurn caught him by the belt. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Stay where you are, all of you,\u0027 he ordered. \u0027The place ain\u0027t safe yet.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The wonder began to grow upon them. The various shades of green in the spinney seemed suddenly, before their eyes, to change into a universal smoke-coloured ashen-grey. Without any cause that they could see, the bark began to fall away from many of the trees, as though unseen hands were engaged in some gruesome task of devastation. The little party stood there, spellbound, watching this mysterious cataclysm. Mr. Hurn glanced at his watch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You can follow me now,\u0027 he directed. \u0027With this strong westerly wind you won\u0027t need respirators, but breathe as quietly as you can.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They followed him to the edge of the spinney. There was not one of them who was not absolutely dumbfounded. Every shred of colour had passed from the foliage, the undergrowth and the hedges. Flowers and weeds, every living thing, were the same ashen colour. The ground on which their footsteps fell broke away as though the life had been sapped from it. There were two rabbits, a dead cock pheasant, the glory of his plumage turned into a sickly grey, and a dozen smaller birds, all of the same ashen shade. Lavendale kicked one of them. It crumbled into pieces as though it were the fossil of some creature a thousand years old. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The pellet which I discharged from the catapult,\u0027 Mr. Hurn announced, in his queer, squeaky voice, \u0027contained two grains of my preparation. Shells can be made to contain a thousand grains. I reckon that this spinney is eighty yards in area. I will guarantee to you that within that eighty yards there is not alive, at the present moment, any bird or insect or animal of any kind or description. Just as they have died, so would have any human being who had been within this area, have passed away. The rest is a matter of the multiplication table.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But will your invention bear the shock of being fired from a gun?\u0027 the General asked eagerly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That is all all arranged for,\u0027 Mr. Hurn replied. \u0027I have some trial shells here. The powder, which is my invention, is of two sorts, separated in the shell by a partition. They are absolutely harmless until concussion breaks down that division. This little matter,\u0027 he added, waving his hand upon that scene of hideous desolation, \u0027is like the bite of a flea. A dozen boys with catapults could destroy a division. With two batteries of guns, General, you could destroy ten miles of trenches and a hundred thousand men.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They walked around the spinney, still a little dazed with the wonder of it. Suddenly Lavendale gave a little cry. Out in the field on the other side lay the motionless body of a woman. They all hurried towards it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I thought you came round here, Merrill!\u0027 the General exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I did, sir,\u0027 the young officer replied. \u0027There wasn\u0027t a soul in sight.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale was the first to reach the prostrate figure. Almost before he stooped to gaze into her face, he recognized her. There were little flecks of grey upon her dress and she was ghastly pale. Her eyes, however, were open, and she was struggling helplessly to move. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am all right,\u0027 she assured them feebly. \u0027Has any one—any brandy?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She tried to sit up, but she was obviously on the point of collapse. Mr. Hurn pushed his way to her side. From another pill-box which he had withdrawn from his pocket, he took out a small pellet and forced it unceremoniously through her teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I invented an antidote whilst I was about it,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Had to keep on taking it myself when I was experimenting. She\u0027s only got a touch of it. She\u0027ll be all right in five minutes. What I should like to know is,\u0027 he concluded suspiciously, \u0027what the devil she was doing here, any way.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The recovery of the young lady was almost magical. She first sat up. Then, with the help of Lavendale\u0027s hand, she rose easily to her feet. She pointed to the spinney. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What on earth is this awful thing?\u0027 she faltered. \\n\\n \\n\\n No one spoke for a minute. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What were you doing round here, young lady?\u0027 Mr. Hurn asked bluntly. \\n\\n \\n\\n She looked at him with her big, innocent eyes as though surprised. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I was motoring along the road,\u0027 she explained, \u0027when I saw you stop,\u0027 she went on, turning towards the General. \u0027I remembered that I had heard there was to be a review here. I thought I might see something of it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 Merrill suggested, \u0027the young lady will give us her name and address?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She raised her eyebrows slightly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But willingly,\u0027 she answered. \u0027I am Miss Suzanne de Freyne, and my address is at the Milan Court. I haven\u0027t done anything wrong, have I?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nothing at all,\u0027 Lavendale assured her hastily. \u0027It\u0027s we who feel guilty.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But what does it all mean?\u0027 she demanded, a little pathetically. \u0027I was just walking across the field when suddenly that happened. I felt as though all the strength were going out of my body. I didn\u0027t exactly suffocate, but it was just as though I was swallowing something which stopped in my throat.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Capital!\u0027 Mr. Hurn exclaimed, his face beaming. \u0027Most interesting! Perhaps, after all,\u0027 he went on complacently, \u0027if we may take it for granted that the young lady\u0027s presence is entirely accidental, her experience is not without some interest to us.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But will no one tell me what it means?\u0027 she persisted. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a silence. Lavendale was suddenly oppressed by a queer foreboding. The General took Miss de Freyne courteously by the arm and led her on one side. He pointed with his riding whip to the gate where the limousine was standing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Young lady,\u0027 he said, \u0027Captain Merrill here will take you back to your car. You will confer a great obligation upon every one here, and upon your country, if you allow this little incident to pass from your mind.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She laughed softly. Her eyes seemed to be seeking for something in Lavendale\u0027s face which she failed to find. Then she turned away with a shrug of the shoulders and glanced up at Captain Merrill. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am not a prisoner, am I?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Let me assure you all,\u0027 she declared, with a little wave of farewell, \u0027that I never want to think of this hateful spot again.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They watched her pass through the gate and enter the car which was standing in the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Does any one know her?\u0027 the General inquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027She was at the next table to Mr. Hurn here when I spoke to him at the Milan,\u0027 Lavendale observed thoughtfully. \u0027She was listening to our conversation. It may be a coincidence, but it seems strange that she should have been on our heels just at this particular moment.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The General passed his arm through Mr. Hurn\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The Intelligence Department shall make a few inquiries,\u0027 he promised. \u0027As for you, my dear sir, our positions are now reversed. My time is yours. I will find another opportunity to inspect these troops. Will you return with me to the War Office at once?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Right away,\u0027 Mr. Hurn assented. \u0027And, General,\u0027 he went on, swaggering a little as he shambled along by the side of the tall, alert, military figure—queerest contrast in the world—\u0027give me a factory—one of your ordinary factories will do, all your ordinary appliances will do, but give me control of it for one month and you can invite me to Berlin to the peace signing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n \\n\\n At about half-past eight that evening, after having waited about for some time in the hall of the Milan Grill-room, Lavendale handed his coat and hat to the vestiaire and passed into the crowded restaurant. A young man of excellent poise and balance, he was almost bewildered at his own sensations as he elbowed his way through the throng of waiters and passers-by. At the corner of the glass screen he paused. The girl was there, seated at the same table, with a newspaper propped up in front of her. Her black hair seemed glossier than ever; her face, unshadowed by any hat, a little more pallid and forceful. A fur coat had fallen back from her white shoulders. She seemed to be wholly absorbed in the paper in front of her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A table, monsieur?\u0027 a soft voice murmured at his elbow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale shook off his abstraction and glanced reluctantly away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am dining with Mr. Hurn, Jules,\u0027 he replied. \u0027He said eight o\u0027clock, but I can\u0027t see anything of him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Jules pointed to a table close at hand, evidently reserved for two people. There were hors d\u0027oeuvres waiting and a bottle of wine upon the ice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Hurn ordered dinner for eight o\u0027clock punctually, sir,\u0027 he announced. \u0027I have been expecting him in for some time.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl, as though attracted by their voices, had raised her eyes. She looked towards the unoccupied table by the side of which Jules was standing. The three of them for a moment seemed to have concentrated their regard upon the same spot, and Lavendale was conscious of a queer little emotion, an unanalyzable foreboding. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The gentleman ordered a very excellent dinner,\u0027 Jules observed. \u0027I have already sent back the cocktails twice.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale glanced at the clock. Almost at the same time his eyes met the girl\u0027s. There was a quiver of recognition in her face. He took instant advantage of it and moved towards her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are quite recovered, I trust, Miss de Freyne?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She raised her eyes to his. Again he felt that sense of baffling impenetrability. It was impossible even to know whether she appreciated or resented his question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am quite recovered, thank you,\u0027 she said. \u0027You have seen nothing more of our queer little friend?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nothing at all,\u0027 she told him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He invited me to dine with him,\u0027 Lavendale explained, \u0027at eight o\u0027clock punctually. I have been waiting outside for nearly half an hour.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She glanced at the clock and Lavendale, with a little bow, passed on. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Perhaps he meant me to go up to his room,\u0027 he remarked, addressing Jules. \u0027Do you know his number?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Eighty-nine in the Court, sir,\u0027 the man replied. \u0027Shall I send up?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll go myself,\u0027 Lavendale decided. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jules bowed and, although Lavendale did not glance around, he felt that the girl\u0027s eyes as well as the man\u0027s followed him to the door. He rang for the lift and ascended to the fourth floor, made his way down the corridor and paused before number eighty-nine. He knocked at the door—there was no reply. Then he tried the handle, which yielded at once to his touch. Inside all was darkness. He turned on the electric light and pushed open the door of the sitting-room just in front. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Hurn!\u0027 he exclaimed, raising his voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was still no reply,—a strange, brooding silence which seemed to possess subtle qualities of mystery and apprehension. Lavendale had all the courage and unshaken nerves of youth and yet at that moment he was afraid. His groped along the wall for the switch and found it with an impulse of relief. The room was flooded with soft light—Lavendale\u0027s hand seemed glued to the little brass knob. He stood there with his back to the wall, his face set, speechless. Mr. Daniel H. Hurn was seated in an easy-chair in what appeared at first to be a natural attitude. His head, however, had fallen back, and from his neck drooped the long end of a silken cord. Lavendale took one step forward and then paused again. The man\u0027s face was visible now—white, ghastly, with wide-open, sightless eyes.... \\n\\n \\n\\n The valet, who was passing down the corridor, paused and looked in at the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is there anything wrong, sir?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale seemed to come back with a rush into the world of real things. He withdrew the key from the door, stepped outside and locked it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You had better take that to the manager,\u0027 he said. \u0027I will wait outside here. Tell him to come at once.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Anything wrong, sir?\u0027 the valet repeated. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The man there in the chair is dead!\u0027 he whispered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1900/54740.html","bookId":924,"book":{"id":924,"title":"Ambrose Lavendale, Diplomat","description":"简介： It was a few minutes after one o\u0027clockthe busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in London.
