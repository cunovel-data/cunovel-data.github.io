COURLANDER","content":"Lavendale glanced at his thin gold watch and replaced it in his waistcoat pocket. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Three minutes past eight,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027Half a dozen pairs of gloves for me, I think. Shall I go in and see about a table or would you rather dine somewhere else?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Suzanne made a little grimace. They were in the foyer of the Ritz Hotel, and she was wearing a wonderful new gown. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is most disappointing,\u0027 she declared. \u0027I had made up my mind to conquest.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am very impressionable,\u0027 Lavendale assured her. \\n\\n \\n\\n She shook her head petulantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is not you whom I wish to subjugate.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am too easy a victim, I suppose,\u0027 Lavendale sighed. \u0027I am afraid that to-night, however, you will have to be content with me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Her face suddenly changed, a brilliant smile parted her lips, she glanced at him triumphantly. Lavendale looked over his shoulder. Mr. Kessner was crossing the lounge towards them with outstretched hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve lost your gloves,\u0027 Suzanne murmured under her breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Kessner greeted his two guests in the most matter-of-fact fashion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I must apologize for being a few moments late,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is rather crowded here to-night, and I thought it best to go and see that no mistake had been made about my table. I should like, if I may, to introduce to you Mr. Courlander, a friend of mine from New York. Mr. Courlander is dining with us.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The two young people murmured something suitable. Mr. Courlander turned out to be a dark, heavy-browed man, clean-shaven, and of a taciturn disposition. The little party made their way in to dinner. They were ushered to a small round table in the best quarter of the room, a table lavishly arranged with flowers and flanked with a couple of ice-pails, from which gold-foiled bottles were protruding. Suzanne gave a little sigh of content as she sank into her chair, and looked around her appreciatively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I have always observed,\u0027 she said softly, \u0027that the men of your country, Mr. Kessner, know so well how to entertain.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And also,\u0027 Mr. Kessner remarked, blinking slightly, \u0027how to select their guests.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The service of dinner proceeded. Mr. Kessner, in his dress-suit, which seemed several sizes too large for him, appeared somehow to have become a more insignificant person than ever. In this ultra-fashionable restaurant, full of well-set-up men and soldiers in uniform, he seemed almost like some by-product, something not altogether human. His very insignificance compelled a certain amount of notice; conferred upon him, perhaps, an air of distinctiveness if not of distinction. He was Kessner, the multi-millionaire, probably over to secure contracts from the Government. The aroma of wealth hovered around his table. The term \u0027German-American\u0027 was unused—to few people there did it convey any significance. The little party talked of every subject under the sun except the war. Mr. Courlander, notwithstanding his heavy appearance, was an excellent raconteur. Dinner was more than half-way through before their host changed his attitude. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You two young people did not, by any chance, expect me to break my appointment for this evening, did you?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We had a bet about it,\u0027 Suzanne admitted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Tell me who wagered in my favour and I will tell you which is the cleverer of the two?\u0027 he offered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suzanne laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It was I who thought that you would come,\u0027 she declared. \\n\\n \\n\\n He bowed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027After all,\u0027 he argued, \u0027why not? Listen,\u0027 he went on, leaning across the table. \u0027Courlander here does not count. He is in my confidence. He was, indeed, at one time my private secretary. To the world I am an American. To our young friend here,\u0027 he went on, indicating Lavendale, \u0027who appears to have partly discarded his diplomatic career for an excursion into the secret service of his country, I am a German-American. He follows me to Germany. He knows that I have a conference with the Kaiser. He is all agog with the importance of it. He comes back. He consults with you, my dear young lady, and with marvellous subtlety he asks me to lunch and exposes me most unfairly to the trial of your charms. I succumb—what more natural?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He leaned back in his chair while a portly ma?tres d\u0027h?tel superintended the filling of their glasses with champagne and explained to him the mysteries of the course which was being served. Neither Suzanne nor Lavendale found it easy to continue their meal unmoved. Their eyes were fixed upon this insignificant little man who spoke with such deliberation, such a queer little curl of the lips, such obvious enjoyment of his own thoughts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Your deep-laid scheme,\u0027 he went on, \u0027was crowned with complete success. The poor little American was robbed of his secret. By this time it is probably known in Washington. There is only one little fly in the ointment. A private intimation has already been given through our ambassador in Washington to the American Government, that unless America at once abandons her position of favouring the Allies at the expense of Germany and Austria, Germany will refuse now and for always henceforth to respect and accept the Monroe Doctrine.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a moment\u0027s breathless silence. Then Lavendale drained his glass. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You mean that that pronouncement has already been made?\u0027 he murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It has already been made,\u0027 Mr. Kessner assented. \u0027Further, you can understand quite easily, I am sure, that the exact locality in which this break should take place, although interesting, is not of vital importance. I do not wish to dispirit you. Yours was, without doubt, an excellent stroke of work, and I, the poor victim, am compelled to droop a diminished head. Yet I offer you this explanation so that you can see the reason why I am able to accept my defeat gracefully, to welcome you both here as my guests, to raise my glass to your beautiful eyes, mademoiselle, and to wish you, Mr. Lavendale, the further success in your profession which such subtlety and finesse demand.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Say, he\u0027s eloquent to-night, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 Mr. Courlander remarked. \u0027Quite an epic little meeting, this. I can assure you all that I consider it an immense privilege to have been asked to join your little party this evening.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My subtle friend,\u0027 Mr. Kessner continued, setting his glass down empty, \u0027is now wondering why you were asked to join it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027The fame of Mr. Courlander is well known to me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Their host for a single moment seemed disturbed. He recovered himself, however, almost immediately. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Courlander,\u0027 he went on, \u0027as I have told you was once my secretary. Since then, for a brief space of time, he became a criminologist. Disgusted with the coarse tendencies of crime as practised in more modern cities he abandoned that profession to become what I might call a diplomatic detective. He is the terror of our loose-living public men and our ambitious but dishonest politicians.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Our friend\u0027s career in America,\u0027 Lavendale remarked dryly, \u0027must of necessity be a strenuous one!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Kessner for a moment smiled. There was no effort of humour about the gesture. It was simply a slow, sideways parting of the lips, an index of thoughts travelling backwards along a road lined with grotesque memories. He drew a heavy gold pencil from his pocket and signed the bill. Then he rose to his feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We will take our coffee outside,\u0027 he suggested. \u0027Afterwards, if it meets with your approval, I have a box at one of the music halls—I am not sure which.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They lingered only a few minutes over their coffee. While they sat there, however, Mr. Kessner\u0027s secretary, a middle-aged man with gold spectacles and abstracted manner, brought in a note. Mr. Kessner opened it, read it carefully and tore it into small pieces. He rose, a few minutes later, joined his secretary, who was waiting on the outskirts of the little group, and walked with him twice down the entrance hall. Then he returned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The car is waiting,\u0027 he announced, \u0027if you are ready. Won\u0027t you, my Machiavellian young friend,\u0027 he added, glancing at the scraps of paper which he had left upon the coffee table, \u0027try and put those fragments together? I promise that you would find them interesting—more intrigue, and a very interesting one, I can assure you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale found it hard to forgive himself later for the impulse which prompted his answer. The temptation, however, was irresistible. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I have no need to put them together to know the source of your message,\u0027 he replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No?\u0027 Mr. Kessner remarked politely, as he lingered for a moment over adjusting Suzanne\u0027s coat. \u0027There are a good many millions of people in London, are there not? Shall I give you a hundred thousand to one against naming the writer?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027In dollars, if you like,\u0027 Lavendale replied carelessly. \u0027I won\u0027t take your money, but I\u0027ll start, then, with Baron Niko Komashi.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Kessner, who had half turned away, watching the result of his attentions to Suzanne, became suddenly motionless. His lips were a little parted, he seemed almost paralysed. When he turned slowly around there was a new look in his eyes. Courlander, on the other hand, did not attempt to restrain an exclamation of wonder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Baron Niko Komashi,\u0027 Kessner repeated. \u0027Who is he?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale laughed easily. He was already bitterly regretting his momentary lapse. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Heaven knows!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027The odds dazzled me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They walked out to the car almost in silence. A new spirit seemed to have come to Kessner. He looked and talked differently throughout the rest of the evening\u0027s entertainment. He seemed somehow to have lost his air of half bantering confidence. When the time came for farewells, he looked long and earnestly into Lavendale\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We must know one another better, young man,\u0027 was all he said.... \\n\\n \\n\\n On their way back to her rooms, Suzanne gripped Lavendale by the arm and asked him a question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What does it all mean?\u0027 she demanded. \u0027Why did you guess Niko? Why were they both so thunderstruck?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Because,\u0027 he replied, \u0027Niko happened to be the writer of that little epistle.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Her large eyes gleamed at him through the semi-darkness, filled with wonder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But how could you possibly know that?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is your responsibility,\u0027 he explained. \u0027I noticed the perfume directly he drew the note from the envelope.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She laughed softly—softly at first and then heartily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Why, it is most amusing!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027He thinks you a necromancer. He is, I believe, a little afraid of you. And that other man, all through the performance he scarcely took his eyes off you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027At any rate,\u0027 Lavendale observed, \u0027it has given me something to think about.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n II \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale found his way to the American Embassy early on the following morning, and interviewed his friend Mr. Washburn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Anything from Washington?\u0027 he inquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I have only had a formal acknowledgment,\u0027 Mr. Washburn replied, \u0027except that they added a code word they don\u0027t often make use of, and which I take to indicate a pat on the back for you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is it true,\u0027 Lavendale continued, dragging a chair up to the side of Mr. Washburn\u0027s desk, \u0027that Berlin has given Washington to understand that unless she changes her attitude toward the Allies and withdraws her objection to submarine warfare, she will no longer respect the Monroe Doctrine?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Pourparlers to that effect,\u0027 Mr. Washburn confessed, \u0027have passed. How did you come to hear of them?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale smiled a little grimly, yet with some self-satisfaction. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am getting on the track of something else which promises to be even more interesting,\u0027 he went on. \u0027Tell me, how do we stand with Japan just now?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Washburn knitted his brows. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Still friction—always friction,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027The whole thing is too ridiculous. Personally, I consider our Western States are very much to blame. We have never before raised the cry \u0027America for the Americans only,\u0027 and it\u0027s too late to do it now. And the fact of it is you see, the Western States simply decline to fall in with Washington Policy. Then the trouble comes. Any particular reason for asking?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know yet,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027There\u0027s a Japanese fellow named Komashi in my line of business, seems to be very busy just lately. I only caught on to it last night, though. Chief well?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We are all overworked,\u0027 Washburn replied. \u0027We have had to send Barclay over to Berlin to get a personal report about the prisoners\u0027 camps there. Then we get enough questions from Germany ourselves, about their prisoners here, to swamp the place.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale took up his hat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll see you later,\u0027 he promised. \\n\\n \\n\\n He walked down the steps from Spring Gardens into St. James\u0027s Park and sat for a time upon a seat. Exactly in front of him, the upper floors of one of the big houses in Carlton Terrace had been turned into a hospital, and he could see the soldiers lying about in long chairs, a few of them entertaining guests. Behind him was the long row of huts built by the Admiralty. A troop of soldiers swung along the broad road, a loudly playing band heralded the approach of a little company of recruits. Save for these things, London seemed as usual. From where he sat, the hum and the roar of the great city came as insistently as ever to his ears. His thoughts had travelled back to New York. How long, he wondered? ... \\n\\n \\n\\n It was one of the chances of a lifetime which brought Lavendale face to face that afternoon with Baron Niko Komashi in a quiet street near St. James\u0027s Square. Niko would have passed on without even a sign of recognition but Lavendale stopped him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Good afternoon!\u0027 he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Good afternoon!\u0027 the other replied gravely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I should like a few minutes\u0027 conversation with you,\u0027 Lavendale proceeded. \\n\\n \\n\\n Niko was perplexed but acquiescent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If it pleases,\u0027 he answered a little vaguely. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale marched him along the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There is a little bridge club to which I belong, close at hand,\u0027 he said. \u0027Come into the sitting-room there for a few moments. We shall be quite alone at this hour of the afternoon.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Niko suffered himself to be passively led in the direction which his companion indicated. In a few moments they were seated in the comfortable parlour of a well-known bridge club. They were quite alone and Lavendale closed the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 he asked, \u0027how goes it with your new ally?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Niko\u0027s face betrayed nothing but mild wonder. Lavendale smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 he said, \u0027I may be making a mistake about you. I do not think that I am. I think that you represent for your country what I do for mine. You are intensely patriotic. So am I. You realize the need for a certain amount of diplomatic insight into the workings of her constitution and her future. So do I. The only trouble is that you are for Japan and I am for America.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Niko assented very gravely. His soft brown eyes were watching Lavendale\u0027s lips as though they would read upon them even the unuttered words. His finger-tips, soft and pliant as velvet, were pressed together. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are not to be bought, my friend,\u0027 Lavendale went on. \u0027Neither am I. When we walk together, you hedge yourself around with restraint because you believe that I am one of those who could bear your country ill-will. That is where you are wrong. That is where there is a cloud between us which ought to be driven away. Japan and America naturally, industrially and geographically, should be friends, not enemies.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The causes of ill-feeling which lie between us,\u0027 Niko observed suavely, \u0027are not of our making.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nor of ours—not of the true American,\u0027 Lavendale answered promptly. \u0027It is the desire of Washington, official Washington, that the sons of your country who come to us should be treated as our own sons. What we have to contend with, and you, is local feeling. The only sentiment that exists against Japan in my country is that local feeling, and the people who have shown themselves most virulently possessed of it are the compatriots of the man who only within the last few weeks has sought to pave the way for a disgraceful compact with your country.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Niko\u0027s face was a little whiter, his eyes were filled with wonder. Slowly he nodded his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You surprise me with your knowledge of things which I had imagined secret,\u0027 he said. \u0027Secret they have remained so far as I am concerned. Such information as you have gained can have come but from one source, so I will speak thus far. The sword of Japan shall be drawn in defence of her honour, and for no other cause. The alliance which you suggest would be hateful and dishonouring to my country. Nor,\u0027 he concluded, \u0027would Japan at any time commence a war with a treasonable ally.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What answer have you made to Kessner?\u0027 Lavendale asked bluntly. \\n\\n \\n\\n His companion gently raised his eyebrows. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Who is that gentleman—Mr. Kessner?\u0027 he inquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah! I forgot,\u0027 he said. \u0027Those would not be your methods. Yet we know quite well that the person whose name I have mentioned has made overtures to you which could not, under present circumstances, emanate from Berlin. Japan from the west, and Germany on the east, might well embarrass a country so criminally unprepared for war as mine. I take it, however, that that combination is not to be feared.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Niko rose from his place. He had a habit of ending a discussion exactly at the period he chose. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not in your time or mine,\u0027 he answered simply.... \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale, notwithstanding a nervous system almost unexampled, was possessed of curiously sensitive instincts. Before he reached Pall Mall, he was obsessed with an idea that he was being followed. He turned rather abruptly around. A tall, broad-shouldered man in dark clothes, wearing a Homburg hat and with a cigar in the corner of his mouth, waved his stick in friendly greeting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This is Mr. Lavendale, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 he remarked. \u0027Kind of forgotten me, perhaps? My name\u0027s Courlander. Met you with Mr. Kessner the other night.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I remember you perfectly,\u0027 Lavendale acknowledged. \u0027Very pleasant dinner we had.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Courlander fell into step with his companion, who had turned eastwards. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There are few things in the world that Ludwig Kessner doesn\u0027t understand,\u0027 he continued, \u0027from the placing of a loan to the ordering of a dinner. He isn\u0027t much use at eating it, poor fellow, but that\u0027s the fault of his digestion. Too much ice-water, I tell him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale nodded affably. He had no objection whatever to discussing Mr. Kessner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Kind of misunderstood over here, the boss,\u0027 Courlander went on. \u0027People think because he\u0027s of German extraction that his sympathies are altogether that way. As a matter of fact, I can tell you, Mr. Lavendale, that people are dead wrong. At the present moment—I wouldn\u0027t have every one know this, but you\u0027re an American, too—Mr. Kessner is making proposals for a very large purchase of British War Loan.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is he indeed!\u0027 Lavendale observed, in a tone as colourless as he could make it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Courlander glanced at him curiously. They were passing the Carlton and he drew his arm through Lavendale\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Just one cocktail,\u0027 he suggested. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale hesitated for a moment, inspired by an instinctive dislike of his companion. Policy, however, intervened. He accepted the invitation and followed Courlander into the smoke-room. They found two easy-chairs and the latter gave the order. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I was talking about the boss,\u0027 he went on. \u0027There are others besides you who have misunderstood him some, but they\u0027ll learn the truth before the war\u0027s over.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027When is Mr. Kessner returning to America?\u0027 Lavendale asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027As soon as he can find a safe steamer,\u0027 Courlander replied. \u0027He is a trifle nervous about the Atlantic. Say, that tastes good!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Courlander leaned back and sipped his cocktail. Lavendale, with a word of excuse, rose to his feet and strolled across the room to speak to an acquaintance. He returned in less than a minute. Mr. Courlander was leaning back in his chair, American from tip to toe. He wore a dark grey suit of some smooth material. His square-toed boots, the little flag in his buttonhole, his prim tie, his air of genial confidence, were all eloquently and convincingly typical of his nationality. Lavendale was followed by a waiter bearing two more glasses upon a tray. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Try my sort,\u0027 he invited. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Courlander glanced at Lavendale\u0027s glass, which was still three-quarters full. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You haven\u0027t finished your first one yet,\u0027 he remarked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A little too dry for me,\u0027 Lavendale replied, placing it upon the tray and taking the full glass. \u0027Here\u0027s luck!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The two men looked at one another. In Courlander\u0027s hard brown eyes, a little narrowed by his drooping eyebrows, there was an air of fierce though latent questioning. Then with an abrupt gesture he took the glass from the tray and drank off its contents. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll forgive me if I hurry away,\u0027 Lavendale went on. \u0027We shall meet again, I dare say, before Mr. Kessner leaves.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sure!\u0027 Mr. Courlander murmured, as he picked up his hat. \u0027I am generally to be found round about the Milan. Like to have you come and dine with me one night.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The two men parted at the hotel entrance. Lavendale got into a taxi and drove to his rooms. As he changed his clothes, he glanced through his correspondence. There was a note from Suzanne which he read over twice:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Dear Friend,— \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I want to see you at once. I shall be in from seven till eight. Please call.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale glanced at the clock, hurried with his toilet, and found himself ringing the bell at the entrance door of Suzanne\u0027s suite at half-past seven. She admitted him herself and ushered him into the little sitting-room, which had been transformed almost into a bower of deep red roses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Kessner,\u0027 she exclaimed, pointing around, \u0027with a carte de visite! You see what he says?—\u0027\"From a forgiving enemy!\"\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale glanced at them with a frown upon his forehead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d like to throw them out of the window,\u0027 he declared frankly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do not be foolish,\u0027 she laughed. \u0027Listen. You are dining somewhere?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027At our own shop,\u0027 he replied. \u0027They ask me about once in every two months, to fill up.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wanted to speak to you about that man Courlander,\u0027 she went on. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Lawrence Dowell—the American newspapers woman, you know—was in here yesterday and stayed to lunch. We saw Mr. Courlander in the distance and she told me about him. Do you know that he was convicted of murder?—that it was only through Mr. Kessner\u0027s influence that he was taken out of Sing-Sing? He was a police-sergeant and his name was Drayton. They say that there were several cases against him of having men put out of the way who had made themselves obnoxious to Tammany Hall. The sentence against him was quite clear, yet Mr. Kessner not only managed to have him released but made him his private secretary.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale stood for a moment looking out of the window with his hands in his pockets. Then he turned slowly around. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027About an hour ago,\u0027 he said, \u0027this fellow Courlander tried to doctor a cocktail I was drinking in the Carlton smoking-room.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 she exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I met him at the corner of St. James\u0027s Street,\u0027 he went on. \u0027I had been in the club with Niko Komashi, and I am perfectly certain that he had been dogging me. We walked along Pall Mall and he pressed me to go in and have a cocktail. I happened to cross the room to speak to Willoughby and on the way glanced into the mirror. I saw Courlander\u0027s hand suddenly flash over my glass. It was so quick that even though I saw it myself, I could scarcely believe it, and I\u0027m certain that no one else in the room could have noticed it. When I got back, I made some excuse and ordered another cocktail.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She seemed suddenly to lose some part of that serenity which as yet he had never seen even ruffled. She was distinctly paler. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You must be careful—please promise that you will be careful,\u0027 she begged. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This isn\u0027t New York,\u0027 he reminded her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But that man is a perfect devil,\u0027 she persisted earnestly. \u0027He is a professional murderer. He has no feeling, no mercy, and he is so cunning. And behind him there is Kessner and all his millions.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027All the millions that were ever owned,\u0027 he said, \u0027wouldn\u0027t help a man over here against the law. I am not afraid of Courlander. There is nothing he could try which I am not prepared for, and if it comes to a hand-to-hand struggle, I don\u0027t think I have anything to fear from him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t like it,\u0027 she told him frankly. \u0027You will be on your guard, won\u0027t you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n His voice softened. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course I will, but, Miss de Freyne—Suzanne—why don\u0027t you like it? Why do you worry about me at all?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She was silent for a moment. She had turned a little towards the window, her eyes had lost their usual directness. He took a step forward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It isn\u0027t because you care a little about me, by any chance, is it?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n She gave him her hand. Then she turned around and he saw that her eyes were soft with tears. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Suzanne!\u0027 he faltered. \\n\\n \\n\\n She turned towards him. There was something very sweet about her little gesture, something yielding and yet restraining. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Won\u0027t you please forget all this for just a little time?\u0027 she pleaded. \u0027To tell you the truth, I feel almost like a traitress when I even let myself think of such things now that my country is in such agony, when everything that is dear to me in life seems imperilled. You have your work, too, and I have mine. Perhaps the end may be happy.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He raised her fingers to his lips and kissed them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I will obey,\u0027 he promised, turning towards the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And you will be careful—please be careful,\u0027 she begged, as she let him out and squeezed his arm for a moment. \u0027There! Now you must go to your dinner. You look very nice, and I am sure you will sit next some one altogether charming, and perhaps you will forget. But I shall like to think of this evening.\u0027 ... \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Practical, hard-headed, and with a sound hold upon the every-day episodes of life, Lavendale nevertheless passed through the remainder of that evening with his head in the clouds. He was vaguely conscious of the other twenty-three guests who shared with him the hospitality of the Ambassador—a few diplomats, a professor from Harvard University and his wife, two other distinguished Americans, with a sprinkling of their English connections. He sat next a distant relative of his own, an American girl who had married an Englishman, and his abstraction was perhaps ministered to by the fact that conversation from him was entirely unlooked for. In the reception rooms afterwards he found himself able to speak for a moment with Washburn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Have you seen anything of Mr. Kessner?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n The other made a little grimace. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Very little,\u0027 he replied. \u0027The Chief and he don\u0027t exactly hit it off. I heard a rumour the other day that he might be going back to Germany.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale played a couple of rubbers of bridge and was invited to take a cigar in the library before he left. It was shortly after one o\u0027clock before he stepped into the taxicab which a servant had summoned for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u002717 Sackville Street,\u0027 Lavendale directed. \\n\\n \\n\\n He threw himself back in the corner of the vehicle, and they glided off. A drizzling rain was falling and the streets were almost empty. He leaned forward in his place to light a cigarette. That fact and his habits of observation probably saved his life. He realized suddenly that this was no ordinary taxicab in which he was travelling. It conformed to none of the usual types. The cushions were more luxurious, the appointments unusual. He sat for a moment thinking. The chauffeur was driving at a fair pace, but he had taken a somewhat circuitous route. Lavendale tried the doors, first on one side, then on the other. They were both fast, secured with some sort of spring lock. Suddenly alert, he rose softly to his feet, crouched for a moment upon the back seat and thrust his head and shoulders through the window. It was easy enough to wriggle out, to descend and allow the vehicle to proceed to its destination, wherever that might be, without its passenger, but the love of adventure was upon him. He set his teeth, sank back once more in his corner, half closed his eyes. To all appearance he might have been a tired diner-out prematurely asleep. As a matter of fact, every nerve and sense was keenly on the alert, and his right fingers were locked around the butt of a small revolver. Without protest or comment, he saw himself conducted by a roundabout way into a maze of quiet streets. Then, with a little thrill of anticipation, he saw a man who had been loitering near an entry turn and follow the vehicle, which at his coming had slackened speed. The man was wearing some sort of rubber-soled shoes and his footsteps upon the street were noiseless. Through his half-closed eyes, Lavendale was nevertheless conscious of his approach, realized his soft spring on to the footboard of the car, was more than prepared for the sudden flick in his face of a sodden towel, reeking with chloroform. His right fist shot out, the figure on the footboard went reeling back into the street. Even then, prepared though he had been, Lavendale for a moment gasped for breath. The car, with a sudden grinding of the brakes, came to a standstill. They were at the top of a darkly-lit street and not a soul was in sight. Lavendale thrust his foot through the glass in front of him, shattering it all around the driver. The man half sprang to his feet, but Lavendale\u0027s swift speech arrested him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sit where you are,\u0027 he ordered. \u0027Never mind about that other fellow. Drive me to the Milan Hotel. You know the way, so do I. If you go a yard out of it, feel this!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He suddenly dug the muzzle of his revolver into the man\u0027s neck. The man, with an oath, crouched forward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do as I tell you,\u0027 Lavendale thundered, \u0027or I\u0027ll shoot you where you sit! Remember you\u0027re not in New York. Do as I tell you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Once more the car glided off. They turned almost immediately into Piccadilly, across Leicester Square, passed up the Strand and drew up at the Milan. Lavendale put his head through the window as the porter came out from the Court entrance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t open this door,\u0027 he said. \u0027Ask the fellow in front how to do it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The porter stared with surprise at the shattered glass. The driver slipped down, touched a spring on the outside and the door flew open. He had pulled his cap deeper over his face. Lavendale looked at him for a moment steadfastly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Wait for me,\u0027 he ordered. \\n\\n \\n\\n He walked into the Court, rang for the lift and ascended to the fourth floor. He stepped out and rang the bell at number seventy-four. For a moment there was no answer. He rang it again. Then a light suddenly flashed up in the room and Mr. Kessner, fully dressed, stood upon the threshold. He gazed, speechless, at Lavendale, who pushed forward across the threshold, holding the door open with one hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Kessner,\u0027 he said, \u0027your thug with the chloroform is lying on his back somewhere near Sackville Street. I shouldn\u0027t wonder if his spine wasn\u0027t broken. Your sham chauffeur is downstairs with his sham taxicab. I made him bring me here. You understand?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The tip of Mr. Kessner\u0027s tongue had moistened his lips. His lined yellow face seemed more than ever like the face of some noxious animal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are drunk, young man,\u0027 he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale raised his arm and Mr. Kessner stepped back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid,\u0027 Lavendale went on scornfully. \u0027I am not going to shoot you. When the day of reckoning comes between you and me, if ever it does, I shall take you by the throat and wring the life out of your body. But I am here now to tell you this. Before I sleep, a full account of this night\u0027s adventure, instigated by you and your assassin Courlander, will be written down and deposited in a safe place. If anything happens to me, if I disappear even for a dozen hours, that paper will be opened. You may get me, even now, you and Courlander between you, only you\u0027ll have to pay the price. See? In England it\u0027s a damned ugly price!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Kessner sucked the breath in between his teeth. Then, as though with some super-human effort, he recovered himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Say, young fellow, won\u0027t you come in and talk this out?\u0027 he invited. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale laughed dryly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027\"Won\u0027t you walk into my parlour?\"\u0027 he quoted mockingly. \u0027No, thank you, Mr. Kessner! You know where we stand now. Let me give you a word of warning. London isn\u0027t New York. A very little of this sort of thing and you\u0027ll find the hand of a law that can\u0027t be bought or bribed or evaded in any way, tapping upon your shoulders. You understand?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Kessner yawned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are a foolish young man,\u0027 he said, \u0027and you\u0027ve been reading a little too much modern fiction.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He slammed the door and Lavendale descended to the street. The courtyard was empty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The car didn\u0027t wait for me, I suppose?\u0027 he inquired of the porter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The fellow drove off directly you went upstairs, sir. I shouted after him but he took no notice. Shall I get you a taxi, sir?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale fumbled in his pocket, found a cigarette and lit it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 he replied, \u0027I think I\u0027ll walk.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1900/54745.html","bookId":924,"book":{"id":924,"title":"Ambrose Lavendale, Diplomat","description":"简介： It was a few minutes after one o\u0027clockthe busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in London.
