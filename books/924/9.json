{"id":36497,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX AN INTERRUPTED REVUE","content":"Madame Félanie sat before the gaily-decorated mirror which swung upon her dressing table, contemplating the result of her maid\u0027s careful and strenuous attentions. Her dressing-room, during the many months of her great success, had become transformed into a little bower of luxury and comfort. A telephone stood at her elbow amongst a chaos of tortoiseshell-backed toilet articles. There was a soft green carpet upon the floor, a wonderful divan in the most comfortable corner, a few trifles of Empire furniture, an etching or so upon the wall. Madame Félanie was a clever woman and she understood the art of environment. Her costume now for the second act of the brilliant revue in which her success had been almost phenomenal, was practically completed. She wore still a rose-coloured dressing-gown over garments not remarkable for their prodigality, and though the evening papers, a French novel, a little volume of poetry sent from the author, and a box of Russian cigarettes stood at her elbow, she still continued to gaze a little abstractedly at the reflection of her own features in the looking-glass. London had found her beautiful, seductive, vivacious. She was all of these. Her dark and beautifully-set eyes restrained their gleam of natural violet notwithstanding the encompassment of stage make-up. No rouge could conceal the pearly brilliancy of her complexion, no cake of powder the charming lines of her mouth. It was not at these things, however, that she looked. Her eyes were fixed steadily upon the roots of her blue-black hair, drawn back from her forehead in a manner peculiar to herself. She even raised the tiny magnifying glass on the table before her, to concentrate her regard, and there was in her face almost at that moment a shadow, as though some faint foreboding was hovering over her, even in these halcyon days of her great triumph. She laid the magnifying glass down. \u0027It is impossible,\u0027 she murmured to herself, stretching out her hand for a cigarette. There was a knock at the door. Her maid came softly in—an elderly woman in prim black, softly-shod and with the art of moving noiselessly. She carried a card in her hand, which she presented to her mistress. \u0027Madame,\u0027 she announced, \u0027this gentleman desires the favour of a word with you.\u0027 Félanie stretched out her hand. \u0027You know so well, Marie,\u0027 she complained. \u0027that I receive here only those who need send no card. Give him my address, if it is a gentleman from the Press.\u0027 \u0027I thought madame would prefer to see this gentleman,\u0027 the maid said quietly. Still with a queer reluctance, Félanie took the card into her white fingers. Before she glanced at it she knew very well what name she would find written there, and she hated the knowledge. The black letters stared up at her— Mr. Ambrose Lavendale, 17 Sackville Street. Félanie turned her head slowly and looked upwards at her maid. The woman\u0027s face, however, was blank. \u0027The gentleman is doubtless known to Mr. Wiltshaw,\u0027 the latter continued. \u0027He secured the entrée here without difficulty. He waits now in the passage.\u0027 \u0027You can show him in,\u0027 her mistress ordered. There were a few seconds during which another woman looked into that gaily-hung mirror, and another reflection appeared there. The mouth was no longer seductive, but grim. The eyes were no longer insolent, half challenging conquest, half promising tenderness, but seemed, indeed, to have receded a little, to be filled with the shrinking light of fear. The transition was extraordinary and complete. Here sat a terrified woman, face to face with some evil thing! Then there came a knock at the door. As with the touch of her fingers upon the switch the gloom of the room was changed into brilliant light, so Félanie almost miraculously recovered herself. She swung round in her dainty revolving chair. Her lips, even, fell naturally and easily into the lines of her most seductive smile. What fear there was at the woman\u0027s heart showed itself no longer in her face. \u0027Monsieur Lavendale—Monsieur Ambrose Lavendale, is it not?\u0027 she added, with a momentary glance at the card. \u0027You wish to see me? Lavendale came a little further into the room and bowed. At a glance from her mistress, the maid softly withdrew, closing the door. In his severely simple evening clothes, Lavendale seemed in that little room to be taller even than his six feet two. Félanie, who had risen to her feet, felt herself suddenly dominated. \u0027Madame,\u0027 Lavendale said, \u0027I have ventured to present myself in order to renew a very delightful acquaintance.\u0027 She played the game bravely. \u0027But, monsieur,\u0027 she protested, \u0027I have not the pleasure of knowing you.\u0027 He sighed. \u0027It is, alas! then, your memory, madame, which is at fault.\u0027 \u0027Or yours?\u0027 she queried softly. He shook his head. \u0027Those who have had the privilege of knowing the lady who calls herself now Madame Félanie, could make no mistake.\u0027 \u0027Yet it seems,\u0027 she persisted, acknowledging his courtesy with a smile, \u0027that that is what has happened. You are gallant, monsieur, but there are so many of us upon the stage who resemble one another.\u0027 He shook his head with a self-confidence which she hated. \u0027There is no man in this world,\u0027 he declared, \u0027who could fail to recognize Adèle Goetz, even under the guise of Madame Félanie. May I congratulate you upon your great success? Your revue, they tell me, will run for ever.\u0027 \u0027You are very kind,\u0027 she said, her knees beginning to tremble a little, \u0027but indeed you are mistaken. My name is Elaine Félanie. It is my own name. I came from the Odéon. I am so well-known in Paris. This lady of whom you speak perhaps resembled me.\u0027 Lavendale did not for a moment reply. His face had become a shade graver, his grey eyes held hers. \u0027Is there, then, a reason, madame,\u0027 he asked, \u0027why Adèle Goetz preferred to disappear and Madame Félanie to rise from her ashes? Am I not one of those who could be trusted? My memories of Mademoiselle Adèle are too delightful for me to bear anything but good-will towards Madame Félanie.\u0027 She stood for a moment quite still. Her brain was working quickly. After all, the man was an American. She looked at him a little doubtfully. He smiled—and she yielded. She gave him both her hands. \u0027Monsieur Ambrose,\u0027 she said, \u0027it can go on no longer. I thought myself an actress but you have conquered. You are my friend?\u0027 \u0027Your devoted friend,\u0027 he assured her. \u0027You can imagine, then, why here in England it is Elaine Félanie alone who exists?\u0027 \u0027Adèle Goetz, if I remember rightly,\u0027 he replied, \u0027was of German birth.\u0027 She glanced almost nervously around her. He went on without pause. \u0027So far as that simple fact is concerned,\u0027 he continued, \u0027you will not—you need have no fear of my discretion.\u0027 She gave him her hands again and this time there was more of invitation in her gesture. \u0027You were always kind to me,\u0027 she murmured. \u0027We shall see something of one another now, is it not so?\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027Alas! no, madame,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027I am engaged to be married.\u0027 \u0027And mademoiselle is jealous?\u0027 she inquired, with a little pout. \u0027There is no woman in the world,\u0027 he told her, \u0027who would not be jealous of Madame Félanie.\u0027 She laughed at him with something of her old gaiety, threw herself back in her chair and passed him the cigarettes. \u0027We have a few minutes longer, at least,\u0027 she pleaded, \u0027before we make our pathetic farewells. You have not lost the gift of saying pleasant things, Ambrose.\u0027 \u0027Nor you, Adèle, the art of inspiring them,\u0027 he replied. \u0027Oh, là, là!\u0027 she exclaimed lightly. \u0027Tell me of your life here in London? Tell me why you came to renew our acquaintance if it is to be only a matter of this one visit?\u0027 He had refused her offer of a chair and the cigarette, still unlit, was between his fingers. \u0027Yes, I will tell you that,\u0027 he said. \u0027You read, without a doubt, of the sinking of the Marabic?\u0027 She shrugged her shoulders. \u0027Who has talked of anything else in London these few days?\u0027 \u0027I was amongst the saved,\u0027 he continued, \u0027I and the young lady to whom I am engaged to be married. We were in the last boat that left the ship and lost everything except the clothes we stood up in. That circumstance has, to a certain extent, changed my outlook upon this struggle.\u0027 There was the slightest of frowns upon her velvet brow. She waited. He had the air of one, however, who has concluded all he has to say. He turned towards the door. She stopped him with an imperative gesture. \u0027You have not given me the promise I desire—I demand?\u0027 she cried. \u0027Monsieur Ambrose, you will not leave me like this?\u0027 \u0027That promise,\u0027 he said gravely, \u0027is yours—conditionally.\u0027 His departure was a little abrupt and her gesture to recall him too late. She sat for a moment thinking, a curious shadow upon her face. Then she touched the bell. \u0027Ask Monsieur Anders to spare me a moment,\u0027 she directed her maid. There was a brief interval, then the sound of a cheerful whistling outside. The door was opened and Monsieur Anders himself appeared. He was a small man with a strangely-lined face, a mouth whose humour triumphed even over his plastic make-up. He was attired with great magnificence in the costume of a beau of the last century. His fingers glittered with rings, lace cuffs fell over his wrists and a little waft of peculiar perfume entered with him. It was not for nothing that for many years he had been considered upon the French stage the embodiment of a certain type of elegance. \u0027You have had a visitor, chérie?\u0027 he remarked. \u0027I have,\u0027 she replied. \u0027Shut the door.\u0027 He obeyed at once. From outside came the voice of the stage carpenter, the occasional rumbling of scenery, the music of the orchestra, the murmur now and then of applause. The curtain was up upon a fresh scene in the revue. \u0027Mysterious?\u0027 Anders murmured. Suddenly, even as the word passed his lips, apprehension seemed to seize him. He remained for a moment dumb and motionless. Then he, too, glanced around before he leaned towards her. \u0027It is trouble?\u0027 \u0027Perhaps not,\u0027 she answered. \u0027One cannot tell. A young American has been to see me. He is one of the few who would remember. We were friends in Paris nine years ago. He was a boy then, but, notwithstanding everything, he recognized me.\u0027 \u0027An American,\u0027 Anders muttered. \u0027Better that than an Englishman! Well?\u0027 \u0027He was serving his apprenticeship in the American Diplomatic Service in those days,\u0027 she went on. \u0027What he is doing now I do not know, except that he and the girl whom he is engaged to marry, were amongst survivors from the Marabic. He went out of his way to pay me a visit here, just to tell me that he recognized me, and he made it plain that although he is not an Englishman, he is in sympathy with them.\u0027 \u0027Did he threaten?\u0027 Anders asked quickly. \u0027No,\u0027 she replied, \u0027and yet he terrified me. He promised silence—conditionally.\u0027 \u0027Conditionally? How?\u0027 \u0027He left that for me to understand. I am still puzzled. He does not want to see me any more—he took pains to tell me that he was engaged to be married. Yet underneath his manner I seemed to discover a threat.\u0027 Anders stood perfectly still for a moment. Underneath all the paint and make-up of his face, he was suddenly haggard. \u0027Is it worth it, Henri?\u0027 she faltered. \u0027Why not America at once, and safety? We could get a great engagement there.\u0027 He stood biting his nails, agitated. \u0027There is this last affair to be carried through,\u0027 he reminded her. \u0027And the money—think of it! How can one live without money!\u0027 \u0027Our salaries,\u0027 she murmured. \u0027Pooh! What man with my tastes could live on any salary?\u0027 \u0027Is it worth while to trifle with life and death?\u0027 she asked him bluntly. \u0027It is a warning, this, Henri.\u0027 The call-boy\u0027s voice was suddenly heard. \u0027Monsieur Anders! Monsieur Anders!\u0027 The Frenchman turned mechanically towards the door. \u0027You have destroyed my nerve,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027You have perhaps ruined my performance. Afterwards we will see.\u0027 ... It was \u0027French Night\u0027 at Luigi\u0027s Restaurant, a gala night even in those strenuous war days. Every table in the place was taken, and others had been wheeled in. The waiters made their way about with difficulty. Bohemia and the sycophantic scions of fashion sat arm in arm. The grimmer duties of patriotism were for a moment forgotten. Its other claims met with ample recognition. Félanie sang the \u0027Marseillaise\u0027 twice amidst a scene of wild applause. A great French actress from the legitimate stage had recited a patriotic ode. The flags on the tables had been sold for absurd sums by a sympathetic duke who should clearly have been an auctioneer. A hundred messages of sympathy, of love, of faith, were sent across the wineglasses to the country whom it was designed to honour. Back in their corner, Lavendale and Suzanne looked on curiously. Once Lavendale drank a little toast with his companion. \u0027This,\u0027 he murmured,\u0027 is to our fuller alliance.\u0027 She drank with him, although she seemed a little puzzled. \u0027Listen, dear,\u0027 he went on, \u0027there is just one little thing I\u0027d like to say to you to-night. You and I have helped one another at times, but there has always been a certain reserve. I told you months ago that I was for America above all things, and America only. To-day I feel differently. I have been a witness—you and I together—of foul and brutal murder. I have seen women drowned, have heard their shrieks. America may keep the peace with Germany. It may be in the interests of the highest diplomacy that she should. As for me, I am at war with Germany. I am your ally.\u0027 Her fingers rested upon his. \u0027Then there is some good,\u0027 she whispered, \u0027which has come out of that great and abominable evil.\u0027 \u0027A very small good,\u0027 he said, \u0027but it may count. Tell me, do you know who that fair, almost sandy young man is, sitting at the table with Félanie and her friends?\u0027 \u0027Of course,\u0027 she answered. \u0027That is Lenwade, the great flying man.\u0027 She dropped her voice suddenly. The young man had risen from his chair, and, in the act of passing down the room to speak to some acquaintances, paused before their table. He bowed to Suzanne and held out his hand to Lavendale. They were old acquaintances and spoke for some time on indifferent subjects. \u0027What have you been doing with yourself lately?\u0027 Lavendale inquired. \u0027Not much flying,\u0027 the other confessed. \u0027I have been down giving lessons and breaking in a lot of the youngsters, but I can\u0027t stick it myself as I used to. Plays the devil with your nerves.\u0027 \u0027Rubbish!\u0027 Lavendale laughed. \u0027You haven\u0027t a nerve in your body.\u0027 \u0027Haven\u0027t I?\u0027 the other replied. \u0027I remember the time when I could say that. I\u0027d give anything to be at the front now if I felt equal to it, or if my doctor would let me.\u0027 Lavendale smiled, and glanced around to be sure that his neighbours were not listening. \u0027What were you doing at Ypres the week before last, then?\u0027 he asked, dropping his voice a little. Lenwade for a moment was silent, then he shrugged his shoulders. \u0027You must have mistaken me for some one else,\u0027 he declared. \u0027Good-night!\u0027 He took his leave a little abruptly. Lavendale watched him disappear. Then he glanced towards his companion. His face had become graver. \u0027Let me put a case to you, my fellow conspirator,\u0027 he begged. \u0027I will put one to you instead,\u0027 she replied. \u0027I know for a fact that Philip Lenwade has been in France for two months, flying every day, engaged upon some special task. He denies it to us—quite properly, perhaps—but should he come to places like this, should he drink champagne so that he is compelled to hold the table while he stands? It is true that all the world knows of his infatuation for Félanie. She is safe, perhaps—a Frenchwoman and a patriot—yet there is something about it which I do not like. She and Lenwade have been whispering together half the evening, and more than once I have seen Lenwade shake his head and push her away.\u0027 \u0027Supposing Félanie,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027were not a Frenchwoman at all?\u0027 Suzanne said nothing. She waited, watching her companion with wide-open eyes. Lavendale looked down upon the tablecloth. \u0027From you,\u0027 he continued simply, \u0027I have no secrets. Nine years ago I knew Félanie in Paris. She went then by the name of Adèle Goetz. She was a German.\u0027 \u0027Go on.\u0027 \u0027I watched her from the box to-night. At first I was oppressed, as I have been before, by some vague sense of familiarity in her gestures. Suddenly—I think it was the way she shrugged her shoulders, one higher than the other—anyhow, something brought it all back to me. That was why I left you, Suzanne. I went to her room. Her flaxen hair has become blue-black, she has altered in many ways but I discovered that I was right.\u0027 \u0027She is a German, posing as a Frenchwoman, in London to-day?\u0027 Suzanne exclaimed. \u0027Why does she run this risk?\u0027 \u0027That is what I have asked myself,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027that and another question—what is her interest in Lenwade? Hush! We are talking too earnestly. That fellow Anders—they say he is really her husband—watches us. Here comes Luigi. Talk to him for a moment.\u0027 The manager paused at their table and received their compliments on the success of the evening. When he passed on, Félanie had risen as though to go, and Lenwade was arranging her cloak around her shoulders. Anders was still talking to some other members of the company, and friends seated at the great round table in front of the orchestra. Félanie and Lenwade were half-way down the room before the others began to follow. Lavendale rose quickly to his feet. \u0027Listen,\u0027 he said, \u0027I am going upstairs and shall come down again just far enough, in case I can hear anything. You go through alone and wait for me on the divan. Tell me if those two go away together, and if so, what is their destination.\u0027 They separated at once. A few minutes later Lavendale descended from the balcony and stood just out of sight upon the stairs which led into the entrance hall. The little place was full of the hubbub of cheerful laughter. On one side, however, Félanie and Lenwade were talking earnestly. Félanie had turned suddenly round to Anders, who had just arrived. \u0027Mr. Lenwade is going to drive me home,\u0027 she announced. \u0027Au revoir, all you good people!\u0027 There was much handshaking. \u0027Vive la France, madame,\u0027 a young Englishman exclaimed fervently, as he bent over Félanie\u0027s fingers, \u0027and may you, too, live for ever!\u0027 \u0027If one would paint France, madame,\u0027 a painter murmured, \u0027I would choose you for the emblematic figure.\u0027 There were more compliments, another little burst of patriotic fervour. Some one even struck up a few bars of the \u0027Marseillaise\u0027 as Félanie and her escort disappeared. Lavendale descended the last few stairs and elbowed his way good-humouredly through the group. He took Suzanne by the arm. \u0027Well?\u0027 he whispered, as he led her towards the doorway. \u0027I am not sure,\u0027 she answered under her breath, \u0027but I think they went to his rooms—number 25 Half Moon Street.\u0027 Lavendale\u0027s car was a few minutes delayed. He gave the man the address almost in a whisper. Behind, pushing his way out on to the pavement, was Anders. He watched Lavendale drive off with a slightly disturbed air. \u0027What are you going to do?\u0027 Suzanne asked. \u0027Make a fool of myself, very likely,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027I am just working out a theory, that\u0027s all. She is going back to his rooms. Anders remains behind, content, and all the world knows that Anders, whether he is her husband or not, is in love with her and furiously jealous. You see, there must be a reason for her little expedition. She is hoping to fetch something.\u0027 \u0027Where are we going?\u0027 \u0027To his rooms,\u0027 Lavendale explained. \u0027Oh! don\u0027t look startled, dear. I shall have a very good explanation to offer to Lenwade, even if I break in upon the most ordinary amour.\u0027 They were in Half Moon Street within a few minutes. Just as Lavendale\u0027s car slackened speed, Félanie issued from the door of number 25, and, looking neither to the right nor to the left, sprang into a waiting taxicab and drove off. Lavendale leaped out on to the pavement. \u0027Follow her, Suzanne,\u0027 he directed. \u0027I hope to God she\u0027s going straight home! If not, you must find out where she does go. I\u0027ll come in a taxi. I must see Lenwade first.\u0027 He whispered a direction to the chauffeur, passed through the door of number 25, rang for an automatic lift and ascended to the second storey. Leaning over the banisters, as the lift stopped, was Lenwade. He gazed at his visitor in amazement. \u0027What the mischief are you doing here, old fellow?\u0027 he asked thickly. \u0027Whom are you looking for?\u0027 Lavendale retorted. \u0027Madame Félanie,\u0027 the other confessed. \u0027She has gone down to fetch her vanity case from the cab. Can\u0027t think why she doesn\u0027t come back.\u0027 Lavendale pushed him suddenly back into his room and closed the door. \u0027You idiot!\u0027 he thundered. \u0027She isn\u0027t coming back! Now pull yourself together, do you hear? Listen to me. You\u0027re half drunk, but I am going to tell you something that ought to sober you. That woman Félanie is a born German, and a spy. What have you given her?\u0027 Even through the bluster of his stormy denial, Lenwade was obviously shaken. \u0027What bally rot!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027She\u0027s a Frenchwoman to her finger-tips. They all love her. Didn\u0027t you hear her sing—Marseillaise? Frenchwoman to her finger——\u0027 \u0027Shut up!\u0027 Lavendale interrupted fiercely. \u0027I tell you I knew her nine years ago under another name. She is a German, and it\u0027s my belief she\u0027s a spy, she and Anders. What have they worked on you? Out with it, man!\u0027 Lenwade swayed on his feet. He looked back across his shoulder to a roll-top writing desk which stood open. Then he snatched up a tumbler from the table by his side, filled it with soda-water and drank it off. \u0027Lavendale, you\u0027re not in earnest!\u0027 \u0027In God\u0027s own earnest, man! Quick, if you want to repair the mischief you\u0027ve done, tell me what you gave her?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve lent her my plans,\u0027 Lenwade faltered. \u0027I\u0027ve been two months making them, up above the clouds. I\u0027m the only real draughtsman amongst those who can keep high enough—plans of the German fortifications and the railways behind, from the coast beyond where our lines touch the French. I say, Lavendale——!\u0027 There was no Lavendale. He sprang down the stairs three at a time, out into the street and at a double into Piccadilly, where he sprang into a passing taxicab. \u0027Milan! Look sharp!\u0027 he ordered. The man drove swiftly through the half-empty streets. With a little gasp of relief Lavendale recognized his own car waiting in the courtyard. Without a pause, however, he pushed open the swing doors of the Court and leaned over the counter towards the night porter. \u0027What is Madame Félanie\u0027s number?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Sixty-four, sir,\u0027 the man replied, glancing dubiously at Lavendale. \u0027Monsieur Anders is up there now, however.\u0027 Lavendale stepped into the lift, ascended to the third floor, hurried down the dimly-lit corridor and paused outside the door of number sixty-four. He listened for a moment. Inside he could hear voices. Then he pressed the bell. There was a moment\u0027s hesitation, then Anders\u0027 voice speaking in French. \u0027Lenwade, perhaps.\u0027 He heard Félanie\u0027s scornful little laugh, the flutter of her garments as she crossed the room. The door was suddenly opened and she stood there, looking out at him. She gazed at this unexpected visitor and the colour slowly faded from her cheeks and the light from her eyes. Lavendale made his way firmly across the threshold and closed the door. Félanie caught at her throat. \u0027What do you want here, sir?\u0027 Anders demanded. Lavendale pushed them both back into the sitting-room. There was an ugly look in the man\u0027s face, but Félanie\u0027s courage seemed to have deserted her. She clutched at the air for a moment and sank into an easy-chair, hiding her face amongst the cushions. Lavendale\u0027s hand fell firmly upon the loose sheets of paper strewn over the table. \u0027These are what I have come for,\u0027 he announced, collecting them and thrusting them into his pocket. \u0027I presume you have had no time to make a copy?\u0027 He glanced searchingly around the apartment. It was obvious that nothing of the sort had been attempted. Anders stole slowly back towards the writing-table, his hand was upon the knob of one of the drawers, but Lavendale suddenly gripped him by the coat collar and swung him almost off his feet. \u0027Listen,\u0027 he said coldly, \u0027I know nothing of you, Anders, except that it is my belief that you are one of the vermin of the war, a spy selling his own country. The woman there was once my friend. For that reason, if you leave England on Saturday for America, this matter is finished. If either of you remain in London, or make any attempt to cross to Holland, France or any other country, between now and then, something very ugly will happen. You understand?\u0027 Anders\u0027 courage had failed him pitifully. Félanie, on the contrary, had recovered herself. \u0027I have been a fool, perhaps,\u0027 she confessed. \u0027You were just one of the few chances against me. Very well, we go to America on Saturday.\u0027 \u0027But our contract?\u0027 Anders faltered. \u0027The revue? Elaine\u0027s success? They have doubled our salaries. London is at her feet.\u0027 \u0027After Saturday,\u0027 Lavendale reminded him calmly, \u0027the best that can happen to you, Anders, is a bandaged forehead and twelve bullets, in the courtyard of the Tower. I will not offend your taste by suggesting——\u0027 Félanie stamped her foot and turned her shoulder contemptuously upon Anders. \u0027It is finished, Monsieur Lavendale,\u0027 she pronounced. \u0027If there were any bribe in the world I could offer you——\u0027 It was her one rather faint-hearted effort and he laughed at the seduction in her eyes. \u0027You will be watched from this moment until the steamer leaves Liverpool,\u0027 he concluded, leaving the room and closing the door behind him.... In the hall he met Lenwade, waiting for the lift, incoherent still but sober. Lavendale drew him out into the courtyard, where Suzanne was still seated in the car. \u0027Lenwade,\u0027 he announced, \u0027I have your plans. They are safe with me. I shall keep them until to-morrow morning. You can come to me at 17 Sackville Street at ten o\u0027clock.
