{"id":36490,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II THE LOST FORMULA","content":"The two young men stood side by side before the window of the Milan smoke-room—Ambrose Lavendale, the American, and his friend Captain Merrill from the War Office. Directly opposite to them was a narrow street running down to the Embankment, at the foot of which they could catch a glimpse of the river. A little to the left was a dark and melancholy building with a number of sightless windows. \n \n \u0027Wonder what sort of people live in that place?\u0027 Merrill asked curiously. \u0027Milan Mansions they call it, don\u0027t they?\u0027 \n \n The other nodded. \n \n \u0027Gloomy sort of barracks,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027I\u0027ve never seen even a face at the window.\u0027 \n \n \u0027There\u0027s a new experience for you, then,\u0027 Merrill observed, pointing a little forward,—\u0027a girl\u0027s face, too.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale was stonily silent, yet when the momentarily raised curtain had fallen he gave a little gasp. It could have been no hallucination. The face, transfigured though it was, in a sense, by its air of furtiveness, was, without a doubt, the face of the girl who had been constantly in his thoughts for the last three weeks. He counted the windows carefully from the ground, noted the exact position of the room and passed his arm through his friend\u0027s. \n \n \u0027Come along, Reggie,\u0027 he said. \n \n \u0027Where to?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Don\u0027t ask any questions,\u0027 Lavendale begged. \u0027Just wait.\u0027 \n \n They left the hotel by an unfrequented way, Lavendale half a dozen paces ahead. Merrill ventured upon a mild protest. \n \n \u0027Look here, old chap,\u0027 he complained, \u0027you might tell me where we are off to?\u0027 \n \n Lavendale slackened his speed for a moment to explain. \n \n \u0027To that room,\u0027 he declared. \u0027Didn\u0027t you recognize the girl\u0027s face?\u0027 \n \n Merrill shook his head. \n \n \u0027I scarcely noticed it.\u0027 \n \n \u0027It was the girl whom we found unconscious, half poisoned by that fellow Hurn\u0027s diabolical invention,\u0027 Lavendale explained. \u0027She wasn\u0027t there by accident, either. I caught her listening in the Milan Grill-room when Hurn was talking to me, and the day after the inquest she disappeared.\u0027 \n \n Merrill laid a hand upon his friend\u0027s arm. \n \n \u0027Even if this is so, Lavendale,\u0027 he expostulated, \u0027she probably doesn\u0027t want us bothering over here. What are you going to say to her? Pretty sort of asses we shall look if we blunder in upon her like this.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale continued to climb the stairs. By this time they had reached the second landing. \n \n \u0027If you feel that way about it, Merrill,\u0027 he said, \u0027you can wait for me—or clear out altogether, if you like. I want to have a few words with this young lady, and I am going to have them.\u0027 \n \n Merrill sighed. \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll see you through it, Ambrose,\u0027 he grumbled. \u0027All the same, I\u0027m not at all sure that we are not making fools of ourselves.\u0027 \n \n They mounted yet another flight. A crazy lift went lumbering past them up to the top of the building. Lavendale paused outside a door near the end of the passage. \n \n \u0027This should be the one,\u0027 he announced. \n \n He rang a bell. They could hear it pealing inside, but there was no response. Once more he pressed the button. This time it seemed to them both that its shrill summons was ringing through empty spaces. There was no sound of any movement within. The door of the next flat, however, opened. A tall, rather stout man, very untidily dressed, with pale, unwholesome face and a mass of ill-arranged hair, looked out. \n \n \u0027Sir,\u0027 he said, \u0027it is no use ringing that bell. The only purpose you serve is to disturb me at my labours. The flat is empty.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Are you quite sure about that?\u0027 Lavendale asked. \n \n \u0027Absolutely!\u0027 \n \n \u0027How was it, then, that I saw a face at one of the windows a quarter of an hour ago?\u0027 Lavendale demanded. \n \n \u0027You are mistaken, sir,\u0027 was the grim reply. \u0027The thing is impossible. The porter who has the letting of the flat is only on duty in the afternoon, and, as a special favour to the proprietors, I have the keys here.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Then with your permission I will borrow them,\u0027 Lavendale observed. \u0027I am looking for rooms in this neighbourhood.\u0027 \n \n The man bowed and threw open the door. \n \n \u0027Come in, sir,\u0027 he invited pompously. \u0027I will fetch the keys for you. My secretary,\u0027 he added, with a little wave of his hand, pointing to a florid, over-buxom and untidy-looking woman who was struggling with an ancient typewriter. \u0027You find me hard at work trying to finish a play I have been commissioned to write for my friend Tree. You are aware, perhaps, of my—er—identity?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I am sorry,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027You see, I am an American, not a Londoner.\u0027 \n \n \u0027That,\u0027 the other declared, \u0027accounts for it. My name is Somers-Keyne—Hamilton Somers-Keyne. My work, I trust, is more familiar to you than my personality?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Naturally,\u0027 Lavendale assented, a little vaguely. \n \n The dramatist, who had been searching upon a mantelpiece which seemed littered with cigarette ends, scraps of letters and an empty tumbler or so, suddenly turned around with the key in his hand. \n \n \u0027It is here,\u0027 he pronounced. \u0027Examine the rooms for yourself, Mr.——?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Lavendale.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Mr. Lavendale. They are furnished, I believe, but as regards the rent I know nothing except that the myrmidon who collects it is unpleasantly persistent in his attentions. If you will return the key to me, sir, when you have finished, I shall be obliged.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Certainly,\u0027 Lavendale promised. \n \n The two young men opened the door and explored a dusty, barely-furnished, gloomy, conventional little suite, consisting of a single bedroom, a boxlike sitting-room, and a bathroom in the last stages of dilapidation. The rooms were undoubtedly empty, nor was there anywhere any sign of recent habitation. Lavendale stood at the window, leaned over and counted. When he drew back his face was more than ever puzzled. He looked once more searchingly around the unprepossessing rooms. \n \n \u0027This was the window, Reggie,\u0027 he insisted. \n \n Merrill had lost interest in the affair and did not hesitate to show it. \n \n \u0027Seems to me you must have counted wrongly,\u0027 he declared. \u0027In any case, there\u0027s no one here now, and it\u0027s quite certain that no one has been in during the last hour or so.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale said nothing for a moment. He examined the flat once more carefully, locked it up, and took the key back to Mr. Somers-Keyne\u0027s room. The dramatist opened the door himself. \n \n \u0027You were favourably impressed, I trust, with the rooms?\u0027 he inquired, holding out his hand for the key. \n \n \u0027I am not sure,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027Tell me, how long is it since any one occupied them?\u0027 \n \n \u0027They are dusted and swept once a week,\u0027 Mr. Somers-Keyne told him, looking closely at his questioner from underneath his puffy eyelids, \u0027and they may have been shown occasionally to a prospective tenant. Otherwise, no one has been in them for nearly a month.\u0027 \n \n \u0027No one could have been in them this morning, then?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Absolutely impossible,\u0027 was the confident answer. \u0027The keys have not been off my shelf.\u0027 \n \n \u0027We must not interrupt you further,\u0027 Lavendale declared. \u0027I shall apply for a first night seat when your production is presented, Mr. Somers-Keyne.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You are very good, sir,\u0027 the other acknowledged. \u0027Your face, I may say, is familiar to me as a patron of the theatre. What are the chances, may I inquire, of your taking up your residence in this building?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I have not made up my mind,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027There are some other particulars I must have. I shall call and interview the hall-porter this afternoon.\u0027 \n \n \u0027If a welcome, sir, from your nearest neighbour is any inducement,\u0027 Mr. Somers-Keyne pronounced, \u0027let me offer it to you. My secretary, too, Miss Brown—I think I mentioned Miss Brown\u0027s name?—is often nervous with an empty flat next door. I am out a great deal in the evening, Mr. Lavendale. My work demands a constant study of the most modern methods of dramatic production. You follow me, I am sure?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Absolutely,\u0027 Lavendale assured him. \u0027By the by, sir, we are returning for a moment or two to the bar at the Milan. If you will accompany us——\u0027 \n \n Mr. Somers-Keyne was already reaching out for his hat. \n \n \u0027With the utmost pleasure, my dear young friends,\u0027 he consented. \u0027The Milan bar was at one time a hallowed spot to me. Misfortunes of various sorts—but I will not weary you with a relation of my troubles. If Tree rings up, Flora, say that I shall have finished the second act to-night. You can tell him that it is wonderful. Now, gentlemen!\u0027 \n \n They left the building together and a few moments later were ensconced in a corner of the bar with a bottle of whisky and some tumblers before them. Lavendale helped his guest bountifully. He had hard work, however, to keep the trend of the conversation away from the subject of Mr. Somers-Keyne\u0027s early triumphs upon the stage, which it appeared were numerous and remarkable. With every tumblerful of whisky and soda, indeed, he seemed to grow more forgetful of his home across the way. As he expanded he grew more untidy. His tie slipped, his collar had flown open, his waistcoat was spotted with the liquid which had fallen from the glass in his unsteady efforts to lift it to his lips. His pasty face had become mottled. Lavendale, who had been watching his guest closely, fired a sudden question at him. \n \n \u0027You don\u0027t happen to know a Miss de Freyne, do you?\u0027 he inquired innocently. \n \n The change in the man was wonderful. From a state of maudlin amiability he seemed to be stricken with an emotion of either fear or anger. His eyes narrowed. He set his glass down almost steadily, although he was obliged to breathe heavily several times before he spoke. \n \n \u0027Miss de Freyne,\u0027 he repeated. \u0027What about her?\u0027 \n \n Lavendale pointed towards the window behind them. \n \n \u0027Nothing except that when I was in here an hour ago I saw Miss de Freyne\u0027s face at the window of that empty suite next to yours,\u0027 he said. \n \n Mr. Somers-Keyne rose to his feet. A splendid dignity guided his footsteps and kept his voice steady. \n \n \u0027Sir,\u0027 he pronounced, \u0027I am able to surmise now the reason for your excessive hospitality. I wish you good morning!\u0027 \n \n He turned towards the door. \n \n \u0027Mr. Somers-Keyne,\u0027 Lavendale began, rising hastily to his feet—— \n \n The dramatist waved him away. His gesture, if a little theatrical, was final. The honours remained with him.... \n \n \n Lavendale, a few minutes later, on his way to his luncheon-table in the grill-room, threw his accustomed glance across the room towards the corner which was still possessed of a peculiar interest for him. He paused in the act of taking his place. At her same table, with a little pile of manuscript propped up in front of her, Miss de Freyne was seated, studying the luncheon menu. For a moment he hesitated. Then he rose to his feet and, crossing the room, addressed her. \n \n \u0027Miss de Freyne!\u0027 \n \n She glanced up in some surprise. She seemed, indeed, scarcely to recognize him. \n \n \u0027You have not forgotten me, I hope?\u0027 he continued. \u0027My name is Lavendale.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Of course,\u0027 she assented slowly. \u0027You were the friend of that strange little creature with the marvellous invention, weren\u0027t you?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I was scarcely his friend,\u0027 Lavendale corrected, \u0027but I did my best to help him.\u0027 \n \n She made a pencil mark in the margin of the manuscript and laid it face downwards upon the table. Then she leaned back in her chair and looked at him. \n \n \u0027Tell me what happened?\u0027 she begged. \u0027I was obliged to leave London the next day and I have only just returned. Was it suicide or murder?\u0027 \n \n \u0027The man was murdered, without a doubt,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \n \n \u0027Is that so, really?\u0027 she asked gravely. \u0027Tell me, had he given over his formula to the War Office?\u0027 \n \n Lavendale sighed. \n \n \u0027Unfortunately no! He was to have handed it over at eleven o\u0027clock the next morning.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Was it found amongst his effects?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Not a written line of any sort.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Is any one suspected?\u0027 she inquired, dropping her voice a little. \n \n Lavendale hesitated and glanced cautiously around. \n \n \u0027Scarcely that,\u0027 he answered, \u0027but you remember the man Jules, the ma?tres d\u0027h?tel here?\u0027 \n \n She nodded. \n \n \u0027A Swiss, wasn\u0027t he? I was just wondering what had become of him. \n \n \u0027During the investigations the next day,\u0027 Lavendale continued, \u0027it was discovered that his papers were forged and that he was in reality an Austrian. He was interned at once, of course, and I believe there was a certain amount of secrecy about his movements on that night. So far as I know, though, nothing has been discovered.\u0027 \n \n She raised her eyebrows deprecatingly. \n \n \u0027The detective system over here,\u0027 she remarked, \u0027is sometimes hopeless, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yet in one respect,\u0027 Lavendale pointed out, \u0027they certainly were prompt on that night. I understand that Jules was interned within an hour of the discovery of the murder.\u0027 \n \n Miss de Freyne drew her manuscript towards her with a little shrug of the shoulders. \n \n \u0027They failed to find the formula, though,\u0027 she reminded him. \n \n Lavendale, accepting his dismissal, returned to his place, finished his lunch and made his way round to the Milan Mansions. A caretaker was established now in his office in the hall. He was a small and rather melancholy-looking man, who hastily concealed a blackened pipe as Lavendale entered. \n \n \u0027I understand that you have a suite to let,\u0027 the latter began, \u0027upon the third floor?\u0027 \n \n The man pulled out a list. \n \n \u0027We have several suites to let, sir,\u0027 he replied; \u0027nothing upon the third floor, though.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What about number thirty-two?\u0027 \n \n The caretaker shook his head. \n \n \u0027Number thirty-two is let, sir.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 Lavendale persisted. \u0027I called this morning and was allowed to look over it by Mr. Somers-Keyne, who had the keys.\u0027 \n \n \u0027It was taken by a young lady just before one o\u0027clock, at our head office,\u0027 the man told him. \u0027With regard to the other suites, sir——\u0027 \n \n \u0027Could you tell me the young lady\u0027s name?\u0027 Lavendale interrupted. \n \n \u0027I haven\u0027t heard it yet,\u0027 the man answered shortly. \u0027With regard to the other suites——\u0027 \n \n Lavendale slipped a coin into his hand. \n \n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 he said, \u0027there is no other suite in which I am interested for the moment.\u0027 \n \n He stepped out. Almost on the threshold he met Miss de Freyne, face to face. \n \n \u0027Are you coming,\u0027 he asked, raising his hat, \u0027to take possession of your new abode?\u0027 \n \n She was entirely at her ease. She looked at him, however, a little curiously. It was as though she were trying to make an appreciative estimate of him in her mind. \n \n \u0027I suppose,\u0027 she observed, with a little sigh, \u0027that we are playing at cross-purposes. You are an American, are you not, Mr. Lavendale?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I am,\u0027 he answered. \n \n \u0027German-American?\u0027 \n \n \u0027No!\u0027 \n \n \u0027English-American?\u0027 \n \n \u0027No!\u0027 \n \n \u0027What then?\u0027 \n \n \u0027American.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Tell me exactly what that means?\u0027 she insisted. \n \n \u0027It means that my sympathies are concentrated upon my own country,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Those prefixes—German-American or English-American—are misnomers. Wherever my personal sympathies may be, my patriotism overshadows them. Now you know the truth about me. I am an American for America.\u0027 \n \n She sighed. \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she murmured, \u0027I had an idea that was your point of view. I am a Frenchwoman, you see, for France.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Our interests,\u0027 he remarked, \u0027should not be far apart.\u0027 \n \n \u0027If I were sure of that,\u0027 she declared, \u0027the rest would be easy. I am for France and for France only. You are for America, and, I am afraid, for America only.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Chance, in this instance,\u0027 he ventured, \u0027has at any rate made us allies.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I should like to feel quite sure about that,\u0027 she said. \u0027If you are not busy, will you walk with me on to the Embankment?\u0027 \n \n They strolled down the narrow street and found a seat in the gardens. \n \n \u0027Between thieves,\u0027 she continued, looking him in the face, \u0027there is sometimes honour. Why not amongst those who are engaged upon affairs which, if not nefarious, are at least secret? Let us see whether we can be allies, and, if not, where our interests clash. You know perfectly well, as I do, that Jules murdered that little chemist from Chicago and stole the formula. You know very well that the suite in which you take so much interest in the Milan Mansions, belongs to Jules. You know very well that he was arrested there a quarter of an hour after he left the hotel, and that he had had no time to dispose of the formula. You know that the place has been searched, inch by inch, but that the formula has not been found.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I have just arrived exactly as far as that myself,\u0027 Lavendale assented mendaciously. \n \n \u0027You are some time behind me, but it is true that we have arrived at the same point,\u0027 she continued. \u0027Now the question is, can we work together? What should you do with the formula if ever it came into your possession?\u0027 \n \n His lips tightened. \n \n \u0027I cannot tell you that,\u0027 he said firmly. \n \n \u0027I believe that I know,\u0027 she went on. \u0027Well, let me put you to the test.\u0027 \n \n She opened a black silk bag which she was carrying, a little trifle with white velvet lining and turquoise clasp. From a very dainty pocket-book in the interior she drew out a crumpled sheet of paper, covered with strange, cabalistic signs. She smoothed it out upon her knee and handed it to him. \n \n \u0027Well,\u0027 she exclaimed, \u0027there it is! Now you shall tell me what you are going to do with it?\u0027 \n \n His hand had closed over the piece of paper. He gripped it firmly. Before she could stop him he had transferred it to his own pocket. She shrugged her shoulders. \n \n \u0027You had better return it to me,\u0027 she advised. \n \n \u0027I shall not,\u0027 he replied. \u0027Forgive me. I did not ask you for the formula—I did not know you had discovered it—but since I have it, I want you to remember that it was the discovery of an American and I shall keep it for my country.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But your country is not in need of anything of the sort,\u0027 she protested. \n \n \u0027I will be so far frank with you as to explain my motive,\u0027 he said. \u0027A few months ago I was attached to the American Embassy here. I have been attached to the Embassy in Paris, and for two months I was in Berlin. I have come to certain conclusions about America, in which I differ entirely from the popular opinion and the popular politics of my country. England has been living for many years in great peril, but there have been many who have recognized that. The peril of America is at least as great, and has remained almost altogether unrecognized. We have no army, a small navy, an immense seaboard, wealth sufficient to excite the cupidity of any nation. And we have no allies. We make the grave and serious mistake of ignoring world politics, of believing ourselves outside them and yet imagining ourselves capable of protecting the interests of American citizens in foreign countries. That is where I know we are wrong. I have resigned from the Diplomatic Service of America but I remain her one secret agent. I intend to keep this formula for her. She will need it.\u0027 \n \n Suzanne de Freyne shook her head. \n \n You will not be able to leave the gardens alive with it,\u0027 she assured him. \n \n He glanced at her incredulously. Her smooth face was unwrinkled. She had the air of looking at him as though he were a child. \n \n \u0027You are in the kindergarten stage of your profession,\u0027 she observed. \u0027Now watch. You see those two men seated on the bench a little way further down?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Well?\u0027 \n \n She rose from her seat, shook out her skirt and sat down again. The two men, also, had risen and were advancing towards them. She held up her hand—they seemed somehow to drift away. \n \n \u0027I repeat,\u0027 she went on, \u0027that you would not leave this garden alive. But, my friend, we will not quarrel over a worthless scrap of paper, for that is precisely what you have carefully buttoned up in your pocket-book. I have failed to find the formula. That is a dummy. Keep it, if you will. There isn\u0027t a single intelligible sign upon it.\u0027 \n \n He drew it from his pocket and glanced at it. Even with his slight knowledge of chemistry he was compelled to admit that her words were truth. \n \n \u0027Keep it or give it me back, as you like,\u0027 she continued. \u0027It has no value. The fact remains that in his brief journey from the service room at the Milan Grill-room to his rooms in the Milan Mansions, Jules managed to conceal somewhere or other the paper which he has taken from Hurn. If he passed it on to some one else, it is by this time in Germany, but we have reason to know that he did not. The paper is still in concealment. It is still to be found.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And the means?\u0027 he asked. \n \n She shrugged her shoulders lightly. \n \n \u0027Alas!\u0027 she exclaimed, \u0027how can I tell you now? How can I even engage your help? You have disclosed your hand.\u0027 \n \n He sat gazing gloomily out at the river. \n \n \u0027Very well,\u0027 he decided at last, \u0027let me help and I will be content with a copy of the formula.\u0027 \n \n She smiled. \n \n \u0027That is rather sensible of you,\u0027 she said. \u0027To tell you the truth, I require your help. For reasons which I need not explain, we do not wish this matter to be dealt with in any way officially. I am in perfect accord with the English Secret Service, but we do not wish to have their men seen about the Milan Mansions. To-night, Jules re-enters into possession of his rooms. I offer you an adventure. It is what you wish?\u0027 \n \n \u0027But I thought Jules was interned?\u0027 \n \n \u0027He was and is,\u0027 she told him, \u0027but the greater powers are working. This afternoon he will be permitted to escape—he thinks through the agency of friends. He will come to London in a motor-car, he will come at once to his rooms, and, although every inch of them has been searched, I am perfectly convinced that somewhere in them or between them and the Milan, he will lay his hands upon the formula. You care about this adventure?\u0027 \n \n His eyes flashed. \n \n \u0027Care about it!\u0027 he repeated enthusiastically. \n \n She smiled and rose to her feet. \n \n \u0027Leave me now,\u0027 she begged. \u0027I want to speak to one of those men for a minute. You can dine with me in the Grill-room at the Milan at seven o\u0027clock, in morning clothes. Till then, au revoir!\u0027 \n \n ***** \n \n The spirit of adventure warmed Lavendale\u0027s blood that night. He ordered his dinner with unusual care, and he was delighted to find his guest sufficiently human to appreciate the delicacies he had chosen and the vintage of the champagne which he had selected. Their conversation was entirely general, almost formal. They had both lived for some time in Paris and found mutual acquaintances there. As they neared the conclusion of the meal she was summoned to the telephone. She was absent only for a short time but when she returned she began to collect her few trifles. \n \n \u0027The car passed through Slough,\u0027 she said, \u0027a quarter of an hour ago. I think perhaps we had better be moving.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale signed his bill and they left the hotel together. \n \n \u0027Nothing else you think you ought to tell me, I suppose?\u0027 he remarked, as they crossed the narrow street. \u0027I am rather in the dark, you know. The idea is, isn\u0027t it, that Jules is coming up to get the formula from some hiding-place in his room? Where shall we be?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Wait,\u0027 she begged. \n \n They climbed the stairs in silence—the girl had purposely avoided the lift. Arrived on the third floor, she passed the door of number thirty-two and knocked softly at the adjoining one. There was, for a moment, no answer. At the second summons, however, the door was cautiously opened. The untidy secretary admitted them. In her soiled black dress, shapeless and crumpled, with her fat, peevish face and dishevelled peroxidized hair, she was by no means an attractive object. She pointed half indignantly to where Mr. Somers-Keyne was lying upon the couch, gazing towards them in incapable silence with a fatuous smile upon his lips. \n \n \u0027If it\u0027s from you he gets the money for this sort of thing,\u0027 she said sharply, \u0027why, I wish you\u0027d keep it, and that\u0027s straight. How are we to get on with our work or anything, with him in that condition?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Scondition\u0027sh all right,\u0027 Mr. Somers-Keyne insisted, making a weak effort to rise. \n \n Miss de Freyne frowned for a moment as she appreciated the situation. Then she waved him back. \n \n \u0027Don\u0027t try to get up, Mr. Somers-Keyne, she begged. \u0027We can manage without you. Lie down and rest for a little time.\u0027 \n \n Mr. Somers-Keyne sank back with a sigh of content. \n \n \u0027Very shorry,\u0027 he murmured. \u0027Tree\u0027sh awfully annoyed with me. Promished go down and shee him sh\u0027evening.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Is this fellow one of your helpers?\u0027 Lavendale asked. \n \n She nodded. \n \n \u0027In a small way. Never mind, we don\u0027t need him to-night. Come here.\u0027 \n \n She led him to the side of the wall nearest the adjoining apartment. Her fingers felt about the pattern of the paper. Presently she found a crack, pushed for a moment and a sliding door rolled back. She stretched out her hand through the darkness and turned a small knob. A wardrobe door swung outwards. They looked into the shadowy obscurity of the adjoining room. Lavendale whistled softly. \n \n \u0027This is all very well,\u0027 he said, \u0027but how can we watch Jules whilst the door is closed?\u0027 \n \n She pointed to two or three little ventilation holes near the top of the wardrobe. Lavendale applied his eye to one of them and nodded. \n \n \u0027That\u0027s all right,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027There\u0027s just enough light. Listen!\u0027 \n \n They could both of them hear the quick, eager footsteps of a man lightly shod, stealthy, ascending the last flight of stairs. Her fingers gripped his arm for a moment. An excitement more poignant than any begotten by their hazardous adventure suddenly thrilled him. The greatest adventure of all was at hand.... \n \n The footsteps paused, the door slowly opened. It was Jules who entered. He stood looking around for a moment, then unexpectedly fingered the switch which stood upon the wall. The apartment was flooded with light. Jules stood in the centre of it, distinctly visible. He was paler even than usual, and his eyes were a little sunken, but he had lost, somehow or other, that bearing of graceful servility which had distinguished him in his former avocation. An expression of subdued cunning had taken its place. He looked around the apartment searchingly. His eyes rested for a moment upon a small print at the further end of the room, which was hanging upon the wall in a crooked position. As his eyes fell upon it, he frowned. He seemed suddenly to stiffen into a new attention. He glanced once more around him as though in fear and picked up his overcoat from the bed. Before they could realize what his intentions were, he had left the room, closing the door behind him. \n \n \u0027What does that mean?\u0027 Lavendale whispered. \n \n She pushed open the wardrobe door. A little breath of fresher air was grateful to both of them. Then she turned and pointed towards the opposite wall. \n \n \u0027It was that print,\u0027 she murmured. \u0027It must have been a signal to him that he was being watched. You see, it is on one side. I am perfectly certain that when I was here this morning it was straight.\u0027 \n \n \u0027A signal from whom?\u0027 \n \n She had no time to answer him. They could hear the door of the next room open. Their eyes met. \n \n \u0027Mr. Somers-Keyne!\u0027 he exclaimed. \n \n They stepped back into the wardrobe. Her fingers felt for the spring. Suddenly they both heard, within a few inches of them, on the other side of the wall, the sound of a click. She pressed the spring in vain. Then she stepped back and turned on the electric light in the room. \n \n \u0027Try the door,\u0027 she whispered. \n \n Lavendale tried it. As they both expected, it was locked. She drew a master-key from her pocket and opened it swiftly. They were out in the corridor now, empty and silent. They could not even hear the sound of any one moving about in Mr. Somers-Keyne\u0027s room. Lavendale stood before the latter\u0027s door and listened. There was a mumbling as though of smothered voices, then suddenly an angry exclamation. \n \n \u0027Sick of the lot of you, that\u0027s what I am! Here\u0027s the old man dictates his rubbish for about an hour a day and talks drivelling, drunken piffle for the rest of it! Where\u0027s my salary coming from, that\u0027s what I want to know?\u0027 \n \n They heard Jules apparently trying to soothe her. \n \n \u0027My dear Miss Brown, in a few days, if you will only be patient——\u0027 \n \n \u0027Patient! Who\u0027s going to be patient with that old drunkard blithering around all the time? I\u0027ve had enough!\u0027 \n \n They heard the sound of stamping footsteps and Mr. Somers-Keyne\u0027s sonorous voice. \n \n \u0027Flora, my dear, mosht unreasonable, I\u0027m sure. Shimply asked you go out for a few minutes while Mr. Jules and I dishcuss important matter.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And I\u0027m going out for a minute,\u0027 Miss Brown shouted, suddenly opening the door, \u0027and you may thank your stars when you see me again!\u0027 \n \n She appeared upon the threshold, holding a slatternly hat upon her head with one hand and sticking hatpins in with the other. She stared insolently at Lavendale and his companion, and brushed her way past them. \n \n \u0027Here\u0027s visitors for you,\u0027 she called out over her shoulder. \u0027You\u0027ll have to get rid of them now before you start on your precious business.\u0027 \n \n She flopped down the stairs. The newcomers stepped across the threshold. Jules stared at them in surprise. Mr. Somers-Keyne nodded his head ponderously. His mind seemed to be still running upon Miss Brown\u0027s departure. \n \n \u0027A mosht ungrateful young woman,\u0027 he declared. \u0027Mish—er—de Freyne, your shervant. Thish gentleman is the tenant of the roomsh you looked over other day. Mr. Lavendale, don\u0027t like you. Don\u0027t want you here. Ashked me questions about you, Mish de Freyne. Not a nice young man at all. You lishen to me a moment.\u0027 \n \n He staggered to his feet. Jules stood in the background. There was something of the old obsequiousness about his manner. Mr. Somers-Keyne swayed for a moment upon his feet. Then Lavendale felt a sudden inspiration. He turned on his heel. \n \n \u0027Excuse me for one moment,\u0027 he whispered to the girl by his side. \n \n He turned away with no show of haste, though the eyes of both men seemed to follow him. Then he ran down the stairs on tiptoe, taking them three at a time as he neared the ground floor. The motor-car was drawn up outside, there was no sign of any one else in the street. He sprang to the other side of the way and saw at once the object of his pursuit, hurrying down towards the Embankment. He followed her as stealthily as possible. Without looking around she increased her own pace, crossed the Embankment and leaned for a moment over the wall. A few yards further on were the steps and a little pier, and close by a small tug was waiting. Lavendale, who was within reach of her now, stretched out his hand and seized her shoulder. \n \n \u0027I want you, Miss Brown!\u0027 he exclaimed. \n \n She turned and confronted him, her face mottled and flushed with the unusual exercise, a strand of her unwholesome-looking hair hanging down to her shoulder. \n \n \u0027Now what\u0027s wrong with you?\u0027 she shouted. \u0027Can\u0027t you leave me alone? I\u0027m not coming back.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Where are you going?\u0027 he asked. \n \n \u0027That\u0027s none of your business,\u0027 she snapped. \u0027Let me pass.\u0027 \n \n He glanced at the tug and his hand closed upon her wrist. He was a strong man, but she almost succeeded in wrenching herself free. \n \n \u0027Look here, Miss Brown,\u0027 he said, \u0027the game\u0027s up. I want that paper you\u0027re keeping for Jules.\u0027 \n \n She suddenly showed her teeth. Her face was like the face of a wild animal. She struggled so violently that they swayed towards the parapet. Her left hand slipped into the bosom of her gown. Before he could stop her, her fingers were making pulp of the paper which she had drawn up in crushed fragments. She threw it over the parapet into the black water. Then she ceased to struggle. She laughed hysterically and leaned back against the wall. The water near where the fragments of paper had fallen was all churned up—the little tug had hurried off. \n \n \u0027Clever, ain\u0027t you?\u0027 she mocked. \u0027Any need to hold on to me any more?\u0027 \n \n He released her wrist. The car had come thundering down the little street. It suddenly pulled up with a grinding of brakes. Suzanne sprang lightly out. \n \n \u0027The formula?\u0027 she cried. \n \n He pointed downwards to the water. \n \n \u0027Destroyed!\u0027 \n \n Her sigh was almost one of relief. \n \n \u0027Was there a tug here?\u0027 she asked eagerly. \n \n He nodded. \n \n \u0027It made off when they saw us struggling.\u0027 \n \n \u0027He told the truth, then!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027Jules shot himself as soon as he realized that the game was up—there in the room before me, a few minutes ago. He told me with his last breath that the formula was on its way down the river to Germany.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale smiled grimly. \n \n \u0027It\u0027s on its way down the river, right enough,\u0027 he assented, \u0027but I don\u0027t think it will reach Germany.\u0027 \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1900/54741.html","bookId":924,"book":{"id":924,"title":"Ambrose Lavendale, Diplomat","description":"简介： It was a few minutes after one o\u0027clockthe busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in London.
