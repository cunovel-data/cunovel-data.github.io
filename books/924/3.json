{"id":36491,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III A DEAL WITH NIKO","content":"Lavendale paused in the act of struggling with his tie, and looked steadfastly into the mirror in front of him. He had heard no definite sound, yet some queer intuition seemed to have suddenly awakened within his subconscious mind a sense of the mysterious, something close at hand, unaccountable, minatory. His flat was empty and the catch of the front door secure, yet he knew very well that he was being watched. He turned slowly around. \u0027What the mischief——\u0027 He broke off in his sentence. A small man, dressed in black clothes, imperturbable, yellow-skinned, and with Oriental type of features, was standing to attention, a clothes-brush in his hand. His dark, oval eyes rested for a moment upon the crumpled failure of Lavendale\u0027s tie. Without a word he took another from an open drawer, came softly across the room and reached upwards. Before Lavendale knew what was happening, the bow which had been worrying him for the last five minutes was faultlessly tied. He glanced into the mirror and was compelled to give vent to a little exclamation of satisfaction. \u0027That\u0027s all very well, you know,\u0027 he said, turning once more around. \u0027The tie\u0027s all right, but who the devil are you, and what are you doing in my rooms?\u0027 The man bowed. Again the Oriental seemed to assert itself in the subtle ease with which he almost prostrated himself. \u0027Sir,\u0027 he explained, \u0027I am the friend of your servant Perkins.\u0027 \u0027Then perhaps you can tell me where on earth Perkins is?\u0027 Lavendale demanded. \u0027He is in the hospital, sir,\u0027 the man answered. \u0027He met with a slight accident while he and I were together. I am his messenger. I undertook to bring you news of him and to do what I could, in my poor way, to fill his place for this evening. He lent me his key. It was in that manner I was able to gain entrance here.\u0027 \u0027An accident?\u0027 Lavendale repeated. \u0027What sort of an accident?\u0027 \u0027I chose an idle word, perhaps,\u0027 the other confessed. \u0027It was indeed more a matter of sudden illness. Perkins and I lunched together at the Chinese Restaurant in Piccadilly Circus. As we left the place, he faltered; he fainted in the passage. I called a taxicab and took him to the hospital. It was not a great affair, they said, but it was better that he should rest there. So I came to you.\u0027 \u0027And who the dickens may you be?\u0027 \u0027My name is Niko. I came from Japan with General Kinish, military attaché to the Japanese Embassy. He has gone to the Italian Front and left me without a situation.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re all right at ties, any way,\u0027 Lavendale admitted, glancing once more into the mirror. \u0027All the same, I think I can get along without a man until Perkins comes back.\u0027 His hands sought his trousers pockets but Niko shook his head gravely. \u0027It is impossible,\u0027 he protested. \u0027Perkins may be away for a week. I shall wait upon you until he returns. It is best.\u0027 \u0027Well, have it your own way,\u0027 Lavendale remarked. \u0027Better answer that bell, then. If it is a lady, show her into the sitting-room.\u0027 Niko glided away and returned in a moment. \u0027The lady,\u0027 he announced, \u0027is in the sitting-room.\u0027 He held up Lavendale\u0027s coat and the latter hastened from the room. Suzanne de Freyne was standing facing the door as he entered, her theatre cloak thrown back. He took her hands. \u0027You are adorably punctual!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027Tell me,\u0027 she asked, a little abruptly, \u0027how long have you had your valet?\u0027 \u0027About five minutes, I believe,\u0027 he answered. \u0027He is a substitute. My own man was taken ill at luncheon-time. Why do you ask?\u0027 \u0027Because he is the first person,\u0027 she explained, \u0027who has succeeded in puzzling me in one particular way since I can remember.\u0027 He looked at her as though for an explanation, and in a moment she continued. \u0027I flatter myself that I never forget a face. Your valet is perfectly well-known to me and yet I cannot tell you who he is.\u0027 Lavendale glanced uneasily towards the door. \u0027I shan\u0027t keep him,\u0027 he said. \u0027I hate prejudices, but I am full of them. The fellow\u0027s a Jap, of course.\u0027 Suzanne did not reply for a moment. Her attention seemed to have suddenly wandered. Then she turned around with a little laugh. \u0027I am hungry, my friend!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027Let us go. And yet, remember this. Temporary servants are bad things for people who follow our profession.\u0027 They left the room. Niko was standing with the front door wide open, his master\u0027s hat and gloves in his hand. \u0027I will be here at seven o\u0027clock in the morning, sir,\u0027 he promised, \u0027and bring news of Perkins.\u0027 Lavendale nodded. The door was closed softly behind them. At the bottom of the stairs he glanced up. \u0027Wish I could get rid of the ridiculous idea I have about that fellow,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027Is there anything in your rooms of particular—I will not say value, I will say interest?\u0027 she inquired. \u0027I suppose I have the usual amount of valuables,\u0027 he admitted, \u0027but Perkins is a very careful servant, and I am sure he would never have sent any one who wasn\u0027t reliable. As regards my papers and that sort of thing, they are all locked up in a safe with a combination lock.\u0027 She did not pursue the subject and it faded quickly from Lavendale\u0027s mind. They dined in a quiet corner at the Milan and they talked of many things, chiefly the war. \u0027Do you realize,\u0027 he asked her, towards the end of their meal, \u0027that you are still a complete mystery to me?\u0027 She nodded affably. \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027You know what I mean, of course,\u0027 he went on. \u0027Three weeks ago we joined hands for a moment. We were—may I not use the word?—associates. We were not, perhaps, completely successful in our enterprise, but at least we prevented that marvellous secret from ever reaching an enemy\u0027s hands. Then you disappeared. I heard nothing from you until your voice startled me down the telephone to-night—you want to dine with me. Well, I am your slave and here I am, but tell me, where have you been all this time?\u0027 \u0027In France,\u0027 she answered. \u0027And what have you been doing?\u0027 \u0027Attending to my own business.\u0027 \u0027And what is that?\u0027 he asked coolly. She raised her eyebrows but her air of offence was obviously assumed. She lit a cigarette and watched the smoke for a minute. He was absorbed in the study of her hands—her unusually firm yet delicate fingers, ringless save for one large, quaintly-cut emerald. \u0027In my life,\u0027 she said, \u0027I have no confidants.\u0027 \u0027That seems a pity,\u0027 he replied. \u0027We might be useful to one another.\u0027 \u0027I am not so sure,\u0027 she answered thoughtfully. \u0027For instance, although we speak together in English, my soul is French. I am for France and France only. England is our very dear ally. England is a splendid and an honourable nation, but it is France\u0027s future welfare in which I am concerned, and not England\u0027s. You, on the other hand, are Saxon. England and America, after all, are very close together.\u0027 \u0027Greatest mistake of your life,\u0027 he assured her. \u0027I have a great respect for England and a great liking for English people, and I believe that she was dragged into this war without wanting it, but, on the other hand, as I told you once before, I am for America and America only. England has asked for what she is getting for a good many years. If even she gets a good hiding it won\u0027t do her any harm.\u0027 \u0027But America is so far outside,\u0027 she observed. \u0027Don\u0027t you make any mistake,\u0027 he answered promptly. \u0027The world grows smaller, year by year. The America of fifty years ago has become impossible to-day. We have our political interests in every country, and, however slow and unwilling we may be to take up our responsibilities, we\u0027ve got to come into line with the other great Powers and use the same methods.\u0027 \u0027You may be right,\u0027 she confessed. \u0027Very well, then, you are for America and I am for France. Now tell me, as between Germany and England how are your sympathies?\u0027 \u0027With England, without a doubt,\u0027 he pronounced. \u0027Mind, I am not a rabid anti-German. I am not in the least sure that a nation with the great genius for progress that Germany has shown is not to some extent justified by taking up the sword to hew a larger place in the world for her own people. But that does not affect my answer to your question. My sympathies are with England.\u0027 She flicked the ash from her cigarette. She was looking a little languidly across the room towards a table set against the wall. \u0027If your sympathy were a little stronger,\u0027 she remarked quietly, \u0027I could show you how to render England an incalculable service.\u0027 \u0027Tell me how?\u0027 \u0027First of all,\u0027 she continued, \u0027look at those three men and tell me what you think of them?\u0027 He turned a little in his place and glanced towards the table which she had indicated. One of the three men who were seated at it was obviously a foreigner. His hair was grey towards the temples, although his moustache was almost jet-black; his cheek-bones were high, his teeth a little prominent. He wore evening clothes of the most correct cut, his shirt and links were unexceptionable. His two companions were men of a different stamp. The one who seemed to dominate the party was a huge man, clean-shaven, with puffy face and small eyes. He wore a dark flannel suit of transatlantic cut. He was drinking a large whisky and soda and smoking a cigar, and had apparently eaten nothing. His companion was of smaller build, with flaxen moustache and hair, and dressed in light grey clothes and yellow boots. On the face of it, the trio were ill-assorted. \u0027Well, I should say,\u0027 Lavendale remarked, \u0027that the dark man in the corner chair was a foreigner—a Russian, for choice. The other two are, of course, American business men. The face of the big man seems familiar to me.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve probably seen his picture in the illustrated papers,\u0027 she told him. \u0027That is Jacob P. Weald. He was once called, I believe, the powder king.\u0027 Lavendale nodded. His manner had become more interested. \u0027Of course,\u0027 he murmured. \u0027And that\u0027s Jenkins, the secretary to the Weald Company. I wonder who the third man is?\u0027 \u0027His name is Ossendorf—the Baron Cyril Ossendorf. He is a persona grata at the Russian Embassy and he owns great estates in Poland.\u0027 \u0027Stop!\u0027 Lavendale exclaimed. \u0027This is getting interesting. He is buying munitions, of course.\u0027 \u0027Marvellous!\u0027 she murmured. \u0027Don\u0027t chaff me—it\u0027s really interesting.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 she admitted, \u0027it is interesting even from its external point of view. You are right. The Baron is probably giving, or has given, an enormous order for ammunition. Yet there is something behind that little conference, if only we could probe it, more interesting than you would believe, my friend.\u0027 She paused. He waited eagerly, but she was silent for an unusually long time. \u0027You were suggesting,\u0027 he ventured to remind her, \u0027a few minutes ago, that there was some way in which intervention——\u0027 She leaned a little towards him. Her hand rested for a second upon his. \u0027I have come to the conclusion,\u0027 she said, speaking very softly, \u0027that one of us, either you or I, must kill Ossendorf.\u0027 He began to laugh and then stopped suddenly. A little shiver ran through him. For a single second her face was almost the face of a tigress. He felt that his laugh was a mistake. \u0027You are in earnest!\u0027 he muttered. She rose from the table, gathered up her belongings and allowed him to arrange her cloak about her shoulders. \u0027Except that I retract that possible alternative,\u0027 she said calmly. \u0027I shall deal with Ossendorf myself.\u0027 \u0027But I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 he persisted. \u0027How should you?\u0027 she answered, smiling. \u0027By the by, where are we going? We spoke of a music hall, didn\u0027t we?\u0027 \u0027I have a box at the Empire,\u0027 he told her. She was stepping by him into the taxi when she suddenly paused. Her frame seemed to become rigid. \u0027The Empire,\u0027 he told the driver. She turned suddenly around. \u0027Your rooms,\u0027 she directed. \u0027Tell him to drive at once to your rooms.\u0027 He was startled, but he obeyed her without hesitation. A moment later he took his place by her side. \u0027That valet of yours!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027What about him?\u0027 \u0027I told you that I knew his face. I have just remembered.\u0027 \u0027Well?\u0027 \u0027A year ago he was an attaché at the Japanese Embassy. His name is Baron Komashi.\u0027 Lavendale was mystified. \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 he asked incredulously. \u0027Perfectly certain,\u0027 she insisted. \u0027But why on earth should he be a friend of Perkins and willing to act as my valet?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s the eternal game,\u0027 she declared, \u0027and they are clever at it, too, the Japs. Tell me, have you any papers of special value about just now?\u0027 \u0027Yes, in my safe,\u0027 he admitted, \u0027but no one else has an idea of the combination.\u0027 \u0027Combination!\u0027 she scoffed. \u0027Niko Komashi, too! Tell me, are these papers political which you have inside that safe?\u0027 \u0027In a measure, yes!\u0027 he assented. They had reached the street in which his rooms were situated. \u0027There is no light in my room,\u0027 he said, as they ascended the stairs. \u0027Niko must have done his work and gone home.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 she murmured, \u0027he has done his work, without a doubt. He has a knack of doing that.\u0027 Lavendale produced his latch-key. The rooms appeared to be empty and in darkness. In the sitting-room he unlocked his safe and peered in. One by one he examined his papers. Everything was in perfect order. He turned back to his companion. \u0027Nothing has been disturbed,\u0027 he announced confidently. She came over towards him, put her head for a moment inside the safe and immediately withdrew it. \u0027Niko has been through these papers during your absence,\u0027 she declared. \u0027If everything is there, it is because he had no need to steal. He has examined or made copies of what he chose.\u0027 \u0027How do you know this?\u0027 he asked incredulously. \u0027It is quite simple,\u0027 she explained. Even the cleverest man in the world seems always to forget one thing. Niko forgot that his clothes and fingers, even his breath, have always that peculiar Oriental perfume. What is it like—half almond-blossom, half sandalwood?\u0027 \u0027I remember I noticed it when he came in,\u0027 Lavendale agreed quickly. \u0027Put your head inside that safe again,\u0027 she directed. He obeyed at once. When he emerged, his face was troubled. He locked the door mechanically. \u0027You are right,\u0027 he said. They were silent for a moment. Lavendale was contemplating the lock in a dazed manner. He turned to Suzanne. She had seated herself in his easy-chair and had thrown back her cloak. \u0027You were going to tell me,\u0027 he reminded her, \u0027about this fellow Niko. You had an idea about him.\u0027 \u0027Mine is no idea,\u0027 she replied. \u0027It is a certainty. The man who posed this evening as your temporary valet, the man who in your absence has opened your safe, why, it is Baron Niko Komashi. He belongs to one of the most aristocratic families of Japan.\u0027 \u0027But he is a member of the Servants\u0027 Club!\u0027 Lavendale expostulated. \u0027He was a friend of Perkins—my servant!\u0027 \u0027Ostensibly,\u0027 she said dryly. \u0027He came over here as first secretary to the Embassy. Then he disappeared. No one quite knew what had become of him. I once had a suspicion. Now I know. You and I, my friend, are bunglers at the game he plays.\u0027 Once more Lavendale was looking at the lock—unscratched, bearing so signs of having been tampered with. \u0027The thing is a miracle,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027Tell me—unless you would rather not,\u0027 she asked, leaning a little forward, \u0027was there any document in that safe likely to be of particular interest to the Japanese Secret Service?\u0027 Lavendale\u0027s face was dark with mingled shame and humiliation. \u0027There was just the one document that should have been kept from them at all costs,\u0027 he declared bitterly. \u0027Two years ago I wrote a series of articles for an American Sunday paper upon our military unpreparedness. I don\u0027t know that they did any particular good, but, anyway, it\u0027s a subject I have studied closely. That paper I had my fingers on just now contains every possible scrap of information as to our standing army, our volunteer forces, our artillery, our possible scheme of defence on the west and the east, our stock of munitions, and our expenditure of same per thousand men. There was also an air and naval report and a scheme for mining San Francisco Harbour.\u0027 She leaned back in her chair and laughed. \u0027Most interesting! I can quite understand how Niko\u0027s eyes would gleam! ... What\u0027s that?\u0027 She turned her head suddenly. Lavendale, too, had started, and with a swift movement forward had touched the switch and plunged the room into darkness. They heard the soft click of the latch and the opening and closing of the front door. They heard the soft footsteps of the intruder across the hall. The door of the room in which they were was quietly opened and closed. Still with that same amazing stealthiness, a small, dark figure crossed the room and stood before the safe. Then there was a pause, several breathless moments of silence. Niko\u0027s instinct was telling him that he was not alone. Once more Lavendale\u0027s finger touched the switch and the lights blazed out. Niko was standing, the knob of the safe in his hand, his head turned towards them. The sudden light had a common effect upon all of them. Suzanne for a moment held her hand in front of her eyes. Niko blinked slightly. Then he drew himself up to his full height of five feet four. He stood in front of the safe with his eyes fixed upon Lavendale, something about his face and attitude bearing a curious resemblance to a statue carved in wax. Lavendale coughed. \u0027You remind me, Baron Komashi,\u0027 he said, \u0027of an old English proverb—the pitcher that goes once too often to the well, you know. Was it something you had forgotten that brought you back? No, stay where you are, please.\u0027 Niko remained motionless. Lavendale moved to a long, open cupboard which stood against the wall, opened it and groped about amongst its contents for a moment. Then he swung the door to and slipped some cartridges into the little revolver which he had taken from the top shelf. Niko\u0027s muscles suddenly seemed to relax. Ever so slightly he shrugged his shoulders. It was the gesture of a supreme philosophy. \u0027There\u0027s no need for a row,\u0027 Lavendale went on. \u0027The game you and I are playing at, Baron Komashi, requires finesse rather than muscle. By a stroke of genius you have read a certain document in that safe. That document is naturally of interest to the representative of the one country with whom America might possibly quarrel.\u0027 Niko bowed his sleek head. \u0027I have read the document,\u0027 he confessed. \u0027It was my business here to read it. And now?\u0027 \u0027There you have me,\u0027 Lavendale admitted. \u0027It is a document, without a doubt, of great interest to you, and your Government will highly appreciate a résumé of its contents. At the same time, the only way to stop your making use of your information is to kill you.\u0027 The man\u0027s face was like the face of a sphinx. Suzanne leaned a little further back in her chair and crossed her legs. \u0027It is a fortunate century in which you pursue your career, Baron,\u0027 she observed, \u0027and perhaps a fortunate country. These little qualms about human life which I can clearly see are influencing Mr. Lavendale, scarcely exist, even now, amongst your people, do they?\u0027 \u0027We are as yet,\u0027 Niko replied suavely, \u0027free, I am thankful to say, from the cowardice of the west.\u0027 \u0027If I asked you for your word of honour,\u0027 Lavendale continued, \u0027that you would not use that information? \u0027I might give it you,\u0027 Niko acknowledged, \u0027but my country\u0027s service is a higher thing than my personal honour, therefore it would do you no good. I shall be frank with you. There is no way you can prevent my report being duly made except by killing me. I am here, a self-confessed robber. If I were in your place, I should shoot.\u0027 \u0027The cowardice of the west, you see,\u0027 Lavendale remarked, throwing his revolver upon the table. \u0027You had better get out of the room. I might change my mind.\u0027 For a moment Niko made no movement. Suzanne rose to her feet and lit a cigarette. \u0027As a matter of curiosity,\u0027 she asked, \u0027tell us why you returned, Baron?\u0027 He bowed. \u0027The Empire performance is not over until half-past eleven,\u0027 he explained, \u0027and it is barely ten o\u0027clock. I had some faint misgivings as to the resetting of the lock. I came back to examine it. That is my answer. You speak now of curiosity. I, too, have curiosity. Will you tell me how you knew that I had opened the safe?\u0027 She smiled and lifted her handkerchief for a moment to her lips. Niko\u0027s head was bent as though in humiliation. \u0027It is so hard to outgrow one\u0027s errors,\u0027 he sighed. He looked towards Lavendale and Lavendale pointed impatiently towards the door. He took a step or two in that direction, then he paused. \u0027Sir,\u0027 he said, looking back, \u0027because your methods are not mine, believe me that I still can appreciate their mistaken chivalry. The information I have gained I shall use. No promise of mine to the contrary would avail you. But there is, perhaps, some return which I might offer, more valuable, perhaps, to mademoiselle, yet of some import to you also.\u0027 Suzanne leaned a little forward. Her cigarette burnt idly between her fingers. \u0027In this great conflict,\u0027 Niko continued, \u0027whose reverberations shake the earth, Japan watches from afar off. There are few who know the reason, but there is a reason. Let that pass. My country lays no seal upon my lips. What I know I pass on to you. A hundred million cartridges and five thousand tons of heavier ammunition, which might otherwise have reached Russia, are lying now at the bottom of the ocean. This is the doing of one man, a man in the pay of Germany, a man who is the greatest traitor the world has ever known.\u0027 \u0027Ossendorf!\u0027 Suzanne cried. Niko bowed and moved towards the door. \u0027Mademoiselle has suspected, perhaps,\u0027 he concluded. \u0027It is I who can assure her that her suspicions are just. The greatest plant in America is kept producing munitions by day and night, bought with Russian gold but never meant to reach their destination. It is well?\u0027 He looked at Lavendale, his hand upon the door. Lavendale nodded curtly. \u0027It is well,\u0027 he said. ***** Mr. Jacob P. Weald smoothed out the document which he had been examining and drew a deep sigh of satisfaction. \u0027Say, Ed,\u0027 he remarked, turning to his secretary, who was smoking a cigar at the other end of the room, \u0027that\u0027s worth a cool million apiece for us, that contract.\u0027 \u0027Hope there\u0027s no hitch,\u0027 the other replied anxiously. \u0027What\u0027s this young fellow from the Embassy want?\u0027 \u0027Nothing to hurt us,\u0027 Weald assured him. \u0027We\u0027re all right with the authorities all round. I\u0027m glad, Ed, we did the square thing. We\u0027ve had it straight from the British War Office to go right along ahead and give Russia everything we can turn out. Well, Russia\u0027s going to have it, and, by gum, there\u0027s enough ammunition provided for in that contract to make mincemeat of the whole German Army!\u0027 There was a knock at the door of the sitting-room and a servant announced Mr. Ambrose Lavendale. Lavendale, following closely behind, shook hands at once with the two men. \u0027I\u0027ve heard of your plant, Mr. Weald,\u0027 he said pleasantly. \u0027Wonderful things you\u0027ve been doing in the way of producing ammunition, they tell me. Been unlucky some with your shipments, though, haven\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s so,\u0027 the other admitted, \u0027but that\u0027s not our fault. We don\u0027t come in there. Our friends have their own steamships, eleven of them, bought for the job.\u0027 \u0027Lost two out of three already, haven\u0027t they?\u0027 Lavendale remarked. \u0027Say, you seem some wise, young man,\u0027 Mr. Weald said pleasantly. \u0027However, I got the note from the boss. What can we do for you?\u0027 \u0027A very small thing,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027I understand that Baron Ossendorf is coming here to sign that contract at twelve o\u0027clock.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re dead right, sir,\u0027 Mr. Weald admitted, \u0027and there\u0027s a magnum of the best standing there in the ice, waiting for the psychological moment.\u0027 \u0027Mind my being present and asking him one question—just one?\u0027 Lavendale inquired. \u0027We ain\u0027t likely to object to anything you want to do, young fellow,\u0027 Mr. Weald assured him. \u0027Ed Jenkins there—he\u0027s secretary of the company—and I, have got no crooked ideas about this business. We are going to bring a few million dollars into our own pockets, but we are going to do it on the straight. What our Ambassador over here says, goes, and his note asks us to take you into this.\u0027 There was a knock at the door. Ossendorf was announced and promptly entered. He held out a hand each to Weald and Jenkins. Then he glanced inquiringly at Lavendale. \u0027This is a young friend of ours from the American Embassy,\u0027 Mr. Weald explained. \u0027Mr. Ambrose Lavendale—Baron Ossendorf. He\u0027s a kind of witness that all\u0027s right and above-board.\u0027 Baron Ossendorf bowed and held out his long, elegantly-shaped hand. \u0027I am delighted, Mr. Lavendale,\u0027 he said, \u0027delighted that you should be a participator in our little business this morning. Between Russia and America there have always been the most cordial sentiments of friendship. It is a pleasure to us to think that we are able, at these terrible times, to be of service to one another.... You have the contract, Mr. Weald? Ah!\u0027 he added, glancing at it through his eyeglass, \u0027I see that this is the draft which I have already perused. Nothing remains, then, but for me to sign it.\u0027 He dipped his pen in the ink, stooped down and there was a moment\u0027s silence whilst his pen spluttered across the paper. Mr. Weald began to cut the strings of the magnum of champagne. \u0027Just one moment,\u0027 Lavendale interposed. \u0027There is a little condition, Baron, which it is not proposed to put officially into the agreement, a very small matter, but may I suggest it to you?\u0027 Ossendorf turned his head. His eyes had narrowed a little. \u0027By all means, sir.\u0027 \u0027The contract,\u0027 Lavendale continued slowly, \u0027is for the whole production of the Weald Plant for six months, with option of continuance until the end of the war. Shipments are to be made weekly by steamers whose names are given there, steamers practically acquired by the Russian Government.\u0027 \u0027You are well informed, my young friend,\u0027 Ossendorf admitted quietly. \u0027It has been suggested,\u0027 Lavendale said, speaking slowly and looking Ossendorf in the face, \u0027that you should change the wireless operator on all those vessels for a person approved by the British Government.\u0027 There was a moment\u0027s deep silence. Mr. Weald had paused with his knife already pressed against the last string of the bottle. Jenkins was standing with his mouth open, a little dazed. Ossendorf shrank back as though he had received a blow. It was obvious that he retained his composure with an effort. \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 he demanded. \u0027Simply this,\u0027 Lavendale replied firmly. \u0027Already the Iris and the Southern Star, with enough ammunition on board to have supplied an army, have gone to the bottom. I mean, sir, that every one of those remaining nine boats on which is to be packed the whole production of the greatest ammunition plant in America, is doomed to go to the bottom.\u0027 Two great drops of sweat had broken out on Ossendorf\u0027s forehead. His face seemed suddenly to have grown thinner. His mouth was open. He glared at Lavendale, but he was utterly incapable of speech. The latter turned to Weald. \u0027Mr. Weald,\u0027 he said, \u0027this contract for your entire output can be signed within twenty-four hours, either by a representative of Russia other than Baron Ossendorf, or by the secretary of the British Munition Board. This man Ossendorf is a paid traitor—the Judas of the war.\u0027 Mr. Weald was incapable of coherent speech. \u0027You mean,\u0027 Jenkins faltered, \u0027that he is in the pay of Germany?\u0027 \u0027Ask him!\u0027 Lavendale suggested scornfully. Ossendorf seemed to wither up. He staggered to his feet and groped to the door. Suddenly something flashed in his hands, clasped tightly between them. There was a loud report, the room seemed filled with smoke. They all three looked in a dazed manner at the figure stretched upon the carpet, face downwards, the shoulders still twitching slightly. Lavendale stood with his finger upon the bell. \u0027Sorry to have interfered, Mr. Weald,\u0027 he said, \u0027but your stuff\u0027s wanted somewhere else—not at the bottom of the sea.\u0027 ... Ossendorf\u0027s body was carried away. It was very well understood that the matter was to be hushed up. Lavendale lingered with Mr. Weald, who was walking restlessly about the room, still scarcely able to realize what had happened. \u0027Poor devil!\u0027 he kept on muttering. \u0027Poor devil!\u0027 Lavendale laid his hand firmly upon his compatriot\u0027s shoulder. \u0027Look here, Mr. Weald,\u0027 he said, \u0027there are good and bad of every nation—Germans, Americans, English, or French. This man was outside the pale. He was a black and dastardly traitor, the pariah of humanity, he trafficked with the lives of human beings, he was a murderer for gold. If anything, his end was too merciful.\u0027 Mr. Weald nodded reflectively. Lavendale\u0027s words were convincing. His eyes wandered towards the champagne bottle upon the sideboard. He was feeling the strain. \u0027In that case,\u0027 he murmured, \u0027perhaps——\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1900/54742.html","bookId":924,"book":{"id":924,"title":"Ambrose Lavendale, Diplomat","description":"简介： It was a few minutes after one o\u0027clockthe busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in London.
