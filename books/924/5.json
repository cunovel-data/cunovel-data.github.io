{"id":36493,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V SUSCEPTIBLE MR. KESSNER","content":"There was a vigour in her walk, a determination in her face, which made Lavendale pause for an instant before he crossed the street to accost Suzanne de Freyne. It was perfectly clear to him that she was bound upon a serious errand. She was dressed with her usual subdued elegance but with more, even, than her usual simplicity. In her black tailor-made costume, her small hat and neat patent shoes, she looked like the Rue de la Paix at four o\u0027clock in the afternoon during its halcyon days. He was forced to quicken his pace to intercept her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Good morning, Miss de Freyne!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She turned quickly around and held out her left hand. Her greeting was cordial enough, but her air of abstraction did not altogether disappear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where have you been hiding for the last few days?\u0027 she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I came back from Holland last night,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I have been in Germany again.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Any news?\u0027 she asked quickly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nothing very wonderful. I needn\u0027t ask how things are with you. I can tell that you have something on hand. Can I help?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are right in a way, but I don\u0027t think you can help,\u0027 she told him. \u0027This is quite an important morning—it is Celia\u0027s sale.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He was a little staggered. Her manner was convincing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You mean that you are going to a millinery sale?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be silly,\u0027 she answered. \u0027The first morning of Celia\u0027s sale is the most important event of the season. We have printed cards of invitation, and policemen outside the door to keep away intruders. This isn\u0027t any ordinary bargain hunting, you know. This is our one chance to provide ourselves with the elegancies of life at a reasonable cost.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027For the moment, I gather,\u0027 he went on, falling into step with her, \u0027the affairs of the nation are in the background.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Naturally,\u0027 she assented. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027At what hour,\u0027 he inquired, \u0027will this function be over?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She glanced at him suspiciously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If I thought you were making fun——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Never entered into my head,\u0027 he assured her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Then you can give me some lunch at one o\u0027clock,\u0027 she promised. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s exactly what I was hoping for. And, Miss de Freyne?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Would you mind very much if I brought an acquaintance?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She glanced at him in some surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course not,\u0027 she answered, \u0027only it must be a grill-room luncheon, please. I am dressed for a scrimmage.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027At one o\u0027clock at the Milan Grill,\u0027 he told her, raising his hat. \\n\\n \\n\\n He strolled slowly away southwards, crossed Pall Mall, and let himself in by a side entrance to the American Embassy. Here he spent a few minutes in the outer offices and passed on, a little later, into a more private apartment. An elderly man with a clean-shaven face, grey hair brushed back from his forehead, and tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles, looked up from his roll-topped desk and waved his visitor to a seat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hullo, Ambrose! Anything fresh?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale drew up a chair and grasped the hand which the other offered him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There is plenty going on, if one could get to understand it, Mr. Washburn,\u0027 he said. \u0027Berlin had me puzzled.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027When did you get back?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Last night.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027See anything of our friend?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He crossed with me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Get acquainted with him?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh! I knew him before in Washington and in New York,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027I took care to remind him of it, too. Yes, he was quite friendly. All the same, he was secretive. He didn\u0027t tell me the one thing I discovered of the greatest interest in connection with his trip, and that was that the Kaiser sent his private car three hundred miles and met him at the Western Headquarters. They spent the best part of the day together. Has he been in here?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Washburn shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He neither reported before he left, nor has he been in since he got back. Kind of giving us the cold shoulder, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He hasn\u0027t had much time yet,\u0027 Lavendale remarked thoughtfully, \u0027but it certainly doesn\u0027t look exactly like the behaviour of a loyal American.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Washburn turned in his place, removed his spectacles from his eyes and rubbed them carefully with his handkerchief. A slight weariness was apparent in his face and tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s our great trouble, Ambrose,\u0027 he said. \u0027Germany\u0027s a mighty country. She holds her sons in a closer grip than any other nation in the world. A German-American is a German first and an American afterwards, and don\u0027t you forget it. That\u0027s what makes us such a polyglot, indiscriminate race. Are you going to make a report?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not at present,\u0027 Lavendale replied. \u0027I haven\u0027t yet pieced together the scraps I was able to pick up. Let it be for a day or two. What I am anxious to find out is whether Kessner reports here or not, and what account he gives, if any, of his journey to Germany.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll send you word directly he shows up, if he comes at all,\u0027 Mr. Washburn promised. \u0027I hear there are half-a-dozen more of his gang in London.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve some sort of a show on. Kessner as good as admitted it to me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where do you stand with him?\u0027 Mr. Washburn asked curiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m all right up to the present,\u0027 Lavendale asserted. \u0027He believes I went over on a mission about the British prisoners, \u0027and he\u0027s inclined to fancy I may be useful to him. Anyway, he is lunching with me to-day.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Washburn smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If you think you\u0027ll get much out of him, young fellow,\u0027 he said, \u0027I fancy you\u0027re looking for disappointment. The brains that made twenty million in Wall Street and control an organization so secret that we can\u0027t even put a finger upon it——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, I know,\u0027 Lavendale interrupted, rising, \u0027but, you know, there\u0027s always chance to be reckoned with, and I\u0027ve one card up my sleeve, anyway. I know all about him and he doesn\u0027t suspect me yet.\u0027 ... \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Exactly why am I asked to this festive lunch?\u0027 Suzanne de Freyne inquired, as she leaned back upon a settee in the small lounge which led into the Milan grill-room, at a few minutes before one o\u0027clock that morning. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Because I am up against a cul-de-sac,\u0027 Lavendale confessed, \u0027and I want your woman\u0027s wit to show me the way out.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You seem to be taking it for granted that we are allies,\u0027 she remarked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We are to a certain extent,\u0027 he pleaded. \u0027You must admit that a Germanized United States would be bad for you, and that is what we have to fight against.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n A waiter set down two cocktails upon a small table in front of them. She sipped hers deliberately. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Tell me, what is the trouble with this man Kessner?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Of what is it that you really suspect him?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wish I knew,\u0027 Lavendale groaned. \u0027These are the bald facts. Washington and New York, during the last six months, have been the scene of the most desperate efforts of German diplomacy and political manoeuvring, with one sole aim—that of preventing the export of munitions of war to England or France. Money has been spent like water but the progress has been too slow. Germany has gained adherents to her point of view, but not enough. America is in a position to be of immense use to the Allies and none whatever to Germany or Austria, and up to the present she shows no signs of ceasing to supply England and France and Russia with all the munitions she can turn out. The German Party in America have taken stock of these things. They have measured their weakness and tasted defeat. Everything up to this point has been above-board. We understood perfectly well what they were fighting for, and to a certain extent admitted their grievance.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They had no grievance,\u0027 Miss de Freyne interposed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Perhaps not a logical one,\u0027 Lavendale admitted, \u0027but you see it is perfectly true that while they are supplying munitions on an immense scale to the Allies, they are supplying none at all to Germany and Austria. That is, of course, owing to England\u0027s control of the sea, but it is galling to Germany and Austria to know that a neutral country is providing her enemies with the means of waging warfare against her. From their point of view it is not ideal neutrality, is it?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027America is perfectly ready to supply Germany and Austria as well,\u0027 she reminded him. \u0027Besides, Germany and Austria both supplied England during the Boer War.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That, of course, is what makes America\u0027s position logical,\u0027 he went on, \u0027but listen. Kessner and his friends have obviously come to an end of their intriguing in the direction of stopping supplies. They have dropped their newspaper campaign. They have shrugged their shoulders and apparently accepted the inevitable. No one who knows them would believe them capable of anything of the sort. Kessner has been over here for a month. He was in Germany when I was. He spent a week with the Chancellor and a long time with the Kaiser himself. Heyl and both the Hindemanns are over here, too. They have also been in Germany. You see, they are all entitled to call themselves Americans, although they are Germans at heart.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You think that there is some fresh scheme on?\u0027 she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am perfectly certain there is,\u0027 he said firmly. \u0027Not only that, but I have an idea as to its bearing.... This is our friend. If you don\u0027t know him by sight, prepare for a shock.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n A small man, dressed in plain black clothes, with broad-toed shoes and a tie almost clerical in its simplicity, had entered the place and was handing his bowler hat to an attendant. His complexion was sallow, his general air one of complete insignificance. Suzanne watched the greeting between the two with intense interest. It was hard to realize that this was Ludwig Kessner, twenty times a millionaire. \\n\\n \\n\\n The little man\u0027s speech and manners wholly belied his appearance. His assurance was unlimited. He talked easily and with confidence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, young fellow,\u0027 he exclaimed, \u0027so we are back in London, eh? Not late, am I?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not a moment,\u0027 Lavendale assured him. \u0027I want to present you, if I may, to Miss de Freyne, who is lunching with us. Miss de Freyne,\u0027 he added, \u0027this is Mr. Kessner.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She rose with a charming little smile and shook hands with him. Mr. Kessner seemed to see no reason why he should conceal his admiration. He walked close to her side as they entered the luncheon-room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Our young friend and I,\u0027 he remarked, \u0027were hanging over the side of a steamer, looking out for submarines, this time yesterday. Not particularly good for the appetite, that sort of thing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I think it is very brave of you to have really crossed the North Sea,\u0027 Suzanne declared. \u0027I should have been terrified to death.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Business is business,\u0027 Mr. Kessner observed, \u0027and I am something of a fatalist myself. I go about what I have to do and take my chances. Same with Mr. Lavendale, I expect, only these diplomatists are used to it. Troublous times, Miss de Freyne, times such as I never dreamed we should see in our days. By the by, are you French or English?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027French, English, and Austrian,\u0027 she told him, smiling, as they took their places at the table, \u0027so you see I represent neutrality in my own person. My grandmother was Austrian, and I have never been so happy as when I lived in Vienna.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He nodded approvingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do you know,\u0027 he said, \u0027I am glad you are not altogether English. I don\u0027t know which way your sympathies may be in this trouble, and I don\u0027t know as it matters. We each of us have a right to our feelings, whatever they may be. I am an American first and foremost, like our friend here, only he has British blood in his veins behind it, and I have German. We can keep good friends for all that, though.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I think,\u0027 she sighed, \u0027that I am in a most trying position. I adore Austria and I have many relations there. I am very fond of France and I have some good friends in England. I am torn every way. After all, though,\u0027 she went on reflectively, \u0027it cannot be as hard for me as for you. You really are German, are you not, and yet you have to sit still and see America doing an enormous lot to help the Allies.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He glanced at her keenly. Her sincerity was undoubted. Before he replied he looked also at the occupants of the next two tables, young people from the land of musical comedy with their khaki-clad escorts, intellectually negligible. Nevertheless, he lowered his voice a little as he answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are quite right, Miss de Freyne. It is one of the hardest nuts we have to crack, we German-Americans. We are honest and above-board about it, you see. We have worked like slaves to direct the policy of America our own way, and we\u0027ve failed.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is there nothing more you can do?\u0027 she asked earnestly. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a moment\u0027s silence. Mr. Kessner, with his napkin tucked in underneath his chin, was settling down to his luncheon like a man. Nevertheless, he again glanced searchingly at his neighbour. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is hard to see what can be done,\u0027 he said calmly. \u0027I have been in Germany to visit some of my relatives. It is very wonderful to hear them all talk there. There is no pessimism, no doubt whatever, no shadow of misgiving. Germany must win—that is in their hearts. They have not a single doubt. And here in London, whether the people deceive themselves or not, they say the same thing. They go about their business with even more assurance, and they indulge in pleasures far more freely.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Which is going to win?\u0027 she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Neither,\u0027 he replied. \u0027Neither has the preponderance of strength to smash the other. It will be a drawn fight. There will be a period of peace, nominal peace. Germany knows now what she has to face—a world in arms against her. When the next time comes, she will be ready.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There will be a next time, then?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Germany is not yet at the end of her resources,\u0027 he assured her. \u0027There are other ways in which she can make herself felt. But let us leave for a little time these serious subjects. This champagne, I know, my friend Lavendale, is a compliment to me. You English-Americans do not drink champagne in the middle of the day. Believe me, you are wrong. I drink your very good health, Miss de Freyne, and yours, Lavendale. And I drink also,\u0027 he added, his eyes lightening a little as he looked across the room, \u0027the unspoken toast!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He set his glass down empty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There is an unspoken toast close to the heart of all of us, Miss de Freyne,\u0027 he remarked, \u0027one little secret we keep at the back of our thoughts. Now tell me. I sail on Saturday. On Friday night you and our friend Lavendale will give me the honour of your company at dinner, eh? It is arranged. At the Ritz at eight o\u0027clock.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are very kind,\u0027 they both murmured \\n\\n \\n\\n He selected a cigar from a box which had been passed him, and rose a little abruptly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I go to speak with a friend,\u0027 he said—\u0027a matter of business. For your excellent luncheon I thank you very much, and for the privilege of having met Miss de Freyne,\u0027 he added with a little bow, \u0027I thank you even more. Till Friday, then.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He shuffled across the room, an ill-dressed, undignified figure, yet with a confidence which surpassed conceit. They saw him greet a compatriot and seat himself at the latter\u0027s table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That man,\u0027 Lavendale said, as he toyed with his coffee spoon, \u0027has at the back of his head some new scheme. It may not be directed against your people. I have an idea that it is more likely to be directed against mine.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But he is an American himself,\u0027 she protested. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027He is a German-American,\u0027 Lavendale replied, \u0027which means that he is very much a German and very little an American.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Whatever his new scheme may be,\u0027 she sighed, \u0027I do not think that he is disposed to talk about it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Whatever it may be,\u0027 Lavendale replied, \u0027it is my business to find it out. One thing is absolutely certain. No American would receive the attentions of the Kaiser—in war time, too—and come back here without a word to say about it, unless there was something in the background, something he meant to keep secret.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They strolled out into the entrance hall and Lavendale departed in search of his hat. A waiter came hurriedly out to Suzanne\u0027s side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027For madame,\u0027 he whispered, slipping a little note into her hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n Her fingers closed upon it quickly. She glanced around. Lavendale was still talking to some acquaintances. She opened it and read the few hastily pencilled lines:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It would give me a great deal of pleasure to see you again before Friday. I am in flat 74 in the Court here. Shall be alone all this afternoon.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She crumpled up the note in her hand. Lavendale was coming towards her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Can I take you anywhere?\u0027 he asked. \u0027The car will be outside.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She shook her head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t bother about me,\u0027 she said. \u0027I am going up to my room to write some letters.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Come in!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Suzanne turned the handle of number seventy-four, closed the door behind her and entered the sitting-room. Mr. Kessner turned around in his chair from before a mass of papers. He looked at Suzanne for an instant in surprise, an expression which, as he recognized her, changed quickly into one of satisfaction. He rose to his feet and came towards her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This is a great pleasure, my dear young lady,\u0027 he said. \u0027I scarcely dared to hope——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He took her hands, but she evaded him with a little smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You see, we are neighbours almost,\u0027 she explained. \u0027I have an apartment here when I am in London. I thought I would call in and see you on the way to my room. But, please—do you mind?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She pushed him gently away from her. For a moment his face darkened. Then, with a shrug of the shoulders, he threw himself into the easy-chair opposite, a shapeless, ill-dressed little morsel of humanity, with a queer intelligence shining out of his narrowed eyes, suggested, too, in the square forehead and puckered brows. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Listen, young lady,\u0027 he said. \u0027Do you know why I asked you to come and see me?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She raised her eyebrows and laughed at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Because you like me, I hope,\u0027 she replied. \u0027For myself, I love making fresh acquaintances amongst clever men.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Acquaintances?\u0027 he repeated slowly. \\n\\n \\n\\n She nodded several times. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am not one of those,\u0027 she said, \u0027who can gather the whole world in without a pause. I like to make acquaintances. Sometimes an acquaintance may become a friend. Sometimes—but that takes time.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She felt the steely light of his eyes upon her and looked modestly down upon the carpet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 he went on, \u0027there were two reasons why I sent for you. One I think you have surmised, and you keep it there at the back of your pretty little head. The other—well, you are a young person of intelligence and mixed nationality. I thought it possible that you might be of use to me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But in what manner?\u0027 she demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I was frank with you at luncheon-time,\u0027 he said. \u0027You know where my sympathies lie. Yours, I gathered, are divided. Would it be possible, I wonder, to induce you to look my way?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But you yourself admitted,\u0027 she reminded him, \u0027that the cause of Germany in America is lost. What more is there to be done?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Young lady,\u0027 he replied, \u0027the cause of Germany in America may be lost for the moment so far as regards our efforts to induce the present administration to carry into effect an ethical neutrality. But the great source of Germany\u0027s greatness is her capacity for looking ahead. If one cause is lost, then in that day a new one is born. If Germany had not foreseen and prepared for this war for forty years, she would have been crushed to-day. Now we who are her sons in foreign countries, our eyes, too, are fixed upon the future.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Then you have a new scheme,\u0027 she said quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We have a new scheme,\u0027 he admitted, \u0027but what that may be it is not my intention to tell you at present.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She pouted at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course, if you are not going to trust me——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You must not be a foolish child,\u0027 he interrupted. \u0027You would think little of me if I did, and besides,\u0027 he added, rising to his feet, \u0027I am not sure yet that I do trust you. Wait.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He touched the bell. Almost immediately the door of the sitting-room was opened. She gave a little start. An immense coloured man in dark clothes stood respectfully in the doorway. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027George,\u0027 his master directed, \u0027if any one rings, I am engaged. See that I am not disturbed on any pretext.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Very good, Mr. Kessner! \\n\\n \\n\\n The man closed the door with wonderful softness. Even his footsteps, as he retreated into the bedroom, were inaudible. Kessner\u0027s elbow was propped against the mantelpiece, his head supported in his thin, yellow-stained fingers. He looked down at her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If you do not trust me,\u0027 she persisted, \u0027how can I be of help to you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I might put you to the test,\u0027 he said slowly. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was nothing distinctly threatening in his tone, and yet all at once she was afraid. The thought of that black Hercules loitering outside, something in the downward droop of the eyes of this man all the time edging a little nearer to her, seemed suddenly to become terrifying. Nevertheless, she refused to flinch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I do not like riddles,\u0027 she declared. \u0027Perhaps you had better think over more definitely what you want to say to me, before Friday night, or send a note up to my room.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There is no necessity,\u0027 he replied. \u0027What I have to say to you is already quite clear in my mind.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He moved still nearer, stood over the couch by her side. Then the outside bell rang. He paused to listen. Her heart gave a little jump as a familiar voice asked for Mr. Kessner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is Mr. Lavendale!\u0027 she exclaimed under her breath. \u0027Don\u0027t let him find me here!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n His features relaxed. He laughed and patted her hand. She could have said nothing to inspire him with more confidence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course not,\u0027 he replied indulgently. \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid. George would tell him that I was engaged. He had my orders to let no one in.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But I heard him say that he would wait!\u0027 she persisted anxiously. \u0027Cannot I hide somewhere for a moment while you see him and send him away?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n George made a discreet appearance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A gentleman inquiring for you, sir,\u0027 he said. \u0027He is waiting outside in the corridor. I told him that you would be a long time.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Kessner considered for a moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Would you mind stepping into my sleeping apartment?\u0027 he asked Suzanne. \\n\\n \\n\\n She sprang up at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You will get rid of him quickly?\u0027 she begged. \\n\\n \\n\\n He pressed her hand affectionately. She endured his touch without flinching. He handed her over to George and pointed to the door of his room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Give the young lady a chair inside,\u0027 he ordered. \u0027I will see Mr. Lavendale.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She was ushered into a bedroom and a moment or two later she heard Lavendale announced. Then George returned, handed her some American papers and disappeared into the bathroom beyond. She rose to her feet as he closed the door. The sound of Lavendale\u0027s voice was muffled and inaudible. She glanced around the room. It was tastefully but very plainly furnished. There was nothing about on the mantelpiece or bureau likely to be of the slightest interest. Suddenly her heart gave a little jump. George came out of the bathroom with a coat upon his arm, threw open the bureau and searched there for something. As he stood there, a thin, black silk pocket-book slipped from the breast-pocket of the coat and fell unnoticed on to the carpet. A moment later he closed the bureau, laid the coat carefully out upon the bed and withdrew into the bathroom, closing the door. Suzanne held her breath for a single moment. Then she stole across the floor, seized the pocket-book, opened the bedroom door stealthily, and with a little gulp of relief passed out into the corridor. She ran up the stairs to her own room, gripping the pocket-book in her hand. Arrived there, she locked the door, took up the telephone and spoke to the hall-porter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Please don\u0027t let Mr. Lavendale go out,\u0027 she directed. \u0027When he comes downstairs send him up to my room—say that I wish to see him at once.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She slipped the pocket-book into the bosom of her dress and waited. In a few minutes there was a ring at the bell. Lavendale stood outside. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Come in at once,\u0027 she begged. \\n\\n \\n\\n He hesitated, but she dragged him in. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do not be foolish!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027Shut the door. You have just left Mr. Kessner?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he admitted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Why did you go there?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027To see if you were getting yourself into any trouble,\u0027 he answered grimly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You knew?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, I knew!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She drew the pocket-book from the bosom of her gown. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 she said, \u0027I am terrified. I picked this up from the bedroom. It slipped out of the pocket of his dinner-coat. I haven\u0027t even dared to look inside.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He moved to the door and locked it, came back and shook the contents out on to the table. There was a great roll of notes, some visiting cards, some notes copied from a German time-table, a long list of names, and a single letter on thick, cream paper. Suzanne stole to the door on tiptoe and stood there, listening. There was no sound in the corridor, no sound in the apartment at all except a smothered exclamation or two from Lavendale. Presently he called to her. He was holding the papers in his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Miss de Freyne,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027listen.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She caught him by the sleeve. There was a ponderous knocking at the door, the shrill summons of the bell rang through the room. Lavendale hesitated for a moment. Then he slipped the book into his inside pocket and threw open the door. Mr. Kessner\u0027s black servant was standing outside. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The master has sent his compliments,\u0027 he said, \u0027and would be glad to know——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He glanced at Suzanne. It was obvious that Lavendale\u0027s presence in the room embarrassed him. Then he was suddenly pushed on one side and back into the corridor. Mr. Kessner himself came quietly in and closed the door behind him. There was a queer little gleam in his eyes, but his manner was unruffled. He tried the handle of the door to be sure that it was closed. Then he turned towards Suzanne. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Will a million dollars,\u0027 he asked, \u0027buy me back my pocket-book?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale drew it from his pocket and promptly handed it across. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My dear Mr. Kessner,\u0027 he remonstrated, \u0027you are surely not serious! Miss de Freyne was just explaining her little escapade to me and I was coming in search of you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Kessner took no notice of either of them for several moments. He ran through the contents of the pocket-book, then he slowly thrust it into his pocket. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I shall have the pleasure,\u0027 he said, \u0027on Friday night? You will not forget—the Ritz at eight o\u0027clock?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Charmed,\u0027 Lavendale murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Delighted,\u0027 Suzanne faltered. \\n\\n \\n\\n He made a little bow—an ugly, awkward bow—and left the room. There was nothing in his manner to indicate what his sensations were. Lavendale and Suzanne looked at one another. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Was there anything very important there?\u0027 she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n He laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nothing from your point of view, but everything from mine,\u0027 he told her. \u0027There was a list of forty-two names of German-Americans, each giving a million dollars towards a specific purpose. There was a plan of a few remaining estates in a certain part of Brazil, still to be purchased to establish what at some seasonable juncture should be declared to be a German colony. Some slight trouble with the Government of Brazil, a German gunboat, and behold!—German South America and to Hell with the Monroe Doctrine! A very admirable scheme, only——\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Only what?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t fancy that, thanks to you, those estates will ever come into the market,\u0027 he remarked dryly, \u0027not for a German purchaser, at any rate.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She glanced uneasily towards the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Lavendale,\u0027 she said earnestly \u0027I am terrified!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am afraid of Mr. Kessner,\u0027 she confessed. \u0027He took it much too quietly.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Lavendale shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A man of his temperament,\u0027 he said, \u0027seldom wastes his time or his emotions. He was playing for a great stake which he knows now that he will lose. At the same time, he has lost purely through accident.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n She suddenly smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wonder,\u0027 she exclaimed, \u0027whether he really expects us to dine with him at the Ritz on Friday night!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll go and see, at any rate,\u0027 Lavendale declared. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1900/54744.html","bookId":924,"book":{"id":924,"title":"Ambrose Lavendale, Diplomat","description":"简介： It was a few minutes after one o\u0027clockthe busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in London.
