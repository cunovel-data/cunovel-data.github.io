{"id":36496,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII THE UNDENIABLE FORCE","content":"Lavendale drew a deep sigh of content as he withdrew his eyes reluctantly from the glittering phantasmagoria of the city, stretching away below like a fire-spangled carpet. He leaned back in his chair and raised his glass to his lips. \n \n \u0027No doubt about my being an American born, Moreton,\u0027 he observed. \u0027The first night in New York is always a real home-coming to me. And this is New York, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 he went on, musingly, \u0027city of steel and iron, typical, indescribable.\u0027 \n \n Jim Moreton, an erstwhile college friend and now a prosperous lawyer, nodded sympathetically. \n \n \u0027We are right in the heart of things here,\u0027 he assented. \u0027Nothing like a roof garden round about Broadway, to see us at home. I wonder whether you noticed any change?\u0027 he went on. \u0027They tell us that we get more European every year in our love of pleasure and luxury.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale glanced around at the many little groups dining on the twenty-eighth storey of a famous hotel, under the light of the big, yellow moon. The table illuminations, and the row of electric lights which ran along the parapet, seemed strangely insignificant. Everywhere was a loud murmur of conversation, punctuated by much feminine laughter, the incessant popping of corks, the music of the not too insistent band. \n \n \u0027I tell you, Jimmy,\u0027 he confided, leaning forward towards his friend, \u0027to look into the faces of these people is the greatest relief I have known for twelve months. Just at first, when war broke out, one didn\u0027t notice much change, in England especially, but latterly there has been no mistaking it. Wherever you went, in the streets or the restaurants, you could see the writing in the faces of the people, a sort of dumb repression of feeling, just as though they were trying to get through the task of every-day life because they had to, eating and drinking because they had to, talking, amusing themselves, even, with an absent feverishness all the time—unnatural. I tell you it\u0027s like being in some sort of a dream to be in London or Paris to-day. It\u0027s only to-night I\u0027ve felt myself back amongst real men and women again, and it\u0027s good.\u0027 \n \n Moreton nodded understandingly. \n \n \u0027A fellow was writing something of the sort in one of the Sunday papers last week,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027Over here, of course, the whole thing to us is simply pictorial. We don\u0027t realize or appreciate what is happening. We can\u0027t.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And yet some day,\u0027 Lavendale sighed, \u0027we shall have to go through it ourselves.\u0027 \n \n \u0027One of your Harvard theories cropping up again!\u0027 \n \n \u0027It\u0027s more than a theory now—it\u0027s a certainty,\u0027 Lavendale insisted. \u0027One doesn\u0027t need to brood, though. There\u0027s plenty of real life buzzing around us all the time. Do you know why I sent you that wireless, Jim?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Not an idea on earth,\u0027 the other admitted. \u0027I guess I was conceited enough to hope that you wanted to see me again.\u0027 \n \n \u0027That\u0027s so, anyway,\u0027 Lavendale assured him, \u0027and you know it, but apart from that I want you to do something for me. I want to meet your uncle.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll do what I can,\u0027 Moreton promised, a little dubiously. \u0027He isn\u0027t the easiest person to get at, as you know.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Where is he now?\u0027 Lavendale inquired. \n \n \u0027I haven\u0027t had a line from him or my aunt for months,\u0027 Moreton replied, \u0027but the papers say he is coming to New York to-night.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Is there anything in these sensational reports about his new discovery?\u0027 Lavendale asked eagerly. \n \n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t be surprised,\u0027 the other confessed. \u0027There is no doubt that he is giving up his laboratories and closing down in the country. He told me himself, last time I saw him, that the thing he\u0027d been working at, off and on, for the last thirty years, was in his hands at last, perfect. He\u0027s through with inventing—that\u0027s how he put it to me. He is going to spend the rest of his days reading dime novels in the mornings and visiting cinemas in the afternoons—says his brain\u0027s tired.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t wonder at that,\u0027 Lavendale observed. \u0027He was seventy-two last year, wasn\u0027t he? I wonder how long he\u0027ll keep his word, though.\u0027 \n \n \u0027He seems in earnest. He has been very cranky lately, and they were all terrified down at Lakeside that he\u0027d blow the whole place up.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You don\u0027t know any particulars about this last invention, I suppose?\u0027 \n \n \u0027If I did,\u0027 Moreton declared with a little laugh, \u0027I could have had my weight in dollars from the newspaper men alone. No, I know nothing whatever about it. All I can promise is that I\u0027ll take you up to Riverside Drive and do my best to boost you in. Now tell me what you\u0027ve been doing with yourself this year, Ambrose? You\u0027ve left the Diplomatic Service, haven\u0027t you?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Not altogether. I have a sort of unofficial position at the Embassy, perhaps as important as my last one, only not quite so prominent.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Still as great a scaremonger as ever? Do you remember those discussions you used to start at the debating society?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I remember them all right,\u0027 Lavendale assented grimly, \u0027and since you ask me the question, let me tell you this, Jim. I\u0027ve lived, as you know, during the last seven years in the diplomatic atmosphere of Paris, of London and Berlin. I tell you soberly that anything I felt and believed in those days, I feel and believe twice as strongly to-day. Just look over your left shoulder, Jimmy. Isn\u0027t that rather a queer-looking couple for a fashionable roof-garden!\u0027 \n \n Moreton turned a little lazily around. An elderly man and woman who had just entered were being shown to an adjacent table. The man was apparently of some seventy years of age, his morning clothes were of old-fashioned cut and he wore only a little wisp of black tie. His grey beard was cut in the fashion of a century ago, his bushy hair was long and unkempt. His companion, who seemed but a few years younger, wore the simplest of dark travelling clothes, some jet jewellery, a huge cameo brooch fastened a shawl at her throat and she carried a leather handbag. \n \n \u0027Don\u0027t they look as though they\u0027d come out of the ark!\u0027 Lavendale murmured. \n \n Moreton had risen slowly to his feet. \n \n \u0027Queer thing that you should spot them, Ambrose,\u0027 he remarked. \u0027This is what you might call something of a coincidence.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You don\u0027t mean to say that you know them?\u0027 \n \n Jim Moreton nodded. \n \n \u0027My Uncle Ned and my Aunt Bessie,\u0027 he said. \u0027I must go and speak to them.\u0027 \n \n He crossed towards the elderly couple, shook hands with the man, who greeted him cordially enough, and submitted to an embrace from the lady. Lavendale could hear, every now and then, scraps of their conversation. Towards its close, his friend turned and beckoned to him. Lavendale, who had been eagerly awaiting a summons, rose at once and approached the trio. \n \n \u0027Aunt,\u0027 Moreton explained, laying his hand upon his friend\u0027s shoulder, \u0027this is Mr. Ambrose Lavendale, a graduate of my year at Harvard. Uncle, Lavendale has just returned from Europe and he was talking to me about you. He is like the rest of us, tremendously interested in what all the world is saying about you and your latest discovery.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale shook hands with the elderly couple, who greeted him kindly. \n \n \u0027Discovery, eh?\u0027 Mr. Moreton observed jocularly. \n \n \u0027That does seem rather an inadequate word,\u0027 Lavendale admitted. \u0027I think one of your own newspapers here declared that you had learnt how to bottle up the lightnings, to——\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, those damned papers!\u0027 Mr. Moreton exclaimed irritably. \u0027Don\u0027t talk to me about them, young fellow.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I would much rather talk to you about what they are aiming at,\u0027 Lavendale said simply. \u0027Are you going to give any demonstration, sir—I mean, of course, to the scientific world?\u0027 \n \n The inventor glanced up at his questioner with a little twinkle in his hard, blue eyes. \n \n \u0027Say, you\u0027ve some nerve, young fellow!\u0027 he declared amiably. \u0027However, I am very fond of my nephew here, and if you\u0027re a friend of Jim\u0027s you shall be one of a very select company to-morrow morning. The scientific world can wait, but I am going to set the minds of the newspaper people at rest. I am going to show them what I can do. I was thinking of asking you, any way, Jim,\u0027 he went on, \u0027and you can bring your friend with you. Twelve o\u0027clock at Riverside Drive.\u0027 \n \n The two young men were both profuse in their thanks. Mr. Moreton waved them away. \u0027There will be just three or four newspaper men,\u0027 he continued—\u0027I put the names of the principal papers into a bottle and drew lots; the reporters who came down to Jersey State agreed to that—you two, your aunt and a young lady. You can go and finish your dinner now, boys. Your aunt and I, Jim, are going on to a cinema afterwards. We\u0027re going to make a real night of it.\u0027 \n \n The two young men shook hands and made their adieux. As soon as they had resumed their places, Lavendale leaned across the table towards his friend with glowing face. \n \n \u0027Jimmy, you\u0027re a brick,\u0027 he declared. \u0027We\u0027ll have another bottle on the strength of this. The very night I arrive, too! Whoever heard of such luck! I don\u0027t suppose I should ever have got within a hundred yards of him but for you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027He\u0027s a shy old bird,\u0027 Moreton admitted. \u0027We certainly were in luck to-night though.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I wonder who the girl is who\u0027s going to be there,\u0027 Lavendale remarked idly. \n \n His eyes had suddenly strayed once more over the brilliant yet uneasy panorama of flashing lights, huge buildings, the throbbing and clanging of cars across the distant line of the river to the blue spaces beyond. The leader of the little orchestra behind was playing a familiar waltz. Suzanne and he had danced it together one night in London. He was for a moment oblivious of the whole gamut of his surroundings. The world closed in upon him. He heard her voice, felt the touch of her fingers, saw a gleam of the tenderness which sometimes flashed out from beneath the suffering of her eyes. His friend glanced at him in wonder. It was the insistent voice of a waiter which brought him back from his reverie. \n \n \u0027French or Turkish coffee, sir?\u0027 \n \n Lavendale made a heedless choice and climbed down to the present. \n \n \u0027Way back somewhere, weren\u0027t you?\u0027 Jim Moreton remarked. \n \n His friend nodded. \n \n \u0027I have left behind a great deal that one remembers.\u0027 \n \n ***** \n \n At a few minutes before twelve on the following morning, Lavendale and his friend were conducted by a coloured butler across a very magnificent entrance hall of black and white marble, strewn with wonderful rugs, through several suites of reception rooms, and out on to a broad stone piazza, at the back of Mr. Moreton\u0027s mansion in Riverside Drive. It was here that Lavendale received one of the surprises of his life. Mr. and Mrs. Moreton were reclining in low wicker chairs, and between them, a miracle of daintiness in her white linen costume and plain black hat, was—Suzanne. Lavendale forget his manners, forgot the tremendous interest of his visit, forgot everything else in the world. He stood quite still for a moment. Then he strode forward with outstretched hands and a very visible gladness in his face. \n \n \u0027Suzanne!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027Why, how wonderful!\u0027 \n \n She laughed at him gaily as she accepted his greeting. There was some response to his joy shining out of her eyes, but it was obvious that his presence was less of a surprise to her. \n \n \u0027You did not know that I was here?\u0027 she asked. \u0027But why not? Men and women have travelled many times round the world before now to learn its secrets.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale recovered a little of his self-possession. He shook hands with Mrs. Moreton, who was beaming placidly upon them, mutely approving of this unexpected romance. The great inventor turned him round by the shoulder and indicated four men of varying ages who formed the rest of the little company. \n \n \u0027I will not introduce you by name,\u0027 he said, \u0027but these four gentlemen, selected by lot, as I think I told you last night, represent the mightiest and holiest power on earth—the great, never-to-be-denied Press of America. They are here because, since the first rumour stole from my laboratory down in Jersey State that I had reached the end of my labours, I have been the victim of an incessant and turbulent siege, carried on relentlessly day by day—I might almost say hour by hour. For good reasons I desired to keep my discovery to myself a little longer, but I know that I am beaten, and these gentlemen, or rather the power which they represent, have been too many for me. My country household has been honeycombed with spies. My medical man, my gardener, the assistants in my laboratory, have every one of them been made the objects of subtle and repeated attempts at bribery. Young Mr. Lavendale, let me tell you this—the Press of America to-day is the one undeniable force. Look at them—my conquerors. I am going to present them to-day with my secret—not willingly, mind, but because, if I do not yield, they will continue to eat with me, to sleep with me and to walk with me, to plague my days and curse my nights. This young lady,\u0027 he continued, in an altered tone, \u0027came to me with a personal letter from my cousin, our Ambassador in Paris. You, Mr. Lavendale, are here as my nephew\u0027s friend. Now, if you are ready, I will proceed with the demonstration.\u0027 \n \n The four men had risen to their feet. One of them, a well-set-up, handsome young fellow, shook hands with Lavendale. \n \n \u0027I was a year before you at Harvard, wasn\u0027t I?\u0027 he remarked. \u0027We think that Mr. Moreton is just a little hard upon us. We represent, to use his own words, the undeniable force, and to do it we have to forget that we are human, and persist. This may be very annoying to Mr. Moreton, but as a rule it is the world that benefits.\u0027 \n \n The inventor, who had disappeared for a moment in the interior of the room which led out on to the piazza, suddenly stood upon the threshold. His face seemed to have become graver during the last few moments and he motioned them impatiently back to their places. Then, with a reel of what seemed to be fine wire in his hand, he made his way to the further end of the broad balcony which completely encircled the house, and carefully stretched a length of the wire from the edge of the building to the stone balustrade. As soon as he had accomplished this, he drew from his pockets what appeared to be a pair of black gloves of some spongy material, and a tiny instrument about the size of a lady\u0027s watch, which none of them could see. He drew on the gloves with great care, placed the instrument between the palms of his hands and turned to his nephew. \n \n \u0027Just ring the bell there, will you, Jimmy?\u0027 he directed. \n \n The young man obeyed. The little group now were all standing up, their eyes fixed upon that strip of thin wire. Mr. Moreton slowly drew his palms together several times, pausing once to glance at the small instrument which lay concealed between them. Footsteps were heard approaching around the side of the house, and a coloured servant in livery, carrying a tray in his hand, appeared. He had no sooner set his foot upon the wire than he stopped short, gave a wild jump into the air, came down again, jumped again, and slowly, with the salver still in his hand, began to dance. \n \n \u0027Touch the bell,\u0027 the inventor ordered, in a voice which seemed tense with suppressed emotion. \n \n His nephew obeyed at once and again there were footsteps. Another servant, carrying a chair, came round the corner, paused for a moment as though in amazement on perceiving the antics of his predecessor, stepped on to the wire, leapt into the air, and commenced to perform almost similar gyrations. Mr. Moreton\u0027s breath was coming fast and he seemed to be the victim of some peculiar emotion. This time he only glanced towards the bell, which his nephew pushed. Again there were footsteps. A third servant, with a box of cigars, appeared, gave a little exclamation at the extraordinary sight before him, stepped forward on to the wire, leapt up till his head almost touched the sloping portico, and commenced throwing the cigars into the air and catching them. Mr. Moreton glanced from the three performers towards his little audience. The expression on their faces was absolutely indescribable. Meanwhile, the dancing of the three men in livery became more rapid. The man with the salver and glasses began throwing them into the air and catching them again, the servant on the outside was now occupied in balancing a cigar on the tip of his nose, while his neighbour on the right was twirling the wicker chair which he had been carrying, on the point of his forefinger. Mr. Moreton stretched out his hand towards the spellbound, stupefied little company. \n \n \u0027The Hamlin Trio, gentlemen, of jugglers and dancers, imported from the Winter Gardens at great expense for your entertainment! Good morning!\u0027 \n \n With one bound he was through the window. They heard the bolt slipped into its place. From behind the glass he turned and waved his hand to the newspaper men. Then he disappeared. \n \n \u0027Spoofed, my God!\u0027 the journalist who had spoken to Lavendale, exclaimed. \n \n For a single moment they all looked at one another. The trio of entertainers were redoubling now their efforts. There was a roar of laughter. \n \n \u0027The joke\u0027s on us,\u0027 one of the other newspaper men admitted candidly, \u0027but what a story! We\u0027d better get along and write it, you fellows,\u0027 he added, \u0027before they have it up against us.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Is there any chance,\u0027 a third man inquired, \u0027of Mr. Moreton talking to us reasonably?\u0027 \n \n His wife beamed placidly upon them. \n \n \u0027Not one chance in this life,\u0027 she assured them. \u0027If you knew the language poor dear Ned has used about you gentlemen of the Press worrying him down at Lakeside during the last few months, you\u0027d only wonder that he has let you off so lightly.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Then perhaps,\u0027 Lavendale\u0027s acquaintance suggested, \u0027we\u0027d better be getting along.\u0027 \n \n The Hamlin Trio, at the other end of the piazza, suddenly ceased their labours, made a collective bow and disappeared. The newspaper men still lingered, looking longingly at the bolted window. Mrs. Moreton shook her head. \n \n \u0027Just leave him alone for a little time,\u0027 she begged. \u0027He has got a down on you newspaper gentlemen, and the way they worried him down at New Jersey has pretty well driven him crazy. Don\u0027t try him any more this morning, if you please,\u0027 she persisted. \u0027It\u0027s my belief this little joke he\u0027s played on you kept him out of the hospital.\u0027 \n \n The silvery-haired old lady, with her earnest eyes and the little quaver in her tone, triumphed. The little company reluctantly dispersed. Lavendale and Suzanne were on the point of following the others when a head was thrust cautiously out of a window on the second storey of the house. \n \n \u0027Has the Press of the United States departed?\u0027 Mr. Moreton inquired. \n \n \u0027They\u0027ve all gone, dear,\u0027 his wife called out soothingly. \n \n \u0027Then bring the others in to luncheon,\u0027 Mr. Moreton invited. \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll bring them in right away,\u0027 Mrs. Moreton promised. \u0027Say, that\u0027s a good sign, young people,\u0027 she added, turning to them cheerfully. \u0027He has hated the sight of company lately, but I did feel real uncomfortable at sending you away without any offer of hospitality. He has locked this window fast enough,\u0027 she added, trying it, \u0027but come right along with me and I\u0027ll show you another way in.\u0027 \n \n They followed her along the piazza. Lavendale and Suzanne fell a little way behind. It was their first opportunity. \n \n \u0027How long have you been here?\u0027 he asked eagerly. \u0027What did you come for? Why didn\u0027t you let me know?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I have been in New York four days,\u0027 she told him. \u0027I was on the City of Paris. We passed you near Queenstown. As for the rest, I suppose I am here for the same reason that you are. Monsieur Senn, the great electrician, has been working on the same lines as Moreton for years, and he persuaded me to get a letter from the American Ambassador in Paris and come out here. I do not suppose, though, that it is any use. They say that Mr. Moreton is like you—American inventions for the American people.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I\u0027ve wobbled once or twice,\u0027 he reminded her. \n \n \u0027Of course, there\u0027s always a chance,\u0027 she murmured. \n \n \u0027Say that you are glad to see me?\u0027 he begged. \n \n She gave his hand a little squeeze. Then Mrs. Moreton turned round with a motherly smile. \n \n \u0027If you\u0027ll take your cocktail in the smoking-room with Jimmy, Mr. Lavendale,\u0027 she said, \u0027I\u0027ll look after Miss de Freyne.\u0027 ... \n \n \n Luncheon was a meal of unexpected simplicity, served by a couple of trim waiting-maids in a magnificent apartment which overlooked the Hudson. Mr. Moreton was in high good-humour over his latest exploit, and they all indulged in speculations as to the nature of the stories which would appear in the evening editions. Underneath his hilarity, however, Lavendale more than once fancied that he noted signs of an immense tension. Sometimes, in the middle of a conversation, the great inventor would break off as though he had lost the thread of what he had been saying, and look uneasily, almost supplicatingly around him until some one supplied him with the context of his speech. Towards the end of the meal, after a brief silence, he turned with curious abruptness towards Lavendale. \n \n \u0027Say, you\u0027ve come a long way to see nothing, young man,\u0027 he remarked. \n \n \u0027I have had the pleasure of meeting you, sir,\u0027 Lavendale replied politely, \u0027and, after all, I never believed the things they were saying in London.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What were they saying?\u0027 Mr. Moreton demanded brusquely. \n \n \u0027There was a report there when I left,\u0027 Lavendale answered, \u0027that you had learnt at last the secret of handling electricity by wireless, handling it, I mean, in destructive fashion.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh! they said that, did they?\u0027 Mr. Moreton observed, smiling to himself. \n \n \u0027To be absolutely exact,\u0027 Lavendale went on, \u0027they said that you had professed to discover it. A great scientific man whom I met only a few days before I left England, however—Sir Hubert Bowden—assured me that mine would be a wasted journey because the thing was impossible.\u0027 \n \n A suddenly changed man sat in Mr. Moreton\u0027s place. The unhealthy pallor of his skin was disfigured by dark red, almost purple patches. His eyes were like glittering beads. He struck the table fiercely with his hairy fist. \n \n \u0027Bowden is an ass!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027He is an ignorant numskull, a dabbler, a blind follower in other men\u0027s footsteps. Impossible to me—Moreton?\u0027 \n \n \u0027My dear! My dear!\u0027 his wife murmured anxiously from the other end of the table. \n \n The inventor turned to one of the servants. \n \n \u0027Telephone to the garage for the car to be here in ten minutes,\u0027 he ordered. \u0027I have had my little joke,\u0027 he went on, as the girl left the room. \u0027This afternoon we\u0027ll get to business.\u0027 \n \n His fury seemed to pass away as suddenly as it had come. He ate and drank nervously but with apparent appetite. As soon as the meal was over he commenced smoking a black cigar, and, excusing himself rather abruptly, left the room. \n \n \u0027Do you suppose,\u0027 Lavendale asked his hostess, \u0027that he is really going to give us a demonstration?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she answered uneasily. \u0027I wish I could get him somewhere right away from every one who talks about inventions and electricity. You put his back up, you know, Mr. Lavendale. He was quite all right before you handed him that sort of challenge.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I am sorry,\u0027 Lavendale murmured mendaciously. \n \n In a few minutes they received an urgent summons. They found Mr. Moreton waiting in a large, open car below. He had quite recovered his temper. His face, indeed, shone with the benign expression of a child on its way to a treat. \n \n \u0027Miss de Freyne and Mr. Lavendale, you can sit by my side,\u0027 he ordered. \u0027Jimmy, you get up in front. The man knows where to go.\u0027 \n \n They swung round and in a few minutes turned into Central Park. At a spot where the road curved rather abruptly, the car came to a standstill. Mr. Moreton stepped out. From his pocket he drew a small skein of what seemed to be white silk, and a tiny instrument with a dial face and perforated with several holes. \n \n \u0027Hold that,\u0027 he directed Lavendale. \n \n The latter obeyed. Mr. Moreton drew the thread of white silk backwards and forwards through one of the apertures in the instrument, the finger on the dial face mounting all the time from zero. When it reached a certain figure he drew it out, and, stooping down, stretched it across the path from the hedge to the curbstone. Then he glanced up and down and around the corner. The park was almost deserted and there were only a few loungers in sight. From the small bag which he had brought with him in the car, Mr. Moreton next produced a square black box with a handle in the side, and a pair of black indiarubber gloves which he hastily donned. Then, with the box in his hand, he turned the handle which protruded from its side. A queer, buzzing little sound came from the interior, a sound which, low though it was, thrilled Lavendale from its utter and mysterious novelty. It was a sound such as he had never imagined, a sound like the grumblings of belittled and imprisoned thunder. The finger on the dial moved slowly. When it had reached a certain point, Mr. Moreton paused. He clasped the machine tightly in his hands. The mutterings still continued, and from a tiny opening underneath came little flashes of blue fire. The inventor stepped into the car, motioning the others to follow him, and gave an order to the driver. They backed to a spot by the side of the road, about a hundred yards away from where the thread of white silk lay stretched across the pavement. Mr. Moreton gripped the instrument in his rubber-clad hand and leaned back in the car, his eyes fixed upon the corner. His expression had become calmer, almost seraphic. \n \n \u0027We shall see now,\u0027 he promised them, smiling, \u0027another land of dance. There is only one thing I should like to point out. The little instrument I hold in my hand now is adjusted to any distance up to two hundred yards. By turning the handle a dozen more times, the distance could be increased to a mile, and more in proportion. The length of my silk-covered wire is immaterial. It could stretch, if desired, from here to Broadway. Now watch.\u0027 \n \n They all sat with their eyes fastened upon the corner of the pathway. A slight uneasiness which Lavendale in particular had felt, was almost banished by a thrilling sense of expectancy. Suddenly a portly figure appeared, a policeman whom they had passed soon after entering the park. He approached with his hands behind him, walking in ruminating fashion. Suddenly, as his foot touched the thread, he came to a halt. There was something unnatural in his momentarily statuesque attitude. Then, before their eyes he seemed to stiffen, fell like a log on his right side, with his head in the roadway. His helmet rolled a few feet away. The man remained motionless. Lavendale sprang to his feet but Mr. Moreton pushed him back. \n \n \u0027That is of no consequence,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Wait for a moment.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale even then would have obeyed his instinct and jumped from the car, but his limbs seemed powerless. A man and a girl, arm in arm, appeared round the corner. Suzanne stood up. A strange, hysterical impulse seized her and she tried to shout. Her voice sounded like the feeblest whimper. The two lovers, as their feet touched the thread, seemed suddenly to break off in their conversation. It was as though the words themselves were arrested upon their lips, as though all feeling and movement had become paralyzed. Then they, too, stiffened and fell in the same direction. A park-keeper, who had seen the collapse of the policeman, came running across the road, shouting all the time, and an automobile which had been crawling along, increased its speed and raced to the spot. Mr. Moreton touched a button in the instrument which he was holding. The thunder died away and the blue flashes ceased. Suzanne leaned back in the car; her cheeks were as pale as death. Lavendale bent over her. \n \n \u0027It\u0027s all right, Suzanne,\u0027 he assured her. \u0027Sit here while I go down. There is nothing wrong with those people really. It\u0027s just another of Mr. Moreton\u0027s little jokes.\u0027 \n \n Nevertheless, when Lavendale\u0027s feet touched the ground he gave a little cry, for the earth seemed quaking around him. Mr. Moreton, who was walking by his side, patted him on the shoulder. \n \n \u0027Steady, my boy! Steady!\u0027 he said. \u0027You see, the whole of the earth between here and that little thread of white silk is heavily charged. You feel, don\u0027t you, as though the ground were rising up and were going to hit you in the chin. I\u0027ve grown used to it. There goes poor Jimmy. Dear me, he hasn\u0027t the nerve of a chicken!\u0027 \n \n Young Moreton fell over in a dead faint. Lavendale set his teeth and staggered on. A little crowd was already gathering around the three prostrate bodies as they drew near. \n \n \u0027You see,\u0027 Mr. Moreton explained reassuringly, \u0027I have broken the connection now. Nothing more will happen.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What of those three—the policeman, the man and the girl?\u0027 Lavendale faltered. \n \n Mr. Moreton patted him on the back. They had reached now the outskirts of the little group. \n \n \u0027Theirs,\u0027 he said gravely, \u0027was the real dance. You have been fortunate, young man. Your journey from Europe has been worth while, after all. You have seen the Hamlin Trio in their Jugglers\u0027 Dance, and you have seen here in the sunshine, under the green trees, with all the dramatic environment possible, the greatest dance of all—the dance of death.\u0027 \n \n Lavendale felt the blood once more flowing freely in his veins. He turned almost fiercely upon his companion as he pushed his way through the gathering crowd. \n \n \u0027You don\u0027t mean that they are really dead?\u0027 he cried. \n \n \u0027Even your wonderful friend Bowden,\u0027 Mr. Moreton assured him sweetly, \u0027could never wake a single beat in their hearts again.\u0027 \n \n An ambulance had just glided up. A man who seemed to be a doctor rose to his feet, shaking the dust from his knees. \n \n \u0027These three people are dead,\u0027 he pronounced sombrely. \u0027The symptoms are inexplicable.\u0027 \n \n He suddenly recognized Moreton, who held out his hand genially towards him. \n \n \u0027Dr. Praxton, is it not?\u0027 he remarked. \u0027It is very fortunate that I should have so reliable a witness upon the spot. I shall be obliged, doctor, if you will take the bodies of these fortunate people into your keeping and prepare a careful examination of their condition.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Do you know anything about their death?\u0027 the doctor asked. \n \n The great inventor smiled in a superior fashion. \n \n \u0027Why, my dear fellow, yes!\u0027 he assented. \u0027I killed them. You see that little skein of what seems to be white silk? If a million people had trodden upon it, one after the other, or if I in my car had been twenty miles away, with my instrument properly regulated, there would still be a million dead lying here. I am Moreton—Ned Moreton, the inventor, you know, doctor. I can strip the universe of life, if I choose. I should have liked,\u0027 he added, glancing a little peevishly over his shoulder, \u0027the young lady to have seen this. I shall make a point of her coming on to the hospital.\u0027 \n \n The doctor glanced meaningly at the two or three policemen who had forced their way to the front. They led Mr. Moreton back to the car, and a few minutes later he was driven off, seated between them, smoking a cigar, the picture of amiability. Suzanne and Lavendale found a taxicab and left the park by another exit. She sat close to him, clinging to his arm. \n \n \u0027Suzanne,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027can you be a woman now for the sake of the great things?\u0027 \n \n She sat up by his side. Her face was marble white, but some latent force seemed to have asserted itself. She answered him steadily. \n \n \u0027Go on, Ambrose,\u0027 she begged. \u0027I can listen. Do not be afraid.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I have told this man,\u0027 he continued, \u0027to drive to the docks. The Marabic is sailing at five o\u0027clock.\u0027 \n \n She looked at him for a moment as though she failed to understand. His arm tightened around her. \n \n \u0027I have the instruments and a skein of the thread in my pocket,\u0027 he whispered. \n \n A sudden light flashed in her eyes. She leaned over and kissed him firmly and deliberately upon the lips. \n \n \u0027You are a man, Ambrose,\u0027 she declared. \u0027Do not be afraid. We are allies, is it not so?\u0027 \n \n \u0027In this, yes!\u0027 he promised her.... \n \n Two hours later, as they moved slowly down the river, the tugs shrieking in front of them, and siren whistles blowing on every side, they examined for the first time, in the security of Lavendale\u0027s state-room, their new treasures—the black, camera-like instrument, the smaller one, with its dial face, and a little skein of the white, silk-covered wire. They both gazed at them almost in stupefaction—harmless-looking objects, silent, dead things. \n \n \u0027Only think,\u0027 she whispered, clutching his arm, \u0027we have but to learn their secret and we can end the war!\u0027 \n \n Lavendale hid them away and silently they stole up on deck. They heard the engines quicken their beat, saw the great buildings of the city fade into an evening mist. They saw the lights shoot out from the Statue of Liberty and felt the ocean breeze on their cheeks. They turned their faces eastwards. The apprehension of great things kept them silent. They faced the Unknown. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1900/54747.html","bookId":924,"book":{"id":924,"title":"Ambrose Lavendale, Diplomat","description":"简介： It was a few minutes after one o\u0027clockthe busiest hour of the day at the most popular bar in London.
