One of the paintings was a romanticism of a man and woman dancing under the moonlight surrounded by clouds. The second painting was of a garden with a fountain surrounded by beautiful flowers. The last painting was of a child sitting in a field of flowers in a white dress as three angels look down upon her from the sky. All three paintings spoke something about me.\n “Wow Ellery, these are gorgeous. I’m sure I won’t have any problem selling these,” Sal smiled.\n I felt a little embarrassed because this was the first time I was going to be showing my work to the world. He led me over to a small wall that was sitting bare.\n “This is where your paintings will be displayed. I will call as soon as one or all of them sell.” I thanked him and as soon as he walked away, Peyton started jumping up and down clapping her hands.\n “Let’s go out and celebrate tonight,” she squealed.\n Going out was the last thing on my mind. I was not ready to do the single girl, out at night thing, but Peyton was persistent, and I knew I didn’t stand a chance against her. So, I hesitantly agreed.\n I left the gallery and started walking down the street. I fumbled through my large purse to find my ringing cell phone. I grabbed it and looked at the familiar number that found its way to my phone a little too much lately. I hit ignore and decided to walk the six blocks home. It was not long before the new voicemail alert lit up my phone. By the time I made it home, I was exhausted. I threw my keys and purse on the table next to the door and listened to the message that so annoyingly remained on my screen.\n “Hi Ellery, this is Dr. Taub calling. I noticed you have cancelled the last two appointments since our last visit. I want to make sure you are still coming to see me. It is vital that we talk about this. I can help you Ellery. Please call my office to set up an appointment A.S.A.P.” I rolled my eyes and shook my head as I hit the delete button.\n I walked to the bedroom and decided to lay down for a while as the six block walk home took its toll on me. I had only been sleeping about an hour when I awoke to the sound of my ringing phone.\n Chapter 3\n “Hello,” I sleepily answered.\n “Were you sleeping?” Peyton asked rather loudly.\n “I was just taking a little nap,” I yawned.\n “Get up; I’m on my way over to your place to get ready for the club.”\n I heavily sighed, “Club? You said we’d go celebrate; I thought maybe that meant dinner, not clubbing.” I didn’t feel like going to a noisy crowded club tonight.\n “Elle, snap out of it, you have been a hum drum since douchebag Kyle left. Reclaim your life, have fun like you used to; you are the most fun person I know.”\n “I don’t know Peyton; I’m not feeling the club scene tonight.”\n “You’ll feel it once you get there and who knows maybe you will meet your Prince Charming tonight.”\n Did she say Prince Charming? I don’t want a Prince Charming. I don’t want anything to do with men period. It was important to Peyton that we celebrate, so I agreed to go.\n “Ok Peyton, I guess I’ll go, but I do not want to be out late, I’m tired.”\n “Yay,” she shrieked. “Oh, my friend Caleb is picking us up at your place, bye.”\n “Wait, who is…”click… I silently chuckled and hopped in the shower. Peyton’s exuberance attracted a lot of different people. I believe that’s why we connected with each other so quickly.\n As soon as I got out of the shower, Peyton walked through the door and threw a bag from Forever 21 at me.\n “What’s this?” I asked as I peeked inside the bag.\n She looked at me and smiled as she flitted to the bathroom, “Just a little pick me up I bought for you to wear tonight.”\n Peyton was generous like that; we always bought each other things we thought the other would like. I opened the bag and took out the most spectacular silver, glittery knit tank top.\n “Peyton, I love it,” I smiled.\n “I knew you would. I thought you could wear it with your black leggings and black boots,” she mumbled as she brushed her teeth.\n I went to the bedroom and put on the top. The length was long enough to cover my ass, which made it perfect for leggings. I walked to the bathroom where Peyton was doing her hair. She looked at me through the mirror and whistled, “Look at you miss thing; every guy at the club is going to want to tap that hot ass,” she smiled as she lightly smacked it.\n I rolled my eyes. Peyton is one of those people who does not have a filter; she says what’s on her mind, at that moment and never gives it a second thought. Her mouth spits before her brain thinks.\n I smiled as I hugged her, “Thank you; it’s perfect.”\n “Awe, it’s nice to see you smile again Elle,” she continued straightening her hair.\n I asked Peyton about Caleb, and she said he was a friend of a friend, and they went out a couple of times. I found it odd since this is the first time I’m hearing his name. She said she started seeing him right when Kyle left me. She didn’t think it was appropriate to talk about her dating life so soon. To be honest, I was touched by her thoughtfulness not to mention it, but at the same time I was pissed she didn’t.\n I looked at myself in the mirror one last time before going out. I decided to throw some soft curls into my blonde hair that I already straightened and rubbed off some of the eye shadow Peyton painted on me. I was starting to feel glad I decided to go tonight; I needed some fun.\n Caleb came to the door and whistled at the both of us as Peyton opened it. He gently kissed her on the cheek and walked over to me holding out his hand.\n “I’m Caleb, nice to meet you.”\n I shook his hand and told him the same. His grip was firm, and from what I could tell so was his body. He wore his short brown hair messy but in an attractive way and his black eyes were piercing. I could see why Peyton was attracted to him. The three of us slid into the cab that was waiting for us outside. Peyton had her arm around Caleb’s as they nuzzled each other. Suddenly, I felt like a third wheel.\n “So, what club are we going to?” I asked. Caleb broke his gaze from Peyton and looked over at me.\n “I thought we’d go to Club S.”\n I frowned trying to think of how I knew that club, and then it hit me, my friend from the soup kitchen, Frankie is a bouncer there. I gasped.\n “Isn’t that a sex club?”\n Peyton looked at me and smiled, “Elle it’s a normal club; it just so happens that some people go there to find others to have sex with.” She said it so casually as if it was no big deal. I rolled my eyes and sighed.\n “Correct me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t the S stand for sex, as in Club Sex?” Peyton and Caleb both smiled at me. “Great, now I’ll have to be on the defense all night.”\n “Live a little Elle,” she laughed.\n I crossed my arms and looked out the window as they started making out. I was not about to live a little by having a one night stand with some random guy; that wasn’t me. I only had sex with one guy in my life, and that was Kyle.\n Chapter 4\n The cab dropped us off in front of the club, and I was astounded by the line of people who wrapped around the building for at least 2 blocks. I smiled, for I knew there was no way we were getting in tonight, which was OK with me. I preferred to go out for a quiet dinner.\n Caleb slumped his shoulders, “Fuck, look at that line; we should have gotten here earlier.”\n As the crowds of people in line were patiently waiting to be let in, and I was wishing to get the hell out of there, I heard someone yelling my name. My eyes grew wide as I cautiously turned my head.\n “Elle, is that you? Hey Elle, over here.”\n I looked over in the direction where the voice was coming from, and it was Frankie waving his hand and motioning for me to come over. The three of us walked to the entrance and stood in front of the large, burly man named Frankie Lasher. His 6’4” wrestler body was enough to intimidate anyone. I could see why the club hired him as a bouncer. He put his arms around me and gave me a squeeze.\n “Good to see ya Elle; you guys clubbing here tonight?”\n I pulled from his embrace, “We were going to, but wow, look at that line, I don’t think tonight’s going to be a possibility.”\n “Nonsense, you three go in.”\n I gave him a dirty look as he lifted the rope for us. Caleb and Peyton were ecstatic and beaming from ear to ear. Frankie lightly grabbed my arm as I walked past him, “If you do not feel comfortable in there or you need me, come out here and let me know.” I smiled at his generosity and nodded.\n We walked through the small hallway that led into the main entrance of the club. I’ve been to many clubs, and this is by far is the most crowded I’ve ever seen. I looked around at the tables that filled the place. A massive bar sat off to the side with fluorescent lights that hung down from the ceiling. The oversized dance floor housed large projection screens and displayed a full color laser show. The walls were suede with soft lights that glowed off them. The music was blaring as the floor was thumping beneath my feet forcing my body to move with the beat.\n Peyton pulled me and Caleb to the dance floor where we danced for what seemed like hours. I needed a drink, so I left them to dance as I made my way to the bar. I took the only bar stool that was available at the end and ordered a Cosmopolitan. I was sipping on my drink when I noticed a man and woman arguing at a table not too far from where I was sitting. She had her shaking finger pointed at him and then proceeded to poke him in the chest several times. I couldn’t help but shake my head and laugh. I kept looking over at them to see if they would kiss and makeup, but noticed he was yelling now. His finger was pointing at her, and his face looked angered. The tall beautiful woman slapped him across the face, turned on her heels and scurried off. I stared at him and took notice at the look on his face which showed no emotion whatsoever. He just sat there and stared straight ahead.\n I kept looking over in his direction because he was one of the best eye candies I’ve ever seen. His light brown, almost blonde hair was shorter on the sides as his longer top had waves to it. I could not help but stare at his prominent square jaw and chiseled cheek bones. I could not tell the color of his eyes because he was too far away, and the lighting was inadequate, but I could tell just by looking, anyone could easily get lost in them.\n “Yum Elle, I see someone has stolen your attention,” Peyton smiled as she looked over at him. Oh god I did not need her knowing I was checking this guy out because she would be the first one to run over, tell him, and try to set us up.\n “He only has my attention because he was just bitch slapped by some woman.” She let out a loud laugh, and that was my cue to change the subject. She dragged me out to the dance floor where I danced and endlessly fought off horny guys as I kept getting shuffled in the crowd.\n It started to get extremely hot in the club, and I needed some fresh air. I told Peyton I’d be back as I headed towards the door. As I stepped outside, I saw Frankie escorting Mr. Eye Candy out of the club. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-black-forever-1/page-2.html","bookId":1821,"book":{"id":1821,"title":"Forever Black (Forever #1)","description":"Storyline: \n When Ellery moved to New York with her boyfriend, she thought they’d live happily ever after in their small New York apartment.
