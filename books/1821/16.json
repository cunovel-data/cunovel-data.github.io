Before I knew it, his lips were on mine, kissing me passionately and warmly. Our tongues danced with each other as he picked me up and carried me to the bedroom. My heart was racing with his, and my body was aching for his touch. He sat me gently on the bed as he lifted up my shirt and gently took it off. He tore the shirt off his back and unbuttoned his pants, never taking his eyes off me. I stood up and took off my jeans and threw them on the floor. I laid down on the bed in just my bra and panties as he examined my half-naked body.\\n\\n “You are so f**king beautiful,” he whispered as he ran his hand up and down my stomach. He climbed on top of me as I wrapped my arms around his neck. His lips met mine for a brief second until his tongue started to explore my neck. I moaned and tilted my head back to give him full access. I arched my back as he took down my bra straps and exposed my br**sts. He groaned as he lightly sucked each nipple and ran his tongue in circles down my stomach. I pressed my h*ps against him and felt his erection, which made me ache for him even more.\\n\\n I took my hand and pushed it down the front of his pants as he moaned. He lightly traced the edge of my panties as his fingers made their way to the spot that needed him the most. He circled his fingers around before gently inserting them inside me. “You’re so wet Ellery, god I want you,” he moaned as he brought his lips to mine. He moved his fingers inside me and then in a delicate in and out motion.\\n\\n “I promise I’ll be gentle with you, but if I get too rough promise me you’ll stop me.”\\n\\n I shook my head as I helped him off with his jeans and boxers. He took himself and gently inserted himself in me, looking into my eyes with each small thrust, slow and steady. Once he made his way fully inside me, his thrusting became faster. I screamed from the excitement. He was so hard, and he filled me with so much pleasure, something I never experienced before. My hands traveled to his backside as he moved in and out of me, steadying his movement. He brought his mouth to my br**sts; sucking and lightly biting each nipple. This is what I needed. It’s what I wanted from the moment I saw him standing in his kitchen. My hands moved up and down his back as I began to swell; he felt it to as his moans became louder and his thrusts more forceful. He took my leg and wrapped it around his waist, making penetration more deep and intense.\\n\\n “Come for me Ellery; come baby,” he whispered in my ear. I started to scream as the pleasure was so intense and I was ready to explode. One more thrust and that was it, I screamed Connors name as my body shook in pleasure and he took me to a place I’ve never been before.\\n\\n “Christ Ellery, you feel so good.”\\n\\n His moans grew as he yelled my name while filling me with his come. He looked at me panting as I stroked his face with my hand and pulled him down into me. He wrapped his hands around my head and buried himself in my neck. Our rapid heartbeats started to slow as did our breathing. I was done for; there was no going back now, and I was scared I was headed for heartache and trouble.\\n\\n He sat up and gently pulled out of me falling onto his side and looking at me. I laid on my side facing him as he softly pushed my hair away from my face.\\n\\n “You’re amazing,” he smiled.\\n\\n I blushed, “No, you’re amazing; I have never felt anything like that before.”\\n\\n He kissed me on the nose, “Can I be honest with you?” Oh god I thought, what did I do wrong.\\n\\n “Of course, you can. You can tell me anything.”\\n\\n He traced the outline of my jaw with his finger as he ran them softly across my lips, “You said you never felt anything like that before. I haven’t either. It was like I was hav**g s*x for the first time.”\\n\\n I took his hand and kissed it, “That’s because we made love Connor. It wasn’t just the act of sex; it was sex with feeling and emotion.” He pulled me closer and brushed his lips against mine so softly, I could have come right then and there. Needless to say, that started round two!\\n\\n Chapter 21\\n\\n I awoke the next morning snuggled in Connor’s arms. He was holding me tight as my head rested on his chest. I opened my eyes, and for the first time in my life, I felt peace and serenity. He made me feel whole and safe like I’ve never felt before. We made love three times last night, and it was the most beautiful experience I’ve ever had, nothing like with Kyle. I felt passion and love with Connor; it was like we couldn’t get enough of each other.\\n\\n We finally had our moment, and now I faced a new problem. I have a secret that could destroy this man who finally gave himself to me.\\n\\n “Morning baby,” Connor said as he kissed me on the head.\\n\\n I looked up at him and smiled, “Good morning, did you sleep well?”\\n\\n “I slept great, how about you? He asked.\\n\\n I lightly ran my finger around his muscular chest, “Yes I did; someone wore me out.” He smiled as I moved up closer to his face, covering my mouth with my hand, “I have morning breath.”\\n\\n He laughed, and before I knew it I was lying flat on my back with him on top of me.\\n\\n “I don’t care, it doesn’t bother me one bit.”\\n\\n I looked over at the clock. “Look at the time; we need to get out of here, or we’ll never make it to the funeral on time.”\\n\\n Connor slid off me, got out of bed and held his hand out, “Looks like we’ll have to shower together to save time.” I bit my bottom lip as I took his hand and we walked to the bathroom.\\n\\n I would have preferred the water a little hotter, but with what we were doing I was getting hot enough. He pinned my arms against the shower wall and took me from behind, kissing my neck as he moved in and out of me. He let go of my arms as he cupped each breast in his hands, rubbing and feeling them as deep groans came from the back of his throat. He moved flawlessly and had me ready to come the minute he touched me.\\n\\n “Are you ready Elle?” he panted.\\n\\n I moaned with each deep thrust. “Yes, come with me Connor,” I begged. The words were enough for him as his sexy moans grew louder. He pushed himself harder into me, and I felt his warmth fill my insides. He held me tight as we both sank to the shower floor and sat there in pure bliss.\\n\\n Once we were able to get ourselves out of the shower, we dressed, and I sat on the bed for a moment as I was starting to feel a little weak and tired.\\n\\n “What’s wrong baby?” Connor asked as he stood over me.\\n\\n I smiled to mask what I was actually feeling.\\n\\n “Nothing, I’m just sitting here looking around and wishing we could spend another night here; it’s so beautiful.”\\n\\n He took my hand and helped me up, “There will be plenty of hotels in our future, don’t worry.” I smiled as he used the word future, which to me meant a relationship.\\n\\n What have I done? I need to tell him something, but I can’t, not now. Once we get back to New York, I’ll tell him everything and watch his perfect heart-break. Tears started to fill my eyes as he looked at me.\\n\\n “Ellery what is wrong with you? Why do you look like you’re going to cry?” He wrapped his arms around me.\\n\\n “I’m just so happy that’s all; you’ve made me so happy.”\\n\\n “You’ve made me happy to baby; I can’t even tell you how much.”\\n\\n He kissed me and grabbed our suitcases as we headed back on the road to Michigan. I followed behind him trying to fight back the tears.\\n\\n We were driving and deciding whose music to listen to. He liked mostly classic rock, and I was more a pop, contemporary kind of girl, so we compromised and took turns listening to each other’s music. I would eventually get him over to my side of music, but that was going to take some work.\\n\\n His phone was sitting between us on the console, and it rang. I glanced over and saw Ashlyn’s name appear. Suddenly, my stomach tied itself in knots; I felt sick and I started to sweat. There was no way in f**king hell he was going to continue to talk to or see her. He pressed ignore and kept his head looking straight ahead at the road. She was someone I needed to know about, and it was not going to be painless, but Connor is mine now and he’s going to have to tell me the truth.\\n\\n I took in a deep breath, “Who is she Connor?” I reached over and turned off the radio.\\n\\n He heavily sighed, “I knew you were going to ask me?”\\n\\n “Ok, then you need to tell me about her if we’re going to move forward.”\\n\\n He took my hand and held it up to his lips, “I do not want to talk about her now Ellery, the car is not the place.”\\n\\n “Fine, I’ll wait, and we’ll discuss her later. But whatever you tell me will be ok because things with us are different now and we’re putting all our baggage in the past, right?”\\n\\n He looked over at me and smiled, “You bet we are.”\\n\\n “I have a question for you,” I said as I took the wrapper off my Twix bar. “Denny told me that you’ve been different since you met me.”\\n\\n He rolled his eyes, “Denny shouldn’t be telling things like that, but it’s true. I was intrigued by you the minute I saw you in my kitchen. When I woke up and heard someone in the kitchen, I walked downstairs to yell at whoever it was for being so loud. Imagine my surprise when I saw this beautiful stranger standing there making coffee.”\\n\\n “Yes, but you yelled at me about your rules.”\\n\\n He shrugged, “Well, I thought I brought you home from the club; I’m sorry about that.” I smacked his arm. He smiled as he looked at the road ahead.\\n\\n “When you told me what you did for me and gave me quite the attitude, it was that moment I knew I couldn’t let you walk out of my life. Denny knew it to because I kept talking about you and I didn’t realize it.” I laughed and reached over to kiss his cheek, but instead shoved the Twix bar in his mouth.\\n\\n We arrived in Michigan as I grew nervous to be back to a place that harbored such bad memories. Connor must have sensed it by my reaction. When I saw the Welcome to Michigan sign, he grabbed my hand and held it tight. My phone rang and it was Peyton calling.\\n\\n “Hi Peyton,” I answered.\\n\\n “Oh my god Elle, I just had to tell you about my fantastical date with Dr. Hottie last night.”\\n\\n I started to laugh, “So, you did manage to get him to ask you out?” I put her on speaker so Connor could hear.\\n\\n “No, I asked him out, and we went to dinner, then to a club and back to his place. Elle, he was phenomenal. He f**ks like no one ever has before.” Connor looked at me and started laughing.\\n\\n “Wow Peyton, that’s great,” I rolled my eyes.\\n\\n “Seriously Elle, he made me do things I never thought of doing before and shit is he big. I was worried when I saw it that it wouldn’t fit inside me. Elle, I got nervous that I wasn’t going to be able to experience this hot man.”\\n\\n Connors mouth dropped as he was in shock by Peyton’s openness. I was used to it, so it didn’t faze me.\\n\\n “Peyton, sweetie, I have you on speaker and Connor heard every word you just said.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-black-forever-1/page-16.html","bookId":1821,"book":{"id":1821,"title":"Forever Black (Forever #1)","description":"Storyline: When Ellery moved to New York with her boyfriend, she thought they’d live happily ever after in their small New York apartment.
