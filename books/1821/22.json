{"id":86256,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"“Listen to me,” his voice was raised, “I don’t want you staying here alone.”\\n\\n I walked over to him and put my finger to his chest, “I’m not your f**king charity case Connor Black, and I don’t need your help, besides you hate me anyway, why would you want to help me after what I did?” I slowly turned around and walked to the sink for a glass of water. I stood there with my hands on the edge.\\n\\n He slowly walked up behind me, “Ellery, I don’t hate you, please don’t ever say that again. Yes, I will admit I’m still angry, and I will be for a very long time, but I need to put all that aside because you are my friend and you need help. Please put your stubbornness aside and let me help you.”\\n\\n His voice was soft and his words sincere. I wanted to throw my arms around him and cry into his shoulder, but I couldn’t, he admitted he was still angry and that he was only my friend.\\n\\n “You said you hired a nurse to come here and check on me.”\\n\\n He sighed again, “Well, I changed my mind and I’m making other arrangements.”\\n\\n “Fine, let me get my things.” I gave in because I didn’t have the strength to fight him, and I was scared of being alone.\\n\\n He turned around and looked over at the wall that was missing a chunk of drywall, “What happened over there?”\\n\\n I came from the bedroom as he walked over and grabbed my bags, “I threw a vase at Kyle.”\\n\\n He let out a laugh, “Are you serious?”\\n\\n “Yeah, he wouldn’t leave so I threw a vase at him; needless to say he left after that.” Connor shook his head and continued to laugh.\\n\\n Chapter 27\\n\\n I threw myself on the bed I’ve grown to love. Connor set my bags down in the corner.\\n\\n “I’m going out tonight; if you need anything help yourself.”\\n\\n I looked at him and gave half a smile, “Thanks.”\\n\\n He walked out and shut the door. Did he just make it a point to tell me he was going out? I could feel the burning and the rage rev up in my body; jealousy was setting in. This was not a good idea, but if it got too unbearable staying with him, I would pack up and leave.\\n\\n I didn’t have much of an appetite, and I was tired so I decided to turn in early. I was woken up by the sudden feeling of nausea that overtook my body. I looked at the clock. It was 2 am. I flew out of bed and to the bathroom that was directly across the hall. Thank god I made it as I started to vomit uncontrollably. Here we go I knew it wouldn’t take long; it didn’t the last time. As I was leaned over with my head in the toilet, I heard the door slowly open.\\n\\n “Ellery,” I heard Connor say as he grabbed my hair and held it back.\\n\\n I didn’t want him to see my like this. Moving here was not a good thing to do, and now I regretted it.\\n\\n “Get out of here Connor, please just go.”\\n\\n He knelt down beside me as he held my hair, “I’m not going anywhere until you are back in bed.”\\n\\n I threw up a few more times, mostly dry heaving as he walked to the sink and wet a cloth with tepid water. He folded it up and put it on my head. I quickly grabbed it out of his hand. I managed to get up and take small steps towards the door. I was so weak that I wanted to collapse right on the marble floor. Connor lightly took a hold of my arm and helped me into bed. He pulled the covers over me and as he went to walk away, I grabbed his hand. He turned around and looked at me.\\n\\n “This is nothing; you have no idea what you’ve gotten yourself into Mr. Black.”\\n\\n He stared at me without saying a word then walked out the door, leaving it open a crack. I was too exhausted to think of anything. I just wanted to sleep peacefully.\\n\\n I opened one eye at the sunlight peeking through the curtains that hung on the windows. I stretched and rolled over on my side, taking in the view of the city that stood outside my window. So much for the anti-nausea meds Nurse Bailey fed me. I heard the door slightly open.\\n\\n “Ellery, are you awake?” I heard his voice whisper.\\n\\n I rolled over and looked at him standing there in his dark jeans and a black cotton button down shirt that he left untucked. His hair was messy and damp, but in that sexy way that made me ache for him.\\n\\n “How are you feeling?” He asked from the doorway.\\n\\n I sat up on the edge of the bed, “I’m feeling ok at the moment. I think I’ll take a shower.”\\n\\n His eyes stared into me as if he wanted to reach out and touch me.\\n\\n “When you’re done, come downstairs and Claire will make you some breakfast.”\\n\\n I got out of bed and opened my bag to dig out my clothes for the day. “Who’s Claire?” I asked.\\n\\n “She’s my housekeeper.”\\n\\n “Oh, I didn’t know you had a housekeeper, you never mentioned her.”\\n\\n He ran his hand through his hair, “The opportunity never came up I guess.”\\n\\n I walked past without even looking at him. I walked in the bathroom as he followed me and stood in the doorway.\\n\\n “I’m going to the office to do some work, I’ll be home later.”\\n\\n I kept my back to him as I turned on the shower, “Ok, see ya later.”\\n\\n My words were flat with no emotion. I climbed in the shower and sat on the floor. I curled myself into a ball and cried.\\n\\n After my shower, I walked down to the kitchen. “You must be our new houseguest Ellery right?” She asked as she walked over and hugged me.\\n\\n I greeted her warmly, “Yes, and you must be Claire.”\\n\\n “I sure am honey, now sit down and tell me what you would like me to make you.”\\n\\n Claire was a breath of fresh air in this house. She was an older woman with brown hair that sat just above her shoulders. Her smile was as warm as her deep brown eyes that lit up when she saw me. Maybe she was happy to have another female in the house. I sat at the island as she put in front of me a cup of peppermint tea.\\n\\n “Drink up; it will soothe your stomach.” I took a small sip and set the cup down.\\n\\n “Mr. Black told me you were sick last night, so how about you start with some toast and scrambled eggs?”\\n\\n I shook my head. I was curious as to how much she knew about me and our situation, so I asked an obvious question.\\n\\n “What else did Mr. Black tell you?”\\n\\n She smiled as she put the bread in the toaster, “He only tells me what I need to know. Mr. Black is a very private person. He says you’re a friend and he wanted to help you. He’s a very generous man.”\\n\\n I rolled my eyes. If the chemo doesn’t kill me, then staying here with the man whose life I pretty much ruined will.\\n\\n “Ah I see you two met,” Connor said as he lightly stepped into the kitchen.\\n\\n “I thought you left,” I said with a - I don’t like you very much right now - attitude.\\n\\n “I had to finish up some computer work here first, don’t worry I’ll be leaving soon.”\\n\\n Claire eyed me and then looked at Connor as he sat over at the table.\\n\\n “Here honey, try to eat something, you’ll feel better if you do.”\\n\\n I saw Connor look over at me out of the corner of my eye. I picked up the fork and started to eat some eggs. The food was starting to help a bit, or maybe it was the tea, who knows.\\n\\n Connor finished his coffee and walked over to me, “I’m leaving now so if you need anything Claire will be here all day.” I didn’t look at him as I waved my hand.\\n\\n “I can tell this is going to be more difficult than I thought,” he mumbled as he left the kitchen.\\n\\n I didn’t know if he meant for me to hear it or not, but I did and it pissed me off.\\n\\n Claire studied me for a moment, “Calm down honey it’s not worth getting upset over.”\\n\\n I decided that if I was going to stay here, Claire had a right to know what happened between me and Connor. I told her everything.\\n\\n She sat down next me holding her coffee cup, “I figured something was going on between the two of you. You must have been the reason why Mr. Black was always in a good mood and smiling all the time not that long ago.”\\n\\n She saw the look on my face and took my hand; she pushed back my sleeve and looked at my wrist and then took my other hand and did the same, “Does he know about this?”\\n\\n I shook my head, “No, but he will soon enough, it’s not something I can keep hidden for long.” Claire smiled and patted my hand.\\n\\n I grabbed my coat and stepped outside. The air was a little warmer than it had been. The sun was shining bright, and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky; it was a perfect October day. I needed to get lost in myself so I decided to take a walk to Central Park. I needed to be alone, and what better place than to think about how much my life sucked at the moment is in the park. I made my way to the Conservatory Garden and found a spot in the middle of the grass. I laid the blanket on the soft grass and sat down with my knees to my chest. My phone started to ring; it was Connor. Someone must have tipped him off that I escaped. I hit ignore. I figured he would go to my apartment first, then probably the art gallery or soup kitchen. He’ll eventually figure out where I am so I wasn’t worried, and I honestly didn’t care. I inhaled through my nose, taking in the mild October air. I studied the flowers that were around me for soon they would be gone.\\n\\n I laid down on my back and stared up at the sky. I had a little talk with god and asked him to give me the strength to endure this process all over again. Connor kept calling me, so I turned my phone off. I asked god for a sign to let me know he would help me through this as I felt a tiny drop of rain fall on my cheek. That was good enough for me until a few clouds rolled in and it started to pour; so much for my perfect October day. I laid there staring up at the sky that was falling down upon me. I wanted so badly for the rain to wash away my illness and my fears. I continued to lay there in my delusional state until I heard a familiar voice call my name.\\n\\n “Ellery, what the f**k do you think you’re doing, are you crazy?” I looked at him as he was walking towards me holding an umbrella.\\n\\n “Are you, for coming out here after me?”\\n\\n I saw his jaw tighten as he approached me, “Look at you, you’re soaked; get up now before you get sick.”\\n\\n I laughed, “I’m already sick, what’s the difference?”\\n\\n He stared down at me with a strange look on his face and did something I never thought Connor Black would do. He laid down beside me and looked up at the sky. I looked over at him as he struggled to keep his eyes open as the rain pelted him in the face; a small smile crossed my lips.\\n\\n “Why are you doing this?” he asked as he turned and looked at me.\\n\\n “Cause I can lay here and no one will know I’m crying.”\\n\\n He looked at me for a moment and then back up at the falling rain. We laid there and didn’t speak a word. Connor put his hand on top of mine, and that was all the words we needed. Both of us were soaked, and I was starting to get cold. I sat up on my elbows.\\n\\n “I think it’s time to go.”\\n\\n He looked over at me and smiled, “Good because I can’t stand being wet like this.”\\n\\n I lightly laughed as we both got up and started walking out of the park. I suddenly stopped and turned the other way to some nearby bushes. I bent down as the nausea set in and I began to vomit. Connor waited for me to finish as he put his arms under my legs, picked me up and carried me to the car. That was all I needed to feel safe again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-black-forever-1/page-22.html","bookId":1821,"book":{"id":1821,"title":"Forever Black (Forever #1)","description":"Storyline: When Ellery moved to New York with her boyfriend, she thought they’d live happily ever after in their small New York apartment.
