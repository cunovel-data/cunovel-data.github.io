This is my glimpse of a future; it looks so peaceful there.”\\n\\n “It’s very beautiful, I suggest you keep it and don’t sell it,” he said.\\n\\n I kissed him on the cheek, “Maybe I will.”\\n\\n I paused for a moment as I looked into the depth of my painting, “I was going to tell you, ya know.”\\n\\n He reached for my hands and brought my arms around his waist, “Tell me what?”\\n\\n I took in a sharp breath, “About coming here and seeing Dr. Murphy. I wanted to talk to you about it that day but you were so angry; I heard you on the phone, in your office, with Ashlyn.”\\n\\n He looked down, “I’m sorry, I never should have said those things to you, I was…” He couldn’t find the words he needed to say, so I interrupted him.\\n\\n “You need to tell me about her Connor, we can never move forward if you don’t and I think I have a right to know.”\\n\\n He turned around so he was facing me and pressed his forehead against mine, “I know and I will just not tonight baby.”\\n\\n I was starting to wonder if he was ever going to tell me because if not, I would have to find out for myself and that was something I didn’t want to have to do. I sighed as we headed to the bedroom.\\n\\n I awoke to the sensation of my neck being covered in small light kisses. I smiled as I rolled over to view the sexy man who was sending shivers throughout my body.\\n\\n “Happy Birthday baby,” he smiled as he lightly kissed my lips.\\n\\n I interlaced our fingers and nestled into his chest, “Thank you.”\\n\\n It amazed me how fast things changed. I was dreading this day not too long ago for the fear of celebrating alone. Not that I would celebrate because it was just 8 short years ago that I was diagnosed with cancer the first time and here I am facing it again, but Connor being here made things better; he made me feel safe and happy.\\n\\n “Don’t move,” he said as he swiftly got off the bed. I bit my lower lip anxiously waiting for his return.\\n\\n Wearing only dark gray pajama bottoms he strutted into the bedroom holding a tray. I could do nothing short of holding my breath as I looked at his perfectly chiseled chest and his exposed h*ps as his bottoms hung so perfectly below them. Connor Black knew he was a sexy man and he didn’t have any trouble letting me know. He sat the tray across my legs and sat down next to me. With a grin that went from ear to ear, I looked down at the scrambled eggs, bagel, fruit and bacon that sat before me.\\n\\n “How, when, where?”\\n\\n He laughed as he took my fork and stabbed the eggs, “Since you didn’t have anything besides eggs, I headed down the street to the café.”\\n\\n He smiled as he opened his hand and handed me my daily dose of 15 pills; needless to say I rolled my eyes. He picked up the fork and brought it to my mouth as I graciously removed the eggs from it.\\n\\n “You are amazing,” I smiled.\\n\\n I grabbed the fork from his hand and shared my eggs and bacon with him. A happiness grew inside me I never thought could exist. I was too happy and it scared me; it scared me to death because all I kept thinking was nothing lasts forever and I never wanted this feeling to end.\\n\\n “Present time,” he smiled as he reached one arm under the bed. He pulled out 3 beautifully wrapped boxes and then removed the tray from my lap.\\n\\n “I love presents,” I squealed.\\n\\n The expression on his face was of pure bliss. He was just as happy in this moment as I was. He handed me the first box and I carefully unwrapped it. My mouth dropped as I pulled a new iPhone out of the box.\\n\\n “Your phone number is the same as your old phone; you know the one you threw away?” he smirked. “Who just throws away their phone?” he shook his head.\\n\\n I playfully smacked him on his arm, “I’m crazy remember?”\\n\\n He laughed and kissed me on the head. I turned the phone on and instantly there were text messages from all my friends wishing me a happy birthday.\\n\\n A text from Peyton read, “Happy birthday bitch, nah, you know I love you, call me soon, we have a lot to catch up on.” By the way have lots of birthday sex you deserve it.”\\n\\n I shook my head and laughed. Connor knew how Peyton was so he didn’t even ask what she said, he could just tell by my reaction.\\n\\n He took the phone from my hand and set it on the bed while he handed me the next box. I smiled as I bit my bottom lip anxiously unwrapping, excited like a child on Christmas morning, the perfect silver square box. I removed the top and inside sat a stunning silver bracelet with the infinity symbol encased in diamonds. I gasped as I ran my finger along the diamonds.\\n\\n “Connor, I…I love it. This is the most beautiful gift anyone has ever given me.”\\n\\n He took the box from my hand and took out the bracelet. He unclasped it and put it on my wrist. “I love you, not only for who you are, but for the person I have become because of you. This is my forever to you.”\\n\\n The uncontrollable tears that seemed to plague my face recently started their trail down my cheeks, but were quickly stopped by Connors response.\\n\\n “Oh no you don’t, there will be no tears on your birthday, whether they’re good tears or not; I forbid it, do you understand Miss Lane?” I couldn’t help but break into laughter at his commanding voice.\\n\\n I wrapped my arms around him as tight as I could and met his mouth with mine. He responded, but quickly broke our kiss, “You still have one more present to open.”\\n\\n I smiled as I leaned back on my pillow. “You spoil me.”\\n\\n He handed me the long box as he smiled. I took the box and with the same finesse, I un-wrapped it like the others. I took off the top and stared at the voucher inside. I looked at Connor as my eyes started to swell.\\n\\n “Don’t do it, no tears.”\\n\\n I couldn’t help it this time, my emotions were too far fallen for inside the box were 2 tickets to Paris. As he looked at me, he gently wiped the tears from under my eyes.\\n\\n “I know your dream is to go to Paris, I saw it on that list you hid in your desk and as soon as the doctor says it’s ok, we will be on the first flight there for however long you want to stay.”\\n\\n I couldn’t believe he remembered what was on my bucket list from that brief minute he looked at it. I was overwhelmed at the love I was receiving from this man who not too long ago couldn’t bring himself to love anyone. I straddled him and cupped his face in my hands.\\n\\n “Thank you for everything, I love you Connor Black,” I said as I kissed him and showed him for the next two hours how grateful I was.\\n\\n The day was perfect. All days were perfect when I spent them with Connor. It didn’t matter if we were held up in a cave in the middle of nowhere, it would still be perfect. Mason and Landon were taking us to a swank bar in downtown Los Angeles for my birthday. They had it planned before we knew Connor would be here, but he was game and said it sounded like fun.\\n\\n Chapter 34\\n\\n We entered the bar as Mason pulled us through the crowd of people to a booth in the back. The side we sat on was the one with the stage and a piano; it’s the stage where the local bands perform. But there was no band playing tonight; it was a free for all for any patron who wanted to show off their talent on stage.\\n\\n We sat in the round booth, Connor on one side of me and Landon on the other. A redheaded waitress, dressed in tiny black skirt that barely covered her ass and a tank top that was exposing her entire br**sts, came over to our table to take our drink orders. Landon and Mason ordered a couple of martinis each and Connor ordered a scotch. I could tell Connor was uncomfortable because she was eyeing him up and down instead of taking my order, and he was afraid of another comment like the one at the seafood restaurant. He looked at me and could see me gearing up to say something, so he stepped in and put his arm around me.\\n\\n “My girlfriend will have a glass of white wine,” he smiled at her. She looked me up and down.\\n\\n “Oh, I thought she was with one of them.”\\n\\n I shifted in my seat as Landon pulled me in closer to him. “Sweetheart, she’s with all three of us and you should see the things she can do to us at the same time, OMG, it’s incredible.”\\n\\n She gave him a dirty look and walked away as the three of us did a high-five in the air and Connor sat there shaking his head. I leaned over and snuggled into him, taking in his scent that already was making me ache.\\n\\n “Don’t be jealous sweetheart; you know I love you more.”\\n\\n He laughed as he took his hand that was resting on his lap, placed it on my bare thigh and slowly moved it up my skirt, stopping as soon as his fingers reached the lace on my panties. My body shook and shivered as he grinned. The waitress brought our drinks and never took her eyes off me as she set them down on the table.\\n\\n Mason leaned over, “I think she likes you.” I laughed and took a sip of my wine.\\n\\n “Just stick to one glass tonight. I don’t think you should be drinking while taking that medication plus you have your injections in the morning,” Connor said as he moved his fingers passed the lace and was now touching bare skin. I jumped at his touch.\\n\\n “Thank you for your concern. I will take that under advisement,” I said with gritted teeth.\\n\\n Mason and Landon excused themselves as they saw a couple of friends across the bar. Connor smiled as they walked by, then took my chin in his hand and turned it toward him. “Do you want me to stop?” he asked seductively. My breathing started to increase as he lightly rubbed the area that was now pulsating for him.\\n\\n “What are you going to make me do? Come right here in the bar in front of everyone?” I asked almost breathless.\\n\\n He gave me that seductive smile and twisted my h*ps so I was sitting sideways facing him in the booth.\\n\\n “That was my plan, but you have to act like nothing is happening.”\\n\\n He gently inserted his finger as I bit by bottom lip. I looked around the bar to see if anyone was paying attention, but everyone was drinking, dancing and carrying on conversations. My skin ignited and my heart raced as he inserted another finger and began rubbing my aching spot with his thumb. “Oh fuck,” I said as I buried my head into his neck.\\n\\n I wrapped my arm around him to make it look like I was hugging him as he moved his fingers in and out. “Why are you doing this to me?” I asked as he was starting to bring me to orgasm.\\n\\n He brought his lips to my ear, “Because I like pleasuring you and I know you want it. You’re so wet Ellery.”\\n\\n My body was preparing enter oblivion and he knew it; he could feel it. “Remember you need to be quiet.”\\n\\n Easy for him to say; he’s not the one getting off in a public place, and it’s not so easy to keep quiet when Connor Black is bringing you to the edge of an orgasm. I tightened my hand around the back of his neck, digging my fingers into his delicate skin, my mouth was on his neck lightly nipping at it with my teeth; he started to groan. Game on, it was payback time.\\n\\n My body reached the point of no return as I squeezed my eyes shut and buried my mouth deep into his neck and released over his fingers. I nipped on his ear lope which sent him over the edge. As soon as he was sure my orgasm was over he grabbed my hand and slid out of the seat. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-black-forever-1/page-27.html","bookId":1821,"book":{"id":1821,"title":"Forever Black (Forever #1)","description":"Storyline: When Ellery moved to New York with her boyfriend, she thought they’d live happily ever after in their small New York apartment.
