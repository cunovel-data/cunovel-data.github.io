He stopped and pointed to the sky, “Look the sun is starting to set.” I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and comfort at that moment. Connor took my hands and held them as he faced me taking in a deep breath. “Ellery, from the moment I saw you I knew instantly I needed you in my life and I set out to make sure that happened. You kept calling me a stalker and you were right, I did stalk you, but for good reason.” I smiled as he continued. “You are different from anyone I have ever met. You’re strong, kind, good-hearted, forgiving and loving. And you’re also stubborn, a smart ass and very independent and that’s everything I love about you. You have certainly given me a run for my money since I’ve met you. You’ve challenged me and brought out a man I thought I never could be. You’ve shown me things I never would have seen if you weren’t in my life. You have filled the void in my heart and soul that I never knew existed until you weren’t by my side.” Tears started to fall down my face. “I was simply a man with no meaning until I met you and I’m proud of whom I’ve become because of you. We have been through a lot together and we will continue to go through a lot, but we’ll conquer whatever life throws our way. I want to thank you for being my best friend and my lover.” Suddenly he got down on one knee and pulled a small velvet box from his pocket. The tears wouldn’t stop flowing down my face. “I want to be more than just your lover, I want to be your happily ever after, your best friend, your husband and I want you for my wife; will you marry me Ellery Lane?” He opened the box and took out the most beautiful ring I have ever seen. I looked at him, crying as I shook my head, “Yes Connor, I will marry you.” He put the ring on my finger and stood up, hugging me and twirling me around. We kissed passionately and then looked up at the sunset. “I wanted to do this here because I figured you’d want your mom to be here with us.” I was touched in so many ways by this man. We stood and watched the sunset over the ocean waters wrapped around each other and never wanting to let go. He led me back to the table as we ate dinner and talked. “I saw the tape your mom made for you; last night when we got back from the club and I slept on the couch. I turned the TV on and it was playing. That had to be so hard for you watch.” “It was at first, but then it was comforting at the same time. It was amazing to see her and I regret not getting the contents of that safe deposit box sooner.” I kept looking at my ring that gracefully sat on my finger. It was a 4 carat platinum princess cut diamond with smaller diamonds going down the band. “A beautiful ring for a beautiful woman,” he smiled. He stood up and took my hand and led me a large white tent that was filled with fluffy pillows and blankets. A huge grin crossed my face, “Sex on the beach?” He shook his head, “Yes, sex on the beach.” He walked over to me and slid the spaghetti straps off my shoulders allowing my entire dress to fall at my feet. I stood there in only my white lace panties as his tongue traveled across my neck and up my jaw line before meeting my mouth with his. “I want to make love to you all night, first here and then at home in every room. When you walk tomorrow you’ll be reminded of our passionate night, one I never want you to forget.” I braced myself for the amazing hot sex that was about to take place. After all it has been a while and I craved him like chocolate. He laid me down on the soft pillow and watched me as he took off his shirt and removed his pants and boxers. Every time I look at him it amazes me how blessed this man was in the “goods” department. He bent down and laid on his side propped up on his elbow as he softly stroked my br**sts, paying special attention to each hardened nipple as he twisted them in his fingers. I ran my hand through his hair and brought his head closer for a kiss. Our lips grew hot as our tongues were reunited with each other. With finesse, he moved his hand up and down my torso and into my lace panties feeling my wetness and my ache for him. “Christ you are so wet,” he moaned. His lips broke from mine as he kissed each breast, making his way down to my belly button and kissing me softly inside my inner thighs. He gently inserted his finger in me and feeling the wetness before inserting another. I gasped at the pleasure and arched my back for him to go deeper. His tongue ran circles around my swollen area forcing me to release my pleasure to him. He quickly placed his mouth where his fingers had been, sucking lightly and licking every sensitive area. My heart was beating rapidly as his erotic moves were scorching my skin. He brought his mouth up to mine giving me a taste of what he loves so much. I reached down and took him in my hand, stroking the length of him with long soft strokes. Groans came from the back of this throat as his mouth was lightly licking behind my ear. “Connor I need you inside me now, please I need to feel you.” He moaned and before I knew it I was flipped on my stomach as he entered me slowly from behind. Is this how you want me?” he asked. “Yes,” I whispered. He sat up and moved fluently in and out of me. He reached his hands around and grabbed my br**sts, squeezing them and pinching at each nipple before moving his hand down and rubbing my aching spot. “Don’t come yet baby, I need you to come with me.” “Harder Connor, f**k me harder, right now!” I demanded. I was never usually that vocal, but something inside me snapped and I wanted him hard and fast. He took in a sharp breath as he moved faster in and out of me. He was bringing me to orgasm quickly as I screamed his name and we both felt each other’s release. “Fuck,” he said as he pushed himself deeper into me releasing all his pleasure into my body. He proceeded to kiss up and down my back before collapsing on me. I could feel his heart rapidly beating as he was trying to catch his breath. I wrapped my arms around his neck and stroked his hair. “I love you,” I whispered. “I love you to Ellery.” We spent a couple of more hours in the tent, drinking wine and talking. Then as promised, we made love in every room back at my apartment. Chapter 43 Before we left for New York, we stopped by Mason and Landon’s apartment so I could give them their gifts and show off my gorgeous ring. They made us some Mimosas and an elegant breakfast before we headed to Connors plane. Denny was there sitting in a seat when we arrived. I ran to him and gave him a hug. “You knew didn’t you?” He smiled and kissed me on the cheek, “Of course I knew and congratulations.” We arrived in New York and back to Connors penthouse. The Christmas holiday was beautiful and well spent with family and friends. Connor and I spent New Year’s Eve hosting a party at the Waldorf Hotel with about 200 people. We rented a room for the night and made passionate love. He wrapped his arms around me as I laid my head on his chest. “What’s wrong babe?” he asked. I looked up at him, “Nothing, what makes you think something is wrong?” He lightly smiled and ran his finger across my lips, “I can tell when something is bothering you.” I sighed and laid my head back down. “Talk to me Ellery; tell me what’s on your mind.” I ran my hand lightly across his chest, “What if this trial program doesn’t help me?” “It will help you.” I sat up and turned towards the edge of the bed letting my feet hit the floor. “You can’t be so sure of that Connor.” He sat up and clasped his hands on my shoulders, “I can be sure because I have faith Ellery. It’s a new year and a new beginning for us, for our future, and nothing is going to take that away. You will get better and we’ll be married and have the rest of our lives in front of us.” I wasn’t so sure and I was scared. “There’s something I want to talk to you about.” The seriousness of his tone made me uneasy. I turned to face him as he pushed my hair behind my ear. “I’ve made an appointment with my doctor to have my vasectomy reversed.” My eyes grew wide. “What? Connor, no you can’t.” He looked at me with a surprised look. “Listen to me; I want this because I want a family with you and if we can have our own child that would be amazing. I’m not saying it will work, but there’s a 50/50 chance and I think we should try it.” I sighed. “But my genes suck and you know it.” He laughed and planted a kiss on my forehead, “Your genes are beautiful.” I smiled as he took me in his arms. “I’m just scared.” “Don’t worry baby, everything will be fine, I promise.” We stayed in New York for a couple more weeks so Connor could tie up some business deals then headed back to California for my last round of injections. “Well, this is it Ellery, are you ready?” Dr. Murphy asked. “As ready as I’ll ever be,” I smiled. Connor took a hold of my hands and planted them firmly against his shirt. I smiled as my hands began clutching the fabric with each burning injection. “One month from today you’ll be back here for blood work,” Dr. Murphy instructed. Connor took my hand and helped me from the bed. He pulled me into an embrace and whispered in my ear, “Now we wait.” Epilogue I stood at the edge of the shoreline looking out into the depths of the water. Today was my mom’s birthday, and there was no place I felt closer to her than here. I wished so bad she and my dad could have been here to see Connor and I and how happy we are. If there was a time in my life I needed my mom most, it was now. I stood and watched the waves as they crashed into the shore remembering the day he brought me here 10 months ago. Connor took my hand as he led me, blindfolded, somewhere he called a surprise. I was still in my wedding dress because he wouldn’t let me change out of it; he said he wanted the honor of undressing his new bride. “Are you ready darling?” “Yes, I was ready forever ago.” He laughed as he removed my blindfold. I gasped as I stood in front of what felt like one of my paintings. Standing before us was the Cape Cod style house I painted in my picture. “Connor, what is this?” I could hardly speak. I looked around and we weren’t in New York anymore; this looked like the Hampton\u0027s. He took my hand and led me to the porch, “This house is your wedding present.” My heart started racing with excitement. This house was exactly like the one I painted. I was breathless, speechless as my mind tried to figure out what was going on. He picked me up and carried me through the door. “Do you like it?” he asked. “Like it? I love it, but I don’t understand.” He smiled and gently kissed my lips, “This is our second home. We will spend our weekends and summers here.” He put me down and took my hand as he led me to the back of the house. Tears started to roll down my face as I stepped out onto the deck and took in the beauty of what was before me. He had everything built just like I painted. I admired the short stone wall that went around the property. There was an archway that sat over small steps leading to the beach. My favorite flowers lined the walkway. But the one thing; the very one thing that made the property so perfect, was the lighthouse that sat off to the side of the house. Connor stood behind me and let me take it all in. I turned to him as he softly wiped a couple of tears that sat upon my cheek.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-black-forever-1/page-34.html","bookId":1821,"book":{"id":1821,"title":"Forever Black (Forever #1)","description":"Storyline: When Ellery moved to New York with her boyfriend, she thought they’d live happily ever after in their small New York apartment.
