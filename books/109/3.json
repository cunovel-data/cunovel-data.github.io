Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. \n [bbe] God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. The heavens were covered with his glory, and the earth was full of his praise. \n 3:4 [hgb] 他 的 辉 煌 如 同 日 光 。 从 他 手 里 射 出 光 线 。 在 其 中 藏 着 他 的 能 力 。 \n [kjv] And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power. \n [bbe] He was shining like the light; he had rays coming out from his hand: there his power was kept secret. \n 3:5 [hgb] 在 他 前 面 有 瘟 疫 流 行 ， 在 他 脚 下 有 热 症 发 出 。 \n [kjv] Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet. \n [bbe] Before him went disease, and flames went out at his feet. \n 3:6 [hgb] 他 站 立 ， 量 了 大 地 （ 或 作 使 地 震 动 ） ， 观 看 ， 赶 散 万 民 。 永 久 的 山 崩 裂 ， 长 存 的 岭 塌 陷 。 他 的 作 为 与 古 时 一 样 。 \n [kjv] He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting. \n [bbe] From his high place he sent shaking on the earth; he saw and nations were suddenly moved: and the eternal mountains were broken, the unchanging hills were bent down; his ways are eternal. \n 3:7 [hgb] 我 见 古 珊 的 帐 棚 遭 难 ， 米 甸 的 幔 子 战 兢 。 \n [kjv] I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. \n [bbe] The curtains of Cushan were troubled, and the tents of Midian were shaking. \n 3:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 乘 在 马 上 ， 坐 在 得 胜 的 车 上 ， 岂 是 不 喜 悦 江 河 ， 向 江 河 发 怒 气 ， 向 洋 海 发 愤 恨 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation? \n [bbe] Was your wrath burning against the rivers? were you angry with the sea, that you went on your horses, on your war-carriages of salvation? \n 3:9 [hgb] 你 的 弓 全 然 显 露 。 向 众 支 派 所 起 的 誓 ， 都 是 可 信 的 。 （ 细 拉 ） 你 以 江 河 分 开 大 地 。 \n [kjv] Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. \n [bbe] Your bow was quite uncovered. Selah. By you the earth was cut through with rivers. \n 3:10 [hgb] 山 岭 见 你 ， 无 不 战 惧 。 大 水 泛 滥 过 去 ， 深 渊 发 声 ， 汹 涌 翻 腾 。 （ 原 文 作 向 上 举 手 ） 。 \n [kjv] The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high. \n [bbe] The mountains saw you and were moved with fear; the clouds were streaming with water: the voice of the deep was sounding; the sun did not come up, and the moon kept still in her place. \n 3:11 [hgb] 因 你 的 箭 射 出 发 光 ， 你 的 枪 闪 出 光 耀 ， 日 月 都 在 本 宫 停 住 。 \n [kjv] The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear. \n [bbe] At the light of your arrows they went away, at the shining of your polished spear. \n 3:12 [hgb] 你 发 愤 恨 通 行 大 地 。 发 怒 气 责 打 列 国 ， 如 同 打 粮 。 \n [kjv] Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger. \n [bbe] You went stepping through the land in wrath, crushing the nations in your passion. \n 3:13 [hgb] 你 出 来 要 拯 救 你 的 百 姓 ， 拯 救 你 的 受 膏 者 ， 打 破 恶 人 家 长 的 头 。 露 出 他 的 脚 ， （ 脚 原 文 作 根 基 ） ， 直 到 颈 项 。 （ 细 拉 ） \n [kjv] Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck.

To the chief singer on my stringed instruments. \n [bbe] The Lord God is my strength, and he makes my feet like roes\u0027 feet, guiding me on my high places. For the chief music-maker on corded instruments. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/146/2072.html","bookId":109,"book":{"id":109,"title":"哈巴谷书 Habakkuk","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 先 知 哈 巴 谷 所 得 的 默 示 。 [kjv] The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
