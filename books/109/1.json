I make an outcry to you about violent behaviour, but you do not send salvation. \n 1:3 [hgb] 你 为 何 使 我 看 见 罪 孽 ？ 你 为 何 看 着 奸 恶 而 不 理 呢 ？ 毁 灭 和 强 暴 在 我 面 前 。 又 起 了 争 端 和 相 斗 的 事 。 \n [kjv] Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention. \n [bbe] Why do you make me see evil-doing, and why are my eyes fixed on wrong? for wasting and violent acts are before me: and there is fighting and bitter argument. \n 1:4 [hgb] 因 此 律 法 放 松 ， 公 理 也 不 显 明 。 恶 人 围 困 义 人 。 所 以 公 理 显 然 颠 倒 。 \n [kjv] Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. \n [bbe] For this reason the law is feeble and decisions are not effected: for the upright man is circled round by evil-doers; because of which right is twisted. \n 1:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 们 要 向 列 国 中 观 看 ， 大 大 惊 奇 。 因 为 在 你 们 的 时 候 ， 我 行 一 件 事 ， 虽 有 人 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 总 是 不 信 。 \n [kjv] Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you. \n [bbe] See among the nations, and take note, and be full of wonder: for in your days I am doing a work in which you will have no belief, even if news of it is given to you. \n 1:6 [hgb] 我 必 兴 起 迦 勒 底 人 ， 就 是 那 残 忍 暴 躁 之 民 ， 通 行 遍 地 ， 占 据 那 不 属 自 己 的 住 处 。 \n [kjv] For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs. \n [bbe] For see, I am sending the Chaldaeans, that bitter and quick-moving nation; who go through the wide spaces of the earth to get for themselves living-places which are not theirs. \n 1:7 [hgb] 他 威 武 可 畏 。 判 断 和 势 力 ， 都 任 意 发 出 。 \n [kjv] They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves. \n [bbe] They are greatly to be feared: their right comes from themselves. \n 1:8 [hgb] 他 的 马 比 豹 更 快 ， 比 晚 上 的 豺 狼 更 猛 。 马 兵 踊 跃 争 先 ， 都 从 远 方 而 来 ， 他 们 飞 跑 如 鹰 抓 食 。 \n [kjv] Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. \n [bbe] And their horses are quicker than leopards and their horsemen more cruel than evening wolves; they come from far away, like an eagle in flight rushing on its food. \n 1:9 [hgb] 都 为 行 强 暴 而 来 。 定 住 脸 面 向 前 ， 将 掳 掠 的 人 聚 集 ， 多 如 尘 沙 。 \n [kjv] They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. \n [bbe] They are coming all of them with force; the direction of their faces is forward, the number of their prisoners is like the sands of the sea. \n 1:10 [hgb] 他 们 讥 诮 君 王 ， 笑 话 首 领 ， 嗤 笑 一 切 保 障 ， 筑 垒 攻 取 。 \n [kjv] And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it. \n [bbe] He makes little of kings, rulers are a sport to him; all the strong places are to be laughed at; for he makes earthworks and takes them. \n 1:11 [hgb] 他 以 自 己 的 势 力 为 神 ， 像 风 猛 然 扫 过 ， 显 为 有 罪 。 \n [kjv] Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god. \n [bbe] Then his purpose will be changed, over-stepping the limit; he will make his strength his god. \n 1:12 [hgb] 耶 和 华 我 的 神 ， 我 的 圣 者 阿 ， 你 不 是 从 亘 古 而 有 吗 ？ 我 们 必 不 致 死 。 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 派 定 他 为 要 刑 罚 人 。 磐 石 阿 ， 你 设 立 他 为 要 惩 治 人 。 \n [kjv] Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. \n [bbe] Are you not eternal, O Lord my God, my Holy One? for you there is no death. O Lord, he has been ordered by you for our punishment; and by you, O Rock, he has been marked out to put us right. \n 1:13 [hgb] 你 眼 目 清 洁 ， 不 看 邪 僻 ， 不 看 奸 恶 。 行 诡 诈 的 ， 你 为 何 看 着 不 理 呢 ？ 恶 人 吞 灭 比 自 己 公 义 的 ， 你 为 何 静 默 不 语 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he? \n [bbe] Before your holy eyes sin may not be seen, and you are unable to put up with wrong; why, then, are your eyes on the false? why do you say nothing when the evil-doer puts an end to one who is more upright than himself? \n 1:14 [hgb] 你 为 何 使 人 如 海 中 的 鱼 ， 又 如 没 有 管 辖 的 爬 物 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? \n [bbe] He has made men like the fishes of the sea, like the worms which have no ruler over them. \n 1:15 [hgb] 他 用 钩 钩 住 ， 用 网 捕 获 ， 用 拉 网 聚 集 他 们 。 因 此 ， 他 欢 喜 快 乐 。 \n [kjv] They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. \n [bbe] He takes them all up with his hook, he takes them in his net, getting them together in his fishing-net: for which cause he is glad and full of joy. \n 1:16 [hgb] 就 向 网 献 祭 ， 向 网 烧 香 。 因 他 由 此 得 肥 美 的 分 ， 和 富 裕 的 食 物 。 \n [kjv] Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous. \n [bbe] For this reason he makes an offering to his net, burning perfume to his fishing-net; because by them he gets much food and his meat is fat. \n 1:17 [hgb] 他 岂 可 屡 次 倒 空 网 罗 ， 将 列 国 的 人 时 常 杀 戮 ， 毫 不 顾 惜 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations? \n [bbe] For this cause his net is ever open, and there is no end to his destruction of the nations. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/146/2070.html","bookId":109,"book":{"id":109,"title":"哈巴谷书 Habakkuk","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 先 知 哈 巴 谷 所 得 的 默 示 。 [kjv] The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
