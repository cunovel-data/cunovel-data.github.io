and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay! \n [bbe] Will not all these take up a word of shame against him and a bitter saying against him, and say, A curse on him who goes on taking what is not his and is weighted down with the property of debtors! \n 2:7 [hgb] 咬 伤 你 的 岂 不 忽 然 起 来 ， 扰 害 你 的 岂 不 兴 起 ， 你 就 作 他 们 的 掳 物 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? \n [bbe] Will not your creditors suddenly be moved against you, and your troublers get up from their sleep, and you will be to them like goods taken in war? \n 2:8 [hgb] 因 你 抢 夺 许 多 的 国 ， 杀 人 流 血 ， 向 国 内 的 城 ， 并 城 中 一 切 居 民 施 行 强 暴 ， 所 以 各 国 剩 下 的 民 ， 都 必 抢 夺 你 。 \n [kjv] Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men\u0027s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. \n [bbe] Because you have taken their goods from great nations, all the rest of the peoples will take your goods from you; because of men\u0027s blood and violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it. \n 2:9 [hgb] 为 本 家 积 蓄 不 义 之 财 ， 在 高 处 搭 窝 ， 指 望 免 灾 的 有 祸 了 。 \n [kjv] Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil! \n [bbe] A curse on him who gets evil profits for his family, so that he may put his resting-place on high and be safe from the hand of the wrongdoer! \n 2:10 [hgb] 你 图 谋 剪 除 多 国 的 民 ， 犯 了 罪 ， 使 你 的 家 蒙 羞 ， 自 害 己 命 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul. \n [bbe] You have been a cause of shame to your house by cutting off a number of peoples, and sinning against your soul. \n 2:11 [hgb] 墙 里 的 石 头 必 呼 叫 ， 房 内 的 栋 梁 必 应 声 。 \n [kjv] For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it. \n [bbe] For the stone will give a cry out of the wall, and it will be answered by the board out of the woodwork. \n 2:12 [hgb] 以 人 血 建 城 ， 以 罪 孽 立 邑 的 有 祸 了 。 \n [kjv] Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity! \n [bbe] A curse on him who is building a place with blood, and basing a town on evil-doing! \n 2:13 [hgb] 众 民 所 劳 碌 得 来 的 被 火 焚 烧 ， 列 国 由 劳 乏 而 得 的 ， 归 于 虚 空 ， 不 都 是 出 于 万 军 之 耶 和 华 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity? \n [bbe] See, is it not the pleasure of the Lord of armies that the peoples are working for the fire and using themselves up for nothing? \n 2:14 [hgb] 认 识 耶 和 华 荣 耀 的 知 识 ， 要 充 满 遍 地 ， 好 像 水 充 满 洋 海 一 般 。 \n [kjv] For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. \n [bbe] For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the sea is covered by the waters. \n 2:15 [hgb] 给 人 酒 喝 ， 又 加 上 毒 物 ， 使 他 喝 醉 ， 好 看 见 他 下 体 的 ， 有 祸 了 。 \n [kjv] Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! \n [bbe] A curse on him who gives his neighbour the wine of his wrath, making him overcome with strong drink from the cup of his passion, so that you may be a witness of their shame! \n 2:16 [hgb] 你 满 受 羞 辱 ， 不 得 荣 耀 。 你 也 喝 吧 ， 显 出 是 未 受 割 礼 的 。 耶 和 华 右 手 的 杯 ， 必 传 到 你 那 里 ， 你 的 荣 耀 ， 就 变 为 大 大 的 羞 辱 。 \n [kjv] Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD\u0027s right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory. \n [bbe] You are full of shame in place of glory: take your part in the drinking, and let your shame be uncovered: the cup of the Lord\u0027s right hand will come round to you and your glory will be covered with shame. \n 2:17 [hgb] 你 向 利 巴 嫩 行 强 暴 ， 与 残 害 惊 吓 野 兽 的 事 ， 必 遮 盖 你 。 因 你 杀 人 流 血 ， 向 国 内 的 城 ， 并 城 中 一 切 居 民 ， 施 行 强 暴 。 \n [kjv] For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men\u0027s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. \n [bbe] For the violent acts against Lebanon will come on you, and the destruction of the cattle will be a cause of fear to you, because of men\u0027s blood and the violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it. \n 2:18 [hgb] 雕 刻 的 偶 像 ， 人 将 它 刻 出 来 ， 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？ 铸 造 的 偶 像 ， 就 是 虚 谎 的 师 傅 。 制 造 者 倚 靠 这 哑 巴 偶 像 ， 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？ \n [kjv] What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? \n [bbe] What profit is the pictured image to its maker? and as for the metal image, the false teacher, why does its maker put his faith in it, making false gods without a voice? \n 2:19 [hgb] 对 木 偶 说 ， 醒 起 ， 对 哑 巴 石 像 说 ， 起 来 ， 那 人 有 祸 了 。 这 个 还 能 教 训 人 吗 ？ 看 哪 ， 是 包 裹 金 银 的 ， 其 中 毫 无 气 息 。 \n [kjv] Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. \n [bbe] A curse on him who says to the wood, Awake! to the unbreathing stone, Up! let it be a teacher! See, it is plated with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all inside it. \n 2:20 [hgb] 惟 耶 和 华 在 他 的 圣 殿 中 。 全 地 的 人 ， 都 当 在 他 面 前 肃 敬 静 默 。 \n [kjv] But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him. \n [bbe] But the Lord is in his holy Temple: let all the earth be quiet before him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/146/2071.html","bookId":109,"book":{"id":109,"title":"哈巴谷书 Habakkuk","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 先 知 哈 巴 谷 所 得 的 默 示 。 [kjv] The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
