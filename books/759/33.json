{"id":26809,"no":33,"title":"BOOKS OF THE SEA","content":"The National Marine League asks, What are the ten best books of the sea? Without pondering very deeply on the matter, and confining ourself to prose, we would suggest the following as our own favourites: Typhoon, by Joseph Conrad The Nigger of the \"Narcissus,\" by Joseph Conrad The Mirror of the Sea, by Joseph Conrad Captains Courageous, by Rudyard Kipling The Brassbounder, by David W. Bone Salt[183] of the Sea, by Morley Roberts Mr. Midshipman Easy, by Captain Marryat The Wreck of the \"Grosvenor,\" by Clark Russell Moby Dick, by Herman Melville An Ocean Tramp, by William McFee. If one is allowed to include books that deal partially with salt water, one would have to add \"Treasure Island,\" \"Casuals of the Sea,\" by McFee, and \"Old Junk,\" by Tomlinson. The kind of shallow-water sea tales that we love to read after supper, with our feet on the nearest chair and a decent supply of tobacco handy, are the delicious stories by W.W. Jacobs. Dana\u0027s \"Two Years Before the Mast,\" which is spoken of as a classic, we have never read. We have always had a suspicion of it, we don\u0027t know why. Before we tackle it we shall re-read \"The Water Babies.\" We have always found a good deal of innocent cheer in the passages in John Woolman\u0027s Journal describing his voyage from Philadelphia to London in 1772. Friend Woolman, like the sturdy Quaker that he was, was horrified (when he went to have a look at the ship Mary and Elizabeth) to find \"sundry sorts of carved work and imagery\" on that part of the vessel where the cabins were; and in the cabins themselves he observed \"some superfluity of workmanship of several sorts.\" This subjected his mind to \"a deep exercise,\" and he decided that he would have to take passage in the steerage instead of the cabin. Having our self made use of the steerage aforetime, both in the Mauretania and humbler vessels, we feel a certain kindred sympathy for his experiences. We have always enjoyed his remark:[184] \"The wind now blew vehemently, and the sea wrought to that degree that an awful seriousness prevailed.\" To come to poetry, we suppose that the greatest sea-poet who never ventured on anything more perilous than a ferry-boat was Walt Whitman. Walt, one likes to think, would have been horribly sea-sick if he had ventured out beyond the harbour buoy. A good deal of Walt\u0027s tempestuous uproar about the glories of America was undoubtedly due to the fact that he had never seen anything else. Speaking of Walt reminds us that one book of the sea that we have never read (for the best of reasons: it has not been written) might be done by Thomas Mosher, the veteran tippler of literary minims. Mr. Mosher, we understand, \"followed\" the sea in his youth. Not long ago, when Mr. Mosher published that exquisite facsimile of the 1855 \"Leaves of Grass,\" we asked him when and how he first came in contact with Whitman\u0027s work. He said: I don\u0027t suppose there was anything particularly interesting about my first acquaintance with Whitman, which at 14 years of age I made in my old family mansion situated at Smith\u0027s Corner, America. I had been taking \"The Galaxy\" from its start, only a few months previous to the date I mention. I can still see myself in the sitting room of the old house. Smith\u0027s Cor., America, I will remind you, is a portion of Biddeford, Me. An extra \"d\" has got into the old English name—which, by the way, only a year later I passed through after a shipwreck on the Devonshire coast. (That was in 1867.) No one ever told me anything about Walt. [185]These amateurish speculations on maritime books are of no value except for the fact that they elicited an interesting letter from an expert on these matters. William McFee wrote us as follows:— \"The first thing I laid my hands on this evening, while hunting for some forgotten nugget of wisdom in my note-books filled with Mediterranean brine, was that list of books for a projected sea library. Perpend.... The Sea Farer\u0027s Library \"A good many of these need no comment. Attention is drawn not to the individual items, but to the balance of the whole. That is the test of a list. But there is a good balance, a balance of power, and a balance of mere weight or prestige. It is the power we are after here. Regard for a moment the way \u0027Tom Cringle\u0027 balances Dana\u0027s laconic record of facts. No power on earth could hold \u0027Tom Cringle\u0027 to facts, with the result[186] that his story is more truly a representation of sea life in the old navy than a ton of statistics. He has the seaman\u0027s mind, which Dana had not. \"Then again \u0027Captains Courageous\u0027 and \u0027The Flying Cloud\u0027 balance each other with temperamental exactitude. Each is a fine account of sea-doings with a touch of fiction to keep the sailor reading, neither of them in the very highest class. \u0027The Cruise of the Cachalot\u0027 is balanced by the \u0027Log of a Sea Waif,\u0027 each in Bullen\u0027s happier and less evangelical vein. I was obliged to exclude \u0027With Christ at Sea,\u0027 not because it is religious, but because it does not balance. It would give the whole list a most pronounced \u0027list,\u0027 if you will pardon the unpardonable.... I regret this because \u0027With Christ at Sea\u0027 has some things in it which transcend anything else Bullen ever wrote. \"Now we come to a couple of books possibly requiring a little explanation. \u0027The Salving of a Derelict\u0027 is a remarkably able story of a man\u0027s reclamation. I believe Maurice Drake won a publisher\u0027s prize with it as a first novel some years ago. It was a winner among the apprentices, I remember. \u0027The Grain Carriers\u0027 is a grim story of greedy owners and an unseaworthy ship by an ex-master mariner whose \u0027Chains,\u0027 while not a sea story, is tinged with the glamour of South American shipping, and is obviously a work written under the influence of Joseph Conrad. \u0027Marooned\u0027 and \u0027Typhoon\u0027 balance (only you mustn\u0027t be too critical) as examples of the old and new methods of telling a sea story. \"\u0027The Sea Surgeon\u0027 is one of a collection of stories about the Pescarese, which D\u0027Annunzio wrote years ago. They are utterly unlike \u0027II Fuoco\u0027 and the other absurd tales on which translators waste their time. In passing one is permitted to complain of the persistent ill-fortune Italian novelists suffer at the hands of their English translators. [187]\"Assuming, however, that our seafarer wants a book or two of what is euphemistically termed \u0027non-fiction,\u0027 here are a few which will do him no harm: \"Southey\u0027s \u0027Life of Nelson.\u0027 \"\u0027The Influence of Sea Power Upon History,\u0027 Mahan. \"Admiral Lord Beresford\u0027s \u0027Memoirs.\u0027 \"The Diary of Samuel Pepys, F.R.S., Secretary to the Admiralty in the Reign of Charles II and James II. It is most grievously overlooked that Samuel was the first to draft a naval Rate Book, which is a sort of indexed lexicon of everything one needs \u0027for fighting and sea-going efficiency.\u0027 And it is a pleasure, chastened by occasional fits of ill-temper, to discover that the present British Naval Rate Book hath in it divers synonyms coeval with Samuel and his merry monarchs. As when the present writer tried to order some hammer-handles and discovered after much tribulation that the correct naval equivalent for such is \u0027ash-helms.\u0027 Whereupon he toilfully rewrote his requisitions \u0027and so to bed.\u0027 \"Another suggestion I might make is a volume to be compiled, containing the following chapters: \"Only deep-water sailors would be able to take this suggested library to sea with them, because a sailor only reads at sea. When the landward breeze brings [188]the odours of alien lands through the open scuttle one closes the book, and if one is a normal and rational kind of chap and the quarantine regulations permit, goes ashore.\" Gruesome as anything in any seafaring pirate yarn is Trelawny\u0027s description (in \"Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron\") of the burning of Shelley\u0027s body on the seashore near Via Reggio. The other day, in company with two like-minded innocents, we visited a bookshop on John Street where we found three battered copies of this great book, and each bought one, with shouts of joy. The following day, still having the book with us, we dropped in to see the learned and hospitable Dr. Rosenbach at his new and magnificent thesaurus at 273 Madison Avenue. We showed him the book, because every time one shows the doctor a book he can startle you by countering with its original manuscript or something of that sort. We said something about Shelley and Trelawny, in the hope of starting him off. He smiled gently and drew out a volume from a shelf. It was the copy of \"Prometheus Unbound\" that Shelley had given Trelawny in July, 1822, with an inscription. As the poet was drowned on July 8, 1822, it probably was the last book he ever gave away. One wonders what may have become of the log of the American clipper that Shelley and Trelawny visited in the harbour of Leghorn shortly before Shelley\u0027s death. Shelley had said something in praise of George Washington, to which the sturdy Yankee skipper replied: \"Stranger, truer words were never spoken; there is dry [189]rot in all the main timbers of the Old World, and none of you will do any good till you are docked, refitted, and annexed to the New. You must log that song you sang; there ain\u0027t many Britishers that will say as much of the man that whipped them; so just set these lines down in the log!\" Whereupon Shelley autographed the skipper\u0027s log for him, with some sentiments presumably gratifying to American pride, and drank some \"cool peach brandy.\" It was his last drink. We ourself, just as much as Shelley, enjoy visiting ships, and have had some surprising adventures in so doing. We remember very clearly our first call upon William McFee, when he was First Assistant Engineer in S.S. Turrialba. But getting aboard vessels is a much more complicated and diplomatic task than it was in Shelley\u0027s day. Even when armed with Mr. McFee\u0027s autographed card, it was by no means easy. We went dutifully up to the office of the United Fruit Company at Pier 9, to apply for a pass, and were surveyed with grim suspicion. Why, we asked gently, in these peaceful times is it so difficult to visit a friend who happens to be in a ship? Prohibition, said the candid clerk, and a whole province of human guile was thereby made plain to our shrinking mind. Mortals incline readily to sin, it seems, and apparently evil and base men will even go so far as to pretend a friendship with those who go down to wet territory in ships, simply for the sake of—well, we cannot bring ourself to mention it. \"How do you know Mr. McFee wants to see you?\" we were asked. Luckily we had Mac\u0027s card to prove it. [190]We had long wanted to see Mr. McFee in his sea-going quarters, where he writes his books and essays (so finely flavoured with a rich ironical skepticism as to the virtues of folk who live on shore). Never was a literary sanctum less like the pretentious studios of the imitation litterateurs. In a small cabin stood our friend, in his working dungarees (if that is what they are called) talking briskly with the Chief and another engineer. The conversation, in which we were immediately engulfed, was so vivacious that we had small chance to examine the surroundings as we would have liked to. But save for the typewriter on the desk and a few books in a rack, there was nothing to suggest literature. \"Plutarch\u0027s Lives,\" we noticed—a favourite of Mac\u0027s since boyhood; Frank Harris\u0027s \"The Bomb\" (which, however, the Chief insisted belonged to him), E.S. Martin\u0027s \"Windfalls of Observation,\" and some engineering works. We envied Mac the little reading lamp at the head of his bunk. We wish some of the soft-handed literary people who bleat about only being able to write in carefully purged and decorated surroundings could have a look at that stateroom. In just such compartments Mr. McFee has written for years, and expected to finish that night (in the two hours each day that he is able to devote to writing) his tale, \"Captain Macedoine\u0027s Daughter.\" As we talked there was a constant procession of in-comers, most of them seeming to the opaque observation of the layman to be firemen discussing matters of overtime. On the desk lay an amusing memorandum, which the Chief referred to jocularly as one [191]of Mac\u0027s \"works,\" anent some problem of whether the donkeyman was due certain overtime on a Sunday when the Turrialba lay in Hampton Roads waiting for coal. On the cabin door was a carefully typed list marked in Mr. McFee\u0027s hand \"Work to Do.\" It began something like this: Main Engine Pump-Link Brasses Fill Up Main Engine Feed Pump and Bilge Rams Open and Scale After Port Boiler Main Circulator Impeller to Examine Hydrokineter Valve on Centre Boiler to be Rejointed The delightful thing about Mr. McFee is that he can turn from these things, which he knows and loves, to talk about literary problems, and can out-talk most literary critics at their own game. He took us through his shining engines, showing us some of the beauty spots—the Weir pumps and the refrigerating machinery and the thrust-blocks (we hope we have these right), unconsciously inflicting upon us something of the pain it gives the bungling jack of several trades when he sees a man who is so fine a master not merely of one, but of two—two seemingly diverse, but in which the spirit of faith and service are the same. \"She\u0027s a bonny ship,\" he said, and his face was lit with sincerity as he said it. Then he washed his hands and changed into shore clothes and we went up to Frank\u0027s, where we had pork and beans and talked about Sir Thomas Browne. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3204/87566.html","bookId":759,"book":{"id":759,"title":"Plum Pudding","description":"简介： On Christmas Eve, while the Perfect Reader sits in his armchair immersed in a bookso absorbed that he has let the fire go outI propose to slip gently down the chimney and leave this tribute in his stocking.
