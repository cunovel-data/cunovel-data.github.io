My friends all went to sit at our usual table, watching me with curious eyes. I watched Liam as I approached. As usual there were about ten girls hanging around him, flirting shamelessly. He looked like he was really pissed off.\n “Seriously, Rebecca, if you touch me one more time I’m going to go speak to someone about it. This is bordering on sexual harassment,” Liam growled, glaring at her and knocking her hand off of his thigh. She looked extremely put out as she stood up and stormed off. The rest of the girls were smirking at her back. You could practically read their thoughts on their faces: One less girl for competition. I stifled a giggle and sat down at the table. Jake wasn’t there, so I decided to make the most of it and really push it today.\n “Hi, Liam,” I purred, smiling at him seductively.\n His face lit up as he saw me. “Hi. You had a good morning?” he asked happily. I pouted and shook my head. His face dropped and he put his arm around my shoulder, looking at me concerned. “What’s wrong, Angel?”\n I stood up and sat on the table in front of him, propping one foot on the bench in-between his legs so my foot was almost touching his crotch. He didn’t seem to notice though; he was still watching my face, worriedly. “I hurt my leg in gym class. It’s really sore. Do I have a bruise?” I asked, opening my legs slightly and pointing to my inner thigh. His eyes instantly dropped down to my legs. I’m betting he had a clear view of my panties because a pained, and hungry expression crossed his face. I felt a little like a slut for doing this but at least no one else could see what he was seeing otherwise I wouldn’t have done it.\n He put his hand on my calf muscle and slid it slowly all the way up my leg to my inner thigh, moaning quietly as he did it. “Nope, no bruise,” he stated in his sexy voice, making me burn in need as he massaged my thigh.\n “Hmm, really? It’s so sore,” I lied, smiling at him. He was smirking at me; his expression told me that he knew he was driving me crazy. “How about you kiss it better for me?” I suggested, raising my eyebrows, trying to look sexy. I heard some of the guys groan as they were obviously watching the exchange. Lust crossed Liam’s face as he nodded with a little sexy smile and bent his head towards my leg. Just before his lips touched my skin, I moved my leg away. “Actually, you’d better not. I thought you had a girlfriend,” I teased.\n He laughed and shook his head at me, narrowing his eyes, obviously disappointed he didn’t get to kiss my leg in front of the whole school. “I do have a girlfriend. I love her more than anything,” he said, his voice full of honesty.\n I smiled as my heart melted. “Well, you shouldn’t be doing this then, huh?” I teased, smirking at him and climbing down from the table. I grabbed my lunch tray. “It seems fine now anyway. Maybe if it starts hurting again later, I’ll give you a call,” I flirted.\n He groaned as I winked at him and walked off to my table of friends. I could hear the boys all making slutty comments behind me about how hot that was, and how they would definitely ‘tap that’, and the girls all saying what a whore I was. I giggled and plopped down at our table. Kate grinned at me knowingly, and Sarah and Sean were watching me with their mouths wide open.\n “You were so in there! I really think you might win the bet!” Sarah said, looking at me in awe.\n I couldn’t help but laugh at her; she was looking at me like I was some kind of goddess or something. “I could use four thousand bucks,” I admitted, laughing. I just hoped Jessica actually paid up once she realised I was his girlfriend all along.\n When we finished eating, I was walking along with my group of friends, when someone grabbed my hand and jerked me to a stop. I squeaked, a little shocked, and turned to see Liam grinning at me as he dragged me to the nearest empty classroom. I giggled as I watched my friends walk off without me, not even noticing I wasn’t behind them anymore. He closed the door and looked at me, trying to pretend he was annoyed with me but there was no way I was falling for that, he enjoyed himself I could tell.\n “Angel, that was way too much,” he stated as he stepped closer to me.\n I stepped back and bumped into the wall. “Too much? I thought it was pretty perfect,” I replied playfully.\n He laughed and pressed his body to mine. “You’re pretty perfect.” He brushed my hair away from my face gently, looking at me tenderly. I put my arms around him and pulled him closer, then moved my hands down to grip his ass. He smiled that sexy little smile at me and pressed his lips to mine gently; I whimpered slightly and pulled him closer, wanting more.\n He pulled away to kiss down my neck, his hands roaming down my body, across my legs. One of his hands slid under my skirt, tickling his fingers on my ass teasingly. I felt him sucking gently on my neck. “Liam, are you giving me a hicky?” I asked, giggling.\n He stopped sucking for a second and pulled his mouth away from my skin. “Mmm hmm, I’m branding you,” he murmured, before sucking on the same spot again. After a few more seconds he pulled away to look at it, inspecting his handiwork. He looked extremely proud of himself and was grinning from ear to ear.\n “Right, and do I get to brand you?” I teased.\n “Sure, if you want to,” he agreed, shrugging but actually looking a little hopeful. Did he actually want me to brand him? He pressed his lips to mine again, seeming to set my body on fire. Jeez, how on earth did he do this to me? He was the only guy I had kissed for goodness sake. Yet here I am, letting him put his hand on my ass! I grinned as he tipped his head to the side, giving me access to his neck. Just as my lips touched his skin the bell rang.\n He groaned and pulled away, looking at me with the cute puppy dog face again. “Skip with me,” he pleaded, pouting slightly.\n Skip with him? Oh crap I hated skipping school, that just wasn’t me at all! “Um, Liam, I can’t.” I was torn, I really wanted to spend time with him, but I just couldn’t bear the thought of my teachers knowing I missed class unnecessarily.\n “Please?” he begged, bending his knees so we were at the same height.\n His blue eyes were killing me. I couldn’t say no to him. I sighed heavily. “If I get caught, then you’re in deep trouble,” I warned. If I got detention, I would make sure he got one too.\n He laughed; a beautiful smile stretched across his face as he pulled out his cellphone and called Jake to tell him I wasn’t feeling well and that he was taking me home. “Yeah, she’s fine. No she said she feels a little dizzy, that’s all. No, no, I got it. OK great. See ya,” he said into the phone, grinning and shooting me a wink. He slid his phone back in his pocket and grabbed my hand, pulling me from the classroom out to his car. “Jake’s going to get a lift to work. So, as long as I get you home by nine, he won’t even know we skipped,” he said happily.\n I rolled my eyes at him. “Like Jake really believed that I was sick! He knows we’re skipping.” I shook my head, laughing. Jake wasn’t stupid, he just didn’t want to say anything.\n “Well then, Angel, what shall we do?” Liam asked, pulling out of the parking lot quickly before anyone noticed us leaving.\n I shrugged easily. “I don’t mind. Whatever you want.” As long as it involved spending more time with him, I would do anything.\n He grinned. “Want me to take you skating again?” he offered.\n “Sure, why not. I need to change first though; I’ll get frost bite on my butt otherwise.” I laughed as his eyes immediately shot down to my legs again. I text Kate to tell her I was skipping and asked her to collect any work that I missed.\n When we pulled outside my house, Liam went to his house to get something he said he needed, and I ran in and slipped on some jeans. I ran a brush through my hair and added a quick sweep of mascara. As I left my room, I grabbed a sweater so I didn’t get cold.\n I ran back to the car, excited for some alone time with him. He smiled as I climbed in. “Hey, brought you this,” he said, handing me one of his hoodies.\n I frowned at it, knowing I had one of my own. Why would he bring me this? “Er…. thanks?”\n “It’s for your peachy little ass. I told you I’d bring one so you didn’t get wet and cold like last time. Although, I have every confidence that you’ll be skating on your own by the end of the lesson,” he boasted, grinning.\n “Well, I’m not sure I want to skate if you’re not touching me,” I purred suggestively.\n He smiled. “Hmm, I never thought of that. Hopefully you won’t catch on too quickly then.” He waggled his eyebrows at me, making me laugh.\n Skating was fun. He was right, I was a lot better this time. It was probably due to the fact that he was such a good teacher, and because we spent almost all day here last time. He was so much fun to be around. He skated backwards just like he did before, holding both my hands, making jokes, and chatting. I only fell a few times and each time he would break my fall or catch me and pull me up. I looked at him as we skated, he was smiling broadly and my heart skipped a beat. He was so handsome, kind and patient. I could feel myself falling for him. I knew it wouldn’t be long before I was head over heels for him.\n “Hey, how about you show off a little? I love to watch you skate,” I suggested, gripping onto the side for dear life so he could let go of me.\n He kissed me before skating off backwards, he turned sharply and skated forwards so fast that it actually scared me. My heart was hammering in my chest at the sight of it. If he fell while skating like that, he would be seriously hurt. The thought of him being hurt terrified me. He did a few laps, showing me his skills like jumping and skating on one foot. I’d always loved to watch him skate. It looked so beautiful and graceful, but I never really lusted after him for it, until now. He looked so sexy when he was skating, so powerful and masterful.\n Liam wanted to play hockey professionally, he had already been scouted for a really good team but needed to be in college before they could sign him. He’d been offered a full athletic scholarship to a really great school in Boston, which would mean that he would have to move away when school finished in a few months. The time apart was going to kill me. I was going to have nightmares every night when he wasn’t there, not to mention the heartache I’d feel watching him leave. I hated the fact that he’d be so far away and that girls would be falling all over him. I sighed, refusing to think about it. I needed to trust him. And I did, I trusted him completely, I believed that he loved me and that he didn’t want to hurt me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-30.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: \n Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
