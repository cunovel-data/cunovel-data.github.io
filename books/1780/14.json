Liam borrowed it when he stayed here, so it must smell like him,” I lied, stumbling over my words.\\n\\n She buried her head in the pillow. “Mmm, I’m sleeping with this one tonight,” she stated, holding the pillow tight.\\n\\n I choked on my laughter. “Whatever, Kate. Let’s go eat I’m starved.” I pushed myself up off of the bed and walked towards the door so we could get the food ordered.\\n\\n “I got this!” she chirped, waving a DVD in front of my face. Even the cover scared the heck out of me. I rolled my eyes and stalked out of the room plopping down onto the sofa next to Liam. He put his hand down onto the sofa next to mine and discreetly rubbed his little finger across mine when no one was looking.\\n\\n “Have you ordered the food, Jake?” I asked, shifting sideways on the seat so that my knee touched Liam’s thigh. I saw a smile play at the corner of his mouth.\\n\\n “Yep, done. It’ll be here in ten,” Jake said, shifting up the other sofa a few inches because Kate had practically sat herself on his lap.\\n\\n “So, Liam, will your fine ass be staying here tonight too? I’m more than happy to share my bed if you want. I may be scared from the movie, maybe I’ll need someone to make me feel better in the night,” Kate purred seductively.\\n\\n I felt him shift his weight closer to me so my leg was on top of his more. “Nope, I can’t. I\u0027m busy tonight. You’ll just have to manage without me.” He shrugged and looked away to the TV.\\n\\n “Oh well. It’ll have to just be you then Jake, if you’re interested,” she purred.\\n\\n I didn’t hear his reply; my ears had started to ring. I actually started to feel jealous. It was the first time I had ever felt anything like that before, I wanted to stand up and shout at my best friend to leave Liam alone. I burst out laughing and then bit my lip to stop.\\n\\n Everyone looked at me like I was crazy. “What?” Jake asked confused.\\n\\n I shook my head, smiling. “Nothing, I just thought of a funny joke that’s all,” I lied getting up. “Anyone want a drink?” I offered, needing to change the subject. They all said yes so I made my way to the fridge grabbing four cans of Pepsi. As I shut the fridge door, Liam grabbed me from behind and made me turn around to look at him. He was standing so close I could feel his breath blow across my face.\\n\\n “I’m missing you already,” he whispered, kissing me lightly. I threw my arms around his neck and pulled him to me, deepening the kiss, tangling my hands in his hair. He stepped forwards making me move back, so my back was against the fridge as he pressed his body against mine. “I think we should just talk to your brother now,” he murmured as he pulled away a couple of minutes later.\\n\\n I shook my head, looking at him pleadingly. “No, just a couple of weeks that’s all I ask.”\\n\\n He smiled a small smile. “OK, whatever you want. But can you stop your friend flirting with me? Tell her I’m taken.”\\n\\n My breath caught in my throat at his words. “Are you taken?” I whispered shyly.\\n\\n He kissed me again, making my body tingle and yearn for more. “I’m definitely taken, if you’ll have me,” he replied, looking me straight in the eye. My insides were jumping for joy, my heart beating so fast that I could almost hear it in my ears, but my head was still telling me to be careful.\\n\\n “I’ll have you, if you’ll have me,” I bargained.\\n\\n He gave me a wicked grin. “Absolutely. Whenever you’re ready, I’ll have you all the time,” he said suggestively, waggling his eyebrows at me. I gasped and slapped his shoulder, making him chuckle. “Oh come on, I’m allowed to make slutty comments to you now, surely? I mean, you’re my girlfriend so I have to use all my best moves on you,” he said, faking hurt.\\n\\n Did he just call me his girlfriend? My heart melted at the sound of that word coming out of his mouth. “Say that again,” I whispered, pulling him closer to me.\\n\\n “I’m allowed to make slutty comments to you?” he asked, looking a little confused.\\n\\n I shook my head. “No, not that. The next bit,” I murmured, putting my mouth inches from his.\\n\\n “You’re my girlfriend?” he asked. I nodded, my breath coming in small gasps, the sound of it made me feel like I was flying, I honestly can’t remember the last time I was this happy. He smiled. “You’re my girlfriend, Angel,” he purred seductively, kissing my lips lightly. “My girl.” He kissed me again. “The only one I want.” He kissed me again, this time I didn’t let him pull back, I held his head to mine and kissed him passionately, making him moan slightly and grip me tighter to him. Suddenly, he jumped away from me and moved to the side. I looked at him confused, had I done something wrong?\\n\\n Just then Jake came round the corner, giving me a stern expression. “You need to have a word with your friend, seriously, she just grabbed my dick!” he whisper yelled at me. Liam and I burst out laughing at the same time. The doorbell rang and I ran to get it, needing to be out of the room, I didn’t really like being around the two of them together, it was kind of awkward.\\n\\n After the food, Kate put on the stupid scary movie. I sat next to Liam. Which meant that Jake had to sit next to Kate on the other sofa - much to his obvious annoyance. The movie was awful; Liam slung his arm casually over the back of the sofa and was playing with my hair discreetly which made it slightly more bearable. About half way through I was honestly so scared that I scooted right up next to Liam and buried my face in his chest. I could feel Jake shooting daggers over at us but I couldn’t help it.\\n\\n By the time it got to the end, I was almost on his lap, much to his enjoyment. I could see the bulge forming in his jeans even though he put his arm over it to cover it quickly. I blushed slightly, knowing that I had caused that, because he was attracted to me and I was jumping all over him. My mind flashed to all the times that he’d been aroused near me before, in bed or dancing, and I wondered how many of them were caused by attraction as well. I bit my lip; maybe I’d ask him another time.\\n\\n Finally, the stupid ass zombie movie was over and I breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n “That was awesome,” Kate chirped, grinning.\\n\\n “Yep, best movie I’ve seen in ages,” Liam agreed with a smirk, I knew he meant because I was sitting on him.\\n\\n “I hated it! How can you say that was good? I mean, jeez, they’re dead people who eat live people and turn them into flesh eating zombies too. And now I have to pee, and I’m scared to go on my own!” I whined, standing up and pouting. Why did I watch that stupid thing anyway? I knew it would scare me!\\n\\n All three of them laughed at me, but Liam stood up. “I’ll come with you and check the bathroom for scary un-dead before you go in, how’s that?” he offered, nodding his head towards the bathroom in the hall, smiling.\\n\\n “Will you check my bedroom too? And my en-suite?” I asked hopefully. He laughed; he obviously thought I was joking. “I’m not joking, Liam.”\\n\\n “Whatever you want, Angel,” he agreed, smiling and following me up the hall. I stopped outside the bathroom door and waited for him to go in first. He came out a minute later, chuckling to himself. “It’s a zombie free zone,” he said shaking his head, grinning at me.\\n\\n “Thanks,” I mumbled, blushing and feeling like a little kid. I headed into the bathroom, leaving the door unlocked in case I needed to get out of there quickly. I knew I was being stupid but I just couldn\u0027t help myself. I washed my hands and stepped out, to see him leaning against the wall waiting for me, which made me smile.\\n\\n “I thought I’d better wait for you. You never know what could be lurking in a dark hallway,” he said, looking around slowly with wide eyes. My heart jumped into my throat as I threw myself at him, wrapping my arms around his waist tightly, burying my face into the side of his neck. He laughed. “Yep, best movie ever!” he stated, putting his arms around me and walking down the hall to the lounge. Before we turned the corner he pulled away and kissed me lightly on the lips.\\n\\n Jake laughed as we walked into the lounge. “Seriously? You made him wait for you outside the door? That’s low, Ambs. I hope you at least shut the door this time,” he teased as I sat back down.\\n\\n I nodded. “Yep I shut the door, didn’t think he’d want to hear that,” I confirmed, grinning. “How about we play on the Wii?” I suggested, trying to change the subject from my zombie phobia. Everyone nodded so Jake set it up. They decided on sports so Liam and Jake played boxing first. Kate moved over to sit next to me; the two boys were standing and playing in front of us.\\n\\n “Hmm, I just can’t decide which one has the cutest butt. Who do you think?” Kate said quietly but loud enough for the guys to hear.\\n\\n “Ew! Seriously, what’s wrong with you? That’s my brother!” I cried, shuddering.\\n\\n “Only one of them is your brother, Amber, the other is seriously freaking hot. And I think he has a soft spot for you,” she whispered too loud again, making me cringe. I saw Jake shoot a death glare at Liam who looked like he was pretending he couldn’t hear her.\\n\\n “Right, yeah OK,” I replied sarcastically, rolling my eyes. “Come on hurry up I want a turn,” I whined, trying to change the subject. Kate really had no idea how close she was.\\n\\n “Here, Angel, you can take my turn. I’d better get going anyway, it’s almost midnight, my parents will be wondering where I am,” Liam said holding the controller out to me. Kate jumped up and grabbed it, smirking and nodding towards my brother, signalling she wanted to play with him.\\n\\n “Liam, would you check my bedroom before you go?” I asked, feeling pathetic and like a scared little kid.\\n\\n He smiled but didn’t laugh at me, which I found surprising. “Oh all right!” He forced a sigh, his eyes amused. By the look of him he actually quite liked the fact that I was asking him to do this, maybe he liked being all protective or something, maybe it was making him feel needed. He stalked off towards my room and I got up and followed him after a couple of seconds. I closed my door silently, and leant against it. I watched him as he actually walked around my room, looking under the bed, and in the closet, before heading into my en-suite. As he walked back into the room, his eyes landed on me, he honestly didn’t know I was there I could tell by his surprised face. Bless him; my boyfriend had actually checked my whole bedroom for zombies. My heart skipped a beat at the thought of him being my boyfriend. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-14.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
