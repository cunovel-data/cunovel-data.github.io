Her hair was half up and curled, and her eyes were sparkling with amusement. I couldn’t breathe. She was so beautiful that it was unreal. All I could do was stare at her like an idiot. Oh crap, I’m staring! OK come on, Liam, say something. Say anything. Liam, freaking say SOMETHING! “Um…. Hi, Angel,” I mumbled, my voice sounding tight. Wow, that was real smooth, Liam! God, I’m such a dick! I was so turned on it must have been obvious to everyone. She grinned, her smile lighting up her whole face. “Hi, Liam,” she purred in her sexy voice. I mentally groaned. OK here it comes; she’s finally going to kill me. I really didn’t think I could take her flirting with me while she looks like that. “You look beautiful,” I said honestly, looking her over again. She grinned and did a little twirl, making the dress rise up a little. My heart started to beat faster. “You like?” she asked biting her lip. Did I like it? Was she kidding me? I nodded and stepped closer. I could smell her perfume making my head slightly fuzzy. “I love,” I confirmed. She giggled and closed the distance, pressing her chest to mine. I couldn’t help but put my hands on her hips, feeling the silky material under my fingers. “You know what? I think you’ll like what’s underneath even more,” she whispered in my ear. I tightened my grip on her as she tried to step back, holding her to me tightly, not wanting to let her move away from me. “Don’t tease me tonight, Angel. Seriously, you look too hot, I can’t take it,” I pleaded. She laughed and gripped the front of my shirt, pulling me impossibly closer to her. I looked into her eyes, feeling myself being drawn in. “I’m not teasing, Liam. By the way, your clothes look so damn hot on you, but I’ve got a feeling they’ll look even better on my bedroom floor later,” she said quietly, making me groan. I closed my eyes. Seriously, she was killing me. She kissed my cheek and pulled away quickly, heading off into the crowd of people, leaving me standing in the middle of the kitchen with a freaking boner as usual. I turned back to Casey who was looking after Amber too. “Damn, she looks hot tonight. I think I might go see if I can tap that fine ass,” he said, waggling his eyebrows as he went to go after her. I grabbed his arm and shook my head, looking at him warningly. “No way, Casey. Just stay away from her, she’s taken.” He looked at me curiously, then his eyes went wide. “She’s not your….” he trailed off, looking at me shocked. Oh crap. Oops, well now he knows! I nodded slowly. “Yeah,” I confirmed. I couldn’t help the proud grin that stretched across my face that someone finally knew about us. He burst out laughing, shaking his head. “Jake is gonna have your balls when he finds out. Seriously, he’s going to tear you a new asshole.” I grinned and slapped his shoulder. “He already knows.” I shrugged easily, smiling as his face turned to shock. “No way! Did he beat the crap out of you?” he asked curiously. I laughed and gestured down at myself. “Does it look like he beat the crap out of me?” I asked, chuckling. He suddenly looked pissed off. “All that freaking time I never asked her out because I thought Jake would cut my balls off, and he didn’t do anything? Damn it, I knew I should have asked her out!” he grumbled, looking annoyed. “Too late now,” I teased, slapping his shoulder again as I went to get a drink. I grabbed two shots of vodka and went to go and find her and tell her that Casey knew. I didn’t bother telling him not to say anything; I wanted this out in the open. I couldn’t care less about the money. In a couple of years, when I was playing hockey professionally, that would seem like peanuts and I could give her anything she wanted. I spotted her dancing with Kate and Sean off to one side. I grinned as I wrapped my arm around her waist, making her jump. “Hey, girlfriend,” I whispered in her ear. She smiled at me over her shoulder as she ground her ass across my crotch, making me yearn for her again. I pulled her tighter against me and danced behind her, I handed her one of the shots. “Thanks.” She smiled gratefully as she downed it, wincing slightly. “So, I’ve got something to tell you,” I admitted sheepishly. She turned to face me. “What’s that then?” she asked, grinning. Her excited expression told me that she obviously thought it was something good. “Casey knows you’re my girl,” I said quietly, bending close to her so no one could hear. She gasped. “He does? How?” she asked, clearly shocked, as she looked around suspiciously. “I told him by accident. He was going to come and make a move on you, I told him to stay away,” I admitted, smiling apologetically, hoping she wouldn’t chew me out for ruining her plan with Jessica and the bet. She rolled her eyes and stepped closer to me. “Big mouth,” she scolded jokingly, as she wrapped her arms around my neck, dancing with me again. I pulled her closer to me wrapping her in my arms tightly, loving the feel of her body against mine. She smiled happily. “Well then, Liam, if people are going to find out, we might as well give them a show,” she flirted, raising one eyebrow playfully. What the hell does that mean? She giggled and pulled my face down to hers, kissing me, hard. I heard people gasp and start talking hurriedly around us, but I didn’t care. I was kissing the girl of my dreams and she loved me. I pulled her closer, tracing my tongue on her lip, wanting more. After a minute or so I pulled out of the kiss and started kissing down her neck, making her moan quietly. I smiled against her neck because I knew that people were watching. Finally, no more pretending, no more listening to the guys talk about her and wanting to beat the crap out of them. I pulled back to look at her, she was grinning at me, looking so freaking hot it was unbelievable. “I love you, Liam,” she said, her eyes locked on mine. I heard some other people gasp again. “I love you too, Angel,” I replied, immediately. I knew people were talking about us, and literally the whole room was staring, but I just didn’t care. All I could focus on were her beautiful eyes and how they were looking deeply into mine, driving me crazy. I pulled my arms tighter around her, not wanting the moment to end. I loved the way her incredible body was swaying against mine, turning me on so badly that it was almost unbearable. We danced for about an hour. Now that people knew about us, I didn’t leave her side, wanting more time with her. I never got to spend time with her at parties; usually, I was either too busy making sure nothing happened to their house because Jake was always off of his face, or hooking up with a girl out the back. Tonight was the best party ever, just because I got to hold her hand and kiss her. Even the girls didn’t hit on me, which made a nice change. I hung out with her and her friends. Kate was actually really funny, I’d not really spoken to her properly before. Usually, the only time she spoke to me was to flirt with me, so it was weird to have a normal conversation with her. Just after midnight, Amber pressed herself to me tightly. “I’m tired, Liam. Want to take me to bed?” she asked, raising her eyebrows teasingly. Oh crap, I thought all the flirting and teasing would stop now that people knew! I laughed and rolled my eyes. “Sure, Angel.” I would love to wrap my arms around her sexy body right now. She grinned and turned to walk off; I put my hands on her h*ps following her through the throng of people, to her bedroom. As soon as we were through the door she turned to me with her face playful and I knew that the teasing wasn’t over with yet. I groaned quietly. Jeez, I loved this girl more than anything, but she was driving me crazy! She locked the door and stepped up close to me, pressing her toned body to mine. Her hands ran down my chest, slowly, making me so freaking hard it was embarrassing. Surely I should be immune to her charm by now? I mean, I’d been in love with this girl for twelve years, how the hell could she still turn me on like this? No one ever compared to my Angel, she literally was the world’s most perfect girl. I bent my head down to kiss her, tracing my tongue along her soft full lip, wanting to deepen the kiss. She tangled her hands in my hair and I couldn’t help but pin her against the wall, pressing every inch of my body against hers. She moaned in the back of her throat and I felt happiness bubble up inside that she loved kissing me as much as I loved kissing her. I bent my knees and wrapped her tighter in my arms as I stood up, lifting her off of her feet. She wrapped her long legs around me as she unbuttoned my shirt slowly; her fingers lingering over my skin, making me get goose bumps. Every single touch from Amber was like nothing I’d ever felt before. All those girls I had slept with just to try and forget her, were nothing compared to her. I wished with all my heart that I had waited and that she would be my first, but everything felt like a first time with her anyway. Every touch was ten times better than anything I’d ever felt before, it was like every place her skin touched mine, felt like she burnt me slightly, but in a nice way. She made me so nervous too. I didn’t want to do anything she didn’t want, but I was also so scared that I wouldn’t be able to please her and I didn’t want to ruin anything. I pulled out of the kiss, peppering little kisses down her neck, sucking on the hickey I’d given her a few days ago to make it darker. I loved that mark on her. Knowing that she was mine made me crazy. I walked over to the bed, laying her down and climbing on top of her as I ran my hands down her body. When I got to the bottom of her dress, I slipped my hand under, tracing it back up her toned thigh, making my way higher so I could grip her ass. I couldn’t help but moan at the feel of it. Knowing that I was the only one that she would let near her like this, made me feel like the luckiest guy in the world. She pushed my shirt off of my shoulders and ran her hands back down my chest. When she got to my jeans she immediately started unbuttoning them too. I stiffened slightly. What the hell is she doing? She rolled me onto my back and sat up, straddling me, looking so sexy it was unreal. She chewed on her lip, looking a little nervous about something.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-33.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
