I hated seeing you and not being able to touch you. Also, what the hell was that at lunchtime? Do you enjoy teasing the crap out of me?” he asked, frowning.\n I ran my hands through his silky brown hair and giggled guiltily. “I have to set the scene for my victory. I can’t just rock up to Jessica and be all like ‘yeah, I won the bet’, can I?” I asked innocently.\n He shook his head, still frowning. “But that was over the top. I mean, do you know how hard that was for me not to jump you?” he joked.\n I nodded and bit my lip so I didn’t laugh. “Oh yeah, I could tell that was hard for you,” I teased, raising my eyebrows knowingly, making him chuckle.\n “Mmm, whatever. Where did you go anyway? I was hoping to spend some time with you tonight.” He pulled me closer to him and kissed down my neck, making me bite into my lip as my skin broke out in goosebumps.\n I pulled away and stood up, walking over to my school bag to get the brown bag from the clinic. I sat back on his lap and held the bag out for him to take. He looked at me, confused, and then looked in the bag. His face turned from confusion, to understanding, to happiness, to being annoyed. Wait, annoyed? Why on earth would he be annoyed with me?\n “You went to do this on your own?” he asked, frowning at me angrily.\n I shook my head, a little confused by his reaction. “I didn’t go on my own, Kate came with me,” I amended, wrapping my arms around his neck again.\n “Why didn’t you tell me? I would’ve come with you,” he said, pulling me closer to him, the annoyed expression still on his face.\n “Liam, I just thought that, you know….. it’s not really a place where you take your boyfriend. I wanted to go on the pill; Kate offered to come with me.” I shrugged; I didn’t really see why he was so angry about it.\n “Angel, I love you, I would’ve come with you. I wish you would’ve told me,” he said, looking at me sadly.\n “What difference does it make? I didn’t think you’d want to go,” I muttered, confused. Why the heck is he being all hurt and annoyed? I just went on the pill so I could have sex with him! Shouldn’t he be happy about that fact?\n “You didn’t think that I’d want to go? Angel, this is about me too, I want us to do things together. We’re a couple, a team. I feel a little hurt that you’d think I wouldn’t want to go,” he explained, kissing my forehead.\n “Liam, I’m sorry, honestly. I didn’t really think about it like that. I just thought that most guys wouldn’t be interested. I thought you’d be pleased that I took some initiative,” I said, looking at him apologetically, begging him with my eyes to understand that I didn’t mean to hurt him.\n “I am pleased that you took the initiative, but I’m not most guys. I love you. Most guys aren’t in love with their girlfriends like I am. This was a big thing for you to do, and I should have been there for you,” he explained, kissing me tenderly.\n I took in a deep breath feeling guilt settle in the pit of my stomach. I didn’t think about it like that. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you or ask you to come with me. I have to go back in three months for a check-up, want to come with me then?” I asked, smiling and putting my forehead to his.\n He laughed. “Nah, it’s not really my thing,” he teased, turning his nose up and shrugging.\n I laughed and slapped him playfully on the shoulder. “Asshole,” I muttered jokingly, making him laugh harder. I pushed him down onto the sofa and laid on top of him, kissing him. By the time I pulled away, we were both breathing heavy. He was staring at me lustfully and I could feel he was aroused already. “Liam, just because I’m going on the pill, doesn’t mean that I’m ready for anything more. You know that, right?” I asked, grimacing, hoping I hadn’t got his hopes up and now he was going to be expecting sex.\n He smiled and tucked my hair behind my ear. “Angel, I know that. It’s fine. We’ll go as slow as you want. As long as I still get to do this.” He pulled my face back down to his again. I smiled against his lips and felt happier than I had been in years, he was just too sweet. I just prayed I would be ready soon, before he got bored or desperate and went chasing after that skank Jessica.\n After making out and cuddling for about an hour we heard a car pull up. “Damn it, that must be Jake’s ride,” I whispered, trying to push myself away from Liam. I sat up, smoothing down my hair, hoping that it didn’t look like we’d been fooling around for the last hour.\n Liam laughed and pulled me back down on the couch with him. “Jake can handle this. Come on, he has to get used to it eventually. He’s going to see us kiss from time to time,” he said, chuckling against my neck. I smiled as I weaved my fingers into his hair, I heard the front door open and Liam snapped his head up to look, a small smile playing on the edge of his lips. I actually think he was enjoying teasing Jake.\n “Oh come on, guys! Seriously, what did I say this morning about PDA’s?” Jake whined, slinging his keys on the table.\n Liam groaned and rolled his eyes as he sat up, pulling me up to sit next to him. “Better?” he asked, grinning wickedly.\n Jake sighed and rolled his eyes too. “I’ll get used to it, I guess,” he grumbled. Liam grinned at me and I couldn’t help but smile back. He threw his arm over my shoulder and held my hand with his other arm, playing with my fingers.\n Jake came in and plopped down on the sofa opposite, looking at us grumpily. I laughed at his disgruntled expression and stood up. “I’m going to go do my homework. You boys can entertain yourselves for a while, right?” I smirked at them both in turn. I had a feeling that they needed a little ‘boy bonding time’ after the revelations last night. Jake and Liam were best friends after all.\n “Yeah. Want to play Halo, Jake?” Liam asked excitedly. Jake jumped up to set it up and I smiled to myself happily. Yep, they were back to normal. I grabbed the brown bag and made my way to my bedroom, giggling as Liam slapped my ass and whistled at me. I’d already done my homework, so I decided that a nice long soak in the bath would be good. I ran a bath and added a lot of bubbles, before grabbing a book and settling into the tub. I lost myself in the story.\n I was so engrossed in the story that I didn’t hear the door open. “Now that’s sexy,” Liam purred from right next to me.\n I screamed and almost dropped my book in the water. “Shit! You scared the crap out of me, Liam!” I cried, trying to slow my heart that was trying to break my ribs. I brought my knees up to my chest and tried to cover myself up so he couldn’t see anything inappropriate. Lucky for me, there were still quite a few bubbles which helped.\n He laughed. “Sorry. Hey, can I get in?” he teased as he knelt down next to me and put his fingers in the bath. He pulled them out quickly and shook his head. “Never mind. That\u0027s freaking freezing!” He frowned and dried his hand on the towel.\n “Liam, will you get out of here? This isn’t funny!” I cried, blushing.\n He grinned his cocky little smile and bent over to kiss my lips just for a split second before he turned and walked back for the door. “I was kidding. I didn’t actually realise you were in here. You should get out though, that water is really cold. Have you been in there all this time?” he asked, shaking his head.\n “It is a bit cold,” I admitted. Now that I was out of the story I didn’t even realise that the bath was stone cold and I had goosebumps all over me. Liam smiled and turned to go back to my bedroom, closing the door to give me some privacy. I pulled the plug out and threw my book onto the side as I stood up. Grabbing the towel off of the side and wrapped it around myself tightly. I realised as I climbed out of the tub that I didn’t bring any clothes in here to change into. I was actually really cold now and my teeth were chattering. I couldn’t stay in here all night, I’d just have to go and get some pyjamas. It was no big deal; Liam had seen me in a towel before.\n As I walked into my bedroom I noticed that he was lounging on my bed. “Hey,” I muttered, feeling a little uncomfortable as I pulled on a pair of shorts under the towel.\n “Jeez, Angel, you could have got hypothermia or something,” he scolded, looking at me worriedly. He grabbed my hand and pulled me to the bed, sitting me on the edge as he went into the bathroom, coming back with another towel. He rubbed my arms and shoulders, drying me quickly.\n I was glad I decided not to wash my hair, instead, putting it in a messy bun, otherwise that would have made me even colder. He wrapped his arm around me, putting each of my prune like finger tips into his mouth, warming them one at a time. Oh my God, that’s sexy! I bent my head and kissed him, seeming to catch him by surprise. After a second or two he responded, kissing me back. I sucked on his lip softly and he opened his mouth, allowing me to slip my tongue in. He moaned in the back of his throat and I wrapped my arms around his neck, gripping his hair roughly, tugging slightly. He pulled me closer to him, deepening the kiss. After what seemed like forever, but still wasn’t long enough, he pulled away breathing heavy. His lips didn’t leave my skin though, instead, he kissed down my neck, sucking on the skin near my collarbone, making me gasp and squirm.\n I was still freezing cold and my teeth started to chatter again, ruining the moment. He pulled back, laughing. “Let’s get you under the covers and you can get warm.” He pulled off his t-shirt in one easy movement and I couldn’t help but stare at his sculpted chest. I felt movement and my vision went black for a few seconds, interrupting my ogling. I smiled as I realised he’d pulled his t-shirt over my head.\n “Liam, if you wanted to make me hot, all you need to do is take your clothes off,” I purred, biting my lip and looking over his chest and abs, wanting to run my tongue over them. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-28.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: \n Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
