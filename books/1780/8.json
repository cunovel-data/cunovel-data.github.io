I felt someone grab my hand and looked back to see Liam giving me a smile, one of the real ones, and I couldn’t help but smile back. “Dance with me, Angel,” he said, wrapping his arms around my waist.\n I was so drunk at this point that I didn’t even care that I was dancing with Liam; I wrapped my arms around him and tucked my face into his neck. He smelled amazing and I wondered what he would taste like if I licked him. Wait, did I just think about licking Liam like he was a Popsicle or something? I burst out laughing at my own idiocy. Liam pulled back and gave me a ‘what the heck’ face, which just made it funnier. He rolled his eyes and shook his head, looking amused, as he pressed his body back to mine. The song wasn’t really a slow song so we were swaying quite fast and half grinding against each other. I loved dancing, and he was really good at it, our bodies seemed to fit together perfectly.\n I could feel him getting aroused but this didn’t bother me. Liam has been pressing his erections on me since I was twelve and he was fourteen. He wakes up with one every day, and most of the time falls asleep with one too. I just ignore it. It was weird the first time it happened and really freaked me out. He had gone home that morning, so embarrassed that he’d almost cried, he’d spoken to his dad about it and then came back the next night and explained that it was normal for boys to have it happen because he was growing and it was all to do with hormones. I didn’t know whether it was true or not, but I didn’t have any reason to doubt him. It was embarrassing for us both for a month or so, then it was a joke for a while, now we just ignore it completely. He pulled back to look at me and gave me one of his nice smiles and my mouth pulled up into a smile in return. He actually looked really cute when he smiled like that, funny how I’d only just noticed and I’d known him forever.\n Jake came out of nowhere. “Dude, what the fuck? That’s my little sister!” he shouted at Liam, grabbing his shoulder and jerking him away from me.\n “Jake man, seriously I was just dancing with her, that’s her song!” Liam cried, looking really annoyed.\n “Liam, you need to stay away from my sister, she’s sixteen for f**k sake. You know what she’s been through. She doesn’t need guys like you chasing her around!” Jake shouted back, stepping forwards and getting in Liam’s face. I could tell he was drunk by the slight touch of red to his ears, they were always the giveaway.\n “I would never hurt her!” Liam growled, their chests almost touching.\n “I don’t give a shit! I said stay away!” Jake shouted.\n I just shrugged and left them to it, I don’t need to witness their fight, they’ll be making up in a couple of minutes anyway, they always do. As I rounded the corner to the kitchen, I walked smack into a guy I didn’t know. He was maybe a little older than me, probably Jake’s age, he was really cute. He had black hair that was quite shaggy; it flicked across his forehead, and almost covered one of his brown eyes. He smiled and grabbed my waist steadying me as I swayed. I immediately flinched because he was touching me, but not too bad because the drink had numbed some of my brain.\n “Well hello,” he purred with his sexy voice.\n “Hi.” I smiled; he hadn’t taken his hands from my waist so I took a step back to get some personal space.\n “I’m Trent.” He grinned; I noticed that when he smiled he had really cute little dimples.\n “Amber,” I replied, not looking away from his face, he really was handsome. I didn’t recognise him from school. “You go to Penn State?” I asked, curious as to why I didn’t know him if he was at the party.\n He shook his head and smiled. “No. I’m actually just here to pick up my little sister, but I can’t find her.”\n “Oh yeah? Who’s your sister?” I asked frowning; someone has got one hot ass brother I can tell you!\n “Jessica Sanders,” he stated. I couldn’t help my body’s natural reaction; I turned my nose up a little, which made him laugh. “Not a big fan, huh?” he asked, still chuckling.\n “Oh…. er…. sorry,” I mumbled, looking at him apologetically and blushing like crazy. I can’t believe I just made that face at his sister! What an idiot!\n “Don’t worry about it; I know she can be a pain in the ass.”\n “So, do you want me to help you find her?” I offered, looking round the kitchen for her. Nope, not in here. I giggled as I remembered that he’d just walked out of that room, so of course she wasn’t there!\n “Nah, she’ll turn up. How about we get a drink instead?” he suggested, nodding towards the drinks counter.\n “Yeah OK, sure.” I smiled as he grabbed two cups and a bottle of Jack Daniels.\n We did a couple of shots of it and I was really trashed now. I leant against him heavily as we chatted and laughed about random stuff that didn’t even really seem to make sense to me. Suddenly, he pushed me against the kitchen counter and pressed his body against mine. The familiar panic was starting to rise as my heart increased, he was inching his head forward towards mine. I felt my mouth go dry. Holy crap, he was going to kiss me! Did I want that? What if he puts his hands on me or something? My mind was spinning through the thoughts so fast that I couldn’t even keep up with them all.\n I gasped and pulled my head back, banging it on the cupboard behind me, hard enough to make my eyes water. He shook his head, looking at me a little bewildered and then crashed his lips to mine. I whimpered and pushed on his chest, trying to get him off, his hands went to the back of my neck holding me still and I felt him lick along my bottom lip. I clamped my mouth shut and pushed him as hard as I could, but he didn’t budge. I started to freak out; I could literally feel the panic attack taking over as my heartbeat crashed in my ears.\n The next thing I know, he was gone. I looked up, puzzled, to see Liam pinning him against the wall, his arm across the guys throat. He looked so angry that I actually started to feel sorry for the guy, who was now starting to turn a little red from not being able to breathe.\n “You don’t f**king touch her! What, you think you can just waltz in here and kiss her even though she plainly didn’t want it?” Liam growled angrily.\n I started to feel sick, literally, stared to feel sick. I jumped off the counter and staggered for my en-suite, where I threw up what felt like several liters of vodka. I groaned and flushed and moved back to sit down when I leant against someone’s legs. I didn’t freak out though, I could smell his aftershave, I knew it was Liam.\n “You alright?” he asked, his voice sympathetic. But I couldn’t answer; I just leant over the toilet and threw up another bottle of vodka. Wow, that’s a waste of money! Liam, bless him, was rubbing my back in small circles and holding my hair up for me. After a few minutes I felt a lot better. “You want to go to bed?” he asked, looking at me concerned.\n I nodded. “Yeah, I just want to brush my teeth.” I struggled to get up off of the bathroom floor, but I was so uncoordinated that it didn’t work out too well. Liam smiled and bent down, slipping his arms under me and picking me up easily as if I weighed nothing at all. He sat me on the unit next to the sink, grabbed my toothbrush and put on the toothpaste for me. I smiled weakly and brushed my teeth, making sure all of the alcohol taste was gone.\n “Bed?” he asked, when I was done. I nodded and he picked me up bridal style and carried me back to my bedroom. He had pulled back the covers and was just about to put me in when I remembered I was still in my party clothes.\n “Wait! I don’t want to go to bed like this,” I mumbled, looking down at my shorts and tank top, I still had my jewellery and shoes on too.\n He nodded and set me down on my feet, but I could barely stand and I felt myself sway as my legs threatened to give out on me. Liam wrapped one arm around my waist, holding me up, and pulled my necklaces off. I got hold of the bottom of my top and pulled it over my head, getting tangled in the process and starting to laugh. I heard him sigh as he pushed me to make me sit on the bed and pulled my top off for me. When I looked up at him I saw he had an amused expression on his face. I laid back on the bed and unbuttoned my shorts, raising my h*ps as I pulled them down over my ass; he grabbed them and pulled them down slowly so I was laying there in my bra and thong. He held my legs up in the air as he took my sandals off one at a time.\n “Nice,” he purred, looking me over with his trademark smirk, but I didn’t care, I just laid there, giggling, until my stomach lurched again.\n “Oh no!” I gasped, trying to sit up, clamping a hand over my mouth. Quick as lightening, he picked me up again and carried me back to the bathroom, holding my hair again and rubbing my back while I emptied my stomach.\n After I had brushed my teeth again, he slipped off his t-shirt and pulled it over my head. “There’s another one to add to your t-shirt collection,” he said with an easy smile, as he picked me up and carried me into my bed. He walked off towards the door. I thought he was going to leave and go back to the party, but he didn’t, he just locked the door and slipped off his jeans, climbing into the bed next to me. I could still hear the party going on outside. Liam wrapped his arms around me and pulled me into his chest. I couldn’t stop thinking about the guy kissing me in the kitchen. Before I knew what had happened, I’d started to cry.\n “What’s wrong, Angel?” he asked, looking at me concerned.\n “That as**ole stole my first kiss!” I wailed. Liam burst out laughing and I felt even worse because of it. I can’t believe he’s laughing at me! “It’s not funny, Liam! A girl’s first kiss is important to her. Just because you’re some kind of super slut who doesn’t care, and probably doesn’t remember his first kiss, doesn’t mean that the little things aren’t important!” I said angrily, slapping on his chest.\n “Angel, calm down. He didn’t steal your first kiss,” he said sternly, looking right into my eyes making me feel weightless with his stupid bottomless, blue, man-whore eyes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-8.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: \n Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
