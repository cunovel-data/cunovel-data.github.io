You were wearing a dark blue dress with a bow on the back, and little white socks. The first time I saw you I was trapped. This,” he drew a little pattern on my stomach with one finger, \"this is a bonus. Sure, I wasn’t expecting it for about five or six years, but still…. it’s a bonus,” he said, grinning.\n Could we really do that? He would stay here with me? “Would you really stay with me here and give up your scholarship?” I asked a little shocked. He worked so damn hard for that scholarship, it was such an awesome opportunity, and he would give it up for me and a baby?\n He smiled. “Angel, if you want to get rid of the baby because you don’t want it, then I could understand, but don’t do this for me. I want to stay here with you. If you weren’t pregnant I’d still be turning down the offer,” he vowed, scooting closer to me on the bed, wrapping his arms around me.\n I buried my face into his chest and closed my eyes; I wanted to have kids with him one day too. I could see myself holding a little baby that had Liam’s blue eyes and messy hair. Granted, when I pictured it I was a lot older than I am now, but I could still see it, and I liked it. Maybe we could make this work. The baby wouldn’t be short on love, and once people got over the shock of it, they’d understand. I had no doubt in my mind that Liam’s mom would help out too. And Jake, once he got over the initial anger of everything, he’d be a great Uncle.\n Liam pulled away from me slightly. “I swear I’d be the best dad in the world,” he promised.\n I smiled; I didn’t doubt that for a second. I kissed his lips, wrapping my arms around his neck, pulling him closer. I loved him so much, more than anything. I knew we could make it work, a little family. He pulled out of the kiss to look at me with a hopeful expression on his face.\n “OK,” I agreed.\n He grinned and kissed me again, moving so he was half on top of me. I noticed he put none of his weight on my stomach, he was being super gentle. He kissed down my neck, getting lower and lower. He hitched my top and kissed all over my stomach before pulling up to smile at me.\n “I love you,” he whispered.\n I pulled him closer to me. “I love you too, baby daddy,” I teased, making him laugh.\n He wrapped his arms around me, laying close to my side. I rested my head on his chest and listened to his heart beat flying as I slipped one hand down my body, resting it on my tummy, rubbing my fingertips over it lightly.\n I kissed Liam’s chest. How the hell could such an adorable, gorgeous, sweet, kind, funny, talented and responsible boy, want me? How could he love me as much as I can see he does? I couldn’t help but smile. Laying in Liam’s arms, I actually felt like the luckiest girl in the world. I got to have a baby with the man I love.\n After a couple of hours I was discharged. Apparently, Liam was to wake me up every hour to make sure I didn’t have concussion or anything. We’d agreed not to tell anyone about the baby yet. It was so early and we were only just getting our heads around it - we didn’t need any interference from anyone else.\n “Shall we call a cab or something?” I asked as Liam walked me out of the hospital, holding me tightly to his side.\n He grinned. He’d been doing that a lot for the last couple of hours; I actually think he was really excited about being a dad which I had never seen on an eighteen year old before.\n “No. Jake left us his car. He went home with Johnny and gave me his keys,” he explained, guiding me to the parking lot. He helped me into the car, even putting on my seatbelt for me. His hand lingered over my stomach as he pulled it away.\n My head was pounding; the painkillers they gave me were starting to wear off. I rested my head back against the headrest and closed my eyes. It was going to be hard lying to Jake. I hated lying and was actually really terrible at it, but it needed to be done for a few weeks. We just needed to let the whole abusive father thing settle down first, that would give us a chance to sort out everything in our own heads. I still had the money from the bet, I hadn’t spent any of it yet so that would help with all of the things we needed to buy for having a baby.\n When we pulled up at my house, I didn’t even get out of the car before Jake attacked me into a hug. “Shit, you scared the hell out of everyone, Amber!” he scolded.\n I smiled and hugged him back. “Sorry, Jake. I didn’t exactly plan to pass out in front of everyone and bang my head, did I?” I replied sarcastically as I rolled my eyes. Why the hell is he mad at me for getting sick?\n He sighed and pulled back. “So, what did they say? Why did you pass out in the first place?” he asked, looking concerned.\n Oh crap, what do I say?\n “Stress apparently. That, and she hadn’t eaten all day,” Liam interjected, coming round to my side. I silently thanked God that Liam was better liar than I was.\n Jake looked at me, clearly annoyed again. “Why the hell didn’t you eat all day?” he asked accusingly.\n I smiled and let Liam lead me in to the house. “Let’s just get her in and let her sit down, Jake, then you can shout at her all you like,” Liam suggested, shaking his head with a small smile.\n Jake followed us in and sat next to me on the sofa, Johnny and Ruby came and sat down too. Everyone was looking at me worriedly. “Stop worrying, guys. It was lack of food, apparently. Sugar low or something. I’m fine now, honestly,” I assured them, nodding, trying not to look too guilty. I just hoped that Jake didn’t go too crazy when he found out, and that he didn’t beat the crap out of Liam or something. Maybe I would tell him on my own, calm him down a little before he saw Liam.\n “The bang to her head needed stitches. I need to wake her up every hour to make sure she’s OK, so I’ll be staying over tonight,” Liam stated, more for Ruby’s benefit than anyone else’s, Jake already knew he’d be there anyway.\n I yawned. It was almost nine now and I just wanted to go to bed, it had been a long stressful day. “I’m going to bed, guys. Oh, and Ruby, it really is nice to meet you again. I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to talk to you properly earlier,” I said, smiling apologetically.\n She chuckled slightly. “We’ll talk tomorrow, honey, don’t worry. If you need anything in the night then let me know. Jake said I could sleep in your mom’s room, just so you know where I am, alright?” she asked kindly.\n Wow, she really is nice!\n “OK. G’night, guys. And you, lover boy, go get your stuff if you’re staying here,” I instructed, smiling at Liam.\n He stood up quickly. “OK. I’ll be back in a bit then.” He kissed my forehead gently before heading for the front door to tell his parents he was ‘officially’ staying over.\n I went to my bedroom and looked at myself in the mirror. My hair was a mess, I had a plaster thing stuck behind my ear over the stitches, I looked tired but I couldn’t help but smile. I didn’t bother with pyjamas as I slipped into the bed; I wanted to feel Liam’s skin against mine. After about fifteen minutes he came in, looking so handsome that it made me want to cry. I rubbed my hand over my stomach lightly under the sheets. I hoped I had a little boy in there, and he would be just like his daddy.\n Liam stripped down to his boxers and climbed in the bed with me. He gasped suddenly and pulled back to look at me. “Are you naked?” he asked, a little shocked.\n I smiled. “Yep. I thought you should make the most of me before I get all fat and ugly,” I teased.\n He grinned and rolled on top of me, hovering above me, barely touching me. “Angel, you will never be ugly,” he whispered, looking at me adoringly. “And the bigger you get, just means I have more of you to love,” he added, slipping his hand down to my stomach. I smiled as I pulled his mouth down to mine.\n Having Johnny, Matt and Ruby stay with us was actually awesome. Ruby made pancakes on Saturday morning, and I spent the day chatting to her and playing with my gorgeous little brother. She was planning on staying in town because Johnny didn’t want to change schools again.\n Kate came over in the afternoon, and Johnny finally asked her to be exclusive - which she obviously jumped at. They were so sweet, being all cuddly and flirty. Kate would say stuff that would make Johnny blush. He was just too innocent - but knowing Kate he wouldn’t be that way for too long if she had her way. Liam kept shooting me little knowing smiles and would touch my belly at every single opportunity.\n On Sunday, Ruby, Johnny, Kate and Matt went to the zoo for the day. They wanted to get out and do something to take Ruby’s mind off of the fact that my father was due home from his business trip today. He would come home to find the note that she left him, and that all of their stuff was gone from his house. She had gotten rid of their phone numbers and bought new sim cards for their cellphones so he had no way of contacting them or knowing where they were. But sitting around worrying about it wasn’t helping anyone, so they wanted to do something to keep them occupied.\n I was sat on the sofa, reading, with my legs on Liam’s lap while he played PlayStation with Jake, when the phone rang. I moved to get it but Jake got there first. As he answered it his whole body tensed up. “What the hell do you want?” he growled, jumping off of the sofa. I sat up so fast that it almost made my head spin. “Are you f**king drunk?” he almost screamed down the phone. I watched him, feeling sick, knowing that my father was on the phone. “Yeah, so what? What are you gonna do about it, old man?” Jake spat, going red with anger. “We don’t want to see you, so f**k off. No. She doesn’t want to see you. I swear, if you come near her again I’ll kill you,” he growled, turning his back to me. “Actually, you know what, screw it, come over, come over right now. We’re home, come on over and let’s talk about it,” Jake suggested.\n What the hell is he doing? “Jake?” I cried, scared.\n “Sure. You remember where the house is, right? Absolutely. See you in a bit,” Jake said, hanging up and throwing the phone across the room. Luckily it landed with a thump on the other sofa and didn’t break. Did he just tell him to come over? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-48.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: \n Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
