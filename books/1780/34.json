She nodded and took hold of the bottom of her dress, pulling it up over her head, shaking her hair after, making it fall loosely around her beautiful face. I looked at her in her strapless black lacy bra and matching thong, and a thousand lustful thoughts were bombarding my brain at once. I wanted her so much it was unreal. This was the furthest we’d gone, I’d seen her with no top on but not almost n**ed like this. She was incredible. She bent down and kissed me passionately, pulling back to look at me, still looking a little nervous but excited at the same time.\\n\\n “Do you want me, Liam?” she asked.\\n\\n Crap, is that some sort of joke or something? “Angel, I’ve wanted you forever.”\\n\\n She smiled making my heart beat faster. “Make love to me,” she whispered, kissing me softly.\\n\\n My heart stopped. Did she just ask me to…. no, no way, she said something else and then you’re going to look like a dick when it turns out you heard her wrong!\\n\\n “What?” I asked weakly, pushing her hair behind her ear.\\n\\n “I’m ready now; I want you to make love to me.” She blushed slightly, looking even more adorable because of how sweet and innocent she was.\\n\\n I rolled her onto her back. Does she think she has to give it up to me? Jeez, does she not believe me when I say I’ll wait for her? “Angel, I’ll wait as long as you want. I promise I can wait,” I vowed, willing her to believe me. I would never ever touch another woman again, they just didn’t interest me, they never did.\\n\\n She laughed. “Well I’m sorry, Liam, but I just can’t wait for you any longer. I need you to be ready now,” she teased, gripping her hand on my ass.\\n\\n I laughed; she was so damn funny. “Oh you can’t wait for me, huh? Well that’s not very fair; you’re kind of putting undue pressure on me to perform,” I joked. My heart was returning to normal rate now that I realised she was only joking. She smiled and ran her hands down my chest again, when she got to my jeans she slipped her hand inside, rubbing me through my boxers. What the hell? Oh crap, is she not joking? “Angel, what are you doing?” I asked breathlessly. Shit, that feels good!\\n\\n “Liam, stop talking,” she whispered, pulling me closer as she pushed my jeans down.\\n\\n OK, I’ll just go with it until she tells me to stop; I knew she felt comfortable enough to ask me to stop, which I loved. I loved that she had faith in me not to rush her or pressure her. I kissed her hungrily, brushing my hands over her bra, loving the feel of the lacy material. I unclasped it, pulling it off, slowly, waiting for her to stop me. I was so nervous that my hands were shaking slightly. Her br**sts were perfect. I bent my head kissing all over them, making her arch her back and moan breathlessly. OK, so this is a first, not been this far with her before! I kicked my jeans off that were now almost to my knees and ran my hands down her body, stopping as I got to her panties, my hand brushing over them gently, which made her raise her h*ps trying to get more. I smiled slightly as I rubbed her through her panties, making her moan and grip her free hand on my shoulder tightly.\\n\\n Her eyes were locked on mine. “Make love to me, Liam,” she whispered.\\n\\n Shit, she was serious! I stopped and pulled back, not taking my eyes from hers. There was no sign of indecision; she had made up her mind. All I saw on her face was love, happiness and need, and I would bet anything that my face looked exactly the same.\\n\\n “Angel, I can wait,” I promised again.\\n\\n “I know you can, but I’m ready now.” She nodded, looking at me softly.\\n\\n “Shouldn’t your first time be special? In a nice hotel or something, with rose petals and candles all scattered around?” I asked, frowning. I could book one for tomorrow night if she was really ready.\\n\\n She shook her head. “It will be special, Liam. It’ll be our first time. That’s special enough for me. Please?” she begged, running her hand down my back.\\n\\n My whole body was rejoicing at the thought of being with her, but my head knew I had to be sure she wasn’t doing this for the wrong reasons; I’d never forgive myself if she regretted this in the morning. “This isn’t about the bet is it?” I asked curiously.\\n\\n She laughed and shook her head. “I couldn’t care less about the bet. I trust you, I love you, I want you to make love to me.”\\n\\n I felt my heart skip a beat as I got so freaking excited and nervous at the same time that I swear it would kill me. “I love you too, Angel, more than anything.” I bent down to kiss her again softly, knowing I needed to take it slow and gentle, I just prayed to God that it didn’t hurt her too much.\\n\\n I ran my hands down her body, loving the feel of her soft skin under my hands as I kissed her passionately, showing her how much I loved her and wanted her. I hooked my thumbs in her panties, pulling them down slowly, teasing her, getting my own back. She was digging her fingers into my back, her breathing speeding up with excitement, making me even hotter for her. I kissed down her body, running my tongue across her br**sts and down over her stomach, pausing to bite just below her belly button, making her gasp and raise her hips. I sat up and pulled her panties the rest of the way off and just looked at her. She was sheer and utter perfection, laying there n**ed and vulnerable. I knew I would never be able to look at another girl again without comparing her to the sight of my Angel, as she just lay there, blushing. She was obviously embarrassed that I was seeing her n**ed for the first time.\\n\\n “You are so beautiful, Angel,” I whispered. She smiled and gripped her hand around the back of my head, guiding my mouth back to hers. I felt my heart swell as I kissed her passionately, showing her just how much I loved and cherished her before I prepared myself to make love to her for the first time.\\n\\n I smoothed her hair away from her sweaty forehead. She was grinning at me and looked so happy it made my heart skip a beat. “I love you, Angel.” We laid there trying to slow our heart beats. I pressed my face into the crook of her neck kissing her, feeling her rapid pulse under my lips. I felt happier than I had ever felt in my life. After a minute or so, I pulled out of her and rolled to my side. I tightened my arms on her, pulling her close to me, trailing my fingers over her naked, sweaty body, lingering on her breasts. “I’m sorry I hurt you,” I said quietly. I felt awful that I was the one to have to cause her pain, but I guess every girl had to go through that the first time.\\n\\n She laughed. “Liam, that was so totally worth it,” she teased, pressing her body closer to mine, snuggling into my arms.\\n\\n I laughed. “Well I’m glad you enjoyed it,” I stated, smirking at her. I’d never had any complaints before, but I’d never actually cared if the girl enjoyed herself before. Usually, I just did what I wanted; I’d never actually taken the time to think about it - funny how that was so different with my Angel. All I cared about was her; my feelings were secondary to hers.\\n\\n “I definitely enjoyed it. Did you though? I mean, I didn’t know what to do or anything, should I have done something different?” she asked, chewing on her lip, looking at me worriedly.\\n\\n I laughed and kissed her forehead. “Angel, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. It was perfect, you’re perfect, and I love you so much,” I promised.\\n\\n She snuggled closer to me, taking my hand and interlacing our fingers; she sighed contentedly and closed her eyes. “I love you too, Liam,” she whispered, kissing my chest gently. I couldn’t help my body’s reaction; I started to get turned on again. She was so close and now that I’d had her once I couldn’t get enough. I moved my h*ps back so she didn’t feel me getting excited again. That was her first time; she was bound to be sore so she didn’t need to know about my body’s slutty reaction to hers.\\n\\n But I’d moved too late, she must have noticed. She raised her head and looked down. She looked back to me a little shocked. I smiled apologetically and she giggled. “Seriously? Already?” she teased, as her fingertips trailed down my chest, making me shiver.\\n\\n “I’m sorry; it’ll go in a minute. You’re just too damn sexy. You should rest, you’ll be sore,” I said a little sheepishly. She raised her eyebrows, a slow smile spread across her face as she rolled me onto my back, straddling me, looking like a freaking sex goddess sitting on top of me.\\n\\n “I’m OK. This time I want to have a try, tell me if I do something wrong,” she said, kissing me passionately.\\n\\n Holy crap, this girl is freaking awesome!\\n\\n I woke early the next morning. Amber had to be at dance practice at eight thirty, it was now only just past seven. I couldn’t keep the smile off of my face. Last night was incredible, the best night ever. Hearing her moan my name was the best sound in the world. She enjoyed herself too which made it even more special for me. It hadn’t hurt her too much, well, she said it didn’t anyway. It couldn’t have been that painful because she had me make love to her again after. I wrapped my arms tighter around her, loving the feel of her n**ed skin against mine. I just laid there and watched her sleep until her alarm went off. She was so damn beautiful; she honestly was just like I would imagine an angel to look.\\n\\n She snuggled closer to me as she opened her eyes, a slow smile spreading over her face as she looked at me. “Hi, boyfriend.”\\n\\n I couldn’t help but smile back. “Hi, girlfriend.” She wrapped her arms around me tightly as she sighed contentedly. “How are you feeling today?” I asked, running my fingers through her messed up sex hair.\\n\\n She smiled. “I’m good, a little sore, but extremely happy,” she stated, giggling.\\n\\n I rolled on top of her, pressing my body to hers. “A little sore, huh? I could kiss that better for you,” I flirted.\\n\\n She bit her lip, looking at me excitedly. “Oh you can, huh?”\\n\\n I nodded, grinning wickedly. “Oh yeah.” I smirked at her before kissing my way down her body, barely able to contain my excitement.\\n\\n Chapter 16\\n\\n ~ Amber ~ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-34.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
