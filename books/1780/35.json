He was so incredible last night and it was better than I ever thought it could be. He was so sweet and patient and tender with me, taking everything slow and easy. I couldn’t have asked for a more loving boyfriend.\n “Come on then, lover boy, let’s go,” I ordered, pulling on some sweats and a tank top ready for dance practice.\n He grabbed my waist and kissed the back of my neck. “OK. But please try not to shake that fine ass in my face too much, or I might have to rip those sexy sweats off of you and take you right in front of your crew,” he growled, biting my neck gently.\n I couldn’t help but laugh at that comment. He’d never said anything like that to me before and I blushed like crazy as I slapped his shoulder. “Get out of my room, man-whore,” I joked, pushing him away, laughing. He gripped my hand, tugging me along behind him, grinning happily. I couldn’t help but stare at his ass as he walked in front of me up the hallway. Wow, he’d made me into a pervert too!\n Dance practice was great. I seemed to finally be picking up the lift that I was having trouble with last week, so at least I didn’t fall on my ass too much. By the time we finished I was tired and sweating. Liam sat there patiently watching as usual, joking around with Justin. He seemed to be smiling more than normal. I guess it was hard for him, waiting a whole week for sex, I bet he’d never done that in his life. He was probably just pleased to have finally gotten some last night after all the teasing I’d done recently.\n Wait, had we only been dating a week? I laughed to myself - wow, I was a slut. I slept with a boy I’d been dating for a week; I never thought I would say that! It seemed like we’d been together forever because everything was just so easy and I’d known him for so long.\n When we were finished practicing, we went to a little café and bought sandwiches, taking them over to the park to eat them. Liam sat under the shade of a tree, opening his legs for me to sit between them. Just as I was about to sit down, he stopped me. “Wait, Angel.” He shrugged off his hoodie and laid it on the floor for me to sit on.\n “Thanks.” I smiled gratefully, sitting down and leaning back into his chest, eating my food. As usual, Liam inhaled his food and wrapped his arms around me, rocking me gently while I finished eating. I never thought I would ever have anything like this with a guy. Whenever I’d thought about dating, it had scared the hell out of me because I didn’t ever want a man to touch me like that. After what my father did with all the touching, I guess I was a little scarred. All the time I’d thought I didn’t ever want a boyfriend, I never realised I already had the perfect boy who was sweet and kind and kept me safe every night.\n “I could stay here forever,” I mumbled, closing my eyes, sighing in contentment.\n He kissed the side of my head. “Not regretting sleeping with me then?” he asked.\n I turned to face him, pretending to think about it. “That depends. Are you going to leave me now I’ve given it up?” I joked.\n He smiled at me wickedly. “Hmm, I just might,” he answered, kissing me gently.\n I smiled against his lips. “Well maybe I should get in there first and dump your hot ass. Save myself the embarrassment,” I suggested, raising my eyebrows, smirking at him.\n He laughed and laid down on his back, pulling me on top of him, holding me close. “If you dump my ass I’m going to be begging you until the day I die for you to take me back,” he stated, running his hand down my back.\n “Begging on your knees?” I asked, laughing.\n He nodded, looking at me gravely. “Yep, whatever it takes. Everywhere you go, I’ll be following behind you, begging for another shot. I’ll be just like an obsessive stalker,” he joked, rolling so I was under him.\n “Sounds like that would be a pain in my butt. Maybe I just should keep you then.” I smiled, shrugging.\n He nodded. “Good plan,” he agreed, kissing me passionately, ending the conversation.\n After an hour in the park we went home to tidy the house. As usual the place was a mess. Jake had already started. We had to do a really good job this time because my mom was due back tomorrow. She had no idea there was a raging party in her house every week. I even roped in Kate to help with the cleanup, but to be honest as soon as she showed up neither of us got much done. She followed me around wanting to know every single detail of last night - how was he, what was it like, and every other detail you could think of. I refused to answer the more personal questions, like how long he lasted, and how big he was.\n Finally, we were cleaned up and settled back with pizza and a DVD. “So now that these two are paired up, Jake, that just leaves you and me,” Kate said to my brother, smiling flirtily.\n He smirked at her. “You’re too much of a good girl for me, Kate,” he told her, grinning wickedly.\n She laughed. “And who told you I was a good girl? Anyway, even if I was, maybe you could corrupt me.” She raised her eyebrows, looking him over slowly.\n I cleared my throat theatrically, gaining their attention. “Stop. The movie’s on. No flirting through horror movies, that’s the rule, you both know that,” I scolded, trying to sound stern. Jake shot me a thank you smile. I rolled my eyes. He really didn’t help himself; he\u0027d walked straight into that one. If he didn’t want her to hit on him then why set himself up for it?\n I snuggled closer against Liam, watching the rest of the movie. When it was finally done, Liam went home as usual to keep up the pretense for his parents. With my mom due home tomorrow, we needed to make it look like he stayed at his house. I don’t think my mom would like to hear that the boy from next door sleeps with her daughter every night. I kissed him hungrily at the door, before skipping to my room, deciding on a nice long soak in the bath. I was a little sore from having sex, and on top of that dancing for hours this morning made my muscles a little tight. I slipped in the bath, closing my eyes, blissfully happy.\n “Hey, you,” Liam said from the door way a little while later.\n “Hey,” I greeted, not opening my eyes.\n “Another cold bath?” he asked, laughing. I shook my head and glanced over at him. He was leaning against the doorframe, one leg slung casually over the other, his arms folded across his chest, a smirk on his face. He looked sexy as hell.\n “Actually, it’s warm this time. Want to get in?” I offered.\n He looked a little shocked. “Seriously?” he asked, standing up straighter, looking ridiculously eager.\n I laughed and nodded in confirmation. “Seriously.”\n Quicker than I thought possible, he was n**ed and in the bath behind me, wrapping his arms around me.\n Sunday flew by incredibly fast. I was really excited to see my mom; I hadn’t seen her for just over two weeks. She wasn’t actually due back until next weekend but she wanted to come back this week instead. It was now just after six o’clock, and she was due home any minute. I was sat on Liam’s lap in the lounge, practically vibrating with excitement. When I heard her car pull up outside, I ran towards the door, squealing happily.\n Jake jumped up at the same time as me and grabbed me round the waist, laughing as he threw me on the sofa. “Me first, shrimp,” he stated, running for the door ahead of me, making me laugh.\n I followed him out of the door and attacked my mom into a hug. “Hey, Jake. Hey, Amber!” she chirped, hugging us tightly. Liam went straight to the trunk and pulled out her luggage. When she pulled out of the hug she was smiling with tears in her eyes. “I missed you guys,” she said, kissing us both happily, “Hey, Liam. Got a hug for me?” she asked, grinning.\n He laughed and nodded. “Always, Margaret,” he said, hugging her tightly.\n “You got more handsome,” she stated, patting his cheek affectionately.\n He laughed. “I don’t know about that,” he answered, shaking his head, grinning. I bit my lip; he’d definitely got more handsome in my opinion. My mom loved Liam, she always had done. He spent a lot of time over at our place, and since my father left she became really close with Pat and Rick once she was ‘allowed’ to socialise.\n “So, what have I missed?” she asked, looping her arm through mine, walking off towards the door, leaving the boys to carry her bags.\n I grinned knowing that she was going to freak out when I told her about Liam. “Um, not much. I fell in love,” I said happily.\n She gasped and pulled me to a stop, looking at me so shocked that I couldn’t help but laugh. “You…You what?” she stuttered, looking at me with a bewildered expression.\n I smiled and made her walk into the house, pulling her into the kitchen. “I got a boyfriend,” I confirmed, grinning like a mad person.\n “Oh, Amber, I never thought you would be able to! I’m so proud of you, honey. I know how hard it is for you to let people near you,” she cooed, hugging me tightly, tears glistening in her eyes again. Liam and Jake walked in; both of them leaning against the kitchen counter. Liam shot me a little wink and I smiled in response. “Well, what’s his name? Do I get to meet him while I’m here? Oh wait, does Jake know?” she asked, whispering the last part, probably thinking she was dropping me in something with my overprotective big brother.\n I laughed and looked at Jake who was in the process of glaring at Liam again. “Yeah, Mom, Jake knows,” I confirmed, chuckling.\n “Well? Who is it? What’s he like?” she asked, beaming at me excitedly.\n “Well, mostly he’s a pain in the ass. He’s cocky and way too confident. But on the plus side, he’s extremely hot,” I stated, watching Liam’s face as he tried not to laugh.\n “Looks don’t last long, Amber! You shouldn’t base a relationship on how someone looks!” she scolded, her eyebrows knitting together in disapproval.\n I couldn’t help but laugh. “Don’t worry, Mom, I’ll kick him to the curb when his looks go,” I joked. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-35.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: \n Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
