I climbed in to bed with a smile on my face.\n A little while later, I heard Jake go to bed so I knew Liam was on his own. “Kate, I’m going to go and see Liam for a little while,” I said, once I knew that Jake would be asleep.\n “Oh really? Give him another view of that sexy ass sleepwear?” she teased, smiling.\n I giggled. “Something like that. Don’t wait up, I might be a while.” I winked at her as I climbed out of the bed, grabbing my cellphone so I could use the alarm function.\n “Have fun, and don’t do anything that I wouldn’t do,” she joked. There actually wasn\u0027t much that Kate wouldn’t do, she’d had a few boyfriends and she definitely wasn’t a virgin. I giggled and left the room, snaking down the hallway to the living room, where Liam was already laying on the couch under the spare duvet. I set the alarm for six; the usual ‘get Liam out of my window’ time, and put it on the floor.\n “Hey, Angel,” he whispered, smiling at me and pulling the duvet out of the way so I could lay down next to him. I eagerly climbed in and melted my body against his. He sighed contentedly and wrapped his arms around me tightly. “That was not fair earlier, by the way,” he scolded, as he kissed my forehead.\n I smiled teasingly. “Really, you didn’t like my pyjamas?” I asked, innocently.\n “I loved the pyjamas, but not how you paraded your sexy ass right in front of me with your brother sitting there,” he groaned.\n “You think I have a sexy ass?” I teased.\n “Hmm, I can’t remember, let me have another look,” he said huskily. I giggled and rolled over onto my stomach, putting my hands under my head.\n He groaned again and slowly ran his hand down my back, across my ass and down one of my thighs before going back up the other one. His hand came to a stop on my ass, tracing the line of the lace, making me shiver. Jeez, what’s happening to me? I actually want him to touch me. If he made a move to touch me, I wasn’t going to stop him this time. He bent his head and kissed my shoulder, before moving down lower and trailing kisses across my back and hips. He kissed to the bottom of the shorts and trailed his tongue across the very bottom of my ass cheek, just where it meets the leg. I gasped and stiffened.\n He pulled away quickly. “Sorry, sorry. I got carried away,” he said apologetically.\n I blushed like crazy. “I liked it, Liam,” I said huskily, my voice shaking slightly from the desire that was racing through my bloodstream.\n “You did?” he asked, sounding surprised about it.\n “Oh heck yeah,” I admitted breathily, making me blush again. Wow, did I just say that? That’s so embarrassing!\n He moaned slightly and bent his head, tracing his tongue along the edge of the lace again. This time I couldn’t help the little moan that escaped my lips. The sound seemed to encourage him, as he did it again, and slipped his hand up my thigh, massaging my ass and back. He kissed up my back, lifting the material of my top so he could kiss my skin. I rolled over so we were face to face and kissed him, pulling him down to me so his whole body was pressed onto mine. I could feel his skin against mine as I was glad I decided to go for the skimpy sleepwear. He was getting excited downstairs again, I could feel him pressed against my thigh, but I wasn’t scared this time, I was encouraged. He brought his hands up and cupped my breasts; I let out a sigh when I felt his hot hand just through the material of my top because I wasn’t wearing a bra. He moaned as he rubbed his thumb over my ni**les making them hard. He was only wearing shorts so I rubbed my hands down his chest and stomach, just marveling at how toned and perfect he was.\n He kissed down my neck and across my br**sts through my top. My hands tangled into his silky brown hair as he kissed his way down my stomach, getting hold of my top with his teeth and pulling it up, slowly, exposing my stomach. I moaned and he brought his mouth down on my bare skin, licking it lightly and blowing on it, making my body almost vibrate with excitement. He slipped his hand under my top and slowly trailed it up towards my breasts, trailing his fingertips over them while he continued to kiss my stomach, but he was kissing higher now and my breathing was starting to speed in anticipation of him kissing my breasts.\n Oh God, yep this is way too fast! “Sorry…. Liam…. stop,” I mumbled.\n He pulled his head back immediately, and smiled his beautiful smile. “You don’t need to apologise, Angel.” He bent his head and kissed me again gently. I smiled at him gratefully as he rolled off of me, pulling me close to his chest, running his fingers through my hair, looking at me lovingly. “You are so beautiful,” he murmured, kissing my nose gently as he pulled my top back down for me. I giggled and shook my head. He really was full of these corny lines! Maybe that works for him to get the girls to sleep with him. He smiled, looking a little hurt. “You don’t believe me,” he stated.\n “How many girls have you said that to, Liam?” I whispered, not really sure my voice would sound right if I spoke normally.\n He sighed and looked a little defeated. “I can’t change my past, Angel, trust me I wish I could. I’ve never felt anything for anyone else, I swear. I’ve never told anyone they were beautiful before, only ever you. Nothing else compares to you,” he said, looking at me intently, willing me to understand. My breath caught in my throat at his sweet words. I squeezed myself closer to him and buried my face in his chest, breathing him in. He sighed happily and wrapped his arms tightly around me, kissing my forehead. “Goodnight, Angel,” he whispered.\n “Night, Liam,” I murmured against his skin.\n I had a feeling that the being careful not to give him my heart plan, had gone completely out the window. All I could do now, was pray that he wouldn’t break it. I snuggled closer to him, laying my head on his chest and falling asleep within minutes. Just as I started to go under I thought I heard him whisper something that sounded like ‘I love you’, but Liam wouldn’t say that, so it must have been something else.\n Chapter 10\n “WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?” I heard Jake roar from nearby. I opened my eyes and looked at him. His face was bright red and he looked murderously angry.\n “Jake, not so loud you’re going to make my ears bleed! What’s wrong?” I asked, sitting up. But as soon as I moved, I realised what was wrong. I was still on the couch with Liam. Oh no! I jumped up quickly and looked at Liam who had his mouth hanging open, looking completely shocked. OK, I need to salvage the situation quickly. “Damn it, Liam! Yuck! Did you have your hands on me?” I cried, pretending to shudder in horror. Jake looked at me, his face still angry, but he looked slightly confused now.\n “I…. er…. don’t…. what?” Liam stammered.\n “What the hell were you doing with him, Amber?” Jake growled angrily, pointing at Liam who just looked confused at this point.\n “I must have fallen asleep, I guess.” I frowned, shaking my head as if I was confused too.\n “Fallen asleep? Well, what were you doing with him in the first place?” he asked, shooting Liam another dirty look before turning back to me. OK, come on, think! Oh I got it; he’ll have to accept this one!\n “I had a bad dream, Jake,” I mumbled, looking at the floor, and pretending to be upset.\n He gasped and wrapped his arms around me, instantly, putting his chin on the top of my head. “Oh shit, Amber. It’s OK,” he cooed, rocking me slightly.\n “I was upset and I thought you were out here, but you weren’t. Liam comforted me, that’s all. We must have fallen asleep,” I whispered, feeling guilty that I was lying. I really wasn’t ready for him to know yet, especially after the way he was just looking at Liam.\n “I’m sorry, I just thought…. well, never mind,” Jake muttered, pulling back to look at me. “You alright now?” I nodded, biting my lip to try and ease some of the guilt I felt. He looked over at Liam. “Sorry, man, I jumped to conclusions and er…. thanks for taking care of my sister.”\n Liam looked really uncomfortable and glanced at me; I gave him a pleading expression, begging him with my eyes not to say anything. “Yeah, no probs.” He shrugged, rubbing a hand through his messy bed hair.\n I quickly pulled out of Jake’s grasp. “I’m going to go and get changed for school. What time is it anyway?” I asked, looking around for my cellphone. Why hadn’t the freaking alarm gone off?\n “It’s not even six yet, Amber. I woke up early.” Jake shrugged.\n “Right, well then I’m going to go have some breakfast before I go in the shower. Er…. thanks, Liam, for last night,” I said, blushing and giving him a small smile.\n “It was definitely my pleasure, Angel.” He winked at me, smiling happily.\n Jake slapped him across the back of his head, making him wince. “Little sister!” he stated, rolling his eyes and stomping off towards the kitchen, leaving me and Liam in the lounge.\n Once Jake had gone, Liam looked at me. “I don’t like having to lie to your brother, Angel,” he whispered, frowning.\n “I know, but just a couple of weeks, please?” I begged, kissing him quickly on his lips and turning to run off in the direction of the kitchen. He grabbed my hand and pulled me back to him, kissing me again, before he gave me one of his beautiful smiles. I almost skipped to the kitchen because I was so happy. Jake was having toast, so I made two bowls of my favourite cereal, one for me, one for Liam. I carried them into the lounge and handed him one, before plopping down on the floor by the couch.\n “Er…. thanks for this, Angel, but I don’t like coco pops,” he said, turning his nose up at the bowl.\n I frowned at him, confused. He was always eating my cereal. Every day he had a bowl of coco pops. “Sure you do, you eat it every day.” I looked at him like he’d lost his mind; did he think I was stupid or something?\n He laughed and shook his head. “No I don’t. I make a bowl of it every day and pretend to eat it, before you come in and snatch it off me,” he said with a sexy smile and amused eyes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-20.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: \n Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
