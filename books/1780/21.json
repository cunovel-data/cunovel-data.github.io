I like to make you breakfast,” he said simply. I gasped at the revelation. He made them for me? “You make them for me? Every day?” I asked, my mouth hanging open, shocked that he would be so sweet and I had never even noticed. Every day I would come in and make some nasty comment to him about eating at home and leaving my cereal alone, and all this time he makes it for me? Jeez, that is so freaking sweet! He just shrugged as if it was nothing. All this time I thought he was just a jerk, when really he was being nice to me! Jake walked in then, so I couldn’t say anything. I scoffed my breakfast and practically ran to my bedroom, grabbing my cellphone and texting him because as I couldn’t speak to him: ‘Thank you, that is really sweet! I never realised that you did that. I’ll thank you properly later! X’ I sent. I smiled to myself and went to take a shower. As we stepped out of Liam’s car at school, we were swamped by the usual hoard of girls wanting to paw Jake and Liam. I rolled my eyes as Jessica pushed her way to the front and wrapped her dirty little arms round my boyfriend’s waist, looking at him with her come to bed eyes. “Jessica, seriously you need to get off,” Liam said sternly, unwrapping her from him and stepping backwards. “Liam, baby, how about we skip first period and we go have some fun,” she purred suggestively, rubbing her hand up his chest. Oh my God, I was so jealous that I actually felt sick! I turned and walked off as fast as I could, just wanting to be away from it all. After a minute I could hear Kate running to catch up with me, she grabbed my hand pulling me to a stop. “Seriously, I’m not in the mood,” I almost shouted, turning to her, but it wasn’t her, it was Liam. “Hey, I just wanted to walk you to class.” He frowned, looking at me sadly. “Oh right…. er…. sorry. I thought you were with Jessica, having some fun,” I said sarcastically, embarrassed that I had shouted at him. He shook his head and stepped closer to me. “No, I’m not with her, I’m with you,” he said sweetly, smiling at me and making my heart beat faster. “Right, yeah sorry, I just…. I don’t know….” I trailed off, blushing like crazy. “You were jealous,” he stated, seeming pleased about it. I nodded reluctantly not really wanting to admit it. “Good, I’ve been waiting for you to get jealous for the last twelve years,” he said, grinning like a crazy person. I laughed. “You have? Well there you go then, it finally happened.” I kicked my shoes in the stones; trying to distract myself from the jealous feeling I still had coursing through my veins. I guess I was going to have to get used to girls being all over him. He was Liam James for goodness sake; girls have always followed him around, begging for his attention. “Remember the talk we had yesterday, the one about trust? Well, that works both ways you know. I will never hurt you, but you need to believe that too.” He put his finger under my chin and tilted my head up, making me look at him. I sighed; yeah OK I did say that I guess. “I do trust you, it was just hard to watch,” I replied, smirking, mimicking his words from yesterday. He laughed. “Yeah well, the word\u0027s out now that I have a girlfriend so that should put an end to the whole flirting thing,” he said with confidence, brushing my hair from my face. “You told everyone that you have a girlfriend?” I asked, shocked. OK wow, maybe he is more serious than I thought about making this work. “Yeah, of course. I do have a girlfriend. I have the sexiest, most beautiful girlfriend in the world, who is yet to give me the thank you that she promised me by text this morning.” He smiled his flirty smile at me and it felt like a thousand butterflies took off in my stomach. I giggled and leant forwards until my mouth was almost touching his. “All good things come to those who wait,” I teased, winking at him and walking off. He groaned and caught me up quickly. “You don’t think twelve years is long enough to wait?” he asked, faking shock, making me giggle. “Hmm, not really. I think I’ll make you wait a little longer.” I blew him a kiss as I stepped through the doors to my history class. I heard him groan, but when I looked back he was smiling, watching me walk away. I purposefully swayed my ass, trying to look sexy; it must have worked because three boys from my history class whistled at me and made a comment about my sexy booty. I rolled my eyes. Boys! I couldn’t speak to Liam much at lunch, we were sat at the same table but everyone wanted to talk to him. “So, you really have a secret girlfriend?” Tim, one of his friends, asked, looking at him like he didn’t believe him at all. “Yep,” Liam confirmed, looking extremely proud about it. Every time he looked at me, I blushed like crazy, and was sure someone was going to notice. “She must be one hot woman to have tamed the beast into settling down,” Rick smirked. Liam laughed, his eyes shot to me for a split second. “She is the sexiest thing alive, man,” he said confidently. “Really? She a good fuck?” Rick asked, picking at his sandwich. “Dude, seriously, I’m not going to answer that about my girl,” Liam stated with a smirk. “I bet I could blow her out of the water,” Rochelle flirted, running her hand down his arm. He laughed. “You know what, you wouldn’t stand a chance. My girl is incredibly beautiful, both inside and out.” Liam shrugged, pulling his arm away, grinning. All the girls at the table aww’d and ahh’d. I smiled and tried to eat my lunch. I could feel Kate’s eyes on me so I looked at her, she was grinning at me from ear to ear. I rolled my eyes at her, chuckling. “He hasn’t slept with her, she believes in no sex before marriage,” Jake interjected, smirking. I swallowed a laugh. Had Jake really believed him when he told him that this morning? Everyone gasped and looked at Liam, who was grinning like crazy. “No shit! You haven’t slept with her?” Rick asked sceptically. “No I haven’t, but that’s not really any of your business, guys.” Liam shook his head, grinning. “I’ve got to go. I need to speak to coach about practice.” He shrugged, getting up. Half of the boys got up too, following him out. As soon as he was gone, all the girls started planning and scheming. They wanted to know who the secret girl was, and would stop at nothing to find out, then they each took out twenty dollars and put it into the middle of the table. I looked at them, confused. “So, the next girl to nail him, wins the pot,” Jessica said, with a smirk. I gasped. “Seriously? He’s just said he has a girlfriend and isn’t interested, and you’re betting on who’s going to sleep with him next? What if his girlfriend sleeps with him next?” I asked, shocked. I can’t believe these girls are betting on ha**ng s*x with someone! It’s a damn competition! “Well, if she puts in her money then she can win, but she’s obviously not giving him what he needs. He’ll stray eventually. The next one to nail him wins, but I guarantee it won’t be his girlfriend. He can’t wait. No sex before marriage, yeah right! This is Liam James we‘re talking about.” She rolled her eyes, grinning. She was obviously very confident that she’d win. Then I had an idea, I pulled out a twenty and dropped it into their pile. “The next one to nail him, right?” I asked, barely able to contain my grin. “Yeah right! Like you stand a chance, Emo!” Jessica spat at me nastily. “So, how much does the winner get?” I asked excitedly, ignoring her sneer. She counted the money that was in the pile. “Well, there’s two hundred and forty here at the moment, but once people hear of it…. well, I don’t know…. the last time we did this, it was for Chris. It got up to six hundred and twenty, but Liam is way hotter, and by the looks of him untouchable, well, for the moment anyway.” Jessica laughed, folding the money and putting it in her pocket, writing the entrants names onto a piece of paper. I laughed; wow, this is going to be easy money. Kate was laughing her head off. “You going to put in as well?” Jessica asked Kate and Sarah politely. “Nope, not me. I don’t stand a chance.” Kate shrugged, still laughing. Sarah passed Jessica her money. “I’m in. Who could say no at the chance of all that money and they get to sleep with Liam James,” Sarah said dreamily. I grabbed my two friend’s arms and dragged them out of the lunch room to our next class. I had to hang around after school, waiting for Jake and Liam to finish their hockey practice. I snuck into the rink and hid at the back so I wouldn’t be seen. We weren’t allowed in here during practice because their coach said that girls distracted the players. I loved to watch their hockey games; there was just something about the way they glided over the ice so fast and gracefully. They were doing sprints at the moment, skating from one line to the other as fast as they could, then they had to dribble a puck around a load of cones, and finally they were all taking turns shooting at the goal, with my brother doing his best to keep the pucks out. He was a really great goalkeeper, but he only played for fun. Liam on the other hand, had been offered a full athletic scholarship to one of the best collages in the country. He was hoping to turn pro - which apparently, he had every chance of doing because he had scouts falling all over him. I found myself watching Liam skating. I’d watched him do this hundreds, if not thousands of times, but there was just something so beautiful about it. He took my breath away. I was watching the way his feet moved, the way his messy brown hair blew as he skated, the way the ice sprayed up as he stopped. And, of course, I noticed how unbelievably hot he looked in his uniform. I snuck back out as practice finished and waited by Liam’s car for them to shower. Sarah came up as I was standing there. “Hey, girl,” she chirped, bouncing up and down a little in excitement.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-21.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
