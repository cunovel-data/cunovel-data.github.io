I turned to look at him and he brushed my hair behind my ear, his fingers lingering on my cheek, making me blush. “You really are the most beautiful thing in the world,” he murmured. My heart skipped a beat at the honesty in his voice, his blue eyes were burning into mine, making me feel like the only girl in the world.\n “Cut that crap out! I might have given my blessing but I don’t need it shoved in my face over breakfast,” Jake growled as he walked into the kitchen to make some cereal. He slapped Liam on the back of the head on the way past as usual.\n We all laughed and Liam stepped behind me, wrapping his arms around my waist, leaning his head on my shoulder. “Thanks, Jake. I know you said stay away but…” Liam trailed off, looking at my brother gratefully.\n “Whatever, Liam. We’re fine. Just don’t make us have a problem, OK,” Jake replied, smiling a friendly smile.\n Liam’s arms tightened around me. “I won’t.” He kissed my shoulder lightly and Jake fake gagged, making me laugh.\n “Well, come on then, lovebirds, I suppose you need to get to school a little earlier so that you can announce you’re together,” Jake stated, rolling his eyes.\n Liam grinned and nodded. I gasped and shook my head fiercely. “No way! We can’t do that,” I said, looking at Liam. He looked really hurt for some reason.\n “Why not?” he asked, taking my hand, and looking a little confused.\n I glanced at Jake; he really wasn\u0027t going to like this. “Er, well, I sort of have a bet going on. The next one to sleep with you will win the pot. I could really use that money.” I looked at Liam uncomfortably, but he just started to laugh hysterically.\n Jake almost choked on his drink. “No way! You can’t do that!” he cried, shaking his head violently. “I don’t want to know that you two are having sex. I don’t!”\n I laughed at his annoyed and disgusted face. “Jake, we’re not having sex.” I shrugged, making his face relax a little. “But when we do, I definitely want to win the pot. I won’t if people know I’m his girlfriend already.” I looked at Liam, unsure if he would go along with this or not.\n “Angel, I don’t want you to want to be with me for some bet.” He frowned, looking a little hurt.\n I smiled seductively at him. “You think that’s the reason I’m going to want to have sex with you? Trust me, lover boy; it won’t be to do with the money, that’ll just a perk.”\n He leant in and put his mouth to my ear. “So what will be the reason?” he breathed, sending a shiver down my spine.\n I bit my lip. “Hmm, I’m not sure but it’ll have something to do with you begging me on your knees,” I teased, smirking at him.\n He laughed and kissed me, pulling me close to his body, sending ripples of desire racing through my bloodstream. He pulled away to look at me, lust written clear across his face. “I’d happily beg you right now you know.”\n I patted his chest and stepped away before I dragged him back to my bedroom and ripped his sexy ass jeans and black button down shirt off his flawless body. “Oh I know, lover boy.” I laughed, trying to catch my breath.\n I glanced at Jake who was staring at us eyes wide, his mouth hanging open in shock. “Guys, I seriously can’t take these PDA’s,” he said, grimacing and shaking his head.\n “It’s OK, the PDA’s done. I just think we should keep this quiet for a little while. Why not make a little money for doing something that would happen eventually anyway? That’s how I look at it,” I said, shrugging.\n Liam and Jake looked at each other. “I guess. But will you be able to win? I mean, was the bet to make me break up with my girlfriend or something?” Liam asked, frowning.\n I giggled and shook my head. “Nope, I made sure of that. It’s definitely just the next one to nail you, as they so eloquently put it.”\n Liam shook his head, looking a little disgusted. “I can’t believe girls do that sort of thing.”\n Jake laughed. “You know what? I think I might announce that I’ve got a girlfriend next. Then I can just pick someone and we can split the money,” he said brightly, as if he was serious.\n Liam grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the door. “Come on, let’s get to school before you brother has any other bright ideas.” He laughed, shaking his head at Jake.\n Liam winked at me in the mirror as we pulled into the parking lot. There were more girls than usual waiting for them. They all made a beeline for Liam as soon as his door opened. Jessica, as usual, was at the front.\n I laughed. “Good luck, boyfriend,” I teased, winking at him as I walked off, swaying my ass on purpose. I knew he was watching me. When I got to the door I glanced back over my shoulder to see him pulling a girl’s arms off of him, a distasteful expression on his face. He must have had about twenty-five girls round him, he looked extremely pissed off. I laughed and went to find my friends; as usual, they were hanging out by our lockers.\n “Hey, guys,” I chirped, as I got up to them.\n “Wow, someone’s in a good mood today! Any particular reason?” Sean asked, looking confused at my happy face.\n “Nope, no reason in particular. I just watched Liam getting hounded by like twenty-five girls. He looks really annoyed about it, that was pretty funny,” I explained, grinning wildly. Just then he walked past me with Jake. He had a girl flirting with him on either side, and about another ten walking behind him. I burst out laughing and he shot me a dark look, making me laugh harder.\n “I’m not surprised he has all those girls after him. Do you know how much the pot is now?” Kate asked, smirking at me.\n I nodded. “Yeah I know, Sarah told me it’s like eighteen hundred dollars or something. I can’t believe it.” I shook my head disapprovingly, and tried not to imagine what it would feel like to win that much money.\n Kate, Sarah and Sean exchanged a look, before bursting into laughter. “No, that was yesterday’s total. Today it’s up to four thousand two hundred,” Kate said. I felt the colour drain from my face as my heart sank. Holy crap! That’s like, oh God I can’t even work it out! Like two hundred girls, all wanting to sleep with my boyfriend!\n “Oh my God! Really?” I asked as I swallowed the lump that was rapidly forming in my throat. The thought of all those girls throwing themselves at my boy, literally made me feel a little ill. Kate nodded and looked a little sympathetic; as if she knew what I was thinking. Sarah and Sean just looked excited because they obviously had no idea I was with Liam. Luckily, the bell rang, so we all made our way to class.\n At lunchtime I decided I would start making my play for Liam. People needed to at least see that I was trying. I couldn’t just announce that I had slept with him, so I needed people to see me putting in the effort. I hadn’t talked it through with Liam, but a little harmless flirting over lunch shouldn\u0027t be too hard. As I carried my tray of food across the lunchroom to our usual table, I turned to my friends.\n “Guys, I’m going to go make my play for Liam for the bet. Let’s go sit with my brother today, OK?”\n Kate gave me a knowing look and winked at me and we all walked over to the jock table. The jock table was almost full of girls, all of them flirting shamelessly with Liam. I smiled at his expression; he looked even more pissed off now than earlier. I looked at the girl sitting next to Liam; she’d finished her lunch and was staring at him intently, a flirty expression on her face.\n “Hey, Sally. I just heard that someone hit your car in the parking lot, was there much damage?” I asked innocently.\n She gasped and jumped up. “Shit! That’s my mom’s car!” she cried, as she turned and ran off. I heard my friends burst into laughter behind me as they took seats further down the table.\n “Hi, Liam.” I smiled at him as I plopped down in the chair next to his.\n “Hey, Angel,” he replied, grinning at me. I looked around to see I was getting the death glares from all the girls nearby, obviously because I had earned a smile already. “Someone hit Sally’s car?” he asked, eating his tuna sandwich.\n I shrugged and shook my head. “Nah. I just said that because I wanted to sit here.”\n He burst into laughter. “I knew you wanted me,” he teased, winking at me.\n “Well, who doesn’t,” I answered, smirking and looking around the table at the girls who were all trying to kill me with their eyes. I grabbed my bottle of water and pretended to try to open it. “Liam, can you open this for me?” I asked, pouting slightly.\n “Angel, if you keep pouting, the wind will change and you’ll get stuck like that,” he joked, grinning and taking my bottle from me. He opened it easily and passed it back.\n “Thanks.” I smiled, ignoring his remark. “Wow, I never realised how strong you are. You must work out a lot, huh?” I purred, trailing my finger down his bicep, biting on my lip seductively. He looked at me lustfully, his eyes fixed on my mouth. Just from the pained expression on his face, I could tell he wanted to kiss me. He didn’t answer. “So? Do you work out a lot? Because you must do, I mean, your body it\u0027s, mmm….” I trailed off, looking him over slowly.\n He gulped. “Er, I guess, yeah a bit,” he muttered, still looking at me a little shocked and bewildered.\n I didn’t want this to go too far, I was only setting the scene for my victory at the moment. I broke eye contact and started to eat my food, slowly, letting the fork linger in my mouth longer than necessary. “Oh God,” I moaned, closing my eyes chewing slowly. “This is so good,” I breathed. I heard him moan slightly next to me and I knew my sex noises were getting to him. I looked over at him. “Liam, you should try this,” I purred seductively. He had a pained look across his face as he stared at me with his mouth slightly open. He shook his head slightly, as if trying to push a thought away and I swallowed my giggle. Oh crap, he is so going to make me pay for this later. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-26.html","bookId":1780,"book":{"id":1780,"title":"The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window","description":"Storyline: \n Liam James, boy next door and total douchebag, is my brother’s best friend.
