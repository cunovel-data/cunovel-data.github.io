{"id":99742,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"The cloak room vanished, replaced by Vlad encased in an indigo background that took me a moment to realize was the night sky. Relief made me want to weep, but before I could say anything, his voice cut across my mind.\n \"Leila, where are you?\"\n I didn\u0027t answer out loud because I was coughing too much.\n In the coatroom at the club.\n \"Get out,\" he said tightly. \"You must know it\u0027s on fire.\"\n Do you think that escaped my notice? I asked in disbelief. My legs are broken and part of the wall is pinning me.\n His eyes closed. When they opened, they were bright green.\n \"I\u0027m only minutes away. Cover yourself with whatever is near and stay as close to the floor as you can.\"\n A coughing fit kept me from responding because it took all of my concentration to breathe. I wasn\u0027t sure if the roaring in my ears was the flames eating through the walls or an indication that I was about to pass out.\n Already done, I managed before my mind started to wander even more. Part of me knew that was a very bad sign, but the rest of me didn\u0027t care.\n \"Leila,\" Vlad said sharply. \"Do not pass out.\"\n So arrogant, I thought. As if you can order someone to stay conscious. Bit by bit, my coughing lessened, as did the agony in my legs. The relief from the pain was overwhelming in more ways than one. If I couldn\u0027t feel my legs, maybe I wouldn\u0027t feel the fire.\n \"You won\u0027t burn.\" Even amidst my drifting away, I caught the vehemence in his voice. \"I will make it in time.\"\n I didn\u0027t respond. Vlad said something else, but it was lost in the beautiful roar all around me. If I concentrated on it, I felt like I could fly. I focused on that, and soon everything began to fade away. I was lighter, floating, free . . .\n Pain dragged me back into consciousness with pitiless abruptness. I wasn\u0027t on the floor anymore, but wrapped inside a hard embrace as Vlad picked me up. Red and orange flames were all around us, their heat blistering, but then the flames extinguished and a path cleared as if by magic. Vlad strode through it and soon the choking smoke vanished, replaced by flashing lights and soot-streaked people. He bit his wrist, and then something warm and wet pressed against my mouth.\n \"Drink,\" he ordered.\n His dark hair curtained everything else from view as he kept his face close to mine, making sure I swallowed in between fits of coughing. Pain erupted in my legs before fading into a dull ache and then finally an odd itching. My coughing lessened, too, though I still couldn\u0027t seem to draw enough air into my lungs. Finally Vlad removed his wrist, and my head fell back against the cradle of his arm.\n \"You made it,\" I said weakly.\n His smile was brief-and fierce. \"I told you I would.\"\n Vlad flew me back to the house, but instead of stopping at the second floor, he strode up to the fourth and deposited me in a stunningly gothic room with a high, triangular ceiling. With its size and grandeur, I would\u0027ve thought it was his room, but the bed didn\u0027t have those distinctive midnight-green drapes.\n \"What\u0027s wrong with the other room?\" I asked, still feeling dizzy and worn out even though his blood had healed my injuries.\n He pulled my boots off, tossing them to the floor before he whisked back the covers and set me on the bed.\n \"Someone wanted you badly enough to attack on my territory. It\u0027s been a hundred years since anyone dared such a thing, so you\u0027ll stay close to me until I find them.\"\n I closed my eyes, guilt and anger swarming me. \"Maximus?\"\n \"I saw him, he\u0027s alive,\" Vlad said, to my vast relief.\n He settled the blankets over me. I normally hated anyone treating me like I was helpless-I\u0027d had enough of that when I\u0027d been helpless right after the accident-but now, I didn\u0027t mind. Having the most dangerous vampire in the world look after me somehow made me feel safe, and after nearly burning to death, I wanted to hold on to that feeling a little longer.\n \"How did you end up trapped in the cloakroom?\" Vlad asked almost casually. \"Maximus was supposed to protect you.\"\n I grimaced at the memory. \"A silver-haired vampire who looked a little like Anderson Cooper threw me into it after I electrocuted him.\"\n Both dark brows went up. \"You attacked him?\"\n \"Maximus was fighting the other three vamps and Silver had just killed Hunter. He was about to jump Maximus, so I zapped him. It gave Maximus time to beat one of the vamps and get out of the way. But Silver Hair was pissed and chucked me through the coatroom wall to show it.\"\n \"What were you thinking, risking yourself that way?\" Vlad muttered.\n Did he miss the part where Maximus was about to get killed? \"I\u0027m drunk,\" I said testily. \"I\u0027ll try anything if I\u0027m drunk.\"\n His teeth flashed in a quick grin. \"I\u0027ll remember that. We\u0027ll speak more about this tomorrow. Now, you need to rest.\"\n His authoritative tone reminded me of why I\u0027d gone to the club in the first place. Despite feeling like I might conk out, I pushed myself up on the pillows.\n \"Not yet. We have some things to clear up first.\"\n \"Such as?\" The question was mild, but his eyes glinted.\n \"Why have you been avoiding me?\"\n \"I haven\u0027t. I was out gathering items with Mencheres and the others. I\u0027d only been back an hour when Ben called to report the attack on the club.\"\n His gaze never wavered, but . . . \"Then why did Maximus say you ordered him to shadow me there?\"\n \"He called to tell me what you were doing.\" Vlad\u0027s tone hardened. \"Though it seems you did a better job protecting him.\"\n Okay, so he hadn\u0027t been ducking me. That left the bigger issue.\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me there was a catch to drinking your blood? Maximus said that doing it made me, ah . . .\"\n \"Mine,\" Vlad finished without hesitation.\n My temper rose at his complete self-assuredness. \"I didn\u0027t agree to that, so forget it.\"\n He sat on the edge of the bed and leaned down, setting his arms on either side of my face.\n \"You think my blood is the only tie between us?\"\n His voice was low, yet edged with palpable hunger. It seemed to rub me in places I\u0027d only ever touched before, making my anger fade under a flash of desire. Vlad was so close that his hair was a shadowy veil all around me, and when he began to caress my face with light, sure strokes, it was all I could do not to close my eyes in bliss.\n \"This is our true tie,\" he whispered, his breath falling hotly onto my lips. \"You\u0027re meant for me, and I will have you.\"\n Then his mouth lowered in a hard, claiming kiss. A groan parted my lips and his tongue snaked between them to stroke mine with sensual dominance. He tasted like sin made into wine: dark, heady, and impossible to resist. The raw demand in his kiss and his hard body pressing me into the bed made my nerve endings flare with blinding sensation. Need overwhelmed me, causing an exquisitely painful clenching in my loins. I pulled him closer, tangling my hand in his hair and gasping when I felt his fangs slide out. My trepidation vanished when he kissed me deeper, drawing my tongue into his mouth and sucking on it until the throbbing between my legs matched the pace of my pulse. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-32.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: \n After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
