{"id":99712,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"I was in a thick, swampish area, staring in horror as my husband\u0027s hands clamped around my throat. Pain exploded in my neck, blurring his image as I futilely scratched and clawed at his gloved hands. He increased the pressure while telling me he\u0027d found out about my affair and exactly how he\u0027d dispose of my body. The pain intensified until it seared its way down my entire body. Then, mercifully, it stopped, and I felt like I was floating away. My murderer stayed where he was, his hands still clamped around my throat, unaware that I was now looking down at him from outside my body. Finally, he let go. Then he walked over to where he\u0027d parked the car, opened the trunk, and took out several items as though musing over which one to start with first . . . \"Frankie!\" I blinked, back in my own consciousness, the hazy images fading into the familiar, crystal-clear surroundings of the bar. Dean stood between me and the woman who\u0027d unwittingly triggered my abilities by touching my right hand. He didn\u0027t make that same mistake, but Dean was close enough that I had to look over his shoulder to see her. She clutched her hand as though it hurt, her brown eyes wide as she babbled something to the man I now knew was her husband. The same man who\u0027d murder her tonight, if I didn\u0027t stop him. \"I didn\u0027t do anything!\" she kept saying. \"She just started screaming . . .\" Her husband grabbed her arm. \"Screw this creep show, Jackie, we\u0027ll get directions somewhere else.\" \"Stop them,\" I gasped to Dean, still feeling the phantom effect of fingers on my throat. \"He\u0027s going to kill her.\" If anyone in the bar had been minding their business before, that statement directed their attention to me better than a gunshot. Jackie gaped at me, but her husband\u0027s eyes narrowed. He began to push his way past the small crowd that gathered around us, dragging her along. Dean stood in their path, blocking the way to the exit. \"You\u0027re not leaving yet,\" he said calmly. The husband paused, looking Dean up and down. If Dean\u0027s expression wasn\u0027t intimidating enough, the scaly green tattoos covering his skin rippled when he crossed his arms, showing bulky muscles. \"Come on,\" the husband muttered. \"I don\u0027t want trouble-\" \"Look in his trunk,\" I interrupted, my voice stronger. \"You\u0027ll find work gloves, duct tape, and leaf and lawn bags.\" The surrounding patrons had begun to stare at the husband. He laughed uneasily. \"I don\u0027t have to listen to this shit-\" \"Plus he has an axe, a shovel, flashlights, bleach, rope, pliers, and a book on forensics,\" I cut him off again. \"You found out she was leaving you and you couldn\u0027t handle it. So you were going to strangle her, pull out all her teeth, and cut off the ends of her fingers so even if her body was found, no one would be able to identify her.\" He looked stunned. Jackie began to shake while tears spurted from her eyes. \"Phil, is-is that true?\" \"No!\" he thundered. \"The crazy bitch is lying!\" And then he made a huge mistake and whirled around, grabbing my shoulders. Dean went to haul him back, but I was faster. The memory of experiencing everything he intended for Jackie made me merciless, and I laid my right hand on his arm, releasing the hold I had over those unwanted currents in me. Another series of images exploded in my mind, colorless from age, but that wasn\u0027t why I touched him. My vision dimmed as I felt the current surge from me into Phil in less than the time it took Dean to yank him away. Phil fell onto the floor, and after several blinks I saw with satisfaction that he was still convulsing. A few tourists screamed. Jackie sobbed. I felt bad about that, but a few tears now were a far better fate than what Phil had planned for her. \"What happened?\" one of the unfamiliar onlookers demanded. \"He grabbed her, so she Tasered him,\" Dean said gruffly. I didn\u0027t have a Taser, but J.D. moved in front of me, blocking that from view with his huge eight-foot frame. Jackie recovered herself and, with shaking hands, pulled a set of car keys from Phil\u0027s pocket. He didn\u0027t seem to notice, being too busy twitching and pissing himself. No one stopped her as she went out to the parking lot, but Dean followed her after tossing me a grim look. Jackie\u0027s scream moments later made several people walk out, some throwing money on their tables, some not. Jackie must have seen that I was spot-on about what was in the trunk. Raquel came up to me and wearily rubbed her beard. \"You\u0027re in for it now, Frankie.\" I thought she meant I had to cover the lost revenue from the tourists who were beating a hasty retreat. It was my fault that they stiffed their tabs, so I couldn\u0027t blame Raquel, but covering those expenses was worth saving a woman\u0027s life. It was only later, after Jackie sobbingly explained to the police what happened, that I realized the full extent of what Raquel meant. By then, it was too late. Chapter 2 Marty stared in silence as I jumped on the trampoline with more force than was needed. With his four-foot, one-inch height, he was barely as tall as the edge of the trampoline, but his sideburns, wrinkles, and stoutly muscled frame showed he was no child. I looked away from him and focused my attention inward, barely noticing the landscape rising and falling with every jump. When I was high enough, I clasped my knees to my chest in a classic tuck, then quickly twisted into a pike before my feet hit the flexible surface and bounced me upward again. Not tight enough in the tuck! I could almost hear my old trainer shout. That\u0027s a full point deduction, Leila! You\u0027ll never make the team with scores that low. I pushed those memories aside and concentrated on my next move-a barani ball-out. This maneuver was even sloppier than the last, my foot doing an embarrassing slip backward upon landing. Another deduction, I thought automatically, but powered through the last set of somersaults and turntables. No self-respecting judge would give me high marks for those, but they looked impressive so the carnival spectators loved them. This time, instead of landing on the trampoline, I changed direction at the last second and both my feet slammed down on Marty\u0027s shoulders. The velocity plus my weight should\u0027ve brought him to his knees and broken several bones, but Marty stood ramrod-straight. He grabbed my ankles, steadying me with a grip that was firm enough to allow me to stretch to my full height of five-six, arms triumphantly extended over my head. \"And the crowd goes wild,\" Marty said ironically as I bowed. I jumped down once he let go of my ankles. \"Not as many crowds these days. People have too many other things to do than go to traveling carnivals.\" He grunted. \"If Stan had his way, you\u0027d use your newfound celebrity status to help with that.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-2.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
