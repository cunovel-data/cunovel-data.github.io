{"id":99731,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"Thanks for a wonderful afternoon, Maximus,\" I told him. \"See you at lunch tomorrow?\" He leaned against the wall in a casual way. \"No, Oscar or Gabriel will bring you your food.\" \"Sick of me already?\" I teased. His smile remained but his gaze became serious. \"It\u0027s harder to seduce someone when you\u0027re also clearing her plates. That\u0027s why I assigned others to take care of you while you\u0027re here.\" Inwardly I sighed. Despite telling the truth about having a wonderful time, I still hadn\u0027t felt any telltale twinges around Maximus-and I\u0027d tried. I stared at his ass when he walked ahead of me, envisioned my nails digging into that broad back . . . hell, I\u0027d even stolen some looks at his package. Aside from admiring the shape he was in, nothing. I could just imagine Vlad chortling to himself. I wasn\u0027t about to give up, however. Maybe what I needed was some tactile interaction. Thanks to my electrocution issues, I hadn\u0027t been kissed since Johnny Staples in the eighth grade. A kiss was bound to kick-start my libido. I smiled, moistened my lips, and hoped Maximus wasn\u0027t the shy type. He wasn\u0027t. He bent down, his hand curling around my neck, and lowered his mouth onto mine. His lips were cool, full but firm, and he used far more finesse slipping his tongue into my mouth than Johnny Staples had. I kissed him back, glad it was like riding a bike and I hadn\u0027t forgotten how. Our tongues twined together and I had a further flash of gratitude that he didn\u0027t taste like blood. I liked being able to put my arms around someone and be held close, though I was careful not to touch Maximus with my right hand. His little moan when he gripped me to him was nice, too. Glad my years without practice hadn\u0027t made me the world\u0027s worst kisser, and- Aw, hell, this wasn\u0027t working! His large, hard body was pressed to mine and his tongue was doing very enjoyable things in my mouth, but I still didn\u0027t feel a rush of heat. Figures. For years, I\u0027d been frustrated over my forced singlehood, but now that I had means and opportunity in the form of a very willing, very attractive blond vampire, I wasn\u0027t into him. Maybe I should get myself sized for a promise ring. Did they give those to nonbelievers? Or was it a members-only thing? \"Maximus, I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, pulling away from him. \"Too fast?\" he asked thickly. \"Don\u0027t worry, I don\u0027t mind waiting. It\u0027ll take Vlad weeks to gather personal items from all his enemies for you to touch, so we have time.\" Attractive, understanding, and not falling to the floor with a heart attack from the electricity in my touch. I drew in a frustrated breath. Wasn\u0027t he what I\u0027d longed for all those lonely nights? So why wasn\u0027t my pulse speeding up? Why was my reaction to him so damn flat compared to what I\u0027d felt when I was with Vlad? I was so screwed. \"Maximus,\" I began. He put a finger to my lips. \"Don\u0027t. I know that tone, but . . . wait. If you still want to say it after a week, fine, but give me that long before letting another man make a move.\" Wry smile. \"What else do you have to do?\" What else, indeed? Certainly not think about a dangerous vampire who was so sure of himself that he\u0027d set me up with another guy and also practically dared me to sleep with any member of his staff. \"Okay,\" I said, and forced a smile. He kissed me again, and I hoped that I\u0027d feel more this time, but while it was enjoyable, that telltale spark was still missing. \"Good,\" he said when he let me go. \"Then I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\" Chapter 14 I trudged down the staircase at nine o\u0027clock with all the enthusiasm of a condemned prisoner going to the electric chair. This time, I wasn\u0027t wearing a slinky black dress. I was in gray slacks and an olive turtleneck sweater, my black hair twisted into a ponytail, not a speck of makeup, and lips thinned into annoyed slits. Everything about me should\u0027ve screamed \"Do not engage\" to the vampire already waiting in the dining room. Vlad rose when he saw me, which for some reason angered me. Why did he keep pretending to be mannerly? Someone with manners didn\u0027t torture innocent people or offer to pimp out their staff in order to prove a point! Then I gave myself a mental shake. Just because I still felt like crap and was unable to prove him wrong didn\u0027t mean I had the right to spew venom all over him. Sorry, I thought, assuming he was tuned into my thoughts as usual. The sardonic smile that curled his lips when he held out my chair confirmed my suspicions. \"Your date wasn\u0027t everything you\u0027d hoped?\" I sat down with a small sigh. I hated lying and he could read my mind, so what was the point trying to deny it? \"No, but Maximus wants to give it a week, and I agreed.\" Once I was settled at the table, Vlad returned to his chair, again making the simple act of sitting appear commanding. Give him a throne and he\u0027d look right at home. Then again, he probably had one stashed away somewhere. Maximus hadn\u0027t shown me the fourth floor because he said it was \"private.\" I translated that as \"Vlad\u0027s personal territory\" and wondered why he needed the equivalent of an apartment building for his quarters. Or maybe that was where he did all his torturing. I could understand Maximus not wanting to show me that room. \"No, I do my torturing in the dungeon like any other respectable castle owner,\" he said, amusement clear in his voice. \"And the fourth floor isn\u0027t merely mine. My most trusted staff members have their rooms there, too.\" \"You really have a dungeon?\" Talk about old school. \"Of course.\" Spoken as he gestured with two fingers. An attendant appeared, pouring dark red wine into my glass. At least, I hoped it was wine. \"It is.\" With more amusement. \"Aside from its obvious purpose, the wine should assist you in getting a better night\u0027s sleep tonight. It will also help to soothe some of your aches.\" Your ability is so intrusive, I thought, glaring at him. He only smiled and raised his glass in silent salute. I took a small sip of mine, letting the liquid roll around my tongue before swallowing. Hints of violets, black cherry, and . . . smoke. Very nice, I decided, and took a larger sip. Some of the tightness started to leave my shoulders. Vlad watched me, whatever he was thinking hidden behind that enigmatic half smile. I\u0027d dressed down for dinner, but he hadn\u0027t. The rich material of his aubergine shirt made it far more elegant than your average button-down. Lights from the chandelier gleamed off jeweled cuff links, and his charcoal-colored pants fit him so perfectly, it was hard not to stare. His hair was brushed into smooth, dark waves and that eight o\u0027clock shadow hugged his chiseled jawline, making me forget myself long enough drink in his appearance along with my wine.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-21.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
