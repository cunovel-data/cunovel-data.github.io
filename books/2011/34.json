{"id":99744,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"\"I think I\u0027ve got something,\" I said aloud. \"I see two of the vampires from the attack and it looks like they\u0027re getting orders, but I don\u0027t understand the language.\"\n \"I\u0027m fluent in dozens of languages, repeat whatever you hear,\" Vlad directed.\n The other man had spoken rapidly and the language wasn\u0027t easy to replicate, but I gave it my best shot. After I parroted some sentences that may or may not have been accurate, Vlad\u0027s whistle yanked my attention away from the memory.\n \"I believe you\u0027ve found our elusive puppet master.\"\n I disengaged the link to center my attention back on him. \"You understood him? What language was it?\"\n \"Old Novgorod.\" A tight smile twisted his lips. \"I haven\u0027t heard that since I was a boy. Either he is at least as old as I am, or he\u0027s very clever by communicating through a dialect few knew even before it became extinct.\"\n \"What was he saying?\"\n His smile remained, but his expression hardened. \"You were missing a few words, but I heard enough to determine that surveillance equipment in the town alerted them to your presence. Once you were spotted, his men were told that if they couldn\u0027t succeed in returning with you, they were to kill you.\"\n Considering the silver-haired vampire had broken my legs and left me trapped in a burning building, the \"capture or kill\" order didn\u0027t come as a surprise. Still, it didn\u0027t give me the warm fuzzies. Before, I\u0027d wanted to help Vlad catch the mastermind because then I would be safe. Now, I wanted to catch the bastard so he could pay for everything he\u0027d put me through.\n \"Tell me more and you\u0027ll get your vengeance,\" Vlad promised. \"Do you know his name or where he is?\"\n \"No,\" I said, and explained why. Even their surroundings were of no use. The three men had been in small room with wall-to-wall concrete and not much else. Vlad stroked his jaw when I was finished, his expression thoughtful.\n \"Maximus,\" he said at last. \"Find out who the world\u0027s best sketch artist is, and have him or her here by dawn.\"\n Chapter 22\n The other bones didn\u0027t reveal anything significant. Just more images of their owners\u0027 sins and more flashbacks of the distinguished-looking gentleman who spoke Old Novgorod. Vlad left to find the surveillance equipment and to, I assumed, burn the ass off anyone involved with its setup. I kept trying to sort through the deluge of memories to discover more about the people behind the bones, but after several frustrating hours, I called it a day. The truth was that I might be giving myself a headache for nothing. Now that I had a face behind last night\u0027s attack, if the sketch artist panned out and Vlad recognized him . . . checkmate would come tomorrow.\n That left tonight to settle the other issues between us.\n I ate dinner alone in the wood-paneled sitting room that adjoined my new bedroom. Then I stayed there after the plates were cleared away. The modern leather furniture and large flat-screen TV looked out of place next to the antique bookcase containing editions so old, I could barely read the letters on the bindings. Those contrasts in extremes, plus the ancient shield above the fireplace bearing the same dragon design as Vlad\u0027s ring, made me guess where the other door in this room led to. Therefore, when I heard it open, I didn\u0027t turn my head, but stayed on the couch and continued to stare into the crackling orange flames.\n A tall form blinked out of the corner of my eye before I felt warm, strong hands slide down my arms and then the rasp of stubble against my cheek. Despite my resolve to settle a few things first, I couldn\u0027t help but think that the heat seemed to travel from his hands down to a specific place in my body.\n \"Wait,\" I said, but the word came out wispy.\n Dark laughter made my neck tingle where it landed.\n \"How unconvincing. Try again.\"\n I couldn\u0027t stop my eyes from closing when his mouth settled in the same spot where his breath had been. A slow graze of his lips had me exhaling in pleasure, then the sudden firm suction made desire stab me right in the center even as I gasped.\n \"Vlad!\"\n Another chuckle before I felt the dangerously sensual pressure of fangs. Vlad continued to draw on my neck, those sharp teeth grazing my skin without breaking it. My pulse jumped against his mouth as if begging to be bitten, but then I slid off the couch, pivoting to face him.\n He stalked over, his eyes glowing with emerald highlights. Now that I got my first look at him, I saw that his cuffs were undone and the top buttons of his black shirt open, that V of hard flesh entrapping my gaze even as I backed away. The most I\u0027d seen of his skin before was when he rolled up his sleeve to give me his blood. I found myself wondering if his chest had the same crisp dusting of hair as his arms, or if the hint of darkness I glimpsed was from the firelight\u0027s shifting shadows.\n His teeth bared in something too predatory to be called a smile. \"You\u0027ll soon find out.\"\n I stretched out my hands as if to ward him off. \"Not yet. I want to know what your end game is first.\"\n Another flash of teeth, this time showing his fangs. \"To have you screaming my name within the hour.\"\n Those words made my pulse pound so strongly that my neck felt like it vibrated. His gaze flicked there and then he reached me in the next stride, catching my hands and using them to pull me closer. Excitement shot through me as he pressed our bodies together, his arms a sensual cage around me. When I felt something hard pulsing against my belly, lust burst forth with enough strength to shove my other concerns aside. I wanted to touch him there. Taste him. Feel him so deep inside me that I screamed out his name just like he promised-\n \"Not until you tell me the catch to sleeping with you,\" I managed before those cravings washed away all rational thought.\n He\u0027d already slipped his hands under my sweater and unhooked my bra, but at that, he paused.\n \"The catch?\"\n My rapid breathing made the words come out jumbled. \"Yes, the catch, cost, downside, or thing that will make me say, \u0027Oh, shit\u0027 tomorrow when it\u0027s too late. Tell me now.\"\n He pulled back to stare at me in the strangest way, like he was amused but also debating whether to ignore me and finish taking off my bra.\n \"Ah, that catch,\" he said at last. \"To start, if you betray me with another man, I\u0027ll burn him to death in front of you.\"\n I\u0027d expected something like that, but I wasn\u0027t about to agree without conditions. \"Only if you hold yourself to the same standard, and don\u0027t pull any of that \u0027You\u0027re mine\u0027 garbage if things don\u0027t work out between us.\"\n His hands left my back to weave in my hair. Then he leaned down until his face was very close to mine. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-34.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: \n After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
