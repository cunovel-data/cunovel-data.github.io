It wasn\u0027t until after I sat down that he responded to my mental gauntlet.\n \"If your goal is to dissuade me from seducing you, taunting me with promises of failure won\u0027t work.\" He settled himself into his chair with an easy, arrogant elegance. \"I enjoy challenges, but I don\u0027t think it will be long until you\u0027re in my bed.\"\n I\u0027d been in the process of unfolding my napkin, but at that, I froze. He did not just talk about me with the same casualness as a dessert he\u0027d eventually get around to eating.\n Out loud, I said, \"Ooh, someone\u0027s got an ego.\"\n He picked up his wineglass, taking a sip before replying. \"It\u0027s not ego, I\u0027m used to women chasing me. With your age and inexperience, you normally wouldn\u0027t stand a chance. But your abilities cut a swath of darkness through all that youth and innocence, making you quite intriguing.\"\n \"Lucky me,\" I gritted out, still steaming at his presumption.\n Vlad smiled, as threatening and enticing as a whip curled around a champagne bottle. \"Yes. People frequently bore me, sometimes amuse me, most often irritate me, but rarely intrigue me. You do, which is why I\u0027ll enjoy having you as a lover.\"\n I couldn\u0027t decide which was more insulting-him lumping me together with women who had \"chased\" him, or his continued conviction that I\u0027d fall into bed with him. I glanced at the room with its cathedral-like ceiling, barbarically gorgeous chandelier, and seating for two dozen.\n \"No wonder you need such a huge house. Your overconfidence wouldn\u0027t fit in anything smaller.\"\n He shrugged. \"Confident I might be, but it\u0027s not without cause. You think I\u0027m dangerous and you\u0027re angry at me over Marty, but even before your vision, I could tell you wanted me.\"\n \"You\u0027re hot, big deal,\" I shot back, refusing to let his knowledge of my most intimate thoughts daunt me. \"I\u0027m attracted to a lot of hot guys. If Chris Hemsworth were here, I\u0027d light him up like a firecracker with how fast I\u0027d jump on him.\"\n \"And that would kill him,\" Vlad noted.\n \"Him and everyone else with a heartbeat, which is why I couldn\u0027t date after the accident. I could\u0027ve branched out to vampires, but Marty told me to avoid them because he was worried they\u0027d try to use me for my power.\" And he was right, I thought emphatically before going on. \"Now I\u0027m thrown together with an attractive man I can\u0027t kill, and you feel special because I responded like any normal, healthy woman would?\"\n I leaned back with a huff. \"Give me a break. Another reasonably good-looking dead guy would rev my engine, too, so don\u0027t break your arm patting yourself on the back.\"\n \"You\u0027re deluding yourself, but as I told you, I don\u0027t run away from challenges,\" Vlad said, stroking the tight stubble along his jaw. I refused to follow the movement; staring at his mouth would only lead to more thoughts of that vision.\n \"Let\u0027s put it to the test,\" he went on. \"Maximus!\"\n He hadn\u0027t raised his voice, but the blond vampire appeared almost instantly.\n \"Yes?\"\n \"He\u0027s just one of many men available for you to choose from,\" Vlad stated with an arch smile. \"All muscular, virile, single, and good for at least an hour before you\u0027d electrocute them into oblivion.\"\n I had a sense of where this was going, and I squirmed in my chair. Drop it, I thought warningly.\n He ignored that, gesturing to me with his wineglass. \"Now look at our guest, Maximus. Full lips, ice blue eyes, long black hair, and strong, shapely body. Beautiful, isn\u0027t she? So beautiful I\u0027m confident you and several others in this house would like to f**k her, yes?\"\n I gasped at his bluntness. Maximus blinked, his gaze flicking to me and then to Vlad. \"Is this a trick question?\"\n \"Not at all,\" Vlad said, eyeing him with cool appraisal. \"For the length of Leila\u0027s stay, all of my people are free to pursue her, if she\u0027s agreeable. Or, if she wants to skip the preliminaries and f**k one of you right now, that is allowable as well.\"\n I could feel the heat rise to my face, but I wasn\u0027t sure if it was embarrassment or fury. Maximus seemed at turns uneasy and interested, like he didn\u0027t know whether to leave in case I was about to electrocute everyone in my rage, or stay and see if I demanded that he whip out his c**k and get started.\n \"I have a question,\" I said, my tone bright although I was still seething inside. \"Who do I have to screw to get any dinner around here? You have all these shiny plates but no food. It\u0027s like you\u0027re a terrible tease.\"\n A little smile played about Vlad\u0027s lips. \"Sorry, Maximus. Seems our guest has chosen other cravings.\"\n \"Or maybe I\u0027m not into him or anyone else being ordered to service me as if they\u0027re sex slaves,\" I countered.\n \"He\u0027s not ordering me; he\u0027s telling me the normal rules concerning guests don\u0027t apply to you, if I\u0027m interested.\"\n Maximus stared at me as he spoke, and he\u0027d dropped the formal vernacular he\u0027d used in our prior conversations. Guess with this topic, formalities were redundant.\n Then he looked at Vlad. \"You want her. Why are you offering us this chance?\"\n \"Because she\u0027s wrong about me,\" Vlad said with that infuriating sureness, \"and she needs to realize that. Besides, in the unlikely event that she\u0027s right, then she\u0027s not worth my time.\"\n I threw my napkin on the table and stood. \"I\u0027m done listening to this.\"\n Maximus touched my arm. \"Please, wait. I am interested. Before anyone else jumps into the equation, I want a chance.\" A hint of green flickered in his dark gray eyes. \"Not to be too blunt, but working with Vlad doesn\u0027t leave much time for meeting women. Besides, you\u0027re beautiful, ballsy, and your abilities fascinate me. So if you\u0027re interested, too, I\u0027d say yes, and it would have nothing to do with being ordered.\"\n My gaze flew to Vlad, who continued to stroke his jaw in relaxed contemplation. You smug bastard, I thought, and then turned my attention to Maximus, torn between my anger over Vlad\u0027s ruthless manipulation and awkwardness because Maximus did seem genuine in his offer.\n \"It doesn\u0027t have to be sex tonight or nothing,\" Maximus went on. \"Say you\u0027ll let me show you around the house tomorrow.\"\n Again I looked at Vlad, but his brow rose as if daring me to decline. I cursed. This was what I\u0027d wanted-an attractive, nondangerous man I couldn\u0027t easily kill asking me out. Vlad might be convinced that I held a special attraction for him, but I\u0027d prove him wrong and have fun doing it.\n \"A tour sounds great,\" I told Maximus, sitting down again. \"How about one p.m. tomorrow, or is that too early for you?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-19.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: \n After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
