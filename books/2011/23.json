Instead, he led me down a staircase located behind the winter garden that ended in an enclosed stone hallway. \"What else is down here?\" I asked to break the silent standoff between us. \"Aside from the gymnasium, there are the lower kitchens, laundry rooms, servants\u0027 entrance, storage facilities, swimming pool, root cellars, and humans\u0027 living quarters.\" I did look at him then. In shock. \"You keep your live-in blood donors in the basement?\" \"It\u0027s a very nice basement. Much better than the dungeons. Those tend to be quite cold in winter.\" I couldn\u0027t tell if he was serious. He might indeed think nothing of housing his blood donors next to his root cellars, or he might find it hilarious to let me believe that. \"I\u0027d love to meet them one day,\" was what I said. His lips twitched. \"Would you, or are you trying to discover if they\u0027re shivering in a dark room even now?\" \"I never said that,\" I muttered. He stopped walking, but his hand remained on my arm. \"I don\u0027t shirk my responsibilities, and everyone here is a member of my line directly or indirectly. Their living quarters contain normal bedrooms, and you are welcome to see that for yourself.\" \"Thanks,\" I said, adding, \"I didn\u0027t really think you kept them housed in tiny underground cellars.\" His mouth quirked. \"You gave it fifty-fifty odds.\" \"Well, you do have an active dungeon,\" I pointed out. He laughed, the sound rolling over me more than once with the echoes in the enclosed hallway. His laughter was so unique-part amused growl, part purr, and all self-assured male. Its effect on me was tangible, turning up my own lips and making me step closer to him before I realized what I was doing. Emerald flared in his gaze and his fingers tightened on my arm. A throb started inside me, low but unmistakable, making my mouth go dry and my pulse begin to speed up. One more step would have our bodies touching, we were standing that close. But that single step would probably seal my vision into reality. Don\u0027t let it happen, Marty had urged me. He\u0027ll break your heart and ruin your life . . . I took not one but two steps backward, slipping my arm out from Vlad\u0027s grasp. He let me go without trying to stop me, and I expelled the breath I hadn\u0027t realized I\u0027d been holding. Anxious to defuse the unspoken tension, I pointed at a door with stone ivies carved around the frame. \"What\u0027s in there?\" \"The entrance to the chapel,\" he replied. I let out a nervous laugh. \"Maximus told me this place used to be a monastery, but you actually kept the chapel?\" \"No, it was destroyed,\" he said, not commenting on my edginess or the reason behind it. \"I had this one rebuilt on the ruins of the old citadel tower. Would you like to see it?\" \"No thanks,\" I said at once. \"How emphatic. Not the religious type?\" \"No, why? Don\u0027t tell me you believe in God?\" \"Many vampires do. The story of our origin states that the mark of Cain was God turning him into the first vampire by forcing him to drink blood as penance for murdering his brother.\" Then he leaned forward and his voice dropped to almost a whisper. \"Surprised? Is it impossible to believe that I think a day will come where I\u0027ll be held accountable for each life I\u0027ve taken, every drop of blood I\u0027ve spilled . . . and yet I continue to do whatever is necessary to keep my people safe?\" I swallowed, as unnerved by that thought as I was by his nearness. Vlad was such a study in extremes that I couldn\u0027t figure out if he was being rhetorical or serious, but maybe that was for the best. It was easier to walk away when I wasn\u0027t being pulled further into his intriguing complexities. He still stood very close. Without thinking, I rubbed the place on my arm where his hand had been. The spot felt oddly barren now. Ridiculous, I told myself. You came down here to unload tension. Quit stockpiling more of it with your idiocy. His lips curled as he glanced at my arm. He\u0027d heard that, of course. How I wished I could shut him out of my mind. \"Is the gym far?\" He inclined his head toward a door on the opposite wall. \"Right there.\" We\u0027d been standing only a dozen feet away and he hadn\u0027t said a word? I would\u0027ve demanded to know what sort of game he was playing, except I didn\u0027t think he was playing one. Instead, as his brow rose in silent challenge, I wondered if he was doing something worse-intensifying his pursuit of me. If so, then the next move was mine, and with my attraction to him growing, I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d choose wisely. Chapter 15 The gym turned out to be filled with state-of-the-art equipment. Good for whoever lived here, but useless for me. However, it had a large exercise mat, some free weights, and a knotted rope suspended from the high ceiling. I made the most out of those three things, forcing my aching body through a series of routines I\u0027d used when I was training for competition. I had the room to myself for the first two hours, then I heard voices right before the door banged open. A group of twenty-somethings entered, chatting in what I now recognized as Romanian. They stopped short when they noticed me dangling from the rope upside down, my black hair fanning out underneath me. \"Hi,\" I said, feeling self-conscious as I realized that I probably looked strange. \"Any of you speak English?\" \"Most of us,\" a husky, curly-haired guy replied, to other murmurs of assent. He started to grin. \"What are you doing?\" \"Sit-ups,\" I said, demonstrating by hoisting myself up until my face touched my thigh. \"Works more muscles this way.\" \"I bet it does,\" he said, still staring at me. I uncoiled the rope from around my leg and climbed down. My abs had been killing me anyway. Once I was back on the ground, I smiled at the group. \"I\u0027m Leila,\" I said, using my real name because everyone else here called me that. I knew the moment they saw the scar. A collective wince seemed to ripple over the group, though it took longer for some of the guys since they checked out my body before getting to my face. I kept my smile in place, used to this reaction. \"It\u0027s from an accident when I was a kid,\" I said by way of explanation. If I didn\u0027t offer any information, people would just ask. That I was also used to. \"Oh, how awful,\" a pretty, petite, strawberry-blond girl said in heavily accented English. \"Glad you, uh, healed up,\" the curly-haired guy replied awkwardly. \"Nice to meet you. I\u0027m Ben, and as you can tell from my accent, I\u0027m American, too. This is Joe, Damon, Tom, Angie, Sandra, and Kate, but her English isn\u0027t good so she\u0027ll probably just grunt at you.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-23.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
