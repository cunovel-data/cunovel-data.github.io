Instead, his actions resulted in you nearly burning to death. Did you think I\u0027d let him off with a tongue-lashing?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d go pole-happy on him,\" I countered, trying to keep my teeth from chattering because that would take away from my hard tone. \"He\u0027d been fighting off three vampires at the time, which was pretty damn impressive. No wonder he didn\u0027t notice what Silver Hair did to me.\"\n Vlad\u0027s hands sparked. Maximus muttered, \"Stop helping.\"\n \"I am the Master of my line.\" Vlad enunciated each word as though I suddenly had difficulty understanding English. \"No matter how Maximus\u0027s fighting skills may have impressed you, how I punish one of my people for failing me doesn\u0027t concern you.\"\n My temper snapped. I was supposed to be his girlfriend, not a lackey so he did not just pull the Big Bad Vampire card on me!\n \"Ooh, you told me,\" I mocked, sketching a bow. \"You\u0027re right, I should\u0027ve have dreamed of interfering. In fact, however long you sentence Maximus to that pole, I\u0027ll be sure to think about how wrong I was while sleeping alone!\"\n \"Don\u0027t use abstinence as blackmail,\" he said curtly. \"It won\u0027t work, and we agreed not to play games with each other.\"\n I marched over, feeling my hand tingle with angry currents.\n \"This isn\u0027t blackmail. It\u0027s me being seriously pissed over you torturing Maximus for something that wasn\u0027t his fault. You do what you have to do, Vlad, I can\u0027t stop you. But then I\u0027ll do what I have to do.\"\n Vlad glanced down, his expression changing from irritated obstinacy to concern.\n \"Leila, your hand.\"\n I looked and saw a sliver of electricity extending from it like a glittering icicle. I fisted my hand, taking a deep breath as I attempted to stuff my power back inside.\n \"It\u0027s fine,\" I muttered. \"It happened before; I whipped a current across Silver Hair\u0027s back when I wasn\u0027t close enough to grab him. Maybe drinking your blood amped up my voltage.\"\n Vlad stared at my hand before casting a speculative look at Maximus. Then he returned his attention to me. And smiled.\n \"What?\" I asked warily, recognizing his charming \"I\u0027m going to do something awful\" expression.\n \"Congratulations, Maximus. Leila has won you a reprieve from impalement.\" His smile widened. \"And I know just the way you can thank her for it.\"\n Maximus stood across from me in the huge hallway, fully dressed now. His features were stoic, but if I were him, I\u0027d be cursing me up one side and down the other. I hoped this hurt less than a pole through the torso, but since Vlad had thought of it, probably not.\n \"Sorry,\" I said for the dozenth time. Then I focused on the knife he held and aimed as much electricity toward it as I could. A pure white current shot out of my hand, whipping across his wrist and leaving an ugly burn. His whole body stiffened, which had been his usual reaction, but this time, Maximus also took a step backward. Still, he didn\u0027t drop the knife.\n \"Better,\" Vlad said in an approving tone. \"With more practice, you\u0027ll be able to do this.\"\n Then he snapped the whip he held. It flashed out too fast for me to follow with my gaze, but the knife in Maximus\u0027s hand was suddenly several feet away on the floor.\n Vlad turned to me. \"I could take his hand off if I wanted to, and this is an ordinary leather whip. You have the ability to channel one made of pure electrical energy. Wielded properly, you could cut someone in half, human or vampire.\"\n I doubted that. Vampires healed too fast for my abilities to be lethal unless I maintained contact with my right hand for at least an hour. Case in point: The burn on Maximus\u0027s wrist had already vanished, and his posture was now as straight as ever.\n Vlad strode over, scowling. \"If you don\u0027t believe you can do it, then you won\u0027t do it. Do you think my control over fire appeared the first time I manifested a flame? No. I honed my abilities until I turned them into the weapon they are today.\"\n \"Do you two need a minute alone?\" Maximus grumbled.\n Vlad ignored him, grasping my hand and holding it up as if I\u0027d never seen it before.\n \"This could be a formidable weapon. You\u0027ve only ever practiced suppressing your power, but where has that gotten you? Stop trying to get rid of it and bend it to your will instead.\"\n \"What if I don\u0027t want my power to get any stronger?\" Exhaustion from continually manifesting currents made my voice harsh. \"Power might be the ultimate status symbol for vampires, but I never wanted these abilities to begin with. They\u0027ve shattered my life more than once and without drinking vampire blood, they\u0027d kill me. I want less power, not more.\"\n \"You want to survive, don\u0027t you?\" he countered mercilessly. \"As you are, most vampires could overcome you. Right now you hope that whoever ordered your kidnapping hasn\u0027t spread word of your psychic abilities, but if he has, you\u0027ll be very popular in the undead world. If that happens, you can stay helpless, relying on my protection forever, or learn how to defend yourself. Your choice.\"\n Damn him for knowing the right buttons to push. Growing my abilities might have emotional and physical drawbacks, but they beat being helpless against another kidnapping attempt.\n \"Fine,\" I said after a long pause. \"I\u0027ll hone my power into the best weapon it can be.\"\n Vlad traced the path of my scar from my hand all the way up to my face. His voice lowered. \"First you need to let go of your guilt over your mother\u0027s death. It\u0027s crippling you.\"\n The words hit me like a slap. \"You have no right,\" I gasped, knocking his hand away. \"I never told you about that, so you stole it from my mind! Do I bring up that day by the river to you? No, because you didn\u0027t share it with me of your own free will, so I leave it alone. Leave this alone, Vlad. I mean it.\"\n \"I\u0027m gonna go,\" Maximus muttered, slinking away from us.\n I ignored him, focused on the vampire in front of me. Vlad stared back, impenitent and uncompromising.\n \"You don\u0027t need to bring up that day by the river because I dealt with my guilt a long time ago. But you\u0027re right. You didn\u0027t share this with me of your own free will, so I won\u0027t mention it again . . . unless you continue to let it handicap you.\"\n Something boiled over in me at that. I could actually feel the current pulsing under my skin as if begging to be freed.\n \"I\u0027ll show you handicapped,\" I spat, and snapped my right hand at the nearest statue-a life-sized male warrior. A long, white current rocketed from my skin, lashing the statue\u0027s neck. Some part of me must\u0027ve held back with Maximus before, because this time, the current cut all the way through. The marble head smashed onto the floor, breaking into several pieces. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-40.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: \n After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
