He kept sidestepping me with that damn vampiric speed until it looked like we were engaged in some sort of strange dance.\n \"Fine, I\u0027ll talk to you like this,\" I snapped to Vlad, Marty still in between us. \"You promised you wouldn\u0027t hurt him, but you had him impaled. Tell me why I shouldn\u0027t break our deal right now, and threatening me with death isn\u0027t good enough. Been there, done that a thousand times, remember?\" My lip curled. \"Besides, you need me and we both know it.\"\n Vlad smiled with luxuriant coldness, coming closer. \"Calling me a name I detest and accusing me of madness and lying. I\u0027ve killed people for less, but you\u0027re right. I do need you. So let\u0027s settle the first two issues.\"\n Marty was suddenly gone. Vlad had thrown him aside before I\u0027d even seen him move. A thud by the stone staircase told me where he\u0027d ended up, but when I started to go to him, Vlad grasped my arm, his coppery green gaze boring into mine. My heart skipped a beat, but I didn\u0027t flinch. I wouldn\u0027t give him the satisfaction.\n \"What now?\" I asked with open challenge.\n His brow arched. \"This,\" he replied, and shoved a small, hard object into my right hand.\n Chapter 11\n Images exploded across my mind, but unlike most impressions, they weren\u0027t through the perspective of just one person. They came from multiple people.\n First, I relived the memory of an older man being cornered by soldiers. They held him down, jeering, as one of them cut away all the skin on the man\u0027s face before slitting his throat. The next memory was even more brutal-a burning hot coal used to put out a young man\u0027s eyes before he was buried alive. The third was of an even younger man who bore a striking resemblance to Vlad being ambushed and then stabbed to death inside a church. The last was that young man\u0027s murderer, pleading to no avail, as a dirty and blood-streaked Vlad shoved a long wooden pole through his midsection, then hoisted him aloft and sat watching the entire two days it took the man to die.\n When reality at last replaced those grisly images, I found myself backed into a wall, Vlad\u0027s grip on my arms the only thing holding me upright. His gaze was hooded, lean face utterly expressionless as he looked at me. Phantom pains still lingered in various parts of my body, but they faded until only a dull ache from clutching whatever Vlad had given me remained.\n I opened my hand, glancing down to see a thick gold ring with a dragon emblazoned across the wide, flat stone-the same ring each of those men had been wearing when they were killed. It was so filled with the essences from its former owners\u0027 murders that I half expected it to start dripping blood.\n The deaths I\u0027d been forced to relive had conveyed more than the horror of knowing what it felt like to have my face cut off, which had been a new one even for me. I\u0027d also gotten a glimpse into the murdered men themselves. From that, I knew all but the last of them had been members of Vlad\u0027s family, and now I also knew exactly who held me against the smooth stone wall.\n Shock made my voice come out hoarse. \"You\u0027re Vladislav Basarab Dracul, former voivode of Wallachia, but over five hundred years ago, they used to call you Tepesh. The Impaler.\"\n Vlad didn\u0027t blink. \"They still do,\" he replied in a caressingly lethal voice, and then released me.\n I was glad my legs managed to hold me so I didn\u0027t slump to the ground. Falling before Vlad\u0027s feet would be cliche in the extreme, even if he was the real Vlad.\n I glanced at Marty. He was still by the staircase, but he seemed okay. Maximus was there, too. From the other vampire\u0027s grip on his shoulder, he\u0027d been keeping Marty from interfering.\n \"Could you hear what I experienced from touching that ring?\" I asked, unable to contain a shiver at the memory.\n \"Yes and no.\" His lips twisted into a humorless smile. \"When you utilize your power, your mind is locked behind an impenetrable wall. But when you\u0027re finished, you think about what you saw, and I hear that.\"\n I tried to chase away any remaining thoughts of those murders, which was easier to do when I focused on Marty.\n \"Okay, now I know you\u0027re not suffering under a delusion from too much role-playing.\" The last of that trembling left my limbs and I took a step toward him, my voice sharpening. \"It doesn\u0027t excuse you from breaking your word not to harm Marty.\"\n Vlad folded his arms across his chest, drawing my attention to the dark stains on his shirt that smelled like one of Marty\u0027s foul-tasting shakes.\n \"No, I promised not to harm you,\" he countered. \"I only promised to keep him alive, which I have. But though it never occurred to you that Marty might have been in collusion with the vampires who kidnapped you, the thought did occur to me.\"\n My mouth dropped. \"No. Marty wouldn\u0027t do such a thing.\"\n \"Thanks, kid,\" he muttered from across the room.\n \"I believe that now,\" Vlad said, glancing at Marty without the slightest hint of remorse, \"but I wasn\u0027t about to take a stranger at his word.\"\n His expression hardened even more. \"I come from a line of princes who all have one thing in common: They were murdered. I\u0027ve been surrounded by death, betrayal, and power coups for hundreds of years, yet I\u0027ve survived and kept my people safe by being smarter and more ruthless than my enemies. What I did may disgust you, but only the naive or the foolish would have trusted Marty on his word alone, and I am neither.\"\n He came toward me, and once again, I fought the urge to back away. Vlad might have kept his promise in the strictest sense of the word, but torturing Marty on the mere chance that he might have been involved with my kidnapping also proved that Vlad was one of coldest people I\u0027d ever met.\n Then again, after the glimpses I\u0027d seen of his past, not to mention what I\u0027d seen of him since we met, I was the naive fool for expecting anything different.\n He stopped when he was only inches away, still nailing me with that hard, copper-colored stare. Then he held out his hand.\n \"My ring.\"\n I put it in his palm, forgetting to switch it to my left hand before touching him. A current sizzled into him with the contact, which I expected, but I didn\u0027t expect what came next.\n The gothic hall vanished, replaced by the hazy cocoon of midnight-green drapes encircling the bed I was on. I wound my hand into the thick fabric while a moan left my lips, sharpening into a cry at the incredible pleasure shooting through me. My grip on the drapes tightened as I writhed under the erotic combination of wet, deep strokes and lightly chafing stubble against my most sensitive flesh.\n \"Please,\" I gasped.\n Vlad lifted his head, his hair like dark silk against my thighs and his gaze lit up with emerald. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-17.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: \n After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
