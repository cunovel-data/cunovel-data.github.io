{"id":99728,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\"No,\" he said throatily. \"More.\" And he lowered his mouth again.\\n\\n Vlad\u0027s face crystallized in front of me, but instead of green drapes all around us, we were back in the hall and he was staring down at me, frowning.\\n\\n \"I know you caught a glimpse of something when you touched me. Your mind went silent. Tell me what it was.\"\\n\\n My cheeks flamed with heat. At the same time, disbelief washed over me, covering the remains of pleasure more intense than I\u0027d ever experienced while masturbating. That hadn\u0027t been a vision of him with another woman, yet still, denial screeched across my mind.\\n\\n No. Not me and Vlad like . . . like that!\\n\\n His frown cleared, replaced by a brow going up. Damn his mind reading. Think of something else! I mentally screamed, avoiding his stare. ANYthing else!\\n\\n I no longer looked at Vlad, but I could almost feel his gaze roving over me, noting my newly tight ni**les, accelerated heartbeat, and probably picking up on that damn lingering throb between my legs, too.\\n\\n \"Not surprising,\" he said at last, his voice thicker with things I didn\u0027t want to name. \"I predicted the same thing myself.\"\\n\\n My cheeks continued to heat until I expected them to burst into flames like his hands. I brushed past Vlad and headed for the staircase, not daring to look at Marty, either. How could I? I\u0027d just gotten a glimpse into a future where I was in bed with the man who\u0027d tortured him.\\n\\n \"Nothing\u0027s set in stone. I\u0027ve changed my premonitions before,\" I muttered, both to Vlad and myself. Still, I took the stairs two at a time.\\n\\n Chapter 12\\n\\n An hour later, Marty opened my bedroom door without knocking. He\u0027d changed out of the torn, bloody clothes and had taken a shower, from the damp look to his hair. I was sitting cross-legged in bed, trying without success to pretend I\u0027d misunderstood the image I\u0027d glimpsed. Yeah, right. Because Vlad had been between my legs looking for a set of keys he\u0027d lost.\\n\\n \"Frankie?\" Marty said gruffly. \"I don\u0027t wanna bother you, but I don\u0027t have long to talk.\"\\n\\n \"Why? What\u0027s going on?\" I asked at once, leaping up.\\n\\n Marty shut the door behind him, scratching one of his long, bushy black sideburns. \"I\u0027m leaving for a scouting mission.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t ask, Scouting for what? \"Vlad might not even be right,\" I muttered. \"Maybe no one told Jackal and the others to snatch me up. Maybe they thought of it all by themselves.\"\\n\\n \"They didn\u0027t,\" Marty replied, grimness clear in each syllable. \"That vampire from the hotel, Shrapnel, spent the whole plane ride grilling the redhead who took you-and he was creative. But that was nothing compared to what Vlad did once we got here. Next to that, I got off easy. They didn\u0027t act alone. They were sent after you, but they didn\u0027t know by whom. All they had was a phone number and a big deposit in their bank account with promises of more if you gave them the goods on Vlad.\"\\n\\n I sighed. I hadn\u0027t really thought this would be over so quickly, but I\u0027d hoped. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Marty.\" I gestured at his chest, wanting to cry at what he\u0027d been through. \"He shouldn\u0027t have hurt you.\"\\n\\n Marty snorted. \"I\u0027m happy to be alive. You probably guessed that I tailed you from Gibsonton, waiting until there were fewer vampires guarding you. When I realized it was Vlad I attacked, I thought I was done for. The only reason I\u0027m not toes-up is because you made him promise not to kill me. I\u0027d heard that he holds to his word. Never thought to find out personally.\"\\n\\n I managed a limp smile. \"Since I\u0027ll be spending time with him looking for this mysterious puppet master, is there anything else I should know about Vlad?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Marty\u0027s expression became hard. \"What you saw in that last vision . . . don\u0027t let it happen.\"\\n\\n I closed my eyes, feeling my cheeks warm again. So Marty had figured out what I\u0027d glimpsed, too. Not a shock; he was a vampire, and I\u0027d been anything but suave in my reaction.\\n\\n \"Marty,\" I began.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t care if it was someone else,\" he cut me off. \"This isn\u0027t about your inexperience with men.\"\\n\\n \"Announce that to everyone, why don\u0027t you!\" I hissed, my eyes flying open. With how well vampires could hear, he may as well have tattooed a big V onto my forehead.\\n\\n He waved a hand impatiently. \"You\u0027re missing the point. Vlad isn\u0027t your typical vampire. We\u0027re all ruthless at one time or another, but he\u0027s in a class by himself. You let yourself get involved with him, he\u0027ll rip your heart out and destroy your life, and if I didn\u0027t love you like the daughter I used to have, I wouldn\u0027t say this when I know damn well that he\u0027s listening.\"\\n\\n The raw pain in his voice took away my embarrassment.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry.\" I forced myself to sound nonchalant. \"I know how dangerous he is and I don\u0027t want to get involved with him. I must\u0027ve had a case of temporary insanity because he\u0027s immune to the electricity in my touch.\" A shrug. \"I\u0027ll get over it.\"\\n\\n Marty chucked me on the hip. \"That\u0027s my girl. I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ll be gone, but you watch your back.\"\\n\\n \"I will,\" I promised Marty. \"When do you leave?\"\\n\\n Marty sighed. \"Now. Give me a hug, kid. Love you.\"\\n\\n I knelt down and wrapped my arms around him, careful not to touch him with my right hand.\\n\\n \"Love you,\" I whispered. \"You watch your back, too, Marty. Don\u0027t you dare let yourself get killed.\"\\n\\n He laughed a trifle grimly. \"I\u0027ll try not to.\"\\n\\n At nine o\u0027clock on the dot, I came down the staircase. I\u0027d considered refusing to join Vlad for dinner after what he did to Marty-among other reasons why I didn\u0027t want to see him-but avoiding him would be pointless. We had to work together to find out who\u0027d ordered my kidnapping. I wasn\u0027t about to let that person get off the hook.\\n\\n Besides, I\u0027d gotten over my embarrassment for my naughty vision about Vlad-and for Marty trumpeting the news of my inexperience for every vampire to hear. Was I supposed to be ashamed for valuing other people\u0027s lives over my own needs? I wasn\u0027t that coldhearted and ruthless.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t say the same about the vampire who rose when I entered the dining room, his expression showing a flicker of surprise as he took in my appearance. To show that I wasn\u0027t suffering from damaged modesty, I\u0027d changed into a strapless black dress, the tight fit clinging to curves honed by countless hours of gymnastics. My normally straight black hair now had waves of curls in it, and the red lipstick and smoky eye makeup looked good against my lightly tanned face.\\n\\n That\u0027s right, Voivode, I thought as his gaze swept over me a second time. I might be scarred, but I\u0027m still tasty-looking, aren\u0027t I? Too bad you\u0027re not getting any of this no matter what that vision showed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-18.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
