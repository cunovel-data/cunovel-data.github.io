You should contact them soon so they don\u0027t worry and report you missing.\" I cleared my throat. This was an uncomfortable topic to discuss in front of Jillian, even though she seemed oblivious to us at the moment. \"Not a problem. My dad and I only speak every couple months, and my sister Gretchen and I talk even less.\" An inner hollowness spread with those words. My dad had been deployed for much of my childhood, so our relationship had always been more of a long-distance one, but Gretchen and I used to be close. All that changed the day my mother died. We hadn\u0027t spoken since my aunt\u0027s funeral a year ago, and that conversation had been bitter. Vlad\u0027s smile was gone, his expression now flickering between regret and cynicism. \"Sometimes families bring no peace. On many occasions, my younger brother tried to kill me. Once, he thought he\u0027d succeeded, but I was past mortal death by then.\" His mouth twisted. \"Despite this, when Radu died, I mourned him. Family is always irreplaceable, even when they\u0027re also irreconcilable.\" Irreplaceable. Yes, that summed up my mother. My aunt Brenda, too. She\u0027d taken over raising me and Gretchen after my mother\u0027s death so we wouldn\u0027t have to move all over the world following my father\u0027s most recent transfer orders. Aunt Brenda had also been the one to break the news to my dad that something very strange had happened when my damaged nerves regenerated and my whole body began giving off an electrical charge. I shook my head as if that would clear the memories away. \"That man you said that picture reminded you of, the one who\u0027s dead. Could he have a relative who looked like him?\" One with a grudge against you? I mentally added. \"He has no biological family left alive.\" \"Are you sure?\" Men fathered secret babies all the time- \"He\u0027d been a vampire for over a hundred years when he died; it was impossible for him to father children,\" Vlad stated. I glanced at Jillian to see if the word vampire freaked her, but she still seemed to be insulated in her happy place. \"Well, what if he didn\u0027t die? The man who ordered an attack on you just happens to resemble a vampire you used to know. What if he\u0027s still alive and-\" \"He\u0027s not.\" Vlad\u0027s smile was chillingly pleasant. \"Mihaly Szilagyi was the first person I ever burned to death.\" Jillian retired to one of the guest rooms. Vlad wanted her to stay for the next couple days in case I discovered any other pertinent details on the still-nameless puppet master. But though I\u0027d spent the afternoon sifting through a flood of memories from the charred remains, all I\u0027d gotten so far was a funky-looking ring the puppet master wore. And a headache. Vlad had left me alone to concentrate-and to help Shrapnel do terrible things to Jackal while asking him if he recognized the man in the drawing, no doubt. I hadn\u0027t seen Maximus since this morning so I had no idea what he was up to. I wished I could take some headache pills and lie down, but I went to the basement level of the house instead. With the chaos of the past two days, I\u0027d never gotten a chance to thank Ben for calling Vlad when the club was attacked. Without that, Vlad might not have arrived in time, and I\u0027d be burned crispy. When I went into the kitchen, however, no one was there even though it was close to dinnertime. Curious, I followed the sounds of conversation farther down the hall, coming at last to a large, open lounge area. Ben, Joe, Damon, Kate, and several others were lined up in front of one of the tall windows that, to my surprise, showed trees in the background. Not all of the basement must be underground, but since the house was on a steep hill I supposed that explained it. Sandra sat on the couch, flipping through a magazine, but she smiled when she looked up and noticed me. \"Leila!\" Ben left the window at once. \"Hey, girl!\" Soon I was surrounded as the rest of them abandoned their places, too. How happy everyone acted to see me reminded me of the camaraderie the carnies had with each other. I didn\u0027t know these people very well, but they\u0027d clearly accepted me as one of their own. I was so touched, if I wouldn\u0027t have electrocuted them en masse, I would\u0027ve tried for a group hug. \"I\u0027m fine, really,\" I said for the third time. \"And Ben, thank you so much for calling Vlad and telling him about the attack. He got to me just in time.\" Ben looked abashed. \"I didn\u0027t know you were trapped in there. I called Vlad because I was worried about my own ass.\" Sandra elbowed him. \"Yet you thought to call. We were too panicked to do that. This is why Vlad rewarded you.\" \"He did?\" He hadn\u0027t mentioned that. \"Hell yes, he did. Ben will be getting made in the next year!\" Joe crowed, thumping Ben on the back. Maybe I was losing something in the Romanian-to-English translation. \"Made what?\" \"Into a vampire,\" Sandra said proudly. I was stunned. Ben still looked embarrassed, yet hints of excitement and pride clung to him. Obviously, he\u0027d wanted this. \"Oh,\" I said, unsure how to respond. \"Congrats.\" \"Think about it-next year, you\u0027ll be biting one of us.\" Damon grinned as if amused by the prospect. \"Just don\u0027t f**k up with Vlad or you\u0027ll be the next one harpooned on a pole.\" \"Hey, we\u0027ll miss it,\" Joe said, going back to the window. Everyone else followed except Sandra, who shook her head. \"I don\u0027t like to watch such things. I am surprised you came to see it, Leila.\" \"See what?\" I asked, getting a sinking feeling in my gut. Ben turned around from the window. \"See Vlad stick Maximus on a pole for leaving you behind in the club.\" Chapter 26 I didn\u0027t bother to put on a coat, but marched around to the side of the house that was secluded by a tall line of trees. Now I knew the reason why. Any poor tourist who happened to stumble across Castle Dracula would get alarmed at the sight of several long poles stuck in the earth, some of them with remains still hanging from them. Vlad must have known that I was coming, either from my thoughts or the crunching noises my boots made with my furious stride. The long piece of timber he\u0027d had in his hand when I first glimpsed him through the window was now on the ground. Maximus stood next to him, shirtless, seemingly oblivious to the cold that made my whole body ache, a grim yet resigned expression on his face. \"Leila,\" Vlad said, voice as casual as if I\u0027d stumbled upon them sharing a beer. \"It\u0027s too cold for you to be out dressed like that. Go back inside. I\u0027ll join you in a moment.\" \"What, after you finish shish-kebobbing Maximus for no good reason?\" I snapped.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-39.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
