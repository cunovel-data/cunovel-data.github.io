{"id":99766,"no":58,"title":"Page 58","content":"I had just stroked a sunshine-colored couch in the fourth room when the lounge dissolved, turning into bare concrete walls with a single wooden door. Two vampires I recognized were inside. One was nailed to the wall with silver, the other typing on an iPad while seated on a bed of furs.\n Szilagyi cocked his head and then rose. I\u0027d been mentally singing as a defense against any mind readers in Tolvai\u0027s house, and the lyrics had announced my invisible presence before I could disconnect.\n \"My little psychic spy, I wondered when you would return,\" Szilagyi purred. Then he walked over to Marty and a knife appeared in his hand as if by magic. \"You\u0027ve missed some of the fun, but not all of it.\"\n You don\u0027t need to hurt him, I thought, willing to say anything to stop what I knew was about to happen. I, ah, already want to switch sides.\n Szilagyi gave me a smile so hard that it could cause ice to fracture. \"If that\u0027s true, then why are you blocking your thoughts behind that song . . . Leila?\"\n I ignored his use of my real name. As Vlad said, it was only a matter of time until Szilagyi picked up my paper trail.\n There could be other mind readers here, I improvised. If so, they can\u0027t pick up all my thoughts under the music, but I\u0027m risking my life contacting you and that should show I\u0027m serious.\n Szilagyi didn\u0027t know I\u0027d connected to him accidentally, but his essence on the armrest had been so strong, it had acted like an instant messaging system.\n \"Ah.\" Szilagyi appeared to mull that. Then, \"Why did you abandon your loyalty to Tepesh? You seemed very staunch in it the last time we spoke.\"\n I cast about for any reason he might believe. Things changed since then. You told me Vlad was faking nice, and you were right.\n The best lies were steeped in truth, Marty had once told me. I seized on that and continued, hiding my thoughts behind those endlessly repeating lyrics.\n Vlad even seduced me to get me emotionally attached to him, but since the first day he brought me to his house, he\u0027s had people monitoring my family. When you kidnapped Marty, he grabbed them to use as ammunition against me. Still, joke\u0027s on him because my family and I have been estranged for years. Marty\u0027s the only one I care about. That\u0027s why I snuck something of yours with me and contacted you as soon as I got here.\n \"And where is here, Leila?\" Szilagyi asked smoothly.\n My lies had worked too well, and now they\u0027d trapped me. I paused. Szilagyi ran a hand along Marty\u0027s face in a mockery of a caress. Marty said nothing, but he gave the faintest shake of his head. Even after everything Szilagyi had done to him-and was about to do-he didn\u0027t want to me to tell Szilagyi. He truly was the most loyal friend I had.\n Despite this, I couldn\u0027t betray Vlad, not to mention get Maximus and Shrapnel killed by answering Szilagyi because they wouldn\u0027t let him take me without a fight. I can\u0027t tell you, I thought while my stomach felt like it twisted into knots.\n Szilagyi clucked his tongue. \"How unfortunate.\"\n Then his knife flashed out. Marty doubled over as much as his restraints allowed. Something thick and red hit the ground.\n Stop! I mentally roared.\n \"I will when you tell me where you are,\" Szi-lagyi countered. His knife kept flashing. More gore splattered to the floor and Marty screamed in a way that would haunt my nightmares.\n I can\u0027t! I replied with another mental bellow. Maximus and Shrapnel are with me. If you come, they\u0027ll kill me before they allow you to take me.\n \"Maximus and Shrapnel?\" That made Szilagyi pause, but not in fear. In obvious delight. Clearly I\u0027d just added a cherry to the already yummy sundae of my situation.\n Yes, and if they realize they\u0027re outnumbered, they\u0027ll kill me, I repeated, seeking a reason that would dissuade him. I\u0027m no good to you dead, so give me a little time. Vlad\u0027s sending me all over the place, as you may have heard. I\u0027ll contact you as soon as circumstances are better.\n Szilagyi spun away from Marty to stare at what would have been eye level to me if I\u0027d actually been there.\n \"All right,\" he said.\n I was so surprised by his capitulation that my mind briefly went blank. \"But if you\u0027re lying to me,\" he went on, \"your friend will experience such pain that hell will be a relief once I finally kill him.\"\n My lack of belief in heaven or hell didn\u0027t prevent me from shuddering at the threat. I\u0027m not lying. I\u0027ll contact you as soon as I\u0027m under less heavy guard. Vlad\u0027s already getting lax by letting me go out without him.\n Fear for Marty made every mental syllable ring with the illusion of truth. After a long moment, Szilagyi gave me another frosty smile.\n \"You have a week to contact me with a location to collect you. Otherwise, your friend will suffer for your betrayal.\"\n Got it, I thought, stuffing down my doubts over how I\u0027d pull that off.\n His dark brown stare seemed to reach into my soul. \"Then I\u0027ll hear from you soon, Leila.\"\n I dropped the link and sank to my knees, still blasting away songs from an era where rockers had longer hair than their girlfriends. That awful gray room was replaced by shades of pale blue, yellow, and peach, the tall windows letting in the radiance of a sunny winter\u0027s day. Fear that I\u0027d just condemned Marty to a terrible death battled with determination. You can do this, I chanted to myself. Someone at Tolvai\u0027s had a connection to Szilagyi. We\u0027d find out who, Vlad would interrogate the hell out of him, and we\u0027d find Szilagyi\u0027s location and save Marty in time. I kept repeating it until I forced myself to believe it.\n The attack came less than twenty minutes later.\n Chapter 38\n I was still searching Tolvai\u0027s house to see if I could determine who he\u0027d been in collusion with when the first window shattered. I knew better than to assume anything benign caused it, so I ran to look for Maximus and Shrapnel. In the seconds it took me to see them in the entrance hallway, the house was under a full-scale assault.\n Glass exploded inward as vampires crashed through multiple windows, converging on the two men in the hallway. More violent sounds came from outside, too, and gunfire made me instinctively hit the floor. Once there, I froze, not sure if I should try to help, or if I\u0027d only get in their way. My decision was taken away when suddenly I was snatched up from behind, my right wrist held in an iron grip. Whoever grabbed me cursed from the voltage he absorbed, but I couldn\u0027t hit him with my full power. I couldn\u0027t even connect to Vlad and tell him of the attack because my hand was immobilized.\n Then a voice hissed in heavily accented English, \"Quit struggling! Szilagyi has ordered me to protect you.\"\n Tolvai. It wasn\u0027t one of his people who were in league with Szilagyi. It was him. No wonder Szi-lagyi had capitulated so easily at my refusal to tell him where I was. Tolvai hadn\u0027t stormed off in ire over his house being searched, but to message Szi-lagyi about his unexpected visitors. That\u0027s how he\u0027d known where to attack. When I first saw Szi-lagyi typing away on his iPad, he\u0027d probably been ordering the assault. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-58.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: \n After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
