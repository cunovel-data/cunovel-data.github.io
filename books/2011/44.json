{"id":99752,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"\"Can you tell where he is?\" Vlad asked in a hiss. \"No,\" I replied with a sudden burst of insight. \"He must\u0027ve known I\u0027d come looking for him. That\u0027s why he\u0027s in the same windowless concrete room that I saw when he ordered my attack. There\u0027s nothing in it but a big fur blanket, and even his clothes are so average; you can\u0027t tell anything from them.\" Szilagyi gave a concurring shrug. \"I thought it possible that you could locate me through an object I\u0027d touched. Why do you think I wanted to retrieve you so badly?\" \"Or kill me,\" I reminded him in a curt tone. Another shrug. \"Anyone who isn\u0027t on my side is my enemy.\" Then those deep brown eyes gleamed. \"You could still be on my side, Frankie. With that clever defense you have against mind reading, Vlad need not even suspect. Lead him to the place of my choosing, and I will ensure that you never spend another day bouncing on trampolines for pennies.\" \"Yeah, because I\u0027ll be dead,\" I scoffed. \"Jackal was going to kill me as soon as my usefulness ran out. I\u0027m supposed to believe you\u0027ll be any dif-ferent?\" \"Why would I kill someone with your priceless abilities if I can use you to my benefit?\" he asked silkily. \"Ooh, a lifetime of captivity, sounds nice,\" I mocked. \"Thanks, but no.\" Szilagyi\u0027s expression hardened into the merciless one I recognized from other people\u0027s memories. \"You believe that Vlad will let you go? Is he pretending to be kind? I\u0027ve seen that act from him before, but only a fool falls for it.\" \"I\u0027m not getting anywhere with him,\" I said to Vlad, ignoring Szilagyi\u0027s taunt. \"Do you have something you want me to relay before I go?\" \"Yes.\" Vlad\u0027s voice was pleasant. \"Tell him the next time I see him, I\u0027ll rip off his head and make a new toilet out of it.\" \"He hates you a lot,\" I summarized to Szilagyi. \"Accept my offer while you still can,\" the vampire replied. I dropped the link, the confining gray room morphing into soaring ceilings with tapestries depicting various scenes of ancient life. Vlad\u0027s fingers drummed on his armrest, the faint smell of smoke emanating from him. Behind him, Maximus was immobile, but Shrapnel paced in front of the fireplace. \"How is he even still alive?\" he muttered. I didn\u0027t think the question was to me, but I answered it. \"He was vague about the details. Said something about him and Vlad sharing a sire, and Vlad figuring it out if he thought about it long enough.\" Nothing but the crackling of flames for a few loaded moments. Then Vlad laughed, but it sounded far uglier than his usual half purr, half amused growl. \"He has Tenoch\u0027s gift of degeneration.\" Comprehension dawned on everyone\u0027s face except mine. \"What\u0027s that?\" Vlad\u0027s fingers drummed against the armrest hard enough to produce tiny splinters. \"Tenoch, the vampire who turned me, had many powers. One of them was the ability to degenerate into a withered husk, mimicking the appearance of true death for a vampire. Szilagyi was also turned by Tenoch, but while I inherited Tenoch\u0027s control over fire, Szilagyi must have inherited his gift of degeneration. That\u0027s why I thought I\u0027d burned him to death, but he wasn\u0027t dead. The filthy usurper was faking it.\" Flying. Pyrokinesis. Degeneration. What other vampire powers would I learn were possible? \"What happened between you and Szilagyi?\" I asked to distract myself from the scariness of undead abilities. \"Three hundred years later, you\u0027re still trying to kill each other.\" That scent of smoke coming from Vlad increased. \"The first time I was imprisoned, I was a boy and the Ottomans were my captors. The second time, I was a vampire and my jailer was the king of Hungary, who was mesmerized into imprisoning me by his uncle, Mihaly Szilagyi. My human allies were unable to free me and as my vampire sire was dead, Szilagyi could do with me what he wished without repercussions from the vampire world. He intended to break me and rule Wallachia through me as he ruled Hungary through his nephew, but\"-cold smile-\"I would not break. Szilagyi would\u0027ve killed me if not for Mencheres. He was Tenoch\u0027s most powerful progeny and declared me to be under his protection despite my protests that I\u0027d rather die than be subject to a filthy Turk, as I considered Mencheres at the time. But since Szilagyi was afraid of Mencheres, he kept me alive. Years later, as a condition of my freedom, I married the king of Hungary\u0027s pregnant cousin and claimed the child as mine. Szilagyi pretended to want my help in overthrowing the Ottomans, so he had the king of Hungary assist me in reclaiming Wallachia\u0027s throne, but he\u0027d secretly allied with the sultan.\" Vlad paused, a savage smile flitting across his face. \"When it came time to war, the Church paid Hungary to join me in fighting the Turks. My armies went. Szilagyi convinced Hungary\u0027s army to stay behind, but he never returned the money. Instead, he fabricated tales of my viciousness and spread them far and wide. My people suffered because of his lies and greed, and my reputation had been tarnished so badly that many allies abandoned me. When my brother ambushed me, I allowed my country to believe I\u0027d been killed so that my son could rule. Then he was murdered shortly after he\u0027d begun his reign. Two centuries later, I discovered Szilagyi had sent the assassin, and I trapped him at the Royal Court of Targoviste, where until today, I thought I\u0027d burned him to death.\" I winced. There was bad blood, and then there were centuries old virulent hatred. \"Why would Szilagyi wait so long to come after you?\" He clearly wasn\u0027t the forgive-and-forget type. Another smile that made me think of blood-coated knives instead of good humor. \"After I believed him dead, I hunted down and exterminated every member of Szilagyi\u0027s line, plus his friends and political allies. It would take centuries for him to build up enough support to mount a successful attack against me. If he came after me alone, he\u0027d be slaughtered.\" Now that Szilagyi had finally made his move, neither he nor Vlad would stop until one of them was really dead this time. \"At least he can\u0027t hear my thoughts when I link to him,\" I said, trying to look on the bright side of this bleak situation. Vlad\u0027s gaze swung to me. \"How?\" \"Bones taught me that playing really annoying songs over and over in my head acted as a barrier against mind reading. I was supposed to use that on you, but then things changed.\" \"Remind me to kill Bones next time I see him,\" he bit off. Being tricked by his enemy for so long had obviously pushed Vlad into new heights of rage. I didn\u0027t think the blazing in the hearth was accidental, and he would shred that armrest into sawdust with his increasingly vicious tapping. All of this should have made me head quietly toward the door, but I stayed where I was, mulling these developments.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-44.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
