{"id":99718,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"If I lived through this, I was kicking Marty\u0027s ass for not telling me some vampires could fly! What if Marty could fly, too? What if all vampires flew? My escape chances would be blown to hell if that were the case-\\n\\n \"Who is Marty? You didn\u0027t mention him before.\" Vlad\u0027s cool voice interrupted my train of thought.\\n\\n Marty\u0027s a vampire, too, I thought, still trying to absorb this new information. But he\u0027s not involved in any of this except for probably being worried sick about me.\\n\\n \"You belong to another vampire?\"\\n\\n A note of suspicion was back in his voice, and the way he said \"belong\" implied sexual or edible benefits. Or both. I scowled, forgetting Vlad couldn\u0027t see it.\\n\\n No! We work together and we\u0027re friends, but that\u0027s it.\\n\\n Ew, I couldn\u0027t help but add. Marty was like a second father to me. The idea of him poking his fangs-or anything else-into me was repellent.\\n\\n What\u0027s taking you so long? I thought, getting back to the most important topic. It\u0027s been hours. Did you change your mind?\\n\\n It sounded like he snorted, but with the whooshing wind all around him, I couldn\u0027t be sure.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t change my mind. I was very far from Florida.\"\\n\\n So he was still coming. Relief competed with anxiety. They made me find you again, I told him. I tried to stall, but they threatened to eat a family. Said telling them you were at your house wasn\u0027t good enough and they\u0027d need to know where you were when you were away from that place.\\n\\n A grin stretched his mouth. I didn\u0027t find anything funny in my statements, but we must have a different sense of humor.\\n\\n \"Are they with you now?\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t see them at the moment, but I knew Jackal, Twitchy, Pervert, and Psycho were still clustered around me.\\n\\n Yeah. They wouldn\u0027t leave me alone this time.\\n\\n \"Good.\"\\n\\n If I didn\u0027t know the others could hear me, I would\u0027ve let out an audible scoff. Vlad could at least pretend to care that my neck was in danger of becoming a Capri Sun.\\n\\n He chuckled, flipping up his coat sleeve to glance at something. Whatever it was seemed to please him, because his teeth flashed in another grin.\\n\\n \"I want you to start narrating, Leila. Tell the others exactly what you see me doing.\"\\n\\n Why? I almost blurted aloud, catching myself just in time.\\n\\n That emerald gaze seemed to laser on me. \"Because I told you to,\" he said, his tone implying that he didn\u0027t appreciate having his directives questioned.\\n\\n I hope this doesn\u0027t get me killed, I sent to him irritably. My hand tightened around the silver knife. It might be my only hope if this stunt backfired and Jackal realized that my tie to Vlad went both ways.\\n\\n \"I can see him,\" I said out loud. If I believed in God, I would\u0027ve started praying.\\n\\n In the midst of the wind whistling around Vlad, I heard Jackal\u0027s voice. Felt his hand shaking my shoulder.\\n\\n \"In the present? Or future?\"\\n\\n \"Present,\" I said, again hoping I wasn\u0027t signing my death warrant. \"He\u0027s not in his house anymore. He\u0027s flying.\"\\n\\n The shaking grew rougher. \"What\u0027s he flying over, Frankie?\"\\n\\n \"How should I know?\" I replied truthfully. \"It\u0027s dark. I can\u0027t see much . . . wait.\"\\n\\n Vlad had angled his body downward. The noise from the wind increased. In the distance, I saw tiny dots appear.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s over somewhere populated now. I can see lights. Lots of them.\"\\n\\n A slap burned the side of my face. \"Where? I need something more specific than \u0027populated\u0027 and \u0027lights,\u0027 you stupid bitch!\"\\n\\n I wanted to cradle my cheek, but didn\u0027t because I needed all my attention on my link with Vlad. I hope you go medieval on his ass when you get here! I mentally spat.\\n\\n Vlad\u0027s grin widened, showing those sharp-looking upper fangs. \"I\u0027ll remind you that you said that.\"\\n\\n Then he angled his body in a steeper slant. The glow of lights beneath him became brighter, objects forming distinguishable shapes instead of blank nothingness. I squinted to try and see better, hoping he wasn\u0027t hours away.\\n\\n \"It looks like . . . he might have just flown over an amusement park,\" I continued. He was going so fast, it was hard to be sure. \"I think I just saw a roller coaster.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t slap me again, but if Jackal shook me any harder, he\u0027d dislocate my shoulder. \"What park?\"\\n\\n \"Stop that!\" I snapped, anger getting the better of me. \"You want me to lose the link? Then keep breaking my focus by roughing me up.\"\\n\\n The shaking stopped, but Jackal\u0027s hand felt like a concrete boulder on my upper arm. \"What park?\" he repeated.\\n\\n \"Too late to tell, he\u0027s past it now. I see lots of roofs and buildings coming up . . .\"\\n\\n And water. Excitement threaded through me. Florida had theme parks set near water and large cities. If Vlad had just flown over Disney World, he might only be about an hour away.\\n\\n Is that where you are? I sent to him. Florida?\\n\\n Another grin was the only reply I got, but the blur of scenery below him began to take clearer shape. It took me a second to realize why.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s slowing down. Dropping lower . . .\"\\n\\n My heart began to beat faster. I wasn\u0027t adept at recognizing landmarks from a bird\u0027s-eye view, but I thought the cluster of buildings Vlad just flew over looked familiar.\\n\\n \"Well?\" Jackal\u0027s grip tightened again. \"What do you see?\"\\n\\n That thumping in my chest continued to increase when I saw a harbor that I was now positive I recognized.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s over a marina. I can\u0027t see any street names yet, but he\u0027s . . . he seems to be slowing down even more.\"\\n\\n \"A marina?\" All of a sudden, Jackal sounded uneasy. His hand loosened on my arm.\\n\\n I clutched the silver knife like it was a lifeline. \"Yes. Now he\u0027s heading toward a city. I see lots of buildings . . . he\u0027s dropping down even lower . . . I see a sign on one of them-\"\\n\\n \"What does the sign say?\" Jackal interrupted, his voice tight with urgency. \"What\u0027s it say, Frankie?\"\\n\\n I dropped the link to Vlad, not needing it anymore. The hotel room seemed to rush around me in a series of colors, swallowing up the inky darkness that had surrounded Vlad. My heart pounded like it was trying to free itself from my chest and sweat slicked the knife in my hand.\\n\\n \"It says,\" I rasped, nerves and determination making my voice rougher, \"Red Roof Inn, Tampa.\"\\n\\n I only had a moment to savor the shock in their expressions before the hotel window imploded from a large form hurtling through it.\\n\\n Time seemed to switch into fast-forward. One second I was being pelted by flying glass, the next I was shoved into a corner, staring at the back of a dark-haired man in a trench coat. Before my next blink, flames coated the walls in orange and red waves, covering every inch of the room except the section where I was. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-8.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
