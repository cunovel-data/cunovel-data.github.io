{"id":99717,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\"I don\u0027t,\" I said aloud, then cursed myself. If Jackal heard me and came to investigate, I might not be able to resist a second dose of his gaze before I spilled the truth.\n Look, you\u0027ve got me all wrong, I thought rapidly, hoping his antennae into my head hadn\u0027t lost its signal. I have no idea who you are, but four vampires kidnapped me and they\u0027re forcing me to locate you for them.\n \"Oh?\" Amusement replaced the former harshness in his expression. \"If that\u0027s true, I\u0027ll make it easy on you. I\u0027m at my home. Tell the others to drop by anytime.\"\n Flames coated his hands with the words, a warning I didn\u0027t need because I was terrified of him already. That fear combined with the death Jackal had planned for me made my reply snappy.\n That\u0027s great, but I\u0027m not only supposed to find out where you are now. I\u0027m supposed to find out where you\u0027ll be in the future, and I\u0027m guessing you won\u0027t be as flip about that.\n His brows drew together at once, making those coppery green eyes all the more riveting-and frightening.\n \"You can see the future?\" All traces of humor left his expression.\n I heaved a mental sigh. How to explain an ability I didn\u0027t fully understand?\n If I touch someone-or an object with a strong emotional essence on it-I catch glimpses of things. If the glimpses are in black and white, they\u0027re from the past. If they\u0027re in color but hazy, they\u0027re from the future. And if I concentrate, I can trace someone\u0027s essence from an object to find that person in the present, which looks clear and normal to me. That\u0027s how I found you. Jackal gave me pieces of things from people you killed.\n He continued to stare at me until I squirmed. Aside from it being unbelievable that he could hear me, he seemed able to see me, too! How? I wasn\u0027t there, after all.\n \"I don\u0027t see you like you\u0027re thinking,\" he answered, a tight smile playing about his lips. \"You\u0027re a voice in my head, but when I concentrate, it\u0027s though you\u0027re here yet you\u0027re invisible.\"That sounded creepy. I didn\u0027t have time to ponder it, because he went on.\n \"Someone named Jackal is after me? I don\u0027t recognize the name, but it\u0027s likely an alias. He kidnapped you, you say?\"\n He and three of his buddies snatched me right off my trampoline this morning, I answered, grimacing at the memory.\n \"Do you know where they\u0027re holding you?\"\n I knew exactly where I was. Even if I couldn\u0027t tell by touching items in the room, the phone had the hotel\u0027s full address printed on it. Still, I wasn\u0027t about to tell Mr. Inferno where that was until we agreed on some terms.\n He grunted in amusement. \"Terms? You want a reward for turning them in to me?\"\n I want to live, I thought at him grimly. I saw what you did to Neddy and Raziel, so I want your word that if I tell you where Jackal and the others are, you\u0027ll kill them, not me.\n \"Depends,\" he said, voice crisp as though this were a business transaction. \"If you truly were forced into this as you claim, then I vow you\u0027ll come to no harm. But if you\u0027re lying in an attempt to lead me into a trap . . .\"\n He flashed one of those charming smiles that had been the last thing Neddy and Raziel had seen. I shuddered.\n I\u0027m not lying, I sent to him. The only people I\u0027m trying to trap are Jackal, Pervert, Psycho, and Twitchy.\n \"Then you have nothing to fear from me,\" he said, not commenting on the other names. He clasped those deadly hands in front of him. \"And it\u0027s time we were properly introduced. I\u0027m Vlad, and you are?\"\n I hesitated, but replied with my real name because I didn\u0027t want to risk even a white lie with this creature.\n Leila. My name is Leila.\n \"Leila.\" He said my name as though he could taste the syllables. That charming smile widened. \"Now, tell me where you are.\"\n Chapter 5\n Jackal tossed the partially melted belt at me. \"Try again. Knowing he\u0027s at his house is worthless. We need to know where he\u0027ll be when he\u0027s away from that fortress, not safe inside it.\"\n I glanced at the clock on the dresser. Almost two a.m., more than eight hours since I\u0027d spoken to Vlad-who was taking his vampire status way too seriously with that name. What was keeping him? Had he decided these men weren\u0027t worth the effort to kill? I\u0027d love to touch the melted belt and find out, but I didn\u0027t know if I could get all of them to vamoose again. Jackal had promised me an hour alone before, but he\u0027d barged into the room only thirty minutes later.\n \"I\u0027m exhausted,\" I said, rubbing my forehead for effect. \"Reliving all these deaths, repeatedly trying to connect to someone in the present . . . it takes a toll.\" And I also had a nasty headache, but I didn\u0027t think they\u0027d care about that.\n \"You want me to wake you up with these?\" Psycho snarled, baring his fangs at me.\n Jackal laid a hand on him. \"That\u0027s not necessary,\" he said in a soothing tone. \"Poor Frankie\u0027s tired. We should let her get some sleep. I know-let\u0027s go grab dinner. I saw a tasty-looking family in Room 302. Plenty for all of us.\"\n My stomach heaved, because the cold glint in his eyes said he wasn\u0027t bluffing. Pervert, Twitchy, and Psycho smirked, silently daring me to make their night. I got off the bed.\n \"Let me pee and splash some water on my face, then I\u0027ll try to find him again,\" I said, silently cursing them. I walked the short distance to the bathroom and shut the door. At least none of them tried to insist on coming in with me.\n That stalling tactic only bought me a few minutes. Soon I was back on the bed, shivering under the air-conditioning and reaching for the silver knife.\n \"Why not the belt?\" Jackal asked at once, stopping me.\n I glared at him, too mad over his dinner threat and worried that Vlad had changed his mind to feign politeness. \"It\u0027s easier to develop a connection through something I\u0027ve already used.\"\n He grunted. \"Fine. Get to it, and we\u0027re not leaving unless you want us to find that family.\"\n More rage flared, but I pursed my lips and said nothing, picking up the cold blade. Neddy\u0027s death washed over me again, and I pushed through those memories until I found the link to the fire starter. To my surprise, it barely took any time. A vast expanse of indigo replaced the hotel room around me. Vlad was in the middle of that dark expanse, stretched out full-length, his eyes glowing emerald as he looked at something I couldn\u0027t see.\n For a moment, I was confused. He almost seemed as though he was swimming in his inky surroundings, except he had on a long gray coat that wasn\u0027t wet. What . . . ?\n \"I\u0027m not swimming, Leila. I\u0027m flying.\"\n Vlad\u0027s voice flowed over my mind, sounding amused. I realized that the endless expanse around him wasn\u0027t water, but the night sky. He had to be high up, too. I didn\u0027t see any lights below. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-7.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: \n After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
