Shrapnel bowed first to Vlad and then to me as he held the door open for the people trailing behind him.\\n\\n \"Look at this huge f**king place!\" a familiar voice exclaimed. My sister, Gretchen, was the opposite of demure.\\n\\n I snatched the gloves and put the right one on. Vlad tucked the box back in his jacket and slid the left one on for me since the thicker material made it more awkward. Still, it was a thousand times less bulky than the industrial glove Marty had gotten me from a Florida Power \u0026 Light employee. No one would look twice at these while the other led to constant questions.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I murmured.\\n\\n His hands lingered on mine, their heat apparent even through the material. \"You\u0027re welcome.\"\\n\\n \"Leila!\"\\n\\n My sister\u0027s voice yanked my attention back to Gretchen. She managed to look around in awe while also marching forward at an angry clip. Her straight black hair was shorter than the last time I\u0027d seen her, but even though she\u0027d been on a plane for over a dozen hours, her makeup was perfect as usual, accenting pretty features, full lips, and an upturned nose. Blue eyes a few shades darker than mine glared at me.\\n\\n \"What kind of cluster f**k have you gotten us into now?\" she demanded.\\n\\n \"Hello to you, too, Gretchen,\" I said dryly.\\n\\n Then my voice caught as I saw the man behind her. Hugh Dalton\u0027s hair had more salt than pepper now, but he still wore it cropped close to his head in the same style as when he\u0027d been a lieutenant colonel. His blue-gray eyes took in Vlad\u0027s house with watchfulness versus admiration, and though he used a cane, his air of authority and tempered toughness remained the same.\\n\\n I swallowed the lump that rocketed up my throat. \"Hi, Dad.\"\\n\\n I am the world\u0027s WORST liar, I thought an hour later. I\u0027d tried to stall by urging my family to go to their rooms to unpack, but Gretchen was having none of that, and with less dramatics, neither was my father.\\n\\n Vlad wasn\u0027t helping me come up with a cover story, either. No, he\u0027d introduced himself as Vladislav Basarab without a moment\u0027s pause, though the significance of that name went over my family\u0027s heads. Shrapnel had offered them little explanation during his scoop-and-run procurement, so Vlad was leaving it up to me to tell my family a big whopping lie, or the truth.\\n\\n I went with a big whopping lie, of course.\\n\\n \"You witnessed a mob murder and now you\u0027re in the Romanian witness protection program?\" My father cast a pointed look around at the magnificent, two-story library. \"Seems a lot different than the American version.\"\\n\\n Wait until he saw the rest of the house. \"Well, Romania is broken into communes and Vlad is um, like a mayor of several of them. Since I\u0027m hiding from members of the European Mafia, the Romanian\"-were they called something other than police here?-\"authorities thought his house would be the safest place for me until, uh, they catch the bad guys,\" I finished lamely.\\n\\n Vlad glanced away, but not before I saw his mouth twitch. Okay, it sounded like the load of bull it was, but I\u0027d thought he would come up with something to tell them! Or at least give me more than a two-minute warning to make up a story myself.\\n\\n Maybe he would\u0027ve warned you earlier if you hadn\u0027t avoided him all day, an insidious little voice taunted.\\n\\n Up yours, I snapped back at it.\\n\\n Vlad coughed, something that didn\u0027t seem unusual to my father or sister, but made me narrow my gaze. Vampires didn\u0027t cough. Was he muffling a laugh?\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure Vlad can go into more detail if you have questions,\" I added in a frosty tone.\\n\\n The grin he flashed me made me sure about the muffled laugh. \"No, you\u0027re doing a splendid job.\"\\n\\n My father frowned, adding to the new lines in his face that I didn\u0027t remember from the last time I\u0027d seen him.\\n\\n \"How long are Gretchen and I expected to stay sequestered with you?\" he asked with his usual directness.\\n\\n The million-dollar question. I took a deep breath. \"We\u0027re not sure. Maybe a couple weeks. Maybe a few months.\"\\n\\n My sister rose to her full five feet four inches. \"You can\u0027t expect me to put my life on hold that long!\" she screeched. \"I have a job, friends, plans-\"\\n\\n \"Lower your voice,\" my father said tersely.\\n\\n I\u0027d never been able to get Gretchen to quiet down when she went on a verbal rampage, but decades of command hung in that single sentence. She stopped talking, yet the glare she shot me promised there was more where that came from.\\n\\n My father turned his attention back to me. \"What if we elect not to be sequestered with you? What then?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be captured, tortured, and eventually killed by the people after your daughter,\" Vlad replied in a casual tone.\\n\\n My mouth fell open at his bluntness. Gretchen let out a shocked gasp. Vlad looked at me and shrugged as if to say, You wanted me to take over.\\n\\n My father gazed at Vlad with open calculation. I\u0027d seen that hard stare cower countless people, but of course, it had no effect on Vlad. He stared back, that pleasant half smile never leaving his face.\\n\\n \"I still have top-level connections,\" my father stated. \"Leila can be protected back in her own country.\"\\n\\n Vlad\u0027s brow arched. \"With her abilities? You know better than to expose her to your government or military. She\u0027d never see the outside of a covert research facility again.\"\\n\\n His derision when he said \"research\" was unmistakable. A muscle ticked in my father\u0027s jaw.\\n\\n \"So you know what she can do?\"\\n\\n Vlad and I were on opposite ends of the same couch, him relaxed, me stiff, but at that, he caught my hand and kissed it.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m very well acquainted with her abilities.\"\\n\\n Gretchen\u0027s eyes bugged while my father\u0027s expression darkened. Vlad couldn\u0027t have been clearer in his meaning.\\n\\n \"Ah, I\u0027ll take over from here,\" I said.\\n\\n \"How can you stand touching her?\" my sister blurted, staring at our clasped hands. \"Doesn\u0027t that hurt?\"\\n\\n I seized on the change of topic. \"These gloves are specialized rubber. They block the current.\"\\n\\n Gretchen\u0027s gaze traveled over Vlad, disbelief still stamped on her features. \"Yeah, but how do you two do anything else, unless he has a special, current-repelling glove for his-\"\\n\\n \"Gretchen!\" my father cut her off.\\n\\n My cheeks felt hot. Don\u0027t say a word, I thought to Vlad, seeing his chest tremble with suppressed laughter.\\n\\n \"He has a natural immunity,\" I gritted out.\\n\\n They didn\u0027t know about vampires, and that was the explanation I\u0027d given for how I could work with Marty. Considering the unusual abilities other circus performers had, immunity to electricity wasn\u0027t too much of a stretch. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-46.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
