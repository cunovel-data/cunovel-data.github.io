Oh, how I hated those essence-heavy things!\n He continued to study me, his expression a mixture of pitiless calculation and curiosity. \"You said you\u0027ve had this ability for a dozen years, which must be half your life judging from how young you look. I was already old when I developed the power to read humans\u0027 thoughts, yet the depravities I uncovered still managed to disturb me. Your gift reaches much deeper than that. I\u0027m amazed you haven\u0027t snapped under the strain of it.\"\n I shrugged as if I hadn\u0027t been driven to a suicide attempt over the countless atrocities I\u0027d relived. \"Sometimes it\u0027s helped. I know who to avoid. People can perfect whatever fa\u0026ccedil;ade they want, but everyone holds their sins close to their skin.\"\n His laugh held a hint of grimness. \"How true that is.\"\n The limo bounced over a rut, jostling me. I looked out the window. Trees laden with snow and ice were most of what I saw, but if I craned, I could see the terrain was starting to get steep. After a minute, my ears began to pop. I forced a yawn to relieve the pressure, missing Florida\u0027s sea-level altitude.\n \"Is it very far to your house?\"\n I hadn\u0027t eaten in almost two days since I\u0027d skipped breakfast the morning I was kidnapped. Then again, this was a vampire house. I remembered what Marty used to stock in the refrigerator, and it hadn\u0027t been anything I wanted to sample. I regarded the wooded landscape bleakly. Probably wasn\u0027t a grocery store or restaurant within fifty miles of here, either.\n An amused grunt directed my attention back to Vlad. \"I have ample food, Leila, and this is Romania. Not the northern wilds of Siberia. We\u0027ll be at my house shortly, and on the way, we\u0027ll pass through a town that has both grocers and restaurants.\"\n I flushed at his mocking tone, once again reminding myself to watch my thoughts-if I could figure out a way to do that.\n \"You eat regular food? Marty was never into that. Said it all tasted like clay to him.\"\n \"It does, and I don\u0027t, but I have an abundance of food for the humans who live with me. If they were undernourished, then they wouldn\u0027t be able to feed me or my staff.\"\n His tone was completely casual, but I was starting to realize that Vlad never said anything by accident. I met his gaze, noting the hint of challenge. He was almost daring me to be offended by his flesh version of a pantry.\n \"Marty always drank from tightfisted tourists,\" I said, arching a brow in answering challenge. \"Said it served them right for not tipping after our performance. He never tried to drink from me, of course, because he said that business and food should be kept separate.\"\n Vlad\u0027s lips curled. \"Subtle you\u0027re not. If you\u0027re wondering whether I\u0027m intending to drink from you, don\u0027t play games. Ask.\"\n \"Are you?\" I responded at once, adding, \"I don\u0027t want you to. I know it won\u0027t kill me or turn me into a vampire, but I\u0027m already an \u0027instrument.\u0027 I don\u0027t want to be dinner, too.\"\n \"No, I\u0027m not,\" he replied calmly. \"Nor will any other vampire while you\u0027re under my protection. Your friend Marty and I agree about keeping food and business alliances separate.\"\n That was a relief. Maybe staying with Vlad wouldn\u0027t be too different than living with Marty, though hopefully it would be much shorter than the four years Marty and I toured together.\n \"What did the two of you do?\" Vlad asked, lacing his free hand behind his head.\n \"Traveling circus performers,\" I answered, braced for the scorn most people showed upon hearing that.\n Nothing changed in his expression. \"Clever, with your condition. If anyone noticed your tendency to electrocute people, they would assume it to be a circus trick, and you wouldn\u0027t remain long enough in one place for more serious questions to arise.\"\n \"That\u0027s exactly it,\" I said with surprise. If only my dad and my sister could grasp that logic so easily. My job was an embarrassment to them. The last I heard, they told people I was a stage actress.\n Vlad shrugged. \"Vampires have experience hiding what we are. Ah, here is the town. Beyond it is my home.\"\n I glanced out the window to see us whizzing by a small town that did indeed look like it had shops and restaurants. With all the snow and the quaint, picturesque architecture, it also could\u0027ve doubled as a snapshot of the mythical Santa\u0027s Village.\n \"Pretty,\" I said, \"but I hope your driver doesn\u0027t get pulled over. I doubt the speed limit here is eighty.\"\n It sounded like Vlad stifled a laugh. \"No need to worry.\"\n I kept looking out the window, seeing large rocks peek up amidst the trees. A shift in balance leaned me farther back into my seat, confirming that the road was getting steeper. Still, the driver didn\u0027t slow down, whipping around the bends and turns with what seemed to be total disregard for life and limb. I glanced at Vlad, but he appeared unconcerned. Of course. He could survive the car careening off a cliff or hitting a tree.\n \"No need to worry,\" Vlad said again with more amusement.\n \"Oh, I\u0027m glorious,\" I replied through gritted teeth. Closing my eyes was probably the best way to get through this.\n It might have only been ten minutes before the car came to a stop. To me, it felt like a solid hour. I\u0027d probably sent enough nervous currents into Vlad to power a small locomotive, but he hadn\u0027t let go of my hand. Now, however, he entangled himself from my grasp.\n \"We\u0027ve arrived.\"\n I opened my eyes. His body briefly blocked my line of vision, but once he was out of the vehicle, I saw the house we\u0027d stopped at. And stared, my mouth falling open.\n Chapter 9\n The word house didn\u0027t begin to do justice to the white and gray structure in front of me. I actually had to tilt my head back to see all the way up to the roof. It was at least four towering stories high, with additional floors on the triangular turrets that rose dramatically on each corner. A myriad of carvings decorated the exterior, from intricate balconies in front of soaring windows to stone gargoyles that glared down from their perches. They weren\u0027t the only sentinels of this gothic-looking palace; at least a dozen people were stationed in various spots around the house, some standing so still that at first glance, I\u0027d thought they were statues, too.\n The only thing more startling than the mansion\u0027s height was its length. I couldn\u0027t tell where the right side ended because a line of lofty evergreens blocked my view, but everything to the left of me went on for the length of a football field. A high stone wall with manned lookout towers encircled the property. Beyond that and the surrounding forest, dark gray mountains acted as a natural barrier, adding to the imposing feel of the place. No wonder Jackal didn\u0027t want to try anything until Vlad was away from here, I thought, awed. This wasn\u0027t a house; it truly was a fortress. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-14.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: \n After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
