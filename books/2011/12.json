I tried to clear my mind, but it\u0027s not like it had an off switch.\\n\\n \"You told me your name was Leila, but your friend and those other vampires called you Frankie,\" he continued. \"You took the Frankenstein insult and shortened it into a nickname?\"\\n\\n I lifted my chin. \"Yes.\" I\u0027d needed to change my identity, and after I got over my hurt feelings, I used my classmates\u0027 pettiness for inspiration. If they\u0027d thought their favorite taunt would make me crumble, they\u0027d thought wrong.\\n\\n \"What made you choose the name Vlad?\" I asked, unable to resist adding, \"It\u0027s not the most original vampire name you could have picked, after all.\"\\n\\n Instead of being offended, that little smirk was back. \"I\u0027m the only authentic Vlad. Everyone else is merely an envious imitation.\"\\n\\n I snorted, giving him a deliberate once-over. With his long dark hair, striking features, frightening charisma, and seductively muscled body, he looked like he could pass for the infamous Prince of Darkness, but how naive did he think I was?\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got the obligatory dangerous-yet-sexy thing going on, but I\u0027ll believe you\u0027re the real Dracula when you believe I\u0027m the real Frankenstein.\"\\n\\n \"Dracula is a caricature born from a writer\u0027s imaginings,\" he snapped, that tiny smile gone. His hand flared hotter, too. \"It bears no resemblance to me any more than Mary Shelley\u0027s story is an accounting of you.\"\\n\\n Wow, he took his little fantasy seriously. And he just heard you say that, I reminded myself as his look grew pointed.\\n\\n \"What did you want to talk about?\" I asked, shaking my head as though it could rattle any incriminating thoughts loose.\\n\\n \"Your survival chances.\"\\n\\n His tone was casual, expression back to that pleasant one I found more frightening than a menacing scowl. I\u0027d seen the faces of countless murderers, but none of them had mastered the look of detached friendliness like Vlad did when he killed.\\n\\n \"Is this the part where you tell me how I\u0027m going to die?\" I asked, steeling myself for whatever came next.\\n\\n He squeezed my hand in a companionable way. \"You should have seen that I don\u0027t waste my time with monologues before I kill. In fact, it\u0027s in my best interest to protect you.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t reply, just raised my brows at this dubious statement.\\n\\n \"I doubt I\u0027ll get any useful information from your remaining kidnapper no matter how much I torture him,\" he went on. \"He strikes me as a pawn, so he probably has no idea who sent him after you.\"\\n\\n I continued with my doubtful stare. He rolled his eyes. \"I forgot your generation is only familiar with mobile phone games like Angry Birds. In chess, pawns are the lowest level of-\"\\n\\n \"I know how to play chess,\" I interrupted. \"When you can\u0027t touch a cell phone or play electronic games without frying them, you learn to make do with the classics.\"\\n\\n He grinned, revealing those lovely white teeth. I reminded myself that if I mentally recited that famous line from Little Red Riding Hood, he\u0027d hear it.\\n\\n \"Good. If you checked your e-mail every five minutes, or keep texting and Tweeting in the middle of our conversation, I might snap your neck out of sheer principle.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d feel right at home in some retirement communities with a technophobic attitude like that. You probably love to tell kids to get off your lawn, too.\"\\n\\n Cell phone addiction annoyed me, too, but I\u0027d never fantasized about murdering anyone over it, unless you counted people who talked on their phones during a movie . . .\\n\\n His smile didn\u0027t slip. \"You\u0027re still half expecting me to harm you, yet you don\u0027t hesitate to needle me. Aren\u0027t you afraid to make me angry?\"\\n\\n He could read my mind, so I didn\u0027t bother answering with anything except the truth.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re scarier when you\u0027re nice, and you\u0027ve already decided if you\u0027re going to kill me. No amount of bantering or begging on my part will change your mind, so I\u0027ll keep on being myself. You\u0027re not the only one who doesn\u0027t care for pretense.\"\\n\\n This time, his smile widened into a full-fledged, wicked grin that made him almost devilishly handsome. I looked away, not wanting my thoughts to inflate his ego. To distract myself, I concentrated on the scarred hand holding mine. His grip was light, as if I could pull away at any moment, but we both knew better.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right on all counts,\" he said in that smooth, accented voice. \"But you\u0027ll be relieved to know that you\u0027re not about to die. I said it was in my best interest to protect you, and I meant that. If I\u0027m right-and I always am-your remaining kidnapper will be a dead end. That leaves you as my best chance to discover who sent those vampires after me.\"\\n\\n \"Me?\" I repeated, my gaze flying back to his.\\n\\n \"Your ability to divine information through touch as well as locate people in the present and future is priceless. Vampires all over the world would kill to use you as an instrument against their enemies. I\u0027m astounded that you\u0027ve remained anonymous as long as you have, considering your friendship with another vampire.\"\\n\\n \"Marty would never use me like that,\" I flared. It was bad enough to feel like a pariah because of my condition, but being reduced to \"instrument\" status was worse.\\n\\n \"Perhaps, which is why I\u0027m letting him live,\" Vlad replied. \"That\u0027s a kindness I don\u0027t usually bestow on anyone who attacks me, but because of his affection for you, he\u0027ll also be invested in finding out who was really behind your kidnapping.\"\\n\\n What if neither one of us wants to help you? I couldn\u0027t help but wonder. Marty and I had nothing to do with whatever feud Vlad had going on with another vampire.\\n\\n Those coppery eyes sparked emerald for a second. \"If I let you go, how long do you think it would be until that same vampire sent another crew to snatch you up? You need me to find this person far more than I do. I\u0027m hard to ambush.\" He gave me a callous rake of his gaze. \"You\u0027re not, and since you seem to be an intelligent girl, you already know that.\"\\n\\n His hand didn\u0027t so much as twitch, but I imagined I could feel it tightening over mine until it formed an unbreakable snare. My pride wanted to refute what he\u0027d just said, but my abilities meant I\u0027d relived too many instances of the unwary falling victim to the unmerciful. I might have a chance against one vampire, maybe two thanks to my electrocution capability, but against a horde of them? Even if Marty fought with me, I\u0027d be setting us both up to fail, and damned if I\u0027d be that stupid.\\n\\n \"Wise decision,\" he said, still watching me with that unblinking gaze. \"You keep thinking like that and you\u0027ll live long enough to dance on your enemies\u0027 graves.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-12.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
