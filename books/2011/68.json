{"id":99776,"no":68,"title":"Page 68","content":"After a brief reunion with Gretchen and my dad to assure them that I was fine after my captivity, I pleaded exhaustion and went to my room. I was tired, but I couldn\u0027t sleep for many reasons. One of those was because of what happened at the stable. It didn\u0027t bother me that I\u0027d killed Rend and the other guards. Given the right circumstances, most people were capable of taking a life, and this had been a kill-or-be-killed situation. But what I hadn\u0027t anticipated was how I\u0027d enjoyed it.\n Surviving against deadly foes accounted for some of the exhilaration I\u0027d felt, but not all of it. I could use the excuse that Vlad\u0027s ruthlessness was rubbing off, but deep down, I knew this cold-bloodedness was all mine. Vlad had even pointed out the darkness in me before our relationship began. I\u0027d thought he was referring to everything I\u0027d seen from my abilities. Now I realized he meant what lurked within me, and it had probably been there since before the accident.\n As disturbing as that realization was, what really kept me awake had nothing to do with my unexpected harsh streak. The sun burned off most of the morning fog by the time I heard Vlad\u0027s booted stride down the hallway. He came into my room, threw his dirt-smeared coat onto the floor, and was in the process of kicking off his boots when what I was doing made him pause.\n I sat in front of the mahogany fireplace, my right hand inside the orange and blue flames. They leapt between my fingers and curled around my wrist, but not one of them directly touched my skin. Instead, they skipped over me as if I wore an invisible glove, and while their warmth was pleasant, it wasn\u0027t scorching as it should have been with my proximity.\n \"Ah, so my aura is still embedded in you,\" Vlad commented, not sounding concerned. He resumed his boot removal.\n I withdrew my hand, looking at its unblemished state with a mixture of wonder and dismay. \"Did you find Szilagyi\u0027s bones?\"\n \"No.\" Boots off, he came over, kneeling beside me. \"Don\u0027t worry. If he managed to survive, it will take a day at least for him to dig his way out. My men have the area surrounded, and now you, my beauty, can link to him and see if he\u0027d dead, or see what hole he\u0027s attempting to crawl out of.\"\n I stared at him for a long moment. The dirt and soot made him look fiercer, darkening that sexy stubble along his jaw and making his cheekbones more prominent. His lips were parted, showing a glimpse of white teeth that could tease and terrorize with equal skill. Firelight added a hint of gold to his copper-colored eyes, and those encircling rings of emerald grew as his brows drew together in a frown.\n \"What\u0027s wrong? You smell distraught.\"\n I glanced at the fire. If not for Vlad willing his aura into me, I would have died from flames last night, but my survival had come at a price neither one of us had anticipated.\n \"I already tried looking for Szilagyi,\" I said, glancing back at Vlad. \"There\u0027s nothing to link to anymore.\"\n He started to smile. \"Then he truly is dead.\"\n I savored his expression because it might be the last time he looked at me this way. Then I forced myself to continue.\n \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s not just Szilagyi\u0027s essence that I can\u0027t link to anymore. It\u0027s everyone\u0027s.\"\n I stroked the ornately carved wood around the fireplace for emphasis. \"I\u0027m not picking up impressions from what I touch anymore. Coating me with your aura did more than make me fireproof, Vlad. It also covered my abilities like some sort of supernatural glove and nothing gets in.\"\n Very slowly, he rose, his expression changing from satisfaction to absolute inscrutability. Neither of us spoke the words that seemed to scream in the silence. Was if this wasn\u0027t temporary? It might be a cure for the psychometric abilities I\u0027d long wished to be rid of, but they were also the main reason Vlad had been drawn to me in the first place. If their loss was permanent, I\u0027d gained some of the normalcy I longed for, but it might cost me the man I was falling in love with.\n And his enemy might still be out there. The explosion should have killed Szilagyi, but he\u0027d cheated death before, and a bone-deep pessimism warned me that we hadn\u0027t seen the last of him.\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Vlad said, repeating his earlier words with less conviction this time. \"I\u0027ll double the guards at Poenari. Either my men will find Szi-lagyi alive, or, once your powers return, you can verify that he is truly dead.\"\n I didn\u0027t dispute his belief that I\u0027d get my abilities back. Right now, we were both guessing on that count.\n \"Reading my thoughts again?\" I asked dryly.\n He flashed me a tight smile. \"Always.\"\n Then he put his boots back on, leaving his coat where it lay. \"I\u0027ll notify my men to double the watch, and now I intend to take one more sweep of the area before I rest.\"\n He kissed me, and when we drew apart, something I couldn\u0027t name flickered over his face as he stroked my right hand. But all he said was, \"Get some sleep, Leila. I\u0027ll return soon.\"\n After he left, I realized he\u0027d taken the time to reassure me over Szilagyi, but hadn\u0027t said a word about my thought that I was falling in love with him. Was he avoiding that topic because he was incapable of love-something I now doubted-or because my power loss had indeed made him reevaluate our relationship?\n In the very near future, I\u0027d put both possibilities to the test. I didn\u0027t want to lose Vlad, but I wouldn\u0027t start running from my problems again. I\u0027d confront them despite their potential cost, and with or without any additional abilities.\n \"Get ready, Vlad,\" I whispered into the empty room. \"This is far from over.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-68.html","bookId":2011,"book":{"id":2011,"title":"Once Burned (Night Prince #1)","description":"Storyline: \n After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person\u0027s darkest secrets through a single touch.
