{"id":16252,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. Our Den is Fortified","content":"\"Stand back! Stand back!\" shouted father, as the boys made straight for our new carpet. \"Who in the world are you?\" \"Don\u0027t you know us, uncle?\" said the eldest, shaking the water from him like a Newfoundland dog. \"The old fellow drove us from Colchester station, and actually wanted us to wait the other side of that stream till the tide went down. It wasn\u0027t likely we should do that, was it? So we just walked through. Kathleen got her shoe stuck in the mud, but she\u0027s coming along presently. Now, aren\u0027t you glad to see us, uncle?\" There was something irresistible in the impudent, freckled face turned up to father\u0027s; and although my first thought was that Rupert was decidedly ugly, I soon came to see that there was the beauty of goodness in eyes and mouth and general expression. Mother was the first to regain her self-possession. \"You naughty children,\" she said, stepping out on the lawn, \"you will catch your death of cold, and I suppose you haven\u0027t even got any other clothes to put on. Edric\u0027s won\u0027t fit any of you but Harold.\" \"Don\u0027t you fret, auntie,\" said Jack, who had been capering about, and leaving little rivulets of water wherever he went. \"We don\u0027t think anything of wet clothes, we just run about till they are dry.\" \"But where\u0027s your box?\" said father. \"It\u0027s the other side of the water,\" said Rupert, laughing; \"I know now what King John felt like when he lost all his luggage in the Wash. We lost half our things in the wash at school, and now we\u0027ve lost the other half in your Wash. My word, hasn\u0027t the tide gone down quick! The old fellow was right after all. Why, it\u0027s only up to Kathleen\u0027s ankles now. Here she comes, shoes and all. Ugh! go away, you horrid, wet girl.\" A well-aimed shoeful of water went over Jack\u0027s head, and then with a queer, uneven step, due to having one shoe off and one on, my Cousin Kathleen advanced to greet my father and mother. \"What do you think of that, Uncle John?\" she said, putting her dry arm round his neck. \"Those naughty boys left me to get on as well as I could with one foot stuck in the mud; but I\u0027ll pay them out. Ah, there\u0027s Cousin Edric,\" and there was such a change in the merry face, that a glow of pleasure spread over mine. \"We know each other already, don\u0027t we, dear? Isn\u0027t it lovely to think that we are going to be here six whole weeks? Can\u0027t you really walk, Edric?\" There was something so very funny in the whole scene, the dripping boys outside, the girl with hat thrown back and tumbled, curly hair, with skirts wet to the waist, and one shoe in her hand, that I burst out laughing. Of course, everyone joined, and it was thus that we received the savages into our home circle. But mother now interposed, and marched them all off to their bedrooms, while father sent a man in one of the carts to fetch the boxes, which the Colchester fly-driver had so unceremoniously deposited on the other side of the stream. We found out in the course of time, that the boys\u0027 school had been suddenly closed, owing to the death of the master\u0027s wife. My cousins had heard from their father that they would probably spend the summer holidays with us, and the master had thought it best to send them straight to us, taking their sister with them. The telegram which should have prepared us for their arrival, came about half an hour after we were all sitting down to tea. What a tea that was! Father was, of course, away, having merely looked in to say good-bye to me and whisper, \"Don\u0027t let the young rogues tire you, laddie; they can go upstairs to their own room. I shall be back in time to carry you to bed if you stop up a little later than usual.\" Kathleen took me under her wing at once. Her chair must be next to my sofa, and she must hand me everything I wanted. We were all ready; I had taken one or two bites of bread and butter, and saw to my surprise that none of my cousins had begun eating. \"Why are you waiting?\" asked mother. \"For grace,\" said Jack, the second boy. We had always been accustomed to say grace before and after dinner, but it never seemed to have entered our heads to say it at any other meals. I glanced at mother. \"Say it then, dear,\" she said, kindly, and Rupert said it; then they fell to and made a hearty tea. From that day forward we never forgot to give thanks for every meal which was put before us. I don\u0027t think I ate much, for I was laughing so heartily. It was quite a new phase of life to me, and my cousins seemed so possessed with the spirit of fun that it was quite infectious. \"Now, auntie, where\u0027s our den?\" said Rupert, when tea was over. \"Father had a den in Sydney. He called it his den, but it was the jolliest place in the house, except——\" \"Except when Rupert went into a rage and hit Harold, then father told him to meet him in his study, and you should have seen Rupert\u0027s face,\" interposed Jack. \"Rupert ran away and hid under the tank,\" continued Kathleen, with a broad smile on her face. \"The clergyman was staying with us, and he went to fish him out. Rupert saw him coming, and cried out, \u0027I say, Mr. Wilson, is father after you, too?\u0027 You should have heard them laugh. Of course Rupert didn\u0027t get his caning, so father\u0027s den is still the jolliest place in the house.\" \"And so will ours be,\" was the general shout as they filed upstairs behind mother. The sunshine seemed gone out of the room when they left it. I tried to go on with my reading, but I found myself listening for any sound from the tower room. It was too far away, however, for me to hear anything but the loud bang of the door at the bottom of the little staircase, so I was obliged to go back to my book with a sigh. It was not likely strong, healthy, rackety children would want poor sickly little me. \"Bo! Twopence for your thoughts, Edric. Oh, did I hurt you? I didn\u0027t know you would be really frightened. What\u0027s the matter?\" \"It\u0027s nothing,\" I said, hastily, trying to breathe quietly again, and smiling at Rupert. \"You see I am so used to being alone that a sudden noise makes me jump.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Rupert, sitting on the edge of my sofa, and swinging his legs so violently that he almost made my teeth chatter. \"What pretty hair you\u0027ve got, Edric. It is all wavy like mother\u0027s, and just the same colour. You\u0027d have made a splendid girl. There, now, I\u0027ve hurt you again, and I didn\u0027t mean to either. You\u0027ll be a big man and a clever one some day, I expect; anyway, no one can call you carrots as they do me. Halloa, Kathleen, what do you want?\" \"Let\u0027s carry Edric upstairs,\" said Kathleen; \"he can tell us where to find things;\" and, before I could say yes or no, they had taken me in their arms, so carefully, so tenderly, that after the first moment I was quite happy. \"There, captain,\" said Jack, as they pulled the long chair into the middle of the room. \"Now we want your orders. This is our castle, but what is a castle without fortifications? You might as well have a plum pudding without any plums! We\u0027ve got to barricade this place, so that the enemy can\u0027t get in unless we wish it.\" \"But if they can\u0027t get in, we can\u0027t get out,\" I said, hastily. \"Of course we can, you owl! What\u0027s the good of lovely windows like those, with old ivy climbing outside? I\u0027ve been down to the garden already that way,\" said Harold. \"But Edric can\u0027t go in and out of the window,\" said Kathleen; \"and I don\u0027t think I should care to very often; it is rather awkward with petticoats. Let us fortify the castle, but we must do it so that we can go in and out if we wish. Now, captain, tell us where to find wood.\" There was plenty to be had in the outhouses, and they worked so hard that they had made several rough defences for door and window before it was dark, and mother came up anxiously to look for me. \"How ever did you get up here, darling?\" she asked. \"By the same way that he\u0027s going back, auntie,\" and as Rupert spoke my two cousins raised me in their arms and carried me as carefully as if I were made of egg-shell china. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3279/89758.html","bookId":508,"book":{"id":508,"title":"Our Den","description":"简介： I was reading, as I generally was in those days, but the word savages made me look up.
