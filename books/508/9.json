{"id":16258,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX. The Mystery Deepens.","content":"Never had I longed so eagerly to walk, as I did that evening when all three cousins ran out of the room in pursuit of their missing brother. I had not really been anxious before, for Harold, although only nine years old, was well able to take care of himself, and I had only regretted that he would probably get into trouble again with father for disobedience. It never entered my head that he could possibly be hidden in the house, far less that he should be in the oak chest, which for all I knew was locked up. The housemaid coming in just then, I begged her to carry me up to the tower-room, putting aside for the moment the fear I had always had, before my cousins came, of trusting myself to any one but father. When we reached our den the children were standing by the chest, which was open, and was empty. \"He has been here,\" said Rupert; \"see how the things are pressed down.\" \"I don\u0027t believe he could get in,\" said I; \"it isn\u0027t long enough.\" But my doubts were silenced by Kathleen stooping and lifting from one corner a handkerchief stained with blood, which was still wet. \"This is Harold\u0027s!\" she cried. \"Whatever has happened to him!\" \"His nose has been bleeding,\" said Jack, promptly; \"you know it often does. It would be enough to make a mummy\u0027s nose bleed to be shut up in that old chest. I wish I had never told him what a splendid place it would be to hide in. It seems I\u0027m always to be at the bottom of the mischief. We shouldn\u0027t have gone in that boat if I had not suggested fishing, and Edric would still have had five fingers on each hand if I hadn\u0027t fired the gun. Now poor old Harold will get into a scrape for hiding so long, just because I went and showed him how the spring of the chest worked, after I had ferreted it out myself. Halloa, what are you about, Rupert? Don\u0027t kill me; I didn\u0027t mean any harm.\" Rupert had suddenly sprung at Jack, and seizing him by the arm almost screamed out— \"Spring, did you say? Then it can\u0027t be opened from the inside.\" In another moment Rupert had flung out the few odds and ends of old clothing which were in the bottom of the chest, and sprang into it; as he did so, his heels made a strange, hollow sound, which caught my attention. He was rather tall for his age, and had to double himself up in a way that would have delighted the heart of his gymnasium master before he could say— \"Now shut it down, quick, and I\u0027ll see if I can open it; but mind you undo the spring directly I give three knocks.\" Of course, he could do nothing; the box could only be opened from the outside by pressing the springs. We were glad enough to reply, to his signal, and release the prisoner. Then we all stood with puzzled faces looking at the open chest. \"What have you been up to?\" said a cheery voice, and never were we more relieved to see my mother. She listened gravely and quietly to our account. \"If he has really been in that box, and the handkerchief certainly seems to prove it, then some one must have got him out. Perhaps one of the servants did. Let us go and inquire. You had better all come downstairs; you look as white as the miller. There\u0027s nothing much to be frightened at, after all. If Harold were able to get out of the chest, he certainly was not smothered. As to his nose bleeding, you know that won\u0027t hurt him. Perhaps he is asleep in bed; have you looked?\" \"We\u0027ve ransacked every room in the house, and the servants have not seen him since six o\u0027clock.\" Ten o\u0027clock came, and with his usual punctuality father sounded the gong for prayers. He insisted on doing it with the outer doors wide open, so that if Harold were within earshot, he would be reminded that it was bedtime. I had never been up to evening prayers before; and as I lay with my hands clasped, I looked out for a moment to the calm summer sky. There was a glorious moon, which made a path of silver among the rhododendron bushes. It all looked very beautiful, and my heart joined with delight in the words of thanksgiving which father was speaking. Then he went on to pray that we might all be guarded through the night; I thought of Harold, and said, Amen. I had said my prayers night and morning ever since I was old enough to know Who it was to whom I owed everything, but I am sure I had never really prayed before. A change came over me that evening; God seemed nearer to me, I seemed nearer to Him, and I realised fully for the first time that He was my loving Father and King. My eyes were closed for a moment in earnest, silent prayer; when I opened them again—could it possibly be fancy?—I thought I saw a figure going swiftly down the rhododendron path. \"The ghost!\" I cried, not waiting till the family were off their knees; \"there\u0027s Jack\u0027s ghost again!\" Father ran out of the window; but, of course, as he had not seen the mysterious visitor when he came before, he did not know which way he went, and turned to the left. That gave the man a start; and although I called out to father which way to go, he did not succeed in finding any one. We all waited in intense excitement till father came back; and then the finishing touch to our evening was given by our young coachman coming in with a broad grin on his face, without even waiting to knock at the door. \"If you please, mum, Master Harold\u0027s sitting on my bed. I think he\u0027s summat light-headed, for he keeps on asking how he got there, and declares that he was in the oak chest and couldn\u0027t get out. Do you mind coming to see him, mum?\" Robert had been out all the evening with my parents, and had only had time to attend to the horse and put the carriage away when the gong sounded for prayers, so he had not been in his room, which was above the coach-house, since he dressed at four o\u0027clock. Rupert and Kathleen did a dance of delight round the table; while Jack, who was still attired in his dressing-gown, had to content himself with playing the castanets with his fingers and whistling. \"What a funny go,\" he cried, when his brother and sister had dropped breathless into the one big armchair. \"Listen! What do you say to my ghost being the one who rescued him? If so, he must have left Robert\u0027s room when you saw him, Edric. Oh dear, what a thing it is to feel like a bottle of ginger beer, and yet have to behave as if you were as flat as ditch water, owing to your stupid foot.\" Then, with his usual sensitiveness, Jack felt that he had said something which might hurt me, and hastened to mend it. \"That\u0027s my own fault, isn\u0027t it, Edric? And that\u0027s just why it\u0027s harder to bear. Virtue is its own reward, they say, and so is wickedness. Here he comes! \u0027I\u0027ve waited long for you, my man; Oh, welcome safe to land,\u0027\" he sang, gently, as Harold came in, holding mother\u0027s hand and looking rather bewildered. \"Now, young man,\" said father, \"give an account of yourself. What do you mean by disobeying me and going out of the house when you promised not, and harrowing the hearts of your brothers and sister and all your relations?\" \"Please, uncle, I didn\u0027t go out of the house,\" said Harold, earnestly. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3279/89764.html","bookId":508,"book":{"id":508,"title":"Our Den","description":"简介： I was reading, as I generally was in those days, but the word savages made me look up.
