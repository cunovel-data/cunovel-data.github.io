{"id":16259,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. How the Stranger Helped.","content":"\"Curiouser and curiouser,\" quoted Jack, from Alice in Wonderland; but we were all too astonished to laugh at his droll face. \"I specs he walked in his sleep.\" Harold looked angrily at his elder brother. \"I promised I would not go out of the house, and I didn\u0027t.\" \"Coach-house doesn\u0027t count, I suppose,\" remarked Rupert, who was, I fancy, a little annoyed by the uneasiness we had all felt. \"Don\u0027t tease him, my boy,\" said father, kindly; \"let him tell his story in his own fashion.\" Thus encouraged, Harold sat down, and told us that he had got into the oak chest to hide. \"I thought, of course, that you would hear me when I called, but you didn\u0027t seem to come into that room at all.\" \"We did go there,\" said Kathleen; \"but you know there is no place to hide there but the cupboard, and that had been left wide open by Rupert when he hid there at the beginning of the game. So we just ran up the stairs, put our heads in and saw that the room and cupboard were empty, and then ran off to what we thought were more likely places.\" \"Then that\u0027s why I did not hear your footsteps. The wood must be fearfully thick. I lay still till I began to feel suffocated, and then I tried to get out. I tried and tried, I pushed with my hands, then I lay on my back and pressed with my knees and kicked with my feet. It wasn\u0027t a bit of good, I only hurt myself and got more choky. Then my nose began to bleed, and I gave up trying, and lay with my face to the side of the chest. Oh, it was horrible, auntie! I thought that I should die; and I wondered how long you would be before you found me, and what poor father and mother would say when they heard about it.\" \"There, there, don\u0027t pile it on,\" said Jack, rubbing his hand across his eyes; \"tell us how you got out, that\u0027s what we want to know. Anyone could get in and be choked; but it\u0027s a regular Maskelyne and Cooke\u0027s dodge to get out again instead.\" \"I can\u0027t tell you, I don\u0027t remember anything till I woke up in bed in a strange room. I know now it was Robert\u0027s. Your new man gave me a sandwich and something out of a little bottle, and I——\" \"My new man?\" repeated father, with his eyes wide open. \"Why, I haven\u0027t one in the place that has been here less than five years.\" \"Oh! perhaps I made a mistake,\" said Harold, rather wearily; \"I didn\u0027t know his face, so I thought he must be a stranger. He had a white coat on like a coachman, and——\" \"Hurrah!\" cried Jack, \"my mysterious stranger went to the rescue. Could he talk English, Harold? Was he very furious?\" \"He was very kind; but he didn\u0027t speak once, I remember. He bathed my face with water out of Robert\u0027s basin, and I noticed that he kept looking out of the window. Then I heard a noise like a bell; and he went to the window, stood there a minute, then he waved his hand to me, and unlocked the door and went.\" \"Why had he locked the door?\" \"How can I tell?\" \"How did you see all this in the dark?\" \"The moon shone right in at the window. I don\u0027t know who the man was, if uncle says he was not one of the servants; but I\u0027m very tired, and don\u0027t want to talk any more.\" So we all were; but I am afraid if there had been any one sleeping in my little room I should have talked all night about our mysterious stranger. The next morning things went on much as usual, till Kathleen and Rupert came to carry me upstairs. Then you would have laughed if you could have heard all the wild guesses we made as to the identity of our strange visitor. \"Let\u0027s have a good look at that chest,\" said Rupert, when Kathleen had declared she had done with it for the present. \"Your heels made a very queer sound in it last night, Rupert,\" I said. \"Only for pity\u0027s sake let somebody sit on the edge of it whilst it is open. I don\u0027t want you to be guillotined or smothered.\" Harold perched himself in such a manner that the lid could not possibly fall, and dangled his legs against the side. It was a wonderful old chest, and we have it still in our house. It is made of black oak, is just five feet long, and about two feet wide. \"I know,\" said Rupert, presently, springing out of the box. \"Where\u0027s the foot rule?\" \"What\u0027s the joke now?\" said Harold. \"Are you going to measure it to see if there\u0027s room for the mysterious stranger to hide in?\" \"That\u0027s it,\" exclaimed Rupert, disdaining to answer his brother\u0027s remark. \"That\u0027s it. There\u0027s a false bottom to it. Look! it measures twenty inches inside and twenty-five outside. Let\u0027s break it open; we shall find a treasure, perhaps. No wonder my heels rattled when I got in last night.\" \"If it rattles,\" said Jack, sagaciously, \"there isn\u0027t much inside. But let\u0027s see if we can open it.\" They pushed and knocked in turns, but it was useless; they only grew tired and cross. For once my studious life gave me an advantage over them. I remembered that in all the wonderful tales I had read of hidden chambers and secret drawers, there was no force required to open them. I reminded my cousins of this. \"There\u0027s some little trick about it; some panel or hidden spring. You will be more likely to find it just when you least expect.\" \"Get along, you stupid old thing,\" said Harold, losing patience; \"I\u0027m sick of you.\" As he spoke he sprang from his perch and administered a kick to the obstinate box. Kathleen was holding the lid on the opposite side, and saw the bottom of the box move. \"Look, look,\" she cried, \"it is opening!\" It did not spring up, it merely stood just enough away from the box for Rupert to put his fingers under it and lift it out bodily. A low groan of disappointment escaped us all. They had pulled my chair close to the chest, and I was able to look into it as well, and certainly shared in the groan. I can\u0027t say what we had expected. It may have been gold, it may have been treasures of another kind. Most certainly we none of us had expected to see a few packets of papers, yellow with age, and covered with dust. So engrossed had we been that we had not noticed a step in the room; and when Rupert raised himself from the chest with a bundle of papers in his hand, declaring he would take them to uncle, my blood seemed to stand still and my heart almost to jump into my mouth when a voice, with a strong French accent, said— \"Not too fast, young gentleman; those papers belong to me.\" \"NOT TOO FAST, YOUNG GENTLEMAN; THOSE PAPERS BELONG TO ME.\" \"NOT TOO FAST, YOUNG GENTLEMAN; THOSE PAPERS BELONG TO ME.\" By the side of my couch, almost touching me, stood the man whom we had named Jack\u0027s Ghost!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3279/89765.html","bookId":508,"book":{"id":508,"title":"Our Den","description":"简介： I was reading, as I generally was in those days, but the word savages made me look up.
