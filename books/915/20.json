{"id":34901,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX A MISFIT BATTERY","content":"The moment his foot touched the threshold Simmons began to exclaim: \"It was perfectly great! I\u0027m awfully glad I went! He\u0027s got a peach of a canoe, and what he doesn\u0027t know about animals and reptiles and birds—\" He stopped suddenly as he caught sight of the massive form of the venerated Laughlin looming behind the door. \"Oh, excuse me, I didn\u0027t know any one was here.\" \"No one but me,\" said the visitor, \"and though I\u0027m big, I\u0027m not dangerous. Who\u0027s got the peach of a canoe?\" \"Payner,\" answered Simmons, throwing a questioning look at Owen. \"That\u0027s the fellow that\u0027s been working the plagues on the Pecks, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes,\" replied Simmons, eagerly. \"How did you know about it?\" [Pg 201] \"Oh, everybody knows something about it,\" returned Laughlin, with a grin. \"I suppose he was after material. What number has he reached now?\" \"I think he\u0027s getting ready for Number Six,\" said Simmons, gravely. \"He didn\u0027t say what it was to be, but he told me all sorts of things he might do. If he does everything he talks about he\u0027ll have to put them three at a time to keep within ten. He showed me where he got the newts he put in the clothes-bag, and where he used to catch turtles and water-snakes, and the old stumps where he dug out salamanders. He says that below the falls, on Salt River, you can catch all sorts of things when the tide\u0027s out—dip up young eels by the pailful. They\u0027d do to put in the water pitchers.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t care for them in mine,\" observed Laughlin. \"When it gets warmer there are going to be more things,\" Simmons continued, growing more confidential and serious as he proceeded. \"All sorts of bugs, for example, and hornets\u0027 nests that you can take off in the night and throw in through[Pg 202] the windows. It\u0027s easy to get half a pint of ants from any big ant hill if you only know how, and the brown-tail moth caterpillars they talk so much about—the hairs fly and are poisonous, you know—it wouldn\u0027t be at all hard to find a nest with the caterpillars just in the right stage outside the town somewhere. Then he took me into his room and showed me an enormous spider he had in a bottle—he got it from home—and asked me how I thought the Pecks would like it to find such a thing in their pajamas some night. Isn\u0027t it awful!\" Simmons stopped for breath, and looked horror-struck from face to face. \"What\u0027s it all for, anyway?\" asked Laughlin. \"Why, the Pecks ripped up his room, and spoiled some of his specimens,\" explained Rob. \"He wants them to apologize and agree to let him alone. They won\u0027t do it.\" \"Oh, I remember now,\" Laughlin said. \"One of them came to me about a month ago, and asked me what to do. I gave him a raking down for playing such fool tricks, and told him to go and apologize and try to patch it up with Payner. I[Pg 203] don\u0027t know which it was. I never could tell \u0027em apart.\" \"It was Duncan,\" said Owen. \"I gave him the same advice. He\u0027s willing to do the right thing, but the other one keeps him back.\" \"Well, let them suffer then, that\u0027s all I\u0027ve got to say,\" remarked Laughlin. \"I\u0027ve no sympathy to waste on fools or fellows who won\u0027t own up when they\u0027re in the wrong.\" The senior departed, leaving Owen comforted and reassured. He could afford to wait, he told himself after his caller had gone. Let them give Patterson to Borland if they wished. Borland couldn\u0027t manage him, Rob was convinced, and when the new combination failed, Patterson would come back to him, and the pair could start again and work up together. Then it would be clear which was the better catcher, and which battery was the more useful to the school. Yes, Laughlin was right; it was better to work one\u0027s way up than to claim a high place at the outset and afterward have to change to the lowest, like the man in the parable who was bidden to a feast. But it was hard on Pat! [Pg 204] In the meantime Simmons had disappeared. He came in again soon, and rather shamefacedly confessed that he had been laboring with the Pecks. \"What luck?\" asked Rob; \"did they bluff you?\" \"That\u0027s just what they did. Duncan laughed at me and Donald said he wasn\u0027t afraid of anything Payner could produce, either fresh or canned. I told them I merely wanted to warn them of what was before them, and Donald said the chief thing before them was to wipe up the ground with Payner. Then I said they\u0027d better look out, for Payner had a gun, and Donald said he\u0027d need it. I didn\u0027t seem to be getting on, so I cleared out.\" Owen laughed. \"You may as well let them alone. They\u0027re looking for trouble, and if they find it it\u0027s their own fault.\" That evening Duncan stopped Simmons on the way out to Front Street and thanked him for coming to warn them. \"I didn\u0027t say anything while you were there,\" he added, \"because I knew Don and I\u0027d have a big row about it, and I[Pg 205] thought our rows ought to be private. And we did have it after you went, red hot. I\u0027ll tell you on the fair, I\u0027m dead sick of the whole thing; it\u0027s got on to my nerves and spoils all my fun. We have to keep the door locked all the time, we don\u0027t dare open the windows, some one has to be here when the chambermaid comes in, and we\u0027re always scared that something\u0027s going to happen,—that there\u0027ll be some crawly thing in the bed, or under it, or hidden in our pajamas, or tucked into our shoes, or coming down the chimney. I never open a bureau drawer without standing back as far as I can, for fear of something jumping in my face. It\u0027s terrible. The sword of Damocles was nothing to it. If Payner\u0027d be satisfied with my apology, I\u0027d go in a minute!\" \"He wouldn\u0027t be,\" answered Simmons, with a sad shake of his head. The burden of anxiety for peace in the dormitory lay heavy on poor Simmons\u0027s shoulders! Does some one ask why the teachers are not called in to adjudicate such differences, or how a feud like this could go on undetected by Dr. Mann on the floor below, and Mrs. Gray, the[Pg 206] matron, making her daily rounds among the rooms? To such be it explained that except in story books and school circulars, or where small children are concerned, teachers and pupils live in two distinct worlds, between which there is lawful communication only by regular channels. No self-respecting boy above the primary age seeks faculty help against his fellows. He may consult a trusted teacher about his own affairs, his studies, his health, his morals, his religion; about his relations with other boys he may sometimes ask advice, but assistance never. In the school life he must fight fair, and the first rule of fair fighting is: No intervention, no tale-bearing, keep it among ourselves! Rob\u0027s thoughts did not linger on the affairs of the Pecks. The first real game was coming on Wednesday with the N——University nine. Rob\u0027s whole attention in the two practice days before was concentrated on learning about the play of his new position from Poole and Lyford—in fact from any one who could give him information. He knew, of course, that in theory a fielder while running for a batted ball is supposed to keep[Pg 207] in mind the positions of the base runners and anticipate their movements so that when the ball is at last in his hands he need waste no time in sending it to the right place. In putting this obvious theory into practice, though suffering from lack of experience, Rob had the advantage of his catcher\u0027s training in watching bases. In throwing in from the field, however, this catcher\u0027s training was distinctly a handicap, for the short-line throws across the diamond are very different from the long returns from the outfield. Rob could catch flies as well as any one, but he despaired of ever feeling at home in right field. Patterson took the change of catchers still more to heart. When Poole informed him of the new arrangement, he stood aghast, too much astonished to protest. But he immediately made full speed for Rob\u0027s room, and there he vowed that he should not, could not, would not pitch to Borland or any one else but Owen; they might drop him if they chose. Here Rob\u0027s newly acquired courage served him in good stead. He explained that Poole was promoting[Pg 208] Patterson to a better catcher, that he had no reason to think that Borland would not do for him quite as much as Owen could, and that in any case they must both obey orders and work for the success of the nine. Patterson listened, was half convinced, and yielded. So it happened that when the game with N——University opened, there were two players on the Seaton nine, the pitcher and the right-fielder, who felt ill at ease in their positions. The Seatonians were in the field. Big Ames was at first, in place of Weaver. Patterson, seeking to make up for lack of confidence by enforced deliberateness, slowly raised his arm and shot in the first ball. The batsman let it go and the umpire called a strike. Then came a ball and a strike in succession; and then, following Borland\u0027s signal, Patterson threw a drop, the batsman hit the ball on the upper side, sending a slow grounder toward third. Durand ran up to meet it and flung it hastily and wide to first, where Ames, stretching to his full awkward length, held it and saved an error. The next man went out on strikes, the third on an easy fly to Owen. The[Pg 209] Seatonians came in to bat, and went out as easily as their predecessors. Then in the second inning came trouble. The first man up sent a fly to Poole, and of course was out. The second was given a straight, swift ball which was called a strike; Borland signalled to repeat, but the batsman was ready this time and drove the ball out into centre field so far that he had no difficulty in taking second. The next man bunted and beat Borland\u0027s throw to first. Worried by this, Patterson sent the third man to first, on balls, and the bases were full. The batter following fouled out to Durand, and the spectators felt better. Two men out and the bases full! The new batsman came up, recognizing his opportunity clearly. The first ball looked poor, and he let it pass—a strike! The second he struck at but did not hit. Patterson held the ball and watched his catcher\u0027s signal—Straight over. It was risky, he saw plainly, and contrary to the principles laid down by Owen; but Borland was supposed to know, and it would really be a feather in his cap[Pg 210] to strike out the third man with the bases full. And he put it straight over. Crack! sounded the bat. With a start Patterson wheeled about and watched the ball soar over Sudbury\u0027s head and bound far away in the tennis nets. The batsman raced around the bases, touching the plate just as the ball reached Patterson once more. Four men had scored on the hit! The next man went easily out, but Patterson was not to be comforted. He blamed himself; but of this he was sure, if Owen had been behind the plate the thing would never have happened. \"Never take chances with the bases full,\" Owen had always preached, and Patterson, as he sat scowling on the bench, thought of his four spare balls and groaned in bitterness of spirit. Durand got a hit, Owen went to first on balls, and Ames brought one of them in, but Patterson was not encouraged. In the next inning he let his opponents make three hits that yielded two runs, and at the beginning of the fourth O\u0027Connell appeared in his place in the pitcher\u0027s box. How it happened that Seaton won that game in spite of the handicap of five runs at the fourth[Pg 211] inning was explained in various ways. Some said O\u0027Connell\u0027s pitching had held the enemy down; others that luck and good fielding by Seaton and bad errors on the part of the visitors were the chief causes. All agreed that the nine had shown an encouraging ability to hit the ball and play an uphill game. Such consolation as Owen was able to give during their intermittent presence together on the bench, Patterson received with stolidity and monosyllables. He was meditating a radical move. After the game was over he sought out Poole. \"Borland told me to pitch that ball,\" he said abruptly to the captain. \"I could have struck that man out.\" \"I\u0027m sorry you didn\u0027t, then,\" replied the captain, good-naturedly. \"I don\u0027t count it against you. You\u0027ll have better luck next time. Besides, when you\u0027ve had more practice with Borland you\u0027ll understand each other better.\" \"I\u0027m not going to have any more practice with Borland,\" replied Patterson, quietly. \"If you ever want me to pitch again, you must give me Owen to catch me. I\u0027ll pitch to no one else.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1912/54999.html","bookId":915,"book":{"id":915,"title":"With Mask and Mitt","description":"简介： If, for the beginning of this story, the reader finds himself carried back to the middle of In the Line, let him not suspect a twice-told tale.
