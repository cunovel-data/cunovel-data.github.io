{"id":34882,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE","content":"The author has but a word to say in offering \"With Mask and Mitt\" to his boy readers. The book follows \"In the Line\" and precedes \"The Great Year\" in the sequence of the series. While it repeats no incidents of previous books and covers wholly new ground in athletics, it will be found not dissimilar to its predecessors in its general spirit and character. A good juvenile must be one approved by the parent, enjoyed by the boy, and read with profit by both. It should, of course, interest and amuse; it should also help the parent to understand the impulses and the mental attitude of the boy, and the boy to accept the ideals of the parent. If \"With Mask and Mitt\" does not meet these requirements, it has at least been written with a full knowledge of their importance. Thanks must again be expressed to Dr. E.H. Nichols of Boston for cordially rendered assistance in the technicalities and theory of the game of which he is an unquestioned master. ALBERTUS T. DUDLEY.
