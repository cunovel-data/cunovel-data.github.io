{"id":34884,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II HAIL TO THE PITCHER","content":"The two Terryville lads roomed apart. Owen had already engaged his room in Hale before Carle decided to accompany him to Seaton; the latter found cheaper quarters in Carter. The difference in character between the two boys appeared in the experiences of their first days in school. Before the first Sunday Ned seemed to be on friendly terms with every fellow in the entry. Rob, on the other hand, hardly knew the names of the occupants of his own floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n The most interesting of Owen\u0027s neighbors were Donald and Duncan Peck, two lively specimens belonging to his own class and section, as indistinguishable and mischievous a brace of twins as ever looked upon the world as a happy hunting-ground, and on the inhabitants thereof as fair game. The tales concerning the Pecks passed on[Pg 12] by his room-mate Simmons, Rob considered barefaced attempts to impose on his simplicity. Later he found that many of them were true. Between the room which he occupied and that of the twins lay, according to one informant, a natural feud. At least such had prevailed the year before in the days of Tompkins, Rob\u0027s predecessor. He was advised by Lindsay, the football man who roomed opposite, to ignore this fact and avoid a continuance of the custom; and the stories in circulation concerning the amenities of Tompkins and the Pecks seemed to prove that the advice was both kindly and sound. Beyond Lindsay came Payner, a little, saturnine, black-haired, dark-visaged lower middler from the extreme Southwest; and opposite Payner the two Moons. The other room on the floor was tenanted by a dull-witted toiler named Smith. With Smith an unfeeling Faculty had yoked Crossett, a volatile senior, who spent as little time as possible in the society of his room-mate. Durand shared Lindsay\u0027s quarters. \\n\\n \\n\\n Payner was no ordinary individual. In recitation, Rob was informed, he halted and stumbled,[Pg 13] pretending to know what he evidently did not know, and receiving corrections with an ungracious if not defiant air. Outside he cultivated a morose and forbidding manner, and went his solitary way as if he scorned society. Whether this unsociability was due to homesickness or sensitiveness or a naturally ugly disposition, Rob was for a considerable time in doubt. He was at first inclined to charge it up against homesickness, feeling himself for a time the forlornness of his exile from the home circle, and the burden of his independence. At the end of a fortnight, however, when all trace of discontent had vanished from Owen\u0027s mind, Payner remained as sour and taciturn as ever. Rob next ascribed the fellow\u0027s conduct to shyness, and put himself to some inconvenience to show himself friendly. All to no purpose; Payner\u0027s only salutation was still a niggardly nod of the head and a scowl. He then tried to make a call on pretence of borrowing a book; Payner merely projected his head through the partly opened door and remarked that he had no books to lend. Thus repeatedly discouraged, Rob gave up his benevolent attempts[Pg 14] in disgust; the fellow was too disagreeable to waste a thought upon! \\n\\n \\n\\n With Lindsay he got on much better, though as the football season advanced the senior became more and more absorbed in the work of the eleven, and had less time for incidental acquaintances. Lindsay\u0027s visitors especially interested the newcomer; they were such important characters in the school that he soon came to know them by sight, though they, of course, had no interest in him. Among them were Ware, the manager of the eleven, Hendry, a football player, and big, serious Laughlin, the captain of the team, who appeared but occasionally in the dormitory until near the end of the season, when the conferences in Lindsay\u0027s room became frequent. Of the non-football players no one seemed to Owen more wholly desirable as a friend than Poole, the captain of the nine. He was a straight, dark, wiry fellow of average height and weight, with an open face and an air of quiet confidence and simple honesty and unaffected common sense combined visibly with energy and principle. According to Lindsay, Poole pos[Pg 15]sessed all the admirable qualities except brilliancy. Being but a fair scholar and compelled to work hard for whatever he learned, his classroom performances were not extraordinary and he was not distinguished either as a speaker or as a writer. At the first school meeting, however, Owen learned that Poole\u0027s utterances, though lacking in finish, were listened to with greater respect than those of almost any one else; and in all the sub-surface carping and criticism, which is as prevalent in the school world as elsewhere, Poole was more often spared than other conspicuous characters. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hear you are a catcher,\" said the captain one morning, about a fortnight after the opening of school. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I\u0027ve caught a little,\" replied Owen, modestly. \"How did you find that out?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, your friend Carle told me. He says he has pitched a good deal. Is he good?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s all right!\" Owen made haste to say in the hopelessly vague, yet emphatic phrase of the day. \"He\u0027s the best pitcher of his age I\u0027ve ever seen! He\u0027s got speed, curves, and fine control. He\u0027s had a lot of experience, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 16] \\n\\n \\n\\n Poole\u0027s expressive face beamed with delight. A man who could really pitch and had had good experience was just what he was on the lookout for. In a moment, however, the radiance had passed away and a dubious shade settled into its place. Terryville High School and the famous Seaton Academy were two very different places. Poole had known other much-vaunted performers on high school teams who had not \"made good\" on the Seaton field. It was a question of standard of play. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What kind of teams has he faced?\" he asked, with doubt showing in both countenance and voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n Owen understood very well the suspicion that lay behind the question. \"Good ones, some of them, and some poor,\" he answered dryly, smothering the sharp retort that sprang to his lips. \"We played other nines besides the high schools. Carle had as good coaching as any young fellow can get. Mike McLennan of the ——\u0027s has had him in hand for several years.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Poole caught his breath, and his eyes danced with joy. A pitcher coached by the famous pro[Pg 17]fessional whose name appeared as often in the newspapers, if not as honorably, as that of President Eliot or a member of the cabinet! Here was a find indeed! But suddenly a horrible suspicion laid hold of him. He seized Owen by the arm and swung him round so as to bring his face close to his own. \"Tell me straight now,\" he demanded with an earnestness that was almost stern, and looking squarely into Owen\u0027s eyes. \"I want the truth right now and all the truth. Is his record clear? Has he ever been paid for pitching, directly or indirectly, or been hired by hotels to play summer ball, or been given expense money in a lump so that he could clear a margin—or done anything of the sort? If he\u0027s got anything in his record against him, or if he\u0027s the least bit crooked or shady, I want to know it before I tackle him. We can\u0027t have any questionable men on our teams.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rob\u0027s first impulse was to be angry, his second to laugh aloud; but Poole\u0027s earnestness was contagious, and his own second thoughts assured him that the captain\u0027s suspicion was natural and his object wholly praiseworthy. Rob had seen some[Pg 18]thing of the malodorous borderland that lies between amateur and professional. McLennan\u0027s vulgarity he could put up with, because of McLennan\u0027s marvellous skill in his business. But the third-rater and the semi-professional, who represents a fair laborer or mechanic eternally spoiled to make a poor ball player, and in whom is the essence of all that is lowest and most evil in athletic associations, he viewed with unwavering contempt. So it was with cordiality and inward approval that he looked directly back into Poole\u0027s dark, fiercely shining eyes and answered confidently: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His record\u0027s as clear as yours. He\u0027s had chances to play for money and refused them. McLennan advised him to keep clear of it until he was through school.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Poole dropped his arm. \"I\u0027m mighty glad to hear that. Of course we shall have to look him up, but what you say reassures me. You used to catch him, didn\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, usually,\" replied Owen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got a good catcher now,\" said the captain, \"but we want good men for other positions. Did you ever play in the infield?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 19] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not much,\" answered Owen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you must come out and try for the nine anyway,\" concluded the captain, turning away. \"There\u0027ll be chance enough for any one who knows the game and can hit the ball.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Owen had an attack of homesickness after that interview which he found some difficulty in shaking off. The Terryville battery had always been Carle and Owen. The Seaton battery was to be Carle and somebody else! It was only a pitcher that Poole wanted; it evidently had not even occurred to him to raise the question whether the new man could possibly be better than the Seaton catcher. And Carle,—well, Carle was friendly, of course, and wished him well, but Carle could hardly be depended on to glorify his old catcher at his own expense. Carle would surely be on the popular side, whatever that was, and would think pretty much as those in authority thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Try for the infield!\" thought Owen to himself, angrily. \"What experience have I ever had in the infield? Here I\u0027ve been playing behind the bat ever since I was old enough to hold a ball, and they tell me to try the infield! I\u0027m willing[Pg 20] to try for anything, of course, or play anywhere they want me, or not play at all; and if they\u0027ve got a better catcher than I am, I\u0027m glad of it, but they might at least say they\u0027d give me a show in the position I\u0027m used to! Well, it\u0027s months to the season anyway. I suppose I came here to study and not to play ball, so what\u0027s the use of worrying? Father would probably rather have me out of it altogether.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With these inconsequent and not altogether comforting reflections Rob Owen took down his books. \\n\\n \\n\\n Poole and Borland, the catcher, soon had Carle out for a trial. The pitcher took ten minutes to warm up, but by the end of that time he was throwing all kinds of fast and slow balls as Borland demanded, and putting them over according to the catcher\u0027s suggestions. Poole could hardly moderate the expression of his joy into reasonably temperate approval. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not used to Borland,\" said Carle, as if to excuse his performance, as he pulled on his sweater and the trio started down toward the gymnasium. \"Owen has always caught me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 21] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How is Owen—good?\" asked the captain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pretty fair,\" said Carle, yielding to the temptation to enhance his own glory by depreciating his mate. \"We always worked well together. I presume I shall do as well with Borland.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope so,\" said Borland. \\n\\n \\n\\n And Poole said nothing, but he told Lindsay and Laughlin that night in secret that he had found the pitcher who was going to win for them the Hillbury game. Whereat Lindsay and Laughlin congratulated him heartily and turned again to the problem of guard defensive play on an end run which they had been eagerly discussing. Seaton brooks but one great athletic interest at a time. \\n\\n \\n\\n The football season drew toward its end. As the eagerness of the school warmed to fever heat, Rob had new lessons as to school enthusiasm, and old ambitions sprang into new life. As he stood on the benches at the Hillbury game,—for he stood far more than he sat,—and cheered himself hoarse over the deeds of his heroes, these ambitions grew stronger and more definite. He laid his tired head on the pillow after the evening\u0027s[Pg 22] celebration with all the separate impressions of the day focussed in one deep, absorbing longing. What Laughlin and Lindsay and Durand and Hendry and the rest had done that day for their schoolmates on the football field, that he would like to share in accomplishing on the diamond. \"Any place, anywhere,\" he muttered, as his eyes closed, \"just a fair chance to show what I can do!\" And he dropped off to sleep with the words still on his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n dormitories \\n\\n \\n\\n School Dormitories \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1912/54982.html","bookId":915,"book":{"id":915,"title":"With Mask and Mitt","description":"简介： If, for the beginning of this story, the reader finds himself carried back to the middle of In the Line, let him not suspect a twice-told tale.
