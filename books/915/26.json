{"id":34907,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXV AS WALLY SAW IT","content":"Proud as a king, and happy as a king rarely is, Wally sat on the players\u0027 bench and stared at the throngs pouring in through the entrances and flooding the seats. On the fence over by the woods, like sparrows crowded close on a telegraph wire, was strung a line of twittering and jostling youngsters, let in by a wise manager who preferred to have them safely quiet inside rather than uproariously disorderly without. And every one of the shrill flock sooner or later fastened his eyes on Wally and demanded the reason for their comrade\u0027s elevation to the company of the gods. \\n\\n \\n\\n Such a question must, of course, be answered. Whether the answer is correct or not is of minor consequence. Some said Wally was a mascot; others that Poole was sweet on his sister; while still others were able to give melodramatic accounts of Wally\u0027s rescue of the captain from the[Pg 277] desperate gang of upper middlers who had \"pinched\" him. While the argument on these points was going forward, the advance scouts of the fence brigade discovered signs of the arrival of the nines, and Skinny Flick, waving his tattered cap, led a high-pitched imitation of the long Seaton cheer, weirdly shrill and yet true and even and united. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can those little boys do it so well?\" asked Margaret Sedgwick, amused at the unexpected prelude. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Practised it, I suppose,\" replied Mr. Sedgwick, indifferently. \\n\\n \\n\\n And Wally not being on hand to set forth the true relations of things, Miss Margaret accepted her father\u0027s explanation, and gave the soprano cheerers full credit for patriotic forethought. As a matter of fact their facility had been as unconsciously acquired as the street ragtime which a dignified adult is shocked to find himself whistling. The Seaton urchin begins to hear the school cheers as soon as his legs are strong enough to take him where students gather or heroes battle. Classes pass before him as the generations of men[Pg 278] before the aged Nestor. There were boys on that fence who could already have repeated the Seaton battle cries when fellows who were now leaders of elevens and nines in Yale and Harvard and Princeton and Dartmouth had just set foot in the Seaton streets. The gamin\u0027s term of instruction is long; so the cheer from the fence had the true ring. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was likewise well timed. A minute later the four cheer-leaders on the Seaton side were swinging their arms and swaying their bodies in a convulsion of energy, as they led in the first great welcome to their team; while at the heels of the Seaton players came the Hillbury nine, waking into enthusiasm the whole solid phalanx of blue. And here unquestionably was the first evil omen for Seaton hopes. Every Hillbury student produced a megaphone and turned it toward the Seaton side; the volume of Hillbury\u0027s cheer was multiplied by three. What a handicap! What a depressing evidence of Hillbury superiority! \\n\\n \\n\\n But something more than noise was necessary to depress Wally; his optimism was not to be extinguished by megaphones. The Seaton players went out for their preliminary practice. Lyford[Pg 279] batted to the outfield, Borland to the in-; Rob stood at the plate, caught the returns, and joined in the cross-diamond throwing. Lyford was directing the practice, but even Wally could see how the infield followed the catcher\u0027s leading and instinctively looked for his suggestion. Nor was this remarkable. The players were feeling the strain of the situation. Sudbury had just missed an easy fly that he ought to have held; Hayes had made a bad mess of a grounder; Durand had sent a ball to first that had defied Ames\u0027s long reach. Nervousness was in the air, but Owen stood smiling and steady, taking the balls with an easy grace that had in it no sign of ostentation, throwing straight and swift, cheering into confidence by his very presence and attitude. \"We\u0027ve got an awfully good catcher, anyway,\" thought Wally, proudly, as he squirmed on the seat and tried at the same time to watch all the Seaton fielders, and the Hillbury players tossing the ball to and fro near their bench, and the two captains talking with the umpire. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently Hillbury took the field and Wally now had a harder task, for there were the Hillbury[Pg 280] men to be observed and compared with their predecessors, while Patterson was warming up with Owen over by the backstop, and must have sympathetic attention. Rob had borrowed Ames\u0027s mitt to use as a plate, and over this Patterson was pitching, unsteady at first with the tension of the strange conditions, but soon settling down under Owen\u0027s soothing guidance. When Rob found that his pitcher had himself sufficiently in hand to be able to place the ball pretty accurately over one side of the mitt or the other, he called to him to stop. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re all right, Pat!\" he declared, dropping his arm on his companion\u0027s shoulder as they walked back to join their mates on the bench. \"It\u0027s all there; you\u0027ll pitch your best game to-day. Don\u0027t hurry now, and don\u0027t worry; and don\u0027t forget to back up first whenever you can get over there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Patterson nodded; there was nothing for him to say. He was content to leave the results in Owen\u0027s hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We go out!\" announced Poole, coming up with a smile on his face. \"All ready, Pat?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Patterson gave a sign of assent. \"Yes, he\u0027s[Pg 281] ready,\" said Owen. \"Here\u0027s your mitt, Ames. This is one of the days when we can cut it every time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Hillbury players came in, the Seatonians scattered to their positions. The supporters cheered for their school and their captain; then for the captain of the other team. \u0027Tis a fine custom of the Seaton-Hillbury rivalry which the colleges might well imitate. The Hillbury megaphones bellowed a response. The umpire threw down a new white ball which Patterson coolly scrubbed in the dirt outside the box, while Michael, the head of the Hillbury batting list, took his place by the plate. The game was on! \\n\\n \\n\\n Owen crouched and signalled with his fingers between his knees. Patterson answered with an out that threatened to strike Michael on the shoulder, but swung in over the inside of the plate. The batsman stepped back and the umpire called a strike. The next one was high and wide and out of reach; Michael did not bite. One ball! For the third effort Patterson stepped to the left and threw a swift one that cut the inside corner of the plate at an angle—or would have cut it,[Pg 282] if it had been allowed to take its course. Michael struck at it and knocked it into Patterson\u0027s hands. Long Ames had the ball before Michael was halfway down the line. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hood, the Hillbury shortstop, who had been standing by, swinging two bats like a professional, now strode up, thumped the ground with his chosen stick, and looked valiantly at the pitcher. The first ball, a drop, he struck at and fouled. The second he misjudged and let go by. \"Strike Two!\" The third and fourth were tempters which he resisted. Then came one which he fancied. With sudden impulse he struck hard at it, but even as he struck, the ball slammed in Owen\u0027s trusty mitt. \\n\\n \\n\\n A strike out! Two men gone! The Seaton cheer-leaders were busy again, and with contorted faces and fierce arm swings goaded on their company of howlers. Hillbury answered with a blast of megaphones, as Coy, their centre fielder, appeared at the plate. The first ball pitched appealed to him; he struck at it and sent a low bounder toward third. For just an instant Durand juggled it and then threw straight to Ames,[Pg 283] but Coy was fast and the umpire called him safe. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kleindienst, the Hillbury captain, came up, eager to make a hit that would help the runner round the bases. Thanks to Poole\u0027s note-book, and information gathered from many sources, Owen knew what to call for. The first pitch was a swift breast-high ball off the inner corner of the plate; Kleindienst smote and smote in vain. \"Now Coy will steal,\" thought Rob, and signalled for an out. Coy did steal and Kleindienst tried to hit at the same time, but all he succeeded in accomplishing was to catch the ball on the end of his bat and drive it in easy bounds to Ames, making the third out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to get a hit, Mac,\" said Poole, as McPherson picked up his bat. \"Don\u0027t bite at the teasers. Make \u0027em put \u0027em over!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Now McPherson meant to do that very thing, but the first one was so plausible that even though it wasn\u0027t just what he wanted, McPherson could not resist the temptation to try it. The result was a pop foul that Kleindienst gathered in off third base. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 284] \\n\\n \\n\\n Poole was second on the list, and Poole waited; one ball! two balls! a foul! three balls! two strikes! At the next Poole dropped his bat and started for first, and the umpire did not say him nay. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now it was Owen\u0027s turn to face O\u0027Brien, and he tried to sacrifice, but the bunt rolled over the line, and his attempt came to naught. O\u0027Brien was careful now, and gave him high balls that he could not bunt, and kept them well out of his reach. Two had been called balls and one a strike, when Rob\u0027s chance came. The ball was a trifle too far in, but he drew back a little as he struck, and drove a liner over second baseman\u0027s head out into the ground between centre and right. Poole went to third, and Rob was safe at second. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was Rorbach\u0027s turn. He knew what he was expected to do without the spur implied in the sudden roar of greeting from the benches, followed by tense, expectant silence. O\u0027Brien sought to work him with seductive outs, but Rorbach waited. Three balls and one strike brought the pitcher to reason; he couldn\u0027t afford to pass a[Pg 285] man with two on bases. So Rorbach got one where he could hit it, and lifted the ball in a splendid long arch far out into right field. The cheer-leaders caught their breath and, forgetful of their duties, silently watched it fly. Was it a home run? It would have been if some one else than Furness had guarded the Hillbury right field. Furness started almost as soon as the ball, and racing backward toward the fence, turned as the ball was just going over his head and pulled it down. Rorbach was out, but Poole came home easily on the throw-in, and Owen wisely paused at third. \\n\\n \\n\\n Long Ames now appeared at the plate, brandishing his bat in the clumsy fashion which had aroused so much merriment along the benches in that first game of the season. No one made merry over it to-day. The anxious Hillburyites thought only of the possibility of another hit, while the Seatonians\u0027 hopes now hung on the derided man\u0027s bat. And Ames, who cared nothing whether they derided or not, fixed his eyes on the pitcher and waited. One he let go by without offering at it; the second he fouled; the next proved a second ball, the fourth another strike. Still he waited,[Pg 286] clutching his bat a hand\u0027s-breadth from the end, with his lank figure bent awkwardly forward toward the plate. The fifth pitch was to his liking; with a short, quick stroke he chopped the ball in a safe little liner over third baseman\u0027s head, and galloped away to first, while Owen gleefully trotted home. Then Durand went out on an infield hit, and the first inning was over. \\n\\n \\n\\n Such luck, of course, could not last, but the exhilaration engendered by these two runs carried the Seaton players safely through several innings. The second, with the tail-end of the list at bat on either side, was quickly over. In the third Poole led off with a hit, reaching second on an error, but got no farther. In the fourth sprinter Coy got to first on balls, but was thrown out by two yards when he tried to steal second; and the Hillbury captain, after making a clean hit, was forced at second by Webster\u0027s unlucky drive to Hayes, which resulted in a double play. By this time O\u0027Brien had settled down into his best gait, and his best Poole\u0027s company found far too good. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the other hand, Hillbury seemed to be finding Patterson less puzzling. The Seaton fielders[Pg 287] had work a-plenty. In the sixth Poole ran far back for a long fly from Michael\u0027s bat, cutting off what to the uproarious rooters on the Hillbury side seemed surely a three-base hit; and Hood\u0027s hard liner, that promised almost as much, was gloriously taken just inside third by Durand. The third Hillburyite hit over Ames\u0027s head, and reached second only to be left there when his successor was retired on a foul fly. The Seatonians in their turn went tamely out in order; not a single one reached first. \\n\\n \\n\\n A thrill of apprehension passed through the ranks of red and gray as Webster opened the seventh with a slow grounder to Hayes, which the Seaton shortstop fumbled. Two runs are not great margin when a heavy-hitting team opens up on a pitcher, especially if that pitcher be, like Patterson, comparatively inexperienced. A couple of good hits, with an error or two and a base on balls, would quickly wipe out the slight advantage. Only steady playing and the steadiest kind of pitching could save the game, if the Hillbury sluggers showed themselves at all equal to their reputation. So thought many a timid[Pg 288] Seaton sympathizer, whose hopes of victory had been excited by the success of the first inning. Wally was not of these doubters. He knew full well that a man who reaches first does not necessarily reach second or third. Webster was at first; the only question was how and where he was to be stopped. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now Wally did not see Owen signal to Ames, nor recognize the object of the swift, wide ball which Patterson next threw; but he did see Owen\u0027s arm come back like a spring and snap instantly forward; he likewise saw Ames gather in the ball and swing with it suddenly on Webster, who was leaping back to first; and he understood well the gesture by which the umpire called Webster in. The Seaton crowd shouted with unexpected joy, but Wally\u0027s surprise was only partial; he had expected to see the runner thrown out at second. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Ribot struck under one of Patterson\u0027s jumps and sent the ball far up in the air. Rob snatched off his mask and watched the returning sphere, relieved to see it descending on McPherson\u0027s side of second. Ribot was out, and O\u0027Brien[Pg 289] brought the inning to a close by giving Durand a chance at another pop fly. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Seaton hitters had no better luck. Hayes got his base on balls, but Patterson forced him at second, and was himself put out on the play, while McPherson flied out. Here was little encouragement for those who looked for more Seaton runs! \\n\\n \\n\\n Furness started the eighth with a drive past second, which by bounding over Sudbury\u0027s shoulder enabled the runner to make two bases. Rounds, the last man of the Hillbury list, was counted an easy victim, but instead of striking out as he was expected to do, he hit the ball over Durand\u0027s head. Poole got it back in season to cut off any attempt at crossing the plate, but the awful fact remained that with only two runs needed to tie the score, Hillbury had men on first and third, with no one out and the heavy hitters coming on. A double now would bring in two men. Even Wally acknowledged to himself that he did not see how they were going to get out of that hole, while the dubious on the Seaton benches were sadly thinking that the game was lost. The fatal eighth was here! \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 290] \\n\\n \\n\\n A ball! two balls! Then Michael\u0027s bat cracked and the ball shot toward Hayes, struck well, and bounded into his hands. He gave but a glance at third—where Furness was lingering, hoping to draw a hasty throw to the plate, and so get Michael safely to first—then threw to McPherson, who had covered second. Rounds was thus forced out. Meantime Furness had made a late start for home, trusting to McPherson\u0027s slowness and probable confusion. But McPherson, who was neither slow nor confused, sent the ball directly to the plate, where Owen received it safely. Furness, while still ten feet away, stopped and wheeled about; but Owen ran him down, then turned sharply, steadied himself, and drove the ball with all his strength to McPherson. Michael had passed first on the plays and was sliding into second; the ball in McPherson\u0027s hands touched him before he reached the base. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a fraction of a minute it was all over. The umpire was signalling to Michael that he was out; Poole and Rorbach had started in from their positions; Owen was unbuckling his protector. Still Patterson stood and stared, unable to believe that[Pg 291] his rescue was complete. And then, like the explosion set off by an electric spark, the audience waked to the situation. The whole Seaton company rose en masse, waving arms and hats and banners, and sent forth a formless, exultant roar; while the recreant cheer-leaders turned their backs on their chorus and danced frantic jigs before the benches. \\n\\n \\n\\n So ended the first half of the eighth, with the score two to nothing. The Seatonians were soon disposed of. Poole, over-eager, struck out. Owen hit to O\u0027Brien and was thrown out at first. Rorbach made a pretty single into centre field, but came to grief when he tried to stretch it into a two-bagger. Hillbury came in for the last trial! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only three outs!\" thought Wally, complacently. \"Only three outs now!\" ran the whisper along the Seaton benches, but expressed in timid hope rather than in confidence. Runs might precede those outs; these Hillbury men could not forever be checked on the bases. The courage rose when Hood sent Durand an easy chance, and was out at first. Then Coy bunted safely,[Pg 292] and took second when Patterson threw wide to Ames. Kleindienst hit to Patterson, and was put out at first, while Coy was held on second. Two out, but a man on second! The spectators drew labored breaths; the cheer-leaders on either side, fearing to add to the strain upon their champions, hung silent on the scene before them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Webster, after two balls and two strikes, caught one on the end of his bat and sent it just out of Hayes\u0027s reach. On this scratch hit Coy was advanced to third. Again men on first and third, this time with two out! Ribot was at bat, nerved and resolute; and Rob felt a dread—almost a conviction—that a ball within his reach would be hit safely. On the other hand, in the desperate situation in which Hillbury stood, Webster was bound to steal, so as to make two runs possible in case of a hit. Patterson waited for his catcher\u0027s signal. The game hinged on Owen\u0027s decision. An error in judgment, a fault in execution, and the peril which had been warded off for nine long innings would be upon them. A tie at this stage, Rob knew, would mean defeat. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 293] \\n\\n \\n\\n He called for a swift, wide ball. Webster feinted a start, hoping to draw a useless throw to second that would let Coy in. Rob hesitated, took a step forward, and pretended to throw; then wheeled and sent the ball to Durand. Coy was nailed as he scrambled back to the base—and the game was won. \\n\\n \\n\\n The score:— \\n\\n \\n\\n Seaton \\n\\n ab r bh po a e \\n\\n McPherson, 2b 4 0 1 4 3 0 \\n\\n Poole, lf 3 1 2 2 0 0 \\n\\n Owen, c 4 1 1 4 4 0 \\n\\n Rorbach, rf 4 0 1 1 0 0 \\n\\n Ames, 1 b 3 0 1 10 0 0 \\n\\n Durand, 3 b 3 0 1 4 1 1 \\n\\n Sudbury, cf 3 0 0 1 0 0 \\n\\n Hayes, ss 2 0 0 1 3 1 \\n\\n Patterson, p 3 0 0 0 3 1 \\n\\n — — — — — — \\n\\n Totals 29 2 7 27 14 3 \\n\\n Hillbury \\n\\n ab r bh po a e \\n\\n Michael, lf 4 0 0 1 0 0 \\n\\n Hood, ss 4 0 0 2 3 0 \\n\\n Coy, cf 3 0 2 1 1 0 \\n\\n Kleindienst, 3 b 4 0 0 1 2 1 \\n\\n Webster, 1 b 4 0 3 11 0 0 \\n\\n Ribot, c 3 0 0 4 0 0 \\n\\n O\u0027Brien, p 3 0 0 1 3 0 \\n\\n Furness, rf 3 0 1 1 0 0 \\n\\n Rounds, 2 b 3 0 1 2 2 1 \\n\\n — — — — — — \\n\\n Totals 31 0 7 24 11 2 \\n\\n \\n\\n Seaton 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 —2 \\n\\n Hillbury 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0—0 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1912/55005.html","bookId":915,"book":{"id":915,"title":"With Mask and Mitt","description":"简介： If, for the beginning of this story, the reader finds himself carried back to the middle of In the Line, let him not suspect a twice-told tale.
