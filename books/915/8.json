{"id":34889,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII FACILIS DESCENSUS","content":"Carle joined the Omega Omicron. This was evident, even before the acquisition of the distinctive hatband, from the furious and absorbing intimacy which he developed with a certain coterie of fellows belonging to the fraternity. A dispassionate observer—Mr. Graham, for instance—would have perceived two distinct strains in the membership of the Omicron: an extravagant set of sports, courting a reputation for fastness; and a steadier, wiser, more manly group of well-to-do fellows who fell in naturally with others possessing similar monthly allowances, without adopting their views or their principles. It was this latter element which procured for the fraternity the countenance of the faculty. If any member of the Omicron had been asked—by his father, let us say, for no[Pg 67] student would have ventured upon such dangerous ground—what kind of fellows belonged to the society, he would have answered emphatically \"mighty nice fellows.\" And the answer would have been in the main true, for the tendency toward conformity is strong in boys, often holding in temporary check the individual instinct which is destined to make the character of the man; and boy loyalty is notorious. But between Durand and Hendry, who represented the best of the Omicron, and Jones and Nicholson, who led the fast set, there was as much real difference as between blades of wheat and blades of grass. Poole and Lindsay belonged to another fraternity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better look after your pitcher,\" said Durand one morning to Poole. \"He\u0027s getting in debt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Poole stopped short in his walk and stared in amazement into his companion\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just what I say,\" returned Durand, soberly. \"He\u0027s borrowing and running bills.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 68] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where does he borrow? Well, Jones and Stratton are two he\u0027s borrowed from. There may be more. He\u0027s running bills at one drug store anyway, and I think with two of those out-of-town agents that show things down at Perkins\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you look after him?\" demanded Poole, angrily. \"He belongs to your bunch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Durand shrugged his shoulders. \"I\u0027m not his guardian. I don\u0027t run the Omicron, either, as I\u0027ve told you before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You ought to!\" retorted Poole. \"What did you get him in there for anyway?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t get him in. In fact, and between ourselves, I voted against him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should think you might have helped him along anyway, or at least not let your gang lead him off. You knew he was a scholarship man and hadn\u0027t money to throw away. Why didn\u0027t you stop him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I did try to, Phil; honestly, I did,\" returned Durand, at last becoming warm; \"but what could I do against all you fellows flattering him and praising him and kowtowing to him as if he[Pg 69] were a little tin god? You don\u0027t suppose he cares anything for my opinion, do you? You don\u0027t suppose that Jones and Stratton and Nicholson are going to throw around less money because he\u0027s with \u0027em, do you? Not on your life!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Poole thought a few moments in silence. Then he looked up with a smile and dropped his hand on his friend\u0027s shoulder. \"I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s as bad as you make out,\" he said. \"You always were prejudiced against the fellow, you and Lindsay too; and I think I know why. Owen\u0027s soured because he can\u0027t catch Carle here as he did at home. That made him throw over O\u0027Connell in a sulky fit; and now, I suppose, he runs down Carle, and you fellows in Hale take his opinion.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Durand was listening with lips parted and eyes set in a stare of astonishment. \"Well, of all the crazy ideas that is the limit! Owen has never, so far as I\u0027ve known, said one word against Carle to any one. He did say why he changed O\u0027Connell for Patterson. Patterson wanted to learn, and O\u0027Connell couldn\u0027t be taught because[Pg 70] he knew it all without telling. You\u0027re entirely off about the whole business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope I am,\" said Poole. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the way, have you seen Owen catch?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course. I look in on him every now and then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you think of him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A good, fair man. I was counting on him and O\u0027Connell as second-string battery, but he doesn\u0027t seem to want the job.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you heard him coaching Patterson?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, yes, I suppose so. There was nothing remarkable about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Durand laughed a provoking, mysterious, sententious laugh, waved his hand, and disappeared into his dormitory entry, leaving Poole to meditate on the conversation. The meditation concerned but one subject, the possible difficulties of the popular pitcher. Of Owen, he did not think again. \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain\u0027s first active step was to make inquiries among the upper middlers concerning Carle\u0027s standing. The answers were various, depending largely upon the standard of the boy[Pg 71] questioned. A few whose own records were high, or who remembered some especially striking failures on the part of Carle, were of the opinion that he was falling in rank. The great majority of middle weights considered him, in general, good. After this investigation Poole had an interview with Carle himself, who protested that he was \"all right,\" declared that his debts didn\u0027t amount to anything, and avowed the most superior principles. \\n\\n \\n\\n Poole returned home reassured. When he met Durand in the afternoon he reported the results of his investigations, and jeered at his little third baseman as a croaker. And Carle, after sitting silent at his desk for an unpleasant half hour, and later having performed a little problem in addition and subtraction which apparently gave him no relief, accepted unhesitatingly the invitation of Jones to join him and two others in a drive with a span of horses, though he knew that the livery charge to be divided would be at least five dollars. You can\u0027t be mean, if you want fellows to like you! \\n\\n \\n\\n As a matter of fact Carle\u0027s classroom work was[Pg 72] falling off. He was not perhaps conscious of the change, and some of his teachers had likewise failed to perceive the trend. When a boy trots his translations, he may, if he is quick and observant in the recitation room, deceive his instructors for a very considerable time. A good teacher necessarily repeats questions and reemphasizes principles, and Carle was bright enough to take full advantage of opportunities afforded by the recitations. But all the time, as his outside interests increased, and the circle of intimates with whom he idled grew, his study became more superficial. The translation book was no longer reserved for special emergency; it lay open on his desk from the first line of the lesson to the last. His newly developed method in mathematics was to gather all possible solutions from his acquaintances before trying any problems himself. He was growing distinctly clever in the art of cribbing. Still he seemed to be doing fair work, for such a process is one of gradual and secret undermining rather than of open destruction. One does not perceive the extent to which the foundations are injured until the crash comes. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 73] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is the matter with Carle?\" asked Mr. Rice, the young teacher of history, at a faculty meeting in February. \"Isn\u0027t he falling off in his work?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Moore turned on him an indulgent smile. \"I haven\u0027t noticed it,\" he said, \"and I have him five times a week.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As the young instructor had Carle\u0027s section but two hours weekly, this answer appeared to the questioner equivalent to a rebuke; so, taking Kipling\u0027s advice to the cub, he thought, and was still. The result of his thinking was first that Mr. Moore, being faculty member of the Omicron, must know Carle\u0027s habits of work much better than he himself did; and, secondly, that he was but a tyro at the business, with much to learn, both as to boys and the ways of the school. He did not see that the Principal made a note of his question, or that Lovering, one of the Latin men, and Pope, a middle-aged confrère who had sections in mathematics, exchanged a few words in low tones. Otherwise, he might have felt less chagrin over his apparent error. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1912/54987.html","bookId":915,"book":{"id":915,"title":"With Mask and Mitt","description":"简介： If, for the beginning of this story, the reader finds himself carried back to the middle of In the Line, let him not suspect a twice-told tale.
