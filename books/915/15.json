{"id":34896,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV A CAPTAIN\u0027S TROUBLES","content":"Poole stood in the middle of the room, his lips still parted, his eyes staring. His expression, as Owen saw it, and as it would have appeared if reproduced by instantaneous photography, was almost idiotic, so stunned was he by the incredible news. In a moment, however, intelligence returned. \"Do you mean to say that Carle has sneaked off home for good, and sold his things to you?\" he demanded fiercely, taking a threatening step forward upon poor Jenks, as if the dealer were to be held responsible for Carle\u0027s disappearance. Mr. Jenks edged away. \"I dunno about sneakin\u0027,\" he replied resentfully; \"I said he\u0027d gone home for good and sold his things to me. I s\u0027pose he\u0027s got a right to go if he wants to.\" \"Did he tell you he wasn\u0027t coming back?\" \"Yes, he did, three days ago, right in this very[Pg 147] room. He didn\u0027t want me to come for the stuff till to-day, because he said the boys would bother him with questions. I\u0027m going to send him the money as soon as I get the things down to the store.\" Poole stood silent, but his eyes, angrily snapping, remained fixed upon the furniture dealer, and his lips, tightly shut, twitched at the corners. Mr. Jenks looked puzzled; suddenly a ray of intelligence flashed over his face. \"None of the furniture was yours, was it?\" he asked eagerly, thinking to have found the reason for Poole\u0027s emotion. \"He said it was all his except what belonged to his room-mate.\" \"None of it\u0027s mine,\" returned Poole, turning abruptly on his heel. \"Come on, Owen!\" He went plunging down the stairs, with Owen following closely. At the outside door he turned on his companion. \"What do you think of that?\" he demanded hotly. \"That\u0027s a fine trick to play us, isn\u0027t it!\" \"If his father sent for him I suppose he had to go,\" remarked Owen, thinking for the moment[Pg 148] rather of Mr. Carle\u0027s plight than of that of the school. \"Why did he have to go?\" shouted Poole, whose wrath, already at the boiling-point, bubbled furiously over at the suggestion of excuse for Carle\u0027s defection. \"Why did he have to go? Why couldn\u0027t he stay here and earn his way as well as Laughlin and Jeffrey and White and Barrington, and lots of other fellows that are better than he is? Why did he have to join that Standard Oil crowd and play the sport, when he knew, and everybody knew, that he had no money to spend? Why couldn\u0027t he live within his means, like any decent fellow? Think of his knowing for a week that he was going to clear out, and letting us tend him and tutor him and guard him like a confounded little prince! Why, he was in the cage with Borland yesterday afternoon!\" These were obviously rhetorical questions, to which answers were not expected. But Rob, though he felt no temptation to undertake the defence of Carle, could not refrain from remarking: \"You fellows were partly responsible.[Pg 149] You\u0027ve done nothing but flatter him and pet him since he came.\" There was some truth in this charge, and Poole was honest enough to recognize it. He passed abruptly from vituperation to lament:— \"But he could pitch—you know he could. I never saw a fellow in the cage like him—and he\u0027s let us waste all the winter on him, the beggar, and now crawls off just when we rely on him most. What\u0027s O\u0027Connell or that green Patterson compared with him? Borland\u0027s simply thrown his winter away.\" The references to Patterson and Borland were not pleasing to Owen; the first, because he knew that the contemptuous opinion was not deserved, the second, because it emphasized once more the contrast between his own position and that of Borland. It had apparently not occurred to Poole that Patterson might have developed under Owen\u0027s tuition. \"I call Patterson a very promising man,\" he blurted out, stung by the captain\u0027s slur, and regardless of his secret. Poole shot a quick glance at his companion. [Pg 150] \"Better than Carle, perhaps,\" he said with a mocking smile. \"Better than Carle two years from now, if not better to-day,\" Owen retorted hotly. \"I\u0027ve caught them both and I ought to know something about it.\" Poole sniffed,—in pity rather than contempt. That a fellow who evidently had seen good ball, and who usually showed common sense, should group Carle and Patterson together as equals, or likely to be equals, seemed unaccountable. \"He\u0027ll do me a heap of good two years from now, won\u0027t he? I want some one for now.\" And then, after a few moments of silence, during which he kicked away at the marble entrance step, while his thoughts dwelt gloomily on the desperate situation, he added in discouraged tones: \"I suppose the first thing to do is to ask Grim whether the chap has really gone for good, though I haven\u0027t any doubt about it myself.\" The Principal\u0027s House. So they parted, Poole to visit the Principal and receive confirmation of Jenks\u0027s story, Owen to return to his room and upbraid himself for boasting about Patterson. He felt all the con[Pg 151]fidence in his protégé that his words implied, but he had no desire to see his pitcher taken from his hands and turned over to Borland as Carle had been. When Patterson was tried out he wanted to be on hand to support him and keep him up to his best; likewise to receive a just share of the glory of the achievement, should the achievement prove glorious—but of this he tried not to think. Borland\u0027s task during the short spring recess was not what he had imagined it when he had said good-by to his admiring friends, sharing sincerely in their belief that he was to constitute at least one-half of the best battery that the school had ever possessed. Instead, he found himself doomed to partake of the disgrace of O\u0027Connell\u0027s failures. And alas! it was the same old O\u0027Connell, conceited, obstinate, uncertain as a primitive blunderbuss! He did indeed take seriously the new responsibility devolving upon him through the departure of Carle; he really meant to do everything within his power to \"make good.\" He laid aside the airs of superiority and self-satisfaction which had been so offensive to Owen; he was not unwilling[Pg 152] to consider Borland\u0027s advice; he endeavored to keep his inflammable temper well shielded from stray sparks. Unfortunately, however, he was not by nature teachable, nor was Borland a wise instructor. When two drops in succession landed on the plate, Borland would protest and O\u0027Connell promise to do better. When, a little later, O\u0027Connell would persist in shooting his high ones at the batsman\u0027s head, or throwing ridiculous outs that showed themselves clearly wide long before they came within reach of the bat, Borland would reprove sharply, O\u0027Connell retort with asperity, Borland sputter and growl, O\u0027Connell drop all fire protection and let his temper blaze away! Whether peace was patched up immediately or not, that day\u0027s practice was ruined. To say that the captain was discouraged would be an understatement of poor Poole\u0027s condition. He was desperate. Laughlin cheered him somewhat by assuring him on general principles that the opportunity usually produces the man, and so some one would probably be found to fill Carle\u0027s place, if not better than the renegade, at least as good. But Laughlin knew nothing of[Pg 153] baseball, and Poole had little faith in general principles. He took the first chance that offered to watch Patterson and Owen at their practice, hoping to find substantial reason for Owen\u0027s assurance. But Owen, obstinately true to his purpose never to show off his man, kept Patterson working away on the morning\u0027s task,—a slow ball which was to be thrown with the exact motions used in throwing a swift one, but about ten feet slower,—and disregarded the spectator. The captain had at last to ask for something different, and was of course obeyed. Though what he saw would hardly represent Patterson\u0027s possibilities as a pitcher, Poole left the cage with the feeling that Patterson was, after all, not so bad. \"Ten feet slower!\" he said to himself as he strolled back to his room. \"That\u0027s drawing things pretty fine! If it\u0027s too slow it\u0027s bad, of course, for a man gets ready to hit, stops himself, makes a fresh start, and very likely catches it squarely and drives it out. It\u0027s got to be slower than a swift one, and not too slow; but how does Owen know that the difference is just ten feet? The chap understands handling a pitched ball all[Pg 154] right, and Patterson minds him as a Japanese soldier minds his officer, but I don\u0027t believe that he\u0027s so mighty wise that he knows the difference to a foot between a swift ball and a slow one.\" Poole resolved to see the whole of the next pitching practice. But, unhappily, Patterson was called home the next day because his family were unwilling to forego the pleasure of his society during the few days of liberty that the school offered,—so there was no practice to watch except that of O\u0027Connell and Borland, who quarrelled daily, and daily made up under the pressure of their joint responsibility, each blaming the other for lack of progress. It was not pure joy to be captain of the Seaton nine!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1912/54994.html","bookId":915,"book":{"id":915,"title":"With Mask and Mitt","description":"简介： If, for the beginning of this story, the reader finds himself carried back to the middle of In the Line, let him not suspect a twice-told tale.
