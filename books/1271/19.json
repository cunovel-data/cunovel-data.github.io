{"id":30887,"no":19,"title":"19 Love for Breakfast","content":"IN THE grey dawn, Zurich airport was depressing and almost deserted, but, blessedly, there was a Swissair Caravelle, delayed by fog at London Airport, waiting to take off for London. Bond parked Tracy in the restaurant and, regretfully forsaking the smell of coffee and fried eggs, went and bought himself a ticket, had his passport stamped by a sleepy official (he had half expected to be stopped, but wasn\u0027t), and went to a telephone booth and shut himself in. He looked up Universal Export in the telephone book, and read underneath, as he had hoped, \u0027Hauptvertreter Alexander Muir. Privat Wohnung\u0027 and the number. Bond glanced through the glass window at the clock in the departure hall. Six o\u0027clock. Well, Muir would just have to take it. \n He rang the number and, after minutes, a sleepy voice said, \u0027Ja! Hier Muir.\u0027 \n Bond said, \u0027Sorry, 410, but this is 007. I\u0027m calling from the airport. This is bloody urgent so I\u0027ll have to take a chance on your line being bugged. Got a paper and pencil?\u0027 \n The voice at the other end had grown brisker. \u0027Hang on, 007. Yes, got it. Go ahead.\u0027 \n \u0027First of all I\u0027ve got some bad news. Your Number Two has had it. Almost for sure. Can\u0027t give you any details over this line, but I\u0027m off to London in about an hour - Swissair Flight 110 - and I\u0027ll signal the dope back straight away. Could you put that on the teleprinter? Right. Now I\u0027m guessing that in the next day or so a party often girls, British, will be coming in here by helicopter from the Engadine. Yellow Sud Aviation Alouette. I\u0027ll be teleprinting their names back from London some time today. My bet is they\u0027ll be flying to England, probably on different flights and perhaps to Prestwick and Gatwick as well as London Airport, if you\u0027ve any planes using those airports. Anyway, I guess they\u0027ll be dispersed. Now, I think it may be very important to tell London their flight numbers and ETA. Rather a big job, but I\u0027ll get you authority in a few hours to use men from Berne and Geneva to lend a hand. Got it? Right. Now I\u0027m pretty certain you\u0027re blown. Remember the old Operation Bedlam that\u0027s just been cancelled? Well, it\u0027s him and he\u0027s got radio and he\u0027ll probably have guessed I\u0027d be contacting you this morning. Just take a look out of the window and see if there\u0027s any sign of watchers. He\u0027s certainly got his men in Zurich.\u0027 \n \u0027Christ, what a shambles!\u0027 The voice at the other end was tight with tension. \u0027Hang on.\u0027 There was a pause. Bond could visualize Muir, whom he didn\u0027t know except as a number, going over to the window, carefully drawing aside the curtain. Muir came back on the wire.\u0027 Looks damn like it. There\u0027s a black Porsche across the road. Two men in it. I\u0027ll get my friends in the Se\"curite to chase them away.\u0027 \n Bond said, \u0027Be careful how you go about it. My guess is that our man has got a pretty good fix in with the police. Anyway, put all this on the telex to M personally, would you? Ciphered of course. And tell him if I get back in one piece I must see him today, with 501 [the Chief Scientific Officer to the Service] and if possible with someone in the same line of business from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Sounds daft, but there it is. It\u0027s going to upset their paper hats and Christmas pudding, but I can\u0027t help that. Can you manage all that? Good lad. Any questions?\u0027 \n \u0027Sure I oughtn\u0027t to come out to the airport and get some more about my Number Two? He was tailing one of Red-land\u0027s men. Chap\u0027s been buying some pretty odd stuff from the local rep. of Badische Anilin. Number Two thought it seemed damned fishy. Didn\u0027t tell me what the stuff was. Just thought he\u0027d better see where it was being delivered to.\u0027 \n \u0027I thought it must be some kind of a spiel like that. No. You stay away from me. I\u0027m hot as a pistol, going to be hotter later in the day when they find a certain Mercedes at the bottom of a precipice. I\u0027ll get off the line now. Sorry to have wrecked your Christmas. \u0027Bye.\u0027 \n Bond put down the receiver and went up to the restaurant. Tracy had been watching the door. Her face lit up when she saw him. He sat down very close to her and took her hand, a typical airport farewell couple. He ordered plenty of scrambled eggs and coffee. \u0027It\u0027s all right, Tracy. I\u0027ve fixed everything at my end. But now about you. That car of yours is going to be bad news. There\u0027ll be people who\u0027ll have seen you drive away with the Mercedes on your tail. There always are, even at midnight on Christmas Eve. And the big man on top of the mountain has got his men down here too. You\u0027d better finish your breakfast and get the hell on over the frontier. Which is the nearest?\u0027 \n \u0027Schaffhausen or Konstanz, I suppose, but\u0027 - she pleaded -\u0027James, do I have to leave you now? It\u0027s been so long waiting for you. And I have done well, haven\u0027t I? Why do you want to punish me?\u0027 Tears, that would never have been there in the Royale days, sparkled in her eyes. She wiped them angrily away with the back of her hand. \n Bond suddenly thought, Hell! I\u0027ll never find another girl like this one. She\u0027s got everything I\u0027ve ever looked for in a woman. She\u0027s beautiful, in bed and out. She\u0027s adventurous, brave, resourceful. She\u0027s exciting always. She seems to love me. She\u0027d let me go on with my life. She\u0027s a lone girl, not cluttered up with friends, relations, belongings. Above all, she needs me. It\u0027ll be someone for me to look after. I\u0027m fed up with all these untidy, casual affairs that leave me with a bad conscience. I wouldn\u0027t mind having children. I\u0027ve got no social background into which she would or wouldn\u0027t fit. We\u0027re two of a pair, really. Why not make it for always? \n Bond found his voice saying those words that he had never said in his life before, never expected to say. \n \u0027Tracy. I love you. Will you marry me?\u0027 \n She turned very pale. She looked at him wonderingly. Her lips trembled. \u0027You mean that?\u0027 \n \u0027Yes, I mean it. With all my heart.\u0027 \n She took her hand away from his and put her face in her hands. When she removed them she was smiling. \u0027 I\u0027m sorry, James. It\u0027s so much what I\u0027ve been dreaming of. It came as a shock. But yes. Yes, of course I\u0027ll marry you. And I won\u0027t be silly about it. I won\u0027t make a scene. Just kiss me once and I\u0027ll be going.\u0027 She looked seriously at him, at every detail of his face. Then she leaned forward and they kissed. \n She got up briskly. \u0027I suppose I\u0027ve got to get used to doing what you say. I\u0027ll drive to Munich. To the Vier Jahreszeiten. It\u0027s my favourite hotel in the world. I\u0027ll wait for you there. They know me. They\u0027ll take me in without any luggage. Everything\u0027s at Samaden. I\u0027ll just have to send out for a tooth-brush and stay in bed for two days until I can go out and get some things. You\u0027ll telephone me? Talk to me? When can we get married? I must tell Papa. He\u0027ll be terribly excited.\u0027 \n \u0027Let\u0027s get married in Munich. At the Consulate. I\u0027ve got a kind of diplomatic immunity. I can get the papers through quickly. Then we can be married again in an English church, or Scottish rather. That\u0027s where I come from. I\u0027ll call you up tonight and tomorrow. I\u0027ll get to you just as soon as I can. I\u0027ve got to finish this business first.\u0027 \n \u0027You promise you won\u0027t get hurt?\u0027 \n Bond smiled. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t think of it. For once I\u0027ll run away if someone starts any shooting.\u0027 \n \u0027All right then.\u0027 She looked at him carefully again. \u0027It\u0027s time you took off that red handkerchief. I suppose you realize it\u0027s bitten to ribbons. Give it to me. I\u0027ll mend it.\u0027 \n Bond undid the red bandanna from round his neck. It was a dark, sweat-soaked rag. And she was right. Two corners of it were in shreds. He must have got them between his teeth and chewed on them when the going was bad down the mountain. He couldn\u0027t remember having done so. He gave it to her. \n She took it and, without looking back, walked straight out of the restaurant and down the stairs towards the exit. \n Bond sat down. His breakfast came and he began eating mechanically. What had he done? What in hell had he done? But the only answer was a feeling of tremendous warmth and relief and excitement. James and Tracy Bond! Commander and Mrs Bond! How utterly, utterly extraordinary! \n The voice of the Tannoy said, \u0027Attention, please. Passengers on Swissair Flight Number 110 for London, please assemble at gate Number 2. Swissair Flight Number 110 for London. Passengers to gate Number 2, please.\u0027 \n Bond stubbed out his cigarette, gave a quick glance round their trysting-place to fix its banality in his mind, and walked to the door, leaving the fragments of his old life torn up amidst the debris of an airport breakfast. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46876.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007之女王密使 On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"简介： 贝洛福在瑞士山区建立一个疗养院，但实际上却阴谋进行一项控制全球的野心计划，就是将病毒注射到女患者身上，然后分派到世界各地，企图掌握世界主权。007奉命调查此案，乔装家谱学家蒙混而入，及时炸毁实验室，挽救了世界。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
