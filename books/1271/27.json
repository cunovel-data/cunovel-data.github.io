{"id":30895,"no":27,"title":"27 All the Time in the World","content":"\u0027I DO.\u0027 James Bond said the words at ten-thirty in the morning of a crystal-clear New Year\u0027s Day in the British Consul General\u0027s drawing-room. And he meant them. The Consul General had proved himself, as British Consuls so often do, to be a man of efficiency and a man with a heart. It was a holiday for him and, as he confessed, he should have been recovering from a New Year\u0027s Eve hangover. And he had shaved many days off the formal period of notice, but that, he explained, he had occasionally, and improperly, risked in his career if there were exceptional circumstances such as the imminent death of either party. \u0027You both look healthy enough,\u0027 he had said when they first visited him together, \u0027but that\u0027s a nasty cut on your head, Commander Bond, and the Countess is perhaps looking a little pale. And I have taken the precaution of obtaining special dispensation from the Foreign Secretary, which I may say, to my surprise, was immediately forthcoming. So let\u0027s make it New Year\u0027s Day. And come to my home. My wife is hopelessly sentimental about these occasional jobs I have to do, and I know she\u0027d love to meet you both.\u0027 The papers were signed, and Head of Station M, who had agreed to act as Bond\u0027s best man and who was secretly longing to write a sensational note to the head of his London Section about all this, produced a handful of confetti and threw most of it over Marc-Ange, who had turned up in a \u0027cylindre\u0027 and a full suit of very French tails with, surprisingly, two rows of medals of which the last, to Bond\u0027s astonishment, was the Fling\u0027s Medal for foreign resistance-fighters. \u0027I will tell you all about it one day, my dear James,\u0027 he had said in answer to Bond\u0027s admiring inquiry. \u0027It was tremendous fun. I had myself what the Americans call \"a ball\". And\u0027 - his voice sank to a whisper and he put one finger along his brown, sensitive nose - \u0027I confess that I profited by the occasion to lay my hands on the secret funds of a certain section of the Abwehr, But Herkos Odonton, my dear James! Herkos Odonton! Medals are so often just the badges of good luck. If I am a hero, it is for things for which no medals are awarded. And\u0027 - he drew lines with his fingers across his chest -\u0027there is hardly room on the breast of this \"frac\", which, by the way, is by courtesy of the excellent Galeries Barbes in Marseilles, for all that I am due under that heading.\u0027 The farewells were said and Bond submitted himself, he swore for the last time, to Marc-Ange\u0027s embraces, and they went down the steps to the waiting Lancia. Someone, Bond suspected the Consul\u0027s wife, had tied white ribbons from the corners of the wind-screen to the grill of the radiator, and there was a small group of bystanders, passers-by, who had stopped, as they do all over the world, to see who it was, what they looked like. The Consul General shook Bond by the hand. \u0027I\u0027m afraid we haven\u0027t managed to keep this as private as you\u0027d have liked. A woman reporter came on from the Munchener lllustrierte this morning. Wouldn\u0027t say who she was. Gossip-writer, I suppose. I had to give her the bare facts., She particularly wanted to know the time of the ceremony, if you can call it that, so that they could send a camera-man along. At least you\u0027ve been spared that. All still tight, I suppose. Well, so long and the best of luck.\u0027 Tracy, who had elected to \u0027go away\u0027 in a dark-grey Tyroler outfit with the traditional dark-green trimmings and stag\u0027s-horn buttons, threw her saucy mountaineer\u0027s hat with its gay chamois\u0027 beard cockade into the back seat, climbed in, and pressed the starter. The engine purred and then roared softly as she went through the gears down the empty street. They both waved one hand out of a window and Bond, looking back, saw Marc-Ange\u0027s \u0027cylindre\u0027 whirling up into the air. There was a small flutter of answering hands from the pavement and then they were round the corner and away. When they found the Autobahn exit for Salzburg and Kufstein, Bond said, \u0027Be an angel and pull in to the side, Tracy. I\u0027ve got two things to do.\u0027 She pulled in on to the grass verge. The brown grass of winter showed through the thin snow. Bond reached for her and took her in his arms. He kissed her tenderly. \u0027That\u0027s the first thing, and I just wanted to say that I\u0027ll look after you, Tracy. Will you mind being looked after?\u0027 She held him away from her and looked at him. She smiled. Her eyes were introspective. \u0027That\u0027s what it means being Mr and Mrs, doesn\u0027t it? They don\u0027t say Mrs and Mr. But you need looking after too. Let\u0027s just look after each other.\u0027 \u0027All right. But I\u0027d rather have my job than yours. Now. I simply must get out and take down those ribbons. I can\u0027t stand looking like a coronation. D\u0027you mind?\u0027 She laughed. \u0027You like being anonymous. I want everyone to cheer as we go by. I know you\u0027re going to have this car sprayed grey or black as soon as you get a chance. That\u0027s all right. But nothing\u0027s going to stop me wearing you like a flag from now on. Will you sometimes feel like wearing me like a flag?\u0027 \u0027On all holidays and feast days.\u0027 Bond got out and removed the ribbons. He looked up at the cloudless sky. The sun felt warm on his face. He said, \u0027Do you think we\u0027d be too cold if we took the roof down?\u0027 \u0027No, let\u0027s. We can only see half the world with it up. And it\u0027s a lovely drive from here to Kitzb—åhel. We can always put it up again if we want to.\u0027 Bond unscrewed the two butterfly nuts and folded the canvas top back behind the seats. He had a look up and down the Autobahn. There was plenty of traffic. At the big Shell station on the roundabout they had just passed, his eye was caught by a bright-red open Maserati being tanked up. Fast job. And a typical sporty couple, a man and a woman in the driving-seat - white dust-coats and linen helmets buttoned under the chin. Big dark-green talc goggles that obscured most of the rest of the faces. Usual German speedsters\u0027 uniform. Too far away to see if they were good-looking enough for the car, but the silhouette of the woman wasn\u0027t promising. Bond got in beside Tracy and they set off again down the beautifully landscaped road. They didn\u0027t talk much. Tracy kept at about eighty and there was wind-roar. That was the trouble about open cars. Bond glanced at his watch. 11.45. They would get to Kufstein at about one. There was a splendid Gasthaus up the winding streets towards the great castle. Here was a tiny lane of pleasure, full of the heart-plucking whine of zither music and the gentle melancholy of Tyrolean yodellers. It was here that the German tourist traditionally stopped after his day\u0027s outing into cheap Austria, just outside the German frontier, for a last giant meal of Austrian food and wine. Bond put his mouth up close to Tracy\u0027s ear and told her about it and about the other attraction at Kufstein - the most imaginative war memorial, for the 1914-18 war, ever devised. Punctually at midday every day, the windows of the castle are thrown open and a voluntary is played on the great organ inside. It can be heard for kilometres down the valley between the giant mountain ranges for which Kufstein provides the gateway. \u0027But we shall miss it. It\u0027s coming up for twelve now.\u0027 \u0027Never mind,\u0027 said Tracy, \u0027I\u0027ll make do with the zithers while you guzzle your beer and schnapps.\u0027 She turned in to the right-hand fork leading to the underpass for Kufstein, and they were at once through Rosenheim and the great white peaks were immediately ahead. The traffic was much sparser now and there were kilometres where theirs was the only car on the road that arrowed away between white meadows and larch copses, towards the glittering barrier where blood had been shed between warring armies for centuries. Bond glanced behind him. Miles away down the great highway was a speck of red. The Maserati? They certainly hadn\u0027t got much competitive spirit if they couldn\u0027t catch the Lancia at eighty! No good having a car like that if you didn\u0027t drive it so as to lose all other traffic in your mirror. Perhaps he was doing them an injustice. Perhaps they too only wanted to motor quietly along and enjoy the day. Ten minutes later, Tracy said, \u0027There\u0027s a red car coming up fast behind. Do you want me to lose him?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Let him go. We\u0027ve got all the time in the world.\u0027 Now he could hear the rasping whine of the eight cylinders. He leaned over to the left and jerked a laconic thumb forwards, waving the Maserati past. The whine changed to a shattering roar. The wind-screen of the Lancia disappeared as if hit by a monster fist. Bond caught a glimpse of a taut, snarling mouth under a syphilitic nose, the flash-eliminator of some automatic gun being withdrawn, and then the red car was past and the Lancia was going like hell off the verge across a stretch of snow and smashing a path through a young copse. Then Bond\u0027s head crashed into the wind-screen frame and he was out. When he came to, a man in the khaki uniform of the Autobahn Patrol was shaking him. The young face was stark with horror. \u0027Was ist denn geschehen? Was ist denn geschehen?\u0027 Bond turned towards Tracy. She was lying forward with her face buried in the ruins of the steering-wheel. Her pink handkerchief had come off and the bell of golden hair hung down and hid her face. Bond put his arm round her shoulders, across which the dark patches had begun to flower. He pressed her against him. He looked up at the young man and smiled his reassurance. \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 he said in a clear voice as if explaining something to a child. \u0027It\u0027s quite all right. She\u0027s having a rest. We\u0027ll be going on soon. There\u0027s no hurry. You see -\u0027 Bond\u0027s head sank down against hers and he whispered into her hair -\u0027you see, we\u0027ve got all the time in the world.\u0027 The young patrolman took a last scared look at the motionless couple, hurried over to his motor cycle, picked up the hand-microphone, and began talking urgently to the rescue headquarters.
