{"id":30882,"no":14,"title":"14 Sweet Dreams-Sweet Nightmare!","content":"IT WAS eleven o\u0027clock and the place was as quiet as the grave. Bond, with due respect for the eye in the ceiling, went through the motions of going to the bathroom and then climbing into bed and switching off his light. He gave it ten minutes, then got quietly out of bed and pulled on his trousers and shirt. Working by touch, he slipped the end of the inch of plastic into the door crack, found the lock and pressed gently. The edge of the plastic caught the curve of the lock and slid it back. Bond now only had to push gently and the door was open. He listened, his ears pricked like an animal\u0027s. Then he carefully put his head out. The empty corridor yawned at him. Bond slipped out of the door, closed it softly, took the few steps along to Number Three and gently turned the handle. It was dark inside but there was a stirring in the bed. Now to avoid the click of the shutting door! Bond took his bit of plastic and got it against the lock, holding it in the mortice. Then he inched the door shut, at the same time gently withdrawing the plastic. The lock slid noiselessly into place. There came a whisper from the bed. \u0027Is that you?\u0027 \u0027Yes, darling.\u0027 Bond slid out of his clothes and, assuming the same geography as in his own room, walked gingerly over to the bed and sat down on its edge. A hand came out of the darkness and touched him. \u0027Ooh, you\u0027ve got nothing on!\u0027 Bond caught the hand and reached along it. \u0027Nor have you,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027That\u0027s how it should be.\u0027 Gingerly he lay down on the bed and put his head beside hers on the pillow. He noticed with a pang of pleasure that she had left room for him. He kissed her, at first softly and then with fierceness. Her body stirred. Her mouth yielded to his and when his left hand began its exploration she put her arms round him. \u0027I\u0027m catching cold.\u0027 Bond followed the lie by pulling the single sheet away from under him and then covering them both with it. The warmth and softness of her splendid body were now all his. Bond lay against her. He drew the fingernails of his left hand softly down her flat stomach. The velvety skin fluttered. She gave a small groan and reached down for his hand and held it. \u0027You do love me a little bit?\u0027 That awful question! Bond whispered, \u0027I think you\u0027re the most adorable, beautiful girl. I wish I\u0027d met you before.\u0027 The stale, insincere words seemed to be enough. She removed her restraining hand. Her hair smelt of new-mown summer grass, her mouth of Pepsodent, and her body of Mennen\u0027s Baby Powder. A small night wind rose up outside and moaned round the building, giving an extra sweetness, an extra warmth, even a certain friendship to what was no more than an act of physical passion. There was real pleasure in what they did to each other, and in the end, when it was over and they lay quietly in each other\u0027s arms, Bond knew, and knew that the girl knew, that they had done nothing wrong, done no harm to each other. After a while Bond whispered into her hair, \u0027Ruby!\u0027 \u0027Mmmm.\u0027 \u0027About your name. About the Windsors. I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s not much hope.\u0027 \u0027Oh, well, I never really believed. You know these old family stories.\u0027 \u0027Anyway, I haven\u0027t got enough books here. When I get back I\u0027ll dig into it properly. Promise. It\u0027ll be a question of starting with your family and going back - church and town records and so forth. I\u0027ll have it done properly and send it to you. Great slab of parchment with a lot of snazzy print Heavy black italics with coloured letters to start each line. Although it mayn\u0027t get you anywhere, it might be nice to have.\u0027 \u0027You mean like old documents in museums?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027d be nice.\u0027 There was silence in the little room. Her breathing became regular. Bond thought: how extraordinary! Here on top of this mountain, a death\u0027s run away from the nearest hamlet in the valley, in this little room were peace, silence, warmth, happiness - many of the ingredients of love. It was like making love in a balloon. Which nineteenth-century rake had it been who had recorded a bet in a London club that he would make love to a woman in a balloon? Bond was on the edge of sleep. He let himself slide down the soft, easy slope. Here it was wonderful. It would be just as easy for him to get back to his room in the early hours. He softly eased his right arm from under the sleeping girl, took a lazy glance at his left wrist. The big luminous numerals said midnight. Bond had hardly turned over on his right side, up against the soft flanks of the sleeping girl, when, from underneath the pillow, under the floor, deep in the bowels of the building, there came the peremptory ringing of a deep-toned, melodious electric bell. The girl stirred. She said sleepily, \u0027Oh, damn!\u0027 \u0027What is it?\u0027 \u0027Oh, it\u0027s only the treatment. I suppose it\u0027s midnight?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t pay any attention. It\u0027s only for me. Just go to sleep.\u0027 Bond kissed her between the shoulder-blades but said nothing. Now the bell had stopped. In its place there started up a droning whine, rather like the noise of a very fast electric fan, with, behind it, the steady, unvarying tick-pause-tock, tick-pause-tock of some land of metronome. The combination of the two sounds was wonderfully soothing. It compelled attention, but only just on the fringe of consciousness -like the night-noises of childhood, the slow tick of the nursery clock combined with the sound of the sea or the wind outside. And now a voice, the Count\u0027s voice came over the distant wire or tape that Bond assumed was the mechani cal source of all this. The voice was pitched in a low, singsong murmur, caressing yet authoritative, and every word was distinct. \u0027You are going to sleep.\u0027 The voice fell on the word \u0027sleep\u0027. \u0027You are tired and your limbs feel like lead.\u0027 Again the falling cadence on the last word. \u0027Your arms feel as heavy as lead. Your breathing is quite even. Your breathing is as regular as a child\u0027s. Your eyes are closed and the eyelids are heavy as lead. You are becoming tireder and tireder. Your whole body is becoming tired and heavy as lead. You are warm and comfortable. You are slipping, slipping, slipping down into sleep. Your bed is as soft and downy as a nest. You are as soft and sleepy as a chicken in a nest. A dear little chicken, flurry and cuddly.\u0027 There came the sound of a sweet cooing and clucking, the gentle brushing together of wings, the dozy murmuring of mother hens with their chicks. It went on for perhaps a full minute. Then the voice came back. \u0027The little darlings are going to sleep. They are like you, comfortable and sleepy in their nests. You love them dearly, dearly, dearly. You love all chickens. You would like to make pets of them all. You would like them to grow up beautiful and strong. You would like no harm to come to them. Soon you will be going back to your darling chickens. Soon you will be able to look after them again. Soon you will be able to help all the chickens of England. You will be able to improve the breed of chickens all over England. This will make you very, very happy. You will be doing so much good that it will make you very, very happy. But you will keep quiet about it. You will say nothing of your methods. They will be your own secret, your very own secret. People will try and find out your secret. But you will say nothing because they might try and take your secret away from you. And then you would not be able to make your darling chickens happy and healthy and strong. Thousands, millions of chickens made happier because of you. So you will say nothing and keep your secret. You will say nothing, nothing at all. You will remember what I say. You will remember what I say.\u0027 The murmuring voice was getting farther and farther away. The sweet cooing and clucking of chickens softly obscured the vanishing voice, then that too died away and there was only the electric whine and the tick-pause-tock of the metronome. Ruby was deeply asleep. Bond reached out for her wrist and felt the pulse. It was plumb on beat with the metronome. And now that, and the whine of the machine, receded softly until all was dead silence again save for the soft moan of the night wind outside. Bond let out a deep sigh. So now he had heard it all! He suddenly wanted to get back to his room and think. He slipped out from under the sheet, got to his clothes, and put them on. He manipulated the lock without trouble. There was no movement, no sound, in the passage. He slipped back into Number Two and eased the door shut. Then he went into his bathroom, closed the door, switched on the light, and sat down on the lavatory and put his head in his hands. Deep hypnosis! That was what he had heard. The Hidden Persuader! The repetitive, singsong message injected into the brain while it was on the twilight edge of consciousness. Now, in Ruby\u0027s subconscious, the message would work on all by itself through the night, leaving her, after weeks of repetition, with an in-built mechanism of obedience to the voice that would be as deep, as compelling, as hunger. But what in hell was the message all about? Surely it was a most harmless, even a praiseworthy message to instil in the simple mind of this country girl. She had been cured of her allergy and she would return home fully capable of helping with the family poultry business - more than that, enthusiastic, dedicated. Had the leopard changed his spots? Had the old lag become, in the corny, hackneyed tradition, a do-gooder? Bond simply couldn\u0027t believe it. What about all those high-powered security arrangements? What about the multi-racial staff that positively stank of SPECTRE? And what about the bob-run murder? Accident? So soon after the man\u0027s attempted rape of this Sarah girl? An impossible coincidence! Malignity must somewhere lie behind the benign, clinical front of this maddeningly innocent research outfit! But where? How in hell could he find out? Bond, exhausted, got up and turned off the light in the bathroom and quietly got himself into bed. The mind whirred on for a sterile half-hour in the over-heated brain and then, mercifully, he went to sleep. * * * When, at nine o\u0027clock, he awoke and threw open his windows, the sky was overcast with the heavy blank grey that meant snow. Over by the Berghaus, the Schneefinken, and Schneevogel, the snow-finches and Alpine choughs, that lived on the crumbs and left-overs of the picnickers, were fluttering and swooping close round the building - a sure storm-warning. The wind had got up and was blowing in sharp, threatening gusts, and no whine of machinery came from the cable railway. The light aluminium gondolas would have too bad a time in winds of this strength, particularly over the last great swoop of cable that brought them a good quarter of a mile over the exposed shoulder beneath the plateau. Bond shut the windows and rang for his breakfast. When it came there was a note from Fraulein Bunt on the tray. \u0027The Count will be pleased to receive you at eleven o\u0027clock. I.E.\u0027 Bond ate his breakfast and got down to his third page of de Bleuvilles. He had quite a chunk of work to show up, but this was easy stuff. The prospect of successfully bamboozling his way along the Blofeld part of the trail was not so encouraging. He would start boldly at the Gdynia end and work back - get the old rascal to talk about his youth and his parents. Old rascal? Well, dammit, whatever he had become since Operation \u0027Thunderball\u0027, there weren\u0027t two Ernst Stavro Blofelds in the world! They met in the Count\u0027s study. \u0027Good morning, Sir Hilary. I hope you slept well? We are going to have snow.\u0027 The Count waved towards the window. \u0027 It will be a good day for work. No distractions.\u0027 Bond smiled a man-to-man smile. \u0027I certainly find those girls pretty distracting. But most charming. What\u0027s the matter with them, by the way? They all look healthy enough.\u0027 The Count was off-hand. \u0027They suffer from allergies, Sir Hilary. Crippling allergies. In the agricultural field. They are country girls and their disabilities affect the possibility of their employment. I have devised a cure for such symptoms. I am glad to say that the signs are propitious. We are making much progress together.\u0027 The telephone by his side buzzed. \u0027Excuse me.\u0027 The Count picked up the receiver and listened. \u0027Ja. Machen Sie die Verbindung.\u0027 He paused. Bond politely studied the papers he had brought along. \u0027Zdies de Bleuville… Da… Da… Kharascho!\u0027 He put the receiver back. \u0027Forgive me. That was one of my research workers. He has been purchasing some materials for the laboratories. The cable railway is closed, but they are making a special trip up for him. Brave man. He will probably be very sick, poor fellow.\u0027 The green contact lenses hid any sympathy he may have felt. The fixed smile showed none. \u0027And now, my dear Sir Hilary, let us get on with our work.\u0027 Bond laid out his big sheets on the desk and proudly ran his finger down through the generations. There was excitement and satisfaction in the Count\u0027s comments and questions. \u0027But this is tremendous, really tremendous, my dear fellow. And you say there is mention of a broken spear or a broken sword in the arms? Now when was that granted?\u0027 Bond rattled off a lot of stuff about the Norman Conquest. The broken sword had probably been awarded as a result of some battle. More research in London would be needed to pin the occasion down. Finally Bond rolled up the sheets and got out his notebook. \u0027And now we must start working back from the other end, Count.\u0027 Bond became inquisitorial, authoritative. \u0027We have your birth date in Gdynia, May 28th, 1908. Yes?\u0027 \u0027Correct.\u0027 \u0027Your parents\u0027 names?\u0027 \u0027Ernst George Blofeld and Maria Stavro Michelopoulos.\u0027 \u0027Also born in Gdynia?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Now your grandparents?\u0027 \u0027Ernst Stefan Blofeld and Elizabeth Lubomirskaya.\u0027 \u0027Hm, so the Ernst is something of a family Christian name?\u0027 \u0027It would seem so. My great-grandfather, he was also Ernst.\u0027 \u0027That is most important. You see. Count, among the Blofelds of Augsburg there are no less than two Ernsts!\u0027 The Count\u0027s hands had been lying on the green blotting-pad on his desk, relaxed. Now, impulsively, they joined together and briefly writhed, showing white knuckles. My God, you\u0027ve got it bad! thought Bond. \u0027And that is important?\u0027 \u0027Very. Christian names run through families. We regard them as most significant clues. Now, can you remember any farther back? You have done well. We have covered three generations. With the dates I shall later ask you for, we have already got back to around 1850. Only another fifty years to go and we shall have arrived at Augsburg.\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 It was almost a cry of pain. \u0027My great-great-grandfather. Of him I know nothing.\u0027 The hands writhed on the blotting-paper. \u0027Perhaps, perhaps. If it is a question of money. People, witnesses could be found.\u0027 The hands parted, held themselves out expansively. \u0027My dear Sir Hilary, you and I are men of the world. We understand each other. Extracts from archives, registry offices, the churches - these things, do they have to be completely authentic?\u0027 Got you, you old fox! Bond said affably, with a hint of conspiracy, \u0027I don\u0027t quite understand what you mean, Count/ The hands were now flat on the desk again, happy hands. Blofeld had recognized one of his kind. \u0027You are a hardworking man, Sir Hilary. You live modestly in this remote region of Scotland. Life could perhaps be made easier for you. There are perhaps material benefits you desire - motorcars, a yacht, a pension. You have only to say the word, name a figure.\u0027 The dark-green orbs bored into Bond\u0027s modestly evasive eyes, holding them. \u0027Just a little co-operation. A visit here and there in Poland and Germany and France. Of course your expenses would be heavy. Let us say five hundred pounds a week. The technical matters, the documents, and so forth. Those I can arrange. It would only require your supporting evidence. Yes? The Ministry of Justice in Paris, for them the word of the College of Arms is the word of God. Is that not so?\u0027 It was too good to be true! But how to play it? Diffidently, Bond said, \u0027What you are suggesting, Count, is - er - not without interest. Of course\u0027 - Bond\u0027s smile was sufficiently expansive, sufficiently bland - \u0027if the documents were convincing, so to speak solid, very solid, then it would be quite reasonable for me to authenticate them.\u0027 Bond put spaniel into his eyes, asking to be patted, to be told that everything would be all right, that he would be completely protected. \u0027You see what I mean?\u0027 The Count began, with force, sincerity, \u0027You need have absolutely no…\u0027 when there was the noise of an approaching hubbub down the passage. The door burst open. A man, propelled from behind, lurched into the room and fell, writhing, to the floor. Two of the guards came stiffly to attention behind him. They looked first at the Count and then, sideways, towards Bond, surprised to see him there. The Count said sharply, \u0027Was ist derm los?\u0027 Bond knew the answer and, momentarily, he died. Behind the snow and the blood on the face of the man on the floor, Bond recognized the face of a man he knew. The blond hair, the nose broken boxing for the Navy, belonged to a friend of his in the Service. It was, unmistakably, Number 2 from Station Z in Zurich!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46871.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007之女王密使 On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"简介： 贝洛福在瑞士山区建立一个疗养院，但实际上却阴谋进行一项控制全球的野心计划，就是将病毒注射到女患者身上，然后分派到世界各地，企图掌握世界主权。007奉命调查此案，乔装家谱学家蒙混而入，及时炸毁实验室，挽救了世界。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
