{"id":30873,"no":5,"title":"5 The Capu","content":"THE union CORSE! Now at least some of the mystery was explained. Bond looked across the desk into the brown eyes that were now shrewdly watching his reactions while his mind flicked through the file that bore the innocent title, \"The union Corse\u0027, more deadly and perhaps even older than the unione Siciliano, the Mafia. He knew that it controlled most organized crime throughout metropolitan France and her colonies - protection rackets, smuggling, prostitution and the suppression of rival gangs. Only a few months ago a certain Rossi had been shot dead in a bar in Nice. A year before that, a Jean Giudicelli had been liquidated after several previous attempts had failed. Both these men had been known pretenders to the throne of Capu - the ebullient, cheerful man who now sat so peacefully across the table from Bond. Then there was this mysterious business of Rommel\u0027s treasure, supposed to be hidden beneath the sea somewhere off Bastia. In 1948 a Czech diver called Fleigh, who had been in the Abwehr, and had got on the track of it, was warned off by the union and then vanished off the face of the earth. Quite recently the body of a young French diver, Andre Mattei, was found riddled with bullets by the roadside near Bastia. He had foolishly boasted in the local bars that he knew the whereabouts of the treasure and had come to dive for it. Did Marc-Ange know the secret of this treasure? Had he been responsible for the killing of these two divers? The little village of Calenzana in the Balagne boasted of having produced more gangsters than any other village in Corsica and of being in consequence one of the most prosperous. The local mayor had held office for fifty-six years - the longest reigning mayor in France. Marc-Ange would surely be a son of that little community, know the secrets of that famous mayor, know, for instance, of that big American gangster who had just returned to discreet retirement in the village after a highly profitable career in the States. \n It would be fun to drop some of these names casually in this quiet little room - fun to tell Marc-Ange that Bond knew of the old abandoned jetty called the Port of Crovani near the village of Galeria, and of the ancient silver mine called Argentella in the hills behind, whose maze of underground tunnels accommodates one of the great world junctions in the heroin traffic. Yes, it would be fun to frighten his captor in exchange for the fright he had given Bond. But better keep this ammunition in reserve until more had been revealed! For the time being it was interesting to note that this was Marc-Ange Draco\u0027s travelling headquarters. His contact in the Deuxieme Bureau would be an essential tip-off man. Bond and the girl had been\u0027sent for\u0027 for some purpose that was still to be announced. The \u0027borrowing\u0027 of the Bombard rescue-boat would have been a simple matter of finance in the right quarter, perhaps accompanied by a \u0027pot de vin\u0027 for the coastguards to look the other way. The guards were Corsicans. On reflection, that was anyway what they looked like. The whole operation was simple for an organization as powerful as the union - as simple in France as it would have been for the Mafia in most of Italy. And now for more veils to be lifted! James Bond sipped his drink and watched the other man\u0027s face with respect. This was one of the great professionals of the world! \n (How typical of Corsica, Bond thought, that their top bandit should bear the name of an angel! He remembered that two other famous Corsican gangsters had been called \u0027Gracieux\u0027 and \u0027Toussaint\u0027 - \u0027All-Saints\u0027.) Marc-Ange spoke. He spoke excellent but occasionally rather clumsy English, as if he had been well taught but had little occasion to use the language. He said, \u0027My dear Commander, everything I am going to discuss with you will please remain behind your Herkos Odonton. You know the ex-, pression? No?\u0027 The wide smile lit up his face. \u0027Then, if I may say so, your education was incomplete. It is from the classical Greek. It means literally \"the hedge of the teeth\". \n It was the Greek equivalent of your \"top secret\". Is that agreed?\u0027 \n Bond shrugged. \u0027If you tell me secrets that affect my profession, I\u0027m afraid I shall have to pass them on.\u0027 \n \u0027That I fully comprehend. What I wish to discuss is a personal matter. It concerns my daughter, Teresa.\u0027 \n Good God! The plot was indeed thickening! Bond concealed his surprise. He said, \u0027Then I agree.\u0027 He smiled, \u0027\"Herkos Odonton\" it is.\u0027 \n \u0027Thank you. You are a man to trust. You would have to be, in your profession, but I see it also in your face. Now then.\u0027 He lit a Caporal and sat back in his chair. He gazed at a point on the aluminium wall above Bond\u0027s head, only occasionally looking into Bond\u0027s eyes when he wished to emphasize a point. \u0027I was married once only, to an English girl, an English governess. She was a romantic. She had come to Corsica to look for bandits \u0027 - he smiled - \u0027rather like some English women adventure into the desert to look for sheiks. She explained to me later that she must have been possessed by a subconscious desire to be raped. Well\u0027 - this time he didn\u0027t smile -\u0027she found me in the mountains and she was raped - by me. The police were after me at the time, they have been for most of my life, and the girl was a grave encumbrance. But for some reason she refused to leave me. There was a wildness in her, a love of the unconventional, and, for God knows what reason, she liked the months of being chased from cave to cave, of getting food by robbery at night. She even learned to skin and cook a moufflon, those are our mountain sheep, and even eat the animal, which is tough as shoe leather and about as palatable. And in those crazy months, I came to love this girl and I smuggled her away from the island to Marseilles and married her.\u0027 He paused and looked at Bond.\u0027 The result, my dear Commander, was Teresa, my only child.\u0027 \n So, thought Bond. That explained the curious mixture the girl was - the kind of wild \u0027lady\u0027 that was so puzzling in her. What a complex of bloods and temperaments! Corsican English. No wonder he hadn\u0027t been able to define her nationality. \n \u0027My wife died ten years ago \u0027 - Marc-Ange held up his hand, not wanting sympathy - \u0027and I had the girl\u0027s education finished in Switzerland. I was already rich and at that time I was elected Capu, that is chief, of the union, and became infinitely richer - by means, my dear Commander, which you can guess but need not inquire into. The girl was - how do you say? - that charming expression, \"the apple of my eye\", and I gave her all she wanted. But she was a wild one, a wild bird, without a proper home, or, since I was always on the move, without proper supervision. Through her school in Switzerland, she entered the fast international set that one reads of in the newspapers - the South American millionaires, the Indian princelings, the Paris English and Americans, the playboys of Cannes and Gstaad. She was always getting in and out of scrapes and scandals, and when I remonstrated with her, cut off her allowance, she would commit some even grosser folly - to spite me, I suppose.\u0027 He paused and looked at Bond and now there was a terrible misery in the happy face. \u0027And yet all the while, behind her bravado, the mother\u0027s side of her blood was making her hate herself, despise herself more and more, and as I now see it, the worm of self-destruction had somehow got a hold inside her and, behind the wild, playgirl facade, was eating away what I can only describe as her soul.\u0027 He looked at Bond.\u0027 You know that this can happen, my friend - to men and to women. They burn the heart out of themselves by living too greedily, and suddenly they examine their lives and see that they are worthless. They have had everything, eaten all the sweets of life at one great banquet, and there is nothing left. She made what I now see was a desperate attempt to get back on the rails, so to speak. She went off, without telling me, and married, perhaps with the idea of settling down. But the man, a worthless Italian called Vicenzo, Count Giulio di Vicenzo, took as much of her money as he could lay his hands on and deserted her, leaving her with a girl child. I purchased a divorce and bought a small chateau for my daughter in the Dordogne and installed her there, and for once, with the baby and a pretty garden to look after, she seemed almost at peace. And then, my friend, six months ago, the baby died - died of that most terrible of all children\u0027s ailments, spinal meningitis.\u0027 \n There was silence in the little metal room. Bond thought of the girl a few yards away down the corridor. Yes. He had been near the truth. He had seen some of this tragic story in the calm desperation of the girl. She had indeed come to the end of the road! \n Marc-Ange got slowly up from his chair and came round and poured out more whisky for himself and for Bond. He said, \u0027Forgive me. I am a poor host. But the telling of this story, which I have always kept locked up inside me, to another man, has been a great relief.\u0027 He put a hand on Bond\u0027s shoulder. \u0027You understand that?\u0027 \n \u0027Yes. I understand that. But she is a fine girl. She still has nearly all her life to live. Have you thought of psychoanalysis? Of her church? Is she a Catholic?\u0027 \n \u0027No. Her mother would not have it. She is Presbyterian. But wait while I finish the story.\u0027 He went back to his chair and sat down heavily. \u0027After the tragedy, she disappeared. She took her jewels and went off in that little car of hers, and I heard occasional news of her, selling the jewels and living furiously all over Europe, with her old set. Naturally I followed her, had her watched when I could, but she avoided all my attempts to meet her and talk to her. Then I heard from one of my agents that she had reserved a room here, at the Splendide, for last night, and I hurried down from Paris\u0027 -he waved a hand - \u0027in this, because I had a presentiment of tragedy. You see, this was where we had spent the summers in her childhood and she had always loved it. She is a wonderful swimmer and she was almost literally in love with the sea. And, when I got the news, I suddenly had a dreadful memory, the memory of a day when she had been naughty and had been locked in her room all afternoon instead of going bathing. That night she had said to her mother, quite calmly, \"You made me very unhappy keeping me away from the sea. One day, if I get really unhappy I shall swim out into the sea, down the path of the moon or the sun, and go on swimming until I sink. So there!\" Her mother told me the story and we laughed over it together, at the childish tantrum. But now I suddenly remembered again the occasion and it seemed to me that the childish fantasy might well have stayed with her, locked away deep down, and that now, wanting to put an end to herself, she had resurrected it and was going to act on it. And so, my dear friend, I had her closely watched from the moment she arrived. Your gentlemanly conduct in the casino, for which\u0027 - he looked across at Bond - \u0027I now deeply thank you, was reported to me, as of course were your later movements together.\u0027 He held up his hand as Bond shifted with embarrassment. \u0027There is nothing to be ashamed of, to apologize for, in what you did kst night. A man is a man and, who knows? - but I shall come to that later. What you did, the way you behaved in general, may have been the beginning of some kind of therapy.\u0027 \n Bond remembered how, in the Bombard, she had yielded when he leaned against her. It had been a tiny reaction, but it had held more affection, more warmth, than all the physical ecstasies of the night. Now, suddenly he had an inkling of why he might be here, where the root of the mystery lay, and he gave an involuntary shudder, as if someone had walked over his grave. \n Marc-Ange continued, \u0027So I put in my inquiry to my friend from the Deuxieme, at six o\u0027clock this morning. At eight o\u0027clock he went to his office and to the central files and by nine o\u0027clock he had reported to me fully about you - by radio. I have a high-powered station in this vehicle.\u0027 He smiled. \u0027And that is another of my secrets that I deliver into your hands. The report, if I may say so, was entirely to your credit, both as an officer in your Service, and, more important, as a man - a man, that is, in the terms that I understand the word. So I reflected. I reflected all through this morning. And, in the end, I gave orders that you were both to be brought to me here.\u0027 He made a throw-away gesture with his right hand. \u0027I need not tell you the details of my instructions. You yourself saw them in operation. You have been inconvenienced. I apologize. You have perhaps thought yourself in danger. Forgive me. I only trust that my men behaved with correctness, with finesse.\u0027 \n Bond smiled. \u0027I am very glad to have met you. If the introduction had to be effected at the point of two automatics, that will only make it all the more memorable. The whole affair was certainly executed with neatness and expedition.\u0027 \n Marc-Ange\u0027s expression was rueful. \u0027Now you are being sarcastic. But believe me, my friend, drastic measures were necessary. I knew they were.\u0027 He reached to the top drawer of his desk, took out a sheet of writing-paper and passed it over to Bond. \u0027And now, if you read that, you will agree with me. That letter was handed in to the concierge of the Splendide at 4.30 this afternoon for posting to me in Marseilles, when Teresa went out and you followed her. You suspected something? You also feared for her? Read it, please.\u0027 \n Bond took the letter. He said, \u0027Yes. I was worried about her. She is a girl worth worrying about.\u0027 He held up the letter. It contained only a few words, written clearly, with decision. \n Dear Papa, \n I am sorry, but I have had enough. It is only sad because tonight I met a man who might have changed my mind. He is an Englishman called James Bond. Please find him and pay him 20,000 New Francs which I owe him. And thank him from me. \n This is nobody\u0027s fault but my own. \n Goodbye and forgive me. \n TRACY \n Bond didn\u0027t look at the man who had received this letter. He slid it back to him across the desk. He took a deep drink of the whisky and reached for the bottle. He said, \u0027Yes, I see.\u0027 \n \u0027She likes to call herself Tracy. She thinks Teresa sounds too grand.\u0027 \n \u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \u0027Commander Bond.\u0027 There was now a terrible urgency in the man\u0027s voice - urgency, authority and appeal. \u0027My friend, you have heard the whole story and now you have seen the evidence. Will you help me? Will you help me save this girl? It is my only chance, that you will give her hope. That you will give her a reason to live. Will you?\u0027 \n Bond kept his eyes on the desk in front of him. He dared not look up and see the expression on this man\u0027s face. So he had been right, right to fear that he was going to become involved in all this private trouble! He cursed under his breath. The idea appalled him. He was no Good Samaritan. He was no doctor for wounded birds. What she needed, he said fiercely to himself, was the psychiatrist\u0027s couch. All right, so she had taken a passing fancy to him and he to her. Now he was going to be asked, he knew it, to pick her up and carry her perhaps for the rest of his life, haunted by the knowledge, the unspoken blackmail, that, if he dropped her, it would almost certainly be to kill her. He said glumly, \u0027I do not see that I can help. What is it you have in mind?\u0027 He picked up his glass and looked into it. He drank, to give him courage to look across the desk into Marc-Ange\u0027s face. \n The man\u0027s soft brown eyes glittered with tension. The creased dark skin round the mouth had sunk into deeper folds. He said, holding Bond\u0027s eyes, \u0027I wish you to pay court to my daughter and marry her. On the day of the marriage, I will give you a personal dowry of one million pounds in gold.\u0027 \n James Bond exploded angrily. \u0027What you ask is utterly impossible. The girl is sick. What she needs is a psychiatrist Not me. And I do not want to marry, not anyone. Nor do I want a million pounds. I have enough money for my needs. I have my profession.\u0027 (Is that true? What about that letter of resignation? Bond ignored the private voice.) \u0027You must understand all this.\u0027 Suddenly he could not bear the hurt in the man\u0027s face. He said, softly, \u0027She is a wonderful girl. I will do all I can for her. But only when she is well again. Then I would certainly like to see her again - very much. But, if she thinks so well of me, if you do, then she must first get well of her own accord. That is the only way. Any doctor would tell you so. She must go to some clinic, the best there is, in Switzerland probably, and bury her past. She must want to live again. Then, only then, would there be any point in our meeting again.\u0027 He pleaded with Marc-Ange. \u0027You do understand, don\u0027t you, Marc-Ange? I am a ruthless man. I admit it. And I have not got the patience to act as anyone\u0027s nurse, man or woman. Your idea of a cure might only drive her into deeper despair. You must see that I cannot take the responsibility, however much I am attracted by your daughter.\u0027 Bond ended lamely, \u0027Which I am.\u0027 \n The man said resignedly, \u0027I understand you, my friend. And I will not importune you with further arguments. I will try and act in the way you suggest. But will you please do one further favour for me? It is now nine o\u0027clock. Will you please take her out to dinner tonight? Talk to her as you please, but show her that she is wanted, that you have affection for her. Her car is here and her clothes. I have had them brought. If only you can persuade her that you would like to see her again, I think I may be able to do the rest. Will you do this forme?\u0027 \n Bond thought, God, what an evening! But he smiled with all the warmth he could summon. \u0027But of course. I would love to do that. But I am booked on the first morning night from Le Touquet tomorrow morning. Will you be responsible for her from then?\u0027 \n \u0027Certainly, my friend. Of course I will do that.\u0027 Marc-Ange brusquely wiped a hand across his eyes. \u0027Forgive me. But you have given me hope at the end of a long night.\u0027 He straightened his shoulders and suddenly leaned across the desk and put his hands decisively down.\u0027 I will not thank you. I cannot, but tell me, my dear friend, is there anything in this world that I can do for you, now at this moment? I have great resources, great knowledge, great power. They are all yours. Is there nothing I can do for you?\u0027 \n Bond had a flash of inspiration. He smiled broadly. \u0027There is a piece of information I want. There is a man called Blofeld, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. You will have heard of him. I wish to know if he is alive and where he is to be found.\u0027 \n Marc-Ange\u0027s face underwent a remarkable change. Now the bandit, cold, cruel, avenging, looked out through the eyes that had suddenly gone as hard as brown opals. \u0027Aha!\u0027 he said thoughtfully: \u0027The Blofeld. Yes, he is certainly alive. Only recently he suborned three of my men, bribed them away from the union. He has done this to me before. Three of the members of the old SPECTRE were taken from the union. Come, let us find out what we can.\u0027 \n There was a single black telephone on the desk. He picked up the receiver and at once Bond heard the soft crackle of the operator responding. \u0027Dammi u commandu.\u0027 Marc-Ange put the receiver back. \u0027I have asked for my local headquarters in Ajaccio. We will have them in five minutes. But I must speak fast. The police may know my frequency, though I change it every week. But the Corsican dialect helps.\u0027 The telephone burred. When Marc-Ange picked up the receiver, Bond could hear the zing and crackle he knew so well. Marc-Ange spoke, in a voice of rasping authority. \u0027Ecco u Capu. Avette nuttizie di Blofeld, Ernst Stavro? Duve sta?\u0027 A voice crackled thinly. \u0027Site sigura? Ma no ezzatu indirizzu?\u0027 More crackle. \u0027Buon. Sara tutto.\u0027 \n Marc-Ange put back the receiver. He spread his hands apologetically. \u0027All we know is that he is in Switzerland. We have no exact address for him. Will that help? Surely your men there can find him - if the Swiss Securite will help. But they are difficult brutes when it comes to the privacy of a resident, particularly if he is rich.\u0027 \n Bond\u0027s pulse had quickened with triumph. Got you, you bastard! He said enthusiastically, \u0027That\u0027s wonderful, Marc-Ange. The rest shouldn\u0027t be difficult. We have good friends in Switzerland.\u0027 \n Marc-Ange smiled happily at Bond\u0027s reaction. He said seriously, \u0027But if things go wrong for you, on this case or in any other way, you will come at onqe to me. Yes?\u0027 He pulled open a drawer and handed a sheet of notepaper over to Bond. \u0027This is my open address. Telephone or cable to me, but put your request or your news in terms that would be used in connexion with electrical appliances. A consignment of radios is faulty. You will meet my representative at such and such a place, on such and such a date. Yes? You understand these tricks, and anyway\u0027 - he smiled slyly - \u0027I believe you are connected with an international export firm. \"Universal Export\", isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \n Bond smiled. How did the old devil know these things? Should he warn Security? No. This man had become a friend. And anyway, all this was Herkos Odonton! \n Marc-Ange said diffidently, \u0027And now may I bring in Teresa? She does not know what we have been discussing. Let us say it is about one of the South of France jewel robberies. You represent the insurance company. I have been making a private deal with you. You can manage that? Good.\u0027 He got up and came over to Bond and put his hand on Bond\u0027s shoulder. \u0027And thank you. Thank you for everything.\u0027 Then he went out of the door. \n Oh my God! thought Bond. Now for my side of the bargain. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46862.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007之女王密使 On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"简介： 贝洛福在瑞士山区建立一个疗养院，但实际上却阴谋进行一项控制全球的野心计划，就是将病毒注射到女患者身上，然后分派到世界各地，企图掌握世界主权。007奉命调查此案，乔装家谱学家蒙混而入，及时炸毁实验室，挽救了世界。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
