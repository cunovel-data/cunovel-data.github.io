{"id":30886,"no":18,"title":"18 Fork Left for Hell!","content":"BOND HAD no idea how he managed to stay upright, but at last it was over and everyone cheered and broke up into pairs and groups. \n Tracy got her arm under his. Bond pulled himself together. He said hoarsely, \u0027Mix with the crowd, Tracy. Got to get away from here. People after me.\u0027 A sudden hope came to him. \u0027Got your car?\u0027 \n \u0027Yes, darling. Everything\u0027ll be all right. Just hang on to me. Are people waiting for you outside?\u0027 \n \u0027Could be. Watch out for a big black Mercedes. There may be shooting. Better stay away from me. I can make it. Where\u0027s the car?\u0027 \n \u0027Down the road to the right. But don\u0027t be silly. Here, I\u0027ve got an idea. You get into this parka.\u0027 She ran the zip down and stripped it off. \u0027 It\u0027ll be a tight fit. Here, put your arm into this sleeve.\u0027 \n \u0027But you\u0027ll get cold.\u0027 \n \u0027Do as I tell you. I\u0027ve got a sweater and plenty on underneath. Now the other arm. That\u0027s right.\u0027 She pulled up the zip. \u0027Darling James, you look sweet.\u0027 \n The fur of the parka smelt of Guerlain\u0027s \u0027Ode\u0027. It took Bond back to Royale. What a girl! The thought of her, of having an ally, of not being on his own, of being away from that bloody mountain, revived Bond. He held her hand and followed her through the crowd that was now streaming towards the exit. This was going to be a bad moment! Whether or not that cable car had come on down the mountain, by now Blofeld would have had time to get one down full of SPECTRE men. Bond had been seen from the train, would be known to have made for Samaden. By now they would have covered the railway station. They would expect him to try and hide in a crowd. Perhaps the drunken man at the entrance had remembered him. If that saloon moved off and revealed the red-arrowed skis, it would be a cert. Bond let go the girl\u0027s hand and slipped the shattered Rolex back over the knuckles of his right hand. He had gathered enough strength, mostly from the girl, to have one more bash at them! \n She looked at him. \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 \n He took her hand again. \u0027Nothing.\u0027 \n They were getting near the exit. Bond peered through the slits in his mask. Yes, by God! Two of the thugs were standing beside the ticket man watching the throng with deadly concentration. On the far side of the road stood the black Mercedes, petrol vapour curling up from its exhaust. No escape. There was only bluff. Bond put his arm round Tracy\u0027s neck and whispered, \u0027Kiss me all the way past the ticket-table. They\u0027re there, but I think we can make it.\u0027 \n She flung an arm over his shoulder and drew him to her. \u0027How did you know that that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been waiting for?\u0027 Her lips crushed down sideways on his and, in a tide of laughing, singing people, they were through and on the street. \n They turned, still linked, down the road. Yes! There was the darling little white car! \n And then the horn on the Mercedes began sounding urgently. Bond\u0027s gait, or perhaps his old-fashioned ski-trousers, had given him away to the man in the car! \n \u0027Quick, darling!\u0027 said Bond urgently. \n The girl threw herself in under the wheel, pressed the starter and the car was moving as Bond scrambled in through the opposite door. Bond looked back. Through the rear window he could see the two men standing in the road. They would not shoot with so many witnesses about. Now they ran to the Mercedes. Thank God it was pointing up the hill towards St Moritz! And then Tracy had done a controlled skid round the S bend in the village and they were on the main road that Bond had staggered down half an hour before. \n It would be five minutes at least before the Mercedes could turn and get after them. The girl was going like hell, but there was traffic on the road - tinkling sleighs full of fur-wrapped merrymakers on their way back to Pontresina, an occasional car, its snow-chains rattling. She drove on her brakes and her horn, the same triple wind-horn that sounded the high discord Bond remembered so well. Bond said, \u0027You\u0027re an angel, Tracy. But take it easy. We don\u0027t want to end up in the ditch.\u0027 \n The girl glanced sideways at him and laughed with pleasure. \u0027That sounds as if you were feeling better. But I cannot see you. Now you can take off that silly mask and my parka. In a minute the heat will come on and you will be roasted. And I would like to see you as I remember you. But you are pleased with me?\u0027 \n Life was beginning to come back into Bond. It was so wonderful to be in this little car with this marvellous girl. The memory of the dreadful mountain, of all that he had been through, was receding. Now there was hope again, after so much dread and despair. He could feel the tensions uncoiling in his stomach. He said,\u0027 I\u0027ll tell you if I\u0027m pleased when we get to Zurich. Can you make it? It\u0027s a hell of a way to spend Christmas.\u0027 He wound down the window and threw the domino-mask out, stripped off the parka and draped it over her shoulders. The big sign for the main road down into the valley came up. He said, \u0027Left here, Tracy. Filisur and then Coire.\u0027 \n She took the turning, in Bond\u0027s estimation, dangerously fast. She went into a skid that Bond swore was going to be uncontrolled. But, even on the black ice of the road, she got out of it and motored blithely on. Bond said, \u0027For God\u0027s sake, Tracy! How in hell did you manage that? You haven\u0027t even got chains on.\u0027 \n She laughed, pleased at the awe in his voice. \u0027Dunlop Rally studs on all the tyres. They\u0027re only supposed to be for Rally drivers, but I managed to wangle a set out of them. Don\u0027t worry. Just sit back and enjoy the drive.\u0027 \n There was something entirely new in the girl\u0027s voice, a lilt and happiness that had certainly not been there at Royale. \n Bond turned and looked at her carefully for the first time. Yes, she was somehow a new woman, radiating health and a kind of inner glow.- The tumbled fair hair glittered with vitality and the half-open, beautiful lips seemed always to be on the verge of a smile. \n \u0027Satisfied?\u0027 \n \u0027You look absolutely wonderful. But now for God\u0027s sake tell me how you happened to be at Samaden. It was a bloody miracle. It saved my life.\u0027 \n \u0027All right. But then you tell. I\u0027ve never seen a man look so dead on his feet. I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes. I thought you must be plastered.\u0027 She gave him a quick glance. \u0027You still look pretty bad. Here\u0027 - she leant forward to the dashboard -\u0027I\u0027ll switch on the blower. Get you properly warmed up.\u0027 She paused. \u0027Well, my bit of the story\u0027s quite simple really. Papa rang me up one day from Marseilles to find out how I was. He asked if I had seen you and seemed very annoyed when he heard I hadn\u0027t. He practically ordered me to go and find you.\u0027 She glanced at him. \u0027He\u0027s quite taken to you, you know. Anyway he said he had found out the address of a certain man you were looking for. He said he was sure that by now you would have found out that address too. He said that, knowing you, I would find you somewhere close to this address. It was the Piz Gloria Club. He told me if I found you to tell you to watch your step, to look after yourself.\u0027 She laughed. \u0027How right he was! Well, so I left Davos, which had really put me on my feet again, like you said it would, and I came up to Samaden the day before yesterday. The Seilbahn wasn\u0027t running yesterday, so I was going to come up today to look for you. It was all as simple as that. Now you tell.\u0027 \n They had been keeping up a good speed down the sloping, winding road into the valley. Bond turned to look through the rear window. He swore under his breath. Perhaps a mile behind, twin lights were coming after them. The girl said, \u0027 I know. I\u0027ve been watching in the mirror. I\u0027m afraid they\u0027re gaining a little. Must be a good driver who knows the road. Probably got snow-chains. But I think I can hold them. Now go on. What have you been up to?\u0027 \n Bond gave her a garbled version. There was a big gangster up the mountain, living under a false name. He was wanted by the police in England. Bond was vaguely connected with the police, with the Ministry of Defence. (She snorted, \u0027Don\u0027t try and fool me. I know you\u0027re in the Secret Service. Papa told me so.\u0027 Bond said curtly, \u0027Well, Papa\u0027s talking through his hat.\u0027 She laughed knowingly.) Anyway, Bond continued, he had been sent out to make sure this was the man they wanted. He had found out that he was. But the man had become suspicious of Bond and Bond had had to get out quickly. He gave her a graphic account of the moonlit nightmare of the mountain, of the avalanche, of the man who had been killed by the train, of how he had got to Samaden, dead beat, and had tried to hide in the crowd on the skating-rink. \u0027And then,\u0027 he ended lamely, \u0027you turned up like a beautiful angel on skates, and here we are.\u0027 \n She thought the story over for a minute. Then she said calmly, \u0027And now, my darling James, just tell me how many of them you killed. And tell me the truth.\u0027 \n \u0027Why?\u0027 \n \u0027I\u0027m just curious.\u0027 \n \u0027You promise to keep this between you and me?\u0027 \n She said enigmatically, \u0027Of course. Everything\u0027s between you and me from now on.\u0027 \n \u0027Well, there was the main guard at the so-called Club. That had to be done or I\u0027d be dead myself by now. Then I suppose one got caught by the avalanche. Then, at the bottom, one of them shot at me and I had to spear him with my ski-stick - self-defence. I don\u0027t know how badly he\u0027s hurt. And then there was the man killed by the train. He\u0027d fired six shots at me. And anyway it was his own fault. Let\u0027s say three and a half got themselves killed one way or another.\u0027 \n \u0027How many are left?\u0027 \n \u0027What are you getting at?\u0027 \n \u0027I just want to know. Trust me.\u0027 \n \u0027Well, I think there were about fifteen up there all told. So that leaves eleven and a half- plus the big man.\u0027 \n \u0027And there are three in the car behind? Would they kill us if they caught us?\u0027 \n \u0027I\u0027m afraid so. I haven\u0027t got any weapons. I\u0027m sorry, Tracy, but I\u0027m afraid you wouldn\u0027t have much chance either, being a witness and a sort of accomplice of mine. These people think I\u0027m pretty bad news for them.\u0027 \n \u0027And you are?\u0027 \n \u0027Yes. From now on, I\u0027m the worst.\u0027 \n \u0027Well, I\u0027ve got pretty bad news for you. They\u0027re gaining on us and I\u0027ve only got a couple of gallons left in the tank. We\u0027ll have to stop in Filisur. There won\u0027t be a garage open and it\u0027ll mean waking someone up. Can\u0027t hope to do it under ten minutes and they\u0027ll have us. You\u0027ll have to think up something clever.\u0027 \n There was a ravine and an S turn over a bridge. They were coming out of the first curve over the bridge. Lights blazed at them from across the ravine. There was half a mile between the two cars, but the range across the ravine was perhaps only three hundred yards. Bond wasn\u0027t surprised to see the familiar blue flames flutter from the front of the car. Chips of granite from the overhang splattered down on the bonnet of the car. Then they were into the second half of the S bend and out of sight of their pursuers. \n Now came a stretch of reconstruction work where there had been a landslide. There were big warning notices: \u0027Achtung! Baustelle! Vorsichtig Fahren!\u0027 The broken road hugged the mountain-side on the right. On the left was rickety fencing and then a precipice falling hundreds of feet down into a gorge with an ice-floed river. In the middle of the bad stretch, a huge red wooden arrow pointed right to a narrow track across a temporary bridge. Bond suddenly shouted \u0027Stop!\u0027 \n Tracy pulled up, her front wheels on the bridge. Bond tore open the door. \u0027Get on! Wait for me round the next corner. It\u0027s the only chance.\u0027 \n Good girl! She got going without a word. Bond ran back the few yards to the big red arrow. It was held in the forks of two upright poles. Bond wrenched it off, swung it round so that it pointed to the left, towards the flimsy fence that closed off the yards of old road leading to the collapsed bridge. Bond tore at the fence, pulling the stakes out, flattening it. Glare showed round the corner behind him. He leaped across the temporary road into the shadow of the mountain, flattened himself against it, waited, holding his breath. \n The Mercedes was coming faster than it should over the bumpy track, its chains clattering inside the mudguards. It made straight for the black opening to which the arrow now pointed. Bond caught a glimpse of white, strained faces and then the desperate scream of brakes as the driver saw the abyss in front of him. The car seemed almost to stop, but its front wheels must have been over the edge. It balanced for a moment on its iron belly and then slowly, slowly toppled and there was a first appalling crash as it hit the rubble beneath the old bridge. Then another crash and another. Bond ran forward past the lying arrow and looked down. Now the car was flying upside-down through the air. It hit again and a fountain of sparks flashed from a rock ledge. Then, somersaulting, and with its lights somehow still blazing, it smashed on down into the gorge. It hit a last outcrop that knocked it sideways and, spinning laterally, but now with its lights out and only the glint of the moon on metal, it took the last great plunge into the iced-up river. A deep rumble echoed up from the gorge and there was the patter of rocks and stones following the wreckage. And then all was peaceful, moonlit silence. \n Bond let out his breath in a quiet hiss between his clenched teeth. Then, mechanically, he straightened things out again, put up the remains of the fence, lifted the arrow, and put it back facing to the right. Then he wiped his sweating hands down the side of his trousers and walked .unsteadily down the road and round the next corner. \n The little white car was there, pulled in to the side, with its lights out. Bond got in and slumped into his seat. Tracy said nothing but got the car going. The lights of Filisur appeared, warm and yellow in the valley below. She reached out a hand and held his tightly. \u0027You\u0027ve had enough for one day. Go to sleep. I\u0027ll get you to Zьrich. Please do what I say.\u0027 \n Bond said nothing. He pressed her hand weakly, leaned his head against the door jamb and was instantly asleep. \n He was out for the count. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46875.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007之女王密使 On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"简介： 贝洛福在瑞士山区建立一个疗养院，但实际上却阴谋进行一项控制全球的野心计划，就是将病毒注射到女患者身上，然后分派到世界各地，企图掌握世界主权。007奉命调查此案，乔装家谱学家蒙混而入，及时炸毁实验室，挽救了世界。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
