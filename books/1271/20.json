{"id":30888,"no":20,"title":"20 Men Pantoufles","content":"BOND SLEPT in the plane and was visited by a terrible nightmare. It was the hallway of a very grand town-house, an embassy perhaps, and a wide staircase led up under a spangled chandelier to where the butler was standing at the door of the drawing-room, from which came the murmur of a large crowd of guests. Tracy, in oyster satin, was on his arm. She was loaded with jewels and her golden hair had been piled up grandly into one of those fancy arrangements you see in smart hairdressers\u0027 advertisements. On top of the pile was a diamond tiara that glittered gorgeously. Bond was dressed in tails (where in hell had he got those from?), and the wing collar stuck into his neck below the chin. He was wearing his medals, and his order as CMG, on its blue and scarlet ribbon, hung below his white tie. Tracy was chattering, gaily, excitedly, looking forward to the grand evening. Bond was cursing the prospect before him and wishing he was playing a tough game of bridge for high stakes at Blades. They got to the top of the stairs and Bond gave his name. \u0027Commander and Mrs James Bond!\u0027 It was the stentorian bellow of a toast-master. Bond got the impression that a sudden hush fell over the elegant crowd in the gilt and white drawing-room. He followed Tracy through the double doors. There was a gush of French from Tracy as she exchanged those empty \u0027Mayfair\u0027 kisses, that end up wide of the kissers\u0027 ears, with her hostess. Tracy drew Bond forward. \u0027And this is James. Doesn\u0027t he look sweet with that beautiful medal round his neck? Just like the old De Reszke cigarette advertisements!\u0027 \u0027Fasten your seat belts, please, and extinguish your cigarettes.\u0027 Bond awoke, sweating. God Almighty! What had he done? But no! It wouldn\u0027t be like that! Definitely not. He would still have his tough, exciting life, but now there would be Tracy to come home to. Would there be room in his flat in Chelsea? Perhaps he could rent the floor above. And what about May, his Scottish treasure? That would be tricky. He must somehow persuade her to stay. The Caravelle hit the runway and there came the roar of jet deflection, and then they were trundling over the tarmac in a light drizzle. Bond suddenly realized that he had no luggage, that he could go straight to Passport Control and then out and back to his flat to change out of these ridiculous skiing clothes that stank of sweat. Would there be a car from the pool for him? There was, with Miss Mary Goodnight sitting beside the driver. \u0027My God, Mary, this is a hell of a way to spend your Christmas! This is far beyond the line of duty. Anyway, get in the back and tell me why you\u0027re not stirring the plum pudding or going to church or something.\u0027 She climbed in to the back seat and he followed. She said, \u0027You don\u0027t seem to know much about Christmas. You make plum puddings at least two months before and let them sort of settle and mature. And church isn\u0027t till eleven.\u0027 She glanced at him. \u0027Actually I came to see how you were. I gather you\u0027ve been in trouble again. You certainly look pretty ghastly. Don\u0027t you own a comb? And you haven\u0027t shaved. You look like a pirate. And\u0027 - she wrinkled her nose -\u0027when did you last have a bath? I wonder they let you out of the airport. You ought to be in quarantine.\u0027 Bond laughed. \u0027Winter sports are very strenuous - all that snowballing and tobogganing. Matter of fact, I was at a Christmas Eve fancy-dress party last night. Kept me up till all hours.\u0027 \u0027In those great clod-hopping boots? I don\u0027t believe you.\u0027 \u0027Well, sucks to you! It was on a skating-rink. But seriously, Mary, tell me the score. Why this VIP treatment?\u0027 \u0027M. You\u0027re to check with HQ first and then go down to lunch with him at Quarterdeck. Then, after lunch, he\u0027s having these men you wanted brought down for a conference. Everything top priority. So I thought I\u0027d better stand by too. As you\u0027re wrecking so many other people\u0027s Christmases, I thought I might as well throw mine on the slag-heap with the others. Actually, if you want to know, I was only having lunch with an aunt. And I loathe turkey and plum pudding. Anyway, I just didn\u0027t want to miss the fun and when the duty officer got on to me about an hour ago and told me there was a major flap, I asked him to tell the car to pick me up on the way to the airport.\u0027 Bond said seriously, \u0027Well, you\u0027re a damned good girl. As a matter of fact it\u0027s going to be the hell of a rush getting down the bare bones of a report. And I\u0027ve got something for the lab to do. Will there be someone there?\u0027 \u0027Of course there will. You know M insists on a skeleton staff in every Section, Christmas Day or not. But seriously, James. Have you been in trouble? You really do look awful.\u0027 \u0027Oh, somewhat. You\u0027ll get the photo as I dictate.\u0027 The car drew up outside Bond\u0027s flat. \u0027Now be an angel and stir up May while I clean myself up and get out of these bloody clothes. Get her to brew me plenty of black coffee and to pour two jiggers of our best brandy into the pot. You ask May for what you like. She might even have some plum pudding. Now then, it\u0027s nine-thirty. Be a good girl and call the Duty Officer and say OK to M\u0027s orders and that we\u0027ll be along by ten-thirty. And get him to ask the lab to stand by in half an hour.\u0027 Bond took his passport out of his hip-pocket. \u0027Then give this to the driver and ask him to get the hell over and give it to the Duty Officer personally. Tell the DO\u0027 - Bond turned down the corner of a page -\u0027to tell the lab that the ink used is - er - home-made. All it needs is exposure to heat. They\u0027ll understand. Got that? Good girl. Now come on and we\u0027ll get May going.\u0027 Bond went up the steps and rang two shorts and a long on the bell. * * * When Bond got to his desk a few minutes after ten-thirty, feeling back to nine-tenths human, he found a folder on his desk with the red star in the top right corner that meant Top Secret. It contained his passport and a dozen copies of blown-up photostats of its page 21. The list of girls\u0027 names was faint but legible. There was also a note marked \u0027personal\u0027. Bond opened it. He laughed. It just said, \"The ink showed traces of an excess of uric acid. This is often due to a super-abundancy of alcohol in the blood-stream. You have been warned!\u0027 There was no signature. So the Christmas spirit had permeated even into the solemn crevices of one of the most secret Sections in the building! Bond crumpled the paper and then, thinking of Mary Goodnight\u0027s susceptibilities, more prudently burned it with his lighter. She came in and sat down with her shorthand book. Bond said, \u0027Now this is only a first draft, Mary, and it\u0027s got to be fast. So don\u0027t mind about mistakes. M\u0027U understand. We\u0027ve got about an hour and a half if I\u0027m to get down to Windsor by lunch-time. Think you can manage it? All right then, here goes. \"Top Secret. Personal to M. As instructed, on December 22nd I arrived at Zurich Central Airport at 1330 by Swissair to make first contact in connexion with Operation \u0027Corona\u0027…\"\u0027 Bond turned sideways to his secretary and, as he talked, looked out across the bare trees in Regent\u0027s Park, remembering every minute of the last three days - the sharp, empty smell of the air and the snow, the dark green pools of Blofeld\u0027s eyes, the crunch as the edge of his left hand, still bruised, thudded down across the offered neck of the guard. And then all the rest until Tracy, whom, without mention of romance, he left in his report on her way to the Vier Jahres-zeiten in Munich. Then the report was finished and the muted clack of Mary\u0027s typewriter came from behind the closed door. He would ring Tracy up that night when he got back to his flat. He could already hear her laughing voice at the other end of the wire. The nightmare in the plane was forgotten. Now there was only the happy, secret looking-forward to the days to come. Bond lost himself in his plans -how to get the days off, how to get the necessary papers, where to have the service in Scotland. Then he pulled himself together, picked up the photostat containing the girls\u0027 names and went up to the Communications Centre to get on the teleprinter to Station Z. * * * M would have preferred to live by the sea, near Plymouth perhaps or Bristol - anywhere where he could see the stuff whenever he wanted to and could listen to it at night. As it was, and since he had to be within easy call of London, he had chosen the next best thing to water, trees, and had found a small Regency manor-house on the edge of Windsor Forest. This was on Crown Lands, and Bond had always suspected that an ounce of\u0027Grace and Favour\u0027 had found its way into M\u0027s lease. The head of the Secret Service earned ?5,000 a year, with the use of an ancient Rolls Royce and driver thrown in. M\u0027s naval pay (as a Vice-Admiral on the retired list) would add perhaps another ?1,500. After taxes, he would have about ?4,000 to spend. His London life would probably take at least half of that. Only if his rent and rates came to no more than ?500, would he be able to keep a house in the country, and a beautiful small Regency house at that. These thoughts ran again through Bond\u0027s mind as he swung the clapper of the brass ship\u0027s-bell of some former HMS Repulse, the last of whose line, a battle-cruiser, had been M\u0027s final sea-going appointment. Hammond, M\u0027s Chief Petty Officer in that ship, who had followed M into retirement, greeted Bond as an old friend, and he was shown into M\u0027s study. M had one of the stock bachelor\u0027s hobbies. He painted in water-colour. He painted only the wild orchids of England, in the meticulous but uninspired fashion of the naturalists of the nineteenth century. He was now at his painting-table up against the window, his broad back hunched over his drawing-board, with, in front of him, an extremely dim little flower in a tooth-glass full of water. When Bond came in and closed the door, M gave the flower one last piercingly inquisitive glance. He got to his feet with obvious reluctance. But he gave Bond one of his rare smiles and said, \u0027Afternoon, James.\u0027 (He had the sailor\u0027s meticulous observance of the exact midday.) \u0027Happy Christmas and all that. Take a chair.\u0027 M himself went behind his desk and sat down. He was about to come on duty. Bond automatically took his traditional place across the desk from his Chief. M began to fill a pipe. \u0027What the devil\u0027s the name of that fat American detective who\u0027s always fiddling about with orchids, those obscene hybrids from Venezuela and so forth? Then he comes sweating out of his orchid house, eats a gigantic meal of some foreign muck and solves the murder. What\u0027s he called?\u0027 \u0027Nero Wolfe, sir. They\u0027re written by a chap called Rex Stout. I like them.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re readable,\u0027 condescended M. \u0027But I was thinking of the orchid stuff in them. How in hell can a man like those disgusting flowers? Why, they\u0027re damned near animals, and their colours, all those pinks and mauves and the blotchy yellow tongues, are positively hideous! Now that\u0027 - M waved at the meagre little bloom in the tooth-glass -\u0027that\u0027s the real thing. That\u0027s an Autumn Lady\u0027s Tresses - spiranthes spiralis, not that I care particularly. Flowers in England as late as October and should be under the ground by now. But I got this forced-late specimen from a man I know - assistant to a chap called Summerhayes who\u0027s the orchid king at Kew. My friend\u0027s experimenting with cultures of a fungus which oddly enough is a parasite on a lot of orchids, but, at the same time, gets eaten by the orchid and acts as its staple diet. Mycorhiza it\u0027s called.\u0027 M gave another of his rare smiles. \u0027But you needn\u0027t write it down. Just wanted to take a leaf out of this fellow Nero Wolfe\u0027s book. However\u0027 - M brushed the topic aside - \u0027can\u0027t expect you to get excited about these things. Now then.\u0027 He settled back. \u0027What the devil have you been up to?\u0027 The grey eyes regarded Bond keenly. \u0027Looks as if you haven\u0027t been getting much sleep. Pretty gay these winter sport places, they tell me.\u0027 Bond smiled. He reached into his inside pocket and took out the pinned sheets of paper. \u0027This one provided plenty of miscellaneous entertainment, sir. Perhaps you\u0027d like to have a look at my report first. \u0027Fraid it\u0027s only a draft. There wasn\u0027t much time. But I can fill in anything that isn\u0027t clear.\u0027 M reached across for the papers, adjusted his spectacles, and began reading. Soft rain scratched at the windows. A big log fell in the grate. The silence was soft and comfortable. Bond looked round the walls at M\u0027s treasured collection of naval prints. Everywhere there were mountainous seas, crashing cannon, bellying sails, tattered battle pennants - the fury of ancient engagements, the memories of ancient enemies, the French, the Dutch, the Spaniards, even the Americans. All gone, all friends now with one another. Not a sign of the enemies of today. Who was backing Blofeld, for instance, in the inscrutable conspiracy in which he was now certainly engaged? The Russians? The Chinese? Or was it an independent job, as Thunderball had been? And what was the conspiracy? What was the job for the protection of which six or seven of Blofeld\u0027s men had died within less than a week? Would M read anything into the evidence? Would the experts who were coming that afternoon? Bond lifted his left wrist. Remembered that he no longer had a watch. That he would certainly be allowed on expenses. He would get another one as soon as the shops opened after Boxing Day. Another Rolex? Probably. They were on the heavy side, but they worked. And at least you could see the time in the dark with those big phosphorus numerals. Somewhere in the hall, a clock struck the half-hour. 1.30. Twelve hours before, he must have just set up the trap that killed the three men in the Mercedes. Self-defence, but the hell of a way to celebrate Christmas! M threw the papers down on his desk. His pipe had gone out and he now slowly lit it again. He tossed the spent match accurately over his shoulder into the fire. He put his hands fiat on the desk and said - and there was an unusual kindness in his voice - \u0027Well, you were pretty lucky to get out of that one, James. Didn\u0027t know you could ski.\u0027 \u0027I only just managed to stay upright, sir. Wouldn\u0027t like to try it again.\u0027 \u0027No. And I see you say you can\u0027t come to any conclusions about what Blofeld is up to?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right, sir. Haven\u0027t got a clue.\u0027 \u0027Well, nor have I. I just don\u0027t understand any part of it. Perhaps the professors\u0027ll help us out this afternoon. But you\u0027re obviously right that it\u0027s SPECTRE all over again. By the way, your tip about Pontresina was a good one. He was a Bulgar. Can\u0027t remember his name, but Interpol turned him up for us. Plastic explosives expert. Worked for KBG in Turkey. If it\u0027s true that the U2 that fellow Powers was piloting was brought down by delayed charges and not by rockets, it may be this man was implicated. He was on the list of suspects. Then he turned free-lance. Went into business on his own. That\u0027s probably when SPECTRE picked him up. We were doubtful about your identification of Blofeld. The Pontresina lead helped a lot. You\u0027re absolutely sure of him, are you? He certainly seems to have done a good job on his face and stomach. Better set him up on the Identicast when you get back this evening. We\u0027ll have a look at him and get the views of the medical gentry.\u0027 \u0027I think it must be him, sir. I was really getting the authentic smell of him on the last day - yesterday, that is. It seems a long time ago already.\u0027 \u0027You were lucky to run into this girl. Who is she? Some old flame of yours?\u0027 M\u0027s mouth turned down at the corners. \u0027More or less, sir. She came into my report on the first news we got that Blofeld was in Switzerland. Daughter of this man Draco, head of the union Corse. Her mother was an English governess.\u0027 \u0027Hm. Interesting breeding. Now then. Time for lunch. I told Hammond we weren\u0027t to be disturbed.\u0027 M got up and pressed the bell by the fire-place. \"Fraid we\u0027ve got to go through the turkey and plum pudding routine. Mrs Hammond\u0027s been brooding over her pots and pans for weeks. Damned sentimental rubbish.\u0027 Hammond appeared at the door, and Bond followed M through and into the small dining-room beyond the hall whose walls glittered with M\u0027s other hobby, the evolution of the naval cutlass. They sat down. M said, with mock ferocity, to Hammond, \u0027All right, Chief Petty Officer Hammond. Do your worst.\u0027 And then, with real vehemence, \u0027What in hell are those things doing here?\u0027 He pointed at the centre of the table. \u0027Crackers, sir,\" said Hammond stolidly. \u0027Mrs Hammond thought that seeing as you have company…\u0027 \u0027Throw them out. Give \u0027em to the schoolchildren. I\u0027ll go so far with Mrs Hammond, but I\u0027m damned if I\u0027m going to have my dining-room turned into a nursery.\u0027 Hammond smiled. He said, \u0027Aye, aye, sir,\u0027 gathered up the shimmering crackers and departed. Bond was aching for a drink. He got a small glass of very old Marsala and most of a bottle of very bad Algerian wine. M treated his two glasses as if they had been Chateau Lafitte. \u0027Good old \"Infuriator\". Staple drink for the fleet in the Mediterranean. Got real guts to it. I remember an old shipmate of mine, McLachlan, my Chief Gunnery Officer at the time, betting he could get down six bottles of the stuff. Damn fool. Measured his length on the wardroom floor after only three. Drink up, James! Drink up!\u0027 At last the plum pudding arrived, flaming traditionally. Mrs Hammond had implanted several cheap silver gewgaws in it and M nearly broke a tooth on the miniature horseshoe. Bond got the bachelor\u0027s button. He thought of Tracy. It should have been the ring!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46877.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007之女王密使 On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"简介： 贝洛福在瑞士山区建立一个疗养院，但实际上却阴谋进行一项控制全球的野心计划，就是将病毒注射到女患者身上，然后分派到世界各地，企图掌握世界主权。007奉命调查此案，乔装家谱学家蒙混而入，及时炸毁实验室，挽救了世界。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
