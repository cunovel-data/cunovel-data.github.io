{"id":30874,"no":6,"title":"6 Bond of Bond Street?","content":"IT WAS two months later, in London, and James Bond was driving lazily up from his Chelsea flat to his headquarters. \\n\\n It was nine-thirty in the morning of yet another beautiful day of this beautiful year, but, in Hyde Park, the fragrance of burning leaves meant that winter was only just round the corner. Bond had nothing on his mind except the frustration of waiting for Station Z somehow to penetrate the reserves of the Swiss Securite and come up with the exact address of Blofeld. But their \u0027friends\u0027 in Zurich were continuing to prove obtuse, or, more probably, obstinate. There was no trace of any man, either tourist or resident, called Blofeld in the whole of Switzerland. Nor was there any evidence of the existence of a reborn SPECTRE on Swiss soil. Yes, they fully realized that Blofeld was still urgently \u0027wanted\u0027 by the governments of the NATO alliance. They had carefully filed all the circulars devoted to the apprehension of this man, and for the past year he had been constantly reconfirmed on their \u0027watch\u0027 lists at all frontier posts. They were very sorry, but unless the SIS could come up with further information or evidence about this man, they must assume that the SIS was acting on mistaken evidence. Station Z had asked for an examination of the secret lists at the banks, a search through those anonymous \u0027numbered\u0027 accounts which conceal the owners of most of the fugitive money in the world. This request had been peremptorily refused. Blofeld was certainly a great criminal, but the Securite must point out that such information could only be legally obtained if the criminal in question was guilty of some crime committed on Federal soil and indictable under the Federal Code. It was true that this Blofeld had held up Britain and America to ransom by his illegal possession of atomic weapons. But this could not be considered a crime under the laws of Switzerland, and particularly not having regard to Article 4?B of the banking laws. So that was that! The Holy Franc, and the funds which backed it, wherever they came from, must remain untouchable. Wir bitten hoflichst um Entschuldigung! \\n\\n Bond wondered if he should get in touch with Marc-Ange. So far, in his report, he had revealed only a lead into the union Corse, whom he gave, corporately, as the source of his information. But he shied away from this course of action, which would surely have, as one consequence, the reopening with Marc-Ange of the case of Tracy. And that corner of his life, of his heart, he wanted to leave undisturbed for the time being. Their last evening together had passed quietly, almost as if they had been old friends, old lovers. Bond had said that Universal Export was sending him abroad for some time. They would certainly meet when he returned to Europe. The girl had accepted this arrangement. She herself had decided to go away for a rest. She had been doing too much. She had been on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She would wait for him. Perhaps they could go skiing together around Christmas time? Bond had been enthusiastic. That night, after a wonderful dinner at Bond\u0027s little restaurant, they had made love, happily, and this time without desperation, without tears. Bond was satisfied that the cure had really begun. He felt deeply protective towards her. But he knew that their relationship, and her equanimity, rested on a knife-edge which must not be disturbed. \\n\\n It was at this moment in his reflections that the Syncra-phone in his trouser pocket began to bleep. Bond accelerated out of the park and drew up beside the public telephone booth at Marble Arch. The Syncraphone had recently been introduced and was carried by all officers attached to Headquarters. It was a light plastic radio receiver about the size of a pocket watch. When an officer was somewhere in London, within a range of ten miles of Headquarters, he could be bleeped on the receiver. When this happened, it was his duty to go at once to the nearest telephone and contact his office. He was urgently needed. \\n\\n Bond rang his exchange on the only outside number he was allowed to use, said \u0027007 reporting,\u0027 and was at once put through to his secretary. She was a new one. Loelia Ponsonby had at last left to marry a dull, but worthy and rich member of the Baltic Exchange, and confined her contacts with her old job to rather yearning Christmas and birthday cards to the members of the Double-O Section. But the new one, Mary Goodnight, an ex-Wren with blue-black hair, blue eyes, and 37-22-35, was a honey and there was a private five-pound sweep in the Section as to who would get her first. Bond had been lying equal favourite with the ex-Royal Marine Commando who was 006 but, since Tracy, had dropped out of the field and now regarded himself as a rank outsider, though he still, rather bitchily, flirted with her. Now he said to her,\u0027 Good morning, Goodnight. What can I do for you? Is it war or peace?\u0027 \\n\\n She giggled unprofessionally. \u0027It sounds fairly peaceful, as peaceful as a hurry message from upstairs can be. You\u0027re to go at once to the College of Arms and ask for Griffon Or.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Or what?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Just Or. Oh, and he\u0027s Pursuivant as well, whatever that means. He\u0027s one of the Heralds. Apparently they\u0027ve got some kind of a line on \"Bedlam\".\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Bedlam\u0027 was the code name for the pursuit of Blofeld. Bond said respectfully, \u0027Have they indeed? Then I\u0027d better get cracking. Goodbye, Goodnight.\u0027 He heard her giggle before he put the receiver down. \\n\\n Now what the hell? Bond got back into his car, that had mercifully not yet attracted the police or the traffic wardens, and motored fast across London. This was a queer one. How the hell did the College of Arms, of which he knew very little except that they hunted up people\u0027s family trees, allotted coats of arms, and organized various royal ceremonies, get into the act? \\n\\n The College of Arms is in Queen Victoria Street on the fringe of the City. It is a pleasant little Queen Anne backwater in ancient red brick with white sashed windows and a convenient cobbled courtyard, where Bond parked his car. There are horseshoe-shaped stone stairs leading up to an impressive entrance, over which, that day, there hung a banner showing a splendid heraldic beast, half animal and half bird, in gold against a pale blue background. Griffon, thought Bond. Made of Or. He went through the door into a large gloomy hall whose dark panelling was lined with the musty portraits of proud-looking gentlemen in ruffs and lace, and from whose cornice hung the banners of the Commonwealth. The porter, a kindly, soft-spoken man in a cherry-coloured uniform with brass buttons, asked Bond what he could do for him. Bond asked for the Griffon Or and confirmed that he had an appointment. \\n\\n \u0027Ah yes, sir,\u0027 said the porter mysteriously.\u0027 Griffon Or is in waiting this week. That is why his banner is flying outside. This way please, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond followed the porter along a passage hung with gleaming coats of arms in carved wood, up a dank, cobwebby staircase, and round a corner to a heavy door over which was written in gold \u0027Griffon Or Pursuivant\u0027 under a representation of the said golden griffon. The porter knocked, opened the door and announced Bond, and left him facing, across an unkempt study Uttered with books, papers, and important-looking inscribed parchments, the top of a bald, round pink head fringed with grizzled curls. The room smelt like the crypt of a church. Bond walked down the narrow lane of carpet left between the piles of litter and stood beside the single chair that faced the man behind the books on the desk. He cleared his throat. The man looked up and the Pickwickian, pince-nez\u0027d face broke into an absent smile. He got to his feet and made a little bow. \u0027Bond,\u0027 he said in a voice that creaked like the lid of an old chest. \u0027Commander James Bond. Now then, Bond, Bond, Bond. I think I\u0027ve got you here.\" He had kept his finger at the open page of a vast tome. He now sat down and Bond followed suit. \u0027Yes, yes, yes. Very interesting indeed. Very. But I fear I have to disappoint you, my dear sir. The title is extinct. Actually it\u0027s a baronetcy. Most desirable. But no doubt we can establish a relationship through a collateral branch. Now then\u0027 - he put his pince-nez very close to the page - \u0027we have some ten different families of Bonds. The important one ended with Sir Thomas Bond, a most distinguished gentleman. He resided in Peckhain. He had, alas, no issue\u0027 - the pince-nez gleamed encouragingly at Bond - \u0027no legitimate issue that is. Of course in those days, ahem, morals were inclined to be laxer. Now if we could establish some connexion with Peckham…\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I have no connexion with Peckham. Now, I…\u0027 \\n\\n Griffon Or held up his hand. He said severely, \u0027Where did your parents come from, if I may ask? That, my dear fellow, is the first step in the chain. Then we can go back from there -Somerset House, parish records, old tomb-stones. No doubt, with a good old English name like yours, we will get somewhere in the end.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027My father was a Scot and my mother was Swiss. But the point is…\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Quite, quite. You are wondering about the cost of the research. That, my dear fellow, we can leave until later. But, now tell me. From whereabouts in Scotland did your father come? That is important. The Scottish records are of course less fully documented than those from the South. In those days I am forced to admit that our cousins across the border were little more than savages.\u0027 Griffon Or bobbed his head politely. He gave a fleeting and, to Bond\u0027s eye, rather false smile. \u0027Very pleasant savages, of course, very brave and all that. But, alas, very weak at keeping up their records. More useful with the sword than with the pen, if I may say so. But perhaps your grandparents and their forebears came from the South?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027My father came from the Highlands, from near Glencoe. But look here…\u0027 \\n\\n But Griffon Or was not to be diverted from the scent. He pulled another thick book towards him. His finger ran down the page of small print. \u0027Hum. Hum. Hum. Yes, yes. Not very encouraging, I fear. Burke\u0027s General Armory gives more than ten different families bearing your name. But, alas, nothing in Scotland. Not that that means there is no Scottish branch. Now, perhaps you have other relatives living. So often in these matters there is some distant cousin…\u0027 Griffon Or reached into the pocket of the purple-flowered silk waistcoat that buttoned almost up to his neat bow tie, fished out a small silver snuff-box, offered it to Bond and then himself took two tremendous sniffs. He exploded twice into an ornate bandana handkerchief. \\n\\n Bond took his opportunity. He leaned forward and said distinctly and forcibly, \u0027I didn\u0027t come here to talk about myself. It\u0027s about Blofeld.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 Griffon Or looked at him in astonishment. \u0027You are not interested in your line of descent?\u0027 He held up an admonishing finger. \u0027Do you realize, my dear fellow, that if we are successful, you may be able to claim direct\u0027 - he hesitated - \u0027or at any rate collateral descent from an ancient baronetcy founded\u0027 - he went back to his first volume and peered at it - \u0027in the year 1658! Does it not excite you that a possible ancestor of yours was responsible for the name of one of the most famous streets in the world -1 refer of course to Bond Street? That was the Sir Thomas Bond, Baronet of Peckham in the County of Surrey, who, as you are no doubt aware, was Comptroller of the household of the Queen Mother, Henrietta Maria. The street was built in 1686 and its associations with famous British folk are, of course, well known. The first Duke of St Albans, son of Nell Gwynn, lived there, as did Laurence Sterne. Boswell\u0027s famous dinner party took place there, with Johnson, Reynolds, Goldsmith, and Garrick being present. Dean Swift and Canning were residents at different times, and it is intriguing to recall that while Lord Nelson lived at number 141, Lady Hamilton lived at number 145. And this, my dear sir, is the great thoroughfare of which you bear the name! Do you still wish to establish no claim to this vastly distinguished connexion? No?\u0027 The bushy eyebrows, raised in astonishment, were now lowered in further admonishment. \u0027This is the very warp and woof of history, my dear Commander Bond.\u0027 He reached for another volume that lay open on his desk and that he had obviously prepared for Bond\u0027s delectation. \u0027The coat of arms, for instance. Surely that must concern you, be at least of profound interest to your family, to your own children? Yes, here we are. \"Argent on a chevron sable three bezants \".\u0027 He held up the book so that Bond could see. \u0027A bezant is a golden ball, as I am sure you know. Three balls.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond commented drily, \u0027That is certainly a valuable bonus\u0027 - the irony was lost on Griffon Or - \u0027but I\u0027m afraid I am still not interested. And I have no relatives and no children. Now about this man…\u0027 \\n\\n Griffon Or broke in excitedly, \u0027And this charming motto of the line, \"The World is not Enough\". You do not wish to have the right to it?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027It is an excellent motto which I shall certainly adopt,\u0027 said Bond curtly. He looked pointedly at his watch. \u0027Now, I\u0027m afraid we really must get down to business. I have to report back to my Ministry.\u0027 \\n\\n Griffon Or Pursuivant looked genuinely affronted. \u0027And here is a name going back at least to Norman le Bond in 1180! A fine old English name, though one perhaps originally of lowly origin. The Dictionary of British Surnames suggests that the meaning is clearly \"husbandman, peasant, churl\".\u0027 Was there an edge of malice in the Griffon\u0027s watery eye? He added with resignation, \u0027But, if you are not interested in your ancestry, in the womb of your family, then, my dear sir, in what can I be of service?\u0027 \\n\\n At last! James Bond let out a sigh of relief. He said patiently, \u0027I came here to inquire about a certain Blofeld, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It seems that your organization has some information about this man.\u0027 \\n\\n Griffon Or\u0027s eyes were suddenly suspicious. \u0027But you represented yourself as a Commander James Bond. And now the name is Blofeld. How does this come about?\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said icily, \u0027I am from the Ministry of Defence. Somewhere in this building is information about a man called Blofeld. Where can I find it?\u0027 \\n\\n Griffon Or ran a puzzled hand round his halo of curls. \u0027Blofeld, is it? Well, well.\u0027 He looked accusingly at Bond. \u0027Forgive me, but you certainly have wasted plenty of my, of the College\u0027s time. Commander Bond. It is a mystery to me why you did not mention this man\u0027s name before. Now let me see, Blofeld, Blofeld. Seem to recall that it came up at one of our Chapter meetings the other day. Now who had the case? Ah, yes.\u0027 He reached for a telephone among the nest of books and papers. \u0027Give me Sable Basilisk.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46863.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007之女王密使 On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"简介： 贝洛福在瑞士山区建立一个疗养院，但实际上却阴谋进行一项控制全球的野心计划，就是将病毒注射到女患者身上，然后分派到世界各地，企图掌握世界主权。007奉命调查此案，乔装家谱学家蒙混而入，及时炸毁实验室，挽救了世界。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
