{"id":30876,"no":8,"title":"8 Fancy Cover","content":"\u0027AND WHO the hell are you supposed to be?\u0027 \\n\\n M more or less repeated Bond\u0027s question when, that evening, he looked up from the last page of the report that Bond had spent the afternoon dictating to Mary Goodnight. M\u0027s face was just outside the pool of yellow light cast by the green-shaded reading lamp on his desk, but Bond knew that the lined, sailor\u0027s face was reflecting, in varying degrees, scepticism, irritation, and impatience. The \u0027hell\u0027 told him so. M rarely swore and when he did it was nearly always at stupidity. M obviously regarded Bond\u0027s plan as stupid, and now, away from the dedicated, minutely focused world of the Heralds, Bond wasn\u0027t sure that M wasn\u0027t right. \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m to be an emissary from the College of Arms, sir. This Basilisk chap recommended that I should have some kind of a title, the sort of rather highfalutin one that would impress a man with this kind of bee in his bonnet. And Blofeld\u0027s obviously got this bee or he wouldn\u0027t have revealed his existence, even to such a presumably secure and - er - sort of remote corner of the world as the College of Arms. I\u0027ve put down there the arguments of this chap and they make a lot of sense to me. Snobbery\u0027s a real Achilles heel with people. Blofeld\u0027s obviously got the bug badly. I think we can get to him through it.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well, I think it\u0027s all a pack of nonsense,\u0027 said M testily. (Not many years before, M had been awarded the KCMG for his services, and Miss Moneypenny, his desirable secretary, had revealed in a moment of candour to Bond that M had not replied to a single one of the notes and letters of congratulation. After a while he had refused even to read them and had told Miss Moneypenny not to show him any more but to throw them in the wastepaper basket.) \u0027All right then, what\u0027s this ridiculous title to be? And what happens next?\u0027 \\n\\n If Bond had been able to blush, he would have blushed. He said, \u0027Er - well, sir, it seems there\u0027s a chap called Sir Hilary Bray. Friend of Sable Basilisk\u0027s. About my age and not unlike me to look at. His family came from some place in Normandy. Family tree as long as your arm. William the Conqueror and all that. And a coat of arms that looks like a mixture between a jigsaw puzzle and Piccadilly Circus at night. Well, Sable Basilisk says he can fix it with him. This man\u0027s got a good war record and sounds a reliable sort of chap. He lives in some remote glen in the Highlands, watching birds and climbing the hills with bare feet. Never sees a soul. No reason why anyone in Switzerland should have heard of him.\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice became defensive, stubborn. \u0027Well, sir, the idea is that I should be him. Rather fancy cover, but I think it makes sense.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Sir Hilary Bray, eh?\u0027 M tried to conceal his scorn. \u0027And then what do you do? Run around the Alps waving this famous banner of his?\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said patiently, obstinately, refusing to be browbeaten, \u0027First I\u0027ll get Passport Control to fix up a good passport. Then I mug up Bray\u0027s family tree until I\u0027m word-perfect on the thing. Then I swot away at the rudiments of this heraldry business. Then, if Blofeld takes the bait, I go out to Switzerland with all the right books and suggest that I work out his de Bleuville pedigree with him.\" \\n\\n \u0027Then what?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Then I try and winkle him out of Switzerland, get him over the frontier to somewhere where we can do a kidnap job on him, rather like the Israelis did with Eichmann. But I haven\u0027t worked out all the details yet, sir. Had to get your approval and then Sable Basilisk has got to make up a damned attractive fly and throw it over these Zurich solicitors.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why not try putting pressure on the Zurich solicitors and winkle Blofeld\u0027s address out of them? Then we might think of doing some kind of a commando job.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You know the Swiss, sir. God knows what kind of a retainer these lawyers have from Blofeld. But it\u0027s bound to be millionaire size. We might eventually get the address, but they\u0027d be bound to tip off Blofeld if only to lay their hands on their fees before he vamoosed. Money\u0027s the religion of Switzerland.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t need a lecture on the qualities of the Swiss, thank you, 007. At least they keep their trains clean and cope with the beatnik problem [two very rampant bees in M\u0027s bonnet!], but I daresay there\u0027s some truth in what you say. Oh, well.\u0027 M wearily pushed the file over to Bond. \u0027Take it away. It\u0027s a messy-looking bird\u0027s-nest of a plan. But I suppose it had better go ahead.\u0027 M shook his head sceptically. \u0027Sir Hilary Bray! Oh, well, tell the Chief of Staff I approve. But reluctantly. Tell him you can have the facilities. Keep me informed.\u0027 M reached for the Cabinet telephone. His voice was deeply disgruntled. \u0027Suppose I\u0027ll have to tell the PM we\u0027ve got a line on the chap. The kind of tangle it is, I\u0027ll keep to myself. That\u0027s all, 007.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Thank you, sir. Goodnight.\u0027 As Bond went across to the door he heard M say into the green receiver, \u0027M speaking. I want the Prime Minister personally, please.\u0027 He might have been asking for the mortuary. Bond went out and softly closed the door behind him. \\n\\n * * * \\n\\n So, as November blustered its way into December, James Bond went unwillingly back to school, swotting up heraldry at his desk instead of top-secret reports, picking up scraps of medieval French and English, steeping himself in fusty lore and myth, picking the brains of Sable Basilisk and occasionally learning interesting facts, such as that the founders of Gamages came from the de Gamaches in Normandy and that Walt Disney was remotely descended from the d\u0027Isignys of the same part of France. But these were nuggets in a wasteland of archaisms, and when, one day, Mary Goodnight, in reply to some sally of his, addressed him as \u0027Sir Hilary\u0027 he nearly bit her head off. \\n\\n Meanwhile the highly delicate correspondence between Sable Basilisk and the Gebr—åder Moosbrugger proceeded haltingly and at a snail\u0027s pace. They, or rather Blofeld behind them, posed countless irritating but, Sable Basilisk admitted, erudite queries each one of which had to be countered with this or that degree of heraldic obfuscation. Then there were minute questions about this emissary, Sir Hilary Bray. Photographs were asked for, and, suitably doctored, were provided. His whole career since his schooldays had to be detailed and was sent down from Scotland with a highly amused covering note from the real man. To test the market, more funds were asked for by Sable Basilisk and, with encouraging promptitude, were forthcoming in the shape of a further thousand pounds. When the cheque arrived on December 15th Sable Basilisk telephoned Bond delightedly. \u0027We\u0027ve got him,\u0027 he said. \u0027He\u0027s hooked!\u0027 And, sure enough, the next day came a letter from Zurich to say that their client agreed to a meeting with Sir Hilary. Would Sir Hilary please arrive at Zurich Central Airport by Swissair flight Number 105, due at Zurich at 1300 hours on December 21st. On Bond\u0027s prompting, Sable Basilisk wrote back that the date was not convenient to Sir Hilary owing to a prior engagement with the Canadian High Commissioner regarding a detail in the Arms of the Hudson\u0027s Bay Company. Sir Hilary could, however, manage the 22nd. By return came a cable agreeing and, to Bond, confirming that the fish had not only swallowed the hook but the line and sinker as well. \\n\\n The last few days were spent in a flurry of meetings, with the Chief of Staff presiding, at Headquarters. The main decisions were that Bond should go to the meeting with Blofeld absolutely \u0027clean\u0027. He would carry no weapons, no secret gear of any kind, and he would not be watched or followed by the Service in any way. He would communicate only with Sable Basilisk, getting across such information as he could by using heraldic double talk (Sable Basilisk had been cleared by MI5 immediately after Bond\u0027s first meeting with him), and Sable Basilisk, who vaguely thought that Bond was employed by the Ministry of Defence, would be given a cut-out at the Ministry who would be his go-between with the Service. This was all assuming that Bond managed to stay close to Blofeld for at least a matter of days. And that was to be his basic stratagem. It was essential to find out as much as possible about Blofeld, his activities and his associates, in order to proceed with planning the next step, his abduction from Switzerland. Physical action might not be necessary. Bond might be able to trick the man into a visit to Germany, as a result of a report which Sable Basilisk had prepared of certain Blofeld family documents at the Augsburg Zentral Archiv, which would need Blofeld\u0027s personal identification. Security precautions would include keeping Station Z completely in the dark about Bond\u0027s mission to Switzerland and a closure of the \u0027Bedlam\u0027 file at Headquarters which would be announced in the routine \u0027Orders of the Day\u0027. Instead, a new code-word for the operation, known only to an essential handful of senior officers, would be issued. It would be \u0027CORONA\u0027. \\n\\n Finally, the personal dangers to Bond himself were discussed. There was total respect for Blofeld at Headquarters. Nobody questioned his abilities or his ruthlessness. If Bond\u0027s true identity somehow became known to Blofeld, Bond would of course instantly be liquidated. A more dangerous and likely event would be that, once Blofeld had probed Bond\u0027s heraldic gen to its rather shallow bottom and it had been proved that he was or was not the Comte de Bleuville, Sir Hilary Bray, his usefulness expended, might \u0027meet with an accident\u0027. Bond would just have to face up to these hazards and watch out particularly for the latter. He, and Sable Basilisk behind him, would have to keep some tricks up their sleeves, tricks that would somehow make Sir Hilary Bray\u0027s continued existence important to Blofeld. In conclusion, the Chief of Staff said he considered the whole operation \u0027a lot of bezants\u0027 and that \u0027Bezants\u0027 would have been a better code-word than \u0027Corona\u0027. However, he wished Bond the best of luck and said, cold-heartedly, that he would instruct the Technical Section to proceed forthwith with the devising of a consignment of explosive snowballs for Bond\u0027s protection. \\n\\n It was on this cheery note that Bond, on the evening of December 21st, returned to his office for a last run-through of his documentation with Mary Goodnight. \\n\\n He sat sideways to his desk, looking out over the triste winter twilight of Regent\u0027s Park under snow, while she sat opposite him and ran through the items: \u0027Burke\u0027s Extinct and Dormant Baronetage, property of the College of Heralds. Stamped \"Not to be removed from the Library\". The printed Visitations in the College of Arms, stamped ditto. Genealogist\u0027s Guide, by G. W. Marshall, with Hatchard\u0027s receipted bill to Sable Basilisk inserted. Bur he\u0027s General Armory, stamped \"Property of the London Library\", wrapped and franked December 10th. Passport in the name of Sir Hilary Bray, containing various recently-dated frontier stamps in and out of France, Germany, and the Low Countries, fairly well used and dog-eared. One large file of correspondence with Augsburg and Zurich on College of Arms writing-paper and the writing-paper of the addressees. And that\u0027s the lot. You\u0027ve fixed your laundry tags and so on?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Bond dully. \u0027I\u0027ve fixed all that. And I\u0027ve got two new suits with cuffs and double vents at the back and four buttons down the front. Also a gold watch and chain with the Bray seal. Quite the little baronet.\u0027 Bond turned and looked across the desk at Mary Goodnight. \u0027What do you think of this caper, Mary? Think it\u0027ll come off?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well, it should do,\u0027 she said staunchly. \u0027With all the trouble that\u0027s been taken. But\u0027 - she hesitated - \u0027I don\u0027t like you taking this man on without a gun.\u0027 She waved a hand at the pile on the floor. \u0027And all these stupid books about heraldry! It\u0027s just not you. You will take care, won\u0027t you?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027ll do that all right,\u0027 said Bond reassuringly. \u0027Now, be a good girl and get a radio taxi to the Universal Export entrance. And put all that junk inside it, would you? I\u0027ll be down in a minute. I\u0027ll be at the flat all this evening\u0027 - he smiled sourly - \u0027packing my silk shirts with the crests on them.\u0027 He got up. \u0027So long, Mary. Or rather goodnight, Goodnight. And keep out of trouble till I get back.\u0027 \\n\\n She said, \u0027You do that yourself.\u0027 She bent and picked up the books and papers from the floor and, keeping her face hidden from Bond, went to the door and kicked it shut behind her with her heel. A moment or two later she opened the door again. Her eyes were bright. I\u0027m sorry, James. Good luck! And Happy Christmas!\u0027 She closed the door softly behind her. \\n\\n Bond looked at the blank face of the Office of Works cream door. What a dear girl Mary was! But now there was Tracy. He would be near her in Switzerland. It was time to make contact again. He had been missing her, wondering about her. There had been three non-committal but cheerful postcards from the Clinique de 1\u0027Aube at Davos. Bond had made inquiries and had ascertained that this was run by a Professor Auguste Kommer, President of the Societ–π Psychia-trique et Psychologique Suisse. Over the telephone, Sir James Molony, the nerve specialist by appointment to the Service, had told Bond that Kommer was one of the top men in the world at his job. Bond had written affectionately and encouragingly to Tracy and had had the letters posted from America. He had said he would be home soon and would be in touch with her. Would he? And what would he do then? Bond had a luxurious moment feeling sorry for himself, for the miscellaneous burdens he was carrying alone. He then crushed out his cigarette and, banging doors behind him, got the hell out of his office and down in the lift to the discreet side-entrance that said \u0027Universal Export\u0027. \\n\\n The taxi was waiting. It was seven o\u0027clock. As the taxi got under way, Bond made his plan for the evening. He would first do an extremely careful packing job of his single suitcase, the one that had no tricks to it, have two double vodkas and tonics with a dash of Angostura, eat a large dish of May\u0027s speciality - scrambled eggs fines herbes - have two more vodkas and tonics, and then, slightly drunk, go to bed with half a grain of second. \\n\\n Encouraged by the prospect of this cosy self-anaesthesia, Bond brusquely kicked his problems under the carpet of his consciousness. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46865.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007‰πãÂ•≥ÁéãÂØÜ‰Ωø On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"ÁÆÄ‰ªãÔºö Ë¥ùÊ¥õÁ¶èÂú®ÁëûÂ£´Â±±Âå∫Âª∫Á´ã‰∏Ä‰∏™ÁñóÂÖªÈô¢Ôºå‰ΩÜÂÆûÈôÖ‰∏äÂç¥Èò¥Ë∞ãËøõË°å‰∏ÄÈ°πÊéßÂà∂ÂÖ®ÁêÉÁöÑÈáéÂøÉËÆ°ÂàíÔºåÂ∞±ÊòØÂ∞ÜÁóÖÊØíÊ≥®Â∞ÑÂà∞Â•≥ÊÇ£ËÄÖË∫´‰∏äÔºåÁÑ∂ÂêéÂàÜÊ¥æÂà∞‰∏ñÁïåÂêÑÂú∞Ôºå‰ºÅÂõæÊéåÊè°‰∏ñÁïå‰∏ªÊùÉ„ÄÇ007Â•âÂëΩË∞ÉÊü•Ê≠§Ê°àÔºå‰πîË£ÖÂÆ∂Ë∞±Â≠¶ÂÆ∂ËíôÊ∑∑ËÄåÂÖ•ÔºåÂèäÊó∂ÁÇ∏ÊØÅÂÆûÈ™åÂÆ§ÔºåÊåΩÊïë‰∫Ü‰∏ñÁïå„ÄÇ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
