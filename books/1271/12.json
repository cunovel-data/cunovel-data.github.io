{"id":30880,"no":12,"title":"12 Two Near Misses","content":"BOND WAS shown out of the building by a man in a white coat with the conventional white gauze of the laboratory worker over the lower half of his face. Bond attempted no conversation. He was now well inside the fortress, but he would have to continue to walk on tiptoe and be damned careful where he put his feet! He returned to his room and got out one of the giant sheets of squared paper with which he had been furnished. He sat down at his table and wrote firmly at the top centre of the paper \u0027Guillaume de Bleuville, 1207-1243\u0027. Now there were five hundred years of de Bleuvilles, with their wives and children, to be copied down from his books and notes. That would fill up an impressive number of pages with impeccable fact. He could certainly spread that chore over three days, interspersed with more tricky work - gassing with Blofeld about the Blofeld end of the story. Fortunately there were some English Blofields he could throw in as makeweight. And some Bluefields and Blumfields. He could start some pretty hares running in those directions! And, in between these idiotic activities, he would ferret and ferret away at the mystery of what in hell the new Blofeld, the new SPECTRE, were up to! One thing was certain, they had already been through his belongings. Before going for his interview, Bond had gone into the bathroom, away from that seemingly watchful hole in the ceiling, and had painfully pulled out half a dozen of his hairs. These, while he had selected the books he needed to take with him, he had dispersed inconspicuously among his other papers and in his passport. The hairs were all gone. Someone had been through all his books. He got up and went to the chest of drawers, ostensibly for a handkerchief. Yes, the careful patterns in which he had laid out his things had all been minutely disturbed. Unemotionally he went back to his work, thanking heaven he had travelled as \u0027clean\u0027 as a whistle! But by God he\u0027d have to keep his cover solid! He didn\u0027t at all like the thought of that one-way trip down the bob-run! Bond got as far as 1350 and then the noise from the veranda became too distracting. Anyway, he had done a respectable stint, almost to the bottom of the giant page. He would go out and do a little very discreet exploring. He wanted to get his bearings, or rather confirm them, and this would be a perfectly reasonable activity for a newcomer. He had left his door into the passage ajar. He went out and along to the reception lounge, where the man in the plum coat was busy entering the names of the morning\u0027s visitors in a book. Bond\u0027s greeting was politely answered. There was a ski-room and workshop to the left of the exit. Bond wandered in. One of the Balkan types was at the workbench, screwing a new binding on to a ski. He looked up and went on with his work while Bond gazed with seeming curiosity at the ranks of skis standing along the wall. Things had changed since his day. The bindings were quite different and designed, it seemed, to keep the heel dead flat on the ski. And there were new safety releases. Many of the skis were of metal and the ski-sticks were fibre-glass lances that looked to Bond extremely dangerous in the event of a bad fall. Bond wandered over to the work-bench and feigned interest in what the man was doing. In fact he had seen something that excited him very much - an untidy pile of lengths of thin plastic strip for the boot to rest on in the binding, so that, on the shiny surface, snow would not ball under the sole. Bond leaned over the work-bench, resting on his right elbow, and commented on the precision of the man\u0027s work. The man grunted and concentrated all the more closely to avoid further conversation. Bond\u0027s left hand slid under his leaning arm, secured one of the strips and slid it up his sleeve. He made a further inane comment, which was not answered, and strolled out of the ski-room. (When the man in the workshop heard the front door hiss shut, be turned to the pile of plastic strips and counted them carefully twice. Then he went out to the man in the plum-coloured coat and spoke to him in German. The man nodded and picked up the telephone receiver and dialled O. The workman went stolidly back to his ski-room.) As Bond strolled along the path that led to the cable station, he transferred the plastic strip from his sleeve to his trouser pocket, feeling pleased with himself. He had at least provided himself with one tool - the traditional burglar\u0027s tool for opening the Yale-type locks that secured the doors. Away from the club house, to which only a thin trickle of smart-looking people were making their way, he got into the usual mountain-top crowd - people swarming out of the cable-head, skiers wobbling or schussing down the easy nursery slopes on the plateau, little groups marshalled under individual teachers and guides from the valley. The terrace of the public restaurant was already crowded with the underprivileged who hadn\u0027t got the money or the connexions to join the club. He walked below it on the well-trampled snow and stood among the skiers at the top of the first plunging schuss of the Gloria run. A large notice-board, crowned with the G and the coronet, announced GLORIA ABFAHRT! Then below, ROT - FREIE FAHRT. GELB - FREIE FAHRT. SCHWARZ - GESPERRT, meaning that the red and yellow runs were open but the black dosed, presumably because of avalanche danger. Below this again was a painted metal map of the three runs. Bond had a good look at it, reflecting that it might be wise to commit to memory the red, which was presumably the easiest and most popular. There were red, yellow, and black marker flags on the map, and Bond could see the actual flags fluttering way down the mountain until the runs, studded with tiny moving figures, disappeared to the left, round the shoulder of the mountain and under the cable railway. The red seemed to continue to zigzag under the cable and between the few high pylons until it met the tree line. Then there was a short stretch of wood-running until the final easy schuss across the undulating lower meadows to the bottom cable-head, beyond which lay the main railway line and then the Pontresina-Samaden road. Bond tried to get it all fixed in his mind. Then he watched some of the starts. These varied between the arrow-like dive of the Kannonen, the stars, who took the terrific schuss dead straight in a low crouch with their sticks jauntily tucked under their arm-pits, the average amateur who braked perhaps three or four times on his way down, and the terrified novice who, with stuck-out behind, stemmed his way down, his skis angled and edged like a snow-plough, with occasional straight runs diagonally across the polished slope - dashing little sprints that usually ended in a mild crash as he ran off the flattened surface into the thick powder snow that edged the wide, beaten piste. The scene was the same as a thousand others Bond had witnessed when, as a teenager, he learned his skiing in the old Hannes Schneider School at St Anton in the Arlberg. He had got pretty good and had won his golden K, but the style in those days was rudimentary compared with what he was now witnessing from the occasional expert who zoomed down and away from beside him. Today the metal skis seemed to run faster and truer than the old steel-edged hickory. There was less shoulder-work and the art of Wedeln, a gentle waggling of the hips, was a revelation. Would it be as effective in deep new snow as it was on the well-beaten piste? Bond was doubtful, but he was envious of it. It was so much more graceful than the old Arlberg crouch. Bond wondered how he would fare on this terrific run. He would certainly not dare to take the first schuss straight. He would brake at least twice, perhaps there and there. And his legs would be trembling before he had been going for five minutes. His knees and ankles and wrists would be giving out. He must get on with his exercises! Bond, excited, left the scene and followed arrows that pointed to the GLORIA EXPRESS BOB-RUN. It lay on the other side of the cable station. There was a small wooden hut, the starter\u0027s hut, with telephone-wires connected to the station, and, beneath the cable station, a little \u0027garage\u0027 that housed the bob-sleighs and one-man skeleton-bobs. A chain, with a notice on it.saying ABFAHRTEN TДGLICH 0900-1100, was stretched across the wide mouth of the gulch of blue ice that curved away to the left and then disappeared over the shoulder. Here again was a metal map showing the zigzag course of the run down into the valley. In deference to the English traditions at the sport, outstanding curves and hazards were marked with names such as \u0027Dead Man\u0027s Leap\u0027, \u0027Whizz-Bang Straight\u0027, \u0027Battling S\u0027, \u0027Hell\u0027s Delight\u0027, \u0027The Boneshaker\u0027, and the finishing straight down \u0027Paradise Alley\u0027. Bond visualized the scene that morning, heard again that heart-rending scream. Yes, that death certainly had the old Blofeld touch! \u0027Sair Hilary! Sair Hilary!\u0027 Startled out of his thoughts, Bond turned. Fraulein Irma Bunt, her short arms akimbo, was standing on the path to the club. \u0027Lunch time! Lunch!\u0027 \u0027Coming,\u0027 Bond called back, and strolled up the slope towards her. He noted that, even in that hundred yards, his breathing was shallow and his limbs were heavy. This blasted height! He really must get into training! He came up with her. She looked surly. He said that he was sorry, he had not noticed the time. She said nothing. The yellow eyes surveyed him with active dislike before she turned her back and led the way along the path. Bond looked back over the morning. What had he done? Had he made a mistake? Well, he just might have. Better re-insure! As they came through the entrance into the reception lounge, Bond said casually, \u0027Oh, by the way, Fraulein Bunt, I was in the ski-room just now.\u0027 She halted. Bond noticed that the head of the receptionist bent a fraction lower over his visitors\u0027 book. \u0027Yes?\u0027 Bond took the length of plastic out of his pocket. \u0027I found just what I wanted.\u0027 He stitched a smile of innocent pleasure on his face. \u0027Like an idiot I forgot to bring a ruler with me. And there were these things on the work-bench. Just right. So I borrowed one. I hope that was all right. Of course I\u0027ll leave it behind when I go. But for these family trees, you know9 - Bond sketched a series of descending straight lines in the air - \u0027one has to get them on the right levels. I hope you don\u0027t mind.\u0027 He smiled charmingly. \u0027I was going to confess the nest time I saw you.\u0027 Irma Bunt veiled her eyes. \u0027 It is of no consequence. In future, anything you need you will perhaps ring for, isn\u0027t it? The Count wishes you to have every facility. Now\u0027 - she gestured - \u0027if you will perhaps go out on the terrace. You will be shown to our table. I will be with you in a moment.\u0027 Bond went through the restaurant door. Several of the interior tables were occupied by those who had had enough sun. He went across the room and out through the now open french windows. The man Fritz, who appeared to be the maitre d\u0027hotel, came towards him through the crowded tables. His eyes too were cold with hostility. He held up a menu. \u0027Please to follow me.\u0027 Bond followed him to the table up against the railing. Ruby and Violet were already there. Bond felt almost lighthearted with relief at having clean hands again. By God, he must pay attention, take care! This time he had got away with it. And he still had the strip of plastic! Had he sounded innocent enough, stupid enough? He sat down and ordered a double medium-dry vodka Martini, on the rocks, with lemon peel, and edged his feet up against Ruby\u0027s. She didn\u0027t withdraw hers. She smiled. Violet smiled. They all started talking at once. It was suddenly a beautiful day. Fraulein Bunt appeared and took her place. She was gracious again. \u0027I am so pleased to hear that you will be staying with us for a whole week, Sair Hilary. You enjoyed your interview with the Count? Is he not an interesting man?\u0027 \u0027Very interesting. Unfortunately our talk was too short and we discussed only my own subject. I was longing to ask him about his research work. I hope he didn\u0027t think me very rude.\u0027 Irma Bunt\u0027s face closed perceptibly. \u0027I am sure not. The Count does not often like to discuss his work. In these specialized scientific fields, you understand, there is much jealousy and, I am sorry to say, much intellectual thieving.\u0027 The box-like smile. \u0027I do not of course refer to yourself, my dear Sair Hilary, but to scientists less scrupulous than the Count, to spies from the chemical companies. That is why we keep ourselves very much to ourselves in our little Eagle\u0027s Nest up here. We have total privacy. Even the police in the valley are most co-operative in safeguarding us from intruders. They appreciate what the Count is doing.\u0027 \u0027The study of allergies?\u0027 \u0027Just so.\u0027 The maitre d\u0027hotel was standing by her side. His feet came together with a perceptible click. Menus were handed round and Bond\u0027s drink came. He took a long pull at it and ordered OBufs Gloria and a green salad. Chicken again for Ruby, cold cuts \u0027with stacks of potatoes\u0027 for Violet. Irma Bunt ordered her usual cottage cheese and salad. \u0027Don\u0027t you girls eat anything but chicken and potatoes? Is this something to do with your allergies?\u0027 Ruby began, \u0027Well, yes, in a way. Somehow I\u0027ve come to simply love…\u0027 Irma Bunt broke in sharply. \u0027Now then, Ruby. No discussion of treatments, you remember? Not even with our good friend Sair Hilary.\u0027 She waved a hand towards the crowded tables around them. \u0027A most interesting crowd, do you not find, Sair Hilary? Everybody who is anybody. We have quite taken the international set away from Gstaad and St Moritz. That is your Duke of Marlborough over there with such a gay party of young things. And near by that is Mr Whitney and Lady Daphne Straight. Is she not chic? They are both wonderful skiers. And that beautiful girl with the long fair hair at the big table, that is Ursula Andress, the film star. What a wonderful tan she has! And Sir George Dunbar, he always has the most enchanting companions.\u0027 The box-like smile. \u0027Why, we only need the Aga Khan and perhaps your Duke of Kent and we would have everybody, but everybody. Is it not sensational for the first season?\u0027 Bond said it was. The lunch came. Bond\u0027s eggs were delicious - chopped hard-boiled eggs, with a cream and cheese sauce laced with English mustard (English mustard seemed to be the clue to the Gloria specialities), gratings in a copper dish. Bond commented on the excellence of the cooking. \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Irma Bunt. \u0027We have three expert Frenchmen in the kitchen. Men are very good at cooking, is it not?\u0027 Bond felt rather than saw a man approaching their table. He came up to Bond. He was a military-looking man, of about Bond\u0027s age, and he had a puzzled expression on his face. He bowed slightly to the ladies, and said to Bond, \u0027Excuse me, but I saw your name in the visitors\u0027 book. It is Hilary Bray, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Bond\u0027s heart sank. This situation had always been a possibility and he had prepared a fumbling counter to it. But this was the worst possible moment with that damned woman watching and listening! Bond said, \u0027Yes, it is,\u0027 with heartiness. \u0027Sir Hilary Bray?\u0027 The pleasant face was even more puzzled. Bond got to his feet and stood with his back to his table, to Irma Bunt. \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027 He took out his handkerchief and blew his nose to obscure the next question, which might be fatal. \u0027In the Lovat Scouts during the war?\u0027 \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Bond. He looked worried, lowered his voice appropriately. \u0027You\u0027re thinking of my first cousin. From Ben Trilleachan. Died six months ago, poor chap. I inherited the title.\u0027 \u0027Oh, lord!\u0027 The man\u0027s puzzlement cleared. Grief took its place. \u0027Sorry to hear that. Great pal of mine in the war. Funny! I didn\u0027t see anything about it in The Times. Always read the \"Births, Marriages, and Deaths\". What was it?\u0027 Bond felt the sweat running down under his arms; \u0027Fell off one of those bloody mountains of his. Broke his neck.\u0027 \u0027My God! Poor chap! But he was always fooling around the tops by himself. I must write to Jenny at once.\u0027 He held out his hand. \u0027Well, sorry to have butted in. Thought this was a funny place to find old Hilary. Well, so long, and sorry again.\u0027 He moved off between the tables. Out of the corner of his eye, Bond saw him rejoin a very English-looking table of men and, obviously, wives, to whom he began talking animatedly. Bond sat down, reached for his drink and drained it and went back to his eggs. The woman\u0027s eyes were on him. He felt the sweat running down his face. He took out his handkerchief and mopped at it.\u0027 Gosh, it\u0027s hot out here in the sun! That was some pal of my first cousin\u0027s. My cousin had the same name. Collateral branch. Died not long ago, poor chap.\u0027 He frowned sadly. \u0027Didn\u0027t know this man from Adam. Nice-looking fellow.\u0027 Bond looked bravely across the table. \u0027Do you know any of his party, Fraulein Bunt?\u0027 Without looking at the party, Fraulein Bunt said shortly, \u0027No, I do not know everyone who comes here.\u0027 The yellow eyes were still inquisitive, holding his. \u0027But it was a curious coincidence. Were you very alike, you and your cousin?\u0027 \u0027Oh, absolutely,\u0027 said Bond, gushing. \u0027Spit image. Often used to get taken for each other.\u0027 He looked across at the English group. Thank God they were picking up their things and going. They didn\u0027t look particularly smart or prosperous. Probably staying at Pontresina or under the ex-officers\u0027 scheme at St Moritz. Typical English skiing party. With any luck they were just doing the big runs in the neighbour-\u0027 hood one by one. Bond reviewed the way the conversation had gone while coffee came and he made cheerful small talk with Ruby, whose foot was again clamped against his, about her skiing progress that morning. Well, he decided, the woman couldn\u0027t have heard much of it with all the clatter and chatter from the surrounding tables. But it had been a narrow squeak, a damned narrow squeak. The second of the day! So much for walking on tiptoe inside the enemy lines! Not good enough! Definitely not good enough!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46869.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007之女王密使 On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"简介： 贝洛福在瑞士山区建立一个疗养院，但实际上却阴谋进行一项控制全球的野心计划，就是将病毒注射到女患者身上，然后分派到世界各地，企图掌握世界主权。007奉命调查此案，乔装家谱学家蒙混而入，及时炸毁实验室，挽救了世界。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
