{"id":30893,"no":25,"title":"25 Hell\u0027s Delight, etc.","content":"YES! THERE was the bloody place! Now only the peak was golden. The plateau and the buildings were in indigo shadow, soon to be lit by the full moon. \\n\\n Bond pointed. The helicopter wasn\u0027t liking the altitude. At 10,000 feet its rotors were finding it hard to get a grip of the thin air and the pilot was struggling to keep it at maximum revs. As he turned to port, in towards the face of the mountain, his radio crackled sharply and a harsh voice said, in German and then in French, \u0027Landing forbidden. This is private property. I repeat, landing forbidden!\u0027 The pilot reached up to the cockpit roof and switched off the radio. He had studied his landing-point on the plateau on the mock-up. He got to it, hovered, and gently came down. The helicopter bounced once on its rubber floats and settled. Already there was a group of men waiting for them. Eight men. Bond recognized some of them. They all had their hands in their pockets or in their wind-jackets. The engine coughed to a stop and the rotors swung round briefly in neutral and halted. Bond heard the bang of the door being opened behind him and the rattle of the men piling down the ladder. The two groups lined up facing each other. Marc-Ange said, with authority, \u0027This is the Federal Police Alpine Patrol. There was trouble up here on Christmas Eve. We have come to investigate.\u0027 \\n\\n Fritz, the \u0027head waiter\u0027, said angrily. \u0027The local police have already been here. They have made their report. All is in order. Please leave at once. What is the Federal Police Alpine Patrol? I have never heard of it.\u0027 \\n\\n The pilot nudged Bond and pointed over to the left, to the building that housed the Count and the laboratories. A man, clumsy in bob-sleigh helmet and padding, was running down the path towards the cable station. He would be out of sight of the men on the ground. Bond said \u0027Blast!\u0027 and scrambled out of his seat and into the cabin. He leaned out of the door and shouted, \u0027The Big One. He\u0027s getting away!\u0027 \\n\\n As Bond jumped, one of the SPECTRE men shouted, \u0027Der Englander. Der Spion!\u0027 And then, as Bond started running away to the right, weaving and dodging, all hell broke loose. There came the boom of heavy automatics as the SPECTRE team got off their first rounds, and bullets, tracer, Sashed past Bond with the noise of humming-birds\u0027 wings. Then came the answering roar of the Schmeissers and Bond was left alone. \\n\\n Now he was round the corner of the club, and, a hundred yards down the slope, the man in the crash helmet had torn open the door of the \u0027garage\u0027 for the bob-sleighs in the foundations of the cable station. He emerged carrying a one-man skeleton bob. Holding it in front of him as a shield, he fired a burst from a heavy automatic at Bond and again the humming-birds whirred past. Bond knelt and, steadying his gun with two hands, fired three rounds with his Walther, but the man was now running the few yards to the glistening ice-mouth of the Gloria Express bob-run. Bond got a glimpse of the profile under the moon. Yes, it was Blofeld all right! Even as Bond ran on down the slope, the man had flung himself down on his skeleton and had disappeared as if swallowed up by the glistening landscape. Bond got to the \u0027garage\u0027. Damn, they were all six-men or two-men models! No, there was one skeleton at the back! Bond hauled it out. No time to see if the runners were straight, the steering-arm shifting easily! He ran to the start and hurled himself under the protecting chain in a mad forward dive that landed him half on and half off his skeleton. He straightened himself and shifted his body well forward on the flimsy little aluminium platform and gripped the steering-arm, keeping his elbows well in to his sides. He was already going like hell down the dark-blue gutter! He tried braking with the toes of both his boots. Damned little difference! What came first on the blasted run? There was this lateral straight across the shoulder of the mountain, then a big banked curve. He was into it now! Bond kept his right shoulder down and inched right on the steering-arm. Even so, he went perilously near the top edge of the bank before he dived down into the dark gully again. What came next on that metal map? Why in hell hadn\u0027t he studied it more carefully? He got his answer! It looked tike a straight, but the shadows camouflaged a sharp dip. Bond left the ground and flew. The crash of his landing almost knocked the wind out of his body. He frantically dug his toes into the ice, managed to get down from perhaps fifty m.p.h. to forty. Well, well! So that was \u0027Dead Man\u0027s Leap.\u0027 What in hell was the next bit of murder? \u0027Whizz-Bang Straight\u0027! And by God it was! - 200 yards when he must have been doing around seventy. He remembered that on the finishing straight of the Cresta the stars got up to over eighty. No doubt something like that was still to come! But now, flashing towards him, in silver and black, came an S-bend - \u0027Battling S\u0027. The toes of Bond\u0027s boots slid maddeningly on the black ice. Under his nose he could see the parallel tracks of Blofeld\u0027s runners and, between them, the grooves of his toe-spikes. The old fox! As soon as he heard the helicopter, he must have got himself fixed for his only escape route. But at this speed Bond must surely be catching up with him! For God\u0027s sake look out! Here comes the S! There was nothing he could do about it. He swayed his body as best he could, felt the searing crash of one elbow against one wall, was hurled across into the opposite one, and was then spewed out into the straight again. God Almighty, but it hurt! He could feel the cold wind on both elbows. The cloth had gone! Then so had the skin! Bond clenched his teeth. And he was only half-way down, if that! But then, ahead, flashing through a patch of moonlight, was the other body, Blofeld! Bond took a chance, heaved himself up on one hand and reached down for his gun. The wind tried to tear him off the bob, but he had the gun. He opened his mouth wide and gripped the gun between his teeth, flexed the ice-caked leather on his right hand. Then he got the gun in his right hand, lifted his toes off the ice, and went like hell. But now the man had disappeared into the shadows and a giant bank reared up ahead. This would be \u0027Hell\u0027s Delight\u0027! Oh well, if he could make this, there would be another straight and he could begin shooting. Bond dug his toes in, got a glimpse of an ice-wall ahead and to the left, and in a flash was climbing it, straight up! God, in a split second he would be over the edge! Bond hammered in his right boot and lurched his body to the right, tearing at the steering-arm. Reluctantly the sliver of aluminium answered and Bond, inches from the top of the wall, found himself swooping down into blackness and then out again on to a moonlit straight. Only fifty yards ahead was the flying figure, with chips of ice fountaining up from the braking spikes on his boots. Bond held his breath and got off two shots. He thought they were good ones, but now the mad had gone into shadow again. But Bond was gaining, gaining. His lips drew back from his teeth in an almost animal snarl. You bastard! You\u0027re a dead duck! You can\u0027t stop or fire back. I\u0027m coming after you like lightning 1 Soon I shall only be ten, five yards behind you. Then you\u0027ll have had it! \\n\\n But the shadows concealed another hazard, long transverse waves in the ice - \u0027The Bone-shaker\u0027! Bond crashed from one to the next, felt his boots being almost torn from his feet as he tried to brake, nearly lost his gun, felt his stomach flatten against his spine with each shattering impact, felt his rib cage almost cracking. But then it was over and Bond sucked in air through his clenched teeth. Now for a length of straight! But what was that ahead on the track? It was something black, something the size of a big lemon that was bouncing along gaily like a child\u0027s rubber ball. Had Blofeld, now only about thirty yards ahead, dropped something, a bit of his equipment? Had he? The realization came to Bond in a surge of terror that almost made him vomit. He ground his toes into the ice. No effect! He was gaming on the gaily bouncing thing. Flashing down on it. On the grenade! \\n\\n Bond, sick in the stomach, lifted his toes and let himself go. What setting had Blofeld put on it? How long had he held it with the pin out? The only hope was to pray to God and race it! \\n\\n The next thing Bond knew was that the whole track had blown up in his face and that he and his skeleton bob were flying through the air. He landed in soft snow, with the skeleton on top of him and passed out like a light. \\n\\n Later, Bond was to estimate that he lay there only a matter of minutes. It was a tremendous explosion from the mountain above him that brought him staggering to his feet, up to his belly in snow. He looked vaguely up to where it had come from. It must have been the club building going up, because now there was the glare of flames and a tower of smoke that rose towards the moon. There came the echoing crack of another explosion and Blofeld\u0027s block disintegrated, great chunks of it crashing down the mountain side, turning themselves into giant snowballs that bounded off down towards the tree-line. By God, they\u0027ll start another avalanche! thought Bond vaguely. Then he realized that it didn\u0027t matter this time, he was away to the right, almost underneath the cable railway. And now the station went up and Bond stared fascinated as the great wires, their tension released, came hissing and snaking down the mountain towards him. There was nothing he could do about it but stand and watch. If they cut him down, they cut him down. But they lashed past in the snow, wrapped themselves briefly round the tall pylon above the tree-line, tore it away in a metallic crackling, and disappeared over the edge of the shoulder. \\n\\n Bond laughed weakly with pleasure and began feeling himself for damage. His torn elbows he already knew about, but his forehead hurt like hell. He felt it gingerly, then scooped up a handful of snow and held it against the wound. The blood showed black in the moonlight. He ached all over, but there didn\u0027t seem to be anything broken. He bent dazedly to the twisted remains of the skeleton. The steering-arm had gone, had probably saved his head, and both runners were bent. There were a lot of rattles from the rivets, but perhaps the damned thing would run. It had bloody well got to! There was no other way for Bond to get down the mountain! His gun? Gone to hell, of course. Wearily Bond heaved himself over the wall of the track and slid carefully down, clutching the remains of his skeleton. As soon as he got to the bottom of the gutter, everything began to slip downwards, but he managed to haul himself on to the bob and get shakily going. In fact, the bent runners were a blessing and the bob scraped slowly down, leaving great furrows in the ice. There were more turns, more hazards, but, at a bare ten miles an hour, they were child\u0027s play and soon Bond was through the tree-line and into \u0027Paradise Alley\u0027, the finishing straight, where he slowly came to a halt. He left the skeleton where it stopped and scrambled over the low ice-wall. Here the snow was beaten hard by spectators\u0027 feet and he stumbled slowly along, nursing his aches, and occasionally dabbing at his head with handfuls of snow. What would he find at the bottom, by the cable station? If it was Blofeld, Bond would be a dead duck! But there were no lights on in the station into which the cables now trailed limply along the ground. By God, that had been an expensive bang! But what of Marc-Ange and his merry men, and the helicopter? \\n\\n As if to answer him, he heard the clatter of its engine high up in the mountains and in a moment the ungainly black shape crossed the moon and disappeared down the valley. Bond smiled to himself. They were going to have a tough time arguing themselves across Swiss air space this time! But Marc-Ange had thought out an alternative route over Germany. That would also not be fun. They would have to argue the toss with NATO? Well, if a Marseillais couldn\u0027t blarney his way across two hundred miles, nobody could! \\n\\n And now, up the road from Samaden that Bond knew so well, came the iron hee-haw warning of the local fire-engine. The blinking red light on its cabin roof was perhaps a mile away. Bond, carefully approaching the corner of the darkened cable station, prepared his story. He crept up to the wall of the building and looked round. Nobody! No trace except fresh tyre-marks outside the entrance door. Blofeld must have telephoned his man down here before he started and used him and his car for the getaway. Which way had he gone? Bond walked out on to the road. The tracks turned left. Blofeld would be at the Bernina Pass or over it by now, on his way down into Italy and away. It might still have been possible to have him held at the frontier by alerting the fire-brigade, whose lights now held Bond in their beam. No! That would be idiotic. How had Bond got this knowledge unless he himself had been up at Piz Gloria that night? No, he must just play the part of the stupidest tourist in the Engadine! \\n\\n The shining red vehicle pulled up in front of the cable station and the warning klaxons ran down with an iron groan. Men jumped to the ground. Some went into the station while others stood gazing up at the Piz Gloria, where a dull red glow still showed. A man in a peaked cap, presumably the captain of the team, came up to Bond and saluted. He fired off a torrent of Schwyzerdьtch. Bond shook his head. The man tried French. Bond again showed incomprehension. Another man with fragmentary English was called over. \u0027What is it that is happening?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n Bond shook his head dazedly. \u0027I don\u0027t know. I was walking down from Pontresina to Samaden. I came on a day excursion from Zurich and missed my bus. I was going to take a train from Samaden. Then I saw these explosions up the mountain\u0027 - he waved vaguely - \u0027and I walked up there past the station to see better, and the next thing I knew was a bang on the head and being dragged along the path.1 He indicated his bleeding head and the raw elbows that protruded from his torn sleeves. \u0027It must have been the broken cable. It must have hit me and dragged me with it. Have you got a Red Cross outfit with you?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes.\u0027 The man called over to the group, and one of his colleagues wearing a Red Cross brassard on his arm fetched his black box from the vehicle and came over. He clucked his tongue over Bond\u0027s injuries and, while his interrogator told Bond\u0027s story to the Captain, bade Bond follow him into the toflette in the station. There, by the light of a torch, he washed Bond\u0027s wounds, applied quantities of iodine that stung like hell, and then strapped wide strips of Elastoplast over the damage. Bond looked at his face in the mirror. He laughed. Hell of a bridegroom he was going to make! The Red Cross man cluck-clucked in sympathy, produced a flask of. brandy out of his box, and offered it to Bond. Bond gratefully took a long swig. The interpreter came in. \u0027There is nothing we can do here. It will need a helicopter from the mountain rescue team. We must go back to Samaden and report. You wish to come?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I certainly do,\u0027 said Bond enthusiastically, and, with many politenesses and no question of why he should attempt the icy walk to Samaden in the dark instead of taking a taxi, he was borne comfortably to Samaden and dropped off, with the warmest gestures of goodwill and sympathy, at the railway station. \\n\\n * * * \\n\\n By a raiding Personenzug to Coke and then by express to Zurich, Bond got to the door of the flat of Head of Station Z in the Bahnhofstrasse at two in the morning. He had had some sleep in the train but he was almost out on his feet, and his whole body felt as if it had been beaten with wooden truncheons. He leaned wearily against the bell ticketed \u0027Muir\u0027 until a tousled man in pyjamas came and opened the door and held it on the chain. \u0027Um Gottes Willen! Was ist denn los?\u0027 he inquired angrily. The English accent came through. Bond said, \u0027It\u0027s me that\u0027s \"los\". It\u0027s 007 again, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Good God, man, come in, come in!\u0027 Muir opened the door and looked quickly up and down the empty street. \u0027Anyone after you?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Bond thickly, coming gratefully into the warmth of the entrance hall. Head of Z closed the door and locked it. He turned and looked at Bond. \u0027Christ, old boy, what in hell\u0027s been happening to you? You look as if you\u0027d been through a mangle. Here, come in and have a drink.\u0027 He led the way into a comfortable sitting-room. He gestured at the sideboard. \u0027Help yourself. I\u0027ll just tell Phyllis not to worry - unless you\u0027d like her to have a look at the damage. She\u0027s quite a hand at that sort of thing.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No, it\u0027s all right, thanks. A drink\u0027ll fix me. Nice and warm in here. I never want to see a patch of snow again as long as I live.\u0027 \\n\\n Muir went out and Bond heard a quick confabulation across the passage. Muir came back. \u0027Phyllis is fixing the spare room. She\u0027ll put some fresh dressings and stuff out in the bathroom. Now then\u0027 - he poured himself a thin whisky and soda to keep Bond company and sat down opposite him -\u0027tell me what you can.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said, \u0027I\u0027m terribly sorry, but I can\u0027t tell you much. The same business as the other day. Next chapter. I promise you\u0027d do better to know nothing about it. I wouldn\u0027t have come here only I\u0027ve got to get a signal off to M, personal, triple X cipher to be deciphered by recipient only. Would you be a good chap and put it on the printer?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027 Muir looked at his watch. \u0027Two-thirty am. Hell of a time to wake the old man up. But that\u0027s your business. Here, come into the cockpit, so to speak.\u0027 He walked across to the book-lined wall, took out a book and fiddled. There was a click and a small door swung open. \u0027Mind your head,\u0027 said Muir. \u0027Old disused lavatory. Just the right size. Gets a bit stuffy when there\u0027s a lot of traffic coming or going, but that can\u0027t be helped. We can afford to leave the door open.\u0027 He bent down to a safe on the floor, worked the combination, and brought out what looked like a portable typewriter. He set it on the shelf next to the bulky teleprinter, sat down, and clacked off the prefix and routing instructions, winding a small handle at the side of the machine at the end of each word. \u0027OK. Fire away!\u0027 \\n\\n Bond leaned up against the wall. He had toyed with various formulas on his journey down to Samaden. It had to be something that would get through accurately to M and yet keep Muir in the dark, keep his hands clean. Bond said, \u0027All right. Make it this, would you? REDOUBT PROPERLY \\n\\n FIXED STOP DETAILS LACKING AS EYE WENT SOLO AFTER THE OWNER WHO GREATLY REGRET GOT AWAY AND PROBABLY ITALICIZED BY NOW STOP FORWARDING FULL REPORT FROM STATION M THEN GRATEFULLY ACCEPTING TEN DAYS LEAVE SIGNED 007.\u0027 \\n\\n Muir repeated the signal and then began putting it, in the five-figure groups that had come off the Triple X machine, on to the teleprinter. \\n\\n Bond watched the message go, the end of another chapter of his duties, as Marc-Ange had put it, \u0027On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service\u0027. What would Her Majesty think of this string of crimes committed in her name? God, it was stuffy in the little room! Bond felt the cold sweat break out on his forehead. He put his hand up to his face, muttered something indistinctly about \u0027that bloody mountain\u0027 and gracefully crumpled to the floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46882.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007之女王密使 On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"简介： 贝洛福在瑞士山区建立一个疗养院，但实际上却阴谋进行一项控制全球的野心计划，就是将病毒注射到女患者身上，然后分派到世界各地，企图掌握世界主权。007奉命调查此案，乔装家谱学家蒙混而入，及时炸毁实验室，挽救了世界。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
