{"id":30891,"no":23,"title":"23 Gauloises and Garlic","content":"WITH THE Walther PPK in its leather holster warm against his stomach and his own name in his passport, James Bond looked out of the window at the English Channel sliding away beneath the belly of the Caravelle and felt more like his old, his pre-Sir Hilary Bray, self. \n He glanced at the new Rolex on his wrist - the shops were still shut and he had had to blarney it out of Q Branch -and guessed they would be on time, 6 pm at Marseilles. It had been the hell of a rush to get off. He had worked until late in the night at HQ and all that morning, setting up the Identicast of Blofeld, checking details with Ronnie Vallance, fixing up the private, the Munich side of his life, chattering on the teleprinter to Station Z, even remembering to tell Mary Goodnight to get on to Sable Basilisk after the holiday and ask him to please do some kind of a job on the surnames of the ten girls and please to have the family tree of Ruby Windsor embellished with gold capitals. \n At midnight he had called Tracy in Munich and heard her darling, excited voice. \u0027I\u0027ve got the toothbrush, James,\u0027 she had said, \u0027and a pile of books. Tomorrow I\u0027m going to go up the Zugspitze and sit in the sun so as to look pretty for you. Guess what I had for dinner tonight in my room! Rrebs-schwanze mit Dilltunke. That\u0027s crayfish tails with rice and a cream and dill sauce. And Rehr—åcken mit Sahne. That\u0027s saddle of roebuck with a smitane sauce. I bet it was better than what you had.\u0027 \n \u0027I had two ham sandwiches with stacks of mustard and half a pint of Harper\u0027s Bourbon on the rocks. The bourbon was better than the ham. Now listen, Tracy, and stop blowing down the telephone.\u0027 \n \u0027I was only sighing with love.\u0027 \n \u0027Well, you must have got a Force Five sigh. Now listen. \n I\u0027m posting my birth certificate to you tomorrow with a covering letter to the British Consul saying I want to get married to you as soon as possible. Look, you\u0027re going up to Force Ten! For God\u0027s sake pay attention. It\u0027ll take a few days, I\u0027m afraid. They have to post the banns or something. He\u0027ll tell you all about it. Now, you must quickly get your birth certificate and give it to him, too. Oh, you have, have you?\u0027 Bond laughed.\u0027 So much the better. Then we\u0027re all set. I\u0027ve got three days or so of work to do and I\u0027m going down to see your father tomorrow and ask for your hand, both of them, and the feet and all the rest, in marriage. No, you\u0027re to stay where you are. This is men\u0027s talk. Will he be awake? I\u0027m going to ring him up now. Good. Well, now you go off to sleep or you\u0027ll be too tired to say \" Yes \" when the time comes.\u0027 \n They had not wanted to let go of each other\u0027s voices, but finally the last good-night, the last kiss, had been exchanged, and Bond called the Marseilles number of Appareils FJec-triques Draco, and Marc-Ange\u0027s voice, almost as excited as Tracy\u0027s, was on the line. Bond dampened down the raptures about the \u0027fiancailles\u0027 and said, \u0027Now listen, Marc-Ange. I want you to give me a wedding present.\u0027 \n \u0027Anything, my dear James. Anything I possess.\u0027 He laughed. \u0027And perhaps certain things of which I could take possession. What is it you would like?\u0027 \n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you tomorrow evening. I\u0027m booked on the afternoon Air France to Marseilles. Will you have someone meet me? And it\u0027s business, I\u0027m afraid. So could you have your other directors present for a little meeting? We shall need all our brains. It is about our sales organization in Switzerland. Something drastic needs to be done about it.\u0027 \n \u0027Aha!\u0027 There was full understanding in the voice. \u0027Yes, it is indeed a bad spot on our sales map. I will certainly have my colleagues available. And I assure you, my dear James, that anything that can be done will be done. And of course you will be met. I shall perhaps not be there in person - it is very cold out these winter evenings. But I shall see that you are properly looked after. Goodnight, my dear fellow. Goodnight.\u0027 \n The line bad gone dead. The old fox! Had he thought Bond might commit an indiscretion, or had he got fitted to his telephone a \u0027bug-meter\u0027, the delicate instrument that measures the resonance on the line and warns of listening-in? \n The winter sun spread a last orange glow over the thick overcast 10,000 feet below the softly whistling plane and switched itself off for the night. \n Bond dozed, reflecting that he must somehow, and pretty soon, find a way of catching up on his sleep. \n * * * \n There was a stage-type Marseilles taxi-driver to meet Bond - the archetype of all Mariuses, with the face of a pirate and the razor-sharp badinage of the lower French music-halls. He was apparently known and enjoyed by everyone at the airport, and Bond was whisked through the formalities in a barrage of wisecracks about \u0027le milord anglais9, which made Marius, for his name turned out in fact to be Marius, the centre of attraction and Bond merely his butt, the dim-witted English tourist. But, once in the taxi, Marius made curt, friendly apologies over his shoulder. \u0027I ask your pardon for my bad manners.\u0027 His French had suddenly purified itself of all patois. It also smelt like acetylene gas.\u0027 I was told to extract you from the airport with the least possible limelight directed upon you. I know all those \"flics\" and douaniers. They all know me. If I had not been myself, the cab-driver they know as Marius, if I had shown deference, eyes, inquisitive eyes, would have been upon you, mon Commandant. I did what I thought best You forgive me?\u0027 \n \u0027Of course I do, Marius. But you shouldn\u0027t have been so funny. You nearly made me laugh. That would have been fatal.\u0027 \n \u0027You understand our talk here?\u0027 \n \u0027Enough of it.\u0027 \n \u0027So!\u0027 There was a pause. Then Marius said, \u0027Alas, since Waterloo, one can never underestimate the English.\u0027 \n Bond said, seriously, \u0027The same date applied to the French. It was a near thing.\u0027 This was getting too gallant. Bond said, \n \u0027Now tell me, is the bouillabaisse chez Guido always as good?\u0027 \n \u0027It is passable,\u0027 said Marius. \u0027But this is a dish that is dead, gone. There is no more true bouillabaisse, because there is no more fish in the Mediterranean. For the bouillabaisse, you must have the rascasse, the tender flesh of the scorpion fish. Today they just use hunks of morue. The saffron and the garlic, they are always the same. But you could eat pieces of a woman soaked in those and it would be good. Go to any of the little places down by the harbour. Eat the plat du jour and drink the vin du Cassis that they give you. It will fill your stomach as well as it fills the fishermen\u0027s. The toilette will be filthy. What does that matter? You are a man. You can walk up the Canebiere and do it at the Noailles for nothing after lunch.\u0027 \n They were now weaving expertly through the traffic down the famous Canebiere and Marius needed all his breath to insult the other drivers. Bond could smell the sea. The accordions were playing in the cafes. He remembered old times in this most criminal and tough of all French towns. He reflected that it was rather fun, this time, being on the side of the devil. \n At the bottom of the Canebiere, where it crosses the Rue de Rome, Marius turned right and then left into the Rue St Ferreol, only a long stone\u0027s throw from the Qua! des Beiges and the Vieux Port. The lights from the harbour\u0027s entrance briefly winked at them and then the taxi drew up at a hideous, but very new apartment house with a broad vitrine on the ground floor, which announced in furious neon \u0027Appareils Electriques Draco\u0027. The well-lit interior of the store contained what you would expect - television sets, radios, gramophones, electric irons, fans, and so forth. Marius very quickly carried Bond\u0027s suitcase across the pavement and through the swing doors beside the vitrine. The close-carpeted hallway was more luxurious than Bond had expected. A man came out of the porter\u0027s lodge beside the lift and wordlessly took the suitcase. Marius turned to Bond, gave him a smile and a wink and a bone-crushing hand shake, said curtly, \u0027A la prochaine,\u0027 and hurried out. The porter stood beside the open door of the lift. Bond noticed the bulge under his right arm and, out of curiosity, brushed against the man as he entered the lift. Yes, and something big too, a real stopper. The man gave Bond a bored look, as much as to say, \u0027Clever? Eh?\u0027 and pressed the top button. The porter\u0027s twin, or very nearly his twin - dark, chunky, brown-eyed, fit - was waiting at the top floor. He took Bond\u0027s suitcase and led the way down a corridor, close-carpeted and with wall brackets in good taste. He opened a door. It was an extremely comfortable bedroom with a bathroom leading off. Bond imagined that the big picture window, now curtained, would have a superb view of the harbour. The man put down his suitcase and said, \u0027Monsieur Draco est immddiatement a votre disposition.\u0027 \n Bond thought it time to make some show of independence. He said firmly, \u0027Un moment, je vous en prie,\u0027 and went into the bathroom and cleaned himself up - amused to notice that the soap was that most English of soaps, Pears Transparent, and that there was a bottle of Mr Trumper\u0027s \u0027Eucris\u0027 beside the very masculine brush and comb by Kent. Marc-Ange was indeed making his English guest feel at home! \n Bond took his time, then went out and followed the man to the end door. The man opened it without knocking and closed it behind Bond. Marc-Ange, his creased walnut face split by his great golden-toothed smile, got up from his desk (Bond was getting tired of desks!), trotted across the broad room, threw his arms round Bond\u0027s neck and kissed him squarely on both cheeks. Bond suppressed his recoil and gave a reassuring pat to Marc-Ange\u0027s broad back. Marc-Ange stood away and laughed. \u0027All right! I swear never to do it again. It is once and for ever. Yes? But it had to come out - from the Latin temperament, isn\u0027t it? You forgive me? Good. Then come and take a drink\u0027 - he waved at a loaded sideboard - \u0027and sit down and tell me what I can do for you. I swear not to talk about Teresa until you have finished with your business. But tell me\u0027 - the brown eyes pleaded - \u0027it is all right between you? You have not changed your mind?\u0027 \n Bond smiled. \u0027Of course not, Marc-Ange. And everything is arranged. We will be married within the week. At the Consulate in Munich. I have two weeks\u0027 leave. I thought we might spend the honeymoon in Kitzb—åhel. I love that place. So does she. You will come to the wedding?\u0027 \n \u0027Come to the wedding!\u0027 Marc-Ange exploded. \u0027You will have a time keeping me away from Kitzbuhel. Now then\u0027 -he waved at the sideboard -\u0027take your drink while I compose myself. I must stop being happy and be clever instead. My two best men, my organizers if you like, are waiting. I wanted to have you for a moment to myself.\u0027 \n Bond poured himself a stiff Jack Daniel\u0027s sourmash bourbon on the rocks and added some water. He walked over to the desk and took the right-hand of the three chairs that had been arranged in a semicircle facing the \u0027Capu\u0027. \u0027I wanted that too, Marc-Ange. Because there are some things I must tell you which affect my country. I have been granted leave to tell them to you, but they must remain, as you put it, behind the Herkos Odonton - behind the hedge of your teeth. Is that all right?\u0027 \n Marc-Ange lifted his right hand and crossed his heart, slowly, deliberately, with his forefinger. His face was now deadly serious, almost cruelly implacable. He leaned forward and rested his forearms on the desk. \u0027Continue.\u0027 \n Bond told him the whole story, not even omitting his passage with Ruby. He had developed much love, and total respect, for this man. He couldn\u0027t say why. It was partly animal magnetism and partly that Marc-Ange had so opened his heart to Bond, so completely trusted him with his own innermost secrets. \n Marc-Ange\u0027s face remained impassive throughout. Only his quick, animal eyes nickered continually across Bond\u0027s face. When Bond had finished, Marc-Ange sat back. He reached for a blue packet of Gauloises, fixed one in the corner of his mouth and talked through the blue clouds of smoke that puffed continuously out through his lips, as if somewhere inside him there was a small steam-engine. \u0027Yes, it is indeed a dirty business. It must be finished with, destroyed, and the man too. My dear James\u0027 - the voice was sombre - \u0027I am a criminal, a great criminal. I run houses, chains of prostitutes, I smuggle, I sell protection, whenever I can, I steal from the very rich. I break many laws and I have often had to kill in the process. Perhaps one day, perhaps very soon, I shall reform. But it is difficult to step down from being Capu of the union. Without the protection of my men, my life would not be worth much. However, we shall see. But this Blofeld, he is too bad, too disgusting. You have come to ask the union to make war on him, to destroy him. You need not answer. I know it is so. This is something that cannot be done officially. Your Chief is correct. You would get nowhere with the Swiss. You wish me and my men to do the job.\u0027 He smiled suddenly. \u0027That is the wedding present you talked of. Yes?\u0027 \n \u0027That\u0027s right, Marc-Ange. But I\u0027ll do my bit. I\u0027ll be there too. I want this man for myself.\u0027 \n Marc-Ange looked at him thoughtfully. \u0027That I do not like. And you know why I do not like it.\u0027 He said mildly, \u0027You are a bloody fool, James. You are already lucky to be alive.\u0027 He shrugged. \u0027But I am wasting my breath. You started on a long road after this man. And you want to come to the end of it. Is that right?\u0027 \n \u0027That\u0027s right. I don\u0027t want someone else to shoot my fox.\u0027 \n \u0027OK, OK. We bring in the others, yes? They will not need to know the reason why. My orders are my orders. But we all need to know how we are to bring this about. I have some ideas. I think it can be done and swiftly done. But it must also be well done, cleanly done. There must be no untidiness about this thing.\u0027 \n Marc-Ange picked up his telephone and spoke into it. A minute later the door opened and two men came in and, with hardly a glance at Bond, took the other two chairs. \n Marc-Ange nodded at the one next to Bond, a great ox of a man with the splayed ears and broken nose of a boxer or wrestler. \u0027This is Che-Che - Che-Che le Persuadeur. And\u0027 - Marc-Ange smiled grimly - \u0027he is very adept at persuading.\u0027 \n Bond got a glimpse of two hard yellow-brown eyes that looked at him quickly, reluctantly, and then went back to the Capu. \u0027Plaisir.\u0027 \n \u0027And this is Toussaint, otherwise known as \"Le Pouff\". He is our expert with le plastique. We shall need plenty of plastique.\u0027 \n \u0027We shall indeed,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027with pretty quick time-pencils.\u0027 \n Toussaint leaned forward to show himself. He was thin and grey-skinned, with an almost fine Phoenician profile pitted with smallpox. Bond guessed that he was on heroin, but not as a mainliner. He gave Bond a brief, conspiratorial smile. \u0027Plaisir.\u0027 He sat back. \n \u0027And this\u0027 - Marc-Ange gestured at Bond - \u0027is my friend. My absolute friend. He is simply \"Le Commandant\". And now to business.\u0027 He had been speaking in French, but he now broke into rapid Corsican which, apart from a few Italian and French roots, was incomprehensible to Bond. At one period he drew a large-scale map of Switzerland out of a drawer of his desk, spread it out, searched with his finger, and pointed to a spot in the centre of the Engadine. The two men craned forward, examined the map carefully and then sat back. Che-Che said something which contained the word Strasbourg and Marc-Ange nodded enthusiastically. He turned to Bond and handed him a large sheet of paper and a pencil. \u0027Be a good chap and get to work on this, would you? A map of the Gloria buildings, with approximate sizes and distances from each other. Later we will do a complete maquette in plasticine so that there is no confusion. Every man will have his job to do\u0027 - he smiled - \u0027like the commandos in the war. Yes?\u0027 \n Bond bent to his task while the others talked. The telephone rang. Marc-Ange picked it up. He jotted down a few words and rang off. He turned to Bond, his eyes momentarily suspicious. \u0027It is a telegram for me from London signed Universal. It says, \"The birds have assembled in the town and all fly tomorrow.\" What is this, my friend?\u0027 \n Bond kicked himself for his forgetfulness. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, \n Marc-Ange. I meant to tell you you might get a signal like that. It means that the girls are in Zurich and are flying to England tomorrow. It is very good news. It was important to have them out of the way.\u0027 \n \u0027Ah, good! Very good indeed! That is fine news. And you were quite right not to have the telegram addressed to you. You are not supposed to be here or to know me at all. It is better so.\u0027 He fired some more Corsican at the two men. They nodded their understanding. \n After that, the meeting soon broke up. Marc-Ange examined Bond\u0027s handiwork and passed it over to Toussaint. The man glanced at the sketch and folded it as if it were a valuable share-certificate. With short bows in Bond\u0027s direction, the two men left the room. \n Marc-Ange sat back with a sigh of satisfaction. \u0027It goes well,\u0027 he said. \u0027The whole team will receive good danger money. And they love a good rough fight. And they are pleased that I am coming to lead them.\u0027 He laughed slyly. \u0027They are less certain of you, my dear James. They say you will get in the way. I had to tell them that you could out-shoot and outfight the lot of them. When I say something like that, they have to believe me. I have never let them down yet. I hope I am right?\u0027 \n \u0027Please don\u0027t try me,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I\u0027ve never taken on a Corsican and I don\u0027t want to start now.1 \n Marc-Ange was delighted. \u0027You might win with guns. But not in close combat. They are pigs, my men. Great pigs. The greatest. I am taking five of the best. With you and me that is seven. How many did you say there are on the mountain?\u0027 \n \u0027About eight. And the big one.\u0027 \n \u0027Ah yes, the big one,\u0027 said Marc-Ange reflectively. \u0027That is one that must not get away,\u0027 He got up. \u0027And now, my friend, I have ordered dinner, a good dinner, to be served us up here. And then we will go to bed stinking of garlic and, perhaps, just a little bit drunk. Yes?\u0027 \n From his heart Bond said, \u0027I can\u0027t think of anything better.\u0027 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578/46880.html","bookId":1271,"book":{"id":1271,"title":"007‰πãÂ•≥ÁéãÂØÜ‰Ωø On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service","description":"ÁÆÄ‰ªãÔºö Ë¥ùÊ¥õÁ¶èÂú®ÁëûÂ£´Â±±Âå∫Âª∫Á´ã‰∏Ä‰∏™ÁñóÂÖªÈô¢Ôºå‰ΩÜÂÆûÈôÖ‰∏äÂç¥Èò¥Ë∞ãËøõË°å‰∏ÄÈ°πÊéßÂà∂ÂÖ®ÁêÉÁöÑÈáéÂøÉËÆ°ÂàíÔºåÂ∞±ÊòØÂ∞ÜÁóÖÊØíÊ≥®Â∞ÑÂà∞Â•≥ÊÇ£ËÄÖË∫´‰∏äÔºåÁÑ∂ÂêéÂàÜÊ¥æÂà∞‰∏ñÁïåÂêÑÂú∞Ôºå‰ºÅÂõæÊéåÊè°‰∏ñÁïå‰∏ªÊùÉ„ÄÇ007Â•âÂëΩË∞ÉÊü•Ê≠§Ê°àÔºå‰πîË£ÖÂÆ∂Ë∞±Â≠¶ÂÆ∂ËíôÊ∑∑ËÄåÂÖ•ÔºåÂèäÊó∂ÁÇ∏ÊØÅÂÆûÈ™åÂÆ§ÔºåÊåΩÊïë‰∫Ü‰∏ñÁïå„ÄÇ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/13/09-47-14-83-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1578","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
