It says “PEACE PILGRIM” in white letters on the front of the tunicand “25,000 Miles On Foot for Peace” on the back. She has walked the25,000 miles. However, she continues to walk, for her vow is,“I shall remaina wanderer until mankind has learned the way of peace, walking until I amgiven shelter and fasting until I am given food.” She walks without a pennyin her pockets and she is not affiliated with any organization. She walks as aprayer and as a chance to inspire others to pray and work with her for peace. She speaks to individuals along the way, to gatherings such as church groupsor college groups, through newspapers, magazines, radio, television—relatinginteresting and meaningful experiences, discussing peace within and without. She feels we have learned that war is not the way to peace—that security doesnot lie in stockpiles of bombs. She points out that this is a crisis period inhuman history, and that we who live in the world today must choose betweena nuclear war of annihilation and a golden age of peace. Although she doesnot ask to see results, thousands of letters testify that her journey has not beenin vain—saying, in effect,“Since talking with you I’ve decided that I shouldbe doing something for peace also.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1846/53519.html","bookId":975,"book":{"id":975,"title":"Peace Pilgrim 和平朝圣者","description":"简介： I am a pilgrim, a wanderer.
