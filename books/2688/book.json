The lone girl in the prolific McKay family, Keely needs another man giving her orders like she needs a hole in her boot. What she does need is a restoration specialist so she can open her physical therapy clinic and prove she\u0027s left her wild-child days behind. That means dealing with buttoned-down, uptight Jack. Jack is this close to securing a career make-or-break project, until he learns his lack of marital status puts him out of contention. When the notoriously hot-tempered and hot-bodied Keely begs him for help, he proposes a crazy idea. He\u0027ll oversee her project if she acts the part of his loving fiance. Their sizzling lust makes it all too easy to go from butting heads to knocking boots but outside the bedroom they\u0027re as mismatched as ever. The McKays remind Jack of the humble upbringing he left behind, and cowgirl Keely feels she doesn\u0027t measure up to Jack\u0027s big-city lifestyle. When the dust settles, Jack and Keely must face the fact they\u0027re not fooling anyone but themselves or they\u0027ll risk losing the real deal. Warning: this book contains one hot-blooded cowgirl and one cool-headed businessman in a stripped-down, revved-up game of sexual truth or dare.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/all-jacked-up-rough-riders-8.jpg","author":"Lorelei James","type":"Western","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":52,"category":{"id":8,"name":"Western","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
