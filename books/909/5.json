{"id":43156,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V \"THE LASS OF RICHMOND HILL\"","content":"Two afternoons later, the three active members of the Antiquarian Club rushed up the stoop of the Charlton Street house in a breathless scurry. And Margaret awaited them in the parlor in a fever of no less eager excitement. \n \n \"Hurry, girls!\" she cried when the first greetings were over. \"I\u0027ve just got heaps to read to you! And some of it\u0027ll make you \u0027sit up and take notice,\u0027 as Alexander says!\" \n \n \"Who\u0027s Alexander?\" queried Corinne, curiously. \n \n \"Oh, he\u0027s a boy-cousin who lives with us,\" Bess enlightened her. \"He was Mother\u0027s sister\u0027s child, and his parents are both dead now, so Mother had him come here a year or two ago. He\u0027s twelve years old and a perfect nuisance! He hates girls, so he generally66 keeps out of our way. That\u0027s why you\u0027ve never seen him. But, come on! I\u0027m wild to hear what\u0027s coming next! Margaret wouldn\u0027t tell us a single thing she\u0027s found out.\" \n \n \"Wait a minute before we begin,\" spoke up Corinne, \"and let\u0027s just run over what we\u0027ve already discovered. It\u0027ll keep us from getting mixed up. A young girl of sixteen has run away from her home in Bermuda, and is in some place where she thinks her life is in danger. Before she ran away, she did something to assist in some plot against her country (which must be Bermuda), and probably that\u0027s one reason why she is in danger. Maybe something\u0027s been discovered about it. She\u0027s staying with a Madame M., and it seems to be a house of mystery. \n \n \"One thing I have pretty well guessed, and probably so have you all—that this must have happened a long time ago. Her language isn\u0027t very—well, modern—sounds to me like stories I\u0027ve read about old England, and America too in former times. I think it\u0027s67 likely she\u0027s in one of those two countries when she writes—probably England, because she speaks of \u0027Madame M.\u0027 and \u0027Lady Blank,\u0027 and those titles don\u0027t somehow go with America. Then there\u0027s something strange about a sapphire signet. But go on now, Margaret! Maybe you\u0027ve discovered something new!\" \n \n Margaret smiled mysteriously. \"Perhaps just a few things!\" she admitted. \"Here\u0027s where we left off. I\u0027ve copied it all from the beginning. You remember where she tells about explaining the signet later? Now I\u0027ll go on: \n \n \"There is something strange and evil about this house. I can trust no one. Especially do I mistrust the steward. He hath a sleek smile and ingratiating manners, but he is wicked to the heart of him. He associates much with one Corbie, who keeps the tavern down the road hard by the woods. Corbie has been to this house, and once was closeted long with the steward. When he came forth to go, he gazed hard at me as I stood on the lawn. It made me shudder for an hour afterward.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s the first name she has mentioned—\u0027Corbie,\u0027\" interrupted Corinne. \"Let\u0027s remember68 it. Who knows but it may help us?\" \n \n \"There\u0027s another coming right away,\" added Margaret, \"though I don\u0027t know whether it will be of any help or not. \n \n \"But one thing has happened lately to cheer me. Two nights ago I went to my room, which does not look toward the river, but toward the back of the house. I was minded to retire early, having naught to occupy me through the long evening. Madame M. retires at nine, but I never see her after the evening meal. She is usually in conference with the steward, who has chief charge of the affairs of this great house. She appears to place much confidence in him. But that is not to the point. \n \n \"I had opened my window and was leaning out a moment when I heard a softly whistled tune, and knew that H. was there. For the tune he ever whistles is \u0027The Lass of Richmond Hill,\u0027 which he declared, when first he brought me here, was right appropriate to me now.\" \n \n \"I wonder why?\" queried Jess. \n \n \"I can\u0027t imagine,\" answered Corinne; \"\u0027lass\u0027 she certainly is, but what has \u0027Richmond Hill\u0027 to do with it? What is \u0027Richmond Hill,\u0027 and where?\" \n \n 69 \n \n \"Mother has a friend who lives in Richmond Hill, Long Island,\" ventured Bess. \n \n \"Oh, that can\u0027t be it!\" declared Corinne, scornfully. \"That\u0027s only a little new suburb that\u0027s hardly been in existence thirty years! It has nothing whatever to do with this! And I wonder who \u0027H.\u0027 is, too. Well, go on, Margaret.\" \n \n Margaret obediently continued: \n \n \"At hearing him, my heart did beat gladly, for he is the one person I have seen who reminds me of home. I leaned far out and called to him softly, and presently he threw into my window a letter weighted with a stone. It said he and his uncle had not been back to Bermuda, nor would they dare to go for many a long day. One of their traitorous sailors had divulged the plot, and the authorities were wild only to lay hands on them. This they had learned in roundabout fashion. They had been cruising along the coast lately, and had had not a few adventures. They were sailing at midnight for parts unknown. He did but come up hastily to see how I fared, before they left. \n \n \"In a moment I threw down an answering missive, telling of my present plight, and begging that he and his uncle would take me back to Bermuda should they ever be sailing there again. That was all I had70–72 time for, since he knew he dared not linger. He went away silently into the night. \u0027Twas brave of him to come, since he knows it would be ill for him to be seen hereabout, now that so much seems to have been discovered.\" \n \n Gazing \n \"He gazed hard at me as I stood on the lawn\" \n \n Margaret paused here and half whispered: \"Hold your breath now, girls! We\u0027re coming to the sapphire signet!\" Then she went on with the reading: \n \n \"I must now explain about the sapphire signet. Night after night I lie awake and ask myself why I ever took it—why I was ever tempted to add this mistake to the rest of my misdoings. At the time it seemed no wrong,—nay, it seemed entirely right that I should take with me what Grandfather has so often said was mine, though he deemed it safer not to allow me to have it in my keeping till I should come of age. \n \n \"\u0027Tis such a pretty bauble—this wonderful blue stone larger than my thumb-nail, with our family crest graved on it and set all round the edge with tiny, sparkling diamonds. Grandfather told me that the sapphire was once in a great ring, and from generation to generation had been handed down to the eldest son of the family. He said, moreover, that it ever should have remained a ring; that \u0027twas a crime it should have been changed. But \u0027twas my mother\u0027s whim that it should be taken from the ring, set round73 with diamonds, and made into an ornament for her neck. He said that once, when they were in London not long after their marriage, she wheedled my father into having it changed, and came home to Bermuda with the jewel hanging from a slender chain about her white throat. And Grandfather was filled with wrath at her and never forgave her. Had I been a boy, he says, he would have had the stone reset in a ring. But since the only heir to it is a girl, he has allowed it to remain thus, and once scornfully told me that \u0027twas \u0027as useless now as I was,\u0027 and might as well so remain. \n \n \"On rare occasions, Grandfather has let me wear it—once to a grand tea-drinking at St. George\u0027s, where \u0027twas much admired. But mainly he has kept it in his great strong box. It seemed no harm that day for me to take it. The box stood invitingly open. The jewel was really mine, and I possessed no other ornament. Even then I realized that I might never see my home or Grandfather again. So I took it—Heaven forgive me!—thinking it no wrong. But I have come to feel differently since. In these long, lonely months, when I have had so much time to think and to regret, I can see how this act of mine must appear to Grandfather and to all who know me. Even though it was in effect my own, it was still in his keeping, and I should never have taken it without his consent. I dare not even wonder what he must think of me, and I live only for the opportunity to return home and place the signet in his hands. \n \n 74 \n \n \"From the very first I have never dared openly to wear the beautiful thing; and since my conscience began to trouble me, I have never wished to. Long since, I removed it from its velvet riband and concealed it. Nor must I, even here, disclose where it is hidden. To do so would be neither safe nor wise. Suffice it that I will never more wear the bauble till I have restored it to its rightful keeper, my grandfather.\" \n \n Margaret paused again, and there was a blissful sigh from all her assembled listeners. \n \n \"Isn\u0027t it the most fascinating thing—this sapphire signet business?\" exclaimed Corinne, at last. \"I can just imagine how the poor girl felt. She hadn\u0027t meant any harm in taking it—it had seemed perfectly right. And then her conscience got to troubling her till she hadn\u0027t a peaceful minute! But where in the world could she have hidden it? Does it tell later on, Margaret?\" \n \n \"Not that I\u0027ve discovered as yet, but there are a lot of other interesting things—\" \n \n \"Go on, go on then!\" chorused the waiting three, impatient of anything that broke the thread of the story. \n \n 75 \n \n \"Well, the next seems to be written some time later, but I can\u0027t tell how much. This is something like a diary, only she doesn\u0027t put down any dates. She just seems to leave spaces between the different entries. It\u0027s kind of confusing. Now she says: \n \n \"A strange thing happened last night. At midnight I awoke. I heard confused sounds on the road without. Carts creaking by, men shouting and calling, women crying, and children screaming as with fright. The sounds continued till near morning. An endless procession of carts and coaches. \u0027Twould seem as though the whole city were in flight. \u0027Twas odd to hear so much racket in this quiet region. \n \n \"To-day the whole household is in agitation. Fear seems to have seized on all. The servants are in a panic. Only the steward seems undisturbed. Madame M. is calm in manner, but I can see that she is much perturbed inwardly.\" \n \n \"What in the world could have been happening?\" demanded Bess. \"She speaks of the \u0027city.\u0027 I wonder what city, and what was the matter? Why should every one be leaving it?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve been thinking all along that she was somewhere in England,\" suggested Corinne,76 \"though I can\u0027t imagine what part. Anyway—\" \n \n \"Wait!\" cried Margaret. \"Why don\u0027t you let me go on?\" \n \n \"That\u0027s so!\" agreed Corinne. \"It\u0027s foolish not to see what\u0027s coming before we try to make sense of it. Go on!\" \n \n Margaret continued. \"Next she says: \n \n \"Some of the servants left yesterday. I now know the cause. The rebels are threatening to take possession of the city. Ships filled with soldiers stand in the waters near by. \u0027Tis feared there will be a great battle soon. Madame M. is very ill. She has taken to her bed. I think great fear has made her so—and great anger. She is being cared for by the housekeeper, Mistress Ph?be. I have come to like Mistress Ph?be. She is the one soul who treats me with kindness unfailing. She, too, hates the steward. She told me so. She and the steward and one other servant are all that are left here now. The rest have fled. Would that the steward had fled also! He seems to have some urgent reason for remaining. He has had another interview with Corbie, in this house.\" \n \n \"Wait a minute!\" interrupted Corinne, once more. \"I have an idea. I am going to put down on a paper every name she mentions, no77 matter how insignificant, and see if they will lead us to any sort of a clue. Names are about the only clues for finding out things, when you come to think of it!\" She hunted in her bag for a pencil and notebook. Then she continued: \n \n \"Now, there\u0027s \u0027Bermuda\u0027—that was the first, and the only real definite thing we\u0027ve discovered yet—and \u0027London.\u0027 Then there\u0027s \u0027Madame M.,\u0027 which doesn\u0027t help much. And \u0027Lady Blank\u0027 is no good at all, nor is \u0027H.\u0027 \u0027Corbie\u0027 may be useful, but I don\u0027t think Mistress Ph?be\u0027 will—and that\u0027s all, I guess.\" \n \n \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" contradicted Margaret. \"You forgot the \u0027Lass of Richmond Hill\u0027!\" \n \n \"True enough! Of course that\u0027s only the name of a song, but I\u0027ll put it down. Who knows but what it may be the most important of all! I have a book of old songs at home, and I have just a faint idea that there\u0027s one of that name in it. I\u0027ll hunt it up to-night. But as usual, it\u0027s late, and I must be hurrying along. Haven\u0027t you read about all you\u0027ve puzzled out, Margaret?\" \n \n 78 \n \n \"I\u0027ve done another entry,\" replied Margaret, slowly and mysteriously, \"and perhaps you\u0027d better hear it. It may be worth your while!\" \n \n \"Oh, what is it?\" cried Corinne, pausing in the act of adjusting her hat. \"Quick!\" \n \n \"Here it is: \n \n \"Madame M. sent for me to-day. \u0027Tis the first time since she took to her bed. She did so to give me this strange warning. These be her very words: \u0027It is rumored that this house may soon be taken possession of by rebels. If so, I wish you to have no communication with any of them, Mistress Alison.\" \n \n There was an instant\u0027s silence. Then Corinne threw her hat on a chair and exclaimed: \n \n \"Hurrah! At last we have this mysterious lassie\u0027s name! It\u0027s Alison! That\u0027s the biggest discovery yet. Is there any more?\" \n \n \"Yes, one thing,\" answered Margaret, \"the strangest of all. It\u0027s a later entry and is only three words long—the first word twice underlined: \n \n \"He has come!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1918/55144.html","bookId":909,"book":{"id":909,"title":"The Sapphire Signet","description":"简介： It was five o\u0027clock and a very dull, dark afternoon in Charlton Street.
