{"id":43152,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I THE HOUSE IN CHARLTON STREET","content":"It was five o\u0027clock and a very dull, dark afternoon in Charlton Street. One by one lights had twinkled out in all the little two-story-and-dormer-windowed houses on the block,—in all but one. The parlor windows of this house were still unlit, but behind the flower-box in one of them a hand could be seen moving aside the white curtains at frequent intervals and a dim face peering anxiously into the dusk. \n \n At ten minutes past five precisely, two trim girl-figures turned the corner of Varick Street, hurried down the block, raced up the steps of this same house, and waved frantically at the4 dark windows. An answering wave saluted them from between the parted curtains. At the same moment lights twinkled out from the windows, and a quick hand pulled down the shades with a jerk, shutting out the dim street for the night. But back of the drawn shades a small figure in an invalid-chair held out welcoming arms to the girls who had just entered. \n \n \"My! How long you were! I thought you\u0027d never get here to-day. And it\u0027s been so dark and dismal all the afternoon, too!\" The two girls, who were plainly twins, knelt down, one on each side of the invalid-chair. \n \n \"We were an age, I know, Margaret dear,\" began Bess, \"but there was a good reason. It\u0027s quite exciting,—all about the new girl!\" \n \n \"Yes, you can never guess what, either!\" echoed Jess, winding one of Margaret\u0027s dark curls around her finger. \n \n \"Oh, tell me—quick!\" The child\u0027s big, beautiful gray eyes fairly sparkled with eagerness, and a faint flush tinted her delicate face. \"Is it that queer girl you told me about, who only came into the class a few days ago?\" \n \n 5 \n \n \"That\u0027s the one,—but let\u0027s get our things off first and see if Sarah made any cookies to-day. We\u0027re starving!\" \n \n A huge woman who had been moving about the room lighting gas-jets, pulling down shades, and straightening the furniture, now broke into the conversation: \"Ye kin save yerselves the trouble! I ain\u0027t made no cookies this day—an\u0027 me wid all that wash! What d\u0027 ye think I be?\" \n \n \"Go \u0027long, Sarah!\" laughed Bess. \"You know there\u0027s probably a whole jarful in the pantry, and we don\u0027t care whether you made them to-day or a week ago. They\u0027re always dandy!\" \n \n Sarah gave a chuckle that shook her huge frame, and tucked a light shawl lovingly about the knees of the girl in the chair. \n \n \"Ye\u0027ll have a hard time findin\u0027 any!\" she warned, as the two ran off. \"Won\u0027t they, Margie, macushla?\" \n \n In five minutes the twins were back, each with a massive chunk of chocolate layer-cake in her hand and a mouth full of the same. \n \n 6 \n \n \"You told the truth, Sarah, for once! There weren\u0027t any cookies, but this is heaps better!\" \n \n \"If ye get any crumbs on me floor,\" threatened Sarah, ominously, \"ye\u0027ll have no more cake of any kind, the week out!\" And she departed downstairs in great (pretended) displeasure. \n \n \"Now for it! Tell me right away,\" demanded Margaret. \"I\u0027m so impatient to hear!\" \n \n \"Well,\" began Bess, in muffled tones, struggling to swallow a large mouthful of cake, \"you remember we told you about that nice girl who came into our section three days ago, but who seemed so offish and queer and quiet. She\u0027s always staring out of the window, as if she were dreaming. And when she isn\u0027t studying, she\u0027s reading some book the whole time. And she hardly ever talks to a soul. Jess and I thought she must feel rather lonesome and strange. You know it is rather hard to come into the first year of High School more than a month after everything\u0027s started, and every7 one else has got acquainted, and try to pick up! I think one must feel so awfully out of it! \n \n \"So Jess and I decided we\u0027d ask her to eat lunch with us to-day. She always eats by herself, and yesterday she didn\u0027t eat at all,—just read a book the whole time! I went up to her at lunch-period and said—\" \n \n \"What\u0027s her name?\" interrupted Margaret. \n \n \"Corinne Cameron,—isn\u0027t it a dandy name? Corinne! It has such a distinguished sound!—Well, she was reading, as usual, and looked up at me sort of dazed and far-away when I asked her if she\u0027d care to eat with us. But she seemed very glad to do it and came right over. We had a very interesting talk, and she asked us right away to call her \u0027Corinne,\u0027 instead of \u0027Miss Cameron,\u0027 as they do in High School. She said it made her feel about a hundred miles away from every one to be called \u0027Miss.\u0027 So of course we asked her to call us \u0027Elisabeth\u0027 and \u0027Jessica.\u0027\" \n \n \"But why didn\u0027t you tell her just \u0027Bess\u0027 and \u0027Jess\u0027?\" interrupted Margaret again. \"That\u0027s so much more natural.\" \n \n 8 \n \n \"Well, you see, \u0027Corinne\u0027 sounds so sort of distinguished and—and dignified! And somehow our names don\u0027t. They just seem ordinary and—and so like small children. And at least \u0027Elisabeth\u0027 and \u0027Jessica\u0027 seem more—grown-up!\" \n \n \"What does she look like?\" questioned Margaret, going off on another tack. \n \n \"Oh, she\u0027s, well, sort of distinguished-looking, too—like her name. She\u0027s tall and slim and has very dark brown wavy hair, and big, dark eyes, almost black, and the prettiest straight nose,—not a little snub like ours (I don\u0027t mean yours, Margaret! That\u0027s all right!). But she always acts as though her thoughts were about a thousand miles away. She talked about books mostly, and asked us if we didn\u0027t just love to read. And when we said no, not so awfully, she seemed so astonished. I said we\u0027d rather play basket-ball, and she laughed and said we couldn\u0027t play that all the time, and what did we do with our spare moments. I told her we didn\u0027t have many, because, at home here, we were always busy amusing9 you or helping Sarah, when we weren\u0027t studying. \n \n \"Then she asked about you, Margaret, and was so interested when we told her about your poor back, and how you couldn\u0027t move around much or go to school, but studied with us and knew just as much as we did—and more, because you read a great deal, too, even though you are only thirteen and we\u0027re fifteen. And she said: \n \n \"\u0027That\u0027s perfectly fine!\u0027 Well, we were talking so hard that we scarcely noticed lunch-period was over, and we hadn\u0027t said half that we wanted to. She promised to eat with us every day. \n \n \"This afternoon we decided not to stay for basket-ball in the gym, because Jess\u0027s finger hurts so much where she cut it last night. So we left at half-past two (which we hardly ever do), and who should start to walk over our way but Corinne, and she was delighted that we could go part of the way together. She lives in the Ten Eyck, that swell new apartment in West Twelfth Street.\" \n \n 10 \n \n \"The Ten Eyck!\" exclaimed Margaret, in a tone of hushed awe. \"Gracious! she must be very wealthy, then!\" \n \n \"Wait till you hear!\" murmured Jess, parenthetically, and Bess went on: \n \n \"She told us they\u0027d just moved there because her father, who isn\u0027t in very good health, has to live near his business. He\u0027s in a big steamship company on West Street. And until now they\u0027ve always lived in an apartment on Madison Avenue near Central Park. They just moved down here a week ago. Her mother is dead, and an aunt, her father\u0027s sister, lives with them. \n \n \"By this time we had reached the Ten Eyck, and what do you think!—she asked us to come in and chat awhile, because she was all alone. Her aunt was out at some club. Of course we went in, and my! but it was splendiferous, especially going up to the eighth floor in a big elevator! Their rooms are sort of built all around a central hall. It\u0027s different from any apartment we were ever in. Corinne took us to her room, which was about as large as this11 parlor, and had the cutest low bookcases all around the walls and lovely cushioned seats in the windows. And we sat there and talked a long time. \n \n \"But here\u0027s another queer thing about her. While we were talking about school and our studies, and how hard the geometry seemed, she suddenly showed us an old book that was lying on her table,—it was a very old, battered-up looking book with brown stains on the leaves, and one cover half hanging off, and the queerest old-fashioned pictures,—and, she asked us whether we\u0027d like to look at it. She said it was her chief treasure just now. It was called \u0027Valentine\u0027s Manual, Volume II,\u0027 and seemed to be all about New York City in very early times. She said her father had picked it up at an auction-sale of some one\u0027s library, and had given it to her for her birthday. \n \n \"I didn\u0027t say much, for somehow I thought it was an awfully queer thing to get for your birthday—an old, dilapidated, uninteresting book like that! And then I guess she saw that we were surprised, for she said: \n \n 12 \n \n \"\u0027Don\u0027t you love old things?\u0027 \n \n \"I just had to laugh,—it all seemed so queer! And I said, no, I preferred them brand-new. And then she said: \n \n \"\u0027Well, perhaps every one doesn\u0027t feel the same as I do; for Father says I\u0027m a born antiquarian, just as he is!\u0027 We couldn\u0027t say a word, either of us, for actually, we don\u0027t know what \u0027antiquarian\u0027 means! She went out of the room just after that and brought back some lemonade and little sweet crackers. Then we had to leave, for it was getting late, and we knew you\u0027d be watching for us.\" Here Bess ended her recital and Margaret instantly exclaimed: \n \n \"Get the dictionary—quick! I want to see what \u0027antiquarian\u0027 means!\" \n \n \"That\u0027s just like you!\" commented Jess, as she hauled a big Webster\u0027s Unabridged out of the bookcase. \"You\u0027re a lot like Corinne, too. I think you two would get on beautifully together. Here it is: \n \n \"\u0027Antiquarian,—one who is addicted to the study of antiquities; an admirer of antiquity.\u002713 And \u0027antiquities\u0027 are old things, of course. Well, what she sees to admire in \u0027em beats me! Anyhow, she\u0027s an awfully nice girl,—sort of unusual, you know,—and I\u0027m glad we made her acquaintance. Bess and I were saying on the way home that it\u0027s kind of like an adventure to meet unusual people—\" Jess broke off suddenly, at the sound of a latch-key in the front door, and they all exclaimed: \n \n \"There\u0027s Mother! Isn\u0027t she early to-night!\" \n \n A pleasant-voiced woman called out to them cheerily, and a moment later entered the room. Mrs. Bronson\u0027s face, which singularly resembled her youngest daughter\u0027s, had once been very pretty, but now showed many traces of anxious care. Her expression was of one who was constantly thinking over worrisome matters. But at the sight of the trio her face lit up, the lines smoothed away temporarily, and ten years seemed magically to drop from her as she sat down in the group, questioning them about the affairs of their day. \n \n After a few moments the twins went off14 downstairs to help Sarah with the dinner, and Margaret was left to her coveted half-hour alone with her mother. \n \n \"Oh, Mummy,\" she sighed, snuggling her head on Mrs. Bronson\u0027s shoulder, \"this is lovely! You don\u0027t often get home so early. But I appreciate it specially, because I feel sort of blue and no-\u0027count to-night.\" \n \n \"Is that so, dear?\" exclaimed her mother, some of the anxious lines returning to her face. \"Is the pain worse? What has happened to-day?\" \n \n \"No, it isn\u0027t my back,\" Margaret almost sobbed. \"It\u0027s just that nothing has happened—to me—to-day; nothing ever does happen! I just sit here all day long, waiting for \u0027something to turn up,\u0027 like Dickens\u0027 Mr. Micawber, and nothing ever does turn up! The twins go out and meet nice people and have pleasant things happen, but there\u0027s nothing like that for me. Oh, I want some adventures—just one nice, big, beautiful adventure would do—some delightful, unexpected surprise! I\u0027d be content if I could have just one!\" It was very15 unusual for Margaret to make the slightest complaint, and it was well now that her head was on her mother\u0027s shoulder, and that she did not see the sudden pain in Mrs. Bronson\u0027s face. \n \n \"Dearie, I know!\" her mother said. \"It\u0027s dull enough for you, sitting here day after day. But we\u0027re all doing the best we can to make you happy. After all, you never can tell what\u0027s going to happen. Just keep on hoping for something interesting to \u0027turn up,\u0027 and I\u0027m sure sometime it will. Things occasionally happen in the most unexpected way! Even Mr. Micawber had something pleasant \u0027turn up\u0027 after a while, if you remember.\" \n \n Margaret snuggled her head closer. \"You\u0027re a dear, Mummy! You do cheer me up so! I feel better already, and I\u0027m going to hope harder than ever that something nice and interesting—some real adventure—will turn up sometime, perhaps soon!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1918/55140.html","bookId":909,"book":{"id":909,"title":"The Sapphire Signet","description":"简介： It was five o\u0027clock and a very dull, dark afternoon in Charlton Street.
