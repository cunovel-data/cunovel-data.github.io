He\u0027s a toilet slave.\"\n \"What the hell is a toilet slave?\"\n \"I wish you knew because it doesn\u0027t especially thrill me to discuss it.\" She put her teacup down. \"A toilet slave is, well, they\u0027ll have different kinds of kinks, but an example would be that he wants to be ordered to drink piss or eat shit, or to clean out your ass with his tongue, or clean out the toilet, or other things. What you have to tell him to do can be really disgusting or it can just be sort of symbolic, like if you made him mop the bathroom floor.\"\n \"Why would anybody- never mind, don\u0027t tell me.\"\n \"It\u0027s getting to be a very strange world, Matt.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"Like nobody seems to fuck anymore. You can make a ton doing masochist tricks. They\u0027ll pay a fortune if you can fill up their fantasy for them. But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth it. I\u0027d rather not have to contend with all that weirdness.\"\n \"You\u0027re just an old-fashioned girl, Elaine.\"\n \"That\u0027s me. Crinolines and lavender sachets and all those good things. \u0027Nother drink?\"\n \"Just a touch.\"\n When she brought it I said, \"Manns or Manch or something like that. I\u0027ll see if that goes anywhere. I think it\u0027s a dead-end street anyway. I\u0027m getting more and more interested in cops.\"\n \"Because of what I said?\"\n \"That, and also something some other people have said. Did she have somebody on the force that sort of looked out for her?\"\n \"You mean the way you used to for me? Sure she did, but where does that get you? It was your friend.\"\n \"Broadfield?\"\n \"Sure. That extortion number was pure bullshit, but I guess you knew that.\"\n I nodded. \"She have anybody else?\"\n \"Could be, but I never heard about it. And no pimp and no boyfriends, unless you count Broadfield as a boyfriend.\"\n \"Any other cops in her life? Giving her a hard time, anything like that?\"\n \"Not that I heard about.\"\n I took a sip of Scotch. \"This is off the subject a little, Elaine, but do cops ever give you a hard time?\"\n \"Do you mean do they or have they ever? It\u0027s happened in the past. But then I learned a little. You have somebody regular, and the rest of the guys let you be.\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"And if I get a hard time from somebody else, I mention some names or I make a phone call and everything cools down. You know what\u0027s worse? Not cops. Guys pretending to be cops.\"\n \"Impersonating an officer? That\u0027s a criminal offense, you know.\"\n \"Well, shit, Matt, am I gonna press charges? Like I\u0027ve had cats flash badges at me, the whole number. You take a green kid who just got to town and all she\u0027s got to see is a silver shield and she\u0027ll curl up in a corner and have kittens. I\u0027m supercool myself. I take a good look at the badge and it turns out to be a toy thing that a little kid\u0027ll get to go with his cap pistol. Don\u0027t laugh, I mean it. I\u0027ve had that happen.\"\n \"And what do they want from you? Money?\"\n \"Oh, they pretend it\u0027s a gag after I pick up on them. But it\u0027s no gag. I\u0027ve had them want money, but mostly all they want is to get fucked for free.\"\n \"And they flash a toy badge.\"\n \"I\u0027ve seen badges you\u0027d swear came out of crackerjack boxes.\"\n \"Men are weird animals.\"\n \"Oh, men and women both, honey. I\u0027ll tell you something. Everybody\u0027s weird, fundamentally everybody is a snap. Sometimes it\u0027s a sexual thing and sometimes it\u0027s a different kind of weirdness, but one way or another everybody\u0027s nuts. You, me, the whole world.\"\n IT wasn\u0027t particularly difficult to discover that Leon J. Manch had been appointed assistant deputy mayor a year and a half ago. All it took was a short session in the Forty-second Street library. There were a variety of Mannses and Mantzes in the volume of the Times Index I consulted, but none of them seemed to have anything significant to do with the current administration. Manch was mentioned only once in the Times Indexes for the past five years. The story dealt with his appointment, and I went to the trouble of reading the article in the microfilm room. It was a brief article, and Manch was one of half a dozen people treated in it; about all it did was announce that he\u0027d been appointed and identify him as a member of the bar. I learned nothing about his age, residence, marital status, or much of anything else. It didn\u0027t say he was a toilet slave, but I already knew that.\n I couldn\u0027t find him in the Manhattan telephone book. Maybe he lived in another borough, or outside of the city limits altogether. Maybe he had an unlisted phone or listed it in his wife\u0027s name. I called City Hall and was told that he\u0027d left for the day. I didn\u0027t even try for his home number.\n I called her from a bar on Madison and Fifty-first called O\u0027Brien\u0027s. The bartender\u0027s name was Nick, and I knew him because he had worked at Armstrong\u0027s a year or so ago. We assured each other that it was a small world, bought each other a few drinks, and then I went to the phone booth in the back and dialed her number. I had to look it up in my notebook.\n When she answered I said, \"It\u0027s Matthew. Can you talk?\"\n \"Hello. Yes, I can talk. I\u0027m all alone here. My sister and her husband drove in from Bayport and picked up the children this morning. They\u0027ll be staying out there for, oh, for a while, anyway. They thought it would be better for the children and easier for me. I didn\u0027t really want them to take the kids, but I didn\u0027t have the strength to argue, and maybe they\u0027re right, maybe it\u0027s better this way.\"\n \"You sound a little shaky.\"\n \"Not shaky. Just very drawn, very worn out. Are you all right?\"\n \"I\u0027m fine.\"\n \"I wish you were here.\"\n \"So do I.\"\n \"Oh, dear. I wish I knew how I felt about all of this. It frightens me. Do you know what I mean?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"His lawyer called earlier. Have you spoken to him?\"\n \"No. Was he trying to get in touch with me?\"\n \"He didn\u0027t seem very interested in you, as a matter of fact. He was very confident about winning in court, and when I said that you were trying to find out who really killed that woman, he seemed- how shall I put it? I got the impression that he believed Jerry was guilty. He intends to get him acquitted, but he doesn\u0027t really believe for a minute that he\u0027s really innocent.\"\n \"A lot of lawyers are like that, Diana.\"\n \"Like a surgeon who decides it\u0027s his job to remove an appendix. Whether there\u0027s anything wrong with the appendix or not.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s exactly the same thing, but I know what you mean. I wonder if there\u0027s any point in my contacting that lawyer.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. What I was starting to sayâ€¦ Oh, it\u0027s silly, and it\u0027s hard to say. Matthew? I was disappointed when I picked up the phone and it was the lawyer. Because I was hoping, oh, that it would be you.\" Pause. \"Matthew?\"\n \"I\u0027m here.\"\n \"Should I not have said that?\"\n \"No, don\u0027t be silly.\" I caught my breath. The telephone booth had gotten unbearably warm. I opened the door a little. \"I wanted to call you earlier. I shouldn\u0027t be calling now, really. I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve made very much progress.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad you called, anyway. Are you getting anywhere at all?\"\n \"Maybe. Did your husband ever say anything to you about writing a book?\"\n \"Me write a book? I wouldn\u0027t know where to start. I used to write poetry. Not very good poetry, I\u0027m afraid.\"\n \"I meant did he say anything about the possibility of him writing a book.\"\n \"Jerry? He doesn\u0027t read books, let alone write them. Why?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you when I see you. I\u0027m learning things. The question is whether or not they\u0027ll fit together into something significant. He didn\u0027t do it. I know that much.\"\n \"You\u0027re more certain of it than you were yesterday.\"\n \"Yes.\" Pause. \"I\u0027ve been thinking about you.\"\n \"That\u0027s good. I think it\u0027s good. What sort of thoughts?\"\n \"Curious ones.\"\n \"Good curious or bad curious?\"\n \"Oh, good, I guess.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been thinking, too.\"\n Chapter 11\n I wound up spending the evening in the Village. I was oddly restless, possessed of an undirected energy that enervated me and kept me moving. It was a Friday night, and the better downtown bars were crowded and noisy as they always are on Fridays. I hit the Kettle and Minetta\u0027s and Whitey\u0027s and McBell\u0027s and the San Giorgio and the Lion\u0027s Head and the Riviera and other places the names of which I don\u0027t remember. But because I couldn\u0027t settle in anywhere I wound up having only one drink to a bar and walking off most of the effect of the alcohol between drinks. I kept moving and I kept drifting west, away from the tourist area and closer to where the Village rubs up against the Hudson River.\n It must have been around midnight when I hit Sinthia\u0027s. It was fairly far west on Christopher Street, the last stop for gay cruisers on their way to meet the longshoremen and truckers in the shadow of the docks. Gay bars do not threaten me, but neither are they places I habitually seek out. I sometimes dropped in to Sinthias\u0027s when I was in the neighborhood because I know the owner fairly well. Fifteen years back I\u0027d had to arrest him for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The minor in question had been seventeen and jaded, and I\u0027d only made the collar because I\u0027d had no choice- the boy\u0027s father had lodged a formal complaint. Kenny\u0027s lawyer had a quiet talk with the boy\u0027s father and gave him an idea what he would bring out in open court, and that was the end of that.\n Over the years Kenny and I had developed a relationship somewhere in the uncertain ground between acquaintance and friendship. He was behind the bar when I walked in, and as always he looked a young twenty-eight years old. His real age must be just about double that, and you have to stand very close to him to spot the face-lift scars. And the carefully combed hair is all Kenny\u0027s own, even if the blond color is a gift from a lady named Clairol.\n He had around fifteen customers. Seeing them one at a time you\u0027d have no cause to suspect they were gay, but collectively their homosexuality became unmistakable, almost a presence in the long narrow room. Perhaps it was their reaction to my intrusion that was palpable. People who spend their lives in any sort of half-world can always recognize a cop, and I still haven\u0027t learned how to avoid looking like one.\n \"Sir Matthew of Scudder,\" Kenny sang out. \"Welcome, welcome as always. The trade around here is rarely quite so rough as your estimable self. Still bourbon, darling? Still neat?\"\n \"Fine, Kenny.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad to see nothing changes. You are a constant in a madcap world.\"\n I took a seat at the bar. The other drinkers had relaxed when Kenny hailed me, which may well be what he\u0027d had in mind in making such a production out of it. He poured quite a lot of bourbon into a glass and set it on the bar in front of me. I drank some of it. Kenny leaned toward me, propping himself up on his elbows. His face was deeply tanned. He spends his summers on Fire Island and uses a sunlamp the rest of the year.\n \"Working, sweets?\"\n \"Yes, as a matter of fact.\"\n He sighed. \"It happens to the best of us. I\u0027ve been back in harness since Labor Day and I\u0027m still not used to it. Such a joy lying in the sun all summer and leaving this place for Alfred to mismanage. You know Alfred?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-16.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) \n Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
