According to the report I saw.\" \"He walked out the door and a late-model car pulled up at the curb and somebody gave him both barrels of a sawed-off shotgun. A school kid said the man with the gun was white but didn\u0027t know about the man in the car, the driver.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"One man\u0027s white and the car\u0027s described as blue and the gun was left at the scene. No prints, I don\u0027t suppose.\" \"Probably not.\" \"No way to trace the sawed-off, I don\u0027t guess.\" \"I haven\u0027t heard, but- \" \"But there won\u0027t be any way to trace it.\" \"Doesn\u0027t figure to be.\" Trina brought the drinks. I picked mine up and said, \"Absent friends, Eddie.\" \"Sure thing.\" \"He wasn\u0027t your friend, and though you may not believe it, he was less my friend than yours, but that\u0027s how we\u0027ll drink the toast, to absent friends. I drank your toast the way you wanted it, so you can drink mine.\" \"Whatever you say.\" \"Absent friends,\" I said. We drank. The booze seemed to have more of a punch after a few days of taking it easy. I certainly hadn\u0027t lost my taste for it, though. It went down nice and easy and made me vitally aware of just who I was. I said, \"You figure they\u0027ll ever find out who did it?\" \"Want a straight answer?\" \"Do you think I want you to lie to me?\" \"No, I don\u0027t figure that.\" \"So?\" \"I don\u0027t suppose they\u0027ll ever find out who did it, Matt.\" \"Will they try?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Would you, if it were your case?\" He looked at me. \"Well, I\u0027ll be perfectly honest with you,\" he said after a moment\u0027s thought. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027d like to think I\u0027d try. I think some- I think, fuck it, I think a couple of our own must of done it. What the hell else can you think, right?\" \"Right.\" \"Whoever did it was a fucking idiot. An absolute fucking idiot who just did the department more harm than Broadfield could ever hope to do. Whoever did it ought to hang by the neck, and I like to think I\u0027d go after the bastards with everything I had if it was my case.\" He lowered his eyes. \"But to be honest, I don\u0027t know if I would. I think I\u0027d go through the motions and sweep it under the rug.\" \"And that\u0027s what they\u0027ll do out in Queens.\" \"I didn\u0027t talk to them. I don\u0027t know for a fact that\u0027s what they\u0027ll do. But I\u0027d be surprised if they did anything else, and so would you.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"What are you going to do, Matt?\" \"Me?\" I stared at him. \"Me? What should I do?\" \"I mean, are you going to try and go after them? Because I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a good idea.\" \"Why should I do that, Eddie?\" I spread my hands palms up. \"He\u0027s not my cousin. And nobody\u0027s hiring me to find out who killed him.\" \"Is that straight?\" \"It\u0027s straight.\" \"You\u0027re hard to figure. I think I got you pegged, and then I don\u0027t.\" He stood up and put some money on the table. \"Let me buy that round,\" he said. \"Stick around, Eddie. Have another drink.\" He hadn\u0027t done more than touch the one he\u0027d had. \"No time,\" he said. \"Matt, you don\u0027t have to crawl into the bottle just because of this. It doesn\u0027t change anything.\" \"It doesn\u0027t?\" \"Hell, no. You still got a life of your own. You got this woman you\u0027re seeing, you got- \" \"No.\" \"Huh?\" \"Maybe I\u0027ll see her again. I don\u0027t know. Probably not. She could have called by this time. And after it happened, you would think she\u0027d have called if it was real.\" \"I don\u0027t follow you.\" But I wasn\u0027t talking to him. \"We were in the right place at the right time,\" I went on. \"So it looked as though we might turn out to be important for each other. If it ever had a chance, I\u0027d say the chance died this morning when the gun went off.\" \"Matt, you\u0027re not making sense.\" \"It makes sense to me. Maybe that\u0027s my fault. We might see each other again, I don\u0027t know. But whether we do or don\u0027t, it\u0027s not going to change anything. People don\u0027t get to change things. Things change people once in a while, but people don\u0027t change things.\" \"I gotta go, Matt. Take it a little easy on the booze, huh?\" \"Sure, Eddie.\" SOMETIME that night I dialed her number in Forest Hills. The phone rang a dozen times before I gave up and got my dime back. I called another number. A leftover voice recited, \"Seven-two-five-five. I am sorry, but no one is at home at the moment. If you will leave your name and number at the sound of the tone, your call will be returned as soon as possible. Thank you.\" The tone sounded, and it was my turn. But I couldn\u0027t seem to think of anything to say.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-23.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
