{"id":97198,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\"You paid me enough.\" \"The hell I did. What\u0027s a man\u0027s life worth?\" I had asked myself the same question often enough, but not in quite the same way. I said, \"I made something like five hundred dollars a day. That\u0027ll do me, Broadfield.\" \"Jerry.\" \"Sure.\" \"And I say you got a bonus coming. You met my lawyer? Seldon Wolk?\" \"We\u0027ve spoken,\" I said. Wolk and I shook hands and made polite sounds at each other. \"Well, it\u0027s about that time,\" Broadfield said. \"I guess any reporters who\u0027re gonna show up are already waiting out there, don\u0027t you think? If any of \u0027em miss out, it\u0027ll teach \u0027em to be on time next shot. Is Diana out there with the car?\" \"She\u0027s waiting where you wanted her to wait,\" the lawyer told him. \"Perfect. You met my wife, didn\u0027t you, Matt? Of course you did, I gave you that note to take out there. What we gotta do, you get a woman, and the four of us\u0027ll have dinner one of these nights. We ought to get to know each other better, all of us.\" \"We\u0027ll have to do that,\" I agreed. \"Well,\" he said. He tore open a manila envelope and shook out its contents on the top of the desk. He put his wallet into his pocket, slipped his watch onto his wrist, scooped up and pocketed a handful of coins. Then he put his tie around his neck and under his shirt collar and made an elaborate performance of tying it. \"Did I tell you, Matt? Thought I might have to tie it twice. But I think the knot looks just about right, don\u0027t you?\" \"It looks fine.\" He nodded. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I think it looks pretty good, all right. I\u0027ll tell you something. Matt, I feel good. How do I look, Seldon?\" \"You look fine.\" \"I feel like a million dollars,\" he said. HE handled the reporters pretty nicely. He answered questions, striking a nice balance between sincere and cocky, and while they still had questions to ask him he flashed the number-one grin, gave a victorious wave, and pushed through them and got into his car. Diana stepped on the gas, and they drove down to the end of the block and turned the corner. I stood there watching until they were out of sight. Of course she\u0027d had to come to pick him up. And she would take it easy for a day or two, and then she\u0027d let him know how things stood. She\u0027d said she didn\u0027t expect much trouble from him. She was certain he didn\u0027t love her and that she had long since ceased to be important in his life. But I was to give her a couple of days, and then she would call. \"Well, that was pretty exciting,\" a voice behind me said. \"I figured maybe we were supposed to throw rice at the happy couple, something like that.\" Without turning I said, \"Hello, Eddie.\" \"Hello, Matt. Beautiful morning, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Not bad.\" \"I suppose you\u0027re feeling pretty good.\" \"Not too bad.\" \"Cigar?\" Lieutenant Eddie Koehler didn\u0027t wait for an answer, put the cigar in his own mouth and lit it. It took him three matches because the wind blew out the first two. \"I oughta get a lighter,\" he said. \"You check out that lighter Broadfield was using before? Looked expensive.\" \"I think it probably is.\" \"Looked like gold to me.\" \"Probably. Though gold and gold plate look pretty much the same.\" \"They don\u0027t cost the same, though. Do they?\" \"Not as a general rule.\" He smiled, swung out a hand, and gripped my upper arm. \"Aw, you son of a bitch,\" he said. \"Lemme buy you a drink, you old son of a bitch.\" \"It\u0027s a little early for me, Eddie. Maybe a cup of coffee.\" \"Even better. Since when is it ever too early to buy you a drink?\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. Maybe I\u0027ll take it a little easier on the booze, see if it makes a difference.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Well, for a while, anyway.\" He eyed me appraisingly. \"You sound like your old self a little, you know that? I can\u0027t remember the last time you sounded like this.\" \"Don\u0027t make too much out of it, Eddie. All I\u0027m doing is passing up a drink.\" \"No, there\u0027s something else. I can\u0027t put my finger on it, but something\u0027s different.\" We went over to a little place on Reade Street and ordered coffee and Danish. He said, \"Well, you sprung the bastard. I hate to see him off the hook, but I can\u0027t hardly hold it against you. You got him off.\" \"He shouldn\u0027t have been on in the first place.\" \"Yeah, well, that\u0027s something else, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Uh-huh. You ought to be glad the way things worked out. He\u0027s not going to be a tremendous amount of use to Abner Prejanian because Prejanian\u0027s going to have to keep a low profile for the next little while. He doesn\u0027t look too good himself now. His assistant just got nailed for killing two people and framing Abner\u0027s star witness. You were complaining that he loved to see his name in the papers. I think he\u0027s going to try to keep his name out of the papers for a couple of months, don\u0027t you?\" \"Could be.\" \"And Knox Hardesty doesn\u0027t look too good, either. He\u0027s all right as far as the public is concerned, but the word\u0027s going to get around that he\u0027s not very good at protecting his witnesses. He had Carr, and Carr gave him Manch, and they\u0027re both dead, and that\u0027s not a good track record to have when you\u0027re trying to get people to cooperate with you.\" \"Of course he hasn\u0027t been bothering the department, anyway, Matt.\" \"Not yet. But with Prejanian quiet he might have wanted to come on in. You know how it goes, Eddie. Whenever they want headlines they take a shot at the cops.\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s the fucking truth.\" \"So I didn\u0027t do so badly by you, did I? The department doesn\u0027t wind up looking bad.\" \"No, you did all right, Matt.\" \"Yeah.\" He picked up his cigar, puffed on it. It had gone out. He lit it again with a match and watched the match burn almost to his fingertips before shaking it out and dropping it into the ashtray. I chewed a bite of Danish and chased it with a gulp of coffee. I could cut down on the drinking. There would be times when it got difficult. When I thought about Fuhrmann and how I could have taken that call from him. Or when I thought about Manch and his plunge to the ground. My phone call couldn\u0027t have done it all by itself. Hardesty had been pressuring him all along, and he\u0027d been carrying a load of guilt for years. But I hadn\u0027t helped him, and maybe if I hadn\u0027t called- Except you can\u0027t let yourself think that way. What you have to do is remind yourself that you caught one murderer and kept one innocent man out of prison. You never win them all, and you can\u0027t blame yourself whenever you drop one. \"Matt?\" I looked at him. \"That conversation we had the other night. At that bar where you hang out?\" \"Armstrong\u0027s.\" \"Right, Armstrong\u0027s. I said some things I didn\u0027t have to say.\" \"Oh, the hell with that, Eddie.\" \"No hard feelings?\" \"Of course not.\" Pause. \"Well, a few guys who knew I was gonna drop down today, which I was doing, figuring you\u0027d be here, they asked me to let you know there\u0027s no hard feelings toward you. Not that there ever was in a general sense, just that they wished you weren\u0027t hooked up with Broadfield at the time, if you get my meaning.\" \"I think I do.\" \"And they hope you got no bad feelings toward the department, is all.\" \"None.\" \"Well, that\u0027s what I figured, but I thought I\u0027d get it out in the open and be sure.\" He ran a hand over his forehead, ruffled his hair. \"You\u0027re really figuring to take it easier on the booze?\" \"Might as well give it a try. Why?\" \"I don\u0027t know. You think maybe you\u0027re ready to rejoin the human race?\" \"I never resigned, did I?\" \"You know what I\u0027m talking about.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. \"You proved something, you know. You\u0027re still a good cop, Matt. It\u0027s what you\u0027re really good at.\" \"So?\" \"It\u0027s easier to be a good cop when you\u0027re carrying a badge.\" \"Sometimes it\u0027s harder. If I\u0027d had a badge this past week, I would have been told to lay off.\" \"Yeah, and you were told that, anyway, and you didn\u0027t listen, and you wouldn\u0027t have listened, badge or no badge. Am I right?\" \"Maybe. I don\u0027t know.\" \"The best way to get a good police department is to keep good policemen in it. I\u0027d like it a hell of a lot to see you back on the force.\" \"I don\u0027t think so, Eddie.\" \"I wasn\u0027t asking you to make a decision. I was saying you could think about it. And you can think it over for the next little while, can\u0027t you? Maybe it\u0027ll be something that starts to make sense when you don\u0027t have a skinful of booze in you twenty-four hours a day.\" \"It\u0027s possible.\" \"You\u0027ll think about it?\" \"I\u0027ll think about it.\" \"Uh-huh.\" He stirred his coffee. \"You hear from your kids lately?\" \"They\u0027re fine.\" \"Well, that\u0027s good.\" \"I\u0027m taking them this Saturday. There\u0027s some kind of father-son thing with their Scout troop, a rubber-chicken dinner and then seats for the Nets game.\" \"I could never get interested in the Nets.\" \"They\u0027re supposed to have a good team.\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s what they tell me. Well, it\u0027s great that you\u0027re seeing them.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Maybe you and Anita- \" \"Drop it, Eddie.\" \"Yeah, I talk too much.\" \"She\u0027s got somebody else, anyway.\" \"You can\u0027t expect her to sit around.\" \"I don\u0027t, and I don\u0027t care. I\u0027ve got somebody else myself.\" \"Oh. For serious?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Something to take it slow and see what happens, I guess.\" \"Something like that.\" THAT was Monday. For the next couple of days I took a lot of long walks and spent time at a lot of churches. I would have a couple of drinks in the evening to make it easier to get to sleep, but to all intents and purposes I wasn\u0027t doing any serious drinking at all. I walked around, I enjoyed the weather, I kept checking my telephone messages, I read the Times in the morning and the Post at night. I began wondering after a while why I wasn\u0027t getting the phone message I was waiting for, but I wasn\u0027t upset enough to pick up the phone and place a call myself. Then Thursday around two in the afternoon I was walking along, not going anywhere in particular, and as I passed a newsstand at the corner of Fifty-seventh and Eighth, I happened to glance at the headline of the Post. I normally waited and bought the late edition, but the headline caught me and I bought the paper. Jerry Broadfield was dead. Chapter 17 When he sat down across from me, I knew who it was without raising my eyes. I said, \"Hi, Eddie.\" \"Figured I\u0027d find you here.\" \"Not hard to guess, was it?\" I waved a hand to signal Trina. \"What is it, Seagram\u0027s? Bring my friend here a Seagram\u0027s and water. I\u0027ll have another of these.\" To him I said, \"It didn\u0027t take you long. I\u0027ve only been here about an hour myself. Of course the news must have hit the street with the noon edition. I just didn\u0027t happen to see a paper until an hour ago. It says here that he got it around eight this morning. Is that right?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-22.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
