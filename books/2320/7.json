{"id":97183,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"I thought about it. \"I could name a dozen names,\" I said. \"And that\u0027s off the top of my head.\"\n \"Right. And if you included ones where you think they\u0027re probably guilty, you could name six dozen. All those guys that Lee Bailey defends and gets off, everybody is always positive the bastards are guilty. More than once I heard cops say So-and-so must be guilty or why would he need Bailey to defend him?\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard the same line.\"\n \"Of course. My lawyer\u0027s supposed to be good, but I need more than a lawyer. Because I want more than acquittal. And I can\u0027t get anything out of the cops. The ones who caught this case love it just the way it is. Nothing makes them happier than seeing me with my head on the block. So why should they look any further? All they\u0027ll look for is more ways to nail me to the wall. And if they find anything that hurts their case, you can guess what they\u0027ll do with it. They\u0027ll bury it so deep it\u0027d be easier to reach if you started digging in China.\"\n WE went over a few more things and I wrote down various items in my notebook. I got his home address in Forest Hills, his wife\u0027s name, the name of his lawyer, and other bits and pieces. He took a blank sheet of paper from my notebook, borrowed my pen, and wrote out an authorization for his wife to give me twenty-five hundred dollars.\n \"In cash, Matt. And there\u0027s more money if that\u0027s not enough. Spend what you have to. I\u0027ll back you all the way. Just fix it so I can put that tie on and get the hell out of here.\"\n \"Where does all the money come from?\"\n He looked at me. \"Does it matter?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"What the fuck am I supposed to say? That I saved it out of my salary? You know better than that. I already told you I was never a Boy Scout.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"Does it matter where the money came from?\"\n I thought about it. \"No,\" I said. \"No, I don\u0027t guess it does.\"\n ON our way back through the corridors the guard said, \"You were a cop yourself, right?\"\n \"For a while.\"\n \"And now you\u0027re working for him.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"Well,\" he said judiciously, \"we don\u0027t always get to choose who we\u0027re gonna work for. And a man\u0027s got to make hisself a living.\"\n \"That\u0027s the truth.\"\n He whistled softly. He was in his late fifties, jowly and round-shouldered, with liver spots on the backs of his hands. His voice had been roughened by years of whiskey and tobacco.\n \"Figure to get him off?\"\n \"I\u0027m no lawyer. If I can turn up some evidence, maybe his lawyer can get him off. Why?\"\n \"Just thinking. If he don\u0027t get off, he\u0027s apt to wish they still had capital punishment.\"\n \"Why\u0027s that?\"\n \"He\u0027s a cop, ain\u0027t he?\"\n \"So?\"\n \"Well, you just think on it. The present time, we got him in a cell by his lonesome. Awaiting trial and all of that, wearin\u0027 his own clothes, keepin\u0027 to hisself. But let\u0027s just say he\u0027s convicted and he\u0027s sent up to, say, Attica. And there he is in a prison full to overflowing with criminals who got no use at all for the police, and better\u0027n half of \u0027em coons who was born hating the police. Now there is all kinds of ways to do time, but do you know any harder time than that poor bastard is going to serve?\"\n \"I hadn\u0027t thought of that.\"\n The guard clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth. \"Why, he\u0027ll never have a minute when he won\u0027t have to be worryin\u0027 about some black bastard comin\u0027 at him with a homemade knife. They steal spoons from the mess hall and grind \u0027em down in the machine shop, you know. I worked Attica some years ago, I know how they do things there. You recall the big riot? When they seized the hostages and all? I was long out of there by that time, but I knew two of the guards who was taken as hostages and killed. That\u0027s a hell of a place, that Attica. Your buddy Broadfield gets hisself sent there, I\u0027d say he\u0027s lucky if he\u0027s alive after two years.\"\n We walked the rest of the way in silence. As he was about to leave me he said, \"Hardest kind of time in the world is the time a cop serves in a prison. But I got to say the bastard deserves it if anybody does.\"\n \"Maybe he didn\u0027t kill the girl.\"\n \"Oh, shoot,\" he said. \"Who cares a damn if he killed her? He went and turned on his own kind, didn\u0027t he? He\u0027s a traitor to his badge, ain\u0027t he? I don\u0027t care a damn about some filthy prostitute and who killed her or didn\u0027t kill her. That bastard in there deserves whatever he gets.\"\n Chapter 5\n I went there first because of the location. The Tombs is on White at Centre, and Abner Prejanian and his eager beavers had a suite of offices four blocks away on Worth between Church and Broadway. The building was a narrow yellow brickfront which Prejanian shared with a couple of accountants, a photocopying service, some import-export people, and, on the ground floor, a shop that repaired shoes and reblocked hats. I climbed steep stairs that squeaked, and too many of them; if he\u0027d been a flight higher I might have given up and turned around. But I got to his floor and a door was open and I walked in.\n On Tuesday, after my first meeting with Jerry Broadfield, I had spent almost two dollars\u0027 worth of dimes trying to reach Portia Carr. Not all at once, of course, but a dime at a time. She had had an answering machine, and when you reach an answering machine from a public phone you usually lose your dime. If you hang up fast enough, and if you\u0027re lucky and your reflexes are good, you get your dime back. As the day wears on, this happens less and less frequently.\n When I wasn\u0027t wasting dimes that day I tried a few other approaches, and one of them involved a girl named Elaine Mardell. She was in the same line of work as Portia Carr and lived in the same neighborhood. I went over to see Elaine, and she managed to tell me a few things about Portia. Nothing firsthand- she hadn\u0027t known her personally- but some gossip she had heard at one time or other. That Portia had specialized in SM fantasy fulfillment, that she was supposedly turning down dates lately, and that she had a \"special friend\" who was prominent or notorious or influential or something.\n The girl in Prejanian\u0027s office looked enough like Elaine to be her sister. She frowned at me and I realized that I was staring at her. A second glance showed me that she didn\u0027t really resemble Elaine that closely. The similarity was mostly in the eyes. She had the same dark deep-set Jewish eyes and they dominated her entire face in much the same way.\n She asked if she could help me. I said I wanted to see Mr. Prejanian and she asked if I had an appointment. I admitted I didn\u0027t, and she said he was out to lunch, as was most of his staff. I decided not to assume she was a secretary just because she was a woman, and started to tell her what I wanted.\n \"I\u0027m just a secretary,\" she said. \"Do you want to wait until Mr. Prejanian gets back? Or there\u0027s Mr. Lorbeer. I believe he\u0027s in his office.\"\n \"Who\u0027s Mr. Lorbeer?\"\n \"Staff assistant to Mr. Prejanian.\"\n That still didn\u0027t tell me a great deal, but I asked to see him. She invited me to have a seat, pointing to a wooden folding chair that looked about as inviting as the bed in Broadfield\u0027s cell. I stayed on my feet.\n A few minutes later I was sitting across an old oak veneer desk from Claude Lorbeer. When I was a kid, every schoolroom I was ever in had a desk just like that for the teacher. I\u0027d had only female teachers except for gym and shop, but if I\u0027d had a male classroom teacher he might have looked something like Lorbeer, who certainly looked at home behind that desk. He had short, dark brown hair and a narrow mouth with deeply etched lines like paired parentheses on either side of it. His hands were plump with short, stubby fingers. They were pale and looked soft. He wore a white shirt and a solid maroon tie and he had his shirt-sleeves rolled up. Something about him made me feel as though I must have done something wrong, and that my not knowing what it might be was no excuse at all.\n \"Mr. Scudder,\" he said. \"I suppose you\u0027re the officer I spoke to over the telephone this morning. I can only repeat what I said earlier. Mr. Prejanian has no information to make available to the police. Any criminous action which Mr. Broadfield may have performed is beyond the scope of this investigation and surely not in any way known to this office. We have not yet spoken to members of the press but will of course take the same tack with them. We will decline to comment and will stress that Mr. Broadfield had volunteered to make certain information available to us but that we had taken no action in respect to information furnished by him nor do we anticipate so doing while Mr. Broadfield\u0027s legal status is undefined as it is at present.\"\n He said all of this as though he was reading it from a prepared text. Most people have trouble speaking in sentences. Lorbeer spoke in paragraphs, structurally complicated paragraphs, and he delivered his little speech with his pale eyes fixed on the tip of my left shoulder.\n I said, \"I think you\u0027ve jumped to a conclusion. I\u0027m not a cop.\"\n \"You\u0027re from the press? I thought- \"\n \"I used to be a cop. I left the force a couple of years ago.\"\n His face took on an interesting cast at this news. There was some calculation in it. I got a rush of dйjа vu looking at him, and it took me a minute to put it in place. He reminded me of Broadfield at our first meeting, head cocked to the side and face screwed up in concentration. Like Broadfield, Lorbeer wanted to know what my angle was. He might be a reformer, he might be working for Mr. Clean himself, but in his own way he was as much on the make as a cop looking for a handout.\n \"I\u0027ve just been to see Broadfield,\" I said. \"I\u0027m working for him. He says he didn\u0027t kill the Carr woman.\"\n \"Naturally he\u0027d say that, wouldn\u0027t he? I understand her body was found in his apartment.\"\n I nodded. \"He figures he was deliberately framed for her murder. He wants me to try and find out who framed him.\"\n \"I see.\" He was somewhat less interested in me now since I was just trying to solve a murder. He\u0027d been hoping I was going to help him louse up an entire police department. \"Well. I\u0027m not certain how our office would be involved.\"\n \"Maybe you\u0027re not. I just want a fuller picture. I don\u0027t know Broadfield well, I just met him the first time Tuesday. He\u0027s a tricky customer. I can\u0027t always tell when he\u0027s lying to me.\"\n A trace of a smile appeared on Claude Lorbeer\u0027s lips. It looked out of place there. \"I like the way you put it,\" he said. \"He is a subtle liar, isn\u0027t he?\"\n \"That\u0027s what\u0027s hard to tell. How subtle is he, and how much does he lie? He says he just came over and volunteered his services to you people. That you didn\u0027t have to force him into it.\"\n \"That\u0027s quite true.\"\n \"It\u0027s hard to believe.\"\n Lorbeer made a tent of his fingertips. \"No harder for you than for us,\" he said. \"Broadfield just walked in off the street. He didn\u0027t even call first to tell us he was coming. We\u0027d never heard of him before he barged in offering us the earth and asking nothing in return.\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\n \"I know it.\" He leaned forward, his expression one of great concentration. I suppose he was about twenty-eight. His manner put extra years on him, but when he grew intense those years dropped away and you realized how young he was underneath it all. \"That\u0027s what makes it so difficult to place credence in anything the man says, Mr. Scudder. One can see no possible motivation for him. Oh, he asked for immunity from prosecution for anything he might disclose that implicated himself, but we grant that automatically. But he didn\u0027t want anything beyond that.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-7.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) \n Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
