{"id":97191,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"That Special Prosecutor chap. It wasn\u0027t hard to tell what Knox Hardesty thought of Abner L. Prejanian.\\n\\n I said, \"Did it bother you that he went to Prejanian?\"\\n\\n \"Why on earth should it bother me?\"\\n\\n I shrugged. \"Prejanian started to get a lot of ink. The papers gave him a nice play.\"\\n\\n \"More power to him if publicity is what he wants. It seems rather to have backfired on him now, though. Wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\\n\\n \"And that must please you.\"\\n\\n \"It confirms my judgment, but aside from that why should it please me?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you and Prejanian are rivals, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027d hardly put it that way.\"\\n\\n \"No? I thought you were. I figured that\u0027s why you got her to accuse Broadfield of extortion.\"\\n\\n \"What!\"\\n\\n \"Why else would you do it?\" I made my tone deliberately offhand, not accusing him but taking it for granted that it was something we both knew and acknowledged. \"Once she was pressing charges against him he was defused and Prejanian didn\u0027t even hear his name mentioned. And it made Prejanian look gullible for having used Broadfield in the first place.\"\\n\\n His grandfather or great-grandfather might have lost control. But Hardesty had enough generations of good breeding behind him so that he was able to keep almost all of his cool. He straightened in his chair, but that was about the extent of it. \"You\u0027ve been misinformed,\" he told me.\\n\\n \"The charge wasn\u0027t Portia\u0027s idea.\"\\n\\n \"Nor was it mine.\"\\n\\n \"Then why did she call you around noon the day before yesterday? She wanted your advice, and you told her to go on acting as if the charge was true. Why did she call you? And why did you tell her that?\"\\n\\n No indignation this time. A little stalling- picking up the glass of milk, putting it down untasted, fussing with a paperweight and a letter opener. Then he looked at me and asked how I knew she\u0027d called him.\\n\\n \"I was there.\"\\n\\n \"You were- \" His eyes widened. \"You were the man who wanted to talk with her. But I thought- then you were working for Broadfield before the murder.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"For heaven\u0027s sake. I thought- well, obviously I thought you\u0027d been engaged after he was arrested for homicide. Hmmm. So you were the man she was so nervous about. But I spoke to her before she had met you. She didn\u0027t even know your name when we talked. How did you know- she didn\u0027t tell you, that\u0027s the last thing she would have done. Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake. That was a bluff, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"You could call it an educated guess.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d just as soon call it a bluff. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d care to play poker with you, Mr. Scudder. Yes, she called me- I might as well admit it since it\u0027s fairly obvious. And I told her to insist that the charge was true, although I knew it wasn\u0027t. But I didn\u0027t put her up to making the charge in the first place.\"\\n\\n \"Then who did?\"\\n\\n \"Some policemen. I don\u0027t know their names, and I\u0027m not inclined to think Miss Carr did. She said she didn\u0027t, and it\u0027s likely she\u0027d have been open with me on that subject. You see, she hadn\u0027t wanted to press those charges. If there was a chance I could have gotten her off that hook, she\u0027d have done what she could.\" He smiled. \"You may think I had reason to cast a pall on Mr. Prejanian\u0027s investigation. While I\u0027m not saddened by the spectacle of that man with egg on his face, I\u0027d never have taken the trouble to put it there. Certain policemen, however, had a much stronger motive for sabotaging that inquiry.\"\\n\\n \"What did they have on Carr?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Prostitutes are always vulnerable, of course, but- \"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, this is just intuitive on my part. I had the impression that they were threatening her not with the law but with some extralegal punishment. I believe she was physically afraid of them.\"\\n\\n I nodded. That checked out with the vibrations I\u0027d picked up at my own meeting with Portia Carr. She hadn\u0027t acted like someone afraid of deportation or arrest, but like someone worried about being beaten up or killed. Someone worried because it was October and she was waiting for winter.\\n\\n Chapter 10\\n\\n Elaine lived just three blocks from where Portia Carr had lived. Her building was on Fifty-first between First and Second. The doorman checked me on the intercom and motioned me on through. By the time the elevator got me to the ninth floor, Elaine was waiting in her open doorway.\\n\\n I decided she looked a lot better than Prejanian\u0027s secretary. I suppose she\u0027s around thirty by now. She has always looked younger than her years and she has a face full of good bones that will age well. Her softness contrasted dramatically with the stark, modern feel of her apartment. She had the place carpeted in white shag, and the furniture was all angles and geometric planes and primary colors. I don\u0027t ordinarily like rooms done that way, but somehow her place worked for me. She\u0027d told me once that she had done her own decorating.\\n\\n We kissed each other like the old friends we were. Then she gripped my elbows and leaned backward. \"Secret Agent Mardell reporting,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not to be taken lightly, man. This camera of mine just looks like a camera. It\u0027s actually a tie clip.\"\\n\\n \"I think that\u0027s backward.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I certainly hope so.\" She turned, flounced away. \"Actually I haven\u0027t found out a hell of a lot. You want to know what prominent people were in her book, is that right?\"\\n\\n \"Especially if they\u0027re politically prominent.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I meant. Everybody I asked kept coming up with the same three or four names. Actors, a couple of musicians. Honestly, some call girls are as bad as groupies. Boasting like any other celebrity-fuckers.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the second person today to tell me call girls don\u0027t keep everything confidential.\"\\n\\n \"Ha! Your average hooker isn\u0027t exactly Stella Stable, Matt. Of course I\u0027m the winner of the Miss Mental Health contest.\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely.\"\\n\\n \"If she didn\u0027t mention what politicians were in her book, it\u0027s probably because she wasn\u0027t that proud of them. If she\u0027d been fucking the governor or a U.S. senator, people would have heard about it, but if it\u0027s somebody local, who cares? What\u0027s the matter?\"\\n\\n \"Politicians would probably be sad to learn that they\u0027re not so important.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027d positively shit, wouldn\u0027t they?\" She lit a cigarette. \"What you ought to have is her john book. Even if she had the brains to code it, you\u0027d have the phone numbers and you can work backward from there.\"\\n\\n \"Is yours in code?\"\\n\\n \"The names and the numbers, sugar.\" She smiled triumphantly. \"Anybody who steals my book steals trash, just like Othello\u0027s purse. But that\u0027s because I\u0027m Brenda Brilliant. Could you get your hands on Portia\u0027s book?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I\u0027m sure the cops have tossed her place. And if she had a book, they found it- and tossed it. In the river. They don\u0027t want any loose ends that might give Broadfield\u0027s lawyer an opening. They want him drawn and quartered, and the only way they\u0027d leave her book around is if Broadfield\u0027s name was the only one in it.\"\\n\\n \"Who do you figure killed her, Matt? Some cops?\"\\n\\n \"People keep suggesting it. Mabye I\u0027ve been off the force too long. I have trouble believing that police officers would actually murder some innocent hooker just to frame someone else.\"\\n\\n She opened her mouth, then closed it.\\n\\n \"Something?\"\\n\\n \"Well, maybe you\u0027ve been off the force too long.\" She looked about to say something else, then gave her head a quick shake. \"I think I\u0027ll make myself a cup of tea. I\u0027m a rotten hostess. A drink? I\u0027m out of bourbon, but there\u0027s Scotch.\"\\n\\n It was time. \"A small one, straight.\"\\n\\n \"Coming right up.\"\\n\\n While she was in the kitchen I thought about the relationship of cops and whores, and the relationship of Elaine and myself. I had gotten to know her a couple of years before I left the police department. Our first meeting was social, though I do not remember the precise circumstances. I believe we were introduced by a mutual friend at some restaurant or other, but we may have met at a party. I don\u0027t remember.\\n\\n It\u0027s useful for a hooker to have a cop with whom she\u0027s on particularly good terms. He can smooth things out if a brother officer is giving her a hard time. He can furnish her with a brand of reality-oriented legal advice that is often more useful then the advice she would get from a lawyer. And she reciprocates for all of this, of course, as women have always reciprocated for the favors men do for them.\\n\\n So I spent a couple of years on Elaine Mardell\u0027s free list, and I was the person she called when the walls started coming together around her. Neither of us abused the privilege. I would see her once in a while if I happened to be in the neighborhood, and she called me perhaps half a dozen times all told.\\n\\n Then I left the force, and for a period of several months I wasn\u0027t interested in any human contact, least of all sexual contact. Then one day I was, and I called Elaine and went over to see her. She never mentioned that I wasn\u0027t a cop anymore and that our relationship was thus due to change. If she had, I probably wouldn\u0027t have wanted to see her again. But on the way out I put some money on the coffee table, and she said she hoped she\u0027d see me again soon, and every now and then she does.\\n\\n I suppose our original relationship had constituted a form of police corruption. I hadn\u0027t been acting as Elaine\u0027s protector, nor had it been my job to arrest her. But I had seen her on the city\u0027s time, and it had been my official position that earned me the right to share her bed. Corruption, I suppose.\\n\\n She brought me my drink, a juice glass with around three ounces of Scotch in it, and sat down on the couch with a cup of tea with milk. She curled her legs under her compact little behind and stirred her tea with a demitasse spoon.\\n\\n \"Beautiful weather,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Uh-huh.\"\\n\\n \"I wish I was closer to the park. I take long walks every morning. Days like this I\u0027d like to take my walks in the park.\"\\n\\n \"You take long walks every morning?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. It\u0027s good for you. Why?\"\\n\\n \"I figured you\u0027d sleep until noon.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no. I\u0027m an early riser. And I\u0027ll get visitors from noon on, of course. And I can get to sleep early because it\u0027s rare I have anyone here after ten o\u0027clock at night.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s funny. You think of it as a business for night people.\"\\n\\n \"Except it\u0027s not. The guys, you know, they have to get home to their families. I\u0027d say from noon to six-thirty is maybe ninety percent of the people I see.\"\\n\\n \"Makes sense.\"\\n\\n \"I got somebody coming in a while, Matt, but we got time if you feel like it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d better take a raincheck.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s cool.\"\\n\\n I drank some of my drink. \"Back to Portia Carr,\" I said. \"You didn\u0027t come up with anybody who might have had some kind of a government connection?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I might have.\" My face must have changed expression because she said, \"No, I\u0027m not hustling you, for God\u0027s sake. I learned a name, but I don\u0027t know if I got it right and I don\u0027t know who it is.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the name?\"\\n\\n \"Something like Mantz or Manch or Manns. I don\u0027t know it exactly. I know he\u0027s somebody connected to the mayor, but I don\u0027t know what. At least that\u0027s the story I got. Don\u0027t ask me the guy\u0027s first name because nobody knows. Does that give you anything? Manns or Mantz or Manch or something like that?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-15.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) \\n Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
