{"id":97195,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\"Could you stop drinking? Or cut down?\" \"Probably. If I had a reason.\" The waitress brought our appetizers. I ordered a carafe of red wine. Diana impaled a mussel with a little fork, paused with it halfway to her mouth. \"Maybe we shouldn\u0027t talk about this yet.\" \"Maybe not.\" \"I think we feel the same about most things. I think what we want is the same, and I think our fears are the same.\" \"Or pretty close, at least.\" \"Yes. Maybe you\u0027re no bargain, Matthew. I think that\u0027s what you\u0027ve been trying to tell me. I\u0027m no bargain myself. I don\u0027t drink, but I might as well. I just found a different way to retire from the human race. I gave up being me. I feel- \" \"Yes?\" \"As if I\u0027ve got a second chance. As if I had that chance all along, but you only have it when you know you have it. And I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re a part of that chance or if you just made me aware of it.\" She put her fork on her plate, the mussel still gripped by the tines. \"Oh, I\u0027m enormously confused. All the magazines tell me I\u0027m just the right age for an identity crisis. Is that what this is or am I falling in love and how do you tell the difference? Do you have a cigarette?\" \"I\u0027ll get some. What brand do you smoke?\" \"I don\u0027t smoke. Oh, any brand. Winstons, I guess.\" I got a pack from the machine. I opened it, gave her a cigarette, took one for myself. I struck a match and her fingers fastened around my wrist as she got her cigarette going. The tips of her fingers were very cool. She said, \"I have three young children. I have a husband in jail.\" \"And you\u0027re taking up drinking and smoking. You\u0027re a mess, all right.\" \"And you\u0027re a sweet man. Have I told you that before? It\u0027s still true.\" I saw to it that she had most of the wine with dinner. Afterward she had a pot of espresso and a little snifter of brandy. I went back to coffee and bourbon. We did a lot of talking and shared a lot of long silences. These last were as communicative in their own way as our conversations. It was close to midnight when I settled the tab. They were anxious to close, but our waitress had been very decent about letting us alone. I showed my appreciation of her forbearance with a tip that was probably excessive. I didn\u0027t care. I loved the whole world. We went out and stood on Ninth Avenue drinking the cold air. She discovered the moon and shared it with me. \"It\u0027s almost full. Isn\u0027t it beautiful?\" \"Yes.\" \"Sometimes I think I can almost feel the pull of the moon. Silly, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I don\u0027t know. The sea feels it. That\u0027s why there are tides. And there\u0027s no denying that the moon influences human behavior. All cops know that. The crime rate changes with the moon.\" \"Honest?\" \"Uh-huh. Especially the weird crimes. The full moon makes people do odd things.\" \"Like what?\" \"Like kissing in public.\" A little later she said, \"Well, I don\u0027t know that that\u0027s odd. I think it\u0027s nice, actually.\" AT Armstrong\u0027s I ordered coffee and bourbon for both of us. \"Because I like the feeling I\u0027m getting Matthew, but I don\u0027t want to get sleepy. And I liked the way it tasted the other day.\" When she brought the drinks, Trina handed me a slip of paper. \"He was in about an hour ago,\" she said. \"Before then he called a couple of times. He\u0027s very anxious for you to get in touch with him.\" \"I unfolded the slip of paper. Doug Fuhrmann\u0027s name and a telephone number. I said, \"Thanks. It\u0027s nothing that can\u0027t wait until morning.\" \"He said it was urgent.\" \"Well, that\u0027s one man\u0027s opinion.\" Diana and I poured our bourbon into our coffee, and she asked me what it was about. \"A guy who\u0027s been close to your husband,\" I said. \"He was also getting close to the girl who was murdered. I think I know why, but I want to talk to him about it.\" \"Do you want to call him? Or see him for a while? Don\u0027t pass him up on my account, Matthew.\" \"He can wait.\" \"If you think it\u0027s important- \" \"It\u0027s not. He can wait until tomorrow.\" Evidently Fuhrmann didn\u0027t think so. A little later the phone rang. Trina answered it and made her way to our table. \"Same caller,\" she said. \"Do you want to talk to him?\" I shook my head. \"I was in,\" I said. \"I got his message and said something about calling him in the morning. And then I had a drink and left.\" \"Gotcha.\" Ten or twenty minutes later we did leave. Esteban was swinging the midnight-to-eight shift at the desk of my hotel. He gave me three messages, all of them from Fuhrmann. \"No calls,\" I told him. \"No matter who. I\u0027m not in.\" \"Right.\" \"If the phone rings I\u0027ll figure the building\u0027s on fire because otherwise I don\u0027t want any calls.\" \"I understand.\" We rode up in the elevator, walked down the hallway to my door. I opened it and stood aside to let her in. With her at my side the little room looked starker and more barren than ever. \"I thought of other places we could go,\" I told her. \"A better hotel or a friend\u0027s apartment, but I decided that I wanted you to see where I live.\" \"I\u0027m glad, Matthew.\" \"Is it all right?\" \"Of course it\u0027s all right.\" We kissed. We held each other for a long time. I smelled her perfume and tasted the sweetness of her mouth. After a time I released her. She moved slowly and deliberately around my room, examining things, getting a sense of the place. Then she turned to me and smiled a very gentle smile, and we began undressing. Chapter 14 All through the night one of us would wake and awaken the other. Then I woke up for the last time and found I was alone. Pale sunlight filtered by bad air gave the room a golden cast. I got out of bed and picked my watch up from the bedside table. It was almost noon. I had almost finished dressing when I found her note. It was wedged between the glass and the frame of the mirror over my dresser. Her handwriting was very neat and quite small. I read: Darling- What is it that the children say? Last night was the first night of the rest of my life. I have so much to say, but I am in no condition to express my thoughts well. Please call me. And call me, please, Your Lady I read it through a couple of times. Then I folded it carefully and tucked it into my wallet. There was a single message in my box. Fuhrmann had called a final time around one-thirty. Then he had evidently given up and gone to sleep. I called him from the lobby and got a busy signal. I went out and had some breakfast. The air, which had looked to be polluted from my window, tasted clean enough on the street. Maybe it was my mood. I hadn\u0027t felt this well in a long time. I got up from the table again and called Fuhrmann again after my second cup of coffee. The line was still busy. I went back and had a third cup and smoked one of the cigarettes I had bought for Diana. She had had three or four the previous night, and I had smoked one each time she did. I burned up about half of this one, left the pack on the table, tried Fuhrmann a third time, paid my check, and walked over to Armstrong\u0027s just to check if he was there or had been in yet. He wasn\u0027t and hadn\u0027t. Something hovered on the edge of consciousness, whining plaintively at me. I used the pay phone at Armstrong\u0027s to call him again. The same busy signal, and it sounded different to me from the usual sort of busy signal. I called the operator and told her I wanted to know if a certain number was engaged or if the telephone was simply off the hook. I got a girl who evidently didn\u0027t speak much English and wasn\u0027t sure how to perform the task I\u0027d asked of her. She offered to put me in touch with her supervisor, but I was only half a dozen blocks from Fuhrmann\u0027s place, so I told her not to bother. I was quite calm when I set out for his place and extremely anxious by the time I got there. Maybe I was picking up signals and they were coming in stronger as the distance decreased. But for one reason or another I didn\u0027t ring the bell in his vestibule. I looked inside and saw no one around, and then I used my piece of celluloid to slip the lock. I climbed the stairs to the top floor without running into anyone. The building was absolutely silent. I went to Fuhrmann\u0027s door and knocked on it, called his name, knocked again. Nothing. I took out my strip of celluloid and looked at it and at the door. I thought about the burglar alarm. If it was going to go off I wanted to have the door open by the time it began to make noises so I could get the hell out of there. Which ruled out slipping the bolt back. Subtlety has its uses, but sometimes brute force is called for. I kicked the door in. It only took one kick because the dead bolt had not been set. You need the key to set the dead bolt, just as you need a key to set the alarm, and the person who had last left Fuhrmann\u0027s apartment had not had those keys or had not troubled to use them. So the alarm did not go off, which was all to the good, but that was all the good news I was going to get. The bad news was waiting for me inside, but I\u0027d known what it would be from the instant the alarm had failed to sound. In a sense I\u0027d known before I even reached the building but that was instinctive knowledge, and when the alarm stayed quiet it became deductive knowledge, and now that I could see him it was just cold, hard fact. He was dead. He was lying on the floor in front of his desk, and it looked as though he had been leaning over his desk when his killer took him. I didn\u0027t have to touch him to know he was dead. The left rear portion of his skull was pulped, and the room itself reeked of death. Dead colons and bladders divest themselves of their contents. Corpses, before the working of the undertaker\u0027s art, smell as foul as the death that grips them. I touched him anyway to guess how long he\u0027d been dead. But his flesh was cold, so I could only know that he\u0027d been dead a minimum of five or six hours. I\u0027d never bothered to pick up much knowledge of forensic medicine. The lab boys handle that area, and they\u0027re reasonably good at it, if not half so good as they like to pretend. I went over to the door and closed it. The lock was useless, but there was a plate for a police lock on the floor, and I found the steel bar and set it in place. I didn\u0027t intend to stay long but wanted no interruptions while I was there. The phone was off the hook. There were no other signs of a struggle, so I assumed the killer had taken the phone off the hook to retard discovery of the body. If he was that cute, there weren\u0027t going to be any prints around, but I still took the trouble not to add any of my own or smear any that he might inadvertently have made. When had he been killed? The bed was unmade, but perhaps he didn\u0027t make it every day. Men who live alone often don\u0027t. Had it been made up when I\u0027d visited him? I thought about it and decided I couldn\u0027t be certain one way or the other. I recalled an impression of neatness and precision, which suggested it had indeed been made up, but there was also an impression of comfort, which would mesh well enough with an unmade bed. The more I thought about it, the more I decided it didn\u0027t make any difference one way or the other. The medical examiner would fix the time of death, and I was in no rush to know what I would learn from him soon enough. So I sat on the edge of the bed and looked at Doug Fuhrmann and tried to remember the precise sound of his voice and the way his face had looked.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-19.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
