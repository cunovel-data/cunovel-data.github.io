You gave me a fright, you know. I don\u0027t know what you want or why you\u0027re here. Or who you are, for that matter. I seem to have forgotten your name already.\" I supplied it. \"Matthew,\" she said. \"I do not know why you are here, Matthew.\" \"Who did you phone from the coffee shop?\" \"You were there? I didn\u0027t notice you.\" \"Who did you call?\" She bought time by puffing on her cigar. Her eyes grew thoughtful. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to tell you,\" she said at length. \"Why are you pressing charges against Jerry Broadfield?\" \"For extortion.\" \"Why, Miss Carr?\" \"You called me Portia before. Or was that just for shock value? The peelers always call you by your first name. That\u0027s to show their contempt for you, it\u0027s supposed to give them some sort of psychological advantage, isn\u0027t it?\" She pointed at me with her cigar. \"You. You\u0027re not a policeman, are you?\" \"No.\" \"But there\u0027s something about you.\" \"I used to be a cop.\" \"Ah.\" She nodded, satisfied. \"And you knew Jerry when you were a policeman?\" \"I didn\u0027t know him then.\" \"But you know him now.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"And you\u0027re a friend of his? No, that\u0027s not possible. Jerry doesn\u0027t have friends, does he?\" \"Doesn\u0027t he?\" \"Hardly. You\u0027d know that if you knew him well.\" \"I don\u0027t know him well.\" \"I wonder if anyone does.\" Another puff on the cigar, a careful flicking of ash into a sculptured glass ashtray. \"Jerry Broadfield has acquaintances. Any number of acquaintances. But I doubt he has a friend in the world.\" \"You\u0027re certainly not his friend.\" \"I never said I was.\" \"Why charge him with extortion?\" \"Because the charge is true.\" She managed a small smile. \"He insisted I give him money. A hundred dollars a week or he would make trouble for me. Prostitutes are vulnerable creatures, you know. And a hundred dollars a week isn\u0027t so terribly much when you consider the enormous sums men are willing to pay to go to bed with one.\" She gestured with her hands, indicating her body. \"So I paid him,\" she said. \"The money he asked for, and I made myself available to him sexually.\" \"For how long?\" \"About an hour at a time, generally. Why?\" \"For how long had you been paying him?\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. About a year, I suppose.\" \"And you\u0027ve been in this country how long?\" \"Just over three years.\" \"And you don\u0027t want to go back, do you?\" I got to my feet, walked over to the couch. \"That\u0027s probably how they set the hook,\" I said. \"Play the game their way or they\u0027ll get you deported as an undesirable alien. Is that how they pitched you?\" \"What a phrase. An undesirable alien.\" \"Is that what they- \" \"Most people consider me a highly desirable alien.\" The cold eyes challenged me. \"I don\u0027t suppose you have an opinion on the subject?\" She was getting to me, and it bothered the hell out of me. I didn\u0027t much like her, so why should she be getting to me? I remembered something Elaine Mardell had said to the effect that a large portion of Portia Carr\u0027s client list consisted of masochists. I have never really understood what gets a masochist off, but a few minutes in her presence was enough to make me realize that a masochist would find this particular woman a perfect component for his fantasies. And, in a somewhat different way, she fit nicely into my own. We went around and around for a while. She kept insisting that Broadfield had really been extorting cash from her, and I kept trying to get past that to the person who had induced her to do the job on him. We weren\u0027t getting anywhere- that is, I wasn\u0027t getting anywhere, and she didn\u0027t have anyplace to get to. So I said, \"Look, when you come right down to it, it doesn\u0027t matter at all. It doesn\u0027t matter whether he was getting money from you, and it doesn\u0027t matter who got you to press charges against him.\" \"Then why are you here, angel? Just for love?\" \"What matters is what it\u0027ll take to get you to drop the charges.\" \"What\u0027s the hurry?\" She smiled. \"Jerry hasn\u0027t even been arrested yet, has he?\" \"You\u0027re not going to take it all the way to the courtroom,\" I went on. \"You\u0027d need proof to get an indictment, and if you had any it would have come out by now. So this is just a smear, but it\u0027s an awkward smear for him and he\u0027d like to wipe it up. What does it take to get the charges dropped?\" \"Jerry must know that.\" \"Oh?\" \"All he has to do is stop doing what he\u0027s been doing.\" \"You mean with Prejanian.\" \"Do I?\" She had finished her cigar, and now she took another from the teak box. But she didn\u0027t light it, just played with it. \"Maybe I don\u0027t mean anything. But look at the record. That\u0027s an Americanism I rather like. Let us look at the record. For all these years Jerry has been doing nicely as a policeman. He has his charming little house in Forest Hills and his charming wife and his charming children. Have you met his wife and children?\" \"No.\" \"Neither have I, but I\u0027ve seen their pictures. American men are extraordinary. First they show one pictures of their wives and children, and then they want to go to bed. Are you married?\" \"Not anymore.\" \"Did you play around when you were?\" \"Now and then.\" \"But you didn\u0027t show pictures around, did you?\" I shook my head. \"Somehow I didn\u0027t think so.\" She returned the cigar to the box, straightened up, yawned. \"He had all that, at any rate, and then he went to this Special Prosecutor with this long story about police corruption, and he began giving interviews to the newspapers, and he took a leave of absence from the police force, and all of a sudden he\u0027s in trouble and accused of shaking down a poor little whore for a hundred dollars a week. It makes you wonder, doesn\u0027t it?\" \"That\u0027s what he has to do? Drop Prejanian and you\u0027ll drop the charges?\" \"I didn\u0027t come right out and say that, did I? And anyway, he must have known that without your digging around. I mean, it\u0027s rather obvious, wouldn\u0027t you say?\" We went around a little more and didn\u0027t accomplish a thing. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d hoped to accomplish or why I had taken five hundred dollars from Broadfield in the first place. Someone had Portia Carr intimidated a lot more seriously than I was likely to manage, for all my cleverness in sneaking into her apartment. In the meantime we were talking pointlessly, and we were both aware of the pointlessness of it. \"This is silly,\" she said at one point. \"I am going to have another drink. Will you join me?\" I wanted a drink badly. \"I\u0027ll pass,\" I said. She brushed me on the way to the kitchen. I got a strong whiff of a perfume I didn\u0027t recognize. I decided I would know it the next time I smelled it. She came back with a drink in her hand and sat on the couch again. \"Silly,\" she said again. \"Why don\u0027t you come sit next to me and we will talk of something else. Or of nothing at all.\" \"You could be in trouble, Portia.\" Her face showed alarm. \"You mustn\u0027t say that.\" \"You\u0027re putting yourself right in the middle. You\u0027re a big strong girl, but you might not turn out to be as strong as you think you are.\" \"Are you threatening me? No, it\u0027s not a threat, is it?\" I shook my head. \"You don\u0027t have to worry about me. But you\u0027ve got enough to worry about without me.\" Her eyes dropped. \"I\u0027m so tired of being strong,\" she said. \"I\u0027m good at it, you know.\" \"I\u0027m sure you are.\" \"But it\u0027s tiring.\" \"Maybe I could help you.\" \"I don\u0027t think anyone can.\" \"Oh?\" She studied me briefly, then dropped her eyes. She stood and crossed the room to the window. I could have walked along behind her. There was something in her stance that suggested she expected me to. But I stayed where I was. She said, \"There\u0027s something there, isn\u0027t there?\" \"Yes.\" \"But it\u0027s just no good at the moment. The timing\u0027s all wrong.\" She was looking out the window. \"Right now neither of us can do the other any good at all.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. \"You\u0027d better go now.\" \"All right.\" \"It\u0027s so beautiful outside. The sun, the freshness of the air.\" She turned to look at me. \"Do you like this time of year?\" \"Yes. Very much.\" \"It\u0027s my favorite, I think. October, November, the best time of the year. But also the saddest, wouldn\u0027t you say?\" \"Sad? Why?\" \"Oh, very sad,\" she said. \"Because winter is coming.\" Chapter 2 On my way out I left the passkey with the doorman. He didn\u0027t seem any happier now, even though he was getting to see me leave this time. I went over to Johnny Joyce\u0027s on Second and sat in a booth. Most of the lunch crowd was gone. The ones who remained were one or two martinis over the line now and probably wouldn\u0027t make it back to their offices at all. I had a hamburger and a bottle of Harp, then drank a couple shots of bourbon with my coffee. I tried Broadfield\u0027s number. It rang for a while and no one answered it. I went back to my booth and had another bourbon and thought about some things. There were questions I couldn\u0027t seem to answer. Why had I passed up Portia Carr\u0027s offer of a drink when I wanted a drink so badly? And why (if it wasn\u0027t another version of the same question) had I passed up Portia Carr herself? I did some more thinking on West Forty-ninth Street, in the actors\u0027 chapel at St. Malachy\u0027s. The chapel is below street level, a large understated room which provides a measure of peace and quiet that is otherwise hard to come by in the heart of the Broadway theater district. I took an aisle seat and let my mind wander. An actress I used to know a long time ago once told me that she came to St. Malachy\u0027s every day when she wasn\u0027t working. \"I wonder if it matters that I\u0027m not a Catholic, Matt. I don\u0027t think so. I say my little prayer and I light my little candle and I pray for work. I wonder whether or not it helps. Do you suppose it\u0027s okay to ask God for a decent part?\" I must have sat there for close to an hour, running different things through my mind. On the way out I put a couple of bucks in the poor box and lit a few candles. I didn\u0027t say any prayers. I spent most of the evening in Polly\u0027s Cage, across the street from my hotel. Chuck was behind the bar and he was in an expansive mood, so much so that the house was buying every other round. I had reached my client late in the afternoon and had given him a brief rundown on my meeting with Carr. He\u0027d asked me where I was going to go from there, and I\u0027d said I would have to work it out and that I\u0027d get in touch when I had something he ought to know. Nothing in that category came up that night, so I didn\u0027t have to call him. Nor did I have any reason to call anyone else. I\u0027d picked up a phone message at my hotel: Anita had called and wanted me to call her, but it was not the sort of night on which I wanted to talk to an ex-wife. I stayed at Polly\u0027s and emptied my glass every time Chuck filled it up.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-2.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
