I gave her my notebook and pen and told her to write it down for me.\n \"But you can\u0027t go there now, Matt. It\u0027s too late and you\u0027re not up to it.\"\n \"It\u0027s too late, and I\u0027m too drunk.\"\n \"In the morning- \"\n \"I don\u0027t usually get so drunk, Trina. But I\u0027m all right.\"\n \"Of course you are, baby. Let\u0027s get out in the air. See? It\u0027s better already. That\u0027s the baby.\"\n Chapter 8\n It was a hard morning. I swallowed some aspirin and went downstairs to the Red Flame for a lot of coffee. It helped a little. My hands were slightly shaky and my stomach kept threatening to turn over.\n What I wanted was a drink. But I wanted it badly enough to know not to have it. I had things to do, places to go, people to see. So I stuck with the coffee.\n At the post office on Sixtieth Street I purchased a money order for a thousand dollars and another for forty-five dollars. I addressed an envelope and mailed them both to Anita. Then I walked around the corner to St. Paul \u0027s on Ninth Avenue. I must have sat there for fifteen or twenty minutes, not thinking of anything in particular. On the way out I stopped in front of the effigy of St. Anthony and lit a couple of candles for some absent friends. One was for Portia Carr, another for Estrellita Rivera, a couple others for a couple of other people. Then I put five fifty-dollar bills in the slot of the poor box and went out into the cold morning air.\n I have an odd relationship with churches, and it\u0027s one I do not entirely understand myself. It started not long after I moved to my Fifty-seventh Street hotel. I began spending time in churches, and I began lighting candles, and, ultimately, I began tithing. That last is the most curious part of all. I give a tenth of whatever money I make to the first church I happen to stop in after I receive payment. I don\u0027t know what they do with the money. They probably spend half of it converting happy pagans and use the rest to buy large cars for the clergy. But I keep giving my money to them and go on wondering why.\n The Catholics get most of my money because of the hours they keep. Their churches are more often open. Otherwise I\u0027m as ecumenical as you can get. A tenth of Broadfield\u0027s first payment to me had gone to St. Bartholomew\u0027s, an Episcopal church in Portia Carr\u0027s neighborhood, and now a tenth of his second payment went to St. Paul \u0027s.\n God knows why.\n DOUG Fuhrmann lived on Ninth Avenue between Fifty-third and Fifty-fourth. To the left of the ground-floor hardware store there was a doorway with a sign over it announcing the availability of furnished rooms by week or month. There were no mailboxes in the vestibule and no individual buzzers. I rang the bell alongside the inner door and waited until a woman with henna-bright hair shuffled to the door and opened it. She wore a plaid robe and had shabby bedroom slippers on her feet. \"Full up,\" she said. \"Try three doors down, he\u0027s usually got something available.\"\n I told her I was looking for Douglas Fuhrmann.\n \"Fourth floor front,\" she said. \"He expecting you?\"\n \"Yes.\" Although he wasn\u0027t.\n \" \u0027Cause he usually sleeps late. You can go on up.\"\n I climbed three flights of stairs, making my way through the sour smells of a building that had given up along with its tenants. I was surprised that Fuhrmann lived in a place like this. Men who live in broken-down Hell\u0027s Kitchen rooming houses don\u0027t usually have their addresses printed on their checks. They don\u0027t usually have checking accounts.\n I stood in front of his door. A radio was playing, and then I heard a burst of very rapid typing, then nothing but the radio. I knocked on the door. I heard the sound of a chair being pushed back, and then Fuhrmann\u0027s voice asked who it was.\n \"Scudder.\"\n \"Matt? Just a second.\" I waited and the door opened and Fuhrmann gave me a big smile. \"Come on in,\" he said. \"Jesus, you look like hell. You got a cold or something?\"\n \"I had a hard night.\"\n \"Want some coffee? I can give you a cup of instant. How\u0027d you find me, anyway? Or is that a professional secret? I guess detectives have to be good at finding people.\"\n He scurried around, plugged in an electric tea kettle, measured instant coffee into a pair of white china cups. He kept up a steady stream of conversation, but I wasn\u0027t listening to him. I was busy looking over the place where he lived.\n I hadn\u0027t been prepared for it. It was just one room, but it was a large one, measuring perhaps eighteen by twenty-five feet, with two windows overlooking Ninth Avenue. What made it remarkable was the dramatic contrast between it and the building it was situated in. All of the drabness and decay stopped at Fuhrmann\u0027s threshold.\n He had a rug on the floor, either an authentic Persian or a convincing imitation. His walls were lined with floor-to-ceiling built-in bookshelves. A desk a full twelve feet in length extended in front of the windows. It too had been built in. Even the paint on the walls was distinctive, the walls themselves- where they were not covered with bookshelves- painted in a dark ivory, the trim set off in a glossy white enamel.\n He saw me taking it all in, and his eyes danced behind his thick glasses. \"That\u0027s how everybody reacts,\" he said. \"You climb those stairs and it\u0027s depressing, right? And then you walk into my little retreat and it\u0027s almost shocking.\" The kettle whistled and he made our coffee. \"It\u0027s not as though I planned it this way,\" he said. \"I took this place a dozen years ago because I could afford it and there wasn\u0027t much else I could afford. I was paying fourteen dollars a week. And I\u0027ll tell you something, there were weeks when it was a struggle to come up with the fourteen bucks.\"\n He stirred the coffee, passed my cup to me. \"Then I got so I was making a living, but even so, I was a little hesitant about moving. I like the location, the sense of neighborhood. I even like the name of the neighborhood. Hell\u0027s Kitchen. If you\u0027re going to be a writer, where better to live than a place called Hell\u0027s Kitchen? Besides, I didn\u0027t want to commit myself to a big rent. I was getting ghostwriting assignments, I was building up a list of magazine editors who knew my work, but even so, it\u0027s not a steady business and I didn\u0027t want to have a big monthly nut to crack. So what I did, I started fixing this place up and making it bearable. I\u0027d do a little at a time. First thing I did was put in a full burglar alarm system because I got really paranoid about the idea of some junkie kicking the door in and ripping off my typewriter. Then the bookshelves because I was tired of having all my books piled up in cartons. And then the desk, and then I got rid of the original bed, which I think George Washington must have slept in, and I bought that platform bed, which sleeps eight in a pinch, and little by little the whole place came together. I kind of like it. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ever going to move.\n \"It suits you, Doug.\"\n He nodded eagerly. \"Yeah, I think it does. A couple of years ago I started to twitch because it occurred to me that they could boot me out. Here I got a ton invested in the place and what do I do if they raise my rent? I mean I was still paying by the week, for Christ\u0027s sake. The rent was up, it was maybe twenty bucks, but suppose they raise it to a hundred a week? Who knows what they\u0027re gonna do, you know? So what I did, I told \u0027em I\u0027d pay a hundred and twenty-five a month, and on top of that I\u0027d give them five hundred in cash under the table. For that I wanted a thirty-year lease.\"\n \"And they gave it to you?\"\n \"You ever heard of anybody with a thirty-year lease on a room on Ninth Avenue? They thought they had a real idiot on their hands.\" He chuckled. \"On top of which they never rented a room for more than twenty a week, and I was offering thirty plus cash under the table. They drew up a lease and I signed it. You know what people pay for a studio apartment this size and this location?\"\n \"Now? Two-fifty, three hundred.\"\n \"Three hundred easy. I still pay one and a quarter. In another two or three years this place\u0027ll be worth five hundred a month, maybe a thousand if the inflation keeps up. And I\u0027ll still pay one and a quarter. There\u0027s a guy buying up property all up and down Ninth Avenue. Someday they\u0027re going to start knocking down these buildings like ten-pins. But they\u0027ll have to either buy up my lease from me or wait until 1998 to knock the building down because that\u0027s how much time I got left on my lease. Beautiful?\"\n \"You got a good deal, Doug.\"\n \"Only clever thing I ever did in my life, Matt. And I wasn\u0027t looking to be clever. It\u0027s just I\u0027m comfortable here and I hate moving.\"\n I took a sip of my coffee. It wasn\u0027t much worse than what I\u0027d had for breakfast. I said, \"How did you and Broadfield get to be such buddies?\"\n \"Yeah, I figured that\u0027s why you were here. Is he crazy or something? Why did he go and kill her? There\u0027s no point to it at all.\"\n \"I know it.\"\n \"He always struck me as an even-tempered guy. Men that size have to be steady or they do too much damage. A guy like me could have a short fuse and it wouldn\u0027t matter because I\u0027d need a cannon to do any damage, but Broadfield- I guess he blew up and killed her, huh?\"\n I shook my head. \"Somebody knocked her over the head and then stuck a knife into her. You don\u0027t do that on an impulse.\"\n \"The way you said it, you sound as though you don\u0027t think he did it.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure he didn\u0027t.\"\n \"Jesus, I hope you\u0027re right.\"\n I looked at him. The large forehead and the thick glasses gave him the look of an extremely intelligent insect. I said, \"Doug, how do you know him?\"\n \"An article I was doing once. I had to talk to some cops for research, and he was one of the ones I talked to. We hit it off pretty well.\"\n \"When was that?\"\n \"Maybe four, five years ago. Why?\"\n \"And you\u0027re just friends? And that\u0027s why he decided to turn to you when he was on the spot?\"\n \"Well, I don\u0027t think he has too many friends, Matt. And he couldn\u0027t turn to any cop friends of his. He told me once that cops don\u0027t usually have many friends off the force.\"\n That was true enough. But Broadfield didn\u0027t seem to have many friends on the force, either.\n \"Why did he go to Prejanian in the first place, Doug?\"\n \"Hell, don\u0027t ask me. Ask Broadfield.\"\n \"But you know the answer, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Matt- \"\n \"He wants to write a book. That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it? He wants to make a big enough splash to be a celebrity, and he wants you to write his book for him. And then he can do all the television talk shows and grin that cute grin of his and call a lot of important people by their first names. That\u0027s where you come into it. That\u0027s the only way you can come into it, and it\u0027s the only reason that would have sent him to Abner Prejanian\u0027s office.\"\n He wouldn\u0027t look at me. \"He wanted it a secret, Matt.\"\n \"Sure. And afterward he would just happen to write a book. In response to popular demand.\"\n \"It could be dynamite. Not just his role with the investigation but his whole life. He\u0027s told me the most fascinating stuff I\u0027ve ever heard. I wish he\u0027d let me tape some of it, but so far everything\u0027s off the record. When I heard he killed her I saw the chance of my life going down the drain. But if he\u0027s really innocent- \"\n \"Where did he get the idea of doing the book?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-13.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) \n Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
