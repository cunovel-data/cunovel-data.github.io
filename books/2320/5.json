Where\u0027s your angle?\"\n \"Do I have to have an angle?\"\n \"You never walked down the street without one.\"\n He thought about it and decided not to resent the line. Instead he chuckled. \"And do you have to know my angle, Matt?\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n He sipped his drink and thought it over. I was almost hoping he would tell me to fuck off. I wanted to go away and forget about him. He was a man I\u0027d never like involved in something I couldn\u0027t understand. I really didn\u0027t want to get mixed up in any of his problems.\n Then he said, \"You of all people should understand.\"\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"You were on the force fifteen years, Matt. Right? And you got the promotions, you did pretty good, so you musta known the score. You had to be a guy who played the game. Am I right?\"\n \"Keep talking.\"\n \"So you got fifteen years in and five to go for the meal ticket and you pack it in. Puts you in the same boat as me, doesn\u0027t it? You reach a point where you can\u0027t hack it anymore. The corruption, the shakedowns, the payoffs. It gets to you. Your case, you just pack it in and get out of it. I can respect that. Believe me, I can respect it. I considered it myself, but then I decided it wasn\u0027t enough for me, the approach wasn\u0027t right for me, I couldn\u0027t just walk away from something I had twelve years in.\"\n \"Going on thirteen.\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"Nothing. You were saying?\"\n \"I was saying I couldn\u0027t just turn my back and walk away. I had to do something to make it better. Not all the way better, but maybe just a little bit better, and that means some heads will have to roll, and I\u0027m sorry about that, but it has to be that way.\" A wide grin, sudden and alarming now on this face that has been so preoccupied with the business of being sincere. \"Look, Matt, I\u0027m not some fucking Christer. I\u0027m an angle guy, you called me on that and it\u0027s true. I know things that Abner has trouble believing. A guy who\u0027s absolutely straight, he\u0027s never going to hear these things because the wise guys\u0027ll dummy up when he walks into the room. But a guy like me gets a chance to hear everything.\" He leaned forward. \"I\u0027ll tell you something. Maybe you don\u0027t know it, maybe it wasn\u0027t quite this bad yet when you were carrying a badge. But this whole fucking city is for sale. You can buy the police force all across the board. Straight on up to Murder One.\"\n \"I never heard that.\" Which wasn\u0027t quite true. I\u0027d heard it. I\u0027d just never believed it.\n \"Not every cop, Matt. Not hardly. But I know two cases- that\u0027s two I know for a fact- where guys got caught with their cocks on the block for homicide and they bought theirselves out from under. And narcotics, fuck, I don\u0027t have to tell you about narcotics. That\u0027s an open secret. Every heavy dealer keeps a couple of thou in a special pocket. He won\u0027t go out on the street without it. That\u0027s called walkaway money- you lay it on the cop who busts you and he lets you walk away.\"\n Was it always that way? It seemed to me that it wasn\u0027t. There were always cops who took, some who took a little and some who took a lot, some who didn\u0027t say no when easy money came their way, others who actually went out and hustled for it. But there were also things that nobody ever did. Nobody took murder money, and nobody took narcotics money.\n But things do change.\n \"So you just got sick of it,\" I said.\n \"That\u0027s right. And you\u0027re the last person I should have to explain it to.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t leave the force because of corruption.\"\n \"Oh? My mistake.\"\n I stood up and walked over to where he\u0027d left the bourbon bottle. I freshened my drink and drank off half of it. Still on my feet I said, \"Corruption never bothered me much. It put a lot of food on my family\u0027s table.\" I was talking as much to myself as to Broadfield. He didn\u0027t really care why I left the force any more than I cared whether he knew the right reason or not. \"I took what came my way. I didn\u0027t walk around with my hand out and I never let a man buy his way out of something I considered a serious crime, but there was never a week when we lived on what the city paid me.\" I drained my glass. \"You take plenty. The city didn\u0027t buy that suit.\"\n \"No question.\" The grin again. I didn\u0027t like that grin much. \"I took plenty, Matt. No argument. But we all have certain lines we draw, right? Why did you quit, anyway?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t like the hours.\"\n \"Seriously.\"\n \"That\u0027s serious enough.\"\n It was as much as I felt like telling him. For all I knew he already had the whole story, or whatever the back-fence version of it sounded like these days.\n What happened was simple enough. A few years back I was having a few drinks in a bar in Washington Heights. I was off duty and entitled to drink if I felt like it, and the bar was one where cops could drink on the arm, which may have constituted police corruption but which had never given me a sleepless night.\n Then a couple of punks held up the place and shot the bartender dead on their way out. I chased them down the street and emptied my service revolver at them, and I killed one of the bastards and crippled the other, but one bullet didn\u0027t go where it was supposed to. It ricocheted off something or other and into the eye of a seven-year-old girl named Estrellita Rivera, and on through the eye and into the brain, and Estrellita Rivera died and so did a large part of me.\n There was a departmental investigation which ended with me being completely exonerated and even awarded a commendation, and a little while after that I resigned from the force and separated from Anita and moved to my hotel on Fifty-seventh Street. I don\u0027t know how it all fits together, or if it all fits together, but what it seemed to add up to was that I hadn\u0027t enjoyed being a cop anymore. But none of this was any of Jerry Broadfield\u0027s business, and he wasn\u0027t going to hear it from me.\n So I said, \"I don\u0027t really know what I can do for you.\"\n \"You can do more than I can. You\u0027re not stuck in this lousy apartment.\"\n \"Who brings you your food?\"\n \"My food? Oh. I been getting out for a bite and like that. But not much and not often. And I\u0027m careful that nobody\u0027s watching when I leave the building or come back into it.\"\n \"Sooner or later somebody\u0027s going to tag you.\"\n \"Hell, I know that.\" He lit another cigarette. The gold Dunhill was just a flat sliver of metal, lost in his large hand. \"I\u0027m just trying to buy myself a couple of days,\" he said. \"That\u0027s about all. She splashed herself all over the papers yesterday. I been here since then. I figure I can last the week if I get lucky, a quiet neighborhood like this. By then maybe you can pinch her fuse.\"\n \"Or maybe I can\u0027t do a thing.\"\n \"Will you try, Matt?\"\n I didn\u0027t really want to. I was running low on money, but that didn\u0027t bother me too much. It was the beginning of the month and my rent was paid through the end of the month and I had enough cash on hand to keep me in bourbon and coffee, with a little left over for luxuries like food.\n I didn\u0027t like the big cocky son of a bitch. But that didn\u0027t get in the way. As a matter of fact, I generally prefer to work for men I neither like nor respect. It pains me less to give them poor value.\n So it didn\u0027t matter that I didn\u0027t like Broadfield. Or that I didn\u0027t believe that more than 20 percent of what he had told me was the truth. And I wasn\u0027t even sure which 20 percent to believe.\n That last may have been what made my decision for me. Because I evidently wanted to find out what was true and what was false about Jerome Broadfield. And why he had wound up in bed with Abner Prejanian, and just where Portia Carr fit into the picture, and who was setting him up, and how and why. I don\u0027t know why I wanted to know all this, but evidently I did.\n \"Okay,\" I said.\n \"You\u0027ll take a shot at it?\"\n I nodded.\n \"You\u0027ll want some money.\"\n I nodded again.\n \"How much?\"\n I never know how to set a fee. It didn\u0027t sound as though it would take too much time- I\u0027d either find a way to help him or I wouldn\u0027t, and either way I\u0027d know soon enough. But I didn\u0027t want to price myself cheap. Because I didn\u0027t like him. Because he was slick and he wore expensive clothes and he lit his cigarettes with a gold Dunhill.\n \"Five hundred dollars.\"\n He thought it seemed pretty steep. I told him he could find somebody else if he wanted. He was quick to assure me he hadn\u0027t meant anything of the sort, and he took a wallet from his inside breast pocket and counted out twenties and fifties. There was still a lot left in the wallet after he\u0027d piled five hundred dollars on the table in front of him.\n \"Hope you don\u0027t mind cash,\" he said.\n I told him cash was fine.\n \"Not too many people mind,\" he said, and he gave me the grin again. I just sat there for a minute or two looking at him. Then I leaned over and picked up the money.\n Chapter 4\n Its official name is the Manhattan House of Detention for Men, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever heard anyone call it that. Everybody calls it the Tombs. I don\u0027t know why. But the name somehow fits the washed-out, bottomed-out, burned-out feeling of the structure and its inhabitants.\n It\u0027s on White Street at Centre, conveniently located near Police Headquarters and the Criminal Courts Building. Every once in a while it gets into the papers and the television news because there\u0027s a riot there. Then the citizenry is treated to a report on the appalling conditions, and a lot of good people sign petitions, and someone appoints an investigative commission, and a lot of politicians call press conferences, and the guards ask for a pay increase, and after a few weeks it all blows over.\n I don\u0027t suppose it\u0027s much worse than most urban jails. The suicide rate is high, but that\u0027s in part a result of the propensity of Puerto Rican males between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five to hang themselves in their cells for no particular reason- unless you call being Puerto Rican and in a cell adequate reason to kill yourself. Blacks and whites in that age group and those circumstances also kill themselves, but the PRs have a much higher rate, and New York has more of them than most cities.\n Another thing that boosts the rate is that the guards at the Tombs wouldn\u0027t lose any sleep if every Puerto Rican in America wound up swinging from the light fixtures.\n I got to the Tombs around ten-thirty after spending a few hours not getting back to sleep and not coming entirely awake either. I\u0027d grabbed some breakfast and read the Times and the News without learning anything very exciting about Broadfield or the girl he was supposed to have killed. The News at least had the story, and of course they\u0027d given it the headline and a big splash on page three. Portia Carr had not been strangled if I was to believe the newspaper; instead someone had brained her with something heavy and then stuck her in the heart with something sharp.\n Broadfield had said on the phone that he thought she\u0027d been strangled. Which meant he might have been being cute, or he might have had the story wrong, or the News was full of crap.\n That was about all the News had, right or wrong. The rest was background. Even so, they were ahead of the Times- the late city edition didn\u0027t have a line of type on the murder.\n THEY let me see him in his cell. He was wearing a windowpane-check suit, light blue on navy, over another custom shirt. You get to keep your own clothing if you\u0027re being held for trial. If you\u0027re serving a sentence in the Tombs you wear standard prison issue. In Broadfield\u0027s case this wouldn\u0027t happen because if he was convicted he would be sent upstate to Sing Sing or Dannemora or Attica. You don\u0027t do murder time in the Tombs. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-5.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) \n Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
