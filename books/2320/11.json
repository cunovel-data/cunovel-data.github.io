{"id":97187,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"I said I\u0027d call either way,\" I told her. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to drop over tonight. Maybe tomorrow.\" \"Sure, Matt. Was it anything important?\" \"You remember what we were talking about before. If you could find out some more on that subject I\u0027d make it worth your while.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want to stick my neck out. I like to keep what they call a low profile. I do my work and I save my pennies for my old age.\" \"Real estate, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Uh-huh. Apartment houses in Queens.\" \"Hard to see you as a landlady.\" \"The tenants never set eyes on me. This management firm takes care of everything. The guy who handles it for me, I know him professionally.\" \"Uh-huh. Getting rich?\" \"Doing okay. I\u0027m not going to be one of those old Broadway ladies with a dollar a day to feed themselves on. No way.\" \"Well, you could ask a few questions and make a few dollars. If you\u0027re interested.\" \"I suppose I could try. You\u0027ll keep my name out of everything, right? You just want me to come up with something that\u0027ll give you an opening.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Well, I could see what happens.\" \"Do that, Elaine. I\u0027ll drop by tomorrow.\" \"Call first.\" I went upstairs, kicked off my shoes, stretched out on the bed. I closed my eyes for a minute or two. I was just on the verge of sleep when I forced myself to sit up. The bourbon bottle on the bedside table was empty. I dropped it into the wastebasket and checked the closet shelf. There was an unopened pint of Jim Beam just waiting for me. I cracked it and took a short pull from it. It wasn\u0027t Wild Turkey but it did get the job done. Eddie Koehler wanted me to call him but I couldn\u0027t see any reason why that conversation couldn\u0027t wait a day or two. I could guess what he was going to tell me and it wasn\u0027t anything I wanted to hear. It must have been around a quarter after eight when I picked up the phone and called Anita. We didn\u0027t have too much to say to each other. She told me the bills had been heavy lately, she\u0027d had some root-canal work done and the boys seemed to be outgrowing everything at once, and if I could spare a couple of bucks it would be welcome. I said I\u0027d just landed some work and would get a money order off to her in the morning. \"That would be a big help, Matt. But the reason I kept leaving messages for you, the boys wanted to talk to you.\" \"Sure.\" I talked to Mickey first. He didn\u0027t really say much. School was fine, everything was okay- the usual patter, automatic and mindless. Then he put his older brother on the line. \"Dad? They got this thing in Scouts, like for the Nets\u0027 home opener against the Squires? And it\u0027s supposed to be a father-son deal, you know? They\u0027re getting the tickets through the troop, so everybody\u0027ll be sitting together.\" \"And you and Mickey would like to go?\" \"Well, could we? Me and Mick are both Nets fans, and they ought to be good this year.\" \"Jennifer and I.\" \"Huh?\" \"Nothing.\" \"The only thing, it\u0027s kind of expensive.\" \"How much is it?\" \"Well, it\u0027s fifteen dollars a person, but that includes the dinner first and the bus ride out to the Coliseum.\" \"How much extra do you have to pay if you don\u0027t have the dinner?\" \"Huh? I don\u0027t- oh.\" He started to giggle. \"Hey, that\u0027s really neat,\" he said. \"Let me tell Mick. Dad wants to know how much extra you have to pay if you don\u0027t have the dinner. Don\u0027t you get it, stupid? Dad? How much extra if you don\u0027t ride on the bus?\" \"That\u0027s the idea.\" \"I bet the dinner\u0027s chicken a la king.\" \"It\u0027s always chicken a la king. Look, the cost\u0027s no problem, and if the seats are halfway decent it doesn\u0027t sound like too bad a deal. When is it?\" \"Well, it\u0027s a week from tomorrow. Friday night.\" \"That could be a problem. It\u0027s pretty short notice.\" \"They just told us at the last meeting. Can\u0027t we go?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve got a case and I don\u0027t know how long it\u0027ll run. Or if I can steal a few hours in the middle of it.\" \"I guess it\u0027s a pretty important case, huh?\" \"The guy I\u0027m trying to help is charged with murder.\" \"Did he do it?\" \"I don\u0027t think so, but that\u0027s not the same as knowing how to prove it.\" \"Can\u0027t the police investigate and work it out?\" Not when they don\u0027t want to, I thought. I said, \"Well, they think my friend is guilty and they\u0027re not bothering to look any further. That\u0027s why he has me working for him.\" I rubbed my temple where a pulse was starting to throb. \"Look, here\u0027s how we\u0027ll do it. Why don\u0027t you go ahead and make the arrangements, all right? I\u0027m sending your mother some money tomorrow and I\u0027ll send an extra forty-five bucks for the tickets. If I can\u0027t make it I\u0027ll let you know and you can just give one ticket away and tag along with somebody else. How does that sound?\" There was a pause. \"The thing is, Jack said he would take us if you couldn\u0027t.\" \"Jack?\" \"He\u0027s Mom\u0027s friend.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"But you know, it\u0027s supposed to be a father-son thing, and he\u0027s not our father.\" \"Right. Hang on a second, will you?\" I didn\u0027t actually need a drink, but I couldn\u0027t see how it would hurt me. I capped the bottle and said, \"How do you get along with Jack?\" \"Oh, he\u0027s okay.\" \"That\u0027s good. Well, see how this sounds. I\u0027ll take you if I possibly can. If not, you can use my ticket and take Jack. Okay?\" That\u0027s how we left it. IN Armstrong\u0027s I nodded to four or five people but didn\u0027t find the man I was looking for. I sat down at my table. When Trina came over I asked her if Doug Fuhrmann had been in. \"You\u0027re an hour late,\" she said. \"He dropped in, drank one beer, cashed a check and split.\" \"Do you happen to know where he lives?\" She shook her head. \"In the neighborhood, but I couldn\u0027t tell you where. Why?\" \"I wanted to get in touch with him.\" \"I\u0027ll ask Don.\" But Don didn\u0027t know either. I had a bowl of pea soup and a hamburger. When Trina brought my coffee she sat down across from me and rested her little pointed chin on the back of her hand. \"You\u0027re in a funny mood,\" she said. \"I\u0027m always in a funny mood.\" \"Funny for you, I mean. Either you\u0027re working or you\u0027re uptight about something.\" \"Maybe both.\" \"Are you working?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Is that why you\u0027re looking for Doug Fuhrmann? Are you working for him?\" \"For a friend of his.\" \"Did you try the telephone book?\" I touched my index finger to the tip of her little nose. \"You ought to be a detective,\" I said. \"Probably do a lot better at it than me.\" Except that he wasn\u0027t in the book. There were around two dozen Fuhrmanns in the Manhattan directory, twice that number of Furmans, and a handful of Fermans and Fermins. I established all this closeted in my hotel room with a phone book, and then I placed my calls from the booth downstairs, stopping periodically to get more dimes from Vinnie. Calls from my room cost double and it\u0027s annoying enough to waste dimes to no purpose. I tried all the Fuhrmanns, however spelled, within a two-mile radius of Armstrong\u0027s, and I talked to a lot of people with the same last name as my writer friend and a few with the same first name as well, but I didn\u0027t reach anybody who knew him and it took a lot of dimes before I gave up. I went back to Armstrong\u0027s around eleven, maybe a little later. A couple of nurses had my regular table so I took one over on the side. I gave the bar crowd a fast glance just to make sure Fuhrmann wasn\u0027t there, and then Trina scurried over and said, \"Don\u0027t look or anything, but there\u0027s somebody at the bar who\u0027s been asking about you.\" \"I didn\u0027t know you could talk without moving your lips.\" \"About three stools from the front. Big guy, he was wearing a hat, but I don\u0027t know if he still is.\" \"He is.\" \"You know him?\" \"You could always quit this grind and become a ventriloquist,\" I suggested. \"Or you could act in one of those old prison movies. If they still make them. He can\u0027t read your lips, kid. You\u0027ve got your back to him.\" \"Do you know who he is?\" \"Uh-huh. It\u0027s all right.\" \"Should I tell him you\u0027re here?\" \"You don\u0027t have to. He\u0027s on his way over here. Find out what he\u0027s drinking from Don and bring him a refill. And I\u0027ll have my usual.\" I watched as Eddie Koehler came over, pulled a chair back, settled himself on it. We looked at each other, careful appraising looks. He took a cigar from his jacket pocket and unwrapped it, then patted his pockets until he found a toothpick to puncture its end. He spent a lot of time lighting the cigar, turning it in the flame to get it burning evenly. We still hadn\u0027t spoken when Trina came back with the drinks. His looked to be scotch and water. She asked if he wanted it mixed and he nodded. She mixed it and put it on the table in front of him, then served me my cup of coffee and my double shot of bourbon. I took a short sip of the bourbon neat and poured the rest of it into my coffee. Eddie said, \"You\u0027re tough to get hold of. I left you a couple of messages. I guess you never got over to your hotel to pick em up.\" \"I picked them up.\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s what the clerk said earlier when I checked. So I guess my line must of been busy when you tried to call me.\" \"I didn\u0027t call.\" \"That so?\" \"I had things to do, Eddie.\" \"No time to call an old friend, huh?\" \"I figured to call you in the morning.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Sometime tomorrow, anyway.\" \"Uh-huh. Tonight you were busy.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" He seemed to notice his drink for the first time. He looked at it as if it was the first one he had ever seen. He switched his cigar to his left hand and lifted the glass with his right. He sniffed it and looked at me. \"Smells like what I been drinking,\" he said. \"I told her to bring you another of the same.\" \"It\u0027s nothing fancy. Seagram\u0027s. Same as I been drinking for years.\" \"That\u0027s right, that\u0027s what you always used to have.\" He nodded. \" \u0027Course, it\u0027s rare for me to have more\u0027n two, three in a day. Two, three drinks- I guess that\u0027s just about what you have for breakfast, huh, Matt?\" \"Oh, it\u0027s not quite that bad, Eddie.\" \"No? Glad to hear it. You hear things around, you know. Be amazed what you hear around.\" \"I can imagine.\" \"Sure you can. Well, what do you want to drink to, anyhow? Any special toast?\" \"Nothing special.\" \"Speaking of special, how about the Special Prosecutor? You got any objection to drinking to Mr. Abner L. Prejanian?\" \"Whatever you say.\" \"Fine.\" He raised his glass. \"To Prejanian, may he drop dead and may he rot.\" I touched my cup to his glass and we drank. \"You got no objection to drinking to that toast, huh?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-11.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
