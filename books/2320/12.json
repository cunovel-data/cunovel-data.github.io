Greasy little cocksucker.\" He took another sip of his drink, then shook his head with annoyance and put his glass on the table. \"Aw, fuck this, Matt. How long we known each other?\" \"It\u0027s been a few years, Eddie.\" \"I guess it has. What the fuck are you doing with a shithead like Broadfield, will you tell me that? What the fuck are you doing playing games with him?\" \"He hired me.\" \"To do what?\" \"Find evidence that will clear him.\" \"Find a way for him to beat a murder charge, that\u0027s what he wants you to do. Do you know what a son of a bitch he is? Do you have any fucking idea?\" \"I have a pretty good idea.\" \"He\u0027s gonna try to give the entire department the shaft, that\u0027s all he\u0027s trying to do. He\u0027s gonna help that shitkicker of a rug peddler expose corruption in high places. Christ, I hate that candy-ass son of a bitch. He was as corrupt a cop as you\u0027d ever want to see. I mean he went out hunting for it, Matt. Not just taking everything they handed him. He hunted it. He would go out and detect like crazy, looking for crap games and smack dealers and everything else. But not to arrest them. Only if they weren\u0027t holding money, then they might make the trip to the station house. But he was in business for himself. His badge was a license to steal.\" \"I know all that.\" \"You know all that and yet you\u0027re working for him.\" \"What if he didn\u0027t kill the girl, Eddie?\" \"She was stone dead in his apartment.\" \"And you think he\u0027s stupid enough to kill her and leave her there?\" \"Oh, shit.\" He puffed on his cigar and the end glowed red. \"He got out of there and dumped the murder weapons. Whatever he hit her with and whatever he stabbed her with. Say he went down to the river and dumped them. Then he stopped somewhere to have a couple of beers because he\u0027s a cocky son of a bitch and he\u0027s a little bit crazy. Then he came back for the body. He was going to dump her someplace but by then we got men on the scene and they\u0027re laying for him.\" \"So he walked right into their arms.\" \"So?\" I shook my head. \"It doesn\u0027t make sense. He may be a little crazy but he\u0027s certainly not stupid and you\u0027re arguing that he acted like an idiot. How did your boys know to go to that apartment in the first place? The papers said you got a telephone tip. Is that right?\" \"It\u0027s right.\" \"Anonymous?\" \"Yeah. So?\" \"That\u0027s very handy. Who would know to tip you? Did she scream? Anybody else hear her? Where did the tip come from?\" \"What\u0027s the difference? Maybe somebody looked in a window. Whoever called said there was a woman murdered in such-and-such an apartment, and a couple of the boys went there and found a woman with a bump on her head and a knife wound in her back and she was dead. Who cares how the tipster knew she was there?\" \"It might make a difference. If he put her there, for instance.\" \"Aw, come on, Matt.\" \"You don\u0027t have any hard evidence. None. It\u0027s all circumstantial.\" \"It\u0027s enough to nail the lid on. We got motive, we got opportunity, we got the woman dead in his goddam apartment, for Christ\u0027s sake. What more do you want? He had every reason to kill her. She was nailing his balls to the wall, and of course he wanted her dead.\" He swallowed some more of his drink. He said, \"You know, you used to be a hell of a good cop. Maybe the booze is getting to you these days. Maybe it\u0027s more than you can handle.\" \"Could be.\" \"Oh, hell.\" He sighed heavily. \"You can take his money, Matt. A guy has to make a living. I know how it is. Just don\u0027t get in the way, huh? Take his money and string him for all he\u0027s worth. The hell, he\u0027s been on the other end of it often enough. Let him get played for a sucker for a change.\" \"I don\u0027t think he killed her.\" \"Shit.\" He took his cigar out of his mouth and stared at it, then clamped his teeth around it and puffed on it. Then, his tone softer, he said, \"You know, Matt, the department\u0027s pretty clean these days. Cleaner than it\u0027s been in years. Almost all of the old-style pads have been eliminated. There\u0027s still some people taking big money, no question about it, but the old system with money delivered by a bagman and distributed through an entire precinct, you don\u0027t see that anymore.\" \"Even uptown?\" \"Well, one of the uptown precincts is probably still a little dirty. It\u0027s hard to keep it clean up there. You know how it goes. Aside from that, though, the department stacks up pretty good.\" \"So?\" \"So we\u0027re policing ourselves pretty nicely, and this son of a bitch makes us look like shit all over again, and a lot of good men are going to be up against the wall just because one son of a bitch wants to be an angel and another son of a bitch of a rug peddler wants to be governor.\" \"That\u0027s why you hate Broadfield but- \" \"You\u0027re fucking right I hate him.\" \"- but why do you want to see him in jail?\" I leaned forward. \"He\u0027s finished already, Eddie. He\u0027s washed up. I talked to one of Prejanian\u0027s staff members. They have no use for him. He could get off the hook tomorrow and Prejanian wouldn\u0027t dare pick him up. Whoever framed him already did enough of a job on him from your point of view. What\u0027s wrong with my going after the killer?\" \"We already got the killer. He\u0027s in a cell in the Tombs.\" \"Let\u0027s just suppose you\u0027re wrong, Eddie. Then what?\" He stared hard at me. \"All right,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s suppose I\u0027m wrong. Let\u0027s suppose your boy is clean and pure as the snow. Let\u0027s say he never did a bad thing in his life. Let\u0027s say somebody else killed What\u0027s-her-name.\" \"Portia Carr.\" \"Right. And somebody deliberately framed Broadfield and set him up for a fall.\" \"So?\" \"And you go after the guy and you get him.\" \"So?\" \"And he\u0027s a cop, because who else would have such a good goddam reason to send Broadfield up?\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah, oh. That\u0027s gonna look terrific, isn\u0027t it?\" He had his chin jutting at me, and the tendons in his throat were taut. His eyes were furious. \"I don\u0027t say that\u0027s what happened,\" he said. \"Because for my money Broadfield\u0027s as guilty as Judas, but if he\u0027s not, then somebody did a job on him, and who could it be but a couple of cops who want to give that son of a bitch what he deserves? And that would look beautiful, wouldn\u0027t it? A cop kills a girl and pins it on another cop to head off an investigation into police corruption. That would look just beautiful.\" I thought about it. \"And if that\u0027s what happened, you\u0027d rather see Broadfield go to jail for something he didn\u0027t do than for it to come out in the open. Is that what you\u0027re saying?\" \"Shit.\" \"Is that what you\u0027re saying, Eddie?\" \"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake. I\u0027d rather see him dead, Matt. Even if I had to blow his fucking head off all by myself.\" \"MATT? You okay?\" I looked up at Trina. Her apron was off and she had her coat over her arm. \"You leaving?\" \"I just finished my shift. You\u0027ve been putting away a lot of bourbon. I just wondered if you were all right.\" I nodded. \"Who was that man you were talking with?\" \"An old friend. He\u0027s a cop, a lieutenant working out of the Sixth Precinct. That\u0027s down in the Village.\" I picked up my glass but put it down again without drinking from it. \"He was about the best friend I had on the force. Not buddy-buddy, but we got along pretty well. Of course, you drift apart over the years.\" \"What did he want?\" \"He just wanted to talk.\" \"You seemed upset after he left.\" I looked up at her. I said, \"The thing is, murder is different. Taking a human life, that\u0027s something completely different. Nobody should be allowed to get away with that. Nobody should ever be allowed to get away with that.\" \"I don\u0027t follow you.\" \"He didn\u0027t do it, damn it. He didn\u0027t, he\u0027s innocent, and nobody cares. Eddie Koehler doesn\u0027t care. I know Eddie Koehler. He\u0027s a good cop.\" \"Matt- \" \"But he doesn\u0027t care. He wants me to coast and not even make an effort because he wants that poor bastard to go to jail for a murder he didn\u0027t commit. And he wants the one who really did it to get away with it.\" \"I don\u0027t think I understand what you\u0027re saying, Matt. Look, don\u0027t finish that drink, huh? You don\u0027t really need it, do you?\" Everything seemed very clear to me. I couldn\u0027t fathom why Trina seemed to be having difficulty following me. I was enunciating clearly enough, and my thoughts, at least to me, flowed with crystalline clarity. \"Crystalline clarity,\" I said. \"What?\" \"I know what he wants. Nobody else can figure it, but it\u0027s obvious. You know what he wants, Diana?\" \"I\u0027m Trina, Matt. Honey, don\u0027t you know who I am?\" \"Of course I do. Slip of the tongue. Don\u0027t you know what he wants, baby? He wants the glory.\" \"Who does, Matt? The man you were talking to?\" \"Eddie?\" I laughed at the notion. \"Eddie Koehler doesn\u0027t give a damn about glory. I\u0027m talking about Jerry. Good old Jerry.\" \"Uh-huh.\" She uncurled my fingers from around my glass and lifted the glass free. \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" she said. \"I won\u0027t be a minute, Matt.\" And then she went away, and shortly after that she was back again. I may have gone on talking to her while she was away from the table. I\u0027m not too certain one way or the other. \"Let\u0027s go home, Matt. I\u0027ll walk you home, all right? Or would you like to stay at my place tonight?\" I shook my head. \"Can\u0027t do that.\" \"Of course you can.\" \"No. Have to see Doug Fuhrmann. Very important to see old Doug, baby.\" \"Did you find him in the book?\" \"That\u0027s it. The book. He can put us all in a book, baby. That\u0027s where he comes in.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" I frowned, irritated. I was making perfect sense and couldn\u0027t understand why my meaning was evidently eluding her. She was a bright girl, Trina was. She ought to be able to understand. \"The check,\" I said. \"You already settled your check, Matt. And you tipped me, you gave me too much. Come on, please, stand up, that\u0027s an angel. Oh, baby, the world did a job on you, didn\u0027t it? It\u0027s okay. All the times you helped me get it together, I can do it for you once in a while, can\u0027t I?\" \"The check, Trina.\" \"You paid the check, I just told you, and- \" \"Fuhrmann\u0027s check.\" It was easier to talk clearly now, easier to think more clearly, standing on my feet. \"He cashed a check here earlier tonight. That\u0027s what you said.\" \"So?\" \"Check would be in the register, wouldn\u0027t it?\" \"Sure. So what? Look, Matt, let\u0027s get out in the fresh air and you\u0027ll feel a lot better.\" I held up a hand. \"I\u0027m all right,\" I insisted. \"Fuhrmann\u0027s check\u0027s in the register. Ask Don if you can have a look at it.\" She still didn\u0027t follow me. \"His address,\" I explained. \"Most people have their address printed on their checks. I should have thought of it before. Go see, will you? Please?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-12.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
