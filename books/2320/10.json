Do you know how some actors can just walk onto a stage and every eye is drawn to them? It doesn\u0027t matter if someone else is in the middle of a speech. They just have so much dramatic quality that you have to look at them. I\u0027m not like that, not at all. And of course Jerry is.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s striking, certainly. His height probably has something to do with it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s more than that. He\u0027s tall and good-looking but it\u0027s more than that. There\u0027s a quality he has. People look at him on the street. They always have as long as I\u0027ve known him. And don\u0027t think he doesn\u0027t work at it. Sometimes I\u0027ve seen him at work on it, Matthew. I\u0027ll recognize a deliberately casual gesture that I\u0027ve caught him using before, and I will know just how calculated it is, and at moments like that I can honestly despise the man.\"\\n\\n A car passed by outside. We sat, our eyes not quite meeting, and we listened to distant street sounds and private thoughts.\\n\\n \"You said you were divorced.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Recently?\"\\n\\n \"A few years.\"\\n\\n \"Children?\"\\n\\n \"Two boys. My wife has custody.\"\\n\\n \"I have two girls and a boy. I must have told you that.\"\\n\\n \"Sara and Jennifer and Eric.\"\\n\\n \"You have a remarkable memory.\" She looked at her hands. \"Is it better? Being divorced?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Sometimes it\u0027s better and sometimes it\u0027s worse. I don\u0027t actually think of it in those terms because there wasn\u0027t really any choice involved. It had to be that way.\"\\n\\n \"Your wife wanted the divorce.\"\\n\\n \"No, I was the one who wanted it. The one who had to live alone. But my wanting wasn\u0027t a matter of choice, if that makes any sense to you. I had to be by myself.\"\\n\\n \"Are you still living alone?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Do you enjoy it?\"\\n\\n \"Does anyone?\"\\n\\n She was silent for a long moment. She sat with her hands gripping her knee, her head tilted back, her eyes closed, and her thoughts turned inward. Without opening her eyes she said, \"What\u0027s going to happen to Jerry?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s impossible to say. Unless something turns up he\u0027ll go to trial. He might get off or he might not. A high-powered lawyer could drag things out for a long time.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s possible he\u0027ll be convicted?\"\\n\\n I hesitated, then nodded.\\n\\n \"And go to prison?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s possible.\"\\n\\n \"God.\"\\n\\n She picked up her mug and stared down into it, then raised her eyes to meet mine. \"Should I get us more coffee, Matthew?\"\\n\\n \"No more for me.\"\\n\\n \"Should I have some more? Should I have another drink?\"\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s what you need.\"\\n\\n She thought about it. \"It\u0027s not what I need,\" she decided. \"Do you know what I need?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \"I need you to come over here and sit next to me. I need to be held.\"\\n\\n I sat on the couch beside her and she came into my arms eagerly like a small animal seeking warmth. Her face was very soft against mine, her breath warm and sweet. When my mouth found hers she stiffened for a moment. Then, as if realizing that her decision had long since been reached, she relaxed in my arms and returned the kiss.\\n\\n At one point she said, \"Let\u0027s just make everything go away. Everything.\" And then she did not have to say anything after that, and neither did I.\\n\\n A little later we were sitting as before, she on the couch, I on my chair. She was sipping unspiked coffee, and I had a glass of straight bourbon that I\u0027d finished a little more than half of. We were talking quietly and we stopped our conversation when footsteps sounded on the stairs. A girl about ten years old entered the room. She looked like her mother.\\n\\n She said, \"Mommy, me and Jennifer want to- \"\\n\\n \"Jennifer and I.\"\\n\\n The child sighed theatrically. \"Mommy, Jennifer and I want to watch Fantastic Voyage and Eric is being a pig and wants to watch The Flintstones and me and Jennifer I mean Jennifer and I hate The Flintstones.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call Eric a pig.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t call Eric a pig. I just said he was being a pig.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose there\u0027s a difference. You and Jennifer can watch your program in my room. Is that what you wanted?\"\\n\\n \"Why doesn\u0027t Eric watch in your room? After all, Mommy, he\u0027s watching our set in our room.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want Eric alone in my room.\"\\n\\n \"Well, me and Jennifer don\u0027t want him alone in our room, Mommy, and- \"\\n\\n \"Sara- \"\\n\\n \"Okay. We\u0027ll watch in your room.\"\\n\\n \"Sara, this is Mr. Scudder.\"\\n\\n \"Hello, Mr. Scudder. Can I go now, Mommy?\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead.\"\\n\\n When the child had disappeared up the staircase, her mother let out a long, low-pitched whistle. \"I don\u0027t know what on earth is the matter with me,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve never done anything like that before. I don\u0027t mean I\u0027ve been a saint. I wasâ€¦ last year there was someone I was involved with. But in my own house, God, and with my children at home. Sara could have walked right in on us. I\u0027d never have heard her.\" She smiled suddenly. \"I wouldn\u0027t have heard World War Three. You\u0027re a sweet man, Matthew. I don\u0027t know how this happened, but I am not going to make excuses for it. I\u0027m glad it happened.\"\\n\\n \"So am I.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know that you still haven\u0027t spoken my name? All you\u0027ve called me is Mrs. Broadfield.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d said her name once aloud and many times silently. But I said it again now. \"Diana.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s much better.\"\\n\\n \"Diana, goddess of the moon.\"\\n\\n \"And of the hunt.\"\\n\\n \"Of the hunt, too? I just knew about the moon.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder if it will be out tonight. The moon. It\u0027s getting dark already, isn\u0027t it? I can\u0027t believe it. Where did the summer go? It was just spring the other day and now it\u0027s October. In a couple of weeks my three wild Indians will put on costumes and extort candy from the neighbors.\" Her face clouded. \"It\u0027s a family tradition, after all. Extortion.\"\\n\\n \"Diana- \"\\n\\n \"And Thanksgiving is just a month away. Doesn\u0027t it seem as though we had Thanksgiving three months ago? Or four at the very most?\"\\n\\n \"I know what you mean. The days take as long to pass as ever, but the years fly by.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"I always thought my grandmother was crazy. She would tell me time passed much more quickly when you were older. Either she was crazy or she considered me a very gullible child because how could time possibly alter its pace according to one\u0027s age? But there is a difference. A year is three percent of my life and ten percent of Sara\u0027s, so of course it flies for me and crawls for her. And she\u0027s in a hurry for time to rush by, and I wish it would slow itself down a bit. Oh, Matthew, it\u0027s not all that much fun getting old.\"\\n\\n \"Silly.\"\\n\\n \"Me? Why?\"\\n\\n \"Talking about being old when you\u0027re just a kid yourself.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t be a kid anymore when you\u0027re somebody\u0027s mother.\"\\n\\n \"The hell you can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m getting older, Matthew. Look how much older I am today than yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"Older? But younger, too, aren\u0027t you? In one way?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"Yes, you\u0027re right. And I hadn\u0027t even thought of that.\"\\n\\n When my glass was empty I got to my feet and told her I\u0027d better be going. She said it would be nice if I could stay and I said it was probably a good thing that I couldn\u0027t. She thought about that and agreed it was probably true but said it would have been nice all the same.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be cold,\" she said. \"It cools off quickly once the sun is down. I\u0027ll drive you to Manhattan. Shall I do that? Sara\u0027s old enough to baby-sit for that length of time. I\u0027ll run you in, it\u0027s faster than the train.\"\\n\\n \"Let me take the train, Diana.\"\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll drive you to it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d just as soon walk off some of the booze.\"\\n\\n She studied me, then nodded. \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call you as soon as I know anything.\"\\n\\n \"Or even if you don\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"Or even if I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n I reached out for her, but she backed away. \"I want you to know I\u0027m not going to cling, Matthew.\"\\n\\n \"I know that.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to feel you owe me anything.\"\\n\\n \"Come here.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, my sweet man.\"\\n\\n And at the door she said, \"And you\u0027ll go on working for Jerry. Is this going to complicate things?\"\\n\\n \"Everything generally does,\" I said.\\n\\n IT was cold outside. When I got to the corner and turned north, there was a wind with a lot of bite to it coming right up behind me. I was wearing my suit and it wasn\u0027t enough.\\n\\n Halfway to the subway stop I realized I could have borrowed an overcoat of his. A man with Jerry Broadfield\u0027s enthusiasm for clothing was sure to have three or four of them, and Diana would have been happy enough to lend me one. I hadn\u0027t thought of it and she hadn\u0027t volunteered, and now I decided that it was just as well. So far today I\u0027d sat in his chair and drunk his whiskey and taken his money and made love to his wife. I didn\u0027t have to walk around town in his clothes.\\n\\n The subway platform was elevated and looked like a stop on the Long Island Rail Road. Evidently a train had just gone through, although I hadn\u0027t heard it. I was the only person waiting on the westbound platform. Gradually other people joined me and stood around smoking.\\n\\n It\u0027s theoretically illegal to smoke in subway stations whether they\u0027re above or below ground. Almost everyone honors this rule below the surface of the earth, and virtually all smokers feel free to smoke on elevated platforms. I\u0027ve no idea why this is so. Subway stations, above or below ground, are equally fireproof, and the air in both is so foul that smoke won\u0027t make it noticeably worse. But the law is obeyed in one type of station and routinely violated (and unenforced) in the other, and no one has ever explained why.\\n\\n Curious.\\n\\n The train came eventually. People threw away their cigarettes and boarded it. The car I rode in was festooned with graffiti, but the legends were limited to the now-conventional nicknames and numbers. Nothing as imaginative as WE ARE PEOPLE TWO.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t planned on fucking his wife.\\n\\n There was a point where I hadn\u0027t even considered it, and another point where I knew for certain that it was going to happen, and the two points had been placed remarkably close together in time.\\n\\n Hard to say exactly why it happened.\\n\\n I don\u0027t all that frequently meet women I want. It is a less and less frequent occurrence, either because of some facet of the aging process or as a result of my personal metamorphoses. I had met one such woman a day ago, and for a variety of reasons, some known and some unknown, I had done nothing about it. And now she and I would never have a chance to happen to each other.\\n\\n Perhaps some idiot cells in my brain had managed to convince themselves that, if I did not take Diana Broadfield on her living-room couch, some maniac would come along and slaughter her.\\n\\n The car was warm but I shivered as if I were still standing on the elevated platform exposed to the sharp edge of the wind. It was the best time of the year but it was also the saddest. Because winter was coming.\\n\\n Chapter 7\\n\\n There were more messages waiting for me at my hotel. Anita had called again and Eddie Koehler had called twice. I walked over to the elevator, then turned and used the pay phone to call Elaine. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-10.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) \\n Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
