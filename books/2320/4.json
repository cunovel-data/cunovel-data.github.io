{"id":97180,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"He looked just like his photographs. He\u0027d been all over the papers for the past few weeks, ever since he\u0027d begun cooperating with Abner Prejanian\u0027s investigation of corruption in the New York Police Department. But the news photos didn\u0027t give you the sense of height. He stood six-four easy and was built to scale, broad in the shoulders, massive in the chest. He was starting to thicken in the gut as well; he was in his early thirties now, and in another ten years he\u0027d add on another forty or fifty pounds and he\u0027d need every inch of his height to carry it well. If he lived another ten years. He said, \"Where\u0027s Doug?\" \"He left me at the door. Said you wanted to see me alone.\" \"Yeah, but the knock, I thought it was him.\" \"I cracked the code.\" \"Huh? Oh.\" He grinned suddenly, and it really did light up the room. He had a lot of teeth and he let me look at them, but the grin did more than that. It brightened his whole face. \"So you\u0027re Matt Scudder,\" he said. \"Come on in, Matt. It\u0027s not much but it\u0027s better than a jail cell.\" \"Can they put you in jail?\" \"They can try. They\u0027re damn well trying.\" \"What have they got on you?\" \"They\u0027ve got a crazy English cunt that somebody\u0027s got a hold on. How much do you know about what\u0027s going on?\" \"Just what I read in the papers.\" And I hadn\u0027t paid all that much attention to the papers. So I knew his name was Jerome Broadfield and he was a cop. He\u0027d been on the force a dozen years. Six or seven years ago he made plainclothes, and a couple of years after that he made detective third, which was where he had stayed. Then a matter of weeks ago he threw his shield in a drawer and started helping Prejanian stand the NYPD on its ear. I stood around while he bolted the door. I was taking the measure of the place. It looked as though the landlord had leased it furnished, and nothing about the apartment held any clues to the nature of its tenant. \"The papers,\" he said. \"Well, they\u0027re close. They say Portia Carr was a whore. Well, they\u0027re right about that. They say I knew her. That\u0027s true, too.\" \"And they say you were shaking her down.\" \"Wrong. They say she says I was shaking her down.\" \"Were you?\" \"No. Here, sit down, Matt. Make yourself comfortable. How about a drink, huh?\" \"All right.\" \"I got scotch, I got vodka, I got bourbon, and I think there\u0027s a little brandy.\" \"Bourbon\u0027s good.\" \"Rocks? Soda?\" \"Just straight.\" He made drinks. Neat bourbon for me, a long scotch and soda for himself. I sat on a tufted green print couch and he sat on a matching club chair. I sipped bourbon. He got a pack of Winstons out of the breast pocket of his suit jacket and offered me one. I shook my head and he lit it for himself. The lighter he used was a Dunhill, either gold-plated or solid gold. The suit looked custom made, and the shirt was definitely made to measure, with his monogram gracing the breast pocket. We looked at each other over our drinks. He had a large, square-jawed face, prominent brows over blue eyes, one of the eyebrows bisected by an old scar. His hair was sand-colored and just a shade too short to be aggressively fashionable. The face looked open and honest, but after I\u0027d been looking at it for a while I decided it was just a pose. He knew how to use his face to his advantage. He watched the smoke rise from his cigarette as if it had something to tell him. He said, \"The newspapers make me look pretty bad, don\u0027t they? Smart-ass cop finks on the whole department, and then it turns out he\u0027s scoring off some poor little hooker. Hell, you were on the force. How many years was it?\" \"Around fifteen.\" \"So you know about newspapers. The press doesn\u0027t necessarily get everything right. They\u0027re in business to sell papers.\" \"So?\" \"So reading the papers you got to get one of two impressions of me. Either I\u0027m a crook who let the Special Prosecutor\u0027s office get some kind of hammerlock on me or else I\u0027m some kind of a nut.\" \"Which is right?\" He flashed a grin. \"Neither. Christ, I been on the force going on thirteen years. I didn\u0027t just figure out yesterday that a couple of guys are maybe taking a dollar now and then. And nobody had anything on me at all. They been issuing denials out of Prejanian\u0027s office left and right. They said all along I was cooperating voluntarily, that I had come to them unasked, the whole number. Look, Matt, they\u0027re human. If they managed to set me up and turn me around on their own they\u0027d be bragging about it, not denying it. But they\u0027re as much as saying I walked in and handed it all to them on a platter.\" \"So?\" \"So it\u0027s the truth. That\u0027s all.\" Did he think I was a priest? I didn\u0027t care whether he was a nut or a crook or both or neither. I didn\u0027t want to hear his confession. He had had me brought here, presumably for a purpose, and now he was justifying himself to me. No man has to justify himself to me. I have trouble enough justifying myself to myself. \"Matt, I got a problem.\" \"You said they don\u0027t have anything on you.\" \"This Portia Carr. She\u0027s saying I was shaking her down. I demanded a hundred a week or I was going to bust her.\" \"But it\u0027s not true.\" \"No, it\u0027s not.\" \"So she can\u0027t prove it.\" \"No. She can\u0027t prove shit.\" \"Then what\u0027s the problem?\" \"She also says I was fucking her.\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah. I don\u0027t know if she can prove that part of it, but hell, it\u0027s the truth. It was no big deal, you know. I was never a saint. Now it\u0027s all over the papers and there\u0027s this extortion bullshit, and all of a sudden I don\u0027t know whether I\u0027m coming or going. My marriage is a little shaky to begin with, and all my wife needs is stories for her friends and family to read about how I\u0027m shacking up with this English cunt. You married, Matt?\" \"I used to be.\" \"Divorced? Any kids?\" \"Two boys.\" \"I got two girls and a boy.\" He sipped his drink, ducked ash from his cigarette. \"I don\u0027t know, maybe you like being divorced. I don\u0027t want any part of it. And the extortion charge, that\u0027s breaking my balls. I\u0027m scared to leave this fucking apartment.\" \"Whose place is it? I always thought Fuhrmann lived in my neighborhood.\" \"He\u0027s in the West Fifties. That your neighborhood?\" I nodded. \"Well, this place is mine, Matt. I\u0027ve had it a little over a year. I got the house out in Forest Hills and I figured it\u0027d be nice to have a place in town in case I needed one.\" \"Who knows about this place?\" \"Nobody.\" He leaned over, stubbed out his cigarette. \"There\u0027s a story they tell about these politicians,\" he said. \"This one guy, the polls show he\u0027s in trouble, his opponent is wiping the floor with him. So his campaign manager says, \u0027Okay, what we\u0027ll do, we\u0027ll spread a story about him. We\u0027ll tell everybody he fucks pigs.\u0027 So the candidate asks if it\u0027s true, and the campaign manager says it\u0027s not. \u0027So we\u0027ll let him deny it,\u0027 he says. \u0027We\u0027ll let him deny it.\u0027 \" \"I follow you.\" \"Throw enough mud and some of it sticks. Some fucking cop is leaning on Portia, that\u0027s what\u0027s happening. He wants me to stop working with Prejanian and in return she\u0027ll drop the charges. That\u0027s what it\u0027s all about.\" \"Do you know who\u0027s doing it?\" \"No. But I can\u0027t break it off with Abner. And I want those charges dropped. They can\u0027t do anything to me in court, but that\u0027s not the point. Even without going to court they\u0027ll have a departmental investigation. Except they won\u0027t be investigating a damn thing because they already know what conclusion they want to come up with. They\u0027ll suspend me immediately and they\u0027ll wind up kicking me out of the department.\" \"I thought you resigned.\" He shook his head. \"Why would I resign, for Christ\u0027s sake? I got better than twelve years, close to thirteen. Why would I quit now? I took a leave of absence when I first decided to get in touch with Prejanian. You can\u0027t be on active duty and play ball with the Special Prosecutor at the same time. The department would have too many openings to shaft you. But I never even thought about resigning. When this is over I expect to be back on the force.\" I looked at him. If he really meant that last sentence, then he was a whole lot stupider than he looked or acted. I didn\u0027t know his angle in helping Prejanian, but I knew he was finished for life as far as the police department was concerned. He had turned himself into an untouchable and he would wear the caste mark as long as he lived. It didn\u0027t matter whether the investigation shook up the department or not. It didn\u0027t matter who was forced to put in for early retirement or who went to slam. None of that mattered. Every cop on the force, clean or dirty, straight or bent, would mark Jerome Broadfield lousy for the rest of his life. And he had to know it. He\u0027d been carrying a badge for over twelve years. I said, \"I don\u0027t see where I come in.\" \"Freshen that drink for you, Matt?\" \"No, I\u0027m fine. Where do I come in, Broadfield?\" He cocked his head, narrowed his eyes. \"Simple,\" he said. \"You used to be a cop so you know the moves. And you\u0027re a private detective now so you can operate freely. And- \" \"I\u0027m not a private detective.\" \"That\u0027s what I heard.\" \"Detectives take complicated examinations to get their licenses. They charge fees and keep records and file income tax returns. I don\u0027t do any of those things. Sometimes I\u0027ll do certain things for certain friends. As a favor. They sometimes give me money. As a favor.\" He cocked his head again, then nodded thoughtfully, as if to say that he had known there was a gimmick and that he was happy to know what the gimmick was. Because everybody had an angle and this was mine and he was sharp enough to appreciate it. The boy liked angles. If he liked angles, what the hell was he doing with Abner Prejanian? \"Well,\" he said. \"Detective or not, you could do me a favor. You could see Portia and find out just how tied up in this she wants to be. You could see what kind of a hold they got on her and how we could maybe break the hold. One big thing would be finding out who it is that\u0027s got her filing charges. If we knew the bastard\u0027s name, we could figure out how to deal with him.\" He went on this way, but I wasn\u0027t paying too much attention. When he slowed to take a breath I said, \"They want you to cool it with Prejanian. Get out of town, stop cooperating, something like that.\" \"That has to be what they want.\" \"So why don\u0027t you?\" He stared at me. \"You got to be kidding.\" \"Why did you tie up with Prejanian in the first place?\" \"That\u0027s my business, Matt, don\u0027t you think? I\u0027m hiring you to do something for me.\" Maybe the words sounded a little sharp to him. He tried softening them with a smile. \"The hell, Matt, it\u0027s not like you have to know my date of birth and the amount of change in my pocket in order to help me out. Right?\" \"Prejanian didn\u0027t have a thing on you. You just walked in on your own and told him you had information that could shake up the whole department.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"And it\u0027s not as though you spent the last twelve years wearing blinders. You\u0027re not a choirboy.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-4.html","bookId":2320,"book":{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"Storyline: In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) Bad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.
