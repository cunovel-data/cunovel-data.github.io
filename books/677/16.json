{"id":18894,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI A NEIGHBORLY CALL","content":"At daylight there was hubbub, horseplay, and banter on the Double X. Art French climbed up into the chuck wagon (the cook\u0027s supply list in his pocket), banged on a huge pot, and announced that the race was on. Arch Wiggins, on this part of the journey, at least, had plenty of assistant horse wranglers, for the eight riders, Cimarron with the rest, herded the horses and started for the SV, happy as schoolboys on a lark. Reaching Gunsight, they caused quite some commotion, and fired into the air to give zest to the occasion. Dave mopped his beaded brow several times before his share in the festivities slackened, and Two-Spot, burning with a fever of curiosity, shuffled from the chuck wagon being loaded in front of Dailey\u0027s to the saloon, asking shrewd questions and making pertinent observations. \"An\u0027 why th\u0027 waggin?\" he asked Slim. \"To put Juniper in,\" answered that cheerful disciple of George Washington. \"We reckoned we\u0027d like to have a town closer to th\u0027 ranch, an\u0027 Gunsight ain\u0027t good enough.\" Two-Spot wandered around and put the question to Cimarron. The segundo regarded him with level gaze. \"It\u0027s[208] for th\u0027 widder\u0027s mite,\" he answered. \"We\u0027re on th\u0027 rustle, which ain\u0027t to be told.\" \"Huh!\" snorted Two-Spot, \"you might be aimin\u0027 for some widder, at that; but I\u0027m sayin\u0027 that if she sees you first, you\u0027ll need more\u0027n eight men an\u0027 a waggin to take her away from her home an\u0027 fambly. What are you aimin\u0027 to rustle?\" \"Every cow on a certain ranch between here an\u0027 Juniper,\" whispered Cimarron, looking stealthily around. \"Then don\u0027t you waste no time hangin\u0027 around here,\" warned Two-Spot, also looking stealthily around. \"Big Tom\u0027s gettin\u0027 up early these mornin\u0027s, I bets.\" Cimarron gravely shook his head, whereat Two-Spot remarked carelessly, apropos of nothing, \"Smitty has left th\u0027 range for good. He had two holes in his hat, th\u0027 upper hole like a coffeepot with th\u0027 lid back. He rode his own hoss, an\u0027 was goin\u0027 strong when he passed here. But nobody was chasin\u0027 him, then.\" \"Hey, fellers!\" shouted the segundo, joyously, \"Smitty has follered Squint, with a couple of gun-shot wounds in his Mex. hat!\" Laughter and cheerful remarks greeted the news, and Dave had to verify it. \"Bar H: mark two!\" cried Norris. \"Bring \u0027em up, you ropers—th\u0027 irons are hot!\" Two-Soot, despairing of gaining any real information in Dave\u0027s, shuffled out and went to Dailey\u0027s where Art French was putting the last of the provisions on the wagon. \"Hello French!\" greeted Two-Spot, putting a foot[209] on the spokes of a wheel. \"Where are you fellers headin\u0027 for?\" \"Up th\u0027 Juniper trail,\" answered Art. \"Want to come along? Have you got th\u0027 nerve to take a chance with somebody else\u0027s cattle?\" Two-Spot looked at him intently. \"What are you aimin\u0027 to do with \u0027em?\" he asked. \"What do folks usually do with cows that don\u0027t belong to \u0027em?\" countered Art. \"Holy mavericks!\" muttered Two-Spot. \"These here ijuts ain\u0027t carin\u0027 a whole lot who knows about it! What you got th\u0027 waggin for? Aimin\u0027 to squat out there an\u0027 steal \u0027em as fast as they grows up?\" \"That\u0027s for th\u0027 hides of them that gets killed. We\u0027re goin\u0027 to round up every hoof, clean and prompt.\" \"You didn\u0027t stop at th\u0027 Doc\u0027s on yore way up, did you?\" asked Two-Spot, paying no attention to the noise made by several men who had mounted and were riding toward the wagon at a walk. \"Why?\" \"Oh, nothin\u0027, only I reckon\u0027d mebby you\u0027d got some of them little white pills he shoots into hisself.\" \"Can you keep a tally?\" asked Art, carelessly. \"I can; but I won\u0027t.\" Art waved a hand at him. \"He can tally; but he won\u0027t.\" Three ropes dropped over the surprised ex-tally man and were drawn not unpleasantly tight. He thought it might be a joke, so he grinned; it would not do to let anyone think he took it seriously, because it might cause them to take it that way. \"Takes three men on[210] hosses to rope me,\" he jeered, chuckling. \"Better get th\u0027 rest of th\u0027 gang before I gets rough an\u0027 boisterous.\" \"Can you set a horse?\" asked Slim. \"I shore can\u0027t,\" regretted Two-Spot. \"It\u0027s one of th\u0027 sorrers of my life.\" \"Then we\u0027ll have to tie him on,\" said Wood. \"Chuck us out a couple of hobbles, Art.\" \"I can ride any hoss you can,\" boasted Two-Spot. \"I was bustin\u0027 \u0027em before you was borned.\" \"Then we\u0027ll hobble th\u0027 hoss,\" laughed Wiggins. \"Loosen \u0027em up; I hears Dave a-callin\u0027!\" exclaimed Two-Spot, suspiciously eager to answer duty\u0027s call. \"Where you aimin\u0027 to have him swing?\" demanded Art. \"Squint has got to be revenged.\" \"Th\u0027 first tree,\" growled Slim. \"We gives you one chance to save yoreself an\u0027 help rid this range of law-breakers. Who got Squint?\" \"You go to h—l!\" blazed Two-Spot as the ropes tightened. \"Take \u0027em off me!\" \"Who got Squint?\" repeated Slim, threateningly. \"If I tells, will you let me out of these cussed ropes?\" asked the shivering victim. \"We will!\" \"Smitty got him,\" chuckled the captive. \"Ask him if you don\u0027t believe me. Take \u0027em off, now!\" As soon as he was freed he danced away, wary and anxious, and bumped into Cimarron, whose muscular arms held him as in a vice. \"Now, what\u0027s th\u0027 matter?\" blazed Two-Spot, wriggling in vain. \"What you reckon yo\u0027re goin\u0027 to do?\" \"We need a tally man on this rustlin\u0027 expedition,\"[211] said Cimarron, \"an\u0027 we like yore looks. Bring up a cayuse, an\u0027 he can go bareback; either that or ride with Art.\" \"I\u0027m ridin\u0027 with Art if I goes, which I ain\u0027t aimin\u0027 to!\" snorted Two-Spot. \"I can\u0027t count up to more\u0027n ten,\" he protested. \"You won\u0027t have to count at all,\" Cimarron assured him. \"All you got to do is make little pencil marks like a picket fence on a piece of paper, or drop a pebble in yore hat for every cow. You can drop pebbles, can\u0027t you?\" \"Not very good,\" deprecated Two-Spot. \"I\u0027m too oncertain.\" \"Well, when yo\u0027re oncertain,\" chuckled Slim, \"yore chuck will be oncertain. Th\u0027 oncertainer you are, th\u0027 less you\u0027ll eat.\" Cimarron picked Two-Spot up and put him in the wagon, whereupon Slim and Wood rode up close to it, ropes in hand. \"There ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 oncertain about Slim\u0027s ropin\u0027, or Wood\u0027s, neither,\" warned Cimarron. \"You better stay right in that waggin.\" He turned to go to his horse. \"Come on, boys! We\u0027re startin\u0027 now!\" Dave went to a window to see them off, caught sight of Two-Spot\u0027s appealing face in the wagon, and hastened to the door and out toward the vehicle. \"Hi!\" shrilled Larry, his rope darting from his hand. \"Hi! Hi! Hi!\" yelled the others, their ropes going to the mark. \"What\u0027n h—l!\" shouted Dave, struggling, and[212] glaring around. He was the center from which four rope radii pointed to the cardinal points of the compass. \"Leggo me! Loosen \u0027em up, you coyotes! Loosen up!\" \"Does Two-Spot go with us?\" asked Larry. \"Can we borrow him for a few days, to keep tally for us on th\u0027 SV, Mr. Green?\" politely inquired Bud, tightening the rope. \"You can; an\u0027 go to blazes, for all I cares!\" snorted Dave. He loosened the ropes and lost no time in getting back to his window. \"Cuss \u0027em! All right; take him!\" he yelled at the noisy cavalcade. \"But if anythin\u0027 happens to him, you\u0027ll settle with Dave Green! You hear me?\" They did not. Margaret, responding to her brother\u0027s exited summons, went to the door and her hands flew to her breast. A wagon, loaded with packages, pulled up at the dilapidated corral and eight rough-looking men, driving a herd of horses, stopped near it. One of them kept on at a walk and approached her. Removing his sombrero, he pulled up and bowed. \"Ma\u0027am,\" he said, slowly and kindly, a smile wreathing his weather-beaten face, from which genial gray eyes twinkled at her; \"Ma\u0027am, we have come out to round up for you. We understand that this ranch ain\u0027t been combed for three years—an\u0027 it shore is time it was. I saw a wire fence north of th\u0027 trail: how far does it run?\" \"Why, why—I didn\u0027t know—we were not expect[213]ing any round-up. Isn\u0027t there some mistake?\" she faltered. \"I don\u0027t reckon there is, Ma\u0027am,\" Cimarron assured her. \"Mr. Nelson was tellin\u0027 us about th\u0027 SV, an\u0027 we all reckoned it was time there was a round-up run over here. You ought to know how many cows you got; an\u0027 mebby there\u0027s some as should be branded.\" \"I hardly know what to say—how to thank you,\" Margaret replied. \"Won\u0027t you come in and speak to father? He doesn\u0027t want to leave his bed for a few days more.\" \"Shore, Ma\u0027am,\" said Cimarron, dismounting and throwing the reins over the head of his horse, and following her into the house. \"Father, this is Mr.—Mr.—?\" she looked at Cimarron inquiringly. \"Quantrell—Cimarron Quantrell,\" he smiled. \"I was born on th\u0027 banks of th\u0027 Cimarron when they wasn\u0027t exactly safe for bein\u0027 born on, but our fambly was lucky.\" \"This is my father, Mr. Quantrell,\" smiled Margaret. \"I\u0027ll leave you men to talk by yourselves. If you want me, please call.\" \"Arnold,\" said Cimarron, with simple directness, \"we\u0027ve come out here, nine of us, from th\u0027 Double X, to round up for you. Nelson said you hadn\u0027t held none in three years, an\u0027 we reckoned it was time we was payin\u0027 you a neighborly call. When you get an outfit of yore own some day you can give us a hand. By helpin\u0027 each other we\u0027ll both be helpin\u0027 ourselves. How far does that wire fence run, up north of th\u0027 house?\" [214] \"Mr. Quantrell, I don\u0027t know how to thank you,\" replied Arnold \"I was growing to think there were no human beings in this country, but I\u0027m beginning to change my mind. Even Doctor Reed has had a change of heart.\" \"Don\u0027t you bank on th\u0027 Doc changin\u0027 his ideas,\" warned Cimarron. \"He come out here because he was made to come. He shore was plain kidnapped that night.\" \"You amaze me! Surely you are mistaken. Who would force him to come here?\" \"That ain\u0027t known,\" answered Cimarron, \"but everybody knows he was forced, all right. Th\u0027 fool says so, hisself.\" \"This is astonishing!\" \"How long did you say that wire was?\" \"Oh, yes; I forgot It\u0027s nearly a mile; why?\" \"I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to hold a herd ag\u0027in\u0027 it; it\u0027ll save men. Now, we\u0027re aimin\u0027 to start on th\u0027 west end first, before anybody knows what\u0027s up,\" and the segundo sketched the operations as he had planned them. Leaving as soon as he could, he was crossing the kitchen when Margaret stopped him. \"You told father about Doctor Reed coming against his will?\" she asked. \"Why, yes, Ma\u0027am; did I trample on anythin\u0027?\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter—only I hoped to keep that from him. It pleased him so to think the hostility was dying out.\" \"Ma\u0027am, I\u0027m shore sorry, but I didn\u0027t know that. An\u0027 it\u0027s all right, too, for th\u0027 hostility is dying out.\" [215] \"It\u0027s perfectly all right. Where do you expect to cook; and what are you doing with Two-Spot?\" \"We aim to cook on th\u0027 range, Ma\u0027am; an\u0027 Two-Spot is goin\u0027 to be our tally man. He was plumb tickled at th\u0027 chance to help.\" \"Can\u0027t you cook here? Or, better yet, can\u0027t I cook for you? I would like to do something.\" \"Well, at first we\u0027ll not be near enough to th\u0027 house for th\u0027 boys to have time to ride in for meals,\" Cimarron replied. \"You see, as we move over th\u0027 range, our cook moves with us, which saves time. Mebby when \u0027we work close at hand you can cook a meal for us—but I\u0027m sayin\u0027 that you don\u0027t know what yo\u0027re tryin\u0027 to get into. I\u0027ll be leavin\u0027 now, Ma\u0027am. If you hears anythin\u0027, or sees anythin\u0027 that you don\u0027t understand, don\u0027t you worry none. I\u0027m goin\u0027 out to start th\u0027 boys. Good afternoon. Ma\u0027am.\" She watched him join the riders and saw them, with chuck wagon and horse herd, drive down toward Green Valley, noisy with cheerful laughter and shouted jests. They passed around a hill and became lost to her sight, and soon the voices could be heard no more. \"Margaret!\" came an excited, impatient call from the front room. \"Yes, Father; I\u0027m coming,\" she answered, turning and entering the house. \"It begins to look like people are getting friendly,\" he exclaimed, smiles playing on his drawn face. \"Perhaps things will change, and we can make the ranch a success!\" \"\u0027Luck always turns,\u0027\" she smiled. [216] \"Are you getting to believe in luck?\" he demanded. \"\u0027I do; when somebody\u0027s behind it pushing hard,\u0027\" she replied, turning her face away. \"Are you crying my dear?\" he exclaimed, but she had left the room. While events were moving smoothly and swiftly on the SV, a new freight wagon rumbled north over the Highbank-Gunsight trail; and about the time that a circle of tired but happy punchers sat around a roaring fire on the west end of the SV ranch, the great wagon rolled around the corner of the hotel in Gunsight and the weary driver got down stiffly to put up and attend to his four-horse team. After becoming acquainted with George, and eating a hasty supper in the hotel, Jerry Wheatley went around to Dave\u0027s to make the acquaintance of that person and whoever else might be in the saloon, and to tell about Wolf Forbes and his trip to Highbank. He found the place quiet, but he left it full of hysterical laughter, wet eyes, sore sides, and some hiccups. And before he had gone to sleep, Dave\u0027s patrons were emulating some of the substantial citizens of Highbank in the avidity with which they sought strength from Dave\u0027s merchandise. An occasional burst of uproarious laughter brought the freighter back from the shadowy boundaries of sleep and set his bed shaking as he silently joined in. Realizing that Wolf\u0027s miseries were going to do more for him in the matter of getting acquainted along the way than a dozen ordinary trips up the trail would accomplish, he smiled contentedly and fell asleep.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56737.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
