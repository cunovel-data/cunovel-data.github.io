{"id":18887,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX ROLLING FASTER","content":"The next morning Johnny mounted Pepper and rode toward the SV. He had some thinking to do and chose the conditions which he had found were most conducive to clarity and continuity of thought—the saddle. As he left the town behind he took Pepper into his confidence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Little hoss,\" he muttered, \"we\u0027ve gone just about as far as we can go without stirrin\u0027 up active an\u0027 personal troubles. We can\u0027t play our hand much longer without folks knowin\u0027 what we are doin\u0027. What you an\u0027 me has got to do is plan things, choose th\u0027 leads, an\u0027 then stick to \u0027em in spite of h—l an\u0027 high water. An\u0027 we ought to figger on doin\u0027 somethin\u0027 solid for th\u0027 SV. Any fool can tear around an\u0027 smash things, an\u0027 we\u0027ve got to do that; but you an\u0027 me ain\u0027t satisfied with no worthless pile of rubbish; we got to smash so we can pan that rubbish, sort of, an\u0027 get somethin\u0027 out of it. An\u0027 when a feller pans free an\u0027 wide on a cattle range, he most likely will get cows. What else can he get? A man rocks gravel an\u0027 gets gold, if there\u0027s any gold in it. A puncher, rockin\u0027 ranches, ought to get cows. There ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 else to get. So we got to get cows, an\u0027 now we got to find out how many cows we want. We can\u0027t find out exact, but we can do better than guess at it. There\u0027s a limit to this[100] pannin\u0027 of ours—an\u0027 it ought to be what was lost an\u0027 stolen. There\u0027s only one place where we can find that out, an\u0027 we\u0027re ridin\u0027 that way now. Havin\u0027 decided what we\u0027re aimin\u0027 for, we\u0027ll let it rest an\u0027 turn to somethin\u0027 mighty close to us, ourselves; somethin\u0027 plumb personal, an\u0027 terrible riled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You remember Tex Ewalt, don\u0027t you? You ought to, because he said some mighty nice things about you; I was scared he\u0027d turn yore head. Now, Tex was a wise boy; he was amazin\u0027 wise. Do you remember what he told young Slim-Shanks, that there Baxter kid, who was all tangled up with tender feelin\u0027s? Mebby you don\u0027t; but I do. Slim-Shanks, he was fair wallerin\u0027 in misery, an\u0027 actin\u0027 like a sick calf. He hung around that gal\u0027s house like a dogie \u0027round a water hole. She must \u0027a\u0027 got sick of th\u0027 sight of him. Every place she looked, there was Slim-Shanks, an\u0027 his hope-I-die look. She couldn\u0027t get away from th\u0027 big calf. Tex never missed anythin\u0027, \u0027specially if it was under his eyes, an\u0027 one day young Slim-Shanks got bleatin\u0027 to him, moanin\u0027 an\u0027 groanin\u0027 about his busted heart. What did Tex tell him? I\u0027ll tell you. He says, slow an\u0027 deliberate: \u0027Slim-Shanks, some you got to rush; others you got to pique—an\u0027 th\u0027 best way to do that, in most cases, is to let \u0027em think you can look at \u0027em, an\u0027 not see \u0027em. It takes nerve—an\u0027 not one man in a hundred has got th\u0027 nerve. Make \u0027em keep a-thinkin\u0027 of you without chasin\u0027 after \u0027em. Yore medicine ain\u0027t no good—you might try th\u0027 other.\u0027 Now, just because Slim-Shanks didn\u0027t have th\u0027 nerve ain\u0027t sayin\u0027 Tex was wrong. I\u0027ve got to decide which way is best, an\u0027 it\u0027s tough ridin\u0027. Now you keep[101] right still while I wrestle this thing out,\" and he became so wrapped up in the problem that he paid no attention to where Pepper was going; and she took him to the vantage point on the valley\u0027s rim from whence he had looked down at the posts and their enclosed quicksands; and arriving there, she stopped. Johnny was aroused from his abstractions by a voice which brought him back in touch with his surroundings, and with a jerk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good morning,\" said Margaret. \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked up, hauled off his sombrero and muttered something, his face in one instant giving up his secret. Then by an act of will almost brutal in its punishment, he mastered his feelings and nodded calmly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good mornin\u0027, Ma\u0027am,\" he replied. \"You found me off my guard; I was miles away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why aren\u0027t you?\" she retorted, smiling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Meanin\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I were a man I\u0027d stay near my friends as long as I could.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I did, Ma\u0027am; but there was too many wimmin\u0027, so I drifted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! A woman-hater; or are you trying to forget?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They was all married,\" he grinned, \"that is, all that had any chance to be. They married my friends, which took down th\u0027 bars on me. I was fair game when there was any blame which should \u0027a\u0027 been saddled on their partners. So I drifted. You can\u0027t use a gun on a woman, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So you came down here to be a mystery?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mystery?\" he laughed. \"Me! Why, Ma\u0027am, I\u0027m so open I\u0027m easy pickin\u0027 in every poker game I sets[102] in. Folks know what I\u0027m goin\u0027 to think before I start thinkin\u0027 at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I must be even denser than I feared. I am very much interested in what you have been thinking, and haven\u0027t the slightest clue to it. Perhaps if I confess my helplessness you will take pity on me, and tell me what you are doing down here; and why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Th\u0027 \u0027why\u0027 shows you ain\u0027t guessin\u0027 much, Ma\u0027am,\" he replied, quizzically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why did you join that crowd of drunken rowdies, and act worse than any of them?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because when I acts bad, I\u0027m harmless, an\u0027 they was not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps; but why did you join them?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was afraid they might hurt themselves, or get lost.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Father says that we owe you a debt of gratitude; I\u0027m sorry that I shall have to disillusion him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t give him no shocks, Ma\u0027am, till his laig gets well. He ain\u0027t as young as he was.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why did you go to the trouble of seeing that we had supplies?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Invalids has got to eat. Ma\u0027am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why did you stop that—that brute—when he was entertaining his companions with his idea of humor?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A man would just naturally do that, Ma\u0027am; it\u0027s an instinct.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why did you do what you did the day, and night, that my brother was stopped from going to Highbank for the doctor?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [103] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A man would do that, too; an\u0027 any doctor that forgets his duty deserves to be stole an\u0027 made do it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You realize, of course, that you are getting yourself into great danger?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t hardly call it that, Ma\u0027am,\" he replied, smiling. \"There are different breeds. A man might get scared at a pack of wolves, an\u0027 not worry about coyotes, at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nevertheless, the danger exists; no man is proof against ambush. Why are you courting it?\" she persisted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Folks don\u0027t ambush till they\u0027re purty shore about things; an\u0027 tryin\u0027 to keep \u0027em from gettin\u0027 shore is th\u0027 hardest part of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why are you courting it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ma\u0027am, some things are so raw that they rile an honest man; I admits I\u0027m riled considerable, which, of course, don\u0027t prove me to be honest. Even Two-Spot says he don\u0027t know how many cows I\u0027ve rustled, nor how many trains I\u0027ve stuck up. Th\u0027 number might surprise him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Somehow I feel that I should thank you for the favors you have done us,\" she replied; \"but my opinion of western men, as I have found them, urges me to seek the motive first.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He flushed, and looked at her steadily. \"Mebby that\u0027s th\u0027 motive yo\u0027re askin\u0027 about,\" he said gravely, and slowly continued: \"You\u0027ve asked me a lot of questions; can I deal a few?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It depends on what they are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re personal—plumb personal. I\u0027m wantin\u0027[104] to know if Big Tom holds yore dad\u0027s note for three thousand dollars.\" He waited a moment and, receiving no reply, asked two in one. \"How many cows was on th\u0027 SV when you bought it, an\u0027 how many are on it now? Th\u0027 tally sheets ought to give that purty close—close enough, anyhow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Nelson, the first seems to be public knowledge. Mr. Huff holds my father\u0027s note for that amount. The number of cows, then or now, I do not know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is th\u0027 note endorsed, an \u0027what security was given?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I endorsed it. The ranch is in my name.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Uh-huh,\" commented Johnny. \"Do you know where th\u0027 tally sheets are?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you mean the books, they are on a shelf in the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ma\u0027am,\" he said, earnestly, \"I wonder if you would mind copyin\u0027 off what there is about th\u0027 number of cows on th\u0027 ranch after th\u0027 last trail herd left, th\u0027 year before you took possession? An\u0027 how many cows there was this spring, or th\u0027 number of calves branded then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why do you want this?\" she demanded. \"Why should I go to that trouble, or tell you such things?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he answered, \"less\u0027n you want to. You see, I\u0027m curious about things, too. It\u0027s a failin\u0027 most humans have, a bad failin\u0027. An\u0027, before I forget it, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to ask you another: Judgin\u0027 from them posts down there along th\u0027 river, that\u0027s a quicksand. Why ain\u0027t there more wire strung to keep th\u0027 cows out of it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because it is torn off as fast as it is put up. We have given up the effort; it is useless. If you only[105] knew—\" she checked herself, but the tears of helpless anger in her eyes could not be kept from forming. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s just it, Ma\u0027am—if I only knowed,\" he replied, nodding. \"I know a lot about that, but not about th\u0027 number of cows you have lost. I\u0027m what you might call morbid, an\u0027 like to grieve about calamities. Would you mind gettin\u0027 them figgers for me? I\u0027ll be here about ten o\u0027clock tomorrow for \u0027em, if you will.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; but why do you want them?\" she demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to put th\u0027 fear of God where it ain\u0027t been knowed for a long time, Ma\u0027am,\" he answered, \"an\u0027 be rewarded by th\u0027 company.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What company?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you that later, Ma\u0027am. It will be th\u0027 last thing to be told, an\u0027 you\u0027ll never guess it alone. You\u0027ll have to be helped. An\u0027 when I tell you, you\u0027ll be surprised, an\u0027 wonder how it was that you couldn\u0027t guess such a simple thing as that. I\u0027ll be leavin\u0027 you now, to keep on a-rollin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She looked after him longer than he was in sight, lost in the solving of the riddle, which grew more formidable the more it was attacked, unless the instinct of her sex was given a fairer hearing. It hammered and hammered for admittance and gained entry enough to cause a flush to steal across her face, and was instantly thrown out bodily. But if it was refused its day in court, it could at least stand outside the walls and make its plea, and so it did. Somehow, when she was in the presence of this man she felt a sense of security that was almost like a lullaby. His easy, graceful poise,[106] the quiet reverence which lay smiling behind his eyes and crept into his voice, the unobtrusive but unwavering confidence he had in himself, and the feeling of tremendous reserve power which emanated from his every word, look, and movement seemed almost to bathe her with peace and security. And for one instant his eyes had looked at her and made her go suddenly limp: she had felt suffocated, and the feeling had not been rebuked. Turning her pony\u0027s head, she rode slowly homeward, knowing that she would do whatever he requested, in spite of herself—and, strangely, she felt no fear. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny, the vortex of an emotional whirlpool, rode into Gunsight and dismounted before the Palace, the action purely a matter of habit. Suddenly he shook his head with savage energy. \"You fool!\" he growled. \"Keep yore mind on yore job, or somebody\u0027ll find you easy pickin\u0027!\" He looked around and saw Two-Spot grinning at him, and felt a quick irritation. \"Well,\" he demanded sharply, \"what\u0027s on yore mind?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two-Spot rubbed the disgraceful stubble on his face and grinned wider than before. \"I was just a-thinkin\u0027 you need a guardian,\" he retorted. \"Through with Pepper?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny regarded him unfavorably. \"A man usually gets what he needs, if he tries hard enough. Tote that away an\u0027 gnaw on it! I\u0027m through with Pepper.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two-Spot watched him enter the saloon, and reflectively scratched his chin. \"Mebby there is some meat on that bone, but he didn\u0027t have to call me no dog, did he? Cuss him an\u0027 his trick of leavin\u0027 me knots to untie. He\u0027s crazy—crazy as a fox!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56730.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
