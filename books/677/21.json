{"id":18899,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI THE MESSAGE","content":"Dailey, seated at a table, the everlasting pack of cards in front of him, beamed upon Fanning and Johnny as they entered. \"Thought mebby nobody was goin\u0027 to show up tonight,\" he said. \"Dave\u0027s scared of me.\" \n \n \"I never did care much for wild animals,\" retorted Dave. \"An\u0027 I says that you shore go wild when you sees a deck of cards. If you\u0027d only win somethin\u0027 once in a while, I wouldn\u0027t have a word to say.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s what makes him wild,\" chuckled Fanning. \"Ben, how much has Nelson taken away from you?\" \n \n \"Not very much, an\u0027 I more than got it back from th\u0027 others,\" retorted Dailey. \"If I only had his luck with my skill—but what\u0027s th\u0027 use?\" he asked, shrugging his shoulders. \n \n \"You shore has got to have plenty of luck with yore skill,\" jibed Dave, \"or you wouldn\u0027t even have a shirt left.\" \n \n \"Lemme ask you somethin\u0027 seein\u0027 that you know so much about poker,\" said Fanning. \"How far should a man back two pairs?\" \n \n \"Them assassins? You get up to this table, you scoffin\u0027 innocent, an\u0027 I\u0027ll show you when you ought to let loose of two pair,\" chuckled Dailey. \"Who\u0027s this comin\u0027? Fraser! Come over here, Bill, an\u0027 help me[280] rope a couple of tenderfeet into a little game of draw. They\u0027re shy tonight.\" \n \n \"Who\u0027s th\u0027 other, besides me?\" inquired Fraser, leaning against the bar. \n \n \"Huh!\" snorted Dailey. \"All right, then; help me rope in th\u0027 other two.\" \n \n \"If I\u0027m goin\u0027 to be yore come-on, what do I get out of it?\" laughed Fraser. \n \n \"Every cussed thing you can get an\u0027 hold onto, but you\u0027d better sand yore hands. Here\u0027s another sheep: Hello, Gurley! Yo\u0027re just in time to get a seat—I allus did like a five-handed game. Come on! Come on! Don\u0027t be afraid of th\u0027 iron!\" \n \n \"Make it four-handed for a little while,\" said Johnny. \"That\u0027ll give Dailey a chance to stack it up in front of him all ready for me. I ain\u0027t as good at draw as some down here, but I can allus take it away from Ben, somehow. How\u0027s things on th\u0027 Triangle, Gurley?\" \n \n \"Slowin\u0027 fast since them Double X fellers moved off. They made me wear out four cayuses a day. When will they finish up?\" \n \n \"Purty soon, I reckon,\" answered Johnny, turning to Fraser. \"You fellers are lucky. You don\u0027t get many strays over th\u0027 mountain, or through that canyon, I reckon.\" \n \n \"Not any that I\u0027ve noticed,\" replied Fraser. \"But we\u0027ve been plumb lazy in our round-ups. We got an awful sight of brandin\u0027 to do next time.\" \n \n \"That so?\" asked Johnny. \"Been takin\u0027 life easy an\u0027 lettin\u0027 \u0027em go?\" \n \n [281] \n \n \"Shore; that northwest section is so rough an\u0027 full of brush that it\u0027s near impossible to get \u0027em out. There must be an awful lot of unmarked animals over there. We\u0027re goin\u0027 to have our hands full with \u0027em.\" \n \n \"Aimin\u0027 to tackle it this fall?\" asked Johnny, carelessly. \n \n \"Mebby; mebby not. McCullough will save us from goin\u0027 up th\u0027 trail this year, so we might run a special combin\u0027 up out there.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m runnin\u0027 one right here!\" exclaimed Dailey, banging his fist on the table. \"I\u0027ll run a brand on you fellers that\u0027ll smart so you can\u0027t sleep. Come on, let\u0027s get a-goin\u0027. Hot iron! Hot iron! Ropers up!\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll just take a bite out of you,\" said Fraser. \"Anybody else hungry?\" \n \n \"I just ain\u0027t never had enough to eat,\" chuckled Fanning, dragging up a chair, \"not since I was a growin\u0027 kid—an\u0027 I ain\u0027t nowise shore that I had enough then.\" \n \n \"Which I says is frank, comin\u0027 from th\u0027 keeper of a hotel,\" laughed Gurley. \"I\u0027ve often felt th\u0027 same way when I ate in town. Turn it loose. I\u0027m on.\" \n \n \"Let me see,\" pondered Dailey, \"we deals five cards, don\u0027t we?\" \n \n \"We do; but only one at a time,\" replied Fanning patiently. \"Don\u0027t turn no trump.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s sorta comin\u0027 back to me,\" smiled Dailey, spreading out the cards to be cut to see who dealt \"It\u0027s sorta comin\u0027 back,\" he repeated. \n \n \"Then I\u0027m sayin\u0027 it\u0027s due to be laig weary, for it\u0027s goin\u0027 to have a long journey,\" remarked Dave. He looked up. \"Cuss it! Here\u0027s th\u0027 Doc! Hello, stranger![282] Shore, this is Gunsight. Hey, Dailey! he\u0027s got a whole satchel full; ring him into th\u0027 game.\" \n \n \"Bet he\u0027s got a wad of wool soaked with that there chloryfoam. Somebody ride herd on him,\" laughed Fraser, but he was tense. It was the first time anyone had seen the Doc and Johnny together since the kidnapping had been explained, and anything was possible. \n \n \"I\u0027m not collecting buttons,\" retorted the Doc, smiling. \"Hello, boys! Hello, Dave! Say, Fraser, I wish you would tell Big Tom not to send in the wagon for me; I\u0027ve changed my mind. I got a hurt leg, and it won\u0027t be right for nearly a week. Set out a round on me, Dave; I\u0027ll drink mine and hurry along. I just rode up to get word to Tom. Dave, you should use something milder when you load this whiskey—ever try nitric?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t you do it, Dave!\" expostulated Dailey in alarm. \"I can\u0027t hardly taste it now.\" \n \n The Doc looked at him, shook his head sadly, said good night, and went out. \n \n \"He didn\u0027t act like his laig was hurt,\" remarked Fraser wonderingly. \"But you can\u0027t never tell nothin\u0027 about him; he\u0027s a queer bird. An\u0027 changeable? There ain\u0027t no cussed word for it.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve often wondered how he made a livin\u0027,\" said Johnny curiously. \n \n \"Well, I\u0027ll be cussed!\" snorted Dailey incredulously. \"You have been here all this time an\u0027 don\u0027t know that? Huh! Th\u0027 Doc is a sort of self-actin\u0027 remittance man. He\u0027s got a wad banked back East, an\u0027 once a month I cash a check for him.\" \n \n [283] \n \n \"Two pairs,\" muttered Fanning, scratching his head, and telling the truth to mislead his opponents. \"That was what I was askin\u0027 about. Well, I\u0027ll see it an\u0027 add a blue.\" \n \n \"Any time you raise a blue, you got two pairs, all right!\" snorted Dailey. \"Two pairs, deuces up!\" He held up a finger warningly. \"I hears hosses\u0027 feets,\" he chuckled. \"Move over, Gurley, an\u0027 give th\u0027 visitors a chance to edge in.\" \n \n The sounds grew louder and soon stopped outside, and a laughing voice said, \"There\u0027s Dailey, th\u0027 hoss thief, tryin\u0027 to learn th\u0027 game. He\u0027s a persistent dummy, for he\u0027s allus tryin\u0027.\" \n \n \"He don\u0027t know one card from another,\" laughed a second voice. \n \n \"Hey!\" shouted Dailey. \"Come in here, you fellers, an\u0027 I\u0027ll show you how much I know!\" \n \n Slim appeared, followed closely by Larry and Arch. \n \n \"They ought to make you roll up yore sleeves, you mosshead,\" said Larry, grinning. \n \n \"Sit down there!\" ordered Dailey, \"an\u0027 I\u0027ll have you rollin\u0027 up th\u0027 bottoms of yore pockets!\" \n \n \"Wimmin\u0027 an children first,\" quoth Fanning. \"Come on, Larry.\" \n \n \"Did you hear that?\" snorted Larry, staring at him. \"I shore will, now!\" \n \n \"This is goin\u0027 to be pay-day for me,\" said Dailey in great content. \"Where th\u0027 devil are we at, anyhow?\" \n \n Over at the bar Johnny and Slim were carrying on a low-voiced conversation and figuring on a piece of paper, while Arch and Dave entertained each other at[284] the other end of the counter. After a few minutes Johnny nodded his head in quiet satisfaction, put the paper in his pocket and, going up for a few words with Arch and Dave, wandered over to the table and sat down close to it, leaning back to enjoy the fight. He always found keen enjoyment in watching the storekeeper play, for Dailey\u0027s red-brown face was suffused with wrinkles of good nature, quite independent of how his fortune tended; his high, shining forehead and the bald spot above and behind it reflected the light and glistened. The eternal cigar he chewed on, cold, stale, and odorous, bobbed animatedly and his shrewd black eyes peered out from under bushy eyebrows, glittering, glinting, and alive with his emotions, like twin mirrors on which were reflected the subtle complexities of a nature enriched by a life crowded with experiences. He had no poker face, but knowing the sad fact, he had made an adept liar out of the one to which Nature had given so much expression. \n \n He glanced at Johnny, his eyes dancing. \"Yo\u0027re comin\u0027 nearer th\u0027 candle all th\u0027 time, little moth,\" he laughed. \"I\u0027ll singe them wings of yourn—you see! My flush takes this game. Deal \u0027em up, Dailey,\" he grunted, raking in chips and cards. \n \n \"Come on, Nelson,\" said Fanning. \"Better get in this. Th\u0027 old hoss thief is stackin\u0027 \u0027em up for you.\" \n \n \"Huh!\" Johnny remarked. \"It ain\u0027t as big a pile as I was hopin\u0027. Oh, well,\" he sighed, \"I\u0027m like th\u0027 SV round-up: I take \u0027em as they come.\" \n \n \"How\u0027d they come to start that so early?\" asked Fanning. \"It\u0027s plumb warm for workin\u0027 hard.\" \n \n [285] \n \n \"Wanted to know how many head they had,\" answered Johnny. \"An\u0027 what do you know about workin\u0027 hard?\" \n \n \"He\u0027s seen me lots of times,\" cut in Dailey. \"Did they find out?\" \n \n \"Shore. They\u0027ve got twelve hundred an\u0027 twenty, which would be fourteen hundred an\u0027 fifty-five, if Arnold hadn\u0027t sold two hundred an\u0027 thirty-five head.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s good, considerin\u0027 how things has been let slide over there,\" remarked Fraser. \n \n \"Th\u0027 old figgers of three years ago,\" said Johnny, \"when Arnold took possession, were sixteen hundred an\u0027 eighty-five, in th\u0027 fall. Now, lemme see—do I need two or three?\" he mused. \"Reckon there ain\u0027t no use of throwin\u0027 away a nice, high card, so I\u0027ll take two. I\u0027m plumb fond of holdin\u0027 up a sider.\" He glanced at the two cards, slipped them into his hand and looked around. \"Now, I was askin\u0027 th\u0027 Double X what factor they used to figger natural increase—an\u0027 they says one to five. That right?\" \n \n \"That\u0027s allus been sort of gospel down here,\" said Fanning. \"For th\u0027 Lord\u0027s sake!\" he snorted, in playful pretense. \"You takin\u0027 eight cards again?\" \n \n \"You ain\u0027t got no right to ask nobody but th\u0027 dealer how many cards he takes,\" retorted Dailey. \"As a matter of fact, I only took seven. I\u0027m h—l-bent to get me a pair.\" \n \n \"You are dealing,\" declared Gurley. \"How many did you take?\" \n \n \"Three jacks,\" answered Dailey. \"If I only had th\u0027 other three mebby I\u0027d have a pair.\" \n \n [286] \n \n \"Which same I calls enlightenin\u0027 an\u0027 \u0027lucidatin\u0027,\" muttered Gurley. \"I demands a count of th\u0027 deck. But, speakin\u0027 of factors, I\u0027d say one to nine was nearer right, over on th\u0027 SV.\" \n \n \"Let him count th\u0027 deck,\" growled Fanning, \"before he gets worse. One to nine! I\u0027m sayin\u0027 one to five is close whittlin\u0027 down on this range. It\u0027ll come right eight out of ten. Well! well!\" he chuckled, as he looked at his card. \"Welcome, welcome, little stranger; how I wondered what you was! But I\u0027m not pressin\u0027 my luck too hard. I sees, an\u0027 trails.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m passin\u0027,\" sighed Johnny. \"Now I says that th\u0027 natural increase of them sixteen hundred an\u0027 eighty-five cows th\u0027 next year would be three hundred an\u0027 thirty-nine, usin\u0027 that gospel factor. Th\u0027 herd would finish th\u0027 second year with two thousand an\u0027 twenty-four. Usin\u0027 that gospel factor again, it would increase four hundred an\u0027 five, an\u0027 finish th\u0027 third year with twenty-four hundred an\u0027 twenty-nine. This is the summer of that third year, an\u0027 that twenty-four hundred an\u0027 twenty-nine ain\u0027t there. There\u0027s only twelve hundred an\u0027 twenty, which added to them that Arnold sold, makes fourteen hundred an\u0027 fifty-five. Now I figgers that fourteen hundred an\u0027 fifty-five from twenty-four hundred an\u0027 twenty-nine leaves nine hundred an\u0027 seventy-four head. That\u0027s what is missin\u0027—nine hundred an\u0027 seventy-four head. Call it nine hundred seventy. Cimarron O.K.\u0027s th\u0027 last tally figgers. Everybody but th\u0027 Bar H allows one to five is right. Where did them cattle go to?\" \n \n \"I call,\" growled Gurley. \"Kings up!\" \n \n [287] \n \n \"You can\u0027t never trust assassins,\" chuckled Dailey, laying down three tens. \n \n \"An\u0027 three tens ain\u0027t no good tonight,\" said Fanning, revealing an eight-full. \"Two pair ain\u0027t no good to bet on hard, but they\u0027re plumb fine to draw to. What you got, Fraser?\" he demanded. \n \n \"A headache,\" grunted Fraser, throwing down his hand. \n \n \"Deal \u0027em up, Fanning,\" said Dailey. \"Where did they go to?\" he asked Johnny. \n \n \"I\u0027ve gone over everythin\u0027 I can think of,\" replied Johnny, leaning back. \"I\u0027ve figgered hard winters, wolves, fever—there wasn\u0027t none of them. Strayed off? Where to? Would they leave Clear River for an arid stretch forty miles wide—an\u0027 stay away? They have to drink, don\u0027t they? Quicksands? Those that wandered in wouldn\u0027t be many, an\u0027 them that was drove in we\u0027ll count part of that nine seventy. Where did they go?\" \n \n \"Mebby they heard them angel voices callin\u0027,\" said Fanning, grinning. \n \n \"I\u0027m sayin\u0027 somethin\u0027 is plumb wrong down here,\" replied Johnny. \"Somebody has been ridin\u0027 th\u0027 line careless, an\u0027 a lot of mavericks has got across. Fraser, how many riders has Big Tom kept on his northwest lines?\" \n \n Fraser looked serious and pretended to ponder deeply. \"Only one—Wolf. An\u0027 he was allus payin\u0027 more attention to th\u0027 west line, facin\u0027 th\u0027 Snake Buttes country than he was to th\u0027 north line, though. All he could think of was rustlers. Cussed if he didn\u0027t near[288] sleep with \u0027em, he had \u0027em in his mind so strong.\" He did not see Slim\u0027s sneering smile or the look he exchanged with Arch. Slim was beginning to regard that outfit very much in that light. \n \n \"That\u0027s what I thought,\" replied Johnny, triumphantly. \"He wasn\u0027t ridin\u0027 sign at all—he was only lookin\u0027 for rustlers. An\u0027 while he was prancin\u0027 along that west line lookin\u0027 for Nevada, them mavericks was driftin\u0027 off th\u0027 SV to get in that brush where th\u0027 flies wouldn\u0027t bother \u0027em so much. That accounts for a lot of them unmarked cows you was speakin\u0027 about.\" \n \n \"Does look like mebby there\u0027s somethin\u0027 in that,\" cogitated Fraser. \"As I said, we never paid much attention to th\u0027 cattle out there; but it don\u0027t sound reasonable that all them SV mavericks would drift over onto us. An\u0027 why only mavericks?\" He thought for a moment. \"I\u0027m sayin\u0027 nothin\u0027, but there\u0027s somethin\u0027 plumb wrong, somewhere. Want me to ask Big Tom about it? Mebby it was rustlers—they\u0027re plumb active.\" \n \n Johnny considered. \"Well, you might,\" he said, slowly, leaning slightly forward in his chair. \"Tell you what, Fraser; I\u0027m dead shore about them nine hundred seventy. Suppose you tell him to brand that many mavericks, takin\u0027 \u0027em as they come, with th\u0027 SV mark, an\u0027 throw \u0027em over to Arnold when he holds his fall round-up? Th\u0027 SV will provide stampin\u0027 irons, an\u0027 a couple of men to help. As to rustlers, they\u0027d have to drive across th\u0027 Bar H an\u0027 th\u0027 Double X to get to Arnold\u0027s ranch—any rustlin\u0027 that was done would be done on th\u0027 fringes of th\u0027 Double X. Why, you fellers[289] ain\u0027t never been raided; an\u0027 to get to th\u0027 SV would be worse than gettin\u0027 to th\u0027 Bar H. That\u0027s what we\u0027ll do; we\u0027ll have him throw over nine hundred an\u0027 seventy head this fall, an\u0027 that\u0027ll make things right.\" \n \n Fraser boiled inwardly, but controlled himself. There had been no accusation, nothing to call for defense, and to take it angrily or as an accusation he felt would be to play into Johnny\u0027s hands. Being guilty of the very thing which the other had gone so carefully around, made him find the hidden meaning in the heavy circumlocution, and keep quiet about it for fear of revealing the real meaning of the words to the others in the room. He knew how Big Tom would take it, for he knew that his foreman was smouldering like a volcano, charged with the cumulative anger caused by recent events; and he felt sure that the news he would take back to the ranch that night would cause an eruption, and a great one. This was another reason for remaining calm: not knowing what Big Tom might decide to do, it would be well to give Johnny no cause to exercise any unusual caution, or to strike hard and suddenly. So he growled a little as he resumed the play. \n \n \"That\u0027s shore a whole lot of cattle to throw over to anybody, free, but, h—l!\" he said, \"it ain\u0027t no funeral of mine. It\u0027s Big Tom\u0027s business, \u0027though I reckon it\u0027ll sort of take his breath. Did Arnold say that?\" \n \n \"He\u0027s sayin\u0027 it through me,\" answered Johnny quietly. \"I\u0027m workin\u0027 for him, an\u0027 actin\u0027 for him, an\u0027 I\u0027m usin\u0027 my own judgment.\" \n \n Slim lounged into an easier position against the bar[290] and grunted. \"Well,\" he drawled, \"we\u0027re comin\u0027 to th\u0027 conclusion that th\u0027 round-ups down here has got to be general, spring an\u0027 fall. This here maverick business allus is a bad proposition, an\u0027 it\u0027s worse in th\u0027 kind of country that\u0027s plentiful on parts of this range. Sherwood is standin\u0027 out, set for a general drive. He says for all th\u0027 ranches to join hands, sweep th\u0027 whole range, do our brandin\u0027 an\u0027 divide up an\u0027 brand th\u0027 mavericks accordin\u0027 to some fair plan. I suggests dividin\u0027 \u0027em in proportion to th\u0027 number of cattle on each ranch, but that\u0027s only my idea. He goes even further, an\u0027 says that th\u0027 runnin\u0027 iron an\u0027 this brush brandin\u0027 we all have been doin\u0027 down here has got to be done away with, on th\u0027 Double X an\u0027 every other ranch in this section. Anybody knows that chutin\u0027 \u0027em, an\u0027 stampin\u0027 on th\u0027 brand is easier, an\u0027 that there ain\u0027t no honest reason for th\u0027 straight iron no more. Texas threw it into th\u0027 discard ten years ago or more. We\u0027re discardin\u0027 it, an\u0027 we\u0027re goin\u0027 to raise th\u0027 devil with any outfit that don\u0027t foller suit. That\u0027s flat, an\u0027 goes as it lays, regardless, to th\u0027 SV, th\u0027 Triangle, an\u0027 th\u0027 Bar H, with Sherwood\u0027s compliments.\" \n \n \"What about that nine hundred an\u0027 seventy, then?\" asked Gurley. \n \n \"We\u0027ve got nothin\u0027 to say about them, but if they are throwed over, th\u0027 rest will be divided,\" answered Slim. \"Bein\u0027 th\u0027 biggest ranch out here, we stand to lose more than any other by throwin\u0027 over them cows to th\u0027 SV; but we admits its title to \u0027em. Tell Big Tom to think it over, an\u0027 see us about it before fall.\" \n \n \"One to five is figgerin\u0027 too strong,\" remarked Gur[291]ley, thoughtfully. \"One to nine is nearer th\u0027 real figgers.\" \n \n \"There ain\u0027t no reason that I can see to change figgers that have proved themselves, time an\u0027 time again, down here,\" replied Slim. \n \n \"Havin\u0027 been talked plumb weak,\" growled Dailey, \"suppose we rest ourselves with a nice, quiet game? It\u0027s yore deal, Fraser. Comin\u0027 in, Slim?\" \n \n \"No, I ain\u0027t; I\u0027m goin\u0027 out,\" answered Slim. \"I got more than twenty miles an\u0027 I\u0027m tired. Comin\u0027, you fellers?\" he asked Larry and Arch. \n \n \"Shore,\" said Larry, arising. \"Glad to escape. Better come along, Arch—what\u0027s a few more miles?\" \n \n \"I\u0027d like to,\" replied Arch. \"Cuss it, I will! I can go to town th\u0027 next day. Good night, fellers.\" \n \n They made a noisy exit and soon their banter and laughter grew silent down the trail. Fraser stretched, and yawned prodigiously, and his friend Gurley became restless. \n \n Dailey, sensing the break-up of his beloved pastime, made an effort to save it. \"Don\u0027t bust up th\u0027 game, boys,\" he begged. \"I got a feelin\u0027 comin\u0027 over me that I can clean up th\u0027 whole pack of you. Let\u0027s see if I\u0027m right.\" \n \n \"Try it on th\u0027 rest of th\u0027 boys,\" growled Fraser. \"I\u0027m cashin\u0027 in what\u0027s left, an\u0027 dustin\u0027 up th\u0027 trail for my little bunk. Comin\u0027, Gurley?\" \n \n \"As far as th\u0027 partin\u0027 of th\u0027 ways,\" smiled the Triangle puncher, \"unless you aim\u0027s to ride home by way of our house, so I won\u0027t be lonesome. It\u0027s only a few miles out of yore way.\" \n \n [292] \n \n \"I\u0027m likely to,\" retorted Fraser. \"So-long, fellers,\" and he preceded his friend to the horse rail. \n \n The remaining four smoked and talked for a little while and then Johnny arose. \"Put them supplies in th\u0027 shed, Dailey?\" he asked. \n \n \"Shore; in a strong sack, like you said,\" replied the storekeeper. \"I put in a few more cans of tomatoes, seein\u0027 as they\u0027re handy when there ain\u0027t no drinkin\u0027 water near.\" \n \n \"Yo\u0027re usin\u0027 yore head,\" commended Johnny, and turned to Dave. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to th SV to let Cimarron\u0027s boys know that there\u0027s trouble comin\u0027, shore.
