{"id":18892,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV ENOUGH IS SUFFICIENT","content":"The following morning Johnny rode toward the northwest corner of the Bar H, the hilly, wooded section which had been presided over by Wolf Forbes. On his ride from the Bar H bunkhouse to the Triangle he had seen numerous unbranded cattle and wondered what he would find on the difficult section over which Wolf was wont to hold jealous guard. Riding to the west of the town he then turned and went south, passing behind the Doc\u0027s cabin, and parallel with the over-mountain trail. Reaching Clear River he followed it onto Double X range and then let Pepper pick her way over the mountain, and soon came to his objective, where he found large numbers of cattle, with an unusually high percentage of mavericks among them. \"Pepper,\" he said, alert for signs of Bar H riders, \"th\u0027 SV has lost a lot of cows—an\u0027 folks can\u0027t make cows. So if it\u0027s goin\u0027 to make up its losses, it will have to do it with cows that are livin\u0027 this very minute. Now, it ain\u0027t reasonable to go on a ranch an\u0027 round up a lot of unbranded cattle, \u0027specially if it ain\u0027t willin\u0027 for \u0027em to be rounded up. On th\u0027 other hand, there ain\u0027t no harm in ridin\u0027 around an\u0027 sizin\u0027 things up. We want to find out where th\u0027 mavericks are, an\u0027 get some idea of how many there are of \u0027em. \"Mebby you don\u0027t know it, but a lot of mavericks[174] means, generally, a lazy outfit, not to say nothin\u0027 worse. An\u0027 when a ranch reckons it\u0027s fenced off by natural barriers from other herds, that don\u0027t excuse \u0027em. A dishonest foreman or outfit, or a couple of dishonest men in it, can get rich with mavericks, if they know their business, an\u0027 don\u0027t work too hard. An\u0027 if th\u0027 whole outfit is dishonest an\u0027 workin\u0027 for its ranch, mavericks belongin\u0027 to surroundin\u0027 ranches are awful temptations. \"Now, th\u0027 SV don\u0027t earnotch its calves. They don\u0027t have no sleepers, at all; an\u0027 I know that calves will wander from their mothers after they are weaned, an\u0027 get notions of their own; an\u0027 they can be cut out an\u0027 drove to another range an\u0027 grow up to be big cows. On a ranch like th\u0027 SV, that ain\u0027t had no round-up in three years, all calves will be mavericks. There won\u0027t be a sign on none of \u0027em to tell where they belongs. \"Now, then: We\u0027ll say th\u0027 Bar H is dishonest, but its foreman an\u0027 outfit is workin\u0027 for th\u0027 ranch an\u0027 not for their own pockets. If they drove SV calves to their own ranch, they\u0027d put an iron on \u0027em as soon as they could, after which they wouldn\u0027t have to bother with \u0027em no more. They wouldn\u0027t have to be guarded jealous by th\u0027 best man of th\u0027 outfit, an\u0027 turned back when they tried to get off th\u0027 ranch. When I heard how Wolf almost lived out here, I got suspicious, Pepper; an\u0027 when I saw too many mavericks on this ranch, I got more suspicious; an\u0027 you\u0027ve mebby heard that I was brought up in a plumb suspicious outfit. Of course, all ranches are goin\u0027 to have some mavericks, \u0027specially if it has a wild, rough range. Brush, timber, scrub, an\u0027 broken country hides cows that don\u0027t get combed out[175] in a round-up; we had some, ourselves, down on th\u0027 old Bar-20, along our west line—but th\u0027 numbers out here are scandalous. I\u0027m keepin\u0027 cases on these cattle, an\u0027 I says it\u0027s so scandalous that it just can\u0027t be true—but it is true, so far. There\u0027s folks down here that are careless an\u0027 lazy, or crooked an\u0027 I\u0027ve got my suspicions about which it is. \"Now, we\u0027ll say that th\u0027 outfit is crooked, an\u0027 workin\u0027 for its own pockets. They wouldn\u0027t want to brand any mavericks, not with th\u0027 ranch mark. There\u0027s two ways of dividin\u0027 that conclusion. First: That they\u0027re doin\u0027 it for their own pockets, th\u0027 foreman not knowin\u0027 about it. But no foreman is so dumb that he\u0027d overlook so many mavericks—he\u0027d raise h—l, an\u0027 weed out his punchers an\u0027 get new men. There wouldn\u0027t be many cows unbranded if he was workin\u0027 for his ranch. Th\u0027 second is: Foreman an\u0027 outfit are workin\u0027 for themselves, dividin\u0027 up th\u0027 profits accordin\u0027 to some plan. Then nobody would care how many mavericks there was, for th\u0027 more th\u0027 merrier. They\u0027d have a right smart herd to brand with th\u0027 mark of some friend\u0027s ranch, road brand, an\u0027 throw on th\u0027 trail for some shippin\u0027 point up north, near th\u0027 railroad. Or mebby they figger on stockin\u0027 a ranch of their own that they has in some other part of th\u0027 country. Rustlers plumb love mavericks—an\u0027 if I was one, an\u0027 wanted to get rich, I know where I\u0027d start out. An\u0027 if it wasn\u0027t for th\u0027 Double X layin\u0027 between this ranch an\u0027 th\u0027 Snake Buttes country, them rustlers over there would give this outfit sleepless nights. Them Double X punchers bein\u0027 on th\u0027 job all th\u0027 time is all that saves these here mave[176]ricks from swappin\u0027 ranges. Th\u0027 Double X is workin\u0027 for this passel of thieves, an\u0027 don\u0027t know it. \"Now, then: These mavericks out here are mostly all three years old, or younger. There\u0027s some four-year-olds, an\u0027 others, of course. An\u0027 th\u0027 SV ain\u0027t had a calf round-up in three years. Ain\u0027t that remarkable? Th\u0027 Bar H owners get good reports every round-up. Th\u0027 new calves keep right up to th\u0027 factor of natural increase, an\u0027 there ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to make anybody jump out here for a good look at things. An\u0027 when th\u0027 drive figgers go on, an\u0027 show five hundred cattle on th\u0027 beef trail, an\u0027 really there is a thousand, th\u0027 books balance just right; an\u0027 Big Tom gets a Christmas present from th\u0027 owners for bein\u0027 such a good, honest foreman. Where that extra five hundred head goes to nobody knows but th\u0027 outfit. I\u0027ve heard that Wolf is th\u0027 segundo down here, an\u0027 is trail boss on every drive. Do you wonder he\u0027s jealous of his mavericks out here, an\u0027 watchin\u0027 day an night for some of them Snake Buttes rustlers to bust through th\u0027 Double X riders an\u0027 pay this section a visit? Him bein\u0027 so alert was another reason why I packed him off to Highbank for a day or two, where he can have excitement, an\u0027 there\u0027s things to do an\u0027 see. An\u0027 while he\u0027s enjoyin\u0027 th\u0027 hilarity of town, we\u0027ll have a good look around. Pull up, Pepper, there\u0027s hoss tracks—fresh, too. They was made while th\u0027 mornin\u0027s dew was heavy, which is told by th\u0027 little chunks of dirt his hoofs picked up an\u0027 turned over. You stay right here while I go ahead. Lay down!\" He slapped the horse and gave a low, peculiar whistle. Pepper laid her ears back, but slowly obeyed the signal[177] and went down, \"playing dead\" on her side. Taking his rifle, Johnny slipped into the brush, following a course parallel to but some distance from the tracks. For an hour he trailed, seeing numbers of mavericks and but few branded cattle, and twice he was in danger of being charged by crusty, old long-horned \"outlaws\" who, while having a due and well-founded respect for mounted men, evidently regarded a man on foot as being a different and less dangerous species of animal. These he eluded by taking to the brush and swiftly getting out of sight, detouring and picking up the trail again farther along. Suddenly he stopped and laughed silently. On the farther side of a clump of brush a conical, vertically dented Mexican sombrero loomed against the sky. Waiting a moment to be sure that he had not been heard, he raised the rifle and took long, deliberate aim. With the roar of the gun the peak of the hat flipped up and over, reversing itself as if on a hinge, and hung down on the side of the high crown like a cup. There was a yell of surprise, the hat dipped down below the shielding brush, and the sudden noise of pounding hoofs rolled toward East Canyon. Johnny reloaded and ran to a place from where he could see the fleeing horseman. It was Smitty, and he was mounted on his own horse, a long-legged, big-barreled roan, and it was fresh from a three days\u0027 rest. The speed it made awakened a surprised admiration in the laughing rifleman, who watched the departing horseman until he dashed into East Canyon. \"Thanks, Smitty,\" chuckled Johnny. \"I\u0027m glad you ain\u0027t headin\u0027 for th\u0027 bunkhouse. Now I won\u0027t be both[178]ered by no curious outfit combin\u0027 these hills, lookin\u0027 for me. Reckon Smitty is goin\u0027 to town—or he never would \u0027a\u0027 rode for th\u0027 canyon. Just th\u0027 same, I\u0027m leavin\u0027 for th\u0027 Double X. I\u0027ve seen all I wants out here, an\u0027 now I\u0027ll try to fix up a round-up for th\u0027 SV, an\u0027 get the rest of th\u0027 figgers I needs.\" He returned to the horse and rode into the northwest, giving vent to occasional bursts of laughter. \"Pepper,\" he chuckled, as he rode down the other slope of the watershed, \"we\u0027re havin\u0027 more fun down here than we had up around Twin Buttes, but th\u0027 show ain\u0027t hardly begun. However, we\u0027ll laugh while we can, an\u0027 meet trouble when it really comes.\" Smitty pounded into and through East Canyon, busy with his crowded thoughts and harrowed feelings. His horse from habit chose the left-hand turn at the other end of East Arroyo, and swung around the bend toward Gunsight. \"Twice!\" he soliloquized. \"Twice in th\u0027 hat! He was close up, th\u0027 murderin\u0027 coyote—sneaked up on top of me when I was so far away from th\u0027 mountain I had plumb forgot him. Sneaked up to th\u0027 other side of that brush—couldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 been forty feet away—an\u0027 he missed again! You can\u0027t tell me he didn\u0027t aim to miss, not this time. An\u0027 I\u0027m dead shore he aimed to miss me that other time. Why? Because he didn\u0027t want to hit me, yet! It was a warnin\u0027, it was. He says plain: \u0027Smitty, you ain\u0027t wanted around here no more. I\u0027m warnin\u0027 you th\u0027 second time. But, mebby, th\u0027 third time I won\u0027t miss.\u0027 I\u0027m sayin\u0027 there won\u0027t be no third time. Practice makes perfect, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t no target.[179] He won\u0027t score no bulls-eye on me! Big Tom says it\u0027s a joke; all right; but if it is, it ain\u0027t goin\u0027 no further. An\u0027 th\u0027 reason is, I am. I\u0027m goin\u0027 further, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t comin\u0027 back. I ain\u0027t even wastin\u0027 time to go back to th\u0027 house for my war bag, an\u0027 have to give \u0027em an argument about quittin\u0027. There ain\u0027t much pay a-comin\u0027 to me—none, when I pays up what I owe—an\u0027 I\u0027m callin\u0027 everythin\u0027 square, all around. Pore Squint! Huh; I\u0027d rather be able to say \u0027Pore Squint\u0027 than hang around here till somebody up an\u0027 says \u0027Pore Smitty.\u0027 This here country ain\u0027t fit for a dog no more an\u0027 I\u0027m goin\u0027 to find one that is. Keep a-goin\u0027, you long-laigged rabbit!\" He whirled over the rocky hump below the historic stone benches on Pine Mountain and streaked toward Gunsight, seeing the Doc come to the door of the shack and wave at him. The Doc was haggard and sallow, nervous and poorly nourished after an unfavorable bout with his worst enemy, and leaned weakly against the door casing as he watched the hard-riding puncher whirl toward him. He made up his mind that if Big Tom wanted to see him, Mahomet could come to the mountain, for he was in no condition to go afield. To his surprise and great relief, Smitty followed the bend in the trail and headed to ride past. Then it was that Doc waved again. Smitty\u0027s hand went to his nose and he shouted a greeting and prophecy in three words. The Doc, unstrung and highly irritable, took enraged umbrage at the insulting greeting, jerked the Colt from its shoulder holster and took three erratic shots at the derisive[180] rider, followed almost instantly by three more. Smitty\u0027s anger flared up and centered on this tangible escape valve. Shooting at him seemed to be the fashion these days, but it had to stop. There were five rapid reports and five puffs of smoke, spaced at regular intervals along the trail behind his horse. He was lucky in his off-hand shooting, for all of the bullets found a target. One smashed the Doc\u0027s window, already cracked; one drilled a hole through the edge of the door behind him; one turned his water bucket into a sprinkling can, and the other two screamed past him into the room and accounted for a dishpan and his lamp. The owner of the aforesaid articles waxed wrathy and indignant, and jumped up and down, making strange noises; then, running after the irritated puncher, tried in vain to find the chambers of his six-gun with the wrong ends of a handful of cartridges, at the same time indulging in a spirited monologue, which was jumpy and spasmodic from shortness of breath. Smitty turned in the saddle and let loose an insult which cannot be excelled in words, wig-wagged again, and flashed up the gentle slope toward town. Gunsight heard him coming, and those inhabitants who suspected that strange things were likely to happen, made haste to look out and see what it was. Dailey chose his doorway, Dave an open window, while Two-Spot wished to be unhampered by walls and roof, and chose his favorite hang-out, the front of the saloon. \"Where you goin\u0027 so fast?\" shouted Dailey, pleasantly curious. He became instantly indignant at the gesture which answered him, and the words which fol[181]lowed the action left no doubt in his mind that he had interpreted it correctly. He reached for his gun, thought better of it and, shaking a fist, shouted instead: \"All right! But you\u0027ll be comin\u0027 back, cuss you!\" and forthwith reached toward the gun again at the shouted answer he received. Two-Spot saw the felt cup flapping up and down at the edge of the sombrero\u0027s peak and he let out a howl of pleasure at the sight, whereat Dave discreetly ducked back from the window, fearing Smitty\u0027s reply; but the puncher kept on ahead of his dust cloud and whirled over the trail toward Juniper. Two-Spot shouted with laughter. \"Did you see th\u0027 hat? Did you see it? Just what I was sayin\u0027,\" he cried, delighted by the idea that his humorous conception had appealed to another. \"Number Two, an\u0027 Smitty pulls his stakes. Hey, Dailey!\" he shouted, \"you says he\u0027ll be comin\u0027 back; I\u0027m sayin\u0027 he won\u0027t. I\u0027m bettin\u0027 we won\u0027t see Smitty no more. He\u0027s takin\u0027 what\u0027s left of his hat where it won\u0027t be spoiled no more. Did you notice th\u0027 hoss he\u0027s on? That ain\u0027t no Bar H critter; that\u0027s his own! I\u0027m givin\u0027 you two to one he won\u0027t come back—two to one, you gapin\u0027 jackass!\" Dailey\u0027s open mouth closed suddenly, and he stepped forward, feeling for his gun again; but Two-Spot went around the corner of the saloon, kicking his heels together. \"He won\u0027t come back! Squint, Polecat, an\u0027 Smitty! Wonder who else will be missin\u0027? Three in a row—if Polecat stays away. But Polecat won\u0027t, cuss him. I know him too well for that. He won\u0027t—and I\u0027ll be glad of it, too, th\u0027 coyote. Who\u0027s next?\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56735.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
