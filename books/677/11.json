{"id":18889,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI \"THE TINKLING OF THE CAMEL\u0027S BELL\"","content":"Johnny had a late breakfast, according to George. \"You look like you made a night of it,\" said the cook. \"I reckon I did,\" replied Johnny, yawning; \"I didn\u0027t get much sleep.\" \"Did Wolf make any remarks about shootin\u0027?\" \"When?\" \"Last night.\" \"Didn\u0027t you see him start for home?\" \"Thought mebby he come back to play.\" \"He didn\u0027t come back to play,\" replied Johnny. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 for a ride an\u0027 see if I can wake up,\" he said, and he did. As he loped along the Juniper trail he made a confidante of Pepper. \"Dearly Beloved,\" he muttered, \"we are goin\u0027 to be th\u0027 center of a whole lot of eyes before long. People will pay attention when they sees us. We are going to be right popular—an\u0027 unpopular. If you knowed all th\u0027 trouble I\u0027m brewin\u0027 for us, you\u0027d reckon I wasn\u0027t no friend at all. But I know yo\u0027re with me to a finish, an\u0027 not worryin\u0027 about whose finish it\u0027s goin\u0027 to be. I\u0027ve got to do some thinkin\u0027. You listen. \"Wolf was sent up to find out who\u0027s been ticklin\u0027 th\u0027 Bar H with a prong, an\u0027 he didn\u0027t have no luck.[131] Knowin\u0027 he was losin\u0027 patience, I knowed what a man like him would do when he came to th\u0027 end of it. He\u0027d pick a fight an\u0027 start shootin\u0027. Now you know I ain\u0027t scared of Wolf, but you don\u0027t know that I wasn\u0027t ready to start no open war just yet. I\u0027ll admit I hope I don\u0027t have to start none, but I wouldn\u0027t bet two bits on that. So what did I do? I sent him away, Pepper, but he\u0027ll come back. Uh-huh, he\u0027ll come back if he\u0027s got th\u0027 nerve—an\u0027 it\u0027ll take some. An\u0027 if he does you an\u0027 me\u0027ll have to step around right lively. If he figgers right he\u0027ll come back a-shootin\u0027, for he\u0027ll be all riled up. I couldn\u0027t have him trailin\u0027 me wherever I went, could I? Th\u0027 man wasn\u0027t reasonable—he didn\u0027t allow I had any rights. \"Now, then: Wolf won\u0027t be back before tomorrow mornin\u0027. I\u0027m bettin\u0027 he won\u0027t be able to sit a saddle before mornin\u0027, an\u0027 that brings him here tomorrow afternoon. Th\u0027 Bar H won\u0027t hunt for him, thanks to what you helped me do last night. If they find his cayuse without his saddle they\u0027ll think he come down an\u0027 got a fresh hoss. An\u0027 all we want is to see that little Peggy girl, an\u0027 go over to th\u0027 Double X. Then we\u0027ll turn th\u0027 Bar H upside down, an\u0027 let Wolf square up for his buggy ride if he wants. An\u0027 I\u0027ll give odds that he\u0027ll want to.\" When he reached the rendezvous he was early and he grinned as he realized his unusual impatience. \"Pepper, things are shore happenin\u0027 to me. I\u0027m what you might call sober-drunk. Just settin\u0027 here quiet, lookin\u0027 at that little valley is plumb thrillin\u0027, little hoss—an\u0027 would you cock an eye at that gent down there![132] An\u0027 cussed if there ain\u0027t a cow in them sands! I reckon, mebby, it\u0027s goin\u0027 to be real thrillin\u0027 before long.\" He jammed his sombrero tight on his head and waited, tense and eager for the overt act he felt sure would come, and send him down the hill like the swoop of a hawk. Down in the valley Lang looked searchingly around and then, tying his rope to the remaining strand of wire, urged his horse ahead. He was standing up in the stirrups, his weight on one leg, leaning to one side to keep the rope from pressing against his other leg, his back to the hill, and he did not see the black thunderbolt dropping down the green slope; and so intent was he upon the work in hand that his ears did not give him warning of the charging enemy in time to attempt deliberate and well-sighted long-range rifle shooting. The wire had been torn loose from the first post and was straining at the staples in the next one before he had any intimation of the swiftly approaching danger. Surprised and galvanized into action by the sound of rolling hoofs pounding over a stretch of bare, hard ground, he turned in his saddle, flung a glance at the racing thoroughbred and jerked his rifle from its sheath. His horse, feeling the rope rub against one of its hind legs, kicked viciously and pranced. Twisting from one side to the other, rifle at his shoulder, Lang found himself in too awkward a position for well-aimed shooting against the racing enemy, who lay along the back of his horse and presented a discouragingly small target. Sliding the rifle back into the sheath, Lang worked desperately at the rope, trying to free it from the sad[133]dle. Cursing his clumsy fingers, he suddenly realized the trouble. \"D—n my soul, if somebody ain\u0027t knotted it! Oh, th\u0027 cussed fool!\" Giving up the attempt, he reached again for the rifle, swiftly changed his mind and pulled angrily on the reins to back his horse so he could get the other end of the rope and free it from the wire. \"Staked out like a calf!\" he gritted. Hauling in the rope, he at last grabbed the knot, and swore again. It had pulled so tight that precious seconds were wasted before he could free it, and his temper was not sweetened any by the two bullets which Johnny, firing at long range, sent on a gamble. They missed him by feet, but had their effect. Dropping the freed wire, he spurred around to face the swiftly nearing danger and jerked out his Colt, firing hastily. Johnny now was standing up in his stirrups to offset the bouncing of the horse and his shots were coming nearer all the time. Lang swerved his horse suddenly and fired again, but the animal was prancing. Johnny\u0027s reply struck the horse and the pain-racked animal, leaping convulsively, bolted for the gap between the posts, straight for the quicksands. Lang, frantic at this new danger, fought the animal with one hand, trying desperately to turn it, and used the gun with his other hand, doing neither well. Johnny, drawing his second Colt, replied to Lang\u0027s last shot and the Triangle puncher, dropping his weapon, sagged forward in the saddle and fell sideways into a grassy hollow, where he sprawled grotesquely as his horse, freed of his weight, leaped forward at greater speed and dashed out onto the treacherous sands, stopping[134] only when it became mired beyond the possibility of further progress. It floundered and strained with frantic energy until exhaustion made it pause, and then stood trembling, doomed by the inexorable sands which slowly crept up its quivering legs and caused its eyes to become wide with terror. Johnny flashed past the prostrate puncher and then suddenly became aware of his danger. Pepper, holding her speed, kept straight on for the sandy trap. Johnny tried to swing her and she responded, but not enough in the restricted space and when he had pulled her back on her haunches she had crossed the quicksands\u0027 edge and slid, wallowing and struggling, to a stop far from safety. Her instinct warned her of her peril and she struggled frantically to retrace her steps, but succeeded only in turning part way and had to give up the fight momentarily, with her side to the firm ground she had just quitted. Panting and shaking with terror, she looked around appealingly at her rider, who shook his head. \"No use, Pepper Girl,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll only get in deeper. Rest yourself an\u0027 wait—I\u0027m th\u0027 only one who can help you now—an\u0027 I never thought I\u0027d do a thing like that to you; an\u0027 I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to do it till I has to. Good little cayuse—th\u0027 best I ever laid eyes on, an\u0027 I\u0027ve seen th\u0027 best there was. We\u0027ve had our last ride together, little hoss, an\u0027 mebby we\u0027ll go down together, too. Easy, girl; easy,\" he coaxed, and not wholly in vain. \"You just rest an\u0027 mebby we\u0027ll make another try after I see what there is to be seen. We got th\u0027 coyote that caused it, anyhow!\" [135] His words were contradicted almost as soon as spoken, for a derisive voice from the grassy hollow rang out in exultant laughter. Johnny, fearing a shot, although the fear was from instinct rather than from reason, fired instantly at the sound, and then lowered the gun. Lang was unarmed and could not get to his Colt without exposing himself. \"He won\u0027t get it while I\u0027m alive,\" muttered Johnny, reloading his other gun. \"Shoot!\" exulted Lang; \"but you better save th\u0027 last for yoreself. That\u0027s right, shoot!\" he jeered, as Johnny, stung by the words, wasted another cartridge. \"Yo\u0027re comin\u0027 as close as anybody could,\" he continued. \"You can shoot like th\u0027 hammers of h—l, an\u0027 that makes it all th\u0027 funnier. Shoot again!\" he invited, holding up his hat. A hole appeared in it, to his surprise, but he jeered again instantly. \"Fine! That\u0027s shootin\u0027. Shoot again!\" Johnny stroked Pepper\u0027s neck and then leaned over and looked down. \"Not so deep,\" he muttered. \"Shore; look it over,\" shouted Lang. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to do. I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to look it over, right to th\u0027 finish. I\u0027ve allus wondered how a man would act in them sands, an\u0027 I\u0027m goin\u0027 to find out now. Mebby if yo\u0027re polite I\u0027ll put you out of yore misery when yore chin gets wet. Then I\u0027ll ride over to th\u0027 Bar H an\u0027 tell \u0027em who kidnapped th\u0027 Doc, an\u0027 did for Squint. I\u0027ve seen shows, but this here is goin\u0027 to be th\u0027 best of th\u0027 lot.\" Johnny\u0027s eyes glinted and he fired twice in succession—then a third shot after an interval, endeavoring[136] to force Lang to keep his head down while his other hand worked swiftly under his slicker roll. Emptying one gun, he slipped it back into its holster and used the other, still struggling with the slicker. At the last shot in the second weapon he worked Wolf\u0027s gun loose and slipped it into the holster on the far side from Lang. Standing up in his stirrups he gave vent to a burst of profanity and hurled his Colts, one after the other, at the hidden observer. Lang looked up in time to see the first gun bounce from the ground and then the second fell close to it. He laughed nastily and ducked down again as Johnny drew the heavy Sharps from its sheath and sent an ounce of lead smashing into the sand and pebbles close to his head. Another, another, and another struck the top of the ridge, the last striking a rock and screaming high into the air. Then Johnny gripped the heavy weapon at its muzzle with both hands, stood up in his stirrups, whirled it around his head and sent it through the air towards the hidden man. It struck loose sand and slid ten feet in a little cloud of dust. The Triangle puncher looked out again, chuckled, and slowly emerged from his place of refuge. \"I calls that kind,\" he laughed. \"There wasn\u0027t no use of lettin\u0027 good weapons like them be lost. I can use \u0027em all—an\u0027 just for that I\u0027m goin\u0027 to end yore misery like I said I might. First,\" he said, going over to the nearest Colt and picking it up, \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to load this gun an\u0027 do somethin\u0027 for my hoss an\u0027 that cow.\" He walked unsteadily toward the edge of the sands, pulling half a dozen cartridges from his belt as he[137] advanced. Reaching the danger zone, he tried each step before putting his weight into it and slowly advanced to the last tuft of grass, where he stood, swaying slightly as it moved gently under his weight. The sand at its outer edges moved a little and changed color as the water flooded and receded in it. \"Reckon this is th\u0027 jumpin\u0027 off place,\" he said. \"You\u0027d be plumb tickled if I fell in, wouldn\u0027t you?\" he jeered. \"Well, I ain\u0027t aimin\u0027 to. I\u0027m figgerin\u0027 on loadin\u0027 this gun—this way: Number One,\" he said, sliding a cartridge into the cylinder, \"is for my hoss; Number Two is for th\u0027 cow; Number Three is for a hole through yore hat; this one is for yore hoss when only its head is out, or as soon as you jump off. I\u0027m givin\u0027 you that chance to help it—an\u0027 to save my valuable time; these two are for yore head when yore chin gets under. One\u0027ll be enough, but two will be dead shore—I might miss th\u0027 first to hear you cuss.\" Lang raised the Colt and put his horse out of its misery; then he did the same for the cow. \"That\u0027s what I call fair shootin\u0027,\" he said. \"Of course, you might \u0027a\u0027 done it faster—but I\u0027m in no hurry. Now, this next shot has got to be dead shore if I put it high enough in yore hat to miss yore head—an\u0027 I ain\u0027t aimin\u0027 to hit that yet. So if I takes plenty of time, don\u0027t you get jumpy.\" He raised the gun above his head to increase the torment and there was a flash and roar at Johnny\u0027s hip. The Triangle puncher\u0027s hand opened and the gun dropped behind him as a look of great surprise flashed to his face, and remained there. Twisting sideways,[138] he fell face down, sprawled full length upon the greedy sands. \"There, d—n you!\" gritted Johnny. \"Th\u0027 show\u0027s over, for you!\" He brought the gun back on its mark, but did not release the hammer again. There was no doubt, this time, about Lang. He let the hammer down on an empty chamber and slid the weapon back in his holster. Reassuring Pepper, he glanced down and saw that her legs were being pulled to the sides, which sprawled them out. \"Slow,\" he said, and looked again to make sure. \"Mighty slow. This stuff is different in places—but d—d sure,\" he added bitterly. \"You take it easy, Pepper Girl. I won\u0027t let it last much longer—\u0027though it\u0027s goin\u0027 to take a lot of nerve. Good little hoss—good little Pepper Girl.\" He now knew there was no hope of riding out. He knew quicksands—he had seen them on other ranges, but never such a one as this, for the others had been small—the size of this bed was far beyond his experience. He studied it and watched the tremors running through it—the sand seemed to be moving and new surfaces to be forming. Wet spots appeared, became covered with water and then were uncovered again as it drained away. Hollows slowly formed here, slight bulges there, but with no stability. Undulations showed frequently near the bodies, which were slowly sinking. The cow was nearly under. This trap had no definite edges, for it met and merged with the honest sands around it in such a way as to show no lines; but he knew, by looking at the[139] tracks of his horse, which, strangely enough, had not been quite obliterated, that he was too far from firm ground to have any hope of getting out in that direction. He cogitated upon the possibilities of escape in other directions, for it was possible that along some other course he might find firm earth closer to him. To his right was a grass tuft, not as far from him as was the place where Lang\u0027s body marked the other edge, but it lay too far away. Behind him the nature of the sands was evident for a like distance, and questionable for half as far again. To his left was the Triangle horse, which he could gain by leaping from his saddle; beyond that, half as far, was the cow, still useful if used soon enough and not rested on for too long. He believed that the cow could not have crossed much of the sands before becoming mired, and this gave him renewed hope. It was the only way worth trying with a chance of success. At the best it would be a gamble, but while those two bodies remained above the surface they would serve as stepping stones. From the body of the horse he would do the last kind act in his power for Pepper, and then, throwing away the gun to save its weight, jump to the cow. This would be easy; but from there on he would need all his strength and wits and will. Looking beyond the cow, he searched for something to put his rope on, and found nothing nearer than the fence posts, which were too far away. And then, while he looked, he saw water ooze up and cover the sand some distance beyond the cow, and he admitted that his case was hopeless; and as he admitted it the cow disappeared from sight. [140] Hopeless, but not to be submitted to without a struggle. He would neither sit apathetic nor frantic, nor turn the gun on himself. Hope had gone as a matter of reasoning; but something had taken its place which in power transcended hope—cold rage, and a savage, defiant hatred for that deadly, silent trap; a rage such as he seldom had felt before, which urged him to tear and rend the sands as though they were a sentient enemy. Hope, living in him, had been faint-hearted when he thought of how ghastly the thing was; how he, a man with all a man\u0027s strength of body and mind and will, mounted on the finest horse for hundreds of miles, armed with a weapon, the use of which no man knew better; how he could not do a thing to save his life. What is hope but a wish? But the dynamic rage which crept through him was a force of another kind—defiant, savage determination to cheat the workings of that mobile bed of horror, or go down to a death made glorious by the fight. He shook his fist at it. His thin lips drew back over set teeth in a snarl primitive in its timbre and in the savage nature behind it \"D—n you! You may win; but I\u0027ll make that winnin\u0027 hard!\" Gripping the pommel he climbed up onto the saddle and poised for the leap. Could he believe his ears? Glancing around, he saw a woman tearing down the valley toward him, the drumming roll of her horse\u0027s pounding hoofs growing ever louder. What a sound! What music ever was so sweet? What sight had ever been so beautiful as that trim figure mounted astride a horse which seemed to spurn the grass in its arrowy[141] flight? Hatless her hair streaming behind her like a glorious battle flag of Hope, came Margaret, and her voice rang out like a trumpet. \"Wait!\" Hope returned again to bulwark Rage and give Determination a better footing and stronger lever. \"Pepper Girl,\" choked Johnny, \"I\u0027m glad I waited. There\u0027s mebby many a mile we\u0027ll do together, better friends than ever. I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you that if there\u0027s any way outside of h—l to get you out of this, yo\u0027re goin\u0027. Hear me, little hoss? An\u0027 that thoroughbred girl has brought us th\u0027 way. Cheer up—we\u0027re goin\u0027 out, you an\u0027 me. But we\u0027ll have bad dreams—plumb bad dreams—for many a night to come.\" He suddenly raised a warning hand. \"Look out!\" he shouted. \"Don\u0027t come too close!\" \"I know this grisly thing like a book,\" she replied. \"What shall I do?\" \"Don\u0027t come too close!\" \"This is the edge; tell me what to do!\" She looked at Lang\u0027s partly submerged body and shuddered. \"Hold your cayuse fast by th\u0027 reins an\u0027 get off, so I can put my rope around that pommel. But I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s a little too far,\" he replied, swinging the braided lariat carefully around his head. She quickly obeyed, but led the horse to another point on the edge, and gained a few inches. The rope shot out and up, struck the saddle and then the sands. Jerking it back again, he coiled it carefully, and then looked up, and nodded. Margaret was holding to the pommel with one hand and leaning out over the sands, her other arm extended[142] toward him. The second cast went over her wrist and she caught the rope, drew back to the saddle and made the loop fast around her pommel. \"Get up in th\u0027 saddle an\u0027 pull this rope tight—tight,\" he said, and at a word from him Pepper braced herself, as well as she could, as if a cow were at the other end. He slid from the saddle, touched the sand for an instant, and pulled himself at his best speed along the lariat, moving too rapidly to be caught, and soon stood at the side of the woman who had saved him. \"Can\u0027t we save that darling?\" she asked, tears in her eyes. \"We\u0027re goin\u0027 to try mighty hard,\" he said. \"Start ahead, slow—a little more. You watch yore cayuse an\u0027 stop instanter when I says th\u0027 word. I\u0027m scared we\u0027ll break Pepper\u0027s laigs, \u0027though if it\u0027s done easy we may get along all right; it looks soft, right there. Ready? Then, pull. Come, Pepper! Come on, little hoss! Come on! Come on!\" he cried, and then he whistled the well-known signal. \"Come on! That\u0027s th\u0027 girl! That\u0027s th\u0027 girl! Keep a-churnin\u0027, tear it up! Come on! Come on, you black darlin\u0027! That\u0027s th\u0027 way! Keep a-comin\u0027, keep a-comin\u0027!\" Slowly Pepper went sideways, Margaret fearing that its legs would snap under the strain, but the struggling animal fell on its side, and then came the tug of war. Johnny added his strength to the rope and slowly, an inch at a time, they gained, and then had to rest for a moment because flesh and blood could not stand such a continued effort. Johnny breathed deeply and relaxed. [143] \"Once more, Ma\u0027am,\" he said, getting a fresh hold on the rope, \"I\u0027m glad that saddle is a rim-fire—I\u0027d mistrust a center-fire, with its one cinch. An\u0027 I\u0027m glad it was made by Ol\u0027 Hawkins—that pommel can stand twice th\u0027 strain. Now then—pull!\" Again they rested, the blood pounding in his ears. \"Yo\u0027re comin\u0027 fine, little hoss! We ain\u0027t handlin\u0027 you very gentle; but yo\u0027re comin\u0027!\" A few minutes later Pepper slid across sand that was dry and honest, and with the slackening of the rope she scrambled to her feet and trembled, weary but safe. Johnny hung the lariat on his saddle and then rubbed the velvety muzzle which sought his cheek, and stroked the quivering shoulder. Impulsively he buried his face in the wet, sandy, roughened coat on her neck and flung an arm around it; and when he turned away his face was drawn and wet, and there were tears in his eyes despite all effort of will. \"Ma\u0027am,\" he said, huskily, \"Pepper an\u0027 me owe you a debt we never can pay; but we can try right hard to square up some of it. I\u0027ll never forget th\u0027 last half-hour, never.\" \"How did you come to get in it?\" asked Margaret, glancing where she last had seen the body of Lang. It was gone, and so was the horse. The sands, still undulating, were slowly assuming their mask of innocence. \"Pepper got goin\u0027 so fast she couldn\u0027t stop quick enough, which was my fault. I didn\u0027t try to turn her in time.\" \"And that—that other—man. Who was he, and what happened to him?\" [144] \"I reckon he got tangled in th\u0027 wire, an\u0027 got his rope mixed up with it. An\u0027 somehow we got to shootin\u0027. When th\u0027 excitement stopped he was there, an\u0027 I was where you found me.\" \"Who was he?\" she demanded. \"He was a Triangle puncher, Ma\u0027am; Lang was his name.\" \"He was one of the men whom I ordered to stay off our range—we couldn\u0027t keep the wire on those posts, and I suspected them strongly. Are you sure he was only tangled in the wire?\" \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t just say nothin\u0027 about that. Mebby he was tryin\u0027 to help th\u0027 cow that was mired, an\u0027 got afoul of th\u0027 wire. But that don\u0027t make no difference, anyhow, now. Have you got any wire at th\u0027 ranch?\" \"I think so,\" she answered. \"We\u0027ll put it up some day soon, so it\u0027ll take some time, an\u0027 more trouble, to get it loose.\" She nodded and took a paper out of her waist. \"Here are the figures for the year we took possession.\" He looked them over. \"Uh-huh,\" he said, \"they\u0027re what I want.\" \"It is surprising that we have as many left as we have,\" she said. \"We are about ready to give up, admit our failure, and go back East.\" \"Ma\u0027am,\" said Johnny, with great earnestness, \"don\u0027t you do it. Just sit tight an\u0027 see things come around yore way. Luck allus turns. Stick it out, an\u0027 see.\" \"Do you believe in luck?\" \"I do; when somebody\u0027s behind it pushin\u0027 hard.[145] Now, Ma\u0027am, I reckon we hadn\u0027t ought to stay here no longer, where folks can see us. They might talk, an\u0027 there\u0027s no tellin\u0027 what harm it might do. Besides, this little Pepper hoss needs a bath an\u0027 I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to take her into th\u0027 river as soon as she gets a little quieter—she looks like she mixed up with a tornado.\" He walked around collecting his guns, blowing sand from them, and cleaning them as well as he could. \"There\u0027s shore some guns around here,\" he grinned, getting Lang\u0027s Colt and throwing it into the quicksand. \"This here gun,\" he said, reloading Wolf\u0027s Colt and tying it under the slicker roll, \"shore come in handy. Some folks would call that luck—mebby it was, as far as totin\u0027 it is concerned—but I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you there wasn\u0027t no luck in th\u0027 way it was used. But as for totin\u0027 it, I reckon that was luck, even if I did carry it to fool somebody, sometime. Now, Ma\u0027am, I\u0027ll be ridin\u0027 west. There\u0027s a regular bath tub near th\u0027 main trail, where th\u0027 river runs over solid rock: an\u0027 solid rock is th\u0027 only kind of river bottom I have any use for, today. Pepper an\u0027 I won\u0027t forget what you did for us—an\u0027 I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you to sit tight, an\u0027 watch th\u0027 luck swing yore way. I\u0027ll be leavin\u0027 now—good-by, Ma\u0027am.\" She spurred her horse and shot even with him. \"Why are you doing this?\" she demanded. \"You can\u0027t fool me about that—that man\u0027s rope fouling the wire. I know what he was doing. Why are you running such risks for total strangers?\" \"Ma\u0027am,\" he replied, smiling quizzically, \"I don\u0027t know, unless it\u0027s because I can\u0027t keep out of trouble. I\u0027m allus gettin\u0027 mixed up with it, somehow, an\u0027 th\u0027[146] habit\u0027s set, I reckon. I\u0027m gettin\u0027 so I like it. But we shouldn\u0027t be ridin\u0027 like this. You have no idea how much folks can talk, or figger from a little thing like this.\" \"Can\u0027t you stop them, as you did that Bar H foreman?\" \"Reckon so; but I ain\u0027t ready to,\" he grinned. \"There\u0027s a time for everythin\u0027, an\u0027 I\u0027m not shore th\u0027 time has come for that. When it does I\u0027ll know it without no doubts. I\u0027m askin\u0027 how you learned all th\u0027 things you said yesterday?\" \"I suppose it is a natural curiosity, even in a man; but I prefer to say nothing about the matter.\" She drew rein and he took off his sombrero. \"I\u0027m tempted to see if the luck will turn,\" she smiled. \"Good-by.\" \"I\u0027m thankin\u0027 you again. Ma\u0027am,\" he replied. \"It shore will, an\u0027 you can bank on it,\" and he pressed Pepper\u0027s sides. The horse struck into a stride suggestive of a wish to put miles between her and the scene of her torture, but he pulled her down to a walk. \"Yo\u0027re entirely too willin\u0027, little hoss of mine,\" he reproved, patting the roughened coat \"I was aimin\u0027 to do somethin\u0027 today, but it can wait. Wolf or no Wolf. If he horns in I won\u0027t waste no more time on him, none at all. There\u0027s a nice little wooded draw over there, an\u0027 we\u0027re goin\u0027 for it. You got to get rested up an\u0027 quieted a little—th\u0027 bath can wait a couple of hours. You got to keep in good shape, because th\u0027 time is comin\u0027 when I\u0027ll have to ride you like I had a remuda to draw on—an\u0027 I ain\u0027t worth a cuss unless yo\u0027re in good shape. Yo\u0027re my laigs. Pepper, an\u0027 no[147] puncher is better\u0027n his cayuse. An\u0027 mebby Two-Spot, th\u0027 tattle-tale, won\u0027t be surprised when he sees you!\" Margaret looked after him and smiled, and then turned and stared at the innocent patch of wet sand under whose hypocritical surface lay grisly death. Shuddering, she sent her pony into a sharp gallop and set out for home, a color in her face which might have been due to the exhilaration of horseback riding.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56732.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
