{"id":18890,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII \"COMING EVENTS——\"","content":"Johnny entered the draw, found a small clearing, and let Pepper wander, watching her closely, while he went over his guns again, cleaning them thoroughly. The afternoon had half gone when he whistled her to him and rode her down to the rocky pool he had mentioned. Stripping himself, he removed the saddle and its blanket and, mounting bareback, rode her into the stream, where he found a place deep enough to swim her. Crossing and recrossing this several times, he took her out and started to dress; and no sooner was she free than she trotted to a dry, warm patch of sand and rolled to her heart\u0027s content, grunting with pleasure. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now look at what you\u0027ve done,\" he grinned. \"After me gettin\u0027 you all washed up, you go an\u0027 blot yoreself just like a common cayuse. I\u0027ve been wastin\u0027 sympathy on you—there ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 th\u0027 matter with you. An\u0027 there\u0027s somethin\u0027 I want to ask you, before I forget it: Was you ever in a quicksand just like that one? I bet you wasn\u0027t. I\u0027ve crossed some rivers in my time, an\u0027 had cattle bogged in several—but this was different, somehow. Mebby it\u0027s because it wasn\u0027t under water; but I don\u0027t know. I was scared we\u0027d bust yore laigs; mebby we didn\u0027t because we pulled you sideways, an\u0027 you raised so much h—l when you felt th\u0027 rope tighten, an\u0027 heard me call you. Just th\u0027[149] same, I\u0027m sayin\u0027 we had a close call. An\u0027 we mustn\u0027t forget it. Come here, now, an\u0027 let me throw this saddle on you. We\u0027re goin\u0027 to town, an\u0027 yore goin\u0027 to get robbed till you shines. I\u0027m as stuck-up about you as a gal is over her first beau.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In a few minutes they were on their way to Gunsight, but they did not reach the town without incident. They had ridden to Pine Mountain and Johnny, wishing to see if Squint\u0027s saddle had been discovered, hid Pepper in a dump of brush and scrub timber well back from the trail and, taking his rifle, crossed the beaten road at a rocky place and worked his way into the brush on the mountain side. When he had climbed about eighty feet he reached a little rock shelf and rested a moment. As he was about to go on he heard hoofbeats down the trail and he flattened himself behind a tuft of grass growing in a crack. Looking down the trail he saw a horseman round into sight from the arroyo leading from East Canyon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Smitty,\" he muttered. \"I don\u0027t think much of him, an\u0027 I reckon he\u0027ll scare. An\u0027 mebby if he\u0027s scared near to death a few times he\u0027ll figger he ain\u0027t wanted around here, an\u0027 hit th\u0027 trail out. Mebby I\u0027m wrong, but here\u0027s where Mr. Smitty gets a jolt he won\u0027t forget. It will be Number One. Whether or not he gets any more will depend on how he takes this one. I\u0027m bettin\u0027 he don\u0027t stalk me for it—here he comes, ridin\u0027 lazy an\u0027 tryin\u0027 to sing. I ought to be able to come awful close at this distance, with a rifle layin\u0027 on a rock rest.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Smith, of the Bar H, rode at a walk, singing a song, the words of which should never appear in print.[150] He had a message to deliver to the Doc and was in no hurry. His hat, a Mexican sombrero with ultra-fancy band, and a high crown, which appeared to be even higher because of the vertical dents which pushed the top into a peak, was tilted rakishly off-center and looked rather ludicrous to the man on the mountain, who noted that there appeared to be plenty of hat and horse, but very little man. When just across a short stretch of rocky trail there rang out over the rider\u0027s head a roar such as only black powder can make, and the tilted sombrero flew into the air and struck the ground. The horse and its rider heard the roar at the same instant and each acted as their instincts prompted. The horse shot forward, clearing a dozen feet in the jump, sprang back, wheeling in the air, and bolted for the arroyo it had just left, where it quickly recovered its poise and stopped to search out succulent grass tufts. Mr. Smith\u0027s instincts seemed to have come to him through generations of acrobatic ancestors, although he was not aware that any of his family tree claimed any such accomplishments, at least since they had forsaken arboreal surroundings. Certainly he never boasted, even in his maddest sprees, of being in any way gifted in acrobatics. Nevertheless, he performed a creditable exhibition when the roar smashed against his ears. As the horse leaped, he grabbed at the pommel, missed it, and in his haste to jerk his head back from the screaming lead he lost his balance. His feet left the stirrups, and then came swiftly upward as he pivoted on the saddle. They swept up past the horse\u0027s neck, kept on and described a half-circle, the saddle as the center. As they went[151] up Mr. Smith\u0027s head went down, and as the horse leaped back and whirled, he was jolted into a position rarely seen in horseback riding except in exhibitions. For a moment he stood on his shoulder against the cantle of the saddle and then turned a pretty, if unintentional, back flip onto the ground, landing squarely on his hat. The whole thing happened in a flash and the sound of the shot was still rumbling among the hills when, grabbing his sombrero, he started on a dead run for the horse and the ranch. When he reached the animal he leaped into the saddle without touching the stirrups, and urged a speedy departure, which his spurs obtained. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny rolled over on his back and laughed heartily. Finally he sat up, put the empty shell in his pocket, reloaded the rifle and went up the mountain to hide Squint\u0027s saddle in a better place, for he now believed such a precaution necessary. It was more than probable that Pine Mountain would be searched as soon as the indignant puncher could lead his friends to the scene of his discomfiture. He found the saddle where he had left it and carried it to a narrow, shallow split in the mountain\u0027s rocky side and dropped it in, after which dead branches and grass and rocks covered it and hid it securely. Scrambling back to the trail he looked cautiously along it and then dashed across and made his way to his horse, stepping on rock whenever possible. Not long afterward he rode down the Juniper trail and went to the hotel shed, where he led Pepper inside and prepared to groom her. He hardly had begun work when Two-Spot sidled in, and there was wrath in his eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n [152] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you been doin\u0027 to that hoss?\" he demanded, as his gaze swept over her. \"She looks like she\u0027s been rolled in th\u0027 river.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby she has,\" replied Johnny, rubbing briskly. \"She likes a swim as well as I do—an\u0027 we both had one, which is somethin\u0027 I can recommend to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What did you do with them rifle cartridges of Polecat\u0027s you was goin\u0027 to give me?\" asked Two-Spot, going to work on the other flank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hid \u0027em,\" answered Johnny. \"Look out she don\u0027t hand you a stomachful of hoof—she don\u0027t like strangers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Huh!\" snorted Two-Spot, \"what do I care about strangers? Where\u0027d you hide \u0027em?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In them sweepin\u0027s, under th\u0027 manger,\" replied Johnny. \"Wait till after dark.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you figger I\u0027m goin\u0027 to do—show everybody that Two-Spot\u0027s startin\u0027 an arsenal?\" He rubbed for a moment in silence, and then began to chuckle. \"Ol\u0027 Chief Smell-Um-Strong had a plumb fine gun—I got a laugh comin\u0027; you gave th\u0027 best one away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m satisfied,\" grunted Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dave was on th\u0027 prod this noon when I showed up,\" continued Two-Spot. \"What did you say you was swimmin\u0027 in?\" he demanded, curiously, examining one of Pepper\u0027s hocks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Water,\" answered Johnny. \"What did he say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby it was,\" observed Two-Spot. \"How\u0027d you get out?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Swum.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At th\u0027 end of a rope? Why, Dave, he wanted to[153] know where th\u0027 this, that, an\u0027 th\u0027 other thing I was last night. Reckoned, mebby, I\u0027d got full of berries an\u0027 hibernated. What was you doin\u0027 in th\u0027 SV valley?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What did you tell him?\" asked Johnny, grinning. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Told him that I was rustlin\u0027 a passel of cows an\u0027 that they went so fast I had to run to Juniper before I could head \u0027em off. You must \u0027a\u0027 had one h—l of a time gettin\u0027 out. Shore Pepper ain\u0027t hurt?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It ain\u0027t th\u0027 first bath she\u0027s had—she\u0027s a good swimmer, \u0027though for much of it I\u0027d ruther have a cayuse with a bigger barrel. She won\u0027t shrink.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why in h—l don\u0027t Dave set out th\u0027 bottle, like he used to?\" growled Two-Spot. \"There ain\u0027t no sense in totin\u0027 it by th\u0027 glass to a crowd of blotters. They\u0027ll hold more liquor than a gopher hole—an\u0027 I\u0027ve broke my back carryin\u0027 water to drown them fellers out when I was a kid. How long is your rope?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dave\u0027s a friend of mine, that\u0027s why,\" answered Johnny. \"My capacity is so limited that ol\u0027 Dailey could clean me out after my fourth drink. Them leather-bellies can drink me into a heap on th\u0027 floor, an\u0027 never know they\u0027d been drinkin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shore,\" said Two-Spot, chuckling; \"yo\u0027re a teethin\u0027 infant, a reg\u0027lar suckin\u0027 calf—I\u0027ve seen you put away a dozen an\u0027 not bat an eye. An\u0027 it\u0027s bad medicine; look at me. How long\u0027s that rope?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eighty feet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re another. There ain\u0027t a man livin\u0027 can throw such a rope an\u0027 ketch anythin\u0027. I\u0027ve seen some good uns, but I\u0027ve never seen even a sixty-foot rope. Who fastened to you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [154] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re loco—plumb loco,\" said Johnny. \"You want to forget them hallucernations—somebody might believe \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Hallerlucinations\u0027—humph! I\u0027ll have to remember that an\u0027 throw it at Dave. Where was you today?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mindin\u0027 my own business,\" retorted Johnny. \"What ever put you hangin\u0027 \u0027round a saloon, emptyin\u0027 boxes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whiskey,\" said Two-Spot \"I was smart, like you, an\u0027 liked to hold up my end, drink for drink. Here\u0027s some more of that water you swum in—looks familiar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to drag you out to a ranch some of these days,\" threatened Johnny, \"an\u0027 give you a job—an\u0027 whale th\u0027 skin from yore bones th\u0027 first time I see you takin\u0027 a drink. You got brains an\u0027 that ranch needs \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t learn an old dog new tricks,\" grunted Two-Spot, and then burst out laughing; \"but you can change a wolf inter a skunk if you goes about it right. He! He! He!\" In a few minutes he threw down the brush and went to the door. \"Seein\u0027 as how yo\u0027re playin\u0027 fresh-water clam, do it yoreself!\" he snorted and, dodging the other brush, he scurried around to Dave\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n Down on the Bar H, Smitty\u0027s arrival made a ripple of excitement. Big Tom was mending a shirt and cursing the clumsiness of his fingers and the sharpness of the needle, when there came the clatter of hoofs outside and he looked up to see Smitty leap from the saddle and jump through the doorway, holding a much-abused[155] Mexican sombrero out at arm\u0027s length. It was trampled and soiled and there was a fuzzy-edged rip an inch long in the brim where a 550-grain bullet had ploughed before passing through. Eight years before Smitty had paid twenty-five dollars for the hat, perhaps entirely too much, and next to his saddle it was his most prized possession. It had seen hard service, but he fondly regarded it as being as good as new. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lookit my hat!\" he cried, jabbing it under the foreman\u0027s nose, which caused the needle to find the finger again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"D—n th\u0027 hat!\" growled Big Tom. \"Take it away from my nose!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lookit it!\" insisted Smitty. \"Some coyote shot at me from up on Pine Mountain an\u0027 plumb ruined it! He came so close I could feel th\u0027 slug—cuss it, I smelled it! It fair grazed by nose. Lookit it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Big Tom threw the shirt away and took the hat, turning it over in his hands. \"I\u0027d say it was close—plumb close,\" he admitted. \"How far off was he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Right over my head—couple dozen feet,\" answered Smitty. \"Here! Don\u0027t poke yore blasted finger in it like that! Cuss it, it\u0027s bad enough now! That\u0027s more like it. I could feel th\u0027 concussion an\u0027 smell th\u0027 smoke. I was ridin\u0027 along at a walk, when whango! It near stunned me, it was so close. An\u0027 lookit what he done to that hat! There ain\u0027t another hat like that on th\u0027 whole range!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re right, they throw \u0027em away long before that,\" retorted Big Tom, an idea coming into his head. \"Did you pick up his trail?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [156] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How could I?\" indignantly demanded Smitty. \"My cayuse fair went wild, an\u0027 before I could get him under control he was clean out of th\u0027 canyon—I tell you I did some highfalutin\u0027 riding stickin\u0027 to a crazy hoss among all them rocks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027d you get yore hat? Didn\u0027t it go off yore head?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shore it did! I scooped it up as my cayuse wheeled—an\u0027 talk about turnin\u0027 on a saddle blanket—that jack rabbit can wheel on a postage stamp if he\u0027s prodded enough. He just simply climbed up straight an\u0027 swapped ends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You should \u0027a\u0027 gone back an\u0027 stalked that feller,\" said Big Tom, using plenty of salt on what he heard. \"Or at least rustled to Gunsight to see who might come ridin\u0027 in. Where did all this happen?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Right on them benches on th\u0027 east end of th\u0027 mountain—at that rocky hump in th\u0027 trail. How he ever missed at such close range is more\u0027n I can understand—why, a kid oughta be able to make a hit, every time, as close as that. An\u0027 it was a rifle; th\u0027 roar was deafenin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He missed because he wanted to miss,\" said Big Tom. \"One of th\u0027 boys is playin\u0027 a joke on you—you know what they\u0027ve said about that tent. He come closer than he reckoned on—I\u0027ll bet you rocked forward in th\u0027 saddle as he shot.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I reckon I did—you know what ridin\u0027 is over that hump,\" Smitty said. \"I remember that when I jerked back as it passed my nose I went quite a ways—my neck is sore from th\u0027 jerk. But I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you[157] I ain\u0027t nowise shore it was any joke. An\u0027 I says, if it was, it was a cussed pore one. I\u0027ll nat\u0027rally skin any fool I ketches playin\u0027 any more jokes like that on me. Cuss it, it skun my nose!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A skin fur a skin, huh?\" chuckled the foreman. He handed the hat back to its owner. \"There ain\u0027t no man on th\u0027 range that would miss yore head, hat or no hat, from them benches. It ain\u0027t more than seventy-five or eighty feet from up there. They aimed to miss you; an\u0027 they shaved it a little too fine, not allowin\u0027 for you bobbin\u0027 forward. I says it was one of th\u0027 boys. You lay low an\u0027 use yore eyes an\u0027 ears, an\u0027 if you find out who it was I\u0027ll give that fool a dressin\u0027 down he won\u0027t forget. A joke\u0027s a joke—we all play \u0027em; but there\u0027s such a thing as ridin\u0027 \u0027em too hard. Did you give th\u0027 Doc my message?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What message?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The foreman stared at him and slowly raised his hands. \"I\u0027ll be cussed—it was more of a joke than I thought. Didn\u0027t I tell you to ride up there an\u0027 tell th\u0027 Doc that we wanted to see him tonight? Didn\u0027t you leave here to tell him that, an\u0027 for nothin\u0027 else?\" he demanded, his voice rising. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yeah, I reckon mebby you did,\" admitted the puncher, uneasily. \"You want to see him tonight, shore.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do. Now you fork that cayuse an\u0027 get goin\u0027. Good Lord! That bullet must \u0027a\u0027 hit yore mem\u0027ry.\" He glanced at his puncher\u0027s thigh. \"An\u0027 where\u0027s yore six-shooter? Did you forget that, somewhere?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Smitty\u0027s hand went to the holster and he cursed heart[158]ily. \"D—n these open sheaths! It must \u0027a\u0027 fell out when that jack rabbit did th\u0027 fancy swappin\u0027 of ends. Now I got to go get it, but I\u0027m borrowin\u0027 a gun to wear, or I stays here. Somethin\u0027 tells me it\u0027s unhealthy to go ridin\u0027 around this God-forsaken country without no six-gun.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take that spare one of mine, hangin\u0027 up over my bunk,\" offered the foreman. \"She\u0027s in good shape. Now, yo\u0027re plumb shore you didn\u0027t lose nothin\u0027 else, more valuable than earthly belongin\u0027s?\" he grinned. \"Yo\u0027re shore yo\u0027re goin\u0027 back for yore gun?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shore I am; what you mean?\" replied Smitty, suspiciously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothin\u0027 worth mentionin\u0027,\" smiled Big Tom. \"I reckoned mebby you\u0027d take th\u0027 over-mountain trail, seein\u0027 as it\u0027s shorter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then how could I get my gun?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I was wonderin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get it,\" Smitty assured him. \"I\u0027ll get it unless yore fool joker picked it up. Mebby he\u0027s a-settin\u0027 on it, waitin\u0027 to hand it to me, an\u0027 \u0027pologize for missin\u0027 me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He won\u0027t be within miles of here by this time,\" said Big Tom. \"He dusted quick. If he was jokin\u0027 he\u0027d get away pronto, an\u0027 if he wasn\u0027t, he\u0027d do it quicker. I reckon you\u0027d better climb up on that bench an\u0027 see what you can find—an\u0027 empty shell might help us a lot. But don\u0027t forget to see th\u0027 Doc, this time. After that you can go to town an\u0027 find out what you can learn. Now get started. An\u0027 take good care of that hat—that ain\u0027t no way to treat it, nohow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Smitty growled, took down the six-shooter, strode out[159] to his horse and swung into the saddle. \"Hope nobody picked it up,\" he said. \"Twenty dollars is twenty dollars, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t got th\u0027 twenty. Anyway, it\u0027s a better gun than they\u0027re makin\u0027 nowadays.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t lose that one while yo\u0027re pickin\u0027 up th\u0027 other,\" laughed the foreman. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he was out of sight of the ranch Smitty wheeled sharply and rode eastward. \"I got to get it,\" he muttered, \"or I\u0027ll never hear th\u0027 last of it; but there ain\u0027t no reason for ridin\u0027 through th\u0027 canyon an\u0027 th\u0027 arroyo, along th\u0027 side of th\u0027 mountain for no four miles. It was too cussed close for a joke. An\u0027 mebby he aimed to spatter me all over th\u0027 trail. I just can\u0027t figger it, nohow. But I\u0027m free to remark that any more of them jokes will send Smitty dustin\u0027 along th\u0027 trail, no matter what way he\u0027s pointin\u0027 at th\u0027 time, an\u0027 he won\u0027t never come back no more. Somehow, I just can\u0027t help thinkin\u0027 of pore Squint. Cuss it, I can feel it yet!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Getting near the scene of his discomfiture, Smitty dismounted and went on a reconnaissance, viewing the benches from every angle, and after some time he located his gun lying in the grass near the trail. Returning to his horse he mounted and rode forward, striking into a dead run as he approached the rocky hump in the trail and, leaning down, he picked up the weapon as he swept past, no mean feat when the grass is considered. In a few minutes he pulled his mount to a lope and soon drew rein at the Doc\u0027s door, where he delivered the message, gossiped for a few minutes, and then went on to town. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first person he saw was Two-Spot, leaning[160] against the front of the Palace and who accepted, with alacrity, Smitty\u0027s invitation to drink. Two-Spot saw the condition of the hat before its wearer had dismounted, and his curiosity burned strongly within him. The puncher engaged him and Dave in conversation but his efforts at these sources of information were futile. What knowledge he gained had no bearing on Johnny. Two-Spot casually remarked that Johnny had been loafing around most of the afternoon, pestering him and said that he was a nuisance. Buying another round Smitty sauntered into Dailey\u0027s, where he learned nothing at all. Having taken the census and found that everyone had been rooted in town all day, he began to accept his foreman\u0027s view of the mystery, and set out for home, burning for an opportunity to observe his bosom friends and listen to their careless conversation. But if he had not received any information, he had not given any, and Two-Spot\u0027s curiosity about the hole in the hat was still raging. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The\u0027 doin\u0027s on this here range are scandalous,\" observed Dave\u0027s factotum to Dave, himself. \"They\u0027re gettin\u0027 worse an\u0027 worse, an\u0027 somebody\u0027s goin\u0027 to get hurt afore long. Now I wonder how th\u0027 devil Smitty\u0027s hat got abused like that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What makes you think things is gettin\u0027 worse?\" asked Dave. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That Greaser tent never come by that hole from bein\u0027 used; an\u0027 Smitty was shore askin\u0027 a lot of questions; an\u0027 Nelson ain\u0027t swimmin\u0027 hisself an\u0027 that hoss for fun—I know I wouldn\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Which is an abidin\u0027 sorrer to all them as gets down[161] wind of you,\" said Dave. \"Was Nelson\u0027s saddle wet?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No-o; I reckon it was dry,\" grudgingly admitted the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Was his clothes wet?\" continued Dave. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No-o-o,\" more reluctantly admitted Two-Spot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You got a head like a toad,\" contemptuously rejoined the proprietor. \"Trouble with you is, yore imagination is on th\u0027 rampage. You got too much time on yore hands—suppose you \u0027tend to th\u0027 sand boxes? They ain\u0027t been touched in three days.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two-Spot sighed and obeyed. \"Huh!\" he grunted, emptying a box into the road. \"Mebby; but I saw somethin\u0027 about that hole that reminded me of some gosh-awful ca\u0027tridges I seen lately. Cuss it—I\u0027d bet on it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He chuckled, set down the box, slipped around the side of the saloon and poked his head in the hotel shed. \"Don\u0027t she shine, though?\" he remarked in congratulatory tones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She does,\" admitted Johnny, finishing the job. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say,\" said his visitor, \"gimme an empty rifle shell.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What for?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I want to keep matches in it. I\u0027ll get a cork from Dave an\u0027 have a waterproof matchbox.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You need it,\" countered Johnny. \"Aimin\u0027 to fall in th\u0027 crick? You need that, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two-Spot ignored the insult, the second on that topic within five minutes. Evidently there must be some real or fancied foundation for it. \"Got one?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll save you one,\" replied Johnny; \"but mebby[162] you\u0027ll have to wait quite a spell. I still got them I loaded,\" he said, truthfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well there ain\u0027t no hurry,\" admitted Two-Spot. \"Thought mebby you had one in yore clothes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I might go out an\u0027 shoot one off; but I reckon I won\u0027t, seein\u0027 that it ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to rain for a day or two.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t shoot none for that,\" replied Two-Spot. \"Smitty was in town a few minutes ago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Uh-huh, he was. He was projectin\u0027 around tryin\u0027 to find out who spoiled his twenty-year-old Mex. sun-shade. He was het up about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t blame him. Was it spoiled bad?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Plumb sufficient. Looks like th\u0027 railroad thought it was a tunnel. He acts like he\u0027s got hal—hallerlucerations,\" grinned Two-Spot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you can\u0027t wear them on a hat,\" reproved Johnny. \"That is, not till after you open th\u0027 can, anyhow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Huh?\" Two-Spot scratched his frowsy head, \"mebby not, but that\u0027s th\u0027 safest place to tote \u0027em—on th\u0027 outside, leastawise. Did you think they was like a—a shirt?\" he demanded with great sarcasm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby; they covers a lot of ignorance. Yo\u0027re not goin\u0027 out, are you?\" asked Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am,\" retorted his companion, shuffling toward the door. \"You think yo\u0027re d—d smart, don\u0027t you? You an\u0027 yore hullercations? Well, you can go plumb to h—l!\" and Two-Spot made haste to get around in front of the saloon, where he refilled the box and carried it inside. \\n\\n \\n\\n [163] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cuss it, Dave,\" he complained, \"nobody \u0027round here treats me like I deserve!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An it\u0027s d—d lucky for you that they don\u0027t,\" retorted Dave. \"You \u0027tend to them boxes, or I\u0027ll make a start at treatin\u0027 you like you deserves. What\u0027s th\u0027 matter with you, anyhow? You\u0027ve been chucklin\u0027 all day like you\u0027ve lost what little sense you had. You ought to take somethin\u0027 for them spasms—they\u0027re too frequent to do you any good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two-Spot sighed and carried out another box. He dropped it and shook his head. \"I don\u0027t care a cuss; I\u0027m still bettin\u0027 that hole was made by a Sharp\u0027s Special. But what gets me is, how could he perforate th\u0027 brim while that there pinched-up peak waves defiance, an\u0027 courts destruction? You gimme a shot at it, and I\u0027d blow th\u0027 hull top off\u0027n it. But I dassn\u0027t think about that, now that I\u0027ve got a gun; it\u0027s so fascinatin\u0027 I\u0027ll be takin\u0027 a shot at it some of these days—an\u0027 I reckon I\u0027d get more\u0027n a hat. Shucks! that\u0027d be all right; it\u0027s only Smitty.\" He leaned up against the building and laughed until Dave came out to see if he could get in one healthy kick, but Two-Spot avoided him and went back to the box. \"Polecat is near Highbank now,\" he muttered. \"I\u0027d give his gun to read his thoughts! He! He! He!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56733.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
