{"id":18901,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII RANGE ACTIVITIES","content":"On the day following Johnny\u0027s message to Big Tom, Gunsight had awakened expectant, and had remained so all the morning, but to no end. Not a Bar H man had come in, so far as they knew, and the trio in Dave\u0027s changed from the belief each had retired with and discussed the situation from a different point of view. \n \n \"Big Tom is a wise ol\u0027 owl,\" said Dailey. \"He\u0027ll move when he gets ready. Just now he\u0027s on a nest, hatchin\u0027 out somethin\u0027 that is mebby tender, bein\u0027 so young. He ain\u0027t layin\u0027 down so easy. I know him.\" \n \n \"He reckons, mebby, that th\u0027 man that dealt th\u0027 hands has got an ace in a hole,\" replied Fanning. \"It\u0027s an old sayin\u0027 that you never want to buck another man\u0027s game. I don\u0027t know that Nelson has got an ace laid away, but he don\u0027t have to have any; Big Tom figgers he has, mebby, because them Double X hombres are so friendly with him; an\u0027 it\u0027s what Big Tom thinks that counts with him. Mebby somethin\u0027 will happen today, an\u0027 mebby it won\u0027t; but it\u0027s goin\u0027 to happen, just th\u0027 same, some time.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m favorin\u0027 th\u0027 ace idea,\" said Dave, thoughtfully. \"If I was Big Tom I\u0027d be plumb suspicious of any man that made th\u0027 suggestion that Nelson made when he knew there was an outfit ag\u0027in\u0027 him. I\u0027d figger he was[308] either a cussed fool or knowed just exactly what he was doin\u0027, an\u0027 all th\u0027 time. Nobody down here believes that he is a fool, not now, anyhow; an\u0027 I\u0027m dead shore he wasn\u0027t bluffin\u0027. He\u0027s got an ace, all right—an\u0027 I\u0027m admirin\u0027 Big Tom\u0027s waitin\u0027 game. When he thinks he\u0027s figgered out how far th\u0027 Double X will go we\u0027ll hear his answer. Besides, th\u0027 Bar H has got to round up an\u0027 brand that herd for McCullough. That may be holdin\u0027 him back some.\" \n \n \"Slim\u0027s remarks slid in like they was made to fit,\" commented Dailey. \"An\u0027 he wasn\u0027t bluffin\u0027, neither. If th\u0027 Double X is backin\u0027 Nelson, all th\u0027 way, he\u0027ll win; if they ain\u0027t, he won\u0027t. But I\u0027m shore waitin\u0027 to see, an\u0027 hear.\" \n \n Down on the Bar H dinner was over before the foreman had much to say, and he was careful not to reveal his personal experiences of the morning. He counseled patience, and gave good reasons for it. They had until fall to start on the SV herd, and many things could, and would, occur before then. The first thing to do was to get ready for the round-up of the trail herd, and in order to lull suspicions they would not work on the tabooed section. There was to be no branding done out there, and in order to show their fairness in not too noticeable a way, they would help the Triangle with its five hundred head. This over with, the Triangle punchers would have to hold the herd together until McCullough came along and, not being able to call on them for aid, the Bar H would have to appeal to the Double X for the loan of some of its men, who thus would be on the ground and see[309] what cattle were to be cut out for the trail. Nelson was to be ignored until the herd was sold and the money put in the bank at Sherman, after which he would be taken care of. \n \n \"Nelson is a good man,\" Big Tom assured them; \"but he ain\u0027t good enough not to never make mistakes, an\u0027 no man can take every trick. He\u0027s goin\u0027 to miss one, th\u0027 last he\u0027ll ever miss, or win, for that matter, but there ain\u0027t no use of any of us gettin\u0027 killed unless we have to. We can get him without it, an\u0027 without gettin\u0027 any of his sudden new friends on th\u0027 prod. I promise that. I know how we\u0027re goin\u0027 to play it—an\u0027 it\u0027s so easy it makes me laugh. He\u0027s a good man; but there are older heads than his\u0027n. You foller my orders an\u0027 set tight. I\u0027ll handle this when th\u0027 time comes, an\u0027 it ain\u0027t here yet. Stay out of Gunsight unless you can go in peaceful, keep yore mouths tight shut, an\u0027 stay sober. I\u0027ve said enough about him. \n \n \"Now, we got work ahead of us, an\u0027 we start at it on th\u0027 Triangle day after tomorrow. I\u0027m goin\u0027 over to see Hank Lewis now. There\u0027ll be somebody from Twitchell an\u0027 Carpenter comin\u0027 up any day now to select th\u0027 cattle an\u0027 stay with \u0027em till McCullough counts \u0027em into his herd. After I see Hank I\u0027m ridin\u0027 to town to leave word at Dave\u0027s for Sherwood to see if I can borrow some of his boys when we start our own round-up. Look over yore gear an\u0027 be ready for workin\u0027.\" \n \n His prophecy regarding the representatives of Twitchell and Carpenter was fulfilled at mid-afternoon, when two strangers rode up to the bunkhouse and[310] inquired for him and, being told that he could very likely be found in town, they explained who they were and rode on to Gunsight, accompanied by Fraser. To the saddle of each were fastened three stamping irons bearing their road brand. \n \n Big Tom was in Dave\u0027s when they arrived and after a few rounds of drinks they settled down to discuss the herds and range topics in general. \n \n \"Th\u0027 T an\u0027 C sendin\u0027 many over th\u0027 trails this year?\" Dave asked during a lull in the talk. \n \n \"Shore,\" replied the older and taller visitor, who answered to the name of Ridley. \"We\u0027ve been busy since winter. We looked over a big herd of beeves south of th\u0027 Grande for th\u0027 first herd. There was over thirty-five hundred head and they was three- an\u0027 four-year-olds. They went up north of th\u0027 Yellowstone, on government contract. Another herd of three thousand two- an\u0027 three-year-olds went past th\u0027 Platte, bound west for new ranges. There was two more big herds went up to Dodge—one of \u0027em bein\u0027 sold without th\u0027 new owners even seein\u0027 \u0027em. This bunch is goin\u0027 to new range north of here, some of \u0027em. I don\u0027t reckon there\u0027ll be many more this year. There ain\u0027t an animal in them that McCullough\u0027s bringin\u0027 up that\u0027s more than two years old, an\u0027 those are th\u0027 ones goin\u0027 to range. We took \u0027em from four different ranches to get \u0027em choice, an\u0027 they\u0027re all long-laigged long-horns an\u0027 a purty sight to a cowman. I\u0027m bettin\u0027 Mac won\u0027t lose a single head neither. He\u0027s a trail boss that is a trail boss. He knows every river an\u0027 ford, water hole an\u0027 dry section from here to Montanny. He took that[311] first herd north this spring, an\u0027 here he is back in time to swing this drive. He has a knack of pickin\u0027 good men for his trail outfits, an\u0027 he\u0027s daddy to \u0027em all from th\u0027 jump, without nobody knowin\u0027 it.\" \n \n Big Tom arose. \"Well, friends,\" he said, shaking hands, \"yo\u0027re welcome to stay at either ranch while yo\u0027re here; but I reckon Fanning can make you more comfortable. We start on th\u0027 Triangle day after tomorrow—come down when you get ready. I told you how to get to th\u0027 Double X. If you go over there before any of \u0027em come to town, let \u0027em know that I\u0027m countin\u0027 on usin\u0027 three of their men when I start my own round-up. See you later.\" \n \n Dawn found activity on the range. The Double X, having rounded up its hundred head the day before, with a few additional to make up for possible rejections, held them apart from the SV herd, which also had extra cattle to offset any not up to the required standard. The majority of them, those which were certain to be accepted, had already been branded. The C and T inspectors watched the cutting out and indicated their choices as the cattle left the round-up herd, those rejected being turned aside and allowed to go back to freedom on the range, while those accepted were driven to the beef cut, which grew rapidly. A hundred and five finally were accepted, the odd five to make up for possible losses on the trail. Then the SV herd went through the same proceeding until four hundred and ten had been thrown into the beef cut. Because of Cimarron\u0027s discriminating judgment in making up the herd there were but few rejections; and, besides, the[312] standard was not high, for, broadly, a cow was a cow. The remaining SV cattle were not returned to their ranch, but were set free to wander where they would. The general round-up would find them later and throw them back then if Arnold wished, although with the coming of the new round-up conditions there would be no great reason to throw them over—the brand would protect his interests, no matter where it was found. There was some talk about the SV cattle, but Johnny was credited as representing Arnold, and the matter was settled by agreeing that the T and C should pay Arnold, direct. Then the road branding began, and when it was over the consolidated herd was held to await the arrival of McCullough. It was then that Sherwood turned to three of his men. \n \n \"Th\u0027 Triangle ain\u0027t asked for no help, but you boys go down an\u0027 give \u0027em a hand,\" he said. \"We\u0027re introducin\u0027 th\u0027 comin\u0027 of th\u0027 general round-up out in this country, an\u0027 we\u0027re doin\u0027 it gradual. There won\u0027t be no thought of us watchin\u0027 out for Arnold\u0027s interests over there, because these inspectors will do that anyhow. Go down an\u0027 show that we\u0027re friendly; an\u0027 from there go to th\u0027 Bar H.\" \n \n On the Triangle the following morning things were running in full blast. After a breakfast eaten by firelight, the outfit was in the saddle at the first flush of dawn, and rode far out on the range. At an agreed-upon point it spread out in a thin line, the riders spaced at irregular intervals, depending upon the nature of the ground, and as they turned and moved back in the direction of Rock Creek they were joined by the Bar H[313] contingent, which took up its position on one end of the line. \n \n Draws, brush, and coulees shed cattle before the advance. A cow with a big, husky, and friskily independent calf arose to its feet and looked wonderingly at the disturbance. Gardner espied her and galloped forward, shouting and waving his hat as he rode. \"G\u0027wan, you! Get goin\u0027!\" \n \n The cow stood irresolute, debating between the lessons of experience and her own wishes, and the pugnacious counseling of her indignant offspring. Deciding in favor of the former, she wheeled and moved away, the rebellious calf protesting by kicking up its heels and by the defiant erectness of its tail. \n \n \"Th\u0027 devil you say!\" grinned Gardner, watching them depart. \"Yo\u0027re big enough to be weaned, you overgrown baby—an\u0027 yo\u0027re shore goin\u0027 to be, for yore ma\u0027s goin\u0027 north.\" \n \n Out of a clump of brush popped a group of two-year-olds, heads up, curious and mildly frightened. They stood defiant until Gardner was nearly upon them, and then his sudden whoop sent them whirling and off toward Rock Creek, discretion overbalancing valor. He gave them no further thought, for they would continue to travel unless crowded too much, and he was too old a hand to do that. A cow with a dogie he let slip through, pity joining hands with common sense in their behalf. It was not his purpose to bother with sickly, stunted youngsters, nor to take from them the maternal care so necessary to their sense of security. \n \n By this time the outpouring of cattle had put a[314] respectable number in front of him, and as others were routed out they more willingly went forward, for the gregarious spirit urged them to join the little herd. Occasionally one having more spirit than the others would wheel around and attempt to escape, but in all instances, except one, the speedy dash of the trained cow-horse headed them off and sent them on the about-face. The exception was a five-year-old steer, crusty and sullen, his hide bearing mute witness to his combativeness. He planted himself on rigid legs, lowered his sweeping horns and without even a grunt of warning charged straight for the watchful horseman. \n \n \"Blasted mosshead,\" muttered Sam, avoiding the rush, and watching some of the cattle which had turned to see how the affair came out before making up their minds to duplicate it. Too old for the drive, Sam would have let him go, except for the bad effect it might have on the rest of the cattle, and except for his own aroused spirit. He swung his rope and it darted up and out, and caught a hind leg of the \"mosshead\" as the pony settled back. There was a blur of over-turning steer, a bellow of rage, injury, and surprise, and a resounding thump. Riding forward and taking up the slack as he went, Sam suddenly took two quick turns of the rope around his pommel, checked the horse, and grinned. Down went the mosshead again with another thump, and before the animal could get on its feet the rope was slipped off his leg, and when he arose he found himself alone. Gardner had seen the waverers start back to freedom and had to leave the craggy fighter to check a catastrophe. Hard riding won out[315] for him and again he went forward. Several weaners shot out of a draw and took great credit to themselves for outwitting the puncher; but Sam saw no use of collecting infants only to have them turned loose at the cut-out. One cow arose, spread its feet apart and moved its low-held head slowly from side to side. He gave it a pitying glance and let it alone. \"Locoed,\" he muttered, and as he spoke it shied at a weed swaying in the wind and went cautiously around it. There came a sudden bellowing ahead and he dashed forward at the pair of bulls who were pawing streams of dirt into the air as they met in the dust cloud, head on, and locked for the fight, their great, muscular backs bowed under the power of straining legs. This was no time for masculine duels and he broke it up with quirt and hat, driving the testy combatants apart and sending them on their ways. Dust arose over the moving herd, under which was turmoil, confusion, the lowing of cows, and the bawling of calves; but it rolled steadily westward, slowly but surely. A rattler coiled swiftly and launched its venomous, dart-shaped head at the horse, which reared up with a snort of terror. Sam, stirred to sudden anger and recklessness, spurned a gun, and leaned over as the horse dropped to all four feet. His quirt whizzed viciously and a headless, splotched body writhed in the dust. \n \n \"I\u0027m purty bad, myself, when I\u0027m riled,\" he told it, and rode on. Shortly afterward a gray streak flashed from a heavy bit of brush, and Sam\u0027s Colt leaped into action, but in vain. The coyote punched a hole in the air and disappeared almost as though it had shrunk[316] into nothing. He grinned: \"That slug will catch you when you stop, less\u0027n you turns out,\" he said. \n \n Rock Creek coming into view, the long line of horsemen became a crescent, the ends moving forward at the center slowed, and soon a circle of riders held the herd on all sides. It slowed, grew compact, and stopped, shifting like a kaleidoscope, the different colors weaving in and out like patches of some animated, changing crazy-quilt. There was good grass here, plenty of water, and no more urging riders. Calves went bawling their panicky ways in frantic search for lost mothers, butting and worrying through the herd, receiving rebuffs and impersonal chastisements as they disturbed their elders. One stood outside the press and bawled like a spoiled child, its defiant tail as high as its sinewy neck and more erect. There came an answering call from the herd and a frantic mother shot out, nosed the squaller, and then both grew instantly silent, contented, and at peace with the turbulent world. \n \n \"G\u0027wan back!\" ordered Lefferts, grinning from ear to ear. \"I\u0027m sayin\u0027 that it\u0027s a great thing to have a ma, you bellerin\u0027 cry-baby.\" \n \n The round-up had taken less time than had been expected and it was decided to go ahead with the cutting out. The riders took turns in going to the horse wrangler\u0027s flimsy rope corral, made by lariats strung from the wheels of the chuck wagon to the pommels of saddles on the backs of old, docile, and well-trained horses. Selecting from their best cutting-out animals, saddles were hastily changed, a quick meal eaten, and then the men rode back to the herd to relieve others,[317] who duplicated the performance. The herd was gently made more compact so as to cover less ground and need fewer riders to loaf in their saddles and hold it, the inspectors rode out in front of it and the cutters-out went to work, trying to pick from the outer fringe of cattle. Cows and steers lumbered from the press and went either to the beef cut, or to freedom, according to the signal of the inspector. Quickly the round-up herd shrunk and the beef cut grew. At first there was some trouble to get the chosen cattle to leave the herd—they tried to rejoin it; but as the beef cut grew it drew more and more until it was hardly more than necessary to start the individual cattle for it. When night fell the original herd had disappeared, its more fortunate units ranging free upon the ranch. The beef cut, allowed to graze and not bothered more than necessary, was headed for a rise, where in due time it bedded down and prepared to spend a quiet, peaceful night. \n \n A passer-by would have come upon a picturesque scene on the banks of Rock Creek that night. The cook\u0027s fire, blazing high, was surrounded by the men off watch, squatted, seated, or reclining as they swapped stories and told jokes. The chuck wagon was magnified and made grotesque by the firelight and shadows, saddled horses tied to it or picketed a short distance away, and the flimsy rope corral running from wagon wheels to stakes driven in the ground, was ready to hold a change of mounts in case of a sudden need. In the distance was the bedded herd, lying on the top of a rise where it could catch any passing breeze, the[318] cattle chewing their cuds and blowing and grunting contentedly. \n \n A yearling bummed among them, filled with the mischievous deviltry of youth, making life miserable for its elders as it stumbled and butted its erratic way. It left a fight or two in its wake and finally fled, abandoning all dignity when a crusty steer arose to chastise it. But the chip on its shoulder remained there until it tried to butt a calf from its warm bed, whereupon the indignant mother scrambled to all fours and sent the disturber on the run for safety. The calf was there because it bore no brand, which would be taken care of on the morrow. The bummer had no excuse to create any trouble over a warmed bed because the night was warm. Finally, the edge gone from its exuberant deviltry, it began to look for a place to sleep—and after barely escaping several thrashings it worked out of the herd and sought a place by itself, doubtless to ruminate upon the cruelties and indignities endured by yearlings. \n \n The four night riders of the first shift went slowly, lazily around the herd, keeping a score or more yards from it, singing and carrying on chanted conversations as they met and passed each other. Gone was the dust and turmoil of the day and in its place had come rest and quiet. Over all the crescent moon, nightly to grow fuller, worked its alchemy on earth and cattle, shedding its soft silvery light. The distant camp fire grew steadily lower and finally glowed like the end of a great cigar, winking as gentle breezes fanned its embers and passed on. Somewhere out on the silvery range a lonely coyote poured a burbling plaint to the moon and[319] passed on like a shadow in search of food to stop the clamoring ache of an empty stomach, gradually approaching the winking fire, where choice titbits might perhaps be found. \n \n \"I want a big chew of tobacco,\" chanted Gardner, as he drew nearer to Reilly, \"An\u0027 I want it bad, for mine\u0027s all gone.\" \n \n \"It allus is,\" sang Reilly. \"Don\u0027t bother that spotted yearlin\u0027 over by them bushes. He\u0027s finally quit his bummin\u0027 an\u0027 has bedded down all by hisself outside th\u0027 herd. You\u0027ll know where he is even if you went blind. He\u0027s real friendly an\u0027 lonesome, an\u0027 likes to converse with everythin\u0027 that passes.\" \n \n \"I know th\u0027 scamp,\" sang Gardner, returning the plug. \"He\u0027s had one gosh-awful time today keepin\u0027 out of a lickin\u0027. I\u0027m sayin\u0027 he earned a dozen.\" Soon he made out Lefferts\u0027 song, who mourned a long-lost love. \n Her hair was th\u0027 color of \u0027lasses, \n As soft as a bundle of wire; \n An\u0027 birds made their nests in its fastness: \n If they didn\u0027t I shore am a liar. \n \n Gardner was stirred by the melody and burst into song out of sympathy: \n Her eyes was as bright as old saddles, \n An\u0027 crossed on th\u0027 end of her nose; \n Her hands was as shapely as paddles \n An\u0027 hung down almost to her toes. \n \n [320] \n \n Lefferts retaliated promptly: \n Her cheeks was as smooth as th\u0027 cactus, \n An\u0027 pink as a big hunk of mud; \n At primpin\u0027 she was allus in practice, \n An\u0027 she was daintily shaped, like a tub. \n \n From across the herd came Reilly\u0027s natural tenor, a little ragged, but still a tenor: \n Her voice was as sweet as a longhorn\u0027s, \n It sounded as soft as a scream; \n I\u0027m scared to roll up in my blankets \n For fear that of her I will dream. \n \n The song was too much for the coyote, and he paused to yield to the craving for harmony reawakened in him. \n \n \"He\u0027s imitatin\u0027 you, Jim,\" chanted Gardner as he passed Lefferts. \"Which same I says is well done.\" \n \n \"Go to th\u0027 devil, an\u0027 join yore tribe,\" sang Jim in delicate repartee, and forthwith began the mournful lay of Clementine: \n In a hut a-mong th\u0027 bushes, all a-long th\u0027 foamin\u0027 brine, \n Lived a min-er, \u0027forty nin-er, an\u0027 his daugh-ter, Clementine. \n She was fair-er than th\u0027 ros-es, an\u0027 her for-m-m, it was di-vine; \n Two dry-goods box-es, without their top-ses, made gaiters for-r my Clementine. \n \n At half-past eleven Gardner rode in to the wagon, aroused the next shift, sought his blankets and was[321] sound asleep before his three shift companions reached the camp. At three o\u0027clock the second shift was relieved by the third, and last, which would stay with the herd until it was taken over by all the others, after breakfast. \n \n The new day brought further developments. Several fires burned not far from the herd, irons projecting from them. The cattle were again cut out and driven away to a new herd, one by one, but this time they were taken close to the fires, and because of their weight and strength two ropers joined in the efforts of branding each animal. The glowing iron bit deeply through hair and into the skin on the left flank, filling the air with bellowing anguish, surprise, and indignation, and the odors of burning hair and flesh. There were fights, balkings, charges, but the hard-working, hard-riding punchers, the deftly cast ropes, and the trained horses, together with waving hats and an occasional revolver shot close to the nose of refractory, pugnacious bulls, and an occasional waved slicker or coat, won out, and the work proceeded at a good pace in spite of the general and apparent confusion. But whatever aspect of confusion there was, very little really existed except among the victims themselves, for the men proceeded along well-established lines, and the work went on as though it were running in a groove. Horses were changed every hour or two, depending upon the rider\u0027s judgment, and the inspectors, with the Triangle foreman, checked off the branded animals as they joined the road-branded herd. This herd grew rapidly and its guards were increased as needed from the ropers[322] and iron men at they became too tired to hold the pace set. All day long the busy scene continued in the dust and the heat of the sun, with a bedlam of noise, an endless weaving and shifting, with lathered horses, sweat-and-dust-grimed riders, shouts of \"Hot iron! Hot iron!\" \"Tally one!\" \"Ropers up!\" and cries of warning and bursts of laughter. It were well that the Double X had sent three men to help; ten would not have been too many. Even with their help there was only one pair of ropers working at the fires and only three cutters-out, the rest being used to hold the two herds of restless cattle; and when night finally put an end to the operations less than half of the trail herd had been branded. \n \n \"Two more days,\" growled an inspector. \"It\u0027s time you fellers throwed this worn-out, ancient way aside, an\u0027 got up even with th\u0027 times. You can build a chute that\u0027ll hold eight head an\u0027 by usin\u0027 stampin\u0027 irons you can turn out from sixty to eighty, yes, sometimes even a hundred, an hour, after you get th\u0027 hang of it. This handful should \u0027a\u0027 been done by noon. If I was you, Huff,\" he said, turning to the Bar H foreman, \"I\u0027d get on th\u0027 jump an\u0027 make a couple of them chutes, an\u0027 lay in half a dozen irons. One iron will do two or three with one heatin\u0027; sometimes, if th\u0027 iron handlers work fast, two irons will stamp th\u0027 whole eight. You\u0027ll laugh when you see \u0027em comin\u0027 out, all branded, eight to a clip; an\u0027 th\u0027 work ain\u0027t near so hard. There ain\u0027t no holdin\u0027, nor ropin\u0027, nor throwin\u0027. Here we\u0027ve toted half a dozen Question Mark irons up here, an\u0027 they ain\u0027t hardly saved us any time. You\u0027ve got plenty of[323] time to put up a chute before we start on yore thousand—if you don\u0027t, we\u0027ll be a week on \u0027em, an\u0027 a week\u0027s too long.\" \n \n His companion nodded emphatically, and offered to superintend the work. \"Ridley can handle th\u0027 tallyin\u0027 for us out here. They\u0027ve all been selected, an\u0027 comin\u0027 as slow as they do, it ain\u0027t no two-man job. Mebby th\u0027 Double X will lend a couple more men to help—they\u0027re finishin\u0027 a pair of chutes up there, an\u0027 know what\u0027s wanted. What you say about it?\" \n \n Big Tom considered, and grudgingly gave his consent. Gus Thompson, tired as he was, volunteered to go to his ranch with the request, and started as soon as he had eaten. And by the night of the second day following, when the road-branded Triangle herd was being held to await the coming of McCullough, two eight-cow chutes were ready on the Bar H for the handling of its thousand head. \n \n The round-up on the Bar H went forward with a swing and when it came time for the road branding the chutes proved their worth. The cattle, driven up in groups of eight, were forced into the long, narrow boxes as fast as the branded group went out at the other end. A bar dropped past the nose of the leader, and another bar dropped behind the last one in. Two men standing on a platform running along the side of the chute, each was handed a freshly heated iron and hurried from animal to animal, stamping the brand on each in turn. All morning the long chutes filled and emptied, the men changing places as they tired, the iron handlers so bothered by the stinging odor of burning hair that[324] none of them worked longer than two or three hours without being relieved. \n \n \"I\u0027m backin\u0027 this here magazine-action brandin\u0027 with a hundred an\u0027 fifty pounds of fightin\u0027 Irish,\" declared Reilly, chuckling at the almost automatic working of the chutes. \"Eight in, stamped an\u0027 out again while we\u0027d be workin\u0027 on one slippery cuss. Seventy th\u0027 last hour for Sam\u0027s chute, an\u0027 Fraser crowdin\u0027 him close; an\u0027 us tenderfeet at it—I\u0027m bettin\u0027 th\u0027 last hour does ninety to th\u0027 chute. We\u0027re gettin\u0027 th\u0027 hang of it, an\u0027 gettin\u0027 it fast.\" \n \n \"Slippin\u0027 along like water down hill,\" laughed Slim, borrowed from his bed and board to help the Bar H. \"Hey, Ridley!\" he called to the busy inspector, \"got any new-fangled improvements that\u0027ll make these chutes do it themselves, so th\u0027 hard-workin\u0027 punchers won\u0027t have to loaf in their saddles, but can set around an\u0027 gamble? Holy Maverick! Look at him tallyin\u0027! He\u0027s shore workin\u0027 harder than he was yesterday.\" \n \n \"Who\u0027s loafin\u0027, you fool?\" snorted Sam, taking breath while the chute was being refilled. \"I\u0027ve stamped close to eight thousand since I climbed up here, an\u0027—Hot iron! Hot iron!\" he yelled as the front bar dropped. \"Wake up, you tramp!\" \n \n \"You\u0027ve got a lot to say, you has!\" snapped Lefferts, running up with the irons. \"All you got to do is push \u0027em ag\u0027in\u0027 their hides—I\u0027m near wore out!\" \n \n \"Why use any bars at all?\" queried Reilly, grinning at the hard-working Sam. \"Just let \u0027em filter through, stamping \u0027em on th\u0027 run. We\u0027re wastin\u0027 time, this way.\" \n \n [325] \n \n \"You\u0027ve got near as much sense as Sam has!\" retorted Lefferts, stirring his fire. \"Which ain\u0027t payin\u0027 neither of you no compliments,\" he grunted. \n \n Big Tom could not deny the advantage of chute and stamping irons, and the ocular demonstration took from him his last reasonable objection to them, although he found fault with them because the herd had to be driven to the same place each round-up, and because he did not believe them to be suitable for calf branding; but when it was pointed out that the cattle had to be driven somewhere before the herd would be worth bothering with, and might as well be driven to the chutes, and that it would be a saving of time to do that, or to build more chutes on the ranch rather than to revert to the old methods, he could not deny it. Regarding the branding of calves there was a division of opinion; but calf branding was not nearly as hard or slow as the branding of grown animals. He knew, however, that the styles were changing, and changing under his eyes, and that for him to become stubborn and set against the change would be to appear ridiculous, and to become a source from which much levity would spring. \n \n The branding done and the tallies compared, the visiting punchers departed for their ranches, the inspectors accepting Big Tom\u0027s invitation to spend the night with him, and rode to the ranchhouse; and the herd, restless, sore, and in sullen mood, was watered well at the muddy pond and thrown upon the high bed ground, and would remain a herd until delivered to McCullough, and for some weeks thereafter. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56744.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
