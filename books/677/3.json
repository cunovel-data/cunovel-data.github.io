{"id":18881,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III AN OBJECTION","content":"Johnny looked forward eagerly to the coming of the outfits for their monthly celebration, and he was not certain that he would not make enemies before the night was over, which impelled him to visit the Bar H and the Triangle while he would be welcome. He had familiarized himself with the SV valley and the country close to the town. Therefore he mounted Pepper after an early breakfast and rode south, passing the shack occupied by the Doc, about two miles south of Gunsight. The Doc was squatting on SV land, had a small corral, a hitching post, and a well. Johnny stopped at the latter and had a drink while he mentally photographed everything in the immediate vicinity. When he started on again he had the choice of two trails. One wound up over Pine Mountain, a high, wooded hill, and was the more direct route to the Bar H; the other followed the river bed around the base of the mountain, and was the trail used by the Triangle. Deciding on the shorter, if more difficult route, he gave Pepper her head and started up the slope. The trail was fair, following, as it did, the line of least resistance and threading through rocky defiles, rocky clefts, and skirting steep walls. Riding down on the south side he found himself in a deep ravine and when he left it he came to the old[26] bed of the river, and a grin came to his face as he pictured the episode of the dynamiting. Following the dried-up bed he entered East Canyon and found its north wall to be perpendicular and remarkably smooth; the other side sloped more, showed great errosion and was scored by clefts and wooded defiles running far back. Emerging from the canyon he rode over a hilly, rolling range and some time later recrossed the old river bed and arrived at the Bar H ranchhouses. Two men were in sight, one mending riding gear and the other had just fixed the fence around the wall. They nodded, and he asked for Big Tom. \"He\u0027s around some\u0027rs,\" said \"Squint\" Farrell, whose name had been well bestowed. \"Git off an\u0027 set down,\" invited the other. \"He won\u0027t be long. Ridin\u0027 fur?\" \"Gunsight,\" answered Johnny. Bill Fraser\u0027s eyes were on Pepper. \"Ever think of swappin\u0027 cayuses?\" he asked. \"Not this one,\" smiled Johnny. \"She\u0027s too dumb—won\u0027t learn nothin\u0027. But I had her since she could stand up, an\u0027 she\u0027s rapid for short distances.\" \"Meanin\u0027 several short distances hooked together,\" suggested Squint. \"I can see she\u0027s dumb—it\u0027s writ\u0027 all over her.\" \"I don\u0027t care,\" said Fraser. \"I\u0027m a great hand with th\u0027 dumb ones. I\u0027m doin\u0027 wonders with Squint.\" \"Shore,\" grunted Squint. \"He owes me so much money I got to do what he says. Here comes Tom, now. He\u0027s some touchy this mornin\u0027. Must \u0027a had a session with them poker deacons last night.\" [27] \"He holds \u0027em too long,\" chuckled Fraser. \"He figgers that if three little deuces are worth a dollar, why two aces an\u0027 two kings is worth a hull lot more.\" \"Does sound reasonable,\" said Squint, \"three deuces makin\u0027 only six, an\u0027 th\u0027 others makin\u0027—a king is thirteen—twenty-six, an\u0027 two more is twenty-eight. That the way you been figgerin\u0027 all these years, Tom?\" Big Tom smiled. \"Howd\u0027y, Nelson. What brings you down here so early?\" \"Curiosity, mostly,\" answered Johnny. \"That an\u0027 not havin\u0027 nothin\u0027 to do. An\u0027 I\u0027m grievin\u0027 about them two dollars Dailey took away from me last night.\" \"Nobody that wiggles away from Dailey an\u0027 only leaves two dollars behind can associate with me steady,\" objected Fraser. \"I got my rights.\" \"Mebby we\u0027ll see him get two more tonight,\" said Squint. \"We\u0027re ridin\u0027 in with money in our pockets.\" \"An\u0027 you\u0027ll travel light returnin\u0027,\" said Big Tom. \"An\u0027 most amazin\u0027 noisy,\" laughed Squint. After a little more idle conversation Johnny pulled his hat more firmly down on his head. \"Well, I just thought I\u0027d drop in an\u0027 say hello. Any place else to go?\" \"Don\u0027t be in no hurry,\" said Big Tom. \"But if yo\u0027re set, you might get acquainted with th\u0027 Triangle—it\u0027s only an hour\u0027s ride. They\u0027ll be in town, too, tonight.\" Johnny nodded all around and rode off the way they pointed. He looked carefully at the brands of the cattle he passed, stopped at the Triangle for a drink and a few minutes conversation with a puncher who[28] was saddling a fresh horse and returned by the trail around the eastern end of Pine Mountain, to Gunsight, where he spent the afternoon playing seven-up with Dave, with indifferent success. Night had scarcely fallen when a whooping down the trail heralded the approach of an outfit. It was from the Triangle and they stamped in eagerly. Dailey, Fanning, and several more of the townsfolk followed them, and it was not long before liquor and cards vied with each other for the honors of the evening. Johnny, declining cards, and going easy with the liquor, watched the games and became better acquainted all around. \"I\u0027m losin\u0027 my holt,\" mourned Dailey. \"Reckon I\u0027m sick.\" \"When you get so sick you can\u0027t move,\" grunted Hank Lewis, foreman of the Triangle, \"I\u0027m comin\u0027 in an\u0027 take yore clothes. You\u0027ll be left like you was born.\" \"You ain\u0027t got a chance, Hank,\" asserted Fanning. \"I live next door to him, an\u0027 I\u0027ll get him first. Here\u0027s a little more to freeze him out.\" \"No man with three jacks ought to sit in this here game at all,\" muttered Gardner, sorrowfully. \"But I\u0027m trailin\u0027.\" \"Now that I know what Sam\u0027s got, I\u0027ll trail, too,\" grinned George Lang. \"Here comes Huff an\u0027 his angels.\" The Bar H arrived tempestuously. Big Tom\u0027s voice could be heard above the noise and he was the first to enter, followed closely by his outfit. He nodded to[29] the crowd and ordered drinks all around. Exchanging a few words with Dave, he approached Johnny. \"Reckon you can hold onto that last pot, Nelson?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ll do my best,\" replied Johnny. \"I\u0027ll have a better chance with Dailey out of our game.\" \"Let\u0027s make up another table,\" said Big Tom, looking around. Fraser joined them, followed by Lefty Carson. \"I\u0027m after more\u0027n two dollars,\" he laughed. \"Dailey allus did play a kid\u0027s game.\" \"Somebody else is pickin\u0027 on me,\" came Dailey\u0027s voice. \"If that Fraser\u0027ll come in some evenin\u0027 I\u0027ll try to suit him. Hey, Dave! What\u0027s th\u0027 matter? Somebody tie you to th\u0027 bar?\" Dave\u0027s retort was not what fiction attributes to a fat man. He was not genial; he was stirred up. \"You go hang! I\u0027m so cussed busy I can\u0027t see. I ain\u0027t no jack rabbit!\" \"He says so hisself!\" shouted Squint, roaring with laughter. \"If I ever sees a jack rabbit lookin\u0027 like Dave, I\u0027ll give him all th\u0027 trail!\" \"Hey, Two-Spot!\" yelled Dave, with a voice which shook the bottles. \"He\u0027s allus around when there\u0027s nobody here—but when there\u0027s a crowd to be waited on, he flits. Hey! Two-Spot!\" Dahlgren held his hand over the bar. \"Gimme a glass of liquor, Dave, an\u0027 I\u0027ll trap him,\" he laughed, looking at his foreman, who had forgotten all about cards and was drinking steadily. Dave looked at him, grinned, and complied. Dahl[30]gren turned, glass held up. \"Order, Gents! Order! Less noise! I\u0027m goin\u0027 to trap a bum-bum an\u0027 have him on show right before you for two bits a head.\" The crowd took it as a wager and would not let him explain. \"All right, you coyotes; let it go that way, then: Two bits apiece that I do,\" he cried, and, the cynosure of all eyes, pranced to the door where he placed the glass on the sill and then lay down along the wall, his hand raised to grasp his quarry. Laughing, he faced the crowd. \"They are \u0027lusive animals. Gents; but they can\u0027t—oh! ho!—resist th\u0027 enticin\u0027 smell of——\" Another roar went up as a hand stole around the glass and whisked it from sight. All oblivious to this, Dahlgren took the shout as a tribute to his humor, and when he could be heard, continued: \"They can\u0027t resist th\u0027 smell of liquor, Gents. When th\u0027 wary bum-bum scents this here glass of fire water,\" pointing—he stopped as another roar went up. \"Well, I\u0027m d—d!\" he grunted. Scrambling to his feet, he plunged out into the night as Two-Spot entered the rear door, carrying the liquor at arm\u0027s length. Two-Spot stopped, gulped down the fiery liquid and, placing the glass on the bar, started to serve the card players, his face grave and serious. The place was in an uproar when Dahlgren returned and he was met by a howling mob of creditors. Shaking his fist at Two-Spot he exhausted his change as he bobbed around in the crowd, got more from Dave and at last managed to pay off. Emitting a yell, he jumped for Two-Spot, grabbed him and began to manhandle[31] him playfully. Others joined in and the sport grew fast and furious, rougher and rougher. Johnny, seeing how things stood, and thinking that Two-Spot was in danger of being hurt, plunged headfirst into the mass of merrymakers, grabbed Two-Spot and, at the first opportunity, threw him reeling toward the door. Leaping after him, he grasped the confused tramp, whispered: \"Vamoose!\" and then yelled out: \"I can\u0027t, huh? We\u0027ll see!\" There was a flurry and Two-Spot shot out of the door as though he had left a bow. Johnny turned and faced the crowd. \"Did you hear him?\" he demanded. \"I showed him if I could, or not. Blast his nerve, to talk like that to me!\" \"Wish he\u0027d said it to me,\" growled Big Tom, whose liquor was making him surly and uncertain. \"I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 busted his cussed neck. This here country is gettin\u0027 too d—d independent. That\u0027s it—too independent. Th\u0027 Bar H runs this country, an\u0027 I run th\u0027 Bar H,\" he boasted, resting against the bar. \"That\u0027s it, an\u0027 it\u0027s got to learn it. It\u0027s got to learn that th\u0027 Bar H runs this country, an\u0027 I run th\u0027 Bar H. Anybody say I don\u0027t?\" he demanded, looking around. Just at this auspicious occasion, Squint was unfortunate enough to step on the foot of a man who had little use for him and who, several times in the last few years, had been restrained only by force from carrying out his thinly veiled threats. Wolf Forbes, the deadliest man on the Bar H, more than disliked Squint, and only their common interests had averted bloodshed. Now he snarled and reached for his gun, but found it held in the holster by Little Tom Carney, who hung[32] to Forbes\u0027 arm like a leech until others came to his and succeeded in taking the killing edge from Wolf\u0027s anger. Wolf struggled, gradually getting free. \"I don\u0027t want him now,\" he panted. \"Let go of me! I\u0027ll get him when he\u0027s sober.\" He wrestled free and went over to his foreman. \"You heard what I said?\" he demanded. \"There won\u0027t be no interference this time!\" Big Tom rocked back on his heels and scowled down at his gunman. \"I heard you,\" he replied. \"An\u0027 I says yo\u0027re makin\u0027 a fool of yoreself. I\u0027m runnin\u0027 this ranch, an\u0027 I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you that I\u0027ll see that he is good an\u0027 sober an\u0027 gets an even break, if it ever comes to gunplay between you two. Take my advice, an\u0027 forget about it.\" He pushed Forbes to one side and waved his arm. \"Everybody have a drink with Big Tom Huff, th\u0027 boss of th\u0027 Bar H. Set \u0027em out, Dave.\" They responded, but the soberer heads began to feel uneasy. Dave looked at Dailey, who exchanged glances with him; and at Johnny who, lounging against the further wall near the card players, was missing nothing. Johnny allowed a faint smile to show, and winked at the proprietor, a knowing, significant wink. If it was meant to bring ease to Dave\u0027s troubled mind, it failed utterly. Worse than that, it acted the other way. \"D—n it!\" thought Dave. \"He\u0027s sober as a hoss an\u0027 cold as h—l\" which anomaly did not strike Dave\u0027s too-busy mind. \"Is he aimin\u0027 to get Huff? Is he nursin\u0027 last night\u0027s play? Here I was hopin\u0027 none of th\u0027 Double X would ride in, an\u0027 Trouble was campin\u0027 under my fat nose all th\u0027 time! H—l will shore pop[33] at the first shot—they\u0027ll shoot him to pieces, an\u0027 no tellin\u0027 who else!\" The card game died gradually and the players nearest the crowd shoved their chairs back. Dave noticed it and shook his head imploringly, trying by sheer will-power to force them back to the game. He failed, and his fears looked to be justified. Big Tom, turning ponderously, looked at them and then stared as their strange inactivity slowly impressed itself on his befuddled mind. \"Go on an\u0027 play!\" he roared. \"I run th\u0027 Bar H—an\u0027 Bar H runs th\u0027 country.\" Dave leaped into the breach. \"They can\u0027t. Dailey\u0027s got all th\u0027 money.\" \"Dailey\u0027s got—Ha! Ha! Ha!\" roared Big Tom. \"He\u0027s th\u0027 ol\u0027 fox. Goin\u0027 to shake han\u0027s with th\u0027 ol\u0027 fox!\" He weaved across the floor and shook Dailey\u0027s hypocritical hand. \"An\u0027 he\u0027s got Nelson\u0027s two pesos! Me an\u0027 Nelson\u0027s goin\u0027 to play a two-hand game for th\u0027 limit—an\u0027 th\u0027 winner\u0027ll tangle up with Dailey.\" That plan did not suit Dave at all. He refilled a glass and slid it across the bar. \"Hey, Tom!\" he called. \"Hey, Tom!\" As the foreman turned clumsily and stared at him, Dave held up the glass. \"I never thought you was so stuck up as to ask th\u0027 boys to drink with you, an\u0027 then throw \u0027em like that!\" \"Who\u0027s stuck up?\" \"Then why didn\u0027t you drink with \u0027em?\" demanded Dave, severely. Huff looked at him and lurched forward. \"Beg boys\u0027 pardon. I\u0027m with th\u0027 boys. I allus drink with th\u0027[34] boys, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t stuck up!\" He gulped the liquor and, spreading his feet, leaned against the bar. \"Th\u0027 Bar H runs this country, an\u0027 I run th\u0027 Bar H. I\u0027ll learn \u0027em, too!\" He threw off two of his men who tried to quiet him, fearing he would say too much. \"I\u0027m all right,\" he assured them. \"I\u0027ll learn \u0027em,\" he continued. \"There\u0027s that minx on th\u0027 SV. I\u0027ll learn her, too. I\u0027ve been layin\u0027 low; but I\u0027ll learn her. I\u0027m not stuck up; but she is. First night I called she tried to sneak out an\u0027 leave me holdin\u0027 th\u0027 sack. But I showed her who was runnin\u0027 this country. She\u0027s a wiry minx, but I kissed——\" \"That\u0027ll do!\" snapped Johnny, the words sounding like the crack of a whip. He leaned forward, away from the wall, his hands hanging limply at his sides. The crowd jumped, and Dave\u0027s heart was severely taxed. \"I don\u0027t know th\u0027 woman, but I objects. The Bar H may run this country, an\u0027 you may run th\u0027 Bar H; but if I hears any more about wimmin I\u0027ll take th\u0027 job of runnin\u0027 you, an\u0027 th\u0027 Bar H, an th\u0027 country, besides, if I has to! I\u0027ve got some rights an\u0027 I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to have my evenin\u0027 spoiled by wimmin! An\u0027 that goes as she lays!\" Big Tom had pushed away from the bar and swung around unsteadily. He blinked, and focused his eyes on the man who had interrupted him, and who spoke about running him. Steadily the meaning of the words hammered at the liquor-paralyzed brain cells, and at last was recognized and understood. His blood-red face wrinkled like the muzzle of an angry dog and the red eyes blazed with murder. Memory tried to inflame[35] him further, and succeeded. He snarled an oath and reached for his gun. There was a flash, a roar, and a cloud of smoke at Johnny\u0027s hip and before the crowd could move they were facing two guns, from one of which trailed a thin wisp of smoke. Big Tom, holding his benumbed hand against his body, looked from it to his gun, which slowly ceased sliding and came to a stop on the floor at the other end of the bar. He appeared to be stupefied. \"I didn\u0027t touch him!\" snapped Johnny. \"I hit his gun. You all saw him draw first. I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to make this personal between him an\u0027 me—an\u0027 so far\u0027s I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s over now. But if anybody has any objections, I\u0027ll hear \u0027em.\" Receiving no reply, he continued, looking out of the corner of his eye at the Bar H foreman: \"Tom, I don\u0027t aim to do you no injury, an\u0027 you can palaver all you wants, an\u0027 have all th\u0027 fun you wants, regardless. That is yore right. But I\u0027ve got rights, too. An\u0027 so has all th\u0027 boys. An\u0027 we ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to hear nobody talk about wimmin. Wimmin is barred all th\u0027 way to th\u0027 ace. I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to listen about \u0027em, at all. They lost me th\u0027 best job I ever had, on the best ranch I ever saw. They drove me clean out of Montanny, to h—l an\u0027 gone. All my troubles have been caused by wimmin—an\u0027 you hear me shout that there ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to be no palaverin\u0027 about \u0027em where I got to hear it. That\u0027s flat; an\u0027 I got two six-guns that says it is. I ain\u0027t holdin\u0027 no grudge ag\u0027in\u0027 you—no more\u0027n yo\u0027re holdin\u0027 ag\u0027in\u0027 me for my mistake last night. We all of us make \u0027em, not meanin\u0027 to. [36] \"This is a man\u0027s town, a man\u0027s saloon, an\u0027 we\u0027re all of us men. We ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to be follered around by no wimmin in talk or otherwise. All in favor of barrin\u0027 wimmin, have a drink with me.\" The invitation was accepted, and Dave followed it by a treat on the house. Then he mopped his head and wearily let his hands hang down at his side. He looked at Johnny and heaved a sigh. \"D—d if you ain\u0027t a he-wizard!\" he muttered. \"A reg\u0027lar sheep-herder!\" Johnny walked over, picked up the gun and handed it to its owner, slapping him on the back at the same time. \"Here, Ol\u0027 Timer,\" he grinned, \"take yore gun. She\u0027s a beauty an\u0027 ain\u0027t hurt a bit. Don\u0027t it beat all how me an you get all mixed up without meanin\u0027 to? I says it\u0027s funny—cussed if it ain\u0027t!\" Big Tom fumbled at the holster, slid the gun into it, and a grin crawled across his face. \"Seems like we are allus buttin\u0027 our fool heads together,\" he replied. \"I\u0027m with you, Nelson. I\u0027m with th\u0027 boys. Th\u0027 h—l with wimmin. They\u0027re barred, an\u0027 I won\u0027t listen about \u0027em, We\u0027re all men—ain\u0027t we, boys?\" \"I reckon so,\" said Dave. He motioned to Squint and Fraser, nodding at Big Tom, and then at the door. \"Hey, Tom,\" called Fraser, \"let\u0027s go home!\" \"Won\u0027t—won\u0027t go home!\" objected Big Tom, lurching forward. Reaching a chair in a corner he fell into it and in a few minutes was snoring sonorously. Dave slid his elbow on the bar and rested his head in his hand. His pose bespoke great weariness. He looked at Johnny and shook his head in bewilderment. Johnny dragged a chair up to the unused second table,[37] made a face at the fat proprietor, and piled up a sizable stack of coins in front of him. \"Any Bar H or Triangle hombre think they can get any of this?\" he demanded, grinning. Four men thought so at the same time; and soon a third game was going on beside them. Two-Spot poked his face up to the window again and looked in. Then he came in with an air of non-chalant confidence. Having seen all that had happened he believed the stormy weather to be over and if it wasn\u0027t, why Nelson seemed to be a friend of his, which sufficed. Dave slid him a partly filled bottle. \"Take it away and don\u0027t bother me,\" said the proprietor. \"I\u0027m restin\u0027 up for th\u0027 next storm.\" Two-Spot looked around. \"You can go to sleep, Dave,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll tend bar for you. There won\u0027t be no more. My friend over there is like his black cayuse—everythin\u0027 in this country is hid back in his dust.\" Turning away, he glanced quickly around, stuck out his tongue at the snoring Mr. Huff, put his bottle on a chair, sat down on another one, rested his feet on the recumbent form of Squint, who snored tenor to his boss\u0027 bass, and appeared to be well pleased with himself.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56724.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
