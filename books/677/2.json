{"id":18880,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II BIT BY BIT","content":"The sun was near the meridian when Johnny rode into Gunsight, a town which he took as a matter of course. They were all alike, he reflected. If it were not for the names they scarcely could be told apart—and it would have been just as well to have numbered them. A collection of shacks, with the over-played brave names. The shack he was riding for was the \"Palace,\" which only rubbed it in. Out of a hundred towns, seventy-five would have their Palace saloon and fifty would have a Delmonico hotel. Dismounting before the door, he went in and saw the proprietor slowly arising from a chair, and he was the fattest man Johnny ever had seen. The visitor\u0027s unintentional stare started the conversation for him. \"Well, don\u0027t you like my looks?\" bridled the proprietor. Johnny\u0027s expression was one of injured innocence. \"Why, I wasn\u0027t seein\u0027 you,\" he explained. \"I was thinkin\u0027—but now that you mention it, I don\u0027t see nothin\u0027 th\u0027 matter with your looks. Should there be?\" The other grunted something, becoming coherent only when the words concerned business. \"What\u0027s yourn?\" \"A drink with you, an\u0027 some information.\" \"Th\u0027 drink goes; but th\u0027 information don\u0027t.\" [7] \"I take it all back,\" soliloquized Johnny. \"This town don\u0027t need a number; it don\u0027t even need a name. It\u0027s different. It\u0027s th\u0027 only one this side of Montanny where the barkeeper was hostile at th\u0027 start. I\u0027m peaceful. My han\u0027s are up, palm out. If you won\u0027t give me information, will you tell me where I can eat an\u0027 sleep? Which of th\u0027 numerous hotels ain\u0027t as bad as th\u0027 rest of \u0027em?\" Davis Lee Beauregard Green slid a bottle across the bar, sent a glass spinning after it, leaned against the back bar and grinned. \"Gunsight ain\u0027t impressin\u0027 you a hull lot?\" he suggested. \"Why not? It\u0027s got all a man needs, which is why towns are made, ain\u0027t it?\" Johnny tasted the liquor and downed it. \"I allus size up a town by th\u0027 liquor it sells. I say Gunsight is a d—d sight better than I thought from a superficial examination.\" Dave Green, wise in the psychology of the drinking type, decided that the stranger was not and never had been what he regarded as a drinking man; and even went so far in a quick, spontaneous flash of thought, as to tell himself that the stranger never had been drunk. Now, in his opinion, a hard-drinking, two-gun man was \"bad;\" but a coldly sober, real two-gun man was worse, although possibly less quarrelsome. He was certain that they lived longer. Dave was a good man with a short gun, despite his handicap; but a stirring warning instinct had told him that this stranger was the best who ever had entered his place. This impression came, was recognized, tabbed, and shoved back in his memory, all in a mechanical way. It was too plain to[8] be overlooked by a man who, perhaps without realizing it, studied humanity, although he could not lay a finger on a single thing and call it by name. Dave put the bottle back and washed the glass. \"Well,\" he remarked, \"every man sizes things up accordin\u0027 to his own way of thinkin\u0027, which is why there are so many different opinions about th\u0027 same thing.\" Letting this ponderous nugget sink in, he continued: \"I reckon th\u0027 bottom of it all is a man\u0027s wants. You want good liquor, so a town\u0027s good, or bad. Which is as good a way as any other, for it suits you. But, speakin\u0027 about eatin\u0027-houses, there\u0027s a hotel just around th\u0027 corner. It\u0027s th\u0027 only one in town. It butts up agin\u0027 th\u0027 corner of my rear wall. Further than sayin\u0027 I\u0027ve et there, I got no remarks to make. I cook my own, owin\u0027 to th\u0027 pressure of business, an\u0027 choice.\" \"It ain\u0027t run by no woman, is it?\" asked Johnny. \"No; why?\" Johnny grinned. \"I\u0027m ridin\u0027 clear of wimmin. It was wimmin that sent me roamin\u0027 over th\u0027 face of th\u0027 earth, a wanderer. My friends all got married, an\u0027—oh, well, I drifted. Th\u0027 first section I come to where there ain\u0027t none, I\u0027ll tie fast; an\u0027 this country looks like a snubbin\u0027 post, to me.\" \"You lose,\" chuckled Dave. \"There\u0027s one down here, an\u0027 some folks think she\u0027s considerable. What\u0027s more, she\u0027s lookin\u0027 for a good man to run her dad\u0027s ranch, an\u0027 get an outfit together, as will stay put. But if you don\u0027t like \u0027em, that loses th\u0027 job for you. An\u0027 I reckon yo\u0027re right lucky at that.\" \"Shore; I know th\u0027 kind of a \u0027good\u0027 man they want,\"[9] said Johnny, reminiscently. \"\u0027Good,\u0027 meanin\u0027 habits only. A man that don\u0027t smoke, chew, drink, cuss, get mad, or keep his hat on in th\u0027 house. Losin\u0027 th\u0027 job ain\u0027t bendin\u0027 my shoulders. I ain\u0027t lookin\u0027 for work; I\u0027m dodgin\u0027 it. Goin\u0027 to loaf till my money peters out, which won\u0027t be soon. You\u0027d be surprised if you knowed how many people between here an\u0027 Montanny think they can play poker. Just now I\u0027m a eddicator. I\u0027m peddlin\u0027 knowledge to th\u0027 ignorant, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t no gambler, at that!\" Dave chuckled. \"There\u0027s some around here, too. Now, me; I\u0027m different. I can\u0027t play, an\u0027 I know it; but, of course, I\u0027ll set in, just for th\u0027 excitement of it, once in a while, if there ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 else to do. Come to think of it, I got a deck of cards around here some\u0027rs, right now.\" The rear door opened and closed. Johnny looked up and saw the worst-looking tramp of his experience. The newcomer picked up a sand-box cuspidor and started with it for the street. \"Hi, stranger!\" called Johnny. \"Ain\u0027t that dusty work?\" The tramp stiffened. He hardly could believe his ears. The tones which had assailed them were so spontaneously friendly that for a moment he was stunned. It had been a long time since he had been hailed like that—far too long a time. He turned his head slowly and looked and believed, for the grin which met his eyes was as sincere as the voice. It made him honest in his reply. \"No,\" he said, \"this here\u0027s sand.\" [10] \"But ain\u0027t yore throat dusty?\" Two-Spot put the box down. \"Seems like it allus is. If these boxes get dusty, I\u0027ll know how it come about, me bendin\u0027 over \u0027em like I do, an\u0027 breathin\u0027 on \u0027em.\" Johnny laughed. \"I take it we\u0027re all dusty.\" He turned to Dave. \"Got three left?\" Two-Spot walked up to the bar. Usually he sidled. He picked up his glass and held it up to the light, and drank it in three swallows. Usually it was one gulp. Wiping his lips on a sleeve, he pushed back the glass, dug down into a pocket and brought up a silver dollar, which he tossed onto the bar. \"Fill \u0027em again, Dave,\" he said, quietly. At this Dave\u0027s slowly accumulating wonder leaped. He looked at the coin and from it to Two-Spot. Sensing the situation, Johnny pushed it farther along towards the proprietor. \"Our friend is right, Dave,\" he said, \"two is company. Make mine th\u0027 same.\" Two-Spot put down his empty glass and grinned. \"I\u0027ll now go on from where I was interrupted, Gents,\" and, picking up the box, went towards the door. As he was about to pass through he saw Pepper, and he stopped. \"Good, Lord!\" he muttered. \"What a hoss! I\u0027ve seen passels of hosses, but never one like that. Midnight her name oughter be, or Thunderbolt.\" He turned. \"Stranger, what name do you call that hoss?\" Johnny looked around. \"That\u0027s Pepper.\" Two-Spot grinned. \"Did you see that?\" he demanded, tilting the box until the sand ran out. \"Did you see it? She knows her name like a child. Well,[11] it\u0027s a good name—a fair name,\" he hedged. \"But, shucks! There ain\u0027t no name fit for that hoss! How fur has she come today?\" \"Near forty miles,\" answered Johnny. \"I say it ag\u0027in—there ain\u0027t no name fit for that hoss. She looks like she come five,\" and he passed out. \"Don\u0027t mind him,\" said Dave. \"But where did he git that dollar? Steal it? Find it? Reckon he found it. I near dropped dead. Pore devil—he come here last winter an\u0027 walks in, cleans my boxes an\u0027 sweeps. Then he goes \u0027round to th\u0027 hotel an\u0027 mops an\u0027 cleans th\u0027 pans better than they ever was before. He was so handy an\u0027 useful that we let him stay. An\u0027 I\u0027ve never seen him more than half drunk—it\u0027s amazin\u0027 th\u0027 liquor he can hold.\" \"Sleep here?\" \"No; an\u0027 nobody knows where he does sleep. He\u0027s cunnin\u0027 as a fox, an\u0027 fooled \u0027em every time. But wherever it is, it\u0027s dry.\" Johnny produced a Sharp\u0027s single-shot cartridge. \"Where can I get some of these Specials?\" he asked. Dave looked at it \"\u0027.45-120-550\u0027—you won\u0027t get none of \u0027em down in this country.\" \"Post office in town?\" \"Not yet. Th\u0027 nearest is Rawlins, thirty mile east, with th\u0027 worst trail a man ever rode. Th\u0027 next is Highbank, forty mile south. We use that, for th\u0027 trail\u0027s good. We get mail about twice a month. Th\u0027 Bar H an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle take turns at it.\" \"Then I\u0027ll write for some of these after I feed. I\u0027ll[12] tell \u0027em to send \u0027em to you, at Highbank. What name will I give?\" \"Dave Green, Highbank-Gunsight mail. But you better write before you eat. This is goin\u0027 away day, an\u0027 th\u0027 Bar H will be in any minute now.\" Johnny arose. \"Not before I eat. I ain\u0027t had nothin\u0027 since daybreak, an\u0027 it\u0027s afternoon now. I hate letter writin\u0027; an\u0027 if I don\u0027t eat soon I\u0027ll get thin.\" \"Then don\u0027t eat—\u0027though I wasn\u0027t thinkin\u0027 of you when I spoke,\" growled Dave. \"Wish I was in danger of gettin\u0027 thin.\" \"What you care?\" demanded Johnny. \"Yo\u0027re healthy, an\u0027 yore job don\u0027t call for a man bein\u0027 light.\" \"That\u0027s th\u0027 way you fellers talk,\" said Dave. \"I\u0027m short-winded, I\u0027m in my own way, an\u0027 the joke of th\u0027 country. I can\u0027t ride a hoss—why, cuss it, I can\u0027t even get a gun out quick enough to get a hop-toad before he\u0027s moved twenty feet!\" \"Pullin\u0027 a gun has its advantages, I admits,\" replied Johnny, who had his own ideas about Dave\u0027s ability in that line. Dave, he thought, could get a gun out quick enough for the average need—being a bartender, and still alive, was proof enough of that. He walked toward the door. \"If you was to get a big hoss—a single-footer, you could ride, all right.\" He went around and entered the hotel, mentally numbering it. Arranging for a week\u0027s board and bed for himself and Pepper, he hurried out to the wash bench just outside the dining-room door, where he found two tin basins, a bucket of water, a cake of yellow soap, a towel, and two men using them all. Taking his turn[13] he in turn followed them into the dining-room and chose the fourth and last table, which was next to a window. The meal was better than he had expected but, hungry as he was, he did not eat as hurriedly as was his habit. Fragments of the conversation of the two punchers in the corner reached and interested him. It had to do with the SV ranch, as near as he could judge, and helped him to build the skeleton upon which he hoped to hang a body by dint of investigation and questioning. The episode of that morning had occurred on the SV ranch if the brands on the cattle he had seen meant anything. The woman\u0027s name was Arnold, and she had a father and a brother, the latter a boy. There was a fragment about \"th\u0027 Doc,\" but just what it was he did not hear, except that it was coupled to the Bar H. Also, something was afoot, but it was so cautiously mentioned that he gained no information about it. Finishing before him, the two men went out, and soon rode past the window, mounted on Triangle horses. He rattled his cup and ordered it refilled, and when the waiter slouched back with it, Johnny slid a perfectly good cigar across the table and waved his hand. \"Sit down, an\u0027 smoke. You ought to rest while you got th\u0027 chance.\" The waiter lost some of his slouch and obeyed, nodding his thanks. \"Are you punchin\u0027?\" he asked. \"When I\u0027m broke,\" answered Johnny. \"Just now I\u0027m ridin\u0027 around lookin\u0027 at th\u0027 scenery. Never knowed we had any out here till I heard some Easterners goin\u0027 mad about it. I\u0027ve been tryin\u0027 to find it ever since. But, anyhow, punchin\u0027 is shore monotonous.\" [14] \"If you can show me anythin\u0027 monotoner than this job, I\u0027ll eat it,\" growled the waiter. \"It\u0027s hell on wheels for me.\" \"Oh, this whole range is monotonous,\" grunted Johnny. \"Reckon nothin\u0027 interestin\u0027 has happened down here since Moses got lost. But there\u0027s one thing I like about it—there ain\u0027t no woman in thirty miles.\" \"You foller Clear River into Green Valley, which is SV, an\u0027 you\u0027ll change yore mind,\" chuckled the waiter. \"She\u0027ll chase you off, too.\" \"I\u0027ll be cussed. An\u0027 she\u0027s suspicious of strangers?\" \"Don\u0027t put no limit on it like that; she\u0027s suspicious of everythin\u0027 that wears pants.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"Well, her cows has been wanderin\u0027 off, lookin\u0027 for better grass, I reckon, an\u0027 she thinks they\u0027re bein\u0027 drove.\" Johnny pictured the valley, but hid his smile. \"Oh, well; you can\u0027t blame the cows. They\u0027ll find th\u0027 best. Any ranches \u0027round here run by men?\" \"Shore; three of \u0027em. There\u0027s th\u0027 Bar H, an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle, an\u0027 over west is th\u0027 Double X, but it\u0027s ranchhouse is so fur from here that it\u0027s a sort of outsider. It\u0027s th\u0027 biggest, th\u0027 Bar H is next, an\u0027 then comes th\u0027 Triangle. Th\u0027 Triangle don\u0027t hardly count, neither \u0027though it\u0027s close by.\" \"What about th\u0027 SV you mentioned? An\u0027 what\u0027s yore name?\" \"My name\u0027s George. Th\u0027 SV has gone to th\u0027 dogs since it was sold. It ain\u0027t a ranch no more. Of course, it\u0027s got range, an\u0027 water, an\u0027 some cows, an\u0027 a couple[15] of buildin\u0027s—but it ain\u0027t got no outfit. Old Arnold, his gal, an\u0027 his kid—all tenderfeet—are tryin\u0027 to run it.\" \"But they\u0027ve got to have punchers,\" objected Johnny. \"They can\u0027t keep \u0027em, though I ain\u0027t sayin\u0027 why,\" replied George mysteriously. \"Does th\u0027 Doc own th\u0027 Bar H?\" asked Johnny. \"Lord, no! It owns him—but, say; you\u0027ll have to excuse me. I got work to do. See you at supper. So long.\" Johnny left and rode back the way he had come that morning, lost in meditation. Reaching the rim of the valley he looked down over the rolling expanse of vivid green, here and there broken by shallow draws, with their brush and trees. He noticed an irregular circle of posts just south of him and close to the river. Experience told him what they meant, and he frowned. Here was a discordant note—that enclosure, small as it was, was a thing sinister, malevolent, to him almost possessing a personality. Turning from the quicksands he sat and gazed at the nest of rocks below him until Pepper, well trained though she was, became restless and thought it time to move. Stirring, he smiled and pressed a knee against her and as he rode away he shook his head. \"Yes, girl, I\u0027m still a-rollin\u0027—an\u0027 I don\u0027t know where to.\" After supper he talked with George until they heard the creaking of wheels and harness. Looking up they saw four heavy horses slowly passing the window, followed by a huge, covered wagon with great, heavy wheels having four-inch tires. A grizzled, whiskered,[16] weather-beaten patriarch handled the lines and talked to his horses as though they were children. \"Now I got to make a new fire an\u0027 cook more grub,\" growled George, arising. \"Why can\u0027t he get here in time for supper? He\u0027s allus late, goin\u0027 an\u0027 comin\u0027.\" \"Who is he, an\u0027 where\u0027s he from?\" \"Ol\u0027 Buffaler Wheatley from Highbank. He\u0027s goin\u0027 up to Juniper an\u0027 Sherman.\" \"He come from Highbank today?\" demanded Johnny, surprised. \"Shore—an\u0027 he must \u0027a\u0027 come slow.\" \"Slow? Forty miles with that in a day, an\u0027 he come slow?\" retorted Johnny. \"He was lucky to get here before midnight. If you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 done what that old feller has today, you\u0027d not think much of anybody as wanted you on hand at supper time.\" \"Mebby yo\u0027re right,\" conceded George, dubiously, as he went into the kitchen. Johnny arose and went out to the shed where the driver was flexing his muscles. \"Howd\u0027y,\" he said. \"Got th\u0027 waggin where you want it?\" \"Howd\u0027y, friend,\" replied Buffalo, looking out from under bushy brows. \"I reckon so. \u0027Most any place\u0027ll do. Ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 \u0027round\u0027ll scratch th\u0027 polish off it,\" he grinned. Johnny laughed and began unhitching the tired, patient horses, and his deft fingers had it done before Buffalo had any more than started. \"Fine hosses,\" he complimented, slapping the big gray at his side. \"You must treat \u0027em well.\" \"I do,\" said Buffalo. \"I may abuse myself, some[17]times, but not these here fellers. They\u0027ll pull all day, an\u0027 are as gentle as kittens.\" \"How do you find freightin\u0027?\" asked Johnny, leading his pair into the shed. \"Pickin\u0027 up, an\u0027 pickin\u0027 fast,\" answered Buffalo, following with the second team. \"It\u0027s gettin\u0027 too much for one old man an\u0027 this waggin. An\u0027 top of that I got th\u0027 mail contract I been askin\u0027 for for years. So I got to put on another waggin an\u0027 make th\u0027 trip every week \u0027stead of only when th\u0027 freight piles up enough to make it worth while. Reckon I\u0027ll break my boy in on th\u0027 new waggin.\" \"I\u0027ll leave th\u0027 feedin\u0027 to you,\" said Johnny, leaning against the wall. \"You know what they need.\" \"All right, friend; much obliged to you. I just let \u0027em eat all th\u0027 hay they can hold an\u0027 give \u0027em their measures of oats. I have to carry them with me—can\u0027t get none away from Highbank, everythin\u0027 up here bein\u0027 grass fed.\" \"I feed oats when I can get \u0027em,\" replied Johnny. \"I allus reckon a corn-fed hoss has more bottom.\" \"Shore has—if they\u0027re that kind,\" agreed Buffalo. \"Travel th\u0027 same way all th\u0027 time?\" \"Yes. I won\u0027t gain nothin\u0027 goin\u0027 t\u0027other way \u0027round,\" answered Buffalo, busy with his pets. \"You see I allus come north loaded. Th\u0027 first stop, after here, is Juniper, where I loses part of th\u0027 load. That\u0027s thirty miles from here, an\u0027 th\u0027 road\u0027s good. Then I cross over to Sherman, lose th\u0027 rest of th\u0027 load, an\u0027 come back from there light—it\u0027s fifty mile of hard travelin\u0027. Goin\u0027 like I do I has th\u0027 good, short haul with th\u0027 heavy[18] load; comin\u0027 back I have a light waggin on th\u0027 long, mean haul. If I went to Sherman first, things would just be turned \u0027round.\" \"What do you do when you have passengers for Sherman?\" \"Don\u0027t want none!\" snorted Buffalo. \"Wouldn\u0027t carry \u0027em to Sherman, anyhow. Anybody with sense that can sit a hoss wouldn\u0027t crawl along with me in th\u0027 heat an\u0027 dust on that jouncin\u0027 seat. But sometimes I has a tenderfoot to nurse, consarn \u0027em. They ask so many fool questions I near go loco. But they pays me well for it, you bet!\" \"Anythin\u0027 else I can give you a hand with?\" asked Johnny, following the old man out of the shed. \"No, thankee; I\u0027m all done. Th\u0027 only man that can give me a hand now is that scamp, George. I\u0027m goin\u0027 in to eat, friend. Got to be up an\u0027 be on my way before th\u0027 sun comes up. I get th\u0027 cool of th\u0027 mornin\u0027 for my team, an\u0027 give \u0027em a longer rest when she gets hot. If you see Jim Fanning, tell him I\u0027m buyin\u0027 hides as a side line now. I pays spot cash for \u0027em, same price as Ol\u0027 Saunders would pay, less th\u0027 freight. He has quit th\u0027 business an\u0027 went to live with his married da\u0027ter, ol\u0027 fool!\" \"Fanning sell hides?\" \"No; I just want him to know so he can tell th\u0027 Bar H an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle an\u0027 mebby th\u0027 Double X. I want to have a good load goin\u0027 back from here. There ain\u0027t no profit in goin\u0027 all th\u0027 way back with an empty waggin. Well, good night, friend! I\u0027m much obliged to you.\" \"That\u0027s all right,\" smiled Johnny. \"I\u0027ll tell him.[19] Good night; an\u0027 good luck!\" he added as an after-thought, and then drifted around to the saloon, where he found several men at the bar. Dave performed the introductions, and added: \"Nelson, here, says he ain\u0027t goin\u0027 back punchin\u0027 cows as long as his money lasts. He\u0027s a travelin\u0027 eddicator in th\u0027 innercent game of draw—or was it studhoss, Nelson?\" \"Draw is closer to my heart,\" laughed Johnny. \"My friend, Tex, told me I might learn draw if I lived long enough; but I\u0027d have to have a pack of cards buried with me an\u0027 practice in th\u0027 other world if I aimed to learn studhoss.\" \"It grieves me to see a young man wastin\u0027 his time in idleness,\" said Ben Dailey, the storekeeper. \"Th\u0027 devil is allus lookin\u0027 for holts. Young men should keep workin\u0027. Might I inquire if you feel like indulgin\u0027 in a little game of draw? You\u0027ll find us rusty, though.\" \"We don\u0027t play oftener than every night, an\u0027 some afternoons,\" said Fanning. \"I\u0027m a little scared when a man says he\u0027s rusty,\" replied Johnny. \"But I reckon I might as well lose tonight as later. I hope Dave is too busy to cut in—he said he don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about it.\" \"Dave\u0027s still cuttin\u0027 his teeth,\" chuckled Jim Fanning; \"but he uses my silver to cut \u0027em on. When he learns th\u0027 game I\u0027m goin\u0027 to drift out of town while I still got a cayuse.\" Two punchers came stamping in and Dave nodded to them. \"Here\u0027s yore victims; here\u0027s them infants from th\u0027 Double X. Boys, say \u0027Howd\u0027y\u0027 to Mr. Nelson.[20] Nelson, that tall, red-headed feller is Slim Hawkes; an\u0027 that bowlegged towhead is Tom Wilkes. They ain\u0027t been in here in three months, an\u0027 they\u0027ve rid twenty miles to rob us.\" \"An\u0027 we might walk home,\" retorted Wilkes. \"Let\u0027s lay th\u0027 dust before we starts anythin\u0027. Nelson, yo\u0027re in bad company. This gang would rob a church. You want to get a kneehold an\u0027 hang onto th\u0027 pommel after this game starts. Here\u0027s how!\" As the game progressed the few newcomers who straggled in felt their interest grow. As each finished his drink, Dave would lean forward and whisper: \"There\u0027s what I call a poker game. Four highway-men playin\u0027 \u0027em close. To listen to \u0027em you\u0027d think they never saw a card before.\" Johnny was complaining. \"Gents, I know I\u0027m ignorant—but would you advise me to draw to a pair of treys? Shall I hold up an ace, or take three cards? I\u0027ll chance it; I never hold a sider. Gimme three.\" \"Ain\u0027t that just my luck,\" sighed Ben. \"An\u0027 me with three of a kind.\" A little later Johnny picked up another hand and frowned at it \"Well, seein\u0027 as I allus hold up a sider, I\u0027ll have two, this time.\" Hoofbeats drummed up and stopped, and a voice was heard outside. Dave looked at the calendar. \"Big Tom\u0027s a day ahead—he ain\u0027t due for his spree till pay-day. Hello, Huff! What you doin\u0027 so fur from home?\" \"Hello, Dave! Hello, boys!\" said the newcomer. \"I feel purty good tonight. Just got word that Mc[21]Cullough wants two thousand head from us fellers up here. He\u0027ll be along with his reg\u0027lar trail outfit in a few weeks. Sixteen men, a four-mule chuck waggin, an\u0027 nine saddle hosses to th\u0027 man. I\u0027m sendin\u0027 word that I can give him a thousand head, an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle is goin\u0027 to give him five hundred; so he\u0027ll want five hundred from th\u0027 Double X, which Slim an\u0027 Tom can tell Sherwood.\" \"Shore,\" growled Slim, and his ranch mate nodded. \"Goin\u0027 up to Dodge again?\" queried Dailey. \"He didn\u0027t say,\" answered Big Tom. \"Who\u0027s doin\u0027 the scalpin\u0027?\" he asked, going over to the table, where he gradually grew more restless as he watched. \"Some of these days, when I grows up,\" grinned Wilkes, \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 up th\u0027 trail with a herd, like a reg\u0027lar cow-puncher. Dodge may be top-heavy with marshals, but I\u0027d like to see it again, with money in my pockets.\" Slim grunted. \"Huh!\" He looked over his hand, and drawled: \"Th\u0027 last time you went up you put on too many airs. Just because Cimarron let you play segundo once in a while when he went on ahead to size up th\u0027 water or some river we would have to cross, you got too puffed up. I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to be th\u0027 second boss th\u0027 next trip, an\u0027 I\u0027ll hand you a few jobs that\u0027ll keep you out of mischief.\" Big Tom watched the winner rake in the chips and could stand it no longer. \"Say,\" he growled, \"anybody gettin\u0027 tired, an\u0027 want to drop out?\" Dailey looked up. \"I only won two dollars in two hours, an\u0027 I got some work to do. Everybody bein\u0027 willin\u0027, I\u0027ll go out an\u0027 bury my winnin\u0027s.\" [22] Big Tom took his place. \"I\u0027m shore of one thing: I can\u0027t lose th\u0027 ranch, for I don\u0027t own it.\" A round or two had been played when Big Tom drew his first openers. Johnny raised it and cards were drawn. After it had gone around twice, the others dropped out. Big Tom raised and Johnny helped it along. The betting became stiffer and Big Tom laughed. \"I hope you keep on boostin\u0027 her.\" \"You can\u0027t get me out of this pot with dynamite,\" replied Johnny, pushing out a raise. Big Tom\u0027s gun was out before he left his seat. His chair crashed backward and he leaned over the table. \"Meanin\u0027?\" he snarled. Johnny, surprised, kept his hand on the chips. \"What I said,\" he answered, evenly. \"Tom!\" yelled Dave. \"He don\u0027t mean nothin\u0027! He\u0027s a stranger down here.\" Big Tom\u0027s scowl faded at the words. \"I reckon I was hasty, Nelson,\" he said. Johnny spoke slowly, his voice metallic \"You was so hasty you come near never gettin\u0027 over it. Put down th\u0027 gun.\" \"I\u0027m a mite touchy at——\" \"If you has anythin\u0027 to say, put—down—that—gun.\" \"No offense?\" \"For th\u0027 third time: Put—down—that—gun.\" Big Tom shook his head and appeared to be genuinely sorry. He slid the gun back and picked up his chair. \"You raised?\" \"I did. I advise you to call—and end it.\" [23] \"She\u0027s called. Five little hearts,\" said Big Tom, lying down his cards. \"They\u0027re hasty, too. Queen full, count \u0027em. Let\u0027s liquor.\" The foreman paused in indecision. \"Nelson——\" \"We all get touchy,\" interrupted Johnny, scraping in the winnings. \"Will you drink with me?\" \"I\u0027ll take the same,\" said Big Tom, and he bought the next round, nodded his good night and went out. Johnny turned to Dave. \"Will you oblige me by tellin\u0027 me what Mr. Huff got huffy about?\" Dave hesitated, but Slim Hawkes laughed and answered for him, his slow drawl enhancing the humor of his tale, and wrinkles playing about his eyes and lips told of the enjoyment the picture gave to him. \"Clear River crossed our range, flowed through Little Canyon, made a big bend on th\u0027 Bar H, passed out of East Canyon, an\u0027 flowed down the middle of th\u0027 SV. Three years ago a piece of Little Canyon busted loose an\u0027 slid down, blockin\u0027 th\u0027 river, which backed up, getting\u0027 higher an\u0027 higher, an\u0027 began to cut through its bank about three miles above. Big Tom got busy, pronto. He sends for a box of dynamite, sticks it around in th\u0027 débris an\u0027 let\u0027s her go—all of it. When th\u0027 earthquake stopped there was a second one in th\u0027 dust an\u0027 smoke—we all thought it was a delayed charge. It wasn\u0027t. It was a section of th\u0027 canyon wall, near a hundred feet long an\u0027 almost two hundred feet high. There was a shale fault runnin\u0027 down from th\u0027 top, back about forty feet. Everythin\u0027 in front of that was jarred loose an\u0027 slid. Th\u0027 canyon was choked so hard an\u0027[24] fast that it won\u0027t never get open again. Clear River kept right on a-cuttin\u0027, an\u0027 it now flows on th\u0027 other side of Pine Mountain, which means th\u0027 Bar H ain\u0027t got no water of its own, except a few muddy holes south an\u0027 west of th\u0027 ranch buildings. That\u0027s why he\u0027s touchy. But that\u0027s a long speech, an\u0027 a dry one. Let\u0027s all liquor again.\"The sun was near the meridian when Johnny rode into Gunsight, a town which he took as a matter of course. They were all alike, he reflected. If it were not for the names they scarcely could be told apart—and it would have been just as well to have numbered them. A collection of shacks, with the over-played brave names. The shack he was riding for was the \"Palace,\" which only rubbed it in. Out of a hundred towns, seventy-five would have their Palace saloon and fifty would have a Delmonico hotel. Dismounting before the door, he went in and saw the proprietor slowly arising from a chair, and he was the fattest man Johnny ever had seen. The visitor\u0027s unintentional stare started the conversation for him. \"Well, don\u0027t you like my looks?\" bridled the proprietor. Johnny\u0027s expression was one of injured innocence. \"Why, I wasn\u0027t seein\u0027 you,\" he explained. \"I was thinkin\u0027—but now that you mention it, I don\u0027t see nothin\u0027 th\u0027 matter with your looks. Should there be?\" The other grunted something, becoming coherent only when the words concerned business. \"What\u0027s yourn?\" \"A drink with you, an\u0027 some information.\" \"Th\u0027 drink goes; but th\u0027 information don\u0027t.\" [7] \"I take it all back,\" soliloquized Johnny. \"This town don\u0027t need a number; it don\u0027t even need a name. It\u0027s different. It\u0027s th\u0027 only one this side of Montanny where the barkeeper was hostile at th\u0027 start. I\u0027m peaceful. My han\u0027s are up, palm out. If you won\u0027t give me information, will you tell me where I can eat an\u0027 sleep? Which of th\u0027 numerous hotels ain\u0027t as bad as th\u0027 rest of \u0027em?\" Davis Lee Beauregard Green slid a bottle across the bar, sent a glass spinning after it, leaned against the back bar and grinned. \"Gunsight ain\u0027t impressin\u0027 you a hull lot?\" he suggested. \"Why not? It\u0027s got all a man needs, which is why towns are made, ain\u0027t it?\" Johnny tasted the liquor and downed it. \"I allus size up a town by th\u0027 liquor it sells. I say Gunsight is a d—d sight better than I thought from a superficial examination.\" Dave Green, wise in the psychology of the drinking type, decided that the stranger was not and never had been what he regarded as a drinking man; and even went so far in a quick, spontaneous flash of thought, as to tell himself that the stranger never had been drunk. Now, in his opinion, a hard-drinking, two-gun man was \"bad;\" but a coldly sober, real two-gun man was worse, although possibly less quarrelsome. He was certain that they lived longer. Dave was a good man with a short gun, despite his handicap; but a stirring warning instinct had told him that this stranger was the best who ever had entered his place. This impression came, was recognized, tabbed, and shoved back in his memory, all in a mechanical way. It was too plain to[8] be overlooked by a man who, perhaps without realizing it, studied humanity, although he could not lay a finger on a single thing and call it by name. Dave put the bottle back and washed the glass. \"Well,\" he remarked, \"every man sizes things up accordin\u0027 to his own way of thinkin\u0027, which is why there are so many different opinions about th\u0027 same thing.\" Letting this ponderous nugget sink in, he continued: \"I reckon th\u0027 bottom of it all is a man\u0027s wants. You want good liquor, so a town\u0027s good, or bad. Which is as good a way as any other, for it suits you. But, speakin\u0027 about eatin\u0027-houses, there\u0027s a hotel just around th\u0027 corner. It\u0027s th\u0027 only one in town. It butts up agin\u0027 th\u0027 corner of my rear wall. Further than sayin\u0027 I\u0027ve et there, I got no remarks to make. I cook my own, owin\u0027 to th\u0027 pressure of business, an\u0027 choice.\" \"It ain\u0027t run by no woman, is it?\" asked Johnny. \"No; why?\" Johnny grinned. \"I\u0027m ridin\u0027 clear of wimmin. It was wimmin that sent me roamin\u0027 over th\u0027 face of th\u0027 earth, a wanderer. My friends all got married, an\u0027—oh, well, I drifted. Th\u0027 first section I come to where there ain\u0027t none, I\u0027ll tie fast; an\u0027 this country looks like a snubbin\u0027 post, to me.\" \"You lose,\" chuckled Dave. \"There\u0027s one down here, an\u0027 some folks think she\u0027s considerable. What\u0027s more, she\u0027s lookin\u0027 for a good man to run her dad\u0027s ranch, an\u0027 get an outfit together, as will stay put. But if you don\u0027t like \u0027em, that loses th\u0027 job for you. An\u0027 I reckon yo\u0027re right lucky at that.\" \"Shore; I know th\u0027 kind of a \u0027good\u0027 man they want,\"[9] said Johnny, reminiscently. \"\u0027Good,\u0027 meanin\u0027 habits only. A man that don\u0027t smoke, chew, drink, cuss, get mad, or keep his hat on in th\u0027 house. Losin\u0027 th\u0027 job ain\u0027t bendin\u0027 my shoulders. I ain\u0027t lookin\u0027 for work; I\u0027m dodgin\u0027 it. Goin\u0027 to loaf till my money peters out, which won\u0027t be soon. You\u0027d be surprised if you knowed how many people between here an\u0027 Montanny think they can play poker. Just now I\u0027m a eddicator. I\u0027m peddlin\u0027 knowledge to th\u0027 ignorant, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t no gambler, at that!\" Dave chuckled. \"There\u0027s some around here, too. Now, me; I\u0027m different. I can\u0027t play, an\u0027 I know it; but, of course, I\u0027ll set in, just for th\u0027 excitement of it, once in a while, if there ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 else to do. Come to think of it, I got a deck of cards around here some\u0027rs, right now.\" The rear door opened and closed. Johnny looked up and saw the worst-looking tramp of his experience. The newcomer picked up a sand-box cuspidor and started with it for the street. \"Hi, stranger!\" called Johnny. \"Ain\u0027t that dusty work?\" The tramp stiffened. He hardly could believe his ears. The tones which had assailed them were so spontaneously friendly that for a moment he was stunned. It had been a long time since he had been hailed like that—far too long a time. He turned his head slowly and looked and believed, for the grin which met his eyes was as sincere as the voice. It made him honest in his reply. \"No,\" he said, \"this here\u0027s sand.\" [10] \"But ain\u0027t yore throat dusty?\" Two-Spot put the box down. \"Seems like it allus is. If these boxes get dusty, I\u0027ll know how it come about, me bendin\u0027 over \u0027em like I do, an\u0027 breathin\u0027 on \u0027em.\" Johnny laughed. \"I take it we\u0027re all dusty.\" He turned to Dave. \"Got three left?\" Two-Spot walked up to the bar. Usually he sidled. He picked up his glass and held it up to the light, and drank it in three swallows. Usually it was one gulp. Wiping his lips on a sleeve, he pushed back the glass, dug down into a pocket and brought up a silver dollar, which he tossed onto the bar. \"Fill \u0027em again, Dave,\" he said, quietly. At this Dave\u0027s slowly accumulating wonder leaped. He looked at the coin and from it to Two-Spot. Sensing the situation, Johnny pushed it farther along towards the proprietor. \"Our friend is right, Dave,\" he said, \"two is company. Make mine th\u0027 same.\" Two-Spot put down his empty glass and grinned. \"I\u0027ll now go on from where I was interrupted, Gents,\" and, picking up the box, went towards the door. As he was about to pass through he saw Pepper, and he stopped. \"Good, Lord!\" he muttered. \"What a hoss! I\u0027ve seen passels of hosses, but never one like that. Midnight her name oughter be, or Thunderbolt.\" He turned. \"Stranger, what name do you call that hoss?\" Johnny looked around. \"That\u0027s Pepper.\" Two-Spot grinned. \"Did you see that?\" he demanded, tilting the box until the sand ran out. \"Did you see it? She knows her name like a child. Well,[11] it\u0027s a good name—a fair name,\" he hedged. \"But, shucks! There ain\u0027t no name fit for that hoss! How fur has she come today?\" \"Near forty miles,\" answered Johnny. \"I say it ag\u0027in—there ain\u0027t no name fit for that hoss. She looks like she come five,\" and he passed out. \"Don\u0027t mind him,\" said Dave. \"But where did he git that dollar? Steal it? Find it? Reckon he found it. I near dropped dead. Pore devil—he come here last winter an\u0027 walks in, cleans my boxes an\u0027 sweeps. Then he goes \u0027round to th\u0027 hotel an\u0027 mops an\u0027 cleans th\u0027 pans better than they ever was before. He was so handy an\u0027 useful that we let him stay. An\u0027 I\u0027ve never seen him more than half drunk—it\u0027s amazin\u0027 th\u0027 liquor he can hold.\" \"Sleep here?\" \"No; an\u0027 nobody knows where he does sleep. He\u0027s cunnin\u0027 as a fox, an\u0027 fooled \u0027em every time. But wherever it is, it\u0027s dry.\" Johnny produced a Sharp\u0027s single-shot cartridge. \"Where can I get some of these Specials?\" he asked. Dave looked at it \"\u0027.45-120-550\u0027—you won\u0027t get none of \u0027em down in this country.\" \"Post office in town?\" \"Not yet. Th\u0027 nearest is Rawlins, thirty mile east, with th\u0027 worst trail a man ever rode. Th\u0027 next is Highbank, forty mile south. We use that, for th\u0027 trail\u0027s good. We get mail about twice a month. Th\u0027 Bar H an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle take turns at it.\" \"Then I\u0027ll write for some of these after I feed. I\u0027ll[12] tell \u0027em to send \u0027em to you, at Highbank. What name will I give?\" \"Dave Green, Highbank-Gunsight mail. But you better write before you eat. This is goin\u0027 away day, an\u0027 th\u0027 Bar H will be in any minute now.\" Johnny arose. \"Not before I eat. I ain\u0027t had nothin\u0027 since daybreak, an\u0027 it\u0027s afternoon now. I hate letter writin\u0027; an\u0027 if I don\u0027t eat soon I\u0027ll get thin.\" \"Then don\u0027t eat—\u0027though I wasn\u0027t thinkin\u0027 of you when I spoke,\" growled Dave. \"Wish I was in danger of gettin\u0027 thin.\" \"What you care?\" demanded Johnny. \"Yo\u0027re healthy, an\u0027 yore job don\u0027t call for a man bein\u0027 light.\" \"That\u0027s th\u0027 way you fellers talk,\" said Dave. \"I\u0027m short-winded, I\u0027m in my own way, an\u0027 the joke of th\u0027 country. I can\u0027t ride a hoss—why, cuss it, I can\u0027t even get a gun out quick enough to get a hop-toad before he\u0027s moved twenty feet!\" \"Pullin\u0027 a gun has its advantages, I admits,\" replied Johnny, who had his own ideas about Dave\u0027s ability in that line. Dave, he thought, could get a gun out quick enough for the average need—being a bartender, and still alive, was proof enough of that. He walked toward the door. \"If you was to get a big hoss—a single-footer, you could ride, all right.\" He went around and entered the hotel, mentally numbering it. Arranging for a week\u0027s board and bed for himself and Pepper, he hurried out to the wash bench just outside the dining-room door, where he found two tin basins, a bucket of water, a cake of yellow soap, a towel, and two men using them all. Taking his turn[13] he in turn followed them into the dining-room and chose the fourth and last table, which was next to a window. The meal was better than he had expected but, hungry as he was, he did not eat as hurriedly as was his habit. Fragments of the conversation of the two punchers in the corner reached and interested him. It had to do with the SV ranch, as near as he could judge, and helped him to build the skeleton upon which he hoped to hang a body by dint of investigation and questioning. The episode of that morning had occurred on the SV ranch if the brands on the cattle he had seen meant anything. The woman\u0027s name was Arnold, and she had a father and a brother, the latter a boy. There was a fragment about \"th\u0027 Doc,\" but just what it was he did not hear, except that it was coupled to the Bar H. Also, something was afoot, but it was so cautiously mentioned that he gained no information about it. Finishing before him, the two men went out, and soon rode past the window, mounted on Triangle horses. He rattled his cup and ordered it refilled, and when the waiter slouched back with it, Johnny slid a perfectly good cigar across the table and waved his hand. \"Sit down, an\u0027 smoke. You ought to rest while you got th\u0027 chance.\" The waiter lost some of his slouch and obeyed, nodding his thanks. \"Are you punchin\u0027?\" he asked. \"When I\u0027m broke,\" answered Johnny. \"Just now I\u0027m ridin\u0027 around lookin\u0027 at th\u0027 scenery. Never knowed we had any out here till I heard some Easterners goin\u0027 mad about it. I\u0027ve been tryin\u0027 to find it ever since. But, anyhow, punchin\u0027 is shore monotonous.\" [14] \"If you can show me anythin\u0027 monotoner than this job, I\u0027ll eat it,\" growled the waiter. \"It\u0027s hell on wheels for me.\" \"Oh, this whole range is monotonous,\" grunted Johnny. \"Reckon nothin\u0027 interestin\u0027 has happened down here since Moses got lost. But there\u0027s one thing I like about it—there ain\u0027t no woman in thirty miles.\" \"You foller Clear River into Green Valley, which is SV, an\u0027 you\u0027ll change yore mind,\" chuckled the waiter. \"She\u0027ll chase you off, too.\" \"I\u0027ll be cussed. An\u0027 she\u0027s suspicious of strangers?\" \"Don\u0027t put no limit on it like that; she\u0027s suspicious of everythin\u0027 that wears pants.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"Well, her cows has been wanderin\u0027 off, lookin\u0027 for better grass, I reckon, an\u0027 she thinks they\u0027re bein\u0027 drove.\" Johnny pictured the valley, but hid his smile. \"Oh, well; you can\u0027t blame the cows. They\u0027ll find th\u0027 best. Any ranches \u0027round here run by men?\" \"Shore; three of \u0027em. There\u0027s th\u0027 Bar H, an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle, an\u0027 over west is th\u0027 Double X, but it\u0027s ranchhouse is so fur from here that it\u0027s a sort of outsider. It\u0027s th\u0027 biggest, th\u0027 Bar H is next, an\u0027 then comes th\u0027 Triangle. Th\u0027 Triangle don\u0027t hardly count, neither \u0027though it\u0027s close by.\" \"What about th\u0027 SV you mentioned? An\u0027 what\u0027s yore name?\" \"My name\u0027s George. Th\u0027 SV has gone to th\u0027 dogs since it was sold. It ain\u0027t a ranch no more. Of course, it\u0027s got range, an\u0027 water, an\u0027 some cows, an\u0027 a couple[15] of buildin\u0027s—but it ain\u0027t got no outfit. Old Arnold, his gal, an\u0027 his kid—all tenderfeet—are tryin\u0027 to run it.\" \"But they\u0027ve got to have punchers,\" objected Johnny. \"They can\u0027t keep \u0027em, though I ain\u0027t sayin\u0027 why,\" replied George mysteriously. \"Does th\u0027 Doc own th\u0027 Bar H?\" asked Johnny. \"Lord, no! It owns him—but, say; you\u0027ll have to excuse me. I got work to do. See you at supper. So long.\" Johnny left and rode back the way he had come that morning, lost in meditation. Reaching the rim of the valley he looked down over the rolling expanse of vivid green, here and there broken by shallow draws, with their brush and trees. He noticed an irregular circle of posts just south of him and close to the river. Experience told him what they meant, and he frowned. Here was a discordant note—that enclosure, small as it was, was a thing sinister, malevolent, to him almost possessing a personality. Turning from the quicksands he sat and gazed at the nest of rocks below him until Pepper, well trained though she was, became restless and thought it time to move. Stirring, he smiled and pressed a knee against her and as he rode away he shook his head. \"Yes, girl, I\u0027m still a-rollin\u0027—an\u0027 I don\u0027t know where to.\" After supper he talked with George until they heard the creaking of wheels and harness. Looking up they saw four heavy horses slowly passing the window, followed by a huge, covered wagon with great, heavy wheels having four-inch tires. A grizzled, whiskered,[16] weather-beaten patriarch handled the lines and talked to his horses as though they were children. \"Now I got to make a new fire an\u0027 cook more grub,\" growled George, arising. \"Why can\u0027t he get here in time for supper? He\u0027s allus late, goin\u0027 an\u0027 comin\u0027.\" \"Who is he, an\u0027 where\u0027s he from?\" \"Ol\u0027 Buffaler Wheatley from Highbank. He\u0027s goin\u0027 up to Juniper an\u0027 Sherman.\" \"He come from Highbank today?\" demanded Johnny, surprised. \"Shore—an\u0027 he must \u0027a\u0027 come slow.\" \"Slow? Forty miles with that in a day, an\u0027 he come slow?\" retorted Johnny. \"He was lucky to get here before midnight. If you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 done what that old feller has today, you\u0027d not think much of anybody as wanted you on hand at supper time.\" \"Mebby yo\u0027re right,\" conceded George, dubiously, as he went into the kitchen. Johnny arose and went out to the shed where the driver was flexing his muscles. \"Howd\u0027y,\" he said. \"Got th\u0027 waggin where you want it?\" \"Howd\u0027y, friend,\" replied Buffalo, looking out from under bushy brows. \"I reckon so. \u0027Most any place\u0027ll do. Ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 \u0027round\u0027ll scratch th\u0027 polish off it,\" he grinned. Johnny laughed and began unhitching the tired, patient horses, and his deft fingers had it done before Buffalo had any more than started. \"Fine hosses,\" he complimented, slapping the big gray at his side. \"You must treat \u0027em well.\" \"I do,\" said Buffalo. \"I may abuse myself, some[17]times, but not these here fellers. They\u0027ll pull all day, an\u0027 are as gentle as kittens.\" \"How do you find freightin\u0027?\" asked Johnny, leading his pair into the shed. \"Pickin\u0027 up, an\u0027 pickin\u0027 fast,\" answered Buffalo, following with the second team. \"It\u0027s gettin\u0027 too much for one old man an\u0027 this waggin. An\u0027 top of that I got th\u0027 mail contract I been askin\u0027 for for years. So I got to put on another waggin an\u0027 make th\u0027 trip every week \u0027stead of only when th\u0027 freight piles up enough to make it worth while. Reckon I\u0027ll break my boy in on th\u0027 new waggin.\" \"I\u0027ll leave th\u0027 feedin\u0027 to you,\" said Johnny, leaning against the wall. \"You know what they need.\" \"All right, friend; much obliged to you. I just let \u0027em eat all th\u0027 hay they can hold an\u0027 give \u0027em their measures of oats. I have to carry them with me—can\u0027t get none away from Highbank, everythin\u0027 up here bein\u0027 grass fed.\" \"I feed oats when I can get \u0027em,\" replied Johnny. \"I allus reckon a corn-fed hoss has more bottom.\" \"Shore has—if they\u0027re that kind,\" agreed Buffalo. \"Travel th\u0027 same way all th\u0027 time?\" \"Yes. I won\u0027t gain nothin\u0027 goin\u0027 t\u0027other way \u0027round,\" answered Buffalo, busy with his pets. \"You see I allus come north loaded. Th\u0027 first stop, after here, is Juniper, where I loses part of th\u0027 load. That\u0027s thirty miles from here, an\u0027 th\u0027 road\u0027s good. Then I cross over to Sherman, lose th\u0027 rest of th\u0027 load, an\u0027 come back from there light—it\u0027s fifty mile of hard travelin\u0027. Goin\u0027 like I do I has th\u0027 good, short haul with th\u0027 heavy[18] load; comin\u0027 back I have a light waggin on th\u0027 long, mean haul. If I went to Sherman first, things would just be turned \u0027round.\" \"What do you do when you have passengers for Sherman?\" \"Don\u0027t want none!\" snorted Buffalo. \"Wouldn\u0027t carry \u0027em to Sherman, anyhow. Anybody with sense that can sit a hoss wouldn\u0027t crawl along with me in th\u0027 heat an\u0027 dust on that jouncin\u0027 seat. But sometimes I has a tenderfoot to nurse, consarn \u0027em. They ask so many fool questions I near go loco. But they pays me well for it, you bet!\" \"Anythin\u0027 else I can give you a hand with?\" asked Johnny, following the old man out of the shed. \"No, thankee; I\u0027m all done. Th\u0027 only man that can give me a hand now is that scamp, George. I\u0027m goin\u0027 in to eat, friend. Got to be up an\u0027 be on my way before th\u0027 sun comes up. I get th\u0027 cool of th\u0027 mornin\u0027 for my team, an\u0027 give \u0027em a longer rest when she gets hot. If you see Jim Fanning, tell him I\u0027m buyin\u0027 hides as a side line now. I pays spot cash for \u0027em, same price as Ol\u0027 Saunders would pay, less th\u0027 freight. He has quit th\u0027 business an\u0027 went to live with his married da\u0027ter, ol\u0027 fool!\" \"Fanning sell hides?\" \"No; I just want him to know so he can tell th\u0027 Bar H an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle an\u0027 mebby th\u0027 Double X. I want to have a good load goin\u0027 back from here. There ain\u0027t no profit in goin\u0027 all th\u0027 way back with an empty waggin. Well, good night, friend! I\u0027m much obliged to you.\" \"That\u0027s all right,\" smiled Johnny. \"I\u0027ll tell him.[19] Good night; an\u0027 good luck!\" he added as an after-thought, and then drifted around to the saloon, where he found several men at the bar. Dave performed the introductions, and added: \"Nelson, here, says he ain\u0027t goin\u0027 back punchin\u0027 cows as long as his money lasts. He\u0027s a travelin\u0027 eddicator in th\u0027 innercent game of draw—or was it studhoss, Nelson?\" \"Draw is closer to my heart,\" laughed Johnny. \"My friend, Tex, told me I might learn draw if I lived long enough; but I\u0027d have to have a pack of cards buried with me an\u0027 practice in th\u0027 other world if I aimed to learn studhoss.\" \"It grieves me to see a young man wastin\u0027 his time in idleness,\" said Ben Dailey, the storekeeper. \"Th\u0027 devil is allus lookin\u0027 for holts. Young men should keep workin\u0027. Might I inquire if you feel like indulgin\u0027 in a little game of draw? You\u0027ll find us rusty, though.\" \"We don\u0027t play oftener than every night, an\u0027 some afternoons,\" said Fanning. \"I\u0027m a little scared when a man says he\u0027s rusty,\" replied Johnny. \"But I reckon I might as well lose tonight as later. I hope Dave is too busy to cut in—he said he don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about it.\" \"Dave\u0027s still cuttin\u0027 his teeth,\" chuckled Jim Fanning; \"but he uses my silver to cut \u0027em on. When he learns th\u0027 game I\u0027m goin\u0027 to drift out of town while I still got a cayuse.\" Two punchers came stamping in and Dave nodded to them. \"Here\u0027s yore victims; here\u0027s them infants from th\u0027 Double X. Boys, say \u0027Howd\u0027y\u0027 to Mr. Nelson.[20] Nelson, that tall, red-headed feller is Slim Hawkes; an\u0027 that bowlegged towhead is Tom Wilkes. They ain\u0027t been in here in three months, an\u0027 they\u0027ve rid twenty miles to rob us.\" \"An\u0027 we might walk home,\" retorted Wilkes. \"Let\u0027s lay th\u0027 dust before we starts anythin\u0027. Nelson, yo\u0027re in bad company. This gang would rob a church. You want to get a kneehold an\u0027 hang onto th\u0027 pommel after this game starts. Here\u0027s how!\" As the game progressed the few newcomers who straggled in felt their interest grow. As each finished his drink, Dave would lean forward and whisper: \"There\u0027s what I call a poker game. Four highway-men playin\u0027 \u0027em close. To listen to \u0027em you\u0027d think they never saw a card before.\" Johnny was complaining. \"Gents, I know I\u0027m ignorant—but would you advise me to draw to a pair of treys? Shall I hold up an ace, or take three cards? I\u0027ll chance it; I never hold a sider. Gimme three.\" \"Ain\u0027t that just my luck,\" sighed Ben. \"An\u0027 me with three of a kind.\" A little later Johnny picked up another hand and frowned at it \"Well, seein\u0027 as I allus hold up a sider, I\u0027ll have two, this time.\" Hoofbeats drummed up and stopped, and a voice was heard outside. Dave looked at the calendar. \"Big Tom\u0027s a day ahead—he ain\u0027t due for his spree till pay-day. Hello, Huff! What you doin\u0027 so fur from home?\" \"Hello, Dave! Hello, boys!\" said the newcomer. \"I feel purty good tonight. Just got word that Mc[21]Cullough wants two thousand head from us fellers up here. He\u0027ll be along with his reg\u0027lar trail outfit in a few weeks. Sixteen men, a four-mule chuck waggin, an\u0027 nine saddle hosses to th\u0027 man. I\u0027m sendin\u0027 word that I can give him a thousand head, an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle is goin\u0027 to give him five hundred; so he\u0027ll want five hundred from th\u0027 Double X, which Slim an\u0027 Tom can tell Sherwood.\" \"Shore,\" growled Slim, and his ranch mate nodded. \"Goin\u0027 up to Dodge again?\" queried Dailey. \"He didn\u0027t say,\" answered Big Tom. \"Who\u0027s doin\u0027 the scalpin\u0027?\" he asked, going over to the table, where he gradually grew more restless as he watched. \"Some of these days, when I grows up,\" grinned Wilkes, \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 up th\u0027 trail with a herd, like a reg\u0027lar cow-puncher. Dodge may be top-heavy with marshals, but I\u0027d like to see it again, with money in my pockets.\" Slim grunted. \"Huh!\" He looked over his hand, and drawled: \"Th\u0027 last time you went up you put on too many airs. Just because Cimarron let you play segundo once in a while when he went on ahead to size up th\u0027 water or some river we would have to cross, you got too puffed up. I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to be th\u0027 second boss th\u0027 next trip, an\u0027 I\u0027ll hand you a few jobs that\u0027ll keep you out of mischief.\" Big Tom watched the winner rake in the chips and could stand it no longer. \"Say,\" he growled, \"anybody gettin\u0027 tired, an\u0027 want to drop out?\" Dailey looked up. \"I only won two dollars in two hours, an\u0027 I got some work to do. Everybody bein\u0027 willin\u0027, I\u0027ll go out an\u0027 bury my winnin\u0027s.\" [22] Big Tom took his place. \"I\u0027m shore of one thing: I can\u0027t lose th\u0027 ranch, for I don\u0027t own it.\" A round or two had been played when Big Tom drew his first openers. Johnny raised it and cards were drawn. After it had gone around twice, the others dropped out. Big Tom raised and Johnny helped it along. The betting became stiffer and Big Tom laughed. \"I hope you keep on boostin\u0027 her.\" \"You can\u0027t get me out of this pot with dynamite,\" replied Johnny, pushing out a raise. Big Tom\u0027s gun was out before he left his seat. His chair crashed backward and he leaned over the table. \"Meanin\u0027?\" he snarled. Johnny, surprised, kept his hand on the chips. \"What I said,\" he answered, evenly. \"Tom!\" yelled Dave. \"He don\u0027t mean nothin\u0027! He\u0027s a stranger down here.\" Big Tom\u0027s scowl faded at the words. \"I reckon I was hasty, Nelson,\" he said. Johnny spoke slowly, his voice metallic \"You was so hasty you come near never gettin\u0027 over it. Put down th\u0027 gun.\" \"I\u0027m a mite touchy at——\" \"If you has anythin\u0027 to say, put—down—that—gun.\" \"No offense?\" \"For th\u0027 third time: Put—down—that—gun.\" Big Tom shook his head and appeared to be genuinely sorry. He slid the gun back and picked up his chair. \"You raised?\" \"I did. I advise you to call—and end it.\" [23] \"She\u0027s called. Five little hearts,\" said Big Tom, lying down his cards. \"They\u0027re hasty, too. Queen full, count \u0027em. Let\u0027s liquor.\" The foreman paused in indecision. \"Nelson——\" \"We all get touchy,\" interrupted Johnny, scraping in the winnings. \"Will you drink with me?\" \"I\u0027ll take the same,\" said Big Tom, and he bought the next round, nodded his good night and went out. Johnny turned to Dave. \"Will you oblige me by tellin\u0027 me what Mr. Huff got huffy about?\" Dave hesitated, but Slim Hawkes laughed and answered for him, his slow drawl enhancing the humor of his tale, and wrinkles playing about his eyes and lips told of the enjoyment the picture gave to him. \"Clear River crossed our range, flowed through Little Canyon, made a big bend on th\u0027 Bar H, passed out of East Canyon, an\u0027 flowed down the middle of th\u0027 SV. Three years ago a piece of Little Canyon busted loose an\u0027 slid down, blockin\u0027 th\u0027 river, which backed up, getting\u0027 higher an\u0027 higher, an\u0027 began to cut through its bank about three miles above. Big Tom got busy, pronto. He sends for a box of dynamite, sticks it around in th\u0027 débris an\u0027 let\u0027s her go—all of it. When th\u0027 earthquake stopped there was a second one in th\u0027 dust an\u0027 smoke—we all thought it was a delayed charge. It wasn\u0027t. It was a section of th\u0027 canyon wall, near a hundred feet long an\u0027 almost two hundred feet high. There was a shale fault runnin\u0027 down from th\u0027 top, back about forty feet. Everythin\u0027 in front of that was jarred loose an\u0027 slid. Th\u0027 canyon was choked so hard an\u0027[24] fast that it won\u0027t never get open again. Clear River kept right on a-cuttin\u0027, an\u0027 it now flows on th\u0027 other side of Pine Mountain, which means th\u0027 Bar H ain\u0027t got no water of its own, except a few muddy holes south an\u0027 west of th\u0027 ranch buildings. That\u0027s why he\u0027s touchy. But that\u0027s a long speech, an\u0027 a dry one. Let\u0027s all liquor again.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56723.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
