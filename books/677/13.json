{"id":18891,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII HIGHBANK MAKES A DISCOVERY","content":"At the other end of the Highbank-Gunsight trail the warm afternoon was drawing to a close and the shadows of the buildings were reaching out across the dirt streets when a dust-covered, four-horse freight wagon rolled down the steep bank across the river to an accompaniment of rattling trace chains and grinding brakes, passed the end of the ford, followed the road along the river\u0027s edge and crept out onto the big, flat-bottomed ferry which awaited it. \"On time to a tick,\" smiled the ferryman, poling off and shifting the lengths of the trolley ropes leading to the block which ran on the great, sagging cable overhead The current struck the side of the craft at the changed angle and sent it slowly across. \"I got an extra early start,\" explained Buffalo. \"Got a fine load of hides.\" \"You young fellers are h—l on branchin\u0027 out,\" said the ferryman, grinning. \"Well,\" replied the freighter, \"they was lyin\u0027 there; I only picked \u0027em up.\" \"Here we are; hold tight,\" laughed the boatman. He used his pole deftly and the ferry struck the bank squarely. Making it fast, he lowered the short gang-plank. \"All ashore, an\u0027 good luck!\" The quartet strained and the wagon rumbled up the[165] bank and then up the road in the wide ravine, and in a few minutes struck the level at the top and entered the main street of the town. \"Brazos\" Larkin, town marshal, pushed away from the Highbank bank and rolled out to the wagon, stepped on a hub and then up to the footboard, as was his custom. \"Judgin\u0027 from th\u0027 way those no-\u0027count hosses was pullin\u0027 when they come over th\u0027 hill,\" he said, \"I reckoned you got th\u0027 hides; but now I\u0027m dead shore of it.\" \"Yep,\" chuckled Buffalo, \"they smells good to me.\" \"Dodge th\u0027 Injuns all right?\" asked Brazos, indulging in a time-honored jest. \"Dodged \u0027em ag\u0027in,\" gravely nodded the driver. \"Here comes th\u0027 postmaster. Hello, Jim!\" Jim Hands walked up to the wagon and alongside as it turned the corner and stopped before a frame building bearing in weather-bleached letters across its front: \"Wheatley\u0027s Express.\" As it stopped, a tall, lean young man came out and smiled. \"Everythin\u0027 all right, Pop?\" he asked. \"Right as a dollar. Can\u0027t you smell \u0027em?\" chuckled the old man. \"Jerry,\" said Brazos, \"I hears yo\u0027re quittin\u0027 th\u0027 office for a wagon next week?\" \"I am; I wanted to swap jobs right along with Pop. Now that we\u0027re goin\u0027 to run two waggins I\u0027ll get a chance to bust out of this jail; an\u0027 Pop can still see his friends along th\u0027 trail, too. I start in a day or two.\" A small group came up and joined them. In it was Rod Wilson, the liveryman; Reb Travers, the railroad[166] freight agent; and Pete Wiggins, the owner of the hotel. They all were cronies of the same vintage as the driver and formed a closed circle into which, however, they had admitted Brazos. \"Bet you didn\u0027t git a load,\" said Rod. \"Bet you didn\u0027t git half a load,\" amended Reb. \"I\u0027ll show you scoffin\u0027 mossbacks what I got,\" retorted Buffalo, rising to the bait. He clambered down and went to the rear of the wagon, untied the knots and threw back the canvas. As he paused to wonder how the bale had become spread out, the top skin moved up and down, and he jerked back his hand. \"There\u0027s some kind of a varmint in there!\" he cried in pardonable amazement. Brazos left the group with a leap and reached for the hide as his gun slanted down on it. Giving it a quick, hard jerk, he threw it behind him and then gazed in astonishment at a pair of boots which moved energetically, while strange, strangled gurgles were heard in the wagon box. \"I\u0027m d—d!\" he muttered. \"What th\u0027—who th\u0027—how th\u0027—\" He grabbed hold of a boot and pulled heartily. It resisted and tried to kick. Following his gun under the canvas, he moved another skin and then emerged and stared at Buffalo. \"What is it?\" demanded the freighter. \"Who is it? How\u0027d he git there, hey?\" \"It\u0027s Wolf Forbes, blindfolded, gagged, hog-tied, an\u0027 lashed to th\u0027 box,\" accused Brazos. \"Was you aimin\u0027 to skin him when you had more time?\" \"Skin him?\" indignantly retorted Buffalo. \"You can\u0027t skin him; he\u0027s so tough a plough wouldn\u0027t scratch[167] his hide. How\u0027d he git in there, an\u0027 tie hisself up like that?\" \"Mebby you can tell that to a jury,\" retorted Brazos, slying winking at the dumfounded group. \"However, unless we want to call on a coroner\u0027s jury first, we better git him out,\" and, slipping the gun into its holster, he plunged back under the canvas. Pete Wiggins was the first of the group to recover. \"After all these years we done found you out!\" he exulted. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" demanded Jerry, from the office. \"Yore Pop is bringin\u0027 in hide on th\u0027 hoof,\" declared Reb. \"Kidnappin\u0027 innercent punchers like Wolf Forbes,\" accused Pete. \"Cuss it!\" snorted Buffalo. \"What I want you fools to tell me is how he got there?\" \"You can\u0027t slip out that way,\" asserted Rod. They listened to what Brazos was saying under the canvas. \"Tied up four ways from th\u0027 Jack,\" he announced. \"Rolled up in a stinkin\u0027 hide, he was, all but his head an\u0027 arms. Cuss me! this is somethin\u0027 new to me; an\u0027 I reckoned I\u0027d been up ag\u0027in\u0027 everythin\u0027 in human cussedness. How fur did he come this way?\" \"How in h—l do I know!\" blazed Buffalo, his thin chin whiskers bobbing pugnaciously. \"I didn\u0027t even know he was there!\" \"You can\u0027t never tell,\" said a voice back in the crowd. \"Sometimes it comes out in a man when he\u0027s even older\u0027n Buffalo. Reckon it\u0027s th\u0027 breed.\" \"I\u0027ll show you what\u0027s in my breed!\" shouted the[168] freighter, pushing into the press. \"Let me git a-holt of th\u0027 skunk as said that an\u0027—an\u0027—an\u0027—\" he faltered. Pete grabbed him and pulled him back again. \"None of that!\" he warned. \"You stay right here till we find out more about this!\" \"Startin\u0027 a passenger business, too, I reckon,\" said the same voice. \"Bein\u0027 an old hand on th\u0027 cattle trail he knowed a herd will often foller if one cow crosses a river.\" \"He got so used to skinnin\u0027 buffalers that he\u0027s itchin\u0027 to try it on a human,\" said another. \"I says he shows spunk, pickin\u0027 Wolf to try it on.\" \"There\u0027s tricks in all trades,\" said Jim Hands. \"\u0027Cept freightin\u0027,\" laughed Jerry. \"Somebody pass in a knife,\" requested Brazos. \"Mine\u0027s in my other pants where it allus is when I wants it. My sacred cow! I\u0027m near choked! Them hides must be full of maggots.\" Receiving the knife he soon backed out. \"Phew! An\u0027 hot! Now, as I pull him out, some of you grab holt under him so he won\u0027t drop. Don\u0027t try to stand him up; he can\u0027t do that for all th\u0027 money in th\u0027 country. Here he comes; stand by!\" Ready hands went under the puncher as he appeared, and lowered him to the ground. Wolf could not speak; he could not even move his jaw; but there was nothing the matter with his eyes and they served as points of concentration for his rage. They almost sparked. \"Jerry, get a bottle of liquor,\" ordered Brazos. \"Get it sudden, too. Reb, you an\u0027 some of th\u0027 others[169] rub his arms an\u0027 laigs. He ain\u0027t nowhere near goin\u0027 to die, but he\u0027s in bad shape, temporary.\" Jerry appeared with a bottle of brandy and Brazos poured a thin trickle of it into the open mouth. When a fourth of it was used he started to rub the jaw muscles, whereat the eyes sparked furiously and the gurgling became more emphatic. \"He says he likes that,\" chuckled the marshal, \"but he likes this better,\" and he gave another dose of brandy. \"You can\u0027t kill these fellers,\" he remarked, rubbing the jaws with rhythmic strokes. \"They\u0027re steel, rubber, an\u0027 rawhide—tough as hickory knots. In administerin\u0027 a stimulant\"—he paused, liked the words, and repeated them: \"In administerin\u0027 a stimulant, as I says before, you got to consider what effect it will have on a liquor-drinkin\u0027 patient. This here feller looks like he was used to it, so we\u0027ll give him all six chambers. There ain\u0027t no harm in gettin\u0027 a man drunk, not if it\u0027s good for him, an\u0027 if I was him I\u0027d ruther be drunk than sober when th\u0027 blood starts a-flowin\u0027 ag\u0027in. Dose Number Three—it\u0027s fetchin\u0027 him; an\u0027 he ain\u0027t coughed once. Didn\u0027t I tell you he was brought up on it?\" Buffalo, holding back his laughter with all his will, shook his fist at the prostrate puncher. \"Think yo\u0027re smart, hey?\" he demanded fiercely. \"But I want my pay! Nobody can steal a ride with me without payin\u0027. I want five dollars. You hear me? Five dollars! These fools act like they think it\u0027s a joke, but I ain\u0027t swallerin\u0027 it; no, sir! How do I know you didn\u0027t plan this all out, an\u0027 get yore friends to help you beat an old man out of his fare? There you was,[170] snug in my skins, like a tick in a cow\u0027s hair, layin\u0027 there for forty miles, snickerin\u0027 at me! You wouldn\u0027t pay, an\u0027 ride alongside me, up in th\u0027 dust an\u0027 th\u0027 heat; but you got poked away on them soft hides, out of th\u0027 dust an\u0027 th\u0027 sun, takin\u0027 it easy while I was drivin\u0027 them four wild hosses for forty miles! Dozin\u0027 off, mebby, while I was doin\u0027 all th\u0027 work. I don\u0027t see no joke.\" He choked, controlled himself, and shouted: \"But you can\u0027t do it! I want my pay! An\u0027 what will folks say up in Gunsight when they hears about you?\" \"Oh, Lord!\" yelled Pete. \"What will they say? It\u0027ll never be forgot!\" \"Life must be pleasant,\" said Reb, \"livin\u0027 with that outfit! There\u0027s allus somethin\u0027 to pass away th\u0027 time. I reckon they must \u0027a\u0027 saved up a long time for this feller.\" \"Can you imagine what he\u0027s been through today?\" asked Pete, his imagination becoming active. \"It was plain, common h—l!\" Buffalo suddenly let out a whoop, draped himself on a wheel and burst into laughter, and when he could get control of himself he looked around at his audience. \"Fellers,\" he groaned, \"it wasn\u0027t his outfit! It was them Double X fellers. There was four of \u0027em in Gunsight last night, an\u0027 they was feelin\u0027 good. They\u0027ve got th\u0027 nerve to tackle a joke like this, too; an\u0027 there ain\u0027t no love lost between them two ranches. When I was goin\u0027 into th\u0027 hotel after puttin\u0027 up my team, I heard a lot of laughin\u0027 in Dave\u0027s saloon, an\u0027 I remembers some of them Double X fellers howlin\u0027 \u0027bout a kidnapin\u0027. That\u0027s it! They done it! An\u0027 I tell you it[171] took nerve, tacklin\u0027 this two-gun man for a joke! It won\u0027t be no joke when he gits back—there\u0027ll be killin\u0027s over this. But, killin\u0027 or no killin\u0027, I can\u0027t help it—Oh! Ho! Ho! Oh! Ho! Ho! An\u0027 me settin\u0027 up there, drivin\u0027 like a dodderin\u0027 old fool, with this feller tied up in them odorous skins! Wolf Forbes, two-gun badman of th\u0027 Bar H! Oh! Ho! Ho! There\u0027ll be killin\u0027s; but I got to laugh—Oh, Lordy! Lordy! Lordy!\" \"Forty mile! Forty mile!\" senselessly repeated one man, weaving around, stepping on everyone in his path. \"Forty mile! Forty mile!\" \"Playin\u0027 mummy on a pile of stinkin\u0027 hides!\" cried another. \"Tied up like a—like a—I dunno what!\" \"Bouncin\u0027 an\u0027 jouncin\u0027 under that tarp on a day like this!\" \"Forty mile\" came around again, chanting his passwords, stumbled over Reb and flopped, still chanting. Brazos held up the bottle, and put it down again, not daring to give the last dose for fear of spilling it, and rocked back and forth on his haunches: \"Wrapped in a stinkin\u0027 hide—forty mile—mummy—oh, my sacred cow!\" \"Forty mile\" gasped and sat up. The bottle took his eye, and his hand took the bottle. Putting it back empty he slowly arose; and when last seen he was trying to walk on both sides of the street at once, still chanting his lay. Wolf stirred, tried to get up and, falling, rolled over. \"\u0027Oot \u0027ell out ah th\u0027,\" he muttered. \"No dah \u0027an.\" He desisted, since he could not pronounce labials, and[172] tried his arms and legs. They responded somewhat but there was great uncertainty about them. Brazos wiped his eyes, picked up the bottle, looked at it and then around at the crowd, and arose. \"Come on, boys; give me a hand. In another hour he\u0027ll be petrified. After which, I\u0027m takin\u0027 a drink—two of \u0027em—three of \u0027em! I needs it bad.\" The cronies picked Buffalo off the wheel. \"Give us a hand, ol\u0027 kidnapper,\" ordered Reb. \"We\u0027ll lug him into Pete\u0027s. Come on—git a-holt, all as can find room.\" A procession formed, with a line of dogs acting as skirmishers, and tramped to Pete Wiggins\u0027 Highbank hotel and bar, into which all but the small boys and dogs disappeared. And a stranger entering Highbank later that night would have carried away a very unfavorable impression about the sobriety of its citizens. And had he seen the innocent and unassuming cause of it all he would have marveled how a man could get so drunk, and live. And for a day or two Wolf did not draw a sober breath, but staggered, when he was able to walk, from place to place, muttering dire threats and drinking steadily while his money lasted. There is no telling where a periodical drinker will stop when once he gets started—and he had been started on more than a pint of brandy.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56734.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
