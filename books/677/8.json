{"id":18886,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII A MAN\u0027S A MAN","content":"Having eaten enough to arouse the unqualified admiration of George, Johnny went to the kitchen and became busy with patch paper, tallow, and loading cup, and had just finished the twenty-fifth, and last, cartridge, when Two-Spot wandered in. George was out attacking the wood pile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Got \u0027em done, huh? Ain\u0027t it better to buy \u0027em?\" asked Two-Spot, looking into the dining-room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is, Ol\u0027 Timer, when you can. Just now I can\u0027t get \u0027em, so I got to make \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His companion looked at the belt full of .45\u0027s. \"Gimme a couple of them? I want to try somethin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny complied. \"Want to see if they fits?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Carson dropped his gun under Dave\u0027s floor. Who got th\u0027 one in th\u0027 road?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t say nothin\u0027,\" begged Two-Spot. \"Dave\u0027s an old woman, an\u0027 I don\u0027t want nobody to know I got it. He got th\u0027 other.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you goin\u0027 to do with yourn?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep it in my bunk. I might need it, sometime. I ought to have a rifle, though.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get you one,\" promised Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you goin\u0027 to do this afternoon?\" asked Two-Spot,[86] his face beaming at the thought of owning a rifle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s time you knowed about things out here. You ride up th\u0027 Juniper trail to th\u0027 second draw, in about an hour, an\u0027 I\u0027ll fix yore case rack so you\u0027ll know what cards are out. Yo\u0027re guessin\u0027 good, but Faro ain\u0027t th\u0027 only game where keepin\u0027 cases is better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why go up there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, purty soon it ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to be healthy for anybody to be too friendly with you,\" said Two-Spot, reflectively. \"Anyhow, I\u0027ll be worth more if I ain\u0027t suspected of bein\u0027 too talkative.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Th\u0027 best way to get suspected is to hide out when you don\u0027t have to,\" said Johnny. \"You wander over to that grass spot across th\u0027 road from Dave\u0027s an\u0027 Dailey\u0027s in about an hour, an\u0027 lay down to rest yore lazy bones, with yore head toward th\u0027 saloon, so nobody can see that yo\u0027re talkin\u0027 steady. I\u0027ll try to get there first. It\u0027ll be innocent as sheep. Pepper hankers for live grass—an\u0027 she deserves what she hankers for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She does,\" responded Two-Spot. \"Big Tom was in yesterday talkin\u0027 to Dailey. I heard him say somethin\u0027 about no supplies. They had an argument an\u0027 finally Dailey says: \u0027All right; if you say so.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny nodded. \"I\u0027ll see you around front in about an hour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n About the time agreed upon Two-Spot stopped sweeping and looked out of the door. \"Things look plumb peaceful, Dave,\" he said. \"There\u0027s Nelson lyin\u0027 on his back over there in th\u0027 sun. He\u0027s too comfortable. Got a notion to stir him up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [87] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You stir up that broom an\u0027 get through,\" replied Dave. \"You\u0027re sweepin\u0027 later an\u0027 later every mornin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sweeper sighed and went to work again, with a vigor so carefully figured that Dave was on the verge of speaking about dust several times, but thought better of it each time. Finishing his chores, Two-Spot shuffled out and threw a can at the recumbent figure over on the grass. It stirred and raised its head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll turn you inside out,\" it threatened. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You couldn\u0027t turn a glove inside out,\" retorted Two-Spot. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny grunted. He was silent for a moment, and then inquired, \"What you doin\u0027, Feather Head?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Workin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you can\u0027t do it,\" regretted Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bring over a couple of cigars.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Show me yore money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny rolled over on his side and produced a coin, which he held up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Chuck it over,\" said Two-Spot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re too busy,\" jeered Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Chuck it, an\u0027 see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny sat up and sent the coin glittering through the air, Two-Spot making an unexpected catch. He went into the saloon, soon reappeared, and shuffled across the road. Sitting down at Johnny\u0027s side with his back to the buildings, he lit his cigar and lazily reclined. \"I shore appreciates this rest,\" he sighed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny laughed outright. \"Yo\u0027re worked to death,\" he jibed. \\n\\n \\n\\n [88] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ol\u0027 Simon Verrier,\" began Two-Spot, \"was th\u0027 first owner of th\u0027 SV. He run it for twenty years, an\u0027 there wasn\u0027t nobody in all that time done any devilment an\u0027 wanted to repeat it. He was testy, big, an\u0027 powerful, an\u0027 he reckoned th\u0027 gun he packed was made to be used. He had Buck Sneed for his best man, an\u0027 an outfit what believed th\u0027 same as he did about guns. At that time there wasn\u0027t no boundaries, not fixed. Th\u0027 ranches sort of mingled along th\u0027 edges. Then th\u0027 Bar H got notions. It sort of honed for that valley, an\u0027 made a play or two for it. There wasn\u0027t no third. Ol\u0027 Simon an\u0027 Buck rid down to th\u0027 Bar H house an\u0027 spoke plain. Failin\u0027 to have any lines didn\u0027t bother them two. They picked th\u0027 ridges of th\u0027 dividin\u0027 hills an\u0027 says: \u0027Them\u0027s th\u0027 lines; stay on yore own side.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny laughed for the benefit of any of the curious on the other side of the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ol\u0027 Frank Harper owned th\u0027 Bar H in them days. Poker an\u0027 drink was his failin\u0027s. His poker took Dailey out of th\u0027 saddle an\u0027 put him into th\u0027 store, an\u0027 it did th\u0027 same for Dave. It also put a mortgage on th\u0027 Bar H. More\u0027n that, it kept him drinkin\u0027 harder an\u0027 harder—an\u0027 he was found dead one day in East Canyon; he had fell off his cayuse an\u0027 busted his neck. Th\u0027 mortgage was foreclosed an\u0027 th\u0027 present owners of th\u0027 ranch bought it in an\u0027 hired Big Tom to run it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Th\u0027 first thing Big Tom did was to forget all about them boundary lines. Ol\u0027 Simon an\u0027 him had words, an\u0027 when th\u0027 smoke cleared Big Tom had four slugs out of five into him; but he\u0027s got th\u0027 strength of a grizzly an\u0027 pulled through. About th\u0027 time he was[89] ridin\u0027 around ag\u0027in, on his own side of th\u0027 lines, Simon got his feet wet an\u0027 died in four days. I says that is downright funny. He had weathered stampedes, gunplay, northers, an\u0027 th\u0027 Lord only knows what for sixty years, an\u0027 then he goes an\u0027 dies from wet feet!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny nodded and pushed Pepper\u0027s muzzle from his face, \"Keep a-feedin\u0027, girl,\" he ordered; \"I won\u0027t sneak away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" continued Two-Spot, \"Buck buried th\u0027 ol\u0027 man, an\u0027 went right on runnin\u0027 things for th\u0027 heirs. He kept th\u0027 outfit together, an\u0027 th\u0027 ranch was payin\u0027 fine. Then th\u0027 heirs, eastern mutton-heads, didn\u0027t like his spellin\u0027, an\u0027 his habit of writin\u0027 letters when he was mad. They fired him, an\u0027 th\u0027 oufit, feelin\u0027 insulted personally, quit th\u0027 ranch an\u0027 went with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve knowed outfits just like that,\" murmured Johnny, reflectively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Th\u0027 new foreman came, an\u0027 went. Likewise th\u0027 second. They had a mark to live up to—it lays along th\u0027 top of them hills—an\u0027 they wasn\u0027t big enough to do it. Meanwhile th\u0027 SV was goin\u0027 to th\u0027 dogs. Then Ol\u0027 Arnold bought it an\u0027 came out to run it. He was a tenderfoot, an\u0027 came out for his health. Things was happenin\u0027 all th\u0027 time. His herds was shrinkin\u0027. Rustlin\u0027, shootin\u0027, maverick huntin\u0027, an\u0027 them quicksands kept a-cuttin\u0027 his herds. Just about that time Big Tom dynamites th\u0027 rock slide in Little Canyon, an\u0027 forthwith loses his water. Then things happen faster than ever. He makes a play toward th\u0027 Double X; but th\u0027 Double X talks plain an\u0027 he reckons he better get th\u0027 SV.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny sat up and stretched. \"Let\u0027s play mumble-peg,\"[90] he suggested, producing a clasp knife. \"This steady talkin\u0027 is lastin\u0027 a long time, though I don\u0027t believe they hear you. I better cut in an\u0027 ask fool questions for th\u0027 looks of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027ll come easy to you,\" retorted Two-Spot. \"Well, things was goin\u0027 from bad to worse on th\u0027 SV. They couldn\u0027t keep an outfit. Them that wasn\u0027t scared away was bribed to quit. Dahlgren, Lang, an\u0027 Gurley all was SV men. Ol\u0027 Arnold borrowed three thousand dollars on his note in Highbank two years ago. Big Tom bought it an\u0027 holds it now. I think it\u0027s due next spring. Arnold has had to sell cows in small bunches to buy grub. There ain\u0027t no nat\u0027ral increase, an\u0027 th\u0027 Bar H has a lot more calves an\u0027 yearlin\u0027s than Nature gave it. For th\u0027 last year th\u0027 SV ain\u0027t been bothered very much. It\u0027s so close to dyin\u0027 that I reckon Big Tom would rather wait a little longer an\u0027 have somethin\u0027 left to take when he does get it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pleasant sort of a buzzard, Big Tom,\" said Johnny. \"You missed then—gimme th\u0027 knife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Once in a while Lang or Gurley drive a cow into th\u0027 quicksands, just to keep their hands in. They work for th\u0027 Triangle, but really for Big Tom. They\u0027re handy for him, seein\u0027 that they has th\u0027 Triangle range next to th\u0027 SV.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Them names are easy to remember,\" observed Johnny, surrendering the knife. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Big Tom wants th\u0027 SV for its water,\" said Two-Spot. \"That\u0027s what most folks think. I think him an\u0027 some friends he\u0027s got somewhere aim to get it cheap an\u0027 run it themselves.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [91] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s th\u0027 Doc doin\u0027 squattin\u0027 where he is?\" queried Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There was some talk about th\u0027 SV\u0027s title to that end of it lyin\u0027 west of th\u0027 main trail, an\u0027 I reckon he\u0027s there to file a homestead claim if it\u0027s needed; but I really don\u0027t know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 these other ranches are settin\u0027 back an\u0027 watchin\u0027 a sick man, a woman, an\u0027 a kid get robbed?\" asked Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Th\u0027 Triangle is scared of th\u0027 Bar H,\" answered Two-Spot. \"It had its lesson ten years ago, an\u0027 ain\u0027t forgot it. Hank Lewis ain\u0027t got no nerve—it\u0027s only gall. Sam Gardner is sore about th\u0027 game, but he\u0027s all alone. Lefferts an\u0027 Reilly don\u0027t care much, an\u0027 Lang an\u0027 Gurley are in Big Tom\u0027s pay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What about th\u0027 Double X?\" demanded Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are so far off they don\u0027t take no interest. They keeps over there purty much an\u0027 don\u0027t meddle, an\u0027, besides, they has troubles of their own, with th\u0027 rustlin\u0027 goin\u0027 on along their west edge.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you know all this?\" said Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I worked for Ol\u0027 Simon fifteen years ago. I drifted back last winter, an\u0027 I\u0027ve been here ever since. Nobody knows me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why are you tellin\u0027 me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hears a lot under th\u0027 floor, before you come, an\u0027 after,\" said Two-Spot. \"My ears are good, an\u0027 I got some brains left—not much, but enough to put two an\u0027 two together. Likewise I\u0027m feelin\u0027 sorry for them Arnolds. I don\u0027t like to see a gang of thieves robbin\u0027 helpless critters like them. An\u0027 there\u0027s more. When[92] I was comin\u0027 down here I got ketched in a storm an\u0027 like to froze to death. I would have, too, if that Arnold gal hadn\u0027t rid across me, pulled me out of a snowbank, an\u0027 toted me to th\u0027 ranch. They took care of me till I was strong ag\u0027in, an\u0027 fed me up. I was near starved when th\u0027 storm got me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But why are you tellin\u0027 all this to me?\" demanded Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two-Spot stretched and handed over the knife. \"I\u0027m an ol\u0027 man, now,\" he said, \"but there was a time when I wasn\u0027t. You are a young man, an\u0027 square, fur\u0027s I know. You been hangin\u0027 \u0027round here playin\u0027 a lone hand against a bunch that\u0027d cut your throat if they knowed what you\u0027ve been doin\u0027. There\u0027s a purty gal over on th\u0027 SV. She\u0027s square, too, an\u0027 helpless, an\u0027 lonely. She don\u0027t know what to do, nor where to turn. She layed in a nest of rocks one day an\u0027 was watchin\u0027 three Bar H punchers. A rattler showed up close to her, in a dead line with th\u0027 men. Scared to death of snakes, she was drawin\u0027 a bead on it, when a stranger offers her his cannon, an\u0027 his help. Then he gives her h—l about murder, an\u0027 goes away. But he don\u0027t go fur, only to Gunsight. He drives Squint out of th\u0027 country, kidnaps th\u0027 Doc, an\u0027 keeps a bunch of hoss thieves from killin\u0027 her ol\u0027 man. I never saw you before; I don\u0027t know how many cattle you\u0027ve rustled nor how many trains you\u0027ve stuck up. What\u0027s more, I don\u0027t care. I know a white man when I sees one, an\u0027 I\u0027m not gamblin\u0027 when I shoots off my mouth to you. I\u0027m only a two-spot; but even two-spots has their good points. You can allus remember that there\u0027s a two-spot[93] holdin\u0027 a six-gun under that there floor any time you need him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny sat up: \"I\u0027m sayin\u0027 you ain\u0027t no two-spot, neither.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Before I forget it, I want to tell you th\u0027 rest of it,\" went on Two-Spot, anger heightening his color. \"As I was sayin\u0027, th\u0027 gal\u0027s white, an\u0027 square. She\u0027s plumb different from some I\u0027ve seen in th\u0027 cow-towns. Big Tom wants th\u0027 SV, but he wants her, too; an\u0027 \u0027though he ain\u0027t pesterin\u0027 her now, I know him too well to think he\u0027s give up th\u0027 idea. He never lets loose. Th\u0027 only reason he\u0027s let up is because he figgers he\u0027s got a better way; an\u0027 he\u0027s patient. Can you imagine a whiskey-smellin\u0027, big brute like him courtin\u0027 her? Can you imagine how he\u0027d do it? An\u0027 lemme tell you, Nelson: I am a two-spot, for if I\u0027d been any good at all I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 put a knife into him an\u0027 then took my medicine, like a man. I was near sick with disappointment when you shot th\u0027 gun out of his hand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you know anythin\u0027 about that nest of rocks, an\u0027 th\u0027 three men?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know lots of things I ain\u0027t supposed to, an\u0027 one of \u0027em is that Big Tom ain\u0027t give up th\u0027 notion of gettin\u0027 th\u0027 SV, nor her, neither. There ain\u0027t no parson in thirty miles—an\u0027 Big Tom is terrible lazy. Sometimes I near sees red!\" He glanced up the trail. \"Here comes little Charley, leadin\u0027 a pack hoss. He\u0027s after supplies at Dailey\u0027s—\" he stopped short and looked at Johnny, who was looking at him through narrowed lids. The same thought had come to them both at the same time. \"I\u0027m bettin\u0027 he don\u0027t get \u0027em,\" Two-Spot prophesied. \\n\\n \\n\\n [94] \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny arose and stretched. \"I\u0027m bettin\u0027 he does,\" he drawled. \"Reckon I\u0027ll go over an\u0027 swap gossip with Dailey,\" he explained, striding away. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two-Spot watched him and also arose, going across the road and around the saloon. \"I called it wrong,\" he muttered. \"I\u0027ll copper that bet: I bets he does.\" A grin stole across his face as he shuffled toward Dailey\u0027s back door. \"This\u0027ll be worth hearin\u0027, an\u0027 mebby I can get me a box of .45\u0027s; Ol\u0027 Eagle-Eye may be too cussed busy to pay any attention to me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny sauntered into the store and seated himself on a box. \"Howd\u0027y, Ben.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dailey smiled a welcome. \"Been sunnin\u0027 yoreself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny yawned. \"Yeah; I\u0027m shore lazy.\" He glanced out of the door at the boy who had ridden up and dismounted. \"Reckon this is that Arnold kid,\" he observed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dailey hid a frown, and nodded. \"I\u0027m awful short of supplies today,\" he said. \"Ol\u0027 Buffalo didn\u0027t bring me any—now I got to wait till he comes again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charley entered and handed a paper to the storekeeper, who took it, studied it, and then shook his head. \"Bud, if you\u0027d hunted through th\u0027 store you couldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 picked \u0027em any worse. I ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 this calls for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charley\u0027s face fell. \"Gee!\" he said, \"Peggy\u0027s out of almost everything. She said she just had to get these today.\" He looked around inquiringly. \"Ain\u0027t that flour?\" he asked, pointing to several filled sacks behind the counter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Them\u0027s flour sacks,\" answered Dailey, \"but there[95] ain\u0027t no flour in \u0027em now.\" He handed the list back to the boy. \"No use, bud, you\u0027ll have to wait till Buffalo comes up again. He\u0027s too old to be of any account, anyhow, th\u0027 ol\u0027 fossil: he\u0027s allus forgettin\u0027 somethin\u0027, allus!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny held out his hand, his right hand. \"Let\u0027s see it, Charley,\" he said, and looked it over. \"I\u0027ll be cussed if that ain\u0027t funny!\" he exclaimed. \"This here is th\u0027 very same as I was goin\u0027 to get filled for myself, only mine wasn\u0027t all writ down like this. How\u0027d you come to pick these things out, Charley?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quit yore fooling,\" grinned Charley. \"I didn\u0027t pick them. Peggy wrote that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny reached out and put the list in Dailey\u0027s hand. \"Better begin at th\u0027 top, Ben, an\u0027 run right down,\" he suggested. \"We won\u0027t get \u0027em mixed that way, or leave nothin\u0027 out. Let\u0027s start with one of them flour sacks, no matter what\u0027s in \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dailey flushed. \"But I just said I was all out——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re th\u0027 most forgetful man I ever knowed, except, mebby, Buffalo,\" said Johnny. \"You ain\u0027t got no mem\u0027ry at all. Don\u0027t you remember you found a lot of things you\u0027d poked away an\u0027 forgot you had? An\u0027 don\u0027t you remember that nobody ain\u0027t told you, yet, not to sell me nothin\u0027? That there paper is mine, now. I\u0027m borrowin\u0027 it because I ain\u0027t got my own list writ out. That\u0027s writ so pretty an\u0027 plain, that it\u0027s pretty plain to read. If anybody gets curious, which they won\u0027t unless you tell \u0027em, you say that I gave you that an\u0027 wanted it filled. Now, we\u0027ll start with th\u0027 flour, like I was sayin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [96] \\n\\n \\n\\n Dailey looked down the list and then up at Johnny. He was asking Fate why Nelson had to pick that particular time to visit the store. Johnny was smiling, but there was a look in his eyes which made the storekeeper do some quick thinking. He had no orders not to sell to anyone but the SV; and if Big Tom became curious he could put his questions to the two-gun man and get what satisfaction he could. In his heart he was in sympathy with the SV, and he had argued against refusing to sell to it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nelson,\" said Dailey, slowly going behind the counter, \"It\u0027s a good thing you remembered about that stuff. Are you takin\u0027 it to th\u0027 hotel?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Reckon not,\" answered Johnny. \"Reckon I\u0027ll borrow Charley\u0027s pack hoss an\u0027 him to take it off to a place I knows of, where there ain\u0027t no mice. You\u0027d be surprised, Ben, if you knowed how many mice there are in that hotel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charley looked from one to the other and, not knowing what to think or say, grinned somewhat anxiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027s yore dad, an\u0027 yore sister?\" Johnny asked him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" answered Charley. \"But they was scared half to death yesterday when you an\u0027 them fellers came tearin\u0027 in, \u0027specially when you started shooting. You was awful drunk, wasn\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember much about it,\" confessed Johnny, \"so I reckon mebby I was. We all got lost an\u0027 had to sleep out in th\u0027 brush all night. We was after th\u0027 coyote what kidnapped th\u0027 Doc, but we couldn\u0027t find him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dailey forgot to continue filling the list. He was[97] holding a sack of sugar in his hand and drinking in every word. Johnny turned to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, Ben,\" he said, \"did I ever tell you th\u0027 story about Damsight?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You never did,\" answered the storekeeper, \"not if my mem\u0027ry ain\u0027t playin\u0027 me false again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was scandalous,\" began Johnny, drumming with fingers on the butt of a gun. \"There was a bunch of hoss thieves fightin\u0027 a lone woman an\u0027 her crippled dad. An\u0027 what do you reckon th\u0027 men in Damsight did about it? Nothin\u0027. Nothin\u0027 at all. They was so miserable, so coyote-livered, so scared to death that they didn\u0027t raise a finger. No, sir; there wasn\u0027t a man in th\u0027 town. They were just yellow dogs, runnin\u0027 around in men\u0027s clothes an\u0027 pertendin\u0027 they was humans—a lot of yellow dogs, an\u0027 not a cussed thing more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dailey bungled a knot, and swore under his breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Things went on like that for quite a spell,\" continued Johnny, \"then a big storm come up, an\u0027 one by one them fellers who didn\u0027t see th\u0027 error of their ways was struck by lightnin\u0027. They never knowed what hit \u0027em. It was just like th\u0027 miracles I\u0027ve heard sky pilots tell about. Some of \u0027em did see th\u0027 error of their ways in time. They had a hard time in th\u0027 storm, but they pulled out alive. There seems to be a moral to that story; there ain\u0027t no use tellin\u0027 a story like that if th\u0027 moral is left out. An\u0027 I reckon th\u0027 moral of this one is: A man might be able to dodge lots of trouble, \u0027specially when it ain\u0027t near him all th\u0027 time; but when he\u0027s livin\u0027 right next door to th\u0027 lightnin\u0027, he can\u0027t dodge that. What do you think about it, Charley?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [98] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gee! That\u0027s like the things Peggy reads to me out of the Bible,\" he replied. \"Only it wasn\u0027t lightning, but floods, and pestilences, and things like that. Why, once a whole ocean opened up right in the middle and let a lot of people walk across it, but when their enemies got halfway over, it closed up, smack! and they were all drowned.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny nodded gravely. \"There\u0027s strange things happenin\u0027, even today, Charley, an\u0027 nobody knows when or where they will happen. Now, leavin\u0027 miracles out of it, let\u0027s put those packages on that hoss out there, an\u0027 see if Ben has forgot how to throw a diamond hitch. I\u0027m bettin\u0027 a dollar he has.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take that dollar, parson,\" grinned Dailey. \"Gimme a hand with th\u0027 stuff.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They filed out to the horse, loaded with packages, as Two-Spot slipped in the back door, and Dailey won the dollar. Watching the boy ride away, he turned and started for the store. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, over his shoulder, \"I\u0027ve put up my lightnin\u0027 rods, an\u0027 now I\u0027m goin\u0027 to spit on my hands an\u0027 hold fast, for if this storm busts she\u0027ll be a whizzer. I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to tell people right to their faces that Dailey\u0027s store sells to anybody that\u0027s got th\u0027 cash. You better look to yore tent pegs, young man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56729.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
