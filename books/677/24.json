{"id":18902,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV ON THE TRAIL","content":"After breakfast the following morning Ridley and his companion saddled their horses to ride back to Highbank, where they would wait for the trail boss. As they finished cinching up, Big Tom strolled into the corral and smilingly watched them. \"I suppose you want Mac to bring you a check, as usual?\" queried Ridley, swinging into the saddle. \"This is th\u0027 one time I\u0027d rather have cash,\" replied the foreman. \"With cash, in th\u0027 next week, I can make a quick turnover.\" \"Cash it is,\" said Ridley. \"Gold or bills?\" \"Make it bills,\" answered Big Tom. \"I\u0027m glad I met you boys—come up again next year. If yo\u0027re lookin\u0027 for good cattle then I\u0027ll have plenty.\" \"Then I reckon we\u0027ll be here. So-long.\" \"So-long,\" replied the foreman, watching them ride away. As they dropped from sight over a rise he smiled cynically and went back to the ranchhouse. Pausing at the door, he looked out over the range in the direction of the northwest section and the Double X, and slowly turned his head, his gaze passing along the horizon, behind which lay Gunsight, Green Valley, and the SV ranchhouse. \"I said it easy,\" he growled. \"Me throw over a couple of hundred head of mavericks to Arnold, an\u0027[327] split up th\u0027 rest four ways? It makes me laugh! An\u0027 when I hit Nelson he\u0027ll wonder what kind of brains he really has got. There\u0027s a jolt comin\u0027 to this section, an\u0027 it\u0027ll be Big Tom that springs it. About one week more an\u0027 I play my hand!\" Four days passed and then, in the afternoon of the fifth a great dust cloud appeared far down the Highbank trail. Fraser discovered it and called Big Tom from the ranchhouse. The foreman glanced south, told the puncher to ride off and get the herd started, and then hurried to his horse, sprang into the saddle, and rode toward McCullough\u0027s sign. He had hardly more than gained the regular trail when he saw seven men riding toward him at a good pace, and no second glance was needed to identify the one who rode in the middle and slightly ahead. The trail boss was a character to demand attention wherever he might be. Over the medium height, he was so heavily and solidly built that he appeared to be well under it when standing alone; he had the barrel-like chest that stands for strength, and his sloping shoulders were a little rounded from a careless saddle seat of many years. His rugged face was brown, the skin tough as parchment, and the faded blue eyes peered out in a direct, unwavering gaze between lids narrowed by the suns and winds, rains and dusts of a life spent in the open. His head was massive and the iron-gray hair, falling almost to his shoulders, gave it a leonine appearance. He wore no chaps, for his riding took him into few thickets and there was no reason for him to bear their discomforts. His clothing was simple[328] and loose: black, heavy, woolen trousers thrust into soft, high boots with moderate heels, and bearing no spurs, for he depended on his quirt; a blade, woolen vest, buttoned at the bottom, from an upper pocket of which protruded the well-chewed stem of a pipe; a heavy, faded, blue flannel shirt, open over the bronzed, hairy chest and throat; a faded blue kerchief, knotted loosely about his neck; a heavy, gray sombrero, moderate in height of crown, but with a wide brim. He rode a Cheyenne saddle, devoid of ornamentation, its housings covering the horse from rump to withers, and the reins of the bridle, contrary to the prevailing fashion of that southern range at that time, were short. A .44 Winchester lay in its sheath under his right leg; a braided hair lariat was coiled at the pommel; a heavy, plain six-shooter rested in an open holster; and behind him was rolled the everlasting yellow slicker. He rode a magnificent bay horse whose spirit was shown in every movement, and which would follow him about like a dog. Over all was dust, gray, thick, impalpable dust. \"Hello, Huff!\" he bellowed. \"Come down to see if I got lost? Join up with us; I\u0027m figgerin\u0027 that Triangle herd may be up at this end of th\u0027 crick, an\u0027 if it is, it\u0027s got to move. Them long-laigged cattle of mine ain\u0027t had a drink since yesterday mornin\u0027, an\u0027 they\u0027ll shore rush that crick. We\u0027ll have some cuttin\u0027 out to do if th\u0027 other herd is in their path. How \u0027bout it?\" \"You can pull up, then,\" replied Big Tom. \"They\u0027re well to th\u0027 south of th\u0027 bunkhouse—you got plenty of room for ten times that little bunch yo\u0027re so peart about I heard they are th\u0027 leavin\u0027s of four Greaser ranches.\" [329] \"Glad to learn they ain\u0027t there,\" said McCullough. \"They\u0027re such leavin\u0027s an\u0027 scourin\u0027s,\" smiled one of his companions, \"that I\u0027m advisin\u0027 Mac to double th\u0027 night guard while he\u0027s within\u0027 forty miles of this bunch of ranches.\" \"We\u0027ll count that Triangle bunch right away,\" said the trail boss. \"Where\u0027s yourn?\" \"It\u0027s on its way,\" answered Big Tom. \"It\u0027ll be on hand soon enough. Goin\u0027 to count that, too, tonight?\" \"Shore. An\u0027 throw \u0027em together, an\u0027 bed down on Clear River, so we can get a two-hour jump-off in th\u0027 mornin\u0027. Is th\u0027 Double X holdin\u0027 its bunch in th\u0027 same old place?\" \"I reckon so,\" replied Big Tom, and soon they passed the Triangle ranchhouse, where Hank Lewis rode forth to join them. \"Get yore boys, Lewis,\" shouted the trail boss. \"We\u0027ll count that herd right away.\" \"They\u0027re with it now,\" replied Lewis, as he drew nearer. \"Glad you brought some of yore boys along—I\u0027m short-handed for quick work.\" It was not long before they reached the herd and it was slowly crowded into a more compact mass, and became wedge-shaped. McCullough, one of his men, and the two foremen stopped before the point, the trail boss and Huff on one side, the others not far away and facing them. The herd started slowly forward, narrowing to an animated ribbon which flowed between the two pairs of counters and kept them busy. McCullough and Lewis counted on knotted strings fastened[330] to their pommels, Huff used his fingers to check off the tally, fifty head to each digit, while the fourth man threw a coil of his rope over the pommel of his saddle at each hundred. The counting was finished well under ten minutes and the results compared. Lewis said five hundred and five, the other three announcing five hundred and six. The Triangle foreman laughed. \"Here is where I get paid for a missin\u0027 cow.\" \"Three to one bein\u0027 good enough for me,\" replied the trail boss, grinning, \"I says you do. It\u0027s worth that to see you again; an\u0027 what\u0027s a cow between friends?\" He turned in his saddle. \"You might move \u0027em up closer to th\u0027 trail, boys,\" he shouted, and added with a chuckle, \"they\u0027ll disappear when my long-laigs come along.\" His prediction was justified, for the long-legs, having run the last mile or two with the scent of water in their red nostrils, poured into the creek and soaked themselves inside and out. By the time McCullough and his group reached the scene, the Bar H herd was crossing the trail. The counting was gone over again, the tallies agreeing to a single cow, and the Bar H herd was allowed to join the strangers along the creek. In due time the enlarged herd was thrown back on the trail, and when the Triangle five hundred joined it they were, indeed, swallowed up. The trail boss and Big Tom rode off to the Triangle ranchhouse, figured for a moment and then exchanged cash for a receipt. The foreman shoved the bills into his pockets and went with McCullough back to the herd,[331] picked up the squad, and had the Double X contingent counted before the trail herd reached the river. As the herd came along it made a fine sight for a cowman to look upon, the cattle strung out for three-quarters of a mile in length and spread well out on both sides of the trail, well watered and fed, and making under these conditions four miles an hour. The chuck wagon, drawn by four mules, rolled far ahead of it, the caviya of a hundred and thirty saddle horses to one side and also ahead. Each of the two point men was followed by four swing men, five to a side, and they had nothing to do now but look out for stragglers and to keep local cattle from joining the invading host. The bed ground was well chosen and the night promised to be a good one, notwithstanding that clouds were forming and the moon would be more or less obscured. After the Double X contingent had joined their trail mates for the long journey and the great herd had bedded down, half of the trail outfit, together with the punchers from the ranches, headed for town, McCullough electing to remain with the herd. Big Tom and Lewis shook hands with him and returned to their ranchhouses, riding together part of the way. Just before they separated Lewis looked up. \"I heard that Arnold was ridin\u0027 today—one of th\u0027 Double X boys met him at th\u0027 trail. I reckon it must feel good to be in th\u0027 saddle again after such a long siege in bed.\" \"I\u0027m bettin\u0027 it does,\" smiled Big Tom. \"I had a dose of it when I was a young man, an\u0027 once is shore a-plenty.\" \"He must think so, for he\u0027s aimin\u0027 to ride to town[332] every day, an\u0027 spend some of his time gettin\u0027 acquainted with Dave an\u0027 his friends. Well, I\u0027m leavin\u0027 you here. Good night.\" \"Good night,\" replied Big Tom, riding on with a sinister smile on his face. The following morning was cloudy, which suited the Bar H foreman, who had a long ride ahead of him. He opened the south door of the ranchhouse, looked out and caught sight of a movement near the right-hand corner. A full-grown rattler was crawling slowly across a sand patch, and the foreman watched it idly. Then he grinned. \"Wonder how good my gunplay is these days?\" he muttered, and his Colt leaped from its holster and roared. The snake writhed swiftly into an agonized coil, its flat head moving back and forth, its tongue darting angrily, and its rattles buzzing steadily. Huff growled at himself and fired again. The flattened, venomous head sank down, twisting and turning on the writhing coils. \"H—l!\" growled the marksman, walking slowly forward for a closer look, which showed him that his last shot had cut through the vertebra and half of one side of the neck. It was good enough, and he turned and walked along the side of the house. Passing a window, he suddenly stopped and looked closely at the ground just under its sill, where boot prints were plainly visible. Before doing anything else he reloaded his gun, and then followed the prints with his eyes until the corner of the house cut them from sight. He stepped back until he could see the bunkhouse door to learn if anyone[333] was coming up to investigate the shots, and his gaze followed the prints straight toward it until they became lost on harder ground. No one being curious about the shooting, he went back to the window and peered in. He could see nothing because of the curtain, and had about decided that he had enjoyed secrecy the night before, when a sudden thought struck him. The interior, being dark now, was not right for a test, and he went around to the door, opened it, threw up the other shades, and hastily returned to the window, where he smothered a curse as a small hole in the curtain let him see quite plainly. Again returning to the house, he closed the door and slipped his extra Colt into the waist-band of his trousers, where one side of his open vest covered it, put on his coat and, going out the rear door, sauntered toward the bunkhouse, his eyes finding and losing the boot marks as the trail passed over varying ground. Before he reached the house his four men emerged from it and began the regular, humorous, morning wrangle as to preference in the use of wash basin and towel. They grinned at his approach and he smiled in return, his eyes missing nothing in their expressions, and it was Fraser at whom he looked longest when he spoke. \"Throw my saddle on th\u0027 big bay, Bill,\" he smiled pleasantly. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 up to Sherman to fatten th\u0027 balance at th\u0027 bank. I may be back tomorrow night, but if I hear of any cattle that can be got cheap I may go on an\u0027 look \u0027em over. You boys have plenty of supplies, but if you run short go up to Dailey. If he\u0027s got any cigars, get a box—I reckon we can afford that[334] much of a celebration, in view of that herd. But don\u0027t drink too much. You know why.\" Fraser got the saddle from the storeroom and went out to put it on the foreman\u0027s best horse. As he came out of the door he nodded toward the north. \"There\u0027s Mac\u0027s sign already; he must \u0027a\u0027 passed around Gunsight. He\u0027s well on his way.\" The others looked at the faint thickening in the air beyond the town and past the east end of Pine Mountain, where the dust from four thousand cattle rose heavenward. \"He\u0027s a wise bird, gettin\u0027 to th\u0027 crick last night,\" commented Carson. \"He\u0027s been movin\u0027 since dawn; an\u0027 I bet he\u0027s glad it\u0027s cloudy, with that dry stretch ahead of him.\" \"Shucks!\" snorted Dahlgren. \"Thirty mile of dry trail ain\u0027t nothin\u0027.\" \"Not much,\" admitted Carson; \"but, still, it\u0027s better cloudy than boilin\u0027 under th\u0027 sun.\" \"I reckon Mac ain\u0027t thinkin\u0027 as much about it bein\u0027 cloudy as I am,\" smiled the foreman, turning to take the horse Fraser was leading to him. He had asked Fraser to get and saddle his horse in the hope that the puncher would stand on his dignity and, perhaps, provoke a quarrel, out of which anything might come; but Fraser paid no attention to the request, unusual as it was, and grinned as he stepped back. \"It\u0027s fifty miles to Sherman, an\u0027 I\u0027d ruther have it cloudy, all th\u0027 way,\" smiled Big Tom, mounting. \"Well, so-long, boys!\" and he was off. He chose the trail over Pine Mountain, not so much[335] for its saving in miles, but because it gave him a high, distant point from which to look back over his trail, and it avoided the Doc\u0027s shack and Gunsight as well. Reaching the top of the mountain, he turned and closely scrutinized the trail, finding nothing to bother him; but he was bothered, nevertheless, and he determined to pay as much attention to the trail he covered as to that which lay before him. Setting out again, he went well to the west of Gunsight and struck the Sherman trail ten miles beyond the town. Back on the Bar H, Fraser was thinking. He had been doing a lot of it the last week, and he had not been alone in it. When his foreman had ridden off he leaned against the door and watched him until he was lost to sight. Dahlgren and Carney passed out, joked with him and went to the corral, soon riding off to the south. Dick Carson passed out a little later, paused, retraced his steps and leaned against the other door jamb. \"Wonder if yo\u0027re thinkin\u0027 th\u0027 same as me?\" he quietly asked. Fraser looked at him closely. \"I don\u0027t know; I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 of a gamble,\" he replied, hooking a thumb in an armhole of his vest. \"Shore; so am I,\" nodded Carson, carelessly. \"This here range is shot full of holes, for us.\" \"It is,\" admitted Fraser. \"We been driftin\u0027 them mavericks for three years—an\u0027 now they\u0027re goin\u0027 to be throwed back, branded, an\u0027 th\u0027 rest cut four ways. How are we goin\u0027 to stop it?\" [336] \"I\u0027m figgerin\u0027 on driftin\u0027 myself; but I hate to drift alone, an\u0027 empty-handed,\" growled Carson. \"I come down here to work for Huff, for fifty a month, an\u0027 pickin\u0027s. I\u0027ve been gettin\u0027 th\u0027 fifty—but there won\u0027t be no pickin\u0027s, less\u0027n I run some off with me. I\u0027m tired of this blasted country, anyhow. Why, I\u0027d ruther take chances, like Nevada, than go on this way down here. H—l!\" he snorted in angry disgust. \"I\u0027m sayin\u0027 I fair itches to gamble,\" he added. Fraser shifted to a more comfortable position. \"What do you think th\u0027 boss has got in his pockets right now?\" he asked, cynically. \"A big, fat check, that won\u0027t do him nor us any good,\" replied Carson. \"Check!\" Fraser laughed sarcastically. \"Check? He allus used to have a check, after delivery; but he ain\u0027t got one now. He\u0027s got bills, wads an\u0027 wads of bills. Quite some over six thousand, I reckon, in bills. I saw his pockets bulgin\u0027, an\u0027 I wondered why he didn\u0027t take a check, same as usual. I wanted to make shore, so I did some scoutin\u0027 up around th\u0027 ranchhouse last night—I saw \u0027em. Wads, an\u0027 wads. I was shore tempted.\" Carson was looking off toward Pine Mountain, an evil expression on his face, and he moved restlessly. \"There\u0027s only one reason for that,\" he muttered, and turned to his companion. \"Are you still thinkin\u0027 of a gamble?\" he demanded, all thought of cattle out of his mind. \"Th\u0027 herd money is shore worth while—what you say about it?\" \"I was sort of turnin\u0027 it over in my head,\" Fraser[337] admitted \"It\u0027s a lot of money; a powerful lot of money for one man to tote.\" \"It\u0027ll still be a lot of money if it\u0027s split in two,\" suggested Carson. \"Do you figger he\u0027s goin\u0027 to bank it? All that cash? Why didn\u0027t he take a check? Why did he change, just when things was gettin\u0027 worse down here all th\u0027 time?\" \"I don\u0027t know; but he\u0027s allus been purty white to me.\" \"Has he been three thousand dollars\u0027 worth?\" asked Carson, smiling evilly. \"I\u0027m figgerin\u0027 he\u0027s lettin\u0027 us hold th\u0027 sack, that\u0027s what I\u0027m figgerin\u0027. An\u0027 if he don\u0027t come back, who\u0027s goin\u0027 to sign checks for our pay? We\u0027re losin\u0027 our share of all them mavericks. There won\u0027t be no nice bunch of cattle goin\u0027 up th\u0027 trail for us fellers, not now. But there\u0027s one whoppin\u0027 big bunch of cash goin\u0027 up a trail for us, if we go after it. How\u0027s yore nerve? What\u0027s th\u0027 use of playin\u0027 for buttons, when there\u0027s bills to be had?\" \"If I reckoned he was goin\u0027 to bank that money I wouldn\u0027t touch it, not if I was shore he was comin\u0027 back to stick with th\u0027 ranch,\" muttered Fraser. \"But I reckon he\u0027s throwed us down. I reckon we\u0027re holdin\u0027 th\u0027 sack, all right. An\u0027 if he aims to keep it, then we has as much right to it as he has. Cuss him! he\u0027s chicken-livered! Come on: I\u0027m with you,\" and he led the way into the house to get some of his personal belongings. \"He\u0027s got a start on us, an\u0027 a cussed good hoss,\" growled Carson as they hastened to the corral. \"We can\u0027t save nothin\u0027 by cuttin\u0027 across, neither.\" [338] \"No, we can\u0027t; but we can take a lead hoss apiece,\" said his companion, \"an\u0027 ride without carin\u0027 what happens to th\u0027 ones we start on. He won\u0027t be pushin\u0027 hard—he don\u0027t like hard ridin\u0027, he thinks too much of his hoss, an\u0027 he ain\u0027t got no reason to be in any great hurry. He\u0027s serene as a snake full of birds, chucklin\u0027 at how easy it is.\" Down on the southern part of the ranch, in a draw, there was another conference, where Dahlgren and Carney also were mourning the deplorable state of affairs on the range. \"Three years\u0027 work gone to blazes,\" grumbled Little Tom, resentfully. \"I\u0027m near on th\u0027 prod.\" \"Gettin\u0027 near on th\u0027 prod ain\u0027t worth nothin\u0027,\" replied Dahlgren. \"It\u0027s gettin\u0027 on one, a good one, an\u0027 stayin\u0027 with it, that counts. I figgers we still got a lot of interest in them mavericks, an\u0027 I\u0027m dead shore there ain\u0027t nobody watchin\u0027 \u0027em this side of th\u0027 Double X line.\" \"There\u0027s a lot of \u0027em away south of there,\" said Carney. \"There\u0027s a couple of herds hang out closer to th\u0027 water hole in West Arroyo. I\u0027ve seen \u0027em often when I rode that way. We could round up near three hundred, hold \u0027em in that blind canyon till evenin\u0027, an\u0027 then run th\u0027 whole bunch over th\u0027 Double X southwest corner an\u0027 get \u0027em well away tonight. It\u0027s cloudy, an\u0027 there won\u0027t be much moon showin\u0027—just enough light to see what we\u0027re doin\u0027, an\u0027 not enough to show us up for any distance. Th\u0027 four of us can swing that herd in bang-up style—an\u0027 Big Tom won\u0027t never catch us, once we get into th\u0027 Snake Buttes country. An\u0027 what\u0027s[339] more, I know where unmarked cattle can be sold, with no questions an\u0027 at a fair price. Th\u0027 game\u0027s up for us, down here, anyhow.\" \"You aimin\u0027 to let them two in on this?\" \"I\u0027d ruther let \u0027em in on it, an\u0027 swing more cattle, than have \u0027em trailin\u0027 us tomorrow. An\u0027 four ain\u0027t too many for drivin\u0027 through th\u0027 Buttes.\" \"I don\u0027t like splittin\u0027 \u0027em four ways,\" growled Dahlgren, but he grudgingly gave his consent \"All right. Go up an\u0027 feel \u0027em out, while I start roundin\u0027 up. Don\u0027t give nothin\u0027 away before you know how they feel about it.\" \"I\u0027m off. They wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to ride out till late, an\u0027 mebby I\u0027ll catch \u0027em at th\u0027 house,\" and Carney was off like a shot. He was not gone long, and when he returned he spread out his hands expressively. \"They\u0027ve pulled their stakes, I reckon,\" he reported. \"Their blankets an\u0027 \u0027most everythin\u0027 they owned, of any account, was gone. My extra gun is missin\u0027, an\u0027 our stuff is spread all over th\u0027 place. I rustled some supplies, an\u0027 found they had been there, too. Let \u0027em go!\" \"Cussed glad of it; now it\u0027s halves, instead of fourths,\" replied Dahlgren, cheerfully. \"Come on; let\u0027s push this work. Don\u0027t get any more branded cattle than you can help; but we ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to waste no time cuttin\u0027 any out.\" Up on the Sherman trail Big Tom was swinging along within ten miles of town when, passing a particularly high, abrupt hill, he turned out, rode along it and, dismounting, went up on foot until he could peer[340] across the top of it. He did not have long to wait, for soon two horsemen appeared far back on the trail, where it crossed a wide, open space. Going back to his horse, he led it into a thicket and tied it to a bush, took his rifle and returned to the hill top, where he chose cover close to the bank at the trail\u0027s edge, and settled down comfortably to wait. As the two riders drew nearer he recognized them by their ensemble, and by the way they sat their saddles, and it was not long before he could make out details. They were riding hard, both keenly alert, peering along the trail ahead of them. Nearer and nearer they came, pushing ahead at a fast, hard pace, eager to overtake him before he reached the town. Sweeping past the steep bank, they shot around a bend and went on. Big Tom watched them until they had passed from sight, and then arose and nodded. \"It\u0027s a good thing for you that you missed me!\" he growled. \"I hate to lose th\u0027 pay-roll money; but what\u0027s got to be done has got to be done. My interest in Sherman has plumb faded. Now for a smash at Nelson that\u0027ll hurt him to his dyin\u0027 day, d—n him!\" Darkness had fallen on the range and the night riders of the west section of the Double X were Slim Hawkes, Tom Wilkes, and Cimarron, who had the first shift. They were back on the old three-shift plan and would be off duty at half-past eleven. Cimarron had ridden south and had reached the end of his beat, the north side of a shallow arroyo. He softly gave the night\u0027s signal and, receiving no reply, decided to wait for a[341] while, for Slim was due to reach and stop at the other side of the arroyo at any minute. He could faintly discern the outlines of objects at quite a respectable distance and wondered how soon the moon would break through the filmy clouds. Suddenly he listened closely and thought he detected the noise made by a herd. Slime\u0027s signal came faintly to him and he replied to it with a double one. In a few minutes Slim loomed up out of the dark. \"Are you hearin\u0027 that, too?\" asked Slim in a whisper. \"I am,\" replied Cimarron. \"That\u0027s a herd, an\u0027 there\u0027s work for me an\u0027 you. It\u0027s comin\u0027 up from th\u0027 south, bearin\u0027 a little west, I reckon. How do you figger it?\" \"West, bearin\u0027 a little north,\" answered Slim. \"But it\u0027s shore comin\u0027 from our range, which is enough for us. I\u0027m askin\u0027 no questions tonight. Th\u0027 last time I sung out Nevada shot me up. I\u0027m doin\u0027 my talkin\u0027 tonight with my gun. An\u0027 I\u0027m hopin\u0027 it\u0027s Nevada, personal: I owe him somethin\u0027.\" \"Don\u0027t separate, or we\u0027ll mebby shoot each other,\" growled Cimarron. \"If we hit \u0027em from this side we\u0027ll mebby turn th\u0027 herd so it\u0027ll stampede back where it belongs; an\u0027 if it does, th\u0027 fellers on th\u0027 other side will have plenty to do for a couple of minutes, an\u0027 give us a chance to get to \u0027em. It\u0027s closer. Are you ready?\" Slim loosened his left foot from the stirrup and then lay forward along the neck of his horse, Cimarron doing likewise; and then the two animals moved forward at a walk, innocent of any silhouetted figures sticking up in the saddles. Louder and louder grew the sound and[342] soon the two clinging riders could plainly distinguish the rattle of horns from the hoofbeats. A few minutes more, and then a mounted figure became vaguely outlined. The herd was being moved at a walk, possibly to avoid greater noise until it was well across the Double X line, and now its bulk could be guessed at. The herder leaned forward suddenly to scrutinize two moving blots he barely could make out against a rise of ground behind them, and the movement was the beginning of the end, for him. A sudden stream of fire poured from the left-hand blot and he slid from his saddle without a sound. The blots let out yells and dashed for the front ranks of the herd, which wheeled like a flash and thundered across the range over a course at right angles to the one which they had been following. The two night guards spurred towards the place where they hoped to come in contact with other rustlers, but found no one to oppose them, and they then set out to follow the herd. Far ahead of them they saw two flashes, followed at certain, agreed-upon intervals by another and then a fourth. Cimarron fired once, counted twelve and then sent two more shots into the air as close together as he could make them, which left nothing to be desired on that score. When he and Slim neared the herd again the moon shone down faintly and let them see what they were doing. \"Where\u0027d you get \u0027em?\" yelled Matt Webb. \"There ain\u0027t a brand on \u0027em, that I can see; an\u0027 I can see plain enough for that.\" \"Where do you suppose we got \u0027em?\" retorted Cimarron, \"from Europe?\" He rode at one end of[343] the front rank and had the satisfaction of seeing it falter. \"I see a Bar H mark!\" shouted Rich Morgan. \"An\u0027 they\u0027re stoppin\u0027, thank th\u0027 Lord!\" In another ten minutes the herd started milling and soon afterward became sensible. \"I say we have been made a present of some of Huff\u0027s pets,\" chuckled Rich. \"He says mavericks take title from th\u0027 ranch they\u0027re on; an\u0027 I\u0027m gamblin\u0027 these are on th\u0027 Double X!\" \"If they was ours I\u0027d say to let \u0027em wander,\" spoke up Cimarron. \"Seein\u0027 as they ain\u0027t, I reckon it\u0027ll save a lot of work if we beds \u0027em down an\u0027 keeps \u0027em together. I\u0027ll go on in an\u0027 let Lin know, so he can turn out th\u0027 off shift. We shot somebody out near that dividin\u0027 arroyo between Slim\u0027s section an\u0027 mine; you might take a look out that way. Slim\u0027s hopin\u0027 it was Nevada; but I\u0027m sayin\u0027 mebby he\u0027ll be surprised when he finds out who it is.\" \"I\u0027m guessin\u0027 right about th\u0027 outfit he belongs to, anyhow,\" replied Slim. \"An\u0027 I\u0027m not goin\u0027 in till I sees which one he is. Comin\u0027, Matt? I\u0027ll ride out with you.\" Leaving Cimarron to go to the bunkhouse for the off shift, Slim and Matt rode rapidly toward the scene of the fight, and when they reached it they saw a figure on the ground. Dismounting they bent over it, and then looked at each other. \"Dahlgren!\" breathed Slim. Matt nodded. \"They wasn\u0027t waitin\u0027 for their mavericks to be split four ways,\" he said, covering the up[344]turned face with the dead man\u0027s sombrero. \"They was stealin\u0027 a march on Big Tom while he is up in Sherman. Well, anyhow, he was on th\u0027 rustle—an\u0027 there ain\u0027t no harm done. Go on in, an\u0027 get yore sleep. As to th\u0027 herd, I reckon Arnold has got th\u0027 best title to it—but that\u0027s for Lin to say. If he does throw \u0027em over to th\u0027 SV it\u0027ll save Big Tom th\u0027 shame of doin\u0027 it hisself.
