{"id":18882,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV WITH HIS SHADOW BEFORE HIM","content":"The following morning was a quiet one in Gunsight and a stranger entering the town would have thought an epidemic of sleeping sickness had raided it, for yawns would have met him wherever he turned, and quite some headaches, the owners of which were short of temper and ugly in words. Dave dozed in his chair and his countenance was not a smiling one. He opened his eyes from time to time and fell asleep again with a scowl. Ben Dailey petulantly cursed everything his clumsy fingers bungled, and it can be said that clumsiness was not the normal condition of those digits. Art Fanning, whose hired man could run the routine affairs of the hotel as well without him, turned and tossed on his bed, finally getting up and poking his head out into the hall. Thinking he heard a noise in Nelson\u0027s room, he went to the door and hammered on it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"House afire?\" demanded Johnny, sleepily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; but my head is,\" growled Fanning. \"What you say about a bucket of roarin\u0027 strong coffee for us sinners?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say yo\u0027re shoutin\u0027. Comin\u0027 in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Naw; I got to put on some clothes—an\u0027 find some socks; these here are roundin\u0027 my heels an\u0027 climbin\u0027 up my laigs. I\u0027m shore hard on socks,\" he growled. Leaning over the stairs he let out a bellow, \"Hey, George!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [39] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll swear he heard you,\" said Johnny. \"Mebby th\u0027 Bar H did, too. I never saw nobody go under so quick from liquor as Big Tom an\u0027 Squint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, George!\" yelled Fanning. \"Oh, they was well ribbed before they hit town. Where th\u0027——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you want?\" asked a voice from below. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you think I want!\" retorted Fanning. \"Yore gran\u0027mother\u0027s aunt? You brew us a quart of coffee apiece, and brew it my way. I been bit by a snake.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want none of that paint,\" objected George, surprised. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who said you did?\" snapped Fanning. \"Who cares what you want? Nelson an\u0027 I\u0027ll handle that. Jump lively or I\u0027ll shoot down th\u0027 stairs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shoot, if you wants. They don\u0027t belong to me. You can shoot down th\u0027 house, if you wants!\" George slammed the door with vim. \"\u0027Bit by a snake!\u0027 Bet it was a hydrophoby skunk. I\u0027ll brew him some coffee that\u0027ll stunt his growth, blast him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After breakfast, during which his companion found fault three times with everything in sight, Johnny wandered around and dropped in to see Jerry Poole, the harness-maker. Jerry\u0027s mouth tasted of burnt leather and alum from his night\u0027s indiscretions and he was so unendurably ugly that his visitor, twiddling his fingers at him, dodged a chunk of wax and departed, going into Dailey\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, yoreself!\" growled Dailey. He fumbled a ball of cord, dropped it, and kicked it through a window. \"Now look what you done!\" he yelled. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny wheeled, slammed the door, and wandered[40] to the Palace. Peering in, he assayed a test of Dave\u0027s hospitality. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you feel?\" he asked, loudly. \"You was goin\u0027 too fast with th\u0027 juniper.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dave straightened up, glared at him for a moment and found a more comfortable position. \"You can go to Juniper, or h—l, for all I care!\" he grunted, and went off to sleep again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny leaned against the wall in momentary indecision. Hearing shuffling steps, he looked up to see Two-Spot rounding the corner. His face brightened. Here was someone with whom he could talk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Howd\u0027y, Ol\u0027 Timer,\" he said, cheerily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Howd\u0027y,\" grunted Two-Spot, and passed into the Palace. There was a noise within, a crashing of chair legs, and a thunder of words. Two-Spot came out again in undignified haste, crossed the street in three leaps and, turning, shook his unwashed fist at Dave, Johnny, Gunsight, and Creation, and told his opinion of them all. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny shook his head and went around the corner. \"Pepper\u0027s th\u0027 only company fit to \u0027sociate with; an\u0027 a ride won\u0027t do me no harm. Reckon I\u0027ll go down an\u0027 wander around that hill between th\u0027 SV an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle. I ain\u0027t been south of that valley yet.\" He looked up at the sun. \"Cussed if it ain\u0027t noon already!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n While Gunsight slept or swore, the day\u0027s work was going on as usual on the SV. Arnold had finished a hurried breakfast and ridden out to the north boundary of his ranch, at that point not more than a mile from[41] the house, to continue setting posts for a fence. His boundary ran along the foot of hills heavily covered with brush and timber and he had grown tired of turning his cattle from them. Having found several rolls of wire left by the former owner of the SV, he determined to use them and make them go as far as they would. If they reached no farther than across the Devil\u0027s Gulch section and the creek, he would be repaid for his labor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reaching the gulch, he started to work and found the task disheartening. The ravine was rocky and bowlder-strewn and he had difficulty in finding places for the posts. More than half of the morning had passed when he reached the bottom of the gulch and began to look for a place where his shovel would do more than scratch rock. After a fruitless search he abandoned the idea of digging and determined to build a cairn around the post. Taking a crowbar, he attacked the side of the gulch and sent several rocks rolling down. He was prying at a small bowlder with indifferent success when the rock under it, giving way unexpectedly in a small slide of gravel and shale, freed the bowlder suddenly and sent it crashing downward before he could get out of its way. It passed over his left leg and he dropped in agony, the leg broken below the knee. There was only one thing for him to do and he tried it, despite the excruciating pain. He had to drag himself to his horse and get into the saddle somehow. There was no way to call for help with any chance of being heard, for he did not pack a gun, believing himself safer without one. Not being able to use a six-gun[42] well, he knew he would have no chance against men who used them as though they were an integral part of themselves; and to carry a weapon under those circumstances would be suicidal, for he then would become an armed man and have to assume the responsibilities of one. \\n\\n \\n\\n After what seemed to be an age, he finally reached the top of the gulch, and saw his horse. Resting for a few minutes, he again dragged himself forward. The horse wheeled, pricked up its ears and stared at him in panicky fear. Snorting, the animal dashed away at top speed, the injured man calling after it in despair. \\n\\n \\n\\n Back in the ranchhouse Margaret set the table for the noon meal. The dinner was nearly cooked when she glanced out of the window and saw her father\u0027s saddled horse standing at the corral. Going to the door, she called out that dinner was ready, well knowing her father\u0027s habit of not coming until the food was nearly spoiled. Her brother appeared from the tool shed and splashed with the wash basin, which he firmly believed was all that was necessary; but his sister, wise in the ways of boyhood, thought otherwise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you dare to touch that towel,\" she warned. \"If you want any dinner, wash your hands and face with soap—get them wet, anyway. Charley, for a ten-year-old boy you are hopeless!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 for a twenty-year-old woman you are a nuisance,\" retorted Charley. \"You women don\u0027t do nothing but find fault. Where\u0027s dad?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. When you have washed go tell him that dinner will be spoiled if he doesn\u0027t hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [43] \\n\\n \\n\\n Charley growled something, made a creditable effort at revealing his face, and departed to find his father. After a short but fruitless search, he returned and reported his failure. \"Wonder where he went?\" he demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret felt a chill of apprehension. Fears of this kind were not strangers to her, for she had felt many of them in the last two years. \"Perhaps Lazy wandered home without him,\" she suggested. \"It wouldn\u0027t be the first time. You would better saddle Pinto, and go see. Take Lazy with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you want any dinner you\u0027d better be starting. The sooner you return, the sooner you will eat,\" she declared, with vexation. \"You know that I cannot leave now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right!\" growled Charley. He slouched to the corral, saddled Pinto, caught Lazy, and loped toward the gulch. \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret\u0027s impatience gave way to a nameless fear as the minutes passed without sign of the \"men.\" Going to the door again, she looked out, caught her breath, and then ran toward the corral. Her father, supported in the saddle by her brother, was riding slowly toward the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dad\u0027s broke his leg, Peggy; a big rock come down on it,\" said Charley, gloomily. \"Help me get him into the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Between them they soon had him on his bed and Margaret told her brother to ride to Gunsight for the doctor. \\n\\n \\n\\n [44] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He won\u0027t come,\" groaned the injured man. \"If he wouldn\u0027t come when you needed him, he won\u0027t come for me. Don\u0027t waste any time with Reed—I wouldn\u0027t have the blackguard if he would come! Charley, you\u0027ll have to make that ride to Highbank again. I hate to ask it of you, but there is nothing else to be done. Forty-five miles is too long a ride for Peggy, and besides, I need her here. Eat your dinner, sonny, and then start as soon as you can. I only hope Doctor Treadwell is sober enough to sit a horse when you get there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gee, Dad! I can do it!\" Charley asserted. \"I did it before in five hours—I\u0027ll do it in less this time. Pinto can run all day, for she\u0027s a good little horse. Take good care of him, Sis; I\u0027m off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Grabbing a chunk of meat, and stuffing his pockets with bread, Charley dashed out of the house, climbed into the saddle, and rode off. \"Come on, Pinto!\" he pleaded. \"It\u0027s goin\u0027 to be a long, hard wait for dad!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Fording the river, he took the slope of the hill beyond at a walk and, reaching the crest, shot down the other side. Soon he came to a better trail, where the Triangle punchers rode when they went out to their north line. He had not gone far along it before he saw a horseman ahead of him, and when the rider turned and looked back, Charley felt a thrill of fear. It was Squint Farrell. \\n\\n \\n\\n Squint was still going home from Gunsight and he was not yet sober. Worse than that, he was in a savage mood. When his outfit had started for the ranch, in the early, dark hours of the morning, he had fallen[45] behind them, stupid with drink. At the end of one of his spells of mental oblivion he suddenly realized that he was alone, and urged his horse forward in hope of overtaking his friends. If left to itself the animal would have followed the trail to the ranch; but in his sodden frame of mind the rider knew better. \"G\u0027wan!\" he ordered, pulling savagely on the reins, and barely managing to ride out the ensuing bucking. \"Where you—goin\u0027? I\u0027m boss of this—here outfit an\u0027 I\u0027m goin\u0027 home. I\u0027ll—point this here herd. G\u0027wan!\" The result was that when day broke and Squint aroused himself and looked around he had no idea of where he was. \"It\u0027s further\u0027n I reckoned,\" he muttered. \"Don\u0027t care: I\u0027m goin\u0027 to sleep.\" He dismounted, made the horse fast to a sapling, and soon was asleep. When he awakened he looked around in bewilderment and began to take note of his surroundings. Mounting his horse, he rode around and finally got his bearings. He was miles east of the ranchhouse and, with a savage burst of profanity, he turned the horse and started for home. As he crossed the SV-Triangle trail he heard the rapid drumming of a horse\u0027s hoofs and, drawing rein, waited to see who it was. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wonder if he got lost, too?\" he muttered, and then the hard-riding horseman turned the corner and shot into the narrow defile. \"Cussed if it ain\u0027t that brat from th\u0027 SV!\" he exclaimed, and became instantly though hazily suspicious. \"Here, you!\" he shouted. \"What you doin\u0027 on this range? Where you goin\u0027 so fast?\" He turned his horse across the narrow trail, effectually blocking it. \"You speak up, an\u0027 don\u0027t give[46] me none o\u0027 yore lip! Where you goin\u0027?\" He reached for the pinto\u0027s bridle, but missed it as Charley pulled the pony back on its haunches and backed away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to Highbank for the doctor; dad\u0027s broken his leg,\" answered the boy, trying to get past. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, are you?\" snarled Squint \"Wish he\u0027d busted his neck! Go \u0027round an\u0027 git on th\u0027 trail where you oughter; you can\u0027t cross this ranch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t belong to it,\" argued the boy. \"This is the Triangle; and I haven\u0027t got time to go back now. Please, Mr. Farrell, let me past I can\u0027t waste any time!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you?\" sneered Squint \"I say yo\u0027re goin\u0027 \u0027round th\u0027 way you should. G\u0027wan, now! Turn \u0027round, an\u0027 d—d quick, before I does it for you! D—d brat!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please, Mr. Farrell,\" pleaded the boy. \"Let me past. Dad\u0027s suffering, and I\u0027ve got to hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Please, Mr. Farrell,\u0027\" mimicked Squint, savagely. \"You goin\u0027 to do what I say?\" he demanded, drawing his Colt and waving it menacingly. \"I got a notion not to let you go at all, no way. You turn that cayuse, an\u0027 move fast. Hear me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In his desperation Charley forgot his fear. There was only one way to save the precious miles, and he took it. The sides of the defile were steep, and studded with bowlders, but he dug his heels into the pony\u0027s sides and sent him scrambling like a goat up the left-hand bank. He was ten feet above Squint before that surprised individual realized what had occurred; but with the realization came a burst of drunken rage. The[47] heavy gun chopped down and flamed. Pinto rose straight up on his quivering hind legs, stood poised for an instant, and then crashed backward and rolled down to the trail, his rider barely having time to throw himself from the saddle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now you can hoof it!\" shouted Squint, brandishing the gun. \"Next time you\u0027ll listen, an\u0027 do what yo\u0027re told. G\u0027wan home, now!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"D—n you!\" blazed Charley, groping his way down the bank, and kneeling at the side of the little horse. Realizing what was at stake, he flung himself down on the dead pony and sobbed as though his heart would break. \\n\\n \\n\\n Squint kneed his horse forward. \"Don\u0027t you cuss me!\" he warned. \"Don\u0027t you do it, you brat! Serves you right: now you can hoof it!\" He urged his horse into a lope and rode down the trail, arguing with himself, and finally burst into uproarious laughter at the trick he had played. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny, riding as quietly as possible along the side of the big hill, just below and south of the SV-Triangle boundary, looking for rebranded cattle and other signs of range deviltry, pulled up short at the sound of a distant shot. It fitted in very nicely with his suspicious frame of mind and, thinking that he might catch some one red-handed in some of the things he had been searching for, he sent Pepper tearing down the slope and arrived at the trail shortly after Squint had departed. Rounding a turn, he saw the defile and the pitiful scene it held, and he pulled Pepper to her haunches and leaped from the saddle. \\n\\n \\n\\n [48] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, sonny,\" he said, cheerfully, \"yo\u0027re in tough luck, but cryin\u0027—\" then he saw the wound in the horse and his eyes narrowed. \"Who shot that cayuse?\" he demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n Charley told him between sobs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell me all about it,\" demanded Johnny, but when the tale was half over he sprang into the saddle and started down the trail at top speed. \"Stay there, sonny,\" he shouted over his shoulder. At the speed he was making he did not have to ride long before he caught sight of his quarry and he loosened his rope, shook it free, and leaned forward in the saddle. \\n\\n \\n\\n Squint, still arguing, had a Colt in his upraised, waving hand, and was making so much noise with his mouth, and was so interested in and spellbound by his own eloquence that he failed to hear the rolling hoofs behind him until too late. As he turned, the sailing loop dropped over his upraised arm, tightened and pulled him from his horse which, slowing down, soon stopped and fell to grazing. Squint landed on his back, the gun exploding and flying from his hand, his sombrero going to the other side. Johnny came up along the taut rope, swung down, and scooped up the gun, and then released the lariat, recoiling it for future use. Squint opened his eyes, considerably more sober than he had been for twelve hours, and sat up, dazed and angry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What th\u0027—\" he began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shut yore face!\" snapped Johnny. \"Pick up yore hat an\u0027 hoof it to yore cayuse. You was headed wrong, so I stopped you. Move rapid, or I\u0027ll provide some dance music!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [49] \\n\\n \\n\\n Squint tried his legs and arms, found them still to be working, and sullenly plodded to his horse. Mounting, he surrendered his rifle in compliance to orders, and then loped back the way he had come, Johnny riding one length in his rear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Squint,\" said his captor in a hard, level voice, \"if you give me the least excuse I\u0027ll blow you apart. I\u0027ve seen some mangy humans, but I never run across a two-laigged polecat like you. I hate to tell you anythin\u0027 that\u0027ll save yore life, an\u0027 I\u0027m hopin\u0027 you\u0027ll forget it. I\u0027ll tell you just once: You behave yoreself like you never did before, an\u0027 move lively when I speak. Keep looking ahead! You don\u0027t have to look around to hear, do you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Squint preserved an unbroken silence and soon they reached the scene of his outrage and stopped. Johnny ordered him to ride on for a hundred feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s him, Mister!\" excitedly cried Charley. \"That\u0027s th\u0027 big bum!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I agree with you, buddy,\" answered Johnny. \"Now you tell me all of it, over again.\" He listened in grave silence until the pitiful tale was told and then pointed to Pepper\u0027s back, behind him. \"Climb up, sonny. Squint an\u0027 me are passin\u0027 close to yore house an\u0027 we\u0027ll take you as far as we can. You don\u0027t mind walkin\u0027 a few miles, do you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I can\u0027t go!\" protested Charley. \"I got to go to Highbank for th\u0027 doctor. I only hope he ain\u0027t drunk when I get there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How you goin\u0027?\" quizzically demanded Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know; but that don\u0027t make no difference—[50]I just got to go, somehow! Mebby I could take Squint\u0027s horse,\" he suggested, emboldened by desperation. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny shook his head. \"You don\u0027t never want to ride a Bar H cayuse; \u0027tain\u0027t healthy. But, say, bud, we don\u0027t have to go to Highback at all—we can get th\u0027 Doc at Gunsight. You been eatin\u0027 loco weed?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He won\u0027t come,\" said the boy, whispering, and looking at Squint. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you ask him?\" asked Johnny in a low voice, taking the cue. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; but he wouldn\u0027t come when Peggy was sick—an\u0027 dad says to get Dr. Treadwell from Highbank.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t come when—when Peggy was sick?\" demanded Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir; he said he\u0027d treat cows an\u0027 horses, but he wouldn\u0027t sling a leg across a saddle if the whole SV was dying.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny sat up very straight. \"Climb up here, sonny. I\u0027ll get th\u0027 doctor for you—I can get to Highbank on this cayuse so quick you\u0027d be surprised. First, I\u0027ll take you nearer home. Pronto, buddy! Yo\u0027re holdin\u0027 up th\u0027 drive. That\u0027s th\u0027 way; up you come!\" He picked up the reins. \"Squint,\" he called, \"lead th\u0027 way, an\u0027 don\u0027t stay too close. We travel along th\u0027 foot of th\u0027 hill, on th\u0027 other side, goin\u0027 east after we get there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That ain\u0027t th\u0027 way to Highbank,\" said the boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know,\" replied Johnny. \"When you grow up an\u0027 ride around th\u0027 country as long as I have, you\u0027ll find there\u0027s lots of ways gettin\u0027 to places. I\u0027ll have th\u0027 doctor at yore house by ten o\u0027clock tonight, which is some hours before you could get him there. Now,[51] don\u0027t you tell anybody who it was that helped you out. Plumb forget what me an\u0027 Pepper looked like. An\u0027 one thing more—if you say anything about what happened to that drunken coyote ahead, be sure an\u0027 tell \u0027em that he wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to be killed, an\u0027 that they\u0027ll do th\u0027 stranger a great favor if they says nothin\u0027 about th\u0027 whole thing to nobody, nobody at all. Will you do that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shore, Mister,\" assured Charley. \"Ain\u0027t he gettin\u0027 pretty far ahead?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not as far as I\u0027m hopin\u0027 he\u0027ll try to get. But he\u0027s got a most unpleasant memory, he don\u0027t forget nothin\u0027—not nothin\u0027 you tell him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reaching the edge of the valley, they turned east and soon afterward Johnny checked his horse. \"Here\u0027s where you get down, buddy. I hate to make you hoof it, but it won\u0027t be near as hard as ridin\u0027 down to Highbank an\u0027 back. Tell your sister to look for th\u0027 doctor at ten o\u0027clock: I can\u0027t get him there any sooner. So-long, buddy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks, Mister, but my name\u0027s Charley. I\u0027m Charley Arnold.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Glad to meet you, Charley,\" gravely replied Johnny. \"I\u0027ll see you again some day, I hope. So-long, an\u0027 don\u0027t forget nothin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir. Thank you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny pushed forward until he was close behind his prisoner. \"Hit it up, you!\" he ordered. \"Nice, easy lope; I ain\u0027t got all day, if I\u0027m goin\u0027 to Highbank. That\u0027s something else I owe you for, you coyote. An\u0027 I\u0027ll have to wear out my cayuse, an\u0027 come back on a[52] strange one. Oh, if you\u0027ll only make a break, or give me half an excuse to throw lead!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The trail grew slowly but steadily worse, and when they finally reached the bottom of a long, rough slope Johnny ordered a halt. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I figger we\u0027re twenty miles from Gunsight, near as I can judge,\" he said, \"which leaves only ten to Rawlins. Get off that cayuse. You heard me. Yes; get off! Now, any man as shoots a fine little pinto pony an\u0027 tells a kid to walk, ought to do some of that walkin\u0027 hisself. Rawlins is ten miles; it\u0027s twenty to th\u0027 Triangle, an\u0027 with a lot of hills, an\u0027 a bad trail. Also, there\u0027s my six-guns. If I ever hear of you comin\u0027 back, or see you this side of Rawlins I\u0027ll get you. I want to make that plain. If it\u0027s th\u0027 last thing I do on earth, I\u0027ll—get—you! I ain\u0027t got no love for th\u0027 SV, but h—l ain\u0027t good enough for th\u0027 man that\u0027ll shoot a fine hoss to keep a kid from gettin\u0027 a doctor. Thinkin\u0027 as mebby you forgot last night, I\u0027ll give you another sample of my gunplay.\" He jerked out a gun and a hole appeared in the crown of Squint\u0027s hat. \"When I say I\u0027ll get you, you know what it means. Turn around, an\u0027 keep yore shadow before you. Vamoose!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Watching the hurrying Squint until satisfied that he intended to keep on in the right direction, Johnny turned back, leading the Bar H horse. He had watched the animal closely while driving Squint, and believed it to be in good enough condition to answer the demand he wished to make upon it. He could tell better when he got back to the SV range, in a certain woody draw near the main trail. This point was reached at dusk[53] and he examined the horse, nodded his head, and picketed the animal to a tree with Squint\u0027s lariat. The two hours would do wonders for it. Leaving the Bar H horse, he led his own farther back in the draw and tied it to a tree with his lariat. Returning to Squint\u0027s mount, he took the slicker from behind the saddle and unrolled it, picking up the worn gloves which rolled out of it.
