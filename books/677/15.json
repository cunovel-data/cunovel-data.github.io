{"id":18893,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV A DIPLOMATIC MISSION","content":"Riding northward after he had left the hills which lay along the line between the Double X and the Bar H, to find and follow the trail used by the Double X punchers when they rode to and from Gunsight, Johnny was nearing it when he saw a horseman far to the north, riding at speed down a hill and headed straight for him. Keeping on, Johnny turned into the trail in the direction of the Double X bunkhouse, whereupon the other changed his course and rode as if to head him off. From the way in which the other stuck up above the horse, Johnny thought him to be Slim Hawkes, and he pulled Pepper to a walk, rolling a cigarette while he loafed along. His surmise was correct, and soon Slim joined him, his look of suspicion having some time back given way to a smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, Nelson!\" he cried. \"Lost?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not quite,\" answered Johnny, smiling in turn. \"How are you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cheerful, if not handsome,\" grinned Slim. \"Judgin\u0027 from th\u0027 way yo\u0027re headed, I reckon yo\u0027re headed my way. Wolf Forbes chase you away from his pet mavericks?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t see him down there. What\u0027s he doin\u0027—trainin\u0027 \u0027em?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keepin\u0027 \u0027em from strayin\u0027 over on us,\" growled[183] Slim. \"If he\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 seen you there he\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 been plumb nasty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I\u0027m glad he didn\u0027t,\" replied Johnny. \"I don\u0027t like people to be nasty to me. It hurts my feelin\u0027s; I\u0027m what you might call tender.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lookin\u0027 you over, I\u0027d say you was,\" retorted Slim. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to pay you fellers a visit,\" said Johnny. \"Bein\u0027 so tender, I won\u0027t stay long if I ain\u0027t treated nice, or if yore cook is worse than George.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re welcome if you has money with you,\" laughed Slim. \"We make it a point to entertain visitors with plenty of poker. Which reminds me that this must be visitors\u0027 week on th\u0027 Double X. Larry Hallock\u0027s three brothers is visitin\u0027 him, an\u0027 Pete Wiggins\u0027 boy, Arch, dropped in last night. Arch quit th\u0027 Circle 4 an\u0027 was goin\u0027 to Highbank to see his dad, an\u0027 spend his month\u0027s wages. He\u0027s still able to go an\u0027 see his dad, but there ain\u0027t no danger of him spendin\u0027 any of them wages in town. He can\u0027t leave us, now. We got him interested in our entertainment an\u0027 he ain\u0027t got no money left. He aims to stay around an\u0027 get it back. We aim to get his hoss an\u0027 fixin\u0027s, an\u0027 then lend \u0027em to him so he can go down an\u0027 strike old Wiggins for enough to redeem \u0027em. Th\u0027 Hallock boys are doin\u0027 a little better, but we have hopes. Now that yo\u0027re headed for our web, I\u0027m shore everythin\u0027 will be real cheerful. Anyhow, we\u0027ll make you welcome, little stranger, for we\u0027ve got ideas about you that have kept grins on th\u0027 faces of our outfit. Th\u0027 boys are honin\u0027 to pump you. Has th\u0027 Doc been kidnapped again, or has Squint come back?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [184] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Neither of them calamities has happened,\" chuckled Johnny. \"How much can th\u0027 Double X scrape up, in case I makes up my mind to stay a week?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Four dollars an\u0027 two bits. I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to play \u0027em so that you\u0027ll have to put up that black wonder yo\u0027re ridin\u0027. I shore can use her for my very own ridin\u0027 hoss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This cayuse won\u0027t never put no interest in gamblin\u0027,\" said Johnny, stroking a glossy shoulder. \"She\u0027s my pardner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d say she was northern raised,\" guessed Slim. \"Them north ranges shore do make a difference in stock. I\u0027ve heard of Texas ponies puttin\u0027 on a couple of hundred pounds, \u0027an\u0027 even growin\u0027 higher, up there. \u0027Tin-Cup,\u0027\" he read. \"Where\u0027s that located? I never saw that brand before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Up in Montanny,\" replied Johnny. \"I worked for it, an\u0027 bought this cayuse while th\u0027 brand was still red. She\u0027s got blood in her, I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I knowed that as fur as I could see her,\" replied Slim. \"But you ain\u0027t no Northerner. Did you go up with a trail herd, an\u0027 stay over?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I went up by myself. Went up to help a friend spread th\u0027 gospel over his ranch, which was done proper. It\u0027s fine country, but it\u0027s gettin\u0027 crowded.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See many Texas an\u0027 Greaser cattle up there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shore; we wasn\u0027t so far from th\u0027 Musselshell. They\u0027re on th\u0027 trail all th\u0027 time. An\u0027 they ain\u0027t loved a whole lot, neither. Th\u0027 northern punchers try to keep their herds from grazin\u0027 too close to th\u0027 trails. They\u0027re plumb scared about Texas fever. Sometimes a[185] trail herd will pick up quite a lot of local cattle, an\u0027 when they\u0027re cut out they\u0027re mostly held on a range by themselves over a winter, until th\u0027 danger is reckoned to be past. You can\u0027t blame \u0027em, for th\u0027 fever raises th\u0027 very devil in northern herds. I know what I\u0027m talkin\u0027 about, because some fever cattle was throwed over on th\u0027 Tin-Cup by some two-laigged skunks, an\u0027 we had one busy time, I\u0027ll admit. It went through our cattle like fire through dead grass; an\u0027 if it hadn\u0027t been for an Englishman, with plenty of brains in his decivin\u0027 head, it would \u0027a\u0027 been good-by Tin-Cup. It was a squeak for us. How\u0027s everythin\u0027 with you fellers?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Our troubles are periodics,\" replied Slim. \"We\u0027ll have a long stretch of peace an\u0027 quiet, an\u0027 then things will happen in bunches, an\u0027 keep us crow-hoppin\u0027 all over th\u0027 range. We got our southeast section tamed, but our west section boils over every once in a while. Even when it ain\u0027t boilin\u0027, or even simmerin\u0027, we have got to watch it close. An\u0027 it\u0027s generally on th\u0027 simmer. If you go broke a-visitin\u0027 us, which I hopes you do, you can earn quite some cash. All you got to do is to go over in th\u0027 Snake Buttes country, just west of us, an\u0027 get Nevada for us. We\u0027ll pay five hundred dollars for his body, an\u0027 a hundred apiece for each of his men. I\u0027ve heard tell about th\u0027 Hole in th\u0027 Wall, up north, but I reckon we\u0027ve got its first cousin down here, right next door to us. We have to keep four men on our west section day an\u0027 night. Don\u0027t you never ride out there for fun—we shoots first, an\u0027 then finds out who it was.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nevada!\" mused Johnny, \"who is he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [186] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Some say he\u0027s white, others, a half-breed,\" answered Slim. \"Nobody I ever met knew anythin\u0027 about him, except that he come from Nevada. While I never saw him, I shore heard an\u0027 felt his lead one night; an\u0027 if he can shoot that good in th\u0027 dark, by ear, I ain\u0027t honin\u0027 to meet him for fun an\u0027 excitement in th\u0027 daytime when he can use his eyes. He skinned my ear, put one through my arm, another cut my shoulder, one went through my hat, th\u0027 fourth grazed my side, an\u0027 th\u0027 fifth killed my cayuse. It sounded like a loud r-i-i-i-p! Since then I don\u0027t make no noise at night out there. I imitates a ghost when I move around, an\u0027 I\u0027m on full cock, with a hair trigger, every minute, which is some strain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027d it happen?\" asked Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We was roundin\u0027 up last fall, an\u0027 had a beef herd we was holdin\u0027. Th\u0027 night come on windy an\u0027 rainy, but there wasn\u0027t no lightnin\u0027 or thunder. Four of us was ridin\u0027 th\u0027 middle trick an\u0027 singin\u0027 plenty as we went around. Th\u0027 herd had fed heavy an\u0027 was well watered, an\u0027 tired, an\u0027 we wasn\u0027t worryin\u0027 much about it. Just after midnight we heard a rumble from behind us, an\u0027 th\u0027 whole herd was on its feet like one cow. It was a small bunch of stampeded cattle, an\u0027 when it hit our herd everythin\u0027 went that had hoofs. Th\u0027 cook, back in th\u0027 waggin\u0027, was awake because of a leak over his bed-roll, an\u0027 as soon as he heard th\u0027 rumble he let out a yell an\u0027 woke up th\u0027 off-shifts. They had their cayuses tied to th\u0027 waggin, or staked out close at hand, an\u0027 they forked \u0027em quick. Tom Wilkes saw my six-gun flashes an\u0027 he joins me. We lean against one end of th\u0027 front[187] rank of our bunch, tryin\u0027 to turn \u0027em, an\u0027 get \u0027em to mill; but it wasn\u0027t no use. Th\u0027 herd had split up into bunches, an\u0027 our bunch run for half an hour southwest. When we finally got \u0027em millin\u0027, an\u0027 then busted that up, they figgered they had all th\u0027 runnin\u0027 they wanted an\u0027 behaved themselves. I rode back to take th\u0027 rear when I heard what sounded like another bunch runnin\u0027 west, quite a ways north of us. I sung out to Tom that I\u0027d be back, an\u0027 streaked up to give a hand with th\u0027 other herd. When I got to it I rode right up front an\u0027 sung out that I was givin\u0027 a hand. My mouth wasn\u0027t hardly shut before I got in th\u0027 way of that stream of lead I told you about I got my gun workin\u0027, but I was afoot an\u0027 had to hear th\u0027 herd leave me behind. Managin\u0027 to get my saddle off, I hoofed it for th\u0027 cook\u0027s fire, which was blazin\u0027 high when I got to where I could see it. By th\u0027 time I got there th\u0027 rain was comin\u0027 down in sheets, an\u0027 I was done up. They got away with over forty head, as near as we could figger it, an\u0027 th\u0027 rain had smoothed them sandy valleys over in th\u0027 Buttes so they didn\u0027t show a print. We wouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 follered far, anyhow—Nevada likes ambushes, an\u0027 that country was made for \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been through it,\" growled Johnny. \"There\u0027s th\u0027 fourth muley I\u0027ve seen in ten minutes,\" he said, nodding to the right. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was made a muley by a saw,\" replied Slim. \"That feller was a bloody-minded terror. He\u0027s cost this ranch a dozen times what he was ever worth. We don\u0027t know what was th\u0027 matter with him—just born savage, I reckon. He killed an\u0027 ruined a lot of young[188] steers before we got onto him. At first we was goin\u0027 to kill him; then we said he had been so all-fired mean that he ought to be punished. So we sawed off his horns an\u0027 turned him loose to play with th\u0027 rest of th\u0027 long-horns. He got some good lickin\u0027s before he learned that he wasn\u0027t dangerous no more. He got mauled so much before he quit his mean ways that we sort of felt sorry for him. Here comes Quantrell. He\u0027s our segundo, an\u0027 boss of our trail outfit. Good man, all around. Hey! Look at that old reprobate go for him! What do you think of that? Cimarron was th\u0027 man who sawed off his horns, an\u0027 cussed if he don\u0027t remember it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The approaching rider evaded the charge, fired close to the steer\u0027s nose as the animal went past, which turned its chain of thought, and rode up laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you see th\u0027 old boy?\" he chuckled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Reg\u0027lar friend of yourn,\" laughed Slim. \"Here, shake han\u0027s with Nelson. He\u0027s comin\u0027 out to show us how to play draw—an\u0027 his pockets are full of money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re welcome,\" said Cimarron, grinning, his hand-clasp solid and sincere. \"Better put yore rope on him, Slim, in case he gets scared off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Laughing and chatting they rode westward until about mid-afternoon when, hungry as wolves, they arrived at the bunkhouse, where Cimarron dared the sanctity of the cook shack to rustle warm, if rather dried-out food, from the back of the stove; and they ate to the frank and personal comments of several loafing onlookers. The rest of the afternoon was passed in discussions and reminiscences of things concerning[189] range activities and in telling stories about men they had known. It was not long before other men began to come in from the range and the cook showed signs of activity. When he was ready he let out a yell: \"Are you all a-comin\u0027?\" They were, and ate hungrily, for the most part in silence, listening to the three who had enjoyed a late dinner and who could take time to talk. Four men soon arose and exchanged banter as they looked to tobacco, guns, and other things requiring their attention and, saying good-by, went out to the corral. They had the first night shift on the west section and soon were riding away. Hardly two hours later another four-man group came in, fell upon the second meal the cook had prepared in less than three hours, and then loafed, joining in the conversation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027s things over Gunsight way?\" Cimarron asked Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just th\u0027 same, I reckon,\" came the answer. \"Everything is all right, a cussed sight better than they are further east. It\u0027s a shame, too; a cussed shame.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Meanin\u0027?\" queried Lin Sherwood, the foreman, a tall, wiry man of about forty years, whose broad, sloping shoulders suggested great strength. His face was frank and kindly, and his steel-blue eyes twinkled from their frames of wrinkles in a manner to win Johnny the moment he had looked into them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m meanin\u0027 that old man with th\u0027 busted laig, over on th SV,\" answered Johnny; \"an\u0027 that kid, an\u0027 that helpless girl. Do you know they ain\u0027t had no round-up in three years, neither calf nor beef?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" exclaimed Cimarron in surprise.[190] \"That ain\u0027t no way to run a ranch. Ain\u0027t they done no brandin\u0027 at all?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t had an iron hot in three years,\" replied Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s th\u0027 matter with \u0027em?\" demanded Matt Webb. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They can\u0027t keep an outfit,\" answered Johnny. \"Every time they hired a man he was either scared off or bribed to quit. After a while they gave it up. Three of their men are workin\u0027 on th\u0027 Triangle, or th\u0027 Bar H right now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then they didn\u0027t lose a whole lot,\" snorted Art French. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If they don\u0027t round up, how do they know where they are?\" asked Bud Norris. \"How do they know how many cows they got, or if they\u0027re runnin\u0027 at a profit or a loss?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They don\u0027t,\" answered Johnny. \"But there ain\u0027t no round-up necessary to tell \u0027em about profit an\u0027 loss. They can see th\u0027 herds shrinkin\u0027, it\u0027s so plain; an\u0027 when they has to sell off a few head every time they needs chuck, I reckon they know about th\u0027 profit an\u0027 loss. They want to have a round-up just to get a tally of th\u0027 cattle now on th\u0027 ranch. Knowing how many there was from th\u0027 tally th\u0027 year they took possession, they could tell what their losses are. But how can they hold one, without punchers?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They ought to know,\" said Slim. \"But that wouldn\u0027t help \u0027em much, at that. It would only make \u0027em feel worse, I reckon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Their herds ain\u0027t got no business to shrink, not on[191] a range like theirs,\" said Bud. \"If they ain\u0027t throwed many on th\u0027 trail they ought to have more now than they had three years ago. Cattle don\u0027t stop multiplyin\u0027 just because they ain\u0027t rounded up once in a while!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby their cattle are different, then,\" said Johnny. \"An\u0027 there\u0027s one thing shore: I never saw so few mavericks on any ranch as there are on th\u0027 SV; nor so d—d many as I saw on th\u0027 Bar H. Why, when I was on th\u0027 Bar-20, down in th\u0027 Pecos Valley, we wouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 let no ranch close to us hold so many unbranded cows.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where did you say?\" quickly demanded Bill Dusenberry, who answered to the name of \"Deuce.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bar-20,\" replied Johnny, \"down in th\u0027 Pecos.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you ever hear of Lacey?\" excitedly asked Deuce. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lacey? Why, he run a saloon, over in Perry\u0027s Bend; an\u0027 he was a white man clean through.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Holy mackerel!\" cried Deuce. \"Was you one of Peter\u0027s outfit?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was near since I was old enough to throw a rope,\" answered Johnny, a pleased grin coming to his face. \"Did you know Lacey, or Buck?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lacey is my cousin,\" exclaimed Deuce. He turned to his friends. \"We ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to have no poker tonight. This feller is goin\u0027 to entertain us with th\u0027 doin\u0027s of th\u0027 cussedest he-man outfit that ever lived under one roof. Lacey has told me just enough to get me on th\u0027 prod—an\u0027 here\u0027s a man who was one of that outfit. You can begin with that cow-skinner you fellers went to Perry\u0027s Bend after. I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you that if you[192] can show as that you belonged to that hair-trigger outfit there ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 Bill Dusenberry an\u0027 his friends won\u0027t do for you. What was that cow-skinner\u0027s name, an\u0027 where did he die?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad to meet a relative of Lacey\u0027s,\" replied Johnny, smiling. \"Lacey turned a buffalo gun loose on that gang of rustlers when they had me in Jackson\u0027s store after they had killed Edwards. As to Jerry Brown, he died in some sort of a church, or mission, or somethin\u0027 like that. He shot me in Harlan\u0027s saloon, shootin\u0027 through his coat pocket, th\u0027 skunk. Speakin\u0027 of mavericks, you fellers all know that if th\u0027 natural increase ain\u0027t branded yo\u0027re goin\u0027 to have a fine crop of unbranded cattle; an\u0027 if there ain\u0027t no calves branded for three years, yo\u0027re shore goin\u0027 to have one slashin\u0027 big herd of mavericks. Now, if them mavericks wander off th\u0027 ranch there ain\u0027t no tellin\u0027 what\u0027ll happen to \u0027em. An\u0027 if they ain\u0027t allowed to git back again, or ain\u0027t kept off some other ranch, somebody\u0027s goin\u0027 to have a fine lot of cattle that can be marked with any brand they feels like puttin\u0027 on \u0027em. They won\u0027t even have to be vent branded: they can be sold, an\u0027 th\u0027 first an\u0027 only brand they start with can be th\u0027 sign of th\u0027 man that buys \u0027em. With a road brand to take \u0027em over th\u0027 trail, there ain\u0027t nobody can question \u0027em, is there? At least not down in this country, where there ain\u0027t no laws to question \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re right!\" exclaimed Slim, his eyes glowing with a sudden inspiration. \"Where have our brains been all this time? Reckon we was too busy out on our west line to do much thinkin\u0027 about other things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [193] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, an\u0027 none of \u0027em will be much more than three years old,\" said Cimarron, looking around the room, where various expressions met his eye. \"A plumb fine lot of unbranded cattle, runnin\u0027 up to three-year-olds, ready for any iron. I\u0027ve been as dumb as a locoed dogie!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lin,\" said Gus Thompson, turning to the foreman, \"I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you that when folks get th\u0027 maverick habit, an\u0027 ain\u0027t bothered, they get so, after a while, that they don\u0027t care a whole lot where them mavericks come from; an\u0027 you know that there are some parts of our ranch that are plumb heavy with scrub timber, brush, an\u0027 rough ground.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell us about Perry\u0027s Bend,\" impatiently demanded Deuce. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell us about yore gran\u0027mother\u0027s cat!\" snorted Bill Sage. \"That can wait: Nelson\u0027s goin\u0027 to stay here a couple of nights, anyhow.\" He looked around. \"I\u0027m beginnin\u0027 to see through th\u0027 holes in th\u0027 ladder; an\u0027 I\u0027m honin\u0027 to listen to why th\u0027 SV don\u0027t show no mavericks, when it ain\u0027t had a spring round-up for three years. Does it sleeper?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not an earnotch,\" interjected Tom Wilkes. \"You ought to know that, you flathead; you\u0027ve seen enough SV cattle, anyhow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby Nelson can explain it,\" suggested the foreman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m willin\u0027 to talk it over, anyhow,\" said Johnny. \"In th\u0027 first place, there\u0027s natural enemies.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you can leave \u0027em in th\u0027 first place,\" laughed Slim. \"There ain\u0027t none, that I knows of, down here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [194] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then, there\u0027s them quicksands,\" continued Johnny, gravely. \"Cattle are plumb fascinated by quicksands——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Huh!\" snorted Cimarron, \"you ain\u0027t figgerin\u0027 them sands are takin\u0027 th\u0027 increase of three whole years, are you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Or pickin\u0027 mavericks, as a choice?\" grunted Matt Webb. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027d be so full of bones if they got three years\u0027 calves,\" said Bud, \"that you could build a shack on \u0027em, an\u0027 never feel a quiver.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then, there\u0027s th\u0027 freezin\u0027 cold an\u0027 th\u0027 ice on th\u0027 grass,\" suggested Johnny, grinning. \"We all know that cattle ain\u0027t got sense enough to paw through ice to get at th\u0027 grass under it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shore!\" snorted Slim. \"Did we have a freeze-up last winter?\" he asked the crowd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not so no cows was killed,\" replied Cimarron. \"An\u0027 I didn\u0027t see no driftin\u0027 herds at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s th\u0027 matter with you fellers?\" indignantly demanded Johnny. \"Here I\u0027m tryin\u0027 to explain a mystery, an\u0027 you keep pullin\u0027 me out of th\u0027 saddle as fast as I climb up. That ain\u0027t fair. Then how about this one: Th\u0027 SV wasn\u0027t no good for winter range, bein\u0027 all et off?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re down again,\" laughed Art French. \"Th\u0027 SV is good winter range, an\u0027 summer, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 spring an\u0027 fall, an\u0027 th\u0027 Fourth of July, as well as Christmas,\" supplemented Bud. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You fellers are shore ornery,\" complained Johnny. \"Then mebby th\u0027 mavericks, bein\u0027 different than marked[195] animals, all got th\u0027 travel itch an\u0027 left that arid valley for th\u0027 thick, green grass down south of \u0027em, or for th\u0027 juicy scrub an\u0027 clean rocks north of \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Arid valley\u0027 is purty near as good as \u0027thick, green grass south of \u0027em,\u0027\" chuckled Cimarron. \"Was you ever over on that luxuriant south range?\" he asked, ironically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t, but Ol\u0027 Buffalo was,\" answered Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shore, but he don\u0027t eat grass,\" retorted Cimarron; \"an\u0027 what\u0027s more, he don\u0027t stop on it at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll try once more,\" said Johnny, in simulated desperation. \"Mebby cow-hawks flew away with \u0027em seein\u0027 that there wasn\u0027t no brands to prove nothin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After the laughter quieted down, Cimarron jammed his fist into an open palm with a resounding smash. \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 we got more interest in th\u0027 way them SV cows are handled than we ever thought. I\u0027m gettin\u0027 interested in seein\u0027 that th\u0027 SV runs itself some better than it has. There\u0027s ideas millin\u0027 around in my head that some folks might say are scandalous an\u0027 unpolite. You all heard me—lemme hear somethin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 I\u0027m wantin\u0027 to know,\" said Johnny, \"what kind of barb wire is sold down in these parts?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mean, cussed mean,\" replied Slim. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then mebby that\u0027s why it won\u0027t stay up,\" muttered Johnny. \"It keeps a-comin\u0027 down from off them posts around th\u0027 quicksands, pullin\u0027 out double staples, an\u0027 draggin\u0027 itself all over th\u0027 valley. A couple of them posts set fire to themselves, too, an\u0027 burned till they busted themselves off, close to th\u0027 ground. I\u0027m shore doin\u0027 a lot of guessin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [196] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lacey told me—\" began Deuce. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"—to rope yourself,\" interrupted Cimarron. \"We got lots of time, later, to hear about what Lacey told you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe in bein\u0027 neighborly,\" said Matt, \"an\u0027 givin\u0027 folks a hand when they deserve it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is th\u0027 Doc a friend of you fellers?\" asked Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We ain\u0027t weepin\u0027 none over his kidnappin\u0027, if that\u0027s what you mean,\" chuckled Matt. \"He mebby will be kidnapped ag\u0027in, sometime—an\u0027 hoof it back home. Why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I didn\u0027t want to hurt you fellers\u0027 feelin\u0027s,\" replied Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you mean?\" asked Cimarron. \"You\u0027ll have to be plumb rough to hurt any feelin\u0027s out here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Matt was sayin\u0027 he believes in bein\u0027 neighborly,\" explained Johnny, \"an\u0027 I happened to think of somethin\u0027 about th\u0027 Doc, what stirred me a-plenty. That\u0027s why I asked.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What was that?\" asked Slim. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, that Arnold girl was took sick about a year ago, an\u0027 they sent for th\u0027 Doc. He said he would doctor cows an\u0027 hosses, but he wouldn\u0027t sling a laig across a saddle if th\u0027 whole SV was dyin\u0027, an\u0027 be refused to go. That kid had to ride to Highbank for that drunken doctor down there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Th\u0027 h—l you say!\" snapped Thompson. \"Is that right?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is,\" answered Johnny. \"An\u0027 it made me wonder what kind of country I\u0027d got into. I maintains that no doctor like that measures up to th\u0027 standards of[197] cow-country men; an\u0027 when th\u0027 old man busted his laig I says it was plumb proper that th\u0027 coyote was kidnapped an\u0027 made to do his plain duty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m admirin\u0027 that kidnappin\u0027 more every day,\" exclaimed Slim. \"Th\u0027 dog wouldn\u0027t have to be kidnapped if he was needed on th\u0027 Bar H.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Huh!\" snorted Cimarron. \"If Big Tom had a sore toe th\u0027 Doc would bust his neck an\u0027 kill a hoss gettin\u0027 there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will somebody tell me what\u0027s th\u0027 matter with that coyote?\" asked Larry Hallock. \"One day he\u0027s as bright as a new dollar an\u0027 witty as blazes; th\u0027 next, he looks like somebody had dragged him by th\u0027 heels through th\u0027 hottest parts of h—l. Talk about quick changes! He\u0027s a wonder. What\u0027s he drinkin\u0027, anyhow?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I reckon it ain\u0027t drink,\" said the foreman, reflectively. \"I once knowed a gambler, up in Dodge, that could play longer than anybody in town—hours longer—but when he went to pieces he shore hit hard. An\u0027 he\u0027d rather lie than tell th\u0027 truth. However, th\u0027 devil with th\u0027 Doc; I\u0027m wonderin\u0027 about somethin\u0027 else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lacey knowed a man like that,\" said Deuce, but got no further, for Cimarron balanced a gun in his hand and seemed to be considering. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m itchin\u0027 for to shoot Lacey,\" Cimarron remarked, \"but as he ain\u0027t on hand any of his tribe will do. You shut up about Lacey till th\u0027 time\u0027s ripe to talk about him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027d look too set, too plain, an\u0027 sort of hintin\u0027,\" soliloquized the foreman, \"to send a Double X bunch[198] over there. If we could make it universal, sort of free-for-all, with other\u0027s joinin\u0027 in, it would be better. It would look like a surprise party an\u0027 not point too strong in one direction. They should have a round-up an\u0027 get a tally. Even a little iron heatin\u0027 wouldn\u0027t be out of place, as long as it was done by them as didn\u0027t belong to th\u0027 SV. Nobody could hardly blame th\u0027 SV for brandin\u0027 mavericks, an\u0027 say they was stealin\u0027 cows that didn\u0027t belong to \u0027em, if punchers from other ranches did th\u0027 brandin\u0027. How many men do you reckon we\u0027d need, Nelson?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"More than you could spare if you kept a good watch on that west section,\" answered Johnny, seeing the drift of the foreman\u0027s thoughts. \"Quite some few more. An\u0027 you got to count me out of it, \u0027though I\u0027d be glad to stay here an\u0027 take some man\u0027s place while he\u0027s gone. I don\u0027t aim to be hobbled in th\u0027 future by comin\u0027 out strong an\u0027 plain. That may sound funny, but I got things to answer for if they\u0027re found out an\u0027 laid to me—which I ain\u0027t aimin\u0027 to have found out, positive. It ain\u0027t that I\u0027m gun-shy, or tryin\u0027 to slip out of trouble, but I just ain\u0027t ready to smoke up, right now. It\u0027s shore a puzzle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arch Wiggins slapped his thigh with stinging emphasis. \"I\u0027m seein\u0027 th\u0027 drift of this here conversation, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t declarin\u0027 myself in because th\u0027 wool is bein\u0027 pulled over my eyes, at all; but I am declarin\u0027 myself in, clean up to my hat, because I\u0027m a cowman, through an\u0027 through, first an\u0027 last; an\u0027 because I\u0027m a human bein\u0027. If any round-up gang needs a first-class hoss wrangler for a few days or a week, without pay, an\u0027 willin\u0027 to[199] feed hisself, I\u0027m speakin\u0027 for th\u0027 job. An\u0027 I ain\u0027t too lazy to keep irons hot, neither. Do I hear anythin\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jim Hallock leaped to his feet. \"I come down here to visit, an\u0027 get a rest,\" he declared, grinning. \"I\u0027ve had all th\u0027 visitin\u0027 I wants with a bunch of cold-deckers; an\u0027 I ain\u0027t had no rest since I arrove. My fingers ache from dealin\u0027 an\u0027 cuttin\u0027 an\u0027 drawin\u0027; an\u0027 I can see deuces an\u0027 treys in my sleep, when I get any. Speakin\u0027 for myself, I\u0027d enjoy seein\u0027 that lazy Wiggins wranglin\u0027 cayuses for me every mornin\u0027 before sunup. I\u0027ll do my cussedest to wear him to a frazzle. How about you, boys?\" he asked, turning to his brothers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t got no love for Arch Wiggins,\" announced Wood, \"but I\u0027m swallerin\u0027 my pride. If he wants an assistant wrangler that knows more about th\u0027 job than he ever will, I\u0027m ready to take orders, an\u0027 sacrifice my independence an\u0027 self-respect.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where you find one Hallock,\" chuckled George, \"you finds more. We was brought up like that. I can use an iron with any man on th\u0027 range, no matter who says I\u0027m lyin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Larry burst out laughing. \"I never let my cub brothers put on no airs,\" he declared; \"an\u0027 some older member of th\u0027 family ought to go along to keep \u0027em from gettin\u0027 into trouble. I\u0027m signin\u0027 this pay-yorseself-pay-roll, with Lin\u0027s permission.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t give no permission to anybody in my outfit to brand mavericks, or run another man\u0027s ranch for him,\" said Sherwood, \"but I reckon I can give some of you boys a few days off, in case you want to go fishin\u0027 over in Green Valley, or chase them cow-hawks Nelson[200] was tellin\u0027 about. Do you chase \u0027en, or trap \u0027em, Nelson?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You put a hunk of maverick meat on th\u0027 end of a rope, an\u0027 tie knots in it,\" said Johnny. \"Th\u0027 cow-hawk swallers th\u0027 whole thing, an\u0027 th\u0027 knots get caught in his innards. Then you shoot him through th\u0027 epizootic with a hunk of lead. Didn\u0027t you ever go huntin\u0027 \u0027em?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, but I\u0027ve heard all about it,\" replied Sherwood, apologetically. \"Now, lemme see: some of you fellers have got to stay here. There\u0027s twelve, not countin\u0027 me, which nobody ever does, anyhow. Twelve, thanks to them Snake Buttes coyotes, on a ranch that shouldn\u0027t have more\u0027n eight. Well, after all, sizin\u0027 up th\u0027 twelve an\u0027 lumpin\u0027 \u0027em, an\u0027 dividin\u0027 it by one real, shore-enough puncher, they only come to eight, after all. I figger I can do without four of th\u0027 laziest—five, if Nelson stays to show somebody how his job ought to be done. Now, that makes nine goin \u0027to Gunsight to spend their time an\u0027 money. Somebody ought to remember about a cook, for I\u0027m sayin\u0027 right out loud an\u0027 flat, that our cook ain\u0027t gettin\u0027 no time off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t make me sore,\" chuckled Lem Curtis, culinary artist of the ranch. \"It\u0027d only be out of th\u0027 fryin\u0027 pan an\u0027 into th\u0027 fire for me. Thanks, Lin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can cook good enough for any bow-laigged coyote that ever set foot on this ranch,\" declared Art French. \"An\u0027 besides, I got some scores to settle up. I\u0027ll cook.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Sherwood, \"I promised Cimarron sometime ago that he could have a few days off, to rest up from them poker parties. He\u0027s a good foreman an\u0027[201] round-up boss, only he ought to do some work hisself. But I\u0027m bettin\u0027 our wrangler ain\u0027t got enough saddle stock within a day\u0027s ride to give you fellers a remuda apiece—say about five to a man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you wasn\u0027t th\u0027 foreman an\u0027 keeper of th\u0027 pay-roll,\" retorted Rich Morgan, \"I\u0027d say you was a cross-eyed fabricator. Cuss yore nerve! I\u0027m th\u0027 best hoss wrangler, barrin\u0027 Arch, of course, that ever took a cussin\u0027 from a fool outfit. What th\u0027 devil is a little matter like a herd of forty-five saddle hosses to a man like me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The foreman leaned back and laughed contentedly. \"You would think we was wantin\u0027 \u0027em to go to a dance,\" he said to Johnny, his eyes twinkling, \"instead of goin\u0027 out of their way to do some hard work. I\u0027m bettin\u0027 th\u0027 SV has a proper round-up. Who\u0027s goin\u0027 to be tally man?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That takes a good man away from work, when anybody can count knots or make a pencil mark,\" growled Cimarron. \"We ought to have somebody that can\u0027t do nothin\u0027 else like that Two-Spot over in Gunsight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s th\u0027 tally man!\" shouted Arch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s ourn, if we has to do some kidnappin\u0027 ourselves,\" exulted Larry. \"We won\u0027t let him have a smell of liquor till we drop him off at Gunsight on th\u0027 way back. An\u0027 then we\u0027ll pickle him so he\u0027ll keep for a week.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He won\u0027t do,\" asserted Slim. \"He can\u0027t keep a tally straight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sayin\u0027 he can,\" contradicted Johnny, smiling.[202] \"Seems to me I\u0027ve seen him do little things that showed me he was a-punchin\u0027 once—an\u0027 punchin\u0027 for a long time. I\u0027ll bet he can keep tally as good as any man in this outfit, an\u0027 count \u0027em as they pass, too. Mebby he wouldn\u0027t suit a buyer, or a seller, but he\u0027s good enough for me. Anyhow, you can call th\u0027 figgers when yo\u0027re countin\u0027 herd. There won\u0027t be a new brand get away from him if you let him alone. It\u0027s time he was put to work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby he won\u0027t work on th\u0027 SV?\" suggested Arch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Th\u0027 Doc didn\u0027t want to, neither, did he?\" demanded Slim; \"but he did. What\u0027s th\u0027 use of kidnappin\u0027 anybody that wants to be took? He\u0027ll work, all right—or he won\u0027t eat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey,\" said Cimarron, turning to Johnny. \"We got a lot of gall runnin\u0027 a round-up on another man\u0027s ranch. What\u0027ll we say to \u0027em? We got to say somethin\u0027!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell \u0027em it\u0027s a neighborly act,\" replied Johnny. \"Say you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 done it before if you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 knowed about things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They got any wire?\" asked Wood. \"I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to run a fence around them posts that\u0027ll make some thief cuss some dark an\u0027 stormy night, as th\u0027 books say. Staplin\u0027 is fine, but takin\u0027 a couple of turns around th\u0027 posts an\u0027 staplin all around is better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I reckon so,\" answered Johnny. \"If they ain\u0027t tell Dailey to give you a spool an\u0027 charge it to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not bein\u0027 in on this personal I\u0027ll pervide a spool,\" offered the foreman. \"I\u0027d like to see this crew at work over there—a man allus works harder for somebody[203] as a favor than he does for th\u0027 man that pays him. It would give me a line on how hard I could crowd you fellers. Wood, if you throw about three half-hitches over them posts before you staple \u0027em, you\u0027ll bother anybody that tries to unwind it from a hoss. Try it, an\u0027 see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re talkin\u0027 gospel,\" said Wood, grinning. \"It\u0027ll just wind up th\u0027 other way, an\u0027 before he knows what he\u0027s doin\u0027 he\u0027ll have one plumb, fine job on his hands.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll give two bits, purty near,\" chuckled the foreman, \"to see some faces in this country when th\u0027 news gets out about this here high-speed round-up. But I don\u0027t reckon there\u0027ll be no trouble about it. I\u0027m sayin\u0027, however, if you\u0027ll listen to me, don\u0027t nobody start none. Yo\u0027re job is takin\u0027 care of SV cows, an\u0027 not gun-fightin\u0027, \u0027though I know there ain\u0027t no danger of anybody chasin\u0027 you off th\u0027 range.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There won\u0027t be no trouble, Lin,\" assured Cimarron, \"not if I has to shoot up th\u0027 whole blasted country. An\u0027 I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to have some of them Triangle riders join hands with us: we\u0027re roundin\u0027 up wide an\u0027 regardless, an\u0027 it stands to reason that we\u0027ll have to cross their boundary line. But we\u0027ll be polite an\u0027 fair; we\u0027ll tell \u0027em three times, smiling. After that it\u0027ll be their own, bullheaded fault.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s one man on th\u0027 Triangle I hope is hard of hearin\u0027,\" chuckled Tom Wilkes; \"that\u0027s Gurley. Can I ask him, Cimarron?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll stay right here,\" replied the segundo. \"We\u0027ll have trouble enough, mebby, takin\u0027 things as they come, without luggin\u0027 along no canned grudges.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [204] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You watch me stay here!\" retorted Wilkes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do that very thing,\" chuckled the foreman. \"Yo\u0027re goin\u0027 to show Nelson over our west range tomorrow night, an\u0027 cover more ground out there on account of there bein\u0027 fewer of you. Nelson,\" he said, turning, \"have you any choice of men for this here party that\u0027s goin\u0027 to celebrate their freedom over in Gunsight?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t sayin\u0027 a word—not one word.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, then,\" continued the foreman. \"Now, boys, them that are goin\u0027 to have a few days off are: Cimarron, Larry, Art, Slim, an\u0027 Bud. I ain\u0027t lendin\u0027 no cayuses, wire, or no chuck waggin, for they ain\u0027t needed goin\u0027 to Gunsight on a spree; but, I\u0027m sayin\u0027 that I don\u0027t expect to go in th\u0027 storeroom, nor th\u0027 waggin shed, nor have no time to bother about my hoss wrangler\u0027s job. If he wants to keep a lot of saddle hosses away off somewhere where they can\u0027t be seen, that\u0027s his business. He\u0027s doin\u0027 th\u0027 wranglin\u0027 for this ranch, an\u0027 nobody else is. An\u0027,\" he grinned, turning toward the cook, \"Lem here, has a pore mem\u0027ry an\u0027 never would miss no pots an\u0027 pans.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I has; likewise I\u0027m blind,\" said Lem. \"But lemme make a prophecy: If there are any cookin\u0027 utensils that gets misplaced an\u0027 can\u0027t be found for near a week, an\u0027 they ain\u0027t as clean when they\u0027re found again as they was when they got lost, there\u0027ll be some h—l-roarin\u0027, excitin\u0027 times on this here packet. You all hear me chirp?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, then, Nelson,\" said Deuce, \"tell us about Lacey an\u0027—\" he broke off his request as he dodged[205] Cimarron\u0027s boot, for the segundo was a man of set ideas, and he was going to turn in. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I hears any more about that cousin of yourn, tonight,\" quoth Cimarron, pulling off the second boot and balancing it, \"there is goin\u0027 to be weepin\u0027 in th\u0027 Deusenberry family. I\u0027m turnin\u0027 in, an\u0027 I only turns in when I want to go to sleep. I got plenty of work ahead of me for a few days. An\u0027 I\u0027m sayin\u0027, further, that if there\u0027s any poker playin\u0027 tonight, it\u0027s goin\u0027 to be held in th\u0027 kitchen, an\u0027 played by a lot of dumb men.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 if I ketches any poker parties in my kitchen,\" announced Lem, arising and flexing his muscles, \"I\u0027ll heave \u0027em out again. I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to clean up after no pack of bums. You hear me real plain?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Couple of grouches,\" growled Slim, looking around. \"Get th\u0027 cards an\u0027 beans, Tom. We\u0027ll pull th\u0027 waggin out of th\u0027 shed, an\u0027 play in there, out of th\u0027 wind. Somebody else get th\u0027 lanterns.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 what are you goin\u0027 to get?\" demanded Rich, pausing as he started to take a lantern down from its peg. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to say nothin\u0027 about that,\" answered Slim, grinning; \"but as long as you asked, I\u0027ll tell you. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to get th\u0027 money. Come on, Nelson; we\u0027ll move th\u0027 waggin for them suckers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mind lookin\u0027 like a sucker,\" retorted Rich, getting the other lantern, \"as long as I don\u0027t play like one. Who\u0027ll buy Slim\u0027s watch from me tomorrow?\" he asked from the doorway. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re blockin\u0027 th\u0027 door, an\u0027 talkin\u0027 foolish,\" said Thompson, shoving him aside. \"Anybody wants that[206] watch\u0027ll have to come an\u0027 see me. Don\u0027t forget them beans,\" he called over his shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He ain\u0027t got time to get \u0027em,\" muttered Tom, \"but he\u0027ll have to wait for me, if I get \u0027em. Can you figger him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56736.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
