{"id":18896,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII WHOM THE GODS WOULD DESTROY","content":"In Gunsight, Dailey rubbed his eyes and cursed the slowness of his breakfast fire, and then padded in his stocking feet to the window and looked out in time to see a black horse go past with a reach and swinging smoothness which brought an appreciative glow into his blinking eyes. The rider sat his saddle with a supple grace and erectness which harmonized with the beautiful leg action of his mount. \"He ain\u0027t stoppin\u0027,\" muttered Dailey. \"Must \u0027a\u0027 been up to Juniper. I\u0027m sayin\u0027 again that if that pack of coyotes lets him start ahead of \u0027em out of rifle range, there ain\u0027t nobody from down here as will ever get close enough to see him again. There\u0027s mebby purtier things on earth than a hoss like that, but I\u0027m admittin\u0027 I never saw \u0027em. Cuss that fire—it\u0027s smokin\u0027 again!\" The Doc heard the rhythmic beat pass his shack, muttered drowsily, and turned over to go to sleep again. \"Hope it\u0027s that Smitty, blast him!\" and his snores grew steadily louder. Leaving the Double X quite some time before daylight. Pepper had been sent over the upper trail, which joined the Juniper trail north of town. Now she spurned the Highbank-Gunsight road beneath her flying hoofs with an eagerness and power that belittled the twenty-five miles she already had put behind her. [232] Johnny stroked the satin skin under which the powerful muscles of her sloping shoulders rippled and bunched, and pride surged through him. \"I used to think Hoppy\u0027s Red Eagle, an\u0027 Red\u0027s Ginger was th\u0027 real thing in hossflesh,\" he told her, \"but they was cows compared to you, Pepper Girl. There ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 on four laigs has any right to look at you—an\u0027 some few on two laigs, too.\" Swinging around the hill where Green Valley met the trail he patted her again. \"There they are, little hoss, ridin\u0027 off to comb th\u0027 range. See that tied-in pinto Slim\u0027s a-ridin\u0027? Show it what runnin\u0027 is—I want to talk to him.\" Slim glanced around, drew rein and had a brief argument with the pinto, which did not like Slim, or his habit of stopping suddenly. \"Changed yore mind?\" he asked, smiling. \"In quite some ways,\" replied Johnny, forthwith explaining the situation in terse sentences. Slim\u0027s mouth opened and forgot to close until his groping mind at last mastered what his ears fed to it, when the mouth opened wider and gave vent to loud, sustaining laughter. Finally subsiding, he demanded the story in detail, but Johnny wheeled around. \"I\u0027m warnin\u0027 you, not amusin\u0027 you, you human rope,\" retorted Johnny. \"If Wolf comes back he\u0027ll mebby come a-shootin\u0027—pass th\u0027 word along.\" Slim shoved his hat well back on his head and jammed his gloved hands against his sides. \"Th\u0027 h—l he will!\" he rejoined. \"Let him, then. He ain\u0027t th\u0027 only man out here as packs a gun; I mebby got one, myself.[233] Havin\u0027 been kindly warned, now I\u0027m all ready to be amused. Tell it slow. If you can\u0027t talk it, sing it. Wait! Here comes Cimarron.\" The round-up boss rode up wearing a grin, in sympathy with Slim\u0027s far-reaching guffaws. \"What\u0027s th\u0027 scandal?\" he demanded. \"Th\u0027 cussedest thing you ever heard,\" laughed Slim, putting his hand on Pepper\u0027s bridle. \"Nelson is in a hurry to go somewhere, but he\u0027s got to give us all of it now that he\u0027s whetted my appetite with th\u0027 mustard.\" \"I want to get to town an\u0027 give Wolf his chance,\" objected Johnny. \"If he\u0027s achin\u0027 to smoke up he\u0027ll come here, won\u0027t he?\" demanded Slim. \"This is th\u0027 place to wait for him—right here.\" \"All of which I admits is interestin\u0027,\" said Cimarron; \"but what is it all about?\" \"Slow now,\" prompted Slim. He looked around. \"Would you listen to that dickey bird up on th\u0027 hill?\" he asked. The dickey bird was Larry Hallock, whose voice barely reached them. \"What do you reckon yo\u0027re doin\u0027?\" demanded Larry, but in far different language. \"Gettin\u0027 married?\" Further inquiries not receiving the attention he felt they were entitled to, he suspected trouble and made haste to get where he could hear about it. \"Hello, Nelson!\" he smiled as he joined them. \"Lookin\u0027 for Two-Spot?\" \"No; where is he?\" demanded Johnny. \"I reckon he\u0027s downin\u0027 liquor in Dave\u0027s about now,\" answered Cimarron. \"He\u0027s been raisin\u0027 th\u0027 devil for[234] a drink which he didn\u0027t get. Slim, th\u0027 fool, owns up that he gave him a dollar last night—an\u0027 when we woke up this mornin\u0027 our tally man had disappeared. But that ain\u0027t tellin\u0027 me what Slim was hee-hawin\u0027 about, or about Wolf.\" \"Slow, an\u0027 deliberate, with everythin\u0027 in,\" chuckled Slim. \"Go ahead.\" Johnny complied, to their hilarious enjoyment, and when the tale was ended, Slim wiped his eyes, pointed out over the range, and said: \"You can stay right here an\u0027 do somethin\u0027 worth while. Not one man in a thousand would come back with that pinned on his shirt tail—an\u0027 I\u0027m sayin\u0027 Wolf ain\u0027t that man. He blames th\u0027 Double X—an\u0027 there\u0027s only twelve of us. He\u0027s shore about four bein\u0027 in town that night, but I ain\u0027t lettin\u0027 my modesty stop me from sayin\u0027 that, barrin\u0027 Cimarron here, he knows that th\u0027 four who was there are th\u0027 best six-gun men on our ranch; an\u0027 that we ain\u0027t takin\u0027 lessons from nobody when it comes to throwin\u0027 lead. He might get one of us, mebby two, an\u0027 I\u0027ll stretch h—l out of that word probability an\u0027 say he might get three; but he won\u0027t get us all, an\u0027 he knows it. But worse than shootin\u0027 it out is what he\u0027ll have to face; an\u0027 he hates ridicule worse than a rattler hates a king snake. You ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to set in Dave\u0027s, takin\u0027 it easy, while we\u0027re sweatin\u0027 out here—I got a nice little place where you\u0027ll fit in an\u0027 stop th\u0027 gaps that Larry is allus leavin\u0027 open.\" \"Gaps!\" snorted Larry, indignantly. \"Trouble is, you drive \u0027em so hard they gets stubborn an\u0027 go on th\u0027 prod. Anybody\u0027d think you never saw a cow before,[235] th\u0027 way you acts. You ought to know you can\u0027t crowd \u0027em too hard.\" Cimarron cogitated. \"If yo\u0027re aimin\u0027 to meet with Wolf, Nelson,\" he said, judicially, \"I reckon you\u0027d do better to stay here. He ain\u0027t got no reason to want anybody in town—nobody there has done anythin\u0027 to him. An\u0027 he knows none of us boys hang out there, except once in a while. What\u0027s more, he ain\u0027t likely to want to face Gunsight till he\u0027s squared up for his kidnappin\u0027. As to him comin\u0027 back, I ain\u0027t nowise shore he won\u0027t. Some fellers are so full of th\u0027 idea of revenge that everythin\u0027 else plays second fiddle when they go on th\u0027 prod. They go fair mad an\u0027 don\u0027t care about nothin\u0027 else. Wolf\u0027s bad—bad as a mad rattler. I figger this is th\u0027 place for you. I\u0027m sayin\u0027 this, too: If Slim had worked that razzle on him I wouldn\u0027t take a hand; but, knowin\u0027 Slim didn\u0027t, if that venomous reptile comes tearin\u0027 around here with his guns cocked, I\u0027ll just nat\u0027rally puncture him at long range with my Remington. I ain\u0027t sympathizin\u0027 with no man that shoots till he knows why he\u0027s doin\u0027 it.\" \"Stay here till this afternoon, anyhow,\" said Slim. \"We\u0027ll be needin\u0027 our tally man before night, an\u0027 you can ride to town, look around, an\u0027 bring Two-Spot back with you. I\u0027m sayin\u0027 Wolf won\u0027t come back—I\u0027m cussed shore I wouldn\u0027t in his place.\" \"Shore,\" endorsed Larry. \"Turn yore cayuse loose an\u0027 get one from Arch—take that bay gelding—he\u0027s near human at this kind of work. Anyhow, he\u0027s got more sense than Slim.\" [236] Dawn in Highbank found a sobered Wolf, unarmed, penniless, and hectic, with a steadily growing rage. He went to place after place in search of a horse, finally borrowing one from a saloon-keeper who knew the foreman of the Bar H. Promising to use the animal only as far as the ranch, and to send it back behind the freight wagon, he threw the saddle on it and then rode around in search of a gun. Knowing about the joke, and feeling the man\u0027s murderous rage, no one would lend him a weapon. He had about decided to leave without one when he chanced to pass the small horse corral and shed behind Pete Wiggins\u0027 hotel, and espied a sodden figure asleep against the palings. Stealing the puncher\u0027s gun he rode away and in a few minutes was cursing the ford, of which a few yards was swimming water. Emerging on the other bank he pushed up the bluff trail at a walk and then, reaching level ground, set off for his ranch at a pace which might have killed a poorer horse. As he rode, his mind became clearer and clearer, and he began to unravel the tangled skein of his abduction. Like his kind who, accustomed to hours of solitude, often talked their thoughts, he did his thinking aloud. \"Double X, says Buffalo. Mebby. First we\u0027ll accuse everybody else in town. Dave?\" he laughed sneeringly at the thought. \"Dailey? Fanning? Jerry? George? Why them? They ain\u0027t th\u0027 kind to stack up ag\u0027in\u0027 such a risk for th\u0027 fun of it; an\u0027 they ain\u0027t none of \u0027em got any other reason. Dailey an\u0027 Fanning was in Dave\u0027s all evenin\u0027—they never left th\u0027 table. Jerry was snoring in his shop when I went around th\u0027 buildin\u0027s,[237] an\u0027 he wouldn\u0027t dare try to kidnap a blind pup. George is another without nerve, an\u0027 he was snorin\u0027 worse than Jerry. Nelson? He was with th\u0027 others. Mebby he did it, but I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 there was more\u0027n one man mixed up in that. If my senses hadn\u0027t been knocked out of me I\u0027d know more about it. We\u0027ll put him aside as a possibility. \"Them Double X coyotes ain\u0027t lovin\u0027 me, \u0027specially since I\u0027ve been ridin\u0027 sign along their line. There was four of \u0027em, an\u0027 they was all primed for a good time; an\u0027 from what I heard \u0027em say about th\u0027 Doc an\u0027 Squint an\u0027 me an\u0027 th\u0027 rest of our outfit, they wasn\u0027t needin\u0027 much urgin\u0027 to tackle a job like that. But they was in Dave\u0027s too; still, they left before I did. \"That leaves my own gang of practical jokers. They knowed that I was in town, but they didn\u0027t know I was goin\u0027 to ride home that night because I didn\u0027t know it myself. They might \u0027a\u0027 done it, but I\u0027ll find that out cussed quick when I get back. \"Who else was there? Dailey, Fanning, Jerry, Dave, Nelson—Two-Spot! He wasn\u0027t in sight at all. Dave was raisin\u0027 th\u0027 roof about him not bein\u0027 around. But h—l! Twenty Two-Spots wouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 tackled a play like that; an\u0027 he couldn\u0027t sling a rope, nor carry a man as heavy as me that distance. Slim can rope—he\u0027s the best down here. I don\u0027t remember much about it till I was put down near th\u0027 waggin; but I\u0027m shore that th\u0027 man that throwed that rope was an expert. \"Two-Spot? I don\u0027t see how he could fit in—cuss him! I got it! Somebody must \u0027a\u0027 seen me movin\u0027 \u0027round or else nobody would \u0027a\u0027 knowed I was in town.[238] None of them fellers could \u0027a\u0027 seen me; but Two-Spot could have. Whoever did that job had to be told I was there; an\u0027 I\u0027m sayin\u0027 they was told. That bum hates me; he\u0027ll never forget my kickin\u0027 him off\u0027n th\u0027 tie-rail an\u0027 makin\u0027 him dance th\u0027 tenderfoot\u0027s fandango. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to see Two-Spot after I stop at th\u0027 ranch—an\u0027 if he don\u0027t talk fast and straight, he\u0027ll dance to h—l this time!\" It was not yet noon when Wolf swept up to his bunkhouse and rode in through the door, leaning forward in the saddle to clear the rafters, his gun freezing Big Tom and Dick Carson as stiff as statues. \"Don\u0027t you move till I says so!\" he snarled. \"Who was in town th\u0027 night Buffalo stopped there on his way home? Think quick; an\u0027 talk straight!\" \"What are you doin\u0027? Goin\u0027 loco?\" demanded the foreman. He stopped in his tracks when he saw the look on his puncher\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m askin\u0027 th\u0027 questions!\" snapped Wolf, his rage climbing anew. \"You answer \u0027em, an\u0027 pronto! Who was there that night?\" \"Don\u0027t know; but none of our boys was.\" \"Nobody left here at all that night?\" demanded Wolf. \"Not one.\" \"How do you know? That was near a week ago. How do you know they was all here?\" \"That was th\u0027 first night you went on Nelson\u0027s trail,\" answered the foreman somewhat angrily. \"I told them to stay home, an\u0027 give you plenty of room. They did it.\" [239] \"I reckon they was glad to do it,\" sneered Wolf. \"Coyotes don\u0027t go cougar hunting less\u0027n th\u0027 pack is big.\" \"They might as well stay home as go on a drunk in Highbank,\" retorted Big Tom, coldly. For a moment Wolf was balanced on a narrow edge, but controlled himself because of genuine liking for his foreman. \"Don\u0027t you ever come that close again,\" he said, almost in a whisper. \"Do you know why I went to Highbank? You ought to, for I reckon everybody does by this time,\" he grated. \"I\u0027m listenin\u0027 to you,\" answered Big Tom. \"I don\u0027t know why you went.\" Wolf dismounted, drove the horse out of the house, and paced up and down the long room in a frenzy of energy. \"I was roped off my cayuse ridin\u0027 home that night. I must \u0027a\u0027 fell on my head, for I don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about it till I got to town. When I came to my senses I was bound, blindfolded, an\u0027 gagged, an\u0027 my head was spinnin\u0027 an\u0027 near bustin\u0027 with pain. I was dumped into Buffalo\u0027s wagon, pushed in among a load of hides, an\u0027 staked out so I couldn\u0027t move. All that day I lay there under that tarp, joltin\u0027 over that long trail, near faintin\u0027 with th\u0027 pain of th\u0027 lashin\u0027s an\u0027 th\u0027 gag, swelterin\u0027 in th\u0027 heat an\u0027 stink, sick with th\u0027 pain in my head, parched an\u0027 burnin\u0027 with thirst, ragin\u0027 with my thoughts, mile after mile. There was times I must \u0027a\u0027 lost consciousness; but I can remember a-plenty! \"Down in Highbank I was hauled out by a gang of cacklin\u0027 sage hens who thought it was a joke. If I\u0027d[240] had a gun an\u0027 could \u0027a\u0027 used it, I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 showed \u0027em what kind of a joke it was!\" He flew into a burst of rage which awed his companions, and he nearly wrecked the room before he subsided, his words one quivering stream of profanity. \"An\u0027 what have I got to face?\" he shouted. \"What have I got to live down? I\u0027ll be th\u0027 laughin\u0027 stock of this whole country till I die, an\u0027 after! But I can show \u0027em that it costs somethin\u0027 to make a fool of Wolf Forbes; an\u0027 I will, if I dies for it! I want a six-gun, an\u0027 a rifle, an\u0027 yore pet hoss. I\u0027m ridin\u0027 to town to see th\u0027 one man who can tell me where to start, an\u0027 I\u0027m ridin\u0027 alone.\" \"Think it was Nelson?\" asked Carson. \"Mebby; but I\u0027m not sayin\u0027 till I know,\" snapped Wolf, pacing again. \"I\u0027m askin\u0027 you: Do you figger ropin\u0027 an\u0027 kidnappin\u0027 Wolf Forbes was any one-man job? Is there any man in this country that would tackle that job, alone, for th\u0027 fun of it? Yo\u0027re right. I says not, too. An\u0027 if he didn\u0027t do it for th\u0027 fun of it, would he \u0027a\u0027 dared tackle it, at all? What I mean is, if he did it to get rid of me, wouldn\u0027t he \u0027a\u0027 killed me from that ambush. I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you he\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 figgered it would be a lot safer to shoot me, for there wouldn\u0027t be th\u0027 risk at th\u0027 time, an\u0027 th\u0027 dead shore danger of th\u0027 comeback. One man, alone, would \u0027a\u0027 shot; three or four might \u0027a\u0027 took a chance with th\u0027 rope. I\u0027m ridin\u0027 to town to learn for shore; an\u0027 I\u0027m ridin\u0027 now. Carson, saddle me that hoss, while I get th\u0027 guns I want. Gimme a drink of yore flask, Tom.\" \"You shore you want it?\" \"Gimme a drink. I know what I want.\" [241] In a few minutes he rode north at a dead run, headed for the over-mountain trail, and it was not until he was gone that the foreman realized that he had not told his puncher a word about the events which had taken place during his absence. Wolf crossed the mountain, turned to the left, and went around Gunsight on the west, heading back toward town to approach it on its blind side. He rode up behind the hotel shed, dismounted and crept along it, and as he passed a crack in the warped boards his eye caught a movement, and he stopped to peer through the crack. Two-Spot was crawling out from under the saloon. Arising to his feet, the tramp looked carefully around for signs of any of Cimarron\u0027s outfit who might have come after him, and then slipped through Dave\u0027s rear door. The watcher stiffened, and a sudden thought sent his rage up to the border line of madness. Two-Spot\u0027s mysterious sleeping quarters were no longer a mystery to him. His eyes swept the side of the saloon, and the narrow space between its foundation sills and the ground. This open space ran along three sides of the building and he knew that a man under the floor could see the feet and ankles of anyone who passed along the building. Returning to his horse he mounted and rode off the way he had come, careful to keep the shed between him and Dave\u0027s rear wall. Reaching an arroyo, he dropped into it and followed it until far enough from town, and then, keeping under the cover of hills and brush, he emerged upon the trail and loped along it into Gunsight. Dismounting in front of Dailey\u0027s, he[242] walked swiftly and quietly toward Dave\u0027s, bending low to keep under the two front windows, and paused at the door to listen. \"He! He! He!\" shrilled Two-Spot, warming to the liquor he had taken. \"I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 liked to died when Jerry told about him. I could smell them hides before they turned th\u0027 corner of th\u0027 hotel that night. They was so odorous they near made me sick. An\u0027 if he went into \u0027em a Wolf, I\u0027m sayin\u0027 he come out a Polecat; this range never will forget it. He can\u0027t never live it down—never! An\u0027 Jerry\u0027s tellin\u0027 it all along th\u0027 way, too. I\u0027m wonderin\u0027 if he\u0027ll come back.\" Dailey laughed sarcastically. \"I\u0027m bettin\u0027 he won\u0027t. No man would.\" \"I\u0027m shore I wouldn\u0027t,\" chuckled Fanning. \"I\u0027d ship off to South Americky, pronto—an\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t care what happened to th\u0027 ship while I was on it, neither.\" \"I\u0027ll take three to one he does come back,\" said Dave. \"Is twenty dollars too much?\" asked Dailey. \"Twenty to my seven suits me,\" replied Dave. \"I\u0027ll take th\u0027 same from Jim, too.\" \"Yo\u0027re on,\" chuckled Dailey. \"Me, too,\" replied Fanning. A man slipped through the door, a gun in each hand. \"Dave wins!\" he snarled. \"Keep \u0027em both on th\u0027 bar!\" he snapped at Dave, who forthwith forgot, for the moment, all about the cap-and-ball. The little group in front of the bar stiffened into whatever postures they had been caught in, their eyes on the muzzles of the[243] steady guns. Death hung poised on Wolf\u0027s thumbs like a hawk balanced in the blue, ready to strike. The only sounds in the room were the hushed breathing of four men facing destruction for the slightest slip, the insistent buzzing of a bee cruising across the ceiling and the soft slip! slip! of the gunman\u0027s feet as he slid them forward a few inches at a time. His face was ghastly and working with rage, his power concentrated in his dull, threatening weapons. He jabbed one of them at Two-Spot. \"Step over there, on th\u0027 end!\" he snapped. \"I\u0027ll shoot at th\u0027 first move,\" he warned them all, feeling the hostility which he faced. Three of them were armed and needed only an instant\u0027s carelessness or indecision on his part to prove that their courage was only held in leash by calculating reason. \"Not a move, cuss you!\" he warned, his eyes not for a moment leaving the three armed men. Dailey\u0027s face was tense, but his body had slouched into a relaxation, the danger of which was well known to Wolf. Fanning\u0027s eyes were glinting and his lips were hard and thin, while enmity peered out of his eyes as though it were a living thing. Dave, his face paling after the redness of his first flush of anger, stood as a cat stands in the presence of a foe. Not for a fleeting instant did Wolf dare to take his eyes from this crouched danger. \"You\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 done better if you hadn\u0027t come back,\" said Dave, quietly, but the timbre of his voice sent a chill up Two-Spot\u0027s spine. \"Don\u0027t move yore paws,\" snarled Wolf. \"Two-Spot, come over here, by th\u0027 bar.\" [244] Two-Spot obeyed, sullen and fearful, taking a place which shortened the arc of danger for Wolf. \"Where was you that night?\" demanded the gunman. Two-Spot stared at him and tried to moisten his throat. \"Where was you?\" snapped Wolf, venomously. \"Talk fast!\" \"I don\u0027t remember,\" answered Two-Spot. \"You was in yore hang-out under this floor,\" accused Wolf. \"Did you see me?\" \"It was too dark,\" answered the tramp, flashing an appealing look at Dave, whose face was growing red again. \"Not with th\u0027 light streamin\u0027 out of them side windows! Who did you tell?\" \"I didn\u0027t see you.\" \"Who did you tell? Th\u0027 Double X?\" \"No; it was too dark.\" Warned by a premonition of impending disaster, and feeling that they were unawed, and restrained only by reason, Wolf ordered the three armed men to turn their backs to him, which they did with a slowness which in itself was an insult. He took the guns of Dailey and Fanning and ordered Dave to come out and join them. Dave took time enough to keep his dignity unsmirched. Free from the necessity of keeping a high-tension vigilance, Wolf walked up to Two-Spot and struck him on the face with the heel of his hand. \"Did you tell th\u0027 Double X?\" he demanded. \"D—n you, answer me!\" [245] \"No,\" whispered Two-Spot, and in his bleared eyes there smouldered the sparks of a fire long dormant. \"Did you tell Nelson? Quick!\" Dailey and Fanning hung on the slow answer, for they remembered that little incident with startling clearness. \"No!\" snarled Two-Spot. Wolf kicked him on the shins and, dropping one gun into its sheath, grabbed the skinny throat, gripping it cruelly. \"Who did you tell?\" he growled, shaking his victim, and quivering with rage at such resistance where he had expected to encounter none. Some ghost of a former stalwart courage, shaken awake by desperation and rage, came back to its forsaken habitation and spoke through a mouthpiece for too long a stranger to it. Two-Spot tried to speak and Wolf, a gleam of triumph burning through the madness in his eyes, loosened his grip and stepped back. The voice which answered him was not Two-Spot\u0027s, although it came through his lips. It was level, cold, self-possessed, and biting. \"You ask somebody who\u0027s a-scared of you, you three-card flush. An\u0027 keep yore paws off\u0027n me—they stink of hides an\u0027 maggots.\" The crashing roar sounded like a thunderbolt and the acrid cloud of smoke swept forward and shrouded the falling man. Wolf leaped back, out of it, and stopped the instinctive advance of the horrified and enraged onlookers, who had turned at the shot, his two guns barely sufficient for the task. Dave\u0027s expression took his instant attention and he snapped a warning, venomous as the jet from a copperhead\u0027s fangs: \"Don\u0027t you[246] try it, Green!\" He flashed a look at the other two, and nearly fired in instinctive answer to the malevolent looks in their eyes. \"Anybody that itches to take this up will get their chance: I\u0027ll be back!\" he promised, and retreated swiftly to the door. Shoving his guns forward in a silent, final warning, he slipped from their sight and dashed for his horse, firing several shots behind him past the windows and door. Leaping into the saddle, he wheeled around the store and rode at a dead run for the cover of an arroyo several hundred yards beyond. Dave started toward his bedroom for the rifle hanging on the wall, reconsidered and looked at the huddled heap on the floor. \"We\u0027ll take care of th\u0027 best man first,\" he said, picking up the limp figure and carrying it to the base of the front wall. Getting a blanket, he went back again, and as he stood up he drew a deep breath and faced his companions, a look almost reverent coming to his face and softening the malignancy of its expression. \"He died like a man—I hope I do as good. Let\u0027s liquor.\" The afternoon shadows were beginning to lengthen when the low voices in the saloon ceased to allow the speakers to catch the sounds of a horse coming up the trail. Dave, moving with surprising celerity for one of his build and habits, grabbed a rifle and hastened to the front window, where he peered out cautiously, and then, walking to the bar, he reached over it, stood the[247] weapon behind it, and replied to the unspoken inquiries of his companions. \"It\u0027s Nelson,\" he said, quietly. The hoofbeats ceased abruptly and Johnny\u0027s voice was heard promising the horse some sugar. He entered and strode straight for the bar, nodding cheerily at the three, and then smiled quizzically. \"You shore look glum,\" he remarked, \"glum as a funeral. Come up an\u0027 take somethin\u0027 for it. Well, th\u0027 SV is bein\u0027 cleaned neat an\u0027 proper. Cimarron knows his business, an\u0027 that crew of his is goin\u0027 at full speed. I come in to get Two-Spot. They\u0027re needin\u0027 a tally man, an\u0027 he ought to go through with it. Seen him around, or is he hidin\u0027 out, layin\u0027 low?\" \"He\u0027s layin\u0027 low,\" replied Dave. Johnny looked at him curiously, puzzled by the proprietor\u0027s manner. \"Meanin\u0027?\" \"He\u0027s dead,\" said Dailey, bluntly, staring fixedly at the front wall. Johnny flashed him a glance and looked back at Dave, who nodded significantly at the front of the room. Johnny turned quickly and followed the other\u0027s stare. He straightened and walked slowly to the blanket, drew it back a little and then replaced it with reverent care. Arising to his full height, he turned and looked at them. The silence was oppressive, crowded with potentials. They could feel a tension which fairly crackled, and which made them shrink, guiltless though they were. The erect figure radiated a ferocity which numbed them and caused Fanning to lick his dry lips. Overhead the bee, which had buzzed monotonously for so long a time,[248] increased its buzzing and bounced from point to point, its wings striking the ceiling with a dry whirring not greatly unlike the angry whir of a rattler. From an unrinsed glass on the bar came a buzzing from drunken flies renewing their efforts to escape from it. The measured breathing of four men sounded loud and unnatural, and from Dailey\u0027s forehead rolled a bead of sweat. They stared at the cold, motionless puncher, fascinated by what emanated from him, unable to look away from the glinting eyes which peered out between narrowed lids at each in turn, and back again. Outside a horse pawed restlessly and the intermittent sound of striking metal reminded them of the slow pealing of a bell. A board cracked suddenly as it contracted from the encroachment of a cooling shadow and sent a shiver up their backs. Fanning\u0027s nerves were on edge and seemed about to snap, and his clenching fingers cut into his palms. He suddenly slumped down into his chair. \"It was Wolf!\" he shouted. \"Two-Spot wouldn\u0027t tell!\" The others sat rigid, not heeding the words. Slowly the puncher\u0027s hand went to his sombrero and slowly readjusted it with deliberate care and precision. He turned slowly, and slowly departed, the sound of the diminishing hoofbeats echoing in their brains long after the sound had ceased. The unrinsed glass became quiet, the bee blundered out through an open window, and a great peace, soothing and enfolding, stole over them. Fanning stirred, arose to his feet, and stumbled toward the door. [249] \"Christ!\" he whispered. \"Amen,\" said Dave. \"Death\u0027s flyin\u0027 low.\" The Bar H outfit, loafing near the bunkhouse, were deep in discussion when they heard a horse. Looking up, they saw Johnny Nelson coming toward them at an amble. He nodded gravely and soon stopped near them. Carelessly throwing the reins over Pepper\u0027s head, he lazily swung down, pushed his hat back on his head, and sauntered up to them, stopping when only an arm\u0027s length away, Wolf stirring restlessly and not taking his eyes from the visitor\u0027s face. \"Two-Spot was my friend,\" said Johnny in a matter-of-fact voice. Wolf\u0027s slouching frame shifted slightly and froze. \"He never went heeled,\" continued Johnny\u0027s even, dispassionate voice. The open palm of his right hand struck Wolf\u0027s face with vicious force. There came two roars which sounded almost as one, and Johnny, leaping pantherishly aside out of the rolling smoke, held two guns on the paralyzed group. \"Wolf shot him,\" he explained, backing away behind his ominous guns. He whistled softly, and Pepper, despite the dangling reins, lifted her head high and came to him. Big Tom recovered himself first and took his eyes from the figure sprawled on the ground. He was beginning to believe them. He glanced at Johnny and back to the prostrate figure. It was incredible that a man with Wolf\u0027s courage, and ability with weapons, should shoot down an old, helpless tramp, whose greatest offense[250] could hardly be more than a verbal one, especially against a two-gun killer. Bad as he was, and hardened, the foreman could not stomach such a murder, and, snapping a warning to his companions, who still stared at what had been Wolf Forbes, he looked at Johnny, who was preparing to mount, and he called out in a voice ringing with sincerity: \"Put \u0027em up, Nelson; an\u0027 ride off. I\u0027ll knock th\u0027 man down that pulls a gun!\" Johnny slipped the guns into their sheaths, swung up into the saddle, wheeled, and pushed Pepper at a lope over the trail toward town without a single backward glance. Big Tom watched him for a moment and then wheeled and glanced down at the ground. \"Wolf, huh? All right.\" He turned to the thoughtful group. \"Dig a hole somewhere out on th\u0027 range an\u0027 dump that into it,\" he said contemptuously, and strode toward the ranchhouse.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56739.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
