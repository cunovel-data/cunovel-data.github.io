{"id":18884,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI INFORMATION WANTED","content":"Two-Spot rested on the broom. \"Wonder what happened to Nelson?\" he queried. \"Ain\u0027t seen since you went on th\u0027 prod yesterday.\" Dave held up the glass he was polishing and looked at it. \"What you mean, on th\u0027 prod?\" \"When you chased me, at noon.\" Dave picked up another glass, breathed on it and rubbed it vigorously. \"He stuck his head in th\u0027 door an\u0027 said he was goin\u0027 to Juniper. Ain\u0027t he got back yet?\" \"Don\u0027t know,\" grunted Two-Spot, going to work again. \"Ain\u0027t his hoss back?\" \"Don\u0027t know.\" He listened. \"Mebby this is him, now, comin\u0027 up th\u0027 trail.\" He looked out and shook his head. \"Nope, it\u0027s only that d—d pill-roller from the flats. What\u0027s he comin\u0027 here for? He\u0027s got more liquor in his shack than we\u0027ve got. I don\u0027t like no man that swizzles it secret. As I was sayin\u0027, it ain\u0027t every—why, hello, Doc! What brings you up here so early in th\u0027 mornin\u0027?\" \"My horse,\" grunted the Doc, passing him without a glance. \"Hello, Dave! How are things?\" \"Smoother\u0027n h—l, as th\u0027 old lady said when she slipped on th\u0027 ice. What\u0027ll yours be?\" [60] \"Cigar apiece,\" said the Doc; \"for you an\u0027 me,\" he amended. Two-Spot turned back and resumed his sweeping. \"Dave, I was kidnapped last night,\" said the Doc, bluntly. Waiting for Dave to get his expression part way back to normal, he told the story. Dave\u0027s expression was under control again and bespoke surprise and sympathy, gradually assuming a stern, uncompromising aspect at the thought of such a grave breach of law and order. Two-Spot, after the first shock, did not dare to look around, for his grin was unholy and altogether too sincere for his health, should the victim of the unheard of atrocity see it. Swish! Swish! went the broom; he! he! went his throat, low and in time with the sweeping. Doc finished and hammered the bar with his fist. \"It\u0027s a d—d outrage!\" he declared, with heat. Dave nodded emphatically. \"It shore is! Do you know who did it?\" \"No; if I did I\u0027d be on his trail.\" \"See anythin\u0027 that might identify th\u0027 coyote?\" \"Perhaps; I\u0027ll know more about it before the day is over,\" answered the Doc. \"Big Tom has some of his men out now looking for tracks on the Double X. Those fellows don\u0027t like me very much.\" \"Blast their eyes!\" commented Two-Spot, sweeping with renewed vigor. Doc glanced at him, frowned, and went on. \"Some things lead me to think one way; other things, other ways. It\u0027s complicated by Squint\u0027s disappearance.\" Two-Spot assimulated the second shock with avidity.[61] He was beginning to be glad that he was alive, and his brain was putting two and two together at top speed. His ears fairly ached for more, and he waited for the third. When there were two, there should always be a third, he hopefully assured himself. Dave\u0027s face showed real surprise again and then marched to orders and revealed his sympathy and disapprobation. \"Why, there won\u0027t be nobody safe!\" he exclaimed. \"Do you mean he\u0027s missin\u0027?\" \"He is. Have you seen him since the night they were all here?\" \"No; I ain\u0027t.\" \"Sorrers an\u0027 calamities never come singly,\" said Two-Spot, energetically digging a match stick out of a crack. \"Mebby it was Squint,\" suggested Dave, \"as captured you.\" \"Well, the evidence points that way, but it isn\u0027t reasonable,\" replied the Doc, going to a chair and sitting down. \"Squint wasn\u0027t the sort of a man who would go out of his way to do anyone a favor, especially if it was for someone he did not like; and most especially if it involved a large element of risk. But this man had on Squint\u0027s slicker, rode Squint\u0027s horse and saddle, and even had Squint\u0027s gloves and gun.\" \"He must \u0027a\u0027 et Squint,\" suggested Two-Spot, spitting violently at the thought. \"Shut up, you!\" said Dave, sternly. \"But, Doc, he was shore petrified when he left here; an\u0027 what he had in his person would stay with him for a long time. He allus was economical in his drunks: he made \u0027em[62] last quite a spell. Now, when a man\u0027s full of liquor he\u0027ll likely do anythin\u0027—no tellin\u0027 what.\" \"This man was not drunk,\" asserted the Doc in his best professional manner, \"and he had not been drunk for over a week. His hand was as steady as mine, and he did not make a single false move. I\u0027m sure it was not Squint; Big Tom cannot make up his mind; Wolf Forbes swears it was, but Wolf was no friend of his, as we all know. Some of the boys suggested the Double X, knowing the strong dislike some of that litter has for me. Three of the boys are over there now lookin\u0027 for tracks.\" \"What good will that do \u0027em?\" demanded Dave. \"A man has a right to make tracks on his own ranch, an\u0027 they\u0027re allus ridin\u0027 around over it. But, then, if they found tracks leadin\u0027 from th\u0027 Double X to yore place, or from th\u0027 Juniper trail to th\u0027 Double X, why, then you\u0027d have somethin\u0027.\" \"There are none of the first category,\" replied the Doc, \"and there will be none of the second: I told you that this man rode Squint\u0027s horse, and any tracks on the Juniper trail could have been made while we rode over it together. We can\u0027t find where he got onto the horse, or where he got off of it; but it must have been in the river somewhere. He was a fiend for riding on rock—he knew this country like a book. We\u0027ve tried trailing, but it got us nowhere. So, Dave, I rode up here to ask you a plain question: Who were in here last night between a quarter of nine and, say, a quarter after ten? You may save some innocent person from a lot of trouble.\" [63] \"Well,\" said Dave, pursing his lips. \"Th\u0027 poker gang was here. Two-Spot an\u0027 I was here. Jerry Poole came in to set his watch—that was just at nine-twenty. Nelson poked his head in th\u0027 door about ten minutes after Jerry, wriggled his fingers at me, cuss his impudence, an\u0027 disappeared. Where he went I don\u0027t know. I guess that\u0027s all.\" Two-Spot gripped the broom convulsively and then slowly relaxed. The third shock had arrived. The problems of his sorely taxed brain were jammed by the sudden arrival of more. Never before had he heard Dave deliberately lie; and here the proprietor was lying coolly and perfectly, with trimmings to make it stick. In turn surprise, wonder, and satisfaction swept across his boiled countenance like driven clouds across the coppery sun. He gradually worked closer to the Doc and soon his stroke became longer and harder. When he began trying to sweep a tobacco stain out of the flooring the Doc suddenly leaped from his chair. \"What—the h—l do—you think—you\u0027re doing?\" he coughed. \"Huh?\" said Two-Spot, looking up. \"What do you mean, sweeping like that, over here?\" \"I was only sweepin\u0027 where th\u0027 dirt was,\" answered Two-Spot. The Doc regarded him keenly. \"Oh, is that it? Well, hunt for it somewhere else, or I\u0027ll kick you through the window!\" Two-Spot flared up. \"You got my permission——\" \"Shut up!\" snapped Dave. \"Now, Doc, as I was[64] sayin\u0027—what\u0027n h—l was I sayin\u0027? Well, anyhow, I said it,\" he asserted, belligerently. \"What you aimin\u0027 to do now?\" \"Dance on th\u0027 quicksands, I hope,\" grunted Two-Spot, savagely. Then he listened, and said: \"Here comes Nelson on that fine little hoss.\" Under his breath he muttered, \"I bet he\u0027ll be surprised to find out he was in here at nine-thirty, last night.\" He straightened up. \"Huh! Mebby he won\u0027t. Mebby he fixed it with Dave. Well, if he\u0027s wise, he\u0027ll tip me off next time—I might tell th\u0027 truth, an\u0027 make a lot of trouble, if I didn\u0027t know.\" Johnny walked in. \"Hello, Ol\u0027 Timer!\" he said, jabbing Two-Spot in the ribs. Two-Spot grasped the broom handle firmly. \"Hello, yoreself! An\u0027 you lookout who yo\u0027re punchin\u0027,\" he grinned. \"Squint\u0027s dead,\" he said, mournfully. \"What?\" \"Oh, well; he\u0027s missin\u0027, anyhow,\" amended Two-Spot. \"Missin\u0027 what?\" asked Johnny. \"Missin\u0027 himself!\" \"Then he\u0027s drunker than I thought,\" replied Johnny. \"I never heard of nobody bein\u0027 so far gone in liquor that they missed themselves.\" \"Oh, you go to th\u0027 devil!\" snorted Two-Spot, turning around so he could snicker in safety. Johnny glanced casually at the Doc, walked up to the bar and bought a cigar, which he lit with scrupulous care. \"Meet th\u0027 Doc, Nelson,\" said Dave. [65] Johnny turned. \"Glad to meet you, Doctor. I\u0027ve heard of you, an\u0027 passed yore place.\" \"Saw you,\" replied the Doc, \"and I coveted that black mare.\" \"Nice little cayuse,\" admitted Johnny. \"The Doc was kidnapped,\" said Dave, watching closely. \"That so?\" replied Johnny, politely. \"An\u0027 how old was you, Doctor?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Why, when you was kidnapped,\" Johnny explained. \"I was kidnapped last night,\" replied the Doc. \"You—last night?\" demanded Johnny, incredulously. \"Well, I\u0027m d—d! What did they get?\" \"They got me.\" \"I mean, what did they get that was valuable?\" persisted Johnny. Two-Spot turned away again and missed the floor twice. \"They stole th\u0027 Doc,\" explained Dave. \"They was takin\u0027 him away just about th\u0027 time you looked in at me. They took him over to th\u0027 SV, to set Ol\u0027 Arnold\u0027s busted laig.\" \"What you talkin\u0027 about?\" snorted Johnny, seating himself across from the Doc. \"I never heard of a doctor bein\u0027 kidnapped to set a busted laig. What am I supposed to say? I\u0027ll bite, if it does cost me th\u0027 drinks.\" \"No, Nelson, that\u0027s the truth,\" earnestly asserted the Doc, and he told the story over again. \"You say he was on Squint\u0027s cayuse, wearin\u0027 Squint\u0027s slicker, an\u0027 usin\u0027 Squint\u0027s gun?\" asked Johnny. \"Then[66] where was Squint? A man don\u0027t just drop things like that without knowin\u0027 it. What was that Two-Spot was tryin\u0027 to tell me?\" The Doc explained the matter and finished by saying that he felt sure that it had not been the missing puncher who had visited him. \"I don\u0027t think so, neither,\" asserted Johnny. \"He\u0027d be a fool to go like that. No, sir, I\u0027ll bet it wasn\u0027t Squint—but, wait a minute! If he counted on leavin\u0027 th\u0027 country right after, why, he might a\u0027 done it, at that. If it wasn\u0027t Squint, then where was he?\" \"Sleepin\u0027 off his liquor,\" said Dave. \"Why, that\u0027s it! While he slept somebody took his outfit an\u0027 kidnapped th\u0027 Doc. H—l, it may all be a joke!\" \"You wouldn\u0027t think so if you observed that man as I did,\" replied the Doc. \"He was in deadly earnest. I could feel it.\" \"Well, there\u0027s two ways to start at it,\" said Johnny, ordering drinks all around, including Two-Spot. \"He had a grudge ag\u0027in\u0027 you, an\u0027 he was extra friendly to th\u0027 SV. Run back in yore mem\u0027ry for somebody that hates you enough to want to get square. If that don\u0027t work, then hunt for th\u0027 feller that likes th\u0027 SV. Anybody \u0027round here that\u0027s sweet on that Arnold gal, that you knows of?\" \"No; not that we know of,\" answered the Doc. \"Big Tom was the last one who called there; but he quit, quite some time ago.\" \"Got throwed so hard he still aches,\" gloated Two-Spot. \"Well, I can\u0027t help you,\" said Johnny. \"I don\u0027t[67] know anythin\u0027 about th\u0027 people around here. An\u0027, bein\u0027 a stranger, an\u0027 likely to be suspected of any orphaned devilment, I\u0027m shore glad I looked in here, last night. But I ain\u0027t worryin\u0027 about Squint,\" he deprecated. \"He\u0027s an old hand at takin\u0027 care of hisself, if I\u0027m any judge. He\u0027ll turn up with a headache, an\u0027 yell fit to bust for his saddle, an\u0027 gun.\" \"I hope so,\" said Dave. He turned to the Doc. \"Did you fix up th\u0027 laig?\" \"Certainly; it was a simple fracture,\" answered the Doc. He paused. \"Cussed if I know what to think,\" he growled, arising. He had observed Johnny closely, saw that he was left-handed, found the voice not quite what he had hoped for, and Dave\u0027s statement cinched the matter. He nodded good-by and went out, but he looked at Johnny\u0027s saddle, where he found silver ornaments instead of brass, and plain stirrup guards instead of the fringed ones he had noticed the night before. Shaking his head he mounted and rode homeward. Two-Spot placed the broom across a table and sat down. \"Dave,\" he said, almost reverently, \"what made you say that?\" \"Say what?\" demanded the proprietor, belligerently. \"You hearin\u0027 things?\" \"Mebby; but I ain\u0027t seein\u0027 \u0027em.\" \"What did I say that\u0027s ridin\u0027 you so hard?\" demanded Dave. \"What you did about Nelson lookin\u0027 in last night.\" \"What was that?\" asked Johnny, with pardonable curiosity. \"Why, Dave up an\u0027 tells th\u0027 Doc that you poked[68] yore head in at that there door at nine-thirty last night,\" explained Two-Spot. \"Well, suppose I did?\" asked Johnny. \"What about it?\" \"Well, now,\" mourned Two-Spot, \"if I ain\u0027t got th\u0027 cussedest mem\u0027ry! It\u0027s got Texas fever; a tick must a\u0027 crawled up my ear. Of course you did; and didn\u0027t you say \u0027Two-Spot, when I sees you tomorrow I\u0027ll buy you a drink?\u0027\" \"I reckon I might \u0027a\u0027 said somethin\u0027 like that,\" laughed Johnny. \"She\u0027s yourn, Ol\u0027 Timer—with a cigar to punish me for forgettin\u0027.\" Two-Spot enjoyed his drink and pulled contentedly on the cigar. Then he turned toward the rear door. \"Time for me to give George a hand. Shall I take Pepper around out of th\u0027 sun?\" \"Why, yes; an\u0027 much obliged,\" answered Johnny. Dave pointed his finger and his whole arm at the broom lying across the table. \"That yourn?\" he demanded. Two-Spot looked. \"I told you that my mem\u0027ry was bad,\" he chuckled. Putting the broom away where it belonged he went out and led Pepper around to the shed. Johnny looked hard at Dave. \"That was a good turn, Dave,\" he said. \"What made you do it?\" Dave rumpled his hair. \"Squint\u0027s missin\u0027, which means one customer less. Bein\u0027 a stranger down here I reckoned they\u0027d pass th\u0027 buck to you. That meant they\u0027d likely do it here—th\u0027 Doc come up to locate you, I figgered. Besides losin\u0027 a lot more customers[69] I\u0027d have to clean up a slaughter-house. I just made up my mind I wouldn\u0027t do it. Anyhow, I\u0027d like to shake hands with th\u0027 coyote that lugged th\u0027 Doc off to fix that laig. I would so.\" \"Don\u0027t blame you,\" said Johnny, holding out his hand. \"We can shake on that, all right. I say a doctor is a doctor an\u0027 ought to go where he\u0027s needed.\" Dave looked him full in the eyes, a quizzical smile playing around his mouth, and shook hands gravely, solemnly. It was almost a ceremony. \"My sentiments, exactly,\" he responded. \"Wonder if Squint was hurt?\" \"I\u0027d bet he wasn\u0027t,\" answered Johnny. \"I\u0027d even bet he went to a different part of th\u0027 country. Mebby he got caught in some devilment. Punchers are great for roamin\u0027—just look where I am.\" He shook his head sadly and went out through the rear door for the hotel, leaving Dave with a grin on his face which threatened to disrupt it. He had not gone more than a few steps when he turned and went back. Poking his head in at the door, he said: \"Dave, when I\u0027m drinkin\u0027 in here, an\u0027 it can be done easy, just see that mine is some watery. I like th\u0027 delicate flavor it has that way; th\u0027 delicater, th\u0027 better.\" Dave chuckled and nodded. \"Yo\u0027re drinkin\u0027 it. If yo\u0027re satisfied, I am. I can\u0027t do it at th\u0027 bar, where th\u0027 bottle passes; but it\u0027ll be easy if yo\u0027re playin\u0027 cards.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56727.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
