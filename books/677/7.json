{"id":18885,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII HUNTING WITH THE HOUNDS","content":"Johnny entered the kitchen, looked at the stove and went into the dining-room, where George was playing solitaire. \"That\u0027s a bad habit, George,\" he said, shaking his head. \"It don\u0027t get you nothin\u0027.\" \n \n George made a play and looked up. \"Aimin\u0027 to get me into a two-handed game of somethin\u0027?\" he queried. \n \n \"No; I ain\u0027t,\" answered Johnny. \"I was just wonderin\u0027 how long you was goin\u0027 to play it.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to play it till I have to start cookin\u0027,\" said George, determinedly. \n \n \"Then you ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to stand over that hot stove for more\u0027n an hour, are you?\" \n \n \"No, sir; I ain\u0027t.\" \n \n \"You talk like it was somethin\u0027 to dodge!\" snorted Johnny. \n \n \"I\u0027d like to see you do it!\" retorted George. \n \n \"Huh!\" sniffed Johnny. \"I got a good notion to do it.\" \n \n George made another play. \"Notions!\" he sneered. \"Notions ain\u0027t doin\u0027 it!\" \n \n \"Then I will do it,\" said Johnny, going into the kitchen and throwing wood into the stove. He took down a lid made up of rings, substituted it for one of the stove lids, lifted out the middle section and put in its place an iron ladle. \n \n [71] \n \n A chair scraped out in the dining-room and George poked his head in. \"What you think yo\u0027re doin\u0027?\" he demanded. \n \n \"Callin\u0027 yore bluff. Go on back to yore solitaire. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to run some bullets.\" \n \n \"Why, cuss yore nerve!\" said George. \"Who told you to mess up my kitchen?\" \n \n \"You said you\u0027d like to see me stand over this stove,\" answered Johnny. \"Run around an\u0027 get me two pounds of lead from Dailey.\" \n \n \"Get it yoreself!\" snapped George. \"You clean up when you get through,\" he warned. \n \n \"Shore,\" replied Johnny, and he went out to get the lead. \n \n Dailey looked up. \"Hello, Nelson!\" \n \n \"Howd\u0027y, Ben! Got two pounds of lead, an\u0027 some Kentucky powder?\" \n \n \"Shore,\" answered Dailey. He slid a bar of lead onto the counter and took a can from a shelf. \"This ain\u0027t Kaintuck—but it\u0027s as good. How much?\" \n \n Johnny put a few grains in the palm of his hand and rubbed them with a forefinger. \"I don\u0027t want this at all,\" he said, showing the black smudge. \"I want th\u0027 kind you use.\" \n \n Dailey grumbled, but felt under the counter and produced another can. \"Here\u0027s th\u0027 best made,\" he said. \n \n Johnny tested it, and nodded. \"Half a pound will do.\" \n \n Returning to the kitchen he used George\u0027s axe to cut the lead into smaller pieces, and dumped them into the[72] ladle, after which he paid a hurried visit to his room for tools. \n \n Two-Spot shoved his head in at the door. \"What you doin\u0027? Runnin\u0027 slugs?\" \n \n \"Shoein\u0027 a hoss,\" said Johnny. \n \n Two-Spot grinned. \"Where\u0027d you get th\u0027 lead?\" \n \n \"Dailey\u0027s,\" answered Johnny, punching out old primers. \n \n \"Buy primers, an powder, too?\" demanded Two-Spot. \n \n \"Powder,\" grunted Johnny. \n \n \"Off\u0027n th\u0027 shelf behind him?\" \n \n \"Under th\u0027 counter.\" \n \n \"Yo\u0027re lucky; he must like you. Well, then some of \u0027em will go off,\" said Two-Spot \"But if you\u0027d bought his primers, none of \u0027em would.\" He looked around and started to resize some of the shells. \"These here ain\u0027t shells. They\u0027re—they\u0027re kegs.\" He picked up the mold and opened it. \"My G—d!\" he snorted. \"Yo\u0027re a bloody-minded cuss. Yore gun got wheels an\u0027 a limber?\" \n \n \"It\u0027ll make th\u0027 other feller limber gettin\u0027 out of th\u0027 way.\" \n \n Two-Spot hurt his finger and quit. \"Reckon Dave wants me,\" he observed. \n \n \"I\u0027m shore I don\u0027t,\" grunted Johnny, beginning to reprime the shells. \n \n \"Do it yoreself, then!\" snapped Two-Spot, going out. He looked carefully around and, going into the narrow space between the kitchen and the rear of the saloon, disappeared from sight. \n \n [73] \n \n Around in front of the Palace four punchers were dismounting. They were disgruntled, but in one way they felt relief. After a morning\u0027s search for tracks on the Double X, along its eastern line, they had given up the job and had started to Gunsight to carry out a task which they felt would require a great amount of tact to keep it from becoming a shambles. But on the way they had stopped at the Doc\u0027s and found that it would not be necessary to cross-question Johnny. There remained one further duty to perform and they decided to slake their thirsts before attempting it. Big Tom wanted information from those whom he felt would be able to give it, since they were directly benefited by the kidnapping of the Doc. He felt sure that the committee he had appointed were qualified to get it for him, especially if they had a proper amount of liquor before they started after it. Hence he had supplied them with the funds and told them that it was his treat. Carson and Dahlgren had fat blanket rolls behind their saddles; \"Smitty\" and Fraser, nothing but their usual paraphernalia. \n \n They stamped in to the bar and lined up. To Dave\u0027s inquiry, they replied that their morning\u0027s work had been in vain, but boasted that the afternoon would not be wasted. \n \n \"We\u0027re goin\u0027 where th\u0027 information is,\" said Carson, \"an\u0027 we\u0027re goin\u0027 to get it. If it comes easy, all right—but we\u0027re goin\u0027 to get it, savvy?\" \n \n \"An\u0027 when we do get it, it will be forty feet of rope an\u0027 a sycamore tree for th\u0027 coyote that got rid of Squint an\u0027 kidnapped th\u0027 Doc,\" boasted Dahlgren. \n \n [74] \n \n \"Nobody gives a whoop about th\u0027 kidnappin\u0027, \u0027cept th\u0027 Doc,\" said Fraser; \"but this was a poke at th\u0027 Bar H, an\u0027 that\u0027s where we set in. If we finds out who got rid of Squint, we know who kidnapped th\u0027 Doc; an\u0027 if we learns who kidnapped th\u0027 Doc, we likewise finds th\u0027 coyote what got rid of Squint. An\u0027 I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you that we\u0027re goin\u0027 to find out who he is. Doc said he done a good job on that busted laig, an\u0027 it would be a mean trick on him to undo it; but we\u0027re goin\u0027 to find out! Give us another round.\" \n \n \"I got to laugh about th\u0027 Doc,\" said Smitty, \"a growed man, lettin\u0027 hisself be stole that way. An\u0027 what\u0027s he doin\u0027 now? Is he out a-huntin\u0027? He ain\u0027t. He\u0027s settin\u0027 in that shack of his\u0027n waitin\u0027 for us to get his kidnapper. Fill \u0027em again, Dave.\" \n \n \"Forty feet of rope an\u0027 a sycamore tree,\" repeated Carson. \"If he puts up a fight we\u0027ll give him this!\" He yanked out his gun and fired at the floor. \n \n Could they have seen the result of the shot they would have been greatly surprised. Two-Spot, under their feet, lying on his pile of stolen blankets and discarded clothing, and drinking in every word they said, had just shifted to a more comfortable position when the gun roared and the bullet, ripping through the flooring, cut a welt on his cheek. Panic stricken, he started to roll and crawl toward the hotel, and was too excited to notice the pair of legs at the wash bench, where Johnny was cooling bullets in the basin, but rolled out and against the bench, upsetting it and Johnny, too, as well as the basin, bullets, and the water bucket. There was a mad scramble for a few seconds and Two-Spot[75] lost a tooth before Johnny saw who It was. Then both leaped to their feet, Two-Spot angrily spitting blood and dirt. \n \n \"What you think yo\u0027re doin\u0027?\" blazed Johnny, reaching for Two-Spot\u0027s collar. \"Playin\u0027 earthquake?\" \n \n \"Who you hittin\u0027?\" snarled Two-Spot. \"Leggo my shirt; I got somethin\u0027 to tell you!\" \n \n George came running and stuck his head out of the door. \"Go it, Ol\u0027 Timer!\" he encouraged. \"Serves him right for th\u0027 mess he\u0027s made!\" \n \n Two-Spot thanked him by kicking backward, guided by sound and instinct. George, receiving one whole foot just below his short ribs, doubled up forthwith and disappeared. There was a crash and the sound of falling stove wood, and George had interest in nothing outside of himself. \n \n \"They\u0027re goin\u0027 to th\u0027 SV, an\u0027 make \u0027em tell who\u0027s raisin\u0027 th\u0027 devil on th\u0027 range,\" said Two-Spot in Johnny\u0027s ear. \"If they ain\u0027t told easy, then they\u0027ll take th\u0027 splints off\u0027n th\u0027 ol\u0027 man\u0027s laig. G—d only knows where they\u0027ll stop, for they\u0027re gettin\u0027 full of liquor.\" \n \n \"Who are they?\" \n \n \"Carson, Dal, Smitty, an\u0027 Fraser,\" answered Two-Spot. \"\u0027Forty feet of rope an\u0027 a sycamore tree,\u0027 they says,\" he mimicked, \"an\u0027 shot through th\u0027 floor. I got it in th\u0027 cheek, d—n \u0027em.\" A frightened look came to his face. \"Don\u0027t tell \u0027em where I was,\" he begged, for the hiding-place was his only refuge and without it his life would be made miserable. \n \n \"I\u0027ll swap secrets,\" said Johnny. \"Keep mum about tellin\u0027 me this. Take Pepper around front an\u0027[76] mix her in with their cayuses. Then pick up th\u0027 slugs an\u0027 keep \u0027em for me.\" \n \n A piece of firewood whizzed past his ear, and then a stream of them. George, still throwing, emerged from the kitchen, blood in his eye. Johnny grabbed him. \n \n \"We was playin\u0027 a joke on you, George,\" he said, hurriedly. \"Two-Spot kicked you accidental. Here\u0027s somethin\u0027 to square it,\" and George opened his hand to see a coin nestling therein. \n \n \"Joke!\" he muttered, feeling around his belt \"Accidental! You may think so, but I\u0027m cussed if I do! My G—d, his relations must be mules!\" \n \n Dave and the committee looked up as the door flew back and slammed against the wall, to see Johnny enter, a little too erect, stepping a little too precisely and wide, his mind obviously concentrated on his legs. His face was owlishly serious and he nodded to each in turn with great gravity. Describing a wide curve he stepped carefully to the bar, where he stopped, sighed, and braced himself. \n \n \"Dave,\" he said, waving an arm, \"th\u0027 best in th\u0027 house for us. Didn\u0027t know what to do with m\u0027self; but now we can have some \u0027citement. Here\u0027s how. Here\u0027s to pore Ol\u0027 Squint.\" \n \n \"Here\u0027s to pore Ol\u0027 Squint,\" repeated Dave. \"I allus liked Squint.\" \n \n \"Everybody liked Squint,\" responded Johnny. \"Everybody, \u0027cept—\u0027cept what\u0027s his name? Pore Squint, kidnapped; an\u0027 the Doc, kidnapped; nobody\u0027s safe no more. You might get kidnapped—you—an\u0027[77] you—an\u0027 you—an\u0027 Dave! No, not Dave!\" he burst into laughter. \"Not Dave! He! He! Less\u0027n it was Ol\u0027 Buffalo an\u0027 his waggin!\" \n \n Smitty rocked to and fro: \"He! He! He!\" he roared. \"Ol\u0027 Buffalo an\u0027 his four-hoss team! Freight for Juniper!\" \n \n Carson slapped Johnny on the shoulder. \"Nobody\u0027s safe but Dave!\" he shouted. \"Ol\u0027 Buffalo would have to roll him in, like a bar\u0027l.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t you care, Dave,\" said Fraser. \"I\u0027m yore friend, an\u0027 nobody\u0027s goin\u0027 to kidnap you, waggin or no waggin. Not while Bill Fraser\u0027s around. No, sir. Give us another. Big Tom\u0027s blowin\u0027 his boys.\" \n \n \"Couldn\u0027t get along without Dave, not nohow,\" said Johnny. \"Here\u0027s to Dave—everybody\u0027s fr\u0027en\u0027. Just th\u0027 same I ain\u0027t forgettin\u0027 pore Squint. I\u0027d like to know who kidnapped him—just so I could get my rope on him. That\u0027s all. Jus\u0027 that. Got notion to go find him. Come on, le\u0027s all go!\" \n \n \"Forty feet of rope an\u0027 a sycamore tree,\" burbled Smitty. \"Forty feet of——\" \n \n \"We\u0027re goin\u0027 to find him,\" boasted Dahlgren. \"Goin\u0027 to righ\u0027 now. Le\u0027s have one more drink, Dave. Just one more, an\u0027 then we go git him.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s th\u0027 way!\" cried Johnny, \"Come on—one more, Dave, ol\u0027 kidnapper. Then forty feet of sycamore rope. Want to come, Dave? Come on! Come on with us!\" \n \n \"I better stay here,\" said Dave, earnestly. \"I better be right here when you bring him in. Somebody ought to be.\" \n \n [78] \n \n \"That\u0027s Ol\u0027 Dave, all righ\u0027,\" cried Smitty. \"Good Ol\u0027 Dave.\" \n \n \"Give us a bottle, Dave,\" said Johnny. \"Give us two bottles. Nothin\u0027s too good for my fren\u0027s.\" \n \n \"If pore Squint was only here,\" burbled Smitty, eyeing the bottles. \"Pore Squint. We\u0027ll bring that coyote in for you, Dave. We\u0027ll drag him to town.\" \n \n \"Him an\u0027 Ol\u0027 Arnold,\" supplemented Carson. \"Both of \u0027em!\" \n \n \"That\u0027s it!\" cried Johnny. \"That\u0027s where we\u0027ll go—come on, fellers! Goo\u0027-by, Dave; goo\u0027-by!\" \n \n They surged toward the door, milled before the opening, and then shuffled to the street. Fraser threw an arm around Johnny\u0027s neck and slobbered about poor Squint. Johnny slipped the six-gun from Fraser\u0027s holster, dropped it on his own foot to deaden the fall, and then pushed it under the saloon. He staggered, with Fraser, out toward the horses and bumped into Dahlgren, who grabbed them both to save himself. Fraser\u0027s other arm went around his friend\u0027s neck and he protested his love for them both. Dahlgren\u0027s gun also struck Johnny\u0027s boot and was quickly scraped over with sand. \n \n Under the saloon Two-Spot changed from all ears to mostly ears and some eyes, for his view was limited to below the hips of the maudlin gang. When Fraser\u0027s gun slid under the floor he became, for an instant, all eyes, and wriggled in greedy anticipation. Then he saw the second gun strike Johnny\u0027s boot and become covered over with sand, and he rocked from side to side with silent mirth, his boiled countenance acquiring spots of[79] mottled purple, especially his nose. As soon as the crowd mounted, he crawled forward, wriggling desperately when the space became too small for hands and knees. He had to get those guns before the proprietor got them, for Dave would not allow him to own a weapon. When he had gone as far as he dared, he stopped and waited until the bunched group whirled away up the trail, and then wriggled more desperately than ever. Suddenly he stopped and writhed sideways behind a pile of dirt, for the heavy steps above his head ceased as a pair of enormous legs waddled into his field of view. Dave kicked around in the sand, found the weapon, and laboriously picked it up. The huge legs remained motionless for a moment as their owner watched the cloud of dust which rolled eastward on the trail. \n \n \"He\u0027s takin\u0027 chances,\" muttered Dave. \"An\u0027 I can almost smell him from here. Six glasses of whiskey down his sleeve—great guns, but he must feel comfortable! Well, boys, I don\u0027t know where yo\u0027re goin\u0027, but nothin\u0027 would surprise me.\" He paused a moment in indecision, thoughtfully regarding the colt. \"I reckon I ought to lose this gun down th\u0027 well—but I\u0027ll wait till he comes back.\" \n \n The fat legs waddled out of sight and the floor creaked again. Two-Spot wriggled forward, snatched the Colt and backed to his nest, where he looked at his prize and gloated. \n \n \"Dave never saw you fall,\" he chuckled. \"Oh, yo\u0027re a beauty; an\u0027 only two are gone. Cuss it! This is th\u0027 gun that shot me!\" He considered a moment.[80] \"Now I got to get some .45\u0027s from th\u0027 store when Ol\u0027 Eagle-Eye ain\u0027t lookin\u0027.\" \n \n Meanwhile the exuberant committee tore over the trail until Fraser, wishing to let off some extra steam, felt for his gun. He reined in so quickly as almost to cause a catastrophe. Dahlgren now discovered his own loss and there was a wrangle about going back to look for the missing weapons. Their insistence won out and the committee wheeled, spread out, and cantered back almost to Gunsight, wrangling all the way. Yielding at last to the acrimonious suggestions of the other three, they gave up the search and set out again, beginning on the second bottle. When they finally arrived at the SV ranchhouse the afternoon was over half gone and they were so under the influence of liquor that it was all they could do to get to the door of the house. Staggering in, they went to Arnold\u0027s room and all began talking at once. There were no preliminaries—Margaret and Charley, caught in the room, were forced into a corner and had to hear the brutal threats. Johnny was the loudest of them all, but there was no profanity in his words; and he took the first chance that offered to wink at the helpless man on the bed. Arnold, ignorant of what he was supposed to know, pleaded in vain. Carson rolled up his sleeves and announced his intentions, staggering toward the bed. He collided with Johnny and they both fell. As Johnny scrambled to his feet he caught Margaret\u0027s eye and winked slowly. Then he let out a roar and blamed Carson for the fall. His eye caught sight of a calendar on the wall and he objected to the red numerals representing Sundays. Jerk[81]ing out his guns he shot the numbers out, the bullets passing so close to Smitty that that valiant committee-man nearly broke his neck falling over a chair he backed against. A glass of water was shattered and then the guns became wobbly, covering everything in sight. Boasting that he could shoot out a fly\u0027s eye without touching the rest of the insect, he shot a spur off of Carson\u0027s boot and put a hole through Dahlgren\u0027s hat when he presumably aimed at the lamp on a shelf. Roaring and jumping, he accused Arnold of doing the kidnapping himself, and fired at a knot in the floor, missing it, and clipping a button from Fraser\u0027s vest. The committee was very drunk, but it was not so far gone that all instincts of self-preservation had fled, and it made haste to get out of the room. Smitty, finding the door blocked, and being in a hurry, went through the open window with remarkable directness for one in his condition. \n \n \"He ain\u0027t here!\" shouted Johnny. \"He\u0027s got away! Come on, fellers; we got to get him—pronto!\" \n \n \"Where\u0027d he go?\" shouted Carson, stumbling over a chair. He kicked it across the room and sat down suddenly. Being assisted to his feet, he staggered out toward the horses, the rest stringing after him. \"Where\u0027d he go?\" he demanded at the top of his voice. \n \n \"Don\u0027t know,\" answered Johnny, hanging onto Dahlgren. \"But he\u0027ll come back. Let\u0027s ambush him!\" \n \n \"A\u0027right; I\u0027m tired of ridin\u0027,\" declared Smitty. \"Got forty feet of rope an\u0027 sycamore tree. Where\u0027ll we go?\" \n \n \"Up on th\u0027 Juniper trail,\" said Johnny. \"We know[82] he don\u0027t hide in th\u0027 south; we\u0027d a\u0027 seen him long ago. I know a good place, come on!\" \n \n It was a wonder how they ever mounted, but they managed it, all but Smitty, who had to be assisted to the saddle. Once seated, they were fairly well at home and followed Johnny along the ranch trail. An hour later Johnny and three of them were lying in the bushes at the edge of the Juniper trail, Smitty having been lost on the way. The sun was still warm, and the liquor potent, which was in no way checked by their inactivity, and snores soon arose. Johnny, smiling cynically at the prostrate figures, made a soft bed out of Carson\u0027s and Dahlgren\u0027s blankets and lay down to see it through. The night passed quietly and the early morning light showed four soundly sleeping figures. Higher and higher climbed the sun and one by one the men awakened, consumed by raging thirsts. Johnny raised himself on one elbow and looked around. \n \n \"I want a drink,\" he announced. \"Gimme a drink, Fraser!\" \n \n \"Ain\u0027t got none; I\u0027m dyin\u0027 of thirst!\" \n \n Staggering to their feet they looked around, got their bearings and made a rush for their horses; and soon a miserable, sick committee pounded along the trail at its best speed, bent only on one thing—to get to Dave\u0027s. \n \n Dave heard them coming and knew what would be wanted. He met them at the door and passed out a bottle; consuming it eagerly, they strayed off toward their ranch, ugly and profane. \n \n Johnny watched them go. \"I was in desperate company, Dave,\" he said. \"They was all primed to raise[83] h—l out there, but I saw that nobody belongin\u0027 to that ranch knew anything about Squint, or th\u0027 Doc, that we didn\u0027t know, so I sort of coaxed \u0027em away. An\u0027 would you believe it, Dave, we was so petrified we got lost an\u0027 finally climbed down an\u0027 went to sleep right where th\u0027 idea struck us?\" \n \n \"I allus was a great believer, Nelson,\" answered Dave. \"That\u0027s mebby why I\u0027m a pore man at my time of life. An\u0027 I admits that you has persuadin\u0027 ways. Now, I figgers it this way: Th\u0027 Doc up an\u0027 kills Squint; Squint gets even by kidnappin\u0027 th\u0027 Doc; after which th\u0027 Doc buries th\u0027 corpse an\u0027 throws away th\u0027 grave. But, I says, an\u0027 it\u0027s th\u0027 \u0027buts\u0027 that raise th\u0027 devil, how does Big Tom figger it? He ain\u0027t got my trustin\u0027 nature. An\u0027 how will Wolf figger it? An\u0027 all th\u0027 rest, after they get together an\u0027 wrestle things out? I\u0027m glad you got a fast hoss, an\u0027 a clear trail. Where\u0027s Smitty?\" he demanded. \n \n \"He was a weak brother,\" Johnny sorrowfully declared. \"Th\u0027 last I saw of him he was fallin\u0027 off his cayuse about five miles northwest of th\u0027 ranch. First he fell back over a chair, backwards; then he fell out of a window, frontwards; an\u0027 when he fell off his cayuse he was goin\u0027 sideways. When it comes to fallin\u0027 I\u0027ll back him against anybody. What do I owe you for them two bottles of whiskey? They was amazin\u0027 medicine.\" \n \n \"Whiskey?\" queried Dave. \"Did you taste it?\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t,\" confessed Johnny. \"I handed th\u0027 first bottle to Dahlgren, an\u0027 by th\u0027 time it got back to me there wasn\u0027t nothin\u0027 in it. Th\u0027 second bottle I gives to[84] Smitty, an\u0027 I got left again. If I\u0027d had a couple more I might a\u0027 got a drink. What makes you ask?\" \n \n \"The first was brandy, an\u0027 th\u0027 second was gin,\" said Dave. \"I reckoned mebby they\u0027d like a change. Sorry you didn\u0027t get none of \u0027em.\" \n \n Johnny looked at him reproachfully. \"I ain\u0027t,\" he said. \"Good Lord! Come, Pepper, there ain\u0027t no tellin\u0027 what this man\u0027ll do next. Mebby we won\u0027t see Smitty till next week—come, little hoss!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56728.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
