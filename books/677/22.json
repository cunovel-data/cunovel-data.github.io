{"id":18900,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII THE ULTIMATUM","content":"There was movement on the Gunsight trail at an early morning hour. Five men rode to within half a mile of the town and then halted for a final consultation, which was soon over. Three rode westward at a walk, another went on, bearing slightly to the east, while the fifth, dismounting, led his horse from the trail, picketed it in a steep-walled ravine and went north on foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n The eastern sky paled, grew silvery, and then became tinted with red and gold. A man crouched behind the hotel shed, swearing softly because he heard no sounds of a horse within it. He snuggled close to a knothole, peering at the hotel wall not far from him, and the rifle in his hand was full cocked. Behind the saloon shed another man had thrust his rifle through a crack and as the light increased, he cuddled his cheek against the stock and peered along the sights into an open window in the rear wall of the hotel. Lying in a clump of weeds north of the saloon and near the trail was another rifleman, who could see Dave\u0027s north wall and the front of the saloon as well. A fourth had settled down in the end of a shallow gully across the trail from Dailey\u0027s store, his Winchester needing but to move over a short arc to cover the door of the saloon. It was point-blank range for him, and in this matter he was no[294] better off than his three friends. The fifth, the angry and determined foreman of the Bar H, not finding cover as close as he would have liked, was forced to ensconce himself over two hundred yards from the front of the hotel, and a little to the right of Jerry\u0027s shop, where he kept turning problems over in his mind. Desperate ailments called for desperate cures, and if Gunsight objected as to methods, then it would have to object in the persons of the three easy-going inhabitants who were likely to be offended. The actions of the Double X were far more serious, but had to be risked if life were to be worth living for the outfit of the Bar H. With the coming of dawn Big Tom pondered less and looked more, his rifle at his shoulder, ready for instant use. \\n\\n \\n\\n Back on the trail there was silent movement as an indistinct and bootless figure crossed it and paused, waiting for light. The darkness thinned and the figure moved forward again, bent over close to the boot marks on the ground, which it followed with slow sureness. The stockinged feet made no sound, avoiding twigs and dead leaves, and not an out-thrust branch whipped or scraped as the man worked forward. He carried a heavy Sharp\u0027s, the heel of his hand over the cocked hammer, his fingers covering the trigger guard as an extra precaution against accidental discharge. \\n\\n \\n\\n The few buildings in Gunsight appeared as though a curtain were slowly rising and finally stood revealed in their entirety. The sun rose and threw soft, delicate shadows from the bases of all standing objects, too weak to mark their patterns far, melting into oblivion.[295] A door slammed, sounding irreverent and out of place, and from the hotel chimney curled a timid wisp of smoke, this way and that, finally climbing straight up and losing its identity against the gray-blue of the sky, while its supporting column twisted and turned and danced as it hurried to self-effacement. Dailey\u0027s chimney sent up a skirmishing film, which died out; and then, as if in stalwart support of the fainting advance, there came a darker, thicker column, telling all who cared to read that Dailey put his trust in kerosene. The hotel door opened, causing a quick movement of Big Tom\u0027s rifle, and George, sleepy and unpleasant in looks and disposition, glanced idly around and went back again. From far off in the west the quavering, long-drawn wail of a coyote, mercifully tempered by distance, arose to greet the rising sun. Birds sang with delirious abandon and the soft noises in grass and sand and brush told of a waking world. In the vague grayness of the hotel, framed by the open door, something moved, steadily growing plainer and soon took the form of a towel in the hands of George, who drove winged pests before him and, with a final, frenzied waving, took hold of the door and slammed it shut. As it closed Big Tom relaxed, eased his hold on the rifle and reached back to remove a stone which was beginning to assert its presence under him to his growing discomfort. Turning his head, he looked back, and froze, his groping fingers rigid. Ten feet behind him and to his right was the black muzzle of a heavy rifle, and behind that a pair of gray-blue eyes regarded him malevolently through narrow slits in the bronzed face. For a tense, appre[296]ciable interval eyes looked into eyes, and then the foreman squirmed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t move, only as I tell you, an\u0027 slow,\" said Johnny\u0027s clear, low voice. \"I got you just th\u0027 way I want you—ambushin\u0027! Don\u0027t touch that gun, an\u0027 don\u0027t make no noise. First, put yore hands up even with yore armpits, palms down, on th\u0027 ground. Now inch back, away from that gun. Keep on—more—more—all right—stop! Slide \u0027em forward, straight out ahead of you, an\u0027 then lay still. You can admire Fannin\u0027s front door, an\u0027 imagine me in it, careless an\u0027 easy prey for a pot-shooter, if it\u0027ll do you any good. Don\u0027t look around till I tell you to, an\u0027 don\u0027t make a sound, blast you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Not being able to do anything else, Big Tom obeyed and soon felt his Colt leave its holster. A hand felt up under his coat, to see if the back-strap of his trousers held a gun. Being right-handed, the foreman would hardly choose to carry a six-gun there under ordinary circumstances, but this situation was not in that category. The back-strap was guiltless. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Roll over on yore back,\" came the next command, and when it had been obeyed the same inquiring hand passed lightly and quickly over waist-band and shirt bosom, the left hand holding a six-gun now instead of the rifle. \"All right, wiggle down in that gully, and then head for where you left yore cayuse, keepin\u0027 low down, like yore nature, an\u0027 out of sight of town.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you think yo\u0027re doin\u0027?\" wrathfully inquired Big Tom, but obeying as he protested. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Huntin\u0027 for an excuse to blow you apart, you am[297]bushin\u0027 dog,\" came the metallic reply. \"Shut yore mouth, an\u0027 keep on goin\u0027. I\u0027ll give you a chance to talk later. Any harm that comes to you will be of yore own makin\u0027. Keep on!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They reached the brush at the edge of the trail, waited a moment, and then crossed swiftly, and when they stopped again it was at Pepper\u0027s side. Johnny quickly mounted and urged his captive on again. Coming to a picketed Bar H horse he ordered the foreman to mount it, and as the helpless man obeyed Johnny revealed their objective. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Head for yore ranchhouse,\" he said. \"Ride on my right side, yore stirrup even with my pommel, where my Colt will have a fair view of you from under my coat. If we meet anybody, pass \u0027em on yore side, an\u0027 don\u0027t make no remarks that ain\u0027t needed. We go at a lope; hit it up!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so they rode, except at a few places in the canyon, where the narrowness of the twisting trail made Big Tom go ahead. Arriving at the ranchhouse they rode around on its further side, tied the horses to a stake, and went indoors. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sit down,\" commanded Johnny, indicating a chair in the middle of the room. \"Here, look at this,\" and he handed the foreman a piece of paper which was covered with sprawled figures. \"I don\u0027t know what Fraser forgot, or what he got tangled up, so I\u0027ll go over it again. Them top figgers are based on th\u0027 tally sheets of th\u0027 SV in th\u0027 fall of th\u0027 year that Arnold took possession. They ain\u0027t like th\u0027 figgers Ol\u0027 Simon could \u0027a\u0027 showed, for th\u0027 ranch had been on th\u0027 slide for some[298] years, an\u0027 plenty of its cows went on th\u0027 drive trail to give money to th\u0027 heirs. Th\u0027 lowest figgers are based on th\u0027 tally Cimarron finished yesterday. Natural increase, figgered as one to five, shows what they ought to be, minus them that Arnold had to sell to get grub. It\u0027s all there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Th\u0027 h—l with \u0027em!\" blazed the foreman, crushing the sheet in his hand and hurling it from him. \"What do I care about any figgers belongin\u0027 to th\u0027 SV? Take yore figgers an\u0027 get out—I\u0027m advisin\u0027 you to leave this part of th\u0027 country, an\u0027 cussed quick. I ain\u0027t playin\u0027 godfather to th\u0027 SV, an\u0027 I\u0027m runnin\u0027 this ranch without no help from you, Sherwood, or anybody else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When I leave this range I\u0027ll go of my own accord, an\u0027 there won\u0027t be no pushin\u0027,\" retorted Johnny. \"Sherwood can \u0027tend to his own business; I\u0027ll \u0027tend to mine; but I\u0027ve got time to look after a little of yourn. If you ain\u0027t godfather to th\u0027 SV, yo\u0027re shore goin\u0027 to act like one. There\u0027s nine hundred an\u0027 seventy head clean missin\u0027 from it, an\u0027 there\u0027s plenty of big ranches down Texas way that would yell for th\u0027 rangers, an\u0027 holler calamity if they had lost that many. For a little ranch to lose \u0027em it is shore enough calamity. If anybody would put that many cows on th\u0027 trail for me I\u0027d show \u0027em a lot of money at th\u0027 other end.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"SV calamities don\u0027t mean nothin\u0027 to me,\" rejoined Big Tom. \"It was allowed to run itself, an\u0027 it run itself into th\u0027 ground. Why wouldn\u0027t it lose a lot of cattle?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It shore might do just that,\" conceded Johnny, \"if it wasn\u0027t for one thing. Yo\u0027re an old hand in th\u0027 cattle[299] business, an\u0027 you know that a bunch of cattle can run wild an\u0027 grow amazin\u0027. An\u0027 they\u0027d shore do it on a range like th\u0027 SV with that valley an\u0027 them brush-filled draws for winter shelter. There ain\u0027t no natural enemies to cut down th\u0027 calves—an\u0027 that ranch is good grazin\u0027 all year \u0027round. There wasn\u0027t cows enough to eat it down.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s them quicksands, an\u0027 there was a lot of gray wolves runnin\u0027 down here th\u0027 last couple of years!\" shouted Big Tom, red with anger. \"They never even kept up th\u0027 wire fence around th\u0027 quicksands. Why wouldn\u0027t they lose cows?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The quicksands would get a few,\" rejoined Johnny. \"They would get more if th\u0027 cows was drove into \u0027em like I caught Lang doin\u0027—an\u0027 them will be figgered in th\u0027 herd to be throwed back. I\u0027ve asked about wolves an\u0027 everythin\u0027 else—there wasn\u0027t nothin\u0027 to keep \u0027em down. An\u0027 as for that fence, th\u0027 less you, or any of yore gang have to say about that, th\u0027 better it\u0027ll be for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then yo\u0027re callin\u0027 me a liar,\" blazed the foreman. \"There was wolves down here! An\u0027 I never touched that fence, neither.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby you didn\u0027t personal; an\u0027 I ain\u0027t callin\u0027 you a liar while you ain\u0027t got a gun,\" retorted Johnny. \"But I am admittin\u0027 that yo\u0027re plumb mistaken. Comin\u0027 down to cases, pleasant an\u0027 friendly, I\u0027m sayin\u0027 that th\u0027 Bar H owes the SV nine hundred an\u0027 seventy head of cattle, as they come in a round-up, all kinds an\u0027 conditions. When do you aim to start deliverin\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The foreman sprang to his feet. \"When do I aim[300] to start deliverin\u0027?\" he shouted, staring into the calm, gray eyes of the man whose Colt covered him. \"When do I aim to start deliverin\u0027?\" he repeated, his neck swelling. \"I ain\u0027t aimin\u0027 to at all! Nine hundred an\u0027 seventy! That would plumb ruin us!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It ain\u0027t ruined th\u0027 SV,\" replied Johnny evenly. \"Not quite, anyhow,\" he added. \"An\u0027 it won\u0027t ruin you, because they can all be figgered as extras. We all know they ain\u0027t never been put on th\u0027 tally sheets with th\u0027 other cattle, for th\u0027 owners to know about. They\u0027re strays, you might say, that have been eatin\u0027 up yore grazin\u0027 scandalous. They\u0027ve wandered over on you an\u0027 are likely to eat you into some kind of ruin. You ought to be able to do better without \u0027em, an\u0027 you shore ought to be glad to get rid of such a hungry bunch of cattle that you can\u0027t prove title to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got all th\u0027 title I need—they\u0027re on my ranch, an\u0027 that\u0027s good enough,\" shouted Big Tom. \"It\u0027s good enough for me, an\u0027 it\u0027s good enough for everybody else, you included.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not for nobody else,\" corrected Johnny, \"me least of all. That title is questioned now by more than a dozen men. You can\u0027t keep \u0027em, nohow, for th\u0027 general round-up will cut \u0027em four ways. Th\u0027 times are changin\u0027 down here like they changed some years back on th\u0027 older ranges. Th\u0027 runnin\u0027 iron is dyin\u0027 fast, an\u0027 for good reasons. Maverickin\u0027 is goin\u0027 out of style—an\u0027 nothin\u0027 can stop it. An\u0027 with it goes that title you was mentionin\u0027. Why not get ahead of \u0027em, an\u0027 throw them cows over onto th\u0027 SV before anybody gets insultin\u0027 you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [301] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have somethin\u0027 to say about any styles changin\u0027 down here,\" retorted the foreman. \"Mebby more than some folks think.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You ain\u0027t got a chance, not a chance,\" Johnny assured him. \"You\u0027ll be like th\u0027 Injun that tried to push back th\u0027 first, an\u0027 last, engine he ever saw. It was goin\u0027 strong when he tried it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 I ain\u0027t got th\u0027 authority to give away a cow, not even a single dogie—not to mention a herd. I\u0027m not ownin\u0027 this ranch; I\u0027m workin\u0027 for it. How can I straighten out my tally sheets to cover th\u0027 loss of a herd like that? They don\u0027t belong to me—they belong to th\u0027 ranch, to th\u0027 owners.\" He was wasting as much time in argument as he knew how in the hope that his outfit would return. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pshaw!\" laughed Johnny. \"They can all be accounted for. Didn\u0027t I just say that they never got on th\u0027 tally sheets at all? You shore found you had been feedin\u0027 a hull passel of cows that didn\u0027t belong to th\u0027 ranch in case they did get on th\u0027 tally sheets. You found it out, an\u0027 it was so plumb careless of yore line riders that you up an\u0027 fired them that was responsible. That won\u0027t bother you, because you got three names off yore pay-roll right now. There ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 we can\u0027t get around if we pull together.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But th\u0027 title to \u0027em wouldn\u0027t stick,\" objected the baited foreman. \"Every one of them cows could be took away from Arnold. I ain\u0027t got th\u0027 authority to make it stick. An\u0027 th\u0027 only reason I\u0027m wastin\u0027 time talkin\u0027 to you over a fool thing like this is because you got a gun on me, an\u0027 I can\u0027t help myself.\" His brain[302] seized upon and rejected scheme after scheme for getting out of the situation, one of which he recalled and examined anew. It was not a bad one, if bad came to worse, and he nursed it, sorry that so much time would have to elapse before he could carry it out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I just said we could get around anythin\u0027,\" replied Johnny, pleasantly. \"There\u0027s an awful lot of mavericks runnin\u0027 around on this ranch, most of \u0027em under four years old. They wouldn\u0027t show any Bar H brand. They\u0027d only have a SV. There wouldn\u0027t even be a vent brand to single \u0027em out; an\u0027 cattle ain\u0027t tellin\u0027 where they come from, or we\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 heard a lot of scandals long ago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nine hundred an\u0027 seventy mavericks!\" snorted Big Tom. \"A fine chance I\u0027d have of roundin\u0027 up that many! Yo\u0027re plumb loco.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is a lot, I\u0027ll admit,\" conceded Johnny, apparently balked. \"Of course, if you owned this ranch, you could make it up with Bar H brands. But you don\u0027t. You can\u0027t give away nothin\u0027 that you don\u0027t own. I can see where that would put you. Anythin\u0027 that was yours you could give away; but not no Bar H belongin\u0027s. That yore idea?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yo\u0027re gettin\u0027 th\u0027 drift, slow but shore,\" sarcastically rejoined the foreman. \"Anythin\u0027 I own I can give away; but not nothin\u0027 I don\u0027t own. A kid can understand that. An\u0027 there ain\u0027t that many mavericks on this ranch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I still say we can get around anythin\u0027 an\u0027 I ain\u0027t no kid,\" muttered Johnny. \"Lemme see: First, we\u0027ll consider cash. Got any?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [303] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothin\u0027 but my wages,\" answered the foreman, a sarcastic smile playing around his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Too bad,\" mused Johnny, \"wages ain\u0027t a patch. If we could have you ownin\u0027 a nice pile of money—but can get money!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here!\" snapped Big Tom, aggressively. \"I can\u0027t sign no checks over a certain amount a year—th\u0027 bank wouldn\u0027t cash \u0027em. An\u0027 they\u0027ve all been signed for this year, all but th\u0027 pay-roll. An\u0027 I don\u0027t own that money, neither. That belongs to th\u0027 ranch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, failin\u0027 in cash,\" said Johnny, crisply, \"I\u0027ll take a note. Will you gimme one?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will; you can have it,\" nodded Big Tom, his pet scheme coming more vividly into his mind. \"I\u0027ll make it out right here, an\u0027 now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want yore note,\" objected Johnny. \"What good is it? Now, if it was endorsed by somebody that could make it good, why that would be different. You said you\u0027d gimme a note; then gimme that one for three thousand dollars, of Arnold\u0027s, that is endorsed by somebody that can make it good. An\u0027 also a receipt for it. That\u0027ll cut down that nine hundred an\u0027 seventy an amazin\u0027 lot. Th\u0027 difference won\u0027t be too many to get right here on th\u0027 Bar H, an\u0027 all of \u0027em mavericks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Big Tom was staring at him as if doubting his senses. His face flushed and the veins on his neck and forehead stood out like serpents. He stepped forward involuntarily, but the gun stopped him. He was incapable of speech for the moment and could only make inarticulate sounds. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027ll help a lot,\" said Johnny, lightly balanced[304] and leaning slightly forward. \"Well let th\u0027 Double X say how many cattle, takin\u0027 \u0027em as they come, they would sell for three thousand dollars. Then we\u0027ll take that many away from that nine seventy. You can easy round-up what are needed to make up th\u0027 difference, brand \u0027em with th\u0027 SV stampin\u0027 irons, an\u0027 throw \u0027em over where they belong. I\u0027ll take th\u0027 note now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll take h—l!\" yelled the foreman. \"You\u0027ll take h—l!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll get h—l!\" snapped Johnny, his eyes narrowing; \"an\u0027 you\u0027ll get it pronto! Hunt up that note, an\u0027 without no more cussed nonsense. It\u0027s yore play, an\u0027 you shore want to play fast!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You won\u0027t get no note!\" shouted Big Tom, his face twitching with rage. He seemed about to spring. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t!\" ordered Johnny, softly, but with a cold ferocity in his voice that carried conviction. \"I\u0027ll shoot you like I would a coyote, you pot-shooter, for you are a coyote! Get that note!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Big Tom, seething with rage, swayed in agonizing hesitation. He had courage, plenty of it; but he also had common sense. Unarmed, he could do nothing against the gun which had killed his two-gun man in an even break; and his common sense came to his rescue, and barely in time. Glancing out of the window, he detected no signs of his outfit on the trail, and craftily attempted to begin the argument all over again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027ll do,\" said Johnny. \"We\u0027ve finished that. My time is valuable, even if I ain\u0027t lookin\u0027 for company; an\u0027 if they come, you\u0027ll be th\u0027 first to go under. Get—that—note!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [305] \\n\\n \\n\\n Shrugging his shoulders, the foreman stepped forward, but Johnny slipped aside and snarled a warning, so venomous and tense that Big Tom gave up the desperate idea, and slowly turned, a beaten man. He walked toward a metal-bound box in a corner of the room, Johnny close at his heels, the gun against the foreman\u0027s back. Unlocking it, he slowly raised the lid, and felt Johnny\u0027s breath on his neck, the gun pressing solidly against his spine. As the cover went up it revealed a derringer lying on top of a few papers, and the foreman\u0027s hand slowly passed by it and fumbled among the contents, reluctantly withdrawing with an unsealed envelope. Shutting down the lid he turned the key, and arose to his feet as his captor, alert as a cat, stepped aside. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny took the envelope, backed off a little farther, opened it, glanced at the note and nodded. He looked around the room and then ordered Big Tom to the table. Taking the pen and ink from a shelf, he placed them before the foreman and then handed him the envelope, telling him what to write. When the pen ceased scratching he took the receipt, read it, and held it out a moment for it to dry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This saves you a lot of brandin\u0027,\" he remarked. \"Somewhere around two-thirds, I reckon, \u0027though th\u0027 Double X will set its value in cattle. Now, you listen close. There ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to be any round-up or brandin\u0027 on th\u0027 northwest section of this ranch till th\u0027 SV gets its herd. When we know how many will be needed you will have till th\u0027 general round-up to use th\u0027 SV irons. Send for \u0027em when you get ready, an\u0027 an SV puncher[306] will come with \u0027em. I\u0027m warnin\u0027 you fair: A Sharp\u0027s will talk to anybody runnin\u0027 a brand or round-up out there unless a SV man is on th\u0027 spot. An\u0027 there\u0027s goin\u0027 to be some SV men right soon—good ones—an\u0027 they\u0027ll be plumb touchy about wire fences comin\u0027 down. Now I\u0027m takin\u0027 you for a little ride with me, so you won\u0027t be tempted to smoke up out of a window while I\u0027m ridin\u0027 off. Come on; I\u0027m shore in a hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In a few moments they rode westward, Big Tom leading the way, and it was not until more than an hour had passed that he was free to ride back again, or to Gunsight for his outfit, as his fancy dictated. \\n\\n \\n\\n He chose to return to the ranch and while he rode he elaborated the plan which had come to him, and rubbed his hands as its details unfolded. Since Nelson had admitted being the man who was responsible for the mysterious events which had puzzled the country, Big Tom had remembered Lang\u0027s report about having seen Margaret and Johnny riding together. The foreman had not given her up, although pretending to have no interest in her. Having lost the note he had to change his plans, and go about it in a different way. Now his rage and jealousy fanned the flame of his impatience, gave a keener edge to his scheming wits, and added zest to what he purposed to do; and before he knew it he arrived at the house.
