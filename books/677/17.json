{"id":18895,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII NEWS ALL AROUND","content":"At daylight Jerry went on his way rejoicing; the round-up started again in full swing on the SV, crossing the line onto Triangle range, to the later astonishment and vexation of Frank Gurley, Triangle rider on that section, whose hasty visit to his bunkhouse aroused a lively discussion, fortified him with Sam Gardner and Jim Lefferts to protect the interests of their ranch, and upon their return to the scene of activity, fortified Cimarron\u0027s smiling, but firm outfit, with three more men. In Highbank, Wolf Forbes, penniless now, was beginning to go without liquor and drift toward soberness, and the lambent flame of his reawakened anger burned constantly stronger; while out on the Double X, Johnny and the sleeping members of that outfit awoke to a new day\u0027s work, and to a firmer and warmer bond between them. The Bar H awakened to a new puzzle; the mysterious disappearance of Smitty and the discussion which followed his inexplicable absence resulted in Dahlgren being dispatched to Gunsight to see if the erring puncher had yielded to his well-known thirst and might be found snoring in that vicinity. Also, he was to keep an eye out for Wolf, and to make cautious inquiry concerning him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dahlgren was most successful in his mission, accumulating a fund of information staggering in its total[218] and barren of reason. His first accretion of wisdom came when he left East Canyon and descried numerous punchers zealously bent upon an operation well known to him, and he rode up for what information he might be able to obtain. Hoping for a full loaf, expecting a half, he left with a few crumbs which only increased his appetite for more. In Gunsight his appearance caused unnecessary hilarity, and his questions as to Smitty\u0027s location were received with impolite guffaws, followed by an explicit description of Smitty\u0027s riding, looks, words, and actions, coupled to various prophesies, variously stated. When he mentioned Wolf, a veritable gale of laughter deafened and confused him, and the roundabout, cryptic, and fragmentary references to Wolf taxed his brain. He gathered the information that Wolf was wrapped in hides as his preference in perfumes; that Wolf was in the skin business, without competitors; that he had descended in the social scale to the point where he traveled as freight; that he took an arduous, unnecessary, and uncomfortable journey and was to be known, henceforth and hereafter, as Polecat, a name being better suited to his habits and preferences. It was explained that he was not expected back, which accounted for the half-masted flags and the black bands on the hats. He learned that Smitty was on the trail of Squint and would catch him if he went far enough in the right direction, and that Polecat was on the trail of Smitty, but would have to ride hard; and a further suggestion postulated the belief that Squint was on the trail of Wolf. Gunsight was as generous in its liquor as it was in its explanations; it was[219] open-handed and lavish, and insisted that the distinguished Bar H ambassador imbibe freely, which he did; and when he was helped into his saddle and started for home, he tried to repeat what he had heard so that he would not forget it; and by the time he reached the bunkhouse he had not forgotten anything but the relations between the various parts of each thing to be remembered, and his account was verbal hash. Big Tom learned, among other things equally lucid and valuable, that Polecat Forbes went after Squint hunting Smitty\u0027s holy hat rounding up SV cows on the Double X part of the Triangle journey and would not be back until forty miles of hides went up toward Juniper with Two-Spot keeping tally on Cimarron\u0027s wagon. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the presence of such loquacity, Big Tom lost the power of speech, choked with feelings of a murderous kind, and used the flat of his foot as a propulsive agent, which Dahlgren found helped him in getting to his bunk, where he sprawled out on his back and snored through a cloud of flies foregathered for their share of what had dribbled. \\n\\n \\n\\n The foreman strode to the horse corral, swearing at every step, caught, saddled, and mounted his best horse and rode off to see and hear for himself. The first man he met was Cimarron, who was expecting visitors after Dahlgren\u0027s departure, and had placed himself where he would be seen easily. The segundo had been thinking things over and had about come to the conclusion that it would be foolish to try to deny the part the Double X was taking in the round-up; and when[220] he caught sight of Big Tom riding toward him a feeling of contempt swept over him and decided the question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s more excitement on this ranch than I\u0027ve seen in some time,\" smiled the Bar H foreman. \"Makin\u0027 a clean sweep of everythin\u0027 that\u0027s got hoofs?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Clean is th\u0027 word,\" answered Cimarron, his smile as friendly as the visitor\u0027s. \"I reckon Lin is mebby thinkin\u0027 more about beef, though.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aimin\u0027 to start a herd up th\u0027 trail?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t just know what dickerin\u0027 there may come out of this,\" answered the round-up boss. \"He says for me to take some of th\u0027 boys an\u0027 round up over here. There\u0027s no tellin\u0027 what he may do. I know that I can report that there\u0027s quite some four-year-olds, an\u0027 a few three-year-olds. Where th\u0027 devil th\u0027 cattle under four years old are keepin\u0027 themselves I don\u0027t know. But if he\u0027s aimin\u0027 to throw in a herd for Arnold an\u0027 send \u0027em up th\u0027 trail with some of ours they\u0027ll be numerous enough to make a showin\u0027. He may be gettin\u0027 sweet on this ranch, because of them Snake Buttes thieves. If he is, I reckon Arnold wouldn\u0027t turn down a fair cash offer for grazin\u0027 a couple of herds over here through th\u0027 fall an\u0027 winter. He\u0027s got room for three times th\u0027 number feedin\u0027 here now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There ain\u0027t no doubt about that,\" answered Big Tom. \"When are you aimin\u0027 to round up for strays on our north end?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, there can\u0027t be many over there,\" replied Cimarron. \"Th\u0027 natural barriers would keep \u0027em back. Have you noticed any?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nary a one; but if you want to make shore, I\u0027ll lend[221] you a couple of th\u0027 boys, \u0027though I\u0027m shore gettin\u0027 short of men.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you say you ain\u0027t seen none, that\u0027s good enough for me until th\u0027 spring round-up, anyhow; an\u0027 then we can start combin\u0027 at the same time, if we do th\u0027 work for th\u0027 SV, of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s Arnold askin\u0027 for th\u0027 SV, lock, stock, an\u0027 barrel?\" bluntly asked Big Tom. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know,\" answered Cimarron, surprised. \"I don\u0027t reckon Lin would consider buyin\u0027 it, \u0027less, mebby, he could sell th\u0027 Double X. But what\u0027s th\u0027 use of you an\u0027 me talkin\u0027 about that? I don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 except orders, an\u0027 th\u0027 only orders I got was to run this round-up an\u0027 get back as soon as I can. I\u0027ll be leavin\u0027 you now, for I\u0027m workin\u0027 harder than any man here, which shore is sayin\u0027 somethin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 I got to be ridin\u0027 on,\" said the Bar H foreman, and he made the words good. Reaching the Doc\u0027s shack, he dismounted and went inside, where he remained for nearly an hour, came out, glanced at the bullet holes and then went on to town, where he found the saloon deserted except for the proprietor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dave looked up and let his hand rest on the cap-and-ball under the bar, said cap-and-ball being .44 caliber, with the annoying habit of often sending one through the barrel, and igniting the caps on the nearest chambers and sending their contents along each side of the barrel with roving commissions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Dave!\" smiled Big Tom, motioning for a drink that he did not want, \"I\u0027m lookin\u0027 for strays—two-laigged strays.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [222] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you wants is another outfit to ride herd on this one,\" sympathized Dave. \"Lookin\u0027 for Smitty?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s one of \u0027em. Have you seen him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have. He didn\u0027t stop here, so I don\u0027t know where he got it,\" said the proprietor, grinning; \"but from th\u0027 way he acted, insultin\u0027 folks, I reckon he must \u0027a\u0027 been bit by a passel of snakes, an\u0027 took too much cure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s th\u0027 worst of them sponges,\" regretted Big Tom, a scowl going over his face. \"I don\u0027t mind a periodic if there\u0027s plenty of time in between; but Smitty\u0027s periodics are like th\u0027 days in th\u0027 week durin\u0027 a round-up—they come too close together. Have you seen any others?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t—not since Wolf was in here one afternoon last week,\" answered Dave. \"Let\u0027s see: that was th\u0027 day Ol\u0027 Buffalo come down from Sherman, which would make it on a Friday. But,\" he said sorrowfully, \"I has had distressin\u0027 news about Wolf. Young Jerry Wheatley, who\u0027s freightin\u0027 now, stopped in here only last night an\u0027 says Wolf was down in Highbank drinkin\u0027 \u0027em out of everything but water. He says yore puncher was on th\u0027 worst bender he\u0027s seen in months, which I says means somethin\u0027, comin\u0027 from a town like Highbank.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Big Tom\u0027s fist crashed on the bar. \"Cuss it!\" he exclaimed wrathfully, \"that\u0027s th\u0027 worst of them periodics! You can\u0027t never tell when they\u0027ll start, an\u0027 nobody knows when they\u0027ll stop!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You lose, both ways,\" nodded Dave. \"Jerry says he didn\u0027t have no hoss, saddle, or guns; an\u0027 a man can travel rapid on what they\u0027d sell for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [223] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They wouldn\u0027t buy th\u0027 cayuse,\" reflected Big Tom, \"seein\u0027 as he ain\u0027t supposed to own no Bar H animal. But I reckon it might \u0027a\u0027 strayed th\u0027 Lord only knows how far. We ain\u0027t noticed no cayuse missin\u0027, so far, but that don\u0027t mean nothin\u0027. All right! He can come back when he goes broke an\u0027 sobers up an\u0027 he can walk, d—n him! Was Lang with him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lang? Is he missin\u0027, too?\" Dave\u0027s astonishment was genuine. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Disappeared like th\u0027 earth swallowed him,\" growled Big Tom. \"They\u0027ve hunted all over for him, an\u0027 can\u0027t find nothin\u0027 at all. I\u0027m sayin\u0027 this country is goin\u0027 loco; an\u0027 I\u0027ll give a hundred dollars cash to find out what\u0027s at th\u0027 bottom of it all. Why, cuss it! Sherwood is roundin\u0027 up for the SV—what\u0027s th\u0027 matter with him? Is he loco, too?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby he figgers on makin\u0027 them idle punchers of his\u0027n bring in somethin\u0027 besides appetites,\" guessed Dave. \"I don\u0027t blame him at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby; but they acts like they was havin\u0027 a picnic out there. Have you heard anythin\u0027 about th\u0027 Double X startin\u0027 a herd of their own up on th\u0027 trail?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a word; but ain\u0027t they throwin\u0027 their cattle into McCullough\u0027s this year?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re supposed to; but you can\u0027t never tell,\" answered the foreman. He glanced around and then looked fixedly at his companion. \"Yo\u0027re not forgettin\u0027 what I said about a hundred dollars cash, are you?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s somethin\u0027 I ain\u0027t likely to forget,\" replied Dave ambiguously, \"if you mean it, shore.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [224] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m meanin\u0027 it \u0027though I ain\u0027t wantin\u0027 you to have no rivals,\" replied Big Tom, significantly. \"You hears an\u0027 sees a lot in here an\u0027 there ain\u0027t no use of lettin\u0027 anybody else in on it, an\u0027 splittin\u0027 up with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There ain\u0027t nobody else goin\u0027 to get in on it,\" truthfully assured Dave. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nelson got over his grouch ag\u0027in\u0027 wimmin?\" laughed the foreman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t reckon so; but he ain\u0027t seen her yet, I guess,\" replied Dave, grinning. \"When he does, there ain\u0027t no tellin\u0027 what\u0027s goin\u0027 to happen to him. Don\u0027t it beat all? You better look out, Tom; he may edge you out of th\u0027 game.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me!\" demanded the foreman. He let out a roar of laughter. \"I ain\u0027t got no interest thataway at all. I passed, cold.\" He turned away. \"Don\u0027t forget Dave.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Goin\u0027 so soon?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I\u0027m ridin\u0027 back. Adios.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dave stared out of the window for a few minutes, his face slowly getting redder. \"Yo\u0027re lyin\u0027, Big Tom,\" he muttered. \"Yo\u0027re aimin\u0027 to get that girl more\u0027n ever you was. An\u0027, d—n yore shriveled soul! Do I look like a Judas?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Down on the SV, Cimarron was weighing something in his mind. Perhaps he had said too much to the Bar H foreman. Coming to a sudden decision he rode over to Bud Norris. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, Boss!\" said Bud, grinning from ear to ear. \"Big Tom\u0027s visit ridin\u0027 you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [225] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bud, we\u0027ve got enough men here for this toy round-up,\" replied Cimarron. \"There ain\u0027t no use of robbin\u0027 th\u0027 ranch of a man that ain\u0027t really needed here, an\u0027 I\u0027m wishin\u0027 to send word to Lin by somebody who won\u0027t shuffle it. Now, you listen close,\" and the round-up boss gave him the facts of Big Tom\u0027s visit. \"Tell him that, an\u0027 what I said. He ought to know my leads in case that big coyote rides out to th\u0027 house an\u0027 gets curious. Now you tell me what I\u0027ve just told you.\" Bud complied, and when he had finished, his companion nodded. \"Big Tom ain\u0027t seen you. You go north, foller th\u0027 Juniper trail back, an\u0027 don\u0027t pass within sight of th\u0027 Doc\u0027s place. Tell Lin to keep you with th\u0027 outfit—I don\u0027t need you here, an\u0027 he\u0027s too short handed. Get a-goin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bud obeyed and in due time he came within sight of Gunsight, where a growing thirst lured him to ride in for a visit at Dave\u0027s. The proprietor still was smarting under the sting of Big Tom\u0027s attempt to bribe him and was glad to see someone who would help him get his mind on pleasant subjects. Dave regarded the story of the kidnapping of Wolf as being in that category, and when Bud left he was howling with laughter, and drove his horse toward home at a speed which awakened a resentful surprise in that animal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Th\u0027 locoed sons-of-guns!\" repeated the delighted rider at intervals. \"I knowed we had some locoed sage hens under our roof, but I thought they had limits! Why th\u0027 devil wasn\u0027t I in on that? I\u0027m stickin\u0027 too close to home nights; but not no more. Any future Double X parties goin\u0027 to Gunsight will shore have[226] little Buddie right in their midst! Th\u0027 nervy coyotes! Th\u0027 stem-windin\u0027 fools! Ha! Ha! Ha!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Further on he gave vent to another burst of laughter as a new thought struck him. \"It\u0027s all Nelson\u0027s fault. Cuss it! now I know why there has been so much hilarity about th\u0027 kidnappin\u0027 of th\u0027 Doc! They was plannin\u0027 to go it one better—an\u0027 I\u0027m sayin\u0027 that they shore succeeded. They aimed purty high, but they done it, an\u0027 without even a scratch. I wonder who put th\u0027 sand burr under Smitty\u0027s saddle? Cuss that west section! I\u0027m goin\u0027 to change an\u0027 ride our southeast line!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When he pulled up at the bunkhouse door he found Lin and two other men who had ridden the last trick on the west section and he delivered Cimarron\u0027s message as soon as he dismounted. Answering the foreman\u0027s few questions, he let out a whoop and unburdened his news about Wolf and Smitty, painting the word pictures in a way which did him credit, and he felt the thrill of pride of an artist in the responses he obtained. After the greater pressure of their hilarity had escaped they began the puzzle of trying to name the jokers, and their foreman did that for them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Friday night,\" mused Lin. \"Huh! Th\u0027 last that went to town was Slim, Tom, Gus, an\u0027 Bill. An\u0027 it was Friday night, too, because they said somethin\u0027 about hearin\u0027 Buffalo rumblin\u0027 in. That makes it Friday night, an\u0027 puts \u0027em in town when th\u0027 wagon was there. Well, I\u0027m d—d! I can believe it of Slim and Tom, purty near, but not Bill an\u0027 Gus; still, there ain\u0027t no tellin\u0027 what any man of this fool outfit will do after he\u0027s been in Dave\u0027s all evenin\u0027. I\u0027m sayin\u0027 that mebby[227] they got a tail holt on a mean varmint; that\u0027s their business, \u0027though, an\u0027 they ain\u0027t helpless kids.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebby Wolf don\u0027t know who done it, but blames us all,\" suggested Rich Morgan, unconsciously resting his hand on the butt of his gun. \"In which case I\u0027m all eyes an\u0027 ears from now on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He knows who was in town that night,\" replied the foreman. \"But if he goes shootin\u0027 promisciously like, I\u0027ll have to take my rifle an\u0027 go get him, an\u0027 any way will do.\" He thought for a moment. \"He knows who to look for. Well, they started it, an\u0027 nobody\u0027s got any right to help \u0027em out, not if he goes about it open an\u0027 aboveboard. Now, if Big Tom Huff comes a-visitin\u0027, you don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 at all. Cimarron sort of declared us in an\u0027 I\u0027ll play our cards, myself. You better fix that horse corral. There\u0027s five posts loose near th\u0027 northeast corner. Set \u0027em tight an\u0027 bind around th\u0027 corner with a couple strands of wire. Keep it outside as much as you can so th\u0027 barbs won\u0027t do no damage. Th\u0027 locoed fools—kidnappin\u0027 a man like Wolf!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait till Nelson comes in tonight,\" exulted Deuce, who by this time had learned quite a lot about the old Bar-20 outfit. \"We got somethin\u0027 that beats th\u0027 kidnappin\u0027 of th\u0027 Doc every way!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Huh!\" muttered the foreman thoughtfully. \"That was th\u0027 night Dailey played in such hard luck, wasn\u0027t it? Shore it was. Then Nelson was there, too.\" He paused and looked out of the window for a moment. \"Well, go out an\u0027 wrestle with them posts. Bud, you go on day shift with Tom an\u0027 Nelson. I\u0027m takin\u0027 th\u0027 second night shift with Bill an\u0027 Gus.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [228] \\n\\n \\n\\n Darkness had fallen when Johnny and Tom Wilkes rode in from the day shift after being relieved by the first night shift. They had heard the bare outlines of the joke, and now got it as completely as the foreman could give it to them while they ate their supper. Johnny looked serious and did not laugh as much as they had expected he would. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s th\u0027 matter, Nelson?\" bantered Matt. \"Jealous?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny pushed back. \"Boys, you\u0027ve forced my hand. I wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to say nothin\u0027 to nobody about some few things till I had made all th\u0027 plays I was aimin\u0027 to make. But this here joke on Wolf, gettin\u0027 out like it did, shore forces me to lay down my cards, face up. An\u0027 I want th\u0027 whole range to see \u0027em—to spread th\u0027 news before it\u0027s too late. It ain\u0027t my way to sneak out of anythin\u0027 I\u0027ve started an\u0027 let some innocent party take th\u0027 comeback. I freighted Wolf away; I shot th\u0027 holes in Smitty\u0027s hat; I drove Squint out of th\u0027 country; I kidnapped th\u0027 Doc, an\u0027 I killed Lang in a fair fight, his wits ag\u0027in\u0027 mine, in fair sight of each other, when I was mired in them cussed quicksands. I can prove what I say by showin\u0027 where Squint\u0027s things are hid, by Wolf\u0027s six-gun, that I kept to remember him by, an\u0027 by describin\u0027 what them holes in Smitty\u0027s hat looked like. I was savin\u0027 Wolf\u0027s gun to show it to him, sometime, an\u0027 ask him if he couldn\u0027t take a joke. Now I ain\u0027t apologizin\u0027 to nobody for nothin\u0027 I\u0027ve done. I claim I was justified—an\u0027 I\u0027ll leave it to you if th\u0027 joke on Wolf wasn\u0027t a hummer? Wasn\u0027t it a three-ringer, with a side show? I says it was; an\u0027, further, I says I\u0027ll do it over again if[229] I feel like it. No cussed man can spy on me without riskin\u0027 a comeback. An\u0027 I says there wasn\u0027t nothin\u0027 I could do to him that would \u0027a\u0027 been as good a joke as what I did do. Now, Sherwood, I better be ridin\u0027 to tell Cimarron\u0027s boys about it, so they won\u0027t be caught off their guard in case Wolf gets to them before he looks anywhere else. I\u0027m wantin\u0027 to warn Slim \u0027specially—he was in town that night. Then I\u0027ll rustle to town an\u0027 stay there. I reckon he\u0027ll come to Gunsight, an\u0027 I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to be there when he does, to ask him if I ain\u0027t the cussedest practical joker he ever knowed. If he\u0027s gone an\u0027 got on th\u0027 prod about a little joke like that, then I\u0027ll have to look out for myself. I\u0027m startin\u0027 now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No use goin\u0027 now,\" said the foreman quickly. \"That\u0027s a bad trail for a stranger to tackle at night, an\u0027 that cayuse of yourn is too good to risk bustin\u0027 her laigs. If you leave here before daylight—say half an hour before—tomorrow mornin\u0027, you\u0027ll be in plenty of time. Them boys ain\u0027t kids. I\u0027m honin\u0027 to hear about these jokes, an\u0027 so are th\u0027 boys. You stay here, with us, tonight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lin\u0027s dead right,\" earnestly endorsed Tom Wilkes, the others unanimously backing him up. \"You ain\u0027t goin\u0027 till we hears about \u0027em—that is, of course, if you feels like tellin\u0027 us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnny looked from one to another and then sat down again, and for the rest of the evening he had an audience which expressed its appreciation of what it heard, and in unrestrained enthusiasm. When he had finished and started to turn in, the foreman strode over to him and held out his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n [230] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nelson, I\u0027m proud to know you.
