{"id":18898,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX PLANS AND PREPARATIONS","content":"On the last day of the round-up Johnny rode out to the SV and found a herd held against the wire fence. A branding fire was burning off to one side and Larry Hallock had just thrown a calf, its pitiful bawl turning its mother into a charging fury. The mother, being unbranded, was thrown instead of being diverted and received the same treatment being accorded to her sturdy offspring. Larry\u0027s helpers arose, let the calf up and grinned at its eagerness for maternal protection. They wiped their foreheads with wet sleeves and welcomed the visitor. \n \n \"There\u0027s some calves at that,\" said Larry, \"but they\u0027re this year\u0027s crop. An\u0027 that\u0027s th\u0027 last brandin\u0027, I reckon, for here. Cimarron an\u0027 three of th\u0027 boys are startin\u0027 a clean-up north of th\u0027 east end in that grassy valley. I reckon today will finish it.\" \n \n Slim nodded. \"It wouldn\u0027t hurt to keep a few men ridin\u0027 well back, for a few days, pickin\u0027 up strays; but I\u0027m sayin\u0027 this ranch has been combed to a T. We\u0027ve cussed near branded even th\u0027 shadows. You\u0027ll never have no trouble tellin\u0027 them that Larry has branded. He paints wide an\u0027 free like he was paintin\u0027 a house. Just look at that yearlin\u0027 over there; an\u0027 them two weaners—they\u0027re cussed near all brand.\" \n \n Larry grinned. \"Shore; it saves a lot of ridin\u0027 when[262] you can read \u0027em far off. I\u0027m in favor of histin\u0027 flags on \u0027em an\u0027 ridin\u0027 sign with a telescope hangin\u0027 from th\u0027 saddle.\" \n \n Johnny laughed at the grinning pair, dust and sweat from head to feet. \"This ranch will have stampin\u0027 irons as soon as it can get \u0027em, \u0027though Larry must hate \u0027em like poison. I\u0027m comin\u0027 out here, some of these days, an\u0027 put that horse corral at th\u0027 house in better shape; an\u0027 anybody that offers to help won\u0027t get insulted. Now I\u0027m ridin\u0027 to th\u0027 house. I got an idea an\u0027 want to see how it sets with th\u0027 Ol\u0027 Man. See you later.\" \n \n \"I been scratchin\u0027 all day for an idea like that,\" chuckled Slim. \"All I could think of was a drink of water; an\u0027 Larry goes an\u0027 shoves out his canteen to me!\" \n \n \"If I didn\u0027t,\" said Larry, \"everybody would \u0027a\u0027 got thirsty, an\u0027 then who would \u0027a\u0027 held this herd?\" \n \n Johnny laughed and rode off, his friends watching him for a few moments. Then Larry went toward his horse, Slim following him. \n \n \"Well,\" said Slim, \"Nelson knows where he can find a parson ten miles closer than Highbank, anyhow. After he put her on her hoss th\u0027 other day in Gunsight an\u0027 went off to get his own, she looked after him—an\u0027 I ain\u0027t no fool. I\u0027m in favor of holdin\u0027 it in town. An\u0027 I says this here busted-down ranch needs a good man to take hold of it an\u0027 run it. I reckon an outfit of four would swing it handsome. Yes, three good men could do it.\" \n \n Larry swung into the saddle. \"I got three brothers that shore do love singin\u0027 since Two-Spot was planted.[263] I\u0027m leanin\u0027 strong to th\u0027 melodious myself. An\u0027 I\u0027m admittin\u0027 that I never knowed what singin\u0027 was before. Well, you maverick, let\u0027s go an\u0027 help \u0027em count that herd. You an\u0027 me aim to stop in town tonight on our way home, don\u0027t we? Then come on.\" \n \n Johnny dismounted at the kitchen door and knocked. Charley came running and acted as host. \n \n \"Gee!\" he exclaimed, his eyes sweeping to the six-guns and resting on them. \"Come on in! Peggy\u0027s readin\u0027 to dad. He\u0027s gettin\u0027 plumb ornery an\u0027 says he\u0027s goin\u0027 to get up tomorrow, anyhow, come h—l or high water. Here she is now: Hey, Sis! Here\u0027s Mr. Nelson—bet yo\u0027re plumb glad to see him. Is dad still on th\u0027 prod?\" \n \n \"Charley! What language! How you do pick things up! How-do-you-do, Mr. Nelson?\" she smiled, holding out her hand. \"I am so glad to see someone who may have a good influence on father. Come in. Father, here is our friend, Mr. Nelson.\" \n \n \"Which gun got Wolf?\" demanded Charley. \n \n \"Glad to see you, sir!\" exclaimed Arnold. \"You have been entirely too much a stranger to this house. Sit down, and tell me what is going on. That Cimarron may know how to talk, but he doesn\u0027t seem very anxious to prove it. When I ask him how he finds the ranch he tells me about everything else that he can in one minute, pleads work, and leaves.\" \n \n \"I think a whole lot of Cimarron,\" replied Johnny. \"He and his boys have worked like slaves out here—they\u0027ve done an amazin\u0027 lot. They expect to have everything cleaned up and counted by tonight, or by[264] tomorrow, without fail. Then we can do some figgerin\u0027 ourselves, an\u0027 see how many cows are comin\u0027 to you. What I called for was to make a proposition to you, an\u0027 I think it\u0027s a good one.\" \n \n \"Go ahead; I\u0027m sayin\u0027 yes to it right now,\" smiled Arnold. \n \n \"I reckoned mebby you would say that after you heard it,\" said Johnny. \"McCullough, trail boss for Twitchell and Carpenter, is comin\u0027 up from th\u0027 south with two thousand head of mixed cattle. His deliveries call for four thousand head, an\u0027 he is countin\u0027 on gettin\u0027 th\u0027 second two thousand right up here around Gunsight. Th\u0027 Bar H is throwin\u0027 a thousand over to him an\u0027 th\u0027 Triangle has promised him five hundred. Th\u0027 other five hundred was to come from th\u0027 Double X, but Sherwood has got other ideas. He\u0027s got a good outfit an\u0027 hankers on gamblin\u0027 a little. He\u0027s made up his mind to sell McCullough only a hundred head of older cattle an\u0027 keep th\u0027 other four hundred for his own trail herd next year. He says Dodge, but I reckon he\u0027s fishin\u0027 for a government contract up north; an\u0027 if he is, an\u0027 lands it, he\u0027ll make a lot of money.\" \n \n \"I wish somebody would show me how to make some,\" replied Arnold, gloomily. \"We are headed for some poorhouse, I\u0027m afraid.\" \n \n \"Father!\" exclaimed Margaret, reprovingly. \"You should not say or think such things. Everything will come out all right. Our luck is turning.\" \n \n Johnny glanced at her and smiled. \n \n \"Perhaps it is, but I can\u0027t see its face, yet,\" retorted Arnold. \"We\u0027ll know how many head we have, and[265] how many we have lost, but that knowledge won\u0027t keep us, will it?\" \n \n \"Perhaps Mr. Nelson has something to say concerning that.\" \n \n \"I have, Ma\u0027am,\" smiled Johnny, his eyes for an instant resting full on hers. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to suggest that th\u0027 SV sells McCullough that missin\u0027 four hundred head. That will be th\u0027 best way to turn some of yore cattle into money, an\u0027 it will bring you as much as you can hope to get without startin\u0027 an outfit up th\u0027 trail. If you put a herd on th\u0027 trail, it would have to be a small one this year, an\u0027 there ain\u0027t no profit in drivin\u0027 four hundred cows up to Dodge, \u0027specially th\u0027 kind you\u0027d have to take. You\u0027d have th\u0027 risk an\u0027 th\u0027 worry, an th\u0027 spendin\u0027 of quite some money. This other way you\u0027ll get yore money, an\u0027 McCullough will have th\u0027 wrestlin\u0027 to do. Now, I suggests that you let Cimarron drive four hundred head home with him tomorrow, an\u0027 keep \u0027em handy on th\u0027 Double X for th\u0027 drive herd. They\u0027ll road brand \u0027em an\u0027 hold \u0027em with their own, and when Sherwood gets th\u0027 money, he\u0027ll send yourn to you, an\u0027 you\u0027ll have something to work on.\" \n \n \"And we will be four hundred head nearer bankruptcy,\" growled Arnold, more to give vent to his pessimism, which had become nearly chronic by this time. \n \n \"There will be more than that many turned over to you before winter,\" said Johnny. \"Cattle stealin\u0027 don\u0027t go very long down here, even. Now, don\u0027t ask me nothin\u0027 about it; but I\u0027m wishin\u0027 you\u0027d give me authority to act for you in any little thing that might come up—I might not have time to ride out here for it, then.\" \n \n [266] \n \n \"Why, certainly; and I\u0027ll be glad to have somebody act for me who knows what to do,\" replied Arnold. \n \n \"All right. I\u0027m advisin\u0027 you to tell Cimarron to go ahead with that little trail herd. I\u0027m goin\u0027 out that way now, an\u0027 I\u0027ll speak to him about it if you want me to.\" \n \n \"I think that is a splendid idea,\" enthused Margaret. \"If we did not sell them, they will be a year older next year, and we will have to sell them then, anyhow.\" \n \n \"All right!\" grunted Arnold. \"Sell them. I don\u0027t care what is done, if only I can get out of this cursed bed. And I\u0027ll be out of it tomorrow or know the reason why!\" \n \n \"We\u0027d better have th\u0027 Doc come out an\u0027 look at it,\" said Johnny. \"I\u0027ll be ridin\u0027 to town purty soon an\u0027 I\u0027ll drop in an\u0027 tell him. He shore ought to finish what he started.\" \n \n Margaret\u0027s hand went to his arm. \"Please!\" she pleaded. \"Don\u0027t—don\u0027t have any trouble—we—father can wait a little longer, I\u0027m sure.\" \n \n \"I certainly can, Nelson,\" quickly spoke up the quasi-invalid, \"if it will save you from any trouble. I don\u0027t know just how much I would do for you.\" \n \n \"There won\u0027t be no trouble, at all,\" Johnny gravely assured them. \"Doc an\u0027 I know each other real well. You\u0027ve got no idea how well we get along together. You\u0027d be surprised if you only knowed how prompt he\u0027ll start for here. Why, trouble with me over a little thing like this is th\u0027 last thing he\u0027d think of. You just stay where you are till he sees you an\u0027 says you can get up.\" \n \n [267] \n \n \"That\u0027s the least I can do,\" replied Arnold \"D—n it, man! If I only were up and about, and could get a few good, honest men to work for me, I\u0027d make something out of the SV!\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll be up an\u0027 around before you know it,\" Johnny assured him. \"An\u0027 you won\u0027t have no trouble gettin\u0027 three honest men to ride for you. That parson must \u0027a\u0027 had a good influence on this range, even before he come down to Gunsight. Did I hear Sam Gardner tell him he was tired of workin\u0027 for th\u0027 Triangle?\" he asked Margaret. \"Why, of course you didn\u0027t. Well, I\u0027ll have to ask Sam if I heard right. I\u0027m going to ask you to send to Highbank for three SV stampin\u0027 irons—Arch Wiggins is ridin\u0027 down there tomorrow. They\u0027re real handy—an\u0027 chute brandin\u0027 shore saves a lot of time. They\u0027ll be needed in a month or so. Arch knows a blacksmith that can turn \u0027em out alike as three cartridges.\" \n \n \"You get anything you think we need,\" said Arnold. \"How about some wire for those quicksands?\" \n \n \"They\u0027re fixed to stay fixed,\" answered Johnny. \"Arch an\u0027 that Wood Hallock are great boys when it comes to wire, an\u0027 I\u0027m gamblin\u0027 on that wire stayin\u0027 up till it rusts, which won\u0027t be soon. There\u0027s six strands, an\u0027 they set quite some few more posts. Arch does things right. I reckon he\u0027ll be lookin\u0027 for a job when he gets through visitin\u0027 Highbank. He says as how he\u0027s quittin\u0027 th\u0027 Circle 4. An\u0027 from what I\u0027ve seen of Arch, I like him a lot.\" \n \n \"Tell him to see me before he leaves the ranch,\" exclaimed Arnold. \"Why, we\u0027re sailing along at a[268] great clip. Look here, Nelson, there\u0027s a spare-room here—you come and use it until you ride south. You\u0027re better than a tonic. Quit that hotel—God save the word—and come out here.\" \n \n \"Well, I hardly think I can do that,\" smiled Johnny, \"\u0027though I\u0027m thankin\u0027 you, just th\u0027 same. I\u0027ve got business close to Gunsight that\u0027ll keep me there for quite a spell, but afterward, I\u0027ll mebby spend a couple of days with you.\" \n \n \"Well, come when you can,\" replied Arnold. \"If you think of anything else this ranch needs to get from Highbank, order it. You can tell that Arch that there\u0027s a job here if he wants it. I\u0027ll leave the question of wages to you.\" \n \n \"All right, but I\u0027ll send him in, anyhow,\" said Johnny, arising. \"I\u0027ll be goin\u0027 now. You better stay where you are till th\u0027 Doc comes an\u0027 looks you over,\" and he followed Margaret out. \n \n \"You are sure that you will have no trouble with Doctor Reed?\" she asked, as he stepped onto the porch. \n \n \"Why, no, Ma\u0027am; th\u0027 Doc is seein\u0027 th\u0027 error of his sinful ways, an\u0027 I reckons he\u0027ll do purty near anythin\u0027 I tell him to if I tell him right. An\u0027 of course, I wouldn\u0027t tell him no other way.\" \n \n \"You are a puzzle to me,\" confessed Margaret, smiling. \"I\u0027m never quite sure about you.\" \n \n \"Puzzle?\" He turned his hat over and looked into it as if to find something puzzling. \"Why, Ma\u0027am,\" he said, grinning, daring another deep look into her eyes, \"I\u0027m as simple an\u0027 easy to read as a—as a—[269]Injun. Now if it was you I\u0027d say there was a puzzle—but, pshaw! I never was no good, at all, figgerin\u0027 puzzles. I remember once I was watchin\u0027 some tenderfeet playin\u0027 billiards, when I was in Kansas City, after leavin\u0027 some cattle at th\u0027 yards across th\u0027 river. They did things to them balls that I never thought could be done, an\u0027 they did them easylike. Billiards is mebby an easy game, Ma\u0027am, for them that knows how. It looked plumb easy to me, an\u0027 awful temptin\u0027. I got me a table over in a corner an\u0027 took off my coat. I ain\u0027t never tried it since. Th\u0027 proprietor come a-runnin\u0027 an tells me that th\u0027 blacksmith-shop is down th\u0027 street a couple of blocks. That\u0027s me, Ma\u0027am—my touch ain\u0027t gentle—I can\u0027t help smashin\u0027. An\u0027 when somebody gives me a puzzle to figger out I allus look to see if I can smash through it. But puzzles ain\u0027t made that way I reckon.\" \n \n Margaret stepped back into the kitchen, half closed the door and said, quickly, quietly, although somewhat breathlessly: \"There is no puzzle worth the solving that the right man can\u0027t solve—if he tries hard enough.\" \n \n Johnny started forward, but the door closed in his face and he heard the bar drop, and then the front door slammed. He tensed himself and then relaxed, a smile lighting up his face like a sunrise bathing a granite mountain. \"This weather is bound to change,\" he said, loudly. \"I can feel cyclones in th\u0027 air—an\u0027 I ain\u0027t th\u0027 only one that had better look to their tent pegs!\" He reached Pepper in two leaps, the second of which put him in the saddle, and he dashed off to[270] find Cimarron as though it were a matter of life or death. \n \n The segundo looked up, a covetous expression on his face. The black whirlwind slid to a stop at his feet, a cloud of dust enveloping him and drifting slowly south with the wind. \n \n \"I\u0027m solvin\u0027 puzzles with an axe,\" came the astonishing statement from the heart of the cloud. \"I mean, have you got a match?\" \n \n The round-up boss put his fingers in a vest pocket and produced the desired article. \"I got one; but mebby you ought to roll somethin\u0027 to smoke before you lights it.\" \n \n Johnny scratched his head and burst into a roar of laughter, Cimarron joining him purely because it was infectious. \n \n \"Seein\u0027 where you come from, I\u0027d say you was loco,\" chuckled Cimarron. \"What\u0027s on yore mind besides matches an\u0027 axes?\" \n \n \"Why, I was just wonderin\u0027 if you could take four hundred head of these cows over to th\u0027 Double X, road brand \u0027em with th\u0027 Question Mark, an\u0027 throw \u0027em in with Lin\u0027s hundred. McCullough shore is countin\u0027 on gettin\u0027 five hundred from you fellers, and he shouldn\u0027t be disappointed.\" \n \n \"I can do it unless I lose my health an\u0027 strength,\" answered the boss. \"We ain\u0027t got \u0027em here—but on yore way to town stop an\u0027 tell Slim an\u0027 Larry to pick out as many as they can from that herd they\u0027re holdin\u0027. If we\u0027re still short we can get th\u0027 rest easy enough. Where you goin\u0027 now?\" \n \n [271] \n \n \"To see Arch. I reckon he\u0027s got a new job if he wants it.\" \n \n \"That so?\" replied the round-up boss. \"He is a good man. You aimin\u0027 to be in Dave\u0027s tonight?\" \n \n \"I am.\" \n \n \"Slim an\u0027 Larry will stop there with th\u0027 tally figgers on their way home. Are you reckonin\u0027 there\u0027ll be any blast tonight? They ain\u0027t in no hurry—an\u0027 I\u0027d just as soon come with \u0027em.\" \n \n \"There won\u0027t be no blast—that\u0027ll come later,\" replied Johnny, smiling. \"I only aim to light th\u0027 fuse tonight. Mebby it\u0027s a long one, an\u0027 mebby it\u0027s busted somewhere.\" \n \n \"You move cautious just th\u0027 same after tonight,\" warned Cimarron. \"Some fuses hang fire; others get crossed, which cuts out some of th\u0027 waitin\u0027. You\u0027ve been packin\u0027 in quite some giant, off an\u0027 on. I\u0027d say it\u0027s overcharged, with Squint, Smitty, Wolf, Lang, an\u0027 th\u0027 Doc all packed in together. Don\u0027t you get slack, son.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll be hummin\u0027 like a fiddle string,\" replied Johnny quietly. \"There\u0027s Arch, over there. See you later, mebby.\" \n \n Arch tested an iron and put it back in the fire, and looked up. \"Well,\" he said, smiling cheerfully, \"we\u0027re near through.\" \n \n \"Glad to hear it,\" replied Johnny. \"Are you aimin\u0027 to bum around Highbank, or get yoreself a new job an\u0027 keep out of mischief?\" \n \n \"I knowed that parson wouldn\u0027t have no good effect on you,\" growled Arch, \"seein\u0027 how strong he affected[272] me with my strong mind. What you want to know for? Found somethin\u0027 for my idle hands to do?\" \n \n \"Arnold needs a good man out here steady; two of \u0027em to start with, an\u0027 mebby another later on. I told him that you wasn\u0027t worth a cuss; but bein\u0027 stubborn he says mebby you\u0027ll do.\" \n \n \"I ain\u0027t heard no offer yet,\" grinned Arch, impudently. \n \n \"You ought to be glad that folks will let you hang around,\" retorted Johnny. \"What were you gettin\u0027 on th\u0027 Circle 4?\" \n \n \"Forty-five,\" answered Arch. \"I ain\u0027t no kid, an\u0027 I asks for fifty. They couldn\u0027t see it; so here I am.\" \n \n \"Fifty is yours; but you better see Arnold first. Are you goin\u0027 down to Highbank tomorrow?\" \n \n \"I am, an\u0027 I\u0027m shore set on it,\" answered Arch, firmly, \"An\u0027 when I\u0027m set, I\u0027m set solid. I\u0027m goin\u0027; why?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m glad of it,\" chuckled Johnny. \"You bring back three stampin\u0027 irons for this ranch; an\u0027 be shore that you can get both ends of \u0027em on a cow at th\u0027 same time.\" \n \n \"If I\u0027m totin\u0027 \u0027em with me on my hoss, you can gamble they won\u0027t be no pets of Larry\u0027s,\" laughed Arch. \"Anybody goin\u0027 to be in town tonight?\" \n \n \"I reckon so. I\u0027m dead shore that Fraser will be there. He\u0027s got a plumb affectionate disposition. He\u0027s been follerin\u0027 me around steady since Wolf cashed in. He\u0027s over there in that patch of scrub right now—don\u0027t look!\" \n \n \"I ain\u0027t lookin\u0027, you ignoramus!\" retorted Arch,[273] indignantly. \"I\u0027m comin\u0027 in to have a little of Dave\u0027s fire water tonight, an\u0027 sleep in a bed once more. It looks like rain,\" he observed, scanning the cloudless sky, \"an\u0027 I shore hate a blanket an\u0027 slicker roll when it rains.\" \n \n \"So I see,\" gravely rejoined Johnny. \"I don\u0027t care where you go, of course, if you don\u0027t crowd me. I like plenty of elbowroom when I\u0027m millin\u0027 around indoors keepin\u0027 out of th\u0027 rain. But I don\u0027t figger there\u0027ll be any trouble tonight.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll have plenty of room,\" promised Arch. \"In case you ain\u0027t got enough, sing out an\u0027 we\u0027ll bust th\u0027 front out of th\u0027 Palace.\" He considered a moment. \"Mebby it\u0027ll be just as well to have a couple of friends hangin\u0027 \u0027round outside in th\u0027 dark watchin\u0027 th\u0027 weather. Dave hardly ever pulls down his curtains.\" \n \n \"It won\u0027t be needed—not tonight, anyhow,\" smiled Johnny, his heart warming to the cocky youngster. \"I\u0027m thankin\u0027 you just th\u0027 same, you flathead. Well, so-long!\" and Johnny rode toward town. After he had spoken to Slim about the herd to be collected he sent Pepper into a pace that defied any horse on that range to equal. There was to be no third man present when he visited the Doc. \n \n Arch looked carelessly over the range, stretched the kinks out of his back and let his gaze rest idly for a moment on the distant clump of scrub timber. \"You pore jackass,\" he muttered. \"You\u0027ll mebby be another one of them fellers that didn\u0027t know it was loaded.\" \n \n The Doc glanced idly out of the door and resumed[274] his packing. Big Tom had promised to send the chuck wagon for his effects on the morrow and to give him the extra room in the ranchhouse. The offer had been accepted with reluctance, for the Doc did not like to live in the same house with another, especially if the other was the boss of the house. Visiting was all very well, but he yearned for privacy, and there was good reason for it besides a natural inclination. He had little in common with the minds about him on the range, for he was a student and a reader, and his book shelves held a literature far above the understanding of those around him. He had no choice, however, for the time had come to get out of an impending storm. Being energetic, and impatient to finish a disagreeable task, he had kept at it and there now remained only a few odds and ends to be collected. He drew the corners of an old blanket over the bundle of clothing, extra bedding, and miscellaneous linen, pulled them tightly together and knelt on the bundle, straining at the rope. He had just finished the knot when a moving shadow on the east wall caught his attention and made him reach instinctively for the gun in its shoulder holster; but he checked his hand in mid-air, and just in time. There was only one man whom he had reason to fear, and that man had killed Wolf Forbes under the noses of his own outfit and in an even break; and what chance had he, a novice, against such gunplay? He let his hand drop to his side and slowly looked around. \n \n \"That was shore close, Doc,\" remarked a quiet but not unfriendly voice. \"You don\u0027t never need to reach for no gun for me if you acts square. I ain\u0027t on th\u0027[275] warpath, at all; I\u0027m peaceful, I am; an\u0027 I come down to ask you somethin\u0027 that nobody but you can tell me.\" \n \n The Doc arose, anger glinting in his eyes from the memory of a former indignity. \"Well, what do you want?\" he growled. \"Framing up another kidnapping?\" \n \n \"There you go,\" accused Johnny in great disgust. \"You shore hop on th\u0027 prod as quick as any man I ever knowed. I only come down to ask you how soon Arnold can get out of bed an\u0027 get some use of that laig of his\u0027n.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" replied the Doc \"Not knowing, I wouldn\u0027t care to say. I\u0027ve not been out there since.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s all ribbed to get up,\" continued Johnny. \"An\u0027 there\u0027s this about things: Folks that act square with me allus find that I act square with them. An\u0027 I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you that them fellers will mebby be plumb lucky durin\u0027 th\u0027 next few weeks. I\u0027ve been foolin\u0027 a lot down here—holdin\u0027 back, sort of; but I quit foolin\u0027 th\u0027 day I went down an\u0027 dug Wolf out of his outfit. I\u0027m aimin\u0027 to be serious these days. You said you don\u0027t know about Arnold—but it ain\u0027t much of a job to make shore, is it? You only got to take th\u0027 rough goin\u0027 dead east of this shack for a little ways until you get into Green Valley—an\u0027 from there on th\u0027 ridin\u0027 is easy. There\u0027s too much confusion along th\u0027 reg\u0027lar trail with them touchy Double X punchers ridin\u0027 around up there. An\u0027 if you left right away you could get back in plenty of time for yore supper. Looks like yo\u0027re movin\u0027?\" \n \n \"I am,\" replied the other. \"I might go down to Highbank, and start practicing.\" \n \n [276] \n \n \"You might,\" admitted Johnny; \"but I\u0027m sayin\u0027 that you don\u0027t have to go to th\u0027 Bar H ranchhouse to keep out of trouble. I\u0027ve passed you my word—you play square with me an\u0027 you\u0027ll mebby find this shack is safer for you than that ranchhouse ever will be if you don\u0027t play square. I\u0027m meanin\u0027 this, Doc.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t see where the question of safety comes in at all. I\u0027ve found this place pretty lonely, sometimes, and I\u0027m getting tired of it. What\u0027s more, I\u0027m squatting on the SV range.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m glad to hear you say that last, an\u0027 I reckon mebby it is lonely,\" replied Johnny, \"\u0027though it shouldn\u0027t be. Yo\u0027re only a couple of miles from town, an\u0027 you got a good cayuse. There\u0027s some good boys up in town, too. You ought to ride in more often an\u0027 get friendly \u0027stead of holin\u0027 up like a bear dodgin\u0027 th\u0027 winter. An\u0027 as for squattin\u0027, why I\u0027ll say th\u0027 SV won\u0027t say nothin\u0027 at all to you about that, \u0027specially after you tells some of th\u0027 boys in town that you are only squattin\u0027 down here an\u0027 don\u0027t lay no claim to this land. Doc, th\u0027 time is shore comin\u0027 when nearly everybody on this range will be choosin\u0027 sides or settin\u0027 on th\u0027 fence—an\u0027 them as takes to th\u0027 fence should set awful tight an\u0027 still. But gettin\u0027 back to my reason for visitin\u0027 you: I reckon Arnold is plumb sick of layin\u0027 abed; I\u0027m shore I\u0027d be. You can\u0027t say when he should get up?\" \n \n The Doc was looking at him intently and his frown had slowly disappeared. He was no fool, had no real affection for Big Tom, and he was beginning to see a great light. He turned deliberately, yanked the knot loose and let the blanket open and spread out over the[277] floor. Picking up his bag, he considered a moment. \"Hazarding a guess, I\u0027d say that he has another week in bed. Did you notice any fever, any flush, or anything else that seemed abnormal to you?\" he asked. \n \n \"Nothin\u0027 but stubbornness an\u0027 a grouch like a she bear with cubs,\" answered Johnny. \"I reckon he stays on th\u0027 prod purty much when there ain\u0027t no strangers around. He must make life excitin\u0027 for his family. Now that he\u0027s gettin\u0027 ambitious, he\u0027ll be worse.\" \n \n \"Well, I\u0027ll go prepared for anything, anyhow. If you are riding down this way tonight drop in and I\u0027ll tell you how I found him. It was a clean break and everything was in his favor.\" \n \n \"I reckon I\u0027ll be too busy in town tonight,\" replied Johnny. \"I got a job to do. If you ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 special to keep you here an\u0027 feel like seein\u0027 th\u0027 boys, ride up an\u0027 spend th\u0027 evenin\u0027 with us. We\u0027ll be glad to see you.\" \n \n The Doc listened intently. \"Who\u0027s that riding up the trail?\" he asked. \n \n Johnny looked deep into his eyes, smiled cynically, banished his suspicions, and glanced out of the window. \"I reckoned so,\" he muttered. \"That\u0027s Fraser, goin\u0027 back to look for somethin\u0027 he\u0027s lost. He\u0027ll mebby find it tonight up in Dave\u0027s, if he looks hard enough. Times are shore changin\u0027 down here.\" \n \n The Doc stepped forward and passed out. \"When you leave, close the door behind you. The dust gets on my nerves and there will be plenty of it flying with this wind,\" and he walked briskly to the little corral. \n \n Johnny watched him bridle and saddle the horse,[278] mount, and canter away straight for the rough going east of the trail. Pulling the door shut behind him, he walked to the brush-filled hollow where he had left his horse, mounted, and set off at a lope for Gunsight. \n \n \"Mebby he means it,\" he soliloquized. \"If he does, all right. I gave him a chance to go for that shoulder holster when I looked out to see who was ridin\u0027 up th\u0027 trail, but that don\u0027t mean much, for he might have figgered it was too risky. Mebby he\u0027s aimin\u0027 to set on th\u0027 fence waitin\u0027 to see how things\u0027ll settle down. That\u0027s all right, too—it\u0027s his natural play—but I\u0027m keepin\u0027 cases on him just th\u0027 same. He\u0027s had his warnin\u0027\"—he shrugged his shoulders expressively and looked up the trail where he thought he could distinguish Fraser\u0027s horse in front of the Palace. \"An\u0027 that\u0027s all right, too,\" he growled, \"he\u0027s where he\u0027ll be handy.\" After a moment he slapped Pepper\u0027s shoulder. \"Sorry, little hoss,\" he growled, \"but mebby you\u0027ll have to play pack animal for a while if I\u0027m goin\u0027 to watch them mavericks until after McCullough gets that Bar H herd. Didn\u0027t I tell you we\u0027d likely be popular, an\u0027 unpopular? Well, it\u0027s shore comin\u0027 true.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1984/56741.html","bookId":677,"book":{"id":677,"title":"Johnny Nelson","description":"简介： The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings.
