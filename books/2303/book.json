She barely knows him, but there\u0027s no resisting the connection she feels. . . \\n There\u0027s one important detail Erik hasn\u0027t gotten around to telling her yet. He\u0027s a powerful vampire out to hunt the Blood Thief who is draining young vampires all over the city--and who has just raised the stakes by destroying one of Erik\u0027s friends. To Erik, Daisy is a bright spot of innocence in a world of darkness and menace. He\u0027ll do anything--even lie to her--to keep her safe and pure. \\n If only he knew that Daisy has something of her own to hide. . .\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1.jpg","author":"Amanda Ashley","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
