With a moan that was almost a growl, he crushed her body against his as he deepened the kiss. Maybe he couldn\u0027t be a part of her future, but she was here now, and he was determined to make the most of whatever time they had together.\n Erik grinned when, a moment later, he heard the sound of the front door slamming shut. \"You\u0027d better go,\" he murmured, dropping a kiss on the tip of her nose. \"Before your brother has a heart attack.\"\n \"I\u0027ll miss you,\" Daisy said, her gaze searching his. \"Come as early as you can.\"\n \"Count on it.\"\n \"Erik...\" She stroked his cheek, reluctant to let him go, afraid she might never see him again.\n \"I won\u0027t leave you, Daisy, not as long as he\u0027s out there.\"\n \"And when the danger\u0027s past?\" she asked, her voice so low only a vampire could hear it.\n \"Let\u0027s not worry about that now, okay?\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to lose you.\"\n \"Dammit, Daisy, what do you want from me?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Maybe you\u0027ll tell me when you find out.\" He kissed her again because she was looking up at him, her eyes filled with confusion, because she was so close and smelled so good. Because, oh, hell, when did a man need a reason to kiss a beautiful woman? One last kiss, and then he headed for his car before he took her there, in the damp grass with her brother watching from the window.\n Daisy touched her fingertips to her lips as she watched Erik drive away. She could feel Alex\u0027s accusing gaze boring into her back, knew that, sooner or later, she would have to go into the house and face him.\n Putting it off wouldn\u0027t make it any easier. With a sigh of resignation, she went in to face the music.\n Chapter 22\n Alex was waiting for her when she walked in the door. \"I guess you\u0027re gonna tell me that was just a good-night kiss between friends?\"\n Daisy tossed her handbag on the sofa table. \"Oh, for crying out loud. He just kissed me like that because he knew you were watching.\"\n \"Yeah, right. Dammit, Daisy, Erik Delacourt is after something. Why can\u0027t you see that?\"\n \"None of this is any of your business,\" Daisy retorted. \"I\u0027m over twenty-one. You\u0027re not my father...\"\n \"No, but I am,\" a deep voice said.\n Daisy spun around to see her father coming down the stairs, belting his favorite ratty bathrobe around him.\n Noah O\u0027Donnell was tall and lean, with shaggy brown hair and intelligent brown eyes. A narrow scar, souvenir from a fight with a vampire, bisected his left cheek. He glanced from Daisy to Alex and back again. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n Daisy hurried toward her father and threw her arms around him. \"Nothing. Alex is just being Alex. I don\u0027t know how you stand him.\"\n Noah O\u0027Donnell grinned at his daughter. \"Who\u0027s Erik Delacourt and what does Alex think he\u0027s after?\"\n \"He\u0027s after Daisy,\" Alex said, his tone sour. \"If you\u0027d seen the way they were kissing a minute ago...\"\n \"Well, you can\u0027t blame the man,\" Noah said. \"After all, Daisy is a lovely young woman, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with kissing.\"\n \"There\u0027s something wrong with Delacourt,\" Alex said sourly. \"Something...\"\n \"You just don\u0027t like him,\" Daisy said. \"I don\u0027t know why, and I don\u0027t care. I like him.\"\n \"Here, now, daughter, how serious are things between you and this man?\"\n \"They\u0027re not serious. I hardly know him.\"\n \"I see.\" Noah ran a hand through his hair, his expression suddenly serious. \"What brings the two of you home at this hour of the night?\"\n \"Well, uh...\" Alex cleared his throat. \"We had some trouble in LA.\"\n \"What kind of trouble?\" Noah asked.\n \"I went looking for Costain,\" Alex said, \"and I...\" He glanced at Daisy. \"We found him.\"\n Noah glanced between Daisy and Alex. \"Go on.\"\n \"It was a close call,\" Daisy said. \"Alex was badly hurt, at least I thought so at the time.\" She couldn\u0027t tell her brother or her father how close Alex had been to death, couldn\u0027t explain how Erik had saved his life. \"I took him to Erik\u0027s--\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you take him to the nearest hospital?\" her father asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know. I guess I panicked. Anyway, Erik gave him first aid and--\"\n \"You didn\u0027t tell him Alex had been attacked by a vampire, did you?\"\n \"No, of course not,\" Daisy said, thinking quickly. \"I said he\u0027d been beat up by a man who was stalking me. Anyway, I decided we should get out of town and Erik offered to bring us home.\"\n \"I see. And where is he now?\"\n \"He went to find a hotel.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you invite him to stay here?\" Noah asked. \"After all, we owe him a favor.\"\n Daisy shot a withering glance at her brother. \"He didn\u0027t want to stay under the same roof as Alex.\"\n \"Well, you\u0027re both home, safe and sound, and that\u0027s what matters most. Why don\u0027t you both go get some sleep. We\u0027ll talk more about this in the morning.\"\n Daisy nodded, glad for a chance to escape the room and any further interrogation by her brother or her father. \"Good night, Dad.\"\n \"Good night, daughter.\"\n With a last look at Alex, Daisy went upstairs. The house seemed empty without her mom bustling around, offering cookies and hot chocolate, acting as a buffer between Daisy and Alex. In spite of her affection for her brother, they had butted heads since they were kids.\n Going home was like going back in time, Daisy thought as she stepped into her bedroom. It looked exactly the same as it had when she first moved out. Beneath assorted rock-star posters, the walls were pink with white woodwork. Pink polka-dot curtains hung at the windows; a bright pink quilt covered the bed. A dozen stuffed penguins of varying sizes fought for space on the shelf over her desk.\n With a sigh, Daisy changed into her pajamas, washed her face, and brushed her teeth. After turning out the light, she climbed into bed and closed her eyes, asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.\n Erik stood in the shadows outside Daisy\u0027s house, watching as the lights inside went out, one by one. He listened as she snuggled into her bed, waited until the soft, even sound of her breathing told him she was asleep before he got into his car and drove away.\n With no destination in mind, he drove through the city until he found what he was looking for. The Vampire Vault was a private club similar to La Morte Rouge, a hangout for vampires and those who served them. One had to be a vampire, or be invited by a vampire, to gain entrance. Like La Morte Rouge, the Vault wasn\u0027t listed in the phone book or online.\n Erik parked his car in the lot, then knocked on the back door. The vampire who opened it looked like he had just stepped off the set of an old Dracula movie. He wore a black suit, white tie, and a long black cloak.\n The doorman murmured, \"Good evening,\" in a remarkable impression of a young Bela Lugosi as he gestured for Erik to enter.\n A narrow hallway opened onto the club\u0027s main floor. A quick glance revealed a long bar at the far end of the room. A trio of waiters served the fifteen or twenty people seated there. High-backed booths lined one wall. Small tables adorned with black cloths were located at intervals around the room. Each table was decorated with a black vase and a blood-red rose. The lighting was dim, the air filled with the scent of beating hearts and the smell of fresh blood.\n A young female vampire sat at the grand piano located on a raised platform. Clad in a long white gown, her skin pale, she looked almost ghostlike. It seemed her fingers barely touched the keys as she played. Erik listened a moment, trying to place the song, then shrugged. Perhaps it was a composition of her own making.\n He had barely stepped into the room when a leggy blonde clad in a low-cut, skintight emerald green gown and silver high heels slithered up to him. He couldn\u0027t help noticing that her figure went in and out in all the right places.\n \"I\u0027ve never seen you in here before,\" she said, her voice a throaty purr.\n \"I haven\u0027t been here in quite some time.\"\n \"I hope you\u0027ll come back often.\"\n \"I might.\" He couldn\u0027t help staring at her. It was obvious that she wasn\u0027t wearing anything under the gown. Her skin was smooth and unblemished save for a half-healed bite mark on the inside of her left elbow.\n She smiled up at him. \"I\u0027m Jade.\"\n Erik nodded. \"What are you offering?\" Some mortals offered only blood. Some blood and sex.\n \"Anything you want.\" She scraped her nails lightly down his cheek. \"Are you interested?\"\n He nodded again. What male in his right mind would be able to refuse such an offer?\n Her smile widened as she took his hand and led him up a narrow, winding staircase, then down a long, carpeted hallway. Most of the doors had DO NOT DISTURB signs on them.\n Jade bypassed the first empty room, then entered the last room on the right.\n Erik followed her inside. It was a large room. The walls were white. Red curtains hung at the window. A round bed covered with a red quilt took up most of the room. A half-open door revealed a bathroom.\n Jade sat on the bed. A hidden slit in her skirt parted to expose one long, creamy white thigh. \"What\u0027s your pleasure?\"\n \"Just a drink.\"\n \"Nothing more?\"\n He shook his head. There was a time when he would have taken everything Jade was offering, he thought with some regret. But that was before a certain sexy Blood Thief entered his life. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-30.html","bookId":2303,"book":{"id":2303,"title":"Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1) \n Daisy O\u0027Donnell doesn\u0027t get the attraction some women feel for vampires.
