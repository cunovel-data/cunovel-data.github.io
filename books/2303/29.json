Alex looked at Erik. \"I take it you\u0027re not having dessert.\" \"No.\" \"No taste for sweets?\" Erik glanced at Daisy, who was standing at the dessert table. \"It depends on the sweet,\" he remarked. Alex frowned as he followed Erik\u0027s gaze. \"What are your intentions toward my sister?\" \"Intentions?\" \"You know what I mean. She said you\u0027ve only known each other a couple of weeks, but it doesn\u0027t look that way to me. I see the way she looks at you,\" Alex said, leaning forward. \"The way you look at her.\" \"We\u0027re attracted to one another,\" Erik said mildly. \"It\u0027s quite normal.\" \"Is it? You\u0027re hiding something from her, something...\" Alex frowned. \"I don\u0027t know what it is, but you\u0027re no good for her.\" \"Perhaps not,\" Erik said candidly. \"But she\u0027s very good for me.\" \"What\u0027s good for you?\" Daisy asked, taking her seat beside Erik. \"You are,\" he said, smiling. Alex pushed his plate away. \"I\u0027ll wait for you in the car.\" Daisy gestured at the pie on her tray. \"What about your dessert?\" \"Forget it,\" Alex said curtly. \"I\u0027m not hungry anymore.\" Rising, he stalked out of the restaurant. \"He\u0027s not going to make this easy, is he?\" Erik remarked. \"He\u0027s never made anything easy,\" Daisy muttered. \"Do you want to go?\" \"No, finish your dessert.\" He turned to look out the window. The sun was still visible above the horizon. \"Take as long as you like.\" Daisy wasn\u0027t sure she could endure another day and night on the road with Erik and her brother. Last night, after they left the restaurant, the atmosphere in the car had been tense, to say the least. Daisy had managed to distract Alex while Erik transported himself from the restaurant into the backseat. Pleading a headache, he had pulled the blanket over his head. Daisy had taken a turn at the wheel, grateful to have something to occupy her mind. Alex had sulked in the passenger seat. At dusk, Alex had climbed into the backseat and Daisy had relinquished the wheel to Erik. And now it was night again, and Erik was driving. \"How much longer?\" Daisy asked. \"We should be there a little after midnight,\" Erik replied. They had made good time since leaving the motel three nights ago. He was reasonably certain they would be safe once they reached Boston. He and Rhys had never exchanged blood; there was no blood link between the two of them, no way for Rhys to find him. It was different with Alex; Rhys had tasted Alex\u0027s blood, which might allow the vampire to track him over a short distance, but even Rhys Costain couldn\u0027t follow a scent that was twenty-six hundred miles away. Unless Alex had also tasted Costain\u0027s blood. Of course, that was a question Erik couldn\u0027t ask Daisy\u0027s brother, since he wasn\u0027t supposed to know that a vampire was after the two of them. But it was something they needed to know. He would have to ask Daisy about it. He didn\u0027t know why he hadn\u0027t thought of it sooner. Blood was a strong bond. Erik had drunk from Daisy and she had tasted his blood, which had created a bond between them, one that Daisy remained unaware of due to the fact that Erik kept his mind closed to her. He would always be able to find her; if he so desired, he could read her thoughts. If he opened his mind to her, the link between them would work both ways, allowing her access to his thoughts as well. Such a bond grew stronger with each exchange of blood, forging a connection between vampire and mortal that could only be broken by death. Erik swore softly. If Alex and Rhys had exchanged blood, there was no point in running away. Rhys would be able to home in on Alex\u0027s blood whether Alex was across the street or across the country. Erik slid a glance at Daisy. Her eyes were closed; her lashes lay like dark fans against her rosy cheeks. In all his years, Erik had never created another vampire, never bonded with a mortal, mainly because he had never met anyone, male or female, he wanted to be bound to, until he met Daisy. And now, through some cosmic quirk of fate, he shared a blood link with the notorious Blood Thief. Needing to clear his head, Erik lowered the car window. A blood-red moon smiled down on him; the cool night air caressed his skin like the hand of a familiar friend. He had learned to love being a vampire just as he had grown to love the night--the sounds, the silence, the sense of belonging. He was a creature of the night now, one with the darkness in ways no mortal could or would ever understand. With his enhanced night vision, nothing was hidden from him. He saw the brown and white dog skulking through the shadows, the barn owl perched in an oak tree alongside the highway, the mouse foolishly trying to cross the road. To be a vampire was to see things, hear things, that were beyond the limited abilities of mortals. Many vampires, drunk on the power of what they were, began to regard mortals as little more than food. Rhys was one of them. He had been a vampire for so long, he had forgotten what it was like to be human. To Erik\u0027s dismay, there were times when he caught himself thinking along the same lines, viewing mortals as little more than sustenance. When that happened, he made himself stop and think about his wife and children, about the love they had shared, their hopes and dreams. Vampire though he might be, he had always tried to hang on to some vestige of his humanity, to remember what it had been like to be a mortal man, a husband and a father. His gaze slid over the woman beside him. She was a young female in the prime of her life with her whole future ahead of her. One day, she would give up being a Blood Thief, settle down with a decent young man, and raise a couple of kids. Whether he liked it or not, a 325-year-old vampire had no place in Daisy O\u0027Donnell\u0027s life or her future. Hearing a subtle change in Alex\u0027s breathing, Erik glanced in the rearview mirror. Daisy\u0027s brother sat up, stretching. He grimaced when he met Erik\u0027s gaze. Erik grinned wryly. Alex made no secret of the fact that he didn\u0027t like Erik dating his sister. Good thing he didn\u0027t know the truth, Erik mused, his grin widening. \"According to Daisy\u0027s directions, we should almost be there,\" Erik remarked. \"Yeah,\" Alex said. \"Take the next off ramp and turn right at the first stop sign.\" Erik glanced in the rearview mirror again. \"You want to tell me why you dislike me so much?\" \"I don\u0027t trust you.\" \"Any particular reason why you feel that way?\" \"Nothing I can put my finger on, but in my gut, I know you\u0027re not what you seem.\" Erik grunted softly, impressed with O\u0027Donnell\u0027s intuition. \"Whatever you might think, your sister is safe with me. Believe that if you believe nothing else.\" \"What do you want from her?\" \"What does any man want from a beautiful woman?\" Erik grinned inwardly as Alex\u0027s face turned an angry shade of purple. \"Calm down before you bust a blood vessel,\" Erik said. \"I\u0027m kidding.\" \"I doubt it,\" Alex muttered. Erik met Alex\u0027s gaze in the mirror again. \"I\u0027m in love with her,\" he said quietly. \"I know you don\u0027t approve and you\u0027d rather I wasn\u0027t here, but I really don\u0027t give a damn what you think. She\u0027s in danger, and until she\u0027s safe again, I\u0027ll be nearby whether you like it or not.\" \"Turn left here,\" Alex said gruffly. \"We\u0027re home.\" Daisy woke up when the car came to a stop. She glanced out the window, overcome with a sense of peace when she saw the light shining in the front window. Her mother always left a light burning in the window when one of her children was away from home, whether they were going to be gone for an evening or indefinitely. She looked up when Erik opened the car door and offered her his hand. \"Here we are.\" She nodded as she placed her hand in his and let him help her out of the car. Erik tossed his keys to Alex. \"Why don\u0027t you get the bags?\" Daisy tugged on Erik\u0027s hand. \"You\u0027re staying here, with us, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" What was she thinking? Of course he wouldn\u0027t want to stay with her, not when her father and brothers were hunters. \"Will I see you tomorrow night?\" \"I\u0027ll be here.\" \"Where are you going to stay?\" \"I\u0027ll find a place. Don\u0027t worry about me. And don\u0027t let that brother of yours do anything stupid. If you\u0027re smart, you\u0027ll both stay indoors as soon as the sun starts to set. I doubt if Rhys knows where you are, but it\u0027s not worth taking the chance. If he finds Alex, he\u0027ll kill him. And you, too. Don\u0027t doubt it for a minute.\" Daisy swallowed hard. If he was trying to scare her, he\u0027d done a first-rate job. \"Do you know if Alex ingested any of Rhys\u0027s blood?\" \"Drank it, you mean?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I don\u0027t think so. Why?\" \"Let\u0027s just say things will be less complicated if he didn\u0027t.\" \"Less complicated?\" Daisy frowned at him. \"In what way?\" \"Rhys has your brother\u0027s scent, but I\u0027m pretty sure he can\u0027t track that this far. If your brother and Rhys exchanged blood, Rhys will be able to find him no matter where he goes. If they didn\u0027t, then Alex is probably safe here.\" Erik ran his knuckles down her cheek. \"And so are you.\" \"I never thought to ask him about that.\" \"Well, if Rhys doesn\u0027t show up in the next day or so, there\u0027s probably nothing to worry about.\" \"Should I talk to Alex about it?\" \"Probably wouldn\u0027t hurt.\" \"All right.\" Needing to touch her, he ran his hands up and down her arms. \"Until we know for sure, remember what I said about staying inside.\" \"I will.\" \"Hey, Daisy,\" Alex called from the porch. \"You comin\u0027?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-29.html","bookId":2303,"book":{"id":2303,"title":"Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1)","description":"Storyline: Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1) Daisy O\u0027Donnell doesn\u0027t get the attraction some women feel for vampires.
