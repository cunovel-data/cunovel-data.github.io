Minutes later, they were on the 101 freeway headed toward the beach. Daisy stared out the window as Van Morrison crooned \"Someone Like You.\" It was one of her favorite songs.\n She slid a sideways glance at Erik. Why had she agreed to this? Last night, she had been reluctant to get in a car with him; tonight, she had done it without a qualm.\n She was trying to figure out what had changed since last night when he said, \"You\u0027re very quiet.\"\n \"Just listening to the music. It\u0027s one of my favorites.\"\n \"Yeah, Morrison\u0027s got a great sound.\"\n Daisy nodded. What was she doing, driving off to the beach at night with a man she hardly knew? What was it about him that made her good sense fly right out the window whenever he was around? If she told him she had changed her mind, would he take her back to the club?\n Her stomach was in knots when Erik pulled off the freeway forty minutes later. There were no other cars parked off the road, and no other people on the beach, as far as Daisy could see. Once again, she asked herself what she was doing there.\n She looked up when Erik opened her door and there, in his eyes, she saw the answer to her question. Right or wrong, for better or worse, for reasons she didn\u0027t pretend to understand, she knew her fate was somehow tied to his.\n Daisy took off her sandals; Erik removed his boots and socks, and they walked hand in hand along the shore, the damp sand squishing between their toes.\n It was a beautiful night. Millions of stars twinkled brightly overhead, reflecting their light on the gently rolling waves that kissed the shore. A bright yellow moon smiled down on them.\n \"So, how about that swim?\" Erik asked.\n \"I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m not into skinny-dipping on public beaches.\"\n \"No? Then how about a quick dip in your underwear? It probably covers as much as today\u0027s swimwear.\"\n Daisy weighed the pros and cons for a moment, but in the end, it was the cool water lapping at her ankles that made the decision. At least that\u0027s what she told herself. And it was partly true. But mainly, it was her desire to see Erik in the buff that made her agree.\n She turned her back to him while she undressed. This was so stupid. If a shark ate her, she would have no one to blame but herself.\n \"Ready?\"\n She turned at the sound of his voice. Clothed, he was gorgeous. Clad in nothing but a pair of black briefs, he was a Greek god come to life. His body was muscular without being bulky. His legs were long and firm, his shoulders broad. His abs looked rock hard; his biceps tempted her touch.\n He grinned under her blatant regard. \"Like what you see?\"\n She nodded. What was there not to like?\n \"Good. I like what I see, too.\" He took a step toward her. \"You\u0027re beautiful, Daisy.\" His fingertips glided down her cheek, along her neck, across her collarbone to settle in the hollow of her throat. \"Truly beautiful.\"\n A blush warmed her cheeks, more from the admiration in his eyes than his words. \"Thank you.\"\n \"Come on,\" he said, and taking her hand in his, he turned and ran toward the water.\n Daisy shrieked as she followed Erik into the waves. The water had felt cool on her bare feet; it felt downright cold when it reached her knees, and higher.\n She was thinking of turning around and swimming back to shore as fast as she could when Erik grabbed her hand. Floating on his back, he lifted her onto his chest so that her body covered his.\n \"What are you doing?\" she exclaimed, certain they would both go under, amazed when they didn\u0027t. It was like surfing on a human surfboard.\n \"You okay?\" he asked, a hint of amusement in his voice.\n \"Yes, but...\"\n \"Relax, I won\u0027t let you drown.\"\n He floated out past the waves to where the water was as smooth as black glass.\n \"Still okay?\" he asked.\n She glanced to the right and to the left. No fins that she could see. \"I guess so.\"\n \"Are you afraid of the ocean?\"\n \"Ever since I saw Jaws.\"\n Erik grinned at her. \"There\u0027s nothing to be afraid of.\" Animals avoided him, especially those that hunted for their food. Something about one predator recognizing another, he supposed.\n Nothing to be afraid of, Daisy thought, except drowning or being stung by a jellyfish, or attacked by a shark.\n It was oddly exhilarating, and a little frightening, floating there, just the two of them, alone in the vast ocean at night. Gradually, Daisy relaxed enough to rest her cheek on Erik\u0027s chest. Lying there, she noticed the reflection of the moon on the water, the way the moonlight glistened on the waves.\n For all that it was exciting to drift on the sea with Erik, she was relieved when, at last, he made for the shore.\n It was good to feel solid ground beneath her feet, Daisy thought when they reached the edge of the water. Dropping down on the sand, she gazed up at Erik. He was truly a remarkable human being, she mused, and certainly stronger than any man she had ever known. She would have bet her house and everything in it that Erik couldn\u0027t float and carry her at the same time.\n He sat down beside her, his thigh brushing intimately against hers. The touch of his damp flesh sent a shiver down her spine, a shiver that had nothing to do with his cool skin and everything to do with his nearness, and the look in his dark eyes.\n He\u0027s going to kiss me.\n The thought had no sooner crossed her mind than he was leaning toward her, his hand curling around her nape as his mouth covered hers. The touch of his lips, though cool and slightly salty, ignited a fire deep within her.\n She moaned softly as he eased back on the sand, carrying her with him, so that her body lay sprawled across his, their legs entwined.\n Erik slid his hand up into the thick fall of her hair, his fingers tangling in the damp strands. A deep breath carried the scent of strawberry shampoo and warm, womanly flesh with an underlying scent of musk that told him she was as aroused as he.\n He kissed her again, his hands sliding restlessly over her bare back, her shoulders, skimming the curve of her breasts. She moaned low in her throat, a primal sound that aroused his senses. All of them. The hunger stirred within him. She was here. She was his for the taking. He could steal a taste, or take it all. When his fangs brushed his tongue, he turned his head away.\n \"Don\u0027t stop,\" she murmured, her voice low, breathy with desire.\n He gazed up at her, momentarily at a loss as to what to do next. He hadn\u0027t let himself care deeply for a mortal woman in centuries, not since Celestine DuBois. His affair with her had ended badly, as such things usually did, and he had vowed he would never again get emotionally involved with a mortal female. They were too fragile, too easily wounded. Too easily broken.\n But Daisy...ah, his fair flower. Her very being spoke to something deep within him, something he had thought dead long ago, along with his humanity. What was he to do with her?\n A streak of decency he had forgotten he possessed pushed its way through the hunger. Rising, he took her hands in his and pulled her gently to her feet.\n \"We should go,\" he said, brushing a bit of sand from her hair.\n She blinked up at him, her eyes wide, her lips slightly parted.\n He brushed a kiss across her cheek. \"It\u0027s late.\"\n Stunned by the abrupt turn of events, Daisy slipped her clothes on over her damp bra and panties. Carrying her sandals in one hand, she followed Erik. Barefooted, they trudged up the beach to where he had parked the car.\n She glanced at him from time to time on the ride home. Had she done something wrong? One minute, they were going at it hot and heavy and the next he was telling her it was late.\n With a shake of her head, she stared out the window. It was probably just as well that he had called a halt to their lovemaking. If he had kept kissing her like that, there was no telling what might have happened.\n When they reached the Crypt\u0027s parking lot, Daisy stepped into her sandals. Erik opened the door for her, then walked her to her car. Feeling somewhat confused, Daisy reached into her handbag for her keys. Would he kiss her good night? Or good-bye?\n Not quite meeting his eyes, she murmured, \"Good night.\"\n \"Dammit!\"\n Startled, she looked up at him.\n He raked a hand through his hair. \"The night shouldn\u0027t end like this. Let\u0027s go inside and have a drink.\"\n \"You said it was late.\"\n \"It\u0027s not that late.\" He smiled down at her. In spite of his vow to avoid mortal females, he was involved with Daisy O\u0027Donnell, for better or worse. \"What do you say?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so. I need to shower and wash my hair.\"\n \"You look fine to me.\"\n \"I doubt that. But I\u0027d be happy to meet you here tomorrow night for that drink.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I can wait that long.\"\n Daisy shook her head. No way was she going inside looking the way she did.\n \"How about if I meet you back here in half an hour?\" he coaxed.\n \"You don\u0027t give up, do you?\"\n \"Not when I see something I want,\" he replied, stunned by the realization that all his good intentions in the world weren\u0027t going to keep him from pursuing this woman. \"Say yes.\"\n \"All right.\" What the heck, she didn\u0027t have to get up early in the morning. \"But you\u0027d better make it forty-five minutes.\"\n Daisy drove home, took a shower, and washed and dried her hair in record time, her stomach fluttering all the while. In spite of what had happened on the beach, he wanted her. After pulling on a gauzy white skirt and a pale pink tank top, she stepped into her sandals, grabbed her handbag and her keys, and drove back to the Crypt. Erik\u0027s car was already in the parking lot when she arrived. After locking her handbag in the car, she pocketed her keys and hurried into the club.\n He was waiting for her at the bar, looking gorgeous in a black turtleneck sweater and black jeans. His welcoming smile warmed her right down to her toes.\n \"Hi,\" she murmured, taking the seat to his right. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-7.html","bookId":2303,"book":{"id":2303,"title":"Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1) \n Daisy O\u0027Donnell doesn\u0027t get the attraction some women feel for vampires.
