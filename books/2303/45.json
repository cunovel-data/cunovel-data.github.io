She didn\u0027t know who had put out a hit on the Master of the City, but she was glad it wasn\u0027t her.\\n\\n Erik\u0027s head snapped up as a sliver of light penetrated the window over the computer. As one, he and Rhys stepped away from the desk.\\n\\n Daisy reached over Alex\u0027s head to draw the curtains. \"Sorry about that.\"\\n\\n Rhys shrugged. \"Force of habit. It doesn\u0027t really bother me much anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Speak for yourself,\" Erik muttered.\\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know about the rest of you, but I\u0027m going to bed,\" Daisy said, and then bit down on her lower lip as she recalled that Rhys had been sleeping in her closet.\\n\\n Erik slipped his arm around Daisy\u0027s shoulders. \"Rhys will find another closet, won\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Never let it be said I stood in the way of true love,\" Rhys muttered.\\n\\n Alex frowned at Daisy, clearly not liking the fact that Rhys would be sleeping in his closet, since Daisy\u0027s house only had two bedrooms.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" Daisy said, smiling sweetly at Alex. \"Only one vampire to a bedroom, and Erik is sharing mine.\"\\n\\n And so saying, she took Erik by the hand and led him up the stairs to her room.\\n\\n Erik closed the door behind them. \"Second thoughts?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"No, why?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. They had made love, they had slept together, but he had never succumbed to the Dark Sleep in her presence. Or in anyone else\u0027s, for that matter.\\n\\n Daisy looked at him, her brow furrowed, and then murmured, \"Oh,\" as comprehension dawned.\\n\\n \"I can rest outside.\"\\n\\n \"Outside? Where?\"\\n\\n \"In the ground.\"\\n\\n \"Why would you want to do that?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say I wanted to. I was just thinking about you, about how you\u0027d feel sharing your bed with...\"\\n\\n \"A sleeping vampire?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t snore or talk in your sleep, do you?\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m pretty sure I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Daisy yawned behind her hand. \"Well, I don\u0027t know about you, but I can\u0027t stay awake any longer.\"\\n\\n Feeling a little shy, she turned her back to Erik. After toeing off her sandals, she pulled her sweater over her head and tossed it on a chair.\\n\\n \"A little late for modesty, isn\u0027t it?\" Erik asked, a smile in his voice.\\n\\n Crossing her arms over her breasts, Daisy glanced at him over her shoulder, surprised to see that he was already undressed save for his briefs.\\n\\n \"Here,\" Erik said, \"let me help you.\"\\n\\n \"This is getting to be a habit,\" she murmured as he unfastened her bra and tossed it aside.\\n\\n \"But a nice one,\" he said, waggling his eyebrows.\\n\\n Her cheeks grew hot as Erik unzipped her jeans and slid them down over her hips. When she stepped out of them, he tossed them on top of her sweater. Her panties and his briefs followed.\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027ve bewitched me, woman,\" he said as he slid into bed beside her.\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027ve got that backwards,\" Daisy remarked, cuddling up against him. \"You\u0027re the witch.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one kind of magic,\" Erik replied, \"but it\u0027s nothing like the magic you\u0027ve worked on me.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" She smiled, pleased that he thought himself under her spell. And then she yawned.\\n\\n \"Sleep, love.\"\\n\\n \"When I wake up, will you still be sleeping?\"\\n\\n \"Most likely.\"\\n\\n She worried the corner of her lower lip. \"Is it really like death?\"\\n\\n \"In a way, I suppose it is.\" He stroked her cheek. \"Vampires aren\u0027t supposed to dream, you know, and I never did, until I met you. Thank you for that.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re welcome.\" She wanted to know more about the Dark Sleep, but her eyelids were heavy, so heavy. Resting her head on Erik\u0027s shoulder, she closed her eyes. She would ask him more in a minute...\\n\\n Erik watched Daisy\u0027s eyelids flutter down, heard the change in her breathing as sleep claimed her. She was beautiful, he thought, an angel come to earth.\\n\\n He kissed her cheek, the lethargy that came with the rising of the sun weighed him down. Wrapping his arm around Daisy\u0027s shoulders, he closed his eyes and tumbled into the Dark Sleep of his kind.\\n\\n Alex prowled from one room to another, his hands clenched, his thoughts chaotic. He had tried going back to bed, but knowing one of the world\u0027s oldest vampires was resting in his closet made sleep virtually impossible. He had stretched out on the sofa, but again, sleep eluded him. How was a hunter supposed to get any rest with two vampires in the house? He didn\u0027t trust Erik Delacourt any more than he trusted Rhys Costain.\\n\\n At the sound of thunder, he moved to the living room window and drew back the curtains. He had been so preoccupied, he hadn\u0027t even realized it was raining. Lightning sizzled across the skies. He stared at the rain. Why was he standing here, watching the storm, when he should be taking Costain\u0027s head, and Delacourt\u0027s, too?\\n\\n Alex slammed his fist down on the sill. Dammit, he was a vampire hunter, not a nursemaid. He had been trained from childhood to hunt the Undead, not babysit the Master of the City and his sidekick. And what about Daisy? How could she be in love with the same kind of scum that had killed Brandon?\\n\\n Alex muttered a vile oath. What kind of brother was he, to stand here and do nothing while a vampire bedded his sister? What would his parents think if they knew? And what about Brandon? His brother must be turning in his grave. Alex groaned as a wave of guilt swept over him. Brandon had always been the smarter of the two of them, the one who had known what he wanted out of life, the one who hadn\u0027t been afraid to tell their dad that killing just wasn\u0027t in his blood. Brandon should have lived. He would have made a good husband, a good father, done something important with his life.\\n\\n \"It should have been me, bro,\" Alex murmured. \"It should have been me.\"\\n\\n He glanced at his watch. It was a quarter after one. Most vampires were rendered helpless until sundown, but Delacourt and Costain seemed to be exceptions to that rule. Alex snorted softly. So, they could be awake during the day, but how deeply did they sleep when they were at rest? If he grabbed his blade and opened the closet door, would Costain awaken?\\n\\n Turning away from the window, he began to pace the floor. Instead of fireplace ashes, why not go to the meet with the genuine article and collect the reward? Of course, he\u0027d have to take Delacourt out first. Alex raked his hands through his hair. Daisy would never forgive him. Oh, hell, she\u0027d just have to get over it.\\n\\n Digging into his vampire hunting kit, Alex withdrew mallet and stake, then dropped a bottle of holy water into his pocket. Delving into the bag again, he withdrew a long-bladed knife and a whetstone. He held the blade up to the light, turning it one way and then another. Maybe with Delacourt out of the way, his sister would give Kevin O\u0027Reilly a chance.\\n\\n \"What do you think you\u0027re going to do with those?\"\\n\\n Alex pivoted on his heel at the sound of his sister\u0027s voice. \"Avenge my brother\u0027s death and my sister\u0027s honor.\"\\n\\n \"Alex...\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t try to stop me. We\u0027re hunters, Daisy, or have you forgotten that? I don\u0027t know what kind of supernatural spell Delacourt\u0027s worked on you, but you seem to have forgotten who you are.\"\\n\\n \"And you seem to have forgotten that Erik saved your life.\"\\n\\n \"What about Brandon?\" Alex glanced toward the stairs. \"It was creatures like those two that killed him.\"\\n\\n \"Erik didn\u0027t do it, and neither did Costain.\"\\n\\n Alex made a dismissive gesture with his hand. \"Same smell.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not thinking clearly,\" Daisy said, moving farther into the room. \"All vampires aren\u0027t the same, just as all humans aren\u0027t the same.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, please,\" Alex said, grimacing. \"Get hold of yourself and think with your brain instead of your hormones!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not thinking at all! I won\u0027t let you do this. This is my house and I want you out of it, now!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re kicking me out?\" he asked in astonishment. \"Your own brother? You\u0027re choosing that bloodsucker over your own flesh and blood?\"\\n\\n \"I told Erik and Costain they would be safe here,\" Daisy said, and then frowned. \"This is about the money, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027re still hoping to collect that reward!\"\\n\\n \"What if I do?\" Alex asked sullenly. \"It\u0027s two hundred thousand dollars! One last kill and I could retire.\"\\n\\n \"Rhys said he\u0027d make it good,\" Daisy reminded him.\\n\\n \"Yeah, right! Like I\u0027d trust the word of a vampire.\"\\n\\n Daisy stared at her brother as if she had never seen him before, unable to understand his sudden about-face. Was it just nerves? Had he been drinking? Or had the lust for the reward overridden every other consideration?\\n\\n \"Alex, please tell me what\u0027s going on. You\u0027re scaring me.\"\\n\\n \"I just feel like we\u0027re on the wrong side, helping vampires, when a vampire killed Brandon. Why,\" he asked, his voice dropping to little more than a whisper, \"why couldn\u0027t it have been me?\"\\n\\n \"Is that what this is all about? You\u0027re feeling guilty because you\u0027re alive and Brandon is...is gone?\"\\n\\n \"He had everything to live for. Everything.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Alex.\" Closing the distance between them, Daisy took the knife from her brother\u0027s hand and laid it on the table, then drew him into her arms. He resisted for a moment, then seemed to go limp in her embrace.\\n\\n All this time, she thought, and she had never known her brother felt this way. Alex had always been the joker in the family, never taking anything too seriously, never letting himself get involved with anyone other than his own family. Had he secretly been jealous of Brandon the whole time? In some warped line of thought, did he think that destroying Erik and Rhys would somehow make up for the fact that he was alive and Brandon was dead?\\n\\n Murmuring words of comfort, she patted Alex\u0027s back, her heart breaking when she realized he was crying. They were the first tears he had shed since their brother\u0027s death. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-45.html","bookId":2303,"book":{"id":2303,"title":"Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1)","description":"Storyline: Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1) \\n Daisy O\u0027Donnell doesn\u0027t get the attraction some women feel for vampires.
