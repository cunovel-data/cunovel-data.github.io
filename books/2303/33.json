Never in a thousand years would he have figured Tomas Villagrande for a romantic. \"And that made a difference?\" With a nod, Erik took her by the hand and led her out of the living room, through the kitchen door, and out into the backyard. \"What are we doing out here?\" Daisy asked. \"Nothing. I just wanted to be alone with you.\" \"Oh.\" Anticipation spread through her as he drew her into his embrace. \"Thank you for saving Alex and my dad.\" \"You\u0027re welcome.\" Erik\u0027s gaze moved over her face. He traced the outline of her lips with his finger, then lowered his head and kissed her. Heat unfurled in the pit of Daisy\u0027s stomach and spread outward as he deepened the kiss, his tongue stroking hers, his hands moving lightly up and down her spine, drawing her closer, closer, so that their bodies were pressed intimately together, leaving no doubt in her mind that he wanted her. His lips moved to her brow, the curve of her cheek, her chin, the pulse throbbing in the hollow of her throat. The beat of her heart was faster now, warming her blood. She smelled of musk and desire and woman, of flesh and blood, and he wanted her, needed her. She stirred in his embrace, inflaming him still more. So easy to take her here, now. So easy... Daisy pressed herself against him, her body trembling with desire as he kissed her again and again. He lowered his head to her breasts, kissing her through the fabric of her shirt while his hands held her body tightly to his. His kisses were like fire, melting her bones, incinerating all thought. There was only Erik, and her desire to please him, to give him whatever he asked. And he was asking. His voice in her ear, begging for a taste... He wanted her, needed her. How could she refuse? With a sigh, she arched her neck, granting him access to her throat. His tongue was like a flame against her skin, the touch of his fangs both pain and pleasure as he drank. And then she was drifting, floating through a red haze of sensation where every touch, every caress, was heightened. She cried out in protest when he lifted his head, not caring if he took it all if only she could bury herself in the crimson bliss that surrounded her. Murmuring, \"Don\u0027t stop,\" she pulled his head down to her neck once again. Erik stroked her cheek. \"I\u0027m sorry, love, but I dare not take more.\" \"Please...\" He swore softly, then tensed as the back door slammed open and Alex\u0027s voice cut through the darkness. \"Daisy? Daisy, are you out here?\" \"We\u0027re over here,\" Erik called. Pulling Daisy to him, he quickly licked the tiny wounds in her throat, sealing them, then draped his arm around her shoulders. \"What are you doing out here?\" Alex asked, striding toward them. \"Just enjoying the evening air,\" Erik replied. \"Uh-huh,\" Alex remarked skeptically. \"Daisy, are you all right?\" \"I\u0027m fine,\" she murmured, though it was an effort to focus her thoughts. \"Where\u0027s Dad?\" \"He\u0027s talking to Mom on the phone.\" \"How are you feeling?\" Erik asked. \"I feel fine.\" Alex frowned at him, then looked at Daisy. \"What did you tell him?\" \"I...\" Daisy looked up at Erik, wondering what she should say. \"She didn\u0027t tell me anything. Why? Is something wrong?\" Alex narrowed his eyes as he gazed from his sister to Erik and back again. \"Why should anything be wrong?\" \"Alex, we\u0027d like a little privacy, if you don\u0027t mind,\" Daisy said, forcing a smile. \"I\u0027ll talk to you later.\" \"Yeah, later.\" Alex held her gaze for a moment, his expression puzzled, and then he turned and made his way back toward the house. \"How am I going to explain how they got away from the vampire, and how they got home?\" Daisy asked. \"I\u0027m not sure you\u0027ll have to.\" Daisy frowned. \"Maybe you\u0027re right. He didn\u0027t seem very upset for a guy who\u0027d been captured by a vampire, did he?\" \"Exactly. I don\u0027t think he remembers any of it.\" \"Which means my father probably doesn\u0027t, either.\" \"Right. Let\u0027s go back inside. I\u0027ll hypnotize the two of them and see if they have any memory of what happened. If they do, I\u0027ll erase it from their minds, then I\u0027ll go get the truck and bring it back here. We\u0027ll pretend today never happened. If they don\u0027t remember anything...\" Erik shrugged. \"Problem solved either way.\" \"But...\" Daisy shook her head, uncertain how she felt about Erik messing with their minds. \"Have you got a better idea?\" \"No.\" He kissed her lightly on the cheek. \"They\u0027ll be fine, trust me.\" She didn\u0027t know why she was surprised by the realization that she did, indeed, trust him. She lifted a hand to her neck, thinking that she had put her life in his hands only moments ago. \"That\u0027s my girl.\" Erik smiled at her as he took her hand and led her into the house. Chapter 25 Daisy slipped into bed and turned out the light, her mind still filled with images of Erik standing in the living room mesmerizing her father and her brother. She had known such things were possible. She had seen Nonnie put people into trances before. She had known vampires were capable of doing the same thing. The first lesson her father had taught her was never to look directly into a vampire\u0027s eyes, something she had totally forgotten upon meeting Erik. She had watched and listened as Erik had sorted through her father\u0027s memories of the day, and then her brother\u0027s. Neither her father nor Alex recalled finding Villagrande or anything else about their encounter with the vampire. \"Why would he erase their memories?\" Daisy asked. \"I have a feeling he did it just before I took them away, perhaps as a gift to you.\" \"Me? He doesn\u0027t even know me.\" \"But he knows I love you.\" \"What? How could he know such a thing?\" \"Probably because I told him.\" \"You discussed me with him?\" she exclaimed. \"I explained that you mean a lot to me, and that Alex and your father mean a lot to you.\" Thinking back on it now, warm in her bed in the safety of her own room, made her smile. A vampire with a heart of gold. Who\u0027d have thought it? Erik had left immediately after releasing Alex and her dad from his spell. Brandon had come home shortly thereafter. The four of them had stayed up chatting until well after midnight. Of course, all Brandon could talk about was Paula. She was beautiful. She was sweet and kind and caring, just an old-fashioned girl. She dreamed of going to Niagara Falls when she got married, and she wanted lots of children. With a sigh, Daisy turned onto her side, thinking she was just a little envious of her brother. Not that she wasn\u0027t happy for him. It was just that his future seemed set, while hers seemed to get more complicated every day. Not that she would change her life for Brandon\u0027s. Her life might not be perfect, but at the moment, she wouldn\u0027t change a thing, not if it meant giving up Erik. Just thinking of him, with his soul-deep eyes, sexy smile, and kissable lips, made her heart skip a beat. She glanced at the darkness beyond her window. Where was he now? Was he thinking of her, wishing they were together? If only he were there, beside her. The thought had no sooner crossed her mind than he was lying on top of the covers next to her. \"Oh!\" She pressed a hand to her wildly beating heart. \"You just scared me half to death.\" \"Sorry, my little flower,\" he said, and then grinned. \"Any chance I could have the other half?\" \"What are you talking about...?\" She frowned at him, then recoiled as she realized what he was asking. \"No way!\" He ran his knuckles lightly up and down her cheek. \"You might like it.\" \"I doubt it.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to see the world as it is?\" He lifted his hand in a gesture that encompassed her bedroom. \"Look around you. I can see each stitch in your curtains, hear the ant crawling across the floor, the bird settling in its nest outside your window. When I touch your quilt, I can feel the weave and the texture of the threads. When I touch you...\" He smiled into her eyes. \"Perhaps I\u0027d better not go there.\" Daisy stared at him, caught up in the magic of his voice, the wonder of what he was saying. What would it be like, to view the world through vampire eyes? To be able to think yourself across the street or across the country? To hear sounds that others never heard? She recalled watching him carry her father and brother into the house as if they weighed nothing at all. What would it be like to have the strength of twenty men? To drink blood... The thought brought her swiftly back to cold reality. True, Erik had powers far beyond hers, but there was a price to pay for those incredible powers. There was always a price to pay. And the price was far too dear. \"Daisy?\" She closed her eyes, afraid to look at him. He was too beautiful, too tempting. For a moment, she let herself imagine what it would be like to be his equal, a vampire who could share his whole life. Sometimes, when they kissed, she had a taste of what it would be like. With his mouth on hers, she felt strong, invincible, as if she could climb rainbows and touch the stars. But it wasn\u0027t real. In a way, he wasn\u0027t real. \"Daisy, look at me.\" \"No.\" \"What are you afraid of?\" \"I\u0027m afraid of you, afraid I\u0027m not strong enough to resist. You make it sound so tempting, but I don\u0027t want to be a vampire.\" She blinked against the burn of tears in the backs of her eyes. \"I don\u0027t want to give up my family or my life. I like being me.\" \"It\u0027s all right, love.\" He kissed the tears from her cheeks. \"Don\u0027t ever let me change your mind.\" \"But you could, couldn\u0027t you?\" He hesitated a moment, pondering the truth versus a lie.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-33.html","bookId":2303,"book":{"id":2303,"title":"Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1)","description":"Storyline: Everlasting Kiss (Everlasting #1) Daisy O\u0027Donnell doesn\u0027t get the attraction some women feel for vampires.
