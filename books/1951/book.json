{"id":1951,"title":"92 Pacific Boulevard (Cedar Cove #9)","description":"Storyline: 92 Pacific Boulevard (Cedar Cove #9) \\n Olivia Lockhart-GriffinCedar Cove, Washington \\n Dear Listener, \\n I\u0027m sorry to say that our good sheriff, Troy Davis, has suffered a disappointment in love. He was hoping to marry his onetime girlfriend, Faith Beckwith, who recently moved back to town. Well, the latest is that Faith ended the relationship last month, even though both of them are widowed and available. According to Troy, there were a few misunderstandings between them?some inadvertently caused, it seems, by his daughter, Megan. \\n Troy\u0027s got plenty to keep him occupied, though?like the unidentified remains found in a cave outside town. And the break-ins at 204 Rosewood Lane, the house Faith just happens to be renting from Grace Harding?. \\n All of that\u0027s a distraction from what\u0027s happening in my life. I\u0027m going through chemo right now, and I\u0027m so grateful for my husband, Jack, my family and my friends, who give me the strength and support I need to beat this. But beat it I will! \\n I\u0027d suggest meeting at Troy\u0027s place, 92 Pacific Boulevard, so we can all talk, but the Pancake Palace is probably a better choice if you want a decent cup of coffee! \\n Olivia\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/92-pacific-boulevard-cedar-cove-9.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
