The marriage hadn’t worked for either of them. They were mismatched, and as time went on, there’d been less and less to hold them together. He hoped Georgia didn’t resent him. But he’d begun a new life here in Cedar Cove, returning to his hometown, where he’d spent some of his happiest years. He wanted to become that person again, wanted to redeem himself, in his own eyes and those of his family and friends. Maybe Shirley Bliss would help him…. He’d met Shirley, a widow, when he’d purchased the art gallery. He’d felt an immediate attraction, but it was more than that. She was a widow, and therefore available, so perhaps that meant he’d moved beyond his compulsion to seduce women already involved with other men. Whatever the reason for his urge to stray—boredom, the thrill of conquest, the need to prove his own masculinity—he wanted to overcome it. Besides, he was genuinely interested in Shirley and impressed by her talent. Will wandered over to his desk. The Harbor Street Art Gallery was doing well, better than he’d expected. That was due, in no small way, to Shirley. She’d given him some excellent suggestions, many of which he’d used. The idea for the new display cases had come from her. They’d cost more than he’d budgeted for, but they were worth it. In appreciation for all her help, he’d made Shirley, who worked with fabrics, the featured artist for January and would be pleased to inform her that over the weekend he’d sold the largest piece she had on display. He had a check for her, and he thought she’d be as excited about this sale as he was. When he picked up the phone, he did so with a sense of anticipation. Aside from his pleasure in her success and consequently his own, he felt challenged by her. And not merely as a potential lover. This was the perfect opportunity to get to know her better. She hadn’t revealed any interest in him, however, which was puzzling. Not to brag, but he knew he looked good; at sixty he’d gained a stateliness that suited him. He was intelligent and had a natural charm, as so many other women—including Georgia—had told him. The possibility existed that Shirley was still in love with her dead husband. From what Will understood, it’d been a year or so since the accident that had claimed his life. Will knew his own strengths and his weaknesses. He hadn’t gotten this far without identifying his assets and using them. He didn’t mind admitting that he was a man who generally got what he wanted; he’d also admit that this trait hadn’t always been to his benefit. Georgia had called him a “serial philanderer,” claiming he only wanted women he couldn’t have—and when he got them he lost interest. He didn’t deny it but he believed that Shirley would change all that. He dialed her number and waited for her to answer. After four rings the answering machine came on. Then, just as he was about to leave a message, he heard someone pick up. “Hello.” Shirley sounded a little breathless. “Hello,” Will returned, smiling, glad they’d been able to connect. “Who is this?” she demanded, irritation in her voice. “It’s Will. Will Jefferson from the Harbor Street Art Gallery,” he told her. That she hadn’t recognized his voice stung his ego. He’d hoped, despite her previous reticence, that she’d been thinking about him, too. Apparently that wasn’t the case. Her hesitation was just long enough to be noticeable. “I apologize if I snapped at you.” Will was more than willing to forgive her. “I’m guessing I phoned at a bad time.” “I usually try to work while Tanni’s in school.” Tanni was Shirley’s teenage daughter. He’d met her twice. The girl was dating a young man with an unusual first name. Shank? Shiver. Shaw…that was it. Shaw. The kid had talent. So did Tanni, although she was the one who’d brought Shaw’s work to Will’s attention. Shaw’s portraits, especially, had a lot of promise. He’d shown the kid’s work to an old friend of his, Larry Knight, who was a successful and influential artist, and who happened to be in Seattle recently. Larry had confirmed Will’s assessment. The way Will figured it, Shirley would be grateful for his help. And Will most definitely wanted to obtain Shirley’s gratitude. “I understand,” he said smoothly. “I’ll remember to call either early in the morning or closer to dinnertime.” “I’d appreciate that.” “Your exhibit’s done well,” he told her. Silence. Since she didn’t seem inclined to continue the conversation, Will charged ahead. “I wanted to know if it would be convenient for me to stop by later this evening.” She hesitated again. “Is there a reason?” The question put him slightly on edge; he’d expected a warmer welcome. He was disappointed that he needed an excuse, but then he’d already made more than one incorrect assumption with Shirley. “Yes, a very good reason,” he said. “I have a check for you. The wildflower panel sold this weekend.” The piece, a fabric collage, was a stunning work. Everyone who’d viewed it, including Will, had been enchanted. Shirley squealed with delight. “It sold! It really sold?” “Yes.” Will had never heard her sound so uninhibited. “And the woman who bought it is interested in a couple of your other pieces, too.” “That’s wonderful!” “I thought you’d be pleased,” he said. “I could drop off the check if you like.” He didn’t want her to think he was pressuring her. “Ah…unfortunately I have plans this evening.” “I could visit tomorrow if that would be more convenient.” He was trying not to come across as pushy; at the same time, he was curious to know what her plans might be. “Well…” she said cautiously. “Maybe it would be best just to drop it in the mail.” Will’s head was spinning. She didn’t want to see him, or not at her house, anyway. That was a disappointment. “I have a better idea. Why don’t you come to the gallery and pick it up?” She leaped on the suggestion. “Sure…that would be great.” “When would be a good time?” he asked, implying that he was busy, too, and they should schedule this meeting. “I suppose I could make it into town later this afternoon,” she said. They agreed on four-thirty and Will set the phone back in its cradle, smiling. He’d gone out of his way for her daughter’s boyfriend at Shirley’s request—or with her approval, at any rate. Shaw had talent, but talent was cheap. He was giving the teenager a leg up, and he wanted to make sure Shirley valued his effort and the fact that he’d called in a favor from a friend. Now that their meeting was set, Will closed the gallery a half hour early, then took the time to comb his hair and change his shirt. Before returning to the main part of the gallery, he glanced at his reflection in the mirror. Normally he would’ve been confident he looked good, but Shirley’s reluctance made him feel somewhat insecure—not a familiar sensation. While he waited for Shirley, he checked his watch every couple of minutes. He exhaled a sigh of relief when he saw her park in front of the gallery. She climbed out and started toward the entrance, paused, then turned back to her vehicle. Will wasn’t about to let her walk off. He hurried over to the front door and threw it open. “Shirley,” he called. “Come in.” She turned around. “The sign says the gallery’s closed.” He laughed lightly. “It is for everyone but you.” “Oh…” He opened the door wider and gestured her inside. “Do you have the check?” she asked the moment she crossed the threshold. Then, as if she understood how rude she’d been, she added, “I, uh, know how busy you are and I don’t want to detain you.” “It’s in the office.” When she didn’t move, he repeated, “Come in.” After a short pause, she came all the way into the gallery. Will closed the door and walked toward his small office, with her following. He handed her a white envelope, which held her check. “You know, I never heard if you received the wine-and-cheese basket I left on your doorstep during the holidays.” “Yes, I did…. I apologize. I should’ve written a thank-you note.” She did seem appropriately contrite. Will had paid a premium for that basket. This wasn’t some run-of-the-mill wine-and-cheese ensemble, either. Everything had been imported from France. “No problem. I just wanted to be sure you got it,” he said nonchalantly. “When did you bring it by?” she asked. “Christmas Day,” he said. “Oh, I hope you weren’t alone on Christmas Day.” He looked away. “I was, but it wasn’t any big deal. I had a couple of invitations, but…I didn’t feel well.” He’d rather not admit he hadn’t accepted those invitations—from Olivia and his niece, Justine—because he’d thought he could spend the day with Shirley. He’d made the mistake of assuming she’d be home and alone, the same way he’d been. He knew her kids would be there, but kids that age didn’t enjoy hanging around with their mothers. As a result of his mistaken assumption, he’d ended up going to Olivia’s for dinner and then watching White Christmas on TV in his apartment for what had to be the twentieth time. “I apologize for not sending you that thank-you note,” she told him again. “It doesn’t matter. I only wanted to make sure you found the gift.” He brightened. “But…” he said in a teasing voice “…you could make it up to me.” He’d keep it light, easy, relaxed. “What do you mean?” she asked, frowning instantly. “How?” “I know you’re a widow.” She took a small step in retreat, as though the subject wasn’t one she intended to discuss with him. That was fine; Will had no desire to draw her dead husband into the conversation. He just wanted to establish her availability—and his. “As I mentioned earlier, I’m on my own, too. I thought we could get together one evening,” he said, “or maybe we could meet one afternoon.” Shirley took another small step away from him. Now that she had her check, she seemed eager to leave. “Nothing formal, you understand,” Will clarified. “Lunch or coffee, that sort of thing.” She gave him a slight smile. “I’m not sure I’m ready to date.” “This wouldn’t be a date,” he said. “This would be a chat over coffee, a getting-to-know-you session, that’s all. I’d love to hear more of your ideas for the gallery,” he added, to remind her of the conversation they’d already had back in the fall. “I’m free now, if you are. I hear the Pot Belly Deli has an excellent selection of coffees and teas.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/92-pacific-boulevard-cedar-cove-9/page-8.html","bookId":1951,"book":{"id":1951,"title":"92 Pacific Boulevard (Cedar Cove #9)","description":"Storyline: 92 Pacific Boulevard (Cedar Cove #9) Olivia Lockhart-GriffinCedar Cove, Washington Dear Listener, I\u0027m sorry to say that our good sheriff, Troy Davis, has suffered a disappointment in love.
