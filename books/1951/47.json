This was the last thing, the absolute last thing, she wanted to hear. “I’m not making it up, Gloria.” He paused. “How long has it been?” “I forget.” She hadn’t, but she wasn’t about to let him know that their night together still lingered in her mind. “I can’t stop thinking about you,” he said quietly. “Try harder,” she advised. “Do you suppose I haven’t?” “It was one night. I’d had too much to drink.” “No, you hadn’t. You knew exactly what you were doing and so did I.” Gloria released her breath. He was right, and while she’d like an excuse for their brief interlude, there was no point in lying—to him or to herself. “Why can’t you be like every other man? Notch your bedpost and go on to the next conquest?” “Is that what you think of me?” He actually sounded hurt. “I apologize. But apparently you read more into our…encounter than you should have.” She didn’t want to hurt him. Hurting anyone went against her nature; nevertheless it was best, as far as she was concerned, to forget this and move on. He continued to look out over the water. “At first I thought your reluctance had to do with Linnette.” It had. Gloria had met Chad, and they’d spent that one night together. Then, through a fluke, she’d discovered that her sister had a crush on him. Except that, at the time, Linnette hadn’t known they were sisters. No one did. After being adopted as an infant, Gloria had grown up in California, in a loving home with wonderful parents. Then, six years ago, she’d lost them in a plane crash. Her life had faltered until she managed to learn the names of her birth parents. It was a shock to discover that after they’d given her up for adoption, they’d gone on to marry and have two other children. These were Gloria’s full siblings, her sister and brother. Hungry for the connection with family, she’d moved to Cedar Cove. Then, as luck would have it, her sister had moved into the apartment next door. Her birth father, Roy, sometimes said that luck, good or bad, was all a matter of timing. In this case, the timing and the luck were both. Good and bad. Linnette, a physician assistant, had a huge crush on Dr. Chad Timmons, and Gloria had quickly bowed out of the relationship with Chad, preferring to step aside rather than risk destroying her chances with Linnette because they were both interested in the same man. She’d made so many mistakes, and sleeping with Chad was near the top of that list. The night with Chad had been completely out of character. She felt embarrassed thinking about it. Even after Linnette had started dating Cal Washburn, she’d decided not to see Chad again. She’d convinced herself it was just easier that way. Less awkward. “Linnette is out of the picture,” he added gently. “She has been for quite a while.” Chad sipped his coffee. He still didn’t look in her direction. “My point exactly.” “Why is it,” Gloria demanded, “that you have such a hard time accepting the fact that I’m not interested?” “Because I know it’s a lie.” “You have a rather high opinion of your charms.” “Perhaps,” he agreed readily. “However, I doubt it.” His remark amused her. “Really?” “Yes, really.” He turned to face her then, with his back to the railing. “I scare you to death because I’m the first man to get past your guard. You have your life carefully planned out and falling in love didn’t fit those plans. Take a memo, Gloria: Life is full of surprises. Not everything happens according to schedule.” “Excuse me. I thought you were a family physician, not a psychologist.” He ignored that. “I don’t mean to sound egotistical, but you’re in love with me, and like I said, it scares you to death.” Her laugh was forced and high-pitched. “If you want to laugh,” he said in a bored voice, “go ahead, but we both know the truth.” In response, Gloria conspicuously checked her watch. “Your time is about up.” “I thought you’d be able to acknowledge your feelings and admit that what we shared was very, very good. I guess not.” “And you know all this about me, about us, after one night? One foolish, drunken night, I might add.” “No. It’s taken me a while to figure it out.” For reasons she couldn’t explain, a lump had formed in her throat. “As you say, my time’s about up. And I don’t just mean my time with you now, this afternoon. I wanted you to know I’ve given my notice at the clinic, but before I left Cedar Cove I felt I should tell you how much I wish things were different between us.” An unexpected feeling of loss washed over her and she couldn’t speak. She swallowed hard. “I hope you find the happiness you’re looking for,” he said. “I just regret it wasn’t with me.” He looked directly into her eyes, smiled and threw his coffee container into a nearby trash bin. Without another word, he walked away. Gloria remained rooted to the spot. After a moment, she closed her eyes and acknowledged that he was right. She’d carefully planned the reunion with her birth family, but nothing had worked out the way she’d hoped. She wanted to be close to her sister and brother, and that hadn’t happened. Nothing had gone as she’d envisioned. She saw Mack once in a while, for a quick drink and some stilted conversation, and exchanged an occasional phone call with Linnette. It wasn’t their fault; she’d counted on too much from them—too much too soon. They’d already established lives, with no firm place for her. Corrie was superficially warm and friendly, but Gloria felt she’d never got past her guilt over the adoption. Of all of them, she had the best relationship with Roy, a former cop himself. Trembling, she leaned against the railing, watching as Chad walked toward the clinic. All these months, she’d been afraid of what would happen if she ever let him back into her life. That night, that fateful night, he’d seemed to recognize her pain. When she didn’t answer his questions, he’d whispered that she could tell him when she was ready. But she wasn’t any more ready now than she’d been then. After that one night with Chad, Gloria had felt vulnerable. He’d shaken her sense of self-preservation. Instinctively she’d fled, determined that what had happened could never be repeated. She didn’t like being out of control. She couldn’t risk getting emotionally involved with him, with anyone. Linnette’s interest in him had been a convenient excuse, but that was all—an excuse. Especially when Linnette had fallen for Cal, when she was over her infatuation with Chad. Although Gloria had rebuffed Chad several times, he hadn’t given up and refused to accept that she didn’t reciprocate his feelings. Only now did she admit what those feelings were, and only because he’d forced her to. Now Chad was leaving and she had the strongest intuition that if she let him go, she’d be sorry for the rest of her life. Gloria returned to her vehicle and sat there for several minutes, debating what to do. The safe response, she supposed, would be nothing. He could leave, and her life would be unchanged…. No, it wouldn’t. She couldn’t lie to herself anymore. She cared about him, had cared for a very long time. Dropping her head to the steering wheel, she considered her next move. The lump in her throat hadn’t gone away and she gave a shuddering sigh, trapped in her indecision. Without any further deliberation, she got out of her car and slammed the door. Anger vibrated through her. She wanted to kick, yell, scream, stamp her feet. The medical clinic was close to the marina, and she walked there at a clipped pace, nearly breathless by the time she arrived. The waiting room was crowded. She stepped up to the receptionist’s desk and stood in line. “I need to see Dr. Timmons,” she said when it was finally her turn. The woman started to ask her something, but Gloria broke in. “This is a personal matter.” For a moment she thought the receptionist was about to argue with her. Then she followed the woman’s glance. Chad was speaking to a nurse in the background; he paused when he saw her, said a few words to the nurse and started toward the reception area. Gloria met his eyes. “Dr. Timmons,” the receptionist said loudly, “this woman wants to see you on a personal matter.” Gloria cringed in embarrassment. “That’s all right, Micki.” He directed his next comment to Gloria. “I’m on duty.” This was incredibly uncomfortable. In addition to the staff, the waiting room full of patients who studied them as if they were Hollywood celebrities indulging in a public spat. “You wanted to see me?” he said coolly. The least he could do was put her at ease. He didn’t. She managed to nod, her mouth too dry to say anything at all. “I have to get back to my patient,” he said, looking quickly over his shoulder. In other words, if she had something to say she’d better do it soon because he didn’t have time to waste. “What you said earlier…” “I said a lot of things earlier.” She closed her eyes. “Don’t leave,” she blurted out. “Are you saying you want me to stay in Cedar Cove?” he asked. “Yes.” She risked opening her eyes. He was smiling. Gloria heard someone call his name. Chad reluctantly moved away. “We’ll talk,” he said. Gloria nodded, turned and hurried away. Either she’d taken a huge step forward or she’d made the most foolish mistake of her life. No, the second most foolish mistake… Thirty-Five Mack rounded a corner of the high-school playing field during his five-mile run. His legs and his heart were pumping at their maximum. His thoughts kept pace as he contemplated his relationship with Mary Jo. Although they were engaged, it wasn’t what he’d expected. Even now, Mack remained somewhat unsure of Mary Jo’s feelings toward him. If she genuinely loved him, he saw little evidence of that. His own feelings, however, hadn’t changed—he was crazy about her and Noelle. Things had improved since their talk—and their kiss—but Mack sensed a reserve in her, a hesitation. In some ways their relationship had returned to what it had been before David’s threatening visit. They had dinner together three or four nights a week and they’d resumed their card playing and television watching. That much was good. Most of the tension between them had abated, and for that Mack was grateful. Still, he was aware of her reluctance to become more involved and he didn’t understand it. They’d kissed that one time, which had been wonderful. However, their kisses since then were restrained. Perfunctory. Brief kisses at the end of the evening were the most he’d come to expect. Nothing too passionate or even playful. Mack wanted more, hungered for more, and always left her half of the duplex with an ache in his gut.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/92-pacific-boulevard-cedar-cove-9/page-47.html","bookId":1951,"book":{"id":1951,"title":"92 Pacific Boulevard (Cedar Cove #9)","description":"Storyline: 92 Pacific Boulevard (Cedar Cove #9) Olivia Lockhart-GriffinCedar Cove, Washington Dear Listener, I\u0027m sorry to say that our good sheriff, Troy Davis, has suffered a disappointment in love.
