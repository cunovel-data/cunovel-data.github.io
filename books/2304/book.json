But none of them affects Megan DeLacey as deeply as the dark-eyed stranger who strides into her boutique one evening - and keeps returning, night after night. Megan is drawn to Rhys Costain even as she fears him. Because his reason for being there is clear - he wants Megan, with an intensity that\u0027s both tempting and terrifying. \n For almost five centuries, Rhys has lived alone, using women as it pleased him and never wanting more. As Master of the West Coast vampires, it\u0027s his duty to eliminate the ancient vampire who\u0027s draining humans on his turf, putting all of their kind at risk. But Megan\u0027s lush beauty and vibrant warmth is blinding him to a danger that will soon engulf them both - and tear him from the only woman who can satisfy his darkest hunger.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/everlasting-desire-everlasting-2.jpg","author":"Amanda Ashley","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":55,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
