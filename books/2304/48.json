I couldn’t sense you anywhere. I thought…” He took a deep breath. “I thought you were dead.” “We’re fine,” Daisy said, smiling. “It’s the zombies that are dead. I think Villagrande sent them after us, maybe just to keep us out of the way, or maybe…” She shrugged. “Who knows?” “What happened to the zombies?” Megan asked. Daisy looked at her as if she wasn’t very bright. “Oh.” “As soon as they were out of the way, I grabbed you and transported us here and that, as they say, is that.” Alex cleared his throat. “Do you think you two could reminisce about that later? I’m in a bit of pain here.” “Sorry,” Rhys muttered. He glanced at Erik and Daisy. “Let’s go,” he said, and wrapping his arms around Megan, he transported the two of them to the hospital. Moments later, Erik, Alex, and Daisy materialized beside them. Daisy smiled at her brother. “Make up a good story,” she said. “You used to be aces at that when we were kids.” “Yeah,” he muttered. “Catch ya later.” Megan looked up at Rhys. “Be careful.” “Don’t worry about me. Ask the doctor to check you over while you’re in there.” She rubbed her hand over his cheek. “I’m fine. Come on, Alex,” she said, slipping her arm around his waist, “let’s go get you patched up.” Rhys shook his head as he watched Megan help Alex up the driveway toward the emergency room entrance. She was quite a woman. “Costain?” He answered Erik without taking his gaze from Megan. “Not now.” Erik took Daisy’s hand in his and gave it a squeeze. “We’ll meet you back here in, oh, say, half an hour, all right?” Rhys nodded, his attention still on Megan. No matter how long he lived, he knew he would never see her like again. She was everything a man could want in a woman—kind, caring, with a loving heart and a generous nature, and he knew that, from this night on, his existence would never be the same. Leaving her would be the hardest thing he had ever done, but it was best for both of them. When he was gone, her life would go back to normal and so, he thought glumly, would his. He watched her until she was out of sight, and then he melted into the darkness, where he belonged. Chapter 46 Feeling chilly, Megan wrapped her arms around her middle. It had been a heck of a night. Alex hadn’t wanted to stay in the hospital, but the doctor had insisted. In addition to his broken arm and sprained ankle, Alex had two broken ribs and a possible concussion. Rhys had told her to have the doctor check her over, too, but there had been no need for that as far as she was concerned. She didn’t have any broken bones, and there was no cure for the nightmares she was likely to have. Tapping her foot, she glanced up and down the street. Where was Rhys? Hadn’t he and the others agreed to meet back here in half an hour? Had she been mistaken? Or maybe it had just taken them longer to get cleaned up. Cleaned up, indeed. She knew what that meant. They had all gone to feed. Good grief, she was hanging out with vampires. Megan shook her head. After all she had seen and heard, did Daisy really think she was such a nervous Nelly that she couldn’t handle the truth? Megan scrubbed her hands up and down her arms as a chill wind blew down the street. Of all the times to be without a cell phone, she thought impatiently, and then lifted a hand to her head. She had a bump the size of a goose egg where the zombie had hit her. She was, she thought, lucky to be alive. She almost jumped out of her skin when Daisy and Erik appeared seemingly from out of nowhere. Even in the faint glow of the lights that lined the driveway, Megan could see that they had both fed and fed well. “Where’s Rhys?” Daisy asked, glancing around. “I thought he’d be back by now.” A horrible sense of foreboding settled over Megan. Closing her eyes, she tried to find the bond she shared with Rhys, but there was nothing there. Only emptiness. When she opened her eyes, the look on Erik’s face, the pity in his eyes, turned her stomach cold. “Come on,” he said, putting his arm around her. “We’ll take you home.” Before Megan realized what was happening, she was standing in her own living room. “Why don’t you sit down?” Erik suggested. “Daisy, would you bring her a glass of water?” “I don’t want a glass of water or anything else,” Megan said, her voice brittle. “I just want to know what’s going on.” “Why don’t you sit down?” Erik repeated. Megan sat on the edge of the sofa, her hands tightly folded in her lap. “He’s left me, hasn’t he?” Erik nodded. “I’m afraid so.” “But why? It’s over. Villagrande’s not a threat anymore.” “He’s afraid for you,” Erik explained. “Afraid of what might happen in the future.” “So, just like that, it’s over?” Erik’s gaze slid away from hers. “Why didn’t he come and tell me all this himself?” Erik shrugged. “That should be obvious.” “I never took him for a coward,” Megan said. “I’m sure he was only thinking of you,” Daisy said. “You’ll always be in danger as long as your life is tied up with his. It’s one of the reasons vampires rarely get involved with mortals.” “Is that right?” Megan asked, her anger rising. “Then how do you explain the two of you?” “I said rarely, not never. It happens from time to time. But such pairings aren’t usually successful unless…” Daisy looked at Erik and smiled. “Unless the mortal becomes a vampire,” Megan said. “Is that what you’re trying to say?” Rhys had left her. She couldn’t think about it anymore, not now, when the hurt was so fresh. And so she changed the subject. “Why did Villagrande send zombies after us tonight?” Zombies. Megan shook her head. Even now, it was hard to comprehend. “For no good reason, I’m sure.” Erik smiled at his wife. “Whatever his reasons, I guess he underestimated your powers.” Daisy made a face at him. “I can’t believe I was so stupid. As soon as I went outside, I knew I’d made a mistake. While I was dispatching one of the zombies, the other one got inside and knocked Megan unconscious. By the time I got back in the house, the zombie had Megan slung over his shoulder and was heading for the back door.” “I can’t believe such creatures exist,” Megan said. “Oh, they exist all right,” Erik said. “But they’re not too bright.” “How do you…? Never mind,” Megan decided. “I don’t want to know.” Zombies had once been human. Did they return to normal when whoever held them in thrall released them? Or did they remain mindless creatures with no will of their own? “It’s late,” Daisy said, patting Megan’s hand. “You should get some sleep.” Sleep? After the last few days, she didn’t think she would ever get another peaceful night’s sleep. And even as the thought crossed her mind, she was yawning. “We’ll stay until morning, if you don’t want to be alone,” Erik offered. The idea was appealing. But rather than seem cowardly, Megan shook her head. “I’ll be all right, but thank you, both of you.” “You’ve got our number,” Daisy said, giving Megan a hug. “Call if you need us.” Megan nodded. She started to rise, intending to walk Daisy and Erik to the door, but they were gone in a swirl of twinkling blue and dove gray motes before she gained her feet. “A neat trick,” she murmured, and burst into tears. Thursday morning dawned cold, gray, and gloomy, the perfect setting for Megan’s misery. She had cried most of the night, hadn’t slept more than an hour or two at most, which explained why she woke with a headache and eyes that felt like they were filled with sand. It seemed strange to wake in her own bed in her own room. Strange to know she was alone in the house. The nightmare was over. Tomás Villagrande had been destroyed. Erik and Daisy had returned to Boston. And Rhys…? Where was he? Knowing it was useless, she tried to open the link between them, but it was like trying to call a number that had been disconnected. No one was there. Rising, she stepped into her slippers and plodded downstairs to make a pot of coffee. When it was done, she sat at the table staring into her favorite Grumpy coffee cup and wishing she could just disappear. How was she supposed to go back to her old, boring life after having known Rhys? Yes, he was dangerous. Yes, being around him was risky. But as scary as it had sometimes been, being with him had made her feel vibrant and alive. And she loved him as she would never love anyone else. She carried her coffee cup into the living room and switched on the TV. Talk about a vast wasteland. Did anyone even watch TV in the morning? There was nothing on but black-robed judges trying to look important while they ruled on mundane cases, cheerful talk show hosts who discussed even more mundane topics, ubiquitous soap operas, and mindless cartoons. Where had all the good shows gone? She refilled her cup twice and then, deciding she couldn’t just sit around in her pj’s and mope all day, she called Mr. Parker and told him she was back in town and that she would be at work that night. Early. It turned out to be the best decision she could have made. Mr. Parker was genuinely happy to see her again. Being back at work, talking to people who didn’t drink blood or disappear in the blink of an eye helped to ground her in the real world again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-desire-everlasting-2/page-48.html","bookId":2304,"book":{"id":2304,"title":"Everlasting Desire (Everlasting #2)","description":"Storyline: Everlasting Desire (Everlasting #2) Desire Burns Forever The clientele at Shore\u0027s clothing store includes some of L.A.\u0027s sexiest bachelors.
