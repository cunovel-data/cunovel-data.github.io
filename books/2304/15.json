He knew exactly what she meant. “There’s something about you. Something…” She shook her head. “I can’t put my finger on it, but there’s something not quite right.” “I’m going to take Megan up to bed.” “You’re not going to tell me who you are, or what you are, are you?” “No. All you need to know is that I’m in love with Megan, and I would never hurt her.” Shirl nodded. She didn’t know much about this man, but she could see the truth of his words in his eyes. She led the way up to Megan’s room and turned down the covers on the bed. After Rhys lowered Megan onto the mattress, Shirl shooed him out of the room and shut the door. She undressed Megan, eased a nightgown over her head, then pulled the covers over her before allowing Rhys back into the room. “I’ll wait for you downstairs,” Shirl said, and left the room. Rhys sat on the edge of the bed, one hand lightly stroking Megan’s cheek. She might have perished in the fire if he hadn’t been there tonight. The thought cut like a knife. Even though she wasn’t hurt, he was hesitant to leave her, but Shirl was waiting downstairs to lock up after him. It was the only thing keeping him from leaving by the window. Using his supernatural powers would only add to her suspicions. Rising, he kissed Megan’s cheek before going downstairs. He found Shirl by the front door. “Good night, Mr. Costain.” Stifling a grin, he murmured, “Good night, Miss Mansfield,” and left the house. She stared after him. Megan had been right to be wary of Rhys Costain, Shirl decided as she turned off the lights in the living room. He was remarkably handsome. He was polite. He dressed well and drove a great car, but…She shook her head. Something about him definitely wasn’t right. “Mr. Costain,” she murmured. “Who are you?” Feeling a sudden chill, she closed and locked the door. Maybe that double-date she and Megan had talked about wasn’t such a good idea, after all. Chapter 12 In the morning, Megan woke feeling wonderful. Smiling, she sat up and stretched her arms over her head. It was a beautiful day. Rising, she took a long, hot shower, washed her hair, brushed her teeth, wrapped up in her favorite fluffy robe, and went downstairs to get the Sunday paper. Humming softly, she fixed a cup of hot chocolate, then sat down and spread the paper on the kitchen table. She frowned when she read the headlines: INFERNO AT DOWNTOWN ROCK CONCERT EIGHT DEAD, TWO HUNDRED INJURED How could she have forgotten about the fire? She quickly read the article, which gave a brief review of the concert, then went on to say that the cause of the fire was still under investigation, although the preliminary report pointed to defective wiring and faulty smoke detectors. Reading the paper brought all the unbelievable horror of the evening rushing back—the terror that had engulfed her, the almost hypnotic glow of the flames as they licked at the building, the bodies of the dead being put into shiny black body bags. How could she have forgotten such a horrible ordeal? And then there was the way Rhys had spirited them out of the stadium. How had he done that? And why couldn’t she remember? She drummed her fingertips on the edge of the table. One minute she had been inside the burning building and the next she had been across the street with no memory of how they had gotten there. Had Rhys been right? Had she been so afraid she had blocked it from her mind? One thing she did know. If it hadn’t been for Rhys, she probably wouldn’t have made it out of the building alive. She read the names of the deceased again. Six of them had been teenagers. One had been a young mother. The last fatality had been a member of the band. Four firemen had suffered smoke inhalation; three had been hospitalized with severe burns. The building was a total loss. Megan was trying to work up an appetite when Shirl entered the kitchen, looking gorgeous in a pair of snowflake pj’s and pink bunny slippers. “Hey, girlfriend, I didn’t expect you to be up so early.” “It’s almost noon.” “Well, after the night you had…” Shirl lifted one shoulder and let it fall. “I thought you’d be out most of the day.” Megan frowned. She had expected to have nightmares last night, or at least to have trouble sleeping, but she had slept like a baby. There had been no bad dreams, and when she woke this morning, she hadn’t even thought of the fire until she read about it in the paper. How could she have forgotten something so traumatic, she wondered again. She pondered that a moment, trying to wrap her mind around the strangeness of it. “Have you eaten?” Shirl asked. “Not yet.” “What are you in the mood for?” “Nothing really.” “Well, you need to eat.” Moving to the fridge, Shirl opened the door. “How about French toast? Waffles? Pancakes? Scrambled eggs, hash browns, and bacon?” She glanced over her shoulder. “Well?” “Pancakes and bacon sounds good.” When Megan started to get up, Shirl waved her off. “I’ll do it. You just relax.” “Shirl…” “What?” Megan ran her finger around the rim of her cup, and then, taking a deep breath, she told Shirl what was bothering her. “Don’t you think it’s odd?” Megan asked when she finished. “I mean…” She shrugged. “It’s like I completely forgot about the fire and everything that happened last night.” After mixing the pancake batter, Shirl pulled a frying pan from under the stove for the bacon. “It does seem odd, but maybe it’s not uncommon. I mean, it was a horrible experience. Maybe your subconscious just wasn’t ready to handle it when you woke up.” “Maybe, but I can’t help thinking there’s more to it…something I can’t put my finger on. It’s like, I don’t know, somebody wiped it from my memory. I guess that sounds really strange.” “Yeah, it does.” “And then…you know, I don’t remember getting out of the building. It’s like, one minute we were inside, and the next we were across the street. Rhys said the reason I don’t remember is because I was so scared.” “Well, that makes sense, I guess.” “I guess. It just seems so, I don’t know, weird.” Shirl sighed heavily. “Girlfriend, the whole world is weird these days. I mean, have you read about all those deaths back East? Bodies drained of blood. It’s like we’re living in the twilight zone.” She turned the bacon, then began ladling batter onto the griddle. “One of the news channels mentioned vampires.” “Vampires! Are you serious?” Megan tilted her head to one side. “You’re loving this, aren’t you?” “Of course not, but it is kind of exciting. Get the syrup and the butter, will you?” Vampires, Megan thought, as she set the syrup and the butter on the table, along with a couple of knives and forks. There were rumors of creatures of the night from time to time. It seemed that whenever there was a mysterious death, some reporter attributed it to werewolves or vampires. She had even heard that you could buy vampire blood on the Internet, but she had laughed it off, certain it was either a joke or just some kind of fake blood for the Goth crowd. Megan sat down at the table across from Shirl. “Looks great, thanks,” she said, and then did a double take when Shirl actually put a pancake and a strip of bacon on her own plate. “I don’t believe it. You’re eating real food?” Shirl blew out an aggrieved sigh. “I deserve it. Besides, I’m on vacation for a week.” “I didn’t know that. What are you going to do?” “Greg has a cabin up in the mountains. He wants to go up there, but I don’t know….” “You should go. It’ll be good for you to get away for a while.” “I don’t think I should leave you alone.” “Don’t be silly. I’m fine. Really.” “Are you sure? I mean, Greg and I can find plenty to do here in town.” “Shirl, I’m a big girl, remember? I think I can get along without you for a few days.” “Well, I really would like to go,” Shirl admitted with a dreamy smile. “Then it’s settled.” Megan slapped her palms on the table. “When are you leaving?” “Tomorrow morning. Early. And we’ll be back next Sunday, not too late, since I have a shoot on Monday.” Megan nodded. “I think it’s just what you need. You’ve been working way too hard lately. I’ll help you pack.” The rest of the day passed quickly. Megan dusted and vacuumed. Shirl did the laundry. Since they’d had such a late breakfast, they skipped lunch and splurged on hot fudge sundaes instead. After packing Shirl’s suitcase, they went out to their favorite Italian restaurant for dinner. “So,” Shirl said, reaching for a bread stick still warm from the oven, “what are you going to do about Rhys Costain?” “I don’t know.” Megan propped her elbows on the table and rested her chin on her folded hands. “When I’m with him, he makes me feel wonderful, beautiful. Special. Safe.” “And when you’re not with him?” “I know he’s hiding something,” Megan said. “I just don’t know what it is.” “Well, you be careful. I’ll call you from the cabin tomorrow night. And I’ll keep my phone on in case you need me.” Shirl hadn’t been kidding when she’d said Greg was picking her up early in the morning. Greg arrived at six, bid a sleepy-eyed Megan a quick hello and good-bye, and whisked Shirl away.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-desire-everlasting-2/page-15.html","bookId":2304,"book":{"id":2304,"title":"Everlasting Desire (Everlasting #2)","description":"Storyline: Everlasting Desire (Everlasting #2) Desire Burns Forever The clientele at Shore\u0027s clothing store includes some of L.A.\u0027s sexiest bachelors.
