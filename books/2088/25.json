{"id":89613,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"By the time my shift was over and the sun had risen on another day, I\u0027d decided to name the game \"pandemonium.\"\n We\u0027d had four arrests, three accidental shootings, two dead dogs -\n \"And a partridge in a pear tree,\" I muttered as I filled out my reports.\n I\u0027d never had a chance to meet with Mandenauer. Hunting would have been pointless anyway, since the woods were overrun with morons.\n Amazingly, not a wolf had been shot. I had to wonder if they\u0027d all turned tail and run to the next county.\n It wouldn\u0027t break my heart any.\n I was also unable to meet Cadotte. I\u0027d called his house, but he wasn\u0027t there, so I left a short, apologetic message. I suspected he was at my place, and I felt kind of bad that I\u0027d left him sitting on my doorstep.\n But I couldn\u0027t leave just yet. He knew where to find me.\n As I was looking through my notes, I discovered that while I might thrive on third shift, my memory did not. I\u0027d forgotten about Tina Wilson.\n I decided to stop by her apartment later today, if not tonight. My days of working in the dark and sleeping in the light appeared to be over - for the duration of our wolf problem.\n \"Ha!\"\n The door slammed. Everyone in the room - me, First Shift, Brad, several of the Clearwater cops -\n jumped. Clyde held a legal-sized sheet of paper in his fist.\n \"Got it,\" he told the room at large.\n We glanced at one another, then back at him.\n \"Got what?\" I asked.\n \"A proclamation from the DNR.\"\n \"What\u0027s it say?\"\n \"Any private citizen caught in the woods with a gun will lose their license for a year.\"\n \"Ouch,\" I murmured. Clyde just smiled.\n While folks in and around Miniwa wouldn\u0027t blink at a few days in jail for illegal firearms transportation, threatening to take away their hunting and fishing privileges - which was the DNR\u0027s specialty - would make people sit up and take notice.\n \"Post this at the Coffee Pot.\" He handed the paper to Brad. \"Then put out the word.\"\n Which meant get some coffee, gas up your squad car, have a doughnut, and while you were at it, let everyone know that the DNR was behind us. The woods were going to be more deserted than a ski hill on the Fourth of July.\n \"This time tomorrow everything should be back to normal.\" Clyde went into his office and shut the door.\n Great. Now he was delusional, too. Had he forgotten the wolf problem?\n As everyone dispersed to spread the news, I knocked on Clyde\u0027s door.\n \"Come!\"\n I went in.\n \"What\u0027s up, Jessie?\" Clyde\u0027s grin didn\u0027t mask the cir-cles under his eyes, the pallor beneath his tan, the sag of his shoulders. He hadn\u0027t forgotten the wolf problem. In fact, he probably remembered it better than I did. Especially when I was in Cadotte\u0027s arms, where I forgot everything.\n I straightened and got down to business. \"I wasn\u0027t able to go out with Mandenauer last night.\"\n \"Of course not. That would have been suicide. Edward and I had dinner.\"\n \"Edward?\"\n He ignored me. \"We also had quite a conversation.\" From the narrowing of Clyde\u0027s eyes, I knew what was coming. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you Cadotte was trouble?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"Yet you\u0027re sleeping with him?\"\n \"How the hell did you know that?\"\n He raised one dark eyebrow. \"I didn\u0027t.\"\n Damn Clyde. He was the best interrogator on the force - and he\u0027d just played me like a green kid with her first felony.\n \"Jessie.\" He shook his head and sat on the edge of his desk. \"I thought better of you.\"\n I lifted my chin. \"I haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I\u0027m an adult. So is he.\"\n \"You find that totem yet?\"\n I blinked at the sudden change of subject. As if the stone had heard us, it swayed between my breasts. I jumped, then had to clench my ringers into fists to keep from reaching for the thing and rousing Clyde\u0027s suspicions.\n \"No. Why?\"\n \"Ever ask Cadotte about it?\"\n \"Why should I?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, Jessie; maybe because he\u0027s an expert on totems. You find one, show it to him, then poof, the next thing we know, the stone is gone.\"\n \"You think he took the totem?\"\n Since I knew he hadn\u0027t, Clyde\u0027s attempt to make me suspicious of Will only convinced me to keep the thing under my shirt - so to speak.\n \"I\u0027m not sure what to think.\"\n Which only made two of us. Everyone was acting weird lately. Except Cadotte. But he\u0027d been strange to begin with.\n My cell phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID. Speak of the Devil. 1 hooked the thing back onto my belt.\n Raising my eyes, I met Clyde\u0027s. From the expression in his, he knew who\u0027d been on the phone.\n He heaved a sigh. \"Be careful. I don\u0027t want you to get hurt.\"\n Zee had said the same thing. Was I such a social reject that everyone took one look at Cadotte and labeled me \"soon to be hurt\"?\n That was a rhetorical question.\n A knock on Clyde\u0027s door had us both lifting our heads. Mandenauer walked in.\n \"Just the guy I wanted to see,\" I began.\n He raised a slightly yellowed brow and shut the door behind him. \"I am at your service.\"\n He bowed, just his head and shoulders in what I was beginning to think of as the German fashion. I half-expected him to click his heels, but he didn\u0027t.\n \"The doctor at the hospital didn\u0027t know anything about the super-rabies.\"\n \"Of course not.\"\n \"Why not? Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s something the doctors ought to know?\"\n Mandenauer shrugged. \"Rabies is rabies to them. The vaccine works on both.\"\n \"Not so much. Didn\u0027t you hear that Mel died? Have you seen the body?\"\n \"Yes to both questions. Sometimes that happens.\"\n \"Well, don\u0027t get too broken up about it,\" I mumbled.\n \"Jessie,\" Clyde warned.\n \"Yeah, yeah.\"\n I rubbed my forehead. I was getting tired, dopey, crankier than usual. I had another question for Manden-auer - it was on the tip of my brain.\n \"Oh!\" I smacked my forehead. \"Ouch.\" I forced myself to lower my hand so I could see Mandenauer. \"I called the CDC.\"\n He didn\u0027t react.\n \"The Centers for Disease Control?\"\n He spread his bony hands wide.\n \"Something is funny there.\"\n \"I have never known the CDC to be very funny.\"\n \"Exactly. The first time I called, they had heard about the virus. When I called back and asked to talk to the doctor, they\u0027d never heard of her.\"\n Mandenauer and Clyde exchanged glances.\n \"Sounds like someone was yanking your chain, Jessie.\"\n \"At the CDC?\"\n \"How long since you slept?\"\n \"I forget.\"\n \"Sleep.\" Mandenauer turned me toward the door. \"Forget about anything but ridding your forest of the wolves. Tonight we hunt at dusk.\"\n \"Dusk?\"\n \"When the sun just sets.\"\n \"I know when the hell dusk is. But why then?\"\n \"It is the time when the wolves come to life. I will be at your house an hour before that.\"\n \"Fine. Whatever.\"\n I was starting to wonder about that first phone call to the CDC. Had someone been screwing with me?\n How could that be?\n A tap on the phone? Interception of my calls?\n Put me and Oliver Stone in the same padded room, thank you. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-25.html","bookId":2088,"book":{"id":2088,"title":"Night Creature: Blue Moon (Nightcreature #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Blue Moon(Night Creature series book 1) \n Miniwa, Wisconsin is under siege, but not by the usual summer tourists.
