{"id":89594,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Cadotte\u0027s voice broke into my thoughts. \"You aren\u0027t going to tell me, are you?\" \"Tell you what?\" \"Why you\u0027re so interested in a stray wolf totem.\" \"I\u0027m curious.\" \"Funny, but you don\u0027t seem the curious type.\" \"You\u0027re wrong.\" I stood. \"Number one on the \u0027 what you need to be a good cop\u0027list is curiosity. Otherwise we wouldn\u0027t keep asking all those annoying questions.\" \"Hmm.\" He got up and strode around his desk, coming too close, crowding me again. I liked my personal circle of space, and he was invading it. But to back off would mean I was nervous, that he affected me. I was and he did, but why let him know? Perhaps one of my other attributes was bull-headed stubbornness. Nah. \"So, should I call you?\" I gaped. \"C-call me?\" There went my tough girl image. \"If I find out anything about the totem.\" Of course. The totem. Not me. Never me. Poof went my silly female fantasy. \"Yeah. Sure.\" I dug out a card with my various phone numbers. He stared at it, then lifted his eyes to mine. He was still too close. I was still not backing away. \"Jessie?\" he murmured. \"Short for Jessica?\" \"As if.\" Jessica was the name of a pink-cheeked, blond-haired, petite ballerina girl. He laughed. \"I can keep this?\" He flicked a finger at the totem, which remained on his desk. I hesitated. Though I hadn\u0027t logged the thing into evidence yet, I should. Whether it meant anything or not, who could say? Maybe William Cadotte. \"For now.\" I grabbed a plain piece of paper, scribbled on it, then stabbed my finger at the bottom. \"Sign this.\" He picked up a pen and signed before asking, \"What is it?\" A lawyer he wasn\u0027t. \"That\u0027s evidence. You just signed for it, but I\u0027ll need the thing back.\" \"All right.\" Silence again. Time to say good-bye. I wasn\u0027t sure how. \"I\u0027ll be in touch. Jessie.\" The way he said my name made me recall the sheen of his skin in the moonlight. The way his muscles had rippled, the way his earring had swayed. When was the last time I\u0027d had sex? Far too long, from the direction of my thoughts. Far too long, since I couldn\u0027t quite recall. Not the when, nor the why, I could barely recall the who. I needed to remember that Cadotte was an expert consultant, nothing more, before I made a bigger fool of myself than I already had. I got a grip and pulled out what company manners I had. \"Thanks for your time, Professor.\" He took the hand I offered. My mind went all girlie again. I wanted to know what those dark, long fingers could do; I wanted to feel those large, rough palms against my skin. I wanted to see everything I\u0027 d seen last night. Touch it, taste it, too. \"My friends call me Will.\" He released my hand. Friends. Right. I was an idiot. \"I won\u0027t,\" I replied, then escaped. Yes, my mother would be mortified at my behavior. This time I would have agreed with her. There was no cause for rudeness, beyond my own sense of inadequacy and a tiny kernel of fear that lodged hard and cool beneath my breastbone. William Cadotte scared the hell out of me, and I didn\u0027t like it one bit. So I lashed out. The need had been born in me long ago to hurt before I could be hurt, reject before I could be rejected, walk away before I could be walked away from. I couldn\u0027t change who I was inside, or out for that matter, suddenly become well adjusted, pretty, and proud of it. Don\u0027t psychoanalyze me; I\u0027ve been doing it myself for years. I\u0027d had friends, but I never let any get too close. I was always waiting for them to turn on me as everyone else had. I\u0027d been in love once, right out of high school. The relationship had ended badly. Probably because I\u0027d been expecting it to. I knew who I was. A good cop. A decent person. But a loner. I wasn\u0027t scared of much, because I had so little to lose. Which was just the way I liked it. I\u0027d been telling myself this for years, believing it, too. So why did I suddenly feel lonely and sad in the middle of the day? I left the university and returned to the station, hoping Dr. Bozeman might have left a message, or even the report. I\u0027d have had better luck hoping the sun would rise in the west. I filed my own report, then logged the evidence and placed it in the evidence room, leaving the paper Cadotte had signed with the rest. Since my shift didn\u0027t start for several hours and I hadn\u0027t eaten anything lately, I returned to my apartment, where I made a small pizza, watched sitcoms, and tried not to think of the case for a while. When it was time for work, I changed into my uniform and returned to the station. I was barely in the door before Zee started shouting. \"Hell and tarnation, what were you doing at that school today, girl?\" \"Hello, Zee. Nice to see you, too.\" \"Fuck that. You could have been killed.\" \"I wasn\u0027t. Get over it.\" She blinked. I was usually more deferential to her moods - or rather mood: she only had one and it was bad. I knew she meant well. Zee might cuss like a construction worker, but her old-time upbringing made her reserve the F-word for serious concerns. She\u0027d been worried about me. I softened, leaned over the counter, and got a faceful of smoke for my trouble as Zee finished lighting her next cigarette off the stub of the last one. \"Don\u0027t you have somewhere to be?\" she asked. I stared at her. She scowled back, not in the spirit to be mollified - by words, at any rate. I\u0027d bring her a doughnut and coffee in an hour. Nothing said \"I\u0027m sorry\" like fried dough and caffeine. \"Any messages for me?\" \"Did I give you any?\" \"Uh, no.\" \"Unless First and Second Shift screwed up again, what does that mean?\" Zee never referred to the other dispatchers by name. Until they\u0027d worked here as long as she had - and no one ever would, or could - they hadn\u0027t earned the right to a name. \"I guess that means I have no messages.\" Damn, I\u0027d have to dog Bozeman\u0027s every step tomorrow. \"Sometimes you are too bright for your own good, princess.\" Zee turned her back on me. I left thinking I\u0027d better bring back two doughnuts and coffee with half-and-half if I wanted to ever get into Zee\u0027s good graces again. The night was uneventful - a nice change from the one before. I remembered that Clyde had asked me to talk to Brad and Zee, which I did. After eating both the doughnuts and drinking all of the coffee, Zee agreed to the wisdom of keeping her mouth shut about Miniwa\u0027s little problem. Brad didn\u0027t need bribery, just a threat, which had always been my specialty. I went home on time for a change, slept until two, and headed for the ME\u0027s office. Dr. Bozeman should have had time to examine at least one of his bodies, if not both. Should have. Would have. If he\u0027d had any bodies. \"What is going on here?\" I shouted over the amazing din created by Clyde, Dr. Bozeman, and his itty-bitty secretary. My boss shoved the other two out of his way. \"The bodies are gone.\" \"What?\" \"That\u0027s what I said. When Bozeman got here this morning, no bodies. They could have been gone since yesterday for all we know.\" He rubbed his eyes. \"This just makes my day.\" \"They couldn\u0027t get up and run off.\" I glanced at the secretary. \"Right?\" She ignored me. I couldn\u0027t say that I blamed her. I returned my attention to Clyde. \"What happened?\" \"No idea. But we\u0027d better find out.\" Clyde beckoned me away from the others. \"Jessie, you aren\u0027t gonna like this, but before you explode, hear me out.\" I didn\u0027t like it already, but I shrugged, so he continued. \"The DNR is sending someone to kill the wolf.\" I blinked, frowned, shook my head. I could not have heard that right. \"But didn\u0027t you tell them? I mean, how could anyone from away be better at hunting these forests than - ?\" I broke off. \"You?\" \"Well, yeah. You\u0027ve always sent me when we had animal trouble before.\" \"I know, and I\u0027m sorry as hell about it, but I have no choice. You know how the DNR is, especially about their wolves. They\u0027re sending a Jdger-Sucher.\" \"A what?\" \"That\u0027s hunter-searcher in German.\" Clyde lifted one broad shoulder. \"It\u0027s what he calls himself.\" \"Who?\" \"Edward Mandenauer. From what I hear he\u0027s the Special Forces of wolf hunters.\" \"I can\u0027t take my rifle and blast this thing into the next county?\" \"I wish. But this is out of my hands. The guy\u0027s hired and here already.\" He paused and rubbed the back of his neck as if it ached. \"I was hoping you\u0027d go to the office, drive him out to the scene. I won\u0027t be able to today.\" \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\" \"I rarely kid, Jessie.\" How true. Five minutes later I was at the station. First Shift was at the desk. Hell, I didn\u0027t even know her name anymore. Had I ever? I glanced at the tag on her chest, but the word was too long and too Polish to figure out without closer scrutiny and a translator. Her eyebrows lifted in surprise at seeing me in the office two shifts ahead of myself. \"Clyde wants me to meet and greet his super-elite wolf killer. I can\u0027t wait to get a load of this geek.\" First Shift didn\u0027t answer. Instead she stared over my shoulder with a frozen smile. Ah, hell. I turned. I had to force myself not to gape, but I did blink. The man was still there. He was still the most pathetic excuse for a super-elite wolf killer I\u0027d ever seen. Not that I\u0027d seen very many. Mandenauer stared at me with eyes so light a blue they were eerie. His white hair had the muted hue of the once blond; his complexion was that of the Aryan brotherhood ventured out in the sun too many times. He was tall, cadaverous thin, and at least eighty-five. I couldn\u0027t imagine this man striking terror into the heart of any beast. But then, a gun did wondrous things for the fear factor. I decided that the best defense was an offense. I\u0027d pretend I hadn\u0027t said anything rude and maybe he\u0027d let me. \"Hello. I\u0027m Officer McQuade.\" I offered my hand. \"Sheriff Johnston sent me. He\u0027s... unavoidably detained.\" Mandenauer continued to stare. He did not shake my hand. The silence became awkward. I lowered my arm and gave in. \"I apologize for my rudeness.\" He dipped his chin, a courtly, old-world gesture. \"No matter, Officer.\" Though I\u0027d been likening him to the master race, his accent still surprised me. He was German, Austrian maybe. The accent was one that never went away no matter how many years the speaker spent in the U.S. - just listen to Schwarzenegger. \"What has detained the sheriff?\" \"A problem at the ME\u0027s office. The case of the disappearing bodies.\" He straightened to a height of at least six-four. How did he sneak through the woods without smacking into a tree limb? His gaze became shrewd. \"The bodies? Were they bitten?\" \"Yeah.\" He started for the door. I glanced at First Shift. She appeared as confused as I was. I hurried after him, catching up on the front steps. \"Sir? Mr. Mandenauer. Don\u0027t you want me to take you to the last place the wolf was seen?\" \"Not yet. Escort me to the office of the medical examiner.\" I raised an eyebrow at the order. I didn\u0027t mind being a chauffeur - much - but I didn\u0027t care for being a slave. He must have seen mutiny in my eyes, because he touched my arm and murmured, \"Please.\" For an instant I almost liked him. Until I remembered why he was here. I pulled my arm out of reach. \"Sure. Fine. Whatever,\" I muttered. \"But why are you so interested?\" \"Because we may have a bigger problem in your fair town than one mad wolf.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-6.html","bookId":2088,"book":{"id":2088,"title":"Night Creature: Blue Moon (Nightcreature #1)","description":"Storyline: Blue Moon(Night Creature series book 1) Miniwa, Wisconsin is under siege, but not by the usual summer tourists.
