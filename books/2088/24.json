I nearly passed out from the beer fumes, but I managed to stay upright and keep him from snatching the gun.\\n\\n Jerry Uber wasn\u0027t the brightest star in the sky. His shaved head only proved my point. Jerry didn\u0027t have the smoothest noggin or the best skin. Right now he looked like a lumpy egg with diaper rash.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t carry a rifle without a case in the middle of town, Jerry. You know that.\"\\n\\n \"How am I gonna shoot rabid wolves if my gun\u0027s in the case?\"\\n\\n \"Shoot?\" I put my finger in my ear and jiggled it. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Me and the other men.\" He puffed out his chest. His beer belly went with it. \"We\u0027re gonna do what you cops haven\u0027t.\"\\n\\n I glanced up and down the street. The tourists were gone. Only the gun-toting citizens remained.\\n\\n Vigilantes. I hated these guys.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well you\u0027re gonna have a tough time without your gun.\" I headed for my car.\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n Jerry danced around behind me as if the beer he\u0027d already drunk today needed to be released right now. Maybe I\u0027d get lucky and he\u0027d relieve himself on the street. Then I could arrest him and there\u0027d be one less drunken idiot in the woods.\\n\\n \"Thass my gun. You can\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, I can.\" I unloaded the thing and pocketed the bullets, then laid it on the passenger seat of my car. \"You can pick it up from Zee when you\u0027re sober. Bring along your case.\"\\n\\n \"Zelda?\" He shook his head and put up his hands. \"Aw, Jessie. You know, she scares the crap out of me.\"\\n\\n \"You, me, and everyone else in town. That\u0027s why she\u0027s in charge of the guns.\"\\n\\n Since Jerry and I had had dealings before, he didn\u0027t argue. He went home. No doubt to get another gun.\\n\\n I picked up my radio, not bothering to give my call sign, since I wasn\u0027t technically working. \"I need to talk to Clyde right now.\"\\n\\n \"He isn\u0027t here. Can I help you?\"\\n\\n The voice was new - young, hopeful. She wouldn\u0027t last.\\n\\n \"Yeah, find him. Tell him we\u0027ve got armed citizens all over town and the tourists are leaving.\"\\n\\n I spent the next hour confiscating weapons. When my car was full and my pockets weighted with bullets, I drove to the station.\\n\\n I knew I was fighting a losing battle. These guys all had more guns. They\u0027d be out in the woods come nightfall. Someone was going to get shot. I could only hope that that someone wasn\u0027t me.\\n\\n Clyde had never materialized, which was strange. For all his minor annoyances, he had always been on top of things.\\n\\n No Mandenauer, either. Not so strange - considering the source.\\n\\n After I\u0027d tagged, recorded, then locked up all the guns, I did manage to find Zee. In the break room with a cup of coffee on her left, a lit cigarette on her right, and a roast beef sandwich the size of a small dog in the center.\\n\\n I swear she ate red meat at every meal. Zee\u0027s longevity was a never-ending mystery, like so many others. I\u0027d heard stories of Great-aunt Helga who smoked all her life and lived to be a hundred and four, contrasted with stories of jogging health-food fanatics who keeled over at forty-two. Go figure.\\n\\n Since Zee was enjoying herself, I backed out of the break room so she could continue.\\n\\n \"Where you goin\u0027 ?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t even turn my way. The woman had ears like a bat. And she looked like one, too.\\n\\n \"I need to find Clyde.\"\\n\\n \"Sit.\"\\n\\n Zee indicated the chair to her right. With a glance at the smoldering cigarette, I took the one to her left.\\n\\n \"Want half?\" She pointed at the sandwich.\\n\\n The beef hung out of the bread - thick, red, and juicy. The scent, combined with that of horseradish, reminded me of the wolf pyre in the woods. I shook my head and swallowed hard.\\n\\n Zee shrugged. \"More for me.\"\\n\\n She made short work of the sandwich. The woman could certainly eat. How she could be stick-thin was another of life\u0027s little mysteries. Although now that I thought about it, Zee had a habit of gorging a day here, a day there, then existing on cigarettes and coffee in between.\\n\\n With a sigh and a pat for her distended belly, she sat back and lifted her cigarette. I made a face. She blew smoke rings at me.\\n\\n I waved them away. \"You know I hate that.\"\\n\\n \"Which is why I do it.\" She winked. \"I hear some evidence has turned up missing.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Since I\u0027m in charge of the evidence room, that upsets me.\"\\n\\n The sharp tap of her fingernail against the table punctuated Zee\u0027s irritation. I braced myself for the explosion. Instead, she took another drag and blew it out slower than slow.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t exactly want to dance a jig when I heard.\"\\n\\n \"Any clue where the stuff is?\"\\n\\n \"If I knew, then it wouldn\u0027t be missing.\"\\n\\n She lifted one eyebrow. \"Are you getting smart with me?\"\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am. I need to find Clyde.\"\\n\\n \"Good luck. He went ten-seven after he left the hospital.\"\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll call him at home.\" I shoved back my chair.\\n\\n Zee grabbed my arm. \"Leave him be.\"\\n\\n Something in Zee\u0027s voice made me stay where I was. \"Why?\"\\n\\n She took another drag on her cigarette, blew the smoke out the corner of her mouth in a stream that shot away from me for a change. \"He\u0027s taking it hard.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Clyde went to school with Mel\u0027s dad. He had to tell Tony what happened. Cherry\u0027s a mess.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" I didn\u0027t know what else to say.\\n\\n \"I told Clyde about the tourists and the gun freaks. He called in some extra help from Clearwater.\"\\n\\n I thought of the amount of citizenry with guns, the depth, darkness, and expanse of the woods. .\\n\\n \"That\u0027ll work.\"\\n\\n My sarcasm must have been showing, because Zee snorted. \"Who knows, maybe the idiots will thin out the wolf population.\"\\n\\n \"Or the other way around.\"\\n\\n \"Either way, we win.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure whether to laugh or cry.\\n\\n \"Heard from your mom lately?\" Zee asked.\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n Zee lit another cigarette from the embers of the first. \"Guess not.\"\\n\\n She took a deep drag and let the smoke drift out on a contented sigh. She and I hadn\u0027t had a good talk in a long time. Considering our age difference, you wouldn\u0027t think we could. But Zee was young at heart, despite the probable black tar therein. She was the best friend I\u0027d ever had, and I loved her.\\n\\n \"You gonna tell Mom about the guy?\"\\n\\n \"What guy?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t screw with me, girl. Cadotte. Is he as good as he looks?\"\\n\\n \"When did you see him? And how do you know... \" I fumbled for a word. \"Anything?\"\\n\\n \"I have my sources.\"\\n\\n She no doubt did. Sources she\u0027d never reveal to me. The woman knew everything that went on in Miniwa. It was downright terrifying. And often quite handy. Unless it was me she knew everything about.\\n\\n I narrowed my eyes. \"You didn\u0027t tell Clyde, did you?\"\\n\\n Zee shook her head. \"Clyde\u0027s got enough problems right now. He thinks of you as his daughter - or near enough. He\u0027d kill Cadotte if he found out you were banging him.\"\\n\\n \"Nice,\" I murmured. Though banging was probably a pretty good word, considering what we\u0027d been doing.\\n\\n But I was more interested in Zee\u0027s observation of Clyde\u0027s feelings for me. \"Clyde thinks of me like a daughter?\" heard the hope in my voice and cursed myself. I\u0027d never had a father. I didn\u0027t need one now.\\n\\n Zee contemplated me a moment. \"Sure. Just like I think of you as the granddaughter I\u0027ll never have.\"\\n\\n \"No gramma worth her salt would ever use the word banging.\"\\n\\n Zee cackled. \"Aren\u0027t you glad?\"\\n\\n \"Damn straight.\"\\n\\n Zee and I had talked about many things over the years, but mostly present tense. What we\u0027d done today, what we\u0027d like to do tomorrow, whose butt was better than Jimmy Smits\u0027s.\\n\\n She\u0027d told me once that her family was dead. She\u0027d come to Miniwa because she had nowhere else to go and stayed because she liked the trees. Her expression had been so sad at the time, I never had the heart to ask her anything about her past again.\\n\\n \"So what are you gonna tell Mummy Dearest about the guy?\"\\n\\n \"Uh, nothing?\"\\n\\n \"That would be my advice. She\u0027d have a conniption.\"\\n\\n \"You got that right.\"\\n\\n Zee had met my mother once. It had been hate at first sight - on both their parts. My mother said I clung to Zee like moss to a tree just to annoy her, and maybe she was right. But Zee had given me more affection and support in the years I had worked with her than my mother had given me all of my life.\\n\\n Pathetic but true.\\n\\n \"Although I might have to agree with Mummy on this one.\"\\n\\n I gaped. \"What?\"\\n\\n Zee shrugged. \"Unless you\u0027re just doing him.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d actually been doing me - quite often - but that was my business.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing serious starting up with you and him, is there?\" Zee was staring at me too closely. I began to sweat. \"You haven\u0027t mistaken sex for love or anything, have you?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. Do I look stupid?\"\\n\\n \"Never said that you did. I just don\u0027t want you to get hurt.\"\\n\\n \"And that would happen because... ?\"\\n\\n \"Mixed relationships never work out.\"\\n\\n I knew Zee didn\u0027t much care for the Indians, but I\u0027d never expected her to be so blatant in her prejudice.\\n\\n \"What are you trying to say, Zee?\"\\n\\n \"I went out with a beautiful man once.\" Her eyes went dreamy. \"It was nice at first. But not for long. He actually thought I should be grateful.\" She snorted. \"Women propositioned him right in front of me like I wasn\u0027t even there.\"\\n\\n I blinked. \"By mixed, you mean - \"\\n\\n \"Cadotte\u0027s hot, Jessie. You\u0027re... \" She lifted one shoulder, then lowered it.\\n\\n \"Not. I know. Big deal.\"\\n\\n \"Now, now. No need to get testy. Face the facts. You aren\u0027t Marilyn Monroe. A guy like him, pretty soon he\u0027ll start listening to all those people who are asking him what he sees in you.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d thought the same thing. But the more I got to know Cadotte, the less I could see him caring what people thought.\\n\\n Second Shift appeared in the doorway. She glanced at Zee, flinched, then focused on me. \"Jessie, we got trouble in the woods.\"\\n\\n \"No shit,\" Zee muttered.\\n\\n \"If you can\u0027t be constructive... \" I began.\\n\\n \"Shut the fuck up,\" Zee finished.\\n\\n It was, after all, her favorite saying.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" I asked the youngster, who appeared to have swallowed a frog.\\n\\n \"The um... uh... \" She waved her hand back toward the command center.\\n\\n \"Two words?\" I held up two fingers, then tugged on my ear. \"Sounds like?\"\\n\\n She tilted her head and stared.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t confuse her, Jessie.\" Zee slurped what must be, by now, ice-cold coffee.\\n\\n \"You never let me have any fun.\" I sighed. \"The um... uh... what?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"The other patrol. Two Adam Four.\"\\n\\n Henry. \"What about him?\"\\n\\n \"Shots fired in the forest. Screaming. Something about an ambulance. Backup. Help.\"\\n\\n My gaze met Zee\u0027s.\\n\\n \"Let the games begin,\" she muttered. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-24.html","bookId":2088,"book":{"id":2088,"title":"Night Creature: Blue Moon (Nightcreature #1)","description":"Storyline: Blue Moon(Night Creature series book 1) \\n Miniwa, Wisconsin is under siege, but not by the usual summer tourists.
