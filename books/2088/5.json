{"id":89593,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"He raised a brow. \"Miss me?\"\\n\\n I pushed past him into the room, but he was alone. \"What did you do with Dr. Cadotte?\"\\n\\n His earring swayed when he tilted his head. \"Do?\"\\n\\n He was also wearing glasses. No wonder I hadn\u0027t recognized him. Not that the small, round wire frames could detract from the sheer beauty of his face or the intensity of his eyes, but they made him appear...older, wiser, scholarly. And sexier than he\u0027d been while standing naked in the moonlight.\\n\\n I scowled at the unusual direction of my thoughts. Well, unusual for me anyway. I rarely thought about the sexual nature of anyone, specifically a stranger. Though I could be excused in this case, since I\u0027d seen more of this man than almost any other of my acquaintance.\\n\\n I recovered my sanity enough to hear what he\u0027d said. \"Are you Dr. Cadotte?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n My glance around the area was rhetorical. No one could hide in this joke of an office. I raised a brow.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m William Cadotte, but I\u0027m not a doctor. Yet. There\u0027s that pesky matter of a thesis, which I haven\u0027t been able to finish.\" He moved into the room. \"Can I help you?\"\\n\\n His voice captured me again as it had last night. Not loud, yet still powerful, the ebb and flow just different enough to make me listen more closely to everything he said.\\n\\n I\u0027m not sure if he meant to crowd me or not, but the place was small and he was big. His heat brushed my face. Or perhaps I was just blushing again - something I seemed to do a lot of around him.\\n\\n \"No,\" I blurted. \"I mean yes. Hell.\"\\n\\n I was blabbering like a teenager. How could he seem taller, broader, more intimidating with his clothes on?\\n\\n \"Which is it? Yes, no, or hell?\"\\n\\n I could smell him, that same scent from last night - wind, trees, a certain wildness. He stared at me intently, as if I fascinated him, and that couldn\u0027t be true. A man who looked like he did would not stare at a woman like Jessie McQuade unless he -\\n\\n My thoughts tumbled into an abyss. Unless he what? There was no reason for him to stare. None. So why was he?\\n\\n \"I wanted to talk to William Cadotte. I didn\u0027t know he was you.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\" He pulled off his glasses and slipped them into the pocket of his blue work shirt, then patted the pocket gently. \"Or actually I don\u0027t see very well up close without these. Age and too many books.\"\\n\\n I made a noncommittal murmur. He didn\u0027t appear much older than me. However, appearances were deceiving. Like a host of other things.\\n\\n \"What did you want to talk about? I assume you don\u0027t plan to arrest me for indecent exposure, since you didn\u0027t know who I was.\"\\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027d like to forget all about that.\"\\n\\n \"Would you?\"\\n\\n No.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n He gave a knowing smirk, which I did my best to ignore.\\n\\n \"Did you catch your wolf?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027 Fraid not.\"\\n\\n His eyes said, / told you so, but to his credit he didn\u0027t voice the words.\\n\\n \"Did your bite victim get her shots?\"\\n\\n \"Nope. She\u0027s a little too dead for them to help.\"\\n\\n His mouth opened, shut. He tried to run his fingers through his hair, found nothing there to run them through, and let his hand drop back to his side.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that a bit quick, even for rabies?\"\\n\\n I shrugged but didn\u0027t elaborate. Clyde wanted to keep things quiet, and I\u0027d already said enough.\\n\\n \"What can I do for you?\" He glanced at my T-shirt. \"Are you here as an officer or a private citizen?\"\\n\\n His gaze lingered on my breasts, something that happened to me a lot. Guys might not be interested in me, but since I\u0027d hit a 38 D cup in the eighth grade - much to my dismay and mortification - they had been interested in what I stored inside my T-shirt.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on my own time, following up with the case.\" His eyes met mine; they didn\u0027t stray south again. \"I have a question, and I was told you were the expert.\"\\n\\n \"In what? I have several and varied interests.\"\\n\\n His lips twitched. I ignored the implication. I\u0027d never been any good at flirting. What a surprise.\\n\\n Instead, I dug the totem out of my pocket, then held out my hand, palm up. The tiny wolf lay in the center.\\n\\n Before I could ask a single question he snatched the stone and hurried around the side of his desk, turning on the lamp as he went.\\n\\n \"Hey! That\u0027s evidence, Slick.\"\\n\\n His answer was a grunt. He tilted the lamp so the glare was square on the totem, squinted, muttered, and pulled out his glasses.\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Shh!\"\\n\\n So much for the charming flirt. Cadotte now ignored me as he peered at the carved wolf, mumbled, and scribbled notes on a scrap of paper he\u0027d torn randomly from what looked to be a student essay.\\n\\n I settled into the only chair not piled with books and waited. As I waited, I also watched. I couldn\u0027t help myself.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t dressed like any professor I\u0027d ever had. But then I\u0027d gone to technical school in Madison.\\n\\n While the city had a reputation - at least in Wisconsin - for being a hotbed of anarchy, my police science instructors had been nothing if not staid. None of them would ever have worn a faded cotton shirt and even more faded jeans. An earring was out of the question.\\n\\n Of course the sight of his jeans only made me wonder if he was wearing anything beneath them. Just because he hadn\u0027t bothered with underwear under his cutoffs didn\u0027t mean he didn\u0027t wear it to work. I considered what it would be like to sit in his class, listen to him lecture, knowing he was naked inside the denim. I shifted in my chair and forced my thoughts away from last night.\\n\\n Perhaps fifteen minutes passed before he glanced up, blinked as if he\u0027d forgotten I was there, tried to rub his eyes, smacked his knuckles into his glasses, and removed them.\\n\\n Why did I find his absentminded professor behavior so appealing?\\n\\n \"Well?\" I demanded.\\n\\n \"Where did you get this?\"\\n\\n \"I thought I was asking the questions?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t answer yours until you answer a few of mine.\"\\n\\n \"Fine. Center line of Highway One-ninety-nine.\"\\n\\n He frowned. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"You and me both. The accident last night - \"\\n\\n \"With the wolf?\" His gaze was as sharp as his voice.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the one.\"\\n\\n His eyes shifted from keen to distracted in the space of an instant. Figuring he was deep in thought, I let him stay there as long as I could. Of course that wasn\u0027t very long. I never said I was patient.\\n\\n \"Professor Cadotte?\"\\n\\n My voice brought him back from wherever it was that he\u0027d gone. \"Mmm?\"\\n\\n \"Can you tell me what this is? Who might have dropped the thing? Any clues as to why it was lying in the middle of the highway?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Maybe. And none at all.\"\\n\\n Well, that was what I got for asking too many nonspecific questions. I tried again. \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Totem. Or dodaim in Ojibwe.\"\\n\\n \"That much I knew. But it\u0027s different from the ones I\u0027ve seen in town.\"\\n\\n \"The figures they sell two for a dollar at the T-shirt shop?\" I nodded and he made a face. \"A waste of bad plastic. What you have here is an Ojibwe wolf clan totem. Whoever lost this is probably frantic to get it back.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Family protection, spiritual power, magic.\"\\n\\n \"Woo-woo,\" I muttered. I hated woo-woo.\\n\\n His glance was quick and probing. \"You say that as if you don\u0027t believe.\"\\n\\n \"In magic stones and wolf spirits? You got it.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose you only believe in what you can see, hear, and touch.\"\\n\\n \"What else is there?\"\\n\\n \"What we know is true but can\u0027t prove.\"\\n\\n \"Bullshit?\"\\n\\n \"Faith, Officer.\"\\n\\n I gave a snort so unladylike my mother would have fainted if she\u0027d heard it. William Cadotte merely smiled. For some reason he found me amusing. Like a pet or a child, maybe an imbecile.\\n\\n \"Faith is for fools who don\u0027t know their own mind,\" I snapped.\\n\\n As a kid I\u0027d spent countless hours praying for my daddy to come home. He hadn\u0027t. I\u0027d spent equal time praying to be like everyone else. I wasn\u0027t. So I\u0027d given up praying long ago.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather be a fool,\" he said quietly, \"than believe in nothing at all.\"\\n\\n I did believe in something - facts - but I found no reason to tell him that. Living in the middle of woo-woo land had taught me quite quickly that arguing with someone who believed the unbelievable was like smacking your head against a brick wall. Maybe someday you\u0027d move the brick, but you were more likely to be dead first. 1 changed the subject.\\n\\n \"Any idea who might belong to that totem?\"\\n\\n He turned away and I frowned. Up until now he\u0027d looked me in the eye when he spoke to me. Why the sudden change? Unless he couldn\u0027t lie to my face.\\n\\n \"Professor? You said you might know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m familiar with a few of the wolf clan in the area.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027m one, too.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a fraternity or something?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n He faced me again, and any amusement I might have seen once was gone. Had I offended him? I wasn\u0027t sure how, but then, I rarely understood how I\u0027d pissed someone off. Queen of the social gaffe? Me?\\n\\n \"In Ojibwe tradition each person belongs to a clan, the descent of which comes through the father.\\n\\n Legend has it that we are the ancestors of the animal our clan is named for. So even if you were of the Lac du Flambeau band and I was Grand Portage, which I am, if we were wolf clan, we were blood. We couldn\u0027t marry.\"\\n\\n \"Double damn,\" I said dryly.\\n\\n His lips quirked. Maybe I hadn\u0027t offended him after all.\\n\\n \"In other words, your people believed that wolf clan members descended from the wolves - \"\\n\\n \"And bear clan from the bear, crane from the crane. Exactly.\"\\n\\n \"Interesting.\" And weird.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a legend. Not too many of us keep up with to-temic clan lore these days.\"\\n\\n \"Except for you.\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"It\u0027s my job, even if I didn\u0027t believe we should keep the old ways alive.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know who might belong to this totem?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n He picked up the tiny black herald, rolled the stone between his fingers. The thought of him using those fingers on me in much the same way made me forget for an instant what I was doing here.\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t a common wolf clan totem,\" he continued, and I yanked my mind from fantasy to reality. \"I\u0027d like to keep this to study some more. I\u0027ve never seen one like it.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s so different?\"\\n\\n \"The wolf is... odd, and there are markings that disturb me. Something is not quite right.\"\\n\\n Disturb? Odd? Not right?\\n\\n \"What are you getting at?\"\\n\\n \"Ever heard of a manitou?\"\\n\\n \"What?\" His quick change in topic left me floundering to catch up. \"You mean a spirit?\"\\n\\n \"Kind of. Manitou means \u0027 mystery,\u0027\u0027 godlike,\u0027\u0027 essence.\u0027An all-encompassing spirit. Legend has it that Kitchi-Manitou, the great mystery, created all.\"\\n\\n The great mystery. Despite my skepticism of all things woo-woo, I liked that. The great mystery was a good phrase for God and everything in that realm.\\n\\n \"Everyone has manitoulike attributes,\" Cadotte went on. \"We each have our special talent. Yours must be sarcasm.\"\\n\\n \"Ha-ha.\"\\n\\n He quirked a brow. \"Or maybe something hidden, which I\u0027ll uncover later.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t count on it, Slick. What\u0027s your special attribute?\"\\n\\n \"Besides my great big - \" I caught my breath. \"Brain?\"\\n\\n The air hissed out through my teeth, making a derisive sound. \"Yeah, besides that.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you\u0027ll give me a chance to show you my special talent sometime.\"\\n\\n \"I repeat, don\u0027t count on it.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"Getting back to my story. Most of the manitous are helpful. They\u0027re guardians over us poor humans.\"\\n\\n \"And the ones that aren\u0027t helpful?\"\\n\\n \"Two. Both are man-hunting manitous. Weendigos, or the Great Cannibals, and the Matchi-auwishuk.\"\\n\\n \"Translation?\"\\n\\n His smile faded. \"The Evil Ones.\"\\n\\n Even though I believed none of this, the hair on my forearms tingled.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like the sound of either one,\" I admitted. \"But what do they have to do with our totem?\"\\n\\n \"The markings on this wolf remind me of certain drawings I\u0027ve studied of Matchi-auwishuk.\"\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\\n\\n \"Swell.\" Silence fell between us.\\n\\n \"Why are you so interested in this?\" he asked.\\n\\n Good question. The totem could be anyone\u0027s, dropped at the scene of the accident for any number of reasons. It might not have anything to do with Miss Larson at all.\\n\\n But I found it a tad too coincidental to discover a wolf clan totem at the scene of an accident involving a wolf. That, combined with the information on manitous and evil ones, as well as the violent death of the victim within twenty-four hours...\\n\\n Well, call me silly, but my nerve endings were doing the tango.\\n\\n I might not believe in woo-woo, or anything I couldn\u0027t verify by fact, but I\u0027d had enough hunches turn out true that I\u0027d learned long ago not to ignore the steady hum in my head that said something was rotten in Min-iwa. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-5.html","bookId":2088,"book":{"id":2088,"title":"Night Creature: Blue Moon (Nightcreature #1)","description":"Storyline: Blue Moon(Night Creature series book 1) \\n Miniwa, Wisconsin is under siege, but not by the usual summer tourists.
