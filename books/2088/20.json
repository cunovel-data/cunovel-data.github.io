Considering it was about four in the morning, this wasn\u0027t a big shock.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure if Cherry was sleeping or if she\u0027d gone to the hospital with Mel and not yet returned.\\n\\n Either way, 1 wasn\u0027t going to interview her until a more humane part of the morning.\\n\\n By then I\u0027d be able to read over Brad\u0027s notes. I patted my pocket, relieved to discover the notebook was still there. I\u0027d forgotten about it in all the excitement. If I was lucky, Brad had done a bang-up job and my interview with Cherry would be blessedly short. But I wasn\u0027t counting on it.\\n\\n I checked in with Zee. I should have known better.\\n\\n \"Christ on a crutch, Jessie. Where have you been?\"\\n\\n \"With Mandenauer. In the woods. Where else?\"\\n\\n \"You were gone half the night. Isn\u0027t he some hot-shit hunter? Like you.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s right here.\"\\n\\n I slid a glance at Mandenauer, but he\u0027d leaned his head back on the seat and closed his eyes. At his age it was definitely past his bedtime.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d left him in the woods,\" Zee snarled.\\n\\n She obviously couldn\u0027t care less if she insulted our guest. Why should he be any different from the rest of the planet?\\n\\n \"Did you get anything?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"One.\"\\n\\n \"What did it look like?\"\\n\\n I frowned at the radio. What an odd question. Besides, I had no idea. I\u0027d only seen the wolf through the flames.\\n\\n \"Cinnamon-shaded female,\" Mandenauer said, his eyes still closed. \"About one year old.\"\\n\\n I repeated the information to Zee. Silence came over the line. That was a first. I shook the mike. \"Zee?\\n\\n Where\u0027d you go?\"\\n\\n She coughed - long and hard - her lifelong smoker\u0027s hack. By all rights, she should be dead from the cigarettes, if not the mileage. In the end, the force of her cough would probably be the death of Zelda Hupmen.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" she wheezed. \"Got a call. Since it\u0027s been so damn boring for the last hour, I couldn\u0027t contain my excitement.\"\\n\\n \"You want me to take it?\"\\n\\n \"Nope. Nothing but a dead deer on the road. Officer is already en route. Why don\u0027t you take creepy-crawly home and then go there yourself?\"\\n\\n \"Now?\"\\n\\n \"Now. You came on early today and stayed late yesterday. Clyde told me to even out the overtime. He can\u0027t afford it.\"\\n\\n There was the Clyde I knew.\\n\\n Ten minutes later I parked next to the car Mandenauer indicated was his. Long and black, all it needed was curtains on the windows to be mistaken for a hearse.\\n\\n \"Any dead bodies in the back?\" I asked.\\n\\n Mandenauer sniffed. \"This is a Cadillac. A classic. Worth three times what I have paid for it.\"\\n\\n \"You must have paid a penny.\"\\n\\n Mandenauer ignored my jibe, climbed in his car, and rumbled into the fading night. I climbed the steps to my apartment, the bandolier still strung across my chest, my rifle unfired. At least I wouldn\u0027t have to clean the thing tonight. I planned to dive right into bed as soon as I put all my weapons away.\\n\\n I was tired - an unusual occurrence for me. Even when I had a night off I stayed up until breakfast and slept through the day. I know I\u0027m backward - just ask my mother.\\n\\n But I\u0027d found that keeping to a schedule made my schedule easier to keep. Most people who worked third shift attempted to live like real folks when they weren\u0027t working. This, in my opinion, was what led to them being too tired to function for most of their life.\\n\\n At any rate, I was exhausted at 4:00 a.m. and that just wasn\u0027t like me. Which was my only excuse for not noticing right away that I wasn\u0027t alone when I stepped into my apartment.\\n\\n I unloaded the rifle as I walked down the hall and into my bedroom. Call me paranoid, but a loaded gun in the house is a very bad idea.\\n\\n Replacing the weapon in the safe, I hung the bandolier alongside it and locked the door. I drew the totem over my head and laid it on the dresser. I\u0027d learned my lesson about wearing the thing to bed. It had taken all day for the red marks to fade.\\n\\n The overhead light hit the wolf\u0027s face and reminded me of something I\u0027d been meaning to do. Quickly I rooted around in my nightstand until I found a magnifying glass attached to an old key chain. I checked the markings on the totem. Like Cadotte had promised, they were there. But did they mean what he said? I still couldn\u0027t buy it.\\n\\n As I unbuttoned my uniform blouse, I realized I hadn\u0027t removed my gun belt and pistol. Leaving my shirt hanging open, I retraced my steps and performed my usual ritual with the Magnum. I wasn\u0027t going to lock all my guns in the safe. When I turned away from the refrigerator, I saw him.\\n\\n The sliding glass doors were open and a pre-dawn breeze fluttered the drapes. Had they been like that when I\u0027d come in? Surely I would have noticed.\\n\\n A man stood in the opening. With no light from outside, no light from within, I could barely discern his outline from the ebony sky. But I could hear him breathing. I reached for my gun and he rushed me.\\n\\n I\u0027d learned to fight as a kid, which meant I\u0027d learned to fight dirty. While rolling around in the dirt with little boys, a little girl quickly learns she\u0027d better get mean or she\u0027d get hurt.\\n\\n I\u0027d refined my street skills at the academy, where we\u0027d learned hand-to-hand combat - the kind of fighting that usually went down in bars.\\n\\n Except when I had to fight drunks, they were slower and stupider than me. My intruder was none of the above.\\n\\n On my initial strike to the face, he grabbed my wrist, twisted me around. I kicked backward, going for his knee. He did a fancy sidestep, twirled me like a dancer, and kissed me on the mouth.\\n\\n The first taste and I knew. Cadotte. Who else?\\n\\n My racing pulse slowed as he deepened the kiss. Had he been here all along, waiting for me to return?\\n\\n Or had he climbed up the building again and slid inside?\\n\\n I yanked my lips away. \"What in hell are you doing here?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer. I couldn\u0027t see his face. Unnerved, I struggled to get free. He only pulled me tighter against him, where I discovered he was very glad I was home.\\n\\n Though my body shouted for me to take him to the ground and climb on top, my heart still pounded with an excess of adrenaline, and my emotions were too tangled for me to be anything but angry.\\n\\n \"Let me go.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" He nuzzled my neck, scraped his teeth along a throbbing vein, licked my collarbone -\\n\\n I stiffened, remembering the dream. \"Right now, Ca-dotte!\"\\n\\n His laugh rubbed his chest against mine. My shirt was still open, my bra a mere wisp of lace. I bit my lip to keep from moaning out loud at the friction. How could I be angry, aroused, and frightened all at the same time?\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t make me hurt you.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you go ahead and try?\" he whispered.\\n\\n Now how could I resist an offer like that?\\n\\n Before he could think, I brought my knee up hard and fast. He twisted quicker than a cat, and all I hit was his thigh.\\n\\n \"Ah, ah, ah. If you did that, there\u0027d be no fun later.\"\\n\\n I shoved him away and he let me. For a tall, lanky geek with glasses, he had more muscle mass than I would have figured. But since I\u0027d seen him naked, I should have known better.\\n\\n I tried a flat-handed shot to his chest. He blocked that and did some fancy Oriental jump-kick that I was barely able to deflect.\\n\\n \"What the hell was that? Kung fu?\"\\n\\n \"Tai chi. It\u0027s very good for you.\"\\n\\n \"I bet.\"\\n\\n He became less and less the geeky egghead with every passing moment. So the professor knew martial arts? Time to get serious.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t see much beyond a shadow in the starless darkness that filled my apartment. But I caught no glint of glass on his face, so punched him in the nose.\\n\\n Or at least I tried to. He grabbed my fist inches from his nostrils. How in hell did he do that?\\n\\n \"Say uncle,\" he murmured.\\n\\n \"Bite me.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d never been very good at giving in.\\n\\n \"Jessie, Jessie. You aren\u0027t going to win.\"\\n\\n Why it annoyed me so much that he was besting me in a physical fight, I have no idea. He was a guy.\\n\\n They were stronger. It was a medical fact, which had always pissed me off.\\n\\n Maybe part of the reason I didn\u0027t want to give up and say uncle was because his macho-man muscling me around was the most arousing foreplay I\u0027d ever experienced. So I hooked my ankle around his and took him down to the floor. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-20.html","bookId":2088,"book":{"id":2088,"title":"Night Creature: Blue Moon (Nightcreature #1)","description":"Storyline: Blue Moon(Night Creature series book 1) \\n Miniwa, Wisconsin is under siege, but not by the usual summer tourists.
