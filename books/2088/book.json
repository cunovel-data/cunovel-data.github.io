The area\u0027s normally shy wolf population has begun stalking human prey, and their victims have been disappearing...or worse. Something is happening in the woods. Something brutal and primitive... Officer Jessie McQuade has seen plenty in her years on the force-but nothing as intriguing as the gorgeous, naked man she encounters while tracking a rogue wolf. Professor Will Cadotte is a Native American activist. He\u0027s also the only man capable of distracting Jessie from her work. And for a cop, distraction-no matter how pleasurable-can be deadly.

Will\u0027s dark, penetrating eyes see into a part of Jessie\u0027s soul she never knew existed. It\u0027s exhilarating...and terrifying. Now, as a town\u0027s deepest secrets come to light, no one is safe: not friends, lovers, or strangers. And as Jessie follows a bloody trail to the shocking truth, she\u0027ll have to decide who she can trust when the moon is full...\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1.jpg","author":"Lori Handeland","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
