{"id":64270,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"\"Dude I found ain\u0027t about to testify,\" he said. \"So it don\u0027t matter how tainted he gets.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the idea.\"\\n\\n \"Tainted,\" he repeated, savoring the word. \"Only thing, I supposed to work for Elaine today. Mindin\u0027 the shop while she checks out this Salvation Army store somebody told her about.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll cover for you.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Lotta stuff you got to know, Bo. How to write up sales, how to make out the charge slips, how to bargain with the customers. It ain\u0027t somethin\u0027 you can do just walkin\u0027 in off the street.\"\\n\\n I swung at him and he grinned and dodged the blow. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you?\" he said. \"You got to work to establish the jab.\" And he snatched up the photographs and headed for the door.\\n\\n The photos had been taken by a third-year student at Western Reserve, in Cleveland. I\u0027d started out with a name and phone number from Wally Donn, but the guy I reached was swamped with work and didn\u0027t know when he could get to it. He gave me two other numbers, and when each one led me no further than an answering machine I looked in my book and called a fellow I knew in Massillon, Ohio. Massillon\u0027s not exactly next door to Cleveland, but I didn\u0027t know anybody closer.\\n\\n I\u0027d met Tom Havlicek six or seven years ago when a man I\u0027d locked up once killed an old friend of Elaine\u0027s, along with her husband and children. Havlicek was the cop in charge, a police lieutenant who liked his work and was good at it. We\u0027d hit it off and stayed in touch. I\u0027d managed to deflect his periodic invitations to come out to Ohio and hunt deer, but I\u0027d seen him twice in New York. He came alone the first time, to attend a police products trade show at the Javits Center, and I met him for lunch and showed him a little of the city. He liked what he saw enough to bring his wife a year or so later, and Elaine and I took them to dinner and arranged theater tickets. We joined them for the revival of Carousel at Lincoln Center, but they were on their own for Cats. Friendship, Elaine explained, only goes so far.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t take long to determine, through a contact in the Cleveland Metropolitan PD, that William Havemeyer had skated thus far through life without getting into trouble. \"He hasn\u0027t got a yellow sheet,\" he reported. \"Which means he hasn\u0027t been arrested. Not in Cuyahoga County, at any rate. Not under that name.\"\\n\\n I thanked him and got the name and phone number of his Cleveland contact.\\n\\n \"Now, since they never arrested him,\" he went on, \"they sure don\u0027t have a photo of him, and Garvin\"-his friend on the CMPD-\"gave me a number of a guy he knows who retired recently, but it turns out he\u0027s in Florida for the season. So I thought of my sister\u0027s boy.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a police officer?\"\\n\\n \"A college student. He\u0027ll be a lawyer when he\u0027s through. Just what the world needs more of.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t have too many lawyers,\" I said.\\n\\n \"That seems to be the Good Lord\u0027s view of the matter, the way he keeps making more of them. Won\u0027t be long before they\u0027ve got nobody left to sue but each other. He\u0027s a bright young man, never mind who his uncle is, and photography\u0027s his hobby.\"\\n\\n \"How is he at lurking?\"\\n\\n \"Lurking? Oh, to get the photo. I\u0027d say he\u0027s a devious cuss. Serve him in good stead in his chosen profession. Should I call him?\" I said he should. \"And when are we going to shoot some deer, will you tell me that?\"\\n\\n \"Probably never.\"\\n\\n \"Never make a hunter out of you, will we? You know what? Why don\u0027t you come out here after the season\u0027s over and we\u0027ll just take a walk in the woods, which is the best part of hunting anyway. No guns to carry, and no risk of being mistaken for a twelve-point buck by somebody who had his breakfast out of a flask. Of course you don\u0027t get to bring home any venison that way.\"\\n\\n \"Which spares you from having to pretend to enjoy it.\"\\n\\n \"Not your favorite meal, eh? Nor mine either, truth be known, but there\u0027s something about going out and getting it that satisfies a man.\"\\n\\n I called him from Elaine\u0027s shop to tell him the photos had arrived and his nephew had done a good job.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad to hear that,\" he said, \"but I\u0027m not surprised. He always took good pictures, even as a little kid. I spoke to him just last night, and I\u0027ll tell you what pleases me is how much fun he got out of doing the work. We could make a good police officer out of that boy.\"\\n\\n \"I bet your sister would love to hear that.\"\\n\\n \"Her and my brother-in-law both, and I guess I see their point. No question but that lawyers get richer than cops. Who ever said the world\u0027s a fair place?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, \"but I swear it wasn\u0027t me.\"\\n\\n I spent a few hours minding the shop, and it\u0027s a good thing I don\u0027t have to do that too often. Someone-I think it was Pascal-wrote something to the effect that all of man\u0027s problems stem from his inability to sit alone in a room. I\u0027m generally pretty good at sitting alone in a room, with or without the TV on, but that day I found it a trial. For one thing, I wanted to be out on the streets doing something. For another, people kept interrupting me, and to no purpose. They would call up, ask for Elaine, want to know when she would be coming back, and ring off without leaving a name. Or they would come to the door, stick their heads in, register a certain amount of dismay at seeing me instead of the lady of the house, and go somewhere else.\\n\\n A couple of people did come in and browse, but I didn\u0027t have to talk price with them, or make out charge card slips, because none of them tried to buy anything. One inquired about the price of several paintings-all the prices were clearly marked-and said that she would be back. That means about as much as saying \"I\u0027ll call you\" to a woman after the two of you have seen a movie together. \"People who keep shops,\" Elaine had told me, \"are more realistic than girls on dates. We know you won\u0027t be back.\"\\n\\n I had time to read the papers. Marty McGraw\u0027s column did indeed include Will\u0027s latest letter. Without naming names, the anonymous author made it clear that the three men on his list were just a starting point. Many more of us were candidates for his next list, unless we saw the light and mended our ways. The letter struck me as tired and unconvincing. I had the feeling Will #2 didn\u0027t even believe it himself.\\n\\n TJ breezed in somewhere around the middle of the afternoon. He was wearing baggy jeans, with a down vest in hunter orange over his camo jacket. He was dressed for success, if your line of work happens to be street crime.\\n\\n \"Got to change,\" he said, slipping past me to the back room. He came back wearing khakis and a button-down shirt. \"Don\u0027t want to scare the customers off,\" he said, \"but if I went downtown like this, I\u0027da scared the dude off.\"\\n\\n \"You found him?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"Says it\u0027s the man he saw.\"\\n\\n \"How sure is he?\"\\n\\n \"Sure enough to swear to it, \u0027cept he ain\u0027t about to swear to nothin\u0027. Told him he wouldn\u0027t have to. That straight?\"\\n\\n \"Probably. Can you take over now until Elaine gets back?\"\\n\\n \"No problem. Where you goin\u0027, Owen?\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you guess?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t guess,\" he said. \"I detect. Where I detect you\u0027s goin\u0027 is Cleveland.\"\\n\\n I told him he was a good detective.\\n\\n I\u0027d already called from the shop to book the flight, and I walked over to Phyllis Bingham\u0027s office to pick up the ticket, then back to the apartment to pack a bag with a clean shirt and a change of socks and underwear. I didn\u0027t know how long this was going to take, but I figured to be away overnight no matter what.\\n\\n Phyllis had me flying Continental out of Newark. I beat the rush hour traffic to the airport, and by the time we were on the ground in Cleveland most of the commuters were sitting down to dinner. There was a small group of people with hand-lettered cardboard signs waiting at the security gate, and one of the signs had my name on it. The kid holding it was tall and rangy, with close-cropped reddish-blond hair and a narrow face.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Matthew Scudder,\" I said, \"and you must be Jason Griffin. Your Uncle Tom said he\u0027d try to reach you, and that you\u0027d come if you had the time free.\"\\n\\n He grinned. \"He told me I\u0027d better have the time free. \u0027Meet his plane and drive him out to Lakewood, and anywhere else he wants to go.\u0027 Is that where you want to go first? This man\u0027s house in Lakewood?\"\\n\\n I said it was, and we went to his car, a Japanese import a couple of years old. It sparkled, and I guessed that he\u0027d taken it through a car wash on his way to the airport.\\n\\n On the way, I asked him what he knew about the case. \"Nothing,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Tom didn\u0027t tell you anything?\"\\n\\n \"My uncle\u0027s a need-to-know kind of guy,\" he said. \"He gave me a name and an address and told me to go take the guy\u0027s picture without being obvious about it. I told him I might have to buy a telephoto lens.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll reimburse you.\"\\n\\n He grinned. \" \u0027Borrow one,\u0027 he said. So that\u0027s what I did. I parked across the street from Mr. Havemeyer\u0027s house and waited for him to come home. When he did get home he drove straight into the garage. It\u0027s an attached garage, which is unusual in that neighborhood. They\u0027re mostly older homes there, but his is newer than the others and it\u0027s got a carport-type garage. So he went on in without giving me a look at him, let alone a chance to zoom in and take his picture.\"\\n\\n \"What did you do, wait for him to come out again?\"\\n\\n \"No, because he\u0027d probably leave the same way, right? Uncle Tom hadn\u0027t told me how to cope with this sort of situation. As a matter of fact the only advice he gave me-well, can you guess what it was?\"\\n\\n \"Bring a milk bottle.\"\\n\\n \"He said a wide-mouthed jar. Same difference. I asked him what I was supposed to do with it, and he said after I sat there for a couple of hours the answer would come to me. At which point I figured out what the jar was for. You\u0027ll never guess what he told me next.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027When the jar fills up, empty it in the gutter.\u0027 I said, like, pour it out in the gutter? No one\u0027ll see you, he said, and it\u0027ll wash away. I told him thanks for the wise counsel, but I probably would have figured out how to empty the jar on my own. He said after all the rookies he\u0027s trained over the years he\u0027s learned to leave nothing to chance.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a wise man,\" I said. \"But I\u0027m on your side. I have a feeling you\u0027d have worked out the part about emptying the jar all by yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, but on the other hand I have to admit I never would have thought to bring the jar in the first place. You don\u0027t ever see them peeing in bottles in the movies.\"\\n\\n I agreed that you didn\u0027t. \"How\u0027d you get the pictures?\"\\n\\n \"There was this kid shooting baskets all by himself a few doors down the street. I told him I\u0027d give him five bucks if he could ring the doorbell and get the man inside to come outside of his house. He went and rang it and ran off, and Mr. Havemeyer opened the door a crack and then shut it again. I snapped a picture but it wasn\u0027t one of the ones I sent you because you couldn\u0027t see anything. Anyway, I told the kid that wasn\u0027t good enough, but if he did it again and got the guy to come out I\u0027d pay him the five and another five on top of it.\"\\n\\n \"And it worked.\"\\n\\n \"He made it work. He went into his own house and got a paper bag about so big and filled it with crumpled newspaper. Then he put it on the stoop and set it on fire, and then he rang the bell again and pounded on the door and ran like a thief. Mr. Havemeyer opened the door a crack again, and then he rushed outside and started stomping and kicking at the burning bag.\" He grinned. \"It took me a minute to get focused because I was laughing too hard to hold the camera steady. It was pretty funny.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-38.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \\n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
