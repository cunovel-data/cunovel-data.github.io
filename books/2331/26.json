I don\u0027t think he would have used his real name.\"\n \"I don\u0027t blame him.\"\n \"But he may have kept the initials.\"\n \"Well, let\u0027s see.\" She tapped away at the keys, periodically rolling her eyes while she waited for the machine to respond. \"Every computer\u0027s faster than the last one,\" she said, \"and they\u0027re never fast enough. You get so you want it instantaneous. More than that, you want it to give you data before you can even think to ask for it.\"\n \"Same with people.\"\n \"Huh? Oh, right.\" She giggled. \"At least computers keep improving. Do you see what I\u0027m doing? I\u0027m starting with USAir, and I\u0027m asking if there\u0027s a Wishniak on Flight 1103 on the fifth, and there\u0027s not, and now I\u0027ll ask about Flight 179 the same day… No. Okay, the other date\u0027s the sixth, right? So we\u0027ll try 1103… Nothing, and now we\u0027ll try 179. Is that the right number, 179? It is, so we\u0027ll try it. Nope.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think he would have used his real name.\"\n \"I know, but I wanted to rule it out because with the name I could access the records. With just the initials I can\u0027t.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"Let me try Midwest Express,\" she said. She did, and United as well, and wound up shaking her head.\n \"There\u0027s another name you could try,\" I said. \"He had a brother who anglicized the family name, and Arnold\u0027s borrowed the name in the past.\"\n I told her the name and she repeated it and frowned. \"Spell it?\" I spelled it and she hit keys. \"It\u0027s a familiar name to me,\" she mused. \"Where did I hear it recently?\"\n \"No idea,\" I said. \"Of course there\u0027s the ballplayer, Dave Winfield.\"\n She shook her head. \"Since the strike,\" she said, \"I don\u0027t pay any attention. Flight 1103, on the fifth. No luck there. Flight 179, also on the fifth…\"\n Nothing on any of the flights in question.\n \"There\u0027s still a good chance he used the initials,\" I said. \"But you can\u0027t access it that way. Suppose you just pull up the passenger manifests for each of those flights. Can you do that?\"\n \"I can\u0027t.\"\n \"Who can?\"\n \"Some computer genius, probably. Or somebody at the airline who\u0027s got the access codes.\" She frowned. \"This is important, huh?\"\n \"Kind of.\"\n She picked up a phone, flipped through a Rolodex, dialed a number. She said, \"Hi, this is Phyllis at JMC. Who\u0027s this? Judy? Judy, I\u0027ve got this very good customer of mine who happens to be a detective. He\u0027s on this case that involves a noncustodial parent… Right, you hear about stuff like this all the time. I know, it\u0027s amazing. They don\u0027t pay child support and then they come and kidnap the kids.\"\n She explained what I needed to know. \"He wasn\u0027t on any of those flights under his own name,\" she said, \"but the detective thinks he may have kept the initials. No, I understand it\u0027s confidential, Judy. You would have to have a court order. Right.\" She made a face, then forced a smile. \"Look, could you do this much? Without telling me the name, could you see if there\u0027s a male passenger on one of those flights with the initials AW? Yes, Philadelphia to Omaha.\"\n She covered the mouthpiece. \"She\u0027s not supposed to do this,\" she said, \"but she\u0027ll bend a little. My guess, she\u0027s divorced and not on the best of terms with her ex.\" She uncovered the mouthpiece. \"Hi, Judy. Rats. None at all, huh?\"\n \"He probably paid cash,\" I said.\n She was quick. \"Judy,\" she said, \"he probably made up a name, so he probably paid cash. If you could… uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right, I understand.\"\n She covered the mouthpiece again. \"She can\u0027t do it.\"\n \"Can\u0027t or won\u0027t?\"\n \"Won\u0027t. It\u0027s against the rules, she\u0027d get in trouble, blah blah blah.\"\n TJ said, \"Could you do it? If you had the access codes?\"\n \"But I don\u0027t.\"\n \"But she does.\"\n She considered, shrugged, and uncovered the mouthpiece. \"Judy,\" she said, \"last thing I want is for you to get in trouble. For curiosity, though, tell me something. Is that information there to be pulled up? Like whether a ticket was purchased cash or charge? I mean, suppose a customer comes in and pays me cash, and… Uh-huh. I see. So anybody could access it. I mean, I could get it myself if I had the access codes, is that right?\" She grabbed up a pen, jotted down a phrase. \"Judy,\" she said, \"you\u0027re a doll. Thanks.\" She broke the connection, grinned fiercely, and held up a clenched fist in triumph. \"Yes!\"\n We still had a ways to go. What she managed to produce, after a lot of head-scratching and keytapping, was a printout of passenger manifests for flights on the three airlines in question from Philadelphia to Omaha and as many return flights two days later. An asterisk next to a name indicated a non-credit card sale.\n \"Cash or check,\" she explained. \"There\u0027s no distinction in the data bank. Also, these are just the cash and check sales made by the airline. Sales through travel agents are just listed that way, with no indication as to how payment was made. That\u0027s not what she told me, but if there\u0027s a way to separate it out, I can\u0027t figure it out.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right.\"\n \"It is? Because do you see the names coded with a C? These are all customers who bought their ticket through another airline, probably because their trip originated with another flight segment on the issuing carrier. For all I know they paid for their ticket with Green Stamps.\"\n \"I think the manifests are all I need.\"\n \"You do?\"\n \"If the same name turns up going and coming back, that\u0027s more significant than how he paid for the ticket.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t even think of that. Let\u0027s check.\"\n I gathered up the sheets of paper. \"I\u0027ve taken up enough of your time,\" I said. \"The hard part\u0027s done. And, speaking of your time, I want to pay for it.\"\n \"Oh, come on,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t have to do that.\"\n I tucked the money into her hand. \"The client can afford it,\" I said.\n \"Well…\" She closed her fingers around the bills. \"Actually, that was fun. Not as much fun as booking you and your wife on a South Seas cruise, though. Be sure and call me when you\u0027re ready to go someplace wonderful.\"\n \"I will.\"\n \"Or even Omaha,\" she said.\n \"The client can afford it,\u0027 \" TJ said. \"Thought we didn\u0027t have a client.\"\n \"We don\u0027t.\"\n \" \u0027Social engineering.\u0027 What you did is you used a computer. Only thing, it was somebody else\u0027s computer. And somebody else\u0027s fingers on the keys.\"\n \"I suppose that\u0027s one way to put it.\"\n \"Let\u0027s see the lists,\" he said. \"See how many repeats we got.\"\n \"Mr. A. Johnson,\" I said. \"Flew Midwest Express from Philadelphia to Omaha on the fifth, changing planes in Milwaukee. He flew back to Philadelphia on the morning of the seventh. Paid by cash or check. My guess is cash.\"\n \"You think it\u0027s him.\"\n \"I do.\"\n \"Whole lot of folks named Johnson. Right up there with Smith and Jones.\"\n \"Thafs true.\"\n \" \u0027Cordin\u0027 to Phyllis, you got to show ID to get on a plane.\"\n \"They\u0027ve tightened up all their security measures.\"\n \"Case you a terrorist,\" he said, \"they want to make sure it\u0027s really you. They probably do the same when you buy the ticket, if you payin\u0027 cash. Ask for ID.\"\n I nodded. \"Same with a check, but then they always want proof of identity for a check. Of course, it\u0027s not that hard to get ID.\"\n \"Store right on the Deuce, print up all kinds of shit. Student ID, Sheriff cards. Wouldn\u0027t make much of an impression on a cop, but you gonna look too hard at it if you\u0027re behind the counter at the airlines?\"\n \"Especially if the customer\u0027s a prosperous-looking middle-aged white man in a Brooks Brothers suit.\"\n \"The right front gets you through,\" he agreed.\n \"And the ID may have been legitimate,\" I said. \"Maybe he had a client named Johnson, maybe he hung on to a driver\u0027s license for some poor bastard who wouldn\u0027t need it while he was locked up in Green Haven.\"\n He scratched his head. \"We got a name of a dude flew to Omaha one day and back a couple days later. We got anything more than that?\"\n \"Not yet,\" I said.\n \"I\u0027m glad you brought him in,\" Joe Durkin said. \"This is the very mope we\u0027ve been looking high and low for. I\u0027ll ask him a few questions soon as I remember where I put my rubber hose.\"\n \"Bet I know where it\u0027s at,\" TJ said. \"You want, I help you look for it.\"\n Durkin grinned and gave him a poke in the arm. \"What are you doing with my friend here?\" he demanded. \"Why aren\u0027t you out on the street selling crack and mugging people?\"\n \"My day off.\"\n \"And here I thought you guys were dedicated. Seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year, soothing the emotional pain of the public. Turns out you coast just like everybody else.\"\n \"Hell yes,\" TJ said. \"I didn\u0027t want to do nothin\u0027 but work all the time, I be joinin\u0027 the po-leese.\"\n \"Say that again for me, will you? Po-leese.\"\n \"Po-leese.\"\n \"Jesus, I love it when you talk dirty. Matt, I don\u0027t know what gives me the idea, but somehow I think you\u0027re here for a reason.\"\n We were in the squad room at Midtown North, on West Fifty-fourth Street. I took a chair and explained what I wanted while TJ went over to the board and thumbed through a sheaf of Wanted flyers.\n \"When you find one with your picture on it,\" Joe advised him, \"bring it over and I\u0027ll get you to autograph it for me. Matt, let me see if I\u0027ve got this straight. You want me to call the Omaha police and ask them to check hotel records for some zip named Johnson.\"\n \"I\u0027d appreciate it,\" I said.\n \"You\u0027d appreciate it. In a tangible way, do you suppose?\"\n \"Tangible. Yes, I suppose I-\"\n \"I like that word,\" he said. \"Tangible. It means you can touch it. You reach out and it\u0027s there. Which gives rise to a question. Why don\u0027t you reach out and touch someone?\"\n \"Pardon me?\"\n \"You know the hotel, right? The Hilton?\"\n \"That\u0027s the place to start. I\u0027m not positive that\u0027s where he stayed, but-\"\n \"But you\u0027d start there. Why didn\u0027t you? Use their eight hundred number and the call\u0027s free. Can\u0027t beat that for a bargain.\"\n \"I called,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t get anywhere.\"\n \"You identify yourself as a police officer?\"\n \"That\u0027s illegal.\" He gave me a look. \"I may have given that impression,\" I admitted. \"It didn\u0027t do me any good.\"\n \"Since when did you become incapable of calling a hotel and conning a little information out of a desk clerk?\" He looked at the slip of paper in front of him. \"Omaha,\" he said. \"What the hell ever happened in Omaha?\" He looked at me. \"Jesus Christ,\" he said.\n \"Not Him personally,\" TJ put in, \"but this dude who said he was real tight with Him.\"\n \"The abortion guy. What was his name?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-26.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
