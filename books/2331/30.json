{"id":64262,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"\"Where would you find a list like that?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d have to compile it, which is what someone very likely did once the autopsy results confirmed cyanide as the cause of Adrian\u0027s death. We can be sure his own name didn\u0027t show up on the list, or we\u0027d have read headlines about it. He\u0027d have thought of that. If he needed to show ID in order to buy cyanide, he\u0027d have made sure it was in another name.\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027d have felt safe enough using Allen Johnson again.\"\\n\\n \"Unless he\u0027d already destroyed it, yes. I don\u0027t imagine he\u0027d be overly concerned about someone putting the two Johnsons together, one from a hotel in Omaha and the other from a poison-control ledger in New York.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n He excused himself, and came back saying how lucky he was-there had been no one lurking in the bathroom with a garrote.\\n\\n \"Though I wouldn\u0027t have made his list,\" he said, \"if only because he already had a criminal lawyer on it. Hell of an eclectic list he came up with, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\\n\\n \"Very much so.\"\\n\\n \"A sexual psychopath, a Mafia boss, a right-to-lifer, and a black rabble-rouser. All along everybody\u0027s been trying to find the common denominator. You\u0027d think it would become apparent when you know who did it, but it\u0027s still hard to spot.\"\\n\\n \"He only really needed a reason for the first one,\" I said, \"and he had that. There he was, brooding over his role in Richie Vollmer\u0027s release, and McGraw\u0027s column stirred him to action. At that point he very likely intended just to commit one single act of murder.\"\\n\\n \"And then what happened?\"\\n\\n \"My guess is he found out he liked it.\"\\n\\n \"Got a thrill out of it, you mean? Middle-aged lawyer all of a sudden finds out he\u0027s got the soul of a psychopath?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t imagine he suddenly blossomed as a thrill killer. But I think he found it satisfying.\"\\n\\n \"Satisfying.\"\\n\\n \"I think so, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Killing people who had it coming, making the world a better place for it. That what you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose it could be satisfying,\" he said. \"Especially for a man who\u0027s under a death sentence himself. \u0027What can I do to improve the world before I leave it? Well, I can take that son of a bitch off the boards. There, I may not live forever, but at least I outlived you, you bastard.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the idea. The first one\u0027s Richie. The second one\u0027s because he wants to do it again, so he picks someone else the law can\u0027t lay a finger on. He\u0027s had some exposure to Patsy Salerno, enough to form a strong negative opinion of the man.\"\\n\\n \"And after that?\"\\n\\n \"I would think the motives thinned out as he went along. Numbers three and four were similarly untouchable. Roswell Berry had clearly incited acts that led to the deaths of physicians performing abortions, and the law couldn\u0027t lay a glove on him. I don\u0027t suppose there was a personal element in it, unless Adrian knew one of the doctors or had strong feelings on the subject of abortion rights.\"\\n\\n \"His sister,\" Ray said suddenly.\\n\\n \"His sister? I didn\u0027t think he had any brothers and sisters.\"\\n\\n \"He told me about her once,\" he said. \"A long time ago, back when he used to put away a lot more than one drink a day. He liked those single-malt scotches even then, though I couldn\u0027t tell you the brand.\" He grinned suddenly. \"I can remember the taste, though. Isn\u0027t that a surprise? We were both about half lit and he told me about his sister. She was two or three years older than Adrian. She was away at college when she died, and Adrian was in his last year of high school.\"\\n\\n I thought I knew the answer, but I asked the question anyway. \"What did she die of?\"\\n\\n \"Blood poisoning,\" he said. \"One of those infections that goes through you like wildfire. That was all they told him at the time. It was years later before he got the whole story from his mother. She wouldn\u0027t tell him until after his father died, and of course you can figure it out now.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Septicemia following a back-street abortion. Did it transform Adrian into a crusader for abortion rights? Not that you\u0027d notice. Maybe he wrote out a check once in a while, or voted for or against a candidate because of his stand on the issue, but he didn\u0027t sign a lot of petitions and open letters, and I never saw him out on Fifth Avenue picketing St. Patrick\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"But when it came time to draw up a little list-\" He nodded. \"Sure. Why not? \u0027This one\u0027s for you, Sis.\u0027 \" He stifled a yawn. \"Funny,\" he said. \"I never got tired when I drank. It was always the easiest thing in the world to talk the night away.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go home and let you get some sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Sit down,\" he said. \"We\u0027re not through yet. Anyway, all we need is a little more coffee.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t even begin to have what you could call proof,\" Ray Gruliow said. \"It\u0027s far too little for an indictment, let alone a conviction.\"\\n\\n \"I realize that.\"\\n\\n \"All of which is moot, admittedly, given that the defendant is no longer among the living.\" He settled back in his seat. \"And you weren\u0027t trying to sell it to a jury anyway, were you? I\u0027m the guy you want to buy it.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And I suppose I\u0027m sold.\"\\n\\n \"You could turn up enough evidence,\" I said, \"once you had a ton of guys with badges looking for it. Print up a few dozen photos of Adrian and show them to people at airports and hotels and you\u0027ll find someone who remembers him. Pull NYNEX\u0027s records of local calls made from his home and office phones. He probably made most of his calls from pay phones, but there may be some calls that tie in with some of Will\u0027s activities. Go through his apartment and his office with the kind of detailed search I didn\u0027t have the time or authority for and who knows what kind of hard evidence you\u0027ll find.\"\\n\\n \"So what\u0027s the question?\"\\n\\n \"The question is what do I do with this sleeping dog.\"\\n\\n \"Traditionally, you\u0027re supposed to let them lie.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Adrian\u0027s dead, and Will\u0027s officially retired. He said so in his last letter. What did he do, drop that in the mail on his way out of the courtroom?\"\\n\\n \"It looks like it.\"\\n\\n \"Wrote the letter, put a stamp on it, carried it around with him. Then his trial\u0027s wrapped up, with his client conveniently copping a plea, and it\u0027s time to throw in the towel. So he mails the letter and goes home and plays out the last scene.\"\\n\\n \"Calls me first,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Calls you first and says he wishes he had more time. Then goes out and makes sure his bodyguard\u0027s watching when he takes his last drink and kisses the carpet. That business about the wrong zip code on the letter to the News. You think that was to delay the letter?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t think so. You couldn\u0027t know it would work. With the volume of mail the paper gets, there\u0027s ample opportunity for some clerk somewhere along the way to spot the letter and redirect it into the right slot. I just think he got the zip wrong.\"\\n\\n \"I guess he had things on his mind.\" He turned to me, his eyes probing mine. \"You know what I think? I think you have to take what you\u0027ve got and hand it to the cops.\"\\n\\n \"What makes you say that?\"\\n\\n \"Because otherwise they\u0027ll be running down false trails and barking up wrong trees for months on end. How many men do you suppose they\u0027ve got assigned to Will?\"\\n\\n \"No idea.\"\\n\\n \"A substantial number, though.\"\\n\\n \"Obviously.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you could let them waste their time,\" he said, \"on the assumption that it would keep them from making trouble for somebody else, but I don\u0027t even know if that\u0027s true. Who knows how many lives they\u0027re going to turn inside out looking for Will?\" He yawned. \"But there\u0027s a more basic consideration. Who\u0027s your client? How do you best serve his interests?\"\\n\\n \"The only client I\u0027ve had has been Adrian.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you haven\u0027t resigned and he hasn\u0027t fired you. I\u0027d say he\u0027s still your client.\"\\n\\n \"According to that line of reasoning, I ought to let it lie.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"You\u0027re missing something, Matt. Why did Adrian hire you?\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t take any payment for advising him on how to go about protecting himself. I suppose this was his way of paying me for my time.\"\\n\\n \"What did he engage you to do?\"\\n\\n \"To investigate the whole case. I told him I couldn\u0027t be expected to accomplish much.\" I remembered something. \"He alluded to my tendency to stay with a case. Stubbornness, you could call it.\"\\n\\n \"You could indeed. Don\u0027t you see? He wanted you to solve it. He didn\u0027t want to leave loose ends. He wanted to baffle everybody, he wanted the audience holding its breath when the curtain went down. But then, after a decent interval, he wants a chance to come out and take a bow. And that\u0027s where you come in.\"\\n\\n I thought about it. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Why not just leave a letter to be delivered a certain amount of time after his death? As far as that goes, let\u0027s remember that we\u0027re talking about a multiple murderer with delusions of grandeur. Do you really think you can read his mind?\"\\n\\n \"Throw all that out, then. The hell with what he wanted and what he didn\u0027t want. You\u0027re a detective. It\u0027s who you are and it\u0027s what you do. That\u0027s why you stayed with it and that\u0027s why you solved it.\"\\n\\n \"If I\u0027ve solved it.\"\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s why you\u0027ll sit down with your friend Durkin tomorrow and tell him what you\u0027ve got.\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s who I am and what I do.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. And I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re stuck with it.\"\\n\\n 16\\n\\n The phone rang the next morning while we were having breakfast. Elaine answered it, and it was TJ, checking to see if she wanted him to spell her at the shop. She talked with him, then said, \"Hang on,\" and passed me the phone.\\n\\n \"It ain\u0027t the peach pits,\" he said. \"You got to crack the pits, and there\u0027s this kernel inside.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Talkin\u0027 \u0027bout cyanide, Clyde. Like he put in the scotch bottle? I can\u0027t say if you could kill yourself eatin\u0027 peach kernels, but there was a dude did it with apricots. Didn\u0027t eat but fifteen or twenty of \u0027em, and that was enough.\"\\n\\n \"Apricot kernels, you mean.\"\\n\\n There was a pause, and I could picture his eyes rolling. \"If you could die from eatin\u0027 fifteen or twenty apricots, don\u0027t you think they\u0027d make \u0027em put a warnin\u0027 on the package? Dude cracked open the pits, ate the kernels, an\u0027 that was his last meal.\"\\n\\n \"And it was suicide?\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t find out for sure. Could be he was tryin\u0027 to cure cancer. There\u0027s this drug they make outta apricot kernels, and you\u0027ve got people swearin\u0027 it works and people swearin\u0027 it don\u0027t. Laetrile? Might be I ain\u0027t pronouncin\u0027 it right.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard of it.\"\\n\\n \"So this dude who ate the kernels, could be he was on a do-it-yourself Laetrile project. But we was wonderin\u0027 if you could kill yourself that\" way, eatin\u0027 peach pits, an\u0027 if fifteen or twenty\u0027s all it takes, I guess the answer\u0027s yes, at least with apricots. Assumin\u0027 you fool enough to try.\"\\n\\n \"Somehow I don\u0027t think Adrian got cyanide from apricot kernels.\"\\n\\n \"No, but that leaves a whole lot of other ways to get it. Turns out there\u0027s all kinds of industrial uses for that shit.\" He went on to tell me some of them. \"So his name might turn up on a list,\" he said, \"or Allen Johnson\u0027s might, but they might not. On account of there\u0027s so many different ways to get it.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-30.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \\n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
