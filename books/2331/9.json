{"id":64241,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"You know how he got the virus.\"\n \"Sharing needles, as I understand it.\"\n \"That\u0027s right. He wasn\u0027t gay.\"\n \"I gathered as much.\"\n \"Living in the Village and having AIDS, it\u0027d be natural to assume that he was. But he was straight. Very much so.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"I was sort of in love with him.\"\n \"I see.\"\n \"What do you do when you fall in love with somebody and he\u0027s HIV-positive?\" She didn\u0027t wait for an answer, which was just as well, because I didn\u0027t have one. \"Gay men have to face that all the time, don\u0027t they? I guess they practice safe sex, or else they just don\u0027t date across HIV lines. If they\u0027re virus-free they don\u0027t let themselves get involved with anybody who\u0027s not.\" She was silent for a moment. \"Or they just go ahead and take chances.\"\n \"Is that what you did?\"\n \"Oh no. Me? What makes you say that?\"\n \"Something in your voice.\"\n \"It\u0027s probably envy. Sometimes I wish I were the kind of person who can act on that kind of impulse. I never was, not even in the bad old days. I liked Byron a lot and I had this kind of yearning for him, but his status put each of us off-limits for the other. We had one conversation about it, how if things were different we\u0027d do something about it. But things weren\u0027t different, things were the way they were. So we stayed friends. Just friends, as the saying goes, but what\u0027s the word \u0027just\u0027 doing in there? Friendship\u0027s pretty rare, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I learned so much from him. He treasured each day. Do you think they\u0027ll get the man who killed him?\"\n \"It sounds likely,\" I said. \"He was killed in a public place with witnesses around. And that\u0027s the Sixth Precinct, it\u0027s not a high-crime area, so it won\u0027t get written off as drug-related. The odds are they\u0027ll have somebody in custody by the end of the week.\"\n \"They might think it\u0027s drug-related.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"He used to be a junkie. It\u0027ll be on his record, won\u0027t it?\"\n \"If he was ever arrested.\"\n \"A couple of times. He never had to go to prison, but he told me he\u0027d been arrested a few times.\"\n \"Then it\u0027d be on his record, yes.\"\n \"And there\u0027s drug dealing that goes on in that park. It\u0027s not swarming with dealers like Washington Square, but Byron told me how he would sit in the window and looked out at the street and watch people cop.\"\n After a moment I said, \"He didn\u0027t go back to using dope, did he, Ginnie?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Then they won\u0027t think the killing was drug-related, unless they figure it for a case of mistaken identity, and maybe that\u0027s what it was. It doesn\u0027t matter. Either way they\u0027ll handle it by the book and run down whatever leads they\u0027ve got. My guess is they\u0027ll find the shooter and close the case.\"\n \"I hope so. Matt? Why should it matter to me? It\u0027s not going to bring him back.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"And it\u0027s not like I\u0027ve got this thirst for revenge. I don\u0027t hate the man who killed Byron. For all I know he did him a favor. He was at peace, Matt. He treasured each day, but I already said that, didn\u0027t I?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"He was still able to get out of the house. He could still go to meetings. He had to use a cane, but he would walk the few blocks to Perry Street, and there was always somebody who would give him a seat. That was the other good thing about AIDS, he said. No worries about skin cancer, and you didn\u0027t have to get to Perry Street an hour early to get a good seat. He could joke about it, all of it. I guess it\u0027s bad when you can\u0027t.\"\n \"I guess so.\"\n \"There was a friend of mine at work. When he couldn\u0027t come to work anymore I used to visit him. Until I couldn\u0027t take it anymore. It destroyed his mind, but not all at once. He would go in and out of dementia. I couldn\u0027t bear to be around him. It\u0027s not as though I was deserting him, he had a lover who was taking care of him, and dozens of friends. I just knew him casually, from the office. Listen to me, will you? Always having to explain myself.\" She stopped to draw a breath. \"I found myself looking for signs of dementia with Byron. But he was spared that.\"\n I read the coverage in the newspapers, and I was watching New York One, the local news channel, when Melissa Mikawa did a stand-up in Jackson Square in front of the very bench where Byron Leopold was shot to death. The cameraman provided a shot of his apartment building directly across the street, and Mikawa pointed as the camera panned to indicate the killer\u0027s escape route.\n Then she went on to something else, and I hit the Mute button and answered the phone. It was Adrian, with a couple of new jokes and the wistful report that, once Will had you in his sights, everybody else wanted to draw a bead on you. \"The Fourth Estate is hot for me,\" he said. \"If I had the stomach for it, I could be on the tube eighteen hours a day and spend the rest of my time talking to print reporters. Of course everybody wants to marry a virgin.\"\n \"How\u0027s that?\"\n \"They want an exclusive. Remember what the fellow said after they tarred and feathered him and rode him out of town on a rail?\"\n \"Something about honor, wasn\u0027t it?\"\n \" \u0027But for the honor of it, I\u0027d have preferred to leave town in the usual manner.\u0027 I may not have it word for word, but since it\u0027s an apocryphal story, how could anybody have it word for word? It\u0027s nice to be wanted, but I\u0027m finding it easier and easier to say no. Except for McGraw.\"\n \"What did he want?\"\n \"What they all want. An interview.\"\n He said something else, but I didn\u0027t catch it. I was off chasing an errant thought, trying to run it down. I said, \"No private meetings.\"\n \"Come again?\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t see anyone,\" I said, \"without your bodyguards present in the room.\"\n \"Not even a fat old newspaperman, eh?\"\n \"Not even the cardinal.\"\n \"Really? There\u0027s something about the guy that inspires confidence. I guess it\u0027s the red hat, makes him look like one of the Guardian Angels.\" He laughed and I laughed with him, and he told me to relax. \"The cardinal hasn\u0027t called,\" he said, \"and Marty didn\u0027t want a meeting, just a phoner. Five minutes of my time, and could I please hand him something his and his alone that he could make a column out of. I don\u0027t think I gave him anything, but he can always spin a column out of thin air. He\u0027s done it often enough in the past.\"\n We told each other good-bye and I hung up the phone and turned off the TV without finding out what the silent figures were chattering about. I had an idea, and I sat there and let myself play with it. It seemed farfetched, and it struck me as something the police would have long since ruled out, but you never know. If nothing else, it gave me something to do.\n As it turned out, a few hours on the telephone put me right back at square one. You couldn\u0027t say it was pointless, in that I was now able to let go of a stray thought that had come my way, but neither could I get much feeling of accomplishment out of it.\n Meanwhile Marty McGraw did manage to conjure up a column out of what Adrian had given him, a ruminative piece on the pluses and minuses of celebrity status. Another columnist in the same paper started out musing on the fate of Byron Leopold, but after a paragraph or two he went on to something else, and so did I. I could hardly claim close ties with Byron, I hadn\u0027t even known his last name, and the apprehension of his murderer was the responsibility of the fellows at the Sixth Precinct. They could handle it just fine without any help from me.\n Except they didn\u0027t, not right away, and I found myself being drawn in for no good reason. On Thursday, two days after the murder, I realized in my wanderings that I was a five-minute walk from the murder scene. I went over there and sat on a park bench for half an hour. I got into a couple of conversations, then went over and exchanged a few words with the doorman at Byron\u0027s building.\n Saturday afternoon there was a memorial service for him at St. Luke\u0027s on Hudson Street. People who had known him during the years he was sober shared reminiscences. I listened as if for clues.\n Afterward I had a cup of coffee with Ginnie. \"It\u0027s funny,\" she said. \"I keep having the feeling that I ought to hire you.\"\n \"To find the guy who shot Byron? The cops can do a better job of that than I can.\"\n \"I know. The feeling persists all the same. You know what I think it is? I\u0027d be doing something for him, Matt. And there\u0027s nothing else I can do for him.\"\n Later that day I had a call from Adrian Whitfield. \"You know what?\" he said. \"I\u0027ve figured out how the son of a bitch is going to get me. He\u0027s fixing it so I die of boredom.\"\n \"You hear about people dying of boredom,\" I said, \"but you don\u0027t see it listed as \u0027cause of death\u0027 on a whole lot of autopsy reports.\"\n \"It\u0027s a cover-up, like the Catholics do with suicide. People who die of boredom can\u0027t be buried in hallowed ground. Did you ever know a fellow named Benedetto Nappi?\"\n \"I think I saw a couple of his paintings at the Frick.\"\n \"Not unless there\u0027s a side to the man that I don\u0027t know about. Benny the Suitcase is what they called him, although I couldn\u0027t tell you why. The story goes that he had a job starting Tony Furillo\u0027s car. He\u0027d warm up the engine, and then if there was no explosion that meant it was safe for Tony to go for a ride.\"\n \"Like a food taster.\"\n \"Exactly like a food taster. You turned the key in the ignition and when nothing happened you went back home and watched cartoons. Benny did this for a couple of months and then quit. Not because he couldn\u0027t take the pressure. I don\u0027t think he noticed any pressure. \u0027Nothing ever happens,\u0027 he complained. Of course if anything ever did happen you\u0027d have had to pick him up with a sponge, but all he knew was the boredom was too much for him.\"\n \"And you know how he feels.\"\n \"I do, and in point of fact I\u0027ve got less right to complain than Benny ever had. I could gripe about having to wear body armor during a heat wave, but the truth of the matter is that I go from an air-conditioned apartment to an air-conditioned limo to an air-conditioned office. It\u0027s hotter than hell on the street, but I don\u0027t get to spend enough time out there to matter.\"\n \"You\u0027re not missing a thing.\"\n \"I\u0027ll take your word for it. I don\u0027t know that Kevlar flatters my figure much, and it\u0027s not the last word in comfort, but it\u0027s not like a hair shirt. So here I am living my life and waiting for the bomb to go off, and when it doesn\u0027t I start feeling cheated. What about you? Are you getting anywhere at all?\"\n \"As a matter of fact,\" I said, \"I\u0027ve been thinking about sending you your money back.\"\n \"Why\u0027s that?\"\n \"Because I can\u0027t think of a good way to earn it. I\u0027ve put in some hours, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve learned anything I didn\u0027t already know, and I\u0027m certainly in no position to improve on the official investigation.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\n \"There\u0027s something else, isn\u0027t there?\"\n \"Well, there is,\" I said, and I told him about Byron Leopold.\n He said, \"He\u0027s what, a friend of a friend?\"\n \"Essentially, yes. I knew him, but just to say hello to.\"\n \"But not so closely that you can\u0027t sleep as long as his killer walks the streets.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-9.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
