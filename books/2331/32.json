{"id":64264,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\"I was wondering about that,\" I said. \"It seems to me it shouldn\u0027t be much of a trick to prove that the new letter was typed on a different machine.\"\\n\\n \"Well, sure,\" he said. \"If it was typed.\"\\n\\n \"If it wasn\u0027t,\" I said, \"he\u0027s got a funny kind of handwriting.\"\\n\\n \"I mean typed on a typewriter, which it wasn\u0027t, and neither were any of the earlier letters. They were done on a computer and printed on a laser printer.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t they identify the computer and the printer forensically?\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"With a typewriter the keys\u0027ll be worn differently, and this one\u0027ll be out of alignment, or the E and O\u0027s\u0027ll be filled in. Or the typeface is different. A typewriter\u0027s like a fingerprint, no two alike.\"\\n\\n \"And a computer?\"\\n\\n \"With a computer you can choose a different typeface every time, you can make the type larger or smaller by touching this key or that one. You see how the signature\u0027s in script? You get that by switching to a script font.\"\\n\\n \"So you can\u0027t tell if two letters came out of the same computer?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a hundred percent in the loop on this,\" he said, \"but there\u0027s a certain amount you can tell. With Will\u0027s letters, the ones from Will Number One, they think there was more than one printer involved.\"\\n\\n He went on to tell me more than I could take in, about ways in which you could compose a letter on one computer, copy it on a disk, and then print it out through another computer and printer. I didn\u0027t listen too closely, and eventually I held up a hand to stop him.\\n\\n \"Please,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sick to death of computers. I can\u0027t have a conversation with TJ without hearing how wonderful they are. I don\u0027t care about the typeface or the paper, or if he composed it on the East Side and printed it out on the West Side. I don\u0027t even care about the writing style. What\u0027s so different it jumps off the page at you is what he\u0027s saying.\"\\n\\n \"How do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"His list.\"\\n\\n \"The original Will wrote open letters to the vies,\" he said. \"This one writes to McGraw. Plus he lists three at once.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. And look who\u0027s on the list.\"\\n\\n \"Peter Tully, Marvin Rome, and Regis Kilbourne.\"\\n\\n \"Adrian picked people society couldn\u0027t come to terms with. A child killer who got away with it. A Mafia don who got away with everything. A right-to-lifer who\u0027d incited homicide and remained untouchable. A racist firebrand who, like the rest of them, had found a way around the system.\"\\n\\n \"And a defense attorney.\"\\n\\n \"Adrian didn\u0027t really belong on the list, did he? That should have been grounds for suspecting him in and of itself. Leave him out, though, and you\u0027ve got four people who could certainly be viewed as public enemies out of the law\u0027s reach. You could argue that the small-W will of the people might very well be what big-W Will was carrying out.\"\\n\\n \"And the new list?\"\\n\\n \"A labor leader, a judge, and a critic. They\u0027re right up there with Jack the Ripper and Attila the Hun, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" he said. He knocked back the rest of his martini, caught the bartender\u0027s eye and pointed to his glass. \"I could probably think of a few people who might not break down crying if Send-\u0027em-home Rome went to that great courtroom in the sky. The son of a bitch has made a career out of never giving a police officer the benefit of the doubt. He sets minimum bail or releases on own recognizance all the damn time, dismisses cases right and left.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a judge,\" I said, \"and the people voted him into office, and they could vote him out if they really wanted to. And one of these days they probably will.\"\\n\\n \"Not soon enough.\"\\n\\n \"What about Peter Tully?\"\\n\\n \"Well, he\u0027s an arrogant prick,\" he said. \"What\u0027s Will have to say about him? \u0027You hold an entire city hostage to your lust for power as you threaten to thrust a wrench into the machinery of urban transit.\u0027 You know, maybe Will Number Two isn\u0027t such a great mimic after all. I can\u0027t see Number One coming up with a sentence like that.\"\\n\\n \"Listen to his bill of goods against Regis Kilbourne. \u0027Your power over the Broadway stage is near absolute, and it has absolutely corrupted you. Drunk with it, you unfailingly choose form over content, style over substance, promoting the willfully obscure at the expense of the well-made drama with a story to tell.\u0027 There\u0027s more about how he\u0027ll criticize an actor for being physically unattractive, and how unfair it all is.\"\\n\\n He thought about it while the girl brought his drink. \"It\u0027s not just the exotic aspect,\" he said once she was out of hearing range. \"It\u0027s also she happens to be gorgeous.\"\\n\\n \"You and Regis Kilbourne,\" I said, \"placing an undue premium on physical appeal.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re both a couple of superficial bastards,\" he agreed. \"Who the hell would want to kill a critic?\"\\n\\n \"Anybody who ever wrote a play or appeared in one,\" I said, \"which in this town would have to include half the waiters and a third of the bartenders. But they\u0027d like to kill him the way you\u0027d welcome a shot at Judge Send-\u0027em-home Rome. You might relish the fantasy, and it might not break your heart if a piece of the cornice broke off a tall building and took him out when it landed. But you wouldn\u0027t actually want to kill him.\"\\n\\n \"No, and I probably wouldn\u0027t jump for joy if somebody else did, either. It\u0027s not good for the system when people start taking out judges.\"\\n\\n \"Or critics,\" I said, \"or labor leaders, either. You know the difference between the two Wills? The first one objected to the invulnerability of his targets, the way they\u0027d managed to subvert the system. But these three don\u0027t have that kind of invulnerability. Marvin Rome\u0027s not going to be riding the bench forever. The voters\u0027ll probably boot him next time he comes up for reelection.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s hope so.\"\\n\\n \"And Peter Tully can shut down the city, but the governor can return the favor. Under the Taylor Law, he can lock up anybody who orders a work stoppage by public employees. Kilbourne\u0027s probably got a job for life at the Times, but he\u0027s likely to rotate off the theater desk sooner or later, like the man before him. These three are by no means invulnerable, and that\u0027s not what\u0027s got the new Will\u0027s motor running. What he resents is the power of the men on his list.\"\\n\\n \"Power, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Tully can throw a switch and plunge the city into immobility. Rome can unlock the cell doors and put criminals back on the street.\"\\n\\n \"And Regis Kilbourne can tell an actress her nose is too big and her tits are too small and send her running in tears to the nearest plastic surgeon. If you call that power.\"\\n\\n \"He can pretty much decide which shows stay open and which ones close.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got that much clout?\"\\n\\n \"Just about. It\u0027s not him personally, it\u0027s the position he holds. Whoever reviews plays for the Times has influence that comes with the territory. A bad notice from him won\u0027t guarantee a show\u0027s dead, and a rave won\u0027t necessarily keep one open if everybody else hates it. But that\u0027s usually what happens.\"\\n\\n \"Which means he\u0027s the man.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"What man?\u0027 The man with the power.\u0027 Remember that?\"\\n\\n \"Vaguely.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027What power?\u0027 \u0027The power of voodoo.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"It comes back to me now.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Who do?\u0027 \u0027You do.\u0027 They don\u0027t write \u0027em like that anymore, Matt.\"\\n\\n \"No, and I can see why. He must feel powerless himself, don\u0027t you figure?\"\\n\\n \"Who, the man with the power?\"\\n\\n \"The man who wrote this.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see.\" He held the letter, scanned it. \"Powerless, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think so?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I suppose that\u0027s what the Feebies would say if they did a profile of him. He resents the power others have over him and seeks to redress the balance by threatening their lives. Plus he wet the bed when he was a kid.\"\\n\\n \"Funny how they always tell you that.\"\\n\\n \"Like it\u0027s going to help you find the son of a bitch. \u0027Hey, the FBI says our guy used to wet the bed, so I want you guys out on the street looking for a grown-up little pisspot.\u0027 Useful bit of knowledge when you\u0027re mounting a manhunt, but they always toss it in.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Along with the information that he came from a dysfunctional family. Jesus, that\u0027s helpful, isn\u0027t it? A dysfunctional family, holy shit, whoever heard of such a thing?\"\\n\\n \"If you came from a dysfunctional family,\" I said solemnly, \"you\u0027d wet the bed, too.\"\\n\\n \"And probably kill a few people while I was at it. It\u0027s all part of the package.\" He frowned at the letter. \"Powerless and resenting the power of others. Yeah, I suppose so. It\u0027s a hard theory to argue with. But you know what he reminds me of, Will Number Two?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"A list of pet peeves like you\u0027d write up for the high school yearbook. \u0027What really pisses me off is insincere people, snap quizzes in algebra class, and lumpy mashed potatoes.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Well, who likes lumpy mashed potatoes?\"\\n\\n \"Not me. They make me want to kill the pope. But isn\u0027t that how it reads? \u0027Here\u0027s a list of the people who really piss me off.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n \"I am, aren\u0027t I?\" He pushed his stool back. \"The son of a bitch doesn\u0027t sound like a homicidal maniac. He just sounds like a nut with a hair up his ass.\"\\n\\n 18\\n\\n The next couple of days were a three-ring circus for the media. Marty McGraw broke the story of the new letter from Will, with \"WILL\u0027S BAAAAACK!\" on his newspaper\u0027s front page. Reporters hurried around town interviewing his three prospective victims, each of whom seemed to take the distinction more as an insult than a threat.\\n\\n Peter Tully chose to see Will not as a personal foe but as an enemy of organized labor as a whole. He issued a statement linking the anonymous letter writer with the repressive anti-union forces as exemplified by the mayor and the governor. There was a wonderful cadence of old-fashioned lefty rhetoric to his words. You could almost hear the Almanac Singers in the background, harmonizing on \"Union Maid\" and \"Miner\u0027s Lifeguard,\" songs to fan the flames of discontent.\\n\\n Judge Marvin Rome managed to view Will\u0027s attack as an assault on civil liberties and the rights of the accused. The one time I saw him on the news, he was linking Will with prosecutors and police officers who were willing to call an end run around the Bill of Rights in order to railroad a defendant-\"invariably poor, and all too often black\"-into a prison cell. Will\u0027s threat, he assured the public, would no more lead him to compromise his principles than had the vilification he\u0027d received over the years from DAs and cops and their lackeys in the press. He would go on dispensing true justice and tempering it with mercy.\\n\\n Regis Kilbourne turned the whole thing into a free-speech issue, lamenting a world in which a critic might feel constrained in any way from the free expression of his views. He went on to say the worst constraints came not from government censorship or his newspaper\u0027s editorial policy, but from \"those very aspects of oneself one tends to regard as emblematic of one\u0027s better nature.\" Friendship, compassion, and a sense of fair play seemed to be the worst offenders, tempting one to give a kinder, gentler review than the material might otherwise deserve. \"If I have dared to inflict pain, to destroy a cherished relationship, to crush a perhaps promising career, all for the sake of a higher truth, can simple physical fear possibly sway me from my course? Indeed, it cannot and it will not.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-32.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \\n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
