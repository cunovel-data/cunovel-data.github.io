{"id":64279,"no":47,"title":"Page 47","content":"One afternoon we stopped in at a reception at Chance Coulter\u0027s art gallery on upper Madison Avenue, then had dinner with Ray Gruliow and his wife. We ended the night at Danny Boy Bell\u0027s table at a new cellar jazz club in the west nineties, listening to a young man who\u0027d listened a lot to Coltrane when he wasn\u0027t listening to Sonny Rollins. The following afternoon Mick called to say someone had given him a good pair of seats for the Knicks game, and could Elaine and I use them? Elaine, who feels about basketball the way Mick feels about ballet, insisted that I go with Mick. We watched them lose to the Hornets in overtime, and she met the two of us afterward for dinner at Paris Green.\\n\\n The night before Christmas we had dinner at home. She made pasta and a salad and we thought about having a fire in the fireplace and decided it was more trouble than it\u0027s worth. Besides, she said, Santa might sue. During the evening the phone rang a few times, with the usual round of holiday greetings. One of the callers was Tom Havlicek, telling me I\u0027d once again managed to miss the opening day of deer season. \"Damn,\" I said. \"I\u0027d marked it on my calendar, too.\" He asked for an update on Havemeyer, and I filled him in and told him his fellow Ohioan had a good lawyer and would probably wind up with a relatively light sentence.\\n\\n Jason would be interested, he said. The boy had been buying the New York papers and clipping the stories. And he\u0027d spent a long afternoon with Tom in Massillon, getting a little career advice. He was talking about taking a couple of undergraduate courses in police science, then getting his law degree and passing the bar exam, and then going into some form of police work.\\n\\n \"My guess is he\u0027ll land in the DA\u0027s office,\" he said, \"but the way he\u0027s talking now he wants to wear blue and carry a badge. You ever hear of a working cop with a law school diploma on his wall?\" I said he\u0027d probably wind up being Massillon\u0027s next chief of police, and Tom made a rude noise. \"For that,\" he said, \"you need two things I hope he\u0027ll never have, a fat ass and a foul disposition. And you never heard me say that.\"\\n\\n Shortly before midnight the two of us walked up to St. Paul\u0027s. It was a clear night, and not too cold, and it looked as though they were having a decent turnout for midnight mass. Our destination, however, was not the sanctuary but the basement, where my AA group was having our annual midnight meeting. It\u0027s an open meeting, not limited to self-declared alcoholics, so Elaine was welcome. For the occasion, candles provided the illumination, and there was a better-than-usual selection of cookies laid out by the coffee urns, but in every other respect it was a typical meeting, with the speaker\u0027s drinking story taking up the first twenty minutes or so and round-robin sharing filling out the hour.\\n\\n At one o\u0027clock we said the serenity prayer and put the chairs away and walked home, and by the time we got there we decided not to wait until morning to open our presents. I got a cardigan sweater from Barney\u0027s and a silk shirt from Bergdorf\u0027s, along with firm instructions to take them back and exchange them if I didn\u0027t think I was likely to wear them. I also got a hat from Worth \u0026 Worth-\"because you got the hat trick,\" she said, \"so I figured you earned it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a different style for me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a homburg. Does it fit? It should, it\u0027s the same size as your fedora. Try it on. What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it fits. I think I like it. It\u0027s dressier than the fedora, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"A little bit. Let\u0027s see. Oh, I really like it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s me, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Not every man could wear a hat like that.\"\\n\\n \"But I can?\"\\n\\n \"They should use you in their ads,\" she said. \"You old bear.\"\\n\\n She seemed to like her presents. I made her open the earrings last, and the light that came into her eyes told me I\u0027d chosen well. \"You wait here,\" she said. \"I want to try them on. Give me the homburg.\"\\n\\n \"What for?\"\\n\\n \"Just gimme.\"\\n\\n She went into the bathroom and emerged a few minutes later wearing the hat and the earrings and nothing else. \"Well?\" she said. \"What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"I think the earrings really make the outfit.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah? What else do you think?\"\\n\\n \"Come here,\" I said, \"and I\u0027ll show you.\"\\n\\n We slept late Christmas morning, and were in the middle of breakfast when the doorman called on the intercom to tell us we had a visitor who gave his name as TJ. Send him up, I said.\\n\\n \"I gave my name as TJ,\" he said, \" \u0027cause that be who I am, Sam.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d brought presents, wrapped and tied with ribbon. Elaine\u0027s was an antique dresser set, a brush and comb and hand mirror and scissors, all backed in mother of pearl. \"This is beautiful,\" she said. \"How did you know to buy me this?\"\\n\\n \"Saw you lookin\u0027 at one the time we went to the Twenty-sixth Street flea market. Only it wasn\u0027t in good shape so you put it back. So I figured I might could find one in better condition.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re amazing,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, Merry Christmas, you know?\"\\n\\n \"Merry Christmas, TJ.\"\\n\\n To me he said, \"What you waitin\u0027 for? Ain\u0027t you gonna open yours?\"\\n\\n It was a card case covered in ostrich skin. It was quite elegant, and I told him so.\\n\\n \"Figured you could use it. For your business cards, you know? Open it up, this here\u0027s the best part. See? Two compartments. What They say is one\u0027s for your cards and one\u0027s for cards people give to you, but what I figured is one\u0027s for your cards and the other\u0027s for the fake ones you use when you\u0027s representin\u0027 yourself to be somebody you ain\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"The perfect gift,\" Elaine said, \"for the man who has everything except integrity.\"\\n\\n He unwrapped his presents, which included a sweater she\u0027d picked out for Jiim and a new wallet. \" \u0027Cause yours was lookin\u0027 a little shabby, Abby,\" she said, and he rolled his eyes. She told him to look inside, and he found the gift certificate.\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s bad luck to give a wallet with nothing in it,\" she explained.\\n\\n \"Brooks Brothers,\" he said. \"Buy me somethin\u0027 slick to wear on the Deuce.\"\\n\\n \"God help the Deuce,\" I said, and stood up and stretched. \"Well, so much for Christmas.\"\\n\\n \"It be over already?\"\\n\\n \"Just about. Right now there\u0027s something I need your help with across the street.\"\\n\\n \"What, in the hotel? Can\u0027t be movin\u0027 furniture. You ain\u0027t hardly got none.\"\\n\\n \"No heavy lifting,\" I said. \"That\u0027s a promise.\"\\n\\n TJ\u0027s face is expressive, but only when he wants it to be. I guess you learn to mask your emotions on the street. I\u0027ve seen him receive information that astounded him without any of his surprise showing in his eyes.\\n\\n But when I opened the door to my hotel room I was able to get a good look at his face, and the mask slipped. His eyes widened and his jaw dropped.\\n\\n \"You got one,\" he said, approaching the desk reverently. \"Never thought you would. Told you an\u0027 told you, but I never thought you would. Elaine bought it for you, didn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I picked it out myself.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a Mac,\" he announced. \"They easier to learn, what everybody says. That girl helped me learn all that shit about cyanide? She\u0027s got a Mac. Probably teach me how to use it. Not to do like the Kongs can do, but regular stuff. An\u0027 there\u0027s courses I can take, an\u0027 other people can teach me things. Shit, you got everything here. Got a printer, got a modem. Don\u0027t tell me you hooked this up all by yourself?\"\\n\\n \"The fellow who sold it to me helped set it up. He also installed all the software he assured me I couldn\u0027t live without. The disks and boxes are in the closet, and there\u0027s a stack of manuals on the chair.\"\\n\\n \"Takes up space,\" he said. \"That why you set it up here \u0027stead of \u0027cross the street?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one reason.\"\\n\\n He picked up a thick instruction manual, riffled the pages, returned it to the stack. \"Keep us both readin\u0027 for months,\" he said. \"Man, you really did it. Bought yourself a real present.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"No?\"\\n\\n \"It s for you,\" I said. \"Merry Christmas.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s for me?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"No it ain\u0027t,\" he said. \"I likely to be the one uses it the most, but that don\u0027t make it mine.\"\\n\\n \"I bought it for you,\" I said, \"and I\u0027m giving it to you. That\u0027s what makes it yours.\"\\n\\n \"You serious?\"\\n\\n \"Of course I\u0027m serious,\" I said. \"Merry Christmas.\"\\n\\n He was a moment taking it all in. \"That be why it\u0027s over here,\" he said. \"So I can fool with it an\u0027 not be disturbin\u0027 you an\u0027 Elaine. You be able to fix it up with them downstairs so I can come up anytime I want?\"\\n\\n \"How could they stop you?\"\\n\\n \"What you mean? They own the hotel, they stop anybody they want.\"\\n\\n \"Not if it\u0027s your room.\"\\n\\n \"Say what?\"\\n\\n I tossed him the key and he snatched it out of the air. I said, \"I\u0027ve had this place for twenty years, and the rent\u0027s so low I\u0027d be crazy to give it up. But I never use it. I come here maybe once a month to sulk and make free phone calls. What do I need it for?\"\\n\\n \"So you givin\u0027 it to me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go on paying the rent,\" I said, \"and I\u0027ll be the tenant of record, so that it stays rent-controlled. But they\u0027ll know at the desk that I\u0027m letting you stay here, and Santa Claus was nice enough to them this year so that they won\u0027t give you a hard time.\" I shrugged. \"I may drop by now and then to make long-distance calls, or to watch you perform miracles on the computer, but I won\u0027t show up without calling first. Because it\u0027s your place now.\"\\n\\n He turned toward the computer, rested his fingers on the keyboard. \"Guess you figure I ain\u0027t got no place of my own,\" he said.\\n\\n \"As a matter of fact,\" I said, \"I\u0027m personally convinced you\u0027ve got six homes of your own, including a penthouse on Sutton Place and a beachfront cottage in Barbados. But I\u0027m a selfish son of a bitch, and I wanted to manipulate you into living right across the street from us.\"\\n\\n \"Figured you had a reason.\" He was still looking at the computer. He was silent for a moment, and then he said, \"You know, I ain\u0027t cried in years. Last time was when my grandmother came home from the doctor\u0027s an\u0027 said she was gonna die. Then when she did die I was real sad, you know, but I was cool with it. I didn\u0027t part with no tears. An\u0027 I ain\u0027t cried since.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \"An\u0027 I don\u0027t want to cry,\" he said. \"So there\u0027s stuff I\u0027d be sayin\u0027 now, \u0027bout you an\u0027 Elaine, an\u0027 how, you know, how I feel an\u0027 all. But I ain\u0027t gonna say it.\"\\n\\n \"I understand.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Cause if I was to try to say it…\"\\n\\n \"I understand.\"\\n\\n \"But that don\u0027t mean it don\u0027t be real, \u0027cause it do.\"\\n\\n \"I understand that, too.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well you real understanding Brandon.\" He turned toward me, under control now. \"Merry Christmas,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Merry Christmas.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-47.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \\n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
