{"id":64248,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"If he knew-\" \"If he knew,\" I said, \"maybe he\u0027s the one who put the cyanide in the scotch. That would explain how Will managed to walk through walls and get in and out of a burglar-proof apartment. He was never there at all. Whitfield killed himself.\" \"Is that what you think happened?\" \"I don\u0027t know what I think,\" I said, and got up to answer the phone. It was Wally Donn, with the same question. \"The son of a bitch was dying,\" he said. \"What do you figure, Matt? You knew him pretty well.\" \"I hardly knew him at all.\" \"Well, you knew him better than I did, for Christ\u0027s sake. Was he the type to kill himself?\" \"I don\u0027t know what type that is.\" \"The most I can get out of Dahlgren is he was moody. The hell, I\u0027d be moody myself if I got a letter from Will. I\u0027d be twice as moody if I had what Whitfield had.\" \"If he knew he had it.\" \"For that you\u0027d need his medical records, and his doctor\u0027s out of town for the weekend. They\u0027ll be getting in touch with him tomorrow and we\u0027ll know a little more. I\u0027m just picturing this son of a bitch, deliberately taking poison right in front of a young fellow who\u0027s getting paid to protect his life.\" \"You know,\" I said, \"you\u0027re calling him a son of a bitch, but if it wasn\u0027t suicide…\" \"Then I\u0027m maligning a man after I already failed to protect him, and that makes me the son of a bitch.\" He sighed. \"The world\u0027s a confusing fucking place to be in, and don\u0027t let anybody tell you different.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t dream of it.\" \"What\u0027d he be doing, anyway, committing some Polish version of suicide? Trying to disguise it, make it look like murder?\" \"Usually it\u0027s the other way around.\" \"Guys killing people, trying to fix it so it looks like they killed themselves. Why would you turn it around? Insurance?\" \"That would only make sense if there\u0027s a policy he took out recently. The clause that excludes suicide only applies for a certain amount of time.\" \"Usually a year, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I think so. It\u0027s to prevent a person from deliberately bilking them by taking out a policy with the intent of killing himself. But when you\u0027ve got a policy holder who\u0027s been paying premiums for twenty years, you can\u0027t weasel out of your obligation to him just because he got depressed and took a dive in front of the F train.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve done enough insurance work over the years to convince me they\u0027ll weasel out of anything they can. They\u0027re the worst when it comes to questioning items when we bill them for our services. Force of habit, it must be.\" \"Speaking of bills, if it turns out he did it himself-\" \"What, I can bill the estate? We signed on to protect him and we couldn\u0027t even protect him from himself? I\u0027d rather eat it than try to collect it.\" When there\u0027s enough media attention, you can\u0027t find a place to hide where somebody won\u0027t come after you. Will seemed to be managing so far, but Philip M. Bushing, M.D., didn\u0027t have an equal talent for concealment. He\u0027d gone fishing in Georgian Bay, and some enterprising reporter had managed to track him down. Bushing was Adrian Whitfield\u0027s physician, specializing in internal medicine-a term, Elaine pointed out, that you would think ought to cover just about everything but dermatology. He evidently confined doctor-patient privilege to those patients who were still breathing, and so felt free to disclose that he had diagnosed Adrian Whitfield\u0027s illness in the spring, and had had the sad task of communicating that fact to the patient. Whitfield had taken it well, Bushing recalled, ultimately treating the physician as a hostile witness. He\u0027d forced Bushing to admit that neither surgery nor chemotherapy offered any prospect of curing his condition, and got him to estimate how much time he had left. Six months to a year, Bushing told him, and referred him to an oncologist at Sloan-Kettering. Whitfield called that man, a Dr. Ronald Patel, and made and kept an appointment with him. Patel confirmed Bushing\u0027s diagnosis and proposed an aggressive protocol of radiation and chemotherapy, which he felt might win the patient another year of life. Whitfield thanked him and left, and Patel never heard from him again. \"I assumed he wanted another opinion,\" Patel said. If he wanted an opinion on anything, he was in the right town for it. Everybody had one, and by Tuesday morning I think I\u0027d heard them all. The general consensus seemed to hold that Whitfield\u0027s death was suicide, and one authority on the topic described it as an opportunistic act of self-destruction. I knew what he meant, but it struck me as a curious phrase. More than a few people were bothered by the method he chose, regarding it as showing little consideration for others-or, for that matter, for Whitfield himself. Cyanide brought an end that was a long way from painless. You did not drift off dreamily into that sleep from which there was no awakening. All that was to be said for it, really, was that you went fast. \"Still,\" I told Elaine, \"there aren\u0027t that many gentle paths out of this world, and a surprising number of people pick a rocky road for themselves. Cops eat their guns with such regularity you\u0027d think the barrels were dipped in chocolate.\" \"I think it makes a statement, don\u0027t you? \u0027I\u0027m using my service revolver, therefore the job killed me.\u0027 \" \"That fits,\" I agreed, \"but by now I think it\u0027s just part of the tradition. And it\u0027s quick and it\u0027s certain, unless the bullet takes a bad hop. And the means is close at hand.\" A local television personality quoted Dorothy Parker: Razors pain you, Rivers are damp, Acids stain you And drugs cause cramp; Guns aren\u0027t lawful, Nooses give, Gas smells awful- You might as well live. This brought a rejoinder, predictably enough, from a spokeswoman for the Hemlock Society, who felt the need to point out just how far we\u0027d come since Parker wrote those lines. There were, she was pleased to report, several carefree ways one could do away with oneself, and the two of which she seemed fondest consisted of gassing yourself in the garage with carbon monoxide or suffocating yourself with a plastic bag. \"Unfortunately,\" she said, \"not everybody has a car.\" \"Sad but true,\" said Elaine, talking back to the television set. \"Fortunately, however, just about everybody has a plastic bag. \u0027Dad, can I borrow the car tonight? No? Well, can I borrow the plastic bag?\" The real victim, someone else maintained, was Kevin Dahlgren, who\u0027d been subjected to no end of stress by virtue of the fact that Whitfield had been inconsiderate enough to drop dead in front of him. At least one talk show included a psychologist and a trauma expert talking about the possible short- and long-term impact of the incident upon Dahlgren. Dahlgren ducked most interviews, and acquitted himself creditably when he was cornered. He had, he said, no opinion as to whether he\u0027d witnessed an act of suicide or murder. His only regret was that there\u0027d been nothing he could do to save the man\u0027s life. If Dahlgren didn\u0027t want the victim role, a man named Irwin Atkins was eager to snatch it up for himself. Atkins was Adrian Whitfield\u0027s final client, the brawler who\u0027d decided to plead guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge just hours before Adrian Whitfield went off to argue his own case before a higher court. Building on the speculation that Whitfield had felt free to end his life once the case had been disposed of, Atkins served notice of his intention to file an appeal on the grounds that he\u0027d been improperly served by counsel. \"He\u0027s got two arguments,\" Ray Gruliow told me. \"One, Whitfield deliberately talked him into pleading because he was in a rush to go home and drink rat poison, or whatever the hell it was. Two, Whitfield\u0027s suicidal state of mind impaired his judgment and rendered him incapable of furnishing sound legal advice. He could buttress his second argument by pointing out that Whitfield was sufficiently unbalanced as to take on a mutt like him for a client.\" \"You think it\u0027ll work?\" \"I think they\u0027ll let him withdraw the plea,\" he said, \"and I think he\u0027ll regret it, the silly son of a bitch, when his retrial ends in a conviction.\" \"And will it?\" \"Oh, I\u0027d say so. You pull something like that, withdraw an eleventh-hour plea, and you invite the widespread perception that you\u0027re a pain in the ass. I think it\u0027s all a load of crap anyway. Adrian didn\u0027t kill himself.\" \"No?\" \"I\u0027d never argue it\u0027d be a bad choice, or that it wasn\u0027t his choice to make. And I think he might have done it sooner or later. He could very well have been contemplating the act, might even have had it on his mind while he poured himself that drink. But I don\u0027t believe he had the faintest idea there was anything in that bottle but good scotch whiskey.\" \"Why?\" \"Because what in the hell is the point? If Adrian was going to kill himself he\u0027d damn well leave a note, and I wouldn\u0027t have put it past him to get the document notarized. Anything else would have been inconsistent with the man.\" I\u0027d thought as much myself. \"I\u0027m not saying he lacked a sense of the dramatic. He was a trial lawyer, after all. If we didn\u0027t like to be in the spotlight we\u0027d spend our lives writing briefs in back rooms. I can imagine Adrian killing himself, and I can even see him doing it in front of witnesses. Remember Harmon Ruttenstein?\" \"Vividly.\" \"Invited some friends over, sat them down, gave them drinks, and told them he wanted them around so there wouldn\u0027t be any horseshit about what happened. And then he took a header out the window. I\u0027m committing suicide, he was saying, and I want you fellows here to attest to it. That\u0027s completely different from what they say Adrian did.\" \"He made it look like murder.\" \"Exactly, and why? That\u0027s the question nobody bothers to ask, maybe because nobody can answer it. Because there\u0027s a stigma attached to it? Adrian wasn\u0027t raised Catholic, and as far as I know the only thing he believed in absolutely was collecting fees in advance in criminal cases. Because he didn\u0027t want to invalidate his insurance policies? They keep floating that in the press and on television, as if suicide automatically had that effect.\" \"I was talking about that the other day,\" I said. \"It\u0027s a pretty common misconception.\" \"And of course it doesn\u0027t apply, because Adrian\u0027s coverage consisted entirely of policies which had been in force for years. He hadn\u0027t applied for additional coverage since the doctor gave him the bad news. This all came out yesterday, but they\u0027re still prattling about insurance. I just heard a new wrinkle. Double indemnity.\" \"For accidental death?\" \"Right. As far as the insurance companies are concerned, murder is an accident. It qualifies in that respect if the policy contains a clause specifying a two-hundred-percent payout for accidental death. Stupid clause, incidentally. You\u0027re buying financial protection, what the hell\u0027s the difference if you fall out of the hay loft or flake away with terminal psoriasis? If anything, you\u0027d think it should be the other way around. It\u0027s slow natural deaths that run up the costs for the family, so that\u0027s when they\u0027d need extra protection.\" \"I gather suicide\u0027s not considered accidental.\" \"Well, you can\u0027t argue it\u0027s natural death, either, but it\u0027s excluded from double-indemnity coverage in every policy I ever heard of. So it\u0027s within the realm of possibility that a man would be sufficiently moved by consideration of his family\u0027s financial well-being to commit suicide in such a manner as to resemble accidental death.\" He took a breath. \"Whew. Did you hear that? I sounded like a goddam lawyer.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-16.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
