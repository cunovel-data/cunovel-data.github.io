A restaurant, a saloon, place on the order of the old Toots Shor\u0027s. Kind of joint where you can have a few pops and get a decent steak without worrying what kind of wine goes with it. Call it Square One because you know you\u0027re always going to wind up back at it. You getting anywhere with Will?\"\n \"You must mean Will Number Two.\"\n \"I mean the son of a bitch who wrote me a letter threatening three prominent New Yorkers, and nobody seems to give a shit. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve been looking into it by any chance.\"\n \"I don\u0027t figure it\u0027s any business of mine.\"\n \"Hey, when did that ever stop you in the past?\" I didn\u0027t say anything right away, and he said, \"That sounded wrong, the way it came out. Don\u0027t take it the wrong way, will you, Matt?\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n \"You read that crap in the competition this morning?\"\n \"The competition?\"\n \"The New York Fucking Post. That\u0027s close to the original name of that rag, as a matter of fact. The New York Evening Post, that\u0027s what used to grace that masthead.\"\n \"Like the Saturday Evening Post?\"\n \"That was a magazine, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\n \"I know that, I just-\"\n \"Slight difference, one\u0027s a magazine, the other\u0027s a newspaper.\" I could hear the drink in his voice now. I suppose it had been there all along, but I hadn\u0027t been aware of it before. \"There\u0027s a story about the Post,\" he said. \"Years ago, before you were born or your father before you, they were in an ass-kicking and hair-pulling contest with the old New York World. The Post had the rag on one day and ran an editorial calling the World a yellow dog. Now this was considered quite the insult. You know, yellow journalism? You familiar with the term?\"\n \"Not as well as you are.\"\n \"What\u0027s that? Oh, a wiseass. You want to hear this or not?\"\n \"I\u0027d love to hear it.\"\n \"So everybody was waiting to see what the World was going to come back with. And next day there\u0027s an editorial in the World. \u0027The New York Evening Post calls us a yellow dog. Our reply is the reply of any dog to any post.\u0027 You get it, or is the subtlety of a bygone age lost on you?\"\n \"I get it.\"\n \"In other words, piss on you.\"\n \"When was this?\"\n \"I dunno, eighty years ago? Maybe more. Nowadays a newspaper could come right out and say, \u0027Piss on you,\u0027 and nobody\u0027d turn a hair, the way standards have fucking crumbled. How the hell did I get on this?\"\n \"The Post.\"\n \"Right, the New York Fucking Post. They\u0027ve got an analysis of the latest letter, supposedly proves the guy\u0027s a phony, a talker and not a doer. Some expert, some college professor, needs to read the instructions on the roll of Charmin before he can figure out how to wipe his ass. What do you think of that?\"\n \"What do I think of what?\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you say it\u0027s irresponsible? They\u0027re calling the guy a liar to his face.\"\n \"Only if he reads the Post.\"\n He laughed. \"And piss on them, huh? But you get what I mean, don\u0027t you? They\u0027re saying, \u0027I dare you.\u0027 Saying, \u0027Go ahead, kill somebody, make my day.\u0027 I call that irresponsible.\"\n \"If you say so.\"\n \"Why, you patronizing son of a bitch. Are you too much of a big shot now to have conversation with me?\"\n I resisted the impulse to hang up. \"Of course not,\" I said soothingly. \"I think you\u0027re probably right saying what you said, but it\u0027s no longer something I\u0027m involved in, not even peripherally. And I\u0027m going nuts enough without it.\"\n \"Oh, yeah? Over what?\"\n \"Another case that\u0027s not really any business of mine, but I seem to have taken it on. There\u0027s a man I\u0027m just about certain committed murder, and I\u0027m damned if I can figure out why.\"\n \"Gotta be love or money,\" he said. \"Unless he\u0027s a public-spirited son of a bitch like my guy.\"\n \"It\u0027s money, but I can\u0027t make it make sense. Suppose you\u0027re insured and I\u0027m the beneficiary. I gain if you die.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t we make it the other way around?\"\n \"Just let me-\"\n \"No, really,\" he said, his voice rising as he got into it. \"I know this is hypothetical, but why do I have to be the schmuck? Make it that I win if you die.\"\n \"Fine. You gain if I die. So I jump out the window, and-\"\n \"Why do a crazy thing like that?\"\n \"And you shoot me on the way down. Why?\"\n \"You jump out the window and I shoot you on the way down.\"\n \"Right. Why?\"\n \"Target practice? Is this some trick, you were wearing a parachute, some shit like that?\"\n \"Jesus,\" I said. \"No, it\u0027s not a trick question. It\u0027s an analogy.\"\n \"Well, excuuuuse me. I shoot you on the way down?\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"And kill you.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"But you would have died anyhow when you landed. Because this is an analogy and not a trick question, so please tell me it\u0027s not a first-floor window you just jumped out of.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s a high floor.\"\n \"And no parachute.\"\n \"No parachute.\"\n \"Well, shit,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t get the money if it\u0027s suicide. How\u0027s that for simple?\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t apply.\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t apply? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?\"\n \"Suicide wouldn\u0027t invalidate the policy,\" I said. \"Anyway, when I jump out the window it\u0027s not suicide.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s an act of Christian charity. It\u0027s a response to overwhelming public demand. Why isn\u0027t it suicide when you jump out the window? You\u0027re not a bird or a plane, let alone Superman.\"\n \"The analogy was imperfect,\" I allowed. \"Let\u0027s just say I\u0027m falling from a great height.\"\n \"What did you do, lose your balance?\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t be the first time.\"\n \"Ha! Tell me about it. So it\u0027s an accident, is that what you\u0027re saying?… Where\u0027d you go? Hey, Earth to Matt. Are you there?\"\n \"I\u0027m here.\"\n \"Well, you had me wondering. It\u0027s an accident, right?\"\n \"Right,\" I said. \"It\u0027s an accident.\"\n 21\n I stayed put over the weekend. I went to a couple of meetings, and Saturday afternoon Elaine and I took the #7 train out to Flushing and walked around the new Chinatown. She complained that it wasn\u0027t like Manhattan\u0027s Chinatown at all, feeling neither quaint nor sinister but disturbingly suburban. We wound up eating at a Taiwanese vegetarian restaurant, and after two bites she put down her chopsticks and said, \"I take back everything I said.\"\n \"Not bad, huh?\"\n \"Heaven,\" she said.\n Sunday I had dinner with Jim Faber for the first time in quite a few weeks, and that meant another Chinese meal, but in our own part of town, not way out in Queens. We talked about a lot of different things, including Marty McGraw\u0027s column in that morning\u0027s News, in which he\u0027d essentially accused Will #2 of jerking us all around.\n \"I can\u0027t understand it,\" I said. \"I talked to him a couple of days ago and he was pissed off at the Post for running a story suggesting that this Will is all hat and no cattle. And now he-\"\n \"All hat and no cattle?\"\n \"All talk and no action.\"\n \"I know what it means. I\u0027m just surprised to hear it coming out of your New York mouth.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been on the phone with a lot of Texans lately,\" I said. \"Maybe some of it rubbed off. The point is he called them irresponsible for writing Will off, and now he\u0027s deliberately goading him himself, telling the guy to shit or get off the pot.\"\n \"Maybe the police put him up to it.\"\n \"Maybe.\"\n \"But you don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"I think they\u0027d be more inclined to let sleeping dogs lie. That\u0027s more their style than using Marty as a cafs-paw.\"\n \"Cats and dogs,\" he said. \"Sounds like rain. McGraw\u0027s a drunk, isn\u0027t he? Didn\u0027t you tell me that?\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to take his inventory.\"\n \"Oh, go ahead and take his inventory. \u0027We are not saints,\u0027 remember?\"\n \"Then I suppose he\u0027s a drunk.\"\n \"And you\u0027re surprised he\u0027s not perfectly consistent? Maybe he doesn\u0027t remember objecting to the story in the Post. Maybe he doesn\u0027t even remember reading it.\"\n Monday I got on the phone right after breakfast and made half a dozen calls, some of them lengthy. I called from the apartment, not from my hotel room across the street, which meant I\u0027d be charged for the calls. That allowed me to feel virtuous and stupid instead of shady and clever.\n Tuesday morning Marty McGraw\u0027s column included a letter from Will. There was a teaser headline to that effect on the front page, but the main story was about a drug-related massacre in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Before I even saw the paper, the doorman rang upstairs during breakfast to announce a FedEx delivery. I said I\u0027d be down to pick it up, and I was eager enough to get going that I skipped my second cup of coffee.\n The delivery was what I was expecting, an overnight letter containing three photographs. They were all four-by-five color snaps of the same individual, a slightly built white man in his late forties or early fifties, clean-shaven, with small even features and eyes that were invisible behind wirerimmed eyeglasses.\n I beeped TJ and met him at a lunch counter in the Port Authority bus terminal. It was full of wary people, their eyes forever darting around the room. I suppose they had their reasons. It was hard to guess which they feared more, assault or arrest.\n TJ spoke highly of the glazed doughnuts, and put away a couple of them. I let them toast a bagel for me and ate half of it. I knew better than to drink their coffee.\n TJ squinted at the photos and announced that their subject looked like Clark Kent. \" \u0027Cept he\u0027d need more than a costume change to turn hisself into Superman. This the dude chilled Myron?\"\n \"Byron.\"\n \"What I meant. This him?\"\n \"I think so.\"\n \"Don\u0027t look like no iceman. Look like he\u0027d have to call in for backup \u0027fore he\u0027d step on a cockroach.\"\n \"That witness you found,\" I said. \"I was wondering if you could find him again.\"\n \"The dude who was dealin\u0027.\"\n \"That\u0027s the one.\"\n \"Might be I could find him. You sellin\u0027 product, you don\u0027t want to make yourself too hard to find. Or folks be buyin\u0027 from somebody else.\" He tapped the picture. \"Dude saw the shooter from the back, Jack.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t he get a glimpse of his face after the shooting?\"\n He tilted his head back, grabbing at the memory. \"Said he was white,\" he recalled. \"Said he was ordinary lookin\u0027. Must be he saw him a little bit, but don\u0027t there be other witnesses got a better look at him?\"\n \"Several of them,\" I agreed.\n \"So what we doin\u0027, coverin\u0027 all the bases?\"\n I shook my head. \"The other witnesses might have to testify in court. That means their first look at Havemeyer ought to be in a police lineup. If his lawyer finds out some private cop showed them a picture ahead of time, then their ID is tainted and the judge won\u0027t allow it.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-37.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
