{"id":64243,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"If it was anything of that sort, there was a chance the word would get around on the street, and I sent TJ off to look for it. He could get more that way than I could.\\n\\n Meanwhile, I could look for the motive in Byron\u0027s life.\\n\\n I picked up the phone and called Ginnie. \"Tell me about him,\" I said.\\n\\n \"What do you want to know?\"\\n\\n \"There are things that don\u0027t add up. He was a rent-stabilized tenant with a decent apartment in a good building that went co-op a little over twelve years ago. It was a noneviction plan, which meant the tenants could either buy in at the insider\u0027s price or stay on as rental tenants. That\u0027s what he did, he went on paying rent.\"\\n\\n \"He was shooting half a dozen bags of heroin at the time,\" she said. \"Junkies don\u0027t generally make the best investment decisions. He said he wished he\u0027d bought the apartment when he had the chance, but it never even seemed like an option at the time.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s surprising,\" I said, \"is that he managed to keep the place at all. If he was a junkie-\"\\n\\n \"He had the habit but not the lifestyle, Matt. He was a Wall Street junkie.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t mean he was addicted to the stock market.\"\\n\\n \"No, he was addicted to heroin and alcohol. But he worked on Wall Street. It was a low-level position, he was some sort of order clerk in a brokerage house, but he put in his nine-to-five and didn\u0027t take too many sick days. He kept his job and he paid his rent and he never lost his apartment.\"\\n\\n \"I know there are people who manage to pull that off.\"\\n\\n \"Drunks do it all the time. When you hear the word heroin you automatically think of criminals.\"\\n\\n \"Well, buying it\u0027s a criminal transaction to start with.\"\\n\\n \"And a heavy habit costs more than most junkies can earn legitimately. But if you\u0027ve got a decent job and your habit\u0027s not a monster, you can maintain.\"\\n\\n \"I know there are middle-class people who use it,\" I said. \"There was that woman last month, a magazine editor married to a tax lawyer. Of course she didn\u0027t use a needle.\"\\n\\n \"Not in the age of AIDS. Byron wouldn\u0027t have used a needle either, if he\u0027d started a few years later than he did. But it\u0027s still heroin even if you snort it. You get high if you use it and dope-sick if you don\u0027t. And if you take too much it kills you. The reason we know about the magazine editor is that she died of an overdose.\"\\n\\n We talked about that, and then I said, \"So he kept the same job all those years.\"\\n\\n \"He kept it until he got sober. Then he lost it when his firm was swallowed up in a merger, but I don\u0027t think he was out of work for more than two months before he found something very much like it with another firm. And he kept that job until he had to quit for health reasons.\"\\n\\n \"And how long ago was that?\"\\n\\n \"I think six months, but it may have been longer than that. Yes, it was, because I remember he had stopped working before the holidays, but he went back to the office Christmas party.\"\\n\\n \"Always a comfortable place for a sober alcoholic.\"\\n\\n \"He was depressed afterward, and I don\u0027t think it was from being around all the drinking. Although that might have been part of it. I think it was from knowing that part of his life was over. He\u0027d never be able to go back to work.\"\\n\\n \"Some people would call that one of the good things about AIDS.\"\\n\\n \"Like not having to worry about skin cancer? I\u0027m sure you\u0027re right. But Byron wasn\u0027t like that. He liked having a job to go to.\"\\n\\n \"He had money in the bank,\" I said. \"Close to forty thousand dollars.\"\\n\\n \"Is that how much it was? I knew he didn\u0027t have to worry about money. His health insurance was in force, and he said he had enough money to last him. To see him out, that was the expression he used.\" She was silent for a moment. \"This past winter he said he thought he had about a year to go, two years at the outside. Barring a miracle drug, or some other kind of miracle.\"\\n\\n \"I understand there was a will,\" I said. \"Simple and straightforward, he used a printed form and had two of his neighbors witness it. He left everything to a couple of AIDS charities.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what he told me he was going to do.\"\\n\\n \"Was he ever married?\"\\n\\n \"For about a year, right after he got out of school. Then they got divorced, or maybe it was an annulment. I think that\u0027s what it was.\"\\n\\n \"No children, I assume.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Any family?\"\\n\\n \"A broken home, and both parents were alcoholic.\"\\n\\n \"So he came by it honestly.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. They both died, his father many years ago and his mother sometime after he got sober. One brother, but nobody\u0027s heard from him in years, and Byron thought he was probably dead. There was another brother, and he\u0027d been dead for some years. Byron said he died of an esophageal rupture, so I guess he must have been an alcoholic, too.\"\\n\\n \"All happy families are alike,\" I said.\\n\\n \"God.\"\\n\\n \"Where do you figure the forty thousand came from? And it must have been more than that to start with, if he stopped working before last Christmas. Even if he started putting something aside each week when he sobered up, that\u0027s a lot of money to have saved in such a short amount of time.\"\\n\\n \"Life insurance.\"\\n\\n \"He was somebody\u0027s beneficiary?\"\\n\\n \"No, he had a policy on his own life. He took it out years ago because somebody convinced him it was a good investment.\"\\n\\n \"And maintained the coverage all those years?\"\\n\\n \"He said it was the luckiest thing that ever happened to him. There were stretches when he didn\u0027t have the money or he forgot to send in the premiums, but they were automatically paid by loans against the cash value. So when he got sober it was still in force, and he went on paying the premiums.\"\\n\\n \"Who was his beneficiary?\"\\n\\n \"I think it was probably his wife originally. Then for years he had his mother as beneficiary, and then when she died-\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, it\u0027s hard to get the words out. I didn\u0027t know it at the time, but as it happens he listed me as the beneficiary. I guess he had to put someone.\"\\n\\n \"You said you were close.\"\\n\\n \"Close,\" she said. \"You know how I found out? I had to be notified when he cashed in the policy. The company had a requirement to that effect, so there was a paper I had to sign. I didn\u0027t have to consent to it, but he was required to notify me.\"\\n\\n \"A lot of them have that rule,\" I said. \"In case the insured is required to maintain coverage, say as part of the terms of a divorce settlement.\"\\n\\n \"He was almost apologetic, Matt. \u0027I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re not going to be a rich lady after all, Ginnie. I\u0027m going to need the money myself.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"How much was the policy for?\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t a fortune. Seventy-five thousand dollars? Eighty? Under a hundred, anyway. I don\u0027t know how much he got for it.\"\\n\\n \"That would depend on the cash surrender value of the policy.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she said. \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t know anything about that. Whatever it was, it had to last him the rest of his life.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know much about it myself,\" I admitted, \"beyond the fact that it\u0027s based on what you\u0027ve paid in premiums over the years. You gradually build up a cash value for the policy, depending on the type of policy you\u0027ve got. With straight life you pay high premiums and your policy\u0027s cash value builds up gradually over time. With term coverage your premiums are lower but you don\u0027t build up any cash value. And there are some intermediate categories, too.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what kind he had.\"\\n\\n \"It couldn\u0027t have been term,\" I said, \"because you can\u0027t borrow against term insurance. That\u0027s how his coverage stayed in force when he stopped paying premiums.\"\\n\\n \"There were loans against the cash value, yes.\"\\n\\n \"So you said. Of course the cash value\u0027s reduced by any outstanding loans against the policy.\"\\n\\n \"He would have paid those back, though. Wouldn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"Not necessarily. The interest rates are very low, since what you\u0027re essentially doing is borrowing your own money. Say you\u0027ve borrowed a couple of thousand dollars that way. Why pay it back out of your own pocket? What\u0027s the incentive? If you just put it off they\u0027ll deduct whatever\u0027s outstanding from the death benefit when you die. Your beneficiary\u0027ll get less than he would otherwise, but you Won\u0027t be around to hear him whine about it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know how much Byron\u0027s loans amounted to,\" she said, \"or if he paid it back. I don\u0027t really know very much about life insurance.\"\\n\\n \"Neither do I.\"\\n\\n \"He probably had some other investments that he sold. Or I may have got the numbers wrong. I have a terrible memory for that sort of thing. Oh, and that reminds me. Did you say you were actually inside his apartment? You didn\u0027t happen to see a little brass elephant, did you?\"\\n\\n She\u0027d given it to him back when they were both getting sober. His memory had been unreliable then, as is not infrequently the case in early sobriety. He could never remember phone numbers, or where he put his keys. This is the elephant that never forgets, she\u0027d told him, and it had become a running gag between them.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to have it,\" she said. \"It\u0027s not worth anything, and it wouldn\u0027t mean a thing to anybody but me.\"\\n\\n \"It must have meant something to him,\" I said. \"He didn\u0027t have a lot in the way of knickknacks, and he gave it a place of honor on top of the TV. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s why I happened to notice it. The super told me to put it in my pocket.\"\\n\\n \"And did you?\"\\n\\n \"No, dammit, I put it back where I found it. It\u0027s funny, too, because I had the impulse to take it. I\u0027ll go back and get it.\"\\n\\n \"I hate to ask you to make a special trip.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m two blocks from his building,\" I said. \"It\u0027s no trouble at all.\"\\n\\n The hard part was finding the super. He was fixing a leaky faucet on the seventh floor, and it took the doorman awhile to track him down. This time I didn\u0027t linger long in Byron\u0027s apartment. It seemed to me that the scent of AIDS was more palpable on my second visit. There is a particular musky odor that seems to be associated with the disease. Earlier I\u0027d noticed it when I\u0027d looked in his closet-clothing holds the smell-but this time the entire apartment was full of it. I took the little elephant and left.\\n\\n 6\\n\\n Forty-eight hours later I\u0027d made two more visits to the Horatio Street apartment building. I\u0027d knocked on a lot of doors and talked to a great assortment of people. The police had already spoken to most if not all of them, but that didn\u0027t make them unwilling to talk to me, even if they didn\u0027t have much to tell me. Byron was a good neighbor, he mostly kept to himself, and as far as they knew he didn\u0027t have an enemy in the world. I heard a host of different theories about the killing, most of which had already occurred to me.\\n\\n Wednesday afternoon I met TJ and compared notes, and was not too surprised to learn that he wasn\u0027t doing any better than I was. \"Elaine wants me to work tomorrow,\" he said, \"but I told her I got to check with you first.\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead and mind the shop for her.\"\\n\\n \"What I thought. We gettin\u0027 noplace on the street.\"\\n\\n I rode the Eighth Avenue bus uptown and got off when it got mired in traffic around Fortieth Street. I walked the rest of the way home, and I was across the street in my office when Ray Gruliow called. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-11.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \\n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
