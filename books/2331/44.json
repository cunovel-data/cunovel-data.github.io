{"id":64276,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"\"Clear up a point for me,\" he said when she came over to our table. \"What\u0027s your order?\"\n \"You\u0027ve got it backwards. I\u0027m supposed to take your order.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to take your order, I just want to know what it is. Are you a Carmelite or are you one of the Little Sisters of the Poor?\" When she looked confused he said, \"I\u0027m just joking, honey. Don\u0027t mind me. I know you\u0027re new here, but they must have told you I\u0027m harmless.\"\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"I bet you\u0027re armed and dangerous.\"\n He grinned, delighted. \"Hey, you\u0027re okay,\" he said. \"You give as good as you get. I\u0027ll tell you what. Bring me another round, a double shot and a beer, but what you can do, you can make it two double shots, and two beers.\" My face must have shown something, because he said, \"Relax, Mattie. I know you wouldn\u0027t touch a drop to save your soul, you self-righteous fuck. And please pardon my French, sweetheart, and whatever you do don\u0027t tell your Mother Superior what I just said. I want you to bring me two rounds at once so we won\u0027t have to disturb you later, and you can also bring my sobersided father here whatever he\u0027s having.\"\n \"Club soda will be fine,\" I told her.\n \"Bring him two club sodas,\" he said, \"and the devil take the hindmost.\" She walked off, her cottontail bobbing, and he said, \"I don\u0027t know how I feel about silicone. They all look perfect but they don\u0027t look real. And what\u0027s the effect on the next generation? Do teenage boys grow up expecting perfect tits?\"\n \"When you\u0027re a teenage boy,\" I said, \"all tits are perfect.\"\n \"Not if all you ever see is silicone. Used to be girls would go out and get their tits done so they could get a guy. Now there\u0027s married men asking their wives to call the plastic surgeon, make an appointment. \u0027What do I want for Christmas, Mona? Well, now that you mention it, big knockers\u0027d be nice.\u0027 Make sense to you?\"\n \"Hardly anything does,\" I said.\n \"Amen to that, brother.\"\n \"And yet you come here,\" I said.\n \"I like tawdry,\" he said, \"and I like tacky, and I have a passion for paradox. And, even though I barely look at the tits, it\u0027s nice to know they\u0027re there if I get the urge. Plus this place is three blocks from the fucking office and yet no one from the paper would be caught dead here, so I don\u0027t get disturbed. That\u0027s my story, Monsieur Poirot. Now what\u0027s your excuse?\"\n \"I came here to see you.\"\n She brought the drinks. \"On my tab,\" he said, and gave her a five-dollar tip. \"I\u0027m a class guy,\" he said. \"You notice I just gave her the money. I didn\u0027t try to stuff it down the front of her spandex shorts, as I\u0027ve seen some of the customers do. I more or less assumed you came here to see me, O Great Detective. What I wondered is why.\"\n \"To see what you could tell me about Will.\"\n \"Ah, I see. You want the hat trick.\"\n \"How\u0027s that?\"\n \"You unmasked one killer and brought another back alive. What\u0027s it like in Lakewood, Ohio, anyway? Do the natives wear shoes?\"\n \"For the most part.\"\n \"Glad to hear it. You got Adrian, you got this Havemeyer, and now you want Will Number Two. Adrian\u0027s understudy, if you want to stay with the theatrical image Regis invoked so nicely in his oped piece.\" His eyes widened. \"Wait a minute,\" he said.\n \"Havemeyer\u0027s first name is William, isn\u0027t it? What do they call him?\"\n \"When I called him anything,\" I said, \"it was Mr. Havemeyer.\"\n \"So it could be Bill or Willie. Or even Will.\"\n \"It could be anything at all,\" I said. \"I told you what I called him.\"\n \"I thought cops always call perps by their first names.\"\n \"I guess I\u0027ve been off the job too long.\"\n \"Yeah, you\u0027ve turned respectful. It\u0027s good you\u0027re not still wearing the uniform or you\u0027d be a disgrace to it. If they call him Will, and who\u0027s to say they don\u0027t, that\u0027d be the hat trick all right, wouldn\u0027t it? Three guys named Will, and Mattie gets \u0027em all.\"\n \"I\u0027m not chasing Will Number Two.\"\n \"You\u0027re not?\"\n I shook my head. \"I\u0027m just your average concerned citizen,\" I said. \"All I know is what I read in the papers.\"\n \"You and Will Rogers.\"\n \"And I was wondering what you might know that they\u0027re not reporting. For instance, has there been another letter from the guy?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"He always sent a letter after each killing. Like a terrorist group claiming credit for a bombing.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"It\u0027s surprising he\u0027d break the pattern.\"\n He rolled his eyes. \"It\u0027s Adrian\u0027s pattern,\" he said, \"and Adrian\u0027s not writing letters these days. Why expect the new guy to operate, the same way?\"\n \"That\u0027s a point.\"\n \"Adrian didn\u0027t threaten three guys at once, either. There\u0027s a lot of differences between them, including the psychological gobbledygook everybody\u0027s been spouting.\" He had already thrown down one double shot, and now he took a dainty sip of the other and chased it with an equally dainty sip of beer. \"That\u0027s why I wrote what I did,\" he said.\n \"The column where you taunted him?\"\n \"Uh-huh. I don\u0027t know. One day I was annoyed the way everybody else was calling him a paper tiger, and next thing I knew I was trying to bait him.\"\n \"I was wondering about that.\"\n \"I decided they were right,\" he said, \"and I decided the guy was never gonna do anything, and I got the bright idea that if I stuck something through the bars of his cage and poked him he\u0027d at least roar, and maybe that would give the cops something to go on. And I knew it was safe to provoke him because he wasn\u0027t about to get out of the cage.\"\n \"But he did.\"\n \"Yeah. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s my fault, because fucking Kilbourne was pretty provocative himself, telling Will to strike the set and get his ass off the stage. But I don\u0027t mind telling you it\u0027s pretty much ended my interest in the matter.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"I\u0027m glad I haven\u0027t had another I-shot-the-sheriff letter from the son of a bitch. If he writes any more letters I hope he mails them to somebody else. I don\u0027t think he will, and I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll kill anybody else, either, although I\u0027m not about to suggest they quit guarding Peter Tully and Judge Rome. But the point is I\u0027m walking away from it. I can find other things to write about.\"\n \"It\u0027s not hard in this town.\"\n \"Not hard at all.\"\n I took a long drink of club soda. Out of the corner of my eye I watched our waitress take an order from a table of new arrivals, three men in their early thirties dressed in jackets and ties. One of them was stroking her bottom and patting her cottontail. She didn\u0027t even seem to notice.\n I said, \"Maybe I shouldn\u0027t even bring this up,\" I said, \"considering your lack of interest. But I wanted your input.\"\n \"Go ahead.\"\n I dug out my notebook, flipped it open. \" \u0027My curse upon the withered hand that grips my nation\u0027s throat.\u0027 \"\n He froze with the glass halfway to his lips, screwed up his face in a frown. \"What the hell is that?\"\n \"Sound familiar?\"\n \"It does but I can\u0027t think why. Help me out here, Mattie.\"\n \"The first letter from Will Number Two, where he shared his little three-name list with us.\"\n \"That\u0027s right,\" he said. \"He was going on about Peter Tully, right after that crap about chucking a wrench into the machinery of the city, or whatever the hell it was. So?\"\n \"Except he had it a little different. \u0027A curse upon the withered hand that grips a city\u0027s throat.\u0027 A curse instead of my curse, and a city instead of my nation.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"So Will was paraphrasing the original.\"\n \"What original?\" He frowned again, and then drew back his head and looked at me. \"Wait a minute,\" he said.\n \"Take all the time you want, Marty.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be sweetly and resoundingly fucked,\" he said. \"You know who the cocksucker was quoting?\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"Me,\" he said, eyebrows raised high in indignation. \"He was quoting me. Or paraphrasing me, or whatever the hell you want to call it.\"\n \"No kidding?\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t know it,\" he said, \"because nobody knows it, but once upon a time I had the bad taste and ill fortune to write a play.\"\n \"The Tumult in the Clouds.\"\n \"My God, how would you know that? It\u0027s from Yeats, the poem\u0027s \u0027An Irish Airman Foresees His Death.\u0027 Sweet Christ, it was awful.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure it was better than that.\"\n \"No, it was a stinker, and you don\u0027t have to take my word for it. The reviews showed rare unanimity of opinion on that subject. Nobody objected to the title, though, even though it had nothing to do with flying. There was plenty of tumult, however. Short on clouds, long on tumult. But it was Irish as all getout, my heartfelt autobiographical take on the Irish-American experience, and nothing gets an Irish book or play off to a better start than a title from Yeats. It\u0027s good the old boy wrote a lot.\"\n \"And the line\u0027s from your play?\"\n \"The line?\"\n \"The one about the withered hand and the nation\u0027s throat.\"\n \"Oh, that Will did a turn on. In the play the withered hand was Queen Victoria\u0027s, if I remember correctly. And the throat was that of Holy Ireland, you\u0027ll be unsurprised to learn. It was a tinker woman who delivered the line. Mother of Mercy, what did I know about tinker women? Or Ireland either, for that matter. I\u0027ve never been to the poor benighted country, and never want to go, either.\"\n \"You\u0027re pretty good,\" I said.\n \"How\u0027s that, Mattie?\"\n \"Not recognizing the line at first. Then realizing that I must know where it\u0027s from, and deciding to come up with it first yourself. And pretending that you\u0027re unaware that I know where the line\u0027s from, but how could you be? Because how would I know the original line if I didn\u0027t know about the play?\"\n \"Hey, you lost me around the clubhouse turn.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n He hefted his glass. \"You sober sons of bitches,\" he said, \"you just don\u0027t understand how this stuff slows down the thought processes. You want to go over that again? You must have known because I had to know because you knew because I said you said-you see what I mean, Mattie? It\u0027s confusing.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"So do you want to run it by me one more time?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"Hey, suit yourself. You\u0027re the one brought it up, so-\"\n \"Give it up, Marty.\"\n \"How\u0027s that?\"\n \"I know you did it. You wrote the letters and you killed Regis Kilbourne.\"\n \"That\u0027s fucking nuts.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"Why would I do any of that? You want to tell me that?\"\n \"You wrote the letters to stay in the limelight.\"\n \"Me? You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\n \"Will made you really important,\" I said. \"You wrote a column and the next thing anybody knew a killer was knocking off prominent people all over New York.\"\n \"And Omaha. Don\u0027t forget Omaha.\"\n \"Then Will killed himself, and it turned out the Wizard of Oz was just the little man behind the curtain. He was Adrian Whitfield, and he wasn\u0027t larger than life anymore. There was no more story, and that meant no more front-page headlines for you. And you couldn\u0027t stand that.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-44.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
