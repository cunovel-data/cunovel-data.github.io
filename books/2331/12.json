I\u0027ve come a long ways since then in certain respects, but geography is not one of them. The Pare Vendome, where Elaine and I have our apartment, is on the downtown side of Fifty-seventh, directly across from the hotel. I kept my room when we moved in together, telling myself I\u0027d use it as an office. I can\u0027t say it gets much use. It\u0027s no place to meet clients, and the records I keep there would fit easily in a closet or cupboard across the street.\n \"Adrian Whitfield,\" Ray Gruliow said. \"I ran into him downtown earlier today. As a matter of fact I found myself at loose ends, so I sat down and watched him at work. He\u0027s trying a case, as I\u0027m sure you know.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t spoken to him in a couple of days,\" I said. \"How\u0027s he holding up?\"\n \"He doesn\u0027t look so hot,\" he said, \"but it could be that he\u0027s just plain exhausted. I can\u0027t turn on my television set without seeing him. If they\u0027re not sticking a mike in front of his face outside of the Criminal Courts Building, they\u0027ve got him in a TV studio somewhere. He was on Larry King last night, doing a remote from their New York studio.\"\n \"What did he talk about?\"\n \"Moral aspects of the adversary system of criminal justice. To what lengths can a lawyer go, and to what extent do we hold him accountable? It was starting to get interesting, but then they took questions from listeners, and that always reduces everything to the lowest common denominator, which is generally pretty low.\"\n \"And dreadfully common.\"\n \"All the same, he was hell on wheels in court this morning. You know what Samuel Johnson said. \u0027When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\u0027 \"\n \"Great line.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m surprised the capital punishment people haven\u0027t dragged it out as evidence of the efficacy of their panacea for the world\u0027s ills.\"\n \"I hope you\u0027re not getting ready to make a speech.\"\n \"No, but I might haul out Dr. Johnson next time I do. Our boy Adrian seemed pretty well bodyguarded. Your doing, I understand.\"\n \"Not really. I made a couple of strategic suggestions and gave him a number to call.\"\n \"He says he\u0027s wearing body armor.\"\n \"He\u0027s supposed to be,\" I said, \"and I wish he\u0027d keep his mouth shut about it. If a shooter knows you\u0027re wearing it, he\u0027ll go for a head shot instead.\"\n \"Well, Will\u0027s not going to hear it from me. Of course, we don\u0027t know who Will is, do we?\"\n \"If we did,\" I said, \"he\u0027d cease to be a problem.\"\n \"For all you know,\" he said, \"I could be Will myself.\"\n \"Hmmm. No, I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"What makes you so sure?\"\n \"His letters,\" I said. \"They\u0027re too elegantly phrased.\"\n \"You son of a bitch. He does have a way with words, though, doesn\u0027t he?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Almost makes a man want to get a letter from him. Here\u0027s something I\u0027m not proud of. You know my immediate reaction when I saw the open letter to Adrian?\"\n \"You figured it should have been you.\"\n \"Now how the hell did you know that? Or am I more transparent than I ever thought?\"\n \"Well, what else would you be ashamed of?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t say I was ashamed. I said I wasn\u0027t proud of it.\"\n \"I stand corrected.\"\n \"It\u0027s true, though. You remember how many actors it takes to change a light bulb?\"\n \"I heard it but I forget.\"\n \"Five. One to climb the ladder and four to say \u0027That should be me up there!\u0027 Trial lawyers aren\u0027t all that different. In this case, my friend, you could say I\u0027ve been auditioning for the part my whole professional career. Who\u0027s the most hated man in New York?\"\n \"Walter O\u0027Malley.\"\n \"Walter O\u0027Malley? Who the hell… oh, the cocksucker who moved the Dodgers out of Brooklyn. He\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t he?\"\n \"I certainly hope so.\"\n \"You\u0027re an unforgiving son of a bitch, aren\u0027t you? Forget Walter O\u0027Malley. Who\u0027s the most hated lawyer in New York?\"\n \"If that\u0027s another joke, the answer is they all are.\"\n \"The answer, as you well know, is Raymond Gruliow.\"\n \"Hard-Way Ray.\"\n \"You said it. I\u0027m the one with the most loathsome clients, the ones you love to hate. Wasn\u0027t it Will Rogers who said he never met a man he didn\u0027t like?\"\n \"Whoever it was, I\u0027d say he didn\u0027t get out much.\"\n \"And he never met my list of clients. Arab terrorists, black radicals, psychotic mass murderers. Warren Madison, who only shot half a dozen New York police officers. Who did Whitfield ever defend who can compare to Warren Madison?\"\n \"Richie Vollmer,\" I said. \"For openers.\"\n \"Warren Madison\u0027s as bad as Richie Vollmer. You blame the system for Vollmer\u0027s acquittal. For Warren, you have to blame the lawyer.\"\n \" \u0027He said humbly.\u0027 \"\n \"Forget humble. Humility\u0027s no asset in this line of work. You know the Chinese curse, my friend? \u0027May you be represented by a humble attorney.\u0027 You think our friend Adrian\u0027s going to be all right?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Will\u0027s taking his time. This is the longest he\u0027s let it slide, isn\u0027t it? Between the open letter and the payoff. Maybe it\u0027s because Adrian\u0027s better protected, harder to get to.\"\n \"Maybe.\"\n \"Or he could be tired of the game. Or for all we know he could have stepped in front of a bus.\"\n \"Or he could have been sitting on a park bench,\" I said, \"and somebody could have shot him by mistake.\"\n \"Somebody who didn\u0027t even know who he was.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Why not indeed? You\u0027re not thinking about that friend of a friend you mentioned, guy got gunned down on Horatio Street.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s probably where the park bench came from,\" I admitted, \"but I think we can safely rule out Byron Leopold. It was a full day\u0027s work for him to walk across the street and pick out a bench to sit on.\"\n \"So you\u0027ve made a little progress, my friend. You\u0027ve ruled one man out.\"\n \"I\u0027ve ruled you out, too.\"\n \"Decent of you.\"\n \"And myself,\" I said, \"because if I was Will I\u0027d remember. And Elaine, because if she\u0027d done anything like that I\u0027m sure she would have told me.\"\n \"Because the two of you have an open and honest relationship.\"\n \"Absolutely,\" I said. \"And Marty McGraw.\"\n \"What kind of a relationship have you got with him?\"\n \"None,\" I said, \"but I ruled him out. He was addressing a dinner of Police Athletic League supporters while Will was taking out Patsy Salerno up in the Bronx, and he was right here in New York when Roswell Berry got his in Omaha.\"\n \"Aborted in the fourth trimester,\" Ray said. \"He mention this in a column? I must have missed it.\"\n \"I checked him out myself.\"\n \"Seriously?\"\n \"Adrian said something about Marty wanting an exclusive interview,\" I said, \"and in the next breath explained he\u0027d wanted to do it over the phone, not face to face. But that put the idea in my head. I figured the police would have checked him out six different ways, but I couldn\u0027t see how it would hurt to see for myself.\"\n \"The whole business has been good for McGraw, hasn\u0027t it? I can see how he\u0027d want to keep the pot bubbling. But he didn\u0027t do it.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid not.\"\n \"And neither did you or I or Elaine, or all the guys recovering from bypass surgery. Or your friend who got shot, but it could have been somebody else who got shot or stabbed or fell off a building. Will, the world\u0027s foremost anonymous killer, could have been iced by somebody who didn\u0027t even know who he was.\"\n \"There\u0027s irony for you.\"\n \"He could have died some kind of anonymous death, and we\u0027ll never know who he was. Be a hell of a thing for Adrian, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\n \"How do you figure that? He\u0027d be off the hook.\"\n \"Think about it.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"You\u0027re only off the hook if you know you\u0027re off the hook,\" he said. \"How long before you let the bodyguards go? How much longer before you can really relax?\"\n I thought about Whitfield, and after dinner I gave him a call. I left a message on his machine. It was nothing urgent, I said, and evidently he took me at my word, because I didn\u0027t hear from him.\n I saw him on the late news, though. There\u0027d been no developments, but that wouldn\u0027t stop them from pressing him for comments. It was the same principle that kept Will\u0027s name on the front page of the Post.\n He was on the news again the following evening, but this time there was a story to go with it. His trial, due to go to the jury in a week to ten days, had been abruptly settled, with his client agreeing to plead to a lesser charge.\n I went to a meeting at St. Paul\u0027s. I was still carrying the little elephant around with me, and Ginnie showed up so I gave it to her. I was going to leave on the break but I\u0027d been doing that a lot lately, so I made myself stay to the bitter end. It must have been around ten-thirty when I got home, and I was pouring a cup of coffee when the phone rang.\n \"Matthew Scudder,\" he said. \"Adrian Whitfield.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad you called,\" I said. \"I saw you a couple of hours ago on the news.\"\n \"Which channel?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, I was watching two or three of them at once.\"\n \"Channel surfing, eh? A popular indoor sport. Well, I think we\u0027d have won if it went to the jury, but I couldn\u0027t advise my client to roll the dice. He\u0027s essentially getting off with time served, and suppose the jury should wind up seeing it the wrong way?\"\n \"And there\u0027s always that chance.\"\n \"Always. You never know what they\u0027re going to do. You may think you know, but you can never be sure. I thought they were going to convict Richie Vollmer.\"\n \"How could they? The judge\u0027s instructions ruled that out.\"\n \"Yes, but he stopped short of a directed verdict of acquittal. They wanted to convict, and more often than not a jury will do what it wants to do.\"\n \"A conviction wouldn\u0027t have stood up.\"\n \"Oh, no way. Judge Yancey could very easily have thrown it out on the spot. If he\u0027d let it stand I\u0027d have knocked it out on appeal.\"\n \"So Richie was going free no matter what they did.\"\n \"Well, not right away. What I thought would happen-do you want to hear all this?\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"I thought Yancey would let it stand, knowing the appeals court would reverse it. That way he wouldn\u0027t be the man who put Richie on the street. And I thought Richie\u0027d go off to prison, where some public-spirited psychopath would kill him before his appeal could go through. Like the fellow in Wisconsin. Well, it amounts to about the same thing, doesn\u0027t it? Except the psychopath who actually did kill Richie isn\u0027t a convict, and it turns out he\u0027s a serial killer himself.\"\n \"How are you holding up, Adrian?\"\n \"Oh, I\u0027m all right,\" he said. \"It takes some of the pressure off to know I don\u0027t have to go to court tomorrow. At the same time there\u0027s the bittersweet feeling you get whenever something ends. A trial, a love affair, even a bad marriage. You may be glad it\u0027s over, but at the same time you\u0027re a little bit sorry.\" His voice trailed off. Then he said, \"Well, nothing lasts forever, right? What goes up comes down, what starts stops. That\u0027s the way it\u0027s supposed to be.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-12.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
