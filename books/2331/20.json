{"id":64252,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"For now, though, I chose not to exercise that freedom. Now and then I felt the urge, even as once in a while I felt the desire for a drink. There is, I have been taught, all the difference in the world between the desire and the act. The one is written on water, the other carved in stone.\n Glenn Holtzmann.\n Unaccountably pleased with myself for having resisted the slenderest of temptations, I marched east on Fifty-seventh and got almost to the corner of Ninth Avenue before the penny dropped. I had been dreaming a dream which I was somehow certain had some bearing on Adrian Whitfield\u0027s murder, and Elaine had somehow managed to coax and tease the subject of that dream out of some dark corner of my mind. It was Glenn Holtzmann I\u0027d dreamed about, and I\u0027d stood staring at the building he\u0027d lived in without making the connection.\n Glenn Holtzmann. Why was he disturbing my sleep, and what could he possibly be trying to tell me? I\u0027d hardly had time to consider the point when Will\u0027s latest letter drove the question clear out of my mind.\n I stopped at the Morning Star and sat at a window table with a cup of coffee. I took a sip and remembered one of the few meetings I\u0027d had with Holtzmann. I\u0027d been sitting in that very window, and perhaps at that very table, when he\u0027d tapped on the glass to get my attention, then came inside and shared my table for a few minutes.\n He\u0027d wanted to be friends. Elaine and I had spent one evening with him and Lisa, and I hadn\u0027t liked him much. There was something off-putting about him, though I\u0027d have had trouble defining it. I couldn\u0027t recall everything he\u0027d said that time at the Morning Star, although it seemed to me that was when he\u0027d informed me that Lisa had had a miscarriage. I\u0027d felt sympathy for him then, but it hadn\u0027t made me want his friendship.\n Not too long after that he was dead. Shot down on Eleventh Avenue while making a call from a pay phone. That had been a case of mine, and in its course, oddly enough, I\u0027d found myself working for the brother of the chief suspect and the widow of the victim. I don\u0027t know how well I served either client, but by the time it was over I\u0027d learned who killed Glenn Holtzmann. (It turned out he\u0027d been killed by mistake, in what Elaine characterized as a perfect postmodern homicide. I\u0027m not sure what she meant.)\n Glenn Holtzmann, Glenn Holtzmann. He was a lawyer, in-house counsel for a publisher of large-print books. He\u0027d floated the idea of my writing a book based on my experiences, but I\u0027d been no more likely to write such a book than his firm would have been to publish it. He\u0027d been on a fishing expedition, perhaps in the hope that I\u0027d drop some kernel of information that might prove profitable for him.\n Because, as I was to learn, information meant profit to Holtzmann. He\u0027d supplemented his income nicely as a bearer of tales, getting his start when he ratted out his uncle to the IRS. It was a profitable enterprise, if high in risk and low in prestige, and when he died on the sidewalk on Eleventh Avenue he left behind a two-bedroom high-rise apartment to which he had clear title and a metal strongbox in which he\u0027d stowed something like $300,000 in cash.\n Why the hell was I dreaming about him? I let the waiter refill my coffee cup, stirred it, stared out the window at my own apartment building, and tried to free-associate. Glenn Holtzmann. Lawyer. Publisher. Large-print. Failing vision. White cane, tap tap tap…\n Glenn Holtzmann. Blackmail. Except it wasn\u0027t blackmail, not so far as I knew. He wasn\u0027t a blackmailer, he was an informer, a paid informer…\n Glenn Holtzmann. Lisa. Legs, tits, ass. Stop it.\n Glenn Holtzmann. Closet. Strongbox. Money. Too much money.\n I sat up straight.\n Too much money.\n The phrase rang like a bell. Glenn Holtzmann had had too much money, and that was what had made his death look like something other than the act of random violence it appeared to be. It was the money that led his wife to call me, and it was the money that started me looking beneath the ordinary surface of his life for something that might explain his death.\n I closed my eyes and tried to conjure up his face. I couldn\u0027t bring the image into focus.\n Too much money. What the hell did that have to do with Will? How could there be a money motive behind the murders? How, really, could there be any kind of motive for the killings, behind the particular mania which led the man to perceive himself as a righter of social wrongs?\n Did anybody benefit from the deaths, singly or collectively? I considered the victims in turn. Richie Vollmer\u0027s death was good news for whatever children he would have otherwise gone on to kill, but they couldn\u0027t know who they were. It was, I suppose, good news as well for all the rest of us, who were spared having to go on sharing a planet with Richie. But nobody made a dime out of his death, except the people with newspapers to sell. Richie died with nothing to leave and nobody to leave it to.\n Patsy Salerno? Well, if you took a prominent mob guy off the board, it had to be good news to whoever wound up in his shoes. This particular fact of economic life had led the boys to kill each other right and left over the years, and it still applied even when someone else did the killing. But Patsy hadn\u0027t been on anybody else\u0027s list before he wound up on Will\u0027s, and when did his kind of people ever try to make their all-in-the-family hits look like somebody else\u0027s doing? For God\u0027s sake, they all but signed their work.\n I didn\u0027t do any better with the rest of Will\u0027s list. I was willing to believe that somebody was making a dollar or two out of the anti-abortion movement, even as I supposed somebody had to be turning a buck on the other side, but I couldn\u0027t see a big financial payoff in wrapping a coat hanger around Roswell Berry\u0027s neck. Somebody was richer for Julian Rashid\u0027s death, though I didn\u0027t know how or how much, but that particular case was cleared and Will hadn\u0027t done the killing, although he\u0027d have gotten around to it if Scipio hadn\u0027t beaten him to the punch.\n And Adrian Whitfield? No, and I was back to square one. Money\u0027s at the root of a lot of evil, but by no means all of it. Will, whoever he might be, wasn\u0027t getting rich off his actions. He wasn\u0027t even covering expenses-which, while not too considerable, had to include airfare to and from Omaha, along with whatever he\u0027d had to lay out for rope and wire and cyanide. (I figured the coat hanger couldn\u0027t have cost him much.)\n Once they caught him, one or more true-crime writers would publish books on the case, and just how fat they\u0027d get on it would depend on how sensational the material was and how strong a hold Will still had on the public imagination. Until then, a lot of print and broadcast journalists were earning their salaries with Will\u0027s help, but without him they\u0027d bring home the same money reporting on somebody else\u0027s misdeeds. Marty McGraw was on the top of the heap, glorying in his role in a story that was bigger than Bosnia, but his pay envelope hadn\u0027t gotten any thicker since Will went to work, and maybe he didn\u0027t care. All those moves from paper to paper had boosted his salary way up there already, and how much money did he need? You couldn\u0027t spend that much on blended whiskey, even if the girls who brought it to you didn\u0027t have shirts on.\n Too much money. That struck me as the ultimate irrelevance, because Will looked to be a pure idealist, however misguided. It was frustrating-I\u0027d managed to remember who it was I\u0027d dreamed about, and I\u0027d ferreted out the message the dream had for me, and it didn\u0027t mean anything.\n Well, why should it? A friend of Elaine\u0027s had attended a sйance, in the course of which a dead uncle of hers had counseled her to buy a particular over-the-counter computer stock. She\u0027d risked a couple of thousand dollars, whereupon the stock plummeted.\n Elaine had not been surprised. \"I\u0027m not saying it wasn\u0027t her Uncle Manny that spoke to her,\" she said, \"but when he was alive nobody ever called him the Wizard of Wall Street. He was a furrier, so why should he suddenly be a financial genius now that he\u0027s dead? Where is it written that death raises your IQ?\"\n Same goes for dreaming. Just because the subconscious mind sends a cryptic message doesn\u0027t mean it knows what it\u0027s talking about.\n Too much money. Maybe Glenn Holtzmann was talking to me, maybe he thought I should spread the wealth around. Well, a word to the wise and all that. I paid for my coffee, and left the waiter twice as much as usual. Matt Scudder, last of the big spenders.\n After dinner that night I watched a little television with Elaine. There were a couple of cop shows on back to back, and I kept finding fault with their investigative procedure. Elaine had to remind me that it was only TV.\n After the news at eleven I stood up and stretched. \"I think I\u0027ll go out for a while,\" I said.\n \"Give Mick my love.\"\n \"How do you know I\u0027m not going to the midnight meeting?\"\n \"How do you know you won\u0027t run into him there?\"\n \"Do Jewish girls always answer a question with a question?\"\n \"Is there something wrong with that?\"\n I walked south and west to Grogan\u0027s Open House, a Hell\u0027s Kitchen bar stubbornly holding its own in the face of neighborhood gentrification. Now and then a salesman will walk in and ask to speak to Grogan, which is a little like asking for Mr. Stone at the Blarney Stone. \u0027There\u0027s no such person,\" I heard the day barman tell one such visitor. \"And for all that, he\u0027s not in at the moment.\"\n Grogan\u0027s is the home turf of one Michael Ballou, although you won\u0027t find his name on the license or the deed. His criminal record would preclude his owning premises where liquor is sold, but Mick has extended the principle of nonownership to all areas of his life. Another man\u0027s name appears on the ownership papers for his car, and the deed to his farm in Sullivan County. What a man takes care not to own, I have heard him say, they cannot take away from him.\n We met some years ago when I walked into Grogan\u0027s and asked him some questions, feeling a little like Daniel in the lion\u0027s den. That was the start of our unlikely friendship, and it has broadened and deepened over time. We are two men of very different backgrounds leading vastly different lives, and I have ceased to grope for an explanation of the satisfaction we find in each other\u0027s company. He is a killer and a career criminal, and he is my friend, and you can make what you will of that. I don\u0027t know what to make of it myself.\n Sometimes we make a long night of it, sitting up past closing with the door locked and all but one of the lights out, sharing stories and silences until dawn. Sometimes he\u0027ll finish up at the early mass at St. Bernard\u0027s on West Fourteenth Street, the Butchers\u0027 Mass, where he\u0027ll wear his late father\u0027s stained white apron and match the meat cutters who come there before they start work in the market down the street. Now and then I\u0027ve stayed the course and gone with him, kneeling when they kneel, rising when they rise.\n Male bonding, I guess they call it. Guy stuff, according to Elaine.\n This was an early night, and I was out of there and on my way home well before closing. I don\u0027t remember too much of what we talked about, but it seems to me the conversation rambled all over the place. I know we talked about dreams, and he recalled a dream that had saved his life, alerting him to a danger of which he\u0027d been unaware.\n I said I supposed a dream was when you knew something on an unconscious level, and it came bubbling up to your consciousness. Sometimes it was that, he agreed, and sometimes it was one of God\u0027s angels whispering in your ear. I was not certain whether he was speaking metaphorically. He is a singular mix of brutal practicality and Celtic mysticism. His mother once told him he had the second sight, and he accordingly places more faith in feelings and hunches than you might expect. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-20.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
