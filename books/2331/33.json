{"id":64265,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"They were all going to carry on bravely, but that didn\u0027t mean they were ready to make Will\u0027s work easier for him. Peter Tully declined police protection but went about guarded by a thuggish phalanx of husky well-armed union members. Judge Rome accepted the NYPD\u0027s offer and supplemented their ranks with some additional cops he hired as moonlighters. (This struck some people as curious, and a Post reporter quoted an unnamed source: \"If Will really wants to kill Harold Rome, odds are he\u0027s a cop himself.\") Regis Kilbourne also took the police protection, and, at each of the openings and previews he attended, his companion was not one of the dewy-eyed and pouting young women he favored, but a burly plainclothes cop with a five o\u0027clock shadow and an expression of bored bemusement.\\n\\n Will\u0027s letter, targeting three prominent New Yorkers at once, would have been enough all by itself to keep the story hot for a week or more. Long before it had a chance to die down, McGraw broke the news that Adrian Whitfield, already famous as Will\u0027s most recent victim, had now been definitely determined by police investigators to have been Will himself. (One of the TV news shows hit the air with a news flash hours before the Daily News was on the street with it, but Marty was the first to have all the details.)\\n\\n While nobody knew quite what to make of it, everybody remained determined to make the most of it. I\u0027d hoped the cops would keep me out of it, and they may have done what they could, but there was just too much media attention for anyone to slip by unnoticed. After the first phone call we learned to let the answering machine screen everything. I took to leaving my building via the service entrance, which kept to a minimum the number of reporters who caught up with me. I had to enter through the lobby, however, and that was when they were apt to corner me, sometimes with microphones and cameras, sometimes with notebooks. I was poor fodder for either medium, though, shouldering wordlessly past them, giving them nothing, not even a smile or a frown.\\n\\n I saw myself on TV one evening. I was visible for less time than it took an off-camera voice to identify me as the Manhattan-based private detective, formerly employed by Adrian Whitfield, whose investigation into his client\u0027s death had led to Whitfield\u0027s unmasking. \"It\u0027s great,\" Elaine said. \"You could very easily look angry or impatient or guilty or embarrassed, the way people do when they won\u0027t talk to the press. But instead you manage to look sort of harried and oblivious, like a man trying to get off a crowded subway car before they close the doors.\"\\n\\n I\u0027ve been in the limelight before over the years, though it\u0027s never shined that brightly on me, nor have I basked in it for very long. I\u0027ve never cared for it and I didn\u0027t like it any better this time around. Fortunately it didn\u0027t seem to affect me much. A few people at AA meetings made veiled reference to my momentary fame. \"I\u0027ve been reading about you in the papers,\" they might say, or, \"Saw you on TV the other night.\" I would deflect the remark with a smile and a shrug, and nobody pursued the subject. The greater portion of my AA acquaintances couldn\u0027t make a connection between the PI named Scudder who\u0027d unmasked Will and that guy Matt who usually sat in the back row. They might know my story, but relatively few of them knew my last name. AA is like that.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t stay that hot for that long, perhaps because I managed to avoid adding any fuel to the fire myself. The press didn\u0027t need me to build the case against Adrian Whitfield, which got a little stronger and solider day by day. If there\u0027d been room for doubt, the police kept finding bits of hard evidence to fill it in. Airline and hotel employees had ID\u0027d his photo, and NYNEX records had turned up some calls that didn\u0027t admit to a more innocent explanation, including two to a residential hotel on upper Broadway. There was no way to guess what hotel guest he\u0027d talked to, but Richie Vollmer had been living there, registered under an alias, and both calls were logged the day before Richie\u0027s death.\\n\\n The clearer it became that Adrian was the original Will, the murkier the waters grew around Will #2. A whole string of deaths had given the first Will a grim credibility. A threat, after all, has a certain undeniable authority when it\u0027s uttered by a man with blood on his hands.\\n\\n But when the threat comes from a copycat, and when everybody damn well knows he\u0027s a copycat, how much weight do you attach to it? That was a question that was getting asked a lot, on TV and in the papers, and I can only assume the police were asking it themselves. As far as anyone could tell, the man (or woman, for all anyone knew) who\u0027d written out a death sentence for the unlikely partnership of Tully, Rome \u0026 Kilbourne had never killed anything but time. That being the case, how much of a danger was he? And what did you do about it?\\n\\n You had to do something. They still empty schools and office buildings when some joker phones in a bomb threat, even when they know it\u0027s almost certainly a hoax. The fire engines roll when the alarm goes off, the fact notwithstanding that most calls turn out to be false alarms. (The NYFD started taking down most of their red streetcorner call boxes when statistics showed that virtually all alarms called in from the street were the work of pranksters. But they had to physically dismantle the boxes. They couldn\u0027t leave them standing and ignore the alarms.)\\n\\n Meanwhile, everybody waited to see what would happen next. The three men named in Will\u0027s letter probably waited with a little more urgency than the rest of the public, but even they probably found themselves paying a little less attention as the days passed and nothing untoward took place.\\n\\n Like Benny the Suitcase, bored to tears with the job of starting Tony Furillo\u0027s car every morning. Complaining that nothing ever happened.\\n\\n One day I caught a noon meeting at the Citicorp building and spent an hour or two in the stores, trying to get an early start on my Christmas shopping. I didn\u0027t find a thing to buy, and I just wound up feeling overwhelmed by the season.\\n\\n It happens every year. Even before the Salvation Army Santas can get out there and start competing with the homeless for handouts, I find myself haunted by all the ghosts of Christmas past.\\n\\n I\u0027ve largely come to terms with the failure of my first marriage, with my shortcomings as a husband and a father. \"Clearing up the wreckage of the past\" is what they call that ritual in AA, and it\u0027s a process you neglect at your peril.\\n\\n I\u0027d done all that, making amends, forgiving others and forgiving myself, systematically laying the ghosts of my own history. I didn\u0027t rush into it the way some people do, but I kept working at it over time. There was a series of long talks with my sponsor, a lot of soul-searching, plenty of thought and a certain amount of action. And I would have to say it worked. Here was something that had haunted me for years, and now it doesn\u0027t.\\n\\n Except when it does, and that is most apt to happen around the time November starts to bleed into December. The days get shorter and shorter, the sun gives less and less light, and I start to remember every present I didn\u0027t get around to buying, every argument I ever had, every nasty remark I ever made, and every night I found a reason to stay in the city instead of hauling my sad ass home to Syosset.\\n\\n So when I\u0027d walked home from my failed shopping spree I went not to the Parc Vendфme but to the hotel across the street. I told myself I couldn\u0027t face a media gauntlet in the lobby, but in fact I had no reason to expect to encounter one. The reporters had understandably lost interest in the fellow who walked through them as if he was trying to get off the subway.\\n\\n I said hello to Jacob behind the desk and exchanged nods with a fellow who spends most of his waking hours in the Northwestern\u0027s faded lobby. The poor bastard moved into the hotel years before I did, and sooner or later he\u0027ll die there. I don\u0027t suppose he stands much chance of marrying a beautiful woman and moving across the street.\\n\\n I went up to my room. I put the TV on, took a quick tour of the channels, and switched it off again. I pulled a chair over to the window and sat there, looking out at everything and nothing.\\n\\n After a while I picked up the phone, made a call. Jim Faber answered the phone himself, saying \"Faber Printing\" in the gruff voice in which I have come to find considerable reassurance over the years. It was good to hear his voice now, and I said as much.\\n\\n \"Matter of fact,\" I said, \"just dialing your number made me feel better.\"\\n\\n \"Well, hell,\" he said. \"I can remember times I\u0027d be getting to the bar for the first one of the day, and really needing it. You know, feeling like I was going to jump right out of my skin?\"\\n\\n \"I remember the feeling.\"\\n\\n \"And once the drink was poured I could relax. I hadn\u0027t had it yet, it wasn\u0027t in my bloodstream spreading peace and love to every cell in my body, but just knowing it was there had the same effect. But what can be so bad that you\u0027re actually driven to call your sponsor?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, the joy of the season.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. Everybody\u0027s favorite time of year. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve been to a meeting within recent memory.\"\\n\\n \"I left one about two hours ago.\"\\n\\n \"That a fact. What\u0027s keeping you busy these days, besides guilt and self-pity? You hot on the trail of Will\u0027s replacement?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got half the cops in town after him,\" I said, \"and all the reporters. He doesn\u0027t need me.\"\\n\\n \"Seriously? You\u0027re not investigating the case?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. I\u0027d just get in everybody\u0027s way.\"\\n\\n \"So what is it you\u0027re doing, if you\u0027re not doing that?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing, really.\"\\n\\n \"Well, there\u0027s your answer,\" he said. \"Get off your ass and do something.\"\\n\\n He rang off. I hung up the phone and looked out the window. The city was still out there. I went out to take another crack at it.\\n\\n 19\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t do much in what was left of that afternoon. All I really managed was to figure out which people to see and what questions to ask them.\\n\\n That would have to wait until morning. Meanwhile Elaine and I caught the new Woody Allen movie and listened to a piano trio at Iridium. Walking home, I told her the season was getting to me.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m not an alcoholic,\" she said, \"and I\u0027m not even a Christian, and it gets to me. It gets to everybody. Why should you be different?\"\\n\\n \"What drew me to you in the first place,\" I said, \"was your wonderfully incisive mind.\"\\n\\n \"Rats. All these years I thought it was my ass.\"\\n\\n \"Your ass,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t have forgotten it.\"\\n\\n \"When we get home,\" I said, \"I\u0027ll refresh my memory.\"\\n\\n In the morning I put on a suit and tie and went downtown to the Chase branch on Abingdon Square where Byron Leopold had done his banking. The bank officer I sat down with was a bright young woman named Nancy Chang. Early on she said, \"I can\u0027t help it, I have to ask. Does this have anything to do with the man who\u0027s writing those letters?\" I assured her it didn\u0027t. \"Because I recognized your name right away from the newspaper stories. You\u0027re the man who broke the case.\"\\n\\n I said something appropriately modest, but for a change I wasn\u0027t sorry for the recognition. It certainly greased the wheels, and I walked out of there with a photocopy of a check payable to Byron Leopold in the amount of $56,650. It was drawn on a bank in Arlington, Texas, and the name of the account was Viaticom.\\n\\n \"Viaticom,\" I said. \"Have you ever heard of an insurance company by that name?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-33.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \\n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
