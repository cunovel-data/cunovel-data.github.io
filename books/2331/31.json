Not like the Kongs, she ain\u0027t no hacker, don\u0027t know how to do anything tricky, sneakin\u0027 into networks an\u0027 data bases and all of that. She just use it to do her homework and balance her checkbook an\u0027 shit.\"\n \"So you asked her computer about peach pits and cyanide and it spat out all that information?\"\n \"You don\u0027t ask the computer nothin\u0027. Computer just a machine.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"She got this on-line service, see, and you hook up to that and browse these different message boards. An\u0027 when you find somebody might know the answer to your question, you send him an E-mail. An\u0027 he E-mails you back. Like talkin\u0027, \u0027cept it on the screen.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"An\u0027 what else you can do, you can post a question on the message board, an\u0027 people post their answers an\u0027 you can pick \u0027em up later on. Or they\u0027ll E-mail it straight to you. Anything you want to know, somebody out there got the answer.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"Course, sometimes what you get gonna be the wrong answer, \u0027cause people who don\u0027t know be just as apt to answer as people who do. So all of that about the apricot kernels ain\u0027t exactly somethin\u0027 you can take to the bank, Frank. Might be he got the details wrong.\"\n \"I see.\"\n \"Anyway,\" he said, \"I learned all of that, so I thought I\u0027d pass it on. I be at Elaine\u0027s shop later, case you need me.\"\n I finished my coffee, and I was on my way out the door when the phone rang.\n It was Joe Durkin. \"We have to talk,\" he said.\n \"I was on my way over.\"\n \"Don\u0027t come here. There\u0027s that coffee shop I met you once, Greek place, Eighth between Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth. I forget the name, they changed it when they redecorated, but it\u0027s the same place.\"\n \"I know the one you mean. The east side of Eighth.\"\n \"Right. Ten minutes?\"\n \"Fine. I\u0027ll buy the coffee.\"\n \"All I want is straight answers,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t give a shit who buys the coffee.\"\n He was in a booth when I got there. He had a cup of coffee in front of him and an expression on his face that I couldn\u0027t read. He said, \"I want to know what you know about Will.\"\n \"What brought this on?\"\n \"What brought it on? I made a phone call this morning, just thought I\u0027d ask if the Allen Johnson name turned up on any lists they might have got from Poison Control.\"\n \"I gather it rang a bell.\"\n \"The name? It couldn\u0027t, because I didn\u0027t get that far. Before I knew it I was right in the middle of a Chinese fire drill. What did I know about Will? What did I have and where did it come from?\"\n \"What did you tell them?\"\n \"That I\u0027d heard something from a source during an investigation of another matter. I don\u0027t remember exactly what I said. I didn\u0027t mention your name, if that\u0027s what you were wondering.\"\n \"Good.\"\n \"The only reason I kept you out of it,\" he said, \"is before I give you to them I want to know what I\u0027m giving. How did this Allen Johnson get to be Will, and how did you get onto him, and who the hell is he anyway?\" When I hesitated he added, \"And don\u0027t hold out on me, Matt. If you\u0027re blowing smoke, blow it someplace else, will you? And if you\u0027ve got something, well, the son of a bitch already murdered four people. Don\u0027t sit there with your thumb up your ass while he goes and kills somebody else.\"\n \"He\u0027s not going to kill anybody else.\"\n \"Why, because he gave us his word? He kills people but he draws the line at lying?\"\n \"His killing days are over.\"\n \"And you know for a fact he won\u0027t change his mind?\"\n \"He can\u0027t.\"\n \"Why\u0027s that?\"\n \"Because he\u0027s dead,\" I said. \"The last person he killed was himself. I\u0027m not blowing smoke and I\u0027m not holding out, either. Will was Adrian Whitfield. He killed three people and then he killed himself.\"\n He looked at me. \"In other words, case closed. Is that what you\u0027re saying?\"\n \"It\u0027ll take some police work to wrap it up and tie off the loose ends, but-\"\n \"But Will\u0027s history and the people of this great city can sleep safe in their beds. Is that it?\"\n \"Evidently not,\" I said, \"if your tone of voice is anything to go by. What have you got?\"\n \"What have I got? I haven\u0027t got a thing. I could tell you what they\u0027ve got downtown, except you can figure it out for yourself when I tell you who they got it from. Our old friend Martin J. McGraw.\" I looked at him and he nodded. \"Yeah, right,\" he said. \"Another letter from Will.\"\n 17\n The letter had obviously been written after its author had read Marty McGraw\u0027s most recent column, the one that ended in an oblique invitation to Will to deal harshly with the principal owner of the New York Yankees. \"An Open Letter to Marty McGraw\" was how he headed it, and he started with a reference to the last line of McGraw\u0027s column. \"You ask where I am now that you need me,\" he said. \"The question answers itself if you will but remember what I am. The Will of the People is always present, even as it is always needed. The particular flesh and blood embodiment of that Will who writes these lines, and who has been called to action several times in recent months, is nothing more than a physical manifestation of that Will.\"\n He went on in that abstract vein for another paragraph or two, then turned specific. His letter\u0027s title notwithstanding, Marty McGraw was not his target. Neither was the Yankees\u0027 arrogant owner. Instead he named three New Yorkers whom he charged with acting in flagrant opposition to the public good. First was Peter Tully, head of the Transit Workers Union, who was already threatening to greet the new year with a bus and subway strike. Second on the list was Marvin Rome, a judge who\u0027d never met a defendant he didn\u0027t like. The final name was that of Regis Kilbourne, for many years the theater critic of the New York Times.\n Hours later, I finally got to see a copy of the letter. \"You keep shaking your head like that,\" Joe Durkin said, \"you\u0027ll wind up suing yourself for whiplash.\"\n \"Will never wrote this letter.\"\n \"So you said. At great length, as I recall.\"\n We\u0027d spent the day in a conference room at One Police Plaza, where I got to tell my story over and over to different teams of detectives. Some of them acted respectful while others were cynical and patronizing, but whatever attitude they struck it felt as though they were acting the part. They all seemed impossibly young to me, and I suppose they were. Their average age must have been around thirty-five, which gave me a good twenty years on them.\n I don\u0027t know why they had to ask me the same questions quite as many times as they did. A certain amount of that was probably to see if I contradicted myself or offered any additional information, but eventually I guess they just settled into a routine. It was easier to go over my story a few more times than to think of something else to do.\n Meanwhile, other people were off doing other things. They sent a crew to toss Adrian\u0027s apartment and another to disrupt things at his office. His photograph went out by wire to Omaha and Philadelphia, as well as to Midwest Express\u0027s hub city, Milwaukee. They weren\u0027t keeping me posted, but I guess some corroborating evidence began to turn up, because there was an attitudinal shift sometime around the middle of the afternoon. That was when it began to become clear that they knew the story I\u0027d spun for them was more than smoke.\n Joe was around for the whole thing. He wasn\u0027t always in the conference room, and at one point I thought he\u0027d gone home, or back to his precinct. He came back, though, and he brought a sandwich and a container of coffee for me. He disappeared again after a while, but he was planted in a chair in the outer office when they finally told me to go home.\n We walked a couple of blocks, passing up a few favorite cop watering holes, and wound up in the bar of a Vietnamese restaurant on Baxter Street. The place was the next thing to empty, with one man reading a newspaper at a table and another nursing a beer at the far end of the bar. The woman behind the bar looked exotic, and thoroughly bored. She fixed a martini for Joe and a Coke for me and left us alone.\n Joe drank a third of his martini and held the glass aloft. \"I ordered this,\" he said, \"not because I ever liked the taste of these things, but because after a day like today I wanted something that would hit me right between the eyes.\"\n \"I know what you mean,\" I said. \"That\u0027s why I ordered a Coke.\"\n \"Is that a fact. Don\u0027t tell me you never get the urge for something stronger.\"\n \"I get lots of urges,\" I said. \"So?\"\n \"So nothing.\" He nodded in the direction of the bartender. \"Talk about urges,\" he said.\n \"Oh?\"\n \"What do you figure, black father and Vietnamese mother?\"\n \"Something like that.\"\n \"A lonely GI far from home. A girl, young in years, but filled with the ancient knowledge of the East. Listen to me, will you? It\u0027s funny, though. You see somebody looks exotic like that, you think it\u0027d be special. But it\u0027s just in your mind.\"\n \"You\u0027ve looked at clouds from both sides now.\"\n \"Oh, go fuck yourself,\" he said.\n \"Everybody tells me that.\"\n \"Yeah, and I can see why. Here, I got a copy of this. I don\u0027t think I was supposed to, and I know I\u0027m not supposed to show it to you, but I\u0027ll bet you anything it\u0027s in the paper by morning, so why should you be the last person in town to see it?\"\n And he handed me Will\u0027s letter.\n \"It\u0027s all wrong,\" I said. \"Will didn\u0027t write this.\"\n \"If Will was Whitfield,\" he said, \"and assuming Whitfield\u0027s not playing possum, then all of that goes without saying, doesn\u0027t it? Of course he didn\u0027t write it. Dead men don\u0027t write letters.\"\n \"They can write them before they die. He already did that once.\"\n He took the letter from me. \"He\u0027s got references to the column of McGraw\u0027s that ran yesterday, Matt. And he talks about Tully\u0027s threat of a TWU strike, and that\u0027s only been news in the past week or ten days.\"\n \"I know that,\" I said. \"There\u0027s plenty of evidence to disprove any theory that Adrian wrote this and arranged to have it mailed weeks after his death. But suppose I never even suspected Adrian. You could still take one look at this and know that the same person hadn\u0027t written it.\"\n \"Oh? Style\u0027s pretty close.\"\n \"Will Number Two is literate,\" I said. \"He\u0027s got an ear for language, and I\u0027d guess he made a conscious effort to mimic Will Number One. I haven\u0027t got the other letters handy to compare them, but it seems to me I can recognize phrases that I\u0027ve read before.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know about that. I\u0027d agree it has a familiar ring to it. But wouldn\u0027t anybody copycatting Will make an effort to sound like the original?\"\n \"Not everybody could pull it off.\"\n \"No?\" He shrugged. \"Maybe it\u0027s harder than it looks. You know, he didn\u0027t just copycat the style of the writing. He got the rest of it right, too. See the signature?\"\n \"It\u0027s printed in script.\"\n He nodded. \"Same as the others. I was talking to a couple of the guys while the rest of them were in there trying to make your head spin. I asked about the forensic side.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-31.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
