Say he\u0027s retired, but maybe he bidin\u0027 his time. Everybody waitin\u0027 on his next move, wonderin\u0027 what\u0027s the next name on his list.\"\n \"But we know better.\"\n \"When you know the truth,\" he said, \"don\u0027t you have to tell somebody? Isn\u0027t that what detectin\u0027 is, findin\u0027 out the truth an\u0027 tellin\u0027 somebody?\"\n \"Not always. Sometimes it\u0027s finding out the truth and keeping it to yourself.\"\n He thought about it. \"Be a real big story,\" he said.\n \"I suppose so.\"\n \"Story of the year, what they\u0027d be callin\u0027 it.\"\n \"Every month there\u0027s another story of the year,\" I said, \"and every year there\u0027s a story of the decade and a trial of the century. One thing we\u0027ll never have to worry about is a shortage of hype. But you\u0027re right, it would be a big story.\"\n \"Get your name in all the papers.\"\n \"And my face in front of a lot of TV cameras, if I wanted. Or even if I didn\u0027t. That\u0027s almost reason enough right there to keep the story quiet.\"\n \"On account of you shy.\"\n \"I\u0027d just as soon stay out of the spotlight. I don\u0027t mind having my name in the paper once in a while. It draws clients, and while I don\u0027t necessarily want more business it\u0027s nice to be able to pick and choose. But this wouldn\u0027t be a little publicity. This would be a circus, and no, I wouldn\u0027t want to be the trained seal in the center ring.\"\n \"So Will\u0027s secret be safe,\" he mused, \"just because you don\u0027t want to go on \u0027Geraldo.\u0027 \"\n \"I could duck most of the publicity. I could feed it to Joe and let him whisper it into the right ears. He\u0027d find a way to make sure other people got the credit. That\u0027s probably what I\u0027ll do, if I do anything.\"\n \"But you might not even do that much.\"\n \"I might not.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because he\u0027s a sleeping dog,\" I said, \"and maybe the decent thing is to let him lie.\"\n \"How you gonna decide?\"\n \"By talking to people.\"\n \"Like we doin\u0027 now?\"\n \"Exactly like we\u0027re doing now,\" I said. \"This is part of the process.\"\n \"Glad I helpin\u0027.\"\n \"I\u0027ll go home and talk to Elaine,\" I said, \"and later on I\u0027ll talk about it at a meeting. I won\u0027t be specific, and nobody will know what I\u0027m talking about, but it\u0027ll help me clarify my own thoughts on the subject. And then there\u0027s somebody else I think I\u0027ll talk it over with.\"\n \"Who\u0027s that?\"\n \"An attorney I know.\"\n He nodded. \"Seems like don\u0027t nobody do nothin\u0027 without they first got to talk it over with a lawyer.\"\n Elaine and I had dinner at Paris Green, on Ninth Avenue, and our conversation stayed on a single topic from the portobello mushroom appetizer clear through to the cappuccino. I walked her back to the Pare Vendфme and continued on up Ninth to St. Paul\u0027s. I got there ten minutes late, and settled into my chair just as the speaker reached that point in the story where he took his first drink. I\u0027d missed the history of his dysfunctional family, but I could probably get along without hearing it.\n During the break I helped myself to coffee and chatted with a couple of people, and when the meeting resumed I got my hand up and talked about having to make a decision. I was wonderfully vague, and no one could have had a clue what I was getting at, but that\u0027s not atypical of AA shares. I talked about what was on my mind, and then a TV set designer talked about whether or not he was going home to Greenville for Thanksgiving, and then a woman talked about being on a date with a man who was drinking nonalcoholic beer, and how the whole thing had done a number on her head.\n After we\u0027d folded the chairs, I walked with some friends as far as the Flame, but turned down an invitation to join them for coffee, pleading a previous engagement. I headed over to Columbus Circle and rode the IRT local downtown to Christopher Street. By 10:30 I was standing on a stoop on Commerce Street, using a door knocker shaped like a lion\u0027s head.\n Commerce Street is two blocks long and off the beaten path, and it can be hard to find. I\u0027d put in enough time at the Sixth Precinct so that I still knew my way around the Village, and I\u0027d had occasion to get to this particular block several times in the past couple of years. Once Elaine and I had caught a play at the Cherry Lane Theater, just across the street. My other visits, like this one, were to Ray Gruliow\u0027s town house.\n I didn\u0027t have to linger long on his stoop. He drew the door open and motioned me inside, his face bright with the smile that is his most winning feature. It was a smile that said the world was a great cosmic joke, and you and he were the only two people who were in on it.\n \"Matt,\" he said, and clapped me on the shoulder. \"There\u0027s fresh coffee. Interested?\"\n \"Why not?\"\n The coffee was strong and rich and dark, worlds removed from the bitter sludge I\u0027d sipped out of a Styrofoam cup in the basement of St. Paul\u0027s. I said as much and he beamed. \"When I go to St. Luke\u0027s,\" he said, \"I take my own coffee in a thermos jar. My sponsor says it\u0027s my way of distancing myself from the group. I say it\u0027s more a matter of distancing myself from a gastritis attack. What\u0027s your opinion?\"\n \"I agree with both of you.\"\n \"Ever the diplomat. Now. What brings you here beside the lure of my most excellent coffee?\"\n \"The last time we spoke,\" I said, \"you defended Adrian Whitfield against a charge of suicide. Do you remember?\"\n \"Vividly. And shortly thereafter Will was good enough to send off a letter that validated my contention by claiming credit.\"\n I took another sip of the coffee. It was really something special.\n I said, \"Adrian killed himself. He wrote the letter. He wrote all those letters, he killed all those people. He was Will.\"\n 15\n \"It could have been murder,\" I said, \"even if I couldn\u0027t figure out how Will had managed to pull it off. Assume he had his ways, assume he could scale the side of the building and get in through a window, or unlock the door and disarm the burglar alarm system and reset it afterward. It was a real locked-room puzzle, though, any way you looked at it.\n \"But if it was suicide, the hell, what\u0027s simpler than poisoning your own whiskey? He could have done it whenever he had a few minutes alone, and that gave him plenty of opportunity. Just uncap the bottle, pour in the cyanide crystals, and put the cap back on.\"\n \"And be sure not to drink from that particular bottle until you\u0027re ready to catch the bus.\"\n \"That\u0027s right,\" I said. \"But we\u0027re back to the points you raised earlier. Why, in the absence of any kind of a financial motive, go to all that trouble to make suicide look like murder? And, motive aside, why wrap it up in a locked-room puzzle? Why make it look like an impossible murder?\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"So that Will would get the credit, and look good in the process. This would be Will\u0027s last hurrah. Why not make it a good one and go out with a bang?\"\n He thought about it, nodded slowly. \"Makes a kind of sense if he\u0027s Will. But only if he\u0027s Will.\"\n \"Granted.\"\n \"So how did you get that part? Because if it\u0027s just a hypothesis that you dreamed up because it\u0027s the only way to make sense out of the locked-room-murder-that-has-to-be-suicide…\"\n \"It\u0027s not. There\u0027s something else that got me suspicious.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"That first night at his apartment,\" I said, \"he didn\u0027t have booze on his breath.\"\n \"Well, for Christ\u0027s sake,\" he said. \"Why didn\u0027t you say so earlier? Jesus, I\u0027m surprised you didn\u0027t arrest the son of a bitch right then and there.\"\n But he listened without interrupting while I explained my recollection of that first visit to Whitfield\u0027s Park Avenue apartment. \"He made a point of saying he\u0027d been drinking when he hadn\u0027t,\" I explained. \"Now why the hell would he lie about something like that? He wasn\u0027t a heavy drinker, and he didn\u0027t claim to be a heavy drinker, but he did drink, and he even took a drink in front of me. So why the subterfuge, why pretend to have had a couple of drinks earlier in the evening?\n \"I didn\u0027t have to be able to answer that in order to conclude that he\u0027d lied to me, and I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d do that without a reason. Well, what did the lie accomplish? It underscored his claim of having been really rattled by Will\u0027s threat. What was he saying, really? Something along the lines of, \u0027I\u0027m truly and righteously scared, in fact I\u0027m so scared that I\u0027ve already had a couple of drinks today, and now I\u0027m going to have another one and you can stand there and watch me do it.\u0027\n \"Why would he want me to think he was scared? I busted my head on that one. What I came up with was that the only reason he\u0027d have for going out of his way to impress me with his fear was because it didn\u0027t exist. That\u0027s why he had to lie about it. He wanted me to think he was afraid because he wasn\u0027t.\"\n \"Why bother? Wouldn\u0027t you assume he was afraid, getting marked for death by some clown who was riding a hot streak? Wouldn\u0027t anybody?\"\n \"You\u0027d think so,\" I said, \"but he knew something I didn\u0027t. He knew he wasn\u0027t afraid, and he knew he had nothing to be afraid of.\"\n \"Because Will couldn\u0027t hurt him.\"\n \"Not if he was Will.\"\n He frowned. \"That\u0027s a pretty big leap of logic, wouldn\u0027t you say? He\u0027s pretending to be afraid, therefore he\u0027s not afraid, therefore he\u0027s got nothing to fear. Therefore he\u0027s Will, master criminal and multiple murderer. I don\u0027t remember a whole lot from my freshman logic class, but it strikes me there\u0027s a flaw in the ointment.\"\n \"A flaw in the ointment?\"\n \"The ointment, the woodpile. Maybe he\u0027s not afraid because he\u0027s got terminal cancer and he figures Will\u0027s just doing him a favor.\"\n \"I thought of that.\"\n \"And, since he\u0027s keeping his illness secret from the world, he puts on an innocent act in order to keep you from wondering why it doesn\u0027t upset him more to be Will\u0027s next headline.\"\n \"I thought of that, too.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"I had to admit it was possible,\" I said, \"but it just didn\u0027t ring true. The motive for subterfuge seemed pretty thin. So what if I didn\u0027t think he was afraid? I\u0027d just figure him for a stoic. But if what he wanted to cover up was the fact that he was Will, well, you could understand why he\u0027d be moved to keep that a secret.\"\n \"Where did you go from there?\"\n \"I took a look at the first murder.\"\n \"Richie Vollmer.\"\n \"Richie Vollmer. Adrian\u0027s client, now free to do it again.\"\n \"Anybody would have gotten Richie off, Matt. It wasn\u0027t Adrian\u0027s doing. The state\u0027s case fell apart when the Neagley woman hanged herself. It\u0027s not as though Adrian handed her the rope.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"You think he felt responsible?\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t go that far. I think he saw Richie\u0027s release as a gross miscarriage of justice, and I think he read Marty McGraw\u0027s column and came to the conclusion that Marty was right. The world would be a better place without Richie in it.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-28.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
