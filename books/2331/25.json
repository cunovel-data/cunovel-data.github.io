He cashed in his insurance and he died with something like forty thousand dollars in the bank.\" \"Ain\u0027t that a motive?\" \"He left it all to some AIDS charities. Some of those organizations are a little aggressive in their fund-raising, but I\u0027ve never heard of them going out and killing for the money.\" \"Besides, all they gotta do is wait, right? \u0027Cause the man already dyin\u0027.\" He frowned. \"You know what\u0027d be nice? Piece of pie.\" I beckoned the waitress over and he asked her what kind of pie she had, giving her response some careful attention. \"Pecan,\" he decided, \"with some of that whatcha-call a la mode on it. Say chocolate?\" She looked at him, confused, and the street went right out of his speech. \"I\u0027ll have a piece of pecan pie,\" he said, \"with a scoop of chocolate ice cream.\" She nodded and went away, and he rolled his eyes. \"Now she be thinkin\u0027 I a doctor. She be after me to take out her appendix.\" \"Tell her your doctorate\u0027s in botany.\" \"That\u0027s just as bad, Tad. She\u0027ll have me talkin\u0027 to her plants. If killin\u0027 Byron didn\u0027t put no money in nobody\u0027s pocket, who\u0027d hire somebody to do it?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"He had AIDS, right? But he wasn\u0027t gay.\" \"He got it from a needle.\" \"He keep it all to hisself? Or did he pass it on?\" I must have looked puzzled. \"The virus, Cyrus. Who\u0027d he go and infect?\" \"He could have spread it around,\" I said. \"Years ago, before he even knew he had it.\" \"So he gives it to some woman, and then her husband or her boyfriend or her brother wants to know how she got it. \u0027Couldn\u0027t be nobody but that no-account junkie Byron Leopold,\u0027 she says.\" \"Whereupon the husband or brother or whatever he is goes out and hires somebody to kill Byron.\" \"Or does it his own self. Either way Byron\u0027d be a stranger to him an\u0027 he might axe him his name to make sure he didn\u0027t kill the wrong person. \u0027Mr. Leopold? Byron Leopold?\u0027 \" \"Pop pop.\" \"All she wrote,\" he agreed. \"What about This is for Sheila, you dirty rat?\u0027 The way he did it, Byron wouldn\u0027t even know why he was dying.\" \"If Sheila\u0027s brother was doin\u0027 it hisself, you\u0027d \u0027spect him to say somethin\u0027. If he only hired the shooter-\" \"The shooter might not bother with the oratory. Even if the brother did it himself, he could have a speech planned and be too nervous to deliver it.\" I drank some coffee. \"I don\u0027t buy any of it,\" I said. \"Who takes that kind of revenge on a man with one foot in the grave? Byron Leopold was a bag of bones, his idea of a big day was sitting in the sun with his newspaper. No matter what he did to you, one long look at him and the resentment\u0027d go right out of you.\" \"What\u0027s that leave? Suicide?\" \"I thought of that.\" \"Huh?\" \"Say he didn\u0027t want to live anymore but he couldn\u0027t bring himself to take action. So he hires somebody to do it for him.\" \"He\u0027s afraid to stick his head in the oven, but he\u0027s cool with the idea of waitin\u0027 for somebody to sneak up and shoot him.\" \"I said I thought of it. I never put it high up on the list.\" \" \u0027Sides, how\u0027s he hire somebody who never met him face to face? You hire me to shoot you, I ain\u0027t gonna have to ask you your name.\" \"Forget it,\" I said. \"It never made any sense in the first place and it makes less sense now. Byron Leopold was murdered by someone who had a reason to kill him, and he himself was the only person in the world with a reason to want him dead. There ought to be a financial motive. That\u0027s what it feels like, but there\u0027s no money in it for anybody.\" \"There\u0027s whatever he had. Forty kay? But you said some charity gets that.\" \"And it\u0027s not enough anyway.\" \"Not enough?\" \"Not enough to kill for.\" \"Dudes up on Washington Heights, they killed three people and only got half that much.\" \"They were lowlife dipshits,\" I said. \"They probably killed for the hell of it. They already had the money. Why kill the girl? To keep her quiet? She couldn\u0027t tell anybody, and her mother and brother were asleep in their beds, for Christ\u0027s sake. They killed three people for no reason.\" \"Guess you ain\u0027t likely to be a character witness for them. Anyway, wasn\u0027t no lowlife shot Byron. Said, \u0027Mr. Leopold.\u0027 Polite, you know? Showed some respect.\" \"It\u0027s little things that make all the difference.\" His pie had arrived while we were talking, and now it was mostly gone. He held a bite balanced on his fork and said, \"Funny about the forty kay. First it was too much and now it ain\u0027t enough.\" \"He cashed in an insurance policy,\" I said, \"and that would have brought him only a fraction of what he had in the bank. So in that sense the forty thousand was too much, but…\" \"Somethin\u0027 wrong?\" \"No.\" \"Way you just broke off an\u0027 started starin\u0027.\" \"Too much money,\" I said. \"Glenn Holtzmann had too much money. It was in his closet when he died. And I dreamed about him, and that\u0027s what the dream was trying to tell me. Too much money.\" I looked across at TJ, who still had the last bite of pie on his fork. \"I thought the dream was about Will. But it wasn\u0027t. It was about Byron Leopold.\" 13 It still didn\u0027t have to mean anything. It had been a dream, after all, and not a message from Glenn Holtzmann in the spirit world. (If his shade had indeed contacted me from beyond the beyond, he\u0027d probably have had more on his mind than some guy who got himself shot on a park bench in the Village. \"Hey, Scudder,\" he might have murmured, \"what\u0027s this I hear about you and Lisa?\") The dream was my own self talking to me, and I wasn\u0027t necessarily all that much sharper while I slept. Anyway, sometimes it\u0027s just a cigar. \"If,\" TJ said, and stopped himself. \"No,\" he said, holding up his hands as if to stop himself from running into a wall. \"No, I won\u0027t say it.\" \"Good.\" \"But if we did, be no stoppin\u0027 us.\" If we had a computer. That was the phrase he\u0027d agreed not to say, and not a moment too soon, because those five little words played a key role in every sentence out of his mouth. I seemed to have two cases, the shooting death of Byron Leopold and Will\u0027s string of homicides. (What I didn\u0027t have was a client, unless you wanted to count Adrian Whitfield, who\u0027d paid me some money a while back and encouraged me to extend the umbrella of my investigation to cover both cases.) Whichever one I wanted to fool with next, TJ seemed certain a computer would make all the difference. Insurance records? Just boogie on into the insurance company\u0027s data base. Airline records? Do the same for the airlines. The whole world was on-line these days, and a well-schooled hacker could reach out with ease and touch someone, anyone, and pick his brain while he was at it. All you needed was a computer and a modem and a phone line to plug into and the world would whisper all its secrets to you. \"You also need someone who knows what he\u0027s doing,\" I said. \"It took the Kongs to crack the NYNEX computer. I\u0027m willing to believe you could learn how to do all that, but not fast enough to do us any good now.\" \"Take a while,\" he admitted. \"Meantime, the Kongs could talk me through it.\" \"If they happened to be in the neighborhood.\" \"They ain\u0027t the only hackers could do it. Be easy to use them, though, an\u0027 they wouldn\u0027t have to come down from Boston to do it. All they\u0027d have to be is near a phone.\" \"How do you figure that?\" \"Nothin\u0027 to it,\" he said. \"I\u0027d be on the computer, and be on the phone with them at the same time. You\u0027d need two phone lines is all, one for the modem and one for the phone. Or you could use a cell phone to talk to them if you didn\u0027t want to run a second line in.\" \"In where?\" \u0027In wherever you got the computer. Your apartment, most likely. Or the shop.\" \"Elaine\u0027s shop?\" \"So\u0027s she could use it for keepin\u0027 books an\u0027 takin\u0027 inventory. I could do all that for her.\" \"If you took a course or two.\" \"Well, it ain\u0027t rocket science. I could learn.\" \"There\u0027s not a whole lot of spare room in the shop.\" He nodded. \"Be better off settin\u0027 up in the apartment.\" \"We had to set up in a hotel room with the Kongs,\" I remembered. \"Had to rent one, so that our little invasion of the phone company computer couldn\u0027t be traced back to us.\" \"So?\" \"Because what the Kongs did,\" I went on, \"was illegal and traceable. If we pulled anything like that from the apartment, or from Elaine\u0027s shop, we\u0027d have guys with badges knocking on the door.\" \"Hackers has learned some tricks since then.\" \"And what about the cyber cops? Don\u0027t you think they\u0027ve learned anything?\" He shrugged. \"Way it works,\" he said. \"Build a better mousetrap, somebody else gonna build a better mouse.\" \"Anyway,\" I said, \"technology only takes you so far, even if you\u0027re the Kongs. They couldn\u0027t get into the system, remember? No matter how many keys they punched, they couldn\u0027t find the combination.\" \u0027They got in.\" \u0027They talked their way in. They put technology on hold and called up a human being on the telephone.\" \"Some girl, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"And they sweet-talked her into giving up the password. They used that technique routinely enough to have a special phrase for it.\" I groped around in my memory and came up with it. \"Social engineering, that\u0027s what they called it.\" \"What you gettin\u0027 at?\" \"I\u0027ll show you/\u0027 I said. \"Omaha,\" Phyllis Bingham said. \"To think there was a time when I booked you and Elaine to London and Paris. And now it\u0027s Omaha?\" \"How the mighty have fallen,\" I said. \"But I don\u0027t want to go there. I just want to find out if somebody else did.\" \"Ah,\" she said. \"Detective work?\" \"I\u0027m afraid so.\" \"And if he went there you have to chase after him?\" \"I think he went and came back.\" I handed her a slip of paper. \"Probably flew out there on either of these dates, and returned on either of these.\" \"From New York to Omaha, and-\" \"From Philadelphia.\" \"From Philadelphia,\" she said. \"I was just going to guess who flies nonstop from New York to Omaha, and I know America West used to, and I don\u0027t know if they still do, but it doesn\u0027t matter if he flew from Philadelphia. But who flies Philly to Omaha nonstop?\" She flexed her fingers, frowned, tapped away at the keys. \"Nobody,\" she announced. \"You can get there on USAir via Pittsburgh or you can fly Midwest Express through Milwaukee. Or United if you don\u0027t mind changing at O\u0027Hare. Or any airline, just about, but those are the logical ones. I don\u0027t suppose you know which airline he used?\" \"No.\" \"And his name?\" \"Arnold Wishniak.\" \"Well, if we find him,\" she said, \"we\u0027ll know it\u0027s him, won\u0027t we? Because how many Arnold Wishniaks could be going from Philadelphia to Omaha?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-25.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
