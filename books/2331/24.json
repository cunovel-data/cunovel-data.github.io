The lights were out in the law office. I walked on past it and used the lavatory again, and the lights were still out when I returned.\\n\\n The lock was better than the one on Barish\u0027s door, and I thought I might have to break the glass to get in. I was prepared to do that-I didn\u0027t think anyone was around to hear it, or inclined to pay attention-but first I used my pocketknife to gouge the door jamb enough so that I could get a purchase on the bolt and snick it back. I put on the lights, figuring that a lighted office would look less suspicious to someone across the street than a darkened office with someone moving around inside it.\\n\\n I found Whitfield\u0027s office and got busy.\\n\\n It was around one-thirty in the morning when I got out of there. I left the place looking as I\u0027d found it, and wiped whatever surfaces I might have left prints on, more out of habit than because I thought anyone might dust the place for prints. I rubbed a little dirt into the gouges I\u0027d made around the lock, so that the scar didn\u0027t look too new, and I drew the door shut and heard the bolt snick behind me.\\n\\n I was too tired to think straight, and actually considered holing up in Barish\u0027s office and napping in his easy chair until dawn, all that in order to avoid having to sneak out past the guard. Instead I decided to bluff my way past him, and when I went downstairs the lobby was empty. A sign I\u0027d missed on my way in announced that the building was locked from ten at night to six in the morning.\\n\\n This didn\u0027t mean I couldn\u0027t get out, just that once out I couldn\u0027t get back in again. That was fine with me. I got out of there and had to walk three blocks before I could hail a cruising cab. Stickers on the windows in the passenger compartment warned me against smoking. In front, the Pakistani driver puffed away at one of those foul little Italian cigars. Di Nobili, I think they\u0027re called. Years and years ago I was partnered with a wise old cop named Vince Mahaffey, and he smoked the damn things day in and day out. I suppose they were no less appropriate for a Pakistani cabby than for an Irish cop, but I didn\u0027t let myself be transported on wings of nostalgia. I just rolled down the windows and tried to find something to breathe.\\n\\n Elaine was asleep when I got in. She stirred when I slipped into bed beside her. I gave her a kiss and told her to go back to sleep.\\n\\n \"TJ called again,\" she said. \"You didn\u0027t beep him.\"\\n\\n \"I know. What did he want?\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t say.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call him in the morning. Go to sleep, sweetie.\"\\n\\n \"You all right?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n \"Find out anything?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Go to sleep.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Go to sleep, go to sleep.\u0027 Is that all you can say?\"\\n\\n I tried to think of a response, but before I could come up with anything she had drifted off again. I closed my eyes and did the same.\\n\\n 12\\n\\n Elaine was gone by the time I woke up. There was a note on the kitchen table explaining that she\u0027d left early for an auction at Tepper Galleries on East Twenty-fifth Street, and reminding me to beep TJ. I had a shower first, and toasted an English muffin. There was coffee in the thermos, and I drank one cup and poured another before I picked up the phone and dialed his beeper number. When the tone sounded I punched in my own number and hung up.\\n\\n Fifteen minutes later the phone rang and I picked it up. \"Who wants TJ?\" he said, and went on without waiting for a response, \" \u0027Cept I know who it is, Diz, on account of I reckanize the number. You believe it took me this long to find a phone? Either they out of order or somebody be on them, talkin\u0027 like they gettin\u0027 paid by the word. You think I should get a cell phone?\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t want one.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want a beeper,\" he said, \"or a computer, neither. What you want\u0027s the nineteenth century back again.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe the eighteenth,\" I said, \"before the Industrial Revolution took the joy out of life.\"\\n\\n \"Someday you can tell me how nice it was with horses and buggies. Why I don\u0027t want a cell phone, they cost too much. Cost when you call somebody, cost when somebody call you. Top of that, you got no privacy. Dude\u0027s chillin\u0027 with a Walkman, he\u0027s liable to pick up everything you sayin\u0027. What makes it work like that?\"\\n\\n \"How would I know?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t even need a Walkman. People be pickin\u0027 up your conversation on the fillings in their teeth. Next thing you know they think it\u0027s the CIA, tellin\u0027 \u0027em they supposed to go to the post office and shoot everybody.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t want that on your conscience.\"\\n\\n \"Damn, you right about that.\" He laughed. \"I stick to my beeper. Hey, listen. I found that dude.\"\\n\\n \"What dude is that?\"\\n\\n \"Dude you had me lookin\u0027 for. Dude who was on the scene when the one dude shot the other dude.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s too many dudes in that sentence,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know who you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n \"Talkin\u0027 \u0027bout Myron.\"\\n\\n \"Myron.\"\\n\\n \"Dude got shot in that little park? Dude had AIDS? Ring a little bell, Mel?\"\\n\\n \"Byron,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Byron Leopold. Wha\u0027d I do, call him Myron? I been doin\u0027 that in my head all along. Thing is, see, I never heard of nobody named Byron… You still there?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t say nothin\u0027, so I beginnin\u0027 to wonder.\"\\n\\n \"I guess I was speechless,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t know you were still looking for the witness.\"\\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t been nobody told me to stop.\"\\n\\n \"No, but-\"\\n\\n \"An\u0027 the man got me started in this detectin\u0027 business, everybody say he like a dog with a bone. Once he get his teeth in somethin\u0027, he ain\u0027t about to turn it loose.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what they say?\"\\n\\n \"So I gettin\u0027 to be the same my own self, like a dog with a bone. \u0027Sides, it be somethin\u0027 to do.\"\\n\\n \"And you found the dude.\"\\n\\n \"Took some doin\u0027,\" he admitted. \"He wasn\u0027t exactly lookin\u0027 to be found. But he saw the whole thing, \u0027cept it was more hearin\u0027 than seein\u0027. He wasn\u0027t lookin\u0027 at first, and when he did look he was seein\u0027 it from behind. So he saw the back of the dude who did the shooting, and he didn\u0027t see the gun, just heard, you know, pop pop.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what he heard? Pop pop?\"\\n\\n \"What he heard was gunshots. What else you gone hear when somebody shoots a gun?\"\\n\\n \"Everybody who was there heard the gunshots,\" I said, \"and even if they hadn\u0027t the bullets in Leopold\u0027s body are fairly strong evidence that a couple of shots were fired. So if all this fellow did was hear the shots-\"\\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t all he heard.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"That was all the man heard, you think I\u0027d be botherin\u0027 you with it?\"\\n\\n \"Sorry. What else did he hear?\"\\n\\n \"Heard the dude say, \u0027Mr. Leopold?\u0027 Then he didn\u0027t hear nothin\u0027, so either Byron just nodded or his voice didn\u0027t carry. Then he heard the dude say, \u0027Byron Leopold?\u0027 An\u0027 maybe he looked up an\u0027 maybe he didn\u0027t, but the next he heard the dude was bustin\u0027 caps.\"\\n\\n \"Pop pop.\"\\n\\n \"Like that.\"\\n\\n \"When can I see this witness?\"\\n\\n \"He might be pretty slow to talk to you. He already missed a few chances to talk to the police.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t suppose the gentleman\u0027s a vice president at IBM.\"\\n\\n \"He in the park sellin\u0027 product,\" he said, \"an\u0027 soon as the dude commences to shoot, he ready to call it a day hisself. I can maybe put you \u0027cross a table from him, but that don\u0027t mean he\u0027s gone talk to you. \u0027Sides, what you gonna axe him that I didn\u0027t axe him already?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Mr. Leopold? Byron Leopold?\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t sound to me like he\u0027s makin\u0027 it up.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said, \"it doesn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n An hour later I was watching him eat french fries at a Fourteenth Street coffee shop. His cheeseburger was but a memory. He was wearing baggy jeans and a denim jacket with a quilted lining. His railroader\u0027s cap was on the seat beside him.\\n\\n I told him I had pretty much forgotten Byron Leopold.\\n\\n \"Why\u0027s that?\" he wondered. \"You come to the conclusion he died of natural causes?\"\\n\\n \"When I thought about it at all,\" I said, \"which wasn\u0027t often, I suppose I figured he\u0027d been taken for someone else and killed in error. Or that he\u0027d unwittingly made an enemy in the neighborhood by sitting on the wrong bench or mouthing off at the wrong person. And he had AIDS, and he was far enough along so that the disease was visible. Maybe somebody had an AIDS phobia and decided the best cure lay in killing off the victims.\"\\n\\n \"Like the dudes who set bums on fire.\"\\n\\n \"As a quick cure for the problem of homelessness. That\u0027s the idea. I didn\u0027t think that was it, though, because that kind of killer doesn\u0027t act once and then go off and enter a monastery.\"\\n\\n \"He repeats.\"\\n\\n \"Usually.\" The waitress came by and filled my coffee cup without asking. The coffee wasn\u0027t very good, but there was plenty of it. I said, \" \u0027Mr. Leopold? Byron Leopold?\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Like that.\"\\n\\n \"Making sure he\u0027s got the right person.\"\\n\\n \"Person he\u0027s supposed to shoot. Like he knows the name but he never met him before. We brainstormin\u0027, right? Battin\u0027 ideas back and forth?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that,\" I agreed. \"He sounds hired, doesn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"The killer? You mean like a pro?\"\\n\\n \"Not like a pro,\" I said. \"The whole thing\u0027s too raggedy-ass for a pro. Here\u0027s a man who\u0027s alone a lot, leads a very regular life, hasn\u0027t set up any security system to make himself hard to kill. It\u0027s easy to get close to him in private, so why would a professional hitman kill him in front of witnesses?\"\\n\\n \"Only reason I said a pro, Joe, is you said hired.\"\\n\\n \"An amateur,\" I said, \"hired by another amateur. It pretty much takes a pro to hire a pro. You need to be connected, you can\u0027t look up contract killers in the yellow pages. Ordinary citizens hire killers all the time, but there\u0027s nothing terribly professional about the people who work for them.\"\\n\\n \"An\u0027 it don\u0027t always work out the way it s\u0027posed to,\" he said. \"Like the other day in Washington Heights.\"\\n\\n I knew the one he was talking about. It had been all over the papers the past few days. A Dominican teenager, bridling at her father\u0027s strict discipline, had engaged a pair of local hard cases to kill the man, enticing them with the prospect of the $20,000 he kept in a strongbox in the closet, considering it ever so much safer than the bank.\\n\\n So they showed up at the house one night and she let them in. She gave them the money, and then they were supposed to wait for Daddy to come home. But they got tired of waiting, and it occurred to them that he might be armed, and there was an easier way to close the account. So they took the girl who started the whole thing and shot her twice in the head, and they did the same for her sleeping mother and brother while they were at it, and then they went home. The father came home from work to find his family dead and his money gone. I bet his car wouldn\u0027t start, either.\\n\\n \"In Washington Heights,\" I said, \"everybody had a reason. The girl was mad at her father, and the killers wanted the money.\"\\n\\n \"So who had a reason to kill Byron?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I was wondering.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-24.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \\n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
