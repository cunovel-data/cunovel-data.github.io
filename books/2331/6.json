{"id":64238,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The debate was just warming up when the police announced the arrest of Marion Scipio, a trusted associate of Rashid\u0027s and a member of his inner circle. Scipio (n–π Marion Simmons; Rashid had suggested the change with a nod to Scipio Africanus) had broken down under police interrogation and admitted he\u0027d seized the opportunity of Will\u0027s open letter to right a longstanding injury. Apparently Rashid\u0027s libido had not been slaked by his two official wives, sisters or twins or whatever they were, and he\u0027d had a fling with Scipio\u0027s wife. Scipio only had one wife, and he\u0027d taken this the wrong way. When his chance came around, he took the Senufo ax down from the wall and made Rashid a head shorter.\n Will was so pleased you\u0027d have thought he did it himself. His next letter, posted hours after Scipio\u0027s arrest and confession became public knowledge, restated the theme of his letter upon the death of Roswell Berry. The people\u0027s will had found expression. What did it matter who swung the ax?\n And there he\u0027d let it lie for the ten days or so since. There were other voices-letters and phone calls purporting to be from Will, but clearly not, a couple of anonymous bomb threats, one of which cleared a midtown office building. McGraw got a handwritten letter, \"An Open Letter to the So-called Marry McGraw,\" whose semi-literate author blamed him for Will\u0027s reign of terror. \"You\u0027ll pay for this in your own blood, asshole,\" the letter concluded, and it was signed with a large red X that covered half the page. (A lab analysis quickly established that the X was not in fact blood, but red Magic Marker.)\n It took the cops just two days to pick up Mr. X, who turned out to be an unemployed construction worker who\u0027d written the letter on a dare and then boasted about it in a saloon. \"He thinks he\u0027s hot shit,\" he said of McGraw, but outside of that he didn\u0027t really have anything against him, and certainly planned him no harm. The poor son of a bitch was charged with menacing and coercion in the first degree, the latter a Class D felony. They\u0027d probably let him plead to a misdemeanor and my guess was he\u0027d get off with probation, but in the meantime he was out on bail and not feeling terribly proud of himself.\n And the city went on speculating about Will. There was a new joke about him every day. (Publicist to client: \"I\u0027ve got good news and bad news for you. The good news is you\u0027re the subject of a column in tomorrow\u0027s Daily News. The bad news is Marty McGraw\u0027s writing it.\") He kept winding up in your conversation, as had happened at least once that very evening, when TJ assured me that computers would ultimately reveal Will\u0027s true identity. There was, of course, no end of guesswork about the sort of person he was and the sort of life he was likely to be leading. There was guesswork, too, as to who would next draw his attention. One shock jock had invited his listeners to submit names for Will\u0027s consideration. \"We\u0027ll see who gets the most votes,\" he told his unseen drive-time audience, \"and I\u0027ll announce your top choices over the air. I mean, who knows? Maybe he\u0027s a listener. Maybe he\u0027s a big fan.\"\n \"If he\u0027s listening,\" purred the fellow\u0027s female sidekick, \"you better hope he\u0027s a fan.\"\n That was on a Friday. When he returned to the air on Monday morning, he\u0027d had a change of heart. \"We got lots of letters,\" he said, \"but you know what? I\u0027m not announcing the results. In fact I\u0027m not even tabulating them. I decided the whole thing\u0027s sick, not just the poll but the whole Will fever that\u0027s gripping the city. Talk about everybody\u0027s baser instincts. You wouldn\u0027t believe some of the jokes that are going around, they are truly sick and disgusting.\" And, to prove the point, he told four of them, one right after the other.\n The police, of course, were under enormous pressure to find the guy and close the case. But the sense of urgency was very different from that surrounding Son of Sam, or any of the other serial killers who had cropped up over the years. You weren\u0027t afraid to walk the streets, not for fear of Will stalking you and gunning you down. The average person had nothing to fear, because Will didn\u0027t target average people. On the contrary, he took aim only at the prominent, and more specifically at the notorious. Look at his list of victims-Richie Vollmer, Patsy Salerno, Roswell Berry, and, if indirectly, Julian Rashid. Wherever you stood in the social and political spectrum, your response to each of Will\u0027s executions was apt to be that it couldn\u0027t have happened to a nicer guy. And now he\u0027d set his sights on Adrian Whitfield.\n 3\n \"I\u0027ll tell you,\" he said, \"I just don\u0027t know what to make of it. One minute I\u0027m laughing over the latest Will joke. Next thing you know I find out that I\u0027m the latest Will joke, and you want to know something? All of a sudden it\u0027s not so funny.\"\n We were in his apartment on the twenty-first floor of a prewar apartment building on Park Avenue and Eighty-fourth Street. He was a tall man, around six two, lean and trim, with patrician good looks. His dark hair had gone mostly gray, and that just enhanced the commanding presence that stood him in good stead in a courtroom. He was still wearing a suit but he\u0027d taken off his tie and opened his collar.\n He was at the serving bar now, using tongs to fill a tall glass with ice cubes. He added club soda and set it down, then dropped a couple of ice cubes in a shorter glass and filled it with a single-malt scotch. I got a whiff of it as he was pouring it, strong and smoky, like wet tweed drying alongside an open wood fire.\n He gave me the tall glass and kept the short one for himself. \"You don\u0027t drink,\" he said. \"Neither do I.\" My face must have shown something. \"Ha!\" he said, and looked at the glass in his hand. \"What I mean to say,\" he said, \"is that I don\u0027t drink like I used to. I drank a lot more when I was living in Connecticut, but I think that\u0027s because everybody in that crowd used to hit it pretty good. One small scotch before dinner is generally as much as I have these days. Tonight\u0027s an exception.\"\n \"I can see where it would be.\"\n \"When I left the office,\" he said, \"after I got rid of those cops, I stopped at the bar down the block and had a quick one before I went and hailed a cab. I can\u0027t remember the last time I did that. I never even tasted it. I threw it down and walked right on out again. And I had another when I walked in the door, I went over and poured it without thinking about it.\" He looked at the glass he was holding. \"And then I called you,\" he said.\n \"And here I am.\"\n \"And here you are, and this will be my last drink of the night, and I\u0027m not even sure I\u0027ll finish it. \u0027An Open Letter to Adrian Whitfield.\u0027 You want to know the most distressing thing about it?\"\n \"The company you\u0027re in.\"\n \"That\u0027s it exactly. Now how the hell did you know I was going to say that? That\u0027s the clarity of club soda talking.\"\n \"It must be.\"\n \"Vollmer and Salerno and Berry and Rashid. A child-killer, a mobster, an abortion-clinic bomber, and a black racist. I graduated from Williams College and Harvard Law School. I\u0027m a member of the bar and an officer of the court. Will you please tell me how I can possibly belong on the same list with those four pariahs?\"\n \"The thing is,\" I said, \"Will gets to decide who\u0027s on his list. He doesn\u0027t have to be logical about it.\"\n \"You\u0027re right,\" he said. He went over to a chair and sank into it, held his glass to the light, then set it down untasted. \"You said something earlier about leaving the country. You were exaggerating to make a point, right? Or were you serious?\"\n \"I was serious.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I was afraid of.\"\n \"If I were you,\" I said, \"I\u0027d get the hell out of the country, and I wouldn\u0027t wait, either. You have a passport, don\u0027t you? Where do you keep it?\"\n \"In my sock drawer.\"\n \"Put it in your pocket,\" I said, \"and pack a change of clothes and whatever else will fit into a bag you can carry onto the plane. Take whatever cash you\u0027ve got around the house, but don\u0027t worry if that\u0027s not very much. You\u0027re not a fugitive, so you\u0027ll be able to cash checks and use credit cards wherever you wind up. You can even get cash. They\u0027ve got ATMs all over the world.\"\n \"Where am I going?\"\n \"That\u0027s up to you, and don\u0027t tell me. Some European capital would be my suggestion. Go to a first-class hotel and tell the manager you want to register under another name.\"\n \"And then what? Lock myself in my room?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027d have to do that. He followed Roswell Berry to Omaha, but he didn\u0027t have to do any detective work. Berry was right there on the evening news every night, throwing cow\u0027s blood on doctors and nurses. And you don\u0027t need a passport to go to Nebraska, either. My guess is if you leave the country and don\u0027t make it too obvious where you\u0027ve gone, he\u0027ll find it a lot simpler to dash off an open letter to somebody else than to knock himself out tracking you down. And he can always tell himself he won the game by scaring you out of the country.\"\n \"And he\u0027d be quite right about that, wouldn\u0027t he?\"\n \"But you\u0027ll be alive.\"\n \"And a little tarnished around the image, wouldn\u0027t you say? The fearless defense attorney who skipped the country, rousted by an anonymous letter. I\u0027ve had death threats before, you know.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure you have.\"\n \u0027The Ellsworth case brought a whole slew of them. \u0027You son of a bitch, if he walks you\u0027re dead.\u0027 Well, Jeremy didn\u0027t walk, so we\u0027ll never know.\"\n \"What did you do with the letters?\"\n \"What I\u0027ve always done with them. Turned \u0027em over to the police. Not that I expected a lot of sympathy from that quarter. There weren\u0027t a lot of cops pulling for me to get Jeremy Ellsworth acquitted. Still, that wouldn\u0027t keep them from doing their jobs. They investigated, but I doubt they pushed it too hard.\"\n \"They\u0027d have dug a lot deeper,\" I said, \"if you\u0027d gotten killed.\"\n He gave me a look. \"I\u0027m not leaving town,\" he said. \"That\u0027s out of the question.\"\n \"It\u0027s your call.\"\n \"Matt, death threats are a dime a dozen. Every criminal lawyer in this town\u0027s got a desk drawer full of them. Look at Ray Gruliow, for God\u0027s sake. How many death threats do you suppose he\u0027s received over the years?\"\n \"Quite a few.\"\n \"He got a shotgun blast through his front windows on Commerce Street one time, if I remember correctly. He said the shooters were cops.\"\n \"He couldn\u0027t know that for sure,\" I said, \"but it was a logical guess. What\u0027s your point?\"\n \"That I\u0027ve got a life to live and I can\u0027t let something like this make me run like a rabbit. You\u0027ve had death threats yourself, haven\u0027t you? I\u0027ll bet you have.\"\n \"Not that many,\" I said. \"But then I haven\u0027t had my name in the papers all that much.\"\n \"But you\u0027ve had some.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Did you pack a bag and hop a plane?\"\n I took a sip of club soda, remembering. \"A couple of years ago,\" I said, \"a man I\u0027d sent to prison got out determined to kill me. He was going to start out by killing the women in my life. There weren\u0027t any women in my life, not at the time, but his definition turned out to be broader than mine.\"\n \"What did you do?\"\n \"I called an ex-girlfriend,\" I said, \"and I told her to pack a bag and leave the country. And she packed a bag and left the country.\"\n \"And lived to tell the tale. But what did you do?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-6.html","bookId":2331,"book":{"id":2331,"title":"Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Even the Wicked (Matthew Scudder #13) \n Matthew Scudder knows that justice is an elusive commodity in the big city, where a harmless man can be shot dead in a public place criminals fly free through holes in a tattered legal system.
