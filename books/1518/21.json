{"id":62511,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"The Dweller - The Problem at Perchorsk - In the Garden\n Perhaps inspired by the reaction of the sphere-cave\u0027s ossified inhabitants, Harry\u0027s first reflex was to panic. Instinctively, he came close to conjuring - almost attempted to fashion - a Mobius door, and only just retreated from that action in time to avert a disaster. God alone knew where, or how, he would end up if he tried to use Mobius mathematics here, inside the grey hole!\n And so he floated, drawn irresistibly upward - or passed - through the Gate; and almost before he knew it ...\n ... His resurgence was almost as big a shock as his entry: he passed through the skin of the sphere, then slid down its curve crashingly onto a jumble of stony debris between the sphere and the crater wall. For indeed he saw that the sphere was inside a crater, and directly overhead - a second sphere!\n So that now Harry could see almost all of the picture. The jigsaw was very nearly complete. The Gate he had just traversed was the original. The one above, seated in the mouth of the crater, had appeared here simultaneous with the creation of its twin - its other \u0027end\u0027 - in Perchorsk. Perhaps the presence of the first had somehow influenced the location of the second, Harry couldn\u0027t say. Maybe Mobius would know.\n Except -\n If that decapitated corpse in the cave had come through comparatively recently, and also the walkie-talkie... were the Wamphyri now using the original sphere as a dumping site? And why dump a radio? But one thing was certain: they had passed through. They had entered the sphere - this sphere - from this side. And if they had found their way down here, then he could make his way up. No sooner had the thought occurred than he saw the magmass wormholes running through the rock. They were everywhere, cutting smoothly through the solid rock at all angles.\n Under his duffle-coat, Harry still had his torch clipped to his belt. He took the torch out, chose a horizontal shaft and wriggled in. In a little while the hole turned to the right, then bent sharply into a descent. Harry abandoned it, came out backwards. Other holes were no better. But then, at his fifth attempt...\n ... He found a hole which climbed gently, not so steeply as to cause him to slide back. In a little while it, too, bent to one side, the left, following which it rose marginally more steeply. Then it levelled out and swung right. But beyond the level bend it shot almost vertically upward. Harry stood up, switched off his torch. After the claustrophobia of the hole this was a little better; for now it was as though he stood at the bottom of a shallow well. Up there, strange constellations of stars glittered brightly in a black, jewelled sky. He reached up a hand... the rim of the hole was at least twenty-four inches beyond his grasp.\n He bent his knees, jumped. A hard thing to spring upright and make any height in the confined space of a hole two and a half feet across! Especially in a duffle-coat, carrying a heavy machine-gun, with a spare magazine and two hundred rounds in your pockets.\n The gun!\n Harry took the weapon from his shoulder, extended the sling to its full extent. Taking the gun by the barrel, he pushed its stock up the smooth bore of the wormhole, hooked its pistol-grip over the rim. Then, wedging himself against the wall, he used elbows and knees to gain enough height to get his foot into the loop of the dangling sling. And after that it was easy. Gradually straightening up, he dragged himself out of the wormhole and hauled the gun up after him.\n Panting a little from his exertions, he scanned the terrain. And just as it had affected Zek Foener, Jazz Simmons and others before them, so it affected Harry. Starside at sundown was - weird!\n But while Harry observed Starside, so too was he observed. Keen-eyed shapes moved in the shadows of boulders to the west, and a flitting thing high overhead squeaked a cry beyond the range of Harry\u0027s ears to detect. Then the great bat, Desmodus, sped east, making for a distant stack, while on the ground a trog set off to lope westward, cupping horny hands to his Neanderthal face and sending a cry ringing ahead of him. The cry was heard, picked up, passed on. A straggled scattering of trogs spread out over many miles passed the eerie message down the line.\n Almost at the same time the messages were received both in the stack and in the Dweller\u0027s garden. But where Lord Shaithis of the Wamphyri must order a flyer readied and descend to the launching bays, the Dweller was not dependent upon that sort of conveyance; he simply inclined his head and listened for a moment, turned his eyes eastward and sighed. The newcomer\u0027s identity could not be doubted; the Dweller would have known that mind anywhere, any time.\n So, after all these years, finally he had come. And at such a time. Well, nothing for it but to welcome him; and who could say but that shortly he might be sorely needed? And so the Dweller simply went to Harry, where for long minutes he had stood, close to the glaring sphere, gazing on the world of the Wamphyri...\n Harry was staring at the distantly rearing stacks, wondering about them just as Zek, Jazz and others had wondered before him. Suddenly ... he was aware that someone watched him. He spun round and fell into a crouch, swung his gun up and cocked it. Some forty yards north of the sphere, out on the boulder plain, there stood a figure, motionless, watching. It was a slim figure, male from what Harry could see of it, and its face was golden, burning in the reflected glare of the sphere.\n \u0027Don\u0027t shoot!\u0027 the other called out in a young-old voice, holding up a hand. \u0027There\u0027s no danger. Not yet.\u0027\n There was something about the voice. Harry relaxed a very little, tilted his head on one side enquiringly. \u0027Not yet?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said the other. \u0027But soon. Look!\u0027 And he pointed at the sky to the east. Harry looked.\n Dark blots were growing large in the sky. Two of them, with others mere dots far behind. They came from the direction of the stacks. One was winged, shaped something like a manta. The other was ... a nightmare shape! Gigantic, it squirted through the sky like a squid. \u0027I should think that\u0027s Shaithis,\u0027 said the Dweller, pointing. \u0027And the other thing, that\u0027ll be one of his warriors. And see behind them? More flyers, carrying a couple of his lieutenants.\u0027\n \u0027Wamphyri?\u0027 Harry guessed.\n \u0027Oh, yes. You\u0027d better come over here.\u0027\n Go over there? Harry believed he knew why: to be away from the gate. He knew the voice, too. He didn\u0027t know it - couldn\u0027t possibly know it - but he knew it. He moved to obey, and the flying shapes came closer.\n The two leading shapes, Shaithis aboard a flyer, and a riderless warrior, swooped down out of the sky. They began to circle, and Shaithis\u0027s beast sank lower, the wind of its great wings blasting dust and grit up from the plain into Harry\u0027s and the Dweller\u0027s faces. Its shadow fell on them as it shut out the stars, and Shaithis\u0027s booming voice called:\n \u0027Surrender! Surrender now, to the Lord Shaithis!\u0027\n \u0027Are you ready, father?\u0027 said The Dweller. He held up one wing of his cloak.\n Harry believed. No, he knew. The child he had searched for was eight years old, and this young man was at least twenty, but the two were one and the same. How didn\u0027t matter, not right now. Harry\u0027s whole world, his entire life, had been filled with things just as strange as this. Stranger.\n \u0027I\u0027m ready, son,\u0027 he answered, his voice catching a little. \u0027But... does it work here?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, it works. Except you mustn\u0027t use it too close to a Gate.\u0027\n \u0027I know,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I tried it once.\u0027\n Shaithis settled his beast to earth to the west, his warrior crunched down to the east. Other shapes loomed in the sky, almost directly overhead. \u0027Ho, Dweller,\u0027 Shaithis called, dismounting. \u0027It seems I have you!\u0027\n \u0027Let me take you to our garden,\u0027 said Harry Jnr to his father.\n Harry stepped forward, took him in his arms and hugged him. He felt his son\u0027s cloak close around him.\n Shaithis, striding forward, jerked to a halt. Dust leaped up from the plain, formed itself into a devil that swirled in the vacuum that the two men had left behind. They were no longer there.\n For long moments Shaithis stood, his flattened, convoluted snout sniffing the air. Then his great nostrils flared and his eyes blazed their fury. He threw back his head and roared. And as the plain echoed his cry, so he began to curse. And then he made his vow:\n \u0027Dweller, I shall have you!\u0027 he snarled. \u0027You and your garden and all you possess. I shall have your magic, your weapons, your cloak of invisibility, your every secret. Do you hear? I shall have you, and the hell-landers, and everything. And when I have these things, then I shall use them to make myself the most powerful Lord there ever has been or ever will be. So speaks Shaithis of the Wamphyri. So let it be!\u0027\n The echoes of his cry, his cursing and his vow died away, and for a long time Shaithis stood there alone with his dark Wamphyri thoughts...\n Ten days later:\n At Perchorsk, Chingiz Khuz paraded, inspected and briefed his troops, \u0027Khuv\u0027s Kommandos\u0027, as he had named them: a platoon of top-quality infantrymen from the famous Moskva Volunteers. Thirty armed men and machines, specially uniformed (or painted) in the colours of their task: black combat suits with white discs on the upper arms, plus the usual badges of rank with the hammer and sickle sigil blazoned over. Their vehicles -five light-weight, jeep-like trucks and trailers, plus three outrider motorcycles, all for the moment waiting in the Projekt\u0027s loading! unloading bays - were likewise black, marked on their doors and panniers with the white disc of the Gate. They bore no number plates, carried no documentation. No requirement for such encumbrances where they were going.\n For the next ten days these men would sleep in a converted Projekt warehouse here \u0027on the premises\u0027; they\u0027d be briefed, given all available details of what they could expect, shown films of the same, and intensively trained in the use of one-man flame-throwers and three larger, trailer-transported units. Their mission: go into the sphere, through the Gate, and set up a base camp on the other side. They were in short an expeditionary force.\n Each man was hand-picked; they left no loved ones behind, had few friends or relatives, were all volunteers as befitted the history and traditions of their parent regiment. And they were as hard as foot-soldiers come.\n From the landing at the top of the wooden stairs Viktor Luchov watched Khuv strut, listened to his voice echoing up as he paraded before the platoon on the boards of the Saturn\u0027s-rings circumference, saw the goggled faces of the thirty where they stood at ease turning to follow him up and down, up and down, as he delivered his welcoming address.\n Welcome - hah!\n And would the hostile new world they were invading welcome them, too? - Luchov wondered. With what would it welcome them?\n Finally the initial introduction to Perchorsk was over; Khuv handed over to his Sergeant-Major 2I/C; the men were fallen out, told to leave the core in an orderly fashion and return to their billets. They came up the steps single-file, passed Luchov and disappeared through the magmass levels. Khuv himself was the last to leave, and looking ahead up the steps he saw Luchov waiting for him. \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, as he came up the stairs to the landing, \u0027and what do you think of them?\u0027\n \u0027I heard what you said to them.\u0027 Luchov\u0027s voice was cold, almost distant. \u0027What difference does it make what I think of them? I know where they\u0027re going, and therefore that they\u0027re dead men!\u0027\n Khuv\u0027s dark eyes were bright, less than inscrutable. There was a fever in them, which while it told of excitement refused to hint at the source. So perhaps they were inscrutable after all. \u0027No,\u0027 he shook his head, \u0027they\u0027ll survive. They are the best. Men of steel against entirely flesh-and-blood monsters. Self-supporting, working as a perfectly co-ordinated team, equipped with the best personal weapons we can given them... they\u0027ll do much better than just survive. Against the primitives we know exist through there - \u0027 he glanced down on the shining Gate, \u0027 - they\u0027ll appear as supermen! They\u0027re a bridgehead, Direktor, into a new world. Oh, a military bridgehead, I agree - but that\u0027s only temporary. One day soon,\u0027 (and here his eyes narrowed a little, Luchov thought) \u0027you, too, shall visit that other world, when they\u0027ve made it safe for you. And who can say what resources will be found there? Who knows what wealth, eh? Don\u0027t you understand? They\u0027ll claim and tame that world for the USSR!\u0027\n \u0027Pioneers?\u0027 Luchov hardly seemed impressed. They\u0027re soldiers, Major, not settlers. Their prime function isn\u0027t to farm or explore, it\u0027s to kill!\u0027\n Again Khuv shook his head. \u0027No, their prime function is to protect themselves and the Gate. To open it up, keep anything else from breaking through to us. From the time they go in, this Gate becomes literally - one-way. From here to there. That\u0027s what I call security.\u0027\n \u0027And what about them?\u0027 Luchov\u0027s voice was colder than ever. \u0027Do they know they can\u0027t come back?\u0027\n \u0027No, they don\u0027t,\u0027 Khuv\u0027s response was immediate, \u0027and they can\u0027t be told. You\u0027d better understand that: they can\u0027t be told. I have instructions for you on that matter, and on other matters...\u0027\n \u0027Instructions for - \u0027 Luchov sucked in air implosively. \u0027You have instructions for me?\u0027\n Khuv was impassive. \u0027From the very highest authority. The very highest! Where those soldiers are concerned, Direktor, I am in charge.\u0027 He produced and handed Luchov a sealed envelope stamped with the Kremlin crest. \u0027As for not coming back: no, they won\u0027t, not immediately. But eventually...\u0027\n \u0027Eventually?\u0027 Luchov glanced at the envelope, put it away. \u0027Eventually?\u0027 he snorted. \u0027How long do we need, man? This Gate has been here for over two years - and what have we learned about the world on the other side? Nothing! Except that it\u0027s home for ... monsters! We\u0027ve never even communicated with the other side.\u0027\n \u0027That comes first,\u0027 said Khuv. \u0027Field telephones.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027We know sound travels through the sphere,\u0027 said the other, \u0027and light - both ways! However warped the effect, men can talk and communicate with each other in there. These men will lay a cable as they go. It can be tested after they\u0027ve travelled no more than a few paces! And if that doesn\u0027t work they\u0027ll set up temporary semaphore stations. At least we\u0027ll get to know what it\u0027s like through there. What it\u0027s like on the other side.\u0027\n Luchov shook his head. \u0027That still won\u0027t get them back,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Not yet, not now,\u0027 Khuv grated, losing his patience. \u0027But if there is a way back we\u0027ll find it. Even if it means building another Perchorsk!\u0027\n Luchov took a pace backwards, was brought up short when the small of his back met the handrail. \u0027Another Per - ?\u0027 His jaw fell open. \u0027Why, I hadn\u0027t even considered - \u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t think you had, Direktor.\u0027 Now Khuv grinned, his face a grim, emotionless mask. \u0027So now consider it. And stop worrying about these men. If you must worry, then worry for yourself, and for your staff. You\u0027ll find that in those orders, too. Once the bridgehead is established - you\u0027re next!\u0027\n Luchov tottered where he stood grasping the rail. He was furious, but shock had made him impotent as Khuv turned away. Then he found his voice, called out: \u0027But oh how neatly you\u0027ve escaped the net yourself, eh, Major?\u0027\n Khuv paused, slowly turned to face him. He was as pale as Luchov had ever seen him. \u0027No,\u0027 he shook his head, and Luchov saw his Adam\u0027s apple working, \u0027for that, too, is in the orders. You\u0027ll be happy to know that in just ten days\u0027 time we part company, Viktor. For when they go through, I go with them!\u0027\n At the other end of the shaft to the magmass levels, out of sight round the corner, Vasily Agursky had been privy to all their conversation. Now, as Khuv\u0027s footsteps sounded on the boards, he turned and ran silently for the upper levels. He wore rubber-soled shoes, moved with the litheness of a cat. No, like a wolf! He loped, and revelled in the strength of his thighs as they effortlessly propelled him. Strong? Even in his youth he\u0027d never known such strength! Nor such passions, desires, hungers...\n But for all Agursky\u0027s speed and stealth, still Khuv caught a glimpse of him before he could pass out of sight. It was only that, a glimpse, but it caused the KGB Major to frown. On top of all his other worries, now there was this thing with Agursky - whatever it was. Khuv hadn\u0027t seen much of him lately, but whenever he had ... he couldn\u0027t put his finger on it but something was wrong. And there he went, swift as a deer, head forward, silent as a ghost and just as weird.\n Khuv shook his head and wondered what was ailing the strange little scientist. Wondered what had got into him ...\n The next morning, early, Khuv jerked awake to the clamour of alarms. In the moment of waking his heart almost stopped - tried to tear itself free and leap up into his throat - until he realized that these were only the general alert alarms, not Luchov\u0027s damned failsafe. Thank God - whom Khuv didn\u0027t really have any faith in, anyway -for that!\n A moment later, as he hurriedly dressed, came the hammering on his door. He opened it to let in the unctuous Paul Savinkov; except that apart from the sweat on his fat, shining, frightened face, there was nothing at all slimy about him now. He smelled now not of grease but fear!\n \u0027Major!\u0027 he gasped. \u0027Comrade! My God, my God.r\n Khuv shook him. \u0027What is it, man?\u0027 he snarled. \u0027Here, sit down before you fall down.\u0027 He shoved Savinkov into a chair.\n The fat esper was trembling, wobbling like a jelly. \u0027I... I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s just... just...\u0027\n Khuv slapped him, backhanded him, deliberately slapped him again. \u0027Now perhaps you\u0027ll tell me what\u0027s wrong!\u0027 he growled.\n The white burn of Khuv\u0027s slim fingers came up like long blisters on Savinkov\u0027s face. His eyes lost their glaze and he shook his head, as if he was the one who had just woken up and not Khuv. Then - Khuv thought the man was about to burst into tears. If he did, Khuv knew he would hit him right in the teeth! \u0027Well?\u0027 he rasped.\n \u0027It\u0027s Roborov and Rublev,\u0027 Savinkov gasped. \u0027Dead, both of them!\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 Khuv knew he must be imagining this; it had to be some crazy dream. \u0027Dead? How, for the love of - ? An accident?\u0027 He finished dressing, slipped into his shoes.\n \u0027Accident?\u0027 Savinkov grinned like an idiot, but his features quickly melted into a sob. \u0027Oh, no - no, it wasn\u0027t an accident. When it happened, their thoughts woke me up. Their thoughts were - awful!\u0027\n Thoughts?\u0027 Khuv\u0027s mind, still not fully awake, sought for an explanation. Of course: Savinkov was a telepath. \u0027What about their thoughts?\u0027 -v\n \u0027Something... something was attacking them. In Roborov\u0027s room. I think they\u0027d been playing cards, gambling, and that Roborov was a heavy loser. He\u0027d been to the toilet. When he came out... Rublev was nearly dead! Something had him by the throat! Roborov tried to pull it off, and ... it turned on him! Oh, God - 1 felt him die! Huh... huh... he...\u0027\n \u0027Go on, man!\u0027 Khuv gasped.\n \u0027He grabbed the thing and turned it around, and he saw it. He was thinking: \"I don\u0027t believe this! Oh, mother, help me! Sweet God, you know I\u0027ve always loved you! Don\u0027t let this happen!\"\u0027\n \u0027Those were his thoughts?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Savinkov sobbed. \u0027The rest of it was just background stuff, but it was Roborov\u0027s thoughts that really woke me up. And as he died - I saw it too.r\n \u0027What did you see?\u0027 Khuv took Savinkov\u0027s face between the flats of his palms.\n \u0027God, I don\u0027t know! It wasn\u0027t human - or maybe it was? It was a nightmare. It was ... its shape was all wrong! It was like... like that thing in the glass tank!\u0027\n Khuv\u0027s blood ran cold. He gulped air into his lungs, released Savinkov\u0027s face. He grabbed his lapels and dragged him to his feet. \u0027Take me there,\u0027 he snapped. \u0027Roborov\u0027s room? I know it. Were you there? No? Then who is there? You don\u0027t know? Fool! Well, we\u0027re going there right now!\u0027\n On their way, the alarms stopped clamouring. \u0027Well, let\u0027s be thankful for that, anyway,\u0027 Khuv grunted. He jostled Savinkov ahead of him. \u0027At least I can hear myself think! Now, are you sure you can\u0027t remember who you told? I mean, did you simply forget all the procedures and come running straight to me? God, but if this is a wild-goose chase I\u0027ll -!\u0027\n But it wasn\u0027t.\n Outside the door of Roborov\u0027s room a sleepy, nervous soldier stood on guard. He saluted sloppily as Khuv and Savinkov came into view. They rushed by him. Inside were two more espers, and a KGB man named Gustav Litve. All were whey-faced, shaken to their roots. Crumpled on the floor, there lay the reason. Or reasons.\n Nikolai Rublev could be Savinkov\u0027s twin! thought Khuv, grimacing at what he saw. They were, or had been, much of a kind. But now there were differences, the main one being that Savinkov was still alive. And he was also intact.\n Whatever it was that had killed Rublev, it had taken half his face from him. The fleshy part of the left side of his face was missing, flensed from the bone, from his ear to his nose and down to his chin. But it wasn\u0027t the work of a scalpel or knife. The flesh had been ripped off. In addition his throat was torn - torn, as by an animal - with the main arteries severed and exposed. Khuv thought: where\u0027s all the blood?\n Perhaps he\u0027d said something out loud, for his underling Litve said: \u0027Sir?\u0027\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Khuv looked up. \u0027Oh, nothing. Fetch Vasily Agursky, will you, Gustav? Bring him here. I want to know what kind of an animal could do this, and he might be able to tell me.\u0027\n Litve gratefully made for the door, called back: \u0027The other\u0027s not much better, sir.\u0027\n \u0027Other?\u0027 Khuv\u0027s mind still wasn\u0027t on business.\n \u0027Roborov.\u0027\n Khuv realized he\u0027d been wandering. To make up for it he snapped, \u0027He was your colleague, wasn\u0027t he?\u0027\n \u0027Was, sir, yes,\u0027 Litve answered. He went out.\n Behind an overturned table, amidst a litter of bloodied paper money and cards, lay \u0027the other\u0027, Andrei Roborov. The two espers were standing looking down on him. Khuv shoved them aside, took a look for himself. Roborov\u0027s face was a mask of sheer horror. His dead eyes bulged; his jaws gaped in a frozen rictus of terror; his tongue projected, blue and glistening. Mainly cadaverous in life, he was totally grotesque in death. His thin head from the ears up looked like it had been trapped in a toothed vise and crushed. The skull had caved in, and blood and brain fluid seeped from the cracks and the deep punctures of... teeth marks?\n \u0027Good Lord!\u0027 said Khuv; to which one of the espers added:\n \u0027Something bit his head like it was a plum! Major, look at his arms.\u0027\n Khuv looked. Both arms were broken at the elbows, bent back on themselves until the bones had parted at the sockets. Whatever it was, it had found a simple and effective way of stopping Roborov from fighting back.\n Khuv shook his head, felt his gorge rising. He could almost feel the pulse of the Projekt quickening as morning came and the place started to wake up. There was a faint throbbing underfoot, like the heart of a great beast. And within the beast, a lesser beast: the one that had done this. Or perhaps, a greater beast? What sort of beast? Not human, surely. But if not human...\n There was a telephone out in the corridor. Khuv ran to it and called the Duty Officer at Failsafe Concen. He didn\u0027t let the man speak but rasped: \u0027Have you been sleeping? Have you been asleep on duty?\u0027\n \u0027Who is this?\u0027 came a wide-awake, alert voice from the other end. Khuv recognized the voice: a senior scientist on Luchov\u0027s team. A very responsible person.\n \u0027This is Major Khuv,\u0027 he lowered his voice. \u0027It seems we may have an intruder. Certainly we have a murderer in the place.\u0027\n \u0027An intruder?\u0027 the voice on the other end hardened. \u0027Where are you, Major?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m in the corridor close to KGB quarters. Why?\u0027\n \u0027Do you mean an intruder from outside, or from the Gate?\u0027\n \u0027Well, obviously that\u0027s why I\u0027m on the phone!\u0027 Khuv snapped. \u0027To find out!\u0027\n Now the other came back just as venomously: \u0027In which case it should also be obvious that your intruder is from outside! If it was anything else - by now you\u0027d be burning, Khuv!\u0027\n \u0027I-\u0027\n \u0027Listen, I\u0027ve got the screens right here in front of me. Everything is normal down there, except they\u0027re all a bit nervous because of those bloody alarms. Nothing, repeat nothing, has come through that Gate!\u0027\n Khuv slammed the phone down. He stood glaring at it. Something was loose in here. Maybe it had been let loose in here. By whom? British E-Branch?\n He ran back into Roborov\u0027s room, told the two espers: \u0027Out, leave all this. If you come up with something let me know. But until then leave this to my investigators.\u0027\n Savinkov was making himself as small and insignificant as he could in a corner. \u0027You,\u0027 Khuv said. \u0027There are three more KGB men stinking in their beds just down the corridor, a stone\u0027s throw from the scene of a double murder. Go wake the idle bastards up. Wake them all up! Tell them I want them here, now.\u0027\n Savinkov went.\n Khuv ushered the espers out into the corridor and closed Roborov\u0027s door. Viktor Luchov had just arrived, looked bewildered, only half-awake. \u0027Don\u0027t go in there,\u0027 Khuv warned him, shaking his head. Luchov took one look at the KGB officer\u0027s face and was sensible enough to take heed.\n \u0027But what\u0027s happened?\u0027\n \u0027Murder - at least I think so.\u0027\n \u0027But don\u0027t you know?\u0027 Luchov gaped.\n \u0027I know two people are dead, and if their killer is human, then it\u0027s murder.\u0027\n Luchov was waking up quickly. \u0027Is it that bad? Have you checked with Fail - \u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Khuv cut him short. To both questions.\u0027\n \u0027But -\u0027\n \u0027No buts,\u0027 Khuv interrupted again. \u0027If it\u0027s something from the Gate, then it\u0027s invisible.\u0027\n At that moment Litve returned with Agursky. Khuv\u0027s eyes went straight to the tiny scientist. Except... Agursky hardly seemed that small any more. He slumped a little, yes, but if he were to stand up straight...\n Agursky had on his night things with a dressing-gown thrown over them. And he was wearing dark spectacles. \u0027Something wrong with your eyes?\u0027 Khuv frowned.\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Agursky squinted, peered at the Major through tinted lenses. \u0027Oh, yes. It comes on now and then. Photophobia. It\u0027s with being down here, out of the natural light. All this artificial lighting.\u0027\n Khuv nodded. He had more than enough with which to concern himself without worrying about Agursky\u0027s weird-ness. \u0027In there,\u0027 he nodded, indicating the door to Roborov\u0027s room. \u0027Two dead men.\u0027\n Agursky seemed hardly concerned. He opened the door, made to go in. Khuv caught his arm, felt the tension in him. Strange, because it hadn\u0027t shown in his movements or his mannerisms. \u0027I want you to tell me what killed them, if you can. Give me some sort of idea, anyway. Gustav, go in there with him.\u0027\n While they were inside the room, Khuv told Luchov all he knew. Impossible to work if the Projekt Direktor was going to be prying into everything. Better to put him firmly in the picture right now, from square one. By the time he was through, Litve and Agursky had come back out of the room. Litve was still very pale; Agursky seemed his usual self.\n \u0027Any ideas?\u0027 Khuv asked him.\n The other shook his head, averted his eyes. \u0027Something terrifically strong. Immensely strong. A beast, certainly.\u0027\n \u0027Beast?\u0027 Luchov blurted.\n Agursky glanced at him. \u0027In a way of speaking, Direktor, yes. A human beast. A murderer. But as I said, a very large, very strong man.\u0027\n Khuv said: \u0027And the teeth marks in Roborov\u0027s skull?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Agursky shook his head. \u0027His skull was smashed in with a hammer or something very similar. Yes, something like a small-pane hammer. But wielded with considerable force.\u0027\n Remembering that garbage Savinkov had spewed out, Khuv scowled. \u0027But I have an esper,\u0027 he said, \u0027Paul Savinkov, who says he \"saw\" the killer. And he says it was something nightmarish!\u0027\n Agursky had started to turn away, but now he slowly turned back. \u0027He saw this happen, you say?\u0027\n \u0027In his mind, yes.\u0027\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 Agursky nodded his understanding. Then he smiled, shrugged half-apologetically. \u0027Well, my science takes note of physical evidence only, Major. Metaphysics isn\u0027t my scene. Will you be requiring me any more? I have many things to do now, and - \u0027\n \u0027Only one more thing,\u0027 said Khuv. \u0027Tell me, what did you do with the corpse of the dead creature from the tank?\u0027\n \u0027Do with it? I photographed it, studied it to the point of stripping it down to cartilage and bone, finally destroyed, burned it.\u0027\n \u0027Burned it?\u0027\n Agursky shrugged again. \u0027Of course. It was from the Gate, after all. There was nothing else to be learned from it. And... best not to take chances with things like that, don\u0027t you agree?\u0027\n Luchov patted him on the shoulder. \u0027Of course, Vasily, of course we do. Thank you very much.\u0027\n \u0027If we do want you,\u0027 Khuv called after him, \u0027you\u0027ll be hearing from me. But with any luck we won\u0027t.\u0027 To Luchov he said, \u0027God, he gives me the creeps!\u0027\n \"This whole place,\u0027 Luchov muttered, \u0027gives me the creeps!\u0027\n As Agursky went off, so Savinkov returned with Khuv\u0027s KGB operatives. They\u0027d had civil police training, and since this now appeared to be a case of routine murder...\n Khuv scowled at them. They looked ruffled, unshaven. He dressed them down, told them what had happened and what he wanted. They went into Roborov\u0027s room. By now Savinkov had disappeared, probably sneaked off before Khuv could find more work for him.\n But as Khuv and Luchov made to return to the upper levels, so the telepath came back. He was reeling, sobbing, seemed totally uncoordinated. \u0027Major - help! I ... I... oh, God!\u0027\n Khuv pounced on him, grated: \u0027What now, Paul?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s Leo!\u0027 he gasped.\n \u0027Leo Grenzel?\u0027 The locator! \u0027What is it with Leo?\u0027\n \u0027I wondered why he hadn\u0027t picked up the presence of the intruder,\u0027 Savinkov babbled, \u0027and so I went to his room. The door was ... it was open. I went in, and... and...\u0027\n Khuv and Luchov looked at each other. Their expressions were much the same: shock, disbelief, horror! Savinkov\u0027s reasoning was faultless, of course: Grenzel, if he was awake and well, should have appeared on the scene long before now.\n Leaving Savinkov leaning against the metal wall, sobbing, Khuv and Luchov set off down the corridor at a run.\n Khuv called back: \u0027No alarms, Paul! Only set them off one more time and the entire Projekt will take flight!\u0027\n In Grenzel\u0027s room it was a repeat of the same story. His spine had been broken, looked bitten through to the marrow and spinal cord. His sharp features seemed even sharper in death, and his huge, bulging eyes an even deeper shade of grey.\n What had those esper\u0027s eyes of his seen before he died, Khuv wondered? And then he stilled the bobbing of his Adam\u0027s apple and staggered out of the room, until he was no longer able to hear Luchov\u0027s throwing up into Grenzel\u0027s toilet ...\n The Dweller\u0027s garden was a marvellous place.\n It was a miniature valley, a gently hollowed \u0027pocket\u0027 at the rear of a saddle in the mid-western reach of the mountains. In extent the garden was something a little more than three acres in a row, with the length of its rear boundary against the final rise of the saddle, and its frontage where the saddle started to dip toward frowning cliffs. A low wall had been built there, to keep people from moving too close. In between there were small fields or allotments, greenhouses and a scattering of clearwater ponds. One of the ponds swarmed with rainbow trout, while some of the others bubbled with heat from thermal activity deep in the ground; hot springs, in fact.\n Because of the abundance of water the place was lush with vegetation, but only a handful of species were unknown to Earth. The rest of the flowers, shrubs, trees in the garden would have been perfectly at home in any English garden. Harry Jnr\u0027s mother tended them, when she felt up to it. But usually his Travellers looked after the garden, as they looked after almost everything here.\n Harry Jnr\u0027s bungalow house was centrally situated, built of white stone with a red tile roof, its front perched over the wide mouth of a well that occasionally gave off streamers of steam. He swam and bathed in the pool regularly. His Travellers (no longer true Travellers, in fact, for they were permanent dwellers here themselves now) inhabited similarly constructed stone houses at the sides of the saddle, where the level ground met rising cliffs. All such homes were centrally heated, with a system of plastic pipes carrying hot water from a deep, gurgling blowhole. They had glass windows, too, and other refinements utterly unheard of before Harry Jnr\u0027s time.\n The Dweller (as all of his tenants insisted on calling him) had built greenhouses in which to grow an abundance of vegetable produce. Heated and watered from the springs, his crops were amazing. Also, he had found ways round the long, cold, dark sundowns. Plant species which would adapt already had, but others which wouldn\u0027t received artificial sunlight. The permanently running water drove his generators (small but incredibly powerful machines such as Harry Snr had never seen or even dreamed of before), which in turn powered ultraviolet lamps in the greenhouses - and electric lights in the houses!\n \u0027You\u0027ve done ... so much!\u0027 Harry Keogh told his son, where he walked with him along the edge of a plot shady with sweet corn grown tall. \u0027All of this is nothing short of... astonishing!\u0027\n Harry Jnr had heard much the same thing from Zek Foener, Jazz Simmons, every Traveller who ever made it here; it was a common reaction to things he\u0027d come to take for granted. \u0027Not really,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Not set against what I\u0027m capable of doing. Chiefly I wanted a place to live, for myself and for my mother. So it had to be made liveable. And what is it really but a strip of fertile soil some two hundred or more yards long by eighty wide, eh? As for the running of the place, the Travellers do that for me.\u0027\n \u0027But the buildings,\u0027 Harry said, as he\u0027d said it so often during the course of the past sunup. \u0027Oh, I know they\u0027re only bungalows, but they\u0027re so, well, beautiful! They\u0027re simple but delightful. The great span of their arches, the delicate buttresses, the cut of the roof timbers. They\u0027re not Greek, not anything I can put a finger on, just so pleasing. And all built by these... well, by these cave-dwellers of yours!\u0027\n The trogs are people, father,\u0027 Harry Jnr smiled. \u0027But the Wamphyri never gave them a chance to develop, that\u0027s all. They\u0027re no more primitive than your Australian bushmen, all considered. But on the other hand they\u0027re eager to learn. Show them a principle or a system and they catch on quick. Also, they\u0027re grateful. Their old gods didn\u0027t treat them too well, and I do. As for the architecture which so impresses you: well, that surprises me. Surely you realize that I\u0027m not the designer? I got all this from a Berliner who died back in 1933. A Bauhaus student who never did make it when he was alive, but he\u0027s designed some beautiful stuff since then. I\u0027m a Necroscope, like you, remember? All of the very simple, very efficient systems you see in use here were given to me by the dead of your own world! Don\u0027t you realize how far you could have gone, the things you could have done, if you hadn\u0027t spent the last eight years of your life tracking me?\u0027\n Harry shook his head, still a little dazed by what his son had shown him, by what he\u0027d been told. \u0027See,\u0027 he finally said, perhaps a little desperately, \u0027that\u0027s another thing. Eight years, you said. Now, in my mind you\u0027re a boy, an eight-year-old boy. In fact I\u0027ve prided myself in picturing you that way, in imagining what you\u0027d be like. It would have been far easier to think of you as a baby, which is how I remember you. But I made myself see you as you\u0027d be now - or as I thought you\u0027d be. And... and just look how you are! I still can\u0027t get over it.\u0027 He shook his head again.\n \u0027I\u0027ve explained that.\u0027\n \u0027What, how you tricked me?\u0027 Harry didn\u0027t try to disguise the bitterness in his tone. \u0027How you not only crossed the divide between universes but displaced yourself in time, too? You went back in time! Long before you were born, and long before I lost you, while I was growing up you were growing up too - here! Just exactly how old are you, anyway?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m twenty-four, Harry.\u0027\n Harry nodded, sharply. \u0027Your mother\u0027s now fifteen years my senior! Not that she\u0027d recognize me, anyway. And... and you have looked after her. That was always one of my biggest worries: that she be looked after. But through all of those years I didn\u0027t know! Couldn\u0027t you have let me know, just once?\u0027\n \u0027And prolong the agony, Harry? So that you\u0027d always be there, just one step behind us?\u0027\n Harry grimaced, turned away. \u0027I noticed you\u0027ve skipped the \"father\" bit, too. You\u0027re a man, not the boy I expected. You wear that damned golden mask, so that I can\u0027t even see your face. You\u0027re ... a stranger! Yes, we\u0027re like strangers. Well, I suppose that\u0027s the way it had to be. I mean, we\u0027re hardly father and son, are we? Let\u0027s face it, I\u0027m not all that much older than you, now am I?\u0027\n Harry Jnr sighed. \u0027I know I\u0027ve hurt you. I knew it all the time you were chasing me.\u0027\n \u0027But you kept running?\u0027\n \u0027I might have come back, but... oh, there were a lot of things. Mother wasn\u0027t improving; there were good places I could take her, where she\u0027d be happy; many reasons for not coming back. One day you\u0027ll understand.\u0027\n Harry felt something of his son\u0027s sadness. Yes, there was a sadness in him. He nodded again, but not so sharply now. For long moments he wrestled with his emotions. In the end blood won. \u0027Anyway,\u0027 he relaxed, took a deep breath, somehow managed to grin, \u0027just how did you do it?\u0027\n Harry Jnr had felt the tension go out of his father, knew he\u0027d been forgiven. He, too, relaxed. \u0027Time-travel, you mean? But you did it too, and long before me - relatively speaking.\u0027\n \u0027I was immaterial - literally. I was incorporeal, al! aura. You\u0027re flesh and blood. Mobius reckons it can\u0027t be done. It would create too many irresolvable paradoxes.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s right,\u0027 Harry Jnr nodded. \u0027In the purely physical sense - in any entirely physical universe - it can\u0027t be done.\u0027\n Are you telling me there are other sorts of universe?\u0027\n \u0027You know of at least one.\u0027\n Harry felt he\u0027d had this conversation before. \u0027The Mobius Continuum? But we\u0027ve already agreed that - \u0027\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 his son cut in, \u0027I\u0027ll tell you. You took the universe you knew and gave it a Mobius half-twist. You did to space-time what your mentor had done to a strip of paper. And the ability to do that came down to me. But let\u0027s face it, you always knew I\u0027d go one better than that. Well, I did. I took the Mobius Continuum itself and did to it what Felix Klein did to his bottle! That allowed me to break the time barrier and retain a physical identity, and come through to this place. But you know, this is only one place...\u0027\n Harry said nothing, just stood very still and absorbed what his son had said. There were more places, more worlds, an infinite number. Just as space and time were limitless, so were the spaces in between space and time.\n Now Harry knew what Darcy Clarke had meant when he said he felt like he stood in the presence of an alien. Harry Jnr was that far ahead! Or was he?\n \u0027Son - \u0027 said Harry eventually, \u0027 - tell me: are you still vulnerable?\u0027\n \u0027Vulnerable?\u0027\n \u0027Can you be hurt - physically?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 Harry Jnr answered, and he sighed again. \u0027I\u0027m vulnerable, and never more so than now. In about one hundred hours it will be sundown again. And that\u0027s when I\u0027ll discover just how vulnerable I am.\u0027\n Harry frowned. \u0027Do you want to explain?\u0027\n \u0027Just like the Wamphyri have their spies, so I have mine. And I get ... a feel for what the opposition is up to. This place has been under observation for months, close scrutiny. Bats on high; trogs down below, on the plain; even Wamphyri mentalists trying to wriggle into my mind - as they\u0027ve doubtless got into the minds of my Travellers. All of which corroborates things that Zek Foener has already told me. But what reads can be read, you know? What observes can be observed.\u0027\n \u0027An attack?\u0027 his father frowned. \u0027But you told me they\u0027d tried that before, with no success. So what\u0027s different now?\u0027\n \"This time they\u0027re united,\u0027 Harry Jnr answered. This time they\u0027ll all come! Their combined army will be massive. Three dozen warriors; countless trogs; all the Lords and their lieutenants. Shaithis has stirred them up.\u0027\n \u0027But... you can get out of it,\u0027 Harry was bewildered, saw no real problem. \u0027You know the way - all of the ways! We can all be long gone from here.\u0027\n Harry Jnr smiled a sad smile. \u0027No,\u0027 he shook his head. \u0027You can, and the others, the Travellers and trogs -whoever wants to go. But I can\u0027t. This is my place.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll defend it?\u0027 Harry shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027\n \u0027But you will, father. You will...\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-21.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
