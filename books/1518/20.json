Not knowing he dreamed, it seemed to him that he had always existed in this timeless, lightless limbo, and that now someone called to him from far, far away.\\n\\n Harry! Harry! You\u0027re asleep, Harry Keogh - but the dead are awake! They\u0027ve begged a boon of me - of me! -whom hitherto they shunned utterly. And I have agreed to talk to you; but when I sought you out, I discovered only a sleeping mind. Jumbled memories and dreams and intricate mind-puzzles. Pictures of an existence beyond existence! A strange thing, your sleeping mind, Harry, and not one with which I may readily converse. So stir yourself! Faethor Ferenczy offers his services...\\n\\n Faethor? Harry snapped awake, sat bolt upright in his bed. Cold sweat drenched his brow, slimed his trembling limbs. A nightmare, yes: he\u0027d dreamed that Faethor Ferenczy called to him in his sleep. A man shouldn\u0027t dream about creatures like Faethor, not even when they were dead and no longer capable of mischief. A dream like that was the worst possible omen. But -\\n\\n A dream? The glutinous, far-away voice sounded again in Harry\u0027s Mobius-orientated mind. A nightmare? Hardly flattering, Harry! And Faethor\u0027s ancient, dead-undead mental chuckle came across all the miles between, came unerringly, tingling at the edges of Harry\u0027s still sluggish perceptions. But he was awake now, and the thing was no longer nightmare but reality. It was his business; it was what a Necroscope is all about; and now that he knew it was real it was no longer frightening. His limbs stopped shaking and he peered about the room. The blinds were drawn but slices of light made faded bands on the wall opposite the windows. An electric bedside clock said that the time was three in the afternoon.\\n\\n \u0027Faethor?\u0027 Harry said. \u0027The last time I spoke to you was at your old place under the Moldavian Alps. At that time I got the impression I\u0027d heard the last from you. Has something changed that? Anyway, I\u0027m still in your debt, so if there\u0027s something...?\u0027\\n\\n What? the other\u0027s dark chuckle was sly now, insinuating. Something you can do for me? That\u0027s a fine macabre sense of humour you have there, Harry! No, there\u0027s nothing you can do for me. But perhaps there is something 1 can do for you. Didn\u0027t you hear what I said? Were you that deeply asleep? I said that the teeming dead have begged my assistance, and that I have agreed to help -if I can.\\n\\n \u0027Eh? The dead, talking to you?\u0027 Harry slowly shook his head in astonishment. \u0027There must be something they want pretty badly.\u0027\\n\\n Aye, but not for themselves, Harry - for you! They\u0027ve spoken to me of a quest, your quest, and asked for my guidance. And in this they\u0027ve shown a deal more wisdom than you. For who would know better the secret source of vampires than an ex-member of the Wamphyri himself, eh?\\n\\n Harry gaped. The source of vampires! The place where they originated! The world in which they were spawned, to come through into this world - as they had now started to come through the gate in Perchorsk!\\n\\n \u0027And do you know this secret source?\u0027 Harry couldn\u0027t conceal the eagerness in his voice and thoughts. \u0027Did you yourself come from that place?\u0027\\n\\n Myself? Was I once an inhabitant of that world of vampire legend? Ah, no, Harry - but my grandfather was.\\n\\n \u0027Your grandfather? Do you know where he lies, where his remains are buried?\u0027\\n\\n Buried? Old Belos Pheropzis? Alas, no, Harry. The Romans crucified and burned him a hundred years before your Christ. And my father: the last word I had of him was that he was lost at sea, somewhere off the mouths of the Danube in the Black Sea, in the Year 547. He was a mercenary for the Ostrogoths against Justinian, but of course he was on the wrong side. Ah, we Wamphyri were a fierce lot in our day! There was a living to be made, if you\u0027d the stomach for it.\\n\\n Then how can you help me?\u0027 Harry was perplexed. \u0027It seems to me that something like a thousand years separates your grandfather\u0027s era and yours. Whatever he knew about his origins - about this source world - must have died with him.\u0027\\n\\n But there are legends, Harry! There are memories, stories Old Belos told his son Waldemar, which he in turn passed down to me. They are as fresh now in my mind as they were the day I heard them. I kept them fresh, for they were the only Wamphyri history I was ever likely to know. I was still in thrall to my father at that time. If Thibor, that ingrate, had ever spent his apprenticeship with me, then I would have passed the legends down to him. But of course he never did. Now, if you in your turn would learn these things - which might well provide the clues you need to complete your quest - then come to me in my place and talk to me, as we talked once before.\\n\\n Faethor\u0027s voice was faint now. Killed in a bombing raid in World War II and burned to ashes, what was left of him had seeped into the earth where once stood his house on the outskirts of Ploiesti toward Bucharest. It must be an effort for one such as he to speak across all these miles, after all this time. On the other hand, Harry was well aware of the devious nature of the vampire - of all vampires. To his knowledge they rarely did anything which was not of benefit to themselves. But there again, in the past Faethor had not been orthodox. Harry could never \u0027like\u0027 or ever really \u0027trust\u0027 him, but he did in a way respect him.\\n\\n \u0027No strings?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Strings? I\u0027m a dead thing, Harry. Nothing remains of me but my voice. And only you can hear it - and the dead, of course, when they choose to listen. Even my voice is fading with the years. But... (Harry sensed his shrug) do as you will. I am merely respecting the wishes of the dead.\\n\\n Harry would have to be satisfied with that. \u0027I\u0027ll come,\u0027 he told the other. \u0027But as well as hungry for knowledge, I\u0027m plain hungry too! Give me an hour and I\u0027ll be there.\u0027\\n\\n Take your time, Faethor answered. I\u0027ve plenty of it. But do you remember the way? His voice was dwindling now, shrinking into deep distances of mind.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I remember it well enough!\u0027\\n\\n Then I\u0027ll wait for you. And then, perhaps, the Great Majority will see fit to leave me in peace...\\n\\n Harry washed and shaved, had a change of clothes, \u0027breakfasted\u0027 and contacted E-Branch. He quickly told Darcy Clarke what he\u0027d done, and what he was about to do. Clarke offered a cautionary \u0027take care\u0027 and Harry was ready.\\n\\n He used the Mobius Continuum and went to Ploiesti.\\n\\n The scene was much the same as it had been eight years earlier: Faethor\u0027s house on the outskirts of the town was one of several burned-out shells lying half-buried in heaps of overgrown rubble, stony corpses in what was otherwise open countryside. It was dark here, around 6:50 p.m. Middle European Time, but there was still enough light for Harry to find himself a tumbled wall and take a seat. And he had remembered the way: he could feel Faethor\u0027s presence lying like a shroud on the place, albeit one which was slowly returning to dust. A very faint nimbus of light glowed on the western horizon, beyond the Carpathians in the direction of home.\\n\\n All around Harry was desolation, made worse by the feel of winter in the air. He shivered, but entirely because of the chill he could feel slowly working its way into his bones. In summer this place would have a certain wild beauty, when the old bomb craters would be masked by flowers and unchecked brambles, and the skeletal walls covered with lush ivy. In the winter, however, the snow would bring the perspective back to gaunt, monochrome reality. The devastation would be obvious, incapable of disguise. It would always be a reminder, and that was probably why the Romanians would never rebuild here.\\n\\n One of the reasons, anyway, Faethor agreed. But I have always liked to believe that I was the main reason. I don\u0027t want people building here. Since Thibor destroyed my old place I\u0027ve had several homes, but this was the last of them. This is where I am, so to speak. So now, when people come nosing around and I feel their footfalls -\\n\\n \u0027 - You sort of gloom over the place. You exert an influence, your aura.\u0027 You\u0027ve noticed.\\n\\n Harry shivered again, but still only from the cold. \u0027How about your legends, Faethor?\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t like to rush you, but I\u0027ve never yet spoken to one of your sort who told me anything in plain, simple language! And time is precious. It could be that lives are at stake.\u0027\\n\\n At \u0027stake\u0027? An unfortunate choice of words. Do you mean human lives? In that other world? Ah, but they always have been!\\n\\n \u0027I mean lives which are important to me. You see, I think people have found a way into that place, that source world. Some of whom are, or were, very dear to me.\u0027\\n\\n He sensed Faethor\u0027s nod (for the fact is that people nod 417\\n\\n with their minds as well as their heads). So I have been informed - er, by the dead, of course. Very well, the legends:\\n\\n \u0027Wait,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027First tell me, what\u0027s in this for you? Oh, I know you\u0027ve said there are no strings attached, but still I can\u0027t imagine you\u0027ll help me out of the goodness of your heart.\u0027\\n\\n Faethor\u0027s chuckle grew into a laugh. Not a pleasant thing. Ah! - but you know us well, Harry Keogh. Very well, I\u0027ll tell you:\\n\\n My grandfather, Belos, was exiled from his aerie, his world, his heritage, by the Wamphyri. He had grown too strong. They feared him mightily, and when their chance came they tricked, entrapped, expelled him. His lands and properties were stolen and he found himself here, in this world. He wasn\u0027t the first or the last, and if things don\u0027t change there may well be others still to come. Now I never knew Belos, who was dead before Waldemar passed on his egg to me, but I do know that if he had not been so badly treated then I would now be one of the Wamphyri in my rightful place - in the source world! When they expelled him they not only stole his heritage but denied Waldemar his after him and also mine. For that reason, and despite the years flown in between, Belos is worth avenging.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re going to help me find my way into that world for revenge?\u0027 Harry frowned. \u0027I don\u0027t intend to look anyone up for you, Faethor. As I see it, it will be a case of in, rescue, retreat. I won\u0027t be staying there long enough to write off any old scores.\u0027\\n\\n Oh? And you know all about this place you\u0027re searching for, do you? (A certain amusement in Faethor\u0027s tone.) Get in, rescue your loved ones, or whatever, and get out again. As simple as that...\\n\\n \u0027Something like that, yes.\u0027 But Harry was less certain now.\\n\\n Again Faethor\u0027s shrug. Well... possibly. But I see it differently. For after all, you are Harry Keogh! And the fact is that in your use of your special talents you have been a dire force against vampires in this world. You\u0027ve dealt with my treacherous son Thibor, with Boris Dragosani, Yulian Bodescu - the list is impressive. My feeling is that when you enter into the source world, then things are almost bound to happen. I believe that you are the catalyst which will change, perhaps even destroy, the old balance. So all I require of you is this: that if the time should come and someone should ask you, \u0027Who are you?\u0027 - then you will answer him that Belos sent you. Is that too much to ask?\\n\\n \u0027No, you have a deal,\u0027 Harry agreed. \u0027So now tell me what you know. First about Perchorsk.\u0027 Eh? (Surprise.) I never heard of it. Harry quickly explained.\\n\\n That may well be one way into, or out of, the source world, Faethor answered, but it is not the old route. Now listen: this is what Old Belos told my father, which he in turn told me. The Wamphyri sent him into the hell-lands (this world) through a shining white door in the shape of a sphere. Yes, the very duplicate of this sphere you\u0027ve mentioned at Perchorsk. But Perchorsk is in the upper Urals, and Belos\u0027s exit-point was far removed from there. \u0027So where did Belos surface?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Surface\u0027 is the wrong word. Rather he \u0027descended\u0027. Inside the sphere he fell. He was aware of falling - as if into hell! It was as if he plunged down the throat of a great white luminous shaft whose walls were so far distant he could not see them. He fell, and yet at no great speed, or so he believed. And he must have been correct in that belief, for when he emerged he was still falling! He fell out of the sphere - the gate of entry - into this world. \u0027Where?\u0027 Harry was eager again.\\n\\n Underground!\\n\\n \u0027Like at Perchorsk?\u0027\\n\\n Unlike Perchorsk. Belos gathered his senses, looked all around. The sphere he had fallen through was embedded in the ceiling of a great horizontal borehole, over a ledge of smooth dripstone. Through the bed of the bore rushed a black, gurgling river. Belos knew not where it came from, nor where it went. All around the sphere where it hung suspended, great holes were apparent in the ceiling - like these magmass holes of yours at Perchorsk. Likewise in the ledge where Belos had landed. The extent of the cave, and its ledge, was not great. Where the river rushed from cave into darkness, the gap between ceiling and water came down to a few inches. The ledge was large enough for a man to walk maybe ten paces this way, ten paces that, before it narrowed down and smoothed into the glistening wall of the bore. There was no way out. Or there was, if a man had the stomach for it.\\n\\n \u0027A subterranean sump!\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n Exactly. The river might run for miles. It might never surface at all! That was Belos\u0027s predicament...\\n\\n Others had been there before him, and some of them were still there. He found their remains, ossified. Things he called \u0027trogs\u0027, and \u0027Travellers\u0027, even the skulls and mummified remains of Wamphyri, who\u0027d preferred to sit here on the ledge and wither rather than risk the unknown. But Belos\u0027s heart was bigger than that.\\n\\n \u0027He dared the river?\u0027 Harry was fascinated.\\n\\n Faethor\u0027s shrug. What else could he do? First he tried to re-enter the sphere, of course, but it rejected him. When he held up his arms to plunge them into its light, they were repelled. The Gate into the hell-lands had closed on him. But to sit here with these others and stiffen into stone was not his way. He would go now, while he still had all of his great strength.\\n\\n Now, Harry, I suppose you have heard this myth, how vampires fear running water?\\n\\n \u0027Next to you,\u0027 said Harry, Tm the world\u0027s greatest expert on vampires! Or as much of one as you\u0027ll find, anyway. You\u0027re going to tell me the myth stems from this underground river, which the Wamphyri had to overcome to make their way to the surface of this world, right?\u0027\\n\\n Correct.\\n\\n Thibor had a different explanation.\u0027\\n\\n Faethor sighed. Thibor didn\u0027t know, as I\u0027ve explained. He could have learned so much from me, that one. But not knowing, he obviously invented an explanation. Devious, as you\u0027ve said.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve said that of all of you,\u0027 Harry reminded. \u0027But you\u0027ve side-tracked. Get back to the point.\u0027\\n\\n Very well, but the underground river is the source of that particular myth. A vampire is flesh and blood and bone, Harry. Immerse him in water long enough and he will die. Now let me get on:\\n\\n Belos braved the river, was washed along downstream. At times his head was above water, but there were other desperate moments when the gap narrowed to nothing, so that he was pushed under. It seemed a long time before the ceiling receded, before natural light returned, glimmering at the end of the watercourse. Then came the resurgence, into a basin, which emptied itself into a sluggish river. But this time, as I\u0027ve said, on the surface. Bedraggled and a little battered, coughing up the river water until he thought he\u0027d dislodge his lungs, at last Old Belos was in this world!\\n\\n The time - the era - was some three hundred years before your Christ. And the place...\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 Harry could scarcely contain himself.\\n\\n As the crow flies: one hundred and seventy miles from the very spot where you now stand!\\n\\n And indeed Harry was on his feet. \u0027Where, exactly?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n Near Radujevac, on the Dunarea, Faethor told him. Or on the banks of the Danube, as it might be better known to you. That\u0027s where you\u0027ll find this resurgence. It is the source of the legend, and the legend is the source of the Wamphyri! Will you go there now, at once?\\n\\n \u0027Now? No,\u0027 Harry shook his head. \u0027Tonight I plan. I go there tomorrow.\u0027 He stood there in the darkness and sighed.\\n\\n A weight off your shoulders, Harry?\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps - or maybe it\u0027s just one more burden.\u0027\\n\\n I have kept my part of the bargain.\\n\\n \u0027And I\u0027ll keep mine, if the time should come. Meanwhile, you have my thanks.\u0027\\n\\n Aye, and those of the teeming dead. Hah! Talk about legends! But your own legend is spreading, Harry. And soon to spread much farther, I think. I bid you farewell\\n\\n Harry beat his arms across his body, loosening the stiffness in his joints and driving out the cold. Then:\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye, Faethor,\u0027 he said. And as always, the Mobius Continuum was waiting to welcome him...\\n\\n Harry\u0027s plans and preparations were the simplest of things, easily carried out. Back at E-Branch HQ he told Darcy Clarke what he required, and while the items were being assembled he brought Clarke up to date and went a little deeper into detailing what the boss of E-Branch already knew.\\n\\n When he\u0027d finished Clarke said: \u0027Let\u0027s get this right. You\u0027re going to Romania, the Danube in the vicinity of Radujevac, where you\u0027ll travel upstream along the course of an underground river, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Somewhere up there you expect to find a Gate like the one at Perchorsk, except there won\u0027t be anyone who\u0027ll shoot you dead on sight.\u0027\\n\\n There might well be people there,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027A handful, maybe, but they won\u0027t shoot at me. They won\u0027t be able to. If I know my business they\u0027ll welcome me; they may even have valuable information for me.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke looked at him and thought: Dear God! - he\u0027s human but he\u0027s so bloody inhuman! Out loud, quietly, he said: \u0027Dead people, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Corpses, yes. Maybe not even that. Maybe just memories of people.\u0027\\n\\n Now Clarke shuddered, long and visibly and violently. He was remembering the Bodescu affair, a time when he\u0027d witnessed with his own eyes the unbelievable extent of Harry\u0027s power over the dead. Or rather, the result of their respect for him. In fact it hadn\u0027t been Harry who called up the dead that time but his son, the then infant Harry Jnr. But Harry could do it too, when he had the need.\\n\\n Finally Clarke steadied himself and continued. \u0027And having found this Gate, then you\u0027ll use it to go ... wherever! To another world, the place where your wife and son are. And presumably Jazz Simmons, too.\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027And Zek Foener, and maybe one or two others. If they\u0027re still alive, and you know I believe they are, then I should have some friends there -1 think. But I may also have enemies. At least one, anyway: a KGB thug called Karl Vyotsky.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But assuming everything works out OK, then you\u0027ll speak to Brenda, Harry Jnr, and when that\u0027s done you\u0027ll see who wants to come back with you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Something like that, except I still don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a way back. Remember, I know that nothing from this world has ever got back here, and I know that nothing that\u0027s come here can ever go back there! Does that make sense? Anyway, that\u0027s the way it is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In short, you\u0027re risking your life.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you want it done or don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I want it done, yes; in my own way I\u0027m as curious as you are. And the next thing I want is to see Perchorsk closed down. Even if they don\u0027t make those things there, still it\u0027s a time-bomb.\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027I feel the same way about it - but I have Viktor Luchov\u0027s word that nothing will ever escape from Perchorsk again. That\u0027s good enough for me.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke gave a snort. \u0027Harry, your word is good enough for me any time, but I\u0027m just one small cog in a very big wheel. I don\u0027t suppose that anyone is going to take preemptive or any other sort of action against Perchorsk. Especially not now, in this new climate of \"political understanding,\" but if something else does escape...\u0027 He threw up his hands.\\n\\n \u0027Then it would be right out of your hands, I know,\u0027 Harry answered.\\n\\n Again Clarke\u0027s snort. \u0027Right out of control is more like it!\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n \u0027Well, and that\u0027s another reason for my going in,\u0027 Harry was almost fatalistic about it. To see if there\u0027s anything we can do about it - which is maybe better done from the other side.\u0027\\n\\n The two were silent a while, then Clarke said: \u0027Harry, the rest of your gear will take a little time to get hold of. But it\u0027s being done. It\u0027s very late now and I\u0027m overdue for my bed. I\u0027ll catch a couple of hours and be here to see you off in the morning. Before I go, is there anything else I can do for you? And what will you do with yourself for the rest of the night?\u0027\\n\\n Harry shrugged. \u0027Oh, I\u0027m not tired,\u0027 he said, \u0027but I will try to get some sleep later. It\u0027s silly, I know, but I\u0027d rather tackle that underground river during the daylight hours. I mean, I could go tonight, but I don\u0027t fancy that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Silly? What\u0027s silly about it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because day or night will make no difference down there. It\u0027s pitch dark all the time. It\u0027s just that I\u0027ll feel happier knowing it\u0027s daylight outside. But anyway, before I do anything I have to speak to Mobius again.\u0027\\n\\n Lost for words, Clarke shook his head. Harry always had this effect on him. \u0027You know,\u0027 he finally said, \u0027we\u0027re both part of the same world, you and I, but when you talk like that, so naturally, matter-of-factly - about the dead, and about these talents of yours, the Mobius Continuum and what all; the way you say: \"I\u0027m going to speak to Mobius\", just like that - Jesus, it\u0027s like you\u0027re an alien! Or else it\u0027s like I\u0027m a small kid again. I mean, I know what you can do, I\u0027ve experienced it. But still I sometimes doubt my own senses.\u0027\\n\\n Harry smiled, open and honest. \u0027And you\u0027re the boss of E-Branch!\u0027 he said. \u0027Maybe you\u0027ve got the wrong job, Darcy.\u0027\\n\\n He waited until Clarke had left before he went to see Mobius...\\n\\n In Leipzig it was 10:30 a.m. and the graveyard was locked for the night. But of course Harry didn\u0027t go in through the gates but through a door, went to see the man who\u0027d taught him to unlock all such doors.\\n\\n Harry, my boy, I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come, said Mobius. I\u0027ve been doing some thinking about this conjectural parallel universe of yours.\\n\\n \u0027It gets less conjectural all the time,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027Only its nature is conjectural now.\u0027 And he quickly brought the dead mathematician up to date.\\n\\n Fascinating! said Mobius. And indeed it confirms my own thoughts on the matter.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I have to admit it only baffles me,\u0027 said Harry. There is light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak, but ... I mean if there are two gates on this side, why does there only appear to be one on the other?\u0027\\n\\n Only one? What makes you say that?\\n\\n \u0027Faethor talked about a shining white door in the shape of a sphere. One door. If there\u0027d been two, wouldn\u0027t Old Belos have mentioned the fact?\u0027\\n\\n Well, whether he did or didn\u0027t, there are two, I assure you. Mobius sounded convinced. Two on this side, and two on that. I can explain the principle very simply, without going into a lot of mathematical detail.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m all ears,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n Right, Mobius got down to business. Let\u0027s consider these \u0027gateways\u0027 a little less intensely, a little more basically. These \u0027doors\u0027 which defy the physical laws of that state which we call space-time. We know there are several sorts, and that all of them warp the \u0027skin\u0027 of this space-time dimension. Modern scientists readily admit of one such: the black hole. And they make guesses about another sort, which they\u0027ve termed white holes. In fact a current theory has it that white and black holes are two ends of the same tunnel. The black sucks material in, and the white expels it. Agreed?\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027So I understand,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Very well. Now, even if the theory is wrong and they\u0027re not two sides of the same coin, there remains one factor common to both.\\n\\n \u0027Which is?\u0027\\n\\n That they\u0027re both one-way systems.\u0027 Once you enter a black hole, you don\u0027t get out again. And once you\u0027ve been expelled from a white hole, there\u0027s no way back in. The way I see it, the same thing applies to your grey holes: this Gate at Perchorsk, and the second Gate which you believe lies somewhere along the course of this underground river.\\n\\n \u0027One-way systems?\u0027\\n\\n Each of them! Emphasis on \u0027each\u0027. You go in through one, and you come out through the other!\\n\\n It stopped Harry dead in his tracks. Finally he said: That\u0027s brilliant! Once you use a Gate, it\u0027s out of bounds. Having passed you through, it won\u0027t accept you again, no matter which end you started out from. But a second gate will! So all I have to do is find the second Gate. In fact, I already know where it is! It\u0027s the Gate the Wamphyri have been using to send their monstrosities through to Perchorsk.\u0027\\n\\n Ah, but that\u0027s what it is, not where it is, said Mobius.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a step in the right direction, anyway,\u0027 Harry replied. Then he sobered a little. There is however one small drawback. If I come through that Gate into Perchorsk, they\u0027ll not only shoot me, they\u0027ll probably fry me, too!\u0027\\n\\n Ah-! but here Mobius could only shrug.\\n\\n Thanks, anyway,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027You\u0027ve confirmed what I was already suspecting: that there have to be two Gates. The Wamphyri have been using one for thousands of years, and now they\u0027ve started using the new one, which Luchov and his crowd inadvertently blasted into being at Perchorsk. It\u0027s the only explanation. So ... if you\u0027ll excuse me now I\u0027ll be on my way. I have to say goodbye to my mother. She\u0027d never forgive me if I did something like this without telling her.\u0027 He sighed. \u0027She\u0027ll want to try to talk me out of it - even knowing she can\u0027t. But... she\u0027s like that.\u0027\\n\\n All mothers are like that, Harry, said Mobius, very seriously. Good luck, my boy.\\n\\n But in fact, luck would have very little to do with it...\\n\\n The next morning Darcy Clarke met Harry at E-Branch HQ in London, and while Harry checked his equipment, making sure he knew how to use it, Clarke took the opportunity to pass on a little information.\\n\\n \u0027About this subterranean tributary of the Danube,\u0027 he said. \u0027Harry, it\u0027s a death-trap! I had it checked out overnight. Our man in Bucharest looked into it for you. The place is known well enough and we have its exact location. There are newspaper clippings concerning it, various bits of documentation. The locals have an immemorial dislike for it. In 1966 a couple of cavers took it on. It was summer and the tributary was running dry at the time. Four hours after they started in there was a flash flood up in the mountains. One body was washed out, the other lost forever. And these were experts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And they were walking and swimming,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I won\u0027t be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said I was going up to the watercourse, but I didn\u0027t say how.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke gasped, \u0027You\u0027ll use the Mobius Continuum?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why the wet-suit, aqualung and all?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just in case.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke fell silent for a moment, then said: \u0027I was only trying to help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I appreciate it,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027But I know my own business best.\u0027\\n\\n Ten minutes later he took up his gear in a waterproof kit-bag and went to Radujevac. From the outskirts of the town he caught a taxi into the countryside close to the location Clarke had given him. He paid his driver with money from the same source. With his bag over his shoulder he set off down a country track, eventually arriving at his destination. It was a wild place and there was no one around. Harry dumped his kit in a copse and covered the bag with dead branches, then returned to the site of the resurgence.\\n\\n It was in the base of a cliff, overgrown with ivy, where limestone outcrops glistened with moisture. To the north-east stood the grey, forbidding Carpathians, and to the south sloping wooded countryside. Harry stood on the banks of the pool under the cliffs and looked again at the mountains, then down at the dark water where it gurgled into view from untold caverns of gloom. It issued from the mouth of a cave. This was the spot where Old Belos of the Wamphyri first entered our world. And others like him. And between here and those legendary mountains, somewhere underground, lay a gateway to an alien world. Now it was Harry\u0027s task to pin-point that Gate as accurately as possible before setting out up the river to find it.\\n\\n He checked again that there was no one around, no one to see him take his departure. The place was silent, wooded, where only the birds sang and the cold water gurgled. But this time Harry was well muffled-up and didn\u0027t feel the cold.\\n\\n He picked a spot in the foothills to the north-east, went there via the Mobius Continuum. The door from which he exited was the same as always: a \u0027hole\u0027 in the universe, with nothing to distinguish it from hundreds of other doors Harry had used. Harry moved again, even closer to the looming peaks. But this time when he emerged, the \u0027edges\u0027 of his door shimmered a little. It was the warning he\u0027d been looking for, which told him he was close.\\n\\n Very close, Harry, said a dead voice in his mind, surprising him. It felt like someone had come up close behind him and whispered in his ear.\\n\\n \u0027Do I know you?\u0027 He scanned the countryside around,\u0027 looked down on distant towns, Radujevac, Cujmir, Recea. They were smoky, wintry smudges on his horizon.\\n\\n No, but I know you. Your mother has been making enquiries on your behalf.\\n\\n Harry sighed. \u0027She means well,\u0027 he said. \u0027Has she disturbed you?\u0027\\n\\n Not at all. I\u0027m happy to help. You intend to travel the length of the Radujevac resurgence, right? The voice was full of excitement, eagerness. Which was what gave its owner away.\\n\\n \u0027You were a caver,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027You died back in the summer of 1966, somewhere up that underground river.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s me, said the other, a little sadly. And I never did get to finish the job. My name is Gari Nadiscu, and if I\u0027d made it the bore would have been named after me: the Nadiscu Route. It was a dream. Maybe you can finish it for me?\\n\\n Harry said: \u0027Wait,\u0027 and transferred to the Mobius Continuum. \u0027Now talk to me,\u0027 he said. \u0027I want to get closer to you.\u0027 He followed the other\u0027s thoughts, emerged at the very foot of the mountains. And again the Mobius door shimmered, more than before, confirming Harry\u0027s belief that he was moving closer to the gate.\\n\\n \u0027You didn\u0027t do badly,\u0027 he told Nadiscu. \u0027You covered, oh, maybe nine miles before that flood hit you! Are you still down there?\u0027 He glanced at the stony mountain soil under his feet. \u0027I mean, is there anything left... you know? How did you get trapped? Your companion was washed out.\u0027\\n\\n Trapped, answered the other, grimly. That\u0027s the right word, Harry. I crawled onto a ledge. There was a crack in the wall. As the water rose I climbed deeper into the crack. Finally I got jammed, couldn\u0027t move. I was wearing a lung, of course. It was a bad time. I lasted as long as my air...\\n\\n That must have been pretty terrible,\u0027 Harry commiserated. But:\\n\\n Don\u0027t waste time on that, said the other. You\u0027ve things to do. How can I help you?\\n\\n Two things,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027One: what was the course of the river up to the time you... when the flood came? And two: how deep are you, as you calculate it, under the surface?\u0027\\n\\n Nadiscu supplied the answers and Harry thanked him. \u0027I won\u0027t be looking for the river\u0027s source,\u0027 he admitted, \u0027for it\u0027s a different kind of source that interests me. But if it all works out I\u0027ll come back some time and tell you how far I got. OK?\u0027\\n\\n Thanks, Harry. I\u0027d appreciate that.\\n\\n Harry used the Continuum and moved on into the mountains, exiting on a steep, pine-covered slope. This time the interference was such that Harry knew he was almost there. Directly below him, at some great depth in the roots of the mountains, the Gate to the world of the Wamphyri was waiting for him.\\n\\n He calculated the distance to his starting point, fixed his location firmly in his head - his location not only in the mundane world but also in the metaphysical Mobius Continuum. It was a sort of mental triangulation. And then he went back to the copse where he\u0027d hidden his gear.\\n\\n Half an hour later, dressed in wet-suit and aqualung, equipped with fins and a powerful waterproof torch, Harry slipped into the water and conjured a Mobius door. No shimmer here. He moved upstream, emerging in darkness with his flippered feet on a pebbly bed. The darkness was absolute and there was a current strong enough to cause Harry to lean against it. He used his torch to scan the way ahead, its powerful beam cutting the dark like a knife. On the next jump his feet were still on the bottom but the bore had narrowed down, the water was chin-deep, the way ahead convoluted.\\n\\n And so Harry proceeded.\\n\\n Sometimes he swam; at other times he was underwater, where there was no gap between ceiling and river; occasionally the bore was wide as a cathedral and the water shallow. Almost before he knew it he found Gari Nadiscu in the crevice where he\u0027d trapped himself. There was very little of him left: a single flipper and an air tank half-buried in shingle, and a trapped thigh bone.\\n\\n Harry could have come to Nadiscu direct, he saw that now, but there could have been hazards. The caver had been trapped in a tight spot; Harry hadn\u0027t wanted to emerge in a cramped, difficult location. Also, and more importantly, Nadiscu might have been too close to the Gate. Harry had experienced the danger in using the Mobius Continuum close to a Gate; it was to be avoided. No, he\u0027d preferred his own way. If there\u0027d been difficulties, getting out again would have been as easy as conjuring a Mobius door. And this way he\u0027d got used to his system of sighting the way ahead and then jumping there. Which was as well, for beyond this point the route was totally unknown.\\n\\n Now: he and Nadiscu exchanged a few encouraging words, and Harry moved on.\\n\\n Five minutes later, after a series of short jumps, Harry\u0027s exit door shimmered violently and seemed to bend back on itself. Harry emerged in deep water, swimming. He shone his torch ahead. The bore was almost circular, with maybe twelve inches between ceiling and water. He daren\u0027t use the Continuum again and so put all of his efforts to swimming. The current wasn\u0027t much but still it made for hard work.\\n\\n Then, ahead, Harry saw a faintly luminous arc of light. He switched off his torch and hooked it to his belt, using both hands to aid his flippered feet in forging ahead. The arc expanded and the light grew stronger. White light!\\n\\n Harry emerged into the cave of the sphere and gratefully hauled himself up onto the ledge - where he at once recoiled from what lay upon the moist floor! It was a headless corpse, running rapidly to decay. The head, also sloughing flesh, lay some little way along the ledge. \u0027Jesus!\u0027 Harry breathed. He had taken off his demand-valve attachment but now quickly replaced it to breathe bottled air. That was better. Then he examined the corpse more carefully - but without touching it. The severed spinal column was fat, reinforced with extra bone and sinew. It contained in effect two spines! Wamphyri! The head would likewise contain a composite brain, also turning to mush.\\n\\n \u0027Who were you?\u0027 Harry asked it.\\n\\n I was Corlis, of the Lady Karen\u0027s aerie, the other moaned. Alas, I was too ambitious. Now go away - leave me to my misery.\\n\\n Too ambitious?\u0027 Harry gulped. \u0027So it would appear!\u0027 He glanced up at the sphere and quickly looked away. The light was unbearable. From a zippered pocket he took out dark goggles and put them on, then looked all about. A little apart from the corpse lay a modern walkie-talkie radio, somewhat battered, its aerial fully extended. Harry stared at it, shook his head. He could see that it was a Russian model; beyond that it seemed pointless to conjecture.\\n\\n There were various niches in the walls, together with the mouths of many magmass wormholes. When Harry saw what some of these contained, then he remembered Faethor\u0027s - or Belos\u0027s - story.\\n\\n High up in the curved wall, one such sat with its shrivelled legs dangling over the rim of a magmass hole. The thing was mummified, where dripstone had fused its legs to the wall and commenced covering them with gleaming calcium. An eyeless skull, hideously misshapen, leaned out. Frozen in death, its gaping jaws were wolfish, toothed like a carnivore. The creature seemed to leer at Harry with a permanent, imperishable malignancy. He wasn\u0027t much worried; it had leered like that for a long, long time. Vampire killer! it suddenly accused.\\n\\n Harry shrugged. \u0027I can\u0027t deny it. But on that score, it seems you at least have no worries. Nor any of you here.\u0027\\n\\n Now other voices joined the first: Impudent pup! And: This is a private place of the Wamphyri - begone! And: Who are you, to disturb our sleep of centuries?\\n\\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 Harry shrugged, \u0027but I\u0027m not dressed for conversation - polite or otherwise. But I\u0027d better inform you: I know that to a man you\u0027re all exiles. You may have been high and mighty Wamphyri in your own world, but here you\u0027re just crumbling old dead things! That\u0027s how it goes. Now me, I won\u0027t hold your past against you, as long as you don\u0027t hold mine against me.\u0027\\n\\n After a moment of blank astonishment: You dare - !? they cried in one voice.\\n\\n \u0027Now it\u0027s cold in here,\u0027 Harry continued unperturbed. \u0027So I\u0027m going to pick up a change of clothing. If by the time I return you\u0027re feeling more sociable, we can start over and no hard feelings. If not - \u0027 again his shrug. \u0027It\u0027s your loss, as the teeming dead would doubtless testify - if they\u0027d waste their time talking to such as you!\u0027\\n\\n Before they could answer he took up his torch and flippers, slipped back into the water. It was icy cold but it would only be for a moment. He let the river bob him downstream to a safe distance, then conjured a slightly warped door and floated through it. He fixed the location firmly in his mind, went back to the copse and his kit-bag.\\n\\n There he took a long deep swig from a hip flask of brandy, tossed the flask away. He tied a fifty-foot length of nylon cord to the neck of the waterproof bag, went back to the midnight river and exited the Mobius Continuum into the water at the required location. As the kit-bag sank he swam furiously for the cave of the sphere. Climbing back onto the ledge, he hauled in the kit-bag and quickly changed into warm clothes. The bag also contained a heavy, special-issue machine-gun, which he now checked against the possibility of damp or damage. Everything seemed OK.\\n\\n Ahhh - ! He was aware of a concerted mental sighing as he stood on the ledge and paused to wonder if he\u0027d forgotten anything. He comes and goes like a ghost! He has a deal of magic!\\n\\n Harry smiled. \u0027Oh, I\u0027ve got some magic, all right,\u0027 he agreed. \u0027But as for being a ghost... I\u0027m flesh and blood, and it\u0027s you fellows who - \u0027\\n\\n Harry! said a different voice, a very frightened, very primitive, guttural, almost animal voice in his mind. Be careful, Harry Keogh. It\u0027s dangerous to speak to the Wamphyri as you have spoken to them!\\n\\n Harry found the speaker - a squat, dwarfish aboriginal creature - crouched in a cramped cavity apart from the others. A stalagmitic sheath had almost completely enveloped him, so that it seemed to Harry he conversed with what was very nearly a stone statue.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not Wamphyri?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Hah! The others were part amused, part outraged. Him - that! - Wamphyri? A trog, you fool!\\n\\n Trog?\u0027 Harry glanced from the trog to the others and back. \u0027Oh, yes, I remember! I was told I might find a trog or two here. Travellers, too, perhaps?\u0027\\n\\n Travellers, too, Harry, said yet another voice, much more human. But it sounded very distant, that voice, very faint and fading. Alas, we don\u0027t have the same durability as trogs and Wamphyri. I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re little more than memories now.\\n\\n \u0027So, several sorts of people from the world beyond the Gate,\u0027 Harry mused. \u0027And none of you willing to help me, eh?\u0027 He adjusted his goggles, tightened the strap of his weapon across his shoulder. \u0027What, dead these thousands - or at least many hundreds - of years, you trogs and Travellers, and still the Wamphyri oppress you? I\u0027d hoped to ask your advice.\u0027\\n\\n He looked up, gazed at the glaring white surface of the sphere. If he reached up a hand he could touch it.\\n\\n Only ask it! Several Traveller voices spoke up. In our time we fought the Wamphyri. We staked them through their black hearts and burned them. But when they came to power, this is how they avenged themselves. Still, we have no regrets. So speak to us, Harry. We were not primitive, fearful trogs but men!\\n\\n There was pride in their fading voices - then sudden panic as Harry stood on his toes, stretched a straining hand toward the surface of the glaring sphere where its huge globe bulged downward from the ceiling. HARRY -DON\u0027T!\\n\\n Too late - his hand had touched the sphere, broken the surface of its skin. He tried to snatch the hand back, which was about as much use as asking a hurled stone not to return to earth.\\n\\n Harry heard the grim laughter of the Wamphyri, the groans of trogs and Travellers alike - felt himself grasped, drawn up, passed into the sphere. And in a moment the cave and gurgling river had disappeared from sight, and he floated up, up, weightless as a feather in a beam of white light, toward a different place -\\n\\n - A different world! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-20.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
