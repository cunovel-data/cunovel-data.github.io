{"id":62500,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Zek\n Two hours after setting out from the sphere - two lonely, shadowy hours, with only the grunts and groans of his own exertions for company - Jazz Simmons paused for his first real break and found a seat on a tall, flat-topped boulder which gave him good vantage over the terrain all around. He took hard biscuits from his pack and two cubes of dense black chocolate designed for sucking, not biting. Wash these down with a sip of water, and then he\u0027d be on his way again. But now, while he sat here easing his deceptively gangly but powerful frame and catching a breather, there was time to look around a little and consider his position.\n \u0027His position\u0027. That was a laugh! It certainly wasn\u0027t an enviable position: alone in a strange land, with hardtack food sufficient to last a week, enough weaponry to start World War III, and so far nothing to shoot at, blast or burn! Not that he was complaining about that. But again the thought occurred: where were they? Where in hell were this world\u0027s denizens? And when he did eventually find them, or they found him, what would they be like? Which was to assume, of course, that there were others here unlike those he already knew about. Which was to hope so, anyway.\n It was as if his private thoughts were an invocation. Two things occurred simultaneously: first a rim of bright half-moon, rising in the west and turning the sky in that quarter a gold-tinged indigo, showed itself over the peaks on the opposite side of the gorge; and second... second there sounded a far, almost anguished howl, a reverberating, sustained note echoing up to the moon and down again, picked up by kindred throats and passed mournfully on up the pass into the beckoning distance.\n There could be no mistaking cries like that - wolves! And Jazz remembered what he\u0027d been told about Encounter Two. That one had been lame, blind, harmless. These weren\u0027t. Nothing that sounded like that could possibly be in anything other than extremely good health. Which didn\u0027t bode too well for his own!\n Jazz finished eating, washed the gritty chocolate from the back of his throat, adjusted his pack and got down from his rock. Time he was on his way again. But - he paused, then froze in his tracks, stared directly ahead, and up, and up!\n Before, the light from the blister-sun, however feeble, had kept the canyon walls in silhouette; they\u0027d presented only a black, flanking frame to Jazz\u0027s eyes, with the main picture lying directly ahead. That picture had been the false horizon at the head of the saddle, the scree-littered way to it, and the thin arc of bright yellow light beyond; which, Jazz noted, had moved gradually from west to east, until now it was lying in the very corner of his picture.\n When during the last two or three miles he\u0027d turned his gaze away from the sun for a moment, turned his face to the flank and looked up, then, as they\u0027d grown accustomed, his eyes had been able to spy the dark, forested heights, and above them the sharp silver gleam of snow. But in fact he\u0027d had little time for sight-seeing; mainly his attention had been glued to the non-existent trail, picking a way through rocks and fallen jumble, always choosing the easiest way ahead. It had scarcely dawned on him that as he progressed, so indeed there had been something of a trail. In his own world he\u0027d have expected one, and so in this world it had failed to make an impression. Until now.\n But here the gorge was a great deal narrower. Where two hours earlier, at the mouth of the pass, the distance between walls had been something more than a mile, maybe even a mile and a half, here it had narrowed down to less than two hundred yards, almost a bottleneck at the foot of steep canyon walls. The crest of the saddle, as he judged it, was only a quarter-mile ahead now, when at last he\u0027d be able to look down and spy something of the world on the sunlit side of the range.\n What had caused him to freeze was this:\n The moon, rising swiftly over the western side of the gorge, now shone its silvery-yellow light down on the eastern wall. Jazz was close to that side of the gorge, so that the previously silhouetted face seemed to tower almost directly overhead. But no longer in silhouette - no longer a vertical, soaring jut of black rock - the mighty cliff of the canyon had taken on a different aspect entirely.\n Picked out now by the moon in sharp detail, Jazz saw a castle built into the vertiginous heights! A castle, yes, and no way he could be mistaken on this occasion. Where once a wide ledge had scarred the cliff\u0027s face, now the walls of a fortress rose up fantastically to meet the massy overhang of natural stone high overhead. A castle, an outpost, a grimly foreboding keep guarding the pass. And Jazz knew he\u0027d hit upon its purpose here at the first throw: a keep guarding the pass!\n Craning his neck, he took in its awesome moonlit bleakness, the gaunt soullessness of its warlike features. There were battlements, with massive merlons and gaping embrasures; and where towers and turrets were supported by flying buttresses, there yawned the mouths of menacing corbels. Stone arches formed into steps joined parts of the architecture which were otherwise inaccessible, where the natural rock of the cliff bulged or jutted and generally obstructed; flights of stone stairs rose steeply between the many levels, carved deep into the otherwise sheer rock; window holes gloomed like dark eyes in the moon-yellowed stone, frowning down on Jazz where he crouched in the shadows and gazed, and wondered.\n The structure started maybe fifty feet up the cliff face, half-way to the top of a lone, projecting stack. In the chimney between cliff and pillar, stone steps were visible zigzagging upwards to the mouth of a domed cave; presumably the cave was extensive, with its own passageways to the castle proper. Higher still, the fortifications themselves spread outward across the face of the cliff like some strange stone fungus, covering nature\u0027s bastions with the lesser but more purposeful works of ... men? Jazz could only suppose so.\n But whoever had built this aerie, they were not here now. No figures moved in the battlements or on the stairways; no lights shone in the windows, balconies or turrets; no smoke curled from the tall chimneys moulded to the face of the cliff. The place was deserted - maybe. That \u0027maybe\u0027 was because Jazz was sure as he\u0027d ever been that hooded eyes were upon him, studying him where he in turn held his breath and studied the cliff-fashioned castle.\n The lower part of the stack where it stood mainly free of the canyon\u0027s wall was still in shadows, which gradually drew back as the moon rose higher still. Jazz was glad of that moon, for the sun was now plainly declining. When he crossed the crest of the saddle, then perhaps he\u0027d catch up a little with the sun, earn himself maybe an hour or so more of its dim light; but here in the lee of the great grim castle, for the present the moon was his only champion. He moved swiftly forward, going at a lope because of the imagined (?) eyes, sticking to the shadows of boulders where possible and crossing the moonlit gaps between at speed. And presently he came to the base of the stack of weathered rock where it leaned outward a little from the cliff. Or at least, he came to the great wall which surrounded that base.\n The wall was of massive blocks; it stood maybe twelve feet high and was crowned with merlons and embrasures; the mouths of dragons formed spouts for corbel chutes. But the carven dragons were not Earth\u0027s dragons. Jazz swiftly, silently skirted the wall, came to a gate of huge timbers studded with iron and painted with a fearsome crest: the dragon again, with the face and wings of a bat and the body of a wolf! He was reminded of nothing so much as the magmass thing in the tank back at Perchorsk. But this dragon was split down the middle with the menacing darkness of a courtyard - for the great gates stood open a little, inwards. As if in invitation. If so, then Jazz ignored it; he hurried on toward the waning sun, desiring only to put as much distance as possible between himself and this place while there was still light enough to do so.\n Minutes later he began to breathe more easily, reached the crest and was at once bathed in warm, wan sunlight. Shielding his eyes against the sudden light, however hazy, he turned to look back. A quarter-mile away, the castle had merged once more into the face of the cliff. Jazz knew it was there for he\u0027d seen it - had even felt it - but stone was stone and the uneven cliff face was a good disguise. And Jazz realized how glad he was to have come past that place unscathed. Maybe there was no one, or nothing, there after all. But still he was glad.\n He took a deep breath, issued it in a long drawn-out sigh - and gave a massive start!\n Something moved close by, in the shadow of fallen boulders where they humped darkly on his left, and a cold female voice, speaking Russian, said: \u0027Well, Karl Vyotsky, it\u0027s your choice. Talk or die. Right here and right now!\u0027\n Jazz\u0027s finger had been on the trigger of his SMG ever since the castle. Even before the woman\u0027s voice had started speaking, he\u0027d turned and sprayed the darkness where she was hiding. She was dead now - or would be if the weapon had been cocked! Jazz was glad it wasn\u0027t. Sometimes, with his speed and accuracy, it was as well to take precautions. On this occasion his precaution had been to leave the gun safe. It was good practice for his nerves, that\u0027s all. Shooting at shadows was a sure sign that a man was cracking up.\n \u0027Lady,\u0027 he said, his voice tense, \u0027 - Zek Foener? - I\u0027m not Karl Vyotsky. If I was you\u0027d probably be on your way to an alien heaven right now!\u0027\n Eyes peered at Jazz from the darkness, but not a woman\u0027s eyes. They were triangular - and yellow. And much too close to the ground. A wolf, grey, huge, hungry-looking, stepped cautiously into view. Its red tongue lolled between incisors nearly an inch and a half long. And now Jazz cocked his weapon. The action made a typical ch-ching sound.\n \u0027Hold it!\u0027 came the woman\u0027s voice again. \u0027He\u0027s my friend. And until now - maybe even now - the only friend I have.\u0027 There came a scuffing of stones and she stepped out of the shadows. The wolf went to heel on her right and a little to her rear. She had a gun like Jazz\u0027s, which shook in her hands where she pointed it at him.\n \u0027I\u0027ll say it again,\u0027 he said, \u0027just in case you weren\u0027t listening: I\u0027m not Karl Vyotsky.\u0027 Her gun was still shaking, violently now. Jazz looked at it, said: \u0027Hell, you\u0027d probably miss me anyway!\u0027\n \u0027The man on the radio?\u0027 she said. \u0027Before Vyotsky? I ... I recognize your voice.\u0027\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Then Jazz understood. \u0027Oh, yes, that was me. I was trying to give Khuv a hard time - but I doubt if he could hear me. It was Khuv sent me through the Gate, just like he did it to you. Only he didn\u0027t lie to me about it. I\u0027m Michael J. Simmons, a British agent. I don\u0027t know how you feel about that, but ... it looks like we\u0027re in the same boat. You can call me Jazz. All my friends do, and... would you mind not pointing that thing at me?\u0027\n She sobbed, a great racking gulp of a sob, and flew into his arms. He could feel her straining not to, but she had to. Her gun went clattering to the stony earth and her arms tightened round him. \u0027British?\u0027 she sobbed against his neck. \u0027I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re Japanese, African, or an Arab! As for my gun - it\u0027s jammed. It has been for days. And I\u0027m out of bullets anyway. If it was working and I had the ammunition - I\u0027d probably have shot myself long ago. I... I...\u0027\n \u0027Easy,\u0027 said Jazz. \u0027Easy!\u0027\n \u0027The Sunsiders are after me,\u0027 she continued to sob, \u0027to give me to the Wamphyri, and Vyotsky said there\u0027s a way back home, and -\u0027\n \u0027He what?\u0027 Jazz held her close. \u0027You\u0027ve spoken to Vyotsky? That\u0027s impos - \u0027 And he checked himself. The antenna of a radio was sticking out of her top pocket. \u0027Vyotsky\u0027s a liar,\u0027 he said. \u0027Forget it! There isn\u0027t a way back. He\u0027s just looking for a chum, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, God!\u0027 Her fingers were biting into his shoulders. \u0027Oh, God!\u0027\n Jazz tightened his grip on her, stroked her face, felt her tears hot in the crook of his neck. He smelled her, too, and it wasn\u0027t exactly flowers. It was sweat, and fear, and more than a little dirt, too. He pushed her away to arm\u0027s length and looked at her. Even in this deceptive light she looked good. A little haggard but good. And very human.\n She couldn\u0027t know it, but he was just as desperately pleased to see her.\n \u0027Zek,\u0027 he said, \u0027maybe we should find ourselves a nice safe place where we can talk and exchange notes, eh? I think you can probably save me a hell of a lot of time and effort.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s the cave where I rested,\u0027 she told him, a little breathlessly. \u0027It\u0027s about eight miles back. I was asleep when I heard your voice on my radio. I thought I was dreaming. By the time I realized I wasn\u0027t it was too late. You\u0027d gone. So I headed for the sphere, which was where I was going anyway. And I kept calling every ten minutes or so. Then I got Vyotsky...\u0027 She gave a small shudder.\n \u0027OK,\u0027 Jazz quickly told her. \u0027It\u0027s all right now - or about as right as it can be. Tell me all about it on our way to this cave of yours, right?\u0027 He stooped to pick up her gun, and the great wolf went into a crouch, screwed its face into a ferocious mask and snarled a warning.\n She patted the animal almost absently on its great head where its ears lay flat to the long skull, said: \u0027It\u0027s all right, Wolf - he\u0027s a friend.\u0027\n \u0027Wolf?\u0027 Jazz couldn\u0027t help smiling, however tightly. \u0027That\u0027s original!\u0027\n \u0027He was given to me by Lardis,\u0027 she said. \u0027Lardis is the leader of a Traveller pack. Sunsiders, of course. Wolf was to be my protection, and he has been. We got to be friends very quickly, but he\u0027s not much of a pet. There\u0027s too much of the wild in him. Think of him in a friendly way, like a big dog -1 mean really think of him that way, as your friend - and he won\u0027t be any trouble.\u0027 She turned and began to lead the way down from the crest toward the misty orb of the sun sitting apparently motionless over the southern mouth of the pass.\n \u0027Is that a theory or a fact?\u0027 Jazz asked her. \u0027About Wolf, I mean?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a fact,\u0027 she answered simply. Then, as quickly as she\u0027d started off, she paused and grabbed his arm. \u0027Are you sure we can\u0027t get back through the sphere?\u0027 Her voice had a pleading quality.\n \u0027I told you,\u0027 Jazz answered, trying not to sound too harsh, \u0027Vyotsky\u0027s a liar - amongst a lot of other things. Do you think he\u0027d still be here if he knew a way out? When they put me through the Gate I dragged Vyotsky with me. That\u0027s the only reason he\u0027s here. I figured if it was bad enough for me it was good enough for him! Khuv and Vyotsky, those people are ... it\u0027s hard to find a word for them without being offensive.\u0027\n \u0027Be offensive,\u0027 she said, bitterly. \u0027They\u0027re bastards!\u0027\n \u0027Tell me,\u0027 said Jazz, following her as she started off again, \u0027why were you heading for the sphere in the first place?\u0027\n She glanced at him briefly. \u0027When you\u0027ve been here as long as I have you won\u0027t need to ask. I came in that way, and it\u0027s the only Gate I know. I keep dreaming about being able to get out that way. I wake up thinking it\u0027s changed, that the poles have reversed and the flow lies in the other direction. So I was going there to try it. At sunup, of course, which is now. One chance and only one, and if I didn\u0027t make it through, then I wouldn\u0027t be making it back to Sunside, either.\u0027\n Jazz frowned. \u0027Reversed poles and all that - is that scientific stuff? Is it supposed to mean something?\u0027\n She shook her head. \u0027Just my fantasy,\u0027 she said, \u0027but it was worth one last shot...\u0027\n They walked in silence for a while, with the great wolf loping between them. There were a million questions Jazz wanted to ask, but he didn\u0027t want to exhaust her. Eventually he said: \u0027Where the hell is everybody? Where are the animals, birds? I mean, it\u0027s nature\u0027s way that where there are trees there are animals to chew on them. Also, I saw things at Perchorsk that made me think my coming here would be like rolling a snowball into hell! And yet I haven\u0027t seen -\u0027\n \u0027You wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 she cut him short. \u0027Not on Starside, not at sunup. Now we\u0027re down toward Sunside you\u0027ll start to see animals and birds; on the other side of the range you\u0027ll see plenty of them. But not on Starside. Believe me, Michael - er, Jazz? - you really wouldn\u0027t want to see anything of what lives on Starside.\u0027 She shivered, hugged her elbows.\n \u0027Starside and Sunside,\u0027 he mused. \u0027The pole is back there, the mountains run east to west, and the sun is south.\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she nodded her head, \u0027that\u0027s the way it is -always.\u0027 She stumbled, said: \u0027Oh.\u0027 and went to one knee; Jazz reached out and caught her elbow, stopped her from toppling over. This time Wolf made no protest. Jazz helped Zek to her feet, guided her to a flat rock. He shrugged a pack from his shoulder, took out a twenty-four-hour manpack: food for one man for one day. Then he dumped the pack onto the rock and made Zek sit on it.\n \u0027You\u0027re weak from hunger!\u0027 he said, pulling the ring on a tiny can of concentrated fruit juice. He took a sip at the juice to clean his mouth, handed her the can and said, \u0027Finish it.\u0027 She did, with relish. Wolf stood close by, wagging his tail for all the world like a low-slung Alsatian. His great tongue was beaded with saliva. Jazz broke a cube off a block of Russian chocolate concentrate and tossed it. Before it could hit the ground Wolf\u0027s jaws closed on it crunchingly.\n \u0027It\u0027s mainly my feet,\u0027 Zek said. Jazz looked at them. She wore rough leather sandals, but he could see caked blood between the toes where they projected. The mist had cleared from the sun a little, and now Jazz could take in the rest of her. True colours were still difficult, but outlines, shadows and silhouettes made readable contrasts. Her one-piece was ragged at the elbows and knees, patched at the backside. She carried only a slim roll, hooked to her harness. A sleeping-bag, Jazz correctly supposed.\n They\u0027re no kind of footgear for this terrain,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027I know it now,\u0027 Zek answered, \u0027but I\u0027d forgotten. Sunside is bad enough, but this pass is worse. And Starside is sheer hell. I had boots when I came here, like you. They don\u0027t last. Your feet harden quickly, you\u0027ll see, but some of these pebbles and rocks are sharp as knives.\u0027\n He gave her chocolate, which she almost snatched. \u0027Maybe we should rest right here,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Safe enough, with the sun on us,\u0027 she answered, \u0027but I\u0027d prefer to keep moving. Since we can\u0027t use the sphere, and we can\u0027t stay Starside, it\u0027s best we get back to Sunside as soon as we can.\u0027 Her tone was ominous.\n \u0027Any special reason?\u0027 Jazz was sure he wouldn\u0027t like the answer.\n \u0027Lots of them,\u0027 she told him, \u0027and they all live back there.\u0027 She nodded back the way they\u0027d come.\n \u0027Do you feel like telling me about - them?\u0027 Jazz unhooked one of his kidney-packs; he knew it contained, among other things, a very basic first-aid kit. He took out gauze bandages, a tube of ointment, plasters. And as Zek talked he kneeled and carefully slipped the sandals off her feet, began to work on her wounds.\n \u0027Them,\u0027 she echoed him, making the word sound sour; and again a shudder ran through her. \u0027The Wamphyri, do you mean? Oh, they\u0027re the main problem, it\u0027s true, but there are other things on Starside almost as bad. Did you see Agursky\u0027s \"pet\", the thing in the tank at Perchorsk?\u0027\n Jazz looked up, nodded. \u0027I saw it. Telling you exactly what I saw would be a different matter!\u0027 He tore off a strip of gauze, soaked it in water from his flask, gently wiped away the caked blood from her toes. She sighed her appreciation as he squeezed ointment from its tube and rubbed it into the splits under her toes and the pads of her feet.\n \u0027That thing you saw was what happens when a vampire egg gets into a species of local fauna,\u0027 she told him. She said it as simply as that, her voice quite neutral.\n Jazz stopped working on her feet, looked her straight in the eye, slowly nodded. \u0027A vampire egg, eh? That is what you said, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 She stared at him, obstinately, until he had to look away. \u0027OK, a vampire egg,\u0027 he shrugged, began wrapping her feet in gauze. \u0027So you\u0027re telling me that the Wamphyri are oviparous? They\u0027re egg-layers, right?\u0027\n She shook her head, changed her mind and nodded. \u0027Yes and no,\u0027 she said. The Wamphyri are what happens when a vampire egg gets into a man - or a woman.\u0027\n Jazz put her sandals on. They\u0027d been a little loose, tending to cause burns and blisters. Now they were tighter, stopping the feet from sliding about too much. \u0027Is that better?\u0027 he asked. He thought about what she\u0027d just told him, decided to let her tell it all in her own time, her own way.\n \u0027That feels good,\u0027 she said. Thanks.\u0027 She stood up, helped him get his packs hooked up, and they set off toward the sun again.\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 he said, when they were underway. \u0027Why don\u0027t I just listen and let you tell me everything that\u0027s happened to you while you\u0027ve been here? All you\u0027ve seen, learned, everything you know. So far as I can tell we\u0027ve got plenty of time on our hands. Vision\u0027s good, and we don\u0027t seem in any sort of immediate danger. The sun\u0027s up ahead, and we have some good moonlight...\u0027\n \u0027Have we?\u0027 Zek answered. Jazz craned his neck, looked at the moon. It had crossed the pass and already its rim touched the eastern peaks. A few more minutes and it would be gone. The planetary rotation period is incredibly slow,\u0027 she began to explain. \u0027But on the other hand the moon\u0027s orbit is closer and much faster. A \"day\" here is about a week on Earth. Oh, and incidentally, this place is \"Earth\". That\u0027s what they call it. It isn\u0027t our Earth, of course not, but it\u0027s theirs. I thought it was strange at first, but then I thought: what else would they call it?\n \u0027Anyway, this planet rotates westward very slowly, and its poles are not quite lined up on the sun. So it\u0027s like the planet has a wobble. The sun is seen to revolve west to east - anti-clockwise, if you like - in a slow, small circle. Now, I\u0027m not an astronomer or a space scientist of any sort so don\u0027t ask me the whys and wherefores, but how it works out is like this:\n \u0027On Sunside we get a \"morning\" of about twenty-five hours\u0027 duration, a \"day\" of maybe seventy-five hours\u0027 duration, an \"evening\" of twenty-five hours and a \"night\" of about forty. Midday or thereabouts is sunup, and all of the night is sundown.\u0027\n Jazz looked up again, saw the moon halved now by the sharp rim of the mountains. Even as he watched its glow lessened as it prepared to slip from sight. \u0027I\u0027m no astronomer either,\u0027 he said, \u0027but still it\u0027s very plain we have something of a fast-moving moon up there!\u0027\n \"That\u0027s right,\u0027 she answered. \u0027It has a rapid spin, too, and unlike the old moon shows both its face and its backside.\u0027\n Jazz nodded. \u0027Not shy, eh?\u0027\n She snorted. \u0027In some ways you remind me of another Englishman I once knew,\u0027 she said. \u0027He seemed sort of naive, too, and yet in reality he was anything but naive!\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 Jazz looked at her. \u0027Who was this lucky man?\u0027\n \u0027He wasn\u0027t that lucky,\u0027 she said, tilting her head a little.\n Jazz looked at her in profile in the last rays of moonlight, decided he liked her. A lot.\n \u0027So who was he?\u0027 he asked again.\n \u0027He was a member - maybe even the head - of your British E-Branch,\u0027 she answered. \u0027His name was Harry Keogh. And he had a special talent. I have a talent, too, but his was... different. I don\u0027t even know if you could call it ESP. That\u0027s how different it was.\u0027\n Jazz remembered what Khuv had told him about her. That sort of stuff was so much baloney as far as he was concerned, but best not to let her see his scepticism. \u0027Oh, yes, that\u0027s right,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027re a mentalist, right? You read minds. So what was this Keogh\u0027s talent, eh?\u0027\n \u0027He was a Necroscope,\u0027 she said, her voice suddenly cold.\n \u0027A what?\u0027\n \u0027He could talk to the dead!\u0027 she said; and coming to a sudden, angry halt, she drew apart from Jazz.\n He looked at her stubborn, bad-tempered stance, and at the great wolf standing between them, staring yellow-eyed from one to the other. \u0027Did I do something?\u0027\n \u0027You thought something!\u0027 she snapped. \u0027You thought, \"what a load of-\"\u0027\n \u0027Christ!\u0027 said Jazz. Because that was exactly what he\u0027d thought.\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 she said. \u0027Do you know how many years I\u0027ve been hiding the truth of my telepathy? Knowing I was better than anything else they had but not wanting to work for them? Not daring to work for them, because I knew if I did then sooner or later I\u0027d come up against Harry Keogh again? I\u0027ve suffered for my telepathy, Jazz, and yet now - here where it doesn\u0027t matter much any more - the moment I admit the truth of it...\u0027\n \u0027Show me!\u0027 he said, cutting her off. \u0027OK, I can see how we won\u0027t get anywhere if we\u0027ve no faith in each other.\n But we won\u0027t get far by lying or misleading each other either. If you say you can do it I have to accept it, right -certainly I know there are those who do believe you have this talent. But isn\u0027t there any way you can show me? You have to admit, Zek, it would have been easy just now to take a guess at what I was thinking. Not only about your telepathy but also about this Keogh bloke - about what you say he can do! Don\u0027t tell me you haven\u0027t met up with scepticism before, not with a gift most people would consider supernatural!\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re tempting me?\u0027 her eyes flashed fire. \u0027Humouring me? Taunting me? Get thee behind me, Satan!\u0027\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s godlike, this talent of yours, is it?\u0027 Jazz couldn\u0027t quite conceal his sneer. \u0027Well, if you\u0027re that good, how come you didn\u0027t know who it was coming up the pass? if telepathy and ESP in general are real, why didn\u0027t Khuv know I\u0027d hidden away a magazine for my SMG, which is how I came to get the chance to drag that goon Vyotsky in here with me?\u0027\n Wolf gave a low whine and his ears went flat.\n \u0027You\u0027re annoying him,\u0027 Zek said, \u0027and you\u0027re annoying me, too. Also, you\u0027ve missed my point. Big macho man! I say: \"I\u0027m a telepath\", and you say: \"Prove it\". The next thing, you\u0027re asking me to prove I\u0027m a woman!\u0027\n Jazz nodded, pulled a sour face. \u0027You rate yourself pretty damned high, don\u0027t you? God knows what sort of men you\u0027re used to, but I -\u0027\n \u0027All right!\u0027 she snapped. \u0027Watch...\u0027\n She looked at Wolf, the merest glance, then turned and tossed her head, walked on toward the sun. She went maybe a hundred yards, and Jazz and the wolf stood still watching her. Then she stopped and looked back. \u0027Now I\u0027m not going to say anything,\u0027 she called out. \u0027So see what you think of what happens next.\u0027\n Jazz frowned, thought: What the - ? But in the next moment Wolf showed him what the. The huge creature loped closer, took the sleeve of Jazz\u0027s one-piece in his great jaws - but gently - began to tug Jazz in Zek\u0027s direction. Jazz stumbled to keep up, and the faster he went the faster Wolf ran, until both of them were flying full tilt toward the girl where she waited. Only then did the wolf let go, when both of them drew level with her.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 she said, as Jazz came to a panting, stumbling halt.\n He sucked the hole in his jaw where two teeth had once been, put up a hand and scratched his nose. \u0027Well,\u0027 he started, \u0027I -\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re thinking I\u0027m an animal trainer,\u0027 she cut in. \u0027But if you say it out loud, that\u0027s it. We go our separate ways. I\u0027ve survived so far without you and I can keep right on doing it.\u0027 Wolf went and stood beside her.\n \u0027Two to one,\u0027 Jazz grinned, however ruefully. \u0027And since I\u0027ve always believed in the democratic process... OK, there\u0027s no option but to believe you. You\u0027re a telepath.\u0027 They carried on walking, but slightly more apart now. \u0027So why didn\u0027t you know it was me coming up the pass? How come you challenged me as Vyotsky?\u0027\n \u0027You saw the castle back there, the keep?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s why.\u0027\n Jazz glanced back. The cliff-hugging castle must be miles back by now. \u0027But it was empty, deserted.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe, and maybe not. The Wamphyri want me -badly. They\u0027re not stupid, anything but. They know I came in through the sphere, the Gate, and they\u0027ve surely guessed that sooner or later I\u0027d try to get out again that way. At least, I credit them with that much intelligence. It would have been easy for them during the last sundown - during any one of many sundowns - to put a creature in there. There\u0027ll be plenty of rooms and corners in there that the sun never touches.\u0027\n Jazz shook his head, held up a restraining hand. \u0027Even if I understood all you just said, which I don\u0027t, still I wouldn\u0027t know what it has to do with me,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027In this world,\u0027 she answered, \u0027you\u0027re careful how you use ESP. The Wamphyri have it - in many diverse forms - and so to a lesser degree do most of the animals. Only the true men are without it.\u0027\n \u0027You mean, if the Wamphyri left something in that castle back there - a creature? - it would have heard your thoughts?\u0027 Again Jazz was close to incredulous.\n \u0027It might have heard my directed thoughts, yes,\u0027 she nodded.\n \u0027But that\u0027s -\u0027 he stilled his tongue before it could offend her.\n \u0027Wolf can hear them,\u0027 she said, simply.\n \u0027And me?\u0027 Jazz gave a snort. \u0027Does that make me an idiot or something, because I can\u0027t hear them?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 she shook her head. \u0027Not an idiot, just a true man. You\u0027re not an esper. Listen, when I came up this way I heard your thoughts, distant and strange and a little confused. But I didn\u0027t dare concentrate on you and check out your identity in case that allowed something else to pick out and identify me! Now that we\u0027re in the light of the sun, the pressure\u0027s off; but the closer I got to Starside the more careful I had to be. And because I couldn\u0027t be sure you weren\u0027t Vyotsky, so I challenged you. You said he\u0027d probably have killed me. Maybe he would and maybe not. But then he\u0027d have had to kill Wolf, too, which wouldn\u0027t be so easy. And if he had killed me, then he really would be on his own. It was a chance I had to take...\u0027\n This time Jazz accepted all she told him; he had to start somewhere, and it seemed the best way to go. \u0027Listen,\u0027 he said. \u0027Even though I like to think I\u0027m fairly quick on the uptake, still there\u0027s a lot you\u0027ll need to explain about what you\u0027ve already told me. But before that there\u0027s one thing I\u0027d better know right now: do I need to guard my thoughts?\u0027\n \u0027Here in the sunlight? No. On Starside, yes - all the time - but with a bit of luck we\u0027ll never see Starside again.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 Jazz nodded. \u0027Now let\u0027s get to more immediate things. Where\u0027s this cave you told me about? I really think we should rest-up. And at the same time I can do a better job on your feet. Also, you look like you could use a more substantial meal.\u0027\n She smiled at him, the first time she\u0027d done it. Jazz wished he could see her in good old down-to-earth daylight. \u0027I\u0027ll tell you something,\u0027 she said. \u0027I long ago learned not to listen in on people\u0027s thoughts - they can be nice, I\u0027ll grant you, but when they\u0027re not nice they can be very unpleasant indeed. We sometimes think things we could never express in words. Me, too. Among espers it was a general rule that we observe each other\u0027s privacy. But I\u0027ve been lonely a long time - for a mind I could relate to, I mean. A mind from my own world. So while I\u0027ve been hearing you talking, well, I\u0027ve been hearing other things, too. When I\u0027ve grown used to you, then I\u0027ll make an effort not to intrude. I\u0027m trying even now, but ... I can\u0027t help scanning you.\u0027\n Jazz frowned. \u0027So what was I thinking?\u0027 he said. \u0027I mean, I only said we should rest-up.\u0027\n \u0027But you meant I should rest-up. Me, Zek Foener. That\u0027s nice of you, and if I really needed it I\u0027d accept. But you\u0027ve come quite a long way yourself. And anyway, I\u0027d prefer to keep moving until we\u0027re right out of the pass. Another four miles or so and we\u0027re out of it. But as you can see, the sun is just about to touch the eastern wall.\n It\u0027s a slow process, but in something less than an hour and a half the pass will be in darkness again. On Sunside it\u0027s still sunup for, oh, twenty-five hours yet, and the evening is just as long. After that... then we\u0027ll be holed up somewhere.\u0027 She shivered.\n Jazz knew nothing about ESP, but he did read people very well. \u0027You\u0027re a hell of a brave woman,\u0027 he said; and then he wondered why, for passing compliments was something he wasn\u0027t good at and didn\u0027t usually do. But he knew he\u0027d meant it. So did she, but she didn\u0027t agree with him.\n \u0027No, I\u0027m not,\u0027 she said seriously. \u0027I think I maybe used to be, but now I\u0027m a dreadful coward. You\u0027ll find out why soon enough.\u0027\n \u0027Before then,\u0027 Jazz said, \u0027you\u0027d better fill me in on more immediate hazards - assuming they are immediate. You said something about the Sunsiders - Travellers? - being after you? And something about the Wamphyri being desperate to get hold of you? Now what\u0027s all that about?\u0027\n \u0027Sunsiders.\u0027\u0027 she gasped, but not in answer. She stiffened to a halt, glanced wildly all about, especially in the shadows cast by the eastern cliffs. Her hand went to her brow, stroked it with trembling fingers. Wolf\u0027s hackles rose; he laid back his ears and offered a low, throaty growl.\n Jazz took his SMG off safe. It was already cocked. He checked that the magazine was firmly seated in its housing. \u0027Zek?\u0027 he husked.\n \u0027Arlek.\u0027 she whispered. And: \u0027That\u0027s what comes of holding back on my telepathy, for your sake! Jazz, I -\u0027\n But she had no time for anything else, for by then they were in the thick of it!\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-10.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
