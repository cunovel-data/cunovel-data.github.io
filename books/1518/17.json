{"id":62507,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Intruder Khuv, Agursky and the others reeled as they entered the room of the thing. In the swirl and reek of the dead, frying creature in the tank, they failed to see that man-shaped space where the smoke rushed in to fill a sudden gap. Harry had made his exit just in time. Agursky recovered first, leaped across the room and switched off the power. \u0027Who has done this?\u0027 he demanded of no one in particular. \u0027Who is responsible?\u0027 He clapped a hand to his brow, staggered toward the sputtering, smoking tank, where even now shards of glass were beginning to melt in the intense heat. Then, as the smoke began to clear, he saw the creature\u0027s blackened remains hanging out through the shattered glass wall; saw, too, something else - something which he didn\u0027t want anyone else to see. He ripped off his smock, quickly threw it over the monstrous remains. Khuv had meanwhile turned to Leo Grenzel, the locator. \u0027You said he was here, an intruder. Well, someone has certainly been here - though I\u0027m damned if I can see how! The door was locked, and there\u0027s a guard outside. Oh, a half-asleep, stupid guard, that\u0027s true, but he\u0027s not a complete idiot! So...just getting in here would be hard enough if not impossible - but as for getting out...?\u0027 Then Khuv grasped Grenzel by the shoulders, stared hard at him. \u0027Leo? Is there something else?\u0027 Grenzel\u0027s face was pale again; his grey eyes were deep as deep space; he swayed where Khuv held him upright. \u0027Still here,\u0027 he finally said. \u0027He\u0027s still here!\u0027 Khuv stared all about the room, as did the others. Black smoke boiling from the mess under Agursky\u0027s smock, and the crackle of cooked, alien flesh starting to cool; but no sign of any intruder. \u0027Here? Where, here?\u0027 The girl,\u0027 Grenzel swayed. The prisoner...\u0027 Taschenka Kirescu?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Grenzel\u0027s nod. Khuv whirled on Savinkov and Slepak. \u0027How can this be?\u0027 he asked. But already his mind was working; memories of reports he\u0027d read flashed before his mind\u0027s eye; it was something from before his time, but weren\u0027t the British supposed to have a man who could do this sort of thing? Harry Keogh was said to have been one such, and after him Alec Kyle. Keogh was dead but... but they never had found Kyle\u0027s body after the mess at the Chateau Bronnitsy. \u0027How can it be?\u0027 Savinkov repeated his KGB master. \u0027It can\u0027t be!\u0027 He was definite. But: \u0027Oh, it can,\u0027 Grenzel\u0027s far-away voice contradicted him. \u0027It is!\u0027 \u0027Quickly!\u0027 Khuv rasped. The cells. I want to know what the hell is happening here!\u0027 They ran out of the room, left Grenzel swaying there, his face slack and vacant, but his eyes seeing, seeing. And Agursky, bundling up the dead creature and its dead parasite in his smock, trembling in his eagerness to get it back to his private quarters and away from any threat of inspection by others. For he now knew what had controlled this nameless thing, and he wanted to examine that controller most minutely. Indeed, to Vasily Agursky there was nothing more important in the entire world but that he examine the thing\u0027s parasite - whose egg had been deposited and was even now maturing inside Agursky himself! Tassi\u0027s nightmare - of the key grating in the lock on her cell door, and of Khuv entering, dark-eyed and evil - had kept her awake. It was that sort of nightmare, the sort you suffer when you\u0027re awake. It was doubtful if she would have slept anyway; she hadn\u0027t since... since the horror Khuv had shown her in the room of the thing. She couldn\u0027t sleep, for the face of her father kept smiling at her from the darkness behind her eyelids whenever she closed her eyes; her father\u0027s face - on the body of a beast. She kept her cell light on, and lay warm on her cot but shivering, drained of energy, waiting for Khuv. For her time was up, and she knew he would soon be coming for her. That had been his threat, and Major Chingiz Khuv didn\u0027t make idle threats. If only there was something she could tell him, but she didn\u0027t know anything. Only that she was the most wretched, unhappiest girl in the world. When Harry stepped out of the Mobius Continuum, Tassi had just turned on her side, turned her face away from his re-entry point into this universe. A quick glance about the cell told Harry they were alone; he took a single pace to the metal bed, put a hand round Tassi\u0027s face and over her mouth, cautioned her in Russian: \u0027Shhh! Be quiet. Don\u0027t shout or do anything stupid. I\u0027m going to get you out of here.\u0027 He kept his hand clamped to her face but let her turn her head to look at him. And with his hand still in place, he helped her to sit up. Then: \u0027OK?\u0027 he asked. Tassi nodded, but she was trembling in every limb. Her eyes looked like saucers above her nose and the bands of Harry\u0027s fingers. He slowly took his hand away, gently urged her to her feet. She looked at the door, then at Harry, said: \u0027Who? - How? - I don\u0027t...\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 Harry put a finger to his lips. \u0027But how did you get in here? I didn\u0027t hear you come. Was I asleep?\u0027 Then her hand flew to her mouth. \u0027Did the Major send you? But I\u0027ve told him: I don\u0027t know anything! Oh, please don\u0027t hurt me!\u0027 \u0027No one\u0027s going to hurt you, Tassi,\u0027 Harry told her. And then he made his mistake: \u0027Your father sent me.\u0027 Seeing her expression, he could have bitten his tongue through. She shook her head and backed away from him. There were tears in her eyes now. \u0027My father\u0027s dead,\u0027 she wept. \u0027He\u0027s dead! He couldn\u0027t have sent you...\u0027 And accusingly: \u0027What are you going to do to me?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve told you,\u0027 Harry answered, an edge of desperation in his tone, \u0027I\u0027m going to take you out of this place. Do you hear those alarms?\u0027 She listened, and indeed she could hear the klaxons, sounding from deep down in the heart of the place. \u0027Well,\u0027 Harry continued, \u0027I\u0027m what those alarms are all about. They\u0027re looking for me, and pretty soon they\u0027ll be looking in here. So now I\u0027m asking you to trust me.\u0027 What he was saying was impossible. It was either a trick of Khuv\u0027s or else this man was insane. No one could get out of this place, Tassi was sure. But on the other hand, how had he got in? \u0027Do you have keys?\u0027 she asked. Harry could see he was making an impression. \u0027Keys?\u0027 he grinned, however tightly. \u0027I have an entire door! Lots of doors!\u0027 He was mad, surely. But he was different from the others here, totally different. \u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 she said, still backing away. Her legs struck the edge of her bed and she flopped down on it again. Running footsteps sounded, and the tight grin slipped from Harry\u0027s face. \u0027They\u0027re coming,\u0027 he said. \u0027Get up.\u0027 The sudden authority in his voice had her on her feet again in a moment. There was shouting outside, the jangle of keys, Khuv\u0027s voice hoarsely commanding: \u0027Open it! Open it!\u0027 Harry grabbed Tassi by the waist. \u0027Put your arms round my neck,\u0027 he said. \u0027Quickly, girl. No arguments, now!\u0027 She did it. She had no reason to trust him, but she had no reason not to. \u0027Close your eyes,\u0027 he said. \u0027And keep them closed.\u0027 Tightening one arm around her narrow waist, he grunted as he lifted her feet from the floor. She heard the cell door grating open, then silence - but such absolute silence. \u0027Wha - ?\u0027 she commenced a question she couldn\u0027t finish, and shrank from the booming of her own voice. Startled, she opened her eyes for a moment - but only for a moment. Then she snapped them tightly shut again. \u0027There,\u0027 said Harry, and he lowered her feet to a solid floor. \u0027You can open your eyes now.\u0027 She did, the merest slit... then opened them wide, wider - and sagged against him. Her eyes rolled up and she began to slide down his body. Harry caught her up, lifted her, laid her on the Duty Officer\u0027s desk. Behind his newspaper, the DO had just this moment realized that he had visitors. Then the girl\u0027s arm and hand flopped into view under his open newspaper and he reared up and back with an inarticulate cry: \u0027G-yahhh!\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 said Harry, who was growing accustomed to excusing himself. \u0027It\u0027s only me, and the friend of a friend of mine.\u0027 \u0027Jesus! Jesus! - oh, sweet Jesus!\u0027 the DO clutched at his desk for support. Of all people, it was Darcy Clarke. Harry nodded the very briefest of greetings, began to massage the unconscious girl\u0027s hands... It had been 1:15 a.m. when Harry arrived at E-Branch HQ, and it was almost an hour later when he left. In between times he passed on some information, told Clarke all he had learned, and in return received a little information from the other. His instructions for the welfare of Tassi Kirescu were these: She was to be given refuge, comforted as best the staff of E-Branch knew how, offered permanent political asylum. A Russian interpreter was to be provided for her, and she should be debriefed (but with a great deal of care and sensitivity) with regard to the Perchorsk Projekt. For the present she was to keep a low profile: her presence here in the West should be kept secret, and when she was released it must be with a new identity. Lastly, E-Branch was to use such usual and paranormal means as were required to discover the whereabouts in the USSR of her mother. Harry had made Kazimir Kirescu a promise and it was one he intended to keep - eventually. As for the information Darcy Clarke had for Harry: \u0027It\u0027s Zek Foener,\u0027 he had told the Necroscope. \u0027Zek? What about her?\u0027 The last time Harry had seen Zek was eight years ago. She had been a telepath at the Chateau Bronnitsy, the USSR\u0027s equivalent of E-Branch HQ, which had made her an enemy, but a reluctant one. Harry could have destroyed her, but he\u0027d sensed a deep-rooted decency in her, a desire to be free of her KGB masters. All she had wanted was to return to Greece. He had suspected she would. But ... he had warned her not to come up against him again. \u0027She may be part of this,\u0027 Clarke had told him. \u0027How do you mean? Part of Perchorsk?\u0027 Was Zek the one who\u0027d betrayed his presence there? She would have known his mind at once, as soon as he materialized in the place. Of course, there was also Khuv\u0027s detachment of espers; they could have picked him up just as easily. For the moment Harry preferred to believe the latter. At least he hoped so. \u0027Part of Perchorsk, yes. A cog in the wheel of the place. We\u0027ve kept an eye on her ever since the Bodescu affair. She was doing time at a forced labour camp; not especially hard stuff, but not pleasant either. Then they sent her to Perchorsk. This was some months ago and we\u0027ve just had news of it. We can only assume she\u0027s working for Soviet E-Branch again. And for the KGB...\u0027 Harry\u0027s face soured. \u0027Again,\u0027 he said. \u0027I warned her not to. Well, if I have to mix it with them again...\u0027 He let the threat hang there. Clarke stared hard at him. \u0027But isn\u0027t it more serious than that, Harry? At the end of the Bodescu affair, Zek Foener was working with Ivan Gerenko - \u0027 \u0027Had been working with him,\u0027 Harry cut in, correcting him. \u0027But she\u0027d quit. I thought so, anyway.\u0027 \u0027But you know what I mean,\u0027 Clarke insisted. \u0027Gerenko had some crazy idea about using vampires. That\u0027s why he and Theo Dolgikh - and Zek - went back to that mountain pass east of the Carpathians: to see if, after all those centuries, anything remained of Faethor Ferenczy\u0027s buried creatures. Zek knows about vampires! It makes it that much more definite that the Russians have discovered a way to make the damned things, and that they\u0027re doing it there at Perchorsk!\u0027 \u0027So you\u0027re saying...?\u0027 \u0027Harry, you remember how you dealt with the Chateau Bronnitsy?\u0027 After a moment, Harry had nodded. Oh yes, he remembered it well enough. Using the Mobius Continuum, he\u0027d laid plastic explosive charges there. Gouting, shattering fire and lashing heat, and the Chateau reduced to smouldering rubble. And the Soviet E-Branch reduced along with it, for their sins. In the space of less than a minute, enough sheer destructive savagery to last any man a lifetime. \u0027I remember,\u0027 he had finally answered. \u0027Except -\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027Darcy, if you\u0027re right, well, obviously the place has to go. But not until we\u0027re sure one way or the other, and not yet. I have this feeling that the answer to my one big problem is right there. It may be risky - I mean, I know what has escaped from that place, and what could presumably escape from it in future; indeed, I\u0027ve seen and dealt with an example - but for the moment I can\u0027t, daren\u0027t, try to close it down. Not if I want to see Brenda and Harry Jnr again.\u0027 For a moment it had seemed that Clarke understood, but then he\u0027d said, \u0027Harry, it\u0027s not just a case of \"risky\" -it\u0027s deadly! Unthinkable! You must see that?\u0027 And then it had been Harry\u0027s turn. Coldly he had answered: \u0027There are a couple of things you have to see, too, Darcy. Like old man Kirescu being dead - his death probably precipitated by your sending Jazz Simmons in there. And that poor girl having lost both her father and her brother. And her mother, probably in a forced labour camp by now, half out of her mind with grief and worry, no doubt. These are things you can\u0027t write off, Darcy, and you\u0027re certainly not going to write off Brenda and Harry Jnr. So for now we\u0027ll continue to play this my way.\u0027 White-faced, Clarke could only agree. \u0027So ... what\u0027s your way going to be? What\u0027s your next step, Harry?\u0027 \u0027Well, there are questions I need answered. It looks like I\u0027ll have to go right to the top to get them answered.\u0027 The top?\u0027 Harry had nodded. \u0027The Perchorsk Projekt. If I\u0027m right and it\u0027s not about breeding vampires, then what is it about? Someone in that place knows and is going to tell me. There has to be a boss, a controller. Not Khuv but someone above him.\u0027 \u0027Of course there is,\u0027 Clarke had answered at once. \u0027Khuv\u0027s in charge of security, that\u0027s all. The man you want is Viktor Luchov.\u0027 And he\u0027d gone on to fill Harry in on Luchov\u0027s background. When he was done Harry had nodded grimly. Then he\u0027s the man I need to talk to. If anyone has the answers, Viktor Luchov has to be the one.\u0027 \u0027When will you try to see him?\u0027 \u0027Now.\u0027 \u0027Now?\u0027 Clarke had been taken aback. \u0027But the place will still be on top alert!\u0027 \u0027I know. I\u0027ll create a smoke screen.\u0027 \u0027A what?\u0027 \u0027A diversion. Let me worry about it. You just look after that girl.\u0027 Clarke had nodded, stuck out his hand. \u0027Best of luck, Harry.\u0027 The Necroscope wasn\u0027t one for holding grudges. He shook hands, conjured a Mobius door. Clarke watched him take his departure, thought: I was there once! Pray God he\u0027d never be there again... Viktor Luchov was back in his own executive quarters (which meant that they were slightly less austere than anyone else\u0027s at Perchorsk) and he was furious. Quite apart from this latest incident - this \u0027intrusion\u0027, if such it had been - the Projekt Direktor had chosen the period of the alert to approach and challenge Khuv in respect of certain rumours which were beginning to circulate through the Projekt, rumours alleging brutality and murder. They concerned the KGB officer\u0027s prisoners, Kazimir and Taschenka Kirescu. Perhaps Luchov\u0027s approach had been a little too liverish (he had after all been shocked awake in the middle of the night, with klaxons sounding all around like wailing demons out of hell) but that could not excuse Khuv\u0027s response, which had been brusque to put it mildly. Namely, he had told Luchov that he should get off his back and let him attend to the Projekt\u0027s security with a minimum of interference. Or better still, with no interference at all. This confrontation had taken place not in private but in the detention area, where Khuv\u0027s espers had been crowding one of the cells in their search for something or other. \u0027Sniffing the ether!\u0027 as one of them had put it. Appalled at the apparent chaos and confusion, Luchov had demanded to see the prisoners, which was when Khuv had rounded on him. \u0027Listen, Comrade Direktor,\u0027 the KGB Major had hissed. \u0027I would be delighted if I could show you the girl Tassi Kirescu. This was her cell. A little over one hour ago she was here, and a guard on duty in the corridor outside. Then - \u0027 he had thrown up his hands, \u0027 - she was no longer here, and the door still locked! Now, I know you hold E-Branch in small regard, and the KGB in no regard at all, but surely it must be amply apparent even to your oh-so-scientific mind that something quite exceptional - something, indeed, entirely metaphysical - has occurred here? My espers are attempting to discover what that something was. And I, who have no ESP talent of my own, am trying to make sense of what they\u0027re telling me. So ... now is not the ideal moment for you to come interfering!\u0027 \u0027You go too far, Major!\u0027 Luchov had shouted. \u0027And I shall go further,\u0027 Khuv had shouted back. \u0027If you do not get out of my way I shall have you escorted back to your quarters and locked in!\u0027 \u0027What? You dare -!!\u0027 \u0027Listen, you damned scientist!\u0027 Khuv had then snarled at him. \u0027In my capacity as the Projekt\u0027s security supervisor I dare almost anything! Now I\u0027ll tell you one more time: the creature from the Gate is dead, destroyed by some unknown person or thing; the Kirescu girl, formerly my prisoner, is missing; her father is ... dead: an unfortunate accident. I shall ensure that you get a copy of the report. And finally, the Projekt has had an intruder. Our security has been breached in the worst possible way. I repeat: our security. My sphere of work, Direktor, not yours. So go back to bed. Go back to your mathematics and your physics and what all. Go study your magmass and your grey holes and your particle beam acceleration - only leave me alonef And Luchov, shouted down, had returned to his rooms and commenced to write a furious, comprehensive report on Khuv\u0027s suspected activities and his rank insubordination. Meanwhile: For the last five minutes Harry Keogh had been making a nuisance of himself. First he\u0027d appeared outside the Projekt, on the patrolled ramp cut into the Perchorsk ravine\u0027s wall, where he\u0027d taken a half-hearted pot shot at a guard. He hadn\u0027t attempted to hit the man, for he\u0027d need serious reasons before sending yet another human being to join the Great Majority. Before the soldier could fire back at him, Harry had ducked into the cover of darkly swirling snow - and through a Mobius door. From there he\u0027d returned to the room of the thing. Emerging there, he\u0027d been ready on the instant to return into the Mobius Continuum. But the room was empty and so he\u0027d simply gone to the locked door and banged on it, shouting to be let out. The guard outside the room had responded to this, of course, and moments later so had the alarm system. Tassi Kirescu\u0027s cell had been next; Harry emerged amidst a handful of baffled espers, struck two of them rapid, stunning blows, retreated to the Mobius Continuum. Behind him he left Leo Grenzel and Nik Slepak groaning on the floor, and others white-faced and wide-eyed, astonished by what they\u0027d seen and felt. Grenzel was still feeling it, and not just the two front teeth Harry had loosened. That\u0027s him!\u0027 he gurgled, sitting up and spitting blood. That\u0027s him!\u0027 Khuv was heading for KGB accommodation when the klaxons began to sound again. He cursed, put on speed. Coming through a door between sections of the corridor, he ran into Harry Keogh. He knew him at once - or thought he did. Khuv had a good memory; he\u0027d seen photographs of this man: a one-time head of British E-Branch - Alec Kyle! Harry pressed his Browning up under Khuv\u0027s chin, said: \u0027I can see by the look on your face that you know me. Which puts me at a disadvantage - but let me guess anyway. Major Chingiz Khuv?\u0027 Khuv gulped, nodded, shoved his hands high in the air. \u0027Major, you\u0027re in the wrong business,\u0027 Harry pressed harder with his gun. Take some good advice and get out while the going\u0027s good. And pray you never see me again.\u0027 He stepped back away from Khuv, looked for a door. In the moment of Harry\u0027s distraction, Khuv snatched his own gun from its holster, triggered off a shot. Harry felt the bullet buzz past his face like an angry wasp to speed forever through the Mobius Continuum. Then Khuv and the corridor blinked out of existence and he headed for somewhere else. He emerged in a military Duty Room situated just inside the Projekt\u0027s service bays, put the muzzle of his pistol in the Orderly Sergeant\u0027s ear where he sat at his desk and ordered him to tell him the way to Direktor Luchov\u0027s quarters. The terrified Sergeant showed him what he wanted to know on a wall chart, a diagram of the Perchorsk complex, and Harry rewarded him with a chop to the neck that would keep him out of things for at least half an hour. Then he was on the move again. Harry\u0027s \u0027smoke screen\u0027 was now established. It was 5:22 a.m. precisely, local time, when he materialized in Viktor Luchov\u0027s claustrophobic suite of rooms. Luchov was on the phone, demanding to know what this fresh spate of clamouring alarms was all about, when Harry arrived. His back was to Harry, who let him finish his conversation and slam the telephone down before he spoke: \u0027Direktor Luchov? I\u0027m what those alarms are all about.\u0027 He pointed his automatic at Luchov\u0027s heart, said: \u0027Better sit down.\u0027 Luchov, whirling from the telephone, saw Harry, his gun and where it was pointed, in that order. He staggered as if he\u0027d been struck in the temple. \u0027What - ? Who - ?\u0027 \u0027Who doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027And what is what I\u0027m here to find out.\u0027 \u0027Khuv\u0027s intruder!\u0027 Luchov finally gasped. \u0027I thought it was all part of some elaborate scheme of his.\u0027 \u0027Sit,\u0027 Harry said again, waving his gun toward a chair. Luchov did as Harry ordered, the yellow veins pulsing rapidly under the scar-tissue skin of his seared skull. Harry looked at Luchov\u0027s disfigurement, saw that the damage was fairly recent. \u0027An accident?\u0027 Tight-lipped, breathing just a fraction too quickly, Luchov said nothing. Both he and Harry jumped as the telephone came janglingly alive, ringing repeatedly. Then Harry scowled. They must have some clever people working here; it seemed they\u0027d already located him; he wouldn\u0027t have time to interrogate Luchov - not here, anyway. \u0027Get up,\u0027 he said, reaching out and jerking Luchov to his feet. And still holding him, he conjured a door and dragged the other through it. In a moment, for the moment, they were out on the ramp in the ravine, snow stinging their eyes and a cold wind rushing down the length of the canyon. Harry looked up at the bleak mountains showing their fangs through the snow. Luchov, seeing where he was - where according to all the laws of science he had no right to be - had barely sufficient time to voice some inarticulate query before - - Harry dragged him squalling through another door, passed through the Mobius Continuum and exited-on a ledge high over the Perchorsk ravine. Luchov saw the sheer drop under his feet and almost fainted. He let out a wild shriek and pressed himself back into the face of the cliff behind him. And again Harry commanded: \u0027Sit -before you fall.\u0027 Luchov carefully sat down, hugged his dressing-gown to him, shivered partly from the cold and partly from the terror of this totally unbelievable and yet entirely inescapable experience. Harry went down on one knee before him and put his gun away. \u0027Now,\u0027 he said. \u0027I should think that dressed as we are, we\u0027ve about ten to fifteen minutes before we freeze to death. So you\u0027d better talk fast. There are things I want to know - about the Perchorsk Projekt. And I have it on good authority that you\u0027d be the one to tell me. So I\u0027ll ask the questions and you\u0027ll answer them.\u0027 Luchov collected his whirling senses as best he could, recovered something of his dignity. \u0027If ... if I have only fifteen minutes left, then so do you. We both freeze.\u0027 Harry grinned wolfishly. \u0027You don\u0027t catch on too quickly, do you? I don\u0027t have to stay here. I can leave you right now. Like this -\u0027 And he was no longer there. Snow swirled in the space where he had kneeled. He returned, said: \u0027So what\u0027s it going to be? Do you talk to me or do I simply leave you here?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re an enemy of my country!\u0027 Luchov blurted, feeling the cold start to bite. \u0027That place of yours,\u0027 Harry nodded toward the grey sheen of lead far below, \u0027appears to be an enemy of the world - potentially, anyway.\u0027 \u0027If I tell you anything - anything - about the Projekt, then I\u0027m a traitor!\u0027 Luchov protested. This wasn\u0027t getting Harry anywhere, and now he was cold, too. \u0027Listen,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ve seen what I can do -but you haven\u0027t seen everything. I\u0027m also a Necroscope: I can talk to the dead. So I can talk to you alive, or I can talk to you dead. If you were dead you\u0027d be only too glad to talk to me, Viktor, for then I\u0027d be your only real contact with the world.\u0027 \u0027Talk to the dead?\u0027 Luchov shrank even further down into himself. \u0027You\u0027re a madman!\u0027 Harry shrugged. \u0027Obviously you don\u0027t know much about espers. I take it you and Khuv don\u0027t get on too well?\u0027 Luchov\u0027s teeth had started to chatter. \u0027ESP? Is this something to do with ESP?\u0027 Harry had run out of time and patience. \u0027OK,\u0027 he said, straightening up, \u0027I can see you need convincing. So I\u0027m going to leave you now. I\u0027m going somewhere else, somewhere warm. I\u0027ll come back in about five minutes, or maybe ten. Meanwhile you can make up your mind: to talk to me or to attempt to climb down from here. Personally I don\u0027t think you\u0027d make it. I think you\u0027d fall, and then that we would talk again when I found your body at the bottom of the ravine.\u0027 Luchov grasped his ankle. It was all a nightmare - had to be a nightmare, surely - but it felt horribly real, as real as the flesh-and-blood ankle he was grasping. \u0027Wait! Wait! What... what is it you want to know?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s better,\u0027 said Harry. He drew Luchov to his feet, took him somewhere more comfortable: an evening beach in Australia. Luchov felt the hot sand under his feet, saw a shimmering ocean with its endless lines of whitecaps, sat down abruptly as his legs gave way. He sat there in the sand, wide-eyed, shivering and very nearly exhausted. The beach was deserted. Harry looked down at Luchov and nodded. Then he stripped down to his underpants, went for a swim. When he came out of the sea, Luchov was ready to talk ... When Luchov was finished (which is to say when Harry had run out of questions) it was getting dark. A handful of cars had come roaring down to the beach a quarter of a mile away, spilled young people with blankets and barbecue gear. Laughter and rock music came wafting on a crosswind. \u0027Back at Perchorsk it\u0027ll be morning, daylight,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027But they\u0027ll still be running around in circles looking for you. If Khuv has a locator, they\u0027ll know approximately where you are. To be absolutely sure, though, they\u0027ll go over the Projekt with a fine-toothed comb. And by now everyone involved will be very tired. One thing is certain: Khuv now knows something of what he\u0027s up against. \u0027Now listen: you\u0027ve co-operated with me and so I\u0027ll give you fair warning. It may be that I have to destroy Perchorsk. Not for my sake or in the interest of any nation or specific group of people, but for the sake of the world. But in any case, even if anything should happen to me, eventually Perchorsk will be destroyed. The USA won\u0027t sit still for any more monsters coming out of that place.\u0027 \u0027Of course,\u0027 Luchov answered. \u0027I had foreseen that eventuality. Some months ago I passed on my warning to people in authority, made my recommendations. The warning was heeded and the recommendations accepted. Within the week, possibly as soon as tomorrow - today - trucks will start to arrive at Perchorsk from Sverdlovsk. They will deliver a new failsafe. So you see, on this one point if on no other, we are in agreement. Nothing - alien - must ever again get out of Perchorsk...\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027Before I take you back there,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027d like to ask you one more thing. With that space-time Gate down there in Perchorsk\u0027s guts, how come you found me so incredible? I mean, surely the two principles come pretty close? In Perchorsk you have ... a grey hole? And I make use of a dimension or space-time plane other than my own.\u0027 Luchov stood up, stiffly brushed sand from his clothes. \u0027The difference is this,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know how the Perchorsk Gate came into being. I\u0027ve worked out most of the mathematics. The Gate is a physical reality, with nothing transient or insubstantial about it. It is physical, not metaphysical. The result of an accident, yes, but at least I know how that accident happened. You, on the other hand - you\u0027re just a man! I can\u0027t understand how you could ever possibly have happened.\u0027 Harry thought about his answer, eventually nodded. \u0027Actually, I believe I was an accident, too,\u0027 he said. \u0027The product of a one-in-a-million combination of events. Anyway, I\u0027ve warned you about Perchorsk. You risk your life staying there.\u0027 \u0027Do you think I don\u0027t know that?\u0027 Luchov shrugged. \u0027Still, it\u0027s my job. I\u0027ll see it through. And you. What will you do now?\u0027 \u0027After I\u0027ve taken you back? I have to know what\u0027s on the other side of that Gate. There has to be more there than the nightmares you\u0027ve described.\u0027 There had to be, for how else could little Harry and his mother exist there? If they exist there. But what if there are other dimensions beyond that one? What if Harry Jnr has taken his mother even further afield? Harry dropped Luchov off outside the great sliding doors of the service bays, left him in the grey morning light and the sullen snow, hammering at the wicket-gate and bellowing to be let in. Then Harry went to Luchov\u0027s quarters (which he found empty and locked from the outside), where he donned a white smock which on his last visit he\u0027d seen hanging there. The smock was the insignia of a Projekt scientist or technician. In the garment\u0027s pocket he found tinted spectacles and put them on. And without more ado he went straight to the magmass heart of the place, materializing on the Saturn\u0027s-rings circumference midway between two sets of manned Katushev cannons. He stayed perfectly still, held a Mobius door fixed in his mind, ready to take cover - but all seemed well. A soldier lounging against the smooth magmass wall saw him, looked a little startled, straightened up and gave a half-hearted salute. Harry stared hard at him, much to the man\u0027s discomfort, then turned and scanned the great unnatural cavern in which he found himself. Especially he stared at the blinding white sphere which was the Gate... There were other technicians about. Everyone looked tired following their night-shift, even the gunners in their padded bucket-seats where they sighted their weapons on the Gate. Two scientists walked past Harry, talking, moving in the direction of the walkway to the sphere. One of them glanced his way as they passed, smiled and nodded in a familiar manner. Harry wondered who the man thought he was. He nodded back, began to follow the pair, and as he drew level with the walkway turned off and moved toward the centre, heading directly for the sphere of light. Behind him a soldier shouted: \u0027Hey! - not in our line of fire, sir! Regulations!\u0027 Harry glanced back casually over his shoulder and kept going. He left the outer platform behind and moved onto the walkway. Even as the gate in the electrified fence began to close, he passed through it, reached the spot where the boards were scorched. Behind him the gates opened again; footsteps came hurrying; Harry was aware of a low, angry muttering. But he was more aware of the Katushevs aimed directly at him; or rather not trained on him but on the Gate, which amounted to the same thing. \u0027Sir!\u0027 a voice shouted in his ear, from directly behind him. Harry conjured a Mobius door - and with a tremor of unaccustomed panic saw that it was all wrong! The outline of the door wasn\u0027t clear-cut in Harry\u0027s mind. Its edges shimmered like a heat-haze mirage. It floated up alongside him, drifted toward the sphere as if attracted by it, and was held there, gradually fading where it trembled above the wooden walkway. Harry had seen nothing like this before. He conjured a second door with the same result: the sphere both attracted and repelled the doors; it made them less substantial, pinned them down and broke them up. It cancelled them! A hand fell on Harry\u0027s shoulder, and at the same time he heard shouts from the wide wooden staircase where it emerged from the magmass shaft. Someone with a high-pitched voice was screaming: \u0027He\u0027s here! He\u0027s here!\u0027 As the Sergeant who\u0027d grabbed Harry\u0027s shoulder turned him about-face, he glanced toward the stairs, saw Chingiz Khuv and a second man coming down from the shaft. Harry thought: God! Doesn\u0027t that bastard ever sleep? Khuv seemed to be holding his companion up, keeping him from toppling headlong. The man he helped was one of the espers Harry had struck while he was laying his smoke screen. And he was the one who was doing all the shouting. Then he pointed directly at Harry �C screamed one last time, \"That\u0027s him!\u0027 - and Khuv\u0027s dark gaze followed his shaking hand. Khuv\u0027s eyes blazed in a moment. \u0027Open fire!\u0027 he shouted at once. He too pointed at Harry, shouting, \u0027Shoot him! Kill him! He\u0027s an intruder!\u0027 The Sergeant who had taken hold of Harry let go of him, stepped back, went to draw the pistol at his hip. Harry moved quickly after him, drop-kicked him and sent him flying off the walkway. Falling to the boards, Harry stayed low, out of the line of fire of the Katushevs. He conjured a Mobius door level with the walkway, hanging over empty space. It was his notion to dive headlong through it - but the door shimmered and warped, was drawn up and toward the sphere of light! Harry could hear the Katushev commander yelling: Target to the front - take aim - \u0027 and knew that the next command would be \u0027fire!\u0027 He mustn\u0027t be here when that order was given. Before the shimmering, disintegrating door could disappear entirely, he sprang for it. Even though it appeared printed on the very face of the sphere itself, still it was his one chance. He passed through the door - into a hell of physical and mental agony! When Harry regained consciousness he was adrift in the Mobius Continuum, apparently in motion through a region of the continuum which was new to him. His body and his psyche both felt badly battered, and that sixth sense of Harry\u0027s which was usually sharp as a razor felt tarnished and dull. Not without a deal of effort, he formed the mental equations and conjured a door; it opened on deep voids of space shot with stars in alien constellations. He closed the door at once and groped for others. He found a door on future-time and peered through it. No blue life-threads raced into the future here, only his own, which bent violently aside beyond the door to disappear at right-angles to Harry\u0027s viewpoint. The past was equally hostile: indeed there seemed to be no past in this place, just an ocean of interminable, impersonal stars. The lack of human activity, of even traces of activity, reinforced Harry\u0027s opinion that he had been blown off-track and had left the mundane world of men far behind. Beginning to panic, he tried one last door - and gazed out on the surface of a roaring furnace star! He closed that door, too, then forced himself into a state of calm, a condition in which he might at least apply a little reason to the problem. He was lost, yes, but what is lost can be found again. He didn\u0027t know where he was or how he had got here, true, but since he had come here there must be a way back. Except... space is a big place and Harry Keogh felt like an exceedingly tiny mote in the eye of the infinite. Then- Harry? whispered a familiar, distant voice in his mind. I thought I recognized you! The voice sped closer, rapidly grew stronger. But what\u0027s this? Are you trespassing? \u0027Mobius! Thank God!\u0027 said Harry. God? That\u0027s outside my line of research, Harry, Mobius told him. I prefer to thank my equations, if it\u0027s all the same to you. Though I suppose it could be argued that they are one and the same! \u0027How come you\u0027re out here?\u0027 Harry was calmer now. \u0027Wherever \"here\" is.\u0027 Here is in the constellation of Orion, Mobius answered. And the point is, what are you doing out here? Harry explained. Hmm! Mobius mused. Well, first let\u0027s get you home again, and then we\u0027ll see if we can find an explanation for what\u0027s happened. If you\u0027ll just follow me... Harry stayed with Mobius, sped with him homeward, materialized in the Leipzig graveyard. It was evening, which told him he\u0027d spent an entire day (or possibly two?) in the Mobius Continuum. In the grey, wintry light of the graveyard, Harry blinked, staggered; his legs wouldn\u0027t hold him up, so he sat down on the gravel beside Mobius\u0027s marker. You could do with a good long rest, my boy! Mobius told him. \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 Harry agreed. \u0027But first I\u0027d like to know if you can explain what happened to me.\u0027 I think 1 can, yes, said the mathematician. You yourself have likened my strip dimension to a parallel plane, and this gate at Perchorsk leads to another; they are both gates between planes of existence. Both are negative conditions, blemishes on the perfect surface of normal space-time. Now: take two magnets and push their negative poles together, and what happens? \u0027They repel one another,\u0027 Harry shrugged. Exactly. And so does the gate and the doors which you create in your mind. But the Perchorsk Gate is stronger, and so the repulsion is that much more fierce. When you used that door close to this sphere gateway, you were hurled across the Mobius Continuum like a shot from a gun! Your equations were warped out of focus; your body underwent stresses it could never hope to survive in the physical world; in three-dimensioned space you would have died instantly! The continuum itself saved you, because it is infinitely resilient. Lesson: you may not impose your metaphysical self upon the Gate. Go through it as a man, by all means, if you must; but never again attempt entry using the Mobius Continuum. Harry frowned, then slowly nodded. \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I\u0027ve been foolish - but that wasn\u0027t entirely my fault. I hadn\u0027t intended to use the continuum in conjunction with the Gate, it just worked out that way. But my curiosity has worked against me. I had to see what this Gate looked like - see it with my own eyes. And by now there won\u0027t be a man in the entire Perchorsk Projekt who doesn\u0027t know what I look like! The next time I stick my nose in there, be sure someone will blow it right off my face.\u0027 What will you do? Harry leaned back against the headstone and sighed. \u0027I don\u0027t know. But I know I\u0027m tired.\u0027 Go home, said Mobius. Sleep, rest. Things will be that much clearer in your mind when you wake up. Harry said his thanks, his farewells, did as Mobius advised. He emerged back in Jazz Simmons\u0027s flat in a prone position two inches over his bed, gently fell onto it. Almost before his head hit the pillows he was asleep...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-17.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
