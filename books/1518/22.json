He wanted to speak to everyone who lived in or was supported by the garden, and he must do it now, while there was still time. He stood on a balcony under the hollow eaves of his house and addressed guests, Travellers, trogs, making no distinction. His mother was there, too, for a little while, before she went indoors. Smiling, sweet, grey-haired and quite bereft of mind, but happy too in her ignorance. Harry Snr couldn\u0027t bear to look at her, forgetting that in his Alec Kyle body she wouldn\u0027t recognize him. He was glad when she went inside. And anyway, to her it had all been so long, long ago.\\n\\n \u0027Friends, it\u0027s time for truths,\u0027 Harry Jnr held up his arms and the low hubbub of voices was stilled. \u0027It\u0027s time for you to make up your minds about certain things. I haven\u0027t deliberately misled you, but neither have I told you everything. Well, now I want to put that right. There are some of you here who have nothing to fight for. This just isn\u0027t your fight at all. You came or were sent here by the will of others. And I can just as easily take you out of it. Zek, Jazz, Harry, I\u0027m talking to you.\\n\\n \u0027As for you Travellers, you can return to your travelling. The way is open to you: go now, down the saddle and through the passes to Sunside. And you trogs: you can be down on the plain on Starside and hidden away in your caves - or in other, safer places - long before the Wamphyri strike. But you should all be aware that they will strike, and soon.\u0027\\n\\n A low, massed moaning went up from his shuffling, bewildered trogs; Harry, Zek and Jazz looked at each other in dismay; a young male Traveller cried: \u0027But why, Dweller? You are powerful. You have given us weapons. We can kill the Wamphyri! Why do you send us away?\u0027\\n\\n Harry Jnr looked down on him. \u0027Are the Wamphyri your enemies?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes!\u0027 they all cried. And: \u0027They always have been,\u0027 shouted the same young man.\\n\\n \u0027And do you desire to kill them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes!\u0027 again the massed shout. \u0027All of them!\u0027\\n\\n He nodded. \u0027Aye, all of them. And you trogs. There was a time when you served a Wamphyri Lord. Would you now turn against them?\u0027\\n\\n There came a brief, grunted discussion. \u0027For you, Dweller, aye,\u0027 answered their spokesman. \u0027We know good from evil, and you are good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you, Harry - father? You\u0027ve been a scourge on vampires in your own world. Do you hate them still?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know what they would do to my world,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027Yes, I would hate them in this and any world.\u0027\\n\\n Harry Jnr looked at them all, his eyes behind his golden mask flitting over them where they stood in a body. Finally his gaze fell on Zek and Jazz. \u0027And you two,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can take you out of here, back where you came from. Do you know that? Any place in your world where you want to go. Do you understand?\u0027\\n\\n They looked at each other, then Jazz said, \u0027If you can do it now, then you can do it later. You saved us once, not so long ago. And we\u0027ve faced the Wamphyri before. How can you think we\u0027ll run out on you?\u0027\\n\\n Again Harry Jnr\u0027s nod. \u0027Let me tell you how it is,\u0027 he said. \u0027Before most of you came here, at a time when I was beginning to build something here and had only my trogs to help me, I found a wolf on the hillside. His pack had turned on him, attacked him. He was badly torn, dying -I thought. I didn\u0027t know or understand the things I know now. I took the wolf in, healed him, made him well. Soon he was up on his feet again. Too soon, and I thought I had saved his life. But in fact he\u0027d been saved by the creature within him!\u0027\\n\\n No one spoke. A hushed silence had fallen over the gathering. Harry Keogh found himself taking a step forward under the balcony, gazing fearfully up at his son.\\n\\n \u0027Father,\u0027 Harry Jnr continued, \u0027I told you there were reasons why I couldn\u0027t come back. Reasons why I must stand and defend my place. But all of you have told me how you hate and would destroy the Wamphyri. All the Wamphyri! So how can I ask you to fight for me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Harry - \u0027 his father began, only to be cut short.\\n\\n This is how the wolf repaid me,\u0027 said The Dweller. And he took off his golden mask.\\n\\n Beneath it was the face of a young Harry Keogh; Harry knew now beyond any doubt that he gazed upon his own true son. But the eyes in his face were scarlet in the twilight!\\n\\n A long, low sigh went up from the crowd. For long moments they stood and stared, began to mutter, to talk in breathless whispers. Finally the crowd began to break up, drift away in small groups. In a little while only Harry Snr, Jazz and Zek remained. And The Dweller thought: they\u0027re here because without me they have nowhere to go.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll take you out of here now,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Like hell you will!\u0027 his father growled. \u0027Come the hell down from there and explain. You might be The Dweller but you\u0027re also my flesh. You, a vampire? What kind of vampire that so many people have loved you? I don\u0027t believe it!\u0027\\n\\n Harry Jnr came down. \u0027Believe it or not,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s the truth. Oh, I\u0027m different, all right. My mind and will are too strong for it. I have mastery over it, I have it tamed. It takes me on now and then, but I\u0027m always ready and I always win. Or have so far, anyway. So the vampire works for me, and not the other way around. I get its strength, its powers, its tenacity. It gets a host, and that\u0027s all. But there are disadvantages, too. For one, I have to stay here on Starside, or close to Starside. The sunlight -real sunlight - would hurt me. But the main reason I stay here is because this has become my place. My place, my territory. No other shall have it!\u0027\\n\\n He looked at them with his scarlet eyes, smiled mirthlessly. \u0027So there you have it. And now, if you\u0027re ready...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not me,\u0027 Harry shook his head. \u0027I\u0027m staying, until this is over, anyway. I didn\u0027t look for you for eight years just to leave you now.\u0027\\n\\n Harry Jnr looked at Jazz and Zek. Jazz said: \u0027You already have our answer.\u0027\\n\\n Trogs came shuffling out of the twilight. Their spokesman said: \u0027We were Lesk\u0027s creatures, and we didn\u0027t like it. We liked working for you. Without you we have nothing. We stay and fight.\u0027\\n\\n Harry Jnr\u0027s face showed his despair. The trogs may be fast learners, but they weren\u0027t much good with his weapons. Then lanterns came bobbing, together with a familiar jingling, from the direction of the Traveller dwellings.\\n\\n Jazz and Zek tried to count heads; pointless, there were as many as before. Maybe eighty of them. Not a man, woman or child had run out.\\n\\n \u0027So,\u0027 said Harry Snr, looking at them all where they regrouped themselves, \u0027it looks like we stand and fight!\u0027\\n\\n His son could only throw up his hands in amazement. And gladness, Harry thought...\\n\\n An hour later at The Dweller\u0027s armoury, Jazz Simmons had finished handing out German-made pump-action shotguns and shells to the Travellers. The armoury was well-stocked and there were weapons for everyone. There were half-a-dozen flame-throwers, too, and Travellers who had been trained in their use. Harry Jnr was there to point out that the shells for the shotguns were probably the most expensive ammunition ever made; their shot was pure silver. Though most of the equipment had been stolen (Harry Jnr made no bones about it; he believed the manufacturers were well able to stand the loss), he\u0027d been obliged to order and buy these shells. Jazz, ever practical, had asked how they\u0027d been paid for. With Traveller gold, he\u0027d been told, of which this world had an abundance. The Travellers considered it pretty, and of course it was very malleable; on the other hand it was much too heavy to carry around in large amounts, and far too soft for serious metalworking. It made nice baubles, which was about as much as could be said for it!\\n\\n For himself, Jazz had chosen a heavy caliber machine-gun, a Russian job firing a mix of tracer and explosive shells. The weapon could be used with a tripod or carried in both arms; it took a strong man to handle it. Jazz knew the gun and had trained with it; it was capable of laying down a deadly and shattering barrage of fire.\\n\\n \u0027But still,\u0027 he told The Dweller, \u0027from what I\u0027ve seen of Wamphyri warriors, I\u0027d say these things are toys.\u0027\\n\\n Harry Jnr nodded, but: The flame-throwers are not toys,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I assure you the Wamphyri won\u0027t like this silver shot! Still, I take your meaning. One warrior - even a dozen - but forty? Ah, but you haven\u0027t seen all my weapons!\u0027 He showed Jazz a grenade.\\n\\n Jazz weighed the thing in his hand. It was as large as an orange and very heavy. He shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t know this one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s American,\u0027 The Dweller told him. \u0027For clearing pill-boxes and foxholes. A very grim weapon: it shivers into fragments of blazing metallic phosphorus!\u0027\\n\\n Meanwhile, Harry Snr had used the Mobius Continuum (for the first time in this world) to convey two very important Travellers to a nearby peak rearing high over most of the others. They knew their job and had practiced it on many previous occasions. In a hollowed-out depression at the peak\u0027s crest, literally an \u0027aerie\u0027 in its own right, great mirrors had been rigged on swivels to catch the dying sun\u0027s rays and hurl them down - or up - at any attackers. The Travellers also had shotguns and bandoliers of vampire-lethal shells.\\n\\n As Harry dropped off his astonished charges and prepared to return to the garden, so his keen eyes spotted something approaching in the sky. As yet it was two or three miles east of the garden, but even at that distance its size and shape made it unmistakable. A flyer, like Shaithis\u0027s mount!\\n\\n The Travellers had seen it too. \u0027Shall we try to burn it?\u0027 they cried, springing to their mirror-weapons.\\n\\n \u0027One flyer?\u0027 Harry frowned. Instinct cautioned him against abrupt action. \u0027Not unless it makes an attack on the garden.\u0027\\n\\n He went back there, looked for Harry Jnr. Instead he found Zek Foener, her eyes closed where she stood facing east and slightly north, one trembling hand to her brow. \u0027Is something wrong, Zek?\u0027 Harry asked.\\n\\n \u0027No, Harry,\u0027 she answered, without opening her eyes. \u0027something\u0027s right! The Lady Karen is coming to join us.\\n\\n She wants to fight on our side. She has four fine warriors, but they\u0027re holding back until she calls to them. Now... she wants to know if it\u0027s safe for her to land.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s not attacking us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s joining us!\u0027 Zek repeated. \u0027You don\u0027t know her like I do, Harry. She\u0027s different.\u0027\\n\\n Karen was closer now, a mile at the outside but still wary, still holding off. Everyone in the garden had seen her. Jazz Simmons came hurrying, a shining brass belt dangling from the ammo-housing of his gun. \u0027What is it?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n At the same moment The Dweller had materialized. Zek spoke to both men, told them what she\u0027d told Harry Snr. \u0027Harry,\u0027 The Dweller turned to his father. \u0027Go and tell the Travellers to hold their fire. Let\u0027s see if she\u0027s genuine.\u0027\\n\\n Before anything else, Harry detoured straight to the peak where the Travellers manned their mirror-weapons. He passed on Harry Jnr\u0027s message, then spread the word right through the garden and its defenders. Meanwhile, Zek had told the Lady Karen: land in front of the wall, between the wall and the cliffs.\\n\\n Karen\u0027s flyer swept closer, swooped lower, swiftly grew larger in the sky. Far behind it, four dark shapes made spurting motions across the star-sprinkled indigo of the heavens. Tiny at this distance, still everyone knew how big they really were, knew what they really were. \u0027Here she comes,\u0027 Zek breathed.\\n\\n The flyer, turning face-on to a low night wind that moaned from the west, dropped lower. It seemed to hover for a moment, like a kite, then dipped down and uncoiled its nest of springy worm \u0027legs\u0027 to the earth. It bumped gently down, lowered its wings for stability. The thing parked there, swaying and nodding hugely, gazing with vacuous disinterest first at the garden, then down the sweeping ramps of the mountains to the plain, then back to the garden. Karen dismounted, came to the wall. She was dressed - or undressed - to cause consternation, as was her wont.\\n\\n The two Harrys, Jazz and Zek met her there. It was Zek\u0027s impulse to hug her, but she held back. She saw that Jazz was immediately shaken, stricken by Karen\u0027s looks. Harry Snr, too: awed by Karen\u0027s beauty. It was an unearthly beauty, of course, for it was the work of her vampire. But what it had given her in looks, shape and desirability, it had taken from her in the bloody fire of her eyes. She was unmistakably Wamphyri.\\n\\n Only The Dweller seemed unmoved. \u0027You\u0027ve come to join us in the coming battle?\u0027 His voice was unemotional.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve come to die with you,\u0027 she answered.\\n\\n \u0027Oh? And is it that certain?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Certain?\u0027 she repeated him. \u0027If you believe in miracles, pray for one! For myself, I don\u0027t care.\u0027 And she told them her dilemma, reinforcing what Zek Foener had already made known, how whichever way she jumped the Wamphyri meant to be rid of her. This way ... at least I\u0027ll take a few of them with me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What of your trogs, your lieutenants?\u0027 The Dweller pressed her.\\n\\n \u0027I activated my trogs, turned them loose,\u0027 she answered. \u0027My \"lieutenants\", as you call them, are faint-hearted dogs! Them I sent away. Maybe the Lords have taken them on. I neither know nor care.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your aerie stands empty?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Aye.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve sacrificed a lot.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she tossed her head, \u0027I have been sacrificed. And now you\u0027d better make your final preparations. You can\u0027t hear them but I can, and they\u0027re on their way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s right,\u0027 Zek confirmed it. \u0027Their minds are lusting for war, open to read like reading a monstrous book. They\u0027re coming!\u0027\\n\\n The Dweller nodded, pointed to the four dark shapes squirting down through the darkening sky. \u0027Your warriors. Karen - are they trustworthy?\u0027\\n\\n They answer only my commands,\u0027 she answered.\\n\\n Then station two of them at the back of the saddle, over the rise there,\u0027 and again he pointed, \u0027and the other pair down there, at the foot of the cliffs where the first trees grow. There they\u0027ll form our protection - some protection, at least - and they\u0027ll be well-positioned for launching, if the need should arise. And how will you fight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In the thick of it!\u0027 She swept back her diaphanous cloak from her right side, took her gauntlet from her belt and thrust her right hand into it. Blades, hooks and scythes gleamed silver in the bright starlight where she flexed the deadly thing, adjusting its fit.\\n\\n \u0027Look!\u0027 Jazz snapped. \u0027I see them.\u0027\\n\\n It was impossible not to see them. The sky to the east was dark with dots large and small, like the approach of a small swarm of locusts. Except, while they were just as ravenous, they were not small and they were not locusts.\\n\\n \u0027Everyone to his station!\u0027 The Dweller cried. \u0027Are those lamps in order?\u0027 For answer, all along the wall, Travellers turned on their batteries of ultraviolet lamps, aiming them down into darkness. They cut the night with their hot, smoking beams. The light wouldn\u0027t kill vampire flesh, but they would hurt it greatly and blind Wamphyri eyes, however temporarily.\\n\\n The Dweller caught the elbow of a passing Traveller. \u0027What of your women and children?\u0027 he asked. \u0027And my mother?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gone, Dweller,\u0027 the man answered. \u0027Down toward Sunside, where they\u0027ll stay until they know the outcome.\u0027\\n\\n Harry Jnr turned to his father and the others. He nodded grimly. Then we\u0027re ready,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Just as well,\u0027 Jazz Simmons answered, \u0027for it\u0027s already started.\u0027 He inclined his head down toward Starside. \u0027Listen -\u0027\\n\\n Hoarse trog cries and the clamour of battle drifted up out of the shadows. The roar and blast of gunfire, too, from a handful of trogs whose learning skills had been able to accommodate weapons.\\n\\n Harry Jnr said: \u0027Well, this was to be expected. The Lords have been massing their trogs along the fringes of these mountains for a long time now. There\u0027ll be many hundreds of them... but I may have their measure.\u0027 He turned to his father. \u0027Harry, I could use some expert help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just name it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When did you last call up the dead?\u0027\\n\\n Harry took a pace back from the other, his face falling. But then he slowly nodded. \u0027Whatever\u0027s in your mind, I\u0027m ready when you are, son,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n They rode the Mobius Continuum down to the plain of boulders, materializing clear of the mountains and their shadows. Up in the gloomy foothills where they met the mountains proper, there they saw dust-clouds boiling up from what could only be furious fighting. Also, amidst the rumble and roil, the occasional flash and crack! of a discharged weapon. The two Harrys moved closer, taking a short jump that brought them to the very fringe of the fighting. And already it was clear that The Dweller\u0027s trog troops were on the retreat. A thin brave line of shuffling Neanderthals, they fell back under the massive assault of others just like them, driven ever higher into the sullen foothills. But in fact the Wamphyri trogs were not like them, because they were slaves and The Dweller\u0027s trogs were free. Which was why they fought.\\n\\n When Harry Jnr saw how it was going he groaned. \u0027I\u0027d like to save some of them if I can,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Harry Keogh, Necroscope, closed his eyes and talked to the teeming dead of this strange world. \u0027We need your help,\u0027 he begged of them. \u0027You down there, in the earth, under the soil and down where the roots twine. We need your help against a great injustice.\u0027\\n\\n Things stirred in the ground, heard the desperate voice of a friend and tried to answer him. Who? What? Help you? But how can we help?\\n\\n \u0027Trogs!\u0027 said Harry Jnr. \u0027Before the Wamphyri, they roved over Starside at will. Thousands of them lived and died here. They were their own masters then, and this was their land.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How about it?\u0027 Harry spoke to them as he always spoke to the dead, as his friends, his equals. Even as his peers. \u0027If you\u0027re dust then you\u0027re beyond helping us, but if you can still hear me, if you can understand, then listen.\u0027 He told them what was required. Harry Jnr, too, answering the stumbling questions of the dead.\\n\\n The Wamphyri, you say? Some of us served them in life. Many of us, many hundreds, died in their wars. False gods! Vile, terrible masters! But fight them? How? They\u0027ll destroy us again, a second time.\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t die twice,\u0027 Harry and The Dweller were desperate. \u0027Only your brothers can die; and they\u0027re doing it right now, dying, to hold back the troops of the Wamphyri.\u0027\\n\\n Troops? You mean trogs like us?\\n\\n \u0027Trogs, yes,\u0027 said The Dweller, \u0027but slaves of the Wamphyri. Death holds no terrors for such as them. It is preferable to what they have now!\u0027\\n\\n The Dweller speaks truth, some of Harry Jnr\u0027s own trogs, recently dead in the fighting, joined in. We at least know you. Dweller, and we gladly rise up again!\\n\\n \u0027What of the rest of you?\u0027 Harry Snr cried. \u0027Will you not also rise up? Wake up now, before it\u0027s too late. You have sons and grandsons and great-grandsons who are fighting even now. Join us in this last great battle against your immemorial vampire oppressors!\u0027\\n\\n In the cliffs backing these foothills, in ancient cavern burial grounds, the preserved, mummified bodies of a thousand trogs stirred, groped upward, tore free of the clinging soil. Under the trees, lone graves gave up their dead. Behind the massed Wamphyri trogs where they drove back the defenders, freshly dead cadavers sat up, forced their riven bodies to move, shuffled or crawled toward their vampire-controlled enemies. The stench of the pit filled the air. They came from the shadows, from mildewed graves and niches, from all their many resting places beyond life.\\n\\n The Dweller\u0027s trog forces, when they saw what now battled on their side - even though they were on their side, hemming the invaders in all about - broke in terror and fled for their secret places. No matter, the grim army of the dead would do their work for them. And they would win, for as the Necroscopes had pointed out, they couldn\u0027t die twice.\\n\\n Shrieks of terror split the night, wrenched from hundreds of Wamphyri-trog throats when they saw and understood what they were fighting. Sickened, the two Harrys turned away from the carnage. But -\\n\\n \u0027Son,\u0027 said Harry Snr, grasping the other\u0027s arm. \u0027Look!\u0027\\n\\n The sky was dark with Wamphyri flyers and warriors. They circled the garden, descending toward it. And some of the warriors were truly gigantic; any five of them, falling on the garden in unison, would totally obscure and obliterate it. Up there in the mountains, even now, a greater battle was about to be waged...\\n\\n They took their own special route back to the garden.\\n\\n Warriors had already landed below the cliffs fronting the wall, where the Lady Karen\u0027s creatures were now locked in hellish combat with them. Their shrieking and bellowing alone was deafening. Other warriors circled, looking for an opening in the ultraviolet searchlight beams which swept the sky and seared their hides.\\n\\n Up on a certain peak, mirror-weapons blinked out as Lesk the Glut deliberately crashed his flyer down on the Travellers who sweated and swore and died there. But they\u0027d seen him coming; before his flyer struck they had turned their shotguns on it, pumping shot after shot at both beast and rider right to the end. Lesk, wounded and more dangerous than ever, goaded his half-crippled beast to slither free of the peak, directed it in an insane suicide dive on the heart of the garden.\\n\\n He was seen; smoking ray-beams converged blindingly on him; his flyer felt artificial sunlight eating at its hide, burning in its many eyes. It reared back from its headlong dive, pulled up, swooped low over the garden. Then someone threw a grenade, which exploded directly in front of the beast. With its spatulate head blazing, screaming like a safety-valve under high pressure, it swooped to earth, struck the wall and carried a great section of it away, and with it several defenders. The creature\u0027s huge manta body tore up the earth, somersaulted like a derailed train, hurled Lesk out of the saddle.\\n\\n Other flyers swept down out of the darkness on the periphery. They crashed among the greenhouses and allotments, floundered in the pools. Down from their backs sprang lieutenants of Shaithis, Belath and Volse, to create carnage within the garden itself. Jazz Simmons saw them; he tracked them with tracers and streams of exploding shells. Two at least ducked away into the shadows and smoke, to commence their task of cold butchery on whichever Travellers or trogs they should come across.\\n\\n Jazz saw Harry and his son on the balcony of the latter\u0027s house. They watched the battle. He breathlessly called up: \u0027How\u0027s it going?\u0027\\n\\n In the glare and sweep of hot beams, the booming of automatic weapons, howling of monsters and cries of men, it was hard to say. \u0027We should be in this!\u0027 Harry said to his son.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 the other shook his head. \u0027We\u0027re the last resort.\u0027\\n\\n Harry didn\u0027t understand, but he trusted.\\n\\n Zek came running, caught Jazz\u0027s arm where he stood by The Dweller\u0027s house. \u0027Look!\u0027 she cried.\\n\\n High overhead a warrior dragged some bloated, puffing, incredible thing through the sky. A second warrior, higher, was similarly burdened. Scything searchlight beams cut across them and Zek gasped: \u0027Gas-beasts!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Jazz gaped. He saw the bloated thing cut loose, begin drifting like some obscene balloon down toward the garden. The thing drifted a little northward, over the wall, where the battery of searchlights was concentrated. The beams picked it out, centered upon it, and it began to smoke. Puffing black evaporation and clouds of steam, it settled faster toward earth.\\n\\n Jazz saw the strategy. \u0027AW he cried. Then he grabbed Zek, threw her down and hurled himself on top of her.\\n\\n The gas-beast - a living creature, once a man - issued a hissing, high-pitched scream as its skin blackened and ruptured - and then it blew itself to bits with all the force of a thousand-pound bomb! The ray-gunners directly underneath it died instantly in the blast, their bodies and equipment flattened. At a stroke, one-third of The Dweller\u0027s defences had been wiped out.\\n\\n A foul, stinking hot wind blew across the garden, and when it cleared Jazz helped Zek to her feet. The Dweller\u0027s house was still standing, but all of its windows had been blown in and half of its roof was missing. Harry and his son had ducked inside the space under the eaves in the moment before the blast; now they came out, white and shaken.\\n\\n More warriors had landed at the back of the saddle. There they fought with Karen\u0027s creatures, overwhelming and quickly silencing them. But there were Travellers back there and they were armed with grenades; lobbing their deadly eggs, they gave the warriors blow for blow.\\n\\n Lieutenants of the Wamphyri seemed to be ravaging in every quarter of the garden, their war-gauntlets drenched in Traveller blood. The night was covered with smoke and stench, split by shotgun blasts, made still more hellish in the surreal slash of searing light and long moments of total blindness...\\n\\n Down by the shattered wall, the Lady Karen saw something coming up out of the smoke-filled depression. It crawled, but as it reached level ground reared up and charged! It was the mad Lord Lesk, bloodiest of all the Wamphyri, almost fully recovered and little the worse for his wounds and the tumble he\u0027d taken. He saw Karen, rushed upon her full of nightmare intent.\\n\\n She thrust aside a dazed Traveller and turned his lamp\u0027s beam full in Lesk\u0027s hideous face, blinding his eye. He cursed, clapped a hand to his face, came on and kicked the lamp from her grasp. Half-blind, he turned his left side toward her, glared his fury from the lidless eye in his shoulder. But as he swung his gauntlet, so his body turned with the swing and he again lost sight of her. She ducked under Lesk\u0027s arcing blow, tore away the flesh and ribs from his left side with one raking, razor-sharp swipe of her own gauntlet.\\n\\n He cried out, staggered, gasped his amazement. He felt fumblingly with his free hand at the terrible damage to his body. His heart pounded like a great yellow bellows, plainly visible against the dark, pulsing sac of his exposed left lung. Travellers leaped on him, tried to trip him and drag him down. While he roared and raged, Karen stepped in and grasped his naked heart with her awesome weapon-hand. She cut the heart\u0027s pipes and tore it out of his body. He coughed blood, puffed himself up ... and toppled like a felled tree! The Travellers fell on him like wolves, beheaded him, poured oil on his body and set fire to it. Lesk went up in flames.\\n\\n Meanwhile:\\n\\n A second gas-beast had come drifting directly toward The Dweller\u0027s house. The two Harrys fled the place, encountered a pair of Wamphyri lieutenants in their way. Their strategy in dealing with them proved their kinship: they let the grinning, gauntleted vampires close with them and charge, then ducked through Mobius doors. As their pursuers plunged into that unknown realm directly on their heels, so they closed the doors and exited through others. The lieutenants had simply disappeared; perhaps faint echoes of their screams came back, to be quickly drowned in the row and confusion of battle.\\n\\n The mewling gas-beast over The Dweller\u0027s house was hit by a stray burst of gunfire. It exploded with a devastating roar, demolishing the place and sending out a great rush of vile stench.\\n\\n Warriors were coming over the saddle behind the settlement. Another crashed down on the low structure housing Harry Jnr\u0027s generators. The remaining ultraviolet lamps blinked out, leaving only a handful of lanterns and starlight to light the reeling night. The bellowing voices of the Lords Belath and Menor Maimbite sounded inside the garden! From overhead, the Lord Shaithis shouted down instructions.\\n\\n Still reeling from the gas-beast blast, Harry clutched his son\u0027s arm. \u0027You said we were a last resort,\u0027 he breathlessly reminded him. \u0027Whatever you meant by that - whatever\u0027s on your mind - you\u0027d better say it now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Father,\u0027 the other answered, \u0027in the Mobius Continuum even thought has weight. And you and I, we\u0027re linked. Wherever we are in the Mobius Continuum, we know each other.\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve done things with and to the Continuum that you\u0027ve never dreamed of,\u0027 The Dweller continued, but innocently, without boasting. \u0027I can send more than mere thoughts through it - as long as there\u0027s someone to receive what I send. In this instance, however, what I must send is dangerous. Not to you, but to me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t follow you.\u0027 Desperately aware that the battle was being lost, Harry licked suddenly dry lips, shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027But you will.\u0027 Quickly, The Dweller explained.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got you,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027But won\u0027t it hurt the garden, the Travellers?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure. A little, perhaps. Nothing serious or lasting. But you should get the Lady Karen out of the way.\u0027 He went running back to the ruins of his house, found a shimmering metallic robe of foil where he\u0027d stored it and put it on. It covered him from head to toe, with tinted glass discs for his eyes. \u0027I\u0027ve used it before,\u0027 he said, \u0027out beyond the stars. Now you\u0027d better see to Karen.\u0027\\n\\n Harry had followed him, said: \u0027Where will I find you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here. I\u0027ll wait for you.\u0027\\n\\n Harry used the Mobius Continuum and went to the wall. Men with flame-throwers were hosing down a stricken warrior; Karen fought with a lieutenant, dispatching him even as Harry arrived. \u0027Don\u0027t question this,\u0027 he said. \u0027Come, quickly!\u0027\\n\\n He caught her up, stepped through a Mobius door, emerged down on the plain of boulders at a safe distance from the glaring sphere Gate. Dazed, she swayed for a moment and her scarlet eyes went round as saucers. \u0027How .?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which is your stack?\u0027 he asked her.\\n\\n She pointed and he caught her to him again...\\n\\n Harry left her in her deserted aerie, returned to the garden. His son was waiting. \u0027Do you understand?\u0027 The Dweller wanted to know.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027Let\u0027s get on with it.\u0027\\n\\n They entered the Mobius Continuum and Harry Jnr moved away very quickly, across the mountains to Sun-side and from there -\\n\\n - To the sun! He stood off from that monstrous furnace in deep space, opened a Mobius door. Harry heard his hiss of torment, also his directed thought: Now!\\n\\n Harry opened a Mobius door on the garden, trapped and fixed it there, let his son re-direct and pour sunlight through the Mobius Continuum and out through Harry\u0027s door. The garden was at once bathed in intense, glaring, golden light!\\n\\n Harry turned the door like the gun-turret of a tank, sending his shaft of concentrated sunlight sliding across the garden. The beam struck warriors where they ravaged forward across the saddle. It ate into them like acid, devouring their vampire flesh. For this was sunlight, but not thinned by distance, not diluted by atmosphere. It was the essence of the sun! The monsters melted, boiled away and slumped down into sticky black pools.\\n\\n Ahhh! The Dweller\u0027s agony was a fire in its own right, burning in his father\u0027s mind. The beam shut off, gave Harry time to recoup, rest from the task of holding steady and controlling his Mobius door.\\n\\n \u0027Son?\u0027 his anxious thoughts went out along the Mobius way. \u0027Are you all right?\u0027\\n\\n No!... Yes. Yes, I\u0027m all right. Give me a moment...\\n\\n Harry waited, conjured a door and looked out. He chose new targets: the Lords Belath and Menor where they came striding through a host of panicking Travellers, swatting them like flies.\\n\\n Now!\\n\\n Harry fixed the door, guided his son\u0027s sun-blast through it. The brilliant beam fell on Belath and Menor like a solid shaft of gold. It super-heated them, blew away their skins and flesh in writhing, stinking evaporation. As the Travellers scrambled wildly away from them, they exploded into tatters of smouldering vileness.\\n\\n Harry turned his beam to the north, found a warrior in mid-air, descending toward the defenders at the wall. He shrivelled the thing before it could come too close, reduced it to a tarry fireball that fell well beyond the cliffs. Other warriors were overhead, and flyers with their startled riders. Harry swung the door horizontally, turned its beam into a giant searchlight. The sun shone upwards, from the earth!\\n\\n Monstrous debris rained from the sky, and: Ahhh! Again the beam was shut off.\\n\\n \u0027Son! son!\u0027 Harry cried into the Mobius Continuum. \u0027Let that be an end to it. They\u0027re beaten, moving off. Stop now, before you kill yourself!\u0027\\n\\n No! the other\u0027s Mobius voice was a shudder. They must never recover from this. Go down onto the boulder plain, close to their stacks.\\n\\n Harry understood. He did as directed.\\n\\n Now!\\n\\n The Dweller\u0027s beam reached out and licked at the base of Shaithis\u0027s stack. It played there for a moment, blazed in across bony balconies and through cartilage windows, found the gas-beasts in their places. In an uncontrollable chain-reaction of living bombs, the stack\u0027s base exploded outwards, hurling rock, bones, cartilage carcasses and all far out onto the plain. The stack teetered, crumpled downward into itself, toppled. Falling, it flew apart; but before its gigantic sections could strike earth, already Harry had redirected his beam.\\n\\n And one by one the aeries were brought crashing down on the shuddering plain, reduced to rubble, erased.\\n\\n Twice more during the work The Dweller cried out and the beam was shut off. But in the end only the Lady Karen\u0027s stack remained. And:\\n\\n Let it be, Harry Jnr whispered.\\n\\n Father and son went back to the garden. They emerged as the smoke and reek were lifting, and as the dazed Travellers and their friends from a different world looked all about them and rubbed grime from stinging eyes.\\n\\n The Dweller\u0027s cloak of foil had fused to his body. Smouldering, he swayed there a moment - a black and silver thing that groped blindly as it took a single pace forward - then crumpled into its father\u0027s arms...\\n\\n In what would have been three days Earth-time the news was: The Dweller would recover! It was the vampire in him, which given time would repair the damage he\u0027d suffered. But Harry Snr knew he could never take his son, or Brenda, back to the world where they were born. Harry Jnr was Wamphyri; however different from the others, still he must stay here forever. Indeed he wanted to stay here. This was his place now, his territory which he\u0027d fought and paid dearly for. And of course he could never be sure how things would go.\\n\\n But... the Lady Karen was different, too. For the moment, anyway. Also, if what Harry had heard about her was true, she\u0027d one day be more dangerous than all the others put together. He cared nothing for her, but he did care for his son. And an idea had formed in his mind.\\n\\n Leaving The Dweller in the care of Jazz, Zek and the ever-faithful Travellers, Harry went to Karen\u0027s aerie. It was memorable when he left the garden, because for one thing there was gold on the peaks again, and also he had witnessed a strange reunion. Wolf, his paws bleeding, had made the crossing to find his mistress. No vampire in him, just a great deal of love and a lot of faith.\\n\\n There\u0027d been another, perhaps even more joyous reunion, too: along with Wolf had come a weary Lardis Lidesci and a handful of his people... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-22.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
