{"id":62504,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Taschenka - Harry\u0027s Quest - The Trek Begins Taschenka Tassi\u0027 Kirescu was nineteen, small and slim, completely unpolitical and very frightened. Her skin was a little darker than that of the rest of her family; her eyes were large and very slightly tilted in an oval face; her hair was black and shiny to match her eyes, and she wore it in braids. Tassi\u0027s father, Kazimir, whom she hadn\u0027t seen since the night they were arrested, had used to explain jokingly that she was a throwback. There\u0027s Mongol blood in you, girl,\u0027 he\u0027d told her, his eyes sparkling. \u0027Blood of the great Khans who came this way all of those hundreds of years ago. Either that ... or I don\u0027t know your mother as well as I think I do!\u0027 Following which Anna, Tassi\u0027s mother, would invariably sputter furiously and chase him with whatever she could lay her hands on. That, of course, had been in the good times, all of a few weeks ago, which now felt like several centuries. Tassi had known nothing of Mikhail Simonov\u0027s real reason for coming to Yelizinka in the Ural foothills; the story she\u0027d heard was that he was a city boy who\u0027d been something of a wild one, that he\u0027d always been getting himself into one sort of trouble or another, until finally he\u0027d been sent logging as a punishment, a penance guaranteed to cool him off. Well, places didn\u0027t come much cooler than Yelizinka, not in the winter, anyway; but Tassi wasn\u0027t at all sure that Mikhail\u0027s blood had been cooled by it. In fact they\u0027d very quickly become lovers, in a strange sort of way. Strange because he\u0027d always been quick to warn her that it couldn\u0027t last, and that therefore she mustn\u0027t fall in love with him; strange, too, in that she\u0027d felt exactly the same way about it: he\u0027d serve his time here and wipe his record clean, and then he\u0027d move on, probably back to the city, Moscow, and she would find herself a husband from the logging communities around. The attraction had been the loneliness she\u0027d felt in him, and a contradictory bowstring tension lying just beneath the surface of him. For his part: once, in a dreamy, faraway moment, he\u0027d told her that she was the only real thing in his life right now, that sometimes he felt the entire world and his place in it were just an enormous fantasy. And now she\u0027d been told that he was a foreign spy, which to Tassi had seemed like the greatest possible fantasy - at first. But that had been before they took her down into the Perchorsk Projekt. Since then... everything had turned into a real fantasy, a horror story, a living nightmare. Her father had been incarcerated in the cell next door to hers and she knew he had been tortured on a number of occasions. She\u0027d heard it all coming right through the sheet-steel walls. The hoarse, terrified panting, the sharp slapping sounds, his anguished cries for mercy. But there\u0027d been precious little of that last. Then, three days ago, there\u0027d been one especially bad session; in the middle of it, at its height, the old man had screamed... and then, he\u0027d stopped screaming - abruptly. Since when Tassi had heard nothing from him at all. She couldn\u0027t even bear to think what might have happened; she hoped the silence meant that her father was now in a hospital somewhere, recovering; she prayed that\u0027s what it meant, anyway. Almost as bad had been Major Khuv\u0027s questioning. The KGB Major had not once laid a hand on her, but she\u0027d had the suspicion that if he did he would hurt her terribly. The awful thing was that she didn\u0027t have - didn\u0027t know - anything to tell him. If she had then fear on its own would have obliged her to tell it, or if not fear certainly the desire to stop them hurting her father. And then there had been the beast Vyotsky. Tassi hadn\u0027t stood so much in fear of that one as in horror of him. And she had sensed - had known instinctively - that he enjoyed her horror, feeding upon it like a ghoul on rotting flesh! There had been little or nothing sexual about his treatment of her that time when he\u0027d had her photographed naked with him. It had all been done for effect: partly to shame her, underline her vulnerability and make her feel the lowest of the low; partly to show her the power of her tormentor - that he could strip her naked, leer at her and paw her body, while she was incapable of lifting a ringer to stop him - but mainly to aid him in the mental torture of someone else. The sadist Vyotsky had told her that the photographs were for the \u0027benefit\u0027 of the British spy, Michael Simmons, whom she had known as Mikhail Simonov: \u0027to drive the poor bastard out of his mind!\u0027 Plainly the idea had delighted Vyotsky. \u0027He thinks he\u0027s so cool - hah.r he\u0027d said. \u0027If this doesn\u0027t get him boiling, then nothing will!\u0027 The KGB bully was quite mad, Tassi was sure. Even though he hadn\u0027t been back to torment her for quite some time now, still she would freeze whenever she heard someone approaching the door of her cell; and if the footsteps should pause... then her breathing would go ragged at once, and her poor heart begin beating that much faster. It had started to beat that way just a little while ago, but on this occasion her visitor was only Vyotsky\u0027s superior officer, Major Khuv. Only Major Khuv! Tassi thought, as the suave KGB officer entered her cell. That was a laugh! But she wasn\u0027t even close to laughing as he cuffed her wrist to his own, then told her: Taschenka, my dear. I want to show you something. It\u0027s something I feel you really ought to see before I question you again at any great length. You\u0027ll understand why soon enough.\u0027 Stumbling along behind him, she made no effort to even guess where he was taking her. Essentially a peasant girl, to her the Projekt was a maze, a nightmare labyrinth of steel and concrete. Her claustrophobia had so disoriented her that she was lost from the first step she took across the threshold of her cell. \u0027Tassi,\u0027 Khuv murmured, leading her on through the almost deserted, dimly lit night corridors, \u0027I want you to think very carefully. Much more carefully than you\u0027ve been thinking so far. And if there\u0027s anything at all you can tell me about the subversive activities of your brother, your father, the people of Yelizinka in general - and in particular about the underground, anti-Soviet organization to which any or all of them belonged ... I mean, this really is going to be your last chance, Tassi.\u0027 \u0027Major,\u0027 she gasped the word out, \u0027sir, I know nothing of any of these things. If my father was what you say he was -\u0027 \u0027Oh, he was,\u0027 Khuv glanced at her and nodded gravely. \u0027You may be sure that ... he was!\u0027 It was the way he said the last word, its ominous emphasis. And in a moment it had Tassi\u0027s free hand flying to her mouth. \u0027What... what have you done to him?\u0027 Her question was the merest whisper. They had arrived at a door bearing a legend familiar to Khuv but one which Tassi had never seen before. She only glanced at it; it said something about a keeper and security classified persons only. Using his plastic ID tag, and as the door\u0027s mechanisms were activated, Khuv turned to Tassi and answered her question: \u0027Done to him? To your father? Me? I have done nothing! He did it all himself - with his refusal to cooperate. A very stubborn man, Kazimir Kirescu...\u0027 The door opened with a click. Khuv held it open a crack, called out: \u0027Vasily, is all in order?\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes, Major,\u0027 came back an unctuous reply. \u0027All ready.\u0027 Khuv smiled at Tassi. The smile of a shark on its attack run. \u0027My dear,\u0027 he said, shoving the door open wide and leading her into the room of the creature, \u0027I\u0027m going to show you something unpleasant, and tell you something even more unpleasant, and finally suggest the most unpleasant thing of all. Following which you shall have the rest of the night and all day tomorrow to think about where you stand. But no more time than that.\u0027 The room was in near-darkness, to which the ceiling lights added only an eerie red glow. Tassi could make out the figure of a small man in a white smock, and the shape of a large oblong box or tank covered with a white sheet. The tank must be of glass, for a small white light in the wall behind it shone right through, casting on the sheet a milky, ghostly outline, the silhouette of something that flopped sluggishly inside the tank. \u0027Come closer,\u0027 Khuv drew Tassi toward the tank. \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid, it\u0027s perfectly safe. It can\u0027t hurt you - not yet.\u0027 Standing beside the KGB Major, unconsciously clutching his arm in her innocence as she stared wide-eyed at the weird silhouette on the sheet, Tassi heard him say to the scientist in the white smock: \u0027Very well, Vasily, let\u0027s see what we have here.\u0027 Vasily Agursky tugged at one corner of the sheet and it began to slide slowly from the tank, letting a little more of the subdued light shine through. Then the slide accelerated and the sheet whispered to the floor. The thing in the tank had its back to the three; feeling their eyes upon it, it glanced over one hunched shoulder. Tassi looked at it, stared at it in disbelief, shuddered and clung to Khuv that much more fiercely. He patted her hand almost absent-mindedly, in a fashion which in other circumstances might almost have seemed fatherly. Except this was not her father but the man who had let Karl Vyotsky terrorize her. \u0027Well, Tassi,\u0027 he said, his voice very low, very sinister, \u0027and what do you think of that?\u0027 She didn\u0027t know what to think of it, and later she would give anything to be able to forget it entirely. But for now: the shape of the thing was vaguely manlike, though even in this poor light it was quite obviously not a man. It appeared to be feeding, using taloned hands to tear its food and stuff strips of raw red meat into its mouth. Its face was mainly hidden, but Tassi could see the way its jaws worked, and the baleful glare of the very human eye that peered back over its shoulder. Hunched down, crouching or squatting there on the sandy floor of its tank, the thing might have been an ape; but its leprous skin was corrugated and its feet gripped the floor with too many hooked, skeletal digits. An appendage like a tail - which was not a tail - lay coiled behind it; Tassi gasped as she saw that this extraneous member, too, was equipped with a rudimentary, lidless, almost vacant eye. The thing was entirely freakish, and as for what it fed upon... Tassi gave a massive start, jumped back from the tank. The creature had snatched up more food from the floor of its glass cell - and a human arm had suddenly flopped into view, dangling from its terrible hands! As Tassi\u0027s eyes bulged in horror, so the thing commenced munching on the dismembered arm\u0027s hand and fingers. \u0027Steady, my dear,\u0027 said Khuv quietly, as the girl moaned and reeled beside him. \u0027But... but... it\u0027s eating a... a -\u0027 \u0027A man?\u0027 Khuv finished it for her. \u0027Or what\u0027s left of one? Indeed it is, yes. Oh, it will eat any sort of meat, but it appears to like human flesh the best.\u0027 And to Agursky: \u0027Vasily, do you have something for Tassi?\u0027 The strange little scientist came forward, pressed something - several somethings - into her hand. A wallet? A ring? An ID card? And however familiar these things were, for a long moment her mind wouldn\u0027t recognize them, refused to make the final, terrible connection. Then- She felt dizzy and put her free hand on the glass wall of the tank to steady herself, and her eyes went from the items in her hand to the thing where it crouched. Horrified but at the same time fascinated, she stared and stared at it. Were these men trying to tell her that... that this creature was eating her father?! Agursky had gone to one side of the room, where suddenly he switched up the lighting. Everything sprang into sharp, almost dazzling definition. The creature threw its food to one side and turned snarling toward Khuv and Tassi where they both shrank instinctively back. And that was when she fainted and would have fallen to the floor if her wrist hadn\u0027t been cuffed to the Major\u0027s, and if he hadn\u0027t turned quickly to catch up her sagging body in his arms. For the thing in the glass tank was ... oh, it was something hellish, yes, nightmarish. But the greater nightmare was this: that however monstrous and warped, however altered and alien that thing\u0027s caricature of a face was when it had snarled at her, still she\u0027d recognized it as the face of her father! Jazz Simmons\u0027s Georgian terrace bachelor flat in Hampstead was colourful, cluttered, and when Harry Keogh had first moved in a little over twenty-four hours ago it had been bitterly cold and the telephone was off. He\u0027d had E-Branch clear it for him to use the place as his base, and he\u0027d warned them not to come bothering him. He had Darcy Clarke\u0027s word that he could play the entire game his way, without interference. His way had been to attempt to absorb something of the atmosphere of the place first. Maybe he could get to know Simmons by understanding how he\u0027d lived: his tastes, likes and dislikes, and his routine. Not his work routine, his private routine. Harry didn\u0027t believe that a man was what he did professionally; he believed a man was what he thought privately. The first thing that had impressed itself upon him was the clutter. Privately, Jazz Simmons had been a very untidy man. Maybe it was his way of relaxing. When you\u0027re trained to a knife-edge you have to have a place where you can sheathe yourself now and then, or else you might cut yourself. This had been Jazz\u0027s unwinding place. The \u0027clutter\u0027 consisted of books and magazines dropped any and everywhere, more off the bookshelves than on them. Spy-thrillers (not unnaturally, Harry supposed) lay alongside piles of foreign language publications, most of the latter being Russian. There was also, beside Jazz\u0027s bed, a dusty, foot-thick stack of Pravdos - topped by a copy of the latest Playboy. Harry had had to smile: hardly the most compatible meeting of ideologies! Also in the bedroom were dust-free framed photographs of Jazz\u0027s father and mother; on the wall a life-size Marilyn Monroe poster; a cabinet standing close to the window, containing cups won in various ski events; and again affixed to the wall a battered pair of bright yellow skis and sticks which must be of some special significance. A recessed cupboard in a narrow passageway had showered Harry with an accumulation of skiing requisites, and beside Jazz\u0027s video cassette recorder were haphazardly stacked films of all the main winter athletics for the last five years. While Jazz hadn\u0027t been available to participate, still he hadn\u0027t been willing to miss out entirely. There were photographs of girls, too, quite a pile of them, in one corner of a bedroom drawer; a scrap-book contained a photographic record of Jazz\u0027s military term; perhaps significantly, a second album carefully wrapped in an old pullover consisted of faded letters to Jazz from his father. Harry had let the feel of all of these things sink in. He\u0027d slept in Jazz\u0027s bed, used his kitchen and bathroom, even his dressing-gown. He discovered several phone numbers of old girlfriends, called them and asked about Jazz, discovered them to be a mixed bunch with little in common except their obvious intelligence, and the fact that one and all they thought Jazz was \u0027a very nice guy\u0027. Harry was starting to think so, too; and where before Michael J. Simmons had been merely a means to an end - hopefully to the discovery of Harry\u0027s family - now he had become something of an issue in his own right. In short, the horizon of Harry\u0027s obsession was expanding beyond purely personal interests. At this stage, too, Harry had felt that he now must get a little closer to Simmons himself. Or if not the real man, then at least his metaphysical echo. Simmons no longer existed in this universe, but he had once existed in the past... In Harry\u0027s incorporeal days he had been able to travel into the past and \u0027immaterialize\u0027 there: he\u0027d been able to manifest a ghostly semblance of himself on the bygone event screen. Now, embodied and fully corporeal once more, this was no longer possible; it would create unthinkable paradoxes, perhaps even damage the structure of time itself. He could still travel in time, but while doing so he must never attempt to leave the metaphysical Mobius Continuum for the real world. Not that this was a necessity; to achieve his aim on this occasion, time-travel itself should suffice. And so he entered the Mobius Continuum, found a past-time door and journeyed back a little way, less than two years into the past. In doing so Harry had altered his position in time but not in space; he still \u0027occupied\u0027 Jazz Simmons\u0027s flat. And so, when as he judged it he had journeyed far enough and reversed his direction to head once more for \u0027the future\u0027, he knew beyond a reasonable doubt that the strong blue life-thread which travelled parallel to his own must be that of Simmons. For after all, he\u0027d picked it up in Simmons\u0027s flat. And following that life-thread into the future, he also knew that he was now about to prove one way or the other any similarity between Simmons\u0027s -transference? - and those of his wife and son. The proof wasn\u0027t long in coming, and temporaneously it agreed exactly with the time Darcy Clarke had specified in defining Simmons\u0027s exit point. Although he expected it, still Harry didn\u0027t see it coming, just an eyeball-searing blaze of white light; following which ... he journeyed on alone. Jazz Simmons had gone - elsewhere! The same elsewhere, presumably, as Harry Jnr and Brenda before him. Harry didn\u0027t need to go back and play it all over again; he\u0027d seen the same thing plenty of times before, and it was always the same. There was nothing new here, the only difference being that Simmons had gone in a single white instantaneous blaze, while the departure of Harry Jnr and his mother had been accompanied by twin bomb-bursts. As for what those terminal flares signified, Harry was at a complete loss. He only knew that before the white dazzle blue life-threads raced for the future, and that after it those life-threads no longer existed. Not in this universe, anyway. Which led to his next line of enquiry: Mobius himself. August Ferdinand Mobius (1790-1868), a German mathematician and astronomer, lay in his grave in a Leipzig cemetery. His dust was there, anyway, which to Harry Keogh, Necroscope, was one and the same thing. Harry had been to see Mobius before, to discover the secret of the Mobius Continuum. In life Mobius had invented it (though he personally had denied that, telling Harry that in fact he\u0027d merely \u0027noticed\u0027 it) and in death he\u0027d gone on to develop his theories into precise sciences, albeit sciences no living person would ever comprehend. None, that is, except Harry Keogh himself. And Harry\u0027s son, of course. The last time Harry was here he\u0027d come by rather more conventional means: by air to Berlin, then through Check-Point Charlie to the east - as a tourist! But mundane as his arrival had been, his exit from Leipzig had been along an entirely different route - through a Mobius door. That had been Harry\u0027s first experience of the Mobius Continuum, since when he\u0027d become an expert in his own right. But there had been far more than that to Harry\u0027s visit, and even now he might not have discovered the correct mental formulae but for the spur he\u0027d received at that time. Harry had been on the \u0027wanted\u0027 list of the Soviet E-Branch. The emerging vampire Boris Dragosani, a member of that branch, had wanted to take Harry - alive if possible - and draw from him the secret of his weird talents. Dragosani was a necromancer who ripped the private thoughts of the dead out of their ravaged bodies, who read their secrets in brain fluids and torn ligaments, in ruptured organs and eviscerated guts. It would be so much easier if he could simply talk to the dead, like Harry. They might not respect him as they did Harry, but the threat of defilement should suffice to open them up. If not... well, there was always the other way. Dragosani had issued a detention warrant, ordering the East German Grenzpolizei to pick Harry up on trumped-up charges. They had tried, and out of necessity Harry had solved the final equation of Mobius\u0027s metaphysical space-time dimension, with which he could summon \u0027doors\u0027 on the entire space-time universe. Barely in time, Harry had used one of these doors. Ironically, perhaps, it had floated into view (but only Harry\u0027s view) across the face of Mobius\u0027s headstone! From then on Harry\u0027s invasion of the Soviet E-Branch and the destruction of Dragosani had been an inexorable process, in the course of which his own body had been destroyed and abandoned as once more he escaped to the Mobius Continuum. There, as an incorporeal being, a bodiless mind and soul, eventually he had discovered and entered into the drained shell of Alec Kyle. This had been an almost involuntary event - Kyle\u0027s body, a living vacuum, had seemed to reach out and suck Harry in - but it had given him a place among men again and ended what was otherwise an interminable existence in the matterless Mobius Continuum. And now Harry was back in Leipzig, standing by Mobius\u0027s grave as before. Almost nine years had passed since last he was here, but he hadn\u0027t forgotten those events which terminated his first visit. And so on this occasion he\u0027d come by night. A moon hung low over the city\u0027s skyline, and the stars were very bright between streamers of fast-fleeing cloud. The night wind, moaning through the headstones, sent wrinkled leaves scurrying like mice, and Harry felt a chill in his bones which was born partly of the natural cold of a November night, and partly of his feeling of alienation here in this place. But the cemetery gates were closed for the night, the lights in the city subdued, and apart from the scrape of leaves all was silence. He sought Mobius out and found him, and as before the great mathematician was busy with his formulae and his calculations. Tables of planetary mass and motion, the \u0027weights\u0027 of the sun and her satellite worlds in their careening round, were balanced against orbital velocities and gravitic forces; formulae so complex that even Harry\u0027s intuitive grasp found their purpose elusive, together with simultaneous equations whose answers filled themselves in even as he watched; all of these figures and configurations beat on Harry\u0027s awareness like the ever-changing results of an on-going process on the screen of some vast computer. And Harry saw that the problem was so complex and so close to completion that he let it go on undisturbed by his presence to the end. At which time the screen went blank and Mobius sighed. It was a strange thing, even now, to hear the \u0027sigh\u0027 of a dead man. \u0027Sir?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Are you available now?\u0027 \u0027Eh?\u0027 said Mobius, in that moment before he recognized Harry\u0027s thoughts. Then: \u0027Is that you, Harry?\u0027 he continued eagerly. \u0027I thought there was someone here. You very nearly put me off just then, and I was working on something which is very important!\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027I saw it, but I didn\u0027t want to disturb you. Those are very wonderful discoveries!\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 Mobius seemed surprised. \u0027You could understand my working, then? Very well, and what have I discovered?\u0027 Harry drew back a little, hesitating. He was in the presence of genius and he knew it. Mobius had been a great mathematician all his life, and after that life he had continued his work unabated. Where Harry\u0027s mathematical skills were intuitive, Mobius had worked hard to achieve his results. No quantum leaps for him but dogged trial and error and an unwavering, all-consuming passion for his subject. It seemed somehow improper for Harry to have come here at this time, spying on the man in his triumph. \u0027Not at all,\u0027 Mobius tut-tutted him. \u0027What? - a man who can impose his physical being on the metaphysical universe, and use it at will? Spying on me? I consider you a colleague, Harry, an equal! And truth be told, you couldn\u0027t have come visiting at a more opportune time. Now come on, tell me what I\u0027ve been doing. What is it that I\u0027ve proved with my numbers, eh?\u0027 Harry shrugged. \u0027Very well,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ve shown that instead of the nine planets we believed to exist in the solar system, there are in fact eleven. Both of the new worlds are small, but true planets for all that. One occupies a position exactly behind Jupiter, with the same rotation period, so that it\u0027s always occluded, and the other\u0027s a non-reflector and lies about as far out again as Pluto from the sun.\u0027 \u0027Good!\u0027 Mobius applauded him. \u0027And their moons?\u0027 \u0027Eh?\u0027 Harry was taken by surprise. \u0027I read only the problem you\u0027d set yourself and the answers to the problem as you arrived at them! There were slight deviations -percentages of error, I suppose - but...\u0027 He paused. \u0027But? But?\u0027 Harry could almost picture Mobius raising his eyebrows. \u0027All the clues were there in the equations, Harry. No? Very well. I\u0027ll tell you: The inner world has no moon, but the \"percentage of error\", as you call it, for the outer world was just too big to be ignored. I have checked it and it indicates an almost spherical nickel-iron moon three kilometres in diameter orbiting the parent at a distance of twenty-four thousand planetary circumferences. Now that is what we call a calculation! Of course, I shall prove it by going there and seeing it for myself.\u0027 Harry shook his head in defeat, offered a wry grimace. \u0027You\u0027re too good for me,\u0027 he said. \u0027You always will be.\u0027 And after a moment: \u0027Do you want me to let this \"leak out\", as it were? I could do that easily enough, with just sufficient information to set the entire astronomical fraternity jumping! It could be done anonymously, by an \"amateur\", you understand, on the solemn promise that when the calculations are shown to be correct, then one of the two worlds should be named Mobius!\u0027 Mobius was stunned. \u0027Could you really do that, Harry?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure I could find a way.\u0027 \u0027My boy... God!\u0027 Mobius was overjoyed at the prospect. \u0027Harry, how I wish I could shake your hand!\u0027 \u0027You can do rather more than that,\u0027 Harry told him, growing serious in a moment. \u0027You remember the last time I came to see you I had a problem? Well, now I have an even bigger one.\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s have it, then,\u0027 said the other at once, and Harry told him of his quest for his wife and son. He finished by explaining: \u0027And so you see, it\u0027s no longer simply a question of my family, but I also have the British agent Michael Simmons to consider.\u0027 Mobius seemed nonplussed. \u0027And you\u0027ve come to me for help? Well, obviously you have - but for the life of me I can\u0027t see what I can do! I mean, if they\u0027re not here, these three people - if they have physically ceased to exist in this universe - then how can I or anyone else suggest where or how to find them? The universe is The Universe, Harry. Its very name defines it. It is THE ALL. If they\u0027re not in it, then they\u0027re not anywhere.\u0027 \u0027That was my line of reasoning, too.\u0027 Harry admitted, \u0027 - until recently. But you and me, why, don\u0027t we both contradict that very fact?\u0027 \u0027Eh? How\u0027s that?\u0027 \u0027The Mobius Continuum,\u0027 Harry answered, by way of explanation. \u0027You yourself admit that it\u0027s a purely metaphysical plane, not of this universe. Step into the Mobius Continuum and you step out of the three mundane dimensions. The Mobius Continuum not only transcends the three dimensions of mundane space but time also, and runs parallel to all of them! And what of a black hole?\u0027 \u0027What of it?\u0027 (Mobius\u0027s mental shrug.) \u0027Well, isn\u0027t a black hole an exit from this universe? That\u0027s how they\u0027ve always been explained to me: a focus of gravity so great that space and time themselves are drawn into the whorl. And if they are exits from the here and now, then where the hell do they lead?\u0027 To another part of the universe,\u0027 Mobius answered. That seems the only likely explanation to me. Mind you, I haven\u0027t really looked at black holes yet. I have them scheduled, though.\u0027 \u0027Are you missing the point or deliberately avoiding it?\u0027 Harry wanted to know. This is my question: if a black hole goes somewhere, emerging maybe light-years away, what of the space in between? Where is the material which is drawn into the hole, between its disappearing and its reappearing? You see, to me this all seems very much like our Mobius Continuum.\u0027 \u0027Go on,\u0027 Mobius was fascinated. \u0027OK,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027let\u0027s look at it this way. First we have the ... let\u0027s call it the mundane universe. And we\u0027ll say it looks like this:\u0027 He showed Mobius a mental diagram. \u0027Why the bends?\u0027 the mathematician was immediately curious. \u0027Because without them it would just be a pair of straight lines,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027The bends give it definition, make it look like something.\u0027 \u0027Like a ribbon?\u0027 \u0027For the purpose of the exercise, why not? For all I know it could be a circle, or maybe a sphere. But this way we can envisage a past and a future, too.\u0027 \u0027Very well,\u0027 Mobius conceded. \u0027Now in this diagram of the universe,\u0027 Harry went on, \u0027we can\u0027t go from \"A\" to \"B\" without crossing the edge. We can go up the ribbon from \"A\" to the edge, then down to \"B\". Or down to the edge and up, it makes no difference. The edge represents the distance between \"A\" and \"B\", right?\u0027 \u0027Agreed,\u0027 said the other. \u0027Now this is how I see the Mobius Continuum,\u0027 said Harry: And he continued: \u0027It\u0027s the ribbon universe we know with the half-twist of your Mobius strip. \"Now\" has turned through ninety degrees to become \"forever\". Which means that \"A\" and \"B\" are now on the same plane. We no longer have to cross the edge. We can go from one to the other instantaneously - \"now\"!\u0027 \u0027Go on,\u0027 said Mobius again, but much more thoughtfully. \u0027Previously we\u0027ve thought of it like this:\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Like... like putting on a pair of seven-league boots and striding to our destinations in seconds. Covering distances that should take hours in minutes. But I\u0027ve checked it out and it\u0027s not like that. In fact we go there instantaneously -accordingly to Earth-time, anyway. It\u0027s not simply that we go there faster, but that the space in between actually disappears!\u0027 After a little while Mobius said, \u0027I think I understand. What you want to know is this: if for us the space between \"A\" and \"B\" reduces to zero - if it disappears - \u0027 \u0027Exactly!\u0027 Harry cut in. \u0027Where does it go to?\u0027 \u0027But it\u0027s an illusion,\u0027 Mobius cried. \u0027It\u0027s still there. It\u0027s we who have disappeared - into the Mobius Continuum, as you insist upon calling it!\u0027 \u0027Now we\u0027re getting somewhere,\u0027 Harry took a deep breath. \u0027You see, the way I see it, the Mobius Continuum is no-man\u0027s-land, it\u0027s limbo, it\u0027s the middle ground between universes. \"Universes\" - plural! It has doors to the past, the future, and to every point in present time. Using it, we can go every-where and -when - or at least I can, because I still have a life-thread to follow. But the point I\u0027m trying to make is this: I believe there may be other doors which we haven\u0027t found yet. We don\u0027t have the equations for them. And I believe that one of those doors, when I find it, will - \u0027 \u0027 - Lead you to your wife and son, and to Michael J. Simmons?\u0027 \u0027Yes!\u0027 Mobius nodded (in his fashion) and gave it some thought. \u0027Other doors,\u0027 he mused. Then: \u0027Grant me this -that I know more about the Mobius dimension than you do. That I have had one hundred and twenty years to examine it more thoroughly than you could ever hope to. That I discovered it, and have used it to go places you can never go, not in your lifetime.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Oh?\u0027 Mobius raised his eyebrows again. \u0027Oh? And can you go to the centre of a star in Betelgeuse to measure its temperature? Can you visit the moons of Jupiter or sit in the middle of that planet\u0027s monumental tornado which we call the Red Spot? Can you journey to the bottom of the Marianas Trench and every other deep on Earth to calculate the mass of water in this world? No, you can\u0027t. But I can - and have! Now grant me this: that I know the Mobius Continuum better than you do!\u0027 When the point was made like that, there seemed little use in arguing it. Harry could only agree, but: \u0027I think you\u0027re going to tell me something I don\u0027t want to hear,\u0027 he said. \u0027You know I am!\u0027 Mobius told him. \u0027There are no other doors we haven\u0027t discovered, Harry. Not in the Mobius Continuum. Other universes? - which seems to me something of a contradiction in itself - I can\u0027t say. And in any case you\u0027re talking to the wrong man, for I only deal in the three-dimensional worlds we know. But of one thing I\u0027m sure: you won\u0027t find your way into any parallel world through the Mobius Continuum...\u0027 He fell silent as Harry\u0027s disappointment swelled like a physical thing, until it hung heavy over Mobius\u0027s grave like a blanket of fog. \u0027Sir,\u0027 Harry finally said, \u0027I thank you for your time; I\u0027ve already wasted far too much of it.\u0027 \u0027Not at all,\u0027 Mobius answered. \u0027Time is only important to the living. I have more than enough of time! I just wish I was able to help.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve helped,\u0027 Harry was grateful, \u0027if only to settle a point I\u0027ve argued with myself time and time again. You see, I know Harry Jnr and his mother are alive, and I know that he can use the Mobius Continuum maybe even better than we can. He\u0027s alive but not in this universe, so he must be in some other. There\u0027s no way round that. I thought he\u0027d gone there, wherever, along the strip. You\u0027ve assured me that he hasn\u0027t. So ... there has to be some other route. I already have a clue where to start looking for it, except... from here on in my work becomes that much more dangerous, that\u0027s all. And now-\u0027 \u0027Wait!\u0027 said Mobius. \u0027I\u0027ve been considering your diagrams. Can I show you one for a change?\u0027 \u0027By all means.\u0027 \u0027Very well: here\u0027s your ribbon universe again - and a parallel universe of a similar construction:\u0027 \u0027As you can see,\u0027 Mobius continued, \u0027I\u0027ve joined them by use of - \u0027 \u0027A black hole?\u0027 Harry guessed. \u0027No, for we\u0027re talking about survivability. Nothing of solid matter and shape can enter that sort of awful maw and retain any sort of integrity. No matter what you are when you enter a black hole, you come out - if you come out - gaseous, atomic, pure energy!\u0027 \u0027Which cancels out white holes, too.\u0027 Harry was growing gloomier by the minute. \u0027But not grey ones,\u0027 said Mobius. \u0027Grey holes?\u0027 Harry frowned. \u0027... Yes, I see it now,\u0027 Mobius mused, almost to himself. \u0027Grey holes, without the disruptive gravity of black holes, and lacking the awesome radiation of white ones. Gateways pure and simple, between universes. Entropy radiators, perhaps? Inescapable once entered into, there would have to be more than one - if a traveller intended to make the return journey, anyway...\u0027 Harry waited, and in a little while weird equations began flickering once more on that amazing computer screen which Mobius called his mind. They came faster and faster, calculi in endless streams, which left Harry dizzy as he tried to grasp their meaning. For seconds merging into minutes the mental display continued - only to be shut off, suddenly, leaving the screen blank. And in a little while longer: \u0027It is ... possible,\u0027 said Mobius. \u0027It could occur in nature, and might even be duplicated by man. Except of course that men would have no use for it. It would be a by-product of some other experimentation, an accident.\u0027 \u0027But if I knew how - if I could translate your math into engineering - you\u0027re saying I could manufacture this, well, gateway?\u0027 Harry was clutching at straws. \u0027You? Hardly!\u0027 Mobius chuckled. \u0027But a team of scientists, with enormous resources and a limitless energy supply - yes!\u0027 Harry thought of the experiments at Perchorsk, and his excitement was now obvious. \u0027That\u0027s the confirmation I needed,\u0027 he said. \u0027And now I have to be on my way.\u0027 \u0027It was good to talk to you again,\u0027 Mobius told him. \u0027Take care, Harry.\u0027 \u0027I will,\u0027 Harry promised. And hugging his overcoat close to him (or if not \"his\" overcoat, one which he\u0027d borrowed from Jazz Simmons\u0027s wardrobe) Harry conjured a Mobius door and took his departure. Leaves blew skitteringly between the graves and along the pathways. One such leaf, taken by surprise as it leaned against Harry\u0027s shoe, suddenly went tumbling across the empty flags where a moment ago he\u0027d been standing. But now, under the high-flying moon and cold, glittering stars, the Leipzig graveyard was quite, quite empty... Some three days prior to (and an entire dimension away from) Harry\u0027s visit to Mobius: Jazz Simmons journeyed west with Zek, Lardis and his Travellers, journeyed in the golden glow of the slowly setting sun. He\u0027d been pleased to be relieved of his kit, all except his gun and two full magazines, and knew that even though he was dog-tired he could now hold out until the Travellers made camp. By this time, too, he\u0027d had the opportunity to get a good close look at Zek in the extended evening light of Sunside, and he hadn\u0027t been disappointed. She had somehow found the time to snatch a wash in a fast-flowing stream, which had served to greatly enhance her fresh, natural beauty. Now she looked good enough to eat, and Jazz felt hungry enough, too, except that would be one hell of a waste. Zek had wrapped her sore feet in soft rags and now walked on grass and loamy earth instead of stone, and for all that she too was tired her step seemed lighter and most of the worry lines had lifted from her face. While she\u0027d cleaned herself up, Jazz had used the time to study, the Travellers. His original opinion seemed confirmed: they were Gypsies, Romany, and speaking in an antique \u0027Romance\u0027 tongue, too. It was hard not to deduce connections with the world he had left behind; maybe Zek would be able to explain some of the similarities. He determined to ask her some time, yet another question to add to a lengthening list. He was surprised how quickly he\u0027d come to rely on her. And he was annoyed to find himself thinking about her when he should be concentrating on his education. Many of the male Travellers wore rings in the lobes of their left ears, gold by the look of it, to match the bands on their fingers. No lack of that precious metal here, apparently; it decorated in yellow bands the hauling poles of their travois, studded their leather jackets and stitched the seams of their coarse-weave trousers, was even used to stud the leather soles of their sandals! But silver was far less in evidence. Jazz had seen arrows and the bolts of crossbows tipped with it, but never a sign of the stuff used for decoration. In this world, he would in time discover, it was far more precious than gold. Not least for its effect on vampires. But the Travellers puzzled Jazz. He found strange, basic anomalies in them beyond his understanding. For example: it seemed to him that in many ways their world was very nearly primal, and yet the Travellers themselves were anything but primitive. Though he\u0027d not yet seen an actual Gypsy caravan here, he knew that they existed; he\u0027d observed a small boy of four or five years, sitting on a loaded, jouncing travois, playing with a rough wooden model. Between its shafts a pair of creatures like overgrown, shaggy sheep, also carved of wood, strained in their tiny harnesses of leather. So they had the wheel, these people, and beasts of burden; even though none were in evidence here. They could work metals, and with their use of the crossbow their weaponry could hardly be considered crude. Indeed, in almost every respect it was seen that theirs was a sophisticated culture. But on the other hand it was hard to see how, in this environment, they\u0027d achieved any degree of culture at all! As for the \u0027tribe\u0027 Jazz had expected to see, so far there were no more than sixty Travellers in all: Arlek\u0027s party (now fully accepted back into the common body) and Lardis\u0027s companions, plus a handful of family groups which had been waiting in a stand of trees to join up with Lardis at the Sunside exit from the pass and head west with him through the foothills. And all of these people going on foot, with the exception of one old woman who lay in a pile of furs upon a travois, and two or three young children who travelled in a similar fashion. Jazz had studied their faces, taking note of the way they\u0027d every so often turn their heads and stare suspiciously at the sun floating over the southern horizon. Zek had told Jazz that true night was a good forty-five hours away; but still there was an unspoken anxiety, a straining, in the faces of the Travellers, and Jazz believed he knew why. It was that they silently willed themselves westward, desiring only to put distance between themselves and the pass before sundown. And because they knew this world, while Jazz was a newcomer, he found himself growing anxious along with them, and adding his will to theirs. Keeping his fear to himself, he\u0027d asked Zek: \u0027Where is everyone? I mean, don\u0027t tell me this is the entire tribe!\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 she\u0027d told him, shaking her damp hair about her shoulders, \u0027only a fraction of it. Traveller tribes don\u0027t go about en masse. It\u0027s what Lardis calls \"survival\". There are two more large encampments up ahead. One about forty miles from here, the other twenty-five miles beyond that at the first sanctuary. The sanctuary is a cavern system in a huge outcrop of rock. The entire tribe can disappear inside it, spread out, make themselves thin on the ground. Hard for the Wamphyri to winkle them out. That\u0027s where we\u0027re heading. We hole up there for the long night.\u0027 \u0027Seventy miles?\u0027 he frowned at her. \u0027Before dark?\u0027 He glanced at the sun again, so low in the sky. \u0027You\u0027re joking!\u0027 \u0027Sundown is still a long way off,\u0027 she reminded him yet again. \u0027You can stare at the sun till you go blind, but you won\u0027t see it dip much. It\u0027s a slow process.\u0027 \u0027Well, thank goodness for that,\u0027 he said, nodding his relief. \u0027Lardis intends to cover fifteen miles between breaks,\u0027 she went on, \u0027but he\u0027s tired, too, probably more than we are. The first break will be soon, for he knows we all need to get some sleep. The wolves will keep watch. The break will be of three hours\u0027 duration - no more than that. So for every six hours\u0027 travel we get a three-hour break. Nine hours to cover fifteen miles. It sounds easy but in fact it\u0027s back-breaking. They\u0027re used to it but it will probably cripple you. Until you\u0027re into the swing of it, anyway.\u0027 Even as she finished speaking Lardis called a halt. He was up front but his bull voice carried back to them: \u0027Eat, drink,\u0027 he advised, \u0027then sleep.\u0027 The Travellers trudged to a halt, Zek and Jazz with them. She unrolled her sleeping-bag, told Jazz: \u0027Get yourself a blanket of furs from one of the travois. They carry spares. Someone will come round with bread, water, a little meat.\u0027 Then she flattened a patch of bracken, shook out her bed on top of it and climbed in. She pulled the zipper half-way shut from bottom to top. Jazz lit her a cigarette and went to find himself a blanket. When he too lay down close by, food had already been brought for them. While they ate he admitted: \u0027I\u0027m excited as a kid! I\u0027ll never get to sleep. My brain\u0027s far too active. There\u0027s so much to take in.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll sleep,\u0027 she answered. \u0027Maybe you should tell me a story,\u0027 he said, lying back. \u0027Your story?\u0027 The story of my life?\u0027 she gave him a wan smile. \u0027No, just the bit you\u0027ve lived since you came here. Not very romantic, I know, but the more I learn about this place the better. As Lardis might say, it\u0027s a matter of survival. Now that we know about this Dweller - who apparently has a season ticket to Berlin - survival seems so much more desirable. Or more correctly, more feasible!\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 she said, making herself more comfortable. \u0027There have been times when I\u0027ve just about given up hope, but now I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t. You want to hear my story? All right then, Jazz, this is how it was for me...\u0027 She began to talk, low, even-voiced, and as she got into the story so she fell into the dramatic, colourful style of the Travellers - and of the Wamphyri themselves, for that matter. Being a telepath, their manner and modes of expression had impressed themselves upon her that much more quickly, until now they were second nature. Jazz listened, let her words flow, conjured from them the feel and the fear of her story...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-14.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
