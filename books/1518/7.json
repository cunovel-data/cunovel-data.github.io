{"id":62497,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Mobius Trippers!\\n\\n Darcy Clarke got as far as Pill - the mysterious object shot down over the Hudson Bay, but without yet explaining its nature - when Harry stopped him. \u0027So far,\u0027 the Necroscope complained, \u0027while all of this has been very interesting, I don\u0027t see how it\u0027s got much to do with me; or with Brenda and Harry Jnr.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke said, \u0027But you will. You see, it\u0027s not the sort of thing I can just tell you part of, or only the bits you\u0027re going to be interested in. If you don\u0027t see the whole picture, then the rest of it will be doubly difficult to understand. Anyway, if you do decide you\u0027d like in on this, you\u0027ll need to know it all. I\u0027ll be coming to the things you\u0027ll find interesting later.\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027All right - but let\u0027s go through to the kitchen. Could you use a coffee? Instant, I\u0027m afraid; I\u0027ve no patience with the real thing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Coffee would be fine,\u0027 said Clarke. \u0027And don\u0027t worry about your instant. Anything has to be good after the gallons of stuff I drink out of that machine at HQ!\u0027 And following Harry through the dim corridors of the old house, he smiled. For all the Necroscope\u0027s apparently negative response, Clarke could see that in fact he was starting to unwind.\\n\\n In the kitchen Clarke waited until Harry brought the coffee to the large wooden kitchen table and seated himself, then started to take up the story again. \u0027As I was saying, they shot this thing down over the Hudson Bay. Now-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wait,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027OK, I accept that you\u0027re going to tell it your own way. That being the case, I\u0027d better know the bits round the edges, too. Like how your lot got interested in Perchorsk in the first place?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Actually, by accident,\u0027 Clarke answered. \u0027We don\u0027t automatically get called in on everything, you know. We\u0027re still very much the \"silent partner\", as it were, when it comes to the country\u0027s security. No more than half-a-dozen of Her Majesty\u0027s lads in Whitehall - and one lady, of course - know that we even exist. And that\u0027s how we prefer to keep it. As always, it makes funding difficult, not to mention the acquisition of new technology toys, but we get by. Gadgets and ghosts, that\u0027s always been the way of it. We\u0027re a meeting point - but only just - between super-science and the so-called supernatural, and that\u0027s how we\u0027re likely to stay for quite some little time.\\n\\n \u0027But since the Bodescu affair things have been relatively quiet. Our psychics get called in a lot to help the police; indeed, they\u0027re relying up on us more and more all the time. We find stolen gold, art treasures, arms caches; we even supplied a warning about that mess at Brighton, and a couple of our lads were actually on their way down there when it happened. But by and large we\u0027re still very much low-key. So we don\u0027t tell everything, and alas we don\u0027t get told everything. Even the people who do know about us have difficulty seeing how computerized probability patterns can work alongside precognition. We\u0027ve come a long way, but let\u0027s face it, telepathy isn\u0027t nearly as accurate as the telephone!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Harry\u0027s sort - with the dead - was one hundred per cent accurate.\\n\\n \u0027Not if the other side knows you\u0027re listening in, no.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it is more secret,\u0027 Harry pointed out, and Clarke sensed the acid in his tone. \u0027So how did you \"accidentally\" learn about Perchorsk?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We got to know about it because our \"Comrades\" at Perchorsk didn\u0027t want us to! I\u0027ll explain: do you remember Ken Layard?\u0027\\n\\n The locator? Of course I remember him,\u0027 Harry answered.\\n\\n \u0027Well, it was as simple as that. Ken was checking up on a bit of Russian military activity in the Urals - covert troop movements and what-not - and he met with resistance. There were opposed minds there, Soviet espers who were deliberately smothering the place in mental smog!\u0027\\n\\n Now a degree of animation showed in Harry\u0027s pale face, especially in his eyes, which seemed to brighten appreciably. So his old friends the Russian espers had regrouped, had they? He nodded grimly. \u0027Soviet E-Branch is back in business, eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Obviously,\u0027 said Clarke. \u0027Oh, we\u0027ve known about them for some time. But after what you did to the Chateau Bronnitsy they\u0027ve not been taking any chances. They\u0027ve been even more low-key than we are! They have two centres now: one in Moscow, right next door to the biological research laboratories on Protze Prospekt, and the other in Mogocha near the Chinese border, mainly keeping a wary eye on the Yellow Peril.\u0027 \"And this lot at Perchorsk,\u0027 Harry reminded him. \u0027A small section,\u0027 Clarke nodded, \u0027established there purely to keep us out! As far as we can tell, anyway. But what on earth can the Soviets be doing there that rates so high on their security list, eh? After Pill, we decided we\u0027d better find out.\\n\\n The MI branches owed us favours; we learned that they were trying to put one of their agents - a man called Michael J. Simmons - in there; and so we, well, we sort of hitched a lift.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You got to him?\u0027 Harry raised an eyebrow. \u0027How?\\n\\n And more to the point, since he\u0027s one of ours anyway, why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Quite simply because we didn\u0027t want him to know!\u0027 Clarke seemed surprised that Harry hadn\u0027t fathomed it for himself. \u0027What, with Soviet espers crawling all over the place, we should openly establish a telepathic link with him or something? No, we couldn\u0027t do that, for their psychics would be onto him in a flash - so we sort of bugged him instead. And since he was in the dark about it, we decided not to tell his bosses at MIS either! Let\u0027s face it, you can\u0027t talk about what you don\u0027t know about, now can you?\u0027\\n\\n Harry gave a snort. \u0027No, of course not!\u0027 he said. \u0027And after all, why should the left hand tell the right one what it\u0027s doing, eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They wouldn\u0027t have believed us, anyway,\u0027 Clarke shrugged off the other\u0027s sarcasm. They only understand one sort of bugging. They couldn\u0027t possibly have understood ours. We borrowed something belonging to Simmons for a little while, that\u0027s all, and gave it to one of our new lads, David Chung, to work on.\u0027 \u0027A Chinaman?\u0027 Again the raised eyebrow. \u0027Chinese, yes, but a Cockney, actually,\u0027 Clarke chuckled. \u0027Born and raised in London. He\u0027s a locator and scryer, and damned good at it. So we took a cross Simmons wears and gave it to Chung. Simmons thought he\u0027d mislaid it, and we arranged for him to find it again. Meanwhile David Chung had developed a \"sympathetic link\" with the cross, so that he would \"know\" where it was at any given time and even be able to see or scry through it, like using a crystal ball. It worked, too - for a while, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 Harry\u0027s interest was waning again. He never had thought much of espionage, and had considered ESP-ionage the lowest of all its many forms. Yet another reason why he\u0027d left E-Branch. Deep down inside he thought of espers who used their talents that way as psychic voyeurs. On the other hand he knew it was better that they worked for the common good than against it. As for his own talent: that was different. The dead didn\u0027t consider him a peeping Tom but a friend, and they respected him as such.\\n\\n \u0027The other thing we did,\u0027 Clarke continued, \u0027was this: we convinced Simmons\u0027s bosses that he shouldn\u0027t have a D-cap.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A what?\u0027 Harry wrinkled his nose. That sounds like some sort of family planning tackle to me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah, sorry!\u0027 said Clarke. \u0027You weren\u0027t with us long enough to learn about that sort of thing, were you? A D-capsuIe is a quick way out of trouble. A man can find himself in a situation where it\u0027s a lot better to be dead. When he\u0027s suffering under torture, for instance, or when he knows that one wrong answer (or right answer) will compromise a lot of good friends. Simmons\u0027s mission was that kind of job. We have our sleepers in Redland, as you know. Just as they have theirs over here; your stepfather was one of them. Well, Simmons would be working through a group of sleepers who\u0027d been activated; if he was caught... maybe he wouldn\u0027t want to jeopardize them. The initiative to use his death capsule would be Simmons\u0027s own, of course. The capsule goes inside a tooth; all a man has to do is bite down hard on it and...\u0027\\n\\n Harry pulled a face. \u0027As if there aren\u0027t enough of the dead already!\u0027\\n\\n Clarke felt he was losing Harry, that he was driving him further from the fold. He speeded up:\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, we convinced his bosses that they should give him a fake D-cap, a capsule containing complex but harmless chemicals, knock-out drops at the worst.\u0027\\n\\n Harry frowned. \u0027Then why give him one at all?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Incentive,\u0027 said Clarke. \u0027He wouldn\u0027t know it was a fake. It would be there as a reminder to watch his step!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027God, the minds of you people!\u0027 Harry felt genuine disgust.\\n\\n And Clarke actually agreed. He nodded glumly. \u0027You haven\u0027t heard the worst of it. We told them that our prognosticators had given him a high success rating: he was going to come back with the goods. Except...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 Harry narrowed his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Well, the fact is we\u0027d given him no chance at all; we knew he was going to be picked up!\u0027\\n\\n Harry jumped up, slammed his fist down on the table so hard that he made it jump. \u0027In that case it was criminal even to let them send him!\u0027 he shouted. \u0027He\u0027d get picked up, spill the beans under pressure, drop the people who\u0027d helped him right in it - to say nothing of himself! What the hell\u0027s been happening in E-Branch over the last eight years? I\u0027m damned sure Sir Keenan Gormley wouldn\u0027t have stood for any of this in his day!\u0027\\n\\n Clarke was dead white in the face. The corner of his mouth twitched but he remained seated. \u0027Oh, yes he would have, Harry. This time he really would have.\u0027 Clarke made an effort to relax, said: \u0027Anyway, it isn\u0027t as black as I\u0027ve painted it. See, Chung is so good that he\u0027d know the minute Simmons was taken. He did know, and as soon as he said so we passed it on. As far as we\u0027re aware MIS has alerted all Simmons\u0027s contacts over there and they\u0027ve taken action to cover their tracks or even get the hell out of it.\u0027\\n\\n Harry sat down again, but he was still coldly furious. \u0027I\u0027ve just about had it with this,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can see now that you\u0027ve got yourself in a hole and you\u0027ve come to ask me to dig you out. Well, if that\u0027s the case, then the rest of what you have to tell me had better be good because...frankly, this whole mess pisses me off! OK, let\u0027s recap. Even knowing Simmons would get picked up, you fixed him up with a dummy D-cap and let him get himself sent on an impossible mission. Also - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wait,\u0027 said Clarke. \u0027You still haven\u0027t got it right. As far as we were concerned, that was his mission: to get picked up! We knew he was going to be anyway.\u0027 His expression was as cold as Harry\u0027s but without the other\u0027s fury.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t see this improving,\u0027 said Harry in a little while. \u0027In fact it gets worse and worse! And all of this to get a man inside the Perchorsk Projekt, so that your scryer Chung could spy through him. But... didn\u0027t it dawn on you that the Soviet espers would pick Chung up, too? His ESP?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eventually they would, yes,\u0027 Clarke nodded. \u0027Even though Chung would use his talent in the shortest possible bursts, they\u0027d crack him eventually - and in fact we believe they have. Except we\u0027d hoped that by that time we\u0027d know exactly what was going on in there. We\u0027d have proof, one way or the other, about what the Soviets were making - or breeding - down there!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Breeding - ?\u0027 Harry\u0027s mouth slowly formed an \u0027O\u0027. And now his tone was very much quieter. \u0027What the hell are you trying to tell me, Darcy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The thing they shot down over the Hudson Bay,\u0027 Clarke said, very slowly and very clearly, \u0027was one hellish thing, Harry. Can\u0027t you guess?\u0027\\n\\n Harry felt his scalp tingling again. \u0027You\u0027d better tell me,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Clarke nodded and stood up. He put his knuckles on the table-top and leaned forward. \u0027You remember that thing Yulian Bodescu grew and kept in his cellar? Well, that\u0027s what it was, Harry, but big enough to make Bodescu\u0027s creature look tiny by comparison! And now you know why we need you. You see, it was the biggest, bloodiest vampire anybody could possibly imagine - and it came out of Perchorsk!\u0027\\n\\n After a long, long moment Harry Keogh said: \u0027If this were someone\u0027s idea of a joke, it would be just too gross to-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No joke, Harry,\u0027 Clarke cut in. \u0027Down at HQ we have film of the thing, shot from an AWACS before the fighters got it and burned it out of the sky. If it wasn\u0027t a vampire - or at least made of the stuff of vampires - then I\u0027m in the wrong business. But our people who survived that raid on Bodescu\u0027s place, Harkley House in Devon, they\u0027re a lot more qualified than I am; and they all say that it was exactly like that, which to my mind means there\u0027s only one thing it could possibly be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think the Russians may be experimenting, making them - designing them - as weapons?\u0027 It was plain that the Necroscope found it incredible.\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t that lunatic Gerenko have exactly that in mind before you... dealt with him?\u0027 Clarke was persistent.\\n\\n Harry shook his head. \u0027I didn\u0027t kill Gerenko,\u0027 he said. \u0027Faethor Ferenczy did it for me.\u0027 He fingered his chin, glanced again at Clarke, and said, \u0027But you\u0027ve made your point.\u0027\\n\\n Harry put his head down, clasped his hands behind him, walked slowly back through the brooding house to his study. Clarke followed him, trying to contain himself and not show his impatience. But time was wasting and he desperately needed Keogh\u0027s help.\\n\\n It was mid-afternoon and streamers of late autumn sunlight were filtering in through the windows, highlighting the thin layer of dust that lay everywhere. Harry seemed to notice it for the first time; he trailed his finger along a dusty shelf, then paused to consider the accumulation of dark, gritty fluff on his fingertip. Finally he turned to Clarke and said: \u0027So really, there was no \"parallel case\" after all. That was just to make sure I\u0027d listen to you, hear you out?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke shook his head. \u0027Harry, if there\u0027s one person in the world I would never lie to, you\u0027re it! Because I know you hate it, and because we need you. There\u0027s a parallel case, right enough. You see, I remembered how you put it that time eight years ago when your wife and child disappeared - before you quit E-Branch. You said: \"They\u0027re not dead, and yet they\u0027re not here - so where are they?\" I remembered it because it seems the same thing has happened again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Someone has disappeared? In the same way?\u0027 Harry frowned, made a stab at it: \u0027Simmons, do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jazz Simmons has disappeared, yes, in the same way,\u0027 Clarke answered. \u0027They caught him something less than a month ago and he was taken into Perchorsk. After that contact was difficult, very nearly impossible. David Chung reckoned it was (a) because the complex is at the foot of a ravine; the sheer bulk of matter blocks the psychic view; (b) because it\u0027s protected by a dense lead shield, which has the same effect; and (c) mainly because there are Soviet espers mind-blocking the place. Even so, Chung was able to get through on occasion. What he has seen or \"scried\" in there isn\u0027t reassuring.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go on,\u0027 said Harry, his interest waxing again.\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 Clarke continued, and immediately paused and sighed. \u0027This isn\u0027t easy, Harry. I mean, even Chung found it difficult to explain, and I\u0027m only repeating him. But... he\u0027s seen something in a glass tank. He says he can\u0027t describe it better than that because it never seems to be the same. No, don\u0027t ask me,\u0027 he quickly held up his hands, shook his head. \u0027Personally I haven\u0027t the foggiest idea. Or if I have an idea then I don\u0027t much care to voice it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go ahead,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Voice it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t have to,\u0027 Clarke shook his head. \u0027I\u0027m sure you know what I mean...\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027OK. Is there anything else?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Only this: Chung says he sensed fear, that the complex was full of dread, living in terror. Everyone in the place was desperately afraid of something, he said. But again, we don\u0027t know what. So that was how things stood until just three days ago. Then - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then no more contact. And not just Soviet \"static\" either - literally no contact! Simmons\u0027s cross, and presumably Simmons himself, were - well, no longer there. No longer anywhere, in fact.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dead?\u0027 Harry\u0027s face was grim.\\n\\n But Clarke shook his head. \u0027No,\u0027 he said, \u0027and that\u0027s what I meant when I called it a parallel case. It\u0027s so like your wife and child. Chung himself can\u0027t explain it. He says he knows the cross still exists - that it hasn\u0027t been broken up or melted down or in any other way destroyed - and he believes that Simmons still has it. But he doesn\u0027t know where it is. It defies his talent to find it. And he\u0027s angry about it, and frustrated. In fact his feelings are probably a lot like yours: he\u0027s come up against something he doesn\u0027t understand and can\u0027t figure out, and he\u0027s blaming himself. He even started to lose faith in his scrying, but we\u0027ve tested that and it\u0027s OK.\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded and said, \u0027I can understand the way he must feel. That\u0027s exactly what it\u0027s like. He knows that the cross is still extant, and Simmons still alive, but he doesn\u0027t know where they are.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 Clarke nodded. But he does know where the cross isn\u0027t. It isn\u0027t on this earth! Not according to David Chung, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n Lines of concentration etched themselves in Harry\u0027s brow. He turned his back on Clarke and stared out of a window. \u0027Of course,\u0027 he said, \u0027I can very quickly discover if Simmons is dead or not. Quite simply, I can check with the dead. If an Englishman called Michael \"Jazz\" Simmons has died recently in the upper Urals, they\u0027ll be able to tell me in ... why, in no time at all! It\u0027s not that I doubt your man Chung is good - not if you say he is - but I\u0027d like to be sure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So go ahead, ask them,\u0027 Clarke answered. But he couldn\u0027t suppress a shiver at the matter-of-fact way the Necroscope talked about it.\\n\\n Harry turned to face his visitor and smiled a strange, wan smile. His brown eyes had turned dark and very bright, but even as Clarke looked at them their colour seemed to lighten. \u0027I just did ask them,\u0027 he said. They\u0027ll let me know as soon as they have the answer...\u0027\\n\\n That answer wasn\u0027t long in coming: maybe half an hour, during which time Harry sat deep in his own thoughts (and who else\u0027s thoughts? Clarke wondered) while the man from E-Branch paced the floor of the study to and fro. The sun\u0027s light began to fade, and an old clock ticked dustily in a corner. Then -\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s not with the dead!\u0027 Harry breathed the words like a sigh.\\n\\n Clarke said nothing. He held his breath and strained his ears to hear the dead speaking to Harry - and dreaded to hear them - but there was nothing. Nothing to hear or see or feel, but Clarke knew that Harry Keogh had indeed received his message from beyond the grave. Clarke waited.\\n\\n Harry got up from behind his desk, came and stood close. \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, \u0027it looks like I\u0027m recruited - again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Again?\u0027 Clarke spoke to cover the feeling of relief he felt must be emanating from his every pore in tangible streams.\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027Last time it was Sir Keenan Gormley who came to get me. And this time it\u0027s you. Maybe you should take warning from that.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke knew what he meant. Gormley had been eviscerated by Boris Dragosani, the Soviet necromancer. Dragosani had gutted him to steal his secrets. \u0027No,\u0027 Clarke shook his head, \u0027that doesn\u0027t really apply. Not to me. My talent\u0027s a coward called Serf-Preservation: first sign of anything nasty, and whether I want to or not my legs turn me about-face and run me the hell out of there! Anyway, I\u0027ll take my chances.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will you?\u0027 The question meant something.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s on your mind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I left stuff of mine at E-Branch,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027Clothes, shaving kit, various bits and pieces. Are they still there?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke nodded. \u0027Your room hasn\u0027t been touched except to clean it. We always hoped you\u0027d come back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then I won\u0027t need to bring anything from here with me. I\u0027m ready when you are.\u0027 He closed the door to the patio.\\n\\n Clarke stood up. \u0027I\u0027ve two rail tickets here, Edinburgh to London. I came from the station by taxi, so we\u0027ll need to call a - \u0027 And he paused. Harry wasn\u0027t moving, and his smile was a little crooked, even devious. Clarke said: \u0027Er - is there something?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said you\u0027d take your chances,\u0027 Harry reminded him.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but... what sort of chances are we talking about here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s been a long time,\u0027 Harry told him, \u0027since I went anywhere by car or boat or train, Darcy. That way wastes a lot of time. The shortest distance between two points is an equation - a Mobius equation!\u0027\\n\\n Clarke\u0027s eyes went wide and his gasp was quite audible. \u0027Now wait a minute, Harry, I - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027You came here knowing that when you\u0027d told me your story I wouldn\u0027t be able to refuse,\u0027 Harry cut him off. \u0027No risk to you or to E-Branch; your talent takes care of you and the Branch looks after its own, but plenty of trouble for Harry Keogh. Where I\u0027m going - wherever I\u0027m going - I\u0027m sure there\u0027ll be times I wish I hadn\u0027t listened to you. So you see, I really am taking my chances, I\u0027m trusting you, trusting to luck, and to my talents. So how about you? Where\u0027s your faith, Darcy?\u0027 \u0027You want to take me to London... your way?\u0027 \u0027Along the Mobius strip, yes. Through the Mobius Continuum.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s perverse, Harry,\u0027 Clarke grimaced. He still wasn\u0027t convinced that the other meant it. The thought of the Mobius Continuum fascinated him, but it frightened him, too. \u0027It\u0027s like forcing a scared kid to take a ride on a figure-of-eight. Like bribing him to do it, with an offer he can\u0027t refuse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s worse than that,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027The kid has vertigo.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I don\u0027t have - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - But you will!\u0027 Harry promised.\\n\\n Clarke blinked his eyes rapidly. \u0027Is it safe? I mean, I don\u0027t know anything about this thing you do.\u0027\\n\\n Harry shrugged. \u0027But if it isn\u0027t safe, your talent will intervene, won\u0027t it? You know, for a man who\u0027s protected as you are, you don\u0027t seem to have much faith in yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s my paradox,\u0027 Clarke admitted. \u0027It\u0027s true - I still switch off all the power before I\u0027ll even change a light-bulb! OK, you win. How do we go about it? And... are you sure you know the way there? To HQ, I mean?\u0027 Clarke was starting to panic. \u0027And how do you know you can still do it, anyway? See, I - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s like riding a bike,\u0027 Harry grinned (a natural grin, Clarke was relieved to note). \u0027Or swimming. Once you can do it, you can always do it. The only difference is that it\u0027s almost impossible to teach. I had the best teacher in the world - Mobius himself - and it still took me, oh, a long time. So I won\u0027t even try to explain. Mobius doors are everywhere, but they need fixing for a second before they can be used. I know the equations that fix them. Then ... I could push you through one!\u0027\\n\\n Clarke backed away - but it was purely an instinctive reaction. It wasn\u0027t his talent working for him.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s dance,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Clarke looked this way and that, as if he searched for an escape route.\\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 Harry told him, \u0027take my hand. That\u0027s right. Now put your arm round my waist. See, it\u0027s easy.\u0027\\n\\n They began to waltz, Clarke taking mincing steps in the small study, Harry letting him lead and conjuring flickering Mobius symbols on the screen of his mind. \u0027One, two-three - one, two-three - \u0027 He conjured a door, said: \u0027Do you come here often?\u0027 It was the closest Harry had come to humour for a long time. Clarke thought it would be a good idea to respond in the same vein:\\n\\n \u0027Only in the mating -\u0027 he breathlessly began to answer.\\n\\n And Harry waltzed the pair of them through the otherwise invisible Mobius door.\\n\\n \u0027 - S-season!\u0027 Clarke husked. And: \u0027Oh, Jesus!\u0027\\n\\n Beyond the metaphysical Mobius door lay darkness: the Primal Darkness itself, which existed before the universe began. It was a place of absolute negativity, not even a parallel plane of existence, because nothing existed here. Not under normal conditions, anyway. If there was ever a place where darkness lay upon the face of the deep, this was it. It could well be the place from which God commanded Let There Be Light, causing the physical universe to split off from this metaphysical void. For indeed the Mobius Continuum was without form, and void.\\n\\n To say that Clarke was \u0027staggered\u0027 would be to severely understate his emotion; indeed, the way he felt was almost a new emotion, designed to fit a new experience. Even Harry Keogh had not felt like this when he first entered the Mobius Continuum; for he had understood it instinctively, had imagined and conjured it, whereas Clarke had been thrust into it.\\n\\n There was no air, but neither was there any time, so that Clarke didn\u0027t need to breathe. And because there was no time, there was likewise no space; there was an absence of both of these essential ingredients of any universe of matter, but Clarke did not rupture and fly apart, because there was simply nowhere to fly to.\\n\\n He might have screamed, would have, except he held Harry Keogh\u0027s hand, which was his single anchor on Sanity and Being and Humanity. He couldn\u0027t see Harry for there was no light, but he could feel the pressure of his hand; and for the moment that was all he could feel in this awesome no-every-place.\\n\\n And yet, perhaps because he had a weird psychic talent of his own, Clarke was not without an understanding of the place. He knew it was real because Harry made use of it, and also because he was here; and he knew that on this occasion at least he need not fear it, for his talent had not prevented him being here. And so, even in the confusion of his near-panic, he was able to explore his feelings about it, at least able to conjecture upon it.\\n\\n Lacking space it was literally nowhere; but by the same token lacking time it was every-where and -when. It was both core and boundary, the interior and the exterior. From here one might go anywhere, if one knew the route - or go nowhere forever, which would be Clarke\u0027s fate if Harry Keogh deserted him. And to be lost here would mean lost forever; for in this timeless, spaceless non-environment nothing ever aged or changed except by force of will; and there was no will here, unless it were brought here by someone who strayed into this place, or someone who came here and knew how to manipulate it - someone like Harry Keogh. Harry was only a man, and yet the things he could achieve through the Mobius Continuum were amazing! And if a superman - or god -should come here?\\n\\n Again Clarke thought of The God, who had wrought a Great Change out of a formless void and willed a universe. And the thought also occurred to Clarke: Harry, we shouldn\u0027t be here. This isn\u0027t our place... His unspoken words dinned like gongs in his brain, deafeningly loud! And apparently in Harry\u0027s, too.\\n\\n Take it easy, said the Necroscope. No need to shout here.\\n\\n Of course not, for in the total absence of everything else, even thoughts had extraordinary mass. We\u0027re not meant to be here, Clarke insisted. And Harry, I\u0027m scared witless! For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t let go of me!\\n\\n Of course not, came the answer. And no need to feel afraid. Harry\u0027s mental voice was calm. But I can feel and 1 understand what it\u0027s like for you. Still, can\u0027t you also feel the magic of it? Doesn\u0027t it thrill you to your soul?\\n\\n And as his panic began to subside, Clarke had to admit that it did. Slowly the tension went out of him and he began a gradual relaxation; in another moment he believed he could sense matterless forces working on him. 1 feel... a pull, like the wash of a tide, he said.\\n\\n Not a pull, a push, Harry corrected him. The Mobius Continuum doesn\u0027t want us. We\u0027re like motes in its immaterial eyes. It would expel us if it could, but we won\u0027t be here that long. If we stayed still for long enough, it would try to eject us - or maybe ingest us! There are a million million doors it could push us through; any one of them could be fatal to us, I fear, in one way or another. Or we could simply be subsumed, made to conform - which in this place means eradicated! I discovered long ago that you either master the Mobius Continuum, or it masters you! But of course that would mean us standing still for an awfully long time -forever, by mundane terms.\\n\\n Harry\u0027s statement didn\u0027t improve Clarke\u0027s anxiety. How long are we staying here! he wanted to know. Hell, how long have we been here?\\n\\n A minute or a mile, Harry answered, to both of your questions! A light-year or a second. Listen, I\u0027m sorry, we won\u0027t be here long. But to me, when I\u0027m here, questions like that don\u0027t have much meaning. This is a different continuum; the old constants don\u0027t apply. This place is the DNA of space and time, the building-blocks of physical reality. But... it\u0027s difficult stuff, Darcy. I\u0027ve had lots of \u0027time\u0027 to think about it, and even I don\u0027t have all the answers. All of them? Hah! I have only a handful! But the things I can do here, I do them well. And now I want to show you something.\\n\\n Wait! said Clarke. It\u0027s just dawned on me: what we\u0027re doing here is telepathy. So this is how it feels for the telepaths back at HQ!\\n\\n Not exactly, Harry answered. Even the best of them aren\u0027t as good as this. In the Mobius Continuum, he explained, thoughts have matter, weight. That\u0027s because they are in fact physical things in an immaterial place. Consider a tiny meteorite in space - which can punch a hole through the skin of a space-probe! There\u0027s something of a similarity. Issue a thought here and it goes on forever, just as light and matter go on forever in our universe. A star is born, and we see it blink into life billions of years later, because that\u0027s how long it took its light to reach us.\\n\\n That\u0027s what thought is like here: long after we\u0027re gone, our thoughts will still exist here. But you\u0027re right to a degree -about telepathy, I mean. Perhaps telepaths have a way of tapping in - a mental system which they themselves don\u0027t understand - to the Mobius Continuum! And Harry chuckled. There\u0027s \u0027a thought\u0027 for you! But if that\u0027s the case, how about seers, eh? What about your prognosticators? Clarke didn\u0027t immediately grasp his meaning. I\u0027m sorry\\n\\n Well, if the telepaths are using the Mobius Continuum, however unconsciously, what of the forecasters? Are they also \u0027tapping in\u0027, to scry into the future?\\n\\n Clarke was apprehensive again. Of course, he said, I\u0027d forgotten that. You can see into the future, can\u0027t you?\\n\\n Something of it, Harry answered. In fact I can go there! In my incorporeal days I could even manifest myself in past and future time, but now that I have a body again that\u0027s beyond me - so far, anyway. But I can still follow past and future time-streams, so long as I stick to the Mobius Continuum. And I can see you\u0027ve guessed it: yes, that\u0027s what I want to show you - the future, and the past.\\n\\n Harry, I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready for this. I -\\n\\n We\u0027re not actually going there, Harry calmed him. We\u0027ll just take a peek, that\u0027s all. And before Clarke could protest, he opened a door on future time.\\n\\n Clarke stood with Harry on the threshold of the future-time door and his mind was almost paralysed by the wonder and awe of it. All was a chaos of millions - no, billions - of lines of pure blue light etched against an otherwise impenetrable background eternity of black velvet. It was like some incredible meteor shower, where all of the meteors raced away from him into unimaginable deeps of space, except their trails didn\u0027t dim but remained brilliantly printed on the sky - printed, in fact, on time! And the most awesome thing was this: that one of these twining, twisting streamers of blue light issued outwards from himself, extending or extruding from him and plummeting away into the future. Beside Clarke, Harry produced another blue thread. It ribboned out of him and shot away on its own neon course into tomorrow.\\n\\n What are they? Clarke\u0027s question was a whisper in the metaphysical Mobius ether.\\n\\n Harry was also moved by the sight. The life-threads of humanity, he answered. That\u0027s all of Mankind - of which these two here, yours and mine, make up the smallest possible fraction. This one of mine used to be Alec Kyle\u0027s, but at the end it had grown very dim, almost to the point of expiring. Right now, though -\\n\\n It\u0027s one of the brightest! And suddenly Clarke found himself completely unafraid. Even when Harry said:\\n\\n Only pass through this door, and you\u0027d follow your life-thread to its conclusion. I can do it and return - indeed I have done it - but not to the very end. That\u0027s something I don\u0027t want to know about. I\u0027d like to think there isn\u0027t an end, that Man goes on forever. He closed the door, opened another. And this time he didn\u0027t have to say anything.\\n\\n It was the door to the past, to the very beginning of human life on Earth. The myriad blue life-threads were there as before; but this time, instead of expanding into the distance, they contracted and narrowed down, targeting on a far-away dazzling blue origin.\\n\\n Before Harry could close that door, too, Clarke let the scene sear itself into his memory. If from this time forward he got nothing else out of life, this adventure in the Mobius Continuum was something he wanted to remember to his dying day.\\n\\n But finally the door on the past was closed, there was sudden, swift motion, and -\\n\\n We\u0027re home! said Harry... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-7.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
