{"id":62498,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Through the Gate A fourth and final door was opened and Clarke felt himself urged through it. But the abrupt sensation of speed in motion had alarmed and shaken him, and as yet he hadn\u0027t recovered. Harry? he said, the thought trembling like a leaf in the immaterial void of the Mobius Continuum. \u0027Harry?\u0027 Except the second time it was his voice he heard, not just his thoughts. He stood with Harry Keogh in his office at E-Branch HQ, in London. Stood there for a moment, stumbled, and reeled! The real, physical world - of gravity, light, all human sensation and especially sound, most definitely sound -impressed itself forcefully on Clarke\u0027s unprepared person. It was signing-off time for most of the staff; many had already left, but the Duty Officer and a handful of others were still here. And of course the security system was in operation as always. Sleepers had started to go off all over the top-floor complex as soon as Clarke and Keogh appeared, quietly at first but gradually increasing in pitch and frequency until they would soon become unbearable. A monitor screen in the wall close to Clarke\u0027s desk stuttered into life and printed up: MR DARCY CLARKE IS NOT AVAILABLE AT PRESENT. THIS IS A SECURE AREA. PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF IN YOUR NORMAL SPEAKING VOICE, OR LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. IF YOU FAIL TO - But Clarke had already regained partial control of himself. \u0027Darcy Clarke,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m back.\u0027 And in case the machine hadn\u0027t recognized his shaky voice - not waiting for it to print up its cold mechanical threats - he staggered to his desk keyboard and punched in the current security override. The screen cleared, printed up: DO NOT FORGET TO RE-SET BEFORE YOU LEAVE, and switched itself and the alarms off. Clarke flopped into his chair - in time to give a great start as the intercom began to buzz insistently. He pressed the receive button and a breathless Duty Officer\u0027s voice said. \u0027Either there\u0027s someone in there, or this is a malfunction... ?\u0027 A second voice behind the first growled: \u0027You\u0027d better believe there\u0027s somebody in there!\u0027 One of the espers, obviously. Harry Keogh pulled a wry face and nodded. \u0027This place was no great loss,\u0027 he said. \u0027None at all!\u0027 Clarke pressed the command button and held it down. \u0027Clarke here,\u0027 he said, talking to the entire HQ. \u0027I\u0027m back - and I\u0027ve brought Harry with me. Or he\u0027s brought me! But don\u0027t all rush; I\u0027ll see the Duty Officer, please, and that\u0027ll be all for now.\u0027 Then he looked at Harry. \u0027Sorry, but you can\u0027t just - well, arrive - in a place like this without people noticing.\u0027 Harry smiled his understanding - but there was something of his strangeness in that smile, too. \u0027Before they gang up on us,\u0027 he said, \u0027tell me: how long did you say it was since Jazz Simmons disappeared? I mean, when did David Chung first notice his absence?\u0027 \u0027Three days ago in - \u0027 Clarke glanced at his watch, \u0027 - just six hours\u0027 time. Around midnight. Why do you ask?\u0027 Harry shrugged. \u0027I have to have some place to start,\u0027 he said. \u0027And what was his address here in London?\u0027 Clarke gave him the address, by which time the Duty Officer was knocking at the door. The door was locked and Clarke had the key. He got up, unsteadily crossed the room to let in a tall, gangling, nervous-looking man in a lightweight grey suit. The Duty Officer had a gun in his hand which he returned to its shoulder-holster as soon as he saw his boss standing there. \u0027Fred,\u0027 said Clarke, closing and locking the door against other curious faces where they peered along the corridor, \u0027I don\u0027t believe you\u0027ve ever met Harry Keogh? Harry, this is Fred Madison. He - \u0027 But here he noticed the look of astonishment on Madison\u0027s face. \u0027Fred?\u0027 he said; and then they both looked back into the room. Which apart from themselves was quite empty! Clarke took out a handkerchief and dabbed at his brow. And in the next moment Madison was steadying him where he suddenly slumped against the wall. Clarke looked slightly unwell. \u0027I\u0027m alright, it\u0027s OK,\u0027 he said, propping himself up. \u0027As for Harry - \u0027 he glanced again all around the office, shook his head. \u0027Darcy?\u0027 said Madison. \u0027Well, maybe you\u0027ll get to meet him some other time. He ... he never was desperately fond of this place...\u0027 Something less than four days earlier, inside the Perchorsk Projekt: Chingiz Khuv, Karl Vyotsky and the Project Director, Viktor Luchov, stood at the hospital bedside of Vasily Agursky. Agursky had been here for four days, during which time his doctors had recognized certain symptoms and had started to wean him off alcohol. More than that: already they believed they had succeeded. It had been remarkably easy, all considered; but from the moment Agursky had been freed from the responsibility of tending the thing in the tank, so his dependency on local vodka and cheap slivovitz had fallen off. He had asked for a drink only once, when he regained consciousness on the first day, since when he\u0027d not mentioned alcohol and seemed hardly the worse for the lack of it. \u0027You\u0027re feeling better then, Vasily?\u0027 Luchov sat on the edge of Agursky\u0027s bed. \u0027As well as can be expected,\u0027 the patient replied. \u0027I had been on the verge of a breakdown for some time, I think. It was the work, of course.\u0027 \u0027Work?\u0027 Vyotsky seemed unconvinced. The thing about work - any kind of work - is that it produces results. On the strength of that, it\u0027s rather difficult to see how you could be exhausted, Comrade!\u0027 His bearded face scowled down on the man in the bed. \u0027Come now, Karl,\u0027 Khuv tut-tutted. \u0027You know well enough that there are different sorts of work exerting different pressures. Would you have liked to be the keeper of that thing? I hardly think so! And Comrade Agursky\u0027s condition was not strictly exhaustion, or if it was then it was nervous exhaustion, brought on by proximity to the creature.\u0027 Luchov, who carried maximum responsibility in the Perchorsk complex and therefore wielded maximum authority, looked up at Vyotsky and frowned. Physically, Luchov would not have made half of the KGB man, but in the Projekt\u0027s pecking order he stood head and shoulders over him, even over Khuv. The contempt he felt for the bully was obvious in his tone of voice when he said to Khuv: \u0027You are absolutely correct, Major. Anyone who thinks Vasily Agursky\u0027s duties were light should try them and see. Do I see a volunteer here, perhaps? Is your man telling us he\u0027d make a better job of it?\u0027 KGB Major and Projekt Direktor looked in unison, pointedly at Vyotsky. Khuv smiled his dark, deceptive smile but Luchov\u0027s scarred face showed no emotion at all and certainly not amusement. Evidence of his annoyance was apparent, however, in the throbbing of the veins on the hairless left half of his seared skull. The quickening of his pulse was a sure sign that he disapproved of someone or something, in this case Karl Vyotsky. \u0027Well then?\u0027 said Khuv, who had been at odds recently with his underling\u0027s boorishness and bad temper. \u0027Perhaps I was wrong and you would like the job after all, Karl?\u0027 Vyotsky swallowed his pride. Khuv was just perverse enough to let it happen. \u0027I...\u0027 he said. \u0027I mean, I - \u0027 \u0027No, no!\u0027 Agursky himself saved Vyotsky from further embarrassment. He propped himself up on his pillows. \u0027It is quite out of the question that anyone else takes over my job, and ridiculous even to suggest that an unqualified person should assume such duties. This is not stated in any way to slight you personally, Comrade,\u0027 he glanced indifferently at Vyotsky, \u0027but there are qualifications and there are qualifications. Now that I\u0027ve overcome two problems - my breakdown, and my absurd... obsession, for I refuse to call it an addiction, with drink - the third will not be difficult, I promise you. Given the same amount of time as I\u0027ve already spent, that creature will give up its secrets to me, be sure. I know that so far my results have not been promising, but from now on - \u0027 \u0027Take it easy, Vasily!\u0027 Luchov put a hand on his shoulder, stemming an outburst which was quite out of character for the hitherto retiring Agursky. Obviously he was not yet fully recovered. For all his doctors\u0027 assurances that he was fit enough to be up and about again, his nerves were still on the mend. \u0027But my work is important!\u0027 Agursky protested. \u0027We have to know what lies beyond that Gate, and this creature may carry the answers. I can\u0027t find them if I\u0027m to be kept on my back in here.\u0027 \u0027Another day won\u0027t hurt,\u0027 Luchov stood up, \u0027and I\u0027ll also see to it that from now on you have an assistant. It can\u0027t be good for a man to have to deal with a creature like that on his own. Some of us - \u0027 he glanced meaningfully at Vyotsky, \u0027 - would have broken long ago, I\u0027m sure...\u0027 \u0027Another day, then,\u0027 Agursky lay down again. \u0027But then I really must get back to my work. Believe me, what lies between me and that creature has now become a very personal thing, and I won\u0027t give in until I\u0027ve beaten it.\u0027 \u0027Get your rest then,\u0027 Luchov told him, \u0027and come and see me when you\u0027re up and about. I\u0027ll look forward to that.\u0027 Agursky\u0027s visitors left the ward and at last he was on his own. Now he could stop acting. He smiled a sly and yet bitter smile - a smile composed in part of success, in that he\u0027d deceived everyone who\u0027d seen him, and partly of his terror of the unknown, and the fact that he was now on his own - which died on his face as quickly as it was born. It was replaced by a nervous anxiety which showed in his pale, trembling lips, and in the tic that jerked the flesh at the corner of his mouth. He had fooled his doctors and visitors, yes, but there was no fooling himself. His doctors had examined him thoroughly and found nothing except a little stress and maybe physical weariness - not even Vyotsky\u0027s \u0027exhaustion\u0027 - and yet Agursky knew that there was a lot more than that wrong with him. The thing in the tank had put something into him, something which had hidden itself away for now. But wheels were turning and time ticking away, and the question was: how long would it remain hidden? How long did he have to find the answer and reverse the process, whatever that process was? And if he couldn\u0027t find the answer, what would it do to him, physically, while it lived and grew in him? What would it be like when it finally surfaced? So far no one knew about it but him, and from now on he must watch himself closely, must know before anyone else knew if ... if anything strange were to happen. Because if they knew first - if they discovered that he nurtured within himself something from beyond that Gate - if they even suspected it ... Agursky began to shudder uncontrollably, gritted his teeth and clenched his fists in a spasm of absolute terror. They burned those things from the Gate, hosed them down with fire until they were little heaps of congealed glue. And would they burn him, too, if... if- What would he be like after those slowly turning inner wheels had turned full circle? That was the worst of it, not knowing... Out on the perimeter and having separated from Luchov who had gone his own way, Khuv and Vyotsky were making for their own place of duty with the Projekt\u0027s esper squad when one of the latter came panting to meet them. He was a fat and especially oily man called Paul Savinkov, who prior to Perchorsk had worked in the embassies in Moscow. An unnatural predilection for male, junior members of foreign embassy staff had made him something of a risk in that employment. His transfer to Perchorsk had been swift; he was still trying to ooze his way out of the place, primarily by doing his very best to keep Khuv happy. He was sure he could convince his KGB watchdog that there were places where his talent could be far more effectively and productively employed. His talent was telepathy, in which he was occasionally very proficient. Savinkov\u0027s fat, shiny baby-face was worried now as he bumped into Khuv and Vyotsky in the sweeping outer corridor. \u0027Ah, Comrades - the very men I seek! I was on my way to report...\u0027He paused to lean against the wall and catch his breath. \u0027What is it, Paul?\u0027 said Khuv. \u0027I was on duty, keeping an eye - so to speak - on Simmons. Ten minutes ago they tried to get through to him! I cannot be mistaken: a strong telepathic probe was aimed directly at him. I sensed it and managed to scramble it - certainly I interfered with it - and when I could no longer detect it, then I came to find you. Of course, I left two of the squad there in my place in case there should be a recurrence. Oh, and on my way here I was given this to relay to you.\u0027 He handed Khuv a message from Communications Centre. Khuv glanced at it - and his forehead at once wrinkled into a frown. He read it again, his dark eyes darting over the printed page. \u0027Damn?\u0027 he said, softly - which from him meant more than any explosion. And to Vyotsky: \u0027Come, Karl. I think we should go at once and talk to Mr Simmons. Also, I intend to bring our plans for him forward a little. Doubtless you\u0027ll be sad to learn that from tonight you\u0027ll no longer be able to taunt him, for he won\u0027t be here.\u0027 He tucked the message from Comcen into his pocket, dismissing the fawning Savinkov with a wave of his hand. Vyotsky almost had to jog to keep up with Khuv when his boss now diverted and made for Simmons\u0027s cell. \u0027What is it, Major?\u0027 he said. \u0027Where did that message come from and what was in it?\u0027 \u0027This telepathic sending we\u0027ve just had reported to us,\u0027 Khuv mused, almost as if he hadn\u0027t heard the other\u0027s questions. \u0027It isn\u0027t the first, as you\u0027re aware...\u0027 He strode urgently ahead, with Vyotsky close at heel. \u0027Most of them have been merely inquisitive: the work of various groups of foreign seers or scryers trying to discover what\u0027s going on here. But they were very weak because the alien espers can\u0027t precisely pin-point our location - that is, they have no definite point of focus - and also because we\u0027re protected by the ravine. Our own psychics have been able to break them up or block them easily enough. Ah, but if a foreign power could actually get an ESP-endowed agent inside this place, then it might be a different story entirely!\u0027 \u0027But Simmons isn\u0027t talented that way,\u0027 Vyotsky protested. \u0027We are certain of that beyond any reasonable doubt.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s entirely true,\u0027 Khuv growled his answer, \u0027but I believe they\u0027ve found a way to use him anyway. In fact this message in my pocket confirms it.\u0027 He chuckled grimly, like a man who has just lost a piece in a game of chess. \u0027It can only be the British, for they\u0027re the most advanced in this game. The people in their E-Branch are a clever lot! They always have been - and extremely dangerous, as our espers learned to their cost at the Chateau Bronnitsy.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t follow you,\u0027 Vyotsky scowled through his beard. \u0027Simmons didn\u0027t worm his way in here; we caught him, and he certainly wasn\u0027t coming quietly!\u0027 \u0027Right again,\u0027 Khuv nodded sharply. \u0027We caught him, and we brought him here - but believe me we can no longer afford to keep him here. That\u0027s why he must go -tonight!\u0027 They had arrived at Simmons\u0027s cell. Outside the door, an armed, uniformed soldier lounged, coming to attention as Khuv and Vyotsky approached him. In a cell next door to the prisoner\u0027s, a pair of espers in plain-clothes sat at a table wrapped in their own thoughts and mental pursuits. Khuv went in and spoke to them briefly: \u0027You two - I suppose Savinkov has told you what\u0027s happened? That calls for extra security. Be alert as never before! In fact I want the entire squad - all of you, Savinkov included - on the job from now on. Full time! These measures won\u0027t be in force for long, probably only a matter of hours, but until I say otherwise that\u0027s how I want it. Pass it on, and make sure the rosters are adjusted accordingly.\u0027 He rejoined Vyotsky and the soldier on duty let them into Jazz\u0027s cell. The British agent was sprawled on his bunk, hands behind his head. He sat up as they entered, rubbed his eyes and yawned. \u0027Visitors!\u0027 he said, displaying his accustomed sarcasm. \u0027Well, well! Just as I was beginning to think you two had forgotten all about me. To what do I owe the honour?\u0027 Khuv smiled coldly. \u0027Why, we\u0027re here to talk to you about your D-cap, Michael - among other things. Your very interesting, very ingenious D-cap.\u0027 Jazz fingered the left side of his face, his lower jaw, and worked it from side to side. \u0027Sorry, but I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ve already got it,\u0027 he said, a little ruefully. \u0027And the tooth next door, too. But we\u0027re healing nicely, thanks.\u0027 Vyotsky advanced menacingly. \u0027I can very quickly stop you from healing nicely, British,\u0027 he growled. \u0027I can fix bits of you so they\u0027ll never heal again!\u0027 Khuv restrained him with an impatient sigh. \u0027Karl, sometimes you\u0027re a bore,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you know well enough that we need Mr Simmons fit and alert, or our little experiment won\u0027t be worth carrying out.\u0027 He looked pointedly at the prisoner. Jazz sat up straighter on his bed. \u0027Experiment?\u0027 he tried to smile enquiringly and failed miserably. \u0027What sort of experiment? And what\u0027s all this about my D-cap?\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s deal with that first,\u0027 Khuv answered. \u0027Our people in Moscow have analysed its contents: very complex but completely harmless drugs! They would have put you to sleep for a few hours, that\u0027s all.\u0027 He watched the other\u0027s reaction very closely. Jazz frowned, displayed open disbelief. \u0027That\u0027s ridiculous,\u0027 he finally replied. \u0027Not that I\u0027m the sort who\u0027d ever have used it - at least I don\u0027t think so - but those capsules are lethal!\u0027 His eyes narrowed. \u0027What are you up to, Comrade? Some silly scheme to lure me over to your side?\u0027 Again Khuv\u0027s smile. \u0027No, for I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ve no use for you, Michael - certainly not now that you\u0027ve seen the inside of the Perchorsk Projekt! But don\u0027t be so scornful of the possibility. I don\u0027t see that our side could be any worse than yours. After all, they haven\u0027t treated you too well so far, now have they?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\u0027 Jazz shook his head, stopped acting the comedian. \u0027Why don\u0027t you tell me why you\u0027re really here?\u0027 \u0027But I have,\u0027 Khuv answered. \u0027Part of it, anyway. As for what I\u0027m talking about: I\u0027m telling you that your people expected you to be caught! They couldn\u0027t be sure what sort of reception you\u0027d get, however, and they had to be sure that you wouldn\u0027t kill yourself too soon.\u0027 Jazz\u0027s frown deepened. \u0027Too soon for what?\u0027 \u0027Before they could use you, of course.\u0027 The frown stayed. \u0027What you\u0027re saying feels like it\u0027s making sense even though I know it can\u0027t be making any sense,\u0027 said Jazz. \u0027That is, if what you\u0027re saying is true!\u0027 \u0027Your confusion is understandable,\u0027 Khuv nodded, \u0027and very reassuring. It tells me you weren\u0027t a party to it. Your D-Cap was meant to fool you - ensure you\u0027d play out your part to the full - just as it was meant to fool us! It was designed to slow us down as much as possible. I would guess your espers, British E-Branch, rigged the whole thing. And sooner or later they would also find a way to get through to you, if they had the time. But they haven\u0027t. Not any more.\u0027 \u0027E-Branch? ESP?\u0027 Jazz threw up his hands. \u0027I\u0027ve already told you I don\u0027t know anything about that sort of thing. I don\u0027t even believe in that sort of thing!\u0027 Khuv sat down on a chair beside Jazz\u0027s bed, said: \u0027Then let\u0027s talk about something you do believe in.\u0027 His voice was very quiet, very dangerous now. \u0027You believe in that space-time Gate down in the magmass bowels of this place, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027I can accept the evidence of my own five senses, yes,\u0027 Jazz answered. Then accept this also: tonight you go through that Gate!\u0027 Jazz was stunned. \u0027I what?\u0027 Khuv stood up. \u0027It was my intention all along, but I wanted to be sure you were one hundred per cent recovered from your injuries before using you. Another three or four days at most.\u0027 He shrugged. \u0027But now we\u0027ve had to bring it forward. Whether you \"believe in that sort of thing\" or not, the world\u0027s E-Branches are very real. I am the appointed monitor and watchdog over just such a group of psychics, and several of my espers have been deployed here with me. Your people in the West are trying to use you as a \"mirror\" on our work here; so far they have not been successful; tonight we will ensure that they never are.\u0027 Jazz jumped to his feet, stepped toward Khuv. Vyotsky put himself in the way, said: \u0027Come on then, British, try me.\u0027 Jazz backed off a pace. He would dearly love to \u0027try\u0027 the big Russian, but in his own time, his own place. To Khuv he said: \u0027You force me through that damned Gate and you\u0027re no more than a murderer!\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Khuv shook his head. \u0027I am a patriot, devoted to my country\u0027s welfare. You are the murderer, Michael! Have you forgotten Boris Dudko, the man you killed on top of the ravine?\u0027 \u0027He tried to kill me!\u0027 Jazz protested. \u0027He did not,\u0027 Khuv shook his head, \u0027 - but if he had tried at least he would have had the right.\u0027 And here Khuv feigned outrage. \u0027What? An enemy agent engaged in espionage, deep inside a peaceful country\u0027s borders? Of course he had the right! And we also have the right to take your life.\u0027 That\u0027s against every convention!\u0027 Jazz knew he had no argument, but anything was worth the shot. \u0027On this occasion,\u0027 Khuv answered evenly, \u0027there are no conventions. We must dispose of you, surely you can see that? And in any case, it will not be murder.\u0027 \u0027Won\u0027t it?\u0027 Jazz flopped down again on his bed. \u0027Well, you can call it an experiment if you want to, but I call it murder. Jesus! You\u0027ve seen what comes through that sphere or Gate or whatever! What chance will one man have in the world they come from?\u0027 \u0027A very small one,\u0027 Khuv answered, \u0027but better than none at all.\u0027 Jazz thought about it, tried to imagine what it would be like, tried to get his suddenly whirling thoughts into order. \u0027A man alone,\u0027 he finally said, \u0027in a place like that. And I don\u0027t even know what \"like that\" means.\u0027 Khuv nodded. \u0027Sobering, isn\u0027t it? But ... not necessarily a man alone...\u0027 Jazz stared at him. \u0027Someone\u0027s going in with me?\u0027 \u0027Sadly, no,\u0027 Khuv smiled. \u0027Shall we say instead that someone - three someones - have already gone?\u0027 Jazz shook his head. \u0027I can\u0027t keep up with you,\u0027 he admitted. The first was a convicted thief and murderer, a local man. He was given a choice: execution or the Gate. Not much of a choice, really, I suppose. We equipped him, as we\u0027ll equip you, and sent him through. He had a radio but never used it, or if he did the Gate was a barrier. But it was worth a try; it would have been something of a novelty to receive radio transmissions from another universe, eh? He also had food concentrates, weapons, a compass - and most important - a great desire to live. His equipment was all of the very highest quality, and there was plenty of it - far more than I\u0027ve mentioned here. You shall have no less, maybe even more. It\u0027s al! a question of what you can carry, or what you\u0027re willing to carry. Anyway, after a fortnight we wrote him off. If there was a way back, he didn\u0027t find it - or maybe something found him first. I say we\u0027ve written him off, but of course he may still be alive on the other side. After all, we don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like there. \u0027Next we tried an esper - ah, yes! One of our very own elite! His name was, perhaps still is, Ernst Kopeler, a man with the astonishing power to see something of the future. What a waste, you are thinking, to send such a man through the Gate! Alas, Kopeler could never see eye to eye with our way of life. Twice he tried to - how do you say it - defect? That\u0027s how you say it, yes, but we call it vile treachery. The fool; with a talent like his, he expected freedom, too! His real reasons in the end were most ironic: he had apparently looked into his own future -and had found it monstrous, unbearable!\u0027 Jazz considered that. \u0027He knew he was going through the Gate,\u0027 he said. Khuv shrugged. \u0027Possibly. But, how do the Spanish say it? Que sera sera? Men cannot avoid their tomorrows, Michael. The sun sets, and it rises again for all of us.\u0027 \u0027Except me, eh?\u0027 Jazz gave a snort of self-derision. \u0027What about your third, er, \"volunteer\"? Another traitor?\u0027 Khuv nodded: \u0027Perhaps she was, yes, but we can\u0027t be sure.\u0027 \u0027She?\u0027 Jazz found it hard to believe. \u0027Are you telling me you actually sent a woman through there?\u0027 \u0027I am telling you exactly that,\u0027 Khuv answered, \u0027And a very beautiful woman at that. A great pity. Her name was or is Zek Foener. Zek is short for Zekintha. Her father was an East German, her mother a Greek. In her time she had been the most proficient esper of them all but... something happened. We can\u0027t be certain what changed her, but she lost her talent - or so she said. And she kept saying it for all of the six years she spent in a mental institution, where she was troublesome to a fault. Then she spent two more years in a forced labour camp in Siberia, where espers kept an eye on her. They swore that she was still a telepath, and she as vehemently denied it. All very annoying and a terrible waste. She had been a brilliant telepath; now she was a dissident, refused to conform, demanded the right to emigrate to Greece. In short, she had become a problem in far too many ways. So-\u0027 \u0027You got rid of her!\u0027 Jazz\u0027s tone was scornful. Khuv ignored the acid in the other\u0027s eyes. \u0027We told her: \"Go through the Gate, use your telepathy to tell us what it\u0027s like on the other side - for we\u0027ve people here who will hear you, be sure - and if you\u0027re successful and after you\u0027ve done all of these things to our satisfaction, then we\u0027ll bring you back.\"\u0027 Jazz stared coldly at Khuv, said: \u0027But you didn\u0027t know how to bring her back!\u0027 Again Khuv\u0027s shrug. \u0027No, but she didn\u0027t know that,\u0027 he said. \u0027So we are talking about murder after all,\u0027 Jazz nodded. \u0027Well, if you\u0027d do that to one of your own, I can\u0027t see how I can expect any better. You people are ... hell, you\u0027re shit!\u0027 Vyotsky grunted a warning, or a challenge, came forward with his huge hands reaching. Khuv laid a hand on his arm, stopped him. \u0027My patience is also used up, Karl. But what does it matter? Save your energy. Anyway, we\u0027re all through here. Believe me, I\u0027m just as sick of Mr Simmons as you are, but I still want him to go through the Gate in one piece.\u0027 They went to the door; Khuv knocked and it was opened for them; but on the point of leaving, suddenly the KGB Major said: \u0027Ah, but I had almost forgotten! By all means show Michael your dirty pictures, Karl. If we are shit, then by all means let\u0027s behave like shit!\u0027 Khuv went out through the door, disappeared without looking back. Vyotsky turned and looked at Jazz, grinned, and produced a small manila envelope from his pocket. \u0027Remember your friends at the logging camp? The Kirescus? As soon as we caught you your friends in the West tipped them off. We\u0027d had our suspicions about them for some time, and we were watching them when they made a run for it. I can\u0027t imagine where they thought they could run to! Anna Kirescu will go to a forced labour camp, and the boy Kaspar to an orphanage. Yuri put up a fight and had to be shot - fatally, naturally. That leaves only two of them.\u0027 \u0027Kazimir and his daughter, Tassi? What about them?\u0027 Jazz stood up. He could almost feel himself leaning in Vyotsky\u0027s direction. God, how he wanted the bully! \u0027Why, we have them, of course! There are so many things they can tell us. About their contacts here in Russia, and in the old country. But since they\u0027re a bit unsophisticated, our methods for extracting information needn\u0027t be so devious. We can allow ourselves to be more... direct? Do you follow me?\u0027 Jazz took a short pace forward. His emotions and temper were on the boil. He knew that if he took another step he\u0027d have to go all the way, hurl himself at Vyotsky. Which was probably what the KGB thug hoped he\u0027d do. \u0027An old man and a girl?\u0027 he grated the words out. \u0027Are you saying you\u0027d torture them?\u0027 Vyotsky licked his rough, fleshy lips, flipped the envelope across the cell, accurately onto Jazz\u0027s bed. \"There\u0027s torture and there\u0027s torture,\u0027 he said, his voice husky with inner lust. \u0027For example, these photographs will be torture for you. I mean, you and your little Tassi quite enjoyed each other, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 Jazz felt the blood draining from his face. He looked at the envelope, then back to Vyotsky. He was torn two ways. \u0027What the hell - ?\u0027 he said. \u0027See,\u0027 Vyotsky drawled, \u0027the Major knows how I enjoy taunting you, so he said it would be OK if we had a little photographic session, me and the girl. I hope you like them. Very artistic, I think.\u0027 Jazz flew at him. Vyotsky stepped backward through the door and slammed it in Jazz\u0027s face. Inside the cell Jazz skidded to a halt. He glared at the door, his breathing ragged in his chest and throat. At that moment he could have happily performed an operation on Vyotsky\u0027s intestines with a rusty penknife and no anaesthetic. But the photographs... Jazz stepped to the bed and took five small pictures from their envelope. The first was a little crumpled; Jazz knew it well: Tassi, sitting in a field of daisies. She\u0027d once given the picture to him. The next photograph showed her... naked, manacled to a steel wall. Her hands were chained over her head, her legs spread wide. The girl\u0027s eyes were squeezed tightly shut - and Vyotsky towered beside her, grinning, weighing her left breast in the palm of his hand. The third picture was worse and Jazz didn\u0027t even look at the others. He screwed them into a tight ball and hurled them away from him. And then he curled up on his bed and concentrated on pictures of his own. They centered on Vyotsky\u0027s intestines again, but this time there was no penknife. Just Jazz\u0027s fingernails. Outside the cell door Vyotsky stood for a moment with his ear to the cold steel. Nothing. Absolute silence. And Vyotsky thought: his blood must be water! He banged on the door. \u0027Michael,\u0027 he called out. \u0027Khuv says that tonight, after we\u0027re rid of you, then I can amuse myself with her for an hour or two. Life has its little moments, eh? 1 thought maybe you\u0027d like to tell me how she likes it? No... ?\u0027 Still silence. The grin slipped from Vyotsky\u0027s face. He scowled and walked away. Curled up tightly on his bed, Jazz Simmons gave a low moan where he bit his lip until it bled. His blood wasn\u0027t water but liquid fire... Over the space of the next five or six hours Jazz had a good many visitors. They came to his cell with various pieces of equipment whose functions were all minutely explained and demonstrated. He was even allowed to handle, take to pieces and reassemble them; and he worked hard at it, for they were survival. But the tiny flame-thrower came minus its gallon of fuel, and instead of the small caliber sub-machine gun he got only a handbook. The young soldier who turned up later that evening with the handbook also brought with him an ammunition box half-full of condemned rounds and rusting magazines. This was so Jazz could practice magazine loading. In a combat situation, the faster you can load a magazine the longer you live. Jazz had fumbled the first load, then concentrated, speeded up and succeeded in loading a second magazine in very quick time. The young soldier had been impressed, but after that he\u0027d yawned and lost interest. Jazz had continued to load and unload magazines for another half-hour. \u0027What are you in for?\u0027 the soldier had asked eventually. \u0027You mean why am I a prisoner? Espionage,\u0027 said Jazz. He saw little or no reason to hide the fact. Not now. \u0027Me,\u0027 the youth thumbed himself in the chest, \u0027it\u0027ll be mutiny if I don\u0027t get some sleep soon! There was a practice alert at the barracks last night, and I\u0027ve been on duty ever since. I\u0027m dead on my feet!\u0027 He frowned. \u0027Did you say espionage?\u0027 \u0027Spying,\u0027 Jazz nodded. He tossed the old magazines and a handful of discoloured, brass-jacketed shells into the ammo-box and slammed the lid, then fastened its hasps. Then he dusted his hands on his trousers and stood up. There. I think I can manage that well enough now.\u0027 \u0027Not much good, though, knowing how to load a magazine,\u0027 the soldier grinned, \u0027if you don\u0027t have a gun!\u0027 Jazz had grinned back. \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 he said. \u0027Are you going to bring me one?\u0027 \u0027Hah!\u0027 the youth had laughed out loud. \u0027Mutiny is one thing, but madness is something else again! Bring you a gun? Not me, friend. You\u0027ll get that later...\u0027 Now was the \u0027later\u0027 that the soldier had been talking about: 2 a.m. in the outside world, but inside the subterranean Perchorsk Complex the hour was of no real consequence. Things didn\u0027t change a great deal down here day or night. Not on a normal night, anyway. But tonight was different. Below the nightmare magmass levels, in the core of the place, Michael \u0027Jazz\u0027 Simmons stood on the Saturn\u0027s-rings platform and allowed himself to be kitted-up in his gear. In any case, he didn\u0027t have much choice about it. But he still hadn\u0027t been given the fuel tank for his mini-flame-thrower, and he was still minus his SMG. That was in the very capable hands of Karl Vyotsky, who cradled the lightweight weapon like a baby in his great arms. Vyotsky was to be Jazz\u0027s escort along the walkway. At last the agent had everything he could carry and still move with a degree of efficiency. He had refused a parka, and a huge woodsman\u0027s knife which must have weighed all of three pounds. But he\u0027d taken a small, razor-honed hatchet which would serve both as a weapon and as a most useful tool. Finally Khuv had stepped forward through the circle of people who\u0027d been attending to Jazz, said: \u0027Well, Michael, this is it. If I thought you would accept them, now would be the time to offer you my best wishes.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 Jazz looked him up and down. \u0027Personally I wouldn\u0027t offer you shit, Comrade!\u0027 The corners of Khuv\u0027s mouth turned down. \u0027Very well,\u0027 he said, \u0027so be hard! And stay hard, Michael. Who knows but that that way you might even survive. But if you do find a way to come back through, we\u0027ll be waiting. And then I\u0027ll look forward to hearing all about it. Eventually, you know, we\u0027ll be obliged to put an army through there; any advance knowledge would be a big help.\u0027 He nodded to Vyotsky. \u0027Let\u0027s go, British,\u0027 the big Russian prodded him with the business end of the SMG. Jazz moved inwards across the planking, glanced back once, shrugged and faced the sphere. Dark glasses protected his eyes from something of its glare, but even so the very plainness of the sphere\u0027s surface was a pain in itself; it was like looking at a dead channel on a live TV screen. Now the Saturn\u0027s-rings platform was left behind and Jazz went forward along the neck of the walkway. Scorched timbers underfoot told him that this was where the warrior had died, and it seemed he heard again that creature\u0027s cry: Wamphyri! Then - - They had reached the sphere. Jazz came to a halt, put out a hand. His fingers passed easily into the white light; there was no resistance, until he withdrew his hand again; but then he felt a weird viscosity, felt the sphere tugging at him. It didn\u0027t like to let go, not even from the first moment of penetration. He pulled his hand free, but not without a little effort. \u0027Hold it,\u0027 said Vyotsky from right behind him. \u0027Don\u0027t be too eager, British. You\u0027ll need these.\u0027 He hung a cylindrical aluminium bottle on Jazz\u0027s harness at the rear: the fuel for his flame-thrower. Then he said, Turn around.\u0027 Jazz obeyed him. Vyotsky grinned at him and said: \u0027You\u0027re very pale, British! Feels queer, does it?\u0027 \u0027A little,\u0027 Jazz answered truthfully. Now that it was inevitable it did feel a little queer. It would be a lot worse except he wasn\u0027t concentrating on his feelings but something else entirely. Vyotsky searched his face for a moment, said: \u0027Huh! I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re a hero or just plain stupid! Whichever, this is yours.\u0027 He removed the magazine from the SMG and handed the weapon to Jazz. Then, chuckling, he said, \u0027Wouldn\u0027t you like this, too, British?\u0027 He shook the magazine in his hand until it rattled. \u0027A lot handier right now than the ones you have in your pack, eh?\u0027 The other\u0027s drawn face was all concentration, showing no emotion whatever; and suddenly Vyotsky thought: something\u0027s wrong here! He stopped grinning, took a single backward step. Jazz\u0027s right hand snatched at a pocket of his one-piece combat suit, came out holding a rusty but serviceable magazine. In a single fast-flowing movement he slapped the magazine into its housing and cocked the weapon. \u0027Stand still!\u0027 he snapped at Vyotsky. Vyotsky froze. Jazz closed the distance between, stuck the muzzle of his gun up under the Russian\u0027s chin. And he grated: \u0027Funny, but you\u0027re looking a bit pale, Ivan! Is something bothering you?\u0027 Khuv came running from the Saturn\u0027s-rings platform. \u0027Hold your fire!\u0027 he yelled - not to Jazz but to the soldiers on the perimeter where all weapons were aimed at the British agent. Khuv skidded to a halt a good ten feet away. \u0027Michael,\u0027 he panted. \u0027What\u0027s on your mind?\u0027 \u0027Isn\u0027t it obvious?\u0027 Jazz was almost enjoying this. \u0027Ivan the Terrible here is coming with me.\u0027 He took a firm grip on Vyotsky\u0027s beard, pushed the SMG up harder under the Russian\u0027s chin, backed toward the sphere. Vyotsky was white as death. \u0027No!\u0027 he gurgled; but he didn\u0027t dare to struggle, not and risk the Englishman putting too great a pressure on that trigger. \u0027Oh yes you are, Ivan - or you die right here!\u0027 Jazz told him. \u0027Me, I\u0027ve nothing to lose.\u0027 He could feel the outer skin of the gate tugging at him. Khuv came closer, and Jazz was struck with an even better scenario. \u0027You too, Major,\u0027 he said, \u0027or I shoot right through this bastard and into you!\u0027 Khuv was fast; he was in motion on the instant Jazz\u0027s words registered, falling flat to the walkway and screaming: Fire, fire,fire.\u0027 Jazz tumbled backwards into the sphere, yanking the stumbling Vyotsky after him. And - - It was white in there! It was pure white, a solid white background against which Jazz and Vyotsky formed the only imperfections. They rolled on a solid-seeming floor, made invisible because it too was pure white! Shots were screaming overhead in a deafening barrage of rumbling thunder - which ceased in another moment as Khuv\u0027s voice, slowed down to an almost unrecognizable drone, howled as if from an infinity away: \u0027C-e-a-s-e f-i-r-e! C-e-a-s-e f-i-r-e.r Now that they were inside the sphere and he was safe, he didn\u0027t want any further harm to befall them. Jazz stood up, looked back. Through a thin film of milk, \u0027outside\u0027, all motion seemed slowed down almost to a standstill. It was a two-way effect. Khuv was half-way to his feet, one arm and hand raised high overhead as he signalled the ceasefire. Jazz waved at him, then turned and pointed his gun at Vyotsky where he sprawled, terrified. \u0027Up you get, Ivan,\u0027 he said, and his voice came out sounding perfectly normal. \u0027Let\u0027s move it, shall we?\u0027 Vyotsky looked around, came to his senses. His shoulders slumped. He slowly got to his feet, said: \u0027Fuck you, British!\u0027 and made a dive toward Khuv. Or attempted to. Useless, for from now on this was a one-way trip! He hit against an invisible barrier, slid to his knees clawing at thin air. And as the truth dawned on him, then he did what Jazz expected him to do: he started screaming for help! Jazz watched him grovelling there for a moment, then said: \u0027Suit yourself, Ivan. Stay here and scream and gibber, and in the end die.\u0027 Vyotsky\u0027s head turned swiftly. \u0027Die?\u0027 Jazz nodded. \u0027Of starvation, or exhaustion...\u0027 Then he turned his back on the view beyond the Gate - of Khuv, against a backdrop of magmass walls and slow-motion soldiery - and started forward into what looked and felt like an aching white immensity. From behind him Vyotsky snarled, \u0027But why? Why? What good am I to you, here?\u0027 \u0027None at all,\u0027 Jazz called back. \u0027But you\u0027d have been even less good to Tassi...\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-8.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
