{"id":62502,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Deal with the Devil\\n\\n When Jazz Simmons regained consciousness he saw that he was where he\u0027d fallen, except now his hands were tied behind him. Zek, who hadn\u0027t been trussed, was busy moistening his brow and lips with a water-soaked rag. She sighed her relief as he came to.\\n\\n Arlek sat close by on a flat stone, watching her at her ministrations. Others of the clan or tribe moved in shadows which had lengthened a little, murmuring with low background voices. As Jazz struggled to sit up, so Arlek came across and stood over him. He fingered a lump under his ear where Jazz had hit him, displayed a right eye rapidly turning black and closing.\\n\\n \u0027I never saw anyone fight like you,\u0027 he stiffly complimented his captive. \u0027I didn\u0027t even see you strike me!\u0027\\n\\n Jazz grunted, propped himself against a boulder and brought his knees up a little. \u0027That was the idea,\u0027 he said. \u0027There\u0027s a lot more I could show you, too, like how to fight the Wamphyri. That\u0027s what my weapons were for: to keep me alive in a world where things like the Wamphyri rule. Where the hell do men stand in the scale of things on this world, anyway? Why bargain with the Wamphyri, or bow and scrape to them, when you can fight them?\u0027\\n\\n Despite his painful face, Arlek laughed out loud. Other Travellers heard him, came forward; he quickly repeated what Jazz had said. \u0027Fight the Wamphyri, indeed! We are only lucky they spend so much time fighting with each other! But defy them? Hah! You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re saying. They don\u0027t fight with Sunsiders, they just make slaves of them. Have you seen a Warrior? Of course not, else you\u0027d not be here! That\u0027s why we\u0027re Travellers, because to remain in one place is to be at their mercy. You don\u0027t \"fight\" the Wamphyri, my stupid friend, you just stay out of their way - for as long as you can.\u0027\\n\\n He turned away, walked off with his followers. Over his shoulder he called back: \u0027Talk with the woman. It\u0027s high time she told you something about this world you\u0027ve come to. At least then you\u0027ll have some understanding of why I\u0027m giving you - both of you - to Shaithis of the Wamphyri...\u0027\\n\\n Wolf loped out of the shadows, licked Jazz\u0027s face. Jazz scowled at the animal. \u0027Where were you when Zek and me were fighting, eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When you were fighting,\u0027 she corrected him. \u0027Wolf wasn\u0027t in it. Why should I risk his life? I told him to be still. He\u0027s just back from seeing his brothers. The Travellers have three or four of them, all raised from cubs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Funny,\u0027 Jazz said after a moment, \u0027but you struck me as a woman who\u0027d bite and scratch a lot.\u0027 He didn\u0027t mean it as a reproach, but it was and he regretted it immediately.\\n\\n \u0027I would,\u0027 she said, \u0027if there was any point. But I\u0027d look silly trying to bite a dozen Travellers and their wolves, now wouldn\u0027t I? My first concern was for you.\u0027\\n\\n Jazz sighed. \u0027I suppose I went off half-cocked, didn\u0027t I? But I thought you said we\u0027d be safe?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We might have been,\u0027 she said, \u0027but while you\u0027ve been lying there Arlek\u0027s had word from a runner that Lardis Lidesci is on his way back from the west. Arlek knows Lardis won\u0027t give me to the Wamphyri, and so he\u0027ll do it himself - now! There\u0027ll be a price to pay when Lardis hears about it, but Arlek\u0027s got this group on his side and believes that in the end Lardis will have to go along with him or split the tribe. In any case, by the time Lardis gets here it will be too late.\u0027\\n\\n Jazz said: \u0027Can you touch me behind my ear just here? Ow! That feels tender!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s soft,\u0027 she said, and he thought he detected a catch in her voice. \u0027God, I thought you were dead!\u0027 She squeezed cold water onto the back of his head, let it soak into the place where his hair was matted with blood. He looked beyond her to the south, to where the sun had gone down a little more, crept a little more to the east.\\n\\n A stray beam lit her face, let him see her clearly and really close up for the first time. She was a bit grimy, but under the dirt she was very beautiful too. She\u0027d be in her early thirties, only a few years older than Jazz himself. Maybe five-nine, slim, blonde and blue-eyed, her hair shone in the beam of sunlight; it looked golden and bounced on her shoulders when she moved. Her combat suit, tattered as it was getting to be, fitted her figure like a glove; it seemed to accentuate her delicate curves. Right here and now, Jazz supposed any woman would have looked good to him. But he couldn\u0027t think of one he\u0027d rather have here. Or (he corrected himself), rather not have here. This was no place for any woman.\\n\\n \u0027So what\u0027s happening now?\u0027 he asked, when the cold water had taken some of the sting out of his neck and head.\\n\\n \u0027Arlek tracked me using the talents of an old man, Jasef Karis,\u0027 Zek told him. \u0027It wasn\u0027t too hard. There was really only one place I could head for: through the pass to the sphere, to see if I could make it back home. Anyway, Jasef\u0027s like me, a telepath.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You told me the wild animals here had a degree of ESP,\u0027 Jazz reminded her, \u0027but you didn\u0027t say anything about the people. I\u0027d got the impression that only the Wamphyri had these talents.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Generally, that\u0027s true,\u0027 she answered. \u0027Jasef\u0027s father was taken prisoner in a Wamphyri raid; this was a long time ago, you understand. He escaped from them and came back over the mountains. He swore that he hadn\u0027t been changed in any way. He\u0027d escaped before the Lord Belath could make a mindless zombie of him. His wife took him back, of course, and they had a child: Jasef. But then it was discovered that Jasef\u0027s father had lied. He had been changed by the Lord Belath, but he\u0027d made his escape before the change could commence in him. The truth finally came out when he became uncontrollable -became, in fact, a thing! The Travellers knew how to deal with it; they staked it out, cut it in pieces and burned it. And afterwards they kept a close watch on Jasef and his mother. But they were OK. Jasef\u0027s telepathy is something come down to him from his father, or from the thing that Lord Belath put into him.\u0027\\n\\n Jazz\u0027s head swam, partly from the throbbing pain where he\u0027d been clubbed but mainly from trying to take in all that Zek was telling him. \u0027Stop!\u0027 he said. \u0027Let\u0027s concentrate on the important stuff. Tell me what else I\u0027ll need to know about this planet. Draw me a map I can keep in my head. First the planet, then its peoples.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 she nodded, \u0027but first you\u0027d better know how we stand. Old Jasef and one or two men have gone on into the pass to see if there\u0027s a watcher - a guardian creature - in the keep back there. If there is, Jasef will send a telepathic message through it to its master, the Lord Shaithis. The message will be that Arlek holds us captive, and that he\u0027ll use us to strike a bargain with Shaithis. In return for us, Shaithis will promise not to raid on Lardis Lidesci\u0027s tribe of Travellers. If it\u0027s a deal, then we\u0027ll be handed over.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027From what Arlek was saying about the Wamphyri,\u0027 Jazz said, \u0027I\u0027m surprised they\u0027ll even be interested in making a deal. If they\u0027re so much to be feared, they can just take us anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If they could find us,\u0027 she answered. \u0027And only at night. They can only raid when the sun\u0027s down below the rim of the world. Also, there are some eighteen to twenty Wamphyri Lords, and one Lady. They\u0027re territorial; they vie with each other. They scheme against each other all the time, and go to war at every opportunity. It\u0027s their nature. We\u0027d be ace cards to any one of them - except the Lady Karen. I know for I was hers once, and she let me go.\u0027\\n\\n Jazz tucked that last away for later. \u0027Why are we so important?\u0027 he wanted to know.\\n\\n \u0027Because we are magicians,\u0027 she said. \u0027We have powers, weapons, skills they don\u0027t understand. Even more so than the Travellers, we understand metals and mechanisms.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Jazz was lost again. \u0027Magicians?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m a telepath,\u0027 she shrugged. To be ESP-endowed and a true man - or a woman - is a rare thing. Also, we\u0027re not of this world. We come from the mysterious hell-lands. And when I first arrived here I had awesome weapons. So did you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I\u0027m not ESP-talented,\u0027 Jazz reminded her. \u0027What use will I be to them?\u0027\\n\\n She looked away. \u0027Not a lot. Which means you\u0027ll have to bluff your way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll have to what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If in fact we go to the Lord Shaithis, you\u0027ll need to tell him you... can read the future! Something like that. Something it\u0027s hard to disprove.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Great!\u0027 said Jazz, dully. \u0027Like Arlek, you mean? He said he\u0027d read the future of the tribe.\u0027\\n\\n She faced him again, shook her head. \u0027Arlek\u0027s a charlatan. A cheap, trick fortune-teller, like many of Earth\u0027s Gypsies. Our Earth, I mean. That\u0027s why he\u0027s so much against me, because he knows my talent\u0027s real.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK,\u0027 said Jazz. \u0027Now let\u0027s put our Earth right out of our minds and tell me some more about this Earth. Its topography, for example?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So simple you won\u0027t believe it,\u0027 she answered. \u0027I\u0027ve already described the planet in relation to its sun and moon. Very well, now here\u0027s that map you asked for:\\n\\n \u0027This is a world much the same size as Earth as near as I can make out. This mountain range lies slightly more south than north, points east and west. That\u0027s using the compass Earth-style. The Wamphyri can\u0027t stand sunlight. Just like the old legends of home say, too much sunlight is fatal to vampires. And they are vampires! Sunside of the mountains, that\u0027s where the Travellers live. They are human beings, as you\u0027ve seen. They live close to the mountain range for the water it gives them, and for the forests and game. Sunup they live in easily erected homes, at night they find caves and go as deep as possible! The mountains are riddled with fissures and caverns. Ten miles or so south of the mountains, there are no Travellers. There\u0027s nothing there for them to live on. Just desert. There are scattered nomad tribes of aborigines; at high sunup they occasionally trade with the Travellers; I\u0027ve seen them and they\u0027re barely human. Several steps down from Australia\u0027s bushmen. I don\u0027t know how they live out there but they do. One hundred miles out from the mountains and even they can\u0027t live. There\u0027s nothing there at all, just scorched earth.\u0027\\n\\n Despite his discomfort, Jazz was finding all of this fascinating. \u0027What about east and west?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n She nodded: \u0027Just coming to it. These mountains are about two and a half thousand miles east to west. This pass lies something like six hundred miles from the western extent of the range. Beyond the mountains west are swamps; likewise to the far east. No one knows their extent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why the hell don\u0027t the Travellers live close to the swamps?\u0027 Jazz was puzzled. \u0027If there are no mountains there, then there\u0027s no protection from the sun. Which means there can\u0027t be any Wamphyri.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right!\u0027 she said. \u0027The Wamphyri live only in their castles, right here behind these mountains. But the Travellers can\u0027t go too far east or west, because the swamps are vampire breeding grounds. They are the source of vampirism, just as this world is the source of Earth\u0027s legends.\u0027\\n\\n Jazz tried to take that in, shook his head. \u0027You\u0027ve lost me yet again,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027No Wamphyri there, and yet vampires breed in the swamps?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe you weren\u0027t listening to me earlier,\u0027 she said. \u0027I can understand that. It\u0027s like Arlek said: you\u0027ve a lot to learn. And only so much time in which to learn it. I told you that the Wamphyri are what happens when a vampire egg gets into a man or woman. Well, the true vampires live in the swamps. They breed there. Every now and then there\u0027s an upsurge; they break out and infest the local animals. And they\u0027d do the same to men, too, if there were any there. The Wamphyri go back to a time when men were infested. Now they do their own infesting.\u0027 She shuddered. \"The Wamphyri are men, but changed by the vampires in them.\u0027\\n\\n Jazz took a deep breath, said: \u0027Whoah! Let\u0027s get back to topography.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing more to tell,\u0027 she answered. \u0027Starside are the Wamphyri castles and the Wamphyri themselves. North of them lie the icelands. One or two polar-type creatures live there, but that\u0027s all. They\u0027re legendary anyway, for no living Traveller ever saw one. Oh, and at the foot of the mountains on Starside, between the castles and the peaks, that\u0027s where the troglodytes live. They\u0027re subterranean, sub-human, too. They call themselves Szgany or trogs and hold the Wamphyri as gods. I saw specimens mothballed in the Lady Karen\u0027s storehouses. They\u0027re almost prehistoric.\u0027\\n\\n She paused for breath, finally said: That\u0027s it, the planet and its peoples in one. There\u0027s only one thing I\u0027ve left out - that I can think of at the moment, anyway - because I\u0027m not sure of it myself. But you can be certain it\u0027s something monstrous.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Monstrous?\u0027 Jazz repeated her. \u0027Most of what I\u0027ve heard is that! Let\u0027s have it anyway, and then I\u0027ve got some more questions for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 she frowned, \u0027there\u0027s supposed to be something called \"Arbiteri Ingertos Westweich\". That\u0027s from a Wamphyri phrase and it means - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Him in His Western Garden?\u0027 Jazz tried it for himself.\\n\\n She smiled a half-smile, slowly nodded. \u0027Arlek was wrong about you,\u0027 she said. \u0027And so was I. You do learn fast. It\u0027s The-Dweller-in-His-Garden-in-the-West.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Same difference,\u0027 Jazz shrugged, and then it was his turn to frown. \u0027But that sounds sort of placid to me. Hardly monstrous!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s as it may be,\u0027 she answered, \u0027but the Wamphyri fear it or him or whatever mightily. Now, I\u0027ve told you how they\u0027re forever squabbling, warring with each other? Well, in one circumstance - to one extent - they\u0027re entirely united. All the Wamphyri. They\u0027d give a lot to be rid of The Dweller. He\u0027s legended to be a fabulous magician whose home is said to lie in a green valley somewhere in the central peaks to the west. I say \"legended\u0027, but that might give the wrong impression. In fact it\u0027s a very recent legend, maybe as little as a dozen Earth years. That\u0027s when the stories started, apparently. Since then he\u0027s been said to have lived there, marked out his own territory, guards it jealously and deals ruthlessly with would-be invaders.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Even the Wamphyri?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Especially the Wamphyri, as far as is known. The Wamphyri tell horror stories about him you wouldn\u0027t believe. Which, considering their nature, is really saying something!\u0027\\n\\n As she finished speaking, so there was movement northward in the pass. Arlek and his men sprang immediately alert; they called forward their wolves, took up their arms. Jazz saw that they had torches smeared in a black, tarry liquid ready for lighting. Others stood ready with flints.\\n\\n Arlek hurried over, hauled Jazz to his feet. \u0027This could be Jasef,\u0027 he said, hoarsely, \u0027and it could be something else. The sun is almost down.\u0027\\n\\n To Zek, Jazz said: \u0027Are those flints of theirs reliable? There\u0027s a book of matches in my top pocket. And cigarettes, too. Seems they didn\u0027t want them, only the heavy stuff.\u0027 He\u0027d spoken in Russian and Arlek hadn\u0027t caught his meaning. The Gypsy turned his leathery face enquiringly in Zek\u0027s direction.\\n\\n She sneered at him, said something that Jazz didn\u0027t catch. Then she unbuttoned Jazz\u0027s pocket, took out the matches. She showed them to Arlek, struck one. It flared at once and the Gypsy cursed, gave a great start, struck it aside out of her hand. The look on his face was one of shock, total disbelief.\\n\\n Zek quickly snarled something at him, and this time Jazz caught the word \u0027coward!\u0027 He wished she wouldn\u0027t be so free with that word, not with Arlek. Then, very slowly and deliberately, as if she talked to a dull child, she hissed: \u0027For the torches, you fool, in case this is not Jasef!\u0027\\n\\n He gawped at her, blinked his brown eyes nervously, but finally he nodded his understanding.\\n\\n In any case, it was Jasef. An old man with a staff, assisted by two younger Gypsies, came hobbling gratefully into the last few feeble rays of sunlight. He made his way straight to Arlek, said: \u0027There was a watcher, a trog. But the trog\u0027s master, the Lord Shaithis, had given him the power to speak over great distances. He saw the man -this one, Jazz - come through the pass, and he reported it to Shaithis. Shaithis would have come at once, but the sun-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes - get on with it,\u0027 Arlek snapped.\\n\\n Jasef shrugged his frail shoulders. \u0027I did not speak to this Szgany trog face to face, you understand. Worse things might have been lurking in the keep. I stayed outside and spoke to him in my head, in the manner of the Wamphyri.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course, that\u0027s understood!\u0027 Arlek was almost beside himself.\\n\\n \u0027I gave the trog your message, and he passed it on to his Wamphyri Lord. Then he told me to return to you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Arlek was obviously dumbfounded. \u0027Is that all?\u0027\\n\\n Again Jasef could only offer his shrug. \u0027He said: \"Tell Arlek of the Travellers that my Lord Shaithis will speak to him in person.\" I have no idea what he meant.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Old fool!\u0027 Arlek muttered. He turned away from Jasef - and Zek\u0027s radio crackled where its aerial projected an inch or two from her pocket. Its tiny red monitor light began to blink and flicker. Arlek gasped and leaped backwards a full pace, pointed at the radio and stared round-eyed as Zek produced it. \u0027More of your foul magic?\u0027 he half-accused. \u0027We should have destroyed all of your things long ago - and you with them - instead of letting Lardis give them back to you!\u0027\\n\\n Zek had been startled, too, but only for a moment. Now she said: \u0027I got them back because there was no harm in them and they were useless to you. Also because they were mine. Unlike you, Lardis isn\u0027t a thief! I\u0027ve told the Travellers many times that this thing is for communicating over great distances, haven\u0027t I? But because there was no one to talk to it wouldn\u0027t work. It\u0027s a machine, not magic. Well, now there is someone to talk to, and he wants to communicate.\u0027 And to Jazz, in a lower tone: \u0027I think I know what this means.\u0027\\n\\n He nodded, said, \u0027Those ace cards you mentioned?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 she answered. \u0027I think the Lord Shaithis already has one - or if not an ace, certainly a joker. He\u0027s got Karl Vyotsky!\u0027 Then she spoke into the radio: \u0027Unknown call-sign, this is Zek Foener. Send your message, over?\u0027\\n\\n Her radio crackled again, and a once-familiar voice, shaky, a little urgent and breathless but fairly coherent, said, \u0027You can throw out the radio procedure, Zek. This is Karl Vyotsky. Do you have Arlek of the Travellers with you?\u0027 He sounded like he wasn\u0027t too sure of what he was saying, as if he simply relayed the requirements of some other.\\n\\n Jazz said, \u0027Let me speak to him,\u0027 and Zek held the radio to his face. \u0027Who wants to know, Comrade?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n And after a moment\u0027s silence, in a tone which was suddenly pleading: \u0027Listen, British: we\u0027re on different sides, I know, but if you foul me up now it\u0027s all over for me. My radio is acting up. Sometimes it receives and other times it doesn\u0027t. Right now I have excellent elevation - you wouldn\u0027t believe the elevation I have - but still I don\u0027t trust this radio. So don\u0027t waste any time with games. I can\u0027t believe you\u0027d let me live once just to kill me now. So if this Arlek is with you, please put him on. Tell him Shaithis of the Wamphyri wants to talk to him.\u0027\\n\\n Arlek had heard his name spoken twice, and Shaithis\u0027s name several times. The conversation obviously concerned himself and the Wamphyri Lord. He held out a hand for the radio, said: \u0027Give it to me.\u0027\\n\\n If Jazz had held the radio he would have thrown it down, stamped on it and wrecked it. No communications, no deal. Zek might well have had the same idea, but she wasn\u0027t quick enough. Arlek snatched the radio from her, fumbled with it for a moment and finally, a little awkwardly, said: \u0027I am Arlek.\u0027\\n\\n The radio crackled some more, and in a little while a new male voice said: \u0027Arlek of the Travellers - of the tribe of Lardis Lidesci - it is Shaithis of the Wamphyri who speaks to you. How is it you have the power and not Lardis? Have you replaced him as leader of the tribe?\u0027 The voice was the darkest, most menacing Jazz had ever heard. But at the same time, while there was something inhuman about it, it was definitely the voice of a man. Deep and rumbling with controlled strength, forming each word perfectly and with unswervable authority, the owner of that voice knew that whoever he spoke to, that person was an inferior.\\n\\n Arlek had quickly mastered the radio. \u0027Lardis is away,\u0027 he said. \u0027He may return and he may not. Even if he does, still there are Travellers with me who are dissatisfied with his leadership. The futures are not at all clear. Many things are possible.\u0027\\n\\n Shaithis got straight to the point: \u0027My watcher has told me you have the woman who was the Lady Karen\u0027s thought-thief, the woman Zekintha from the hell-lands. Also, you have a man from the hell-lands, who is a magician and bears strange weapons.\u0027\\n\\n These things your watcher tells you are true,\u0027 Arlek answered, more at ease now.\\n\\n \u0027And is it also true that you desire to come to some agreement with me in respect of this man and woman?\u0027\\n\\n That is also true. Give me your word that in future you will not raid on the so-called tribe of Lardis, and in turn I\u0027ll hand over to you these magicians from the hell-lands.\u0027\\n\\n The radio was silent and it appeared that Shaithis was considering Arlek\u0027s proposition. At last he said: \u0027And their weapons?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Also their belongings, yes,\u0027 Arlek answered. \u0027All except an axe, which belonged to the man. This I claim for myself. Even so, the benefits for the Wamphyri Lord Shaithis will be great. Strange weapons to aid you in your wars, devices such as this communicator, which you apparently understand well enough, and their magic to use as you will.\u0027\\n\\n Shaithis seemed swayed. \u0027Hmm! You know that I am only one Lord and there are others of the Wamphyri? I can only speak for myself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you are the greatest of the Wamphyri!\u0027 Arlek was sure of himself now. \u0027I do not ask for your protection, merely that if the occasion should arise, then that you\u0027d obstruct the other Lords in their raids. There are many Travellers and we are, after all, only one small tribe. You would not raid upon us, and you would ensure - if it please you - that the raids of your fellow Lords were made that much more difficult to accomplish...\u0027\\n\\n Shaithis\u0027s voice sank deeper yet. \u0027I recognize no \"fellow\" Lords, Arlek. Only enemies. As for placing obstructions in their way: I do that already. I always will.\u0027\\n\\n Then you would perhaps do it more diligently,\u0027 Arlek pressed. And he repeated: \u0027We are a small tribe, Lord Shaithis. I make no request in respect of Travellers of any other ilk.\u0027\\n\\n Zek tried to snatch the radio from him but he turned his back on her. Two of his men grabbed her arms, held her still. \u0027Black-hearted, treacherous - !\u0027 She was lost for words.\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Shaithis. \u0027Now tell me, how will you give the two to me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I shall bind them securely,\u0027 Arlek answered, \u0027and leave them here in this place. We are some little way beyond the keep in the pass.\u0027 \u0027Their weapons will be left close to hand?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Arlek squared back his shoulders, flared his nostrils. Even in his treachery, his dark eyes were bright.\\n\\n It was all going according to plan. The Wamphyri were a curse; but with the curse lifted, even partly lifted ... it would not be long before Lardis Lidesci would be usurped. \u0027Then do it now, Arlek of the Travellers. Bind them, leave them there, and begone! Shaithis conies! Let me not find you there upon my arrival. The pass is in any case mine... after dark.\u0027\\n\\n They lay there alone, in darkness, with only the sound of their own breathing. To the south Arlek and his band moved off; it appeared that Wolf had gone with them. As the sounds of their hurried departure echoed back, Jazz said: \u0027I still think that beast of yours didn\u0027t make much of a guard dog.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Be quiet,\u0027 she said. And that was all. She lay very still. Jazz turned his head, stared north up the pass. Only the cold gleam of starlight that way. He strained his ears. Nothing, as yet.\\n\\n \u0027Why be quiet?\u0027 he finally whispered.\\n\\n \u0027I was trying to get through to Wolf,\u0027 she answered. \u0027He would have attacked them at any time - and been killed for it. I held him back. He\u0027s been a good friend and companion to me, and it wasn\u0027t the time. Now is the time!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve seen his teeth - they\u0027re sharp as chisels! I\u0027ve called to him. If he heard me, and if he\u0027s not too involved with the other wolves, he\u0027ll return. We\u0027re bound with leather, but given a little time...\u0027\\n\\n Jazz rolled over to face her. \u0027Well, at least we should have plenty of that. I saw the Wamphyri castles on the stacks. They were miles away. And then there\u0027s the length of the pass, too.\u0027\\n\\n She shook her head. \u0027Jazz, even now it\u0027s almost too late.\u0027 As she spoke, Wolf came loping, tongue lolling. Behind him the southern gap of the pass was lit with a fast-fading golden haze.\\n\\n Too late?\u0027 Jazz repeated her. \u0027You mean because the sun\u0027s down?\u0027\\n\\n That wasn\u0027t my meaning.\u0027 she answered. \u0027And anyway, it isn\u0027t down. A mile south of here, the pass rises briefly to a shallow crest, then dips sharply and turns a little toward the east. From there it\u0027s a steep, steady slope down to Sunside. The sun\u0027s just over our horizon, that\u0027s all. On Sunside there are still many hours of light left. But... Shaithis will be here very soon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He has transport?\u0027 Jazz was puzzled, half-flippant.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, he has,\u0027 Zek answered... \u0027Jazz, I can\u0027t turn face-down. There\u0027s a large rock sticking in me. But if you can manage it, then I\u0027ll tell Wolf to chew on your bindings.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re crediting old Lupus here with a deal of intelligence,\u0027 Jazz was sceptical.\\n\\n \u0027A mind-picture is worth a thousand words,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Oh!\u0027 Jazz said. He struggled to turn face-down, but -\\n\\n \u0027Before you do,\u0027 she said, breathlessly, \u0027will you kiss me?\u0027 She wormed herself fractionally closer.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 he stopped struggling.\\n\\n \u0027Only if you want to, of course,\u0027 she said. \u0027But... you might never get another chance.\u0027\\n\\n He craned forward, kissed her as best he could. Out of air, finally they broke apart. \u0027Are you reading my thoughts?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good! But now I know what you taste like, the sooner Wolf gets to work on these bindings the better.\u0027 He rolled over onto his face. Trussed like a chicken, his legs were bent at the knees, feet uppermost. His wrists were tied behind his back, and tied again, to his feet. Wolf at once began tugging at Jazz\u0027s leather bindings. \u0027No, dammit!\u0027 Jazz spat out dirt. \u0027Don\u0027t pull, chew!\u0027 And in a little while Wolf was doing just that.\\n\\n Jazz could see his packs, gun, Zek\u0027s too, lying only paces away. The weapons had a metallic sheen in the dark. \u0027I notice Arlek took my compo,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Compo?\u0027\\n\\n The hard-tack. The food.\u0027\\n\\n She was silent.\\n\\n \u0027I mean, he did tell Shaithis he\u0027d leave everything except my hatchet.\u0027\\n\\n Quietly she said: \u0027But he knew Shaithis would have no use for the food.\u0027\\n\\n Jazz tried to turn his face her way. \u0027Oh? But he eats, doesn\u0027t - \u0027 And he paused. He could see her eyes, unblinking in the dark shadow of her face. The Lord Shaithis of the Wamphyri,\u0027 he grunted. \u0027Of course. He\u0027s a vampire, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jazz,\u0027 she said, \u0027hope springs eternal, but - maybe I should tell you something of how it could be. I mean, if we\u0027re taken.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think maybe you should,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Something small, black, chittering, flitted close by, came closer in dips and swoops, then darted off again. Then another, and more, until the air seemed full of them. Jazz had frozen into stone, stopped breathing, but Zek said: \u0027Bats - but just bats. Ordinary bats. Not Wamphyri familiars. The Wamphyri use the real things for that. The big ones. Desmodus, the vampire.\u0027\\n\\n A thong parted behind Jazz\u0027s back, and very quickly another. Jazz flexed his wrists and felt a little give in his bindings. Wolf carried on chewing. \u0027You were going to tell me about Shaithis\u0027s transport,\u0027 Jazz reminded Zek.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said, \u0027I wasn\u0027t.\u0027 Her tone of voice told him not to ask any more. But in any case he didn\u0027t need to. As the last thong parted and his straining wrists flew apart, he straightened his aching legs, rolled over onto his back and looked up. His eyes were drawn to an ominous stirring overhead. Level with the high walls of the pass, a black blot - several of them - shut out the stars as they began to descend.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell - ?\u0027 Jazz whispered.\\n\\n They\u0027re here!\u0027 Zek breathed. \u0027Quickly, Jazz! Oh, be quick!\u0027\\n\\n Wolf loped anxiously to and fro, whining, while Jazz got his cramped fingers to work on the thongs binding his feet. At last they were free. He turned to Zek, rolled her unceremoniously face-down across his knees, went frantically to work on her knots. As each one came undone, he kept glancing up at the heights a little north of their position.\\n\\n The descending blots were falling like flat stones dropped in still water, sliding from side to side, settling like autumn leaves on a deathly still early September morning. Three of them, their true outlines were now distinguishable: huge, diamond-shaped, where opposing points of the diamonds merged into heads and tails. They side-slipped this way and that, settling silently down toward the bed of the pass.\\n\\n Zek\u0027s hands were almost free; Jazz left them and turned his attention to her feet. It was his thought to pick her up, throw her over his shoulder and run. But he faced the truth: his legs were still badly cramped and the darkness was now almost complete. He\u0027d only be able to stumble at best, with Wolf bringing up a pitifully inadequate rear guard.\\n\\n Three dull thumps in close succession announced the fact that the flying things had settled to earth. Jazz\u0027s fingers were fully alive now, deft where they hastened to free Zek\u0027s feet. She was panting, plainly terrified. \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 he kept whispering. \u0027Just one more knot to go.\u0027 Down the pass, maybe a hundred metres away, three anomalous shapes lay humped against a horizon of stars, with spatulate heads swaying at the ends of long necks. The last knot came loose; and as Zek came struggling to her feet, staggering a little, so Wolf\u0027s tail went down between his legs. He gave a whining, coughing little bark and began to back off toward the south.\\n\\n Jazz\u0027s arm was round Zek\u0027s waist, supporting her. He said: \u0027Move your arms, stamp your feet and get the blood pumping.\u0027 She didn\u0027t answer but stared with saucer eyes beyond him, in the direction of the grounded flying creatures. He sensed more than felt the shudder going through her, moving from her head, down through all her body. An entirely involuntary thing, almost like a dog shaking off water. Except Jazz suspected that this was something which wouldn\u0027t shake off. And he turned to follow her gaze.\\n\\n Three figures stood not ten paces away!\\n\\n They were in silhouette, but that hardly detracted from their awesome aura of presence. It radiated from them in almost tangible waves, a force warning of their near-invulnerability. They had all the advantages: they could see in the dark, were strong beyond the wildest dreams of most Earthly muscle-men, and they were armed. And not only with physical weapons, but also with the powers of the Wamphyri. Jazz didn\u0027t yet know about the latter, but Zek did.\\n\\n \u0027Try to avoid looking at their eyes,\u0027 she hissed her warning.\\n\\n The three were, or had been men, so much was plain.\\n\\n But they were big men, and even silhouetted against a backdrop of stars and black, nodding sky-beasts, Jazz could see what sort of men. In his mind a recurring picture of a man like these, dying in an inferno of heat and flame, screamed his fury and his defiance even now: \u0027Wamphyri!\u0027\\n\\n The one in the middle would be Shaithis; Jazz reckoned there\u0027d be close to eighty inches of him, standing almost a full head taller than the two who flanked him. He stood straight, cloaked, with his hair falling onto his shoulders. The proportions of his head were wrong; as he looked with quick, curious glances from side to side and showed his face in profile, Jazz saw the length of his skull and jaws, his convoluted snout, the alert mobility of his conch-like ears. It was a composite face: human-bat-wolf.\\n\\n The two beside him were near-naked; their bodies were pale in starlight, muscular, easy-flowing as liquid. They wore topknots with tails dangling, and on their right hands... those were silhouettes Jazz would know anywhere. The weapon-gloves of the Wamphyri! But so sure of themselves: they stood arms akimbo, almost uncaring, staring at Jazz and Zek with their red eyes almost as if they considered the antics of insects.\\n\\n \u0027Not bound!\u0027 Shaithis said in that unmistakable, rumbling voice of his. \u0027So either Arlek is a fool or you are extremely clever. But I see your broken thongs, and so I would say that you are clever. Your magic, of course. My magic, now!\u0027\\n\\n Jazz and Zek backed off a stumbling pace or two. The three moved after them, marginally more rapid but in no great hurry, gradually closing with them. Shaithis\u0027s lieutenants moved in the manner of men, with paces swift and sure; but their master seemed to flow forward, as if carried on the strength of his own will. His eyes were huge, crimson, seemed to burn with some weird, internal light of their own. It was hard to avoid looking into those eyes, Jazz thought. They might well be the gates of hell -but tell a moth not to investigate the candle\u0027s flame.\\n\\n Zek\u0027s elbow struck him sharply in the ribs. \u0027Don\u0027t look at their eyes!\u0027 she said again. \u0027Run, Jazz, if you can. I\u0027m all cramped, I\u0027ll only slow you down.\u0027\\n\\n Wolf came from nowhere, snarling his outrage - and probably his terror, too - as he loped from the shadows under the eastern cliff. He leaped at Shaithis\u0027s lieutenant on that flank; the man turned casually toward him, struck him aside left-handed as Jazz might strike aside a small, yapping dog. Wolf backed off, whined, and the man he\u0027d attacked showed him his gauntlet. \u0027Come on then, little wolf,\u0027 he taunted the animal. \u0027Come, let Gustan pat you on your sleek grey head!\u0027 \u0027Get back, Wolf!\u0027 Zek cried.\\n\\n \u0027Stand still.r Shaithis commanded, pointing at Jazz and Zek. \u0027I will not chase what is mine. Come to heel now or be punished. Punished severely!\u0027\\n\\n Jazz\u0027s heel kicked metal. Blued steel. His SMG! His packs were there, too.\\n\\n He fell to one knee, grabbed up the gun. The three who opposed him saw the weapon in his hand and came to a halt. They stood stock still, glaring with their red eyes. \u0027What?\u0027 Shaithis\u0027s voice was dangerously low. \u0027Do you threaten your master?\u0027\\n\\n Jazz faced the three where he kneeled; he groped blindly in a pack, then another. He found what he was looking for, slapped home a magazine into its housing. Shaithis came flowing forward. \u0027I said - \u0027 Threaten you?\u0027 Jazz cocked his gun. \u0027Damn right I do!\u0027 But the man on Shaithis\u0027s right flank had come swiftly forward in a crouch. His sandalled foot came down on Jazz\u0027s right wrist, pinning it to the ground. Jazz deliberately threw himself flat, tried to kick the man away; but this was no novice. Avoiding Jazz\u0027s kicks and still pinning his arm and weapon, he came to his knees, caught Jazz\u0027s face in a massive left hand, effortlessly bent his head back and showed him his raised gauntlet. He unclenched his fist and hooks, knives, gleaming sickles coldly reflected the starlight. Then the man smiled and raised his eyebrows in mocking query, glancing questioningly at Jazz\u0027s hand on the pistol-grip of the SMG. The gun\u0027s muzzle was sticking in dirt; Jazz daren\u0027t pull the trigger.\\n\\n He opened his hand and let go of the weapon, and the man who held him lifted him up from the ground by his crushed face. Jazz could do nothing; he felt that if Shaithis\u0027s lieutenant wanted to, he could just tear the flesh right off his skull like peeling an orange.\\n\\n Zek sprang at the man on Shaithis\u0027s left, Gustan, where he now stepped forward. \u0027Bullies!\u0027 she cried, beating at him with her fists. \u0027Bastards! Vampires!\u0027\\n\\n Gustan swept her up in one arm, grinned at her, ran his free left hand over her body, pinching here and there. \u0027You should let me have this one a little while, Lord Shaithis,\u0027 he grunted. \u0027Knock some sense into her and teach her the meaning of obedience!\u0027\\n\\n Shaithis turned on him at once. \u0027She\u0027ll be in thrall to me, and no other. Watch your tongue, Gustan! There\u0027s room in the pens for another war-beast, if that\u0027s your fancy?\u0027\\n\\n Gustan shrank back. \u0027I meant only - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Be quiet!\u0027 Shaithis cut him short. He came forward, sniffed at Zek and nodded his head. \u0027Yes, there\u0027s magic in this one. But remember - she escaped from the bitch Karen. Watch her carefully, Gustan.\u0027 Now he gazed at Jazz. \u0027As for you - \u0027 Again he thrust his convoluted snout forward, seemed to use it like some monstrous bloodhound. And his eyes narrowed to scarlet slits.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s a great magician!\u0027 Zek cried. She hung dangling in Gustan\u0027s arms.\\n\\n \u0027Indeed?\u0027 Shaithis glanced at her. \u0027And what, pray, is his talent? For I sense nothing of magic in him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I ... I read the future,\u0027 Jazz gasped from a crushed, O-shaped mouth.\\n\\n Shaithis smiled a terrible smile. \u0027Good, for I have certainly read yours.\u0027 And he nodded to the man who held Jazz aloft.\\n\\n \u0027Wait!\u0027 Zek cried. \u0027It\u0027s true, I tell you! You\u0027ll lose a powerful ally if you kill him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An ally?\u0027 Shaithis seemed amused. \u0027A servant, perhaps.\u0027 He stroked his chin. \u0027But very well, let us test this talent. Put him down.\u0027 Jazz was lowered until he stood on straining tip-toes.\\n\\n Shaithis studied him closely, cocked his head on one side, thought of a suitable test. \u0027Now tell me,\u0027 he finally said, \u0027what you read in my future, hell-lander?\u0027\\n\\n Jazz knew he was finished, but there was still Zek to consider. \u0027I\u0027ll tell you this much,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Harm this woman in any way - one hair of her head - and you\u0027ll burn in hell. The sun shall surely rise on you, Shaithis of the Wamphyri!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That is not fortune-telling but wishful thinking!\u0027 Shaithis snapped. \u0027Do you think to lay a curse on me? What, I am not to harm a hair of her head? This head, do you mean?\u0027 He reached out and grasped Zek\u0027s blonde hair, bunched it in a knot, tightened his grip until she cried out.\\n\\n And the sun at once rose in the pass through the mountains, and lit the place with its burning, lancing rays!\\n\\n Before the man who held Jazz screamed in terror and hurled him away like a rag doll, the Englishman thought an entirely frivolous thought: \u0027Now that\u0027s what I call magic!\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-12.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
