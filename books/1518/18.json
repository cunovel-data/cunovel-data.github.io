A few birds sang hushed, warbling songs in the grass of the plain; the mountains marched cold on the right flank, dark in their forested roots and gold on their snow-spiked peaks; the tribe of Lardis the Traveller moved silently, no words spoken, with only their natural jingle, the creaking of their caravans and rustle of travois to tell that they were there at all in the shadows of the woods where they skirted the barrier mountains.\\n\\n It was colder, too, and a racing moon sailed like a pale, far-flung coin on high, calling to the wild wolves of the peaks, whose answering calls echoed down with an eerie foreboding. The sun was a sliver of gold in the south, gleaming faintly far beyond the plain and silvering the coils of winding rivers.\\n\\n Only Michael J. Simmons and Zekintha Foener spoke, because they were hell-landers and knew no better. But even their speech was hushed. It would soon be sundown, which was not a time for making loud noises. Even strangers could sense that much.\\n\\n Jazz had built a light-framed travois; he hauled their kit bundled up in skins, carried only his SMG strapped across his back. Zek helped as best she could where the going was rough, but in the main he was well able to manage on his own. In just a few days his trained physique had attained new heights of strength and endurance.\\n\\n A few miles back they\u0027d picked up the main Traveller party and now Lardis\u0027s tribe was complete. Now, too, the sanctuary outcrop was only a short distance ahead; already its dome was visible, with the sun gleaming on it like some great, fleshless, yellowed skull in the middle distance. From here on, as they went, the Gypsies would cover their tracks, leave no sign to tell that they\u0027d come this way. Oh, the Wamphyri knew their hiding holes well enough, but even so they didn\u0027t care to advertise their presence here.\\n\\n A few minutes ago Lardis had toiled up alongside Jazz and Zek, said: \u0027Jazz, when the tribe\u0027s in and settled down, then meet me at the main entrance. Myself and three or four of the lads, we\u0027ll have a go at learning how to use these weapons of yours. The flame-engine, and your guns.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And the grenades?\u0027 Jazz had paused for a moment, wiped his sweating brow.\\n\\n \u0027Eh? Ah, yes!\u0027 Lardis grinned. \u0027But bigger fish next time, eh?\u0027 The grin had fallen from his face in a moment. \u0027Let\u0027s hope we don\u0027t have to use them - any of them. But if we do - the silver-tipped bolts of our crossbows, sharpened staves which we\u0027ve got cached away in the caves, our swords of silver which are likewise hidden, combined with your weapons ... if it\u0027s our turn to go, at least we\u0027ll go fighting.\u0027\\n\\n Then Zek had spoken up: \u0027That\u0027s gloomy talk, Lardis Lidesci. Is something bothering you? We\u0027ve just one more sundown ahead of us, and before the next one we\u0027ll be meeting up with the Dweller. That\u0027s what you promised your people. Surely all\u0027s gone well so far?\u0027\\n\\n He\u0027d nodded. \u0027So far, aye. But the Lord Shaithis has a score to settle. There was no bad blood before. It was the old game of wolf and chicken, as always. But now the chicken has clawed the wolf\u0027s nose. He\u0027s not just curious or greedy any more, he\u0027s angry! Also - \u0027 and he\u0027d closed his mouth and shrugged.\\n\\n Tell us the worst of it, Lardis,\u0027 Jazz had urged him. \u0027What\u0027s on your mind?\u0027\\n\\n Again Lardis\u0027s shrug. \u0027I don\u0027t know - maybe it\u0027s nothing. Or maybe it\u0027s several small things. But there\u0027s a mist back there, and that\u0027s something I don\u0027t like for a start!\u0027 He\u0027d pointed back the way they\u0027d come. In the distance, to the east, a wall of grey mist rolled down from the mountains, coiled itself shallowly on the forests. It swirled and eddied, lapping like a slow tide over the foothills. The Wamphyri have a way with mists,\u0027 Lardis had continued. \u0027We\u0027re not the only ones who cover our tracks...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it\u0027s still sunup!\u0027 Jazz had protested.\\n\\n \u0027In a very little while it will be sundown!\u0027 Lardis had snapped. \u0027And the great pass has been in darkness for a long time now. Here in the lee of these forests, there\u0027s shade aplenty.\u0027\\n\\n Zek\u0027s hand had flown to her mouth. \u0027You think Shaithis is coming? But I\u0027ve sensed nothing. I\u0027ve been scanning constantly but I\u0027ve read no alien thoughts.\u0027\\n\\n Lardis had breathed deeply, more a sigh. That\u0027s reassuring, anyway. And if he is coming, we\u0027ll meet on our terms at least.\u0027 He\u0027d glanced up into the mountains. \u0027But the wolves were howling, and now they\u0027ve stopped. And our own animals are quiet, too. See - only look at Wolf, there!\u0027 Zek\u0027s great wolf loped a little way apart; his ears were flat and his tail brushed the rough ground. Every now and then he\u0027d pause and look back, and whine a little.\\n\\n Jazz and Zek had looked at each other, then at Lardis. \u0027But maybe it\u0027s nothing,\u0027 the Gypsy leader had grunted. And with another shrug he\u0027d gone on ahead.\\n\\n \u0027What do you make of all that?\u0027 Jazz now asked Zek, his tone soft.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Maybe it\u0027s just as he said. Anyway, the closer we get to sundown, the more nervy everyone becomes. There\u0027s nothing new in that. The Travellers don\u0027t like mists, and they like their animals frisky. Anything else is a bad sign. The current mood: it\u0027s just a combination of things, that\u0027s all.\u0027 For all her brave explanation, she hugged herself and shivered.\\n\\n \u0027Ever the optimist?\u0027 Jazz\u0027s smile was uncertain.\\n\\n \u0027Because I\u0027ve come through a lot,\u0027 she was quick to answer. \u0027And because we\u0027re so close to the end now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, you have been through a lot.\u0027 Jazz began hauling the travois again. \u0027And come to think of it, you never did get round to telling me how come the Lady Karen let you go.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve been busy,\u0027 she shrugged. \u0027Do you still want to hear it?\u0027 Suddenly the idea appealed to her. Maybe talking would calm her own nerves a little.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Jazz said, \u0027but first there are a couple of other things that have been bothering me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anachronisms,\u0027 he nodded. \u0027The Gypsies, this Romance-language tongue of theirs, their metal working. Unless there\u0027s a lot of this planet I don\u0027t know about -and I can\u0027t see how that can be, for one side\u0027s hot enough to fry eggs and the other would freeze you stiff - then these things I\u0027ve mentioned are anachronisms. This world is ... well, it\u0027s primitive! But there are paradoxes. Some of the things in this world ... by comparison they\u0027re high-tech!\u0027\\n\\n Zek\u0027s turn to nod. \u0027I know,\u0027 she said, \u0027and I\u0027ve thought about it. If you talk to the Travellers about their history, their legends, as I have done, you might find an explanation. Something of one, anyway. According to immemorial sources, their world wasn\u0027t always like this. Wamphyri legends bear the Traveller myths out, incidentally.\u0027\\n\\n Jazz was interested. \u0027Go on,\u0027 he said. \u0027You talk and I\u0027ll save my breath for hauling.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, the Traveller legends have it that once upon a time this planet was fertile in almost every region, with oceans, ice-caps, jungles and plains: much like Earth; in fact. And it teemed with people. Oh, it had its vampire swamps, too, but they weren\u0027t so active in those days. People knew about them and shunned them; local communities drew boundaries and patrolled them. Nothing living was ever allowed out. Vampirism was treated like rabies, the only difference being that if a man was ever vampirized they didn\u0027t attempt a cure. There is no cure. So they\u0027d simply stake him out and... you know the way it goes...\\n\\n \u0027But in the main the vampires were kept down, and in those days there were no Wamphyri. The people weren\u0027t migratory; they had nothing to fear and so nothing to run from; their systems were mainly barter, less frequently feudal.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, as far as I can make out they were maybe three to four hundred years behind us. There were big differences, of course: they hadn\u0027t discovered gunpowder, for one thing. Also, while they\u0027d developed a complex language, they still hadn\u0027t made much effort to get it down on paper - or on skins. That\u0027s why most of this has had to come down by word of mouth, from one generation to the next. Of course, you can get big distortions that way: some unimportant things get exaggerated while others of real importance are lost entirely. For example, the heroes in the Traveller myths are all giants, who eat vampires for breakfast and don\u0027t even get a stomach ache! But no one remembers who developed the metalworking skills, designed the first caravan, made the first crossbow.\\n\\n \u0027So that was the way this world was: like ours maybe three or four hundred years ago, but in many ways less dangerous, less warlike, less noisy. Mainly people lived in peace with each other, and apart from small territorial disputes they were left alone to farm, fish, and trade off anything extra which they managed to produce. There have been plenty of worse places, and worse times, in our own world.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, and perhaps I should mention: in that bygone time the world did have proper seasons, shorter days and nights, again pretty similar to our own planet. But then -\\n\\n Then something happened.\\n\\n \u0027According to the Traveller legend, a \"white sun\" appeared in the night sky. It came through the heavens so fast it looked like a bar of fire; it glanced off the moon, speared down and blazed across the surface of the world! As it fell so it shrank, until finally it skimmed across the land in a huge ball of fire, like a flat stone bouncing on water, and came to rest back there beyond the mountains.\\n\\n \u0027But though it was small, this \"white sun\", its magic was enormous. It speeded up the moon in its orbit, changed the world\u0027s axis, brought into being geological stresses of awesome magnitude. It created these mountains, the frozen lands to the north, the deserts of the south. And for a thousand years after its coming, the surface of this world was more like hell than the friendly place it had been.\\n\\n The seasons were gone forever, the moon was now a demon flyer that called to the wolves, an estimated quarter-billion people were reduced to a few thousand. The continents had changed, mountains disappeared from where they\u0027d been, were forced up elsewhere; the survivors went through a nightmare of tidal waves, storms, volcanic upheavals - you name it. But they learned to live with it, and eventually the world settled down. Except that now there was a Starside and a Sunside.\\n\\n \u0027Centuries passed. Who knows how many? Far Sunside became a desert, and Starside... well, you\u0027ve seen it. Only the mountains and their Sunside foothills could support human life as we know it. People had settled there, started to rebuild, however slowly, crudely. They remembered a few of their skills, used them to start afresh. And meanwhile the swamps, mainly unchanged, had re-stocked with evil vampiric life...\\n\\n \u0027Explorers went over the mountains, through the passes, saw the frozen wastes beyond. Torrential rains, the howling elements and glacial ice had carved mighty stacks from the mountain flanks, but the land was all but barren. Men couldn\u0027t live there. Men, mind you...\\n\\n Then there came the plague - a plague of vampires!\\n\\n The swamps overflowed with the damned things. They infested men and animals in unprecedented numbers. Bands of vampirized men roamed on Sunside, murdering by night and crawling into holes during the interminable days. Reduced to near-savagery by Nature\u0027s disaster, now this un-natural disaster reduced people further still. Then the tribes rallied, began hunting vampires, killed them as they had in the old days. They used the stake, the sword, fire; they dragged vampires screaming into the open, pinned them down for the sun to fry.\\n\\n \u0027Finally Sunside was safe again; the swamps became more or less quiescent; the plague was under control. But vampirized men had been driven north through the great pass. Long-lived, they fought with each other for the blood which sustains them. They discovered and lived off the troglodytes in their deep caverns on Starside. Then, as they started to inhabit the stacks, so they became the \"Lords\" of that dark hemisphere. They built their aeries, called themselves Wamphyri; and with the intelligence of men and the drive of the vampires within them, so at last they began to raid on Sunside. The people they victimized survived by becoming Travellers, and they\u0027re still travelling. That\u0027s the whole story\\n\\n \u0027This \"white sun\",\u0027 Jazz said after a while. \u0027Are we talking about the sphere - the Gate - whatever?\u0027\\n\\n Zek shrugged. \u0027I imagine so. It\u0027s a space-time gate, right? Not only a distortion of space but a bridge across time, too. Is it possible that what appeared here thousands of years ago was caused by the Perchorsk accident, and that the two are linked through the sphere? An anachronism, as you say.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what the hell was - is - it?\u0027 Jazz frowned. \u0027Back at Perchorsk there was talk of black, white, even grey holes. And you said it tied in with Wamphyri legends, too. How do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n The Wamphyri legends have it that the \"white sun\" came from hell - or a place that was hell to them, anyway. In other words, a world where the killing sun was a constant factor, a regularly recurring nightmare from which there was only brief surcease. Up until a time only a few years ago, the sphere we came through from Perchorsk out onto the plain of boulders on Starside was buried. It used to lie at the bottom of its crater, where only its upper surface was visible, beaming its white light up into the sky like a searchlight. It was maybe fifteen to twenty feet deep, surrounded by the crater wall. I had all of this from Karen.\\n\\n \u0027But just two years ago our time - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027At the time of the Perchorsk accident?\u0027 Jazz was quick to note.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Zek nodded, \u0027I suppose so. Anyway, that was when a change took place. During sunup, when the Wamphyri stick close to their stacks, the sphere apparently elevated itself up from the bed of its crater until it was positioned as it is now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Explanation?\u0027\\n\\n Zek\u0027s shrug. \u0027I certainly don\u0027t have one. But the Wamphyri saw it as an omen. Their myths have it that any change in the sphere - the gate to the hell-lands - is portentous of great changes in general. Changes they themselves might instigate.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Such as?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, for a long time now they\u0027ve talked of joining forces and waging war on the Dweller. If they could put aside their own petty squabbles long enough, maybe they\u0027d do that. Also, we were something of a change in ourselves. When Chingiz Khuv started sending political prisoners and other \"undesirables\" through the Gate as a series of experiments ... it was the first time that the Wamphyri had proof that the hitherto half-mythical hell-lands were real!\u0027\\n\\n Jazz was frowning, chewing his lip. \u0027Something\u0027s wrong here,\u0027 he said. \u0027If the recent Perchorsk accident in our world caused the \"white sun\" effect thousands of years ago in this one, why didn\u0027t we appear through the Gate all that time ago? Another anachronism? A space-time paradox? I don\u0027t buy it. It doesn\u0027t ring true. Now tell me this: how long have the Wamphyri been using the Gate as a punishment? When did they first start sending transgressors through it?\u0027\\n\\n Zek glanced at him. \u0027Why do you ask?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just a thought.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, as far as I\u0027m aware, they\u0027ve been doing it right through their history, for thousands of years.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027See what I mean?\u0027 Jazz was sure this was important. \u0027Up until the time I left Perchorsk there had only been a handful of \"encounters\" - of which only one was, or had been, a man. A creature of the Wamphyri, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n Zek shook her head. \u0027No, he was true Wamphyri, that one. He was Lesk the Glut\u0027s heir, Klaus Desculu. He had Lesk\u0027s egg, but instead of going off and finding or stealing a stack of his own, he tried to usurp his father, Lesk The Glut is insane; even the Wamphyri recognize that fact, that Lesk the Glut is not responsible. His passions are enormous! He brought Klaus to heel, punished him for ten years - submitted him to incredible cruelties - then banished him through the Gate. He was the one they hosed with liquid fire on the walkway. But I see what you mean. If the Wamphyri have been sending their malefactors through the Gate throughout their history, where have they been going? Not to Perchorsk, obviously, for Perchorsk didn\u0027t exist then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Coming this way,\u0027 Jazz mused, \u0027from Perchorsk to here, there\u0027s only one exit - onto the boulder plain on Starside. But going the other way ... is there more than one exit into our world? One at Perchorsk and another somewhere else?\u0027\\n\\n It was Zek\u0027s turn to be excited. \u0027I\u0027ve wondered about that,\u0027 she said. \u0027And it might explain away certain other things which have puzzled me - and you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh?\u0027\\n\\n She nodded. \u0027For instance, how is it that the Traveller tongue is so close to the Romanian of our world? And for that matter, how are the Gypsies themselves so close? What do you know of Earth\u0027s languages, Jazz? Our Earth, of course? It\u0027s obvious that you\u0027re something of a linguist.\u0027\\n\\n He smiled. \u0027What do I know about Earth languages? Quite a lot, actually. I have qualifications in Russian. My father was a Russian. The Slavonic languages, yes, and something of the Romance tongues, too. That\u0027s how I picked up the Traveller patois so quickly. Why do you ask?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A theory of mine,\u0027 she answered. \u0027My own knack with languages comes from my telepathy. Languages are easy if you\u0027ve a rapport with your subject\u0027s mind. But the connection between the Traveller tongue and Romanian seemed so obvious to me. And of course the Wamphyri have the same tongue...\u0027\\n\\n Jazz saw what she was getting at and drew breath in a hiss. \u0027The banished Wamphyri took their language with them into our world!\u0027 he said. \u0027Zek, that\u0027s clever! But - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s to suppose that the Latin tongues originated here, not in our world.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s my theory, yes. I also believe that some of those ancient, banished Wamphyri took their followers with them. The Szgany, Zingaro, Zigeuner: the Gypsy!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Romance tongues spread outwards from Russia?\u0027 Jazz looked puzzled. \u0027I can\u0027t see that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who mentioned Russia?\u0027 she answered. \u0027If there is more than one exit in our world, why must they all be in Russia?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Romania?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That would be my bet, yes. Ask yourself this: where did the vampire legend arise from in our world? Where does it have its roots?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In Romania, of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And which nation has retained its own language almost entirely intact since time immemorial, despite being surrounded by countries with little or no linguistic relationship? Like Hungarian and the Slavonic tongues?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 he nodded. \u0027By periodic injections of vampires and their followers, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s possible.\u0027\\n\\n Jazz began to get hooked on the idea. \u0027The more I think of it the more plausible it seems,\u0027 he finally said. The first Wamphyri migrated (were banished) to our world many thousands of years ago. They took their followers and their language with them: the Gypsies and their tongue, which is a form of Latin. They spread outward from Romania into all the lands around, but their heartland was Romania itself. Despite being conquered by Avars, Magyars, Goths, Gepidae and what have you, the language could only be diluted, not eradicated; for when the conquerors moved on there would always be new arrivals from this side of the Gate to reinforce the watered-down tongue. It explains why Romania is so isolated in its use of a Romance language. And as you say, it gives a real basis for Earth\u0027s vampire legends. But weren\u0027t Gypsies supposed to have come out of India? The Karakoram mountains?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe the first of them through the Gate went to India,\u0027 Zek answered. \u0027Why not? They\u0027re travellers, aren\u0027t they? And from there they spread themselves throughout the world. Their urge to travel is simple to explain: it had been bred into them by the Wamphyri for so many hundreds of years...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So to sum up,\u0027 Jazz said, \u0027what you\u0027re saying is this: that there\u0027s another Gate somewhere in Romania, through which the Wamphyri have been arriving in our world for millennia?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Never a great many of them,\u0027 she answered. \u0027But yes, that seems to be our conclusion. I hinted at it and you worked it out for yourself. It\u0027s plausible, as you said.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why doesn\u0027t anyone know about this Romanian Gate? I mean, a thing like the shining sphere isn\u0027t likely to remain obscure for very long, now is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ask me another,\u0027 said Zek, with another shrug. \u0027But from what we know of the Dweller, he certainly seems to have access to our world. And if he doesn\u0027t use the Perchorsk Gate -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which Gate does he use?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly.\u0027\\n\\n After a little while, Jazz said: \u0027We\u0027ve covered a lot of ground. So now, before I get too confused, let\u0027s go on to something else.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like why Karen set me free?\u0027 \u0027If you don\u0027t mind.\u0027 \u0027Very well, it was like this:\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know how long I stayed in the Lady Karen\u0027s aerie. Time seems suspended in such places, numbed by horror. Not interminably lengthened, however, because so much of one\u0027s time is spent asleep - exhausted! To live in such a place drains a person, physically and mentally. Menace seems to lurk even where there is none; nerves stretch to breaking; massive as even the smallest room is, still the feeling is claustrophobic. Silent for hours, then ringing with the laughter of the Wamphyri, or perhaps reverberating with screams of direst agony, an aerie is like Satan\u0027s antechamber.\\n\\n \u0027And yet the Lady Karen became my friend, or as much a friend as any human being could ever hope to find in a vampire!\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps that\u0027s not so hard to understand. She had been a simple Traveller girl. She remembered her previous life, knew the horror of her present circumstances, foresaw a future more monstrous yet. She had been a striking beauty in her tribe, and I myself was not without good looks. She found a kinship with me, read in my predicament echoes of her own. Also, she knew her vampire must soon take ascendancy. When it did ... her actions would no longer be entirely her actions.\\n\\n \u0027If she hadn\u0027t been female - if this aerie had been that of one of the Lords - then things would have been very different. I wouldn\u0027t have been here telling the story now. Can you imagine what it means to be loved, physically loved, by one of the Wamphyri? \"Love\" in the spiritual meaning of the word isn\u0027t part of their language, but in the physical...\\n\\n \u0027When a vampire takes a woman for his pleasure, Jazz - not for food, but for sex pure and simple - well, it cannot be pure and it is never simple! The things lovers do ... nothing is forbidden between a woman and a man in love. But between a vampire and a woman, or between - a female vampire and a man? They are powerful creatures! You have heard that old saying \"a fate worse than death\"? Ridiculous, for what could be worse than death? But there, I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t have to describe it.\\n\\n \u0027But Karen was entirely woman, and her female elements were emphasized by her parasite. There was nothing of the lesbian in her - not yet, anyway, though God only knows what she would be like later. So I don\u0027t suppose the thought of me as a sexual diversion even occurred to her. Not for herself, anyway.\\n\\n \u0027But her lieutenants, they wanted me.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, they had their own women - stolen Traveller girls - but they were dark and I was fair. My colours were so rare as to be almost unheard of. And I was a hell-lander. Better still, I could steal thoughts. Now, the true Wamphyri, born of a vampire egg, has a degree of telepathy -but their lesser creatures do not. Not unless such is deliberately bred into them or gifted to them by their masters. And so, all in all, I would make a highly desirable property. Karen feared that when the vampire in her was fully mature, then she\u0027d lose what small degree of compassion remained in her. Following which my future would become that much more unreliable, my unspeakable fate that much more certain. She did not want that for me.\\n\\n \u0027One day she said to me: \"Zekintha, there is something you can do for me; when it is done, if it is done well, then I shall take you to Sunside and leave you there for the Travellers to find. I see no reason why you should become what I have become, what I am still to become.\u0027\\n\\n \"You offer me a way out of this place?\" I answered. \"Only tell me what I have to do.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a truce,\" she said. \"The Wamphyri have called a meeting. All the Lords shall gather in one place, under their many banners, to see if they can find common ground in a certain cause. Now, can you guess where they\u0027ll gather?\"\\n\\n \u0027\"Here?\"\\n\\n \u0027\"Indeed! In the aerie of Karen. That in itself- that they wish to hold their talks here - seems to me a highly suspicious thing. A very inauspicious thing. However, I shall make provisions. Now, what are your thoughts so far?\"\\n\\n \u0027\"I know only what you have told me of these Lords, Lady,\" I answered. \"Which is to say that I fear them greatly! I think that if you let the Lords Shaithis, Lesk, Lascula and the others into your castle, then you\u0027ll lose it. Of all the stacks, this one of yours holds a prime position, Karen, and they covet it. They know, too, that you have me here, and that I have magic. I am therefore desirable. Your warrior creatures would pass down to him who killed you, and they are the finest warriors of all, for none could make warriors like Dramal Doombody. These are your own words, which I repeat to you. But if your castle and your beasts and I myself am desirable, you are more desirable still, Karen. They would make fine sport with you - with both of us - before making an end of it. But you are Wamphyri! You would last so much longer than me, and suffer so much more.\"\\n\\n \u0027\"Are you finished?\"\\n\\n \u0027\"For now.\"\\n\\n \"Normally I would agree with you in everything you\u0027ve said, but there are always two ways of looking at things. For instance, perhaps there is nothing inimical in this -not immediately, anyway. At least admit this: that if the Lords are to meet, then they need neutral ground on which to do it, even if it is only to agree to disagree! This would be the ideal spot, for they don\u0027t consider me their equal; I am merely renting them a room. Also, I said I would make conditions; by which I meant that I will take precautions against treachery. One: they must come alone, without their lieutenants. That shall be the first proviso. Two: no gauntlets.\"\\n\\n \u0027\"What?\" I was amazed. \"But, Lady, will they heed you? I mean, you really intend to order them to leave their battle-gauntlets behind?\"\\n\\n \u0027\"For their own protection!\" she smiled her half-human smile. \"So that they will not be tempted to brawl among themselves if their talks get heated. So ... no gauntlets -or no admittance. Oh, they\u0027ll agree, for they\u0027re eager to get this thing underway.\\n\\n \u0027\"And finally, three: the meeting shall be right here in these chambers - this very hall - with one of my own warrior creatures in each corner. Stalemate! if they attempt any... act, against me, then my creatures will attack! Remember, Zekintha, that for all his strength and his powers, a vampire is only flesh and blood. He will die in the right circumstances, under the correct conditions. And melting in the stomach-acids of a warrior is one such condition. On the other hand, the Lords will know that if I call upon my creatures without provocation, then they shall have the right to deal with me in their way: a stave through my body, decapitation, a bath full of blazing oil! As I said: stalemate. Now what do you say?\"\\n\\n \"I still find it fraught.\"\\n\\n \"So do I, but it\u0027s done. And I may even profit from it. Now look there - \"\\n\\n \u0027Through a window the mountains were blackly silhouetted where a fan of golden sunlight faded behind them in the southern sky. \"Sundown,\" I said. \"Soon...\"\\n\\n \"Aye, soon,\" she echoed me. \"When there\u0027s a pink rim all along those peaks, then they stir, mount their beasts, glide from stack to stack. They land in the launching levels below, proceed on foot upward through the body of the stack. One at a time, they shall come. My table shall bear... unconventional dishes. Suckling wolf in pepper, hearts of great bats floating in their blood, but blackened by the use of herbs, grassland game from Sunside, and weak mushroom ales from the trog caverns. Nothing to inflame their passions.\"\\n\\n \u0027\"But what is your purpose, Lady?\" I was curious -terrified, but curious. \"I know you wish nothing to do with these Lords. I know that you are... not like them. Could you not refuse them outright? Is there no other place suitable for them to hold their meeting?\"\\n\\n \u0027\"Most of these men,\" she answered thoughtfully, \"have never before set foot in Dramal Doombody\u0027s aerie - my aerie, now. I think Shaithis was a visitor, once or twice, in Dramal\u0027s youth when they had something in common. They used to hunt women together at sundown on Sunside, just the two of them. Not so much a friendship as a rivalry. But for the others it\u0027s an opportunity to see what I\u0027ve got here. I know that they\u0027d use the visit to study my defences against some future invasion. But if I turned down their request, refused to offer them my ... hospitality, that would only provoke them, unite them against me.\"\\n\\n \"You said you might even profit from their coming,\" I reminded her. \"In what way, profit?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes. And that\u0027s where you come in,\" she answered. \"We Wamphyri have powers, Zekintha. You are not alone; I, too, have the ability to steal the thoughts of others. It is of course a talent of my vampire, transferring to me. As yet, however, the art is undeveloped, dubious at best. I can\u0027t always be sure that I read aright, and over any great distance it is not worth the effort. Also, because I am Wamphyri, they would know if I probed too deeply. Our vampire minds are similar, do you see? But you are not Wamphyri ...\"\\n\\n \"You want me to listen to their thoughts? And if they should discover me?\"\\n\\n \"They will expect to discover you! What profit in owning a thought-stealer and letting her talent go to waste? But the trick is this: to sneak into their minds without them knowing, with your guard up lest they read yours! Discover you mentally? Possibly; but no real danger, as I\u0027ve said, for they\u0027d expect as much. But they will not discover you physically for we shall hide you in a secure place. And these are the things I shall desire to know:\\n\\n \"Their thoughts and plans concerning myself; whether their meeting here is entirely genuine or simply a ploy to seek out my weaknesses; their weaknesses, their uncertainties, if they have any. Look into each of their minds in turn, and see what you can see. Except I\u0027d caution you: don\u0027t bother with Lesk the Glut. His brain is addled. His vampire is itself mad. How may one discover truth in a mind as mercurial as that? What? - he cannot make sense of his own thoughts, not from one moment to the next! But he has a strong aerie, and his strength is prodigious, else the others would have dealt with him long ago.\"\\n\\n \u0027 \"I shall do my best,\" I told her. \"But as yet you haven\u0027t explained the point of this meeting. What is it that brings them together like this?\"\\n\\n \u0027 \"The one they call The-Dweller-in-His-Garden-in-the-West,\" she answered. \"They fear him. Him and his alchemies, his magics. And because they fear him they hate him! He dares set up his home there in the western peaks, midway between Star- and Sunside, without so much as a by-your-leave! He harbours Travellers, too, and instructs them in his weird ways. And any who dare go against him ... ah, but they have tales to tell!\"\\n\\n \u0027\"And shall you, too, set yourself against this Dweller?\" I asked her.\\n\\n \u0027She looked at me with those blood-hued eyes of hers. \"We shall see what we shall see,\" she said. \"Now go, sleep, rest your mind. Prepare yourself. When it is time I shall come for you, show you your hiding place. Do well, and I shall keep my promise.\"\\n\\n \u0027\"I won\u0027t fail you,\" I told her, and went off to my bedchamber. But sleep was a long time in coming...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then it was sundown. I started awake, heard Karen\u0027s footsteps. And she was hurrying!\\n\\n \"Come!\" she said, taking my hand. That unnatural strength was in her fingers where they drew me up from my bed. \"Dress - and quickly! The first of them comes.\"\\n\\n \u0027Vampirized Travellers - slaves, leeched to death and returned from that condition by reason of their converted physiologies, their altered organs and functions - had prepared the great hall. The table had been laid, and at one end had been placed the mighty bone-throne of Dramal Doombody. Raised up on a shallow platform, it seemed to yawn down the great length of the table.\\n\\n \"There,\" said Karen. \"Your hiding place - within Dramal\u0027s great chair!\"\\n\\n \u0027I might have protested, but she foresaw it, stilled my babble before it could pour out:\\n\\n \"Have done! None shall sit upon the throne of Dramal. I do this to honour the leper Lord, my father and master, whose egg is in me. Hah! So they shall suppose, anyway. Myself, I take the great chair at the other end of the table. Between us they are trapped! Their thoughts, at least. Too late now to make other arrangements. I\u0027ll brook no argument. Proceed with your part of our plan or get out. And I mean get out! If you\u0027re not with me you\u0027re against me. Find yourself new chambers within the aerie, or escape from it if you can. I shall not hinder you - but I can\u0027t say as much for the others.\"\\n\\n \u0027She knew I couldn\u0027t refuse; her vampire was stirring in her, aroused by her excitement. Useless - indeed dangerous - to try to dissuade her when she was like this. I went to the bone-throne.\\n\\n \u0027God, what a monstrous chair that was!\\n\\n \u0027It was a cartilage creature\u0027s lower jawbone, as I have said. Perhaps five feet long, the eye-teeth formed hand grips at the front, so that the user\u0027s arms would rest along the shining white cartilage ridges which in our jaws house our side or back teeth. Toward the rear of the jaw its sides rose up steeply to the hinge, but of course the upper half was not there. The flat, steep slope at the back of the jaw formed the chair\u0027s backrest, against which was normally set a massive red-tasselled cushion. At front and back, the four corners, knobs of cartilage protruded downward, making perfectly symmetrical feet; the whole piece had been intricately carved and arabesqued, like an enormous ivory. And like ivory, it too had once known life - of a sort. Entire, it stood upon its own small stage, beneath which was my hiding hole. I must crawl in from behind, where once had been the trachea, then sit up inside. In there I found a large cushion; I could sit there as in a canoe, upright, with my head and shoulders protruding through into the cavity under the jaw, and look out through the arabesques so artfully cut in the bone. The great red cushion would not obstruct my view for Karen had had it removed, so that I could view at will every face at the table. It\u0027s far easier to know a man\u0027s thoughts when you can see his face.\\n\\n \u0027And so they began to arrive.\\n\\n \u0027As they came I read their names in Karen\u0027s mind.\\n\\n They communicated briefly, mentally, in the fashion of the Wamphyri, exchanging names and boasts. First was Grigis, the least of the Wamphyri Lords. He made out it was a matter of priorities, but plainly he had been sent to test the way.\\n\\n \"\u0027Grigis is here,\" he sent, as he appeared from the stairwell. \"\u0027The Wamphyri honour me, Lady, as you see. My stature is such that I am first-chosen to enter your aerie. Alas, I see warriors there, all about the room. What is this for a greeting?\"\\n\\n \u0027\"For your protection, Grigis,\" she told him. \"And for mine. When heads as great as ours meet, they might clash! But for now consider the warriors as decoration, a symbol of Wamphyri power. They have no instructions. While we and the other Lords are still, they shall be still. And now, welcome to my manse. You have entered of your own free will, and I freely welcome you. Be seated. The others are not far behind.\"\\n\\n \u0027Grigis strode to a window, leaned out and made a sign. It was dark, of course, but that is nothing to the Wamphyri. I read in Karen\u0027s mind how a second flyer, warily circling, at once turned inward and sped for the launching levels. Then Grigis took his seat, on one side of the table and well away from the bone-throne. Grigis was of course true Wamphyri and awesome in aspect, but he was nothing special among the Lords; pointless to describe him further.\\n\\n \u0027So the arrivals proceeded: many lesser lights, but here and there a power among them. Menor Maimbite was one such. His blazon was a splintered skull between a pair of grinding jaws. Allegedly immune to kneblasch and silver, Menor was known on occasions like this to carry a small pepperbox of these poisons, with which to flavour his food. His head and the gape of his jaws were enormous even for a Lord.\\n\\n \u0027But after a dozen of them were in, welcomed, seated, and while they fidgeted and muttered low among themselves, then the mightiest of them began to show. Fess Ferenc, who stood eight and a half feet tall and needed no gauntlet, for his hands were talons; Belath, whose eyes were ever slitted, set in a fleshless face never known to smile, whose mind was cloudy and cloaked and totally unreadable; Volse Pinescu, who deliberately fostered running sores and festoons of boils all over his face and body, so that his aspect would be that much more monstrous; and Lesk the Glut, who, it was legended, in an attack of his madness, commanded one of his own warriors to fight him to the death! The story went that he\u0027d got under the thing\u0027s scales where it couldn\u0027t reach him, eaten his way into its brain and so crippled it. But as Lesk left its skull through a nostril, so in a convulsion the beast had snapped at him. He lost an eye and half of his face, where now he wore a huge leather patch stitched to his jaw and temple. But to replace the missing eye, he had grown one on his left shoulder, which he kept bare, wearing his cloak thrown over the right. Lesk took a seat on the left, right next to my hiding place in the bone-throne, which caused me to tremble violently. But I managed to control it.\\n\\n \u0027Next to last came Lascula Longtooth, who had so refined and concentrated his metamorphic powers that he could lengthen his jaws and teeth at will, on the spur of the moment, which he was wont to do habitually, like a man scratching his chin. And last of all was Shaithis, whose stack was a fortress impenetrable, whose legends were such as needed no embroidery. Of them all, he might appear one of the least imposing. But his mind was ice, and every move he made, had made or would ever make was calculated to an inch. The Wamphyri might not greatly respect each other, but every one of them respected Shaithis...\\n\\n \u0027I had wondered at Karen\u0027s dress - or lack of it. If I\u0027d been in her position, unwilling hostess to these monsters, I would certainly have buried myself in clothing, even in armour! She wore a sheath of a gown; it was of a white material so fine and clinging that every ripple of her flesh was visible. Her left breast - and she had beautiful breasts - was bare; her right buttock, too, or very nearly; with no undergarments the effect was shattering. But as the Lords had arrived, so her purpose became clear. Instead of casting about with their eyes and minds, all thoughts had immediately centred on Karen.\\n\\n \u0027Remember: these had been men before they were Wamphyri. Their lusts, however magnified, were the lusts of men. All of them, at first sight, lusted after Karen, which kept their minds from more devious work. I\u0027ll not mention the things I read in their vampire-ridden minds; as for Lesk the Glut, I refuse to even dwell upon what I read in his!\\n\\n \u0027And so they were assembled, and so after some small preamble, and after trying the food she\u0027d had prepared for them, then the talks commenced.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-18.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
