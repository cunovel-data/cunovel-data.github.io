{"id":62494,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The Gate To...?\n They started down the final flight of wooden stairs to the Saturn\u0027s rings or spider web platform, then moved round the central sphere until they approached the walkway leading to its coldly incandescent heart. Ten feet away from the gate in the electric fence Khuv halted, turned to Jazz and said: \u0027Well, what do you make of it?\u0027 He could only be talking about the glaring yet enigmatic globe which stood on the other side of the gate, maybe seven paces away. It was quite motionless, it made no sound, and yet it was menacing.\n \u0027You said that this was where the atomic pile stood,\u0027 Jazz answered. \u0027What, in mid-air? No, OK, I\u0027m being facetious. So what you mean is that after the blow-back everything within sixty-five feet or so of the centre of that... that - whatever it is - was vaporized out of existence, right?\u0027\n \"That would have been my explanation, too,\u0027 Khuv nodded, \u0027but incorrectly. As I\u0027ve already pointed out, conversion is the word. According to Viktor Luchov, the energy of the trapped beam was attracted by the latent energy - or the energy in action - in the pile. You could compare it to the way a nail is drawn to a magnet. In the final fusing there was no explosion. Perhaps there was an implosion, I don\u0027t know any more about that than Luchov himself. But the matter which had formed the floor of this place, and the pile itself along with its fuel - yes, and all the machinery; too, which had filled this area - all of these things, outwards from the centre to the spherical wall which now you see, were eaten, transformed, converted. Men, too. Seventeen nuclear physicists and technicians died instantly, leaving no trace.\u0027\n Jazz was impressed, if not by Khuv\u0027s telling of the story, certainly by its content. \u0027And radiation?\u0027 he said. \u0027There must have been a massive release of - \u0027\n Khuv shook his head, bringing Jazz to a halt. \u0027In relation to what was available, there was very little in the way of escaped radiation. The tips of those wormholes, fifteen to twenty feet into the rock, some of those were hotspots. We did what we could, then sealed them off. In the levels above there are dangerous places still, but again mainly sealed off. And in any case those levels are no longer in use and will never be used again. You have seen something of the magmass, but you have not seen all of it. Metal and plastic and rock were not the only materials which flowed together inseparably in that blast of alien energy, Michael. But rock and metal and plastic do not rot! You understand my meaning, I\u0027m sure...\u0027\n Jazz grimaced, said: \u0027How did they... clean the place up? It must have been a nightmare.\u0027\n \u0027It still is,\u0027 Khuv told him. That\u0027s why the lighting is muted up there. Acid was used. It was the only way. But it left moulds in the magmass which are utterly hideous to look upon. Pompeii must be something similar, but there at least the figures are still recognizably human. Not elongated or twisted or ... reversed.\u0027\n Jazz thought about it, enquired no further as to Khuv\u0027s exact meaning.\n Vyotsky had been growing restless for some little time. \u0027Do we have to stand here like this?\u0027 he suddenly growled. \u0027Why must we make targets of ourselves?\u0027\n Jazz\u0027s dislike for the man was intense, amounting to hatred. He\u0027d hated him from the moment he first laid eyes on him, and couldn\u0027t resist jibes whenever the opportunity for such surfaced. Now he sneered at the huge Russian. \u0027You think their fingers are likely to slip?\u0027 he nodded in the direction of the crew manning the closest Katushev. \u0027Or maybe they\u0027ve a grudge against you, too, eh?\u0027\n \u0027British,\u0027 said Vyotsky, taking a threatening pace closer, \u0027I could happily toss you on that fence there and watch you fry! You\u0027ve been advised to mind your mouth. But me? - I hope you go on pushing your luck till you push yourself right over the edge!\u0027\n \u0027Calm yourself, Karl,\u0027 Khuv told him. \u0027He\u0027s looking for your measure, that\u0027s all.\u0027 And to Jazz: \u0027He doesn\u0027t mean that sort of target,\u0027 he said. \u0027Or rather he does, but not in the way you think. It\u0027s simply that if anything - anything at all strange - comes out of that ball of light there, those crews have orders to open fire immediately and destroy, or try to destroy it. And those orders take absolutely no account of the fact that we happen to be standing here, right in the arc of fire.\u0027\n \u0027But if it did happen,\u0027 Vyotsky added, \u0027and if what could come through did, then I personally would be glad to stop a bullet!\u0027\n Khuv gave a little shiver, said, \u0027Let\u0027s get out of here. Karl is quite right: we are stupid to stand here tempting fate. It has happened five times before, and there\u0027s no guarantee it won\u0027t happen again.\u0027\n As they turned away and headed back toward the stairs, Jazz asked, \u0027Do you have it on film? I mean, if it\u0027s a regular occurrence - \u0027\n \u0027Not regular,\u0027 Khuv corrected him. \u0027Five - shall we call them, \"emergences\" - in two years can hardly be called frequent. But I take your point. Oh, yes, Michael, we learned our lessons quickly. After the first two encounters we fitted cameras, and now there are also cameras mounted on these guns. They are triggered when the weapons themselves are triggered. What the gunners see, the cameras capture - on film, anyway. As for the thing your side has code-named \"Pill\": that was the first. Nobody here was ready for it. The second one was smaller, but we weren\u0027t ready for that, either. After that the cameras were put in.\u0027\n \u0027Any chance of seeing what we\u0027re talking about?\u0027 Jazz might as well go for broke; there was little or no chance of him getting out of here, but still he\u0027d try to discover what he could of this mess if only on the off-chance.\n \u0027Certainly,\u0027 said Khuv without hesitation. \u0027But if you prefer I can show you something far more interesting than mere films.\u0027 There was something about the way he said it that warned Jazz to be careful, but nevertheless he answered:\n \u0027Well, by all means, let\u0027s keep me interested.\u0027\n Vyotsky\u0027s grimly sardonic chuckle sounding from behind made him wonder if he\u0027d made the right choice...\n They went back up through the quiet but disquieting magmass levels to the perimeter, and along it to the secure area which housed the Projekt\u0027s laboratories. Passing through two guarded security doors, they arrived finally at a steel door bearing a stencilled scarlet skull and the stark warning:\n CAUTION!\n KEEPER AND SECURITY\n CLASSIFIED PERSONS\n ONLY!\n Jazz couldn\u0027t help but think: more melodramatics? But Khuv and Vyotsky had gone very quiet, and perhaps it would be as well if he followed suit. He held his tongue, wondered about the word \u0027keeper\u0027. Keeper of what?\n Khuv had a plastic ID tag which he inserted in a slot in the door. The card was accepted, \u0027read\u0027 and given back; mechanisms whirred and the door opened with a click. Before pushing it all the way open, Khuv motioned to Vyotsky who turned down the lights in the anteroom. As the lights dimmed Jazz noticed Vyotsky\u0027s face: it was pale and shiny with cold sweat. Also, his Adam\u0027s apple bobbed noticeably. There could be little doubt that the big Russian was both hard and cruel, but it seemed there were some things that could get to him. It also appeared that Jazz was about to meet one of them.\n Khuv, though, was cool as ever. Now he pushed the heavy door open and motioned Jazz through it. With some misgivings, the British agent stepped inside the dark room. Vyotsky followed close behind him, and Khuv came last, closing the door after him.\n The darkness was almost complete: only a series of small red lights the size of flashlight bulbs glowed in the ceiling. Revealed by their dim glow, the rectangular shape of a glass case stood against one wall like a huge tropical fish tank. Khuv\u0027s voice came soft out of the darkness. \u0027Are you ready, Michael?\u0027\n \u0027When you are,\u0027 Jazz answered. But even as the words left his mouth, he knew he wasn\u0027t here to admire goldfish.\n A sharp click sounded and the lights came on.\n Something moved in the tank and reared up!\n Behind Jazz, Vyotsky made a choking sound. He\u0027d seen this before, had known what was in here, but if anything the knowledge had only served to precipitate his instinctive reaction to it. And now that Jazz saw it he could readily understand why.\n The thing was something like the moulds in the magmass which Khuv had not described but Jazz had pictured. It was like that, and yet not like that, for it was alive. Twisting, flowing, it glared out through the thick glass of the tank with eyes that were sheer hell. It was the size of a large dog, but it was not a dog. It wasn\u0027t anything Jazz could have possibly imagined but a composite of most of his worst nightmares. It didn\u0027t stay still long enough for him to even try to decide what it was. And worst of all, it didn\u0027t seem to know itself!\n Flattening itself for a moment against the glass of the tank, the thing might have been a leech. Its underside was corrugated and shaped like a huge, elongated sucker. But its four hands, its tail and its head were parts that might readily fit on a giant rat! That was how it looked - for a split-second. Then -\n The head and hands changed, underwent a swift metamorphosis, became manlike. An almost human face crushed itself to the glass, gazing flatly, almost pitifully out into the room. It grimaced: an expression that was part smile, part scowl, part snarl, and then its human jaws yawned inhumanly open. Inside that mouth was a hell of teeth worthy of some monster piranha!\n Jazz stepped back, gasping, and bumped into Vyotsky. The big Russian grasped his shoulders, steadied him. And in the tank the thing\u0027s hands sprouted hooks that scrabbled at the glass; its face collapsed to a black leathery mask with a convoluted snout and huge, hairy pointed ears, like a great bat; webs grew between its limbs and body, forming wings. It sprang high, thudded against the tough glass ceiling of its tank, flopped down on the deep sandy bed.\n Jazz was vaguely aware that someone - possibly Khuv, he thought; yes, even Khuv - had murmured, \u0027My God!\" In that same moment the thing had elongated into a worm with a spade head, rammed itself head-first down into the sand and burrowed out of sight. There was a final flurry of sand and ... all was still.\n After long moments of silence Jazz expelled his breath in a great sigh. \u0027Christ almighty!\u0027 he said, in a small voice. Then all three men drew air deeply into starved lungs. Jazz closed his gaping mouth, looked at the two Russians. \u0027And you\u0027re telling me this - thing - came out of that ball of light, right?\u0027\n Khuv, pale in the bright lights, with eyes that were dark blots in his doughy face, nodded. Through the Gate, yes,\u0027 he said.\n Jazz shook his head in bewilderment. \u0027But how in hell did you catch it?\u0027 It seemed a very reasonable question.\n \u0027As you can see,\u0027 Khuv answered, \u0027it doesn\u0027t like bright lights. And for all that it can change its shape at will, still it seems very primitive in its mental processes - if it has any worth considering as such. It could be that it\u0027s all sheer animal instinct. We think it probably attacked the Gate on the other side; it would have been night in that world, and the glaringly bright sphere must have seemed like an enemy, or even prey. But when it burst through to our side - into the hollow sphere of rock down there - it was bright as day. Luckily for the people who were there, it headed straight down one of the wormholes - to escape from the light, do you see? And someone had his wits about him sufficiently to put the open end of a steel cabinet over the mouth of the hole. When it tried to come back out it was trapped.\u0027\n \u0027How long have you - \u0027 Jazz found the greatest difficulty in concentrating on what he was saying, found it almost impossible to take his eyes off the tank, \u0027 - had this thing?\u0027\n \u0027Eighteen months,\u0027 Khuv answered. \"This was the third encounter.\u0027\n \u0027Of the too close kind,\u0027 Jazz had finally got himself together.\n \u0027Pardon?\u0027 Khuv stared at him blankly.\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 Jazz shook his head. \u0027But tell me: what does it eat?\u0027 He didn\u0027t know why he\u0027d asked that. Maybe it was the memory of all those teeth, and Khuv\u0027s talk of prey.\n Khuv\u0027s eyes narrowed. Not defensively but thoughtfully. He opened the door, switched off the lights and beckoned Jazz and Vyotsky to come out. They went back to the perimeter and Khuv led the way to his own quarters. On the way Jazz asked: \u0027I take it it does eat?\u0027\n Khuv remained silent but Vyotsky answered for him: \u0027Oh, yes, it eats. It doesn\u0027t need to, apparently, but it does when food\u0027s on offer. It eats people - or anything else with good red salty guts! Or it would if it could. Its keeper feeds it on blood and offal which is pumped through a tube to it. He knows exactly how much to give it. Too much and it gets bigger and stronger. Too little and it shrivels, hibernates. When they\u0027ve worked out a way to handle it safely, then they\u0027ll try to find out what makes it tick.\u0027\n They?\u0027\n The specialists from Moscow,\u0027 said Vyotsky, shrugging. The people from - \u0027\n \u0027Karl!\u0027 Khuv stopped him with a word. And Jazz thought: so even though I\u0027m a prisoner, and for all Khuv\u0027s \"glasnost\", still there are sensitive areas, eh?\n \u0027Specialists,\u0027 said Khuv, \u0027yes. If they can find out about it, maybe they\u0027ll also discover something of its world.\u0027\n Something else was bothering Jazz. \u0027What about these flame-throwers I keep seeing?\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t it obvious?\u0027 Vyotsky scowled. \u0027Are you stupid after all, British?\u0027\n \u0027Concentrated fire kills them,\u0027 said Khuv. \u0027Up to now it\u0027s about the only thing that does. That we\u0027ve discovered, anyway.\u0027\n Jazz nodded. Things were beginning to shape up in his head. \u0027I\u0027m starting to see the potential,\u0027 he said, drily.\n \u0027And no need to tell me where your \"specialists\" come from. The Department for the Study of Chemical and Biological Warfare on Protze Prospekt, right?\u0027\n Khuv made no answer. His mouth had fallen aslant in a twisted smile.\n Jazz nodded. His own expression was a mixture of sarcasm and revulsion. \u0027And how would that be for a biological weapon, eh?\u0027\n They had reached Khuv\u0027s quarters. He opened the door, said: \u0027Would you like a drink, or should I let Karl take you back to your cell and toss you around a little to improve your manners?\u0027 His voice crackled like thin ice underfoot. Jazz had touched a tender spot. The British agent was much quicker on the uptake than Khuv had given him credit for.\n Jazz looked at Vyotsky\u0027s grinning face, said: \u0027Oh, I think I\u0027d prefer the drink every time.\u0027\n \u0027Very well, but try to remember: you are in no position to criticize anything. You are a spy, a murderer, a would-be saboteur. And remember this, too: you don\u0027t know everything. We don\u0027t know everything! Weapons? Like... like that? Personally I would rather close the place down, concrete it in, lock the Gate shut forever - if that\u0027s at all feasible. So would Viktor Luchov. But the Projekt was sponsored - indeed it was ordered - by the Defence Agency. We don\u0027t control anything, Michael, but are ourselves controlled. Now make up your mind: we can be \"friends\", or I can have someone else, someone a lot less sympathetic, complete your briefing. It\u0027s up to you.\u0027\n Briefing? For some reason Jazz didn\u0027t like the way Khuv had used the word. A slip of the tongue, obviously. Briefing didn\u0027t really apply here, did it? Why are you being given the treatment? a voice asked in the back of his mind. What\u0027s in it for them? He didn\u0027t have the answers and so put the question aside, said:\n \u0027OK, I accept that. We all do what we have to. We all have our orders. But just answer me one more thing and after that I won\u0027t interrupt you again.\u0027\n Khuv ushered Jazz and Vyotsky into his living area. \u0027Very well,\u0027 he said, \u0027what is it?\u0027\n \u0027That thing in the glass tank, your intruder from another world,\u0027 Jazz wrinkled his nose in disgust. \u0027You say it has a keeper? Someone who looks after it, feeds it, studies it? It\u0027s just that I can\u0027t imagine what kind of a man he would be. He must have nerves of steel!\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 Vyotsky gave a snort that was half-way a laugh. \u0027Do you think he volunteered? He\u0027s a scientist, a small man with thick spectacles. A man dedicated to science -also to the bottle.\u0027\n Jazz raised an eyebrow. \u0027An alcoholic?\u0027\n Khuv\u0027s expression didn\u0027t change. \u0027Very soon,\u0027 he said after a moment\u0027s pause. \u0027Yes, I\u0027m afraid he will be...\u0027\n Three hours later, at about 7:30 p.m. - after Jazz had had delivered to him in his cell a cup of tepid, flavourless coffee and a cold meat sandwich, standard evening fare, and after he\u0027d consumed both - he lay on his back on his metal army bed and yet again turned over in his mind all the facts Khuv had given him. The Russian had talked almost nonstop for an hour and a half, during which time the British agent had remained true to his word and had not once interrupted him. Once Khuv was underway Jazz hadn\u0027t wanted to stop him anyway, partly because the Russian\u0027s flow of words and images had been smooth and required no deep explanation, but mainly because his story had been completely fascinating.\n And now, yet again, Jazz recapped:\n The Perchorsk Incident or \u0027pi\u0027 had been the disastrous test run of Franz Ayvaz\u0027s sub-atomic shield. After that mess, clearing up had almost been completed when \u0027Pill\u0027 happened, which Khuv referred to as Encounter One; but from what the KGB Major had told Jazz, it hadn\u0027t been so much an encounter as a downright nightmare!\n The - creature? - which had come through the sphere of light on that occasion had been... well, it had been the monstrosity Jazz had seen on the film shot by the AWACS reconnaissance aircraft over the Hudson Bay, which now he realized was like nothing so much as the Big Brother of the thing in the glass tank. But when Big Brother had squeezed its bulk into this world from its own...\n Khuv\u0027s description of Encounter One as he himself had heard it from people present at the time had been graphic:\n \u0027You\u0027ve seen it, Michael, on that film you told us about. You know what it was like. Ah, but that was only after it had escaped through the shaft into the ravine and got itself airborne! On the ground it had been far worse; oh, yes, and I\u0027ll tell you about it from first-hand accounts! First, however, I\u0027ll try to explain how the Gate works. Or I\u0027ll describe what happens when it works. The \"skin\" of the sphere - its \"surface\" as we see it - is in itself a contradiction of physics as we understand that science. Viktor Luchov has likened it to an \"event horizon\". We see things on it after, and even in advance of, any given event! In the former case as a sort of retinal after-image printed in the sphere, and in the latter as a gradual emergence until the - whatever - breaks through.\n \u0027They actually saw that thing coming - but they didn\u0027t know what they were seeing! Remember, it was the first. They saw it in the sphere: a gradual darkening of part of the surface up near the sphere\u0027s dome. The dark patch became a shape, the shape a sort of misty three-dimensional picture, and the image - in a little while -reality. They saw the head and face of a bat four or five feet across: like a hologram but slowly, oh so slowly, changing. It was all in slow motion, a fascinating thing to witness. So they thought. The wrinkling of the convolute snout, which perhaps took half a minute; the leaning forward of the ears - a flicker of motion in real-time -lasting all of five seconds; the baring of the needle teeth, each one of them six inches long, which was accomplished with the speed of a yawn.\n \u0027Now think of it: they had guns! There were actually a handful of soldiers down there with weapons - not for any specific purpose, but simply because soldiers sometimes have guns. But who would think to shoot at such a thing, eh? After the fact, maybe - but at the time? Listen to me: do we shoot off guns at pictures on a screen? That was what this was like, a 3-D film.\n \u0027Also, Viktor Luchov was there. Do you think he would have let them shoot at it? Not a chance! He didn\u0027t even know what the sphere was yet. But ... it might well be his redemption! In Franz Ayvaz\u0027s absence he had still to answer for the Perchorsk Incident, and now out of nowhere this... phenomenon!\n \u0027Its clarity had been improving for about an hour. All the misty edges had firmed up until the image had the brilliance of a TV picture. People had run to fetch cameras and were actually filming it, like tourists filming ancient monuments or views of outstanding beauty! After all, they knew it couldn\u0027t be real. What? A bat with a head as huge as an elephant\u0027s?\n \u0027Then - quite suddenly, without warning - the impossible happened. They realized that the snout had pushed through the \"skin\" of the sphere. The monster was no longer just an image on a screen. It sniffed, inhaled sharply several times - and in the next instant the nightmare was upon them!\n The event horizon slows things down, Michael. But once the Gate is breached, then all reverts to normal. But \"normal\" for that obscenity was total hell for the people face to face with it! I say it sniffed - a huge bat sniffing its prey - and it scented them! And it changed! The face and head that came through the skin were those of a vast wolf. You saw the thing in the tank metamorphose? It was like that, the very same. The giant wolf\u0027s head came through, and then its shoulders - but pushing them forward was a leathery bat\u0027s body, and great bat wings unfurling as wide as the sphere itself!\n \u0027Panic? There was such panic as men rarely experience in a lifetime. And to make it worse, the thing didn\u0027t come into this world silently but screaming. Ah, and what a voice it had!\n \u0027It came howling its rage at the bright lights, its hunger for the blood it had scented, its fear of an alien environment. And it slew. But while it was doing this, still it continued to emerge from the sphere. Now the rear end of the thing was like a vast centipede, stampeding through the Gate and threshing everywhere. It changed endlessly, became a dozen different hybrids in as many moments, and each and every one of them murderous!\n \u0027It snapped cables in its blind blundering - blind, yes, for it couldn\u0027t bear the lights. And a mercy it was blind, for if not the carnage would have been that much worse. But as it damaged the power supply many of the lights failed and its vision improved accordingly. Now it picked its victims with more deliberation, and devoured them whole with a deal more dexterity.\n \u0027But now, too, the soldiers were shooting at it - those with the nerve for it, anyway. They couldn\u0027t tell if their bullets hurt, but the massed gunfire certainly alarmed it. It headed for the darkest place it could find: the dimly lighted shaft, of course. By now it had changed into something very like the squirting squid-thing your AWACS air-crew filmed. Vast - amazingly vast �C it squeezed and squirted its way through the magmass levels. Indeed, in the way its plastic body flowed it was not unlike the magmass; and as it went so it put out extrusions with mouths and with eyes and with ... oh, appendages for which there is really no description. Imagine a leg sprouting from its side, and then the leg itself becoming a scuttling spider-thing, and you may have some idea of what I\u0027m talking about.\n \u0027But finally it was out into the ravine, and in its wake a trail of death and destruction filled with the screams of the dead and the dying, and the empty spaces which were all that remained of those who had vanished forever. For a second time the Perchorsk Projekt was a shambles, and somewhere in the world outside that monstrosity was on the loose and rampaging. And no one had the faintest idea what to do about it.\n \u0027If we Russians have faults, Michael, they are these: we tend to be too well regimented in our thinking, and we are not accustomed to failure. So that when things go disastrously wrong we stand stunned, uncomprehending, like small children waiting for Mama to tell us what to do next. It was like that for Khrushchev when Kennedy faced him down, and again for the - shall we say - \"responsible authorities\" over that stupid affair of the Korean airliner. If there are any more disasters in the offing, it will doubtless be the same all over again - just as it was here at Perchorsk.\n \u0027Eventually the military were alerted, and they in turn told Moscow. But can you imagine the reaction? \"What? Something has got loose from Perchorsk in the Urals? What sort of something? What are you talking about?\" But at last Migs were sent up from Kirovsk, and the rest you already know. Indeed, you know more than I do about that part of it! But at least I know why the Russian fighters failed while the USAF planes succeeded. We\u0027ve learned that much from the other... encounters. It\u0027s the reason for the flame-throwers.\n That\u0027s right: the American aircraft were equipped with experimental Firedevil air-to-air missiles which not only explode on impact but hurl searing flames all about. Less bulky than napalm but ten per cent more effective. That is what stopped that thing over the Hudson Bay - fire! Fire and light - sunlight! Until the American fighters contacted it, the thing had flown through or under fairly dense cloud cover, and the sunlight wasn\u0027t strong yet. But as the sun rose so the creature descended, seeking protection for itself. They are cold things, Michael, and they are things of darkness.\n \u0027You\u0027ve described what you saw on that AWACS film: clouds of vile gasses boiling off the creature\u0027s surface in the bright sunlight, and the way its vast, flattened, airfoil body shrank from the sun. Ah, yes! It wasn\u0027t so much that the Migs failed, but that other, natural forces assisted the Americans in their success. The thing was half-beaten before it met the Americans, and their Firedevils finished it off.\n \u0027Well, and that was the end of Encounter One...\n \u0027Now a sort of anticlimax: Encounter Two was a wolf!\n \u0027It came through in just the same way as the first thing, but by comparison it was so small - and so normal - that it almost went unnoticed. But not quite. A soldier spotted it first, put a bullet in it the moment it came limping through the Gate. That stopped it, but not fatally. It was examined, but oh so cautiously, and found to be ... a wolf! It was old, mangy, almost blind and close to starving. They saved its life, caged it, fed and cared for it and subjected it to every test in the book. Because they weren\u0027t quite sure they could trust it, do you see? But ... it was a wolf. In every respect a brother of the creatures which even today hunt in the great forests of these parts. By the time it died nine months ago, of old age, the animal was quite tame.\n \u0027And so they thought: perhaps the world on the other side isn\u0027t so very different from this one after all. Or: perhaps this gateway we\u0027ve opened leads to many other worlds. Viktor Luchov thinks that as a physical phenomenon - or as a phenomenon of physics - it lies somewhere between a black hole and a white hole. Black holes sit out in the deeps of space and gobble up worlds, and not even light can escape from their fantastic gravitational attraction; white holes are the theoretical melting pots that give birth to galaxies; both are gateways to and from other space-times. Likewise our sphere of white light - but not nearly so violent! Which is why Luchov calls it a \"grey hole\", a gateway in both directions!\u0027\n At this point Khuv had held up a warning hand. \u0027Don\u0027t break the thread now, Michael, for we\u0027re doing so well. You can ask your questions later.\u0027 And when Jazz had relaxed again:\n \u0027Myself, I\u0027ve no interest in the \"holes\" of advanced physics theory - I simply call it a monstrous threat! But that aside...\n \u0027You\u0027ve seen Encounter Three and I\u0027ve told you about it. As for Four: that was another anticlimax, but not quite so ordinary or acceptable as the wolf. It was a bat, order Chiroptera, genus Desmodus. Strangely, Vampyrum is the false vampire, while Desmodus and Diphylla are the true blood-suckers. This one had a wing-spread of point seven of a metre: quite a large one of its species, I\u0027m told, but by no means a giant. It was seen coming well in advance, of course, and no chances were taken with it. As it emerged, in that selfsame moment, they shot it dead. But just as the wolf was a true wolf, so the bat was a true bat. Curiously, the vampire bat is a creature of South or Central America. Perhaps our grey hole was a gateway not only to other worlds but also to other parts of this world.\n \u0027Anyway, I was here by this time; the rest of this account is first-hand. Oh, and I can show you film of the bat\u0027s emergence, if you like. Not that you\u0027ll learn anything more than I\u0027ve already told you, for it is exactly as I\u0027ve described it. Ah, but the Fifth Encounter... that was something entirely different.\u0027\n At this juncture Jazz had noted how Vyotsky, behind his dark beard, had gone very pale again. He, too, had been present for that Fifth Encounter. \u0027Get it over with,\u0027 the big KGB man had stood up, gulped down his drink, started to pace the floor. \u0027Tell him about it, or show him the film, but get done with it.\u0027\n \u0027Karl doesn\u0027t like it,\u0027 Khuv\u0027s comment was entirely superfluous, his smile cold and grim. \u0027But then, neither do I. Still, likes and dislikes change nothing. They can\u0027t alter the facts. Come, I\u0027ll show you the film.\u0027\n In a second small room Khuv had something of a study. There were bookshelves, a tiny desk, steel chairs, a modern projector and small screen. Vyotsky made no attempt to join Jazz and his senior officer but poured himself another drink and stayed behind in Khuv\u0027s living-room. Jazz knew, however, that that was the only way out of Khuv\u0027s quarters, and that only a few scant paces and a bit of flimsy door panelling separated him from the huge KGB bully.\n Now, too, he had seen that his coming here had not been a spontaneous occurrence; Khuv had prepared himself in advance; all he had to do was dim the lights and roll the film. And whatever Jazz had expected, it certainly had not been what he saw.\n The film was in colour, had a sound track, was very professional in every way. At one side of the screen a dark, fuzzy, out-of-focus shadow proved to be the side of a Russian soldier, with a glinting Kalashnikov braced against his thigh. Centre screen was the sphere of white light, or \u0027Gate\u0027 as Jazz now thought of it, and imposed on its dazzling surface - the bottom of the \u0027picture\u0027 coming just inches higher than the boards of the walkway where it spanned the gap between the Saturn\u0027s-rings platform and the sphere - was the image... of a man!\n The camera had then zoomed in, turning the entire screen white and therefore that much less dazzling, with the image of the man central. He \u0027strode\u0027 straight ahead, looking directly into the camera. His movements were so painfully slow that each pace took long seconds, and Jazz had found himself wondering if he\u0027d ever get here. But then Khuv had warned:\n \u0027See how the picture clears? A sure sign that he\u0027s about to come through. But if I were you I wouldn\u0027t wait for that. Study him now, while you can!\u0027 And obligingly, the camera had closed on the man\u0027s face.\n The forehead was sloped, and the skull shaved except for a central lock of hair like a thick black stripe on the pale, almost grey flesh. Swept back like a mane and tied in a knot, the lock bobbed at the back of the man\u0027s neck. His eyes were small and close together, and very startling. They glared out from under thick black eyebrows that met in a tangle across the bridge of a squat or flattened nose. The ears were slightly pointed and had large lobes; they lay flat to the head above hollow, almost gaunt cheeks. The lips were red and fleshy, in a mouth slanted to the left and set with a sort of permanent sneer or snarl. The man\u0027s chin was pointed, made to look even more so by a small black beard waxed to a point. But the face\u0027s main feature was that pair of small, glaring eyes. Jazz had looked at them again: red as blood, they\u0027d gleamed in deep black orbits. As if sensing Jazz\u0027s needs, the camera had then drawn back to show the entire man again. He wore a short pelmet of cloth about his loins, sandals on his feet, a large ring of golden metal in his right ear. His right hand was gloved in a gauntlet heavy with spikes, blades and hooks - an incredibly cruel, murderous weapon!\n After that Jazz had only sufficient time to note the man\u0027s leanness, the ripple of his fine-toned muscles, and his wolf\u0027s lope of a walk before he stepped out of the sphere onto the walkway - and then everything had speeded up!\n The British agent came back to the present, gripped the edge of his bed and drew himself into a sitting position. He swung his feet to the floor and put his back to the metal wall. The wall was cool but not cold; through it. Jazz could feel the life of the subterranean complex, the nervous, irregular coursing of its frightened blood. It was like being below decks in a big ship, where the throb of the engines comes right through the floor and walls and bulkheads. And just as he\u0027d be aware of the life in a ship, so he was aware of the terror in this place.\n There were men down there in that unnatural cavern in the heart of the mountain, men with guns. Some of them had seen for themselves, and others had been shown on films like the one Jazz had seen, what could come through the Gate they guarded. Little wonder the Perchorsk Projekt was afraid.\n He gave a small shiver, then a grim chuckle. He\u0027d caught the Projekt\u0027s fever: its symptom was this shivering, even when it was warm. He\u0027d seen them all doing it, and now he did it, too.\n Jazz deliberately gave himself a mental shake, forced himself to return to the film Khuv had shown him...\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-4.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
