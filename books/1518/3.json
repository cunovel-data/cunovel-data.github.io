{"id":62493,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The Perchorsk Projekt\n The complex built into the base of the riven mountain at the bottom of the Perchorsk ravine was vast, and it wasn\u0027t without a degree of Russian pride in achievement that Chingiz Khuv took Michael J. Simmons on a tour of inspection - but neither did Khuv lack respect for Jazz\u0027s considerable talent for destruction. On their walkabouts, the British agent was literally strait-jacketed in a garment which effectively disabled him from the waist up, and as if that weren\u0027t enough Karl Vyotsky was invariably present, surly bodyguard to his KGB boss.\n \u0027Blame all of this on the technology-gap, if you must have any sort of scapegoat at all,\u0027 Khuv told the British agent. The Americans with their microchips, spy-satellites, complicated and oh-so-clever electronic listening systems. I mean, where\u0027s the security if they can tap-in on any phone call anywhere in the whole wide world, eh? And these are only a handful of the ways in which sensitive information may be obtained. The art of spying\u0027 (a sideways glance at Jazz, but without enmity) \u0027takes a great many forms and encompasses some formidable, one might even say terrifying talents. On both sides, I mean, East and West alike. High-tech on the one hand, and the supernatural on the other.\u0027\n \u0027The supernatural?\u0027 Jazz raised an enquiring eyebrow. The Perchorsk Projekt looks solid enough to me. And anyway, I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t much believe in ghosts.\u0027\n Khuv smiled and nodded. \u0027I know,\u0027 he said, \u0027I know. We\u0027ve checked on that - or perhaps you don\u0027t remember?\u0027\n Jazz looked blank for a moment, then frowned. Come to think of it, he did remember. It had been part of his \u0026#8226;debriefing\u0027, but at the time he hadn\u0027t paid it a lot of attention. Actually, he\u0027d thought his \u0027DO\u0027 was pulling his leg: to ask what he knew about INTESP, or E-Branch, which used Extra Sensory Perception as a tool for espionage. Indeed ESPionage! As it happened, Jazz had quite genuinely known nothing at all about it, and he probably wouldn\u0027t have believed it even if he had.\n \u0027If telepathy was feasible,\u0027 he told Khuv, \u0027they wouldn\u0027t have needed to send me, would they? There wouldn\u0027t be any more secrets!\u0027\n \u0027Quite right, quite right,\u0027 Khuv answered after a moment\u0027s pause. Those were my feelings exactly - once upon a time. And as you rightly point out, all of this,\u0027 he waved an arm expansively about, \u0027is obviously solid enough.\u0027\n \u0027All of this\u0027 was the gymnasium area, where for the past week Jazz had been getting himself back in shape following the fortnight he\u0027d spent on his back. The fact that they\u0027d so easily emptied him of all he had known still didn\u0027t sit too well with him. Here, as they paused a while to let Karl Vyotsky strip off his pullover and work out for a few minutes with the weights, Jazz thought he\u0027d try a little pumping of his own.\n He had no doubt that whatever questions he put to Khuv, they\u0027d be answered in a truthful, straightforward manner. In this respect the KGB Major was entirely disarming. But on the other hand, why shouldn\u0027t he be open? He had nothing to lose. He knew that Jazz wasn\u0027t going anywhere outside of this place, ever. He\u0027d known that right from square one. That\u0027s the way they had it figured out, anyway.\n \u0027You surprise me,\u0027 he said, \u0027complaining about American know-how. I was supposed to be about 75 per cent proof against brainwashing, but you pulled my plug and I just gurgled away. No torture, not even a threat, and I\u0027m pentathol-resistant - but I couldn\u0027t hold a thing back! How the hell did you do that?\u0027\n Khuv glanced at him, went back to watching Vyotsky handling weights as if they were made of papier-m\u0026acirc;ch��. Jazz looked at Vyotsky, too.\n Khuv\u0027s underling was huge: seventy-five inches and a little over two hundred pounds, and all of it muscle. He hardly seemed to have any neck at all, and his chest was like a barrel expanding out of his narrow waist. His thighs were round and tight inside light-blue trousers. He felt Jazz\u0027s eyes on him, grinned through his black beard and flexed biceps that would shame a bear. \u0027You\u0027d like to work out with me, British?\u0027 He finished his exercises and dropped the weights clanging to the floor. \u0027Bare-fisted, maybe, in the ring?\u0027\n \u0027Just say the word, Ivan,\u0027 Jazz answered, half-smiling, his voice low. \u0027I still owe you for a couple of teeth, remember?\u0027\n Vyotsky showed his own teeth again, but not in a grin, and put on his pullover. Khuv turned to Jazz, said: \u0027Don\u0027t push your luck with Karl, my friend. He can give you twenty pounds and ten years of experience. On top of which he has some ugly little habits. When we caught you on that mountain he knocked your teeth out, yes, but believe me you were lucky. He wanted to pull your head off. And it\u0027s possible he could do it, with a little effort. I might even have let him try, except that would have been a terrible waste, and we\u0027ve already had enough of that around here.\u0027\n They began to walk again, passed through the gymnasium and out into a room containing a small swimming pool. The pool wasn\u0027t tiled; it had simply been blasted out of the bedrock along a natural fault. Here, where the uneven, veined ceiling was a little higher, several of the Projekt\u0027s staff were swimming in the pool\u0027s heated water; the room echoed to the slapping sounds of flesh on plastic as two women open-handed a ball to and fro between them. A thin, balding man was practicing jack-knives from a springboard.\n \u0027As for your \"debriefing,\" said Khuv, shrugging, \u0027well, there\u0027s high-tech and there\u0027s high-tech. The West has its miniaturization, its superb electronics, and we have our-\u0027\n \u0027Bulgarian chemists?\u0027 Jazz cut him short. The tiled walkway at the side of the pool was wet and his feet were slipping; he stumbled, and Vyotsky caught his arm in a powerful grip, steadied him. Jazz cursed under his breath. \u0027Do you know how uncomfortable it is walking round in this thing?\u0027 He was talking about his strait-jacket.\n \u0027A necessary precaution,\u0027 said Khuv. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but it really is for the best. Most of the people here aren\u0027t armed. They\u0027re scientists, not soldiers. Soldiers guard the approaches to the Projekt, certainly, but their barracks are elsewhere; not far away, but not here. There are some soldiers here, as you\u0027ll see, but they are specialists. And so, if you were to get loose - \u0027 again his shrug. \u0027You might do a lot of damage before you met up with someone like Karl here.\u0027\n At the end of the pool they passed out through another door into a gently curving corridor which Jazz recognized as the perimeter. That was what they called it, \u0027the perimeter\u0027: a metal-clad, rubber-floored tunnel which enclosed the entire complex about its middle level. From the perimeter, doors led inwards into all the Projekt\u0027s many areas. There were still a few doors Jazz hadn\u0027t been through, the ones which required special security access. He\u0027d seen the living areas, hospital, recreation rooms, dining hall and some of the laboratories, but not the machine itself, if there was such a beast. Khuv had promised him, however, that today he was to visit \u0027the guts\u0027 of the place.\n Khuv led the way, Jazz following, with Vyotsky bringing up the rear. People came and went around them, dressed in lab smocks, overalls; some with millboards and notes, others carrying pieces of machinery or instruments. The place could easily be some high-tech factory anywhere in the world. As Jazz and his escort proceeded, so\n Khuv said:\n \u0027You asked about your debriefing. Well, you\u0027re right about our Bulgarian friends: they really have a knack for brewing potent stuff - and of course I\u0027m not just talking about their wine. The pills were to cause you pain; they cramp muscles, heighten sensitivity. The shots are part truth-drug, part sedative. They have the effect of making you susceptible to suggestion. It\u0027s not so much that you can\u0027t refuse, more that you\u0027re far more likely to believe -anything that we tell you! Your Debriefing Officer not only speaks very good English, but he\u0027s a top-rank psychologist, too. So don\u0027t blame yourself that you let your side down. You really had no choice. You thought you were home and dry, and that you were only doing your duty.\u0027\n Jazz merely grunted for reply. His face was void of emotion, which was the way he\u0027d kept it most of the time since discovering he\u0027d been duped.\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 Khuv continued, \u0027your own British, er, \"chemists\" are rather clever men in their own right. That capsule in your mouth, for instance: we weren\u0027t able to analyse its contents here at the Projekt. Hardly surprising; we aren\u0027t equipped with a full range of analytical facilities - that\u0027s not what the Perchorsk Projekt is about - but even so we were at least able to conclude that your little tooth capsule contained a remarkably complex substance.\n That\u0027s why we\u0027ve sent it to Moscow. Who can say, maybe there\u0027s something in it we can use, eh?\u0027\n While he spoke to Jazz, Khuv kept glancing back at him, checking him up and down as he\u0027d done so often during the course of the past few weeks. He saw a man only thirty years of age, upon whose shoulders his Secret Service masters in the West had placed an awesome weight of responsibility. They obviously respected his abilities. And yet for all Simmons\u0027s training, his physical and mental fitness, still he was inexperienced. Then again, how \u0027experienced\u0027 can a field agent in the Secret Service be? Every mission was a flip of a coin: heads you win, and tails... you lose your head? Or as the British agent himself might have it, a game of Russian roulette.\n For all Simmons\u0027s expertise in his many subjects, still they were only theoretical skills, as yet untested under \u0027battle\u0027 conditions. For on his very first assignment the dice had rolled against him, the cylinder had clicked into position with its bullet directly under the firing-pin. Unfortunate for Michael J. Simmons, but extremely fortunate for Chingiz Khuv.\n Again the KGB Major\u0027s dark jewel eyes rested on Simmons. The Englishman stood just a fraction under six feet tall, maybe a half-inch less than Khuv himself. During the time he\u0027d spent in his role as a logger, he\u0027d grown a red beard to match his unruly shock of hair. That had gone now, revealing a square jaw and slightly hollow cheeks. He\u0027d be a little underweight, too, for apparently the British liked their agents lean and hungry. A fat man doesn\u0027t run as fast as a thin one, and he makes a much easier target.\n For all that he was young, Simmons\u0027s brow was deeply lined from frowning; even taking into account his present circumstances, he did not seem a particularly happy man, or even one who\u0027d ever been especially happy. His eyes were keen, grey, penetrating; his teeth (with the exception of the ones Karl had removed) were in good order, strong, square and white; about his sturdy neck he wore a small plain cross on a silver chain, which was his only item of jewellery. He had hands which were hard for all that they were long and tapered, and arms which seemed a little long, giving him a sort of gangling or gawky appearance. But Khuv was well aware that appearances can be deceptive. Simmons was a skilled athlete and his brain was a fine one.\n They reached an area of the perimeter Jazz had not seen before. Here the coming and going of staff was far less frequent, and as the three turned the curve of the long corridor so a security door had come into view, blocking it entirely. On the approach to this door the ceiling and walls were burned black; great blisters were evident in the paintwork; closer to the door the very rock of the ceiling appeared to have melted, run down like wax and solidified on the cool metal of the artificial walls. The rubber floor tiles had burned right through to naked metal plates, which were buckled out of alignment. It seemed somehow paradoxical that a Russian Army flame-thrower stood on a shelf against the exterior wall, clamped in position there. In surroundings like these Jazz might well have expected a fire extinguisher - but a flame-thrower? He made a mental note to ask about it later, but right now:\n \u0027The Perchorsk Incident,\u0027 he said, watching Khuv for his reaction.\n \u0027Correct.\u0027 The Russian\u0027s expression didn\u0027t change. He faced Jazz eye to eye. \u0027Now we are going to take that strait-jacket off you. The reason is simple: down in the lower levels you will need some freedom of movement. I don\u0027t want you to fall and hurt yourself. However, should you attempt anything foolish, Karl has my permission - indeed he has my instructions - to hurt you severely. Also I should tell you that if you got lost down there, you could well find yourself in an area of high radioactivity. Eventually we may get around to decontaminating all the hotspots, but it\u0027s unlikely. Why should we when we won\u0027t have cause to use those areas again? And so, depending on how long it took you to surrender, or how long it took us to flush you out, you would almost certainly jeopardize your health - perhaps even fatally. Do you understand?\u0027\n Jazz nodded. \u0027But do you really think I\u0027d be stupid enough to make a run for it? Where to, for God\u0027s sake!?\u0027\n \u0027As I explained before,\u0027 Khuv reminded him while Vyotsky unfastened the restraining straps on his strait-jacket, \u0027we aren\u0027t too concerned that you\u0027ll try to escape. That would be sheer suicide, and you no longer have reasons to wish to die - if you ever did. What we are concerned about is the damage you might do, maybe even large-scale sabotage. And that could have very grave consequences indeed. Not only for everyone here, but for the entire world!\u0027\n For once Jazz\u0027s expression changed. He slanted his mouth into a humourless smile, laughed gratingly. \u0027A bit melodramatic, aren\u0027t we, Comrade? I think maybe you\u0027ve been watching too many decadent James Bond films!\u0027\n \u0027Do you?\u0027 said Khuv, his slightly slanted eyes narrowing a fraction and becoming that much brighter. \u0027Do you indeed?\u0027\n He took a key from his pocket, turned to the heavy metal door. It was equipped with a lock set centrally in a steel hand-wheel, like a locking device on a bank vault. As Khuv went to insert his key, so the wheel turned through quarter of a circle and the edges of the door cracked open. Khuv stepped back. Someone was coming through from the other side.\n The door opened fully toward the three where they waited, and a handful of technicians and two men dressed in smart civilian clothes came through. One of the two was fat, beaming, jovial: a VIP visitor from Moscow. The other, grave-faced, was small and thin; his face was badly scarred and the hair was absent from the left half of his face and yellow-veined skull. Jazz had seen him before; he was Viktor Luchov, Direktor of the Perchorsk Projekt - a survivor of Perchorsk Incidents One and Two.\n Brief greetings were exchanged between Khuv and these two men, and then the larger party went on its way. Then Jazz and his escorts passed through the door and Khuv locked it behind them.\n Beyond the door the complex took on an entirely different aspect. By comparison, the damage on the approach to this area had been superficial. Jazz stared and tried to make sense of the chaos he saw there. The evidence of terrific heat was apparent everywhere: stanchions were blackened and in places eaten half-way through; the floor-plates were missing entirely, had been replaced with timbers; the face of the exterior rock wall -literally the mountain itself - was black, dull and lumpy, like lava frozen in its course. A metal chair or desk -difficult to tell which - and a steel cabinet projected in twisted ruin half out of a massive nodule of lava which was in turn welded to the wall; and above this anomalous nodule a cylindrical shaft maybe twelve feet in diameter had been drilled through the rock upwards at an angle of forty-five degrees, from the lip of which the lava could be seen in large part to have issued.\n Jazz looked again at the dark throat of the shaft, wondered how it could have been cut and where it went. He reached up a hand to touch the side of the rim where the shaft opened into the corridor; the rock was smooth as glass, not lumpy like the volcanic flow from the shaft\u0027s lip ... Aware that Khuv was watching him, Jazz shot him an inquisitive glance.\n Tm told that used to have a square cross-section, whose sides were something less than two metres,\u0027 Khuv informed. \u0027Also that it was lined with a perfect mirror of a very high density glass on impervious ceramic, giving almost 100 per cent reflectivity. After what you have termed the Perchorsk Incident, this is what remained of the shaft. I suppose you might say that this is what comes of trying to pass a round peg through a square hole, eh?\u0027 And before Jazz could answer: \u0027Of course, I wasn\u0027t here when this happened. You see, I have my own job, Michael - you\u0027ll forgive my familiarity? - with a branch of the Service whose work you would find entirely unbelievable. It is that E-Branch of which we\u0027ve already spoken.\u0027\n Jazz said nothing, continued to glance all about, tried to take in all he was seeing and hearing. What good that would do him he couldn\u0027t say, but it was all part of his training. \u0027E-Branch, yes, Michael,1 Khuv went on. \u0027You English have an E-Branch, too, you know - which is why we were so interested to know if you were a member of that organization. If you had been - \u0027 he shrugged - \u0027then we would have been obliged to dispose of you from the outset.\u0027\n Jazz raised his customary eyebrow.\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Khuv, casually, \u0027for we couldn\u0027t allow you to transmit - neither telepathically nor any other way - knowledge of this place to the outside world. That, too, could be very dangerous; so much so that it might even conceivably bring about World War III!\u0027\n \u0027More melodramatics,\u0027 Jazz murmured.\n Khuv sighed deeply. \u0027You will understand - eventually,\u0027 he said. \u0027But first find yourself a place to sit for a while, and I\u0027ll tell you everything you were sent here to discover.\n You see, I actually want you to understand everything. You\u0027ll know why later.\u0027\n Khuv perched himself on a knob of black rock while Jazz found a seat on the side of the steel cabinet where it leaned out of the lava nodule. Vyotsky remained standing, saying nothing, merely watching. The Projekt\u0027s air-conditioning whispered faintly, distantly, and apart from this and Khuv\u0027s voice, all was silent. Khuv spoke very softly and the effect was eerie: like a whisper echoing in some deeply buried alien vault.\n \u0027You must blame all you see here primarily on the USA\u0027s SDI or Star Wars scenario,\u0027 he began. \u0027Of course, those terms hadn\u0027t been thought of as early as that, but the idea was there sure enough. We knew that much from standard intelligence sources. As for the Perchorsk Pro-jekt: it was little more than a clever theory until America started dreaming up its space defence initiative. But after that it was the same old story: we had to have an even better defence system. As with bigger and better bombs, so with defence systems. If Star Wars could mean the loss of 95 per cent of our nuclear capability, then we had to have something which cancelled out the West\u0027s strike capability utterly.\n \u0027Perchorsk was to have been the first step, the proving ground. If it had worked, then similar installations would have been constructed all around Russia\u0027s borders. The satellite countries might perhaps have to fend for themselves in any future holocaust, but the Soviet heartland would be defended - completely! Do you follow me so far?\u0027\n Jazz cocked his head on one side. \u0027You\u0027re telling me that this,\u0027 he glanced here and there, all about, \u0027wasn\u0027t intended as a weapon, right?\u0027\n \u0027Exactly,\u0027 Khuv nodded. \u0027It was to have been the opposite of a weapon: a shield. An impenetrable umbrella over the head of the central Soviet Union. Ah! But now I see how interested you are; finally we have a little animation! Well, and should I proceed?\u0027\n \u0027By all means,\u0027 said Jazz at once. \u0027Do go on.\u0027\n Khuv settled into his story:\n \u0027Don\u0027t ask me about the mechanics of the thing; I\u0027m a - well, a \"policeman\", not a physicist! Franz Ayvaz was the brains and driving force behind Perchorsk, and Viktor Luchov was his second-in-command. Ayvaz, as you may already know, was our top man in Particle Beam Acceleration and various associated fields of research; in his younger days he\u0027d been a leading pioneer of laser technology; his credentials were impeccable, and his theory -on paper at least - seemed to be exactly what the defence staff was looking for. A dual-purpose force-field to shut out incoming missiles and render their nuclear capacity entirely harmless.\n \u0027That\u0027s how the Perchorsk Projekt was born five years ago, and this is where it died three years later. Ayvaz died with it, and Luchov is still here gathering information, piecing it all together and seeing if there\u0027s anything that can be salvaged. As to what happened exactly:\n \u0027What was supposed to happen was this:\n \u0027A beam was to be generated down below in the lower levels. That\u0027s where most of the hardware used to be. Accelerated to the limits of tolerance and excited by atomic bombardment, it would be released up this shaft and emitted like an enormous laser into the ravine. Where the shaft emerged into the ravine, a nest of mirrors would divide the beam into a fan shape which would be waved across the sky and into space. It was to be a test, that\u0027s all. The very first of a series.\n \u0027Alas, there was a failure in the motors which governed the movement of the exterior mirrors. They jammed in the worst possible position at the worst possible moment.\n Also, the scientists here had been under pressure; their work had been hurried and performed in conditions which weren\u0027t the best; a full range of failsafe devices had not been incorporated. Do you know what happens, Michael, if you plug the barrel of a gun, load it and pull the trigger? But ridiculous to ask a question like that of a man who is an expert in firearms! Of course you know what happens.\n \u0027Well, and that\u0027s what happened here. There was a colossal blow-back. Energies sufficient to fill an arc of space covering from Afghanistan to Franz Josef Land were trapped and confined within the shaft and redirected back to their source. There was a collision of awesome forces, the instantaneous generation of incredible temperatures, and in the immediate vicinity of the beam matter itself underwent some radical changes. Now of course that is my non-technical layman\u0027s explanation. You will need to talk to Luchov if you want more - but I guarantee you wouldn\u0027t understand him. Not unless there\u0027s a lot more to you than we\u0027ve discovered, anyway.\n \u0027So... that was the Perchorsk Incident, or \"pi\" as your people in the West have christened it. The shambles you see here is not one hundredth part of the devastation which occurred down below, where we\u0027ll be going in a moment. And as for loss of life: we paid a terrible toll for our haste, Michael, a terrible toll. But not so terrible as the toll we may still have to pay...\u0027\n With those enigmatic words still echoing, Khuv abruptly stood up. \u0027Let\u0027s go deeper,\u0027 his words were clipped, urgent, \u0027right now! Two levels down, where perhaps you\u0027ll be able to get the feel of what it was really like.\u0027 Jazz got to his feet and followed on, and once again Vyotsky formed their tail along the perimeter a little way, then down wide, heavy-beamed wooden stairs into what could only be termed a region of sheer fantasy.\n With one hand lightly on the rail, Jazz stared into the dim recesses of a great disorder, a weird chaos. The lighting was poor here, perhaps deliberately so, for certainly what little could be seen was - to say the least -disconcerting, even frightening. Down through a tangle of warped plastic, fused stone and blistered metal they passed, where on both sides amazingly consistent, smooth-bored tunnels some two or three feet in diameter wound and twisted like wormholes through old timbers, except they cut through solid rock and crumpled girders. And the thought came to the British agent that something, some vast force, had attempted to bring about a certain homogeneity here, had tried to make every different thing into one similar thing. Or had tried to deform everything beyond recognition. It was not so much that the various materials had been fused by heat and fire, rather that they seemed to have been folded-in, like the ingredients of dough, or different coloured plasticines in some monstrous child\u0027s hands.\n \u0027It gets worse,\u0027 said Khuv quietly, leading the way lower still. Those strange tunnels there were not \"cut\" through the magmass - that\u0027s what Viktor Luchov calls this jumble of matter, incidentally, a \"magmass\" - they were eaten into it by energy shearing off from the blow-back! We can only guess at the extent of the damage if the installation had been built on the surface.\u0027\n The stairs descended to a veritable bed of magmass, only levelling out when they reached a vertical wall of unbroken rock like the face of a cliff. Here the timbers underfoot formed a walkway which turned to the right through an angle of ninety degrees and ran parallel with the foot of the looming wall of rock. Under the boards the floor was chaotically humped and anomalous, where different materials had so flowed into each other as to become unrecognizable in their original forms. And through all the congealed mass of this earthly and yet unfamiliar material ran those irregular wormhole energy channels, very like the indiscriminate burrows of rock-boring crustaceans in the sea, but on a gigantic scale.\n \u0027\"Eaten,\"\u0027 Jazz pondered over the word. \u0027You said these holes were \"eaten\" into this stuff - but by what?\u0027\n \u0027Rather, shall we say, \"converted\"?\u0027 Khuv glanced at him. \u0027Perhaps that paints a truer picture, to say that the material was converted into energy. But if you\u0027ll be patient I can show you a far better example. We are going to the place where the pile used to be. That, too, was eaten - or converted, if you prefer.\u0027\n \u0027Pile?\u0027 For the moment Khuv\u0027s meaning didn\u0027t register in Jazz\u0027s confused thoughts.\n \u0027The atomic pile which was the Projekt\u0027s main source of power,\u0027 the Russian explained. \u0027The backlash ate it -utterly. Yes, and then it seems it ate itself!\u0027\n Jazz might have questioned that statement, too, but now looming on the left of the walkway a huge, perfectly circular hole appeared in the face of the black wall of rock. Light issued from this tunnel where it angled steeply downward, and Jazz didn\u0027t need telling that this was a continuation of the shaft seen in the upper level, which once - and only once - had carried a fearsome beam of energy to the outside world.\n The walkway turned left into the mouth of the shaft, became a stairway once again. Blinding white light was painful after the comparative gloom of the two levels through which the party had descended. Ahead and below, the far end of the shaft was a white disk of glaring brilliance, with its lower rim blacked out by the walkway\u0027s platform. Jazz shielded his eyes, saw a young Russian soldier in uniform leaning against the curved wall. The man at once came upright, snapped to attention, slapped the stock of his Kalashnikov rifle in salute. \u0027At ease,\u0027 said Khuv. \u0027We need some glasses.\u0027\n The soldier leaned his rifle against the wall, groped in a satchel slung over his shoulder. He produced three pairs of tinted cellophane spectacles with cardboard rims, like the glasses Jazz had once been issued to view a 3-D film.\n \u0027For the light,\u0027 Khuv explained, though there was hardly any need. \u0027It can be blinding until you\u0027re used to it.\u0027 He put on his glasses.\n Jazz did the same, followed Khuv down the stairway built through the glass-smooth cylindrical shaft. From behind them came a clatter as the soldier\u0027s rifle toppled over when he went to pick it up, then Karl Vyotsky\u0027s husky, threatening voice hissing: \u0027Idiot! Dolt! Would you like to do a month of nights?\u0027\n \u0027No, Sir!\u0027 the young soldier gasped. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, sir. It slipped.\u0027\n \u0027You damn well should be sorry!\u0027 Vyotsky rasped. \u0027And not only for the rifle. What the hell are you here for anyway? To check passes for security, that\u0027s what! Do you know that man in front, and me, and the man with us?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes, sir!\u0027 the young soldier quavered. The man in front is Comrade Major Khuv, sir, and you too are an officer of the KGB. The other man is ... is ... a friend of yours, sir!\u0027\n \u0027Clown!\u0027 Vyotsky hissed. \u0027He is not my friend. Nor yours. Nor anyone\u0027s in the whole damned place!\u0027\n \u0027Sir, I-\u0027\n \u0027Now hold that rifle out in front of you,\u0027 Vyotsky snapped. \u0027Arm\u0027s length, finger through the trigger-guard, finger under the backsight. What the hell...? Arm\u0027s length, I said! Now hold it, and count to two hundred, slowly! Then get back to attention. And if I ever catch you slacking off again, I\u0027ll feed you into that white hell down there dick-first, got it?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Sir!\u0027\n Following Khuv toward the white glare at the end of the shaft, Jazz murmured sourly: \u0027A disciplinarian, our Karl.\u0027\n Khuv glanced back, shook his head. \u0027Not really. Discipline isn\u0027t his strong point. But sadism is. I hate to admit it, but it does have its uses...\u0027\n At the end of the shaft there was a railed landing where the stairs levelled out and turned to the left. Khuv paused on the landing with Jazz alongside. Waiting for Vyotsky, they gazed down on a fantastic scene.\n It was like being in a cavern, but there was no way it could be mistaken for any ordinary sort of cave. Instead, Jazz saw that the rock had been hollowed out in the shape of a perfect sphere, a giant bubble in the base of the mountain - but a bubble at least one hundred and twenty feet in diameter! The curving, shiny-black wall all around was glass-smooth except for the wormholes which riddled it everywhere, even in the domed ceiling. The mouth of the shaft where Jazz and Khuv stood pointed downward at ninety degrees directly at the centre of the space, which also happened to be the source of the light. And that was the most fantastic thing of all.\n For that central area was a ball of light some thirty feet across, and it was apparently suspended there, mid-way between the domed ceiling and the upward curving floor. A sphere of brilliance hanging motionless within a sphere of air, and the whole trick neatly buried under the foot of a mountain!\n Narrowing his eyes against the glare, which was powerful even through the tinted lenses of his spectacles. Jazz slowly became aware that the spherical cavern contained other things. A spidery web of scaffolding had been built half-way up the wall and all around the central blaze. The scaffolding supported a platform of timbers which circled the weird light source, reminding Jazz vaguely of the ring system round Saturn. Leading inwards from the ring, a walkway proceeded right to the edge of the sphere of light.\n Externally, backed up against the black, wormhole-riddled walls - evenly spaced around the perimeter and massively supported on a framework of stanchions - three twin-mounted Katushev cannons pointed their muzzles point-blank at the blinding centre. Crews were in position, their sights aligned on the sphere, their faces white and alien-looking with headset antennae and insect goggle-eyes trained on the dazzling target.\n Between the guns and the sphere stood a ten-foot-high electrified fence, with a gate where the timber walkway spanned the gap between the Saturn\u0027s rings and the centre. There was some motion down there, nervous and jumpy, but not much; the stench of fear was so thick in the supposedly conditioned air that Jazz could almost feel it like slime on his skin.\n He gripped the wooden rail, let the entire scene print itself indelibly on his brain, said: \u0027What in the name of all that\u0027s...?\u0027 He turned his head to stare at Khuv. \u0027I saw the arrival of those guns that night you caught me. The electrified fence, too. I thought they were meant to defend Perchorsk against attack from the outside, which struck me as making no sense. But from the inside? Christ, that doesn\u0027t make much sense either! I mean, what is that thing? And why are those men down there so desperately afraid of it?\u0027\n And suddenly, without any prompting, he knew the answer before it came. Not all of the answer but enough. Suddenly everything fitted: all he\u0027d seen, and all Khuv had told him. And especially the flying monstrosity that the American fighters had burned to hell and sent crashing to earth in a ball of flame from high over the west coast of the Hudson Bay. And speaking of flames, wasn\u0027t that a four-man flame-thrower squad down there on the Saturn\u0027s-rings platform? Yes, it was.\n Vyotsky had come up quietly behind Jazz and Khuv where they stood at the rail. He put a huge hand on Jazz\u0027s shoulder, causing him to start. \u0027As to what it is, British,\u0027 he said, \u0027it\u0027s some sort of gate or door. And as such we\u0027re not frightened of it.\u0027 But Jazz noted how for once Vyotksy\u0027s tone was muted, perhaps even a little awed.\n \u0027Karl is right,\u0027 said Khuv. \u0027No, we\u0027re not frightened of the Gate itself - but I defy any sane person not to fear the things that sometimes come through it!\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iii-the-source-necroscope-3/page-3.html","bookId":1518,"book":{"id":1518,"title":"Necroscope III: The Source (Necroscope #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The series starts to explore the origins of the Wamphyri manifestation on Earth.
