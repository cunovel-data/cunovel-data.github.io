{"id":42480,"no":10,"title":"SURLY JOE.","content":"\"You wonder why I am called Surly Joe, sir? No, as you say, I hope I don\u0027t deserve the title now; but I did once, and a name like that sticks to a man for life. Well, sir, the fish are not biting at present, and I don\u0027t mind if I tell you how I got it.\" The speaker was a boatman, a man some fifty years old, broad and weather-beaten; he had but one arm. I had been spending a month\u0027s well-earned holiday at Scarborough, and had been making the most of it, sailing or fishing every day. Upon my first arrival I had gone out with the one-armed boatman, and as he was a cheery companion, and his boat, the Grateful Mary, was the best and fastest on the strand, I had stuck to him throughout. The boatmen at our watering-places soon learn when a visitor fixes upon a particular boat, and cease to importune him with offers of a sail; consequently it became an understood thing after a day or two that I was private property, and as soon as I was seen making my way across the wet, soppy sand, which is the one drawback to the pleasure of Scarborough, a shout would at once be raised for Surly Joe. The name seemed a singularly inappropriate one; but it[Pg 232] was not until the very day before I was returning to town that I made any remark on the subject. By this time we had become great allies; for what with a bathe in the morning early, a sail before lunch, and a fishing expedition afterwards, I had almost lived on board the Grateful Mary. The day had been too clear and bright for fishing; the curly-headed, barefooted boy who assisted Joe had grown tired of watching us catch nothing, and had fallen asleep in the bow of the boat; and the motion, as the boat rose and fell gently on the swell, was so eminently provocative of sleep that I had nodded once or twice as I sat with my eyes fixed on my line. Then the happy idea had occurred to me to remark that I wondered why my companion was called by a nickname which seemed so singularly inappropriate. Joe\u0027s offer to tell me how he obtained it woke me at once. I refilled my pipe,—an invariable custom, I observe, with smokers when they are sitting down to listen to a story,—passed my pouch to Joe, who followed my example; and when we had \"lighted up\" Joe began: \"Well, sir, it\u0027s about twelve years ago. I was a strong, active chap then—not that I aint strong now, for I can shove a boat over the sandbar with any man on the shore—but I aint as active as I were. I warn\u0027t called Surly Joe then, and I had my two arms like other men. My nickname then was Curly; \u0027cause, you see, my hair won\u0027t lay straight on my head, not when it gets as wet as seaweed. I owned my own boat, and the boys that worked with me[Pg 233] warn\u0027t strangers, like Dick there, but they were my own flesh and blood. I was mighty proud of the two boys: fine straight tough-built lads was they, and as good-plucked uns as any on the shore. I had lost their mother ten years, maybe, before that, and I never thought of giving them another. One of \u0027em was about twelve, just the size of Dick there; the other was a year older. Full of tricks and mischief they was, but good boys, sir, and could handle the boat nigh as well as I could. There was one thing they couldn\u0027t do, sir—they couldn\u0027t swim. I used to tell \u0027em they ought to learn; but there, you see, I can\u0027t swim myself, and out of all the men and boys on this shore I don\u0027t suppose one in twenty on \u0027em can swim. Rum, aint it, sir? All their lives in the water or on the water, seeing all these visitors as comes here either swimming or learning to swim, and yet they won\u0027t try. They talks about instinks; I don\u0027t believe in instinks, else everybody who\u0027s got to pass his life on the water would learn to swim, instead of being just the boys as never does learn. That year, sir, I was doing well. There was a gentleman and his wife and darter used to use my boat regular; morning and afternoon they\u0027d go out for a sail whenever it warn\u0027t too rough for the boat to put out. I don\u0027t think the old gentleman and lady cared so much for it; but they was just wrapped up in the girl, who was a pale, quiet sort o\u0027 girl, who had come down to the sea for her health. She was wonderful fond of the sea, and a deal o\u0027 good it did her; she[Pg 234] warn\u0027t like the same creature after she had been here two months. \"It was a roughish sort of afternoon, with squalls from the east, but not too rough to go out: they was to go out at four o\u0027clock, and they came down punctual; but the gentleman says, when he gets down: \"\u0027We have just got a telegram, Joe, to say as a friend is coming down by the five-o\u0027clock train, and we must be at the station to meet her, she being an invalid; but I don\u0027t want Mary to lose her sail, so will trust her with you.\u0027 \"\u0027You\u0027ll take great care of her, Joe, and bring her back safe,\u0027 the mother says, half laughing like; but I could see she were a little anxious about lettin\u0027 her go alone, which had never happened before. \"\u0027I\u0027ll take care of her, ma\u0027am,\u0027 I says; \u0027you may take your oath I\u0027ll bring her back if I comes back myself.\u0027 \"\u0027Good-by, mamma,\u0027 the girl says as she steps on the plank; \u0027don\u0027t you fidget: you know you can trust Joe; and I\u0027ll be back at half-past six to dinner.\u0027 \"Well, sir, as we pushed off I felt somehow responsible like, and although I\u0027d told the boys before that one reef would be enough, I made \u0027em put in another before I hoisted the sail. There warn\u0027t many boats out, for there was more sea on than most visitors care to face; but once fairly outside we went along through it splendid. When we got within a[Pg 235] mile of Fley, I asks her if we should turn, or go on for a bit farther. \"\u0027We shall go back as quick as we\u0027ve come, shan\u0027t we, Joe?\u0027 \"\u0027Just about the same, miss; the wind\u0027s straight on the shore.\u0027 \"\u0027We haven\u0027t been out twenty minutes,\u0027 she says, looking at her watch; \u0027I\u0027d rather go a bit farther.\u0027 \"Well, sir, we ran till we were off the brig. The wind was freshening, and the gusts coming down strong; it was backing round rather to the north too, and the sea was getting up. \"\u0027I a\u0027most think, miss, we\u0027d better run into Filey,\u0027 I says; \u0027and you could go across by the coach.\u0027 \"\u0027But there\u0027s no danger, is there, Joe?\u0027 \"\u0027No, miss, there aint no danger; but we shall get a ducking before we get back; there\u0027s rain in that squall to windward.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, I don\u0027t care a bit for rain, Joe; and the coach won\u0027t get in till half-past seven, and mamma would be in a dreadful fright. Oh, I\u0027d so much rather go on!\u0027 \"I did not say no more, but I put her about, and in another few minutes the squall was down upon us. The rain came against us as if it wanted to knock holes in the boat, and the wind just howled again. A sharper squall I don\u0027t know as ever I was put in. It was so black you couldn\u0027t have seen two[Pg 236] boats\u0027 length. I eased off the sheet, and put the helm up; but something went wrong, and—I don\u0027t know rightly how it was, sir. I\u0027ve thought it over hundreds and hundreds of times, and I can\u0027t reason it out in any sort of form. But the \u0027sponsibility of that young gal weighed on me, I expect, and I must somehow ha\u0027 lost my head—I don\u0027t know, I can\u0027t account for it; but there it was, and in less time than it takes me to tell you we were all in the water. Whatever I\u0027d ha\u0027 been before, I was cool enough now. I threw one arm round the gal, as I felt her going, and with the other I caught hold of the side of the boat. We was under water for a moment, and then I made shift to get hold of the rudder as she floated bottom upwards. The boys had stuck to her too, but they couldn\u0027t get hold of the keel; for you know how deep them boats are forward, drawing nigh a foot of water there more than they does astern. However, after a bit, they managed to get down to\u0027rds the stern, and get a hand on the keel about halfway along. They couldn\u0027t come no nigher, because, as you know, the keel of them boats only runs halfway along. \u0027Hould on, lads!\u0027 I shouted; \u0027hould on for your lives! They\u0027ll have seen us from the cliff, and \u0027ll have a lugger out here for us in no time.\u0027 \"I said so to cheer them up; but I knew in my heart that a lugger, to get out with that wind on, would have to run right into t\u0027other side o\u0027 the bay before she could get room enough to weather the[Pg 237] brig. The girl hadn\u0027t spoken a word since the squall struck us, except that she gave a little short cry as the boat went over; and when we came up she got her hands on the rudder, and held on there as well as she could with my help. The squall did not last five minutes; and when it cleared off I could look round and judge of our chances. They weren\u0027t good. There was a party of people on the cliff, and another on the brig, who were making their way out as far as they could on the brig, for it were about half-tide. They must have seen us go over as we went into the squall, for as we lifted I could see over the brig, and there was a man galloping on horseback along the sands to\u0027rds Filey as hard as he could go. We were, maybe, a quarter of a mile off the brig, and I saw that we should drift down on it before a boat could beat out of the bay and get round to us. The sea was breaking on it, as it always does break if there\u0027s ever so little wind from the east, and the spray was flying up fifty feet in places where the waves hit the face of the rock. There aint a worse place on all the coast than this, running as it do nigh a mile out from the head, and bare at low water. The waves broke over the boat heavy, and I had as much as I could do to hold on by one hand to the rudder, which swung backwards and forwards with every wave. As to the boys, I knew they couldn\u0027t hold on if they couldn\u0027t get onto the bottom of the boat; so I shouted to \u0027em to try to climb up. But they couldn\u0027t do it, sir; they\u0027d tried already, over and[Pg 238] over again. It would ha\u0027 been easy enough in calm water; but with the boat rolling and such waves going over her, and knocking them back again when they\u0027d half got up, it was too much for \u0027em. If I\u0027d ha\u0027 been free I could have got \u0027em up by working round to the side opposite \u0027em, and given them a hand to haul them up; but as it was, with only one hand free, it took me all my time to hold on where I was. The girl saw it too, for she turned her face round to me, and spoke for the first time. \"\u0027Let me go, please,\u0027 says she, \u0027and help your boys.\u0027 \"\u0027I can\u0027t do it,\u0027 said I. \u0027I\u0027ve got to hold you till we\u0027re both drowned together.\u0027 \"I spoke short and hard, sir; for, if you\u0027ll believe me, I was actually beginning to hate that gal. There was my own two boys a-struggling for their lives, and I couldn\u0027t lend a hand to help \u0027em, because I was hampered by that white-faced thing. She saw it in my face, for she gave a sort of little cry, and said: \"\u0027Oh, do—do let me go!\u0027 \"I didn\u0027t answer a word, but held on all the harder. Presently Bill—he was my youngest boy—sang out: \"\u0027Father, can\u0027t you get round and lend us a hand to get up? I can\u0027t hold on much longer.\u0027 \"\u0027I can\u0027t help you, Bill,\u0027 says I. \u0027I\u0027ve given my promise to take this young woman back, and I must keep my word. Her life\u0027s more precious to her[Pg 239] father than yours is to me, no doubt, and she\u0027s got to be saved.\u0027 \"It was cruel of me, sir, and altogether unjust, and I knew it was when I said it, but I couldn\u0027t help it. I felt as if I had a devil in me. I was just mad with sorrow and hopelessness, and yet each word seemed to come as cold and hard from me as if it was frozen. For a moment she didn\u0027t move, and then, all of a sudden like, she gave a twist out of my arms and went straight down. I grabbed at her, and just got hold of her cloak and pulled her up again. She never moved after that, but just lay quiet on my arm as if she was dead. Her head was back, half in, half out of the water; and it was only by the tears that run down sometimes through her eyelids, and by a little sob in her breast, that I knew that she was sensible. \"Presently Bill says, \u0027Good-by, father. God bless you!\u0027 and then he let go his hold and went down. Five minutes afterwards, maybe, though it seemed a week to me, Jack did the same. \"There we was—the girl and I—alone. \"I think now, sir, looking back upon it, as I was mad then. I felt somehow as that the gal had drowned my two boys; and the devil kept whispering to me to beat her white face in, and then to go with her to the bottom. I should ha\u0027 done it too, but my promise kept me back. I had sworn she should get safe to shore if I could, and it seemed to me that included the promise that I would do my[Pg 240] best for us both to get there. I was getting weak now, and sometimes I seemed to wander, and my thoughts got mixed up, and I talked to the boys as if they could hear me. Once or twice my hold had slipped, and I had hard work enough to get hold again. I was sensible enough to know as it couldn\u0027t last much longer, and, talking as in my sleep, I had told the boys I would be with \u0027em in a minute or two, when a sound of shouting quite close roused me up sudden. \"Then I saw we had drifted close to the brig. Some men had climbed along, taking hold hand-in-hand when they passed across places where the sea was already breaking over, and bringing with them the rope which, as I afterwards heard, the man on horseback had brought back from Filey. It was a brave deed on their part, sir, for the tide was rising fast. When they saw I lifted my head and could hear them they shouted that they would throw me the rope, and that I must leave go of the boat, which would have smashed us to pieces, as I knew, if she had struck the rocks with us. Where they were standing the rock was full six feet above the sea; but a little farther it shelved down, and each wave ran three feet deep across the brig. They asked me could I swim; and when I shook my head, for I was too far gone to speak now, one of \u0027em jumped in with the end of the rope. He twisted it round the two of us, and shouted to his friends to pull. It was time, for we weren\u0027t much above a boat\u0027s length from[Pg 241] the brig. Three of the chaps as had the rope run down to the low part of the rock and pulled together, while another two kept hold of the end of the rope and kept on the rock, so as to prevent us all being washed across the brig together. I don\u0027t remember much more about it. I let go the boat, sank down at once, as if the girl and I had been lead, felt a tug of the rope, and then, just as the water seemed choking me, a great smash, and I remember nothing else. When I came to my right senses again I was in a bed at Filey. I had had a bad knock on the head, and my right arm, which had been round the girl, was just splintered. They took it off that night. The first thing as they told me when I came round was that the gal was safe. I don\u0027t know whether I was glad or sorry to hear it. I was glad, because I had kept my promise and brought her back alive. I was sorry, because I hated her like pison. Why should she have been saved when my two boys was drowned? She was well-plucked, was that gal, for she had never quite lost her senses; and the moment she had got warm in bed with hot blankets, and suchlike she wanted to get dry clothes and to go straight on to Scarborough in a carriage. However, the doctor would not hear of it, and she wrote a little letter saying as she was all right; and a man galloped off with it on horseback, and got there just as they had got a carriage to the door to drive over to Filey to ask if there was any news there about the boat. They came over and slept there, and she went[Pg 242] back with them next day. I heard all this afterwards, for I was off my head, what with the blow I had got and one thing and another, before I had been there an hour. And I raved and cussed at the girl, they tell me, so that they wouldn\u0027t let her father in to see me. \"It was nigh a fortnight before I came to myself, to find my arm gone, and then I was another month before I was out of bed. They came over to Filey when I was sensible, and I hear they had got the best doctor over from Scarborough to see me, and paid everything for me till I was well, but I wouldn\u0027t see them when they came. I was quite as bitter against her as I had been when I was in the sea drowning; and I was so fierce when they talked of coming in that the doctor told them it would make me bad again if they came. So they went up to London, and when I could get about they sent me a letter, the gal herself and her father and mother, thanking me, I suppose; but I don\u0027t know, for I just tore \u0027em into pieces without reading them. Then a lawyer of the town here came to me and said he\u0027d \u0027struction to buy me a new boat, and to buy a \u0027nuity for me. I told him his \u0027nuity couldn\u0027t bring my boys back again, and that I warn\u0027t going to take blood-money; and as to the boat, I\u0027d knock a hole in her and sink her if she came. A year after that lawyer came to me again, and said he\u0027d more \u0027structions; and I told him though I\u0027d only one arm left I was man enough still to knock his head off his shoulders,[Pg 243] and that I\u0027d do it if he came to me with his \u0027structions or anything else. \"By this time I\u0027d settled down to work on the shore, and had got the name of Surly Joe. Rightly enough, too. I had one of them planks with wheels that people use to get in and out of the boats; and as the boatmen on the shore was all good to me, being sorry for my loss, and so telling my story to people as went out with them, I got enough to live on comfortable, only there was nothing comfortable about me. I wouldn\u0027t speak a word, good or bad, to a soul for days together, unless it was to swear at anyone as tried to talk to me. I hated everyone, and myself wuss nor all. I was always cussing the rocks that didn\u0027t kill me, and wondering how many years I\u0027d got to go on at this work before my turn came. Fortunately I\u0027d never cared for drink; but sometimes I\u0027d find my thoughts too hard for me, and I\u0027d go and drink glass after glass till I tumbled under the table. \"At first my old mates tried to get me round, and made offers to me to take a share in their boats, or to make one in a fishing voyage; but I would not hear them, and in time they dropped off one by one, and left me to myself, and for six years there wasn\u0027t a surlier, wuss-conditioned, lonelier chap, not in all England, than I was. Well, sir, one day—it was just at the beginning of the season, but was too rough a day for sailing—I was a-sitting down on the steps of a machine doing nothing, just wondering and won[Pg 244]dering why things was as they was, when two little gals cum up. One was, maybe, five, and the other a year younger. I didn\u0027t notice as they\u0027d just cum away from the side of a lady and gentleman. I never did notice nothing that didn\u0027t just concern me; but I did see that they had a nurse not far off. The biggest girl had great big eyes, dark and soft, and she looked up into my face, and held out a broken wooden spade and a bit of string, and says she, \u0027Sailor-man, please mend our spade.\u0027 I was struck all of a heap like; for though I had been mighty fond of little children in the old days, and was still always careful of lifting them into boats, my name and my black looks had been enough, and none of them had spoken to me for years. I felt quite strange like when that child spoke out to me, a\u0027most like what I\u0027ve read Robinson Crusoe, he as was wrecked on the island, felt when he saw the mark of a foot. \"I goes to hold out my hand, and then I draws it back, and says, gruff, \u0027Don\u0027t you see I aint got but one hand? Go to your nurse.\u0027 \"I expected to see her run right off; but she didn\u0027t, but stood as quiet as may be, with her eyes looking up into my face. \"\u0027Nurse can\u0027t mend spade; break again when Nina digs. Nina will hold spade together, sailor-man tie it up strong.\u0027 \"I didn\u0027t answer at once; but I saw her lip quiver, and it was plain she had been crying just before; so I put my hand into my pocket and brings out a bit[Pg 245] of string, for the stuff she\u0027d got in her hand was of no account; and I says, in a strange sort of voice, as I hardly knew as my own, \u0027All right, missy, I\u0027ll tie it.\u0027 \"So she held the broken pieces together, and I ties \u0027em up with the aid of my hand and my teeth, and makes a strong, ship-shape job of it. I did it sitting on the bottom step, with a child standing on each side watching me. When I had done it the eldest took it, and felt it. \"\u0027That is nice and strong,\u0027 she said; \u0027thank you. Annie, say thank you.\u0027 \"\u0027T\u0027ank you,\u0027 she said; and, with a little pat on my arm as a good-by, the little ones trotted away to a nurse sitting some little distance off. \"It may seem a little thing to you, sir, just a half-minute\u0027s talk to a child; but it warn\u0027t a little thing to me. It seemed regularly to upset me like; and I sat there thinking it over and wondering what was come over me, till an hour afterwards they went past me with their nurse; and the little things ran up to me and said, \u0027The spade\u0027s quite good now—good-by, sailor-man!\u0027 and went on again. So I shook it off and went to my work; for as the tide rose the wind dropped, and a few boats went out; and thinking what a fool I was, was gruffer and surlier than ever. \"Next morning I was lending a mate a hand painting a boat, when I saw the two children coming along the sand again, and I wondered to myself[Pg 246] whether they would know me again, or think any more of me, and though I wanted them to do so I turned my back to the way they was coming, and went on with my painting. Somehow I felt wonderful glad when I heard their little feet come, pattering along the sand, and they sang out: \"\u0027Good-morning, sailor-man!\u0027 \"\u0027Good-morning!\u0027 says I, short-like, as if I didn\u0027t want no talk; and I goes on with my work without turning round. \"Just then one of the men at the boats hails me. \"\u0027Joe, there\u0027s a party coming down.\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027m busy,\u0027 shouts I back; \u0027shove the plank out yourself.\u0027 \"The children stopped quiet by me for a minute or two, watching me at work, and then the eldest says: \"\u0027May we get inside the boat, Joe? we\u0027ve never been inside a boat, and we do want to so much.\u0027 \"\u0027My hand is all covered with paint,\u0027 says I, making a fight with myself against giving in. \"Then the little one said: \"\u0027Oo stoop down, Joe; sissy and me take hold round oor neck; then oo stand up and we det in.\u0027 \"Well, sir, the touch of their little arms and those soft little faces against my cheeks as they got in fairly knocked me over, and it was some time before I could see what I was doing. \"Once in, they never stopped talking. They asked about everything, and I had to answer them;[Pg 247] and as I got accustomed to it the words came freer, till I was talking away with them as if I had known \u0027em all my life. Once I asked them didn\u0027t their papa and mamma ever take \u0027em out for a sail, and they shook their heads and said mammy hated the sea, and said it was a cruel sea; by which I judged as she must have lost someone dear to her by it. \"Well, sir, I must cut a long story short. Those children used to come every day down to talk with me, and I got to look for it regular; and if it was a wet day and they couldn\u0027t come I\u0027d be regular put out by it; and I got to getting apples and cakes in my pockets for them. After a fortnight I took to carrying them across the wet sands and putting them on the stand as I wheeled it out and back with people to the boats. I didn\u0027t do it till they\u0027d asked their mother, and brought back the message that she knew she could trust them with me. \"All this time it never once struck me as strange that their nurse should sit with a baby-brother of theirs at a distance, and let them play with me by the hour together, without calling them away, for I wondered so much at myself, and to find myself telling stories to \u0027em just as I\u0027d do with children who came out sailing with me in the old time, and in knowing as I was so wrapped up in \u0027em that I couldn\u0027t wonder at anything else. Natural like, I changed a good deal in other respects, and I got to give a good-morning to mates as I had scarce spoken with for years; and the moment the children turned[Pg 248] down onto the sands there\u0027d be sure to be a shout of \u0027There\u0027s your little ladies, Joe.\u0027 \"I don\u0027t know why my mates should ha\u0027 been pleased to see me coming round, for I had made myself onpleasant enough on the shore; but they\u0027d made \u0027lowances for me, and they met me as kindly as if I\u0027d cum back from a vyage. They did it just quiet like, and would just say, natural, \u0027Lend us a hand here, Joe, boy,\u0027 or \u0027Give us a shoulder over the bank, Joe,\u0027 and ask me what I thought o\u0027 the weather. It was a hard day for me when, after staying nigh two months, the little ladies came to say good-by. It warn\u0027t as bad as might have been, though, for they were going to stay with some friends near York, and were to come back again in a fortnight before they went back to London. But they kissed me, and cried, and gave me a pipe and a lot o\u0027 \u0027bacca, and I was to think of them whenever I smoked it, and they would be sure to think of me, for they loved me very much. \"That very afternoon, sir, as I was standing by my stage, Jim Saunders—he\u0027d been mate with me before I owned a boat of my own—says out loud: \"\u0027Lor\u0027, here\u0027s my party a-coming down, and I\u0027ve jammed my hand so as I can\u0027t hoist a sail. Who\u0027ll come out and lend me a hand?\u0027 \"Well, everyone says they were busy, and couldn\u0027t come; but I believe now as the whole thing was a got-up plan to get me afloat again; and then Jim turns to me as if a sudden idea had struck him.[Pg 249] \"\u0027Come, Joe, lend us a hand for the sake o\u0027 old times; come along, old chap.\u0027 \"I was taken aback like, and could only say something about my stage; but half a dozen chaps volunteers to look after my stage, and afore I scarce knew what I was after I was bundled aboard the boat; and as the party got in I\u0027m blest if I don\u0027t think as every chap on the shore runs in to help shove her off, and a score of hands was held out just to give me a shake as we started. \"I don\u0027t think I was much good on that vyage, for I went and sat up in the bow, with my back to the others, and my eyes fixed far ahead. \"I needn\u0027t tell you, sir, when I\u0027d once broken the ice I went regular to the sea again, and handed my stage over to a poor fellow who had lost his craft and a leg the winter before. \"One day when I came in from a sail I saw two little figures upon the sands, and it needed no word from anyone to tell me my little ladies had come back. They jumped and clapped their hands when they saw me, and would have run across the water to meet me hadn\u0027t I shouted to them to wait just a minute till I should be with them. \"\u0027We\u0027ve been waiting a long time, Joe. Where have you been?\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027ve been out sailing, missy.\u0027 \"\u0027Joe, don\u0027t you know it\u0027s wicked to tell stories? You told us you should never go on sea any more.\u0027[Pg 250] \"\u0027No more I didn\u0027t think I should, missy; and I don\u0027t suppose I ever should if I hadn\u0027t met you, though you won\u0027t understand that. However, I\u0027ve give up the stage, and have taken to the sea again.\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027m glad of that, Joe,\u0027 the eldest said, \u0027and mamma will be glad too.\u0027 \"\u0027Why should mamma be glad, little one?\u0027 I asked. \"\u0027Mamma will be glad,\u0027 she said positively. \u0027I know she will be glad when I tells her.\u0027 \"We\u0027d sat down by this time, and I began to talk to them about their mamma. Mamma very good, very kind, very pretty, they both agreed; and then they went on telling me about their home in London, and their carriage and amusements. Presently they stopped, and I could see the eldest wanted to say something particular, for she puckered up her forehead as she always did when she was very serious; and then she said, with her hands folded before her, almost as if she was saying a lesson: \"\u0027Mamma very happy woman. She\u0027s got two little girls and baby-brother, and papa love her so much; but there\u0027s one thing keeps her from being quite happy.\u0027 \"\u0027Is there, missy?\u0027 I asked. \u0027She ought to be happy with all these things. What is it?\u0027 \"\u0027Mamma once had someone do a great thing for her. If it hadn\u0027t been for him Nina and sissy and little baby-brother could never have been born, and papa would never have had dear mamma to love;[Pg 251] but it cost the man who did it a great deal—all he cared for; and now he won\u0027t let mamma and papa and us love him and help him; and it makes mamma unhappy when she thinks of it.\u0027 \"Here she had evidently finished what she had heard her mamma say, for her forehead got smooth again, and she began to fill my pockets with sand. \"\u0027It don\u0027t sound likely, missy, that doesn\u0027t,\u0027 I says. \u0027It don\u0027t stand to reason nohow. You can\u0027t have understood what mamma said.\u0027 \"\u0027Mamma said it over and over again, lots of time,\u0027 Nina said. \u0027Nina quite sure she said right.\u0027 \"We didn\u0027t say no more about it then, though after the children had gone I wondered to myself how a chap could go on so foolish as that. Well, sir, three days after come round from Whitby this very boat, the Grateful Mary. She was sent care of Joe Denton; and as that was me, I had her hauled up on the beach till I should hear whose she was. Several visitors that had been out with me had said, promiscuous like, that they should like to have a boat of their own, and I supposed they had bought her at Whitby and sent her down, though why they should have sent her to my care I couldn\u0027t quite see. \"Two days afterwards them children come down, and says: \"\u0027We want you to go through the town to the other cliff with us, Joe.\u0027 \"\u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 says I. \u0027I\u0027m all right talking to you here, missies; but I shouldn\u0027t be a credit to you in[Pg 252] the town, and your pa wouldn\u0027t be best pleased if he was to see you walking about in the streets with a boatman.\u0027 \"\u0027Papa said we might ask you, Joe.\u0027 \"I shook my head, and the little ladies ran off to their nurse, who come back with them and says: \"\u0027Master told me to say he should be pertickler glad if you would go with the young ladies.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, very well,\u0027 I says; \u0027if their pa don\u0027t object, and they wishes it, I\u0027d go with \u0027em anywheres. You wait here a quarter of an hour, while I goes and cleans myself, and I\u0027ll go with you.\u0027 \"When I comes back the youngest takes my hand, and the oldest holds by my jacket, and we goes up into High Street, and across to the other cliff. We goes along till we comes to a pretty little cottage looking over the sea. There was a garden in front, new planted with flowers. \"\u0027Are you sure you are going right?\u0027 says I, when they turned in. \"They nodded, and ran up to the door and turned the handle. \"\u0027Come in, Joe,\u0027 they said; and they dragged me into a parlor, where a lady and gentleman was sitting. \"The gentleman got up. \"\u0027My little girls have spoken so much to me about you, Joe, that I feel that we know each other already.\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, sir, surely,\u0027 says I.[Pg 253] \"\u0027Well, Joe, do you know that I owe you a great deal as to these little girls?\u0027 \"\u0027Bless you, sir, it\u0027s I as owe a great deal to the little missies; they have made a changed man of me, they have; you ask anyone on the shore.\u0027 \"\u0027I hope they have, Joe; for had they not got round your heart, and led you to your better self, I could never have done what I have done, for you would have rendered it useless.\u0027 \"I didn\u0027t say nothing, sir, for I could make neither head nor tail of what he was saying, and, I dessay, looked as surprised as might be. Then he takes a step forward, and he puts a hand on my shoulder, and says he: \"\u0027Joe, have you never guessed who these little girls were?\u0027 \"I looked first at the children, and then at him, and then at the lady, who had a veil down, but was wiping her eyes underneath it. I was downright flummuxed. \"\u0027I see you haven\u0027t,\u0027 the gentleman went on. \u0027Well, Joe, it is time you should know now. I owe to you all that is dear to me in this world, and our one unhappiness has been that you would not hear us, that you had lost everything and would not let us do anything to lighten your blow.\u0027 \"Still, sir, I couldn\u0027t make out what he meant, and began to think that I was mad, or that he was. Then the lady stood up and threw back her veil, and come up in front of me with the tears a-running[Pg 254] down her face; and I fell back a step, and sits down suddenly in a chair, for, sure enough, it was that gal. Different to what I had seen her last, healthy-looking and well—older, in course; a woman now, and the mother of my little ladies. \"She stood before me, sir, with her hands out before her, pleading like. \"\u0027Don\u0027t hate me any more, Joe. Let my children stand between us. I know what you have suffered, and, in all my happiness, the thought of your loneliness has been a trouble, as my husband will tell you. I so often thought of you—a broken, lonely man. I have talked to the children of you till they loved the man that saved their mother\u0027s life. I cannot give you what you have lost, Joe—no one can do that; but you may make us happy in making you comfortable. At least, if you cannot help hating me, let the love I know you bear my children weigh with you.\u0027 \"As she spoke the children were hanging on me; and when she stopped the little one said: \"\u0027Oh, Joe, oo must be dood; oo mustn\u0027t hate mamma, and make her cry!\u0027 \"Well, sir, I know as I need tell you more about it. You can imagine how I quite broke down, like a great baby, and called myself every kind of name, saying only that I thought, and I a\u0027most think so now, that I had been somehow mad from the moment the squall struck the Kate till the time I first met the little girls.[Pg 255] \"When I thought o\u0027 that, and how I\u0027d cut that poor gal to her drowning heart with my words, I could ha\u0027 knelt to her if she\u0027d ha\u0027 let me. At last, when I was quiet, she explained that this cottage and its furniture and the Grateful Mary was all for me; and we\u0027d a great fight over it, and I only gave in when at last she says that if I didn\u0027t do as she wanted she\u0027d never come down to Scarborough with the little ladies no more; but that if I \u0027greed they\u0027d come down regular every year, and that the little girls should go out sailing with me regular in the Grateful Mary. \"Well, sir, there was no arguing against that, was there? So here I am; and next week I expect Miss Mary that was, with her husband, who\u0027s a Parliament man, as she was engaged to be married to at the time of the upset, and my little ladies, who is getting quite big girls too. And if you hadn\u0027t been going away I\u0027d ha\u0027 sailed round the castle tower, and I\u0027d ha\u0027 pointed out the cottage to you. Yes, sir, I see what you are going to ask. I found it lonely there; and I found the widow of a old mate of mine who seemed to think as how she could make me comfortable; and comfortable I am, sir—no words could say how comfortable I am; and do you know, sir, I\u0027m blest if there aint a Joe up there at this identical time, only he\u0027s a very little one, and has got both arms. So you see, sir, I have got about as little right as has any chap in this mortial world to the name of Surly Joe.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3174/87052.html","bookId":860,"book":{"id":860,"title":"Sturdy and Strong","description":"简介： hatever may be said as to distinction of classes in England, it is certain that in no country in the world is the upward path more open to those who brace themselves to climb it than in our own.
