{"id":42477,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. FIRE!","content":"One Saturday evening early in October the boys had been for a long walk down among the marshes. They had told Mrs. Andrews they would be late, and it was past eight o\u0027clock when they came along past the works. \"We shan\u0027t get home at this hour again for some time, I expect,\" George said, \"for they say that we are going to begin to work overtime on Monday, and that the orders are so heavy that it will very likely have to be kept up all through the winter.\" \"I am glad it didn\u0027t begin earlier,\" Bill replied; \"it would have been horrid if we had lost all our walks while the weather was fine. How dark the place looks how it\u0027s shut up, and how quiet and still it is after the rattle we are accustomed to!\" \"Stop a moment,\" George said, putting his hand on his arm. \"What is it, George?\" \"I don\u0027t know. It seemed to me, for a moment, as if I saw the big stack clearly and then it was dark again.\" \"How could that be, George?\" \"I don\u0027t know; it looked to me as if it was a re[Pg 118]flection of light from one of the windows at the back there. There it is again.\" \"Yes, I saw it,\" Bill agreed. \"What can it be?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Bill; let\u0027s run around to the back. There might be—it\u0027s awful to think of—but there might be a fire.\" The boys ran down a narrow lane by the side of the works onto a piece of waste ground behind. \"Look, Bill, look at the glare in the molding-room. There must be fire. Here, help to put this bit of old timber against the wall.\" The piece of wood was placed into position, the two lads climbed up it onto the wall, and dropped into the yard within. Just as they did so there was a clatter of falling glass, followed by a glare of light as a body of flame burst out from one of the windows. \"Let\u0027s ring the dinner-bell, Bill; that will call people\u0027s attention, and then we must do the best we can.\" They ran along until they reached the front gate, and then, seizing the bell-rope, rang it violently. In a minute or two there was a clatter of feet outside, and shouts of \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"There is a fire in the molding-room,\" George shouted; \"run for the engines, someone, and break the gate open. Now come on, Bill.\" The two boys ran towards that part of the building where the flames had been seen, broke a window,[Pg 119] and climbed in. There was an almost stifling smell of burning wood and at a door at the end of the planing-room they could see a light flame flickering through the cracks of the door leading into the molding-room, which was next to it. \"Quick, Bill, screw that leather pipe onto the hydrant. We must stop it from getting through here till the engines come.\" The hydrant communicated with the great tank at the top of the building, and as soon as the hose was screwed on and Bill stood with the nozzle directed towards the burning door, George turned the cock and volumes of water flew out. The first result seemed disastrous. The door was already nearly burned through, and, as the powerful jet flew against it, it seemed to crumble away and a mass of flame darted out from the molding-room. The joists and timbers supporting the floor above the planing-room would have caught at once, but the boys deluged them with water, as also the framework of the door, and then, throwing the stream of water into the blazing workshop, they kept down the flames near the door. The smoke was stifling. \"We shall be choked, George!\" Bill gasped. \"Lie down, Bill. I have heard the air is always better near the ground.\" This they found to be the case, and they were still able to direct the jet of water. But three or four minutes had elapsed when the outer door of the planing-house was unlocked and Bob Grimstone and[Pg 120] several other men rushed in, but were at once driven back by the smoke. George had recognized Grimstone\u0027s voice, and shouted: \"This way, Bob, the fire hasn\u0027t got through yet. Come and lend a hand, for it\u0027s gaining on us in spite of the water. You can breathe if you kneel down.\" Grimstone, with two or three of the men, crawled in and joined the boys. \"What! is it you, George? How on earth did you get here?\" Bob exclaimed. \"We saw a light as we were passing, and got in from behind. When we saw what it was we rang the alarm-bell, and then came on here to do what we could till help came.\" \"You are good-plucked, you are,\" Grimstone said admiringly; \"but I am afraid it\u0027s not much good.\" \"You take the hose, Bob, and keep the rafters drenched there. Bill and I will crawl forward and clear the shavings out of the way if we can. They have caught half a dozen times already.\" The two boys crawled forward, and although the heat was tremendous they managed to clear away the shavings for a considerable distance. The smoke and heat were so great that they were obliged to crawl back into the outer air, where for a while they lay almost insensible. There were crowds of men in the yard now, but most of them were round at the back, powerless to aid at present, and only[Pg 121] watching the flames as they roared through the whole of the windows of the molding-room. Men were hurrying past with buckets of water, and one of them, seeing the condition of the boys, dashed some over their heads and faces, and they presently staggered to their feet. It was now a quarter of an hour since they had first given the alarm, and they were just about to re-enter the planing-shop to rejoin Bill when they met him and his comrades coming out. \"All the water\u0027s gone,\" he said; \"if the engines aint here in a minute or two it will be too late.\" But just at that moment there was a cheer outside, and immediately afterwards a fire-engine dashed through the gate. Grimstone ran up to the firemen as they leaped off. \"The great thing,\" he said, \"is to prevent it spreading from that shop into this. We have been keeping it back till now, but the tank has just run dry.\" While the other firemen were fitting the hose to the fire-plug just outside the gates one of them made his way into the planing-room to ascertain the exact position of affairs. \"Quick, lads,\" he said; \"there\u0027s no time to be lost; the fire is making its way through. Another five minutes and we should have been too late to save any of this block. Is there any communication through the upper floors?\" he asked Grimstone. \"Yes, there is a door on each floor,\"[Pg 122] \"Have you got any empty sacks about the place?\" \"Yes, there is a pile of them in there.\" The fireman gave instructions to one of his comrades, while he himself made his way into the planing-room with the hose; the other got out the sacks, and assisted by Grimstone and some of the hands drenched them with water, and then proceeding to the door on the first floor piled them against it. \"It is hot already,\" he said as he laid his hand upon it. \"Now, do you men bring me buckets of water. Keep the sacks drenched till another engine comes up.\" George and Bill, finding they could be of no more use, made their way out to the back and joined the crowd watching the flames, which had already spread to the first floor. They were, however, with the rest of the lookers-on, speedily turned out of the yard by the police, who, having now arrived in sufficient strength, proceeded at once to clear the premises of all save a score or two of men who were engaged in assisting the firemen. As the boys went out through the front gate another engine dashed up at full speed, dropping lighted cinders on its way. \"Hurray!\" Bill said; \"this is a steamer. I expect they will do now.\" Then the boys made their way round again to the back, and by means of the pieces of timber established themselves on the wall, where they were soon[Pg 123] joined by a number of others, and watched the struggle with the flames. In half an hour six engines were on the spot; but even this force had no visible effect upon the flames in that portion of the building in which they had taken possession, and the firemen turned the whole of their efforts to prevent it from spreading. The party wall dividing it from the main building was a very strong one; but so hot had it become that the floor boards touching it were over and over again in flames. A score of men with saws and axes cut away the flooring adjoining the doors on the first and second stories. The planing-room was fortunately not boarded. While a portion of the fire brigade worked unceasingly in preventing the spread of the flames in this direction, the rest turned their attention to the great wood piles, which were repeatedly ignited by the fragments of burning wood. Presently the roof fell in, and the flames shot up high into the air, but grand as the sight was, the boys did not wait any longer looking on. Their faces smarted severely from the heat to which they had been exposed; their hands had been a good deal burned by the shavings; their hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes were singed, and the eyeballs ached with the glare. \"I will run home now, Bill; mother will likely enough hear of the fire, and as we said we should be back soon after eight she will be getting anxious.\"[Pg 124] \"I will go and tell her it\u0027s all right; you stop and see the end of it here.\" But this George would not hear of. \"Very well, then, I will go with you. I must get some grease or something to put on my face and hands; they are smarting awfully.\" Mrs. Andrews gave an exclamation of surprise and alarm as the boys entered. The irritation of the wood smoke had so much inflamed their eyes that they could scarcely see out of them, and their faces looked like pieces of raw beef. \"Whatever has happened, boys?\" she exclaimed. \"There\u0027s a great fire at Penrose\u0027s, mother; it broke out just as we were passing, so we stopped to help for a bit, and then came home to tell you, thinking that you might be anxious.\" \"A fire at the works!\" Mrs. Andrews exclaimed; \"that is dreadful. Dreadful for Mr. Penrose, and for all of you who work there; more, perhaps, for you than for him, for no doubt he is insured, and you may be out of work for months. Thank God I have plenty of work, so I dare say we shall be able to tide it over.\" \"It is not all burned, mother; only the molding-shop and the floors above it are on fire at present, and as there are six fire-engines at work, and they keep on arriving every minute, I hope they will save the rest; and now, mother, what can we do to our faces and hands, they are smarting awfully?\"[Pg 125] \"Dear me, George, are you burnt? I thought you were only dreadfully hot.\" \"We feel hot, mother, just as if our faces were being roasted.\" \"I will get some oil, that will be the best thing,\" Mrs. Andrews said, hurrying away to the kitchen, and coming back with a piece of cotton-wool, and some olive-oil in a cup. \"You are burned, George. Why, child, your hair is all singed, and your eyebrows and eyelashes. Why, what have you been doing to yourselves? There could have been no occasion to put your heads into the flames like that. Why, your hands are worse still; they are quite blistered. I had better wrap them up in cotton-wool.\" \"It\u0027s the inside that\u0027s the worst, mother; perhaps if you put a bit of cotton-wool there and tie it round the back it will do; we can\u0027t go out with our hands all swaddled round like that. And now, please, directly you have done we want to go down again to see the fire. Just you go up to the road corner, mother. It\u0027s a grand sight, I can tell you.\" \"We will have tea first,\" Mrs. Andrews said decidedly; \"everything has been ready except pouring the water in since eight o\u0027clock, and it\u0027s a quarter past nine now. After we have done I will put on my bonnet and walk down with you as near as I can get. I am not going to lose you out of my sight again.\" So after their meal they went down together, but[Pg 126] could not get anywhere near the works, all the approaches now being guarded by the police. It was a grand sight, but the worst was over, and there was a general feeling of confidence in the crowd that it would spread no further. A dozen engines were at work now. Some of the firemen were on the roof, some on the stacks of timber, which looked red-hot from the deep glow from the fire. The flames were intermittent now, sometimes leaping up high above the shell of the burned-out buildings, then dying down again. \"Thank God it\u0027s no worse!\" Mrs. Andrews said fervently. \"It would have been a bad winter for a great many down here if the fire had spread; as it is, not a quarter of the buildings are burned.\" \"No, nothing like that, mother; not above a tenth, I should say. It\u0027s lucky that there was a strong wall between that and the next shops, or it must all have gone. I have heard them say that part was added on five or six years ago, so that the wall at the end of the planing-shop was an outside wall before; that accounts for its being so thick.\" After looking on for about half an hour they went back home. But neither of the boys got much sleep that night, the excitement they had gone through and the pain of their burns keeping them wide awake till nearly morning. As Mrs. Andrews heard no movement in their rooms—whereas they were usually up and about almost as early on Sundays as on other days, being unable to sleep after their usual[Pg 127] hour for rising—she did not disturb them. George was the first to awake, and looking out of the window felt sure by the light that it was later than usual. He put his head out of the door and shouted: \"Bill, are you up?\" There was no answer. \"Mother, are you up; what o\u0027clock is it?\" \"Up! hours ago, George. Why, it\u0027s past eleven!\" George gave an exclamation of astonishment and rushed into Bill\u0027s room. The latter had woke at his shout. \"It\u0027s past eleven, Bill, and mother has been up for hours;\" and he dashed off again to his room to dress. It was but a few minutes before they came downstairs just at the same moment. \"Why didn\u0027t you wake us, mother?\" \"Because I thought it better to let you sleep on, George. I guessed that your burns had kept you awake for some time.\" \"That they did. I thought I was never going to get to sleep,\" George said; and Bill gave a similar account of himself. \"Still, mother, a short night does no harm for once, and you haven\u0027t been able to get to church.\" \"It does not matter for once, George. What figures you both are!\" \"We are figures,\" George said ruefully. \"I hardly knew myself when I looked in the glass. My eyes are almost shut up, and the skin is peeling[Pg 128] off my nose, and my hair is all rough and scrubby; and Bill looks as bad as I do. You are a figure, Bill!\" and George burst into a fit of laughter. \"He\u0027s no worse than you, George; but come along, breakfast is waiting.\" \"You haven\u0027t waited breakfast for us, I hope, mother?\" \"I made myself a cup of tea the first thing, boys, and had a slice of bread and butter, for I thought you might not be down for some time; but I am quite ready to join you; we have got fish. I put them down directly you called.\" \"Well, I am glad you are not starving, mother; and I am glad too you didn\u0027t have your regular breakfast. It would have been horrid to sit down on Sunday morning without you, when it\u0027s the only regular breakfast we get in the week.\" Just as they had finished their meal there was a knock at the door. It was Bob Grimstone. Bill opened the door. \"Well, how are you to-day, lad? I thought I would just come round and see. You look pretty badly burned; and so do you, George,\" he added, as he followed Bill into the sitting room. \"Good-day, Mrs. Andrews.\" \"Good-morning, Mr. Grimstone,\" Mrs. Andrews said. Since her coming the Grimstones had several times come in on Sunday afternoon to Laburnum Villas. Mrs. Andrews would, indeed, have wished them to come in more frequently, for she felt much[Pg 129] indebted to them for their kindness to George, and, moreover, liked them for themselves, for both were good specimens of their class. \"I see you were busy last night too, Mr. Grimstone; your face looks scorched; but you did not manage to get yourself burned as these silly boys did. What a blessing it is for us all that the fire did not spread!\" \"Well, Mrs. Andrews, I don\u0027t think those two lads can have told you what they did, for if they had you would hardly call them silly boys.\" Mrs. Andrews looked surprised. \"They told me they lent a hand to put out the fire—I think those were George\u0027s words—but they did not tell me anything else.\" \"They saved the building, ma\u0027am. If it hadn\u0027t been for them there would not have been a stick or stone of Penrose\u0027s standing now; the shops and the wood piles would all have gone, and we should all have been idle for six months to come; there is no doubt about that at all.\" \"Why, how was that, Mr. Grimstone? How was it they did more than anyone else?\" \"In the first place they discovered it, ma\u0027am, and rung the alarm-bell; it mightn\u0027t have been found out for another five minutes, and five minutes would have been enough for the fire. In the next place, when they had given the alarm they did the only thing that could have saved the place: they got into the planing-shop and turned on the hose there,[Pg 130] and fought the fire from spreading through the door till we got in seven or eight minutes later. It was all we could do to stop it then; but if they hadn\u0027t done what they did the planing-shop would have been alight from end to end, and the floors above it too, before the first engine arrived, and then nothing could have saved the whole lot. I can tell you, Mrs. Andrews, that there isn\u0027t a man on the works, nor the wife of a man, who doesn\u0027t feel that they owe these two lads their living through the winter. I don\u0027t know what Mr. Penrose will say about it, but I know what we all feel.\" \"Why, George,\" Mrs. Andrews said, while her eyes were filled with happy tears at the praises of her son, \"why did you not tell me about it?\" \"Why, mother, there was not anything to tell,\" George said, \"and Bob has made a great fuss about nothing. As I told you, we saw a light as we came along and when we went round behind and got on the wall we saw the place was on fire, so we rang the alarm-bell, and then turned on the hose and flooded the place with water till Bob and some more came to help us.\" \"It sounds very simple, Mrs. Andrews, but I can tell you it wasn\u0027t so. When we opened the door of the planing-shop it was so full of smoke that it didn\u0027t seem as if anyone could breathe there for a minute, and as we could see the glare of the flames at the other end we thought the place was gone. We should have gone out and waited for the engines if[Pg 131] we hadn\u0027t heard the boys sing out that they were there; and even though we knelt down and crawled in, as they shouted to us to do, we were pretty nearly stifled. When we took the hose they crawled forward and got the shavings cleared away; that was how they burned their hands, I expect; and I hear they tumbled down insensible when they got out. Now, ma\u0027am, they may make light of it, but if ever two young chaps behaved like heroes they did, and you have every right to be proud of them—I say of them, because although Bill\u0027s no son of yours I know he is what you and your boy have made him. He was telling me about it one day.\" \"Will work go on to-morrow as usual, Bob?\" George asked, in order to change the subject. \"In some of the shops it will, no doubt,\" Bob said; \"but in our shop and the floors above it it will take a day or two to clear up. I saw the foreman just now, and he tells me that a strong gang of carpenters will be put on, for both the floors are burned away at the end of the wall and pretty near twenty feet of the roof are charred. Two surveyors are coming down this afternoon to examine the wall and say whether it is safe. The walls of the shops that are burned out must come down, of course. The surveyor says that if the wall at the end of the planing-room looks pretty strong they will build up another wall against it as soon as it gets cold enough and the rubbish is cleared away for men to work; that will make a strong job of it, and there won\u0027t be[Pg 132] any loss of time. Of course if the old one has to come down there can\u0027t be much work done in the shops till it\u0027s finished. The governor got down about ten o\u0027clock last night. A messenger went up to him almost directly after the fire broke out, but he was out at dinner, and by the time he got down here all danger of it spreading was over. He had a talk with the foreman and arranged about the wall with him. He is as anxious as we are that there should be no delay, for there are some heavy orders in, and, of course, he doesn\u0027t want them taken anywhere else.\" \"Will you look at their hands, Mr. Grimstone. I don\u0027t know much about it, but they seem to be badly burned.\" \"That they are, ma\u0027am,\" Mr. Grimstone said when he had examined them; \"pretty nigh raw. If I might give an opinion, I should say as the doctor had better see them; they are precious painful, aint they, George?\" \"They do feel as if they were on fire, Bob, but I don\u0027t see any use in a doctor. I don\u0027t suppose he can do more than mother has.\" \"Perhaps not, George, but he had better see them for all that; he may give you some cooling lotion for them, and I can tell you burns on the hand are apt to be serious matters, for the muscles of the fingers may get stiffened. I have known two or three cases like that. You had better go at once to Dr. Maxwell; he always attends if there are any accidents at[Pg 133] the works. You know the house, George; it is about halfway between this and the works.\" \"Yes, you had better go at once, boys,\" Mrs. Andrews said; \"there, put on your hats and be off.\" \"I will walk with them. I must be off anyway, for the missis will be waiting dinner for me.\" \"Are we to pay, mother?\" \"No, not till you have done, George. I dare say you will have to have your hands dressed several times.\" \"There won\u0027t be any occasion to pay him, Mrs. Andrews. The firm always pays the doctor in case of accidents, and you may be very sure that in this case they will be only too glad.\" \"Well, in any case, George,\" Mrs. Andrews said, \"you can tell the doctor that you will pay when he says that you need not come to him again. If Mr. Penrose hears about it and chooses to pay I should not think of refusing, as you have been burned in his service; but certainly I should not assume that he will do so.\" \"Shall I go in with you, boys?\" Bob asked when they reached the door. \"I know the doctor; he attended me two years ago when I pretty nigh had my finger taken off by one of the cutters.\" \"Yes, please, Bob, I wish you would.\" They were shown into the surgery, where the doctor soon joined them. \"I\u0027ve brought these two young chaps for you to look at their hands, Dr. Maxwell. They got them[Pg 134] burnt last night at the fire. Mrs. Andrews, the mother of this lad, wished me to say that she would pay the charges when you have done with them; but as if it hadn\u0027t been for them the works would have been burnt down as sure as you are standing there, I expect the firm will take the matter in their own hands.\" \"Yes, they are nasty burns,\" the doctor said, examining the boys\u0027 hands. \"Can you open and shut them, boy?\" \"I think I could if tried, sir,\" George said, \"but I shouldn\u0027t like to try, for if I move my fingers at all it hurts them awfully.\" \"I see you have had oil and cotton-wool on your hands.\" \"Yes.\" \"The best thing you can do, boys, is to put on some soothing poultices. Tell your mother to get some linseed and mix it with olive-oil. I will give you a bottle of laudanum. Let her put about twenty drops of that into the oil before she mixes it with the linseed. Every four or five hours change the poultices. I think you will find that will relieve the pain a good deal. I see your faces are scorched too. You can do nothing better than keep them moistened with sweet-oil. I should advise you to keep as quiet as possible for three or four days.\" \"But we shall want to get to work, sir,\" George said. \"Nonsense! You will be very lucky if you can[Pg 135] use your hands in another fortnight. I will send in the usual certificate to the works.\" \"Will you tell the foreman, Bob,\" George said when they left the doctor\u0027s, \"how it is we can\u0027t come to work? You tell him we wanted to, and that we hope to come back as soon as our hands are all right; because, you see, the men and boys at the shops which have been burnt down will be all out of work, and it would be awful if we found our places filled up when we went to work again.\" \"Don\u0027t you be afraid, George; there is no fear of your being out of work after what you have done.\" \"Well, what did the doctor say?\" was Mrs. Andrews\u0027 first question when they returned home. \"He didn\u0027t say much, mother, except that we must not think of going to work for a fortnight anyhow, and we are to have poultices made with linseed mixed with oil, and twenty drops of laudanum from this bottle, and it must be put on fresh every three or four hours. I am afraid it will be an awful trouble.\" \"The trouble won\u0027t matter,\" Mrs. Andrews said brightly. \"Did he say you were to go to bed?\" \"No, mother; but we were to keep as quiet as we could.\" \"Then in that case, George, I think you had better go to bed.\" \"No; I am sure we had better not,\" George said. \"I should toss and fidget about there horridly. The[Pg 136] best thing will be for us to sit here, and then we shall be all together. And if you talk to us, and perhaps read to us, we shan\u0027t feel it half so much. What are you going to do, mother?\" he asked five minutes afterwards, as Mrs. Andrews came down with her bonnet on. \"I am going to get some linseed, George, of course. I haven\u0027t got any in the house.\" \"But it\u0027s Sunday, mother, and the shops will be shut.\" \"I shall get it at the chemist\u0027s, George. They will always supply things that are needed even on Sunday. People are ill on Sunday as well as any other day, you know. I shan\u0027t be gone more than a quarter of an hour. You must keep very quiet till I come back.\" The boys found a good deal of relief from the effect of the poultices, and were very much better after a good night\u0027s rest. At ten o\u0027clock the next morning, as Mrs. Andrews was sitting at her work, with the boys both on the hearthrug in front of the fire, there was a knock at the door. It was a loud double knock, quite unlike the ordinary summons of the baker\u0027s boy, who was the only regular caller. The boys jumped up in surprise. \"Who can that be, mother?\" \"We shall soon see,\" Mrs. Andrews said quietly. She was not surprised, on opening the door, to see a gentleman standing there, whom, by the description the boys had given of him, she guessed to be[Pg 137] their employer. A little girl was standing by his side. \"Is this Mrs. Andrews?\" the gentleman asked. \"I am Mrs. Andrews,\" the lady answered quietly. \"My name is Penrose. I have called with my daughter to inquire after the two lads—one of them your son, I believe—who so gallantly saved my place from being burned down on Saturday evening. I only heard about it late yesterday evening, when I came down to arrange about some matters with the foreman. He did not know the facts of the case on Saturday night, but had learned them yesterday, and there can be no doubt whatever, from what he says, that had it not been for the presence of mind and bravery of these two lads nothing could have saved the entire works and all the wood piles from destruction. I told my daughter this morning, and she insisted on coming down with me. You know she is already indebted to your son for saving a locket which we both greatly valued.\" \"Will you walk in, sir?\" and Mrs. Andrews showed them into the sitting room. Mr. Penrose had been somewhat surprised by Mrs. Andrews\u0027 manner, although the foreman, in telling him of the boys\u0027 conduct, had also stated what he knew about them. \"They are out-of-the-way sort of boys, sir,\" he said. \"There was quite a talk about them in the shops in the spring. They lodged with Grimstone, and it seems that after they had been here at work[Pg 138] five months Andrews\u0027 mother, who had been ill, was coming to them, and they got Grimstone to take a house for them, and it turned out that ever since they had been at work here they had been putting by half their wages to furnish a place for her, so they must have lived on about five shillings a week each and got clothes for themselves out of it. Now, sir, boys as would do that aint ordinary boys, and there was quite a talk among the men about it. I hear from Grimstone that Mrs. Andrews is a superior sort of person, he says quite a lady. She does work, I believe, for some London shop.\" Mr. Penrose, therefore, was prepared to find the boys in a more comfortable abode than usual, and their mother what the foreman called a superior sort of woman; but he perceived at once by her address that Grimstone\u0027s estimate had been a correct one, and that she was indeed a lady. The prettiness of the little sitting room, with its comfortable furniture, its snowy curtains and pretty belongings, heightened this feeling. \"I have come to see you, boys,\" he said, \"and to tell you how indebted I feel to you for your exertions on Saturday. There is no doubt that had it not been for you the place would have been entirely burned. It was fully insured, but it would have been a serious matter for me, as I should have lost four or five months\u0027 work, and it would have been still more serious for the men to have been thrown out of employment at this time of the year, so we all[Pg 139] feel very much indebted to you. I hope you are not much burned.\" \"Oh, no, sir! our hands are burned a bit, but they will be all right in a few days. Bill and I are very glad, sir, that we happened to be passing, and were able to give the alarm and do something to stop the flames till the others came up; but we don\u0027t feel that it was anything out of the way. It was just a piece of fun and excitement to us.\" \"They didn\u0027t say anything about it, Mr. Penrose, when they came home, and it was only when one of the men came in next day to ask after them that I heard that they had really been of use.\" \"It is all very well to say so, lads,\" Mr. Penrose replied; \"but there is no doubt you showed a great deal of courage, as well as presence of mind, and you may be sure that I shall not forget it. And now, Mrs. Andrews,\" he said, turning round to her, \"I feel rather in a false position. I came round to see the lads, who, when I last saw them, were not in very flourishing circumstances, and I was going to make them a present for the service they had done me, and my daughter has brought them a basket with some wine, jelly, and other things such as are good for sick boys. Finding them as I find them, in your care and in such a home, you see I feel a difficulty about it altogether.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" Mrs. Andrews said, \"for the kindness of your intention; but my boys—for although one is in no way related to me I feel towards[Pg 140] him as if he were my own—would not like to take money for doing their duty towards their employer.\" \"No, indeed!\" George and Bill exclaimed simultaneously. \"As you see, sir, thanks to the work you were good enough to give the boys and to my needle,\"—and she glanced towards the articles on the table,—\"we are very comfortable; but I am sure the boys will be very glad to accept the things which your daughter has been so kind as to bring down for them, and will feel very much obliged for her thoughtfulness.\" \"That is right,\" Mr. Penrose said, relieved. \"Nelly, you may as well leave the basket as it is. I am sure you don\u0027t want to carry it back again?\" \"No, papa,\" Nelly said; and indeed even the empty basket would have been more than the child could well have carried. It had come on the top of the carriage to the railway-station, and a porter had accompanied Mr. Penrose with it to Laburnum Villas. \"You would have hardly known your young friend. Would you, Nelly?\" \"I don\u0027t think I should,\" she said, shaking her head. \"He looks dreadfully burned, and his hair is all funny and frizzled.\" \"It will soon grow again,\" George said, smiling. \"The doctor says our faces will be all right when the skin is peeled off. Thank you very much, Miss Penrose, for all the nice things. It was a fortunate[Pg 141] day indeed for us when I caught that boy stealing your locket.\" \"And it was a fortunate day for us too,\" Mr. Penrose responded. \"Now, Mrs. Andrews, we will say good-by. You will not mind my calling again to see how the boys are getting on?\" \"It will be very kind of you, sir, and we shall be glad to see you,\" Mrs. Andrews replied; \"but I hope in a few days they will both be out of the doctor\u0027s hands.\" \"I can\u0027t shake hands with you,\" Mr. Penrose said, patting the boys on the shoulder, \"but I hope next time I see you to be able to do so. Good-morning, Mrs. Andrews.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3174/87049.html","bookId":860,"book":{"id":860,"title":"Sturdy and Strong","description":"简介： hatever may be said as to distinction of classes in England, it is certain that in no country in the world is the upward path more open to those who brace themselves to climb it than in our own.
