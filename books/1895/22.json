His fingers slipped out of me, but before I could mourn the loss, he parted my labia and I nearly came off the bed at the feel of his tongue on me. He circled my clit, teasing it, pressing it … and then he sucked it. I cried out, feeling my orgasm building quicker than I’d ever experienced before as he continued to lap at me, pushing me back up toward climax. When he pressed his fingers inside me, I burst apart, crying out his name like a prayer as my eyes fluttered shut. I writhed against his talented mouth, my fingers curled into the bedding beneath me. The orgasm rolled through me in waves and I pulsed and pulsed against his mouth, until finally I was a limp rag doll. I felt him move up my body and when I eventually pried my eyes open he had his hands braced on either side of my head again, his lower body pressed to mine. He was wearing this pleased, cocky smile on his face. He brushed his fingers across my cheekbone affectionately, his eyes searching. ‘I take it that was good.’ That was an understatement. The first and only time I’d had sex, I didn’t come. However, I had been supplying my own orgasms since I was eighteen and I won a vibrator in a student raffle. Those orgasms had been good. A few had even been great. None of them had been sensational. Until now. Lazily, I lifted my hands and clasped them around Nate’s neck, my thumbs brushing along his jaw tenderly. ‘I’m going to let you keep that smug look on your face. You earned it.’ Nate chuckled and kissed me, letting me feel his laughter tremble against my lips in a way that was incredibly hot. I smiled beneath it, but as it grew heated, as I tasted myself on his tongue, the smiles and laughter disappeared and I curled my fingers tighter into his hair. I broke the kiss before he did and said breathlessly, ‘Your turn.’ There was a flash of something in his eyes, something I didn’t completely understand, but what I did know was that he was hungry. He shifted, moving off me to lie on his back, his arms crossed casually behind his head. ‘I’m all yours.’ The butterflies returned to my belly, not as many as before, but they were there, cheering me on as I prepared to go down on a guy for the first time. ‘I’ve never …’ Nate’s countenance gentled and he reached out to smooth my hair behind my ear as he replied, ‘I know, Liv. And you don’t have to. Ever. You only do what you’re comfortable with.’ My gaze flickered to his lap and his hard cock. ‘I want to at least try.’ ‘Then I’ll talk you through it,’ he answered. Quicker than a few blinks, he had shoved his boxers down his legs and kicked them off. I stared openmouthed at him. When I lost my virginity I didn’t really get time to study my chosen asshat of a partner’s penis. He’d just pulled down his zipper and pushed inside of me. Nate’s strained toward his belly. It was long and thick and it was throbbing. I was guessing it was impressive. The thought of it inside of me set off a new wave of arousal, but as I imagined wrapping my mouth around it, I began to feel apprehensive. ‘How …’ I looked back at him wide-eyed. ‘I …’ ‘Liv?’ His brows creased. ‘Just say it.’ It rushed out in a burst of geek. ‘Its size is a little problematic because despite my tendency to ramble, my mouth is pretty small and it won’t all fit in it and I have a gag reflex that might be a problem so I don’t know how –’ ‘Liv –’ Nate was choking on laughter. ‘Take a deep breath.’ He closed his eyes and shook his head, keeping his inner thoughts to himself. I worried for a moment that my inexperience was suddenly a turn-off. But when his lids lifted he smiled, so I took that and his still raging hard-on as good signs. ‘Take me into your mouth and while you suck me off, pump the root with your fist. The key is to fist it hard but not too hard. Suck hard. Teeth sheathed.’ I nodded, hoping I could do this. ‘Liv, we seriously don’t have to do th – ahh,’ he hissed as I cut him off by wrapping my mouth around him. At first I was frozen by the foreignness of having him in my mouth, tasting him, feeling him as if he were all around me, as if there was nothing else in the world but him. It felt odd. It felt alien. And I was afraid I just wasn’t cut out for this part of sexual intimacy. Until I looked up at his face from under my lashes. This was Nate. I gathered my courage. I began to do everything that he asked, and as I did I watched him – watched the color rise in his cheeks; watched the way his chest rose and fell in rapid breaths; watched his fists curl in the sheets around him; watched his mouth open on pants; watched the sheen of sweat build across his skin; watched his abs ripple. And I got off on it. I didn’t expect to like going down on a guy, but I loved the sensual power that rushed through me at knowing I could make Nate feel so turned on that he huffed out my name in pleasured tones. ‘I’m coming,’ he panted, sliding his hand into my hair, and I jerked back just in time to watch him shudder through a climax. As his body relaxed, he dragged his hands over his face and into his hair, his eyes closed to me and thus his reaction closed to me. I waited, unsure. Slowly Nate opened his eyes and stared up at me. Well? ‘Did you enjoy that?’ he asked roughly. ‘Yes,’ I whispered back. ‘Good, because I’d certainly like a repeat performance sometime.’ He blew air out between his lips and shook his head, grinning, before his bright eyes came back to me. ‘Fuck, girl.’ Laughing softly in relief, I lay back on my bed and stared at the ceiling. ‘I take it I got a high score on my first lesson in seduction.’ ‘Like I said before … you’re an overachiever.’ The bed moved and I turned my head to watch Nate sit up and slide his legs off it. ‘Where are you going?’ He gazed back at me over his shoulder. ‘I think we’ve done enough for tonight. I don’t want to overwhelm you.’ I frowned, unhappy with this turn of events. ‘Isn’t that up to me?’ Nate was reaching for his underwear, but I could see his shoulders shaking with amusement. Instead of answering, he strode out of the room, his muscled ass so biteworthy it took everything in me not to chase after it. I heard the water running in my bathroom and a few minutes later Nate came back, cleaned up and wearing his boxers. He reached for his jeans and began pulling them on. Once fully dressed, he gazed at me, drinking me in, in all my flushed nakedness. Strangely, I didn’t feel like squirming. I waited, wondering what he was thinking. Dying to know, in fact. Before, I would have asked him, but somehow the intimacy we’d shared had changed that. Now if I asked him what was on his mind, I might come across as some clingy, wannabe girlfriend. In that moment, I resented my decision to ask for his help. As if he sensed my dark thoughts, he crossed the room and bent down to press a sweet kiss to my mouth. I felt his fingers in my hair as he pulled back and murmured his carnal promise: ‘Tomorrow, we fuck.’ 12 Monday might as well have been devoured by fog. I was walking, talking, doing my job, and yet it was covered in this euphoric mist that didn’t allow any of it to really sink in. Instead I was consumed by thoughts of the night before, of what Nate had done to me and what I had done to him. I was consumed with anticipation for the evening to come. When Nate called around my apartment that night I didn’t bother with clothes. I put on another set of nice lingerie – emerald green this time – and wore a robe over it. I opened the door after buzzing him up, and his eyes sharpened as they drifted over my ensemble. He shut the door behind him and immediately shrugged out of his jacket. ‘I like undressing you,’ he said without even a hello, dumping his jacket over my kitchen stool. ‘Your Benjamin boy might not care, but since it’s me you’re about to fuck for the foreseeable future … I like to undress you.’ Not knowing quite what to make of that except that I liked it, I replied, ‘Okay, I won’t undress next time.’ Nate bit his lower lip, studying me. ‘Tonight’s lesson is all about discovering what turns you on. Do you like being in the driving seat, do you like him in the driving seat, do you like absolute control, absolute submission, or give-and-take?’ I hoped I understood what he meant and he wasn’t about to reveal to me that he had a thing for St. Andrew’s crosses and floggers. Better we found out now so I could run a million miles in the opposite direction. ‘Uh … what do you prefer?’ ‘Both.’ He shrugged. ‘Depends where the mood takes us.’ He began to prowl toward me, and with my mind still on kink I backed up until I hit the wall. Nate pressed in on me, his hands reaching for the ties on my robe. ‘When you say control … we’re not talking whips and chains, are we?’ He burst out laughing, shaking his head. ‘No, babe. Just good old-fashioned fucking.’ The belt came loose and my robe fell open, revealing my lingerie. ‘Did I tell you you have shit-hot taste in underwear?’ ‘It is nice to finally have it appreciated.’ Pushing the robe off my shoulders, Nate’s fingers lingered across the tops of them as the fabric pooled at my feet. Watching his hands the whole time, he caressed the skin along my collarbone while I stood shivering with eagerness. His fingers trailed down my breastbone and over the swells of my breasts. Goose bumps prickled in the wake of his touch and my nipples tightened in expectation. Instead of giving in to their clear cry for attention, Nate let his fingertips drift back up over my chest and gently along my neck, touching a spot just under my ear that made me shudder with need. The reaction made him smile and he immediately bent his head to graze his lips across the spot. I felt the wet touch of his tongue and the shiver rippled through me again. ‘Sweet spot,’ he whispered in my ear, brushing his lips over it and scattering barely-there kisses along my jaw. When he stopped, hovering above my mouth, he looked deep into my eyes. ‘Tell me what you want tonight.’ I blinked, wondering exactly what he meant. ‘Don’t think about it,’ he urged. ‘Just tell me what you want.’ My eyes dropped to his mouth, so close and yet not quite close enough. Hoarse with arousal, I said the first thing that came into my head: ‘You inside me.’ My words affected him. I knew because he braced his hands on the wall at either side of my head and pressed his erection against my stomach. ‘You want my cock, baby?’ he murmured, letting his top lip catch my bottom lip before moving infinitesimally away as I nodded. His lashes lowered over his eyes. ‘I want to hear you say it.’ All evidence was pointing to the fact that Nate liked dirty talk. He’d mentioned it in our earlier lessons, but I hadn’t really processed it. Clearly, however, talking about what we wanted to do to each other got him off. I was learning. And not just about him, but about me. Because talking about what we wanted to do to each other turned me on too. I tilted my mouth closer to his, kissing him lightly as I answered thickly, ‘I want your cock inside me.’ ‘This is the point’ – he kissed me softly, his tongue just touching the tip of mine – ‘where I’d ask’ – he kissed me again – ‘if you want it slow or fast, gentle or hard’ – another kiss – ‘but tonight we’ll take it slow.’","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/before-jamaica-lane-on-dublin-street-3/page-22.html","bookId":1895,"book":{"id":1895,"title":"Before Jamaica Lane (On Dublin Street #3)","description":"Storyline: Before Jamaica Lane (On Dublin Street #3) One simple lesson in seduction between two friends can turn into so much more… Despite her outgoing demeanor, Olivia is painfully insecure around the opposite sex—usually, she can’t get up the nerve to approach guys she’s interested in.
