I’ve seen it empty before, when Paige was switching out one show for another, giving the walls a fresh coat of white paint so the art would stand out. But Rennie’s transformed it. She’s set up a bar over by where the cash register used to be, and another one of the workers from the restaurant is there mixing drinks in a crisp white tuxedo shirt and black bow tie. Drinks are being served in actual glassware, probably from the restaurant too. No plastic Solo cups. Pretty metallic garlands crisscross the ceiling in all different colors. They look vintage. There are helium balloons, too, clusters of white and silver and gold with matching ribbons, floating across the room. I look down and see that Rennie’s painted the floor, alternating black and white zigzag stripes. She’s made a bunch of centerpieces for all the tabletops: bouquets of cream-colored feathers, some dipped in gold and silver glitter.\n Even I have to admit, this is her best party yet.\n The place is packed; it’s so dark it takes a second for my eyes to adjust. No Kat or Mary yet. I spot Nadia and some other girls from the squad huddled together on a couch in the corner. Nadia waves, and I wave back.\n And then it’s me, standing alone.\n I get a pain in my stomach. Is this how it’s going to be all night?\n I take a deep breath and then fish in my clutch for my lipstick and my compact. That’s the thing with dark red lipstick. You have to make sure it’s always on nice and thick and rich; otherwise it looks like you’ve been eating a popsicle or something. I touch up the corners of my mouth, and as I put everything back into my bag, I feel my phone vibrate.\n It’s Alex.\n You look amazing. I smile and click my phone shut. I look around for Alex and spot him over by the bar, leaning against the corner, sipping something brown from a glass. He lifts his glass to me and I laugh. I can’t help it. He’s wearing a button-down and suspenders and a hat his mom must have found him. He looks adorable.\n He makes his way through the crowd over to where I’m standing. As he walks, I see him reach for something inside his pants pocket.\n “You left my house before I could give you your present the other night.” He comes up next to me and holds out his hand. In his palm is a small orange box with a narrow brown ribbon tied around it. The ribbon says Hermès.\n I can’t believe it.\n Alex puts the box in my hands. “Open it, Lil.”\n I untie the ribbon and open the box. It’s the bracelet I wanted,\n the one I saw in Boston. White, enamel, perfect. “Alex, this is way too expensive! I can’t accept this.”\n “You said you wanted it, remember?”\n “I know, but . . .”\n He smiles, pleased. “So I want you to have it.” Alex takes the bracelet out of the box and puts it on my wrist.\n “I can’t.”\n “Why not?”\n “Because . . . it’s too much.”\n “Don’t worry about that. I used the money my grandma gave me for a new guitar.” Alex shoves his hands in his pockets. “Actually, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you. About that weekend in Boston.”\n I give him a quick, nervous nod.\n “If . . .” He looks down, and then back at me again. “Remember when we went on that walk, in the snow? If I would have tried to kiss you that night, would you have let me?”\n My mind flashes back to that night. How beautiful it was, in snowy Boston. How I felt so safe with Alex. How easy it was with him, especially compared to Reeve.\n I think I would have. Maybe.\n I’m about to tell him so, but then everything falls away and goes to static because over Alex’s shoulder, across the room, I see him.\n Reeve. On the couch, next to a girl who at first I think is Rennie, but then see is not. She’s a sophomore; I think her name is Kendall. He’s wearing the outfit we bought together. He looks so good it makes me feel sick. She’s wearing a feather boa around her neck, and he keeps playing with it.\n Our eyes meet, and then deliberately he looks away. He says something in Kendall’s ear and puts his hat on her head, and then she scoots onto his lap. I can feel all the blood rush to my face.\n I break away from Alex. “I have to go.”\n Alex’s face falls. “Are you not even going to answer my question?”\n “I . . . I can’t right now.”\n I look over at Reeve again; I can’t help it. He catches my eye, takes a big sip of his drink, and then he puts his hand on Kendall’s thigh.\n I have to get out of here. I start backing up, pushing people out of my way.\n I stumble toward the hallway. Then Reeve pops up in front of me, blocking my way with his arm. “Excuse me,” I say icily.\n “Oh, so we’re still not speaking?” Reeve oh-so-casually crosses his arms and leans against the hallway wall.\n I glare at him. “Why would we need to speak? We don’t even like each other, remember?”\n Reeve gives me a condescending smile, like I’m just a silly girl and he’s so mature and above it all. I try to push past him again, hard, and his smile drops. He says, “Look, I was pissed that you blew me off, but I’m over it now, so you don’t have to run away every time you see me. I won’t bother you anymore. It’s cool.”\n “Awesome,” I say.\n Reeve reaches out and touches the bracelet on my wrist. “Nice bracelet,” he says.\n I know he’s being insincere, but I still say, “Thank you.”\n With a smirk he adds, “Lind must have worked really hard to save up for that for you.”\n “He did.” I should smile and leave it at that, but I can’t resist adding, “Classy of you to be talking to another girl at Rennie’s party.” I throw a pointed look in Kendall’s direction. “Or are you and Ren already over? Why am I not the least bit surprised? How very Reeve of you, already on to the next.” I’d assumed the reason Rennie invited me to her party was so that she could flaunt her relationship with Reeve in my face. But maybe not. Maybe they’re over and done with too. Without Reeve in the mix, Rennie has no reason to hate me.\n Reeve’s not smiling anymore, and I know I’m getting under his skin. “Like I said a million times, Rennie and I are friends.”\n “Oh yeah? Is that what friends do? Have sleepovers? Cuddle in your bedroom together?”\n Reeve puts up his hands. “Believe what you want. I don’t care.”\n “I’m believing what she told me, you dummy. I saw her at your house! She was more than happy to throw it in my face.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fire-with-fire-burn-for-burn-2/page-83.html","bookId":2727,"book":{"id":2727,"title":"Fire with Fire (Burn for Burn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n When sweet revenge turns sour… Book two of a trilogy from New York Times bestselling author Jenny Han and Siobhan Vivian. \n Lillia, Kat, and Mary had the perfect plan.
