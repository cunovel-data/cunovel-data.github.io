It’s a brass name plate. It says mr. frissel.\\n\\n Oh my gosh, I’m in the wrong class. I realize this as the papers are being passed to me. The boy sitting in front of me turns around.\\n\\n It’s David Washington, the boy I kissed on Halloween night. I don’t think he recognizes me without my makeup and the pink streaks in my hair. But I definitely recognize him.\\n\\n I get up with a start. “I—I made a mistake,” I announce. I grab my things and run out the door. But not to the class I’m supposed to be in. I head straight home. It’s a half day anyway.\\n\\n When I get there, I’m still upset, so much so that my hands are shaking as I set my bike against the side of our house. Only one light is on inside, over the kitchen sink. The rest of the rooms are dark, like the sky.\\n\\n I hear a knock around the front of the house. I edge past the corner and see two of the ladies from the Jar Island Preservation Society, with phony smiles plastered on their faces. They’ve stopped by before, always unannounced. I already know Aunt Bette will not answer the door.\\n\\n I was there the first few times they came. We stood together in the doorway as they recommended landscapers who could come help clean up one yard or passed the name of a handyman who might replace the broken shingles in a way that would “maintain the original integrity” of the house.\\n\\n Sure, our house isn’t in the best shape. Not when you compare it to the other homes on the block. This part of Jar Island has the oldest houses; almost half have been officially designated as landmarks. And some people take that designation super seriously, making sure that every detail is true to the period and that any renovations are done with special materials that would have been used at the time, like slate and cedar.\\n\\n But old houses take a lot of upkeep, and that’s never been Aunt Bette’s forte. Mine either. The whole place could use a fresh coat of paint. One of the wooden front steps has rotted through. And yes, our yard catches all the dead brown leaves from our big oak, but I don’t see what the big deal is. The ground is covered in snow; everything will stay white until March.\\n\\n Not to mention that all of this stuff . . . it’s not hurting anyone. And it’s none of their business even if they do want to make it a landmark. This is our house, part of the Zane family since Jar Island came to be. I watch the two ladies retreat slowly down the steps.\\n\\n But like anything you don’t deal with, they keep coming back. We’re going to have to do something about them; otherwise they’ll just keep coming around.\\n\\n I plan on saying exactly that to Aunt Bette as I walk through the back door. But I don’t, because she’s talking on the telephone.\\n\\n “She’s upset all the time. There’s no reasoning with her. I tried to tell her that she needs to not focus on this Reeve boy. I never told you this because she swore me to secrecy . . . but he was terrible to her. I told Mary she’ll never find peace that way, but she . . . she screamed at me.” Aunt Bette pauses. “No. No, of course not. You don’t need to come. I’ve got it under control.”\\n\\n Oh my God, she’s talking to my mother about Reeve. I run in the room and stand right in front of her and stare daggers. Aunt Bette’s eyes go wide. She’s surprised to see me at this time of day.\\n\\n “Erica, I . . . I have to go.” And then she hangs up.\\n\\n “I can’t believe you just did that. You promised me you’d keep that a secret!”\\n\\n Aunt Bette falls into her seat and starts rubbing her temples. “What does it matter now?”\\n\\n I completely resent how exasperated she’s acting, like my very presence is taxing. “Are you serious? I trusted you!” I say, curt. “And I come home to find you talking about me behind my back? How do you think that makes me feel?”\\n\\n Aunt Bette shrugs. “I’ve stopped trying to guess how you feel, Mary. I’m staying out of it.”\\n\\n I point at the phone. “That’s not staying out of it!” I am quivering with anger. “And now I’ll have to explain everything to them at Thanksgiving.”\\n\\n “Your parents aren’t coming for Thanksgiving.”\\n\\n “Why?”\\n\\n She looks at me and says, “Your mom doesn’t have such happy memories of this place.” She says it with more than a hint of bite, which I guess I deserve, but it still catches me off guard.\\n\\n “Call Mom back. Call her and tell her that everything’s okay, that they should come for Thanksgiving.”\\n\\n Aunt Bette stands up. “If you want to see her so bad, Mary, why are you here? Go home and be with her.”\\n\\n After my thirteenth-birthday-party disaster, when the only kid from my class to show up was Reeve, my parents became very concerned. Concerned and smothering.\\n\\n Dad had the idea to throw me another birthday party, as if the first one had never happened. This new party would be somewhere on the mainland. He had it in his mind that the ferry ride was too much to ask of people. He refused to believe that no one came because no one wanted to be associated with me. He casually suggested that we make it more mature, cooler for a group of budding teenagers. Either roller skating or bowling.\\n\\n I told him no way.\\n\\n Mom wanted to start riding the ferry with me, to and from school. She said it would be fun. She’d bring the newspaper with her, or a book. I wouldn’t even have to talk to her if I didn’t want to. We could sit quietly with each other and enjoy the scenery. I refused, of course. The ferry ride was my time with Reeve. It was the only time I was happy.\\n\\n Around them I made an effort not to eat so much food at dinner, and they’d look so hurt when I’d tell them to please not give me so much pasta.\\n\\n They were trying so hard it made me feel worse. I started shrinking into myself. I didn’t want to hang out with my parents or do fun stuff on the island on the weekends. I hated how hard they were trying to fix this for me. It couldn’t be fixed. Not by them. And I hated seeing them hurt. I wanted to shield them from the hurt. I could take it. But I didn’t want them to suffer.\\n\\n The worst of it was when the two of them knocked on my door late one night. The semester had ended at Montessori. I’d brought home a crappy report card. I never got bad grades.\\n\\n Dad sat on my bed,; Mom leaned against my desk.\\n\\n He said, “Do you have any interest in changing schools?”\\n\\n Mom said, “You could go here in Middlebury. You wouldn’t have to do the ferry anymore; you could have a brand-new start.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fire-with-fire-burn-for-burn-2/page-51.html","bookId":2727,"book":{"id":2727,"title":"Fire with Fire (Burn for Burn #2)","description":"Storyline: When sweet revenge turns sour… Book two of a trilogy from New York Times bestselling author Jenny Han and Siobhan Vivian. \\n Lillia, Kat, and Mary had the perfect plan.
