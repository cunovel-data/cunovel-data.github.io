We were serving ourselves this morning--democracy. I had found a sunny corner and was on my second cup of coffee and a fried egg, and Robert Oliver was nowhere in sight. Perhaps he didn\u0027t eat breakfast. \"Ready for what?\" I said.\n \"For the first day.\" He put his tray down without asking if I wanted company.\n \"Help yourself,\" I said. \"I was just wishing for some companionship in this beautiful, lonely spot.\"\n He smiled, apparently pleased with my feistiness; why had I thought sarcasm would work? His hair was crafted into a couple of spiky tufts at the front, and he wore graying jeans and a sweatshirt and frayed basketball sneakers, a red-and-blue bead necklace. He bent from a lithe waist and flexed his shoulders over the cornflakes. He was perfect in his immature way, and he knew it. I pictured him at sixty-five, gaunt and stringy-armed, with bunions and probably a wrinkled tattoo somewhere.\n \"The first day is going to be long,\" he said. \"That\u0027s why I asked if you\u0027re ready for this. I hear Oliver\u0027s going to work us out there for hours and hours. He\u0027s intense.\"\n I tried to get back to my coffee. \"It\u0027s a landscape-painting class, not football practice.\"\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know.\" Frank was mashing his way through his breakfast. \"I\u0027ve heard about this guy. He never stops. He made his name as a portrait painter, but he\u0027s really into landscapes right now. He\u0027s outdoors all day long, like an animal.\"\n \"Or like Monet,\" I said, and immediately regretted it. Frank was looking away from me as if I\u0027d begun picking my nose.\n \"Monet?\" he murmured, and I heard the disdain, the puzzlement, through his mouthful of breakfast. We finished our eggs in not-quite-friendly silence.\n The hillside where Robert Oliver set us our first landscape exercise commanded a view of ocean and rocky islands; it was part of a state park, and I wondered how he\u0027d known to come exactly here, to this tremendous setting. Robert drove his easel legs into the ground. We all gathered around, holding our gear or dropping it on the grass, watching while he demonstrated a sketch, showed us how to focus on form first, without considering yet what the forms represented, and then made suggestions about color. We would need a grayish ground, he said, to reproduce the bright cold light all around us, but also some warmer brown tones under the tree trunks, grass, even the water.\n His presentation in the classroom that morning had been minimal: \"You\u0027re all accomplished, working artists, and I don\u0027t see the need to talk a lot--let\u0027s just get out in the field and find out what happens, and we can discuss composition later, when we\u0027ve got some pictures to take a look at.\" I\u0027d been glad, after that, to escape to the out-of-doors. We\u0027d driven to this area, then walked up through the woods from the parking lot, carrying our gear. The conference had provided sandwiches and apples; we hoped it wouldn\u0027t rain later in the day.\n I was remembering a lot about Robert Oliver now, standing close enough to see his demonstration but not so close as to seem eager; I recognized that passionate insistence on form, the way his voice deepened to conviction when he told us to ignore everything except the geometry of the scene until we got it right, the way he stood back, weight on his heels, examining his work every few minutes, then leaned into it again. Robert made some sort of contact with everyone, I noticed; more than ever, he had that easy, disheveled gift for hospitality, as if wherever he taught was a dining room instead of a classroom, and we were all eating at his table. It was irresistible, and the other students seemed drawn in by him at once, crowding trustingly around his canvas. He pointed out some views and the shapes they might form on a canvas, then roughed in the forms of the view he\u0027d chosen and laid on color, much of it burnt umber, a deep-brown wash.\n There were enough level places on the hillside for six people to set up easels and find easy footing, and we all spent some time hunting for views. It was hard to go wrong, actually--hard to choose which of 180 degrees of natural splendor to paint. I finally settled on a long vista of firs creeping down to the beach and water, with the bulk of Isle des Roches in the far right and a flat horizon of water meeting the sky to the left. It wasn\u0027t quite balanced; I moved my easel a few degrees and caught a frame of evergreens by the beach at far left, to give my canvas extra interest on that side.\n Once I\u0027d chosen my spot, Frank planted his easel enthusiastically near mine, as if I\u0027d invited him and would be honored by his company. Some of the other students seemed quite pleasant; they were my age or older, mainly women, which made Frank look like a precocious child. Two of the women, who said they already knew each other from a conference in Santa Fe, had engaged me in friendly talk in the van. I watched them putting easels into the lower reaches of the hillside, conferring with each other about their palettes. There was also a very shy elderly man whom Frank told me in a whisper had exhibited at Williams College the year before; he set up near us and began to sketch with paint rather than pencils.\n Frank had not only shoved the legs of his easel into the ground near mine but also pointed it more or less in the same direction;\n I noted with annoyance that we\u0027d be doing very similar views, which put our skills into direct competition. At least he was immediately absorbed and probably wouldn\u0027t bother me; he already had his palette set up with a few basic colors and was using graphite to outline the distant mass of the island and the edge of the shore in the foreground. He was quick, sure, and his lean back moved under its shirt in graceful rhythm.\n I looked away and began to prepare my palette: green, burnt umber, a soft blue with some gray to it, a squeeze of white and one of black. I was already wishing I\u0027d replaced two of my brushes before the conference; they were superb ones, but I\u0027d had them so long that they\u0027d lost some hairs. My teaching job didn\u0027t cover much in the way of expensive painting supplies, once I\u0027d paid rent and groceries, and DC wasn\u0027t cheap, although I\u0027d found an apartment in a neighborhood Muzzy never would have approved of and fortunately never came to see. I wouldn\u0027t have dreamed of asking her for money either, after disappointing her in her career choice for me. (\"But lots of people with degrees in art become lawyers these days, don\u0027t they, darling? And you\u0027ve always been such an arguer.\") I renewed my vow, as I did daily: I would keep trying to build enough of a portfolio, participate in enough shows, amass enough excellent references, to apply for a real teaching job. I glared at Frank, since he wasn\u0027t looking. Perhaps Robert Oliver could help me somehow, if I did well in this workshop. I checked, covertly, and discovered that Robert was painting with absorption, too. I couldn\u0027t see his canvas from where I stood, but it was large and he\u0027d begun to fill it with long strokes.\n The color of the water changed from hour to hour, of course, making it difficult to catch, and the peak of Isle des Roches proved a challenge; my version of it was a little too soft, like custard or whipped cream rather than pale rock, the village at its lowest shore smudgy at best. Robert painted for a long time, down the slope from us, and I wondered if he\u0027d ever come up to see our work, and dreaded that.\n At last we broke for lunch, Robert stretching, joining his great hands inside out high above his head and the rest of us imitating, in one way or another, looking up, putting down brushes, raising our arms. I knew we\u0027d eat quickly, and when Robert sat down in a sunny spot farther down the hill and drew his lunch out of a big canvas bag, we all followed, huddling around him with our own sandwiches. He gave me a smile; had he been glancing around for me a second before? Frank began to talk with the two friendly women about the success of his recent show in Savannah, and Robert leaned across to ask how my landscape was shaping up. \"Very poorly,\" I said, which for some reason made him grin. \"I mean,\" I said, encouraged, \"have you ever had that dessert called Floating Island?\" He laughed and promised he\u0027d come take a look at it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves/page-61.html","bookId":2244,"book":{"id":2244,"title":"The Swan Thieves","description":"Storyline: \n Psychiatrist Andrew Marlowe has a perfectly ordered life--solitary, perhaps, but full of devotion to his profession and the painting hobby he loves. This order is destroyed when renowned painter Robert Oliver attacks a canvas in the National Gallery of Art and becomes his patient.
