{"id":85109,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"After lunch, which was on the whole silent (but companionably so, I thought), Kate told me she would have to get to work soon, and I took the hint and left, although only after we\u0027d agreed to meet again the next morning. She closed the big front door behind me, but when I turned around on the front walk, she was still gazing out through the glass. She smiled at me, then ducked her head as if regretting the smile, waved once, and vanished before I could even wave in return. Her brick walk was bright with rain, and I picked my way carefully back to the gravel drive. I touched my breast pocket as I got into the car, checking the crinkling sheet there. I hadn\u0027t felt so sad in a long time, somehow. My patients, when they saw me or when I saw them, were surrounded by the uniform setting of my office or the doggedly cheerful rooms at Goldengrove. Now I had talked with a woman who was alone, alone and maybe depressed enough so that she could reasonably have come to my practice herself as a patient, but instead I\u0027d seen her surrounded by her own life, the enormous holly near the front door, the garden beds with her tulips blooming in them, the furniture her grandmother had left her, the smell of salmon and dill in her kitchen, the ruins of her husband\u0027s life in evidence behind her. She had still been able to smile in my direction. I drove back on the springtime roads of her neighborhood, the woods and glimpses of interesting houses, feeling my way along the route I\u0027d come. I pictured Kate putting on a canvas jacket and getting her car keys off a hook, locking the door behind her. I thought about how she must look bending to kiss her children in their beds at night, her small waist flexible under her blue clothes. The children would both be blond, like her, or one would be pale-haired and the other crowned with Robert\u0027s heavy dark locks--but here my mind drew back. She would kiss them every time she saw them again, even after a short absence. That I was sure of. I wondered how Robert could bear to be away from these three exquisite people he had made his own. But what did I know? Maybe he couldn\u0027t bear it, actually. Or maybe he had forgotten how exquisite they were. I had never had a wife or a child, or two children, or a large old house with a living room full of sunlight. I saw my own hand taking the plates from Kate\u0027s -- she wore no rings, just a thin gold chain on one wrist. What did I know? At the Hadleys\u0027, I again opened all the windows, then put the scrap of letter from Robert\u0027s office on the bureau, lay down on the ugly twin bed, and fell into a doze. At one point, I actually slept for a few minutes. Deep down in my dream was Robert Oliver, telling me about his life with his wife, but I couldn\u0027t hear a word and I kept asking him to speak more clearly. There was something else buried in that dream, a memory: etretat, the name of a coastal town in France--where, exactly?--the scene of Monet\u0027s famous cliff paintings, those iconic arches, blue-and-green water, green-and-purple rock. Finally I got up, unrested, and put on an old shirt. I took my current reading, a biography of Newton, and drove down to the town to hunt for dinner. I found several good restaurants; in one of them, which had tiny white lights in all the windows as if it were Christmas, I had a plate of potato pancakes with various garnishes. The woman sitting at the bar smiled at me and recrossed lovely legs, and the man who joined her a few minutes later looked like a New York businessman. A strange little town, I thought, liking it even more as my Pinot Noir took effect. Walking around the streets after dinner, I wondered if I might encounter Kate, and if so what I would say to her, how she would react if we ran into each other after this morning\u0027s conversation, then remembered that she would surely be at home with her children. I pictured myself driving back into her neighborhood to peer through those huge windows. They would be softly lit, the bushes around them already dark, the roof floating above. Inside, a box of gems: Kate playing with two beautiful children, her hair shining under the lamp. Or I would see her at the kitchen window where she\u0027d made me salmon; she would be washing dishes after the children were in bed, reveling in the silence. I imagined in a rush her hearing me among the bushes, calling the local police, the handcuffs, the fruitless explanations, her anger, my disgrace. I stopped to compose myself for a moment in front of a boutique window full of baskets and what appeared to be handwoven shawls. As I stood there, I began to long for home. What on earth, after all, was I doing here? It was lonely in this pretty town; at home, I was used to being alone. I kept seeing the words in pencil on Robert\u0027s wall. Why had he filled his library with the Impressionists? I made myself walk a little farther, pretending that I hadn\u0027t given up on the evening already. Soon I would go home--to the Hadleys\u0027, in other words -- and lie in bed reading about Newton, who was comfortably from another world, an era without modern psychiatry. Tragically without it, of course. Before Monet, before Picasso, before antibiotics, before my own life. Comfortably dead Newton would keep me better company than these twilit streets, with their restored buildings, cafe tables, young couples draped in scarves and earrings who went by holding hands in a cloud of musky scent. It was already a long time since I\u0027d been young, and I didn\u0027t know how the distance had crept over me, or when. At the end of the block, the boutiques gave way to a parking lot and then, rather surprisingly, to a festive-looking club that turned out to be a topless bar. Despite the presence of a bouncer at the door, the place had none of the sordid appearance of such operations in Washington. Not that I had been in one in many decades, and then only once, in college, but I had driven past them here and there and noted, at least, their existence. I hesitated for a moment. The man at the door was neatly dressed, gentlemanly, as if even the strip shows in this town had been gentrified. He turned toward me with a friendly, expectant, understanding smile, like a financial consultant at a bank. Was he inviting me in? Did I want to apply for a mortgage? I stood there wondering if I should indeed go in, because I couldn\u0027t think why I shouldn\u0027t. I remembered, too, the one really beautiful model from my classes at the Art League School at home--remote, balanced nude before the group, her mind far away and probably going over her college homework or her next dental appointment, her breasts lifted delicately in front of her, her professionalism, the slight quiver that was the only betrayal of her need to move at all during the long, long pose. \"No, thank you,\" I said to the fellow at the door, but my voice seemed muffled by age and embarrassment. He hadn\u0027t invited me in, he hadn\u0027t handed me any kind of flyer, so why was I speaking to him? I tucked the biography firmly under my arm and walked on, then turned the next corner so that I wouldn\u0027t have to pass him again--him and his festive doorway. Had he long ago grown used to the sights and sounds within, so that it was no chore to him to have to sit outside in the gathering dark, no hardship to miss it all? Did his mind wander away at last, bored even by what was supposed to excite? At the Hadleys\u0027 quiet house, I lay awake for hours in my twin bed next to the other, empty bed, feeling and hearing the spruces, the hemlocks, the rhododendron scraping at the partly open window, the verdant mountain out there in the night, the burgeoning of nature that did not seem to include me. And when, my restless body asked my teeming brain, had I agreed to be excluded? Standing on Kate\u0027s porch the next morning, I felt not increased embarrassment but a kind of familiarity, an actual ease, as if I\u0027d arrived to see an old friend or as if I were an old friend myself, stepping up to ring the bell. She answered promptly, and again it was like walking onto the set of a play, except that I\u0027d seen the show once now and knew where all the props would be. Today the sun was fully out, streaming through the room. There were only two other changes: one, a great bowl of floating blooms, pink and white, arranged with care on the table by the windows; and Kate herself, who wore a blouse of saffron cotton over her jeans, with the same tourmaline jewelry. Yesterday I had thought her eyes were blue; now they were turquoise, wide and clear. She smiled, but it was a reserved, polite smile, the acknowledgment of a problem, and the problem was me, my renewed presence in her house, my need to ask her more questions about the husband who no longer lived here. When she\u0027d finished serving our coffee, she sat down on the opposite sofa. \"I think we should plan to kind of wrap this up today,\" she said mildly, as if she\u0027d studied how to say it without hurting my feelings or revealing her own. \"Yes, of course,\" I said, to show I could take a hint with alacrity. \"Of course. You\u0027ve been very hospitable already. Besides, I should get back to Washington tomorrow night, if possible.\" \"Then you won\u0027t be going out to the college?\" She balanced her cup on her neat, small knee, as if to show me how it could be done. Her tone was courteous, conversational. I wondered if I would get less from her today, not more. \"Do you think I should? What would I find there?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" she admitted. \"I\u0027m sure there are still plenty of people there who knew him, but I wouldn\u0027t feel comfortable putting you in touch with them myself. And I doubt he showed his moods much at school. But his greatest painting is there. It should be in a first-class museum--he should have sold it well. I\u0027m not the only one who considers it his greatest, although I\u0027ve never really liked it.\" \"Why not?\" \"Go see it for yourself.\" I sat considering her elegant, small presence across the room. I felt that I needed to know how Robert\u0027s illness had first manifested itself, and we were running out of time. And I needed, or at least wanted, to know who his dark-haired muse was. \"Would you like to go on with your story from yesterday?\" I asked her as gently as I could. If it didn\u0027t lead soon enough to information about the onset of his problems and his subsequent treatment, I could steer her carefully to those more important matters when she was warmed up. I nodded without speaking, although she hadn\u0027t said anything more yet. Outside a cardinal landed in the sunlight; a branch swayed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves/page-18.html","bookId":2244,"book":{"id":2244,"title":"The Swan Thieves","description":"Storyline: Psychiatrist Andrew Marlowe has a perfectly ordered life--solitary, perhaps, but full of devotion to his profession and the painting hobby he loves.
