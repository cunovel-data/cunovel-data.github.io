{"id":85119,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"Robert consented, stonily, to see the campus doctor, but he would not let me go with him. The health center was in walking distance of our house, like everything else, and in spite of myself I stood on the porch, watching him go. He walked with his shoulders bowed, putting one foot in front of the other as if every movement pained him. I prayed to whatever I could think of that he would be communicative enough or desperate enough to tell the doctor all his symptoms. They might have to do tests. He might be exhausted from some blood disease: mononucleosis or--God forbid--leukemia. But that wouldn\u0027t explain the dark woman. If Robert didn\u0027t report much from this visit, I would have to meet with the doctor myself and explain things, and I might have to do it in secret, so as not to anger Robert. He had apparently gone on to his classes after the appointment, or to paint at the campus studio, because I didn\u0027t see him until dinnertime. He didn\u0027t tell me anything until after I\u0027d put Ingrid down to sleep, and even then I had to ask him what the doctor had said. He was sitting in the living room--not sitting, actually, but sprawled on the sofa with an unopened book. He raised his head when I spoke to him. \"What?\" He seemed to be looking at me across a great distance, and one side of his face drooped a little, as I\u0027d noticed before. \"Oh. I didn\u0027t go.\" Rage and grief rose in me, but I took a deep breath. \"Why not?\" \"Lay off me, will you?\" he said in a thin voice. \"I didn\u0027t feel like it. I had work to do, and I haven\u0027t had time to paint in three days.\" \"Did you go paint instead?\" That, at least, would be a sign of life. \"Are you checking up on me?\" His eyes narrowed. He put the book in front of him like a breastplate. I wondered if he might even decide to throw it at me. It was a photographic essay on wolves he\u0027d bought on impulse earlier in the year. That was a change, too, his frequently buying new books he later didn\u0027t read. He\u0027d always been too thrifty to buy anything that wasn\u0027t secondhand, or much of anything at all, apart from the big well-made shoes he loved. \"I\u0027m not checking up on you,\" I said carefully. \"I\u0027m just concerned about your health, and I\u0027d like you to go to the doctor and look into it. I think just doing that will help you feel better.\" \"Do you?\" he said almost nastily. \"You think it will help me feel better. Do you have any idea how I feel? Do you know what it\u0027s like not to be able to paint, for example?\" \"Certainly,\" I said, trying not to fire up. \"There are very few days when I get to do that myself. Almost none, in fact. I know that feeling.\" \"And do you know what it\u0027s like to think about something over and over until you wonder... never mind,\" he finished. \"Until you wonder what?\" I tried to speak very calmly, to show only that I was a good listener. \"Until you can\u0027t think about or see anything else?\" His voice was low and his eyes flickered to the doorway. \"So many terrible things have happened in history, including to artists, even artists like me, who tried to have normal lives. Can you imagine what it would be like to think about that all the time?\" \"I think about terrible things sometimes, too,\" I said staunchly, although this sounded to me like a rather strange digression. \"We all have those thoughts. History is full of awful things. People\u0027s lives are full of awful things. Every thinking person reflects on them--especially when you have children. But that doesn\u0027t mean you have to make yourself ill over them.\" \"Or what if you started thinking about one person? All the time?\" My skin began to crawl, whether from fear or from anticipated jealousy or both, I couldn\u0027t have said. Here was the moment when he would wreck our lives. \"What do you mean?\" I got the words out with some difficulty. \"Someone you could have cared about,\" he said, and his eyes traveled the room again. \"But she didn\u0027t exist.\" \"What?\" I felt a long blankness in my own mind--I couldn\u0027t find the end of it. \"I\u0027ll go to the doctor tomorrow,\" he said angrily, like a little boy resigned to punishment. I knew he\u0027d agreed so that I wouldn\u0027t ask him anything more. The next day he went out and came back, slept, and then got up to eat some lunch. I stood silently beside the table. I didn\u0027t have to ask. \"He can\u0027t find anything wrong physically--well, he took a blood test for anemia and some other things, but he wants me to get a psychiatric evaluation.\" He put the words deliberately out into the room, so that something in them rang just short of contempt, but I knew that his telling me at all meant he was afraid, and willing to go. I went to him and put my arms around him and caressed his head, the heavy curls, the massive forehead, feeling that surprising mind inside, the vast gifts I had always admired and wondered about. I touched his face. I loved that head, his crisp uncontrollable hair. \"I\u0027m sure everything will be all right,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll go for you.\" His voice was so quiet I could hardly hear it, and then he put his arms tightly around my waist and leaned over to bury his face against me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves/page-28.html","bookId":2244,"book":{"id":2244,"title":"The Swan Thieves","description":"Storyline: Psychiatrist Andrew Marlowe has a perfectly ordered life--solitary, perhaps, but full of devotion to his profession and the painting hobby he loves. This order is destroyed when renowned painter Robert Oliver attacks a canvas in the National Gallery of Art and becomes his patient. In response, Marlowe finds himself going beyond his own legal and ethical boundaries to understand the secret that torments this genius, a journey that will lead him into the lives of the women closest to Robert Oliver and toward a tragedy at the heart of French Impressionism. Ranging from American museums to the coast of Normandy, from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth, from young love to last love, THE SWAN THIEVES is a story of obsession, the losses of history, and the power of art to preserve human hope.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-swan-thieves.jpg","author":"Elizabeth Kostova","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:47 PM"}}
