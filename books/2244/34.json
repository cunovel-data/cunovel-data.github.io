I had hidden the letters in the dining-room sideboard, with the exception of the one in Robert\u0027s handwriting, which I put in my pocket, and I sat him down at the table to talk. He was impatient to be off to school, but his body stilled when I asked him if he realized that I knew what was going on. He frowned. Now I was the one trembling--with rage or fear, I wasn\u0027t yet certain. \"What do you mean?\" His frown seemed genuine. He was wearing something dark, and his remarkable handsomeness leapt out at me, as it sometimes did, without warning--the regal body, the strong features. \"First question--do you see her at school? Do you see her every day? Did she come here from New York, maybe?\" He leaned back. \"See who at school?\" \"The woman.\" I said. \"The woman in all your paintings. Does she model for you at school or in New York?\" He began to glower. \"What? I thought we\u0027d been through this before.\" \"Do you see her every day? Or does she send you letters from a distance?\" \"Send me letters?\" He looked flabbergasted at this, pale. Guilt, surely. \"Don\u0027t bother to answer. I know she does.\" \"You know she does? What do you know?\" There was anger in his eyes but also bewilderment. \"I know because I found her letters to you.\" Now he was staring at me as if he had no words, as if he actually didn\u0027t know what to say. I had seldom seen him so disoriented, at least not in response to something from outside himself. He put both hands on the table, where they rested against the sheen of the grain, Mom\u0027s polishing. \"You found letters from her to me?\" The strange thing was that he didn\u0027t sound ashamed. If I\u0027d had to characterize his voice and face at that moment, I would have said he seemed somehow eager, alarmed, hopeful. It enraged me--the note in his voice made me realize that he loved her uncontrollably, loved even the mention of her. \"Yes!\" I shouted, jumping to my feet and pulling the pile of notes from under the place mats in the sideboard. \"Yes, I even know her name, you stupid fool! I know it\u0027s Mary. Why did you leave them in this house if you didn\u0027t want me to find out?\" I dropped them in front of him on the table, and he picked one up. \"Yes, Mary,\" he said, and then he glanced up and began almost to smile, but sadly. \"That\u0027s nothing. Well, not nothing, but not so important.\" I began to cry in spite of myself, and I felt it was not because of what he\u0027d done so much as what he\u0027d seen me do, that dramatic pulling out of letters and tossing them down in front of him. It was as humiliating as I ever could have dreamed. \"You think it\u0027s nothing that you love another woman? What about this?\" I pulled his own scrap of letter from my pocket, the one indisputably in his handwriting, crumpled it up, and hurled it at him. He caught it and smoothed it out on the table. I thought I read disbelief in his face. Then he seemed to rally. \"Kate, what the hell do you care? She\u0027s dead. She\u0027s dead!\" He was white around the nose and lips, his face rigid. \"She died. Do you think I wouldn\u0027t give anything to have saved her, to have let her go on painting?\" Now I was sobbing in confusion as much as anything else. \"She\u0027s dead?\" The one dated letter from Mary meant she must have been alive even a couple of months before. I had the weird social impulse to say, Oh, I\u0027m so sorry. Had she been in a car accident? Why had he not acted traumatized these last months or weeks? Nothing had seemed different. Perhaps whatever the relationship had been, he\u0027d cared so little, actually, that he hadn\u0027t grieved for her. But this struck me as terrible in itself--could a person be that coldhearted? \"Yes. She is dead.\" He gave the word a bitterness I wouldn\u0027t have thought him capable of. \"And I still love her. You\u0027re damn right about that, if that satisfies you. I don\u0027t know why you should care. I love her. And if you don\u0027t understand the kind of love I mean, I\u0027m not going to explain.\" He stood up. \"It doesn\u0027t satisfy me.\" Now that I had started weeping, I couldn\u0027t stop. \"It makes it all worse. I don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve been up to or what you mean. You have no idea how hard I\u0027ve tried to understand you. But we\u0027re done, Robert, and that satisfies me--that does satisfy me.\" I picked up our Chinese vase from the sideboard, where it had always sat well out of child-reach, and threw it across the room. It smashed to heartrending bits on the hearth, under the portraits of my father\u0027s parents, stalwart people from Cincinnati. I regretted its destruction already. I regretted everything, except my children.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves/page-34.html","bookId":2244,"book":{"id":2244,"title":"The Swan Thieves","description":"Storyline: Psychiatrist Andrew Marlowe has a perfectly ordered life--solitary, perhaps, but full of devotion to his profession and the painting hobby he loves. This order is destroyed when renowned painter Robert Oliver attacks a canvas in the National Gallery of Art and becomes his patient. In response, Marlowe finds himself going beyond his own legal and ethical boundaries to understand the secret that torments this genius, a journey that will lead him into the lives of the women closest to Robert Oliver and toward a tragedy at the heart of French Impressionism. Ranging from American museums to the coast of Normandy, from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth, from young love to last love, THE SWAN THIEVES is a story of obsession, the losses of history, and the power of art to preserve human hope.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-swan-thieves.jpg","author":"Elizabeth Kostova","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:47 PM"}}
