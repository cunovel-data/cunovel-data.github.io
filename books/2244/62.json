{"id":85153,"no":62,"title":"Page 62","content":"When lunch was over, Robert left us and strolled off into the woods--to pee, I realized eventually, something I managed myself as soon as the three men were all safely at work again; I had a bit of tissue in my pocket, which I buried under the damp leaves and lichen-covered branches. After lunch we started new canvases to accommodate the change in light, and then painted for hours more. I began to realize that Frank\u0027s assessment of Robert\u0027s dedication to nature was an accurate one. He didn\u0027t come over to look at anyone\u0027s work after all, and I was relieved as well as a little disappointed. My legs and back ached, and I began to see plates of dinner in front of me rather than the textures of water and firs.\n Finally, just before four o\u0027clock, Robert circulated slowly among us, making suggestions, listening to problems, calling us together once to ask what we thought about the differences between morning and afternoon light in that landscape, commenting that painting a cliff was no different than painting an eyelid--we had to remember that light revealed form no matter what the object. He finally stopped by my easel, and stood examining the canvas with his arms folded. \"The trees are very good,\" he said. \"Really very good. Look, if you put a darker shadow on this side of the island--do you mind?\" I shook my head, and he borrowed a brush. \"Don\u0027t be afraid to make a shadow darker if you need contrast,\" he murmured, and I saw my island swell into geological reality under his hand. And didn\u0027t mind his improving my work. \"There. I won\u0027t mess with it any more--I want to let you get on with it.\" He touched my arm with his big fingers and left me, and I worked deeply, almost blindly, until the sun began to sink enough to interfere with true visibility.\n \"I\u0027m hungry,\" Frank hissed, leaning over into my space. \"This guy is a crazy man. Aren\u0027t you starving? Cool trees,\" he added. \"You must like trees.\"\n I tried to make some sense of his words but couldn\u0027t, couldn\u0027t even say, \"What?\" I was completely stiff, chilled under my sweatshirt and the cotton scarf I\u0027d wrapped around my neck as the ocean breeze grew cooler; I hadn\u0027t painted this hard in a long, long time, although I worked almost every day, around the edges of my job. I had one other thing to ask Robert, now that I\u0027d concentrated so deeply on my shadows and needed to add some flecks of white to the whole scene, to brighten it. Should I wait and add the white tomorrow, in something closer to the light with which we\u0027d begun, or do it now--quickly, from memory?\n I made my way down the slope to Robert\u0027s easel, where he was beginning to clean his brushes and scrape his palette. He stopped every few seconds to look back at his canvas and out at the view. It occurred to me that he\u0027d forgotten for a while to teach us anything, and I felt a pang of sympathy; he, too, had been absorbed, beyond consciousness, in the movement of brush and hand, fingers, wrist. We could learn just from being near that kind of obsession, I thought. I stood in front of his work. He made it seem easy, this viewing of basic forms and blocking them in, adding color, touching them with light--the trees, the water, the rocks, the narrow beach below. The surface wasn\u0027t finished; he, like us, would probably be working on this same canvas at least another whole afternoon, if there was time. The forms would expand later to full reality; the details of branch, leaf, and wave would be touched in here and there.\n But one section of his canvas was beautifully complete. I wondered why he had finished it ahead of the rest: the rugged beach and pale rocks stretching out into the ocean, the soft colors of stone and reddish seaweed. We were at some height from the edge of the water, and he\u0027d caught that sense of looking down, or aslant, at the two distant figures walking hand in hand along the shore, the smaller bent over as if to pluck something from a tidal pool, the taller upright. They were just clear enough, close enough, so that I could see the woman\u0027s long skirts pulled back in the wind, the child\u0027s bonnet hanging by its blue ribbons, two people companion-ably alone where there had been no one but a painting class on the hill above all afternoon. I found myself staring at them, then at him; Robert touched the woman\u0027s minuscule shoe with a brush, as if polishing its toe, then wiped the sable hairs again. I\u0027d forgotten what my question had been--something about the changing light.\n He turned to me with a smile, as if he\u0027d known I was there and had even known who I was. \"Have you had a good afternoon?\"\n \"Very good,\" I said. His relaxed manner made me feel it would be silly to ask him why he\u0027d put two fictional figures into the summer scene before us. He was known for his nineteenth-century references, and he had every right, as Robert Oliver, to stick whatever he wanted into a lesson in landscape. I hoped someone else would ask him instead.\n Then I hoped something different: that I would someday know him well enough to ask him anything. He glanced at me, the friendly, distant expression I remembered from college--a puzzle, a cipher of a face. Where his shirt collar parted over his chest, I saw tufts of silvered dark hair. I wanted to reach out and touch that hair, to see if age had softened it or made it wiry--which? He had rolled his sleeves almost to the elbow. Now he stood in his familiar tall-man\u0027s pose, his arms crossed, hands holding up his bare elbows, his legs braced against the hill\u0027s slant. \"It\u0027s a hell of a view,\" he said companionably. \"And I guess we should clear out for dinner now.\" It was a hell of a view, I could have pointed out, but it didn\u0027t include any figures in long dresses skirting the tide. No shore could have been more strikingly empty--a landscape without people, which had been the point of the exercise, hadn\u0027t it?\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves/page-62.html","bookId":2244,"book":{"id":2244,"title":"The Swan Thieves","description":"Storyline: \n Psychiatrist Andrew Marlowe has a perfectly ordered life--solitary, perhaps, but full of devotion to his profession and the painting hobby he loves. This order is destroyed when renowned painter Robert Oliver attacks a canvas in the National Gallery of Art and becomes his patient.

Ranging from American museums to the coast of Normandy, from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth, from young love to last love, THE SWAN THIEVES is a story of obsession, the losses of history, and the power of art to preserve human hope.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-swan-thieves.jpg","author":"Elizabeth Kostova","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:47 PM"}}
