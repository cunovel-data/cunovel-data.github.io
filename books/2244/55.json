{"id":85146,"no":55,"title":"Page 55","content":"When I woke, my father was standing in the doorway with a smile, and I realized that the creaking of the stairs as he made his slow way up them had been my alarm clock. \"I know you don\u0027t like to nap too long,\" he said apologetically. \"Oh, I don\u0027t.\" I struggled to one elbow. The clock on my wall said it was already five thirty. \"Would you like to go for a walk?\" I liked to get my father out walking whenever I visited, and he brightened. \"Certainly,\" he said. \"Shall we go walk out Duck Lane?\" I knew this meant to my mother\u0027s grave, and my heart was not in it today, but for his sake I agreed at once, sat up, and began to put on my shoes. I heard my father make his way back downstairs, holding the railing, no doubt, and bringing both feet to each step before moving on; I was thankful for his caution, although I couldn\u0027t help remembering the quick thud of his feet coming down to breakfast or clattering back up for a forgotten book before he went to the church office. We walked slowly along the road, too, his hand on my arm and his hat on his head, and I could see on each side the beginning of summer, cool and shifting by the moment, bulrushes in the marsh, a crow rising out of them, some late-afternoon sun breaking over the neighbors\u0027 houses with the dates above their front doors--1792, 1814 (that one had just missed the British invasion, I realized, and the mayor\u0027s civil refusal to have his town burned). As I\u0027d known he would, my father paused in front of the gates to the cemetery, which stood open until dark, and gave my arm the gentlest pressure; we went in together past lichen-stained markers that bore the names of forgotten founders, a few with that winged Puritan skull at the top to warn us of the end to which we all come whether we\u0027ve sinned or no, and then back to the more recent graves. My mother\u0027s sat next to a family named Penrose, whom we\u0027d never known, and the plot was big enough to accommodate my father\u0027s presence once he joined her. I thought for the first time that I ought to decide whether or not to purchase a plot here; unlike them, I\u0027d already opted to donate my body to science, then be cremated, but perhaps there was room to stick an urn between my parents; I imagined the three of us sleeping together forever in this king-size bed, my reduced self between their protective bodies. The image wasn\u0027t real enough to me to give me any further regrets; what lowered my spirits was the sight of my mother\u0027s name and her dates, chiseled in simple letters on the granite, her too-fleeting years--what was the line from Shakespeare, the sonnet? Something, something-- \"and summer\u0027s lease hath all too short a date.\" I quoted it aloud to my father, who had bent to remove a branch from the plot, and he smiled and shook his head. \"There\u0027s a better sonnet for this occasion.\" He threw the branch slowly but with sure aim into the bushes near the fence. \"\u0027But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,/All losses are restor\u0027d, and sorrows end.\u0027\" I felt he meant me, his remaining friend, as well as my mother, and was grateful. I had tried in recent years to think of her at peace, not as I\u0027d seen her in those last minutes, struggling against her departure from us. I wondered, as I often did, which was worse, the fact that she\u0027d had to die at fifty-four or the way she\u0027d gone. They went together, those two sad realities, but I never tired of trying to tease them apart, to extricate one misery from the other. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to take my father\u0027s arm as we stood there, or put mine around him, and I was very touched when he did just that for me, his skinny old hand gripping my back. \"I grieve for her, too, Andrew,\" he said matter-of-factly, \"but you learn that a person is not so far away, especially when you\u0027re my age.\" I refrained from pointing out the usual difference in our perspectives: I believed the extent of my reunion with my mother would be the mingling, over millions of years, of the atoms that had composed our bodies. \"Yes, I feel her nearby sometimes, when I\u0027m doing my best.\" I couldn\u0027t say more around the fist in my throat, so I didn\u0027t try, and for some reason I remembered Mary, sitting on my sofa in her white blouse and blue jeans, telling me that she didn\u0027t want to see Robert Oliver ever again. There are different ways of taking grief in different circumstances; my mother had never abandoned me, except unwillingly, in those minutes that had constituted her good-bye. We walked a bit farther up Duck Lane, and then my father indicated with a little pause and a shuffling turn that he\u0027d had enough, and we ambled back to the house even more slowly. I commented that the neighborhood had remained tranquil despite the new expansion of the town to the west, and he said he was grateful for the presence of the river, which had prevented the interstate from coming any closer. The very quiet of the street worried me; how much company could my father have here, when we hadn\u0027t seen a single neighbor outside since setting out on our excursion? My father nodded, as if the silence around him was all to the good. At our own front walk, I paused to say something else I\u0027d thought in the cemetery but had been unable to utter--not my longing for Mother but the other ghost who had haunted me there. \"Dad? I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve been doing the right thing. This patient I told you about.\" He understood at once. \"You mean, by questioning the people close to him?\" I put a hand on one of the trunks of our arborvitae. It had the hairy, peeling texture I remembered from my childhood, the hardness of the wood itself just underneath. \"Yes. He gave me verbal consent, but--\" \"Do you mean because he doesn\u0027t know you\u0027re doing it, or because you aren\u0027t sure of your own motives?\" As always, when I approached him about something important, I was left a little speechless at his shrewdness. I hadn\u0027t actually told him either of those things. \"Both, I guess.\" \"Look at your motives first, then, I think, and the rest will fall into place.\" \"I will. Thanks.\" Over dinner, which I insisted on making for us, and our subsequent game at the chess table in the living room--he laid and lit a fire by sitting on a low chair near the fireplace and poking sticks into the grate--he told me about his writing projects and about a woman ten years younger than he was who drove over from Essex once or twice a month to read aloud to him, although he could still read to himself. This was the first he\u0027d said about her, and I asked how he\u0027d met her, a little surprised. \"She used to live here and come to the church before I retired, and then she and her husband moved away, but not far, so later they would come to hear my annual emeritus sermon. He died and I didn\u0027t hear from her for a long time, but she finally sent a note and now we have these nice meetings. At my age, it can\u0027t be much, of course,\" he added, \"or at hers, but it means a little companionship.\" I knew he was saying, too, that he could never love anyone but my mother and me enough to rearrange his short future. He reached for his queen and then changed his mind. \"What sort of company do you keep these days?\" he asked me. This was a rare question from him, and I welcomed it. \"You know I\u0027m a worse old bachelor than you are, Dad. But I almost think I\u0027ve met someone.\" \"The young woman, you mean,\" he said mildly. \"Right? The one your patient abandoned most recently.\" \"I can\u0027t put anything over on you.\" I watched him move a bishop out of harm\u0027s way. \"Yes. But she really is too young for me, and I think she\u0027s still wrapped up in what this other man did to her.\" I didn\u0027t add that my relationship with her was complicated by my having used her for professional research, or that even if she was now single, she had been my patient\u0027s lover and was therefore an ethical puzzle; all that would be equally obvious to my father. \"Recently abandoned women can be complicated.\" \"And she\u0027s not only complicated but independent, unusual, beautiful,\" my father said. \"Of course.\" I pretended to be alarmed for my king\u0027s safety, to amuse him. He wasn\u0027t fooled. \"And you are worried, first of all, because she recently belonged to your patient.\" \"Well, it\u0027s hardly a matter to overlook.\" \"But she\u0027s single now, and done with him, in practical terms?\" He gave me a sharp glance. I was glad to be able to nod. \"Yes, I very much think so.\" \"How old is she, exactly?\" \"Early thirties. She teaches painting at a local university and paints a good deal on her own as well. I haven\u0027t seen her work, but I have the sense she\u0027s probably quite good. She\u0027s done all kinds of odd jobs in order to pursue her painting seriously. She has guts.\" \"Your mother was in her twenties when I married her. And I was quite a few years older than she was.\" \"I know, Dad. But that was a much smaller gap. And not everyone is meant for marriage the way you and Mother were.\" \"Everyone is meant for it,\" he observed with a flash of pleasure; in the gentle light from lamp and fire, he was calling my bluff. He knew I\u0027d never risk my king, even to let him win. \"The problem is simply finding the right person. Ask Plato. Just make sure she finishes your thoughts and you finish hers. That\u0027s all you need.\" \"I know, I know.\" \"And then you must say to her, \u0027Madame, I observe that your heart is broken. Allow me to repair it for you.\u0027 \" \"I wouldn\u0027t have thought you had that in you, Dad.\" He laughed. \"Oh, I could never have said it to any woman myself.\" \"But then you didn\u0027t need to, did you?\" He shook his head, his eyes bluer than usual. \"I didn\u0027t need to. Besides, if I\u0027d ever said such a thing to your mother, she\u0027d have told me to pull myself together and take out the garbage for her.\" And kissed you on the forehead as she said it. \"Dad, why don\u0027t you come to New York with me tomorrow? I\u0027m going to the museum, and there\u0027s an extra bed in my hotel room. It\u0027s been a long time since you got down there.\" He sighed. \"That\u0027s an unimaginably big trip for me now. I couldn\u0027t walk around properly with you. Even the grocery store is an odyssey these days.\" \"I understand.\" But I couldn\u0027t help persisting; I didn\u0027t want this to be the end, already, of his seeing the world. \"Well, then, wouldn\u0027t you like to come visit me in Washington this summer? I\u0027ll come up and drive you down. Or maybe in the fall, when it cools off?\" \"Thank you, Andrew.\" He put me in check. \"I\u0027ll think about it.\" I knew he wouldn\u0027t. \"How about at least getting your glasses replaced, Cyril?\" It was an old joke, that I could use his first name when I had a special request to make of him. \"Don\u0027t be a common scold, my boy.\" He was grinning at the board now, and I decided to let him win, which he almost had anyway; certainly he was having no problem seeing the pieces.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves/page-55.html","bookId":2244,"book":{"id":2244,"title":"The Swan Thieves","description":"Storyline: Psychiatrist Andrew Marlowe has a perfectly ordered life--solitary, perhaps, but full of devotion to his profession and the painting hobby he loves. This order is destroyed when renowned painter Robert Oliver attacks a canvas in the National Gallery of Art and becomes his patient. In response, Marlowe finds himself going beyond his own legal and ethical boundaries to understand the secret that torments this genius, a journey that will lead him into the lives of the women closest to Robert Oliver and toward a tragedy at the heart of French Impressionism. Ranging from American museums to the coast of Normandy, from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth, from young love to last love, THE SWAN THIEVES is a story of obsession, the losses of history, and the power of art to preserve human hope.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-swan-thieves.jpg","author":"Elizabeth Kostova","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:47 PM"}}
