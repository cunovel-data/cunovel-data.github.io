The skylighted entryway was lined with canvases and softly bright glass cases filled with ceramics.\n Arnold indicated a big painting opposite the door, and I saw at once what he meant--it was bizarre, terribly alive and yet over-dramatic, stilted like a Victorian stage piece. It showed a woman in billowing skirts and fitted bodice, her slender body bent over. She was kneeling on a roughly cobbled street; as Arnold had promised, she cradled in her arms an older woman, sickeningly dead. The older woman\u0027s face was ashen, her eyes closed, her mouth slack, and through her forehead was a bullet hole, a distinct horrible tunnel drilled there, so that a gush of blood was already drying down one side of her loosened hair and shawl.\n The younger woman had been elegantly dressed, but her pale-green gown was dirty and torn, stained with blood on the front where she clasped the murdered woman\u0027s head against her. Her own lustrous, curly hair had come undone, her hat fell by its ribbons onto her shoulder, her face was bent over the dead woman\u0027s so that I couldn\u0027t see the luminous eyes I was already so used to meeting. The background was hazier, but it seemed to be a wall, a narrow city street, one storefront overhung with words whose letters blurred in the paint, unreadable, figures in red and blue crouching nearby but indistinguishable. There were piles of something at one end--brown, beige--chopped wood? Sandbags? A lumberyard?\n The whole thing was riveting but also purposely overdone, it seemed to me, appalling as well as moving. It smelled of fear and hopelessness. The pose, the grief in it, made me remember my first glimpse of the Michelangelo Pieta--a work too famous for anyone to look at it clearly anymore, except perhaps when one is young enough. I\u0027d seen it on my trip to Italy after college; at that time it was not yet behind glass, so I was separated from the figures by only a rope and a distance of five feet or so. The daylight coming down on Mary and Jesus touched them with different tones, and it was as if both bodies were alive, the blood pulsing in their veins--not only the grieving mother but also the freshly dead son. The incredibly touching thing was that he wasn\u0027t dead. For me, without faith, it was not a prediction of resurrection but a portrayal of Mary\u0027s shock, and of the lingering aliveness one sees in the hospital when a young person is wrested out of life by some terrible injury. I learned, in that moment, the difference between genius and everything else.\n What struck me most about Robert\u0027s painting, apart from the horror of the scene, was that it was narrative, whereas all the images I\u0027d seen of his lady before this were portraits. But what was the story? Possibly Robert hadn\u0027t been using any models at all; I remembered what Kate had said about how he sometimes drew and painted from his imagination. Or perhaps he\u0027d been using models but had invented the story--the nineteenth-century dress would support this idea. Had he dreamed up his lady character holding her murdered mother? Perhaps he\u0027d even been painting his own bright and dark sides, the two parts of his psyche divided by illness. I hadn\u0027t expected Robert Oliver to come up with actual stories.\n \"You don\u0027t like it either?\" Arnold looked pleased.\n \"It\u0027s very skillful,\" I said. \"Which one of these is yours?\"\n \"Oh, on this wall,\" Arnold said, gesturing toward a large canvas behind us, next to the door. He folded his arms in front of it. It was abstract, large soft squares of pale blue melting into one another, a silver sheen over it all, as if you could drop a square pebble in water and it would make concentric squares. It was rather appealing, actually. I turned to Arnold and smiled. \"I do like this.\"\n \"Thanks,\" he said cheerfully. \"I\u0027m doing yellow now.\" We stood gazing at the blue, Arnold\u0027s child of a couple of years earlier, Arnold with his head fondly to one side; I could see he hadn\u0027t really looked at it in a while. \"Well,\" he said.\n \"Yes, I should let you get back to office hours,\" I told him gratefully. \"You\u0027ve been very kind.\"\n \"If you talk with Robert again, tell him I said hello,\" he prompted. \"Tell him he\u0027s not forgotten here, no matter what.\"\n \"I\u0027ll certainly tell him,\" I--lied?\n \"Send me a copy of that article if you think of it,\" he added, waving me out the door.\n I nodded and then shook my head and covered my error with some return waving before I got into my car, but he was gone. I sat behind the steering wheel for a moment, trying not to actually put my head in my hands. Then I got out again, slowly, feeling the eyes of the building on me, and went back into the gallery. I walked deliberately past the paintings in the entryway, the platforms of glowing bowls and vases, the linen and wool tapestries. I went into the main hall and viewed one by one the student paintings hung on show there, reading the placards without remembering them, staring at the glaze of red, green, gold--trees, fruit, mountains, flowers, cubes, motorcycles, words, a jumble of work, some of it excellent, some of it surprisingly clumsy. I looked at every item until the colors whirled, and then, slowly, I went back to Robert\u0027s painting.\n She was still there, of course, bending over her terrible burden, pressing the loosened floppy head with its bullet hole against the green curve of her breast, her own face concentrated with grief rather than slack, her jaw set against tears, her dark eyebrows drawn together in a fine, furious, unbelieving misery, her anger showing also in the line of her shoulder, her skirts still trembling from her swift movement: she had knelt on the dirty street and seized the precious body. She knew and loved the dead woman; this was no abstract mercy. It was an incredible painting. With all my training, I couldn\u0027t begin to figure out how Robert had conveyed such emotion, such motion, in paint; I could see some of the strokes he\u0027d used, the blends of color, but the life with which he\u0027d imbued the living woman and the lifelessness with which he portrayed the dead one were beyond my understanding. If it was a work of the imagination, that made it all the more horrifying. How could the college bear to have this image hanging in front of its students day after day?\n I stood gazing at her until she seemed about to start up with a cry of anguish or a call for help, or run, or brace her lovely back and waist to try to raise and carry the heavy body. At any moment something might happen; that was the remarkable thing. He had caught the instant of shock, of total change, of disbelief. I put my hand to my throat and felt my own warmth there. I waited for her to lift her head. Would I--this was the question--would I be able to help her if she looked up? She was inches away from me, breathing and real, in the second of unreal calm before complete distress, and I knew myself powerless. I realized then, for the first time, what Robert had accomplished. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves/page-39.html","bookId":2244,"book":{"id":2244,"title":"The Swan Thieves","description":"Storyline: \n Psychiatrist Andrew Marlowe has a perfectly ordered life--solitary, perhaps, but full of devotion to his profession and the painting hobby he loves.
