{"id":85121,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"Robert insisted on visiting the psychiatrist alone, and when he returned he told me matter-of-factly that he had some medication to try and the name and number of a therapist. He didn\u0027t say whether or not he would call the therapist, or whether he would take the medication. I couldn\u0027t figure out where he\u0027d even put it, and I decided not to pry for a week or two. I would just wait to see what he did and encourage him in any way I could. Eventually, the bottle appeared in our medicine cabinet in the bathroom-- lithium. I heard it rattle morning and night when he took a dose. Within a week, Robert seemed calmer and began to paint again, although he slept at least twelve hours out of every twenty-four and ate in a daze. I was thankful that he was holding his studio classes without further interruptions and that I hadn\u0027t perceived any unease on the part of the college, although how such unease would have reached me I wasn\u0027t sure. One day Robert told me that the psychiatrist wanted to see me and that he, Robert, thought it was a good idea. He had an appointment that afternoon--I wondered why he hadn\u0027t mentioned it sooner--and when the time came, I packed Ingrid into her car seat because it was short notice to find a babysitter. The mountains flowed by, and I realized as I watched them pass that I hadn\u0027t even been to town in a while. My life revolved around the house, the sandbox and swings when it was warm enough outside, the supermarket up the road. I watched Robert\u0027s grave profile as he drove and finally asked him why he thought the psychiatrist wanted to see me. \"He likes to get a family member\u0027s perspective,\" he said, and added, \"He thinks I\u0027m doing well so far. On lithium.\" It was the first time he\u0027d mentioned the drug by name. \"Do you think so, too?\" I put my hand on his thigh, feeling the muscles shift when he braked. \"I feel pretty good,\" he said. \"I doubt I\u0027ll need it for long. I wish I weren\u0027t so tired, though--I need the energy to paint.\" To paint, I thought, hut to be with us, too? He fell asleep after dinner without playing with Ingrid, and was often still asleep when I left on my walks with her in the morning. I said nothing more. The clinic was a long, low building made of expensive-looking wood and planted around with raw little trees in paper tubes. Robert went in matter-of-factly, holding the door for me as I passed through with Ingrid in my arms. The waiting room inside, which seemed to serve a number of doctors, was spacious, with a large patch of sunlight at one end. Eventually a man came out, smiled and nodded at Robert, and called me by name. He didn\u0027t wear a white coat or carry a chart--he was dressed in a jacket and tie, ironed khaki trousers. I glanced at Robert, who shook his head. \"This is for you,\" he said. \"He wants to talk with you. He\u0027ll call me in, too, if he needs me.\" So I left Ingrid with Robert and followed Dr. --well, what does his name matter? He was kind and middle-aged and doing his job. His office was lined with framed diplomas and certificates, his desk very neat, a large bronze paperweight sitting on the only loose piece of paper. I sat down facing the desk, my arms empty without Ingrid. I wished now I\u0027d brought her in, and it worried me that Robert might put his face back in his hands instead of watching her cruise past electrical outlets and floral arrangements. But when I studied Dr. Q a little, I found I liked him. His face was gentle and reminded me of my Michigan grandfather\u0027s. When he spoke, his voice was deep, a little guttural, as if he had come from somewhere else as a teenager and whatever his accent was had become untraceable, just a slight rasping on the consonants. \"Thank you for coming to see me today, Mrs. Oliver,\" he said. \"It\u0027s helpful to me to talk with a close family member, especially with any new patient.\" \"I\u0027m glad to,\" I answered honestly. \"I\u0027ve been really worried about Robert.\" \"Of course you have.\" He rearranged the paperweight, leaned back in his seat, looked at me. \"I know this must have been hard for you. Please be sure that I am paying very close attention to Robert and I\u0027m satisfied that our first trial of medication is having a good effect.\" \"He certainly seems calmer,\" I admitted. \"Can you tell me a little about what you first noticed in his behavior that seemed different or that concerned you? Robert has told me that you were the one who got him to see a doctor originally.\" I folded my hands and recited our problems, Robert\u0027s problems, the dizzying ups and downs of the last year. Dr. Q listened silently, without changing expression, and his expression was kind. \"And he seems to you more stable on the lithium?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"He sleeps a lot still, and he complains about that, but he does seem able to get up and go to teach almost all the time. He complains about not being able to paint.\" \"It takes time to adjust to new medication, and it takes time to find out what medication works and what dosage works.\" Dr. Q arranged the paperweight thoughtfully again, this time in the top left corner of the one paper. \"I do think in your husband\u0027s case it\u0027s important for him to take lithium for a while, and he will probably need it permanently, or some other medication if this one doesn\u0027t turn out to be just what we want. The process will require quite a bit of patience on his part--and on yours.\" I began to feel new alarm. \"Do you mean you think he will always have these problems? Won\u0027t he be able to stop the medicine when he\u0027s better?\" The doctor recentered the bronze lump on the document. It reminded me suddenly of that childhood game--rock, paper, scissors--where one element could win out over the other, but something else could always win out over the winner, a fascinating cycle. \"It takes some time to develop any accurate diagnosis. But I believe Robert is probably experiencing--\" And then he told me the name of an illness, one I knew only vaguely and associated with nameless things, things that had nothing to do with me, things that people were given electric shock therapy for, or that caused them to kill themselves. I sat there for a few seconds, trying to fit these words to Robert, my husband. My whole body was bathed in cold. \"Are you telling me that my husband is mentally ill?\" \"We don\u0027t really know what part of any condition is mental illness and what is environmental or a function of personality,\" Dr. Q demurred, and I hated him for the first time--he was hedging. \"Robert may stabilize on this medication, or we may have to try some other things. I think given his intelligence and his dedication to his art and his family, you can be hopeful that he\u0027ll achieve quite a bit.\" But it was too late. Robert was no longer only Robert for me. He was someone with a diagnosis. I knew already that nothing would be the same, ever, no matter how much I tried to feel about Robert as I had before. My heart ached for him, but it ached even more for myself. Dr. Q had taken away the dearest thing I had, and he clearly didn\u0027t know what that felt like. He had nothing to give me in return, just the view of his hand arranging his empty desk. I wished he\u0027d had the grace to apologize.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-swan-thieves/page-30.html","bookId":2244,"book":{"id":2244,"title":"The Swan Thieves","description":"Storyline: Psychiatrist Andrew Marlowe has a perfectly ordered life--solitary, perhaps, but full of devotion to his profession and the painting hobby he loves.
