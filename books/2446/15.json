I looked over to tell Harkat about a weird dream I\u0027d had - full of black panthers, giant toads and dragons - but when I did, I saw that I was in a poorly built shack. There was a strange man standing close by, studying me with beady eyes and stroking a long curved knife.\\n\\n \"Who are you?\" I shouted, falling out of the hammock. \"Where am I?\"\\n\\n \"Easy,\" the man chuckled, laying his knife aside. \"Sorry t\u0027 trouble ye, young \u0027un. I was watching over ye while ye slept. We get an awful lot o\u0027 crabs and scorpions here. I didn\u0027t want \u0027em getting stuck into ye while ye was recovering. Harkat!\" he bellowed. \"Yer wee friend\u0027s awake!\"\\n\\n The door to the shack swung open and Harkat stepped in. The three scars from his fight with the panther were as prominent as usual, but he didn\u0027t look any the worse for wear otherwise. \"Afternoon, Sleeping Beauty,\" he grinned. \"You\u0027ve been out for - almost two days.\"\\n\\n \"Where are we?\" I asked, standing shakily. \"And who\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n \"Spits Abrams,\" the stranger introduced himself, stepping forward into the beam of sunlight shining through a large hole in the roof. He was a broad, bearded man of medium height, with small eyes and bushy eyebrows. His black hair was long and curly, tied back with coloured pieces of string. He wore a faded brown jacket and trousers, a dirty white vest, and knee-high black boots. He was smiling and I could see that he was missing several teeth, while the others were discoloured and jagged. \"Spits Abrams,\" he said again, sticking out a hand. \"Pleased t\u0027 meet ye.\"\\n\\n I took the man\u0027s hand - he had a strong grip - and shook it warily, wondering who he was and how I\u0027d wound up here.\\n\\n \"Spits rescued you from the lake,\" Harkat said. \"He saw the dragon attack - and drop you. He dragged you out and was - waiting for you to dry whenI waded out. He got a shock when - he saw me, but I convinced him I was harmless. We carried you here, to his - home. We\u0027ve been waiting for you - to wake.\"\\n\\n \"Many thanks, Mr Abrams,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Tain\u0027t nowt t\u0027 be thanking me fer,\" he laughed. \"I jest fished ye out, same as any other fisherman would\u0027ve.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a fisherman?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Of a sort,\" he beamed. \"I used t\u0027 be a pirate \u0027fore I ended up here, and \u0027twas people I fished fer. But since there ain\u0027t much grows round these parts, I\u0027ve been eating mostly fish since I came - and fishing fer em.\"\\n\\n \"A pirate?\" I blinked. \"A real one?\"\\n\\n \"Aaarrr, Darren lad,\" he growled, then winked.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go outside,\" Harkat said, seeing my confusion. \"There\u0027s food on the fire and - your clothes are dry and repaired.\"\\n\\n I realized I was only wearing my underpants, so I hurried out after Harkat, found my clothes hanging on a tree, and slipped them on. We were close to the edge of the lake, on a meagre green patch amidst a long stretch of rocky soil. The shack was built in the shelter of two small trees. There was a tiny garden out back.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s where I grows me potatoes,\" Spits said. \"Not fer eating - though I has one \u0027r two when I takes a fancy - but fer brewing poteen. My grandfather came from Connemara - in Ireland - and he used t\u0027 make a living from it. He taught me all his secrets. I never bothered before I washed up here - I prefer whisky - but since spuds is all I can grow, I has t\u0027 make do.\"\\n\\n Dressed, I sat by the fire and Spits offered me one of the fish speared on sticks over the flames. Biting into the fish, I ate ravenously, silently studying Spits Abrams, not sure what to make of him.\\n\\n \"Want some poteen to wash that down with?\" Spits asked.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t,\" Harkat advised me. \"I tried it and it made - my eyes water.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll give it a miss then,\" I said. Harkat had a high tolerance for alcohol, and could drink just about anything. If the poteen had made his eyes water, it\u0027d probably blow my head clean off my neck.\\n\\n \"Yerra, go on,\" Spits encouraged me, passing over a jug filled with a clear liquid. \"It might blind ye, but Won\u0027t kill ye. \u0027Twill put hairs on yer chest!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m hairy enough,\" I chuckled, then leant forward, nudging the jug of poteen aside. \"I don\u0027t want to be rude, Spits, but who are you and how did you get here?\"\\n\\n Spits laughed at the question. \"That\u0027s what this \u0027un asked too, the first time he saw me,\" he said, pointing at Harkat with his thumb. \"I\u0027ve told him all about myself these last couple o\u0027 days - did a helluva lot o\u0027 talking fer a man who ain\u0027t said a word fer five or six years! I won\u0027t go through the whole thing again, just give ye the quick lowdown.\"\\n\\n Spits had been a pirate in the Far East in the 1930s. Although piracy was a \"dying art\" (as he put it), there were still ships which sailed the seas and attacked others in the years before World War II, plundering them of their spoils. Spits found himself working on one of the pirate ships after years of ordinary naval service (he said he was shanghaied, though his eyes shifted cagily, and I got the feeling he wasn\u0027t being honest). \"ThePrince o\u0027 Pariahs was \u0027er name.\" He beamed proudly. \"A fine ship, small but speedy. We was the scourge o\u0027 the waters wherever we went.\"\\n\\n It was Spits\u0027s job to fish people out of the sea if they jumped in when they were boarded. \"Two reasons we didn\u0027t like leaving \u0027em there,\" he said. \"One was that we didn\u0027t want \u0027em to drown - we was pirates, not killers. The other was that the ones who jumped was normally carrying jewels or other such valuables - only the rich is that scared of being robbed!\"\\n\\n Spits got that shifty look in his eyes again when he was talking about fishing people out, but I said nothing about it, not wanting to offend the man who\u0027d rescued me from the lake.\\n\\n One night, thePrince of Pariahs found itself at the centre of a fierce storm. Spits said it was the worst he\u0027d ever experienced, \"and I been through just about everything that old sow of a sea can throw at a man!\" As the ship broke apart, Spits grabbed a sturdy plank, some jugs of whisky and the nets he used to fish for people, and jumped overboard.\\n\\n \"Next thing I know, I\u0027m in this lake,\" he finished. \"I dragged myself out and there was a small man in big yellow galoshes waiting fer me.\"Mr Tiny! \"He told me I\u0027d come to a place far from the one I knew, and I was stuck. He said this was a land o\u0027 dragons, awful dangerous fer humans, but there was a shack where I\u0027d be safe. If I stayed there and kept a watch on the lake, two people would come along eventually, and they could make my dreams come true. So I sat back, fished, found spuds growing nearby and brought some back fer me garden, and I been waiting ever since, five \u0027r six years near as I can figure.\"\\n\\n I thought that over, staring from Spits to Harkat and back again. \"What did he mean when he said we\u0027d be able to make your dreams come true?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I suppose he meant ye\u0027d be able t\u0027 get me home.\" Spits\u0027s eyes shifted nervously. \"That\u0027s the only dream this old sailor has, t\u0027 get back where there\u0027s women and whisky, and not a drop o\u0027 water bigger than a puddle in sight - I\u0027ve had enough o\u0027 seas and lakes!\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure I believed that was all the pirate had on his mind, but I let the matter drop and instead asked if he knew anything about the land ahead. \"Not a whole lot,\" he answered. \"I\u0027ve done some exploring, but the dragons keep me pinned here most o\u0027 the time - I don\u0027t like wandering off too far with them demons waiting to pounce.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s more than one?\" I frowned.\\n\\n \"Aaarrr,\" he said. \"I ain\u0027t sure how many, but definitely four \u0027r five. The one that went after ye is the biggest I\u0027ve seen, though mebbe there\u0027s bigger that don\u0027t bother with this lake.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like the sound of that,\" I muttered.\\n\\n \"Me neither,\" Harkat said. Then, turning to Spits, he said, \"Show him the net.\"\\n\\n Spits ducked behind the shack and emerged dragging a stringy old net, which he untangled and spread on the ground. \"Two o\u0027 me nets slipped through with me,\" he said. \"I lost t\u0027 other one a couple o\u0027 years back when a huge fish snatched it out o\u0027 my hands. I been keeping this \u0027un safe, in case of an emergency.\"\\n\\n I remembered what Evanna had told us, that we\u0027d need a net which had been used to fish for the dead if we were to find out who Harkat had been. \"Think this is the net we need?\" I asked Harkat.\\n\\n \"Must be,\" he answered. \"Spits says he didn\u0027t use his nets to - fish for the dead, but this has to be it.\"\\n\\n \"Course I never fished fer the dead!\" Spits boomed, laughing weakly. \"What\u0027d I do that fer? Mind, I been thinking about it since Harkat asked, and I recall a couple o\u0027 people who drowned when I was fishing \u0027em out. So I guess it probablyhas been used to drag up corpses - accidentally, like.\"\\n\\n Spits\u0027s eyes practically shot out of his sockets, they were darting so swiftly from side to side. There was definitely something the ex-pirate wasn\u0027t telling us. But I couldn\u0027t pump him for information without indicating that I didn\u0027t believe him, and this was no time to risk making an enemy.\\n\\n After eating, we discussed what to do next. Spits didn\u0027t know anything about a Temple of the Grotesque. Nor had he seen any people during his long, lonely years here. He\u0027d told Harkat that the dragons usually approached the lake from the southeast. The Little Person was of the opinion that we should go in that direction, though he couldn\u0027t say why - just a gut feeling. Since I\u0027d no personal preference, I bowed to his wishes and we agreed to head southeast that night, moving under cover of darkness.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027ll take me along, won\u0027t ye?\" Spits asked eagerly. \"I\u0027d feel awful if ye went without me.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know what we\u0027re - walking into,\" Harkat warned the grizzly ex-pirate. \"You could be risking your life - by coming with us.\"\\n\\n \"Nowt t\u0027 worry about!\" Spits guffawed. \"\u0027Twon\u0027t be the first time I risked it. I remember when thePrince o\u0027 Pariahs sailed into a trap off the Chinese coast ?\"\\n\\n Once Spits got talking about his adventures on the pirate ship, there was no stopping him. He regaled us with wild, bawdy tales of the plundering they\u0027d done and battles they\u0027d engaged in. As he spoke, he sipped from his jug of poteen, and as the day wore on his voice got louder and his tales got wilder - he told some extra spicy stories about what he\u0027d got up to during shore leave! Eventually, with the sun starting to set, he dozed off and curled up into a ball beside the fire, clutching his almost empty jug of poteen close to his chest.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s some character,\" I whispered, and Harkat chuckled softly.\\n\\n \"I feel sorry for him,\" Harkat said. \"To be stuck here alone for - so long must have been dreadful.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I agreed, but not wholeheartedly. \"But there\u0027s something \u0027off\u0027 about him, isn\u0027t there? He makes me feel uneasy, the way his eyes flick left and right so beadily when he\u0027s lying.\"\\n\\n \"I noticed that too,\" Harkat nodded. \"He tells all sorts of lies - last night he - said he\u0027d been engaged to a Japanese princess - but it\u0027s - only when he talks about his job on the ?Prince of Pariahs that he gets thereally shifty look.\"\\n\\n \"What do you think he\u0027s hiding?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve no idea,\" Harkat replied. \"I doubt it matters - there are - no pirate ships here.\"\\n\\n \"At least none that we\u0027ve seen,\" I grinned.\\n\\n Harkat studied the sleeping Spits - he was drooling into his unkempt beard - then said quietly, \"We can leave him behind - if you\u0027d prefer. He\u0027ll be asleep for hours. If we leave now and walk - fast, he\u0027ll never find us.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think he\u0027s dangerous?\" I asked.\\n\\n Harkat shrugged. \"He might be. But there must be a reason why - Mr Tiny put him here. I think we should take him. And his net.\"\\n\\n \"Definitely the net,\" I agreed. Clearing my throat, I added, \"There\u0027s his blood too. I need human blood - and soon.\"\\n\\n \"I thought of that,\" Harkat said. \"It\u0027s why I didn\u0027t stop him - drinking. Do you want to take some now?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I should wait for him to wake and ask him,\" I suggested.\\n\\n Harkat shook his head. \"Spits is superstitious. He thinks I\u0027m a demon.\"\\n\\n \"A demon!\" I laughed.\\n\\n \"I told him what I really - was, but he wouldn\u0027t listen. In the end I settled for persuading him - that I was a harmless demon - an imp. I sounded him out about vampires. He believes in them, but thinks they\u0027re - evil monsters. Said he\u0027d drive a stake through - the heart of the first one he met. I think you should drink - from him while he\u0027s asleep, and never - tell him what you really are.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t like doing it - I\u0027d no qualms about drinking secretly from strangers, but on the rare occasions when I\u0027d had to drink from people I knew, I\u0027d always asked their permission - but I bowed to Harkat\u0027s greater knowledge of Spits Abrams\u0027s ways.\\n\\n Sneaking up on the sleeping sot, I bared his lower left leg, made a small cut with my right index nail, clamped my mouth around it and sucked. His blood was thin and riddled with alcohol - he must have drunk huge amounts of poteen and whisky over the years! - but I forced it down. When I\u0027d drunk enough, I released him and waited for the blood around the cut to dry. When it had, I cleaned it and rolled the leg of his trousers down.\\n\\n \"Better?\" Harkat asked.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" I burped. \"I wouldn\u0027t like to drink from him often - there\u0027s more poteen than blood in his veins! - but it\u0027ll restore my strength and keep me going for the next few weeks.\"\\n\\n \"Spits won\u0027t wake until morning,\" Harkat noted. \"We\u0027ll have to wait - until tomorrow night to start, unless you - want to risk travelling by day.\"\\n\\n \"With dragons roaming overhead? No thanks! Anyway, an extra day of rest won\u0027t hurt - I\u0027m still recovering from our last run-in.\"\\n\\n \"By the way, how did you - get it to drop you?\" Harkat asked as we settled down for the night. \"And why did it - fly away and leave us?\"\\n\\n I thought back, recalled yelling at the dragon to let me go, and told Harkat what had happened. He stared at me disbelievingly, so Iwinked and said, \"I always did have a way with dumb animals!\" And I left it at that, even though I was equally bewildered by the dragon\u0027s strange retreat. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lake-of-souls-the-saga-of-darren-shan-10/page-15.html","bookId":2446,"book":{"id":2446,"title":"The Lake of Souls (The Saga of Darren Shan #10)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #10: The Lake of Souls \\n The Lake of Souls is the 10th book in The Saga of Darren Shan and is also the first in the 4th and final trilogy in \u0027The Saga\u0027 called The Vampire Destiny Trilogy.
