We left Mr Crepsley\u0027s charred bones in the pit where he\u0027d fallen. I\u0027d meant to bury him, but I hadn\u0027t the heart for it. Steve\u0027s revelation - that he was the Lord of the Vampaneze - had floored me, and now nothing seemed to matter. My closest friend had been killed. My world had been torn asunder. I didn\u0027t care whether I lived or died. Harkat and Debbie walked beside me, Vancha and Alice Burgess slightly in front. Debbie used to be my girlfriend, but now she was a grown woman, whereas I was stuck in the body of a teenager - the curse of being a half-vampire who only aged one year for every five that passed. Alice was a police chief inspector. Vancha had kidnapped her when we\u0027d been surrounded by police. She and Debbie had taken part in the fight with the vampaneze. They\u0027d both fought well. A shame it had been for nothing.\\n\\n We\u0027d told Alice and Debbie all about the War of the Scars. Vampires exist, but not the murderous monsters of myth. We don\u0027t kill when we feed. But other night creatures do - the vampaneze. They broke away from the vampires six hundred years ago. They always drain their victims dry. Their skin has turned purple over the centuries, and their eyes and fingernails are red.\\n\\n For a long time there\u0027d been peace between the two clans. That ended when the Lord of the Vampaneze emerged. This vampaneze leader was destined to lead them into war against the vampires and destroy us. But if we found and killed him before he became a full-vampaneze, the war would go our way instead.\\n\\n Only three vampires could hunt for the Vampaneze Lord (according to a powerful meddler called Desmond Tiny, who could see into the future). Two were Vampire Princes, Vancha March and me. The other had been Mr Crepsley, the vampire who\u0027d blooded me and been like a father to me. He\u0027d faced the person we thought was the Vampaneze Lord earlier that night and killed him. But then Steve sent Mr Crepsley tumbling to his death in a pit of flame-tipped stakes - shortly before he let me know that the person Mr Crepsley killed was an impostor, and that Steve himself was the Vampaneze Lord.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t seem possible that Mr Crepsley was dead. I kept expecting a tap on my shoulder, and the tall orange-haired vampire to be standing behind me when I turned, grinning wickedly, his long facial scar glinting as he held up a torch, asking where we thought we were going without him. But the tap never came. It couldn\u0027t. Mr Crepsley was dead. He\u0027d never come back.\\n\\n Part of me wanted to go mad with rage, seize a sword and storm off after Steve. I wanted to track him down and drive a stake through his rotten excuse for a heart. But Mr Crepsley had warned me not to devote myself to revenge. He said it would warp and destroy me if I gave in to it. I knew in my soul that there was unfinished business between Steve and me, that our paths would cross again. But for the time being I pushed him from my thoughts and mourned for Mr Crepsley.\\n\\n Except I couldn\u0027t really mourn. Tears wouldn\u0027t come. As much as I wanted to howl and sob with grief, my eyes remained dry and steely. Inside, I was a broken, weeping wreck, but on the outside I was cold, calm and collected, as though I hadn\u0027t been affected by the vampire\u0027s death.\\n\\n Ahead, Vancha and Alice came to a halt. The Prince looked back, his wide eyes red from crying. He looked pitiful in his animal skins, with his filthy bare feet and wild hair, like an overgrown, lost child. \"We\u0027re almost at the surface,\" he croaked. \"It\u0027s still day. Will we wait here for dark? If we\u0027re spotted ?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t care,\" I mumbled.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to stay here,\" Debbie sobbed. \"These tunnels are cruel.\"\\n\\n \"And I have to inform my people that I\u0027m alive,\" Alice said, then frowned and picked dried blood flecks from her pale white hair. \"Though I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to explain it to them!\"\\n\\n \"Tell the truth,\" Vancha grunted.\\n\\n The Chief Inspector grimaced. \"Hardly! I\u0027ll have to think up some?\" She stopped. A figure had appeared out of the darkness ahead of us, blocking the path.\\n\\n Cursing, Vancha ripped loose a shuriken - throwing stars he kept strapped in belts around his chest - and prepared to launch it.\\n\\n \"Peace, Vancha,\" the stranger said, raising a hand. \"I am here to help, not harm.\"\\n\\n Vancha lowered his shuriken and muttered in disbelief, \"Evanna?\"\\n\\n The woman ahead of us clicked her fingers and a torch flared into life overhead, revealing the ugly witch we\u0027d travelled with earlier in the year, while we were searching for the Lord of the Vampaneze. She hadn\u0027t changed. Short thick muscles, long untidy hair, pointed ears, a tiny nose, one brown eye and one green (the colours kept shifting from left to right), hairy body, long sharp nails and yellow ropes tied tight around her body instead of clothes.\\n\\n \"What are you doing - here?\" Harkat asked, his large green eyes filled with suspicion - Evanna was a neutral in the War of the Scars, but could help or hinder those on either side, depending on her mood.\\n\\n \"I came to bid Larten\u0027s spirit farewell,\" the witch said. She was smiling.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t look too cut up about it,\" I remarked without emotion.\\n\\n She shrugged. \"I foresaw his death many decades ago. I did my crying for him then.\"\\n\\n \"You knew he\u0027d die?\" Vancha growled.\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t certain, but I guessed he would perish,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Then you could have stopped it!\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Evanna said. \"Those with the ability to sense the currents of the future are forbidden to interfere. To save Larten, I\u0027d have had to abandon the rules I live by, and if that happened, all chaos would break loose.\"\\n\\n The witch stretched out a hand, and even though she was many metres away from Vancha, her fingers cupped his chin tenderly. \"I was fond of Larten,\" she said softly. \"I hoped I was wrong. But I couldn\u0027t take it upon myself to spare him. His fate wasn\u0027t mine to decide.\"\\n\\n \"Then whose was it?\" Vancha snapped.\\n\\n \"His own,\" Evanna replied steadily. \"Hechose to hunt for the Lord of the Vampaneze, to enter the tunnels, to fight on the platform. He could have walked away from his responsibilities - but he chose not to.\"\\n\\n Vancha glared at the witch a moment longer, then lowered his gaze. I saw fresh tears splash in the dust at his feet. \"My apologies, Lady,\" he muttered. \"I don\u0027t blame you. I\u0027m just so fired up with hatred.\\n\\n \"I know,\" the witch said, then studied the rest of us. \"You must come with me. I have things to tell you, and I\u0027d rather talk on the outside - the air here is rank with treachery and death. Will you spare me a few hours of your time?\" She glanced at Alice Burgess. \"I promise I won\u0027t keep you long.\"\\n\\n Alice sniffed. \"I guess a few hours can\u0027t make much of a difference.\"\\n\\n Evanna looked at Harkat, Debbie, Vancha and me. We shared a glance, then nodded and followed the witch up the last stretch of the tunnels, leaving the darkness and the dead behind.\\n\\n Evanna gave Vancha a thick deer hide to drape over his head and shoulders, to block out the rays of the sun. Trailing after the witch, we moved quickly through the streets. Evanna must have cast a spell to hide us, because people didn\u0027t notice us, despite our blood-stained faces and clothes. We ended up outside the city, in a small forest, where Evanna had prepared a camp amidst the trees. At her offer, we sat and tucked into the berries, roots and water she\u0027d set out for us.\\n\\n We ate silently. I found myself studying the witch, wondering why she was here - if she\u0027d really come to say goodbye to Mr Crepsley, she\u0027d have gone down to where his body lay in the pit. Evanna was Mr Tiny\u0027s daughter. He had created her by mixing the blood of a vampire with that of a wolf. Vampires and vampaneze were barren - we couldn\u0027t have children - but Evanna was supposed to be able to bear a child by a male of either clan. When we met her shortly after setting out to hunt the Vampaneze Lord, she\u0027d confirmed Mr Tiny\u0027s prophecy - that we\u0027d have four chances to kill the Lord - and added the warning that if we failed, two of us would die.\\n\\n Vancha finished eating first, sat back and burped. \"Speak,\" he snapped - he wasn\u0027t in the mood for formalities.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wondering how many chances you\u0027ve used up,\" Evanna said directly. \"The answer is - three. The first was when you fought the vampaneze in the glade and let their Lord escape. The second, when you discovered Steve Leonard was a half-vampaneze and took him hostage - although you had several opportunities to kill him, they count as one. The third chance was when Larten faced him on the platform above the pit of stakes.\"\\n\\n \"That means we still have a shot at him!\" Vancha hissed excitedly.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Evanna said. \"Once more the hunters will face the Vampaneze Lord, and on that occasion the future will be decided. But that confrontation will not come in the near future. Steve Leonard has withdrawn to plot anew. For now, you may relax.\"\\n\\n The witch turned to me and her expression softened. \"It might not lighten your load,\" she said kindly, \"but Larten\u0027s soul has flown to Paradise. He died nobly and earned the reward of the righteous. He is at rest.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather he was here,\" I said miserably, gazing at the leaves of an overhanging tree, waiting for tears which still wouldn\u0027t come.\\n\\n \"What about the rest of the vampaneze?\" Alice asked. \"Are any of them still in my city?\"\\n\\n Evanna shook her head. \"All have fled.\"\\n\\n \"Will they return?\" Alice asked, and by the glint in her eyes I saw she was half hoping they would, so she could settle a few scores.\\n\\n \"No.\" Evanna smiled. \"But I think it\u0027s safe to say that you will run into them again.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d better,\" Alice growled, and I knew she was thinking of Morgan James, an officer of hers who\u0027d joined the vampets. They were human allies of the vampaneze, who shaved their heads, daubed blood around their eyes, sported V tattoos above their ears, and dressed in brown uniforms.\\n\\n \"Is the nightmare over then?\" Debbie asked, wiping her dark cheeks clean. The teacher had fought like a tigress in the tunnels, but the events of the night had caught up with her and she was shivering helplessly.\\n\\n \"For you - for now,\" Evanna answered cryptically.\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\" Debbie frowned.\\n\\n \"You and the Chief Inspector can choose to distance yourselves from the War of the Scars,\" Evanna said. \"You can return to your ordinary lives and pretend this never happened. If you do, the vampaneze won\u0027t come after you again.\"\\n\\n \"Of course we\u0027ll return to our lives,\" Alice said. \"What else can we do? We\u0027re not vampires. We don\u0027t have any further part to play in their war.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" Evanna said. \"Or perhaps you\u0027ll think differently when you\u0027ve had time to reconsider. You\u0027ll return to the city - you need time to reflect, and you have affairs to put in order - but whether or not you\u0027ll choose to stay ?\" Evanna\u0027s eyes flicked over Vancha, Harkat and me. \"And where do you three wish to go?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m continuing after that monster, Leonard,\" Vancha said immediately.\\n\\n \"You may if you wish,\" Evanna shrugged, \"but you\u0027ll be wasting your time and energy. Moreover, you will jeopardize your position. Although you are fated to confront him again, it\u0027s not written in stone - by pursuing him now, you might miss the final destined showdown.\"\\n\\n Vancha cursed bitterly, then asked Evanna where she suggested he should go.\\n\\n \"Vampire Mountain,\" she said. \"Your clan should be told about the Vampaneze Lord. They must not kill him themselves - that rule still applies - but they can scout for him and point you in the right direction.\"\\n\\n Vancha nodded slowly. \"I\u0027ll call a temporary end to the fighting and set everyone searching for him. I\u0027ll flit for Vampire Mountain as soon as night falls. Darren - are you and Harkat coming?\"\\n\\n I looked at my fellow Prince, then down at the hard brown earth of the forest floor. \"No,\" I said softly. \"I\u0027ve had all I can take of vampires and vampaneze. I know I\u0027m a Prince and have duties to attend to. But I feel like my head\u0027s about to explode. Mr Crepsley meant more to me than anything else. I need to get away from it all, maybe for a while - maybe for ever.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a dangerous time to cut yourself off from those who care for you,\" Vancha said quietly.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t help that,\" I sighed.\\n\\n Vancha was troubled by my choice, but he accepted it. \"I don\u0027t approve - a Prince should put the needs of his people before his own - but I understand. I\u0027ll explain it to the others. Nobody will trouble you.\" He cocked an eyebrow at Harkat. \"I suppose you\u0027ll be going with him?\"\\n\\n Harkat lowered the mask from his mouth (air was poisonous to the grey-skinned Little People) and smiled thinly. \"Of course.\" Mr Tiny had resurrected Harkat from the dead. Harkat didn\u0027t know who he used to be, but he believed he could find out by sticking with me.\\n\\n \"Where will you go?\" Vancha asked. \"I can find you using the Stone of Blood, but it\u0027ll be easier if I have a rough idea of where you\u0027re heading.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll just pick a direction and ?\" I stopped as a picture flashed through my thoughts, of circus vans, snake-boys and hammocks. \"The Cirque Du Freak,\" I decided. \"It\u0027s the nearest place outside Vampire Mountain that I can call home.\"\\n\\n \"A good choice,\" Evanna said, and by the way her lips lifted at the edges, I realized the witch had known all along that I\u0027d choose to return to the Cirque.\\n\\n We went our separate ways as the sun was setting, even though we hadn\u0027t slept and were ready to drop with exhaustion. Vancha departed first, on his long trek to Vampire Mountain. He said little when leaving, but hugged me hard and hissed in my ear, \"Be brave!\"\\n\\n \"You too,\" I whispered back.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll kill Leonard next time,\" he vowed.\\n\\n \"Aye,\" I grinned weakly.\\n\\n He turned and ran, hitting flitting speed seconds later, vanishing into the gloom of the dusk.\\n\\n Debbie and Alice left next, to return to the city. Debbie asked me to stay with her, but I couldn\u0027t, not as things stood. I needed to be by myself for a while. She wept and clutched me close. \"Will you come back later?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try,\" I croaked.\\n\\n \"If he doesn\u0027t,\" Evanna said, \"you can always go looking for him.\" She handed a folded-up piece of paper to Alice Burgess. \"Hold on to that. Keep it closed. When the two of you decide upon your course, open it.\"\\n\\n The Chief Inspector asked no questions, just tucked the paper away and waited for Debbie to join her. Debbie looked at me pleadingly. She wanted me to go with her - or ask her to come with me - but there was a huge ball of grief sitting cold and hard in my gut. I couldn\u0027t think of anything else right now.\\n\\n \"Take care,\" I said, turning aside and breaking eye contact.\\n\\n \"You too,\" she croaked, then sobbed loudly and stumbled away. With a quick \"Goodbye\", Alice hurried after her, and the two women slipped through the trees, back to the city, supporting one another as they went.\\n\\n That left just me, Harkat and Evanna.\\n\\n \"Any idea where the Cirque\u0027s playing?\" the witch asked. We shook our heads. \"Then it\u0027s lucky that I do and am going there,\" she smiled. Standing between us, she looped her arms around my left arm and Harkat\u0027s right, and led us through the forest, away from the city and its underground caverns of death, back to where my voyage into the night first started - the Cirque Du Freak. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lake-of-souls-the-saga-of-darren-shan-10/page-2.html","bookId":2446,"book":{"id":2446,"title":"The Lake of Souls (The Saga of Darren Shan #10)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #10: The Lake of Souls \\n The Lake of Souls is the 10th book in The Saga of Darren Shan and is also the first in the 4th and final trilogy in \u0027The Saga\u0027 called The Vampire Destiny Trilogy.
