Some made it to safety, but most were trapped beneath the pillars and roof, which caved in around them as they ran. Stumbling to my feet, I set off after the Kulashkas, but Harkat grabbed me. \"We\u0027ll never make it!\" he gasped.\n \"There\u0027s no other way out!\" I screamed in reply.\n \"Have to - shelter!\" he yelled, dragging me away from the main path. He hobbled across the floorboards, his green eyes darting from left to right as he watched for falling debris.\n \"We\u0027re in fer it now!\" Spits hollered, popping up beside us, eyes alight with crazy drunken glee. \"Face the heavenly stairs and cough up yer prayers!\"\n Harkat ignored the ex-pirate, dodged a chunk of heavy masonry, paused, then started jumping up and down on the spot. I thought he\u0027d lost his mind, until I saw the hole in the floor where his foot had gone through earlier. Twigging to his plan, I bounced up and down beside him on the fragile floorboards. I didn\u0027t know how deep the pit was beneath, or if we\u0027d be safe in it, but we couldn\u0027t fare any worse below than up here.\n \"What in the devil\u0027s name are ye?\" Spits began. He got no further, because at that point the floor gave way and the three of us plummeted into darkness, yelling wildly as we fell.\n We landed in a heap several metres beneath the temple, on a hard stone floor, Spits on top of Harkat and me. Groaning, I shoved Spits off - he\u0027d been knocked out during the landing - and looked up. I saw part of the roof give way far overhead and come crashing down. Yelping, I stumbled to my feet and dragged Spits off to one side, cursing at Harkat to follow. There was a fierce, thunderous roar at our heels as we only just cleared the section of falling roof, which exploded upon contact with the floor and showered us with splinters and chips of stone.\n Coughing - the force of the impact had raised a thick cloud of dust - we pushed ahead blindly, dragging Spits between us, into darkness and what we hoped was safety from the crumbling Temple of the Grotesque. After several frantic metres we came to a hole in the ground. Exploring with my hands, I said, \"I think it\u0027s a tunnel - but it drops sharply!\"\n \"If it gets covered over - we\u0027ll be trapped,\" Harkat said.\n There was a heavy bang overhead and the floorboards above us creaked ominously. \"We don\u0027t have a choice!\" I yelled, and crawled into the tunnel, bracing myself against the walls with my hands and feet. Harkat shoved Spits after me, then came himself - the tunnel was only just wide enough to accommodate his bulky body.\n We clung near the top of the tunnel a few seconds, listening to the sounds of the destruction. I peered down the tunnel, but there was no light, and no way of telling how long it was. Spits\u0027s body weighed a ton and my feet began to slip. I tried digging in with my nails but the stone was too smooth and tough. \"We have to slide!\" I bellowed.\n \"What if we can\u0027t get - back up?\" Harkat asked.\n \"One crisis at a time!\" I shouted, and let go. I lay flat on my back, allowing my body to shoot down the tunnel. It was a short, fast ride. The tunnel dropped sharply for many metres, then gradually levelled out. I came to a stop several seconds later at the end of the tunnel, where I stretched out a foot, searching for the floor. I hadn\u0027t found it when the unconscious Spits barrelled into the back of me and sent me sprawling out into open space.\n I opened my mouth to yell, but hit the ground before I could - the mouth of the tunnel was only a metre or two off the floor. Relieved, I got to my knees - and was promptly knocked flat when Spits toppled out on top of me. Swearing blindly, I pushed him off and was rising again when Harkat shot out of the tunnel and bowled me over.\n \"Sorry,\" the Little Person muttered, easing himself off. \"Are you OK?\"\n \"I feel like I\u0027ve been run over by a steamroller,\" I groaned, then sat up and took deep breaths of the musty air, letting my head clear.\n \"We\u0027ve escaped being crushed by - the temple,\" Harkat noted after a while, as the noises echoing through the tunnel decreased and then ceased.\n \"For whatever good it\u0027ll be,\" I grunted. I couldn\u0027t see my friend in the gloom of the underground cavern. \"If there\u0027s no way out, we\u0027ll face a slow, miserable death. We might wind up wishing we\u0027d been squashed by a falling pillar.\"\n Beside me, Spits groaned feebly, then muttered something unintelligible. There was the sound of him sitting up, then, \"What\u0027s happening? Where have the lights gone?\"\n \"The lights, Spits?\" I asked innocently.\n \"I can\u0027t see!\" he gasped. \"It\u0027s pitch black.\u0027\"\n \"Really?\" I said, eager to punish him for fouling things up with the Kulashkas. \"Ican see fine. How about you, Harkat?\"\n \"Perfectly,\" Harkat murmured. \"I wish I had - sunglasses, it\u0027s so bright.\"\n \"My eyes!\" Spits howled. \"I\u0027m blind!\"\n We let Spits suffer a while, before telling him the truth. He berated us with some choice insults for scaring him, but soon calmed down and asked what our next move would be.\n \"I guess we walk,\" I answered, \"and see where we end up. We can\u0027t go back, and there are walls to the left and right?\" I could tell by the echoes of our voices \"?so it\u0027s straight ahead until a choice presents itself.\"\n \"I blame ye fer this,\" Spits muttered. \"If ye hadn\u0027t gone prancing about in that bloody temple, we\u0027d be waltzing through the fields now, with all the fresh air in the world t\u0027 breathe.\"\n \"Weweren\u0027t the ones who - tossed bombs when there wasn\u0027t a need!\" Harkat snapped. \"We\u0027d agreed a deal with - the Kulashkas. They were letting us go.\"\n \"That lot?\" Spits snorted. \"They\u0027d\u0027ve strung ye up and had ye fer breakfast!\"\n \"I\u0027ll stringyou up if you don\u0027t - shut your mouth,\" Harkat growled.\n \"What\u0027s eating him?\" Spits asked me, stung by Harkat\u0027s tone.\n \"Many Kulashkas died because of you,\" I sighed. \"If you\u0027d stayed outside like you were supposed to, they needn\u0027t have.\"\n \"Who cares about that lot?\" Spits laughed. \"They ain\u0027t of our world. What\u0027s the difference if some of \u0027em got squished?\"\n \"They were people!\" Harkat roared. \"It doesn\u0027t matter what - world they were from. We had no right - to come in here and kill them! We?\"\n \"Easy,\" I hushed him. \"We can\u0027t put it right now. Spits was only trying to help, in his clumsy, drunken way. Let\u0027s concentrate on finding a way out, and leave the finger-pointing for another time.\"\n \"Just keep him away - from me,\" Harkat grumbled, pushing to the front and taking the lead.\n \"That\u0027s not very polite,\" Spits complained. \"I thought, as an imp, he\u0027d be delighted to cause havoc.\"\n \"Be quiet,\" I snapped, \"or I\u0027ll change my mind and set him on you!\"\n \"Crazy pair o\u0027 landlubbers,\" Spits snorted, but kept further comments to himself and fell in behind me as I stumbled after Harkat.\n We limped along in silence for a number of minutes, disturbed only by the sound of Spits slurping from his jug of poteen (no fearthat got broken in the explosion!). It was completely dark in the tunnel. I couldn\u0027t see Harkat, even though he was only a metre or so ahead of me, so I concentrated on my sense of hearing, following him by sound alone. His large grey feet made a very distinctive noise, and because I was focusing on that, I didn\u0027t hear the other sounds until they were almost upon us.\n \"Stop!\" I hissed suddenly.\n Harkat came to an instant standstill. Behind me, Spits stumbled into my back. \"What\u0027re ye?\" he began.\n I clamped a hand over his mouth, finding it with little difficulty from the stink of his breath. \"Not a word,\" I whispered, and through the throb of his lips I felt his heartbeat pick up speed.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Harkat asked quietly.\n \"We\u0027re not alone,\" I said, straining my ears. There were very slight rustling sounds all around us, ahead, at the sides, behind. The sounds stopped for a few seconds when we stopped, but then picked up again, slightly slower and quieter than before.\n \"Something just crawled over my right foot,\" Harkat said.\n I felt Spits stiffen. \"I\u0027ve had enough o\u0027 this,\" he muttered fearfully, and made to pull away and run.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t do that,\" I said softly. \"I think I know what this is. If I\u0027m right, running would be avery bad idea.\"\n Spits trembled but held his nerve and stood his ground. Releasing him, I bent to the ground slowly, as gracefully as I could, and gently laid a hand on the floor of the tunnel. A few seconds later, something crawled over my fingers, something with hairy legs - two - four - six - eight.\n \"Spiders,\" I whispered. \"We\u0027re surrounded by spiders.\"\n \"Is that all?\" Spits laughed. \"I\u0027m not scared o\u0027 a few wee spiders! Stand aside, boys, and I\u0027ll stamp \u0027em out fer ye.\"\n I sensed Spits raising a foot into the air. \"What if they\u0027re poisonous?\" I said. He froze.\n \"I\u0027ve a better one,\" Harkat said. \"Maybe these are babies. This is a world of - giants - the Grotesque and that monstrous toad. Whatif there are giant - spiders too?\"\n At that, I froze like Spits had, and the three of us stood there, sweating in the darkness, listening - waiting - helpless. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lake-of-souls-the-saga-of-darren-shan-10/page-20.html","bookId":2446,"book":{"id":2446,"title":"The Lake of Souls (The Saga of Darren Shan #10)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #10: The Lake of Souls \n The Lake of Souls is the 10th book in The Saga of Darren Shan and is also the first in the 4th and final trilogy in \u0027The Saga\u0027 called The Vampire Destiny Trilogy.
