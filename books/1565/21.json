{"id":109657,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along.\\n\\n \"Fits, doesn\u0027t it?\" he said. \"Remember what Malfoy said on the train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other. They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup....I\u0027ll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he\u0027s going to be feeling really stupid now, isn\u0027t he? Didn\u0027t work, did it? You only got a scratch! Come here - I\u0027ll do it -\"\\n\\n Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around and around Harry\u0027s head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg.\\n\\n There\u0027s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?\" Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. \"You know what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I\u0027m serious.\"\\n\\n Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron.\\n\\n \"Harry\u0027s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,\" she said seriously. \"If that was the first task, I hate to think what\u0027s coming next.\"\\n\\n \"Right little ray of sunshine, aren\u0027t you?\" said Ron. \"You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.\"\\n\\n He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual - Harry hadn\u0027t been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-by-blow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, \"Well, we\u0027d better get downstairs for your surprise party, Harry - Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now.\"\\n\\n Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster\u0027s Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail\u0027s head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire.\\n\\n Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn\u0027t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he\u0027d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn\u0027t have to face the second one for three months.\\n\\n \"Blimey, this is heavy,\" said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. \"Open it, Harry, go on! Let\u0027s just see what\u0027s inside it!\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s supposed to work out the clue on his own,\" Hermione said swiftly. \"It\u0027s in the tournament rules....\"\\n\\n \"I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,\" Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.\\n\\n \"Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!\" several people echoed.\\n\\n Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open.\\n\\n It was hollow and completely empty - but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick\u0027s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.\\n\\n \"Shut it!\" Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.\\n\\n \"What was that?\" said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again. \"Sounded like a banshee...Maybe you\u0027ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!\"\\n\\n \"It was someone being tortured!\" said Neville, who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. \"You\u0027re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be a prat, Neville, that\u0027s illegal,\" said George. \"They wouldn\u0027t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing...maybe you\u0027ve got to attack him while he\u0027s in the shower. Harry.\"\\n\\n \"Want a jam tart, Hermione?\" said Fred.\\n\\n Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred grinned.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" he said. \"I haven\u0027t done anything to them. It\u0027s the custard creams you\u0027ve got to watch -\"\\n\\n Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out. Fred laughed.\\n\\n \"Just my little joke, Neville....\"\\n\\n Hermione took a jam tart. Then she said, \"Did you get all this from the kitchens, Fred?\"\\n\\n \"Yep,\" said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak and imitated a house-elf. \"\u0027anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!\u0027 They\u0027re dead helpful...get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.\"\\n\\n \"How do you get in there?\" Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice.\\n\\n \"Easy,\" said Fred, \"concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and -\" He stopped and looked suspiciously at her. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" said Hermione quickly.\\n\\n \"Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you?\" said George. \"Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?\"\\n\\n Several people chortled. Hermione didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you go upsetting them and telling them they\u0027ve got to take clothes and salaries!\" said Fred warningly. \"You\u0027ll put them off their cooking!\"\\n\\n Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary.\\n\\n \"Oh - sorry, Neville!\" Fred shouted over all the laughter. \"I forgot - it was the custard creams we hexed -\"\\n\\n Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in laughing.\\n\\n \"Canary Creams!\" Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. \"George and I invented them - seven Sickles each, a bargain!\"\\n\\n It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his four-poster shut. Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point...they were all right, really, dragons....\\n\\n The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty though the castle always was in winter. Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime\u0027s horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure whether they hibernate or not,\" Hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. \"Thought we\u0027d jus\u0027 try an see if they fancied a kip...we\u0027ll jus\u0027 settle \u0027em down in these boxes....\"\\n\\n There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll jus\u0027 lead \u0027em in here,\" Hagrid said, \"an\u0027 put the lids on, and we\u0027ll see what happens.\"\\n\\n But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, \"Don panic, now, don\u0027 panic!\" while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class - Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead - had fled into Hagrid\u0027s cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027 frighten him, now!\" Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. \"Jus\u0027 try an slip the rope \u0027round his sting, so he won hurt any o\u0027 the others!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, we wouldn\u0027t want that!\" Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid\u0027s cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.\\n\\n \"Well, well, well...this does look like fun.\"\\n\\n Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid\u0027s garden fence, looking in at the mayhem. She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.\\n\\n Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027re you?\" Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt\u0027s sting and tightened it.\\n\\n \"Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,\" Rita replied, beaming at him. Her gold teeth glinted.\\n\\n \"Thought Dumbledore said you weren\u0027 allowed inside the school anymore,\" said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.\\n\\n Rita acted as though she hadn\u0027t heard what Hagrid had said.\\n\\n \"What are these fascinating creatures called?\" she asked, beaming still more widely.\\n\\n \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" grunted Hagrid.\\n\\n \"Really?\" said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. \"I\u0027ve never heard of them before...where do they come from?\"\\n\\n Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid\u0027s wild black beard, and his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly, \"They\u0027re very interesting, aren\u0027t they? Aren\u0027t they. Harry?\"\\n\\n \"What? Oh yeah...ouch...interesting,\" said Harry as she stepped on his foot.\\n\\n \"Ah, you\u0027re here. Harry!\" said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. \"So you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.\\n\\n \"Lovely,\" said Rita. \"Really lovely. Been teaching long?\" she added to Hagrid.\\n\\n Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek). Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.\\n\\n \"This is o\u0027ny me second year,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\n \"Lovely...I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d like to give an interview, would you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures? The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday, as I\u0027m sure you know. We could feature these - er - Bang-Ended Scoots.\"\\n\\n \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" Hagrid said eagerly. \"Er - yeah, why not?\"\\n\\n Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.\\n\\n \"Well, good-bye, Harry!\" Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione. \"Until Friday night, then, Hagrid!\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll twist everything he says,\" Harry said under his breath.\\n\\n \"Just as long as he didn\u0027t import those skrewts illegally or anything,\" said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another - it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.\\n\\n \"Hagrid\u0027s been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledores never sacked him,\" said Ron consolingly. \"Worst that can happen is Hagrid\u0027ll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry...did I say worst? I meant best.\"\\n\\n Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch.\\n\\n Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.\\n\\n \"I would think,\" she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, \"that some of us\" - she stared very meaningfully at Harry- \"might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths...and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?\"\\n\\n \"An ugly old bat in outsize specs?\" Ron muttered under his breath.\\n\\n Harry fought hard to keep his face straight.\\n\\n \"Death, my dears.\"\\n\\n Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, \"it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower...ever lower over the castle....\"\\n\\n She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously.\\n\\n \"It\u0027d be a bit more impressive if she hadn\u0027t done it about eighty times before,\" Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath Professor Trelawney\u0027s room. \"But if I\u0027d dropped dead every time she\u0027s told me I\u0027m going to, I\u0027d be a medical miracle.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,\" said Ron, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly. \"At least we didn\u0027t get homework. I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not working when she is....\"\\n\\n But Hermione wasn\u0027t at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward. The only person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph - but then Ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.\\n\\n \"Wonder where she\u0027s got to?\" Ron said as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower.\\n\\n \"Dunno...balderdash.\"\\n\\n But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione\u0027s arrival.\\n\\n \"Harry!\" she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised). \"Harry, you\u0027ve got to come - you\u0027ve got to come, the most amazing thing\u0027s happened - please -\"\\n\\n She seized Harry\u0027s arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" Harry said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll show you when we get there - oh come on, quick -\"\\n\\n Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.\\n\\n \"Oh don\u0027t mind me!\" the Fat Lady called irritably after them. \"Don\u0027t apologize for bothering me! I\u0027ll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, thanks!\" Ron shouted over his shoulder.\\n\\n \"Hermione, where are we going?\" Harry asked, after she had led them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll see, you\u0027ll see in a minute!\" said Hermione excitedly.\\n\\n She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry\u0027s names. Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape\u0027s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.\\n\\n \"Oh hang on...\" said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. \"Wait a minute, Hermione....\"\\n\\n \"What?\" She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face.\\n\\n \"I know what this is about,\" said Harry.\\n\\n He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl.\\n\\n \"Hermione!\" said Ron, cottoning on. \"You\u0027re trying to rope us into that spew stuff again!\"\\n\\n \"No, no, I\u0027m not!\" she said hastily. \"And it\u0027s not spew, Ron -\"\\n\\n \"Changed the name, have you?\" said Ron, frowning at her. \"What are we now, then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I\u0027m not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work, I\u0027m not doing it -\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not asking you to!\" Hermione said impatiently. \"I came down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found - oh come on, Harry, I want to show you!\"\\n\\n She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear. It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside.\\n\\n He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing, \"Harry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!\"\\n\\n Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.\\n\\n \"D-Dobby?\" Harry gasped.\\n\\n \"It is Dobby, sir, it is!\" squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel. \"Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!\"\\n\\n Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet - all except the clothes, which were very different.\\n\\n When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of what looked like children\u0027s soccer shorts, and odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The other was covered in pink and orange stripes.\\n\\n \"Dobby, what\u0027re you doing here?\" Harry said in amazement.\\n\\n \"Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!\" Dobby squealed excitedly. \"Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!\\n\\n \"Winky?\" said Harry. \"She\u0027s here too?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir, yes!\" said Dobby, and he seized Harry\u0027s hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.\\n\\n At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky\u0027s had been, like a toga.\\n\\n Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed.\\n\\n \"Winky, sir!\" he said.\\n\\n Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears. However, while every one of Dobby\u0027s strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all. There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.\\n\\n \"Hello, Winky,\" said Harry.\\n\\n Winky\u0027s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the Quidditch World Cup.\\n\\n \"Oh dear,\" said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. \"Winky, don\u0027t cry, please don\u0027t...\"\\n\\n But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at Harry.\\n\\n \"Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?\" he squeaked loudly, over Winky\u0027s sobs.\\n\\n \"Er - yeah, okay,\" said Harry.\\n\\n Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.\\n\\n \"Good service!\" Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated.\\n\\n \"How long have you been here, Dobby?\" Harry asked as Dobby handed around the tea.\\n\\n \"Only a week. Harry Potter, sir!\" said Dobby happily. \"Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed -\"\\n\\n At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a nose dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow.\\n\\n \"Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!\" Dobby squeaked. \"But Dobby hasn\u0027t found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying now!\"\\n\\n The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, \"Good for you, Dobby!\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, miss!\" said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. \"But most wizards doesn\u0027t want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. \u0027That\u0027s not the point of a house-elf,\u0027 they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby\u0027s face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid. Harry Potter....Dobby likes being free!\"\\n\\n The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume other crying.\\n\\n \"And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky has been freed too, sir!\" said Dobby delightedly.\\n\\n At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay face-down on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference. Dobby continued with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky\u0027s screeches.\\n\\n \"And then Dobby had the idea. Harry Potter, sir! \u0027Why doesn\u0027t Dobby and Winky find work together?\u0027 Dobby says. \u0027Where is there enough work for two house-elves?\u0027 says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir! Hogwarts! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor Dumbledore took us on!\"\\n\\n Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again.\\n\\n \"And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not very much!\" Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky\u0027s continued screaming and fist-beating.\\n\\n \"Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,\" said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, \"but Dobby beat him down, miss....Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn\u0027t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.\"\\n\\n \"And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?\" Hermione asked kindly.\\n\\n If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.\\n\\n \"Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!\" she squeaked. \"Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!\"\\n\\n \"Ashamed?\" said Hermione blankly. \"But - Winky, come on! It\u0027s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn\u0027t do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you -\"\\n\\n But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn\u0027t hear a word, and screeched, \"You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!\"\\n\\n \"Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,\" squeaked Dobby confidentially. \"Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won\u0027t do it.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?\" Harry asked.\\n\\n \"Oh no, sir, no,\" said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. \"\u0027Tis part of the house-elf\u0027s enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We upholds the family\u0027s honor, and we never speaks ill of them - though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to - to -\"\\n\\n Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent forward. Dobby whispered, \"He said we is free to call him a - a barmy old codger if we likes, sir!\"\\n\\n Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.\\n\\n \"But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,\" he said, talking normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. \"Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him.\"\\n\\n \"But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?\" Harry asked him, grinning.\\n\\n A slightly fearful look came into Dobby\u0027s immense eyes.\\n\\n \"Dobby - Dobby could,\" he said doubtfully. He squared his small shoulders. \"Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were - were - bad Dark wizards!\"\\n\\n Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his own daring - then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, \"Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\"\\n\\n Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table.\\n\\n \"Thank you. Harry Potter, thank you,\" said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head.\\n\\n \"You just need a bit of practice,\" Harry said.\\n\\n \"Practice!\" squealed Winky furiously. \"You is ought to be ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!\"\\n\\n \"They isn\u0027t my masters anymore, Winky!\" said Dobby defiantly. \"Dobby doesn\u0027t care what they think anymore!\"\\n\\n \"Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!\" moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face once more. \"My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her...oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!\" She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.\\n\\n \"Winky,\" said Hermione firmly, \"I\u0027m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you. We\u0027ve seen him, you know -\"\\n\\n \"You is seeing my master?\" said Winky breathlessly, raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at Hermione. \"You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Hermione, \"he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Bagman comes too?\" squeaked Winky, and to Harry \u0027s great surprise (and Ron\u0027s and Hermione\u0027s too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again. \"Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My master isn\u0027t liking him, oh no, not at all!\"\\n\\n \"Bagman - bad?\" said Harry.\\n\\n \"Oh yes,\" Winky said, nodding her head furiously, \"My master is telling Winky some things! But Winky is not saying...Winky - Winky keeps her master\u0027s secrets....\"\\n\\n She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt, \"Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more!\"\\n\\n They couldn\u0027t get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages.\\n\\n \"Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!\" he said happily, pointing at his bare chest.\\n\\n \"Tell you what, Dobby,\" said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, \"I\u0027ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don\u0027t mind maroon, do you?\"\\n\\n Dobby was delighted.\\n\\n \"We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,\" Ron told him, \"but it\u0027ll go well with your tea cozy.\"\\n\\n As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.\\n\\n \"Thanks a lot!\" Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night. \"See you, Dobby!\"\\n\\n \"Harry Potter...can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?\" Dobby asked tentatively.\\n\\n \" \u0027Course you can,\" said Harry, and Dobby beamed.\\n\\n \"You know what?\" said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. \"All these years I\u0027ve been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens - well, it\u0027s not exactly difficult, is it? They can\u0027t wait to give it away!\"\\n\\n \"I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know,\" said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. \"Dobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it\u0027ll dawn on them that they want that too!\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s hope they don\u0027t look too closely at Winky,\" said Harry.\\n\\n \"Oh she\u0027ll cheer up,\" said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful. \"Once the shock\u0027s worn off, and she\u0027s got used to Hogwarts, she\u0027ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man.\"\\n\\n \"She seems to love him,\" said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake). \"Doesn\u0027t think much of Bagman, though, does she?\" said Harry. \"Wonder what Crouch says at home about him?\"\\n\\n \"Probably says he\u0027s not a very good Head of Department,\" said Hermione, \"and let\u0027s face it...he\u0027s got a point, hasn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d still rather work for him than old Crouch,\" said Ron. \"At least Bagman\u0027s got a sense of humor.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let Percy hear you saying that,\" Hermione said, smiling slightly.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, Percy wouldn\u0027t want to work for anyone with a sense of humor, would he?\" said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair. \"Percy wouldn\u0027t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby\u0027s tea cozy.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-harry-potter-4/page-21.html","bookId":1565,"book":{"id":1565,"title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter #4)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter #4) \\n In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season\u0027s premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder. \\n Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians\u0027 schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-harry-potter-4.jpg","author":"J.K.
