{"id":109665,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"It comes down to this,\" said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. \"Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn\u0027t looking.\" \"It must\u0027ve been Crouch,\" said Ron at once. \"That\u0027s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He\u0027d done a runner.\" \"I don\u0027t think so,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"He seemed really weak - I don\u0027t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.\" \"You can\u0027t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven\u0027t I told you enough times?\" said Hermione. \"Okay...hows this for a theory,\" said Ron excitedly. \"Krum attacked Crouch - no, wait for it - and then Stunned himself!\" \"And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?\" said Hermione coldly. \"Oh yeah...\" It was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch. \"Just go through it again, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"What did Mr. Crouch actually say?\" \"I\u0027ve told you, he wasn\u0027t making much sense,\" said Harry. \"He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault....He mentioned his son.\" \"Well, that was his fault,\" said Hermione testily. \"He was out of his mind,\" said Harry. \"Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions.\" \"And...remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?\" said Ron tentatively. \"I\u0027ve told you,\" Harry repeated dully. \"He said he\u0027s getting stronger.\" There was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, \"But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving....\" \"He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,\" said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name. \"He was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.\" Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The many perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night\u0027s hunting with a mouse in its beak. \"If Snape hadn\u0027t held me up,\" Harry said bitterly, \"we might\u0027ve got there in time. \u0027The headmaster is busy. Potter...what\u0027s this rubbish, Potter?\u0027 Why couldn\u0027t he have just got out of the way?\" \"Maybe he didn\u0027t want you to get there!\" said Ron quickly. \"Maybe - hang on - how fast d\u0027you reckon he could\u0027ve gotten down to the forest? D\u0027you reckon he could\u0027ve beaten you and Dumbledore there?\" \"Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,\" said Harry. \"Wouldn\u0027t put it past him,\" Ron muttered. \"We need to see Professor Moody,\" said Hermione. \"We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch.\" \"If he had the Marauder\u0027s Map on him, it would\u0027ve been easy,\" said Harry. \"Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,\" said Ron, \"because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn\u0027t -\" \"Shh!\" said Hermione suddenly. Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer. \"- that\u0027s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that-\" \"- we\u0027ve tried being polite; it\u0027s time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn\u0027t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did -\" \"I\u0027m telling you, if you put that in writing, it\u0027s blackmail!\" \"Yeah, and you won\u0027t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?\" The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"What\u0027re you doing here?\" Ron and Fred said at the same time. \"Sending a letter,\" said Harry and George in unison. \"What, at this time?\" said Hermione and Fred. Fred grinned. \"Fine - we won\u0027t ask you what you\u0027re doing, if you don\u0027t ask us,\" he said. He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered. \"Well, don\u0027t let us hold you up,\" Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the door. Ron didn\u0027t move. \"Who\u0027re you blackmailing?\" he said. The grin vanished from Fred\u0027s face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron. \"Don\u0027t be stupid, I was only joking,\" he said easily. \"Didn\u0027t sound like that,\" said Ron. Fred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, \"I\u0027ve told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can\u0027t see why you would, but -\" \"It\u0027s my business if you\u0027re blackmailing someone,\" said Ron. \"George\u0027s right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.\" \"Told you, I was joking,\" said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. \"You\u0027re starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you\u0027ll be made a prefect.\" \"No, I won\u0027t!\" said Ron hotly. George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George turned around and grinned at Ron. \"Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later.\" He and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another. \"You don\u0027t think they know something about all this, do you?\" Hermione whispered. \"About Crouch and everything?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"If it was something that serious, they\u0027d tell someone. They\u0027d tell Dumbledore.\" Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" Hermione asked him. \"Well...\" said Ron slowly, \"I dunno if they would. They\u0027re...they\u0027re obsessed with making money lately, I noticed it when I was hanging around with them - when - you know -\" \"We weren\u0027t talking.\" Harry finished the sentence for him. \"Yeah, but blackmail...\" \"It\u0027s this joke shop idea they\u0027ve got,\" said Ron. \"I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. They\u0027ve only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it\u0027s time to think about their future, and Dad can\u0027t help them, and they need gold to get started.\" Hermione was looking uncomfortable now. \"Yes, but...they wouldn\u0027t do anything against the law to get gold.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t they?\" said Ron, looking skeptical. \"I dunno...they don\u0027t exactly mind breaking rules, do they?\" \"Yes, but this is the law,\" said Hermione, looking scared. \"This isn\u0027t some silly school rule....They\u0027ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron...maybe you\u0027d better tell Percy....\" \"Are you mad?\" said Ron. \"Tell Percy? He\u0027d probably do a Crouch and turn them in.\" He stared at the window through which Fred and George\u0027s owl had departed, then said, \"Come on, let\u0027s get some breakfast.\" \"D\u0027you think it\u0027s too early to go and see Professor Moody?\" Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase. \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"He\u0027d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he\u0027ll think we\u0027re trying to attack him while he\u0027s asleep. Let\u0027s give it till break.\" History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron\u0027s watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron\u0027s was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn\u0027t taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus. When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual. \"Professor Moody?\" Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd. \"Hello, Potter,\" growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody\u0027s head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again. \"Come in here.\" He stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and closed the door. \"Did you find him?\" Harry asked without preamble. \"Mr. Crouch?\" \"No,\" said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask. \"Did you use the map?\" Harry said. \"Of course,\" said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. \"Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn\u0027t anywhere on there.\" \"So he did Disapparate?\" said Ron. \"You can\u0027t Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!\" said Hermione. \"There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren\u0027t there, Professor?\" Moody\u0027s magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. \"You\u0027re another one who might think about a career as an Auror,\" he told her. \"Mind works the right way. Granger.\" Hermione flushed pink with pleasure. \"Well, he wasn\u0027t invisible,\" said Harry. \"The map shows invisible people. He must\u0027ve left the grounds, then.\" \"But under his own steam?\" said Hermione eagerly, \"or because someone made him?\" \"Yeah, someone could\u0027ve - could\u0027ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn\u0027t they?\" said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror. \"We can\u0027t rule out kidnap,\" growled Moody. \"So,\" said Ron, \"d\u0027you reckon he\u0027s somewhere in Hogsmeade?\" \"Could be anywhere,\" said Moody, shaking his head. \"Only thing we know for sure is that he\u0027s not here.\" He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth. Then he said, \"Now, Dumbledore\u0027s told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there\u0027s nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry\u0027ll be looking for him now, Dumbledore\u0027s notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task.\" \"What?\" said Harry. \"Oh yeah...\" He hadn\u0027t given the maze a single thought since he\u0027d left it with Krum the previous night. \"Should be right up your street, this one,\" said Moody, looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. \"From what Dumbledore\u0027s said, you\u0027ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerers Stone in your first year, didn\u0027t you?\" \"We helped,\" Ron said quickly. \"Me and Hermione helped.\" Moody grinned. \"Well, help him practice for this one, and I\u0027ll be very surprised if he doesn\u0027t win,\" said Moody. \"In the meantime...constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance.\" He took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window. The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it. \"You two,\" counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, \"you stick close to Potter, all right? I\u0027m keeping an eye on things, but all the same...you can never have too many eyes out.\" Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down beside Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione, clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, \"Ha! She hasn\u0027t got wind of Crouch!\" then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last. Harry - what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest with Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night. There is somebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts. It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark. You could have been killed. Your name didn\u0027t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident. If someone\u0027s trying to attack you, they\u0027re on their last chance. Stay close to Ron and Hermione, do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third task. Practice Stunning and Disarming. A few hexes wouldn\u0027t go amiss either. There\u0027s nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your head down and look after yourself. I\u0027m waiting for your letter giving me your word you won\u0027t stray out-of-bounds again. Sirius \"Who\u0027s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?\" said Harry in mild indignation as he folded up Sirius\u0027s letter and put it inside his robes. \"After all the stuff he did at school!\" \"He\u0027s worried about you!\" said Hermione sharply. \"Just like Moody and Hagrid! So listen to them!\" \"No one\u0027s tried to attack me all year,\" said Harry. \"No one\u0027s done anything to me at all-\" \"Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,\" said Hermione. \"And they must\u0027ve done that for a reason. Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they\u0027ve been biding their time. Maybe this is the task they\u0027re going to get you.\" \"Look,\" said Harry impatiently, \"let\u0027s say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch. Well, they would\u0027ve been in the trees near us, wouldn\u0027t they? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted, didn\u0027t they? So it doesn\u0027t look like I\u0027m their target, does it?\" \"They couldn\u0027t have made it look like an accident if they\u0027d murdered you in the forest!\" said Hermione. \"But if you die during a task-\" \"They didn\u0027t care about attacking Krum, did they?\" said Harry. \"Why didn\u0027t they just polish me off at the same time? They could\u0027ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something.\" \"Harry, I don\u0027t understand it either,\" said Hermione desperately. \"I just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don\u0027t like it....Moody\u0027s right - Sirius is right - you\u0027ve got to get in training for the third task, straight away. And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you\u0027re not going to go sneaking off alone again.\" The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to stay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron\u0027s and Hermione\u0027s part. \"Can\u0027t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?\" Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. \"Let\u0027s Stun her for a bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he\u0027d do anything to help you. I\u0027m not complaining or anything\" - he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside - \"but I\u0027m aching all over....\" \"Well, you keep missing the cushions, don\u0027t you!\" said Hermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. \"Just try and fall backward!\" \"Once you\u0027re Stunned, you can\u0027t aim too well, Hermione! \"said Ron angrily. \"Why don\u0027t you take a turn?\" \"Well, I think Harry\u0027s got it now, anyway,\" said Hermione hastily. \"And we don\u0027t have to worry about Disarming, because he\u0027s been able to do that for ages....I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening.\" She looked down the list they had made in the library. \"I like the look of this one,\" she said, \"this Impediment Curse. Should slow down anything that\u0027s trying to attack you. Harry. We\u0027ll start with that one.\" The bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwick\u0027s cupboard and slipped out of the classroom. \"See you at dinner!\" said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows. The sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled. \"It\u0027s going to be boiling in Trelawney\u0027s room, she never puts out that fire,\" said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor. He was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harry\u0027s head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played across his face. It was extremely comfortable. \"My dears,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes, \"we have almost finished our work on planetary divination. Today, however, will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is placed most interestingly at the present time. If you will all look this way, I will dim the lights....\" She waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire was the only source of light now. Professor Trelawney bent down and lifted, from under her chair, a miniature model of the solar system, contained within a glass dome. It was a beautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass. Harry watched lazily as Professor Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle Mars was making to Neptune. The heavily perfumed fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the window played across his face. He could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain. His eyelids began to droop.... He was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old, ivy-covered house set high on a hillside. Lower and lower they flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry\u0027s face, until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house and entered. Now they were flying along a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end...through the door they went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded up.... Harry had left the owl\u0027s back...he was watching, now, as it fluttered across the room, into a chair with its back to him....There were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair...both of them were stirring.... One was a huge snake...the other was a man...a short, balding man, a man with watery eyes and a pointed nose...he was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug.... \"You are in luck, Wormtail,\" said a cold, high-pitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed. \"You are very fortunate indeed. Your blunder has not ruined everything. He is dead.\" \"My Lord!\" gasped the man on the floor. \"My Lord, I am...I am so pleased...and so sorry....\" \"Nagini,\" said the cold voice, \"you are out of luck. I will not be feeding Wormtail to you, after all...but never mind, never mind...there is still Harry Potter....\" The snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering. \"Now, Wormtail,\" said the cold voice, \"perhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you....\" \"My Lord...no...I beg you...\" The tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair. It was pointing at Wormtail. \"Crucio!\" said the cold voice. Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire, the screaming filled Harry\u0027s ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he was yelling too...Voldemort would hear him, would know he was there.... \"Harry! Harry!\" Harry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney\u0027s room with his hands over his face. His scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering. The pain had been real. The whole class was standing around him, and Ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified. \"You all right?\" he said. \"Of course he isn\u0027t!\" said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited. Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him. \"What was it. Potter? A premonition? An apparition? What did you see?\" \"Nothing,\" Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shaking. He couldn\u0027t stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemort\u0027s voice had sounded so close.... \"You were clutching your scar!\" said Professor Trelawney. \"You were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now. Potter, I have experience in these matters!\" Harry looked up at her. \"I need to go to the hospital wing, I think,\" he said. \"Bad headache.\" \"My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!\" said Professor Trelawney. \"If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever -\" \"I don\u0027t want to see anything except a headache cure,\" said Harry. He stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved. \"See you later,\" Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat. When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off for the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore\u0027s office. He marched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream...it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive....He ran over the details in his mind, trying to make sure he could remember them....He had heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a blunder...but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead...so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake...he, Harry, was going to be fed to it instead.... Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledores office without noticing. He blinked, looked around, realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it. Then he remembered that he didn\u0027t know the password. \"Sherbet lemon?\" he tried tentatively. The gargoyle did not move. \"Okay,\" said Harry, staring at it, \"Pear Drop. Er - Licorice Wand. Fizzing Whizbee. Drooble\u0027s Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott\u0027s Every Flavor Beans...oh no, he doesn\u0027t like them, does he?...oh just open, can\u0027t you?\" he said angrily. \"I really need to see him, its urgent!\" The gargoyle remained immovable. Harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe. \"Chocolate Frog!\" he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. \"Sugar Quill! Cockroach Cluster!\" The gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry blinked. \"Cockroach Cluster?\" he said, amazed. \"I was only joking....\" He hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase, which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him, taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker. He could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated, listening. \"Dumbledore, I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t see the connection, don\u0027t see it at all!\" It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. \"Ludo says Berthas perfectly capable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have expected to have found her by now, but all the same, we\u0027ve no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at all. As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch\u0027s!\" \"And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?\" said Moody\u0027s growling voice. \"I see two possibilities, Alastor,\" said Fudge. \"Either Crouch has finally cracked - more than likely, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll agree, given his personal history - lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere -\" \"He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Or else - well...\" Fudge sounded embarrassed. \"Well, I\u0027ll reserve judgment until after I\u0027ve seen the place where he was found, but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you know what that woman is?\" \"I consider her to be a very able headmistress - and an excellent dancer,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Dumbledore, come!\" said Fudge angrily. \"Don\u0027t you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid? They don\u0027t all turn out harmless - if, indeed, you can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster fixation he\u0027s got -\" \"I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, just as calmly. \"I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced, Cornelius.\" \"Can we wrap up this discussion?\" growled Moody. \"Yes, yes, let\u0027s go down to the grounds, then,\" said Fudge impatiently. \"No, it\u0027s not that,\" said Moody, \"it\u0027s just that Potter wants a word with you, Dumbledore. He\u0027s just outside the door.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-harry-potter-4/page-29.html","bookId":1565,"book":{"id":1565,"title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter #4)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter #4) In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K.
