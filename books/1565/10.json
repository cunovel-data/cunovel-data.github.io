{"id":109646,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Mr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague \"Merry Christmas.\" \"He\u0027ll be all right,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor. \"Sometimes, when a person\u0027s memory\u0027s modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while...and that was a big thing they had to make him forget.\" They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St. Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane. \"Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!\" Mrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard, came running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in her hand. \"Arthur - I\u0027ve been so worried - so worried -\" She flung her arms around Mr. Weasley\u0027s neck, and the Daily Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling black-and-white photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops. \"You\u0027re all right,\" Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, \"you\u0027re alive....Oh boys...\" And to everybody\u0027s surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together. \"Ouch! Mum - you\u0027re strangling us -\" \"I shouted at you before you left!\" Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob. \"It\u0027s all I\u0027ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn\u0027t get enough OW.L.s? Oh Fred...George...\" \"Come on, now, Molly, we\u0027re all perfectly okay,\" said Mr. Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house. \"Bill,\" he added in an undertone, \"pick up that paper, I want to see what it says...\" When they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and Hermione had made Mrs. Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhiskey, Bill handed his father the newspaper. Mr. Weasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his shoulder. \"I knew it,\" said Mr. Weasley heavily. \"Ministry blunders...culprits not apprehended...lax security...Dark wizards running unchecked...national disgrace....Who wrote this? Ah...of course...Rita Skeeter.\" \"That woman\u0027s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!\" said Percy furiously. \"Last week she was saying we\u0027re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness, when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn\u0027t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans -\" \"Do us a favor, Perce,\" said Bill, yawning, \"and shut up.\" \"I\u0027m mentioned,\" said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article. \"Where?\" spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whiskey. \"If I\u0027d seen that, I\u0027d have known you were alive!\" \"Not by name,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Listen to this: \u0027If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry of Magic, they were sadly disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but refusing to give any more information. Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be seen.\u0027.Oh really,\" said Mr. Weasley in exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. \"Nobody was hurt. What was I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods...well, there certainly will be rumors now she\u0027s printed that.\" He heaved a deep sigh. \"Molly, I\u0027m going to have to go into the office; this is going to take some smoothing over.\" \"I\u0027ll come with you, Father,\" said Percy importantly. \"Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person.\" He bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset. \"Arthur, you\u0027re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn\u0027t got anything to do with your office; surely they can handle this without you?\" \"I\u0027ve got to go, Molly,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I\u0027ve made things worse. I\u0027ll just change into my robes and I\u0027ll be off....\" \"Mrs. Weasley,\" said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, \"Hedwig hasn\u0027t arrived with a letter for me, has she?\" \"Hedwig, dear?\" said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. \"No...no, there hasn\u0027t been any post at all.\" Ron and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at both of them he said, \"All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?\" \"Yeah...think I will too,\" said Ron at once. \"Hermione?\" \"Yes,\" she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs. \"What\u0027s up, Harry?\" said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them. \"There\u0027s something I haven\u0027t told you,\" Harry said. \"On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.\" Ron\u0027s and Hermione\u0027s reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked dumbstruck. \"But - he wasn\u0027t there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean - last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn\u0027t he?\" \"I\u0027m sure he wasn\u0027t on Privet Drive,\" said Harry. \"But I was dreaming about him...him and Peter - you know, Wormtail. I can\u0027t remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill...someone.\" He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying \"me,\" but couldn\u0027t bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did. \"It was only a dream,\" said Ron bracingly. \"Just a nightmare.\" \"Yeah, but was it, though?\" said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky. \"It\u0027s weird, isn\u0027t it?...My scar hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort\u0027s sign\u0027s up in the sky again.\" \"Don\u0027t - say - his - name!\" Ron hissed through gritted teeth. \"And remember what Professor Trelawney said?\" Harry went on, ignoring Ron. \"At the end of last year?\" Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts. Hermione\u0027s terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort. \"Oh Harry, you aren\u0027t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?\" \"You weren\u0027t there,\" said Harry. \"You didn\u0027t hear her. This time was different. I told you, she went into a trance - a real one. And she said the Dark Lord would rise again...greater and more terrible than ever before...and he\u0027d manage it because his servant was going to go back to him...and that night Wormtail escaped.\" There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his Chudley Cannons bedspread. \"Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?\" Hermione asked. \"Are you expecting a letter?\" \"I told Sirius about my scar,\" said Harry, shrugging. \"I\u0027m waiting for his answer.\" \"Good thinking!\" said Ron, his expression clearing. \"I bet Sirius\u0027ll know what to do!\" \"I hoped he\u0027d get back to me quickly,\" said Harry. \"But we don\u0027t know where Sirius is...he could be in Africa or somewhere, couldn\u0027t he?\" said Hermione reasonably. \"Hedwig\u0027s not going to manage that journey in a few days.\" \"Yeah, I know,\" said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky. \"Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry\" said Ron. \"Come on - three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play....You can try out the Wronski Feint....\" \"Ron,\" said Hermione, in an I-don\u0027t-think-you\u0027re-being-very-sensitive sort of voice, \"Harry doesn\u0027t want to play Quidditch right now....He\u0027s worried, and he\u0027s tired....We all need to go to bed...\" \"Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,\" said Harry suddenly. \"Hang on, I\u0027ll get my Firebolt.\" Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like \"Boys.\" Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week. Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and returned well after dinner every night. \"It\u0027s been an absolute uproar,\" Percy told them importantly the Sunday evening before they were due to return to Hogwarts. \"I\u0027ve been putting out fires all week. People keep sending Howlers, and of course, if you don\u0027t open a Howler straight away, it explodes. Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders.\" \"Why are they all sending Howlers?\" asked Ginny, who was mending her copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire. \"Complaining about security at the World Cup,\" said Percy. \"They want compensation for their ruined property. Mundungus Fletcher\u0027s put in a claim for a twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I\u0027ve got his number. I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.\" Mrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner. Harry liked this clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise very informative. It had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family\u0027s names. There were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be. \"Home,\" \"school,\" and \"work\" were there, but there was also \"traveling,\" \"lost,\" \"hospital,\" \"prison,\" and, in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, \"mortal peril.\" Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the \"home\" position, but Mr. Weasley\u0027s, which was the longest, was still pointing to \"work.\" Mrs. Weasley sighed. \"Your father hasn\u0027t had to go into the office on weekends since the days of You-Know-Who,\" she said. \"They\u0027re working him far too hard. His dinner\u0027s going to be ruined if he doesn\u0027t come home soon.\" \"Well, Father feels he\u0027s got to make up for his mistake at the match, doesn\u0027t he?\" said Percy. \"If truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first -\" \"Don\u0027t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote!\" said Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once. \"If Dad hadn\u0027t said anything, old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented,\" said Bill, who was playing chess with Ron. \"Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good. Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts\u0027 Charm Breakers once, and called me \u0027a long-haired pillock\u0027?\" \"Well, it is a bit long, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley gently. \"If you\u0027d just let me -\" \"No, Mum.\" Rain lashed against the living room window. Hermione was immersed in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had bought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley. Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava. Harry was polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads bent over a piece of parchment. \"What are you two up to?\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes on the twins. \"Homework,\" said Fred vaguely. \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous, you\u0027re still on holiday,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Yeah, we\u0027ve left it a bit late,\" said George. \"You\u0027re not by any chance writing out a new order form, are you?\" said Mrs. Weasley shrewdly. \"You wouldn\u0027t be thinking of restarting Weasleys\u0027 Wizard Wheezes, by any chance?\" \"Now, Mum,\" said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face. \"If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow, and George and I died, how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation?\" Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley. \"Oh your father\u0027s coming!\" she said suddenly, looking up at the clock again. Mr. Weasley\u0027s hand had suddenly spun from \"work\" to \"traveling\"; a second later it had shuddered to a halt on \"home\" with the others, and they heard him calling from the kitchen. \"Coming, Arthur!\" called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying out of the room. A few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray. He looked completely exhausted. \"Well, the fat\u0027s really in the fire now,\" he told Mrs. Weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower. \"Rita Skeeter\u0027s been ferreting around all week, looking for more Ministry mess-ups to report. And now she\u0027s found out about poor old Bertha going missing, so that\u0027ll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow. I told Bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago.\" \"Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks,\" said Percy swiftly. \"Crouch is very lucky Rita hasn\u0027t found out about Winky,\" said Mr. Weasley irritably. \"There\u0027d be a week\u0027s worth of headlines in his house-elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark.\" \"I thought we were all agreed that that elf, while irresponsible, did not conjure the Mark?\" said Percy hotly. \"If you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves!\" said Hermione angrily. \"Now look here, Hermione!\" said Percy. \"A high-ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants -\" \"His slave, you mean!\" said Hermione, her voice rising passionately, \"because he didn\u0027t pay Winky, did he?\" \"I think you\u0027d all better go upstairs and check that you\u0027ve packed properly!\" said Mrs. Weasley, breaking up the argument. \"Come on now, all of you....\" Harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his Firebolt over his shoulder, and went back upstairs with Ron. The rain sounded even louder at the top of the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic. Pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered. The sight of the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement. \"Bung him some Owl Treats,\" said Ron, throwing a packet across to Harry. \"It might shut him up.\" Harry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon\u0027s cage, then turned to his trunk. Hedwig\u0027s cage stood next to it, still empty. \"It\u0027s been over a week,\" Harry said, looking at Hedwig\u0027s deserted perch. \"Ron, you don\u0027t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?\" \"Nah, it would\u0027ve been in the Daily Prophet,\" said Ron. \"The Ministry would want to show they\u0027d caught someone, wouldn\u0027t they?\" \"Yeah, I suppose....\" \"Look, here\u0027s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley. And she\u0027s got some gold out of your vault for you...and she\u0027s washed all your socks.\" He heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry\u0027s camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it. Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-making kit - he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him. \"What is that supposed to be?\" He was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long, maroon velvet dress. It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs. There was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley entered, carrying an armful of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes. \"Here you are,\" she said, sorting them into two piles. \"Now, mind you pack them properly so they don\u0027t crease.\" \"Mum, you\u0027ve given me Ginny\u0027s new dress,\" said Ron, handing it out to her. \"Of course I haven\u0027t,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"That\u0027s for you. Dress robes.\" \"What?\" said Ron, looking horror-struck. \"Dress robes!\" repeated Mrs. Weasley. \"It says on your school list that you\u0027re supposed to have dress robes this year...robes for formal occasions.\" \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding,\" said Ron in disbelief. \"I\u0027m not wearing that, no way.\" \"Everyone wears them, Ron!\" said Mrs. Weasley crossly. \"They\u0027re all like that! Your father\u0027s got some for smart parties!\" \"I\u0027ll go starkers before I put that on,\" said Ron stubbornly. \"Don\u0027t be so silly,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"You\u0027ve got to have dress robes, they\u0027re on your list! I got some for Harry too...show him, Harry....\" In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn\u0027t as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn\u0027t have any lace on them at all - in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black. \"I thought they\u0027d bring out the color of your eyes, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley fondly. \"Well, they\u0027re okay!\" said Ron angrily, looking at Harry\u0027s robes. \"Why couldn\u0027t I have some like that?\" \"Because...well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn\u0027t a lot of choice!\" said Mrs. Weasley, flushing. Harry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it. \"I\u0027m never wearing them,\" Ron was saying stubbornly. \"Never.\" \"Fine,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"Go naked. And, Harry, make sure you get a picture of him. Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.\" She left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny spluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat. \"Why is everything I own rubbish?\" said Ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon\u0027s beak.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-harry-potter-4/page-10.html","bookId":1565,"book":{"id":1565,"title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter #4)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter #4) In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season\u0027s premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder. Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians\u0027 schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests.
