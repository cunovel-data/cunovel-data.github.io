{"id":3484,"no":54,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"Eskel Gorov stirred on his couch and opened one eye as Limmar Ponyetsentered the heavily reinforced door. It boomed shut behind him. Gorovsputtered and came to his feet. \n \"Ponyets! They sent you?\"\"Pure chance,\" said Ponyets, bitterly, \"or the work of my own personalmalevolent demon. Item one, you get into a mess on Askone. Item two, mysales route, as known to the Board of Trade, carries me within fiftyparsecs of the system at just the time of item one. Item three, we\u0027veworked together before and the Board knows it. Isn\u0027t that a sweet,inevitable set-up? The answer just pops out of a slot.\"\"Be careful,\" said Gorov, tautly. \"There\u0027ll be someone listening. Are youwearing a Field Distorter?\"Ponyets indicated the ornamented bracelet that hugged his wrist and Gorovrelaxed. \n Ponyets looked about him. The cell was bare, but large. It was well-lit andit lacked offensive odors. He said, \"Not bad. They\u0027re treating you with kidgloves.\"Gorov brushed the remark aside, \"Listen, how did you get down here? I\u0027vebeen in strict solitary for almost two weeks.\"\"Ever since I came, huh? Well, it seems the old bird who\u0027s boss here hashis weak points. He leans toward pious speeches, so I took a chance thatworked. I\u0027m here in the capacity of your spiritual adviser. There\u0027ssomething about a pious man such as he. He will cheerfully cut your throatif it suits him, but he will hesitate to endanger the welfare of yourimmaterial and problematical soul. It\u0027s just a piece of empiricalpsychology. A trader has to know a little of everything.\"Gorov\u0027s smile was sardonic, \"And you\u0027ve been to theological school as well. \n You\u0027re all right, Ponyets. I\u0027m glad they sent you. But the Grand Masterdoesn\u0027t love my soul exclusively. Has he mentioned a ransom?\"The trader\u0027s eyes narrowed, \"He hinted ? barely. And he also threateneddeath by gas. I played safe, and dodged; it might easily have been a trap. \n So it\u0027s extortion, is it? What is it he wants?\"\"Gold.\"\"Gold!\" Ponyets frowned. \"The metal itself? What for?\"\"It\u0027s their medium of exchange.\"\"Is it? And where do I get gold from?\"\"Wherever you can. Listen to me; this is important. Nothing will happen tome as long as the Grand Master has the scent of gold in his nose. Promiseit to him; as much as he asks for. Then go back to the Foundation, ifnecessary, to get it. When I\u0027m free, we\u0027ll be escorted out of the system,and then we part company.\"Ponyets stared disapprovingly, \"And then you\u0027ll come back and try again.\"\"It\u0027s my assignment to sell nucleics to Askone.\"\"They\u0027ll get you before you\u0027ve gone a parsec in space. You know that, Isuppose.\"\"I don\u0027t,\" said Gorov. \"And if I did, it wouldn\u0027t affect things.\"\"They\u0027ll kill you the second time.\"Gorov shrugged. \n Ponyets said quietly, \"If I\u0027m going to negotiate with the Grand Masteragain, I want to know the whole story. So far, I\u0027ve been working it tooblind. As it was, the few mild remarks I did make almost threw hisVeneration into fits.\"\"It\u0027s simple enough,\" said Gorov. \"The only way we can increase thesecurity of the Foundation here in the Periphery is to form areligion-controlled commercial empire. We\u0027re still too weak to be able toforce political control. It\u0027s all we can do to hold the Four Kingdoms.\"Ponyets was nodding. \"This I realize. And any system that doesn\u0027t acceptnuclear gadgets can never be placed under our religious control? \n \"And can therefore become a focal point for independence and hostility. \n Yes.\"\"All right, then,\" said Ponyets, \"so much for theory. Now what exactlyprevents the sale. Religion? The Grand Master implied as much.\"\"It\u0027s a form of ancestor worship. Their traditions tell of an evil pastfrom which they were saved by the simple and virtuous heroes of the pastgenerations. It amounts to a distortion of the anarchic period a centuryago, when the imperial troops were driven out and an independent governmentwas set up. Advanced science and nuclear power in particular becameidentified with the old imperial regime they remember with horror.\"\"That so? But they have nice little ships which spotted me very handily twoparsecs away. That smells of nucleics to me.\"Gorov shrugged. \"Those ships are holdovers of the Empire, no doubt. \n Probably with nuclear drive. What they have, they keep. The point is thatthey will not innovate and their internal economy is entirely non-nuclear. \n That is what we must change.\"\"How were you going to do it?\"\"By breaking the resistance at one point. To put it simply, if I could sella penknife with a force-field blade to a nobleman, it would be to hisinterest to force laws that would allow him to use it. Put that baldly, itsounds silly, but it is sound, psychologically. To make strategic sales, atstrategic points, would be to create a pro-nucleics faction at court.\"\"And they send you for that purpose, while I\u0027m only here to ransom you andleave, while you keep on trying? Isn\u0027t that sort of tail-backward?\"\"In what way?\" said Gorov, guardedly. \n \"Listen,\" Ponyets was suddenly exasperated, \"you\u0027re a diplomat, not atrader, and calling you a trader won\u0027t make you one. This case is for onewho\u0027s made a business of selling ?and I\u0027m here with a full cargo stinkinginto uselessness, and a quota that won\u0027t ever be met, it looks like.\"\"You mean you\u0027re going to risk your life on something that isn\u0027t yourbusiness?\" Gorov smiled thinly. \n Ponyets said, \"You mean that this is a matter of patriotism and tradersaren\u0027t patriotic?\"\"Notoriously not. Pioneers never are.\"\"All right. I\u0027ll grant that. I don\u0027t scoot about space to save theFoundation or anything like that. But I\u0027m out to make money, and this is mychance. If it helps the Foundation at the same time, all the better. AndI\u0027ve risked my life on slimmer chances.\"Ponyets rose, and Gorov rose with him, \"What are you going to do?\"The trader smiled, \"Gorov, I don\u0027t know ?not yet. But if the crux of thematter is to make a sale, then I\u0027m your man. I\u0027m not a boaster as a generalthing, but there\u0027s one thing I\u0027ll always back up. I\u0027ve never ended up belowquota yet.\"The door to the cell opened almost instantly when he knocked, and twoguards fell in on either side. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47226.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
