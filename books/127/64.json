{"id":3494,"no":64,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"It was evening of the same day, and in Jorane Sutt\u0027s bachelor apartment onthe twenty-first floor of the Hardin Building, Publis Manlio was sippingwine slowly. \n It was Publis Manlio in whose slight, aging body were fulfilled two greatoffices of the Foundation. He was Foreign Secretary in the mayor\u0027s cabinet,and to all the outer suns, barring only the Foundation itself, he was, inaddition, Primate of the Church, Purveyor of the Holy Food, Master of theTemples, and so forth almost indefinitely in confusing but sonoroussyllables. \n He was saying, \"But he agreed to let you send out that trader. It is apoint.\"\"But such a small one,\" said Sutt. \"It gets us nothing immediately. Thewhole business is the crudest sort of stratagem, since we have no way offoreseeing it to the end. It is a mere paying out of rope on the chancethat somewhere along the length of it will be a noose.\"\"True. And this Mallow is a capable man. What if he is not an easy prey todupery?\"\"That is a chance that must be run. If there is treachery, it is thecapable men that are implicated. If not, we need a capable man to detectthe truth. And Mallow will be guarded. Your glass is empty.\"\"No, thanks. I\u0027ve had enough.\"Sutt filled his own glass and patiently endured the other\u0027s uneasy reverie. \n Of whatever the reverie consisted, it ended indecisively, for the primatesaid suddenly, almost explosively, \"Sutt, what\u0027s on your mind?\"\"I\u0027ll tell you, Manlio.\" His thin lips parted, \"We\u0027re in the middle of aSeldon crisis.\"Manlio stared, then said softly, \"How do you know? Has Seldon appeared inthe Time Vault again?\"\"That much, my friend, is not necessary. Look, reason it out. Since theGalactic Empire abandoned the Periphery, and threw us on our own, we havenever had an opponent who possessed nuclear power. Now, for the first time,we have one. That seems significant even if it stood by itself. And itdoesn\u0027t. For the first time in over seventy years, we are facing a majordomestic political crisis. I should think the synchronization of the twocrises, inner and outer, puts it beyond all doubt.\"Manlio\u0027s eyes narrowed, \"If that\u0027s all, it\u0027s not enough. There have beentwo Seldon crises so far, and both times the Foundation was in danger ofextermination. Nothing can be a third crisis till that danger returns.\"Sutt never showed impatience, \"That danger is coming. Any fool can tell acrisis when it arrives. The real service to the state is to detect it inembryo. Look, Manlio, we\u0027re proceeding along a planned history. We knowthat Hari Seldon worked out the historical probabilities of the future. Weknow that some day we\u0027re to rebuild the Galactic Empire. We know that itwill take a thousand years or thereabouts. And we know that in the intervalwe will face certain definite crises. \n \"Now the first crisis came fifty years after the establishment of theFoundation, and the second, thirty years later than that. Almostseventy-five years have gone since. It\u0027s time, Manlio, it\u0027s time.\"Manlio rubbed his nose uncertainly, \"And you\u0027ve made your plans to meetthis crisis?\"Sutt nodded. \n \"And I,\" continued Manlio, \"am to play a part in it?\"Sutt nodded again, \"Before we can meet the foreign threat of atomic power,we\u0027ve got to put our own house in order. These traders? \n \"Ah!\" The primate stiffened, and his eyes grew sharp. \n \"That\u0027s right. These traders. They are useful, but they are too strong ? \n and too uncontrolled. They are Outlanders, educated apart from religion. Onthe one hand, we put knowledge into their hands, and on the other, weremove our strongest hold upon them.\"\"If we can prove treachery?\"\"If we could, direct action would be simple and sufficient. But thatdoesn\u0027t signify in the least. Even if treason among them did not exist,they would form an uncertain element in our society. They wouldn\u0027t be boundto us by patriotism or common descent, or even by religious awe. Undertheir secular leadership, the outer provinces, which, since Hardin\u0027s time,look to us as the Holy Planet, might break away.\"\"I see all that, but the cure? \n \"The cure must come quickly, before the Seldon Crisis becomes acute. Ifnuclear weapons are without and disaffection within, the odds might be toogreat.\" Sutt put down the empty glass he had been fingering, \"This isobviously your job.\"\"Mine?\"\"I can\u0027t do it. My office is appointive and has no legislative standing.\"\"The mayor? \n \"Impossible. His personality is entirely negative. He is energetic only inevading responsibility. But if an independent party arose that mightendanger re-election, he might allow himself to be led.\"\"But, Sutt, I lack the aptitude for practical politics.\"\"Leave that to me. Who knows, Manlio? Since Salvor Hardin\u0027s time, theprimacy and the mayoralty have never been combined in a single person. Butit might happen now ?if your job were well done.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47236.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
