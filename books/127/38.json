{"id":3468,"no":38,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"Next to Sermak himself, Lewis Bort was the most active in rallying thosedissident elements which had fused into the now-vociferous Action Party. \n Yet he had not been one of the deputation that had called on Salvor Hardinalmost half a year previously. That this was so was not due to any lack ofrecognition of his efforts; quite the contrary. He was absent for the verygood reason that he was on Anacreon\u0027s capital world at the time. \n He visited it as a private citizen. He saw no official and he did nothingof importance. He merely watched the obscure comers of the busy planet andpoked his stubby nose into dusty crannies. \n He arrived home toward the end of a short winter day that had started withclouds and was finishing with snow and within an hour was seated at theoctagonal table in Sermak\u0027s home. \n His first words were not calculated to improve the atmosphere of agathering already considerably depressed by the deepening snow-filledtwilight outside.. \n \"I\u0027m afraid,\" he said, \"that our position is what is usually termed, inmelodramatic phraseology, a \u0027Lost Cause.\u0027\"\"You think so?\" said Sermak, gloomily. \n \"It\u0027s gone past thought, Sermak. There\u0027s no room for any other opinion.\"\"Armaments? began Dokor Walto, somewhat officiously, but Bort broke in atonce. \n \"Forget that. That\u0027s an old story.\" His eyes traveled round the circle. \n \"I\u0027m referring to the people. I admit that it was my idea originally thatwe attempt to foster a palace rebellion of some sort to install as kingsomeone more favorable to the Foundation. It was a good idea. It still is. \n The only trifling flaw about it is that it is impossible. The great SalvorHardin saw to that.\"Sermak said sourly, \"If you\u0027d give us the details, Bort? \n \"Details! There aren\u0027t any! It isn\u0027t as simple as that. It\u0027s the wholedamned situation on Anacreon. It\u0027s this religion the Foundation hasestablished. It works!\"\"Well!\"\"You\u0027ve got to see it work to appreciate it. All you see here is that wehave a large school devoted to the training of priests, and thatoccasionally a special show is put on in some obscure comer of the city forthe benefit of pilgrims and that\u0027s all. The whole business hardly affectsus as a general thing. But on Anacreon? \n Lem Tarki smoothed his prim little Vandyke with one finger, and cleared histhroat. \"What kind of religion is it? Hardin\u0027s always said that it was justa fluffy flummery to get them to accept our science without question. Youremember, Sermak, he told us that day? \n \"Hardin\u0027s explanations,\" reminded Sermak, \"don\u0027t often mean much at facevalue. But what kind of a religion is it, Bort?\"Bort considered. \"Ethically, it\u0027s fine. It scarcely varies from the variousphilosophies of the old Empire. High moral standards and all that. There\u0027snothing to complain about from that viewpoint. Religion is one of the greatcivilizing influences of history and in that respect, it\u0027s fulfilling? \n \"We know that,\" interrupted Sermak, impatiently. \"Get to the point.\"\"Here it is.\" Bort was a trifle disconcerted, but didn\u0027t show it. \"Thereligion ?which the Foundation has fostered and encouraged, mind you ?isbuilt on on strictly authoritarian lines. The priesthood has sole controlof the instruments of science we have given Anacreon, but they\u0027ve learnedto handle these tools only empirically. They believe in this religionentirely, and in the ... uh ... spiritual value of the power they handle. \n For instance, two months ago some fool tampered with the power plant in theThessalekian Temple ?one of the large ones. He contaminated the city, ofcourse. It was considered divine vengeance by everyone, including thepriests.\"\"I remember. The papers had some garbled version of the story at the time. \n I don\u0027t see what you\u0027re driving at.\"\"Then, listen,\" said Bort, stiffly. \"The priesthood forms a hierarchy atthe apex of which is the king, who is regarded as a sort of minor god. He\u0027san absolute monarch by divine right, and the people believe it, thoroughly,and the priests, too. You can\u0027t overthrow a king like that. Now do you getthe point?\"\"Hold on,\" said Walto, at this point. \"What did you mean when you saidHardin\u0027s done all this? How does he come in?\"Bort glanced at his questioner bitterly. \"The Foundation has fostered thisdelusion assiduously. We\u0027ve put all our scientific backing behind the hoax. \n There isn\u0027t a festival at which the king does not preside surrounded by aradioactive aura shining forth all over his body and raising itself like acoronet above his head. Anyone touching him is severely burned. He can movefrom place to place through the air at crucial moments, supposedly byinspiration of divine spirit. He fills the temple with a pearly, internallight at a gesture. There is no end to these quite simple tricks that weperform for his benefit; but even the priests believe them, while workingthem personally.\"\"Bad!\" said Sermak, biting his lip. \n \"I could cry ? like the fountain in City Hall Park,\" said Bort, earnestly,\"when I think of the chance we muffed. Take the situation thirty years ago,when Hardin saved the Foundation from Anacreon ? At that time, theAnacreonian people had no real conception of the fact that the Empire wasrunning down. They had been more or less running their own affairs sincethe Zeonian revolt, but even after communications broke down and Lepold\u0027spirate of a grandfather made himself king, they never quite realized theEmpire had gone kaput. \n \"If the Emperor had had the nerve to try, he could have taken over againwith two cruisers and with the help of the internal revolt that would havecertainly sprung to life. And we we could have done the same; but no,Hardin established monarch worship. Personally, I don\u0027t understand it. Why? \n Why? Why?\"\"What,\" demanded Jaim Orsy, suddenly, \"does Verisof do? There was a daywhen he was an advanced Actionist. What\u0027s he doing there? Is he blind,too?\"\"I don\u0027t know,\" said Bort, curtly. \"He\u0027s high priest to them. As far as Iknow, he does nothing but act as adviser to the priesthood on technicaldetails. Figurehead, blast him, figurehead!\"There was silence all round and all eyes turned to Sermak. The young partyleader was biting a fingernail nervously, and then said loudly, \"No good. \n It\u0027s fishy!\"He looked around him, and added more energetically, \"Is Hardin then such afool?\"\"Seems to be,\" shrugged Bort. \n \"Never! There\u0027s something wrong. To cut our own throats so thoroughly andso hopelessly would require colossal stupidity. More than Hardin couldpossibly have even if he were a fool, which I deny. On the one hand, toestablish a religion that would wipe out all chance of internal troubles. \n On the other hand, to arm Anacreon with all weapons of warfare. I don\u0027t seeit.\"\"The matter is a little obscure, I admit,\" said Bort, \"but the facts arethere. What else can we think?\"Walto said, jerkily, \"Outright treason. He\u0027s in their pay.\"But Sermak shook his head impatiently. \"I don\u0027t see that, either. The wholeaffair is as insane and meaningless ? Tell me, Bort, have you heardanything about a battle cruiser that the Foundation is supposed to have putinto shape for use in the Anacreon navy?\"\"Battle cruiser?\"\"An old Imperial cruiser? \n \"No, I haven\u0027t. But that doesn\u0027t mean much. The navy yards are religioussanctuaries completely inviolate on the part of the lay public. No one everhears anything about the fleet. \n \"Well, rumors have leaked out. Some of the Party have brought the matter upin Council. Hardin never denied it, you know. His spokesmen denounced rumormongers and let it go at that. It might have significance.\"\"It\u0027s of a piece with the rest,\" said Bort. \"if true, it\u0027s absolutelycrazy. But it wouldn\u0027t be worse than the rest.\"\"I suppose,\" said Orsy, \"Hardin hasn\u0027t any secret weapon waiting. Thatmight? \n \"Yes,\" said Sermak, viciously, \"a huge jack-in-the-box that will jump outat the psychological moment and scare old Wienis into fits. The Foundationmay as well blow itself out of existence and save itself the agony ofsuspense if it has to depend on any secret weapon.\"\"Well,\" said Orsy, changing the subject hurriedly, \"the question comes downto this: How much time have we left? Eli, Bort?\"\"All fight. It is the question. But don\u0027t look at me; I don\u0027t know. TheAnacreonian press never mentions the Foundation at all. Right now, it\u0027sfull of the approaching celebrations and nothing else. Lepold is coming ofage next week, you know.\"\"We have months then.\" Walto smiled for the first time that evening. \"Thatgives us time? \n \"That gives us time, my foot,\" ground out Bort, impatiently. \"The king\u0027s agod, I tell you. Do you suppose he has to carry on a campaign of propagandato get his people into fighting spirit? Do you suppose he has to accuse usof aggression and pull out all stops on cheap emotionalism? When the timecomes to strike, Lepold gives the order and the people fight. Just likethat. That抯 the damnedness of the system. You don抰 question a god. He maygive the order tomorrow for all I know; and you can wrap tobacco round thatand smoke it.\"Everyone tried to talk at once and Sermak was slamming the table forsilence, when the front door opened and Levi Norast stamped in. He boundedup the stairs, overcoat on, trailing snow. \n \"Look at that!\" he cried, tossing a cold, snow-speckled newspaper onto thetable. \"The visicasters are full of it, too.\"The newspaper was unfolded and five heads bent over it. \n Sermak said, in a hushed voice, \"Great Space, he抯 going to Anacreon! Goingto Anacreon!\"\"It is treason,\" squeaked Tarki, in sudden excitement. \"I抣l be damned ifWalto isn抰 right. He抯 sold us out and now he抯 going there to collect hiswage.\"Sermak had risen. \"We抳e no choice now. I抦 going to ask the Counciltomorrow that Hardin be impeached. And if that fails? \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47166.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
