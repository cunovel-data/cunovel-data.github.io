The last two days hadbeen mad, sleepless ones. \n \"Mallow, you\u0027ve put on a beautiful show, so don\u0027t spoil it by jumping toohigh. You can\u0027t seriously consider running for mayor. Mob enthusiasm is apowerful thing, but it\u0027s notoriously fickle.\"\"Exactly!\" said Mallow, grimly, \"so we must coddle it, and the best way todo that is to continue the show.\"\"Now what?\"\"You\u0027re to have Publis Manlio and Jorane Sutt arrested? \n \"What!\"\"Just what you hear. Have the mayor arrest them! I don\u0027t care what threatsyou use. I control the mob, 杅or today, at any rate. He won\u0027t dare facethem.\"\"But on what charge, man?\"\"On the obvious one. They\u0027ve been inciting the priesthood of the outerplanets to take sides in the factional quarrels of the Foundation. That\u0027sillegal, by Seldon. Charge them with \u0027endangering the state.\u0027 And I don\u0027tcare about a conviction any more than they did in my case. Just get themout of circulation until I\u0027m mayor.\"\"It\u0027s half a year till election.\"\"Not too long!\" Mallow was on his feet, and his sudden grip of Jael\u0027s armwas tight. \"Listen, I\u0027d seize the government by force if I had to ?the waySalvor Hardin did a hundred years ago. There\u0027s still that Seldon crisiscoming up, and when it comes I have to be mayor and high priest. Both!\"Jael\u0027s brow furrowed. He said, quietly, \"What\u0027s it going to be? Korell,after all?\"Mallow nodded, \"Of course. They\u0027ll declare war, eventually, though I\u0027mbetting it\u0027ll take another pair of years.\"\"With nuclear ships?\"\"What do you think? Those three merchant ships we lost in their spacesector weren\u0027t knocked over with compressed-air pistols. Jael, they\u0027regetting ships from the Empire itself. Don\u0027t open your mouth like a fool. Isaid the Empire! It\u0027s still there, you know. It many be gone here in thePeriphery but in the Galactic center it\u0027s still very much alive. And onefalse move means that it, itself, may be on our neck. That\u0027s why I must bemayor and high priest. I\u0027m the only man who knows how to fight the crisis.\"Jael swallowed dryly, \"How? What are you going to do?\"\"Nothing.\"Jael smiled uncertainly, \"Really! All of that!\"But Mallow\u0027s answer was incisive, \"When I\u0027m boss of this Foundation, I\u0027mgoing to do nothing. One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secretof this crisis.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47313.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
