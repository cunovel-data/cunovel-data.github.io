{"id":3438,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"PSYCHOHISTORY?..Gaal Dornick, using nonmathematical concepts, has definedpsychohistory to be that branch of mathematics which deals with thereactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli.... \\n\\n ... Implicit in all these definitions is the assumption that the humanconglomerate being dealt with is sufficiently large for valid statisticaltreatment. The necessary size of such a conglomerate may be determined bySeldon\u0027s First Theorem which ... A further necessary assumption is that thehuman conglomerate be itself unaware of psychohistoric analysis in orderthat its reactions be truly random ... \\n\\n The basis of all valid psychohistory lies in the development of the Seldon. \\n\\n Functions which exhibit properties congruent to those of such social andeconomic forces as ... \\n\\n ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA\"Good afternoon, sir,\" said Gaal. \"I?I? \\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t think we were to meet before tomorrow? Ordinarily, we would nothave. It is just that if we are to use your services, we must work quickly. \\n\\n It grows continually more difficult to obtain recruits.\"\"I don\u0027t understand, sir.\"\"You were talking to a man on the observation tower, were you not?\"\"Yes. His first name is Jerril. I know no more about him. \"\"His name is nothing. He is an agent of the Commission of Public Safety. Hefollowed you from the space-port.\"\"But why? I am afraid I am very confused.\"\"Did the man on the tower say nothing about me?\"Gaal hesitated, \"He referred to you as Raven Seldon.\"\"Did he say why?\"\"He said you predict disaster.\"\"I do. What does Trantor mean to you?\"Everyone seemed to be asking his opinion of Trantor. Gaal felt incapable ofresponse beyond the bare word, \"Glorious.\"\"You say that without thinking. What of psychohistory?\"\"I haven\u0027t thought of applying it to the problem.\"\"Before you are done with me, young man, you will learn to applypsychohistory to all problems as a matter of course. 朞bserve.\" Seldonremoved his calculator pad from the pouch at his belt. Men said he kept onebeneath his pillow for use in moments of wakefulness. Its gray, glossyfinish was slightly worn by use. Seldon\u0027s nimble fingers, spotted now withage, played along the files and rows of buttons that filled its surface. \\n\\n Red symbols glowed out from the upper tier. \\n\\n He said, \"That represents the condition of the Empire at present.\"He waited. \\n\\n Gaal said finally, \"Surely that is not a complete representation.\"\"No, not complete,\" said Seldon. \"I am glad you do not accept my wordblindly. However, this is an approximation which will serve to demonstratethe proposition. Will you accept that?\"\"Subject to my later verification of the derivation of the function, yes.\"Gaal was carefully avoiding a possible trap. \\n\\n \"Good. Add to this the known probability of Imperial assassination,viceregal revolt, the contemporary recurrence of periods of economicdepression, the declining rate of planetary explorations, the. ....\"He proceeded. As each item was mentioned, new symbols sprang to life at histouch, and melted into the basic function which expanded and changed. \\n\\n Gaal stopped him only once. \"I don\u0027t see the validity of thatset-transformation.\"Seldon repeated it more slowly. \\n\\n Gaal said, \"But that is done by way of a forbidden sociooperation.\"\"Good. You are quick, but not yet quick enough. It is not forbidden in thisconnection. Let me do it by expansions.\"The procedure was much longer and at its end, Gaal said, humbly, \"Yes, Isee now.\"Finally, Seldon stopped. \"This is Trantor three centuries from now. How doyou interpret that? Eh?\" He put his head to one side and waited. \\n\\n Gaal said, unbelievingly, \"Total destruction! But ?but that is impossible. \\n\\n Trantor has never been ? \\n\\n Seldon was filled with the intense excitement of a man whose body only hadgrown old. \"Come, come. You saw how the result was arrived at. Put it intowords. Forget the symbolism for a moment.\"Gaal said, \"As Trantor becomes more specialized, it be comes morevulnerable, less able to defend itself. Further, as it becomes more andmore the administrative center of Empire, it becomes a greater prize. Asthe Imperial succession becomes more and more uncertain, and the feudsamong the great families more rampant, social responsibility disappears. \"\"Enough. And what of the numerical probability of total destruction withinthree centuries?\"\"I couldn\u0027t tell.\"\"Surely you can perform a field-differentiation?\"Gaal felt himself under pressure. He was not offered the calculator pad. Itwas held a foot from his eyes. He calculated furiously and felt hisforehead grow slick with sweat. \\n\\n He said, \"About 85%?\"\"Not bad,\" said Seldon, thrusting out a lower lip, \"but not good. Theactual figure is 92.5%.\"Gaal said, \"And so you are called Raven Seldon? I have seen none of this inthe journals.\"\"But of course not. This is unprintable. Do you suppose the Imperium couldexpose its shakiness in this manner. That is a very simple demonstration inpsychohistory. But some of our results have leaked out among thearistocracy.\"\"That\u0027s bad.\"\"Not necessarily. All is taken into account.\"\"But is that why I\u0027m being investigated?\"\"Yes. Everything about my project is being investigated.\"\"Are you in danger, sir?\"\"Oh, yes. There is probability of 1.7% that I will be executed, but ofcourse that will not stop the project. We have taken that into account aswell. Well, never mind. You will meet me, I suppose, at the Universitytomorrow?\"\"I will,\" said Gaal. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47136.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
