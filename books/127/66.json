He had listened long, and now he said cautiously, \"Yes,I\u0027ve heard of your campaigns to get trader representation in the council. \\n\\n But why me, Twer?\"Jaim Twer, who would remind you any time, asked or unasked, that he was inthe first group of Outlanders to receive a lay education at the Foundation,beamed. \\n\\n \"I know what I\u0027m doing,\" he said. \"Remember when I met you first, lastyear.\"\"At the Trader\u0027s Convention.\"\"Right. You ran the meeting. You had those red-necked oxen planted in theirseats, then put them in your shirtpocket and walked off with them. Andyou\u0027re all right with the Foundation masses, too. You\u0027ve got glamor ?or,at any rate, solid adventure-publicity, which is the same thing.\"\"Very good,\" said Mallow, dryly. \"But why now?\"\u0027Because now\u0027s our chance. Do you know that the Secretary of Education hashanded in his resignation? It\u0027s not out in the open yet, but it will be.\"\"How do you know?\"\"That ? never mind? He waved a disgusted hand. \"It\u0027s so. The Actionistparty is splitting wide open, and we can murder it right now on a straightquestion of equal rights for traders; or, rather, democracy, pro- andanti-.\"Mallow lounged back in his chair and stared at his thick fingers, \"Uh-uh. \\n\\n Sorry, Twer. I\u0027m leaving next week on business. You\u0027ll have to get someoneelse.\"Twer stared, \"Business? What kind of business?\"\"Very super-secret. Triple-A priority. All that, you know. Had a talk withthe mayor\u0027s own secretary.\"\"Snake Sutt?\" Jaim Twer grew excited. \"A trick. The son-of-a-spacer isgetting rid of you. Mallow? \\n\\n \"Hold on!\" Mallow\u0027s hand fell on the other\u0027s balled fist. \"Don\u0027t go into ablaze. If it\u0027s a trick, I\u0027ll be back some day for the reckoning. if itisn\u0027t, your snake, Sutt, is playing into our hands. Listen, there\u0027s aSeldon crisis coming up.\"Mallow waited for a reaction but it never came. Twer merely stared. \"What\u0027sa Seldon crisis?\"\"Galaxy!\" Mallow exploded angrily at the anticlimax, \"What the blue blazesdid you do when you went to school? What do you mean anyway by a foolquestion like that?\"The elder man frowned, \"If you\u0027ll explain? \\n\\n There was a long pause, then, \"I\u0027ll explain.\" Mallow\u0027s eyebrows lowered,and he spoke slowly. \"When the Galactic Empire began to die at the edges,and when the ends of the Galaxy reverted to barbarism and dropped away,Hari Seldon and his band of psychologists planted a colony, the Foundation,out here in the middle of the mess, so that we could incubate art, science,and technology, and form the nucleus of the Second Empire.\"\"Oh, yes, yes? \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not finished,\" said the trader, coldly. \"The future course of theFoundation was plotted according to the science of psychohistory, thenhighly developed, and conditions arranged so as to bring about a series ofcrises that will force us most rapidly along the route to future Empire. \\n\\n Each crisis, each Seldon crisis, marks an epoch in our history. We\u0027reapproaching one now ?our third.\"Twer shrugged. \"I suppose this was mentioned in school, but I\u0027ve been outof school a long time ?longer than you.\"\"I suppose so. Forget it. What matters is that I\u0027m being sent out into themiddle of the development of this crisis. There\u0027s no telling what I\u0027ll havewhen I come back, and there is a council election every year.\"Twer looked up, \"Are you on the track of anything?\"\"No.\"\"You have definite plans?\"\"Not the faintest inkling of one.\"\"Well? \\n\\n \"Well, nothing. Hardin once said: \u0027To succeed, planning alone isinsufficient. One must improvise as well.\u0027 I\u0027ll improvise.\"Twer shook his head uncertainly, and they stood, looking at each other. \\n\\n Mallow said, quite suddenly, but quite matter-of-factly, \"I tell you what,how about coming with me? Don\u0027t stare, man. You\u0027ve been a trader before youdecided them was more excitement in politics. Or so I\u0027ve heard.\"\"Where are you going? Tell me that.\"Towards the Whassallian Rift. I can\u0027t be more specific till we\u0027re out inspace. What do you say?\"Suppose Sutt decides he wants me where he can see\"Not likely. If he\u0027s anxious to get rid of me, why not of you as well? \\n\\n Besides which, no trader would hit space if he couldn\u0027t pick his own crew. \\n\\n I take whom I please.\"There was a queer glint in the older man\u0027s eyes, \"All right. I\u0027ll go.\" Heheld out his hand, \"It\u0027ll be my first trip in three years.\"Mallow grasped and shook the other\u0027s hand, \"Good! All fired good! And nowI\u0027ve got to round up the boys. You know where the Far Star docks, don \u0027tyou? Then show up tomorrow.
