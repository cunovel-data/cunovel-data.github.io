{"id":3436,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"TRANTOR?..At the beginning of the thirteenth millennium, this tendencyreached its climax. As the center of the Imperial Government for unbrokenhundreds of generations and located, as it was, toward the central regionsof the Galaxy among the most densely populated and industrially advancedworlds of the system, it could scarcely help being the densest and richestclot of humanity the Race had ever seen. Its urbanization, progressing steadily, had finally reached the ultimate. All the land surface of Trantor, 75,000,000 square miles in extent, was asingle city. The population, at its height, was well in excess of fortybillions. This enormous population was devoted almost entirely to theadministrative necessities of Empire, and found themselves all too few forthe complications of the task. (It is to be remembered that theimpossibility of proper administration of the Galactic Empire under theuninspired leadership of the later Emperors was a considerable factor inthe Fall.) Daily, fleets of ships in the tens of thousands brought theproduce of twenty agricultural worlds to the dinner tables of Trantor.... Its dependence upon the outer worlds for food and, indeed, for allnecessities of life, made Trantor increasingly vulnerable to conquest bysiege. In the last millennium of the Empire, the monotonously numerousrevolts made Emperor after Emperor conscious of this, and Imperial policybecame little more than the protection of Trantor\u0027s delicate jugularvein.... ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICAGaal was not certain whether the sun shone, or, for that matter, whether itwas day or night. He was ashamed to ask. All the planet seemed to livebeneath metal. The meal of which he had just partaken had been labelledluncheon, but there were many planets which lived a standard timescale thattook no account of the perhaps inconvenient alternation of day and night. The rate of planetary turnings differed, and he did not know that ofTrantor. At first, he had eagerly followed the signs to the \"Sun Room\" and found itbut a chamber for basking in artificial radiation. He lingered a moment ortwo, then returned to the Luxor\u0027s main lobby. He said to the room clerk, \"Where can I buy a ticket for a planetary tour?\"\"Right here.\"\"When will it start?\"\"You just missed it. Another one tomorrow. Buy a ticket now and we\u0027llreserve a place for you.\"\"Oh.\" Tomorrow would be too late. He would have to be at the Universitytomorrow. He said, \"There wouldn\u0027t be an observation tower ?or something? I mean, in the open air.\"\"Sure! Sell you a ticket for that, if you want. Better let me check if it\u0027sraining or not.\" He closed a contact at his elbow and read the flowingletters that raced across a frosted screen. Gaal read with him. The room clerk said, \"Good weather. Come to think of it, I do believe it\u0027sthe dry season now.\" He added, conversationally, \"I don\u0027t bother with theoutside myself. The last time I was in the open was three years ago. Yousee it once, you know and that\u0027s all there is to it. Here\u0027s your ticket. Special elevator in the rear. It\u0027s marked \u0027To the Tower.\u0027 Just take it.\"The elevator was of the new sort that ran by gravitic repulsion. Gaalentered and others flowed in behind him. The operator closed a contact. Fora moment, Gaal felt suspended in space as gravity switched to zero, andthen he had weight again in small measure as the elevator acceleratedupward. Deceleration followed and his feet left the floor. He squawkedagainst his will. The operator called out, \"Tuck your feet under the railing. Can\u0027t you readthe sign?\"The others had done so. They were smiling at him as he madly and vainlytried to clamber back down the wall. Their shoes pressed upward against thechromium of the railings that stretched across the floor in parallels settwo feet apart. He had noticed those railings on entering and had ignoredthem. Then a hand reached out and pulled him down. He gasped his thanks as the elevator came to a halt. He stepped out upon an open terrace bathed in a white brilliance that hurlhis eyes. The man, whose helping hand he had just now been the recipientof, was immediately behind him. The man said, kindly, \"Plenty of seats.\"Gaal closed his mouth; he had been gaping; and said, \"It certainly seemsso.\" He started for them automatically, then stopped. He said, \"If you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027ll just stop a moment at the railing. I ?Iwant to look a bit.\"The man waved him on, good-naturedly, and Gaal leaned out over theshoulder-high railing and bathed himself in all the panorama. He could not see the ground. It was lost in the ever increasingcomplexities of man-made structures. He could see no horizon other thanthat of metal against sky, stretching out to almost uniform grayness, andhe knew it was so over all the land-surface of the planet. There wasscarcely any motion to be seen ? a few pleasure-craft lazed against thesky-but all the busy traffic of billions of men were going on, he knew,beneath the metal skin of the world. There was no green to be seen; no green, no soil, no life other than man. Somewhere on the world, he realized vaguely, was the Emperor\u0027s palace, setamid one hundred square miles of natural soil, green with trees, rainbowedwith flowers. It was a small island amid an ocean of steel, but it wasn\u0027tvisible from where he stood. It might be ten thousand miles away. He didnot know. Before very long, he must have his tour! He sighed noisily, and realized finally that he was on Trantor at last; onthe planet which was the center of all the Galaxy and the kernel of thehuman race. He saw none of its weaknesses. He saw no ships of food landing. He was not aware of a jugular vein delicately connecting the forty billionof Trantor with the rest of the Galaxy. He was conscious only of themightiest deed of man; the complete and almost contemptuously finalconquest of a world. He came away a little blank-eyed. His friend of the elevator was indicatinga seat next to himself and Gaal took it. The man smiled. \"My name is Jerril. First time on Trantor?\"\"Yes, Mr. Jerril.\"\"Thought so. Jerril\u0027s my first name. Trantor gets you if you\u0027ve got thepoetic temperament. Trantorians never come up here, though. They don\u0027t likeit. Gives them nerves.\"\"Nerves! ?My name\u0027s Gaal, by the way. Why should it give them nerves? It\u0027sglorious.\"\"Subjective matter of opinion, Gaal. If you\u0027re born in a cubicle and growup in a corridor, and work in a cell, and vacation in a crowded sun-room,then coming up into the open with nothing but sky over you might just giveyou a nervous breakdown. They make the children come up here once a year,after they\u0027re five. I don\u0027t know if it does any good. They don\u0027t get enoughof it, really, and the first few times they scream themselves intohysteria. They ought to start as soon as they\u0027re weaned and have the triponce a week.\"He went on, \"Of course, it doesn\u0027t really matter. What if they never comeout at all? They\u0027re happy down there and they run the Empire. How high updo you think we are?\"He said, \"Half a mile?\" and wondered if that sounded naive. It must have, for Jerril chuckled a little. He said, \"No. Just five hundredfeet.\"\"What? But the elevator took about ? \"I know. But most of the time it was just getting up to ground level. Trantor is tunneled over a mile down. It\u0027s like an iceberg. Nine-tenths ofit is out of sight. It even works itself out a few miles into the sub-oceansoil at the shorelines. In fact, we\u0027re down so low that we can make use ofthe temperature difference between ground level and a couple of miles underto supply us with all the energy we need. Did you know that?\"\"No, I thought you used atomic generators.\"\"Did once. But this is cheaper.\"\"I imagine so.\"\"What do you think of it all?\" For a moment, the man\u0027s good natureevaporated into shrewdness. He looked almost sly. Gaal fumbled. \"Glorious,\" he said, again. \"Here on vacation? Traveling? Sight-seeing?\"\"No exactly. At least, I\u0027ve always wanted to visit Trantor but I came hereprimarily for a job.\"\"Oh?\"Gaal felt obliged to explain further, \"With Dr. Seldon\u0027s project at theUniversity of Trantor.\"\"Raven Seldon?\"\"Why, no. The one I mean is Hari Seldon. -The psychohistorian Seldon. Idon\u0027t know of any Raven Seldon.\"\"Hari\u0027s the one I mean. They call him Raven. Slang, you know. He keepspredicting disaster.\"\"He does?\" Gaal was genuinely astonished. \"Surely, you must know.\" Jerril was not smiling. \"You\u0027re coming to work forhim, aren\u0027t you?\"\"Well, yes, I\u0027m a mathematician. Why does he predict disaster? What kind ofdisaster?\"\"What kind would you think?\"\"I\u0027m afraid I wouldn\u0027t have the least idea. I\u0027ve read the papers Dr. Seldonand his group have published. They\u0027re on mathematical theory.\"\"Yes, the ones they publish.\"Gaal felt annoyed. He said, \"I think I\u0027ll go to my room now. Very pleasedto have met you.\"Jerril waved his arm indifferently in farewell. Gaal found a man waiting for him in his room. For a moment, he was toostartled to put into words the inevitable, \"What are you doing here?\" thatcame to his lips. The man rose. He was old and almost bald and he walked with a limp, but hiseyes were very bright and blue. He said, \"I am Hari Seldon,\" an instant before Gaal\u0027s befuddled brainplaced the face alongside the memory of the many times he had seen it inpictures.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47134.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
