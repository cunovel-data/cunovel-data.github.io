It was empty now and in quite anunnatural state of quiet, as it played unaccustomed host to the Commdor andhis court. \\n\\n Mallow had swung the steel sheet onto the two supports with a carelessheave. He had taken the instrument held out to him by Twer and was grippingthe leather handle inside its leaden sheath. \\n\\n \"The instrument,\" he said, \"is dangerous, but so is a buzz saw. You justhave to keep your fingers away.\"And as he spoke, he drew the muzzle-slit swiftly down the length of thesteel sheet, which quietly and instantly fell in two. \\n\\n There was a unanimous jump, and Mallow laughed. He picked up one of thehalves and propped it against his knee, \"You can adjust the cutting-lengthaccurately to a hundredth of an inch, and a two-inch sheet will slit downthe middle as easily as this thing did. If you\u0027ve got the thickness exactlyjudged, you can place steel on a wooden table, and split the metal withoutscratching the wood.\"And at each phrase, the nuclear shear moved and a gouged chunk of steelflew across the room. \\n\\n \"That,\" he said, \"is whittling ?with steel.\"He passed back the shear. \"Or else you have the plane. Do you want todecrease the thickness of a sheet, smooth out an irregularity, removecorrosion? Watch!\"Thin, transparent foil flew off the other half of the original sheet insix-inch swarths, then eight-inch, then twelve. \\n\\n \"Or drills? It\u0027s all the same principle.\"They were crowded around now. It might have been a sleight-of-hand show, acomer magician, a vaudeville act made into high-pressure salesmanship. \\n\\n Commdor Asper fingered scraps of steel. High officials of the governmenttiptoed over each other\u0027s shoulders, and whispered, while Mallow punchedclean, beautiful round holes through an inch of hard steel at every touchof his nuclear drill. \\n\\n \"Just one more demonstration. Bring two short lengths of pipe, somebody.\"An Honorable Chamberlain of something-or-other sprang to obedience in thegeneral excitement and thought-absorption, and stained his hands like anylaborer. \\n\\n Mallow stood them upright and shaved the ends off with a single stroke ofthe shear, and then joined the pipes, fresh cut to fresh cut. \\n\\n And there was a single pipe! The new ends, with even atomic irregularitiesmissing, formed one piece upon joining. \\n\\n Then Mallow looked up at his audience, stumbled at his first word andstopped. There was the keen stirring of excitement in his chest, and thebase of his stomach went tingly and cold. \\n\\n The Commdor\u0027s own bodyguard, in the confusion, had struggled to the frontline, and Mallow, for the first time, was near enough to see theirunfamiliar hand-weapons in detail. \\n\\n They were nuclear! There was no mistaking it; an explosive projectileweapon with a barrel like that was impossible. But that wasn\u0027t the bigpoint. That wasn\u0027t the point at all. \\n\\n The butts of those weapons had, deeply etched upon them, in worn goldplating, the Spaceship-and-Sun! \\n\\n The same Spaceship-and-Sun that was stamped on every. one of the greatvolumes of the original Encyclopedia that the Foundation had begun and notyet finished. The same Spaceship-and-Sun that had blazoned the banner ofthe Galactic Empire through millennia. \\n\\n Mallow talked through and around his thoughts, \"Test that pipe! It\u0027s onepiece. Not perfect; naturally, the joining shouldn\u0027t be done by hand.\"There was no need of further legerdemain. It had gone over. Mallow wasthrough. He had what he wanted. There was only one thing in his mind. Thegolden globe with its conventionalized rays, and the oblique cigar shapethat was a space vessel. \\n\\n The Spaceship-and-Sun of the Empire! \\n\\n The Empire! The words drilled! A century and a half had passed but therewas still the-Empire, somewhere deeper in the Galaxy. And it was emergingagain, out into the Periphery. \\n\\n Mallow smiled! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47248.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
