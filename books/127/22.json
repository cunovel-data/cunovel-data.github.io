{"id":3452,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"When Hardin denied owning the Journal, he was perhaps technically correct,but no more. Hardin had been the leading spirit in the drive to incorporateTerminus into an autonomous municipality-he had been elected its firstmayor-so it was not surprising that, though not a single share of Journalstock was in his name, some sixty percent was controlled by him in moredevious fashions. There were ways. Consequently, when Hardin began suggesting to Pirenne that he be allowed toattend meetings of the Board of Trustees, it was not quite coincidence thatthe Journal began a similar campaign. And the first mass meeting in thehistory of the Foundation was held, demanding representation of the City inthe \"national\" government. And, eventually, Pirenne capitulated with ill grace. Hardin, as he sat at the foot of the table, speculated idly as to just whatit was that made physical scientists such poor administrators. It might bemerely that they were too used to inflexible fact and far too unused topliable people. In any case, there was Tomaz Sutt and Jord Fara on his left; Lundin Crastand Yate Fulham on his fight; with Pirenne, himself, presiding. He knewthem all, of course, but they seemed to have put on an extra-special bit ofpomposity for the occasion. Hardin had dozed through the initial formalities and then perked up whenPirenne sipped at the glass of water before him by way of preparation andsaid: \"I find it very gratifying to be able to inform the Board that since ourlast meeting, I have received word that Lord Dorwin, Chancellor of theEmpire, will arrive at Terminus in two weeks. It may be taken for grantedthat our relations with Anacreon will be smoothed out to our completesatisfaction as soon as the Emperor is informed of the situation. \"He smiled and addressed Hardin across the length of the table. \"Informationto this effect has been given the Journal.\"Hardin snickered below his breath. It seemed evident that Pirenne\u0027s desireto strut this information before him had been one reason for his admissioninto the sacrosanctum. He said evenly: \"Leaving vague expressions out of account, what do youexpect Lord Dorwin to do?\"Tomaz Sutt replied. He had a bad habit of addressing one in the thirdperson when in his more stately moods. \"It is quite evident,\" he observed, \"that Mayor Hardin is a professionalcynic. He can scarcely fail to realize that the Emperor would be mostunlikely to allow his personal rights to be infringed.\"\"Why? What would he do in case they were?\"There was an annoyed stir. Pirenne said, \"You are out of order,\" and, as anafterthought, \"and are making what are near-treasonable statements,besides.\"\"Am I to consider myself answered?\"\"Yes! If you have nothing further to say? \"Don\u0027t jump to conclusions. I\u0027d like to ask a question. Besides this strokeof diplomacy ?which may or may not prove to mean anything ?has anythingconcrete been done to meet the Anacreonic menace?\"Yate Fulham drew one hand along his ferocious red mustache. \"You see amenace there, do you?\"\"Don\u0027t you?\"\"Scarcely\"?this with indulgence. \"The Emperor? \"Great space!\" Hardin felt annoyed. \"What is this? Every once in a whilesomeone mentions \u0027Emperor\u0027 or \u0027Empire\u0027 as if it were a magic word. TheEmperor is thousands of parsecs away, and I doubt whether he gives a damnabout us. And if he does, what can he do? What there was of the imperialnavy in these regions is in the hands of the four kingdoms now and Anacreonhas its share. Listen, we have to fight with guns, not with words. \"Now, get this. We\u0027ve had two months\u0027 grace so far, mainly because we\u0027vegiven Anacreon the idea that we\u0027ve got nuclear weapons. Well, we all knowthat that\u0027s a little white lie. We\u0027ve got nuclear power, but only forcommercial uses, and darn little at that. They\u0027re going to find that outsoon, and if you think they\u0027re going to enjoy being jollied along, you\u0027remistaken.\"\"My dear sir? \"Hold on: I\u0027m not finished.\" Hardin was warming up. He liked this. \"It\u0027sall very well to drag chancellors into this, but it would be much nicer todrag a few great big siege guns fitted for beautiful nuclear bombs into it. We\u0027ve lost two months, gentlemen, and we may not have another two months tolose. What do you propose to do?\"Said Lundin Crast, his long nose wrinkling angrily: \"If you\u0027re proposingthe militarization of the Foundation, I won\u0027t hear a word of it. It wouldmark our open entrance into the field of politics. We, Mr. Mayor, are ascientific foundation and nothing else.\"Added Sutt: \"He does not realize, moreover, that building armaments wouldmean withdrawing men ?valuable men ?from the Encyclopedia. That cannot bedone, come what may.\"\"Very true,\" agreed Pirenne. \"The Encyclopedia first ? always.\"Hardin groaned in spirit. The Board seemed to suffer violently fromEncyclopedia on the brain,He said icily: \"Has it ever occurred to this Board that it is barelypossible that Terminus may have interests other than the Encyclopedia?\"Pirenne replied: \"I do not conceive, Hardin, that the Foundation can haveany interest other than the Encyclopedia.\"\"I didn\u0027t say the Foundation; I said Terminus. I\u0027m afraid you don\u0027tunderstand the situation. There\u0027s a good million of us here on Terminus,and not more than a hundred and fifty thousand are working directly on theEncyclopedia. To the rest of us, this is home. We were born here. We\u0027reliving here. Compared with our farms and our homes and our factories, theEncyclopedia means little to us. We want them protected? He was shouted down. \"The Encyclopedia first,\" ground out Crast. \"We have a mission to fulfill.\"\"Mission, hell,\" shouted Hardin. \"That might have been true fifty yearsago. But this is a new generation.\"\"That has nothing to do with it,\" replied Pirenne. \"We are scientists.\"And Hardin leaped through the opening. \"Are you, though? That\u0027s a nicehallucination, isn\u0027t it? Your bunch here is a perfect example of what\u0027sbeen wrong with the entire Galaxy for thousands of years. What kind ofscience is it to be stuck out here for centuries classifying the work ofscientists of the last millennium? Have you ever thought of working onward,extending their knowledge and improving upon it? No! You\u0027re quite happy tostagnate. The whole Galaxy is, and has been for space knows how long. That\u0027s why the Periphery is revolting; that\u0027s why communications arebreaking down; that\u0027s why petty wars are becoming eternal; that\u0027s why wholesystems are losing nuclear power and going back to barbarous techniques ofchemical power. \"If you ask me,\" he cried, \"the Galactic Empire is dying!\"He paused and dropped into his chair to catch his breath, paying noattention to the two or three that were attempting simultaneously to answerhim. Crast got the floor. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re trying to gain by yourhysterical statements, Mr. Mayor. Certainly, you are adding nothingconstructive to the discussion. I move, Mr. Chairman, that the speaker\u0027sremarks be placed out of order and the discussion be resumed from the pointwhere it was interrupted.\"Jord Fara bestirred himself for the first time. Up to this point Fara hadtaken no part in the argument even at its hottest. But now his ponderousvoice, every bit as ponderous as his three-hundred-pound body, burst itsbass way out. \"Haven\u0027t we forgotten something, gentlemen?\"\"What?\" asked Pirenne, peevishly. \"That in a month we celebrate our fiftieth anniversary.\" Fara had a trickof uttering the most obvious platitudes with great profundity. \"What of it?\"\"And on that anniversary,\" continued Fara, placidly, \"Hari Seldon\u0027s Vaultwill open. Have you ever considered what might be in the Vault?\"\"I don\u0027t know. Routine matters. A stock Speech of congratulations, perhaps. I don\u0027t think any significance need be placed on the Vault ?though theJournal\"?and he glared at Hardin, who grinned back ?did try to make anissue of it. I put a stop to that.\"\"Ah,\" said Fara, \"but perhaps you are wrong. Doesn\u0027t it strike you\" ?hepaused and put a finger to his round little nose ?that the Vault isopening at a very convenient time?\"\"Very inconvenient time, you mean,\" muttered Fulham. \"We\u0027ve got some otherthings to worry about.\"\"Other things more important than a message from Hari Seldon? I think not.\"Fara was growing more pontifical than ever, and Hardin eyed himthoughtfully. What was he getting at? \"In fact,\" said Fara, happily, \"you all seem to forget that Seldon was thegreatest psychologist of our time and that he was the founder of ourFoundation. It seems reasonable to assume that he used his science todetermine the probable course of the history of the immediate future. If hedid, as seems likely, I repeat, he would certainly have managed to find away to warn us of danger and, perhaps, to point out a solution. TheEncyclopedia was very dear to his heart, you know.\"An aura of puzzled doubt prevailed. Pirenne hemmed. \"Well, now, I don\u0027tknow. Psychology is a great science, but-there are no psychologists amongus at the moment, I believe. It seems to me we\u0027re on uncertain ground.\"Fara turned to Hardin. \"Didn\u0027t you study psychology under Alurin?\"Hardin answered, half in reverie: \"Yes, I never completed my studies,though. I got tired of theory. I wanted to be a psychological engineer, butwe lacked the facilities, so I did the next best thing ?I went intopolitics. It\u0027s practically the same thing.\"\"Well, what do you think of the Vault?\"And Hardin replied cautiously, \"I don\u0027t know.\"He did not say a word for the remainder of the meeting even though it gotback to the subject of the Chancellor of the Empire. In fact, he didn\u0027t even listen. He\u0027d been put on a new track and thingswere falling into place-just a little. Little angles were fitting together?one or two. And psychology was the key. He was sure of that. He was trying desperately to remember the psychological theory he had oncelearned ?and from it he got one thing right at the start. A great psychologist such as Seldon could unravel human emotions and humanreactions sufficiently to be able to predict broadly the historical sweepof the future. And what would that mean?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47150.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
