And then Gaal stirred. \n He said: \n \"Was what you told the Commissioner true? Would your execution have reallyhastened the Fall?\"Seldon said, \"I never lie about psychohistoric findings. Nor would it haveavailed me in this case. Chen knew I spoke the truth. He is a very cleverpolitician and politicians by the very nature of their work must have aninstinctive feeling for the truths of psychohistory.\"\"Then need you have accepted exile,\" Gaal wondered, but Seldon did notanswer. \n When they burst out upon the University grounds, Gaal\u0027s muscles took actionof their own; or rather, inaction. He had to be carried, almost, out of thetaxi. \n All the University was a blaze of light. Gaal had almost forgotten that asun could exist. \n The University structures lacked the hard steel-gray of the rest ofTrantor. They were silvery, rather. The metallic luster was almost ivory incolor. \n Seldon said, \"Soldiers, it seems.\"\"What?\" Gaal brought his eyes to the prosaic ground and found a sentinelahead of them. \n They stopped before him, and a soft-spoken captain materialized from anear-by doorway. \n He said, \"Dr. Seldon?\"\"Yes.\"\"We have been waiting for you. You and your men will be under martial lawhenceforth. I have been instructed to inform you that six months will beallowed you for preparations to leave for Terminus.\"\"Six months!\" began Gaal, but Seldon\u0027s fingers were upon his elbow withgentle pressure. \n \"These are my instructions,\" repeated the captain. \n He was gone, and Gaal turned to Seldon, \"Why, what can be done in sixmonths? This is but slower murder.\"\"Quietly. Quietly. Let us reach my office.\"It was not a large office, but it was quite spy-proof and quiteundetectably so. Spy-beams trained upon it received neither a suspicioussilence nor an even more suspicious static. They received, rather, aconversation constructed at random out of a vast stock of innocuous phrasesin various tones and voices. \n \"Now,\" said Seldon, at his ease, \"six months will be enough.\"\"I don\u0027t see how.\"\"Because, my boy, in a plan such as ours, the actions of others are bent toour needs. Have I not said to you already that Chen\u0027s temperamental makeuphas been subjected to greater scrutiny than that of any other single man inhistory. The trial was not allowed to begin until the time andcircumstances were fight for the ending of our own choosing.\"\"But could you have arranged? \n \"杢o be exiled to Terminus? Why not?\" He put his fingers on a certain spoton his desk and a small section of the wall behind him slid aside. Only hisown fingers could have done so, since only his particular print-patterncould have activated the scanner beneath. \n \"You will find several microfilms inside,\" said Seldon. \"Take the onemarked with the letter, T.\"Gaal did so and waited while Seldon fixed it within the projector andhanded the young man a pair of eyepieces. Gaal adjusted them, and watchedthe film unroll before his eyes. \n He said, \"But then? \n Seldon said, \"What surprises you?\"\"Have you been preparing to leave for two years?\"\"Two and a half. Of course, we could not be certain that it would beTerminus he would choose, but we hoped it might be and we acted upon thatassumption? \n \"But why, Dr. Seldon? If you arranged the exile, why? Could not events befar better controlled here on Trantor?\"\"Why, there are some reasons. Working on Terminus, we will have Imperialsupport without ever rousing fears that we would endanger Imperial safety.\"Gaal said, \"But you aroused those fears only to force exile. I still do notunderstand.\"\"Twenty thousand families would not travel to the end of the Galaxy oftheir own will perhaps.\"\"But why should they be forced there?\" Gaal paused, \"May I not know?\"Seldon said, \"Not yet. It is enough for the moment that you know that ascientific refuge will be established on Terminus. And another will beestablished at the other end of the Galaxy, let us say,\" and he smiled, \"atStar\u0027s End. And as for the rest, I will die soon, and you will see morethan I. 朜o, no. Spare me your shock and good wishes. My doctors tell methat I cannot live longer than a year or two. But then, I have accomplishedin life what I have intended and under what circumstances may one betterdie.\"\"And after you die, sir?\"\"Why, there will be successors ?perhaps even yourself. And thesesuccessors will be able to apply the final touch in the scheme andinstigate the revolt on Anacreon at the right time and in the right manner. \n Thereafter, events may roll unheeded.\"\"I do not understand.\"\"You will.\" Seldon\u0027s lined face grew peaceful and tired, both at once,\"Most will leave for Terminus, but some will stay. It will be easy toarrange. 朆ut as for me,\" and he concluded in a whisper, so that Gaal couldscarcely hear him, \"I am finished.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47144.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
