{"id":3440,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"COMMISSION OF PUBLIC SAFETY?.. The aristocratic coterie rose to powerafter the assassination of Cleon I, last of the Entuns. In the main, theyformed an element of order during the centuries of instability anduncertainty in the Imperium. Usually under the control of the greatfamilies of the Chens and the Divarts, it degenerated eventually into ablind instrument for maintenance of the status quo.... They were notcompletely removed as a power in the state until after the accession of thelast strong Emperor, Cleon H. The first Chief Commissioner.... \n ... In a way, the beginning of the Commission\u0027s decline can be traced tothe trial of Hari Seldon two years before the beginning of the FoundationalEra. That trial is described in Gaal Dornick\u0027s biography of Hari Seldon.... \n ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICAGaal did not carry out his promise. He was awakened the next morning by amuted buzzer. He answered it, and the voice of the desk clerk, as muted,polite and deprecating as it well might be, informed him that he was underdetention at the orders of the Commission of Public Safety. \n Gaal sprang to the door and found it would no longer open. He could onlydress and wait. \n They came for him and took him elsewhere, but it was still detention. Theyasked him questions most politely. It was all very civilized. He explainedthat he was a provincial of Synnax; that he had attended such and suchschools and obtained a Doctor of Mathematics degree on such and such adate. He had applied for a position on Dr. Seldon\u0027s staff and had beenaccepted. Over and over again, he gave these details; and over and overagain, they returned to the question of his joining the Seldon Project. Howhad he heard of it; what were to be his duties; what secret instructionshad he received; what was it all about? \n He answered that he did not know. He had no secret instructions. He was ascholar and a mathematician. He had no interest in politics. \n And finally the gentle inquisitor asked, \"When will Trantor be destroyed?\"Gaal faltered, \"I could not say of my own knowledge.\"\"Could you say of anyone\u0027s?\"\"How could I speak for another?\" He felt warm; overwarm. \n The inquisitor said, \"Has anyone told you of such destruction; set a date?\"And, as the young man hesitated, he went on, \"You have been followed,doctor. We were at the airport when you arrived; on the observation towerwhen you waited for your appointment; and, of course, we were able tooverhear your conversation with Dr. Seldon.\"Gaal said, \"Then you know his views on the matter.\"\"Perhaps. But we would like to hear them from you.\"\"He is of the opinion that Trantor would be destroyed within threecenturies.\"\"He proved it, ?uh ?mathematically?\"\"Yes, he did,\" ?defiantly. \n \"You maintain the ? uh ? mathematics to be valid, I suppose. \n \"If Dr. Seldon vouches for it, it is valid.\"\"Then we will return.\"\"Wait. I have a right to a lawyer. I demand my rights as an Imperialcitizen.\"\"You shall have them.\"And he did. \n It was a tall man that eventually entered, a man whose face seemed allvertical lines and so thin that one could wonder whether there was room fora smile. \n Gaal looked up. He felt disheveled and wilted. So much had happened, yet hehad been on Trantor not more than thirty hours. \n The man said, \"I am Lors Avakim. Dr. Seldon has directed me to representyou.\"\"Is that so? Well, then, look here. I demand an instant appeal to theEmperor. I\u0027m being held without cause. I\u0027m innocent of anything. Ofanything.\" He slashed his hands outward, palms down, \"You\u0027ve got to arrangea hearing with the Emperor, instantly.\"Avakim was carefully emptying the contents of a flat folder onto the floor. \n If Gaal had had the stomach for it, he might have recognized Cellomet legalforms, metal thin and tapelike, adapted for insertion within the smallnessof a personal capsule. He might also have recognized a pocket recorder. \n Avakim, paying no attention to Gaal\u0027s outburst, finally looked up. He said,\"The Commission will, of course, have a spy beam on our conversation. Thisis against the law, but they will use one nevertheless.\"Gaal ground his teeth. \n \"However,\" and Avakim seated himself deliberately, \"the recorder I have onthe table, ?which is a perfectly ordinary recorder to all appearances andperforms it duties well ?has the additional property of completelyblanketing the spy beam. This is something they will not find out at once.\"\"Then I can speak.\"\"Of course.\"\"Then I want a hearing with the Emperor.\"Avakim smiled frostily, and it turned out that there was room for it on histhin face after all. His cheeks wrinkled to make the room. He said, \"Youare from the provinces.\"\"I am none the less an Imperial citizen. As good a one as you or as any ofthis Commission of Public Safety.\"\"No doubt; no doubt. It is merely that, as a provincial, you do notunderstand life on Trantor as it is, There are no hearings before theEmperor.\"\"To whom else would one appeal from this Commission? Is there otherprocedure?\"\"None. There is no recourse in a practical sense. Legalistically, you mayappeal to the Emperor, but you would get no hearing. The Emperor today isnot the Emperor of an Entun dynasty, you know. Trantor, I am afraid is inthe hands of the aristocratic families, members of which compose theCommission of Public Safety. This is a development which is well predictedby psychohistory.\"Gaal said, \"Indeed? In that case, if Dr. Seldon can predict the history ofTrantor three hundred years into the future ? \n \"He can predict it fifteen hundred years into the future.\"\"Let it be fifteen thousand. Why couldn\u0027t he yesterday have predicted theevents of this morning and warned me. 朜o, I\u0027m sorry.\" Gaal sat down andrested his head in one sweating palm, \"I quite understand thatpsychohistory is a statistical science and cannot predict the future of asingle man with any accuracy. You\u0027ll understand that I\u0027m upset.\"\"But you are wrong. Dr. Seldon was of the opinion that you would bearrested this morning.\"\"What!\"\"It is unfortunate, but true. The Commission has been more and more hostileto his activities. New members joining the group have been interfered withto an increasing extent. The graphs showed that for our purposes, mattersmight best be brought to a climax now. The Commission of itself was movingsomewhat slowly so Dr. Seldon visited you yesterday for the purpose offorcing their hand. No other reason.\"Gaal caught his breath, \"I resent ? \n \"Please. It was necessary. You were not picked for any personal reasons. \n You must realize that Dr. Seldon\u0027s plans, which are laid out with thedeveloped mathematics of over eighteen years include all eventualities withsignificant probabilities. This is one of them. I\u0027ve been sent here for noother purpose than to assure you that you need not fear. It will end well;almost certainly so for the project; and with reasonable probability foryou.\"\"What are the figures?\" demanded Gaal. \n \"For the project, over 99.9%.\"\"And for myself?\"\"I am instructed that this probability is 77.2%.\"\"Then I\u0027ve got better than one chance in five of being sentenced to prisonor to death.\"\"The last is under one per cent.\"\"Indeed. Calculations upon one man mean nothing. You send Dr. Seldon tome.\"\"Unfortunately, I cannot. Dr. Seldon is himself arrested.\"The door was thrown open before the rising Gaal could do more than utterthe beginning of a cry. A guard entered, walked to the table, picked up therecorder, looked upon all sides of it and put it in his pocket. \n Avakim said quietly, \"I will need that instrument.\"\"We will supply you with one, Counsellor, that does not cast a staticfield.\"\"My interview is done, in that case.\"Gaal watched him leave and was alone. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47138.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
