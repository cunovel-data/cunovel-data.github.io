{"id":3450,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"Anselm haut Rodric ?\"haut\" itself signifying noble blood -Sub-prefect ofPluema and Envoy Extraordinary of his Highness of Anacreon-plus half adozen other titleswas met by Salvor Hardin at the spaceport with all theimposing ritual of a state occasion. \n With a tight smile and a low bow, the sub-prefect had flipped his blasterfrom its holster and presented it to Hardin butt first. Hardin returned thecompliment with, a blaster specifically borrowed for the occasion. \n Friendship and good will were thus established, and if Hardin noted thebarest bulge at Haut Rodric\u0027s shoulder, he prudently said nothing. \n The ground car that received them then ?preceded, flanked, and followed bythe suitable cloud of minor functionaries ? proceeded in a slow,ceremonious manner to Cyclopedia Square, cheered on its way by a properlyenthusiastic crowd. \n Sub-prefect Anselm received the cheers with the complaisant indifference ofa soldier and a nobleman. \n He said to Hardin, \"And this city is all your world?\"Hardin raised his voice to be heard above the clamor. \"We are a youngworld, your eminence. In our short history we have had but few members ofthe higher nobility visiting our poor planet. Hence, our enthusiasm.\"It is certain that \"higher nobility\" did not recognize irony when he heardit. \n He said thoughtfully: \"Founded fifty years ago. Hm-mmm! You have a greatdeal of unexploited land here, mayor. You have never considered dividing itinto estates?\"\"There is no necessity as yet. We\u0027re extremely centralized; we have to be,because of the Encyclopedia. Someday, perhaps, when our population hasgrown? \n \"A strange world! You have no peasantry?\"Hardin reflected that it didn\u0027t require a great deal of acumen to tell thathis eminence was indulging in a bit of fairly clumsy pumping. He repliedcasually, \"No ?nor nobility.\"Haut Rodric\u0027s eyebrows lifted. \"And your leader ?the man I am to meet?\"\"You mean Dr. Pirenne? Yes! He is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees ? \n and a personal representative of the Emperor.\"\"Doctor? No other title? A scholar? And he rates above the civilauthority?\"\"Why, certainly,\" replied Hardin, amiably. \"We\u0027re all scholars more orless. After all, we\u0027re not so much a world as a scientific foundation ? \n under the direct control of the Emperor.\"There was a faint emphasis upon the last phrase that seemed to disconcertthe sub-prefect. He remained thoughtfully silent during the rest of theslow way to Cyclopedia Square. \n If Hardin found himself bored by the afternoon and evening that followed,he had at least the satisfaction of realizing that Pirenne and Haut Rodric?having met with loud and mutual protestations of esteem and regard ?weredetesting each other\u0027s company a good deal more. \n Haut Rodric had attended with glazed eye to Pirenne\u0027s lecture during the\"inspection tour\" of the Encyclopedia Building. With polite and vacantsmile, he had listened to the latter\u0027s rapid patter as they passed throughthe vast storehouses of reference films and the numerous projection rooms. \n It was only after he had gone down level by level into and through thecomposing departments, editing departments, publishing departments, andfilming departments that he made the first comprehensive statement. \n \"This is all very interesting,\" he said, \"but it seems a strange occupationfor grown men. What good is it?\"It was a remark, Hardin noted, for which Pirenne found no answer, thoughthe expression of his face was most eloquent. \n The dinner that evening was much the mirror image of the events of thatafternoon, for Haut Rodric monopolized the conversation by describing ?inminute technical detail and with incredible zest ?his own exploits asbattalion head during the recent war between Anacreon and the neighboringnewly proclaimed Kingdom of Smyrno. \n The details of the sub-prefect\u0027s account were not completed until dinnerwas over and one by one the minor officials had drifted away. The last bitof triumphant description of mangled spaceships came when he hadaccompanied Pirenne and Hardin onto the balcony and relaxed in the warm airof the summer evening. \n \"And now,\" he said, with a heavy joviality, \"to serious matters.\"\"By all means,\" murmured Hardin, lighting a long cigar of Vegan tobacco ? \n not many left, he reflected ?and teetering his chair back on two legs. \n The Galaxy was high in the sky and its misty lens shape stretched lazilyfrom horizon to horizon. The few stars here at the very edge of theuniverse were insignificant twinkles in comparison. \n \"Of course,\" said the sub-prefect, \"all the formal discussions ?the papersigning and such dull technicalities, that is ?will take place before the?What is it you call your Council?\"\"The Board of Trustees,\" replied Pirenne, coldly. \n \"Queer name! Anyway, that\u0027s for tomorrow. We might as well clear away someof the underbrush, man to man, right now, though. Hey?\"\"And this means? prodded Hardin. \n \"Just this. There\u0027s been a certain change in the situation out here in thePeriphery and the status of your planet has become a trifle uncertain. Itwould be very convenient if we succeeded in coming to an understanding asto how the matter stands. By the way, mayor, have you another one of thosecigars?\"Hardin started and produced one reluctantly. \n Anselm haut Rodric sniffed at it and emitted a clucking sound of pleasure. \n \"Vegan tobacco! Where did you get it?\"\"We received some last shipment. There\u0027s hardly any left. Space knows whenwe\u0027ll get more ?if ever.\"Pirenne scowled. He didn\u0027t smoke ?and, for that matter, detested the odor. \n \"Let me understand this, your eminence. Your mission is merely one ofclarification?\"Haut Rodric nodded through the smoke of his first lusty puffs. \n \"In that case, it is soon over. The situation with respect to theEncyclopedia Foundation is what it always has been.\"\"Ah! And what is it that it always has been?\"\"Just this: A State-supported scientific institution and part of thepersonal domain of his august majesty, the Emperor.\"The sub-prefect seemed unimpressed. He blew smoke rings. \"That\u0027s a nicetheory, Dr. Pirenne. I imagine you\u0027ve got charters with the Imperial Sealupon it ?but what\u0027s the actual situation? How do you stand with respect toSmyrno? You\u0027re not fifty parsecs from Smyrno\u0027s capital. you know. And whatabout Konom and Daribow?\"Pirenne said: \"We have nothing to do with any prefect. As part of theEmperor\u0027s? \n \"They\u0027re not prefects,\" reminded Haut Rodric; \"they\u0027re kingdoms now.\"\"Kingdoms then. We have nothing to do with them. As a scientificinstitution? \n \"Science be damned!\" swore the other. \"What the devil has that got to dowith the fact that we\u0027re liable to see Terminus taken over by Smyrno at anytime?\"\"And the Emperor? He would just sit by?\"Haut Rodric calmed down and said: \"Well, now, Dr. Pirenne, you respect theEmperor\u0027s property and so does Anacreon, but Smyrno might not. Remember,we\u0027ve just signed a treaty with the Emperor ?I\u0027ll present a copy to thatBoard of yours tomorrow ?which places upon us the responsibility ofmaintaining order within the borders of the old Prefect of Anacreon onbehalf of the Emperor. Our duty is clear, then, isn\u0027t it?\"\"Certainly. But Terminus is not part of the Prefect of Anacreon.\"\"And Smyrno? \n \"Nor is it part of the Prefect of Smyrno. It\u0027s not part of any prefect.\"\"Does Smyrno know that?\"\"I don\u0027t care what it knows.\"\"We do. We\u0027ve just finished a war with her and she still holds two stellarsystems that are ours. Terminus occupies an extremely strategic spot,between the two nations.\"Hardin felt weary. He broke in: \"What is your proposition, your eminence?\"The sub-prefect seemed quite ready to stop fencing in favor of more directstatements. He said briskly: \"It seems perfectly obvious that, sinceTerminus cannot defend itself, Anacreon must take over the job for its ownsake. You understand we have no desire to interfere with internaladministration? \n \"Uh-huh,\" grunted Hardin dryly. \n \"朾ut we believe that it would be best for all concerned to have Anacreonestablish a military base upon the planet.\"\"And that is all you would want ?a military base in some of the vastunoccupied territory ?and let it go at that?\"\"Well, of course, there would be the matter of supporting the protectingforces.\"Hardin\u0027s chair came down on all four, and his elbows went forward on hisknees. \"Now we\u0027re getting to the nub. Let\u0027s put it into language. Terminusis to be a protectorate and to pay tribute.\"\"Not tribute. Taxes. We\u0027re protecting you. You pay for it.\"Pirenne banged his hand on the chair with sudden violence. \"Let me speak,Hardin. Your eminence, I don\u0027t care a rusty half-credit coin for Anacreon,Smyrno, or all your local politics and petty wars. I tell you this is aState-supported tax-free institution.\"\"State-supported? But we are the State, Dr. Pirenne, and we\u0027re notsupporting.\"Pirenne rose angrily. \"Your eminence, I am the direct representative of? \n \"杊is august majesty, the Emperor,\" chorused Anselm haut Rodric sourly,\"And I am the direct representative of the King of Anacreon. Anacreon is alot nearer, Dr. Pirenne. \"\"Let\u0027s get back to business,\" urged Hardin. \"How would you take theseso-called taxes, your eminence? Would you take them in kind: wheat,potatoes, vegetables, cattle?\"The sub-prefect stared. \"What the devil? What do we need with those? We\u0027vegot hefty surpluses. Gold, of course. Chromium or vanadium would be evenbetter, incidentally, if you have it in quantity.\"Hardin laughed. \"Quantity! We haven\u0027t even got iron in quantity. Gold! \n Here, take a look at our currency.\" He tossed a coin to the envoy. \n Haut Rodric bounced it and stared. \"What is it? Steel?\"\"That\u0027s right.\"\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\"Terminus is a planet practically without metals. We import it all. \n Consequently, we have no gold, and nothing to pay unless you want a fewthousand bushels of potatoes.\"\"Well ?manufactured goods.\"\"Without metal? What do we make our machines out of?\"There was a pause and Pirenne tried again. \"This whole discussion is wideof the point. Terminus is not a planet, but a scientific foundationpreparing a great encyclopedia. Space, man, have you no respect forscience?\"\"Encyclopedias don\u0027t win wars.\" Haut Rodric\u0027s brows furrowed. \"A completelyunproductive world, then ? and practically unoccupied at that. Well, youmight pay with land.\"\"What do you mean?\" asked Pirenne. \n \"This world is just about empty and the unoccupied land is probablyfertile. There are many of the nobility on Anacreon that would like anaddition to their estates.\"\"You can\u0027t propose any such? \n \"There\u0027s no necessity of looking so alarmed, Dr. Pirenne. There\u0027s plentyfor all of us. If it comes to what it comes, and you co-operate, we couldprobably arrange it so that you lose nothing. Titles can be conferred andestates granted. You understand me, I think.\"Pirenne sneered, \"Thanks!\"And then Hardin said ingenuously: \"Could Anacreon supply us with adequatequantities of plutonium for our nuclear-power plant? We\u0027ve only a fewyears\u0027 supply left.\"There was a gasp from Pirenne and then a dead silence for minutes. WhenHaut Rodric spoke it was in a voice quite different from what it had beentill then: \n \"You have nuclear power?\"\"Certainly. What\u0027s unusual in that? I imagine nuclear power is fiftythousand years old now. Why shouldn\u0027t we have it? Except that it\u0027s a littledifficult to get plutonium.\"\"Yes ... Yes.\" The envoy paused and added uncomfortably: \"Well, gentlemen,we\u0027ll pursue the subject tomorrow. You\u0027ll excuse me? \n Pirenne looked after him and gritted through his teeth: \"That insufferable,dull-witted donkey! That? \n Hardin broke in: \"Not at all. He\u0027s merely the product of his environment. \n He doesn\u0027t understand much except that \u0027I have a gun and you haven\u0027t.? \n Pirenne whirled on him in exasperation. \"What in space did you mean by thetalk about military bases and tribute? Are you crazy?\"\"No. I merely gave him rope and let him talk. You\u0027ll notice that he managedto stumble out with Anacreon\u0027s real intentions ?that is, the parceling upof Terminus into landed estates. Of course, I don\u0027t intend to let thathappen.\"\"You don\u0027t intend. You don\u0027t. And who are you? And may I ask what you meantby blowing off your mouth about our nuclear-power plant? Why, it\u0027s just thething that would make us a military target.\"\"Yes,\" grinned Hardin. \"A military target to stay away from. Isn\u0027t itobvious why I brought the subject up? It happened to confirm a very strongsuspicion I had had.\"\"And that was what?\"\"That Anacreon no longer has a nuclear-power economy. If they had, ourfriend would undoubtedly have realized that plutonium, except in ancienttradition is not used in power plants. And therefore it follows that therest of the Periphery no longer has nuclear power either. Certainly Smyrnohasn\u0027t, or Anacreon wouldn\u0027t have won most of the battles in their recentwar. Interesting, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\"Bah!\" Pirenne left in fiendish humor, and Hardin smiled gently. \n He threw his cigar away and looked up at the outstretched Galaxy. \"Back tooil and coal, are they?\" he murmured ?and what the rest of his thoughtswere he kept to himself. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47148.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
