{"id":3498,"no":68,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"Korell is that frequent phenomenon in history: the republic whose ruler hasevery attribute of the absolute monarch but the name. It therefore enjoyedthe usual despotism unrestrained even by those two moderating influences inthe legitimate monarchies: regal \"honor\" and court etiquette. \\n\\n Materially, its prosperity was low. The day of the Galactic Empire haddeparted, with nothing but silent memorials and broken structures totestify to it. The day of the Foundation had not yet come ? and in thefierce determination of its ruler, the Commdor Asper Argo, with his strictregulation of the traders and his stricter prohibition of the missionaries,it was never coming. \\n\\n The spaceport itself was decrepit and decayed, and the crew of the Far Starwere drearily aware of that. The moldering hangars made for a molderingatmosphere and Jaim Twer itched and fretted over a game of solitaire. \\n\\n Hober Mallow said thoughtfully, \"Good trading material here.\" He wasstaring quietly out the viewport. So far, there was little else to be saidabout Korell. The trip here was uneventful. The squadron of Korellian shipsthat had shot out to intercept the Far Star had been tiny, limping relicsof ancient glory or battered, clumsy hulks. They had maintained theirdistance fearfully, and still maintained it, and for a week now, Mallow\u0027srequests for an audience with the local go government had been unanswered. \\n\\n Mallow repeated, \"Good trading here. You might call this virgin territory.\"Jaim Twer looked up impatiently, and threw his cards aside, \"What the devildo you intend doing, Mallow? The crew\u0027s grumbling, the officers areworried, and I抦 wondering? \\n\\n \"Wondering? About what?\"\"About the situation. And about you. What are we doing?\"\"Waiting.\"The old trader snorted and grew red. He growled, \"You\u0027re going it blind,Mallow. There\u0027s a guard around the field and there are ships overhead. \\n\\n Suppose they\u0027re getting ready to blow us into a hole in the ground.\"\"They\u0027ve had a week.\"\"Maybe they\u0027re waiting for reinforcements.\" Twer\u0027s eyes were sharp andhard. \\n\\n Mallow sat down abruptly, \"Yes, I\u0027d thought of that You see, it poses apretty problem. First, we got here without trouble. That may mean nothing,however, for only three ships out of better than three hundred wenta-glimmer last year. The percentage is low. But that may mean also that thenumber of their ships equipped with nuclear power is small, and that theydare not expose them needlessly, until that number grows. \\n\\n \"But it could mean, on the other hand, that they haven\u0027t nuclear powerafter all. Or maybe they have and are keeping undercover, for fear we knowsomething. It\u0027s one thing, after all, to piratize blundering, light-armedmerchant ships. It\u0027s another to fool around with an accredited envoy of theFoundation when the mere fact of his presence may mean the Foundation isgrowing suspicious. \\n\\n \"Combine this? \\n\\n \"Hold on, Mallow, hold on.\" Twer raised his hands. \"You\u0027re just aboutdrowning me with talk. What\u0027re you getting at? Never mind the in-betweens.\"\"You\u0027ve got to have the in-betweens, or you won\u0027t understand, Twer. We\u0027reboth waiting. They don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing here and I don\u0027t know whatthey\u0027ve got here. But I\u0027m in the weaker position because I\u0027m one andthey\u0027re an entire world ?maybe with atomic power. I can\u0027t afford to be theone to weaken. Sure it\u0027s dangerous. Sure there may be a hole in the groundwaiting for us. But we knew that from the start. What else is there to do?\"\"I don\u0027t?Who\u0027s that, now?\"Mallow looked up patiently, and tuned the receiver. The visiplate glowedinto the craggy face of the watch sergeant. \\n\\n \"Speak, sergeant.\"The sergeant said, \"Pardon, sir. The men have given entry to a Foundationmissionary.\"\"A what?\" Mallow\u0027s face grew livid. \\n\\n \"A missionary, sit. He\u0027s in need of hospitalization, sir-\"\"There\u0027ll be more than one in need of that, sergeant, for this piece ofwork. Order the men to battle stations.\"Crew\u0027s lounge was almost empty. Five minutes after the order, even the menon the off-shift were at their guns. It was speed that was the great virtuein the anarchic regions of the interstellar space of the Periphery, and itwas in speed above all that the crew of a master trader excelled. \\n\\n Mallow entered slowly, and stared the missionary up and down and around. \\n\\n His eye slid to Lieutenant Tinter, who shifted uneasily to one side and toWatch-Sergeant Demen, whose blank face and stolid figure flanked the other. \\n\\n The Master Trader turned to Twer and paused thoughtfully, \"Well, then,Twer, get the officers here quietly, except for the co-ordinators and thetrajectorian. The men are to remain at stations till further orders.\"There was a five-minute hiatus, in which Mallow kicked open the doors tothe lavatories, looked behind the bar, pulled the draperies across thethick windows. For half a minute he left the room altogether, and when hereturned he was humming abstractedly. \\n\\n Men filed in. Twer followed, and closed the door silently. \\n\\n Mallow said quietly, \"First, who let this man in without orders from me?\"The watch sergeant stepped forward. Every eye shifted. \"Pardon, sir. It wasno definite person. It was a sort of mutual agreement. He was one of us,you might say, and these foreigners here? \\n\\n Mallow cut him short, \"I sympathize with your feelings, sergeant, andunderstand them. These men, were they under your command?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"When this is over, they\u0027re to be confined to individual quarters for aweek. You yourself are relieved of all supervisory duties for a similarperiod. Understood?\"The sergeant\u0027s face never changed, but there was the slightest droop to hisshoulders. He said, crisply, \"Yes, sir.\"\"You may leave. Get to your gun-station.\"The door closed behind him and the babble rose. \\n\\n Twer broke in, \"Why the punishment, Mallow? You know that these Korellianskill captured missionaries.\"\"An action against my orders is bad in itself whatever other reasons theremay be in its favor. No one was to leave or enter the ship withoutpermission.\"Lieutenant Tinter murmured rebelliously, \"Seven days without action. Youcan\u0027t maintain discipline that way.\"Mallow said icily, \"I can. There\u0027s no merit in discipline under idealcircumstances. I\u0027ll have it in the face of death, or it\u0027s useless. Where\u0027sthis missionary? Get him here in front of me.\"The trader sat down, while the scarlet-cloaked figure was carefully broughtforward. \\n\\n \"What\u0027s your name, reverend?\"\"Eh?\" The scarlet-robed figure wheeled towards Mallow, the whole bodyturning as a unit. His eyes were blankly open and there was a bruise on onetemple. He had not spoken, nor, as far as Mallow could tell, moved duringall the previous interval. \\n\\n \"Your name, revered one?\"The missionary started to sudden feverish life. His arms went out in anembracing gesture. \"My son ? my children. May you always be in theprotecting arms of the Galactic Spirit.\"Twer stepped forward, eyes troubled, voice husky, \"The man\u0027s sick. Take himto bed, somebody. Order him to bed, Mallow, and have him seen to. He\u0027sbadly hurt.\"Mallow\u0027s great arm shoved him back, \"Don\u0027t interfere, Twer, or I\u0027ll haveyou out of the room. Your name, revered one?\"The missionary\u0027s hands clasped in sudden supplication, \"As you areenlightened men, save me from the heathen.\" The words tumbled out, \"Save mefrom these brutes and darkened ones who raven after me and would afflictthe Galactic Spirit with their crimes. I am Jord Parma, of the Anacreonianworlds. Educated at the Foundation; the Foundation itself, my children. Iam a Priest of the Spirit educated into all the mysteries, who have comehere where the inner voice called me.\" He was gasping. \"I have suffered atthe hands of the unenlightened. As you are Children of the Spirit; and inthe name of that Spirit, protect me from them.\"A voice broke in upon them, as the emergency alarm box clamoredmetallically: \\n\\n \"Enemy units in sight! Instruction desired!\"Every eye shot mechanically upward to the speaker. \\n\\n Mallow swore violently. He clicked open the reverse and yelled, \"Maintainvigil! That is all!\" and turned it off. \\n\\n He made his way to the thick drapes that rustled aside at a touch andstared grimly out,Enemy units! Several thousands of them in the persons of the individualmembers of a Korellian mob. The rolling rabble encompassed the port fromextreme end to extreme end, and in the cold, hard light of magnesium flaresthe foremost straggled closer. \\n\\n \"Tinter!\" The trader never turned, but the back of his neck was red. \"Getthe outer speaker working and find out what they want. Ask if they have arepresentative of the law with them. Make no promises and no threats, orI\u0027ll kill you.\"Tinter turned and left. \\n\\n Mallow felt a rough hand on his shoulder and he struck it aside. It wasTwer. His voice was an angry hiss in his ear, \"Mallow, you\u0027re bound to holdonto this man. There\u0027s no way of maintaining decency and honor otherwise. \\n\\n He\u0027s of the Foundation and, after all, he ? is a priest. These savagesoutside?Do you hear me?\"\"I hear you, Twer.\" Mallow\u0027s voice was incisive. \"I\u0027ve got more to do herethan guard missionaries. I\u0027ll do, sir, what I please, and, by Seldon andall the Galaxy, if you try to stop me, I\u0027ll tear out your stinkingwindpipe. Don\u0027t get in my way, Twer, or it will be the last of you.\"He turned and strode past. \"You! Revered Parma! Did you know that, byconvention, no Foundation missionaries may enter the Korellian territory?\"The missionary was trembling, \"I can but go where the Spirit leads, my son. \\n\\n If the darkened ones refuse enlightenment, is it not the greater sign oftheir need for it?\"\"That\u0027s outside the question, revered one. You are here against the law ofboth Korell and the Foundation. I cannot in law protect you.\"The missionary\u0027s hands were raised again. His earlier bewilderment wasgone. There was the raucous clamor of the ship\u0027s outer communication systemin action, and the faint, undulating gabble of the angry horde in response. \\n\\n The sound made his eyes wild. \\n\\n \"You hear them? Why do you talk of law to me, of a law made by men? Thereare higher laws. Was it not the Galactic Spirit that said: Thou shalt notstand idly by to the hurl of thy fellowman. And has he not said: Even asthou dealest with the humble and defenseless, thus shalt thou be dealtwith. \\n\\n \"Have you not guns? Have you not a ship? And behind you is there not theFoundation? And above and all-about you is there not the Spirit that rulesthe universe?\" He paused for breath. \\n\\n And then the great outer voice of the Far Star ceased and Lieutenant Tinterwas back, troubled. \\n\\n \"Speak!\" said Mallow, shortly. \\n\\n \"Sir, they demand the person of Jord Parma.\"\"If not?\"\"There are various threats, sir. It is difficult to make much out. Thereare so many ?and they seem quite mad. There is someone who says he governsthe district and has police powers, but he is quite evidently not his ownmaster.\"\"Master or not,\" shrugged Mallow, \"he is the law. Tell them that if thisgovernor, or policeman, or whatever he is, approaches the ship alone, hecan have the Revered Jord Parma.\"And there was suddenly a gun in his hand. He added, \"I don\u0027t know whatinsubordination is. I have never had any experience with it. But if there\u0027sanyone here who thinks he can teach me, I\u0027d like to teach him my antidotein return.\u0027\u0027 \\n\\n The gun swiveled slowly, and rested on Twer. With an effort, the oldtrader\u0027s face untwisted and his hands unclenched and lowered. His breathwas a harsh rasp in his nostrils. \\n\\n Tinter left, and in five minutes a puny figure detached itself from thecrowd. It approached slowly and hesitantly, plainly drenched in fear andapprehension. Twice it turned back, and twice the patently obvious threatsof the many-headed monster urged him on. \\n\\n \"All right,\" Mallow gestured with the hand-blaster, which remainedunsheathed. \"Grun and Upshur, take him out.\"The missionary screeched. He raised his arms and rigid fingers spearedupward as the voluminous sleeves fell away to reveal the thin, veined arms. \\n\\n There was a momentary, tiny flash of light that came and went in a breath. \\n\\n Mallow blinked and gestured again, contemptuously. \\n\\n The missionary\u0027s voice poured out as he struggled in the two-fold grasp,\"Cursed be the traitor who abandons his fellowman to evil and to death. \\n\\n Deafened be the ears that are deaf to the pleadings of the helpless. Blindbe the eyes that are blind to innocence. Blackened forever be the soul thatconsorts with blackness? \\n\\n Twer clamped his hands tightly over his ears. \\n\\n Mallow flipped his blaster and put it away. \"Disperse,\" he said, evenly,\"to respective stations. Maintain full vigil for six hours after dispersionof crowd. Double stations for forty-eight hours thereafter. Furtherinstructions at that time. Twer, come with me.\"They were alone in Mallow\u0027s private quarters. Mallow indicated a chair andTwer sat down. His stocky figure looked shrunken. \\n\\n Mallow stared him down, sardonically. \"Twer,\" he said, \"I\u0027m disappointed. \\n\\n Your three years in politics seem to have gotten you out of trader habits. \\n\\n Remember, I may be a democrat back at the Foundation, but there\u0027s nothingshort of tyranny that can run my ship the way I want it run. I never had topull a blaster on my men before, and I wouldn\u0027t have had to now, if youhadn\u0027t gone out of line. \\n\\n \"Twer, you have no official position, but you\u0027re here on my invitation, andI\u0027ll extend you every courtesy ?in private. However, from now on, in thepresence of my officers or men, I\u0027m \u0027sir,\u0027 and not \u0027Mallow.\u0027 And when Igive an order, you\u0027ll jump faster than a third-class recruit just for luck,or I\u0027ll have you handcuffed in the sub-level even faster. Understand?\"The party-leader swallowed dryly. He said, reluctantly, \"My apologies.\"\"Accepted! Will you shake?\"Twer\u0027s limp fingers were swallowed in Mallow\u0027s huge palm. Twer said, \"Mymotives were good. It\u0027s difficult to send a man out to be lynched. Thatwobbly-kneed governor or whatever-he-was can\u0027t save him. It\u0027s murder.\"\"I can\u0027t help that. Frankly, the incident smelled too bad. Didn\u0027t younotice?\"\"Notice what?\"\"This spaceport is deep in the middle of a sleepy far section. Suddenly amissionary escapes. Where from? He comes here. Coincidence? A huge crowdgathers. From where? The nearest city of any size must be at least ahundred miles away. But they arrive in half an hour. How?\"\"How?\" echoed Twer. \\n\\n \"Well, what if the missionary were brought here and released as bait. Ourfriend, Revered Parma, was considerably confused. He seemed at no time tobe in complete possession of his wits.\"\"Hard usage? murmured Twer bitterly. \\n\\n \"Maybe! And maybe the idea was to have us go all chivalrous and gallant,into a stupid defense of the man. He was here against the laws of Korelland the Foundation. If I withhold him, it is an act of war against Korell,and the Foundation would have no legal right to defend us.\"\"That ?that\u0027s pretty far-fetched.\"The speaker blared and forestalled Mallow\u0027s answer: \"Sir, officialcommunication received.\"\"Submit immediately!\"The gleaming cylinder arrived in its slot with a click. Mallow opened itand shook out the silver-impregnated sheet it held. He rubbed itappreciatively between thumb and finger and said, \"Teleported direct fromthe capital. Commdor\u0027s own stationery.\"He read it in a glance and laughed shortly, \"So my idea was far-fetched,was it?\"He tossed it to Twer, and added, \"Half an hour after we hand back themissionary, we finally get a very polite invitation to the Commdor\u0027s augustpresence ?after seven days of previous waiting. I think we passed a test.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47240.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
