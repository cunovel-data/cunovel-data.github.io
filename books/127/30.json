{"id":3460,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"The Vault was furnished with considerably more than six chairs, as though alarger company had been expected. Hardin noted that thoughtfully and seatedhimself wearily in a comer just as far from the other five as possible. The Board members did not seem to object to that arrangement. They spokeamong themselves in whispers, which fell off into sibilant monosyllables,and then into nothing at all. Of them all, only Jord Fara seemed evenreasonably calm. He had produced a watch and was staring at it somberly. Hardin glanced at his own watch and then at the glass cubicle ?absolutelyempty ? that dominated half the room. It was the only unusual feature ofthe room, for aside from that there was no indication that somewhere acomputer was splitting off instants of time toward that precise moment whena muon stream would flow, a connection be made and? The lights went dim! They didn\u0027t go out, but merely yellowed and sank with a suddenness thatmade Hardin jump. He had lifted his eyes to the ceiling lights in startledfashion, and when he brought them down the glass cubicle was no longerempty. A figure occupied it ?a figure in a wheel chair! It said nothing for a few moments, but it closed the book upon its lap andfingered it idly. And then it smiled, and the face seemed all alive. It said, \"I am Hari Seldon.\" The voice was old and soft. Hardin almost rose to acknowledge the introduction and stopped himself inthe act. The voice continued conversationally: \"As you see, I am confined to thischair and cannot rise to greet you. Your grandparents left for Terminus afew months back in my time and since then I have suffered a ratherinconvenient paralysis. I can\u0027t see you, you know, so I can\u0027t greet youproperly. I don\u0027t even know how many of you there are, so all this must beconducted informally. If any of you are standing, please sit down; and ifyou care to smoke, I wouldn\u0027t mind.\" There was a light chuckle. \"Why shouldI? I\u0027m not really here.\"Hardin fumbled for a cigar almost automatically, but thought better of it. Hari Seldon put away his book ?as if laying it upon a desk at his side ? and when his fingers let go, it disappeared. He said: \"It is fifty years now since this Foundation was established ? fifty years in which the members of the Foundation have been ignorant ofwhat it was they were working toward. It was necessary that they beignorant, but now the necessity is gone. \"The Encyclopedia Foundation, to begin with, is a fraud, and always hasbeen!\"There was a sound of a scramble behind Hardin and one or two muffledexclamations, but he did not turn around. Hari Seldon was, of course, undisturbed. He went on: \"It is a fraud in thesense that neither I nor my colleagues care at all whether a single volumeof the Encyclopedia is ever published. It has served its purpose, since byit we extracted an imperial charter from the Emperor, by it we attractedthe hundred thousand humans necessary for our scheme, and by it we managedto keep them preoccupied while events shaped themselves, until it was toolate for any of them to draw back. \"In the fifty years that you have worked on this fraudulent project ?thereis no use in softening phrases ?your retreat has been cut off, and youhave now no choice but to proceed on the infinitely more important projectthat was, and is, our real plan. \"To that end we have placed you on such a planet and at such a time that infifty years you were maneuvered to the point where you no longer havefreedom of action. From now on, and into the centuries, the path you musttake is inevitable. You will be faced with a series of crises, as you arenow faced with the first, and in each case your freedom of action willbecome similarly circumscribed so that you will be forced along one, andonly one, path. \"It is that path which our psychology has worked out ?and for a reason. \"For centuries Galactic civilization has stagnated and declined, thoughonly a few ever realized that. But now, at last, the Periphery is breakingaway and the political unity of the Empire is shattered. Somewhere in thefifty years just past is where the historians of the future will place anarbitrary line and say: \u0027This marks the Fall of the Galactic Empire.\u0027 \"And they will be right, though scarcely any will recognize that Fall foradditional centuries. \"And after the Fall will come inevitable barbarism, a period which, ourpsychohistory tells us, should, under ordinary circumstances, last forthirty thousand years. We cannot stop the Fall. We do not wish to; forImperial culture has lost whatever virility and worth it once had. But wecan shorten the period of Barbarism that must follow ?down to a singlethousand of years. \"The ins and outs of that shortening, we cannot tell you; just as we couldnot tell you the truth about the Foundation fifty years ago. Were you todiscover those ins and outs, our plan might fail; as it would have, had youpenetrated the fraud of the Encyclopedia earlier; for then, by knowledge,your freedom of action would be expanded and the number of additionalvariables introduced would become greater than our psychology could handle. \"But you won\u0027t, for there are no psychologists on Terminus, and never were,but for Alurin ?and he was one of us. \"But this I can tell you: Terminus and its companion Foundation at theother end of the Galaxy are the seeds of the Renascence and the futurefounders of the Second Galactic Empire. And it is the present crisis thatis starting Terminus off to that climax. \"This, by the way, is a rather straightforward crisis, much simpler thanmany of those that are ahead. To reduce it to its fundamentals, it is this: You are a planet suddenly cut off from the still-civilized centers of theGalaxy, and threatened by your stronger neighbors. You are a small world ofscientists surrounded by vast and rapidly expanding reaches of barbarism. You are an island of nuclear power in a growing ocean of more primitiveenergy; but are helpless despite that, because of your lack of metals. \"You see, then, that you are faced by hard necessity, and that action isforced on you. The nature of that action ?that is, the solution to yourdilemma ?is, of course, obvious!\"The image of Hari Seldon reached into open air and the book once moreappeared in his hand. He opened it and said: \"But whatever devious course your future history may take, impress italways upon your descendants that the path has been marked out, and that atits end is new and greater Empire!\"And as his eyes bent to his book, he flicked into nothingness, and thelights brightened once more. Hardin looked up to see Pirenne facing him, eyes tragic and lips trembling. The chairman\u0027s voice was firm but toneless. \"You were right, it seems. Ifyou will see us tonight at six, the Board will consult with you as to thenext move.\"They shook his hand, each one, and left, and Hardin smiled to himself. Theywere fundamentally sound at that; for they were scientists enough to admitthat they were wrong ?but for them, it was too late. He looked at his watch. By this time, it was all over. Lee\u0027s men were incontrol and the Board was giving orders no longer. The Anacreonians were landing their first spaceships tomorrow, but that wasall right, too. In six months, they would be giving orders no longer. In fact, as Hari Seldon had said, and as Salvor Hardin had guessed sincethe day that Anselm haut Rodric had first revealed to him Anacreon\u0027s lackof nuclear power ? the solution to this first crisis was obvious. Obvious as all hell!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47158.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
