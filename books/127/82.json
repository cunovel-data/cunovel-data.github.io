{"id":3512,"no":82,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"The tech-man was short, and his skin glistened with well-kept plumpness. \\n\\n His hair was a fringe and his skull shone through pinkly. The rings on hisfingers were thick and heavy, his clothes were scented, and he was thefirst man Mallow had met on the planet who hadn\u0027t looked hungry. \\n\\n The tech-man\u0027s lips pursed peevishly, \"Now, my man, quickly. I have thingsof great importance waiting for me. You seem a stranger? He seemed toevaluate Mallow\u0027s definitely un-Siwennese costume and his eyelids wereheavy with suspicion. \\n\\n \"I am not of the neighborhood,\" said Mallow, calmly, \"but the matter isirrelevant. I have had the honor to send you a little gift yesterday? \\n\\n The tech-man\u0027s nose lifted, \"I received it. An interesting gewgaw. I mayhave use for it on occasion.\"\"I have other and more interesting gifts. Quite out of the gewgaw stage.\"\"Oh-h?\" The tech-man\u0027s voice lingered thoughtfully over the monosyllable. \\n\\n \"I think I already see the course of the interview; it has happened before. \\n\\n You are going to give me some trifle or other. A few credits, perhaps acloak, second-rate jewelry; anything your little soul may think sufficientto corrupt a tech-man.\" His lower lip puffed out belligerently, \"And I knowwhat you wish in exchange. There have been others and to spare with thesame bright idea. You wish to be adopted into our clan. You wish to betaught the mysteries of nucleics and the care of the machines. You thinkbecause you dogs of Siwenna ?and probably your strangerhood is assumed forsafety\u0027s sake ?are being daily punished for your rebellion that you canescape what you deserve by throwing over yourselves the privileges andprotections of the tech-man\u0027s guild.\"Mallow would have spoken, but the tech-man raised himself into a suddenroar. \"And now leave before I report your name to the Protector of theCity. Do you think that I would betray the trust? The Siwennese traitorsthat preceded me would have ?perhaps! But you deal with a different breednow. Why, Galaxy, I marvel that I do not kill you myself at this momentwith my bare hands.\"Mallow smiled to himself. The entire speech was patently artificial in toneand content, so that all the dignified indignation degenerated intouninspired farce. \\n\\n The trader glanced humorously at the two flabby hands that had been namedas his possible executioners then and there, and said, \"Your Wisdom, youare wrong on three counts. First, I am not a creature of the viceroy cometo test your loyalty. Second, my gift is something the Emperor himself inall his splendor does not and will never possess. Third, what I wish inreturn is very little; a nothing; a mere breath.\"\"So you say!\" He descended into heavy sarcasm. \"Come, what is this imperialdonation that your godlike power wishes to bestow upon me? Something theEmperor doesn\u0027t have, eh?\" He broke into a sharp squawk of derision. \\n\\n Mallow rose and pushed the chair aside, \"I have waited three days to seeyou, Your Wisdom, but the display will take only three seconds. If you willjust draw that blaster whose butt I see very near your hand? \\n\\n \"Eh?\"\"And shoot me, I will be obliged.\"\"What?\"\"If I am killed, you can tell the police I tried to bribe you intobetraying guild secrets. You\u0027ll receive high praise. If I am not killed,you may have my shield.\"For the first time, the tech-man became aware of the dimly-whiteillumination that hovered closely about his visitor, as though he had beendipped in pearl-dust. His blaster raised to the level and with eyesa-squint in wonder and suspicion, he closed contact. \\n\\n The molecules of air caught in the sudden surge of atomic disruption, toreinto glowing, burning ions, and marked out the blinding thin line thatstruck at Mallow\u0027s heart ?and splashed! \\n\\n While Mallow\u0027s look of patience never changed, the nuclear forces that toreat him consumed themselves against that fragile, pearly illumination, andcrashed back to die in mid-air. \\n\\n The tech-man\u0027s blaster dropped to the floor with an unnoticed crash. \\n\\n Mallow said, \"Does the Emperor have a personal force-shield? You can haveone.\"The tech-man stuttered, \"Are you a tech-man?\"\"No.\"\"Then ?then where did you get that?\"\"What do you care?\" Mallow was coolly contemptuous. \"Do you want it?\" Athin, knobbed chain fell upon the desk, \"There it is.\"The tech-man snatched it up and fingered it nervously, \"Is this complete?\"\"Complete.\"\"Where\u0027s the power?\"Mallow\u0027s finger fell upon the largest knob, dull in its leaden case. \\n\\n The tech-man looked up, and his face was congested with blood, \"Sir, I am atech-man, senior grade. I have twenty years behind me as supervisor and Istudied under the great Bier at the University of Trantor. If you have theinfernal charlatanry to tell me that a small container the size of a ?of awalnut, blast it, holds a nuclear generator, I\u0027ll have you before theProtector in three seconds.\"\"Explain it yourself then, if you can. I say it\u0027s complete.\"The tech-man\u0027s flush faded slowly as he bound the chain about his waist,and, following Mallow\u0027s gesture, pushed the knob. The radiance thatsurrounded him shone into dim relief. His blaster lifted, then hesitated. \\n\\n Slowly, he adjusted it to an almost burnless minimum. \\n\\n And then, convulsively, he closed circuit and the nuclear fire dashedagainst his hand, harmlessly. \\n\\n .He whirled, \"And what if I shoot you now, and keep the shield.\"\"Try!\" said Mallow. \"Do you think I gave you my only sample?\" And he, too,was solidly incased in light. \\n\\n The tech-man giggled nervously. The blaster clattered onto the desk. Hesaid, \"And what is this mere nothing, this breath, that you wish inreturn\u0027?\"\"I want to see your generators.\"\"You realize that that is forbidden. It would mean ejection into space forboth of us? \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to touch them or have anything to do with them. I want to seethem ?from a distance.\"\"If not?\"\"If not, you have your shield, but I have other things. For one thing, ablaster especially designed to pierce that shield.\"\"Hm-mmm.\" The tech-man\u0027s eyes shifted. \"Come with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47254.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
