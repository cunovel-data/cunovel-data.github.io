{"id":3526,"no":96,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"Hober Mallow shuffled his feet wearily as he leafed through the reports. Two years of the mayoralty had made him a bit more housebroken, a bitsofter, a bit more patient, 朾ut it had not made him learn to likegovernment reports and the mind-breaking officialese in which they werewritten. \"How many ships did they get?\" asked Jael. \"Four trapped on the ground. Two unreported. All others accounted for andsafe.\" Mallow grunted, \"We should have done better, but it\u0027s just ascratch.\"There was no answer and Mallow looked up, \"Does anything worry you?\"\"I wish Sutt would get here,\" was the almost irrelevant answer. \"Ah, yes, and now we\u0027ll hear another lecture on the home front.\"\"No, we won\u0027t,\" snapped Jael, \"but you\u0027re stubborn, Mallow. You may haveworked out the foreign situation to the last detail but you\u0027ve never givena care about what goes on here on the home planet.\"\"Well, that\u0027s your job, isn\u0027t it? What did I make you Minister of Educationand Propaganda for?\"\"Obviously to send me to an early and miserable grave, for all theco-operation you give me. For the last year, I\u0027ve been deafening you withthe rising danger of Sutt and his Religionists. What good will your plansbe, if Sutt forces a special election and has you thrown out?\"\"None, I admit.\"\"And your speech last night just about handed the election to Sutt with asmile and a pat. Was there any necessity for being so frank?\"\"Isn\u0027t there such a thing as stealing Sutt\u0027s thunder?\"\"No,\" said Jael, violently, \"not the way you did it. You claim to haveforeseen everything, and don\u0027t explain why you traded with Korell to theirexclusive benefit for three years. Your only plan of battle is to retirewithout a battle. You abandon all trade with the sectors of space nearKorell. You openly proclaim a stalemate. You promise no offensive, even inthe future. Galaxy, Mallow, what am I supposed to do with such a mess?\"\"It lacks glamor?\"\"It lacks mob emotion-appeal.\"\"Same thing.\"\"Mallow, wake up. You have two alternatives. Either you present the peoplewith a dynamic foreign policy, whatever your private plans are, or you makesome sort of compromise with Sutt.\"Mallow said, \"All right, if I\u0027ve failed the first, let\u0027s try the second. Sutt\u0027s just arrived.\"Sutt and Mallow had not met personally since the day of the trial, twoyears back. Neither detected any change in the other, except for thatsubtle atmosphere about each which made it quite evident that the roles ofruler and defier had changed. Sutt took his seat without shaking hands. Mallow offered a cigar and said, \"Mind if Jael stays? He wants a compromiseearnestly. He can act as mediator if tempers rise.\"Sutt shrugged, \"A compromise will be well for you. Upon another occasion Ionce asked you to state your terms. I presume the positions are reversednow.\"\"You presume correctly.\"\"Then there are my terms. You must abandon your blundering policy ofeconomic bribery and trade in gadgetry, and return to the tested foreignpolicy of our fathers.\"\"You mean conquest by missionary.\"\"Exactly.\"\"No compromise short of that?\"\"None.\"\"Um-mmm.\" Mallow lit up very slowly and inhaled the tip of his cigar into abright glow. \"In Hardin\u0027s time, when conquest by missionary was new andradical, men like yourself opposed it. Now it is tried, tested, hallowed,杄verything a Jorane Sutt would find well. But, tell me, how would you getus out of our present mess?\"\"Your present mess. I had nothing to do with it.\"\"Consider the question suitably modified.\"\"A strong offensive is indicated. The stalemate you seem to be satisfiedwith is fatal. It would be a confession of weakness to all the worlds ofthe Periphery, where the appearance of strength is all-important, andthere\u0027s not one vulture among them that wouldn\u0027t join the assault for itsshare of the corpse. You ought to understand that. You\u0027re from Smyrno,aren\u0027t you?\"Mallow passed over the significance of the remark. He said, \"And if youbeat Korell, what of the Empire? That is the real enemy.\"Sutt\u0027s narrow smile tugged at the comers of his mouth, \"Oh, no, yourrecords of your visit to Siwenna were complete. The viceroy of theNormannic Sector is interested in creating dissension in the Periphery forhis own benefit, but only as a side issue. He isn\u0027t going to stakeeverything on an expedition to the Galaxy\u0027s rim when he has fifty hostileneighbors and an emperor to rebel against. I paraphrase your own words.\"\"Oh, yes he might, Sutt, if he thinks we\u0027re strong enough to be dangerous. And he might think so, if we destroy Korell by the main force of frontalattack. We\u0027d have to be considerably more subtle.\"\"As for instance? Mallow leaned back, \"Sutt, I\u0027ll give you your chance. I don\u0027t need you, butI can use you. So I\u0027ll tell you what it\u0027s all about, and then you caneither join me and receive a place in a coalition cabinet, or you can playthe martyr and rot in jail.\"\"Once before you tried that last trick.\"\"Not very hard, Sutt. The right time has only just come. Now listen.\"Mallow\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"When I first landed on Korell,\" he began, A bribed the Commdor with thetrinkets and gadgets that form the trader\u0027s usual stock. At the start,that. was meant only to get us entrance into a steel foundry. I had no planfurther than that, but in that I succeeded. I got what I wanted. But it wasonly after my visit to the Empire that I first realized exactly what aweapon I could build that trade into. \"This is a Seldon crisis we\u0027re facing, Sutt, and Seldon crises are notsolved by individuals but by historic forces. Hari Seldon, when he plannedour course of future history, did not count on brilliant heroics but on thebroad sweeps of economics and sociology. So the solutions to the variouscrises must be achieved by the forces that become available to us at thetime. \"In this case, 杢rade!\"Sutt raised his eyebrows skeptically and took advantage of the pause, \"Ihope I am not of subnormal intelligence, but the fact is that your vaguelecture isn\u0027t very illuminating.\"\"It will become so,\" said Mallow. \"Consider that until now the power oftrade has been underestimated. It has been thought that it took apriesthood under our control to make it a powerful weapon. That is not so,and this is my contribution to the Galactic situation. Trade withoutpriests! Trade alone! It is strong enough. Let us become very simple andspecific. Korell is now at war with us. Consequently our trade with her hasstopped. But, 杗otice that I am making this as simple as a problem inaddition, 杋n the past three years she has based her economy more and moreupon the nuclear techniques which we have introduced and which only we cancontinue to supply. Now what do you suppose will happen once the tinynuclear generators begin failing, and one gadget after another goes out ofcommission? \"The small household appliances go first. After a half a year of thisstalemate that you abhor, a woman\u0027s nuclear knife won\u0027t work any more. Herstove begins failing. Her washer doesn\u0027t do a good job. Thetemperature-humidity control in her house dies on a hot summer day. Whathappens?\"He paused for an answer, and Sutt said calmly, \"Nothing. People endure agood deal in war.\"\"Very true. They do. They\u0027ll send their sons out in unlimited numbers todie horribly on broken spaceships. They\u0027ll bear up under enemy bombardment,if it means they have to live on stale bread and foul water in caves half amile deep. But it\u0027s very hard to bear up under little things when thepatriotic uplift of imminent danger is not present. It\u0027s going to, be astalemate. There will be no casualties, no bombardments, no battles. \"There will just be a knife that won\u0027t cut, and a stove that won\u0027t cook,and a house that freezes in the winter. It will be annoying, and peoplewill grumble.\"Sutt said slowly, wonderingly, \"Is that what you\u0027re setting your hopes on,man? What do you expect? A housewives\u0027 rebellion? A Jacquerie? A suddenuprising of butchers and grocers with their cleavers and bread-knivesshouting \u0027Give us back our Automatic Super-Kleeno Nuclear WashingMachines.\u0027\"\"No, sir,\" said Mallow, impatiently, \"I do not. I expect, however, ageneral background of grumbling and dissatisfaction which will be seized onby more important figures later on.\"\"And what more important figures are these?\"\"The manufacturers, the factory owners, the industrialists of Korell. Whentwo years of the stalemate have gone, the machines in the factories will,one by one, begin to fail. Those industries which we have changed fromfirst to last with our new nuclear gadgets will find themselves verysuddenly ruined. The heavy industries will find themselves, en masse and ata stroke, the owners of nothing but scrap machinery that won\u0027t work.\"\"The factories ran well enough before you came there, Mallow.\"\"Yes, Sutt, so they did ?at about one-twentieth the profits, even if youleave out of consideration the cost of reconversion to the originalpre-nuclear state. With the industrialist and financier and the average manall against him, how long will the Commdor hold out?\"\"As long as he pleases, as soon as it occurs to him to get new nucleargenerators from the Empire.\"And Mallow laughed joyously, \"You\u0027ve missed, Sutt, missed as badly as theCommdor himself. You\u0027ve missed everything, and understood nothing. Look,man, the Empire can replace nothing. The Empire has always been a realm ofcolossal resources. They\u0027ve calculated everything in planets, in stellarsystems, in whole sectors of the Galaxy. Their generators are giganticbecause they thought in gigantic fashion. \"But we, ?we , our little Foundation, our single world almost withoutmetallic resources, 杊ave had to work with brute economy. Our generatorshave had to be the size of our thumb, because it was all the metal we couldafford. We had to develop new techniques and new methods, 杢echniques andmethods the Empire can\u0027t follow because they have degenerated past thestage where they can make any really vital scientific advance. \"With all their nuclear shields, large enough to protect a ship, a city, anentire world; they could never build one to protect a single man. To supplylight and heat to a city, they have motors six stories high, 朓 saw them ? where ours could fit into this room. And when I told one of their nuclearspecialists that a lead container the size of a walnut contained a nucleargenerator, he almost choked with indignation on the spot. \"Why, they don\u0027t even understand their own colossi any longer. The machineswork from generation to generation automatically, and the caretakers are ahereditary caste who would be helpless if a single D-tube in all that vaststructure burnt out. \"The whole war is a battle between those two systems, between the Empireand the Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize control of aworld, they bribe with immense ships that can make war, but lack alleconomic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with little things,useless in war, but vital to prosperity and profits. \"A king, or a Commdor, will take the ships and even make war. Arbitraryrulers throughout history have bartered their subjects\u0027 welfare for whatthey consider honor, and glory, and conquest. But it\u0027s still the littlethings in life that count ?and Asper Argo won\u0027t stand up against theeconomic depression that will sweep all Korell in two or three years.\"Sutt was at the window, his back to Mallow and Jael. It was early eveningnow, and the few stars that struggled feebly here at the very rim of theGalaxy sparked against the background of the misty, wispy Lens thatincluded the remnants of that Empire, still vast, that fought against them. Sutt said, \"No. You are not the man.\"\"You don\u0027t believe me?\"\"I mean I don\u0027t trust you. You\u0027re smooth-tongued. You befooled me properlywhen I thought I had you under proper care on your first trip to Korell. When I thought I had you cornered at the trial, you wormed your way out ofit and into the mayor\u0027s chair by demagoguery. There is nothing straightabout you; no motive that hasn\u0027t another behind it; no statement thathasn\u0027t three meanings. \"Suppose you were a traitor. Suppose your visit to the Empire had broughtyou a subsidy and a promise of power. Your actions would be precisely whatthey are now. You would bring about a war after having strengthened theenemy. You would force the Foundation into inactivity. And you wouldadvance a plausible explanation of everything, one so plausible it wouldconvince everyone.\"\"You mean there\u0027ll be no compromise?\" asked Mallow, gently. \"I mean you must get out, by free will or force.\"\"I warned you of the only alternative to co-operation.\"Jorane Sutt\u0027s face congested with blood in a sudden access of emotion. \"AndI warn you, Hober Mallow of Smyrno, that if you arrest me, there will be noquarter. My men will stop nowhere in spreading the truth about you, and thecommon people of the Foundation will unite against their foreign ruler. They have a consciousness of destiny that a Smyrnian can never understand ? and that consciousness will destroy you.\"Hober Mallow said quietly to the two guards who had entered, \"Take himaway. He\u0027s under arrest.\"Sutt said, \"Your last chance.\"Mallow stubbed out his cigar and never looked up. And five minutes later, Jael stirred and said, wearily, \"Well, now thatyou\u0027ve made a martyr for the cause, what next?\"Mallow stopped playing with the ash tray and looked up, \"That\u0027s not theSutt I used to know. He\u0027s a blood-blind bull. Galaxy, he hates me.\"\"All the more dangerous then.\"\"More dangerous? Nonsense! He\u0027s lost all power of judgement.\"Jael said grimly, \"You\u0027re overconfident, Mallow. You\u0027re ignoring thepossibility of a popular rebellion.\"Mallow looked up, grim in his turn, \"Once and for all, Jael, there is nopossibility of a popular rebellion.\"\"You\u0027re sure of yourself!\"\"I\u0027m sure of the Seldon crisis and the historical validity of theirsolutions, externally and internally. There are some things I didn\u0027t tellSuit right now. He tried to control the Foundation itself by religiousforces as he controlled the outer worlds, and he failed, 杦hich is thesurest sign that in the Seldon scheme, religion is played out. \"Economic control worked differently. And to paraphrase that famous SalvorHardin quotation of yours, it\u0027s a poor nuclear blaster that won\u0027t pointboth ways. If Korell prospered with our trade, so did we. If Korellianfactories fail without our trade; and if the prosperity of the outer worldsvanishes with commercial isolation; so will our factories fail and ourprosperity vanish. \"And there isn\u0027t a factory, not a trading center. not a shipping line thatisn\u0027t under my control; that I couldn\u0027t squeeze to nothing if Sutt attemptsrevolutionary propaganda. Where his propaganda succeeds, or even looks asthough it might succeed, I will make certain that prosperity dies. Where itfails, prosperity will continue, because my factories will remain fullystaffed. \"So by the same reasoning which makes me sure that the Korellians willrevolt in favor of prosperity, I am sure we will not revolt against it. Thegame will be played out to its end.\"\"So then,\" said Jael, \"you\u0027re establishing a plutocracy. You\u0027re making us aland of traders and merchant princes. Then what of the future?\"Mallow lifted his gloomy face, and exclaimed fiercely, \"What business ofmine is the future? No doubt Seldon has foreseen it and prepared againstit. There will be other crises in the time to come when money power hasbecome as dead a force as religion is now. Let my successors solve thosenew problems, as I have solved the one of today.\"KORELL?..And so after three years of a war which was certainly the mostunfought war on record, the Republic of Korell surrendered unconditionally,and Hober Mallow took his place next to Hari Seldon and Salvor Hardin inthe hearts of the people of the Foundation.

Meanwhile, at the age of nine, he found the love of his life (in theinanimate sense) when he discovered his first science-fiction magazine. Bythe time he was eleven, he began to write stories, and at eighteen, heactually worked up the nerve to submit one. It was rejected. After fourlong months of tribulation and suffering, he sold his first story and,thereafter, he never looked back. In 1941, when he was twenty-one years old, he wrote the classic short story\"Nightfall\" and his future was assured.
