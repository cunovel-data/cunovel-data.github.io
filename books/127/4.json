{"id":3434,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"The ship landed in a medley of noises. There was the far-off hiss of theatmosphere cutting and sliding past the metal of the ship. There was thesteady drone of the conditioners fighting the heat of friction, and theslower rumble of the engines enforcing deceleration. There was the humansound of men and women gathering in the debarkation rooms and the grind ofthe hoists lifting baggage, mail, and freight to the long axis of the ship,from which they would be later moved along to the unloading platform. Gaal felt the slight jar that indicated the ship no longer had anindependent motion of its own. Ship\u0027s gravity had been giving way toplanetary gravity for hours. Thousands of passengers had been sittingpatiently in the debarkation rooms which swung easily on yieldingforce-fields to accommodate its orientation to the changing direction ofthe gravitational forces. Now they were crawling down curving ramps to thelarge, yawning locks. Gaal\u0027s baggage was minor. He stood at a desk, as it was quickly andexpertly taken apart and put together again. His visa was inspected andstamped. He himself paid no attention. This was Trantor! The air seemed a little thicker here, the gravity a bitgreater, than on his home planet of Synnax, but he would get used to that. He wondered if he would get used to immensity. Debarkation Building was tremendous. The roof was almost lost in theheights. Gaal could almost imagine that clouds could form beneath itsimmensity. He could see no opposite wall; just men and desks and convergingfloor till it faded out in haze. The man at the desk was speaking again. He sounded annoyed. He said, \"Moveon, Dornick.\" He had to open the visa, look again, before he remembered thename. Gaal said, \"Where?where? The man at the desk jerked a thumb, \"Taxis to the right and third left.\"Gaal moved, seeing the glowing twists of air suspended high in nothingnessand reading, \"TAXIS TO ALL POINTS.\"A figure detached itself from anonymity and stopped at the desk, as Gaalleft. The man at the desk looked up and nodded briefly. The figure noddedin return and followed the young immigrant. He was in time to hear Gaal\u0027s destination. Gaal found himself hard against a railing. The small sign said, \"Supervisor.\" The man to whom the sign referred didnot look up. He said, \"Where to?\"Gaal wasn\u0027t sure, but even a few seconds hesitation meant men queuing inline behind him. The Supervisor looked up, \"Where to?\"Gaal\u0027s funds were low, but there was only this one night and then he wouldhave a job. He tried to sound nonchalant, \"A good hotel, please.\"The Supervisor was unimpressed, \"They\u0027re all good. Name one.\"Gaal said, desperately, \"The nearest one, please.\"The Supervisor touched a button. A thin line of light formed along thefloor, twisting among others which brightened and dimmed in differentcolors and shades. A ticket was shoved into Gaal\u0027s hands. It glowedfaintly. The Supervisor said, \"One point twelve.\"Gaal fumbled for the coins. He said, \"Where do I go?\"\"Follow the light. The ticket will keep glowing as long as you\u0027re pointedin the tight direction.\"Gaal looked up and began walking. There were hundreds creeping across thevast floor, following their individual trails, sifting and strainingthemselves through intersection points to arrive at their respectivedestinations. His own trail ended. A man in glaring blue and yellow uniform, shining andnew in unstainable plasto-textile, reached for his two bags. \"Direct line to the Luxor,\" he said. The man who followed Gaal heard that. He also heard Gaal say, \"Fine,\" andwatched him enter the blunt-nosed vehicle. The taxi lifted straight up. Gaal stared out the curved, transparentwindow, marvelling at the sensation of airflight within an enclosedstructure and clutching instinctively at the back of the driver\u0027s seat. Thevastness contracted and the people became ants in random distribution. Thescene contracted further and began to slide backward. There was a wall ahead. It began high in the air and extended upward out ofsight. It was riddled with holes that were the mouths of tunnels. Gaal\u0027staxi moved toward one then plunged into it. For a moment, Gaal wonderedidly how his driver could pick out one among so many. There was now only blackness, with nothing but the past-flashing of acolored signal light to relieve the gloom. The air was full of a rushingsound. Gaal leaned forward against deceleration then and the taxi popped out ofthe tunnel and descended to ground-level once more. \"The Luxor Hotel,\" said the driver, unnecessarily. He helped Gaal with hisbaggage, accepted a tenth-credit tip with a businesslike air, picked up awaiting passenger, and was rising again. In all this, from the moment of debarkation, there had been no glimpse ofsky.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47132.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
