{"id":3480,"no":50,"title":"PART IV THE TRADERS","content":"TRADERS?.. and constantly in advance of the political hegemony of theFoundation were the Traders, reaching out tenuous fingerholds through thetremendous distances of the Periphery. Months or years might pass betweenlandings on Terminus; their ships were often nothing more than patchquiltsof home-made repairs and improvisations; their honesty was none of thehighest; their daring... \n Through it all they forged an empire more enduring than thepseudo-religious despotism of the Four Kingdoms... \n Tales without end are told of these massive, lonely figures who borehalf-seriously, half-mockingly a motto adopted from one of Salvor Hardin\u0027sepigrams, \"Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what isright!\" It is difficult now to tell which tales are real and whichapocryphal. There are none probably that have not suffered someexaggeration.... \n ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICALimmar Ponyets was completely a-lather when the call reached his receiver ? \n which proves that the old bromide about telemessages and the shower holdstrue even in the dark, hard space of the Galactic Periphery. \n Luckily that part of a free-lance trade ship which is not given over tomiscellaneous merchandise is extremely snug. So much so, that the shower,hot water included, is located in a two-by-four cubby, ten feet from thecontrol panels. Ponyets heard the staccato rattle of the receiver quiteplainly. \n Dripping suds and a growl, he stepped out to adjust the vocal, and threehours later a second trade ship was alongside, and a grinning youngsterentered through the air tube between the ships. \n Ponyets rattled his best chair forward and perched himself on thepilot-swivel. \n \"What\u0027ve you been doing, Gorm?\" he asked, darkly. \"Chasing me all the wayfrom the Foundation?\"Les Gorm broke out a cigarette, and shook his head definitely, \"Me? Not achance. I\u0027m just a sucker who happened to land on Glyptal IV the day afterthe mail. So they sent me out after you with this.\"The tiny, gleaming sphere changed hands, and Gorm added, \"It\u0027sconfidential. Super-secret. Can\u0027t be trusted to the sub-ether and all that. \n Or so I gather. At least, it\u0027s a Personal Capsule, and won\u0027t open foranyone but you.\"Ponyets regarded the capsule distastefully, \"I can see that. And I neverknew one of these to hold good news, either.\"It opened in his hand and the thin, transparent tape unrolled stiffly. Hiseyes swept the message quickly, for when the last of the tape had emerged,the first was already brown and crinkled. In a minute and a half it hadturned black and, molecule by molecule, fallen apart. \n Ponyets grunted hollowly, \"Oh, Galaxy!\"Les Gorm said quietly, \"Can I help somehow? Or is it too secret?\"\"It will bear telling, since you\u0027re of the Guild. I\u0027ve got to go toAskone.\"\"That place? How come?\"\"They\u0027ve imprisoned a trader. But keep it to yourself.\u0027\u0027 \n Gorm\u0027s expression jolted into anger, \"Imprisoned! That\u0027s against theConvention.\"\"So is the interference with local politics.\"\"Oh! Is that what he did?\" Gorm meditated. \"Who\u0027s the trader\u0027? Anyone Iknow?\"\"No!\" said Ponyets sharply, and Gorm accepted the implication and asked nofurther questions. \n Ponyets was up and staring darkly out the visiplate. He mumbled strongexpressions at that part of the misty lens-form that was the body of theGalaxy, then said loudly, \"Damnedest mess! I\u0027m way behind quota.\"Light broke on Gorm\u0027s intellect, \"Hey, friend, Askone is a closed area.\"\"That\u0027s right. You can\u0027t sell as much as a penknife on Askone. They won\u0027tbuy nuclear gadgets of any sort. With my quota dead on its feet, it\u0027smurder to go there.\"\"Can\u0027t get out of it?\"Ponyets shook his head absently, A know the fellow involved. Can\u0027t walk outon a friend. What of it? I am in the hands of the Galactic Spirit and walkcheerfully in the way he points out.\"Gorm said blankly, \"Huh?\"Ponyets looked at him, and laughed shortly, \"I forgot. You never read the\u0027Bood of the Spirit,\u0027 did you?\"\"Never heard of it,\" said Gorm, curtly. \n \"Well, you would if you\u0027d had a religious training.\"\"Religious training? For the priesthood?\" Gorm was profoundly shocked. \n \"Afraid so. It\u0027s my dark shame and secret. I was too much for the ReverendFathers, though, They expelled me, for reasons sufficient to promote me toa secular education under the Foundation. Well, look, I\u0027d better push off. \n How\u0027s your quota this year?\"Gorm crushed out his cigarette and adjusted his cap, \"I\u0027ve got my lastcargo going now. I\u0027ll make it.\"\"Lucky fellow,\" gloomed Ponyets, and for many minutes after Les Gorm left,he sat in motionless reverie. \n So Eskel Gorov was on Askone ?and in prison as well! \n That was bad! In fact, considerably worse than it might appear. It was onething to tell a curious youngster a diluted version of the business tothrow him off and send him about his own. It was a thing of a differentsort to face the truth. \n For Limmar Ponyets was one of the few people who happened to know thatMaster Trader Eskel Gorov was not a trader at all; but that entirelydifferent thing, an agent of the Foundation! \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47178.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
