{"id":3466,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"In the ancient days when the Galactic Empire had embraced the Galaxy, andAnacreon had been the richest of the prefects of the Periphery, more thanone emperor had visited the Viceregal Palace in state. And not one had leftwithout at least one effort to pit his skill with air speedster and needlegun against the feathered flying fortress they call the Nyakbird. \n The fame of Anacreon had withered to nothing with the decay of the times. \n The Viceregal Palace was a drafty mass of ruins except for the wing thatFoundation workmen had restored. And no Emperor had been seen in Anacreonfor two hundred years. \n But Nyak hunting was still the royal sport and a good eye with the needlegun still the first requirement of Anacreon\u0027s kings. \n Lepold I, King of Anacreon and ?as was invariably, but untruthfully added?Lord of the Outer Dominions, though not yet sixteen had already provedhis skill many times over. He had brought down his first Nyak when scarcelythirteen; had brought down his tenth the week after his accession to thethrone; and was returning now from his forty-sixth. \n \"Fifty before I come of age,\" he had exulted. \"Who\u0027ll take the wager?\"But Courtiers don\u0027t take wagers against the king\u0027s skill. There is thedeadly danger of winning. So no one did, and the king left to change hisclothes in high spirits. \n \"Lepold!\"The king stopped mid-step at the one voice that could cause him to do so. \n He turned sulkily. \n Wienis stood upon the threshold of his chambers and beetled at his youngnephew. \n \"Send them away,\" he motioned impatiently. \"Get rid of them.\"The king nodded curtly and the two chamberlains bowed and backed down thestairs. Lepold entered his uncle\u0027s room. \n Wienis stared at the king\u0027s hunting suit morosely. \"You\u0027ll have moreimportant things to tend to than Nyak hunting soon enough.\"He turned his back and stumped to his desk. Since he had grown too old forthe rush of air, the perilous dive within wing-beat of the Nyak, the rolland climb of the speedster at the motion of a foot, he had soured upon thewhole sport. \n Lepold appreciated his uncle\u0027s sour-grapes attitude and it was not withoutmalice that he began enthusiastically, \"But you should have been with ustoday, uncle. We flushed one in the wilds of Sarnia that was a monster. Andgame as they come. We had it out for two hours over at least seventy squaremiles of ground. And then I got to Sunwards ?he was motioning graphically,as though he were once more in his speedster ?and dived torque-wise. \n Caught him on the rise just under the left wing at quarters. It maddenedhim and he canted athwart. I took his dare and veered a-left, waiting forthe plummet. Sure enough, down he came. He was within wing-beat before Imoved and then ? \n \"Lepold!\"\"Well!?I got him.\"\"I\u0027m sure you did. Now will you attend?\"The king shrugged and gravitated to the end table where he nibbled at aLera nut in quite an unregal sulk. He did not dare to meet his uncle\u0027seyes. \n Wienis said, by way of preamble, \"I\u0027ve been to the ship today.\"\"What ship?\"\"There is only one ship. The ship. The one the Foundation is repairing forthe navy. The old Imperial cruiser. Do I make myself sufficiently plain?\"\"That one? You see, I told you the Foundation would repair it if we askedthem to. It\u0027s all poppycock, you know, that story of yours about theirwanting to attack us. Because if they did, why would they fix the ship? Itdoesn\u0027t make sense, you know.\"\"Lepold, you\u0027re a fool!\"The king, who had just discarded the shell of the Lera nut and was liftinganother to his lips, flushed. \n \"Well now, look here,\" he said, with anger that scarcely rose abovepeevishness, \"I don\u0027t think you ought to call me that. You forget yourself. \n I\u0027ll be of age in two months, you know.\"\"Yes, and you\u0027re in a fine position to assume regal responsibilities. Ifyou spent half the time on public affairs that you do on Nyak hunting, I\u0027dresign the regency directly with a clear conscience.\"\"I don\u0027t care. That has nothing to do with the case, you know. The fact isthat even if you are the regent and my uncle, I\u0027m still king and you\u0027restill my subject. You oughtn\u0027t to call me a fool and you oughtn\u0027t to sit inmy presence, anyway. You haven\u0027t asked my permission. I think you ought tobe careful, or I might do something about it pretty soon.\"Wienis\u0027 gaze was cold. \"May I refer to you as \u0027your majesty\u0027?\"\"Yes.\"\"Very well! You are a fool, your majesty!\"His dark eyes blazed from beneath his grizzled brows and the young king satdown slowly. For a moment, there was sardonic satisfaction in the regent\u0027sface, but it faded quickly. His thick lips parted in a smile and one handfell upon the king\u0027s shoulder. \n \"Never mind, Lepold. I should not have spoken harshly to you. It isdifficult sometimes to behave with true propriety when the pressure ofevents is such as ?You understand?\" But if the words were conciliatory,there was something in his eyes that had not softened. \n Lepold said uncertainly, \"Yes. Affairs of State are deuced difficult, youknow.\" He wondered, not without apprehension, whether he were not in for adull siege of meaningless details on the year\u0027s trade with Smyrno and thelong, wrangling dispute over the sparsely settled worlds on the RedCorridor. \n Wienis was speaking again. \"My boy, I had thought to speak of this to youearlier, and perhaps I should have, but I know that your youthful spiritsare impatient of the dry detail of statecraft.\"Lepold nodded. \"Well, that\u0027s all right? \n His uncle broke in firmly and continued, \"However, you will come of age intwo months. Moreover, in the difficult times that are coming, you will haveto take a full and active part. You will be king henceforward, Lepold.\"Again Lepold nodded, but his expression was quite blank. \n \"There will be war, Lepold.\"\"War! But there\u0027s been truce with Smyrno? \n \"Not Smyrno. The Foundation itself.\"\"But, uncle, they\u0027ve agreed to repair the ship. You said? \n His voice choked off at the twist of his uncle\u0027s lip. \n \"Lepold\" ? some of the friendliness had gone ?we are to talk man to man. \n There is to be war with the Foundation, whether the ship is repaired ornot; all the sooner, in fact, since it is being repaired. The Foundation isthe source of power and might. All the greatness of Anacreon; all its shipsand its cities and its people and its commerce depend on the dribbles andleavings of power that the Foundation have given us grudgingly. I rememberthe time ? I, myself ?when the cities of Anacreon were warmed by theburning of coal and oil. But never mind that; you would have no conceptionof it.\"\"It seems,\" suggested the king timidly, \"that we ought to be grateful? \n \"Grateful?\" roared Wienis. \"Grateful that they begrudge us the merestdregs, while keeping space knows what for themselves ?and keeping it withwhat purpose in mind? Why, only that they may some day rule the Galaxy.\"His hand came down on his nephew\u0027s knee, and his eyes narrowed. \"Lepold,you are king of Anacreon. Your children and your children\u0027s children may bekings of the universe ?if you have the power that the Foundation iskeeping from us!\"\"There\u0027s something in that.\" Lepold\u0027s eyes gained a sparkle and his backstraightened. \"After all, what right have they to keep it to themselves? \n Not fair, you know. Anacreon counts for something, too.\"\"You see, you\u0027re beginning to understand. And now, my boy, what if Smyrnodecides to attack the Foundation for its own part and thus gains all thatpower? How long do you suppose we could escape becoming a vassal power? Howlong would you hold your throne?\"Lepold grew excited. \"Space, yes. You\u0027re absolutely right, you know. Wemust strike first. It\u0027s simply self-defense.\"Wienis\u0027 smile broadened slightly. \"Furthermore, once, at the very beginningof the reign of your grandfather, Anacreon actually established a militarybase on the Foundation\u0027s planet, Terminus ?a base vitally needed fornational defense. We were forced to abandon that base as a result of themachinations of the leader of that Foundation, a sly cur, a scholar, withnot a drop of noble blood in his veins. You understand, Lepold? Yourgrandfather was humiliated by this commoner. I remember him! He wasscarcely older than myself when he came to Anacreon with his devil\u0027s smileand devil\u0027s brain ?and the power of the other three kingdoms behind him,combined in cowardly union against the greatness of Anacreon.\"Lepold flushed and the sparkle in his eyes blazed. \"By Seldon, if I hadbeen my grandfather, I would have fought even so.\"\"No, Lepold. We decided to wait ?to wipe out the insult at a fitter time. \n It had been your father\u0027s hope, before his untimely death, that he might bethe one to ? Well, well!\" Wienis turned away for a moment. Then, as ifstifling emotion, \"He was my brother. And yet, if his son were? \n \"Yes, uncle, I\u0027ll not fail him. I have decided. It seems only proper thatAnacreon wipe out this nest of troublemakers, and that immediately.\"\"No, not immediately. First, we must wait for the repairs of the battlecruiser to be completed. The mere fact that they are willing to undertakethese repairs proves that they fear us. The fools attempt to placate us,but we are not to be turned from our path, are we?\"And Lepold\u0027s fist slammed against his cupped palm. \n \"Not while I am king in Anacreon.\"Wienis\u0027 lip twitched sardonically. \"Besides which we must wait for SalvorHardin to arrive.\"\"Salvor Hardin!\" The king grew suddenly round-eyed, and the youthfulcontour of his beardless face lost the almost hard lines into which theyhad been compressed. \n \"Yes, Lepold, the leader of the Foundation himself is coming to Anacreon onyour birthday ?probably to soothe us with buttered words. But it won\u0027thelp him.\"\"Salvor Hardin!\" It was the merest murmur. \n Wienis frowned. \"Are you afraid of the name? It is the same Salvor Hardin,who on his previous visit, ground our noses into the dust. You\u0027re notforgetting that deadly insult to the royal house? And from a commoner. Thedregs of the gutter.\"\"No. I guess not. No, I won\u0027t. I won\u0027t! We\u0027ll pay him back ?but...but ? \n I\u0027m afraid ?a little.\"The regent rose. \"Afraid? Of what? Of what, you young? He choked off. \n \"It would be...uh...sort of blasphemous, you know, to attack theFoundation. I mean? He paused. \n \"Go on.\"Lepold said confusedly, \"I mean, if there were really a Galactic Spirit,he...uh...it mightn\u0027t like it. Don\u0027t you think? \n \"No, I don\u0027t,\" was the hard answer. Wienis sat down again and his lipstwisted in a queer smile. \"And so youreally bother your head a great deal over the Galactic Spirit, do you? \n That\u0027s what comes of letting you run wild. You\u0027ve been listening to Verisofquite a bit, I take it.\"\"He\u0027s explained a great deal? \n \"About the Galactic Spirit?\"\"Yes.\"\"Why, you unweaned cub, he believes in that mummery a good deal less than Ido, and I don\u0027t believe in it at all. How many times have you been toldthat all this talk is nonsense?\"\"Well, I know that. But Verisof says? \n \"Pay no heed to Verisof. It\u0027s nonsense.\"There was a short, rebellious silence, and then Lepold said, \"Everyonebelieves it just the same. I mean all this talk about the Prophet HariSeldon and how he appointed the Foundation to carry on his commandmentsthat there might some day be a return of the Galactic Paradise: and howanyone who disobeys his commandments will be destroyed for eternity. Theybelieve it. I\u0027ve presided at festivals, and I\u0027m sure they do.\"\"Yes, they do; but we don\u0027t. And you may be thankful it\u0027s so, for accordingto this foolishness, you are king by divine right ?and are semi-divineyourself. Very handy. It eliminates all possibilities of revolts andinsures absolute obedience in everything. And that is why, Lepold, you musttake an active part in ordering the war against the Foundation. I am onlyregent, and quite human. You are king, and more than half a god ?to them.\"\"But I suppose I\u0027m not really,\" said the king reflectively. \n \"No, not really,\" came the sardonic response, \"but you are to everyone butthe people of the Foundation. Get that? To everyone but those of theFoundation. Once they are removed there will be no one to deny you thegodhead. Think of that!\"\"And after that we will ourselves be able to operate the power boxes of thetemples and the ships that fly without men and the holy food that curescancer and all the rest? Verisof said only those blessed with the GalacticSpirit could? \n \"Yes, Verisof said! Verisof, next to Salvor Hardin, is your greatest enemy. \n Stay with me, Lepold, and don\u0027t worry about them. Together we will recreatean empire-not just the kingdom of Anacreon-but one comprising every one ofthe billions of suns of the Empire. Is that better than a wordy \u0027GalacticParadise\u0027?\"\"Ye-es.\"\"Can Verisof promise more?\"\"No.\"\"Very well.\" His voice became peremptory. \"I suppose we may consider thematter settled.\" He waited for no answer. \"Get along. I\u0027ll be down later. \n And just one thing, Lepold.\"The young king turned on the threshold. \n Wienis was smiling with all but his eyes. \"Be careful on these Nyak hunts,my boy. Since the unfortunate accident to your father, I have had thestrangest presentiments concerning you, at times. In the confusion, withneedle guns thickening the air with darts, one can never tell. You will becareful, I hope. And you\u0027ll do as I say about the Foundation, won\u0027t you?\"Lepold\u0027s eyes widened and dropped away from those of his uncle. \"Yes ? \n certainly.\"\"Good!\" He stared after his departing nephew, expressionlessly, andreturned to his desk. \n And Lepold\u0027s thoughts as he left were somber and not unfearful. Perhaps itwould be best to defeat the Foundation and gain the power Wienis spoke of. \n But afterward, when the war was over and he was secure on his throne?Hebecame acutely conscious of the fact that Wienis and his two arrogant sonswere at present next in line to the throne. \n But he was king. And kings could order people executed. \n Even uncles and cousins. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47164.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
