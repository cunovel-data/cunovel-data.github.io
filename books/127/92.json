To her at least,his self-adopted epithet did not apply. Even he knew that. \\n\\n She said, in a voice as sleek as her hair and as cold as her eyes, \"Mygracious lord, I understand, has finally come to a decision upon the fateof the Foundation upstarts.\"\"Indeed?\" said the Commdor, sourly. \"And what more does your versatileunderstanding embrace?\"\"Enough, my very noble husband. You had another of your vacillatingconsultations with your councilors. Fine advisors.\" With infinite scorn, \"Aherd of palsied purblind idiots hugging their sterile profits close totheir sunken chests in the face of my father\u0027s displeasure.\"\"And who, my dear,\" was the mild response, \"is the excellent source fromwhich your understanding understands all this?\"The Commdora laughed shortly, \"If I told you, my source would be morecorpse than source.\"\"Well, you\u0027ll have your own way, as always.\" The Commdor shrugged andturned away. \"And as for your father\u0027s displeasure: I much fear me itextends to a niggardly refusal to supply more ships.\"\"More ships!\" She blazed away, hotly, \"And haven\u0027t you five? Don\u0027t deny it. \\n\\n I know you have five; and a sixth is promised.\"\"Promised for the last year.\"\"But one ?just one ?can blast that Foundation into stinking rubble. Justone! One, to sweep their little pygmy boats out of space.\"\"I couldn\u0027t attack their planet, even with a dozen.\"\"And how long would their planet hold out with their trade ruined, andtheir cargoes of toys and trash destroyed?\" \"Those toys and trash meanmoney,\" he sighed. \"A good deal of money.\"\"But if you had the Foundation itself, would you not have all itcontained\u0027? And if you had my father\u0027s respect and gratitude, would you nothave more than ever the Foundation could give you? It\u0027s been three years ? \\n\\n more ? since that barbarian came with his magic sideshow. It\u0027s longenough.\"\"My dear!\" The Commdor turned and faced her. \"I am growing old. I am weary. \\n\\n I lack the resilience to withstand your rattling mouth. You say you knowthat I have decided. Well, I have. It is over, and there is war betweenKorell and the Foundation.\"\"Well!\" The Commdora\u0027s figure expanded and her eyes sparkled, \"You learnedwisdom at last, though in your dotage. And now when you are master of thishinterland, you may be sufficiently respectable to be of some weight andimportance in the Empire. For one thing, we might leave this barbarousworld and attend the viceroy\u0027s court. Indeed we might.\"She swept out, with a smile, and a hand on her hip. Her hair gleamed in thelight. \\n\\n The Commdor waited, and then said to the closed door, with malignance andhate, \"And when I am master of what you call the hinterland, I may besufficiently respectable to do without your father\u0027s arrogance and hisdaughter\u0027s tongue. Completely ?without!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47315.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
