Her face was pale andcoldly formed and her black hair was drawn smoothly and tightly back. \\n\\n Her voice was tart. \"You are quite finished, my gracious and noble husband? \\n\\n Quite, quite finished? I suppose I may even enter the garden if I wish,now.\"\"There is no need for dramatics, Licia, my dear,\" said the Commdor, mildly. \\n\\n \"The young man will attend at dinner tonight, and you can speak with himall you wish and even amuse yourself by listening to all I say. Room willhave to be arranged for his men somewhere about the place. The stars grantthat they be few in numbers.\"\"Most likely they\u0027ll be great hogs of eaters who will eat meat by thequarter-animal and wine by the hogshead. And you will groan for two nightswhen you calculate the expense.\"\"Well now, perhaps I won\u0027t. Despite your opinion, the dinner is to be onthe most lavish scale.\"\"Oh, I see.\" She stared at him contemptuously. \"You are very friendly withthese barbarians. Perhaps that is why I was not to be permitted to attendyour conversation. Perhaps your little weazened soul is plotting to turnagainst my father.\"\"Not at all.\"\"Yes, I\u0027d be likely to believe you, wouldn\u0027t I?

I could havepicked a more proper man from the alleys and mudheaps of my native world.\"\"Well, now, I\u0027ll tell you what, my lady. Perhaps you would enjoy returningto your native world. Except that, to retain as a souvenir that portion ofyou with which I am best acquainted, I could have your tongue cut outfirst. And,\" he tolled his head, calculatingly, to one side, \"as a finalimproving touch to your beauty, your ears and the tip of your nose aswell.\"\"You wouldn\u0027t dare, you little pug-dog. My father would pulverize your toynation to meteoric dust. In fact, he might do it in any case, if I told himyou were treating with these barbarians.\"\"Hm-mmm. Well, there\u0027s no need for threats. You are free to question theman yourself tonight. Meanwhile, madam, keep your wagging tongue still.\"\"At your orders?\"\"Here, take this, then, and keep still.\"The band was about her waist and the necklace around her neck. He pushedthe knob himself and stepped back. \\n\\n The Commdora drew in her breath and held out her hands stiffly. Shefingered the necklace gingerly, and gasped again. \\n\\n The Commdor rubbed his hands with satisfaction and said, \"You may wear ittonight ?and I\u0027ll get you more.
