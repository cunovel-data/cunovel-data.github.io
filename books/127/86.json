{"id":3516,"no":86,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"Mallow relaxed for almost the first time in six months. He was on his backin the sunroom of his new house, stripped to the skin. His great, brownarms were thrown up and out, and the muscles tautened into a stretch, thenfaded into repose. \n The man beside him placed a cigar between Mallow\u0027s teeth and lit it. Hechamped on one of his own and said, \"You must be overworked. Maybe you needa long rest.\"\"Maybe I do, Jael, but I\u0027d rather rest in a council seat. Because I\u0027m goingto have that seat, and you\u0027re going to help me.\"Ankor Jael raised his eyebrows and said, \"How did I get into this?\"\"You got in obviously. Firstly, you\u0027re an old dog of a politico. Secondly,you were booted out of your cabinet seat by Jorane Sutt, the same fellowwho\u0027d rather lose an eyeball than see me in the council. You don\u0027t thinkmuch of my chances, do you?\"\"Not much,\" agreed the ex-Minister of Education. \"You\u0027re a Smyrnian.\"\"That\u0027s no legal bar. I\u0027ve had a lay education.\"\"Well, come now. Since when does prejudice follow any law but its own. Now,how about your own man ? this Jaim Twer? What does he say?\"\"He spoke about running me for council almost a year ago,\" replied Malloweasily, \"but I\u0027ve outgrown him. He couldn\u0027t have pulled it off in any case. \n Not enough depth. He\u0027s loud and forceful ?but that\u0027s only an expression ofnuisance value. I\u0027m off to put over a real coup. I need you. \"\"Jorane Sutt is the cleverest politician on the planet and he\u0027ll be againstyou. I don\u0027t claim to be able to outsmart him. And don\u0027t think he doesn\u0027tfight hard, and dirty.\"\"I\u0027ve got money.\"\"Mat helps. But it takes a lot to buy off prejudice, you dirty Smyrnian.\"\"I\u0027ll have a lot.\"\"Well, I\u0027ll look into the matter. But don\u0027t ever you crawl up on your hindlegs and bleat that I encouraged you in the matter. Who\u0027s that?\"Mallow pulled the corners of his mouth down, and said, \"Jorane Sutthimself, I think. He\u0027s early, and I can understand it. I抳e been dodginghim for a month. Look, Jael, get into the next room, and turn the speakeron low. I want you to listen.\"He helped the council member out of the room with a shove of his bare foot,then scrambled up and into a silk robe. The synthetic sunlight faded tonormal power. \n The secretary to the mayor entered stiffly, while the solemn major-domotiptoed the door shut behind him. \n Mallow fastened his belt and said, \"Take your choice of chairs, Sutt.\"Sutt barely cracked a flickering smile. The chair he chose was comfortablebut he did not relax into it. From its edge, he said, \"If you\u0027ll state yourterms to begin with, we\u0027ll get down to business.\"\"What terms?\"\"You wish to be coaxed? Well, then, what, for instance, did you do atKorell? Your report was incomplete.\"\"I gave it to you months ago. You were satisfied then.\"Yes,\" Sutt rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with one finger, \"but sincethen your activities have been significant. We know a good deal of whatyou\u0027re doing, Mallow. We know, exactly, how many factories you\u0027re puttingup; in what a hurry you\u0027re doing it; and how much it\u0027s costing you. Andthere\u0027s this palace you have,\" he gazed about him with a cold lack ofappreciation, \"which set you back considerably more than my annual salary;and a swathe you\u0027ve been cutting ?a very considerable and expensive swathe?through the upper layers of Foundation society.\"\"So? Beyond proving that you employ capable spies, what does it show?\"\"It shows you have money you didn\u0027t have a year ago. And that can showanything ? for instance, that a good deal went on at Korell that we knownothing of. Where are you getting your money?\"\"My dear Sutt, you can\u0027t really expect me to tell you.\"\"I don\u0027t.\"\"I didn\u0027t think you did. That\u0027s why I\u0027m going to tell you. It\u0027s straightfrom the treasure-chests of the Commdor of Korell.\"Sutt blinked. \n Mallow smiled and continued. \"Unfortunately for you, the money is quitelegitimate. I\u0027m a Master Trader and the money I received was a quantity ofwrought iron and chromite in exchange for a number of trinkets I was ableto supply him with. Fifty per cent of the profit is mine by hideboundcontract with the Foundation. The other half goes to the government at theend of the year when all good citizens pay their income tax.\"\"There was no mention of any trade agreement in your report.\"\"Nor was there any mention of what I had for breakfast that day, or thename of my current mistress, or any other irrelevant detail.\" Mallow\u0027ssmile was fading into a sneer. \"I was sent ?to quote yourself ?to keep myeyes open. They were never. shut. You wanted to find out what happened tothe captured Foundation merchant ships. I never saw or heard of them. Youwanted to find out if Korell had nuclear power. My report tells of nuclearblasters in the possession of the Commdor\u0027s private bodyguard. I saw noother signs. And the blasters I did see are relics of the old Empire, andmay be show-pieces that do not work, for all my knowledge. \n \"So far, I followed orders, but beyond that I was, and. still am, a freeagent. According to the laws of the Foundation, a Master Trader may openwhatever new markets he can, and receive therefrom his due half of theprofits. What are your objections? I don\u0027t see them.\"Sutt bent his eyes carefully towards the wall and spoke with a difficultlack of anger, \"It is the general custom of all traders to advance thereligion with their trade.\"\"I adhere to law, and not to custom.\"\"There are times when custom can be the higher law.\"\"Then appeal to the courts.\"Sutt raised somber eyes which seemed to retreat into their sockets. \"You\u0027rea Smyrnian after all. It seems naturalization and education can\u0027t wipe outthe taint in the blood. Listen, and try to understand, just the same. \n \"This goes beyond money, or markets. We have the science of the great HariSeldon to prove that upon us depends the future empire of the Galaxy, andfrom the course that leads to that Imperium we cannot turn. The religion wehave is our all-important instrument towards that end. With it we havebrought the Four Kingdoms under our control, even at the moment when theywould have crushed us. It is the most potent device known with which tocontrol men and worlds. \n \"The primary reason for the development of trade and traders was tointroduce and spread this religion more quickly, and to insure that theintroduction of new techniques and a new economy would be subject to ourthorough and intimate control.\"He paused for breath, and Mallow interjected quietly, \"I know the theory. Iunderstand it entirely.\"\"Do you? It is more than I expected. Then you see, of course, that yourattempt at trade for its own sake; at mass production of worthless gadgets,which can only affect a world\u0027s economy superficially; at the subversion ofinterstellar policy to the god of profits; at the divorce of nuclear powerfrom our controlling religion ? can only end with the overthrow andcomplete negation of the policy that has worked successfully for acentury.\"\"And time enough, too,\" said Mallow, indifferently, \"for a policy outdated,dangerous and impossible. However well your religion has succeeded in theFour Kingdoms, scarcely another world in the Periphery has accepted it. Atthe time we seized control of the Kingdoms, there were a sufficient numberof exiles, Galaxy knows, to spread the story of how Salvor Hardin used thepriesthood and the superstition of the people to overthrow the independenceand power of the secular monarchs. And if that wasn\u0027t enough, the case ofAskone two decades back made it plain enough. There isn\u0027t a ruler in thePeriphery now that wouldn\u0027t sooner cut his own throat than let a priest ofthe Foundation enter the territory. \n \"I don\u0027t propose to force Korell or any other world to accept something Iknow they don\u0027t want. No, Sutt. If nuclear power makes them dangerous, asincere friendship through trade will be many times better than an insecureoverlordship, based on the hated supremacy of a foreign spiritual power,which, once it weakens ever so slightly, can only fall entirely and leavenothing substantial behind except an immortal fear and hate.\"Suit said cynically, \"Very nicely put. So, to get back to the originalpoint of discussion, what are your terms? What do you require to exchangeyour ideas for mine?\"\"You think my convictions are for sale?\"\"Why not?\" came the cold response. \"Isn\u0027t that your business, buying andselling?\"\"Only at a profit,\" said Mallow, unoffended. \"Can you offer me more thanI\u0027m getting as is?\"\"You could have three-quarters of your trade profits, rather than half.\"Mallow laughed shortly, \"A fine offer. The whole of the trade on your termswould fall far below ?a tenth share on mine. Try harder than that.\"\"You could have a council seat.\"\"I\u0027ll have that anyway, without and despite you.\"With a sudden movement, Sutt clenched his fist, \"You could also saveyourself a prison term. Of twenty years, if I have my way. Count the profitin that.\"\"No profit at all, but can you fulfill such a threat?\"\"How about a trial for murder?\"\"Whose murder?\" asked Mallow, contemptuously. \n Sutt\u0027s voice was harsh now, though no louder than before, \"The murder of anAnacreonian priest, in the service of the Foundation.\"\"Is that so now? And what\u0027s your evidence?\"The secretary to the mayor leaned forward, \"Mallow, I\u0027m not bluffing. Thepreliminaries are over. I have only to sign one final paper and the case ofthe Foundation versus Hober Mallow, Master Trader, is begun. You abandoneda subject of the Foundation to torture and death at the hands of an alienmob, Mallow, and you have only five seconds to prevent the punishment dueyou. For myself, I\u0027d rather you decided to bluff it out. You\u0027d be safer asa destroyed enemy, than as a doubtfully-converted friend.\"Mallow said solemnly, \"You have your wish.\"\"Good!\" and the secretary smiled savagely. \"It was the mayor who wished thepreliminary attempt at compromise, not I. Witness that I did not try toohard.\"The door opened before him, and he left. \n Mallow looked up as Ankor Jael re-entered the room. \n Mallow said, \"Did you hear him?\"The politician flopped to the floor. \"I never heard him as angry as that,since I\u0027ve known the snake.\"\"All right. What do you make of it?\"\"Well, I\u0027ll tell you. A foreign policy of domination through spiritualmeans is his idee fixe, but it\u0027s my notion that his ultimate aims aren\u0027tspiritual. I was fired out of the Cabinet for arguing on the same issue, asI needn\u0027t tell you.\"\"You needn\u0027t. And what are those unspiritual aims according to yournotion?\"Jael grew serious, \"Well, he\u0027s not stupid, so he must see the bankruptcy ofour religious policy, which has hardly made a single conquest for us inseventy years. He\u0027s obviously using it for purposes of his own. \n \"Now any dogma primarily based on faith and emotionalism, is a dangerousweapon to use on others, since it is almost impossible to guarantee thatthe weapon will never be turned on the user. For a hundred years now, we\u0027vesupported a ritual and mythology that is becoming more and more venerable,traditional ? and immovable. In some ways, it isn\u0027t under our control anymore.\"\"In what ways?\" demanded Mallow. \"Don\u0027t stop. I want your thoughts.\"\"Well, suppose one man, one ambitious man, uses the force of religionagainst us, rather than for us.\"\"You mean Sutt? \n \"You\u0027re right. I mean Sutt. Listen, man, if he could mobilize the varioushierarchies on the subject planets against the Foundation in the name oforthodoxy, what chance would we stand? By planting himself at the head ofthe standards of the pious, he could make war on heresy, as represented byyou, for instance, and make himself king eventually. After all, it wasHardin who said: \u0027A nuclear blaster is a good weapon, but it can point bothways.\u0027\"Mallow slapped his bare thigh, \"All right, Jael, then get me in thatcouncil, and I\u0027ll fight him.\"Jael paused, then said significantly, \"Maybe not. What was all that abouthaving a priest lynched? Is isn\u0027t true, is it?\"\"It\u0027s true enough,\" Mallow said, carelessly. \n Jael whistled, \"Has he definite proof?\"\"He should have.\" Mallow hesitated, then added, \"Jaim Twer was his man fromthe beginning, though neither of them knew that I knew that. And Jaim Twerwas an eyewitness.\"Jael shook his head. \"Uh-uh. That\u0027s bad.\"\"Bad? What\u0027s bad about it? That priest was illegally upon the planet by theFoundation\u0027s own laws. He was obviously used by the Korellian government asa bait, whether involuntary or not. By all the laws of common-sense, I hadno choice but one action ?and that action was strictly within the law. Ifhe brings me to trial, he\u0027ll do nothing but make a prime fool of himself.\"And Jael shook his head again, \"No, Mallow, you\u0027ve missed it. I told you heplayed dirty. He\u0027s not out to convict you; he knows he can\u0027t do that. Buthe is out to ruin your standing with the people. You heard what he said. \n Custom is higher than law, at times. You could walk out of the trialscot-free, but if the people think you threw a priest to the dogs, yourpopularity is gone. \n \"They\u0027ll admit you did the legal thing, even the sensible thing. But justthe same you\u0027ll have been, in their eyes, a cowardly dog, an unfeelingbrute, a hard-hearted monster. And you would never get elected to thecouncil. You might even lose your rating as Master Trader by having yourcitizenship voted away from you. You\u0027re not native born, you know. Whatmore do you think Sutt can want?\" Mallow frowned stubbornly, \"So!\" \"Myboy,\" said Jael. \"I\u0027ll stand by you, but I can\u0027t help. You\u0027re on the spot,杁ead center.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47258.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
