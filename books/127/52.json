{"id":3482,"no":52,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"Two weeks gone! Two weeks wasted. One week to reach Askone, at the extreme borders of which the vigilantwarships speared out to meet him in converging numbers. Whatever theirdetection system was, it worked ?and well. They sidled him in slowly, without a signal, maintaining their colddistance, and pointing him harshly towards the central sun of Askone. Ponyets could have handled them at a pinch. Those ships were holdovers fromthe dead-and-gone Galactic Empire ? but they were sports cruisers, notwarships; and without nuclear weapons, they were so many picturesque andimpotent ellipsoids. But Eskel Gorov was a prisoner in their hands, andGorov was not a hostage to lose. The Askonians must know that. And then another week ?a week to wind a weary way through the clouds ofminor officials that formed the buffer between the Grand Master and theouter world. Each little sub-secretary required soothing and conciliation. Each required careful and nauseating milking for the flourishing signaturethat was the pathway to the next official one higher up. For the first time, Ponyets found his trader\u0027s identification papersuseless. I Now, at last, the Grand Master was on the other side of the Guard-flankedgilded door ?and two weeks had gone. Gorov was still a prisoner and Ponyets\u0027 cargo rotted useless in the holdsof his ship. The Grand Master was a small man; a small man with a balding head and verywrinkled face, whose body seemed weighed down to motionlessness by thehuge, glossy fur collar about his neck. His fingers moved on either side, and the line of armed men backed away tofor a passage, along which Ponyets strode to the foot of the Chair ofState. \"Don\u0027t speak,\" snapped the Grand Master, and Ponyets\u0027 opening lips closedtightly. \"That\u0027s right,\" the Askonian ruler relaxed visibly, \"I can\u0027t endure uselesschatter. You cannot threaten and I won\u0027t abide flattery. Nor is there roomfor injured complaints. I have lost count of the times you wanderers havebeen warned that your devil\u0027s machines are not wanted anywhere in Askone.\"\"Sir,\" said Ponyets, quietly, \"there is no attempt to justify the trader inquestion. It is not the policy of traders to intrude where they are notwanted. But the Galaxy is great, and it has happened before that a boundaryhas been trespassed unwittingly. It was a deplorable mistake.\"\"Deplorable, certainly,\" squeaked the Grand Master. \"But mistake? Yourpeople on Glyptal IV have been bombarding me with pleas for negotiationsince two hours after the sacrilegious wretch was seized. I have beenwarned by them of your own coming many times over. It seems awell-organized rescue campaign. Much seems to have been anticipated ?alittle too much for mistakes, deplorable or otherwise.\"The Askonian\u0027s black eyes were scornful. He raced on, \"And are you traders,flitting from world to world like mad little butterflies, so mad in yourown right that you can land on Askone\u0027s largest world, in the center of itssystem, and consider it an unwitting boundary mixup? Come, surely not.\"Ponyets winced without showing it. He said, doggedly, \"If the attempt totrade was deliberate, your Veneration, it was most injudicious and contraryto the strictest regulations of our Guild.\"\"Injudicious, yes,\" said the Askonian, curtly. \"So much so, that yourcomrade is likely to lose life in payment.\"Ponyets\u0027 stomach knotted. There was no irresolution there. He said, \"Death,your Veneration, is so absolute and irrevocable a phenomenon that certainlythere must be some alternative.\"There was a pause before the guarded answer came, \"I have heard that theFoundation is rich.\"\"Rich? Certainly. But our riches are that which you refuse to take. Ournuclear goods are worth? \"Your goods are worthless in that they lack the ancestral blessing. Yourgoods are wicked and accursed in that they lie under the ancestralinterdict.\" The sentences were intoned; the recitation of a formula. The Grand Master\u0027s eyelids dropped, and he said with meaning, \"You havenothing else of value?\"The meaning was lost on the trader, \"I don\u0027t understand. What is it youwant?\"The Askonian\u0027s hands spread apart, \"You ask me to trade places with you,and make known to you my wants. I think not. Your colleague, it seems, mustsuffer the punishment set for sacrilege by the Askonian code. Death by gas. We are a just people. The poorest peasant, in like case, would suffer nomore. I, myself, would suffer no less.\"Ponyets mumbled hopelessly, \"Your Veneration, would it be permitted that Ispeak to the prisoner?\"\"Askonian law,\" said the Grand Master coldly, \"allows no communication witha condemned man.\"Mentally, Ponyets held his breath, \"Your Veneration, I ask you to bemerciful towards a man\u0027s soul, in the hour when his body stands forfeit. Hehas been separated from spiritual consolation in all the time that his lifehas been in danger. Even now, he faces the prospect of going unprepared tothe bosom of the Spirit that rules all.\"The Grand Master said slowly and suspiciously, \"You are a Tender of theSoul?\"Ponyets dropped a humble head, \"I have been so trained. In the emptyexpanses of space, the wandering traders need men like myself to care forthe spiritual side of a life so given over to commerce and worldlypursuits.\"The Askonian ruler sucked thoughtfully at his lower lip. \"Every man shouldprepare his soul for his journey to his ancestral spirits. Yet I had neverthought you traders to be believers.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47224.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
