{"id":3518,"no":88,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"The council chamber was full in a very literal sense on the fourth day ofthe trial of Hober Mallow, Master Trader. The only councilman absent wasfeebly cursing the fractured skull that had bedridden him. The gallerieswere filled to the aisleways and ceilings with those few of the crowd whoby influence, wealth, or sheer diabolic perseverance had managed to get in. \\n\\n The rest filled the square outside, in swarming knots about the open-airtrimensional \u0027visors. \\n\\n Ankor Jael made his way into the chamber with the near-futile aid andexertions of the police department, and then through the scarcely smallerconfusion within to Hober Mallow\u0027s seat. \\n\\n Mallow turned with relief, \"By Seldon, you cut it thin. Have you got it?\"\"Here, take it,\" said Jael. \"It\u0027s everything you asked for.\"\"Good. How are they taking it outside?\"\"They\u0027re wild clear through.\" Jael stirred uneasily, \"You should never haveallowed public hearings. You could have stopped them.\"\"I didn\u0027t want to.\"\"There\u0027s lynch talk. And Publis Manlio\u0027s men on the outer planets? \\n\\n \"I wanted to ask you about that, Jael. He\u0027s stirring up the Hierarchyagainst me, is he?\"\" Is he? It\u0027s the sweetest setup you ever saw, As Foreign Secretary, hehandles the prosecution in a case of interstellar law. As High Priest andPrimate of the Church, he rouses the fanatic hordes? \\n\\n \"Well, forget it. Do you remember that Hardin quotation you threw at melast month? We\u0027ll show them that the nuclear blaster can point both ways.\"The mayor was taking his seat now and the council members were rising inrespect. \\n\\n Mallow whispered, \"It\u0027s my turn today. Sit here and watch the fun.\"The day\u0027s proceedings began and fifteen minutes later, Hober Mallow steppedthrough a hostile whisper to the empty space before the mayor\u0027s bench. Alone beam of light centered upon him and in the public \u0027visors of the city,as well as on the myriads of private \u0027visors in almost every home of theFoundation\u0027s planets, the lonely giant figure of a man stared outdefiantly. \\n\\n He began easily and quietly, \"To save time, I will admit the truth of everypoint made against me by the prosecution. The story of the priest and themob as related by them is perfectly accurate in every detail.\"There was a stirring in the chamber and a triumphant mass-snarl from thegallery. He waited patiently for silence. \\n\\n \"However, the picture they presented fell short of completion. I ask theprivilege of supplying the completion in my own fashion. My story may seemirrelevant at first. I ask your indulgence for that.\"Mallow made no reference to the notes before him. \\n\\n \"I begin at the same time as the prosecution did; the day of my meetingwith Jorane Sutt and Jaim Twer. What went on at those meetings you know. \\n\\n The conversations have been described, and to that description I havenothing to add ?except my own thoughts of that day. \\n\\n \"They were suspicious thoughts, for the events of that day were queer. \\n\\n Consider. Two people, neither of whom I knew more than casually, makeunnatural and somewhat unbelievable propositions to me. One, the secretaryto the mayor, asks me to play the part of intelligence agent to thegovernment in a highly confidential matter, the nature and importance ofwhich has already been explained to you. The other, self-styled leader of apolitical party, asks me to run for a council seat. \\n\\n \"Naturally I looked for the ulterior motive. Sutt\u0027s seemed evident. Hedidn\u0027t trust me. Perhaps he thought I was selling nuclear power to enemiesand plotting rebellion. And perhaps he was forcing the issue, or thought hewas. In that case, he would need a man of his own near me on my proposedmission, as a spy. The last thought, however, did not occur to me untillater on, when Jaim Twer came on the scene. \\n\\n \"Consider again: Twer presents himself as a trader, retired into politics,yet I know of no details of his trading career, although my knowledge ofthe field is immense. And further, although Twer boasted of a layeducation, he had never heard of a Seldon crisis.\"Hober Mallow waited to let the significance sink in and was rewarded withthe first silence he had yet encountered, as the gallery caught itscollective breath. That was for the inhabitants of Terminus itself. The menof the Outer Planets could hear only censored versions that would suit therequirements of religion. They would hear nothing of Seldon crises. Butthere would be further strokes they would not miss. \\n\\n Mallow continued: \\n\\n \"Who here can honestly state that any man with a lay education can possiblybe ignorant of the nature of a Seldon crisis? There is only one type ofeducation upon the Foundation that excludes all mention of the plannedhistory of Seldon and deals only with the man himself as a semi-mythicalwizard? \\n\\n \"I knew at that instant that Jaim Twer had never been a trader. I knew thenthat he was in holy orders and perhaps a full-fledged priest; and,doubtless, that for the three years he had pretended to head a politicalparty of the traders, he had been a bought man of Jorane Sutt. \\n\\n \"At the moment, I struck in the dark. I did not know Sun\u0027s purposes withregard to myself, but since he seemed to be feeding me rope liberally, Ihanded him a few fathoms of my own. My notion was that Twer was to be withme on my voyage as unofficial guardian on behalf of Jorane Sutt. Well, ifhe didn\u0027t get on, I knew well there\u0027d be other devices waiting ?and thoseothers I might not catch in time. A known enemy is relatively safe. Iinvited Twer to come with me. He accepted. \\n\\n \"That, gentlemen of the council, explains two things. First, it tells youthat Twer is not a friend of mine testifying against me reluctantly and forconscience\u0027 sake, as the prosecution would have you believe. He is a spy,performing his paid job. Secondly, it explains a certain action of mine onthe occasion of the first appearance of the priest whom I am accused ofhaving murdered ? an action as yet unmentioned, because unknown.\"Now there was a disturbed whispering in the council. Mallow cleared histhroat theatrically, and continued: \\n\\n \"I hate to describe my feelings when I first heard that we had a refugeemissionary on board. I even hate to remember them. Essentially, theyconsisted of wild uncertainty. The event struck me at the moment as a moveby Sutt, and passed beyond my comprehension or calculation. I was at sea ? \\n\\n and completely. \\n\\n \"There was one thing I could do. I got rid of Twer for five minutes bysending him after my officers. In his absence, I set up a Visual Recordreceiver, so that whatever happened might be preserved for future study. \\n\\n This was in the hope, the wild but earnest hope, that what confused me atthe time might become plain upon review. \\n\\n \"I have gone over that Visual Record some fifty times since. I have it herewith me now, and will repeat the job a fifty-first time in your presenceright now.\"The mayor pounded monotonously for order, as the chamber lost itsequilibrium and the gallery roared. In five million homes on Terminus,excited observers crowded their receiving sets more closely, and at theprosecutor\u0027s own bench, Jorane Sutt shook his head coldly at the nervoushigh priest, while his eyes blazed fixedly on Mallow\u0027s face. \\n\\n The center of the chamber was cleared, and the lights burnt low. AnkorJael, from his bench on the left, made the adjustments, and with apreliminary click, a holographic scene sprang to view; in color, inthree-dimensions, in every attribute of life but life itself. \\n\\n There was the missionary, confused and battered, standing between thelieutenant and the sergeant. Mallow\u0027s image waited silently, and then menfiled in, Twer bringing up the rear. \\n\\n The conversation played itself out, word for word. The sergeant wasdisciplined, and the missionary was questioned. The mob appeared, theirgrowl could be heard, and the Revered Jord Parma made his wild appeal. \\n\\n Mallow drew his gun, and the missionary, as he was dragged away, lifted hisarms in a mad, final curse and a tiny flash of light came and went. \\n\\n The scene ended, with the officers frozen at the horror of the situation,while Twer clamped shaking hands over his ears, and Mallow calmly put hisgun away. \\n\\n The lights were on again; the empty space in the center of the floor was nolonger even apparently full. Mallow, the real Mallow of the present, tookup the burden of his narration: \\n\\n \"The incident, you see, is exactly as the prosecution has presented it ?onthe surface. I\u0027ll explain that shortly. Jaim Twer\u0027s emotions through thewhole business shows clearly a priestly education, by the way. \\n\\n \"It was on that same day that I pointed out certain incongruities in theepisode to Twer. I asked him where the missionary came from in the midst ofthe near-desolate tract we occupied at the time. I asked further where thegigantic mob had come from with the nearest sizable town a hundred milesaway. The prosecution has paid no attention to such problems. \\n\\n \"Or to other points; for instance, the curious point of Jord Parma\u0027sblatant conspicuousness. A missionary on Korell, risking his life indefiance of both Korellian and Foundation law, parades about in a very newand very distinctive priestly costume. There\u0027s something wrong there. Atthe time, I suggested that the missionary was an unwitting accomplice ofthe Commdor, who was using him in an attempt to force us into an act ofwildly illegal aggression, to justify, in law, his subsequent destructionof our ship and of us. \\n\\n \"The prosecution has anticipated this justification of my actions. Theyhave expected me to explain that the safety of my ship, my crew, my missionitself were at stake and could not be sacrificed for one man, when that manwould, in any case, have been destroyed, with us or without us. They replyby muttering about the Foundation\u0027s \u0027honor\u0027 and the necessity of upholdingour \u0027dignity\u0027 in order to maintain our ascendancy. \\n\\n \"For some strange reason, however, the prosecution has neglected Jord Parmahimself, 朼s an individual. They brought out no details concerning him;neither his birthplace, nor his education, nor any detail of previoushistory. The explanation of this will also explain the incongruities I havepointed out in the Visual Record you have just seen. The two are connected. \\n\\n \"The prosecution has advanced no details concerning Jord Parma because itcannot. That scene you saw by Visual Record seemed phoney because JordParma was phoney. There never was a Jord Parma. This whole trial is thebiggest farce ever cooked up over an issue that never existed.\"Once more he had to wait for the babble to die down. He said, slowly: \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to show you the enlargement of a single still from the VisualRecord. It will speak for itself. Lights again, Jael.\"The chamber dimmed, and the empty air filled again with frozen figures inghostly, waxen illusion. The officers of the Far Star struck their stiff,impossible attitudes. A gun pointed from Mallow\u0027s rigid hand. At his left,the Revered Jord Parma, caught in mid-shriek, stretched his claws upward,while the failing sleeves hung halfway. \\n\\n And from the missionary\u0027s hand there was that little gleam that in theprevious showing had flashed and gone. It was a permanent glow now. \\n\\n \"Keep your eye on that light on his hand,\" called Mallow from the shadows. \\n\\n \"Enlarge that scene, Jael!\"The tableau bloated quickly. Outer portions fell away as the missionarydrew towards the center and became a giant. Then there was only a hand andan arm, and then only a hand, which filled everything and remained there inimmense, hazy tautness. \\n\\n The light had become a set of fuzzy, glowing letters: K S P. \\n\\n \"That,\" Mallow\u0027s voice boomed out, \"is a sample of tatooing, gentlemen. \\n\\n Under ordinary light it is invisible, but under ultraviolet light ?withwhich I flooded the room in taking this Visual Record, it stands out inhigh relief. I\u0027ll admit it is a naive method of secret identification, butit works on Korell, where UV light is not to be found on street comers. \\n\\n Even in our ship, detection was accidental. \\n\\n \"Perhaps some of you have already guessed what K S P stands for. Jord Parmaknew his priestly lingo well and did his job magnificently. Where he hadlearned it, and how, I cannot say, but K S P stands for \u0027Korellian SecretPolice.\u0027\"Mallow shouted over the tumult, roaring against the noise, \"I havecollateral proof in the form of documents brought from Korell, which I canpresent to the council if required. \\n\\n \"And where is now the prosecution\u0027s case? They have already made andre-made the monstrous suggestion that I should have fought for themissionary in defiance of the law, and sacrificed my mission, my ship, andmyself to the \u0027honor\u0027 of the Foundation. \\n\\n \"But to do it for an impostor? \\n\\n \"Should I have done it then for a Korellian secret agent tricked out in therobes and verbal gymnastics probably borrowed of an Anacreonian exile? \\n\\n Would Jorane Sutt and Publis Manlio have had me fall into a stupid, odioustrap? \\n\\n His hoarsened voice faded into the featureless background of a shoutingmob. He was being lifted onto shoulders, and carried to the mayor\u0027s bench. \\n\\n Out the windows, he could see a torrent of madmen swarming into the squareto add to the thousands there already. \\n\\n Mallow looked about for Ankor Jael, but it was impossible to find anysingle face in the incoherence of the mass. Slowly he became aware of arhythmic, repeated shout, that was spreading from a small beginning, andpulsing into insanity: \\n\\n \"Long live Mallow ? long live Mallow ? long live Mallow? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47260.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
