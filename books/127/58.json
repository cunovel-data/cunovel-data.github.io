{"id":3488,"no":58,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"Another week rubbed away before the meeting with Pherl was arranged. \n Ponyets felt the tension, but he was used to the feeling of physicalhelplessness now. He had left city limits under guard. He was in Pherl\u0027ssuburban villa under guard. There was nothing to do but accept it withouteven looking over his shoulder. \n Pherl was taller and younger outside the circle of Elders. In nonformalcostume, he seemed no Elder at all. \n He said abruptly, \"You\u0027re a peculiar man.\" His close-set eyes seemed toquiver. \"You\u0027ve done nothing this last week, and particularly these lasttwo hours, but imply that I need gold. It seems useless labor, for who doesnot? Why not advance one step?\"\"It is not simply gold,\" said Ponyets, discreetly. \"Not simply gold. Notmerely a coin or two. It is rather all that lies behind gold.\"\"Now what can lie behind gold?\" prodded Pherl, with a down-curved smile. \n \"Certainly this is not the preliminary of another clumsy demonstration.\"\"Clumsy?\" Ponyets frowned slightly. \n \"Oh, definitely.\" Pherl folded his hands and nudged them gently with hischin. \"I don\u0027t criticize you. The clumsiness was on purpose, I am sure. Imight have warned his Veneration of that, had I been certain of the motive. \n Now had I been you, I would have produced the gold upon my ship, andoffered it alone. The show you offered us and the antagonism you arousedwould have been dispensed with.\"\"True,\" Ponyets admitted, \"but since I was myself, I accepted theantagonism for the sake of attracting your attention.\"\"Is that it? Simply that?\" Pherl made no effort to hide his contemptuousamusement. \"And I imagine you suggested the thirty-day purification periodthat you might assure yourself time to turn the attraction into something abit more substantial. But what if the gold turns out to be impure?\"Ponyets allowed himself a dark humor in return, \"When the judgement of thatimpurity depends upon those who are most interested in finding it pure?\"Pherl lifted his eyes and stared narrowly at the trader. He seemed at oncesurprised and satisfied. \n \"A sensible point. Now tell me why you wished to attract me.\"\"This I will do. In the short time I have been here, I have observed usefulfacts that concern you and interest me. For instance, you are young-veryyoung for a member of the council, and even of a relatively young family.\"\"You criticize my family?\"\"Not at all. Your ancestors are great and holy; all will admit that. Butthere are those that say you are not a member of one of the Five Tribes.\"Pherl leaned back, \"With all respect to those involved,\" and he did nothide his venom, \"the Five Tribes have impoverished loins and thin blood. \n Not fifty members of the Tribes are alive.\"\"Yet there are those who say the nation would not be willing to see any manoutside the Tribes as Grand Master. And so young and newly-advanced afavorite of the Grand Master is bound to make powerful enemies among thegreat ones of the State ?it is said. His Veneration is aging and hisprotection will not last past his death, when it is an enemy of yours whowill undoubtedly be the one to interpret the words of his Spirit.\"Pherl scowled, \"For a foreigner you hear much. Such ears are made forcropping.\"\"That may be decided later.\"\"Let me anticipate.\" Pherl stirred impatiently in his seat. \"You\u0027re goingto offer me wealth and power in terms of those evil little machines youcarry in your ship. Well?\"\"Suppose it so. What would be your objection? Simply your standard of goodand evil?\"Pherl shook his head. \"Not at all. Look, my Outlander, your opinion of usin your heathen agnosticism is what it is ?but I am not the entire slaveof our mythology, though I may appear so. I am an educated man, sir, and, Ihope, an enlightened one. The full depth of our religious customs, in theritualistic rather than the ethical sense, is for the masses.\"\"Your objection, then?\" pressed Ponyets, gently. \n \"Just that. The masses. I might be willing to deal with you, but yourlittle machines must be used to be useful. How might riches come to me, ifI had to use ?what is it you sell??well, a razor, for instance, only inthe strictest, trembling secrecy. Even if my chin were more simply and morecleanly shaven, how would I become rich? And how would I avoid death by gaschamber or mob frightfulness if I were ever once caught using it?\"Ponyets shrugged, \"You are correct. I might point out that the remedy wouldbe to educate your own people into the use of nucleics for theirconvenience and your own substantial profit. It would be a gigantic pieceof work; I don\u0027t deny it; but the returns would be still more gigantic. \n Still that is your concern, and, at the moment, not mine at all. For Ioffer neither razor, knife, nor mechanical garbage disposer.\"\"What do you offer?\"\"Gold itself. Directly. You may have the machine I demonstrated last week.\"And now Pherl stiffened and the skin on his forehead moved jerkily. \"Thetransmuter?\"\"Exactly. Your supply of gold will equal your supply of iron. That, Iimagine, is sufficient for all needs. Sufficient for the Grand Mastershipitself, despite youth and enemies. And it is safe.\"\"In what way?\"\"In that secrecy is the essence of its use; that same secrecy you describedas the only safety with regard to nucleics. You may bury the transmuter inthe deepest dungeon of the strongest fortress on your furthest estate, andit will still bring you instant wealth. It is the gold you buy, not themachine, and that gold bears no trace of its manufacture, for it cannot betold from the natural creation.\"\"And who is to operate the machine?\"\"Yourself. Five minutes teaching is all you will require. I\u0027ll set it upfor you wherever you wish.\"\"And in return?\"\"Well,\" Ponyets grew cautious. \"I ask a price and a handsome one. It is myliving. Let us say,?for it its a valuable machine ?the equivalent of acubic foot of gold in wrought iron.\"Pherl laughed, and Ponyets grew red. \"I point out, sir,\" he added, stiffly,\"that you can get your price back in two hours.\"\"True, and in one hour, you might be gone, and my machine might suddenlyturn out to be useless. I\u0027ll need a guarantee.\"\"You have my word.\"\"A very good one,\" Pherl bowed sardonically, \"but your presence would be aneven better assurance. I\u0027ll give you my word to pay you one week afterdelivery in working order.\"\"Impossible.\"\"Impossible? When you\u0027ve already incurred the death penalty very handily byeven offering to sell me anything. The only alternative is my word thatyou\u0027ll get the gas chamber tomorrow otherwise.\"Ponyet\u0027s face was expressionless, but his eyes might have flickered. Hesaid, \"It is an unfair advantage. You will at least put your promise inwriting?\"\"And also become liable for execution? No, sir!\" Pherl smiled a broadsatisfaction. \"No, sir! Only one of us is a fool.\"The trader said in a small voice, \"It is agreed, then.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47230.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
