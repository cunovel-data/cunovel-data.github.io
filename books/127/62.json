{"id":3492,"no":62,"title":"PART V THE MERCHANT PRINCES","content":"TRADERS-... With psychohistoric inevitability. economic control of theFoundation grew. The traders grew rich; and with riches came power.... It is sometimes forgotten that Hober Mallow began life as an ordinarytrader. It is never forgotten that he ended it as the first of the MerchantPrinces.... ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICAJorane Sutt put the tips of carefully-manicured fingers together and said,\"It\u0027s something of a puzzle. In fact ?and this is in the strictest ofconfidence ? it may be another one of Hari Seldon\u0027s crises.\"The man opposite felt in the pocket of his short Smyrnian jacket for acigarette. \"Don\u0027t know about that, Sutt. As a general rule, politiciansstart shouting \u0027Seldon crisis\u0027 at every mayoralty campaign.\"Sutt smiled very faintly, \"I\u0027m not campaigning, Mallow. We\u0027re facingnuclear weapons, and we don\u0027t know where they\u0027re coming from.\"Hober Mallow of Smyrno, Master Trader, smoked quietly, almostindifferently. \"Go on. If you have more to say, get it out.\" Mallow nevermade the mistake of being overpolite to a Foundation man. He might be anOutlander, but a man\u0027s a man for a?that. Sutt indicated the trimensional star-map on the table. He adjusted thecontrols and a cluster of some half-dozen stellar systems blazed red. \u0027That,\" he said quietly, \"is the Korellian Republic.\"The trader nodded, \"I\u0027ve been there. Stinking rathole! I suppose you cancall it a republic but it\u0027s always someone out of the Argo family that getselected Commdor each time. And if you ever don\u0027t like it ?things happen toyou.\" He twisted his lip and repeated, \"I\u0027ve been there.\"\"But you\u0027ve come back, which hasn\u0027t always happened. Three trade ships,inviolate under the Conventions, have disappeared within the territory ofthe Republic in the last year. And those ships were armed with all theusual nuclear explosives and force-field defenses.\"\"What was the last word heard from the ships?\"\"Routine reports. Nothing else.\"\"What did Korell say?\"Sutt\u0027s eyes gleamed sardonically, \"There was no way of asking. TheFoundation\u0027s greatest asset throughout the Periphery is its reputation ofpower. Do you think we can lose three ships and ask for them?\"\"Well, then, suppose you tell me what you want with me.\"Jorane Sutt did not waste his time in the luxury of annoyance. As secretaryto the mayor, he had held off opposition councilmen, jobseekers, reformers,and crackpots who claimed to have solved in its entirety the course offuture history as worked out by Hari Seldon. With training like that, ittook a good deal to disturb him. He said methodically, \"In a moment. You see, three ships lost in the samesector in the same year can\u0027t be accident, and nuclear power can beconquered only by more nuclear power. The question automatically arises: ifKorell has nuclear weapons, where is it getting them?\"\"And where does it?\"\"Two alternatives. Either the Korellians have constructed them themselves? \"Far-fetched!\"\"Very! But the other possibility is that we are being afflicted with a caseof treason.\"\"You think so?\" Mallow\u0027s voice was cold. The secretary said calmly, \"There\u0027s nothing miraculous about thepossibility. Since the Four Kingdoms accepted the Foundation Convention, wehave had to deal with considerable groups of dissident populations in eachnation. Each former kingdom has its pretenders and its former noblemen, whocan\u0027t very well pretend to love the Foundation. Some of them are becomingactive, perhaps.\"Mallow was a dull red. \"I see. Is there anything you want to say to me? I\u0027ma Smyrnian.\"\"I know. You\u0027re a Smyrnian ? born in Smyrno, one of the former FourKingdoms. You\u0027re a Foundation man by education only. By birth, you\u0027re anOutlander and a foreigner. No doubt your grandfather was a baron at thetime of the wars with Anacreon and Loris, and no doubt your family estateswere taken away when Sef Sermak redistributed the land.\"\"No, by Black Space, no! My grandfather was a blood-poor son-of-a-spacerwho died heaving coal at starving wages before the Foundation took over. Iowe nothing to the old regime. But I was born in Smyrno, and I\u0027m notashamed of either Smyrno or Smyrnians, by the Galaxy. Your sly little hintsof treason aren\u0027t going to panic me into licking Foundation spittle. Andnow you can either give your orders or make your accusations. I don\u0027t carewhich.\"\"My good Master Trader, I don\u0027t care an electron whether your grandfatherwas King of Smyrno or the greatest pauper on the planet. I recited thatrigmarole about your birth and ancestry to show you that I\u0027m not interestedin them. Evidently, you missed the point. Let\u0027s go back now. You\u0027re aSmyrnian. You know the Outlanders. Also, you\u0027re a trader and one of thebest. You\u0027ve been to Korell and you know the Korellians. That\u0027s whereyou\u0027ve got to go.\"Mallow breathed deeply, \"As a spy?\"\"Not at all. As a trader ?but with your eyes open. If you can find outwhere the power is coming from ?I might remind you, since you\u0027re aSmyrnian, that two of those lost trade ships had Smyrnian crews.\"\"When do I start?\"\"When will your ship be ready?\"\"In six days.\"\"Then that\u0027s when you start. You\u0027ll have all the details at the Admiralty.\"\"Right!\" The trader rose, shook hands roughly, and strode out. Sutt waited, spreading his fingers gingerly and rubbing out the pressure;then shrugged his shoulders and stepped into the mayor\u0027s office. The mayor deadened the visiplate and leaned back. \"What do you make of it,Sutt?\"\"He could be a good actor,\" said Sutt, and stared thoughtfully ahead.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47234.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
