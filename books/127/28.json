He hadn\u0027t slept the night before and he had a good ideathat he wouldn\u0027t sleep this coming night. His eyes showed it. \n He said wearily, \"And that covers it?\"\"I think so.\" Yohan Lee put a hand to his chin. \"How does it sound?\"\"Not too bad. It\u0027s got to be done, you understand, with impudence. That is,there is to be no hesitation; no time to allow them to grasp the situation. \n Once we are in a position to give orders, why, give them as though you wereborn to do so, and they\u0027ll obey out of habit. That\u0027s the essence of acoup.\"\"If the Board remains irresolute for even ? \n \"The Board? Count them out. After tomorrow, their importance as a factor inTerminus affairs won\u0027t matter a rusty half-credit.\"Lee nodded slowly. \"Yet it is strange that they\u0027ve done nothing to stop usso far. You say they weren\u0027t entirely in the dark.\"\"Fara stumbles at the edges of the problem. Sometimes he makes me nervous. \n And Pirenne\u0027s been suspicious of me since I was elected. But, you see, theynever had the capacity of really understanding what was up. Their wholetraining has been authoritarian. They are sure that the Emperor, justbecause he is the Emperor, is all-powerful. And they are sure that theBoard of Trustees, simply because it is the Board of Trustees acting in thename of the Emperor, cannot be in a position where it does not give theorders. That incapacity to recognize the possibility of revolt is our bestally.\"He heaved out of his chair and went to the water cooler. \"They\u0027re not badfellows, Lee, when they stick to their Encyclopedia ?and we\u0027ll see thatthat\u0027s where they stick in the future. They\u0027re hopelessly incompetent whenit comes to ruling Terminus. Go away now and start things rolling. I wantto be alone.\"He sat down on the comer of his desk and stared at the cup of water. \n Space! If only he were as confident as he pretended! The Anacreonians werelanding in two days and what had he to go on but a set of notions andhalf-guesses as to what Had Seldon had been driving at these past fiftyyears? He wasn\u0027t even a real, honest-to-goodness psychologist ? just afumbler with a little training trying to outguess the greatest mind of theage. \n If Fara were fight; if Anacreon were all the problem Hari Seldon hadforeseen; if the Encyclopedia were all he was interested in preserving ? \n then what price coup d\u0027閠at? \n He shrugged and drank his water. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47156.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
