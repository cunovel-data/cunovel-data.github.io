{"id":3486,"no":56,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"\"A show!\" said the Grand Master, grimly. He settled himself well into hisfurs, and one thin hand grasped the iron cudgel he used as a cane. \"And gold, your Veneration.\"\"And gold,\" agreed the Grand Master, carelessly. Ponyets set the box down and opened it with as fine an appearance ofconfidence as he could manage. He felt alone in the face of universalhostility; the way he had felt out in space his first year. The semicircleof bearded councilors who faced him down, stared unpleasantly. Among themwas Pherl, the thin-faced favorite who sat next to the Grand Master instiff hostility. Ponyets had met him once already and marked himimmediately as prime enemy, and, as a consequence, prime victim. Outside the hall, a small army awaited events. Ponyets was effectivelyisolated from his ship; he lacked any weapon, but his attempted bribe; andGorov was still a hostage. He made the final adjustments on the clumsy monstrosity that had cost him aweek of ingenuity, and prayed once again that the lead-lined quartz wouldstand the strain. \"What is it?\" asked the Grand Master. \"This,\" said Ponyets, stepping back, \"is a small device I have constructedmyself.\"\"That is obvious, but it is not the information I want. Is it one of theblack-magic abominations of your world?\"\"It is nuclear in nature, admitted Ponyets, gravely, \"but none of you needtouch it, or have anything to do with it. It is for myself alone, and if itcontains abominations, I take the foulness of it upon myself.\"The Grand Master had raised his iron cane at the machine in a threateninggesture and his lips moved rapidly and silently in a purifying invocation. The thin-faced councilor at his right leaned towards him and his straggledred mustache approached the Grand Master\u0027s ear. The ancient Askonianpetulantly shrugged himself free. \"And what is the connection of your instrument of evil and the gold thatmay save your countryman\u0027s life?\"\"With this machine,\" began Ponyets, as his hand dropped softly onto thecentral chamber and caressed its hard, round flanks, \"I can turn the ironyou discard into gold of the finest quality. It is the only device known toman that will take iron ?the ugly iron, your Veneration, that props up thechair you sit in and the walls of this building ?and change it to shining,heavy, yellow gold.\"Ponyets felt himself botching it. His usual sales talk was smooth, facileand plausible; but this limped like a shot-up space wagon. But it was thecontent, not the form, that interested the Grand Master. \"So? Transmutation? Men have been fools who have claimed the ability. Theyhave paid for their prying sacrilege.\"\"Had they succeeded?\"\"No.\" The Grand Master seemed coldly amused. \"Success at producing goldwould have been a crime that carried its own antidote. It is the attemptplus the failure that is fatal. Here, what can you do with my staff?\" Hepounded the floor with it. \"Your Veneration will excuse me. My device is a small model, prepared bymyself, and your staff is too long.\"The Grand Master\u0027s small shining eye wandered and stopped, \"Randel, yourbuckles. Come, man, they shall be replaced double if need be.\"The buckles passed down the line, hand to hand. The Grand Master weighedthem thoughtfully. \"Here,\" he said, and threw them to the floor. Ponyets picked them up. He tugged hard before the cylinder opened, and hiseyes blinked and squinted with effort as he centered the buckles carefullyon the anode screen. Later, it would be easier but there must be nofailures the first time. The homemade transmuter crackled malevolently for ten minutes while theodor of ozone became faintly present. The Askonians backed away, muttering,and again Pherl whispered urgently into his ruler\u0027s ear. The Grand Master\u0027sexpression was stony. He did not budge. And the buckles were gold. Ponyets held them out to the Grand Master with a murmured, \"YourVeneration!\" but the old man hesitated, then gestured them away. His starelingered upon the transmuter. Ponyets said rapidly, \"Gentlemen, this is pure gold. Gold through andthrough. You may subject it to every known physical and chemical test, ifyou wish to prove the point. It cannot be identified fromnaturally-occurring gold in any way. Any iron can be so treated. Rust willnot interfere, not will a moderate amount of alloying metals? But Ponyets spoke only to fill a vacuum. He let the buckles remain in hisoutstretched hand, and it was the gold that argued for him. The Grand Master stretched out a slow hand at last, and the thin-facedPherl was roused to open speech. \"Your Veneration, the gold is from apoisoned source.\"And Ponyets countered, \"A rose can grow from the mud, your Veneration. Inyour dealings with your neighbors, you buy material of all imaginablevariety, without inquiring as to where they get it, whether from anorthodox machine blessed by your benign ancestors or from somespace-spawned outrage. Come, I don\u0027t offer the machine. I offer the gold.\"\"Your Veneration,\" said Pherl, \"you are not responsible for the sins offoreigners who work neither with your consent nor knowledge. But to acceptthis strange pseudo-gold made sinfully from iron in your presence and withyour consent is an affront to the living spirits of our holy ancestors.\"\"Yet gold is gold,\" said the Grand Master, doubtfully, \"and is but anexchange for the heathen person of a convicted felon. Pherl, you are toocritical.\" But he withdrew his hand. Ponyets said, \"You are wisdom, itself, your Veneration. Consider ?to giveup a heathen is to lose nothing for your ancestors, whereas with the goldyou get in exchange you can ornament the shrines of their holy spirits. Andsurely, were gold evil in itself, if such, a thing could be, the evil woulddepart of necessity once the metal were put to such pious use.\"\"Now by the bones of my grandfather,\" said the Grand Master with surprisingvehemence. His lips separated in a shrill laugh, \"Pherl, what do you say ofthis young man? The statement is valid. It is as valid as the words of myancestors.\"Pherl said gloomily, \"So it would seem. Grant that the validity does notturn out to be a device of the Malignant Spirit.\"\"I\u0027ll make it even better,\" said Ponyets, suddenly. \"Hold the gold inhostage. Place it on the altars of your ancestors as an offering and holdme for thirty days. If at the end of that time, there is no evidence ofdispleasure ? if no disasters occur ?surely, it would be proof that theoffering was accepted. What more can be offered?\"And when the Grand Master rose to his feet to search out disapproval, not aman in the council failed to signal his agreement. Even Pherl chewed theragged end of his mustache and nodded curtly. Ponyets smiled and meditated on the uses of a religious education.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47228.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
