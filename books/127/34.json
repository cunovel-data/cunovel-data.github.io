{"id":3464,"no":34,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"There are many epigrams attributed to Hardin ?a confirmed epigrammatist ? \\n\\n a good many of which are probably apocryphal. Nevertheless, it is reportedthat on a certain occasion, he said: \\n\\n \"It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety.\"Poly Verisof had had occasion to act on that advice more than once for hewas now in the fourteenth year of his double status on Anacreon ?a doublestatus the upkeep of which reminded him often and unpleasantly of a danceperformed barefoot on hot metal. \\n\\n To the people of Anacreon he was high priest, representative of thatFoundation which, to those \"barbarians,\" was the acme of mystery and thephysical center of this religion they had created ?with Hardin\u0027s help ?inthe last three decades. As such, he received a homage that had becomehorribly wearying, for from his soul he despised the ritual of which he wasthe center. \\n\\n But to the King of Anacreon ? the old one that had been, and the younggrandson that was now on the throne ? he was simply the ambassador of apower at once feared and coveted. \\n\\n On the whole, it was an uncomfortable job, and his first trip to theFoundation in three years, despite the disturbing incident that had made itnecessary, was something in the nature of a holiday. \\n\\n And since it was not the first time he had had to travel in absolutesecrecy, he again made use of Hardin\u0027s epigram on the uses of the obvious. \\n\\n He changed into his civilian clothes ?a holiday in itself ?and boarded apassenger liner to the Foundation, second class. Once at Terminus, hethreaded his way through the crowd at the spaceport and called up City Hallat a public visiphone. \\n\\n He said, \"My name is Jan Smite. I have an appointment with the mayor thisafternoon.\"The dead-voiced but efficient young lady at the other end made a secondconnection and exchanged a few rapid words, then said to Verisof in dry,mechanical tone, \"Mayor Hardin will see you in half an hour, sir,\" and thescreen went blank. \\n\\n Whereupon the ambassador to Anacreon bought the latest edition of theTerminus City Journal, sauntered casually to City Hall Park and, sitting. \\n\\n down on the first empty bench he came to, read the editorial page, sportsection and comic sheet while waiting. At the end of half an hour, hetucked the paper under his arm, entered City Hall and presented himself inthe anteroom. \\n\\n In doing all this he remained safely and thoroughly unrecognized, for sincehe was so entirely obvious, no one gave him a second look. \\n\\n Hardin looked up at him and grinned. \"Have a cigar! How was the trip?\"Verisof helped himself. \"Interesting. There was a priest in the next cabinon his way here to take a special course in the preparation of radioactivesynthetics ?for the treatment of cancer, you know ? \\n\\n \"Surely, he didn\u0027t call it radioactive synthetics, now?\"\"I guess not! It was the Holy Food to him.\"The mayor smiled. \"Go on.\"\"He inveigled me into a theological discussion and did his level best toelevate me out of sordid materialism.\"\"And never recognized his own high priest?\"\"Without my crimson robe? Besides, he was a Smyrnian. It was an interestingexperience, though. It is remarkable, Hardin, how the religion of sciencehas grabbed hold. I\u0027ve written an essay on the subject ?entirely for myown amusement; it wouldn\u0027t do to have it published. Treating the problemsociologically, it would seem that when the old Empire began to rot at thefringes, it could be considered that science, as science, had failed theouter worlds. To be reaccepted it would have to present itself in anotherguise and it has done just that. It works out beautifully.\"\"Interesting!\" The mayor placed his arms around his neck and said suddenly,\"Start talking about the situation at Anacreon!\"The ambassador frowned and withdrew the cigar from his mouth. He looked atit distastefully and put it down. \"Well, it\u0027s pretty bad.\"\"You wouldn\u0027t be here, otherwise.\"\"Scarcely. Here\u0027s the position. The key man at Anacreon is the PrinceRegent, Wienis. He\u0027s King Lepold\u0027s uncle.\"\"I know. But Lepold is coming of age next year, isn\u0027t he? I believe he\u0027llbe sixteen in February.\"\"Yes.\" Pause, and then a wry addition. \"If he lives. The king\u0027s father diedunder suspicious circumstances. A needle bullet through the chest during ahunt. It was called an accident.\"\"Hmph. I seem to remember Wienis the time I was on Anacreon, when we kickedthem off Terminus. It was before your time. Let\u0027s see now. If I remember,he was a dark young fellow, black hair and a squint in his right eye. Hehad a funny hook in his nose.\"\"Same fellow. The hook and the squint are still there, but his hair\u0027s graynow. He plays the game dirty. Luckily, he\u0027s the most egregious fool on theplanet. Fancies himself as a shrewd devil, too, which mades his folly themore transparent.\"\"That\u0027s usually the way.\"\"His notion of cracking an egg is to shoot a nuclear blast at it. Witnessthe tax on Temple property he tried to impose just after the old king diedtwo years ago. Remember?\"Hardin nodded thoughtfully, then smiled. \"The priests raised a howl.\"\"They raised one you could hear way out to Lucreza. He\u0027s shown more cautionin dealing with the priesthood since, but he still manages to do things thehard way. In a way, it\u0027s unfortunate for us; he has unlimitedself-confidence.\"\"Probably an over-compensated inferiority complex. Younger sons of royaltyget that way, you know.\"\"But it amounts to the same thing. He\u0027s foaming at the mouth with eagernessto attack the Foundation. He scarcely troubles to conceal it. And he\u0027s in aposition to do it, too, from the standpoint of armament. The old king builtup a magnificent navy, and Wienis hasn\u0027t been sleeping the last two years. \\n\\n In fact, the tax on Temple property was originally intended for furtherarmament, and when that fell through he increased the income tax twice.\"\"Any grumbling at that?\"\"None of serious importance. Obedience to appointed authority was the textof every sermon in the kingdom for weeks. Not that Wienis showed anygratitude.\"\"All right. I\u0027ve got the background. Now what\u0027s happened?\"\"Two weeks ago an Anacreonian merchant ship came across a derelict battlecruiser of the old Imperial Navy. It must have been drifting in space forat least three centuries.\"Interest flickered in Hardin\u0027s eyes. He sat up. \"Yes, I\u0027ve heard of that. \\n\\n The Board of Navigation has sent me a petition asking me to obtain the shipfor purposes of study. It is in good condition, I understand.\"\"In entirely too good condition,\" responded Verisof, dryly. \"When Wienisreceived your suggestion last week that he turn the ship over to theFoundation, he almost had convulsions.\"\"He hasn\u0027t answered yet.\"\"He won\u0027t ?except with guns, or so he thinks. You see, he came to me onthe day I left Anacreon and requested that the Foundation put this battlecruiser into fighting order and turn it over to the Anacreonian navy. Hehad the infernal gall to say that your note of last week indicated a planof the Foundation\u0027s to attack Anacreon. He said that refusal to repair thebattle cruiser would confirm his suspicions; and indicated that measuresfor the self-defense of Anacreon would be forced upon him. Those are hiswords. Forced upon him! And that\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\"Hardin laughed gently. \\n\\n Verisof smiled and continued, \"Of course, he expects a refusal, and itwould be a perfect excuse ? in his eyes ? for immediate attack.\"\"I see that, Verisof. Well, we have at least six months to spare, so havethe ship fixed up and present it with my compliments. Have it renamed theWienis as a mark of our esteem and affection.\"He laughed again. \\n\\n And again Verisof responded with the faintest trace of a smile, \"I supposeit\u0027s the logical step, Hardin ?but I\u0027m worried.\"\"What about?\"\"It\u0027s a ship! They could build in those days. Its cubic capacity is halfagain that of the entire Anacreonian navy. It\u0027s got nuclear blasts capableof blowing up a planet, and a shield that could take a Q-beam withoutworking up radiation. Too much of a good thing, Hardin ? \\n\\n \"Superficial, Verisof, superficial. You and I both know that the armamenthe now has could defeat Terminus handily, long before we could repair thecruiser for our own use. What does it matter, then, if we give him thecruiser as well? You know it won\u0027t ever come to actual war.\"\"I suppose so. Yes.\" The ambassador looked up. \"But Hardin ? \\n\\n \"Well? Why do you stop? Go ahead.\"\"Look. This isn\u0027t my province. But I\u0027ve been reading the paper.\" He placedthe Journal on the desk and indicated the front page. \"What\u0027s this allabout?\"Hardin dropped a casual glance. \"\u0027A group of Councilmen are forming a newpolitical party.\"\u0027 \\n\\n \"That\u0027s what it says.\" Verisof fidgeted. \"I know you\u0027re in better touchwith internal matters than I am, but they\u0027re attacking you with everythingshort of physical violence. How strong are they?\"\"Damned strong. They\u0027ll probably control the Council after next election.\"\"Not before?\" Verisof looked at the mayor obliquely. \"There are ways ofgaining control besides elections.\"\"Do you take me for Wienis?\"\"No. But repairing the ship will take months and an attack after that iscertain. Our yielding will be taken as a sign of appalling weakness and theaddition of the Imperial Cruiser will just about double the strength ofWienis\u0027 navy. He\u0027ll attack as sure as I\u0027m a high priest. Why take chances? \\n\\n Do one of two things. Either reveal the plan of campaign to the Council, orforce the issue with Anacreon now!\"Hardin frowned. \"Force the issue now? Before the crisis comes? It\u0027s the onething I mustn\u0027t do. There\u0027s Hari Seldon and the Plan, you know.\"Verisof hesitated, then muttered, \"You\u0027re absolutely sure, then, that thereis a Plan?\"\"There can scarcely be any doubt,\" came the stiff reply. \"I was present atthe opening of the Time Vault and Seldon\u0027s recording revealed it then.\"\"I didn\u0027t mean that, Hardin. I just don\u0027t see how it could be possible tochart history for a thousand years ahead. Maybe Seldon overestimatedhimself.\" He shriveled a bit at Hardin\u0027s ironical smile, and added, \"Well,I\u0027m no psychologist,\"\"Exactly. None of us are. But I did receive some elementary training in myyouth ?enough to know what psychology is capable of, even if I can\u0027texploit its capabilities myself. There\u0027s no doubt but that Seldon didexactly what he claims to have done. The Foundation, as he says, wasestablished as a scientific refuge ?the means by which the science andculture of the dying Empire was to be preserved through the centuries ofbarbarism that have begun, to be rekindled in the end into a secondEmpire.\"Verisof nodded, a trifle doubtfully. \"Everyone knows that\u0027s the way thingsare supposed to go. But can we afford to take chances? Can we risk thepresent for the sake of a nebulous future?\"\"We must ?because the future isn\u0027t nebulous. It\u0027s been calculated out bySeldon and charted. Each successive crisis in our history is mapped andeach depends in a measure on the successful conclusion of the onesprevious. This is only the second crisis and Space knows what effect even atrifling deviation would have in the end.\"\"That\u0027s rather empty speculation.\"\"No! Hari Seldon said in the Time Vault, that at each crisis our freedom ofaction would become circumscribed to the point where only one course ofaction was possible.\"\"So as to keep us on the straight and narrow?\"\"So as to keep us from deviating, yes. But, conversely, as long as morethan one course of action is possible, the crisis has not been reached. Wemust let things drift so long as we possibly can, and by space, that\u0027s whatI intend doing.\"Verisof didn\u0027t answer. He chewed his lower lip in a grudging silence. Ithad only been the year before that Hardin had first discussed the problemwith him ?the real problem; the problem of countering Anacreon\u0027s hostilepreparations. And then only because he, Verisof, had balked at furtherappeasement. \\n\\n Hardin seemed to follow his ambassador\u0027s thoughts. \"I would much rathernever to have told you anything about this.\"\"What makes you say that?\" cried Verisof, in surprise. \\n\\n \"Because there are six people now ?you and I, the other three ambassadorsand Yohan Lee ? who have a fair notion of what\u0027s ahead; and I\u0027m damnedafraid that it was Seldon\u0027s idea to have no one know.\"\"Why so?\"\"Because even Seldon\u0027s advanced psychology was limited. It could not handletoo many independent variables. He couldn\u0027t work with individuals over anylength of time; any more than you could apply kinetic theory of gases tosingle molecules. He worked with mobs, populations of whole planets, andonly blind mobs who do not possess foreknowledge of the results of theirown actions.\"\"That\u0027s not plain.\"\"I can\u0027t help it. I\u0027m not psychologist enough to explain it scientifically. \\n\\n But this you know. There are no trained psychologists on Terminus and nomathematical texts on the science. It is plain that he wanted no one onTerminus capable of working out the future in advance. Seldon wanted us toproceed blindly ?and therefore correctly ? according to the law of mobpsychology. As I once told you, I never knew where we were heading when Ifirst drove out the Anacreonians. My idea had been to maintain balance ofpower, no more than that. It was only afterward that I thought I saw apattern in events; but I\u0027ve done my level best not to act on thatknowledge. Interference due to foresight would have knocked the Plan out ofkilter.\"Verisof nodded thoughtfully. \"I\u0027ve heard arguments almost as complicated inthe Temples back on Anacreon. How do you expect to spot the fight moment ofaction?\"\"It\u0027s spotted already. You admit that once we repair the battle cruisernothing will stop Wienis from attacking us. There will no longer be anyalternative in that respect.\"\"Yes\"All right. That accounts for the external aspect. Meanwhile, you\u0027llfurther admit that the next election will see a new and hostile Councilthat will force action against Anacreon. There is no alternative there.\"\"Yes.\"\"And as soon as all the alternatives disappear, the crisis has come. Justthe same ?I get worried.\"He paused, and Verisof waited. Slowly, almost reluctantly, Hardincontinued, \"I\u0027ve got the idea ?just a notion ?that the external andinternal pressures were planned to come to a head simultaneously. As it is,there\u0027s a few months difference. Wienis will probably attack before spring,and elections are still a year off.\"\"That doesn\u0027t sound important.\"\"I don\u0027t know. It may be due merely to unavoidable errors of calculation,or it might be due to the fact that I knew too much. I tried never to letmy foresight influence my action, but how can I tell? And what effect willthe discrepancy have? Anyway,\" he looked up, \"there\u0027s one thing I\u0027vedecided.\"\"And what\u0027s that?\"\"When the crisis does begin to break, I\u0027m going to Anacreon. I want to beon the spot ... Oh, that\u0027s enough, Verisof. It\u0027s getting late. Let\u0027s go outand make a night of it. I want some relaxation.\"\"Then get it right here,\u0027 said Verisof. \"I don\u0027t want to be recognized, oryou know what this new party your precious Councilmen are forming wouldsay. Call for the brandy.\"And Hardin did ?but not for too much. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47162.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
