Mallow passed from one to the other through an underground passage, andfound himself in the silent, ozone-tinged atmosphere of the powerhouse. For fifteen minutes, he followed his guide and said nothing. His eyesmissed nothing. His fingers touched nothing. And then, the tech-man said instrangled tones, \"Have you had enough? I couldn\u0027t trust my underlings inthis case.\"\"Could you ever?\" asked Mallow, ironically. \"I\u0027ve had enough.\"They were back in the office and Mallow said, thoughtfully, \"And all thosegenerators are in your hands?\"\"Every one,\" said the tech-man, with more than a touch of complacency. \"And you keep them running and in order?\"\"Right!\"\"And if they break down?\"The tech-man shook his head indignantly, \"They don\u0027t break down. They neverbreak down. They were built for eternity.\"\"Eternity is a long time. Just suppose? \"It is unscientific to suppose meaningless cases.\"\"All right. Suppose I were to blast a vital part into nothingness? Isuppose the machines aren\u0027t immune to nuclear forces? Suppose I fuse avital connection, or smash a quartz D-tube?\"\"Well, then,\" shouted the tech-man, furiously, \"you would be killed.\"\"Yes, I know that,\" Mallow was shouting, too, \"but what about thegenerator? Could you repair it?\"\"Sir,\" the tech-man howled his words, \"you have had a fair return. You\u0027vehad what you asked for. Now get out! I owe you nothing more!\"Mallow bowed with a satiric respect and left. Two days later he was back where the Far Star waited to return with him tothe planet, Terminus. And two days later, the tech-man\u0027s shield went dead, and for all hispuzzling and cursing never glowed again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47256.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
