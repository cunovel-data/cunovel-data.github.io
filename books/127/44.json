{"id":3474,"no":44,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"Theo Aporat was one of the very highest ranking priests of Anacreon. Fromthe standpoint of precedence alone, he deserved his appointment as headpriest- attendant upon the flagship Wienis. \\n\\n But it was not only rank or precedence. He knew the ship. He had workeddirectly under the holy men from the Foundation itself in repairing theship. He had gone over the motors under their orders. He had rewired the\u0027visors; revamped the communications system; replated the punctured hull;reinforced the beams. He had even been permitted to help while the wise menof the Foundation had installed a device so holy it had never been placedin any previous ship, but had been reserved only for this magnificentcolossus of a vessel ?a hyperwave relay. \\n\\n It was no wonder that he felt heartsick over the purposes to which theglorious ship was perverted. He had never wanted to believe what Verisofhad told him ? that the ship was to be used for appalling wickedness; thatits guns were to be turned on the great Foundation. Turned on thatFoundation, where he had been trained as a youth, from which allblessedness was derived. \\n\\n Yet he could not doubt now, after what the admiral had told him. \\n\\n How could the king, divinely blessed, allow this abominable act? Or was itthe king? Was it not, perhaps, an action of the accursed regent, Wienis,without the knowledge of the king at all. And it was the son of this sameWienis that was the admiral who five minutes before had told him: \\n\\n \"Attend to your souls and your blessings, priest. I will attend to myship.\"Aporat smiled crookedly. He would attend to his souls and his blessings ? \\n\\n and also to his cursings; and Prince Lefkin would whine soon enough. \\n\\n He had entered the general communications room now. His. acolyte precededhim and the two officers in charge made no move to interfere. The headpriest-attendant had the right of free entry anywhere on the ship. \\n\\n \"Close the door,\" Aporat ordered, and looked at the chronometer. It lackedFive minutes of twelve. He had timed it well. \\n\\n With quick practiced motions, he moved the little levers that opened allcommunications, so that every part of the two-mile-long ship was withinreach of his voice and his image. \\n\\n \"Soldiers of the royal flagship Wienis, attend! It is your priest-attendantthat speaks!\" The sound of his voice reverberated, he knew, from the stematom blast in the extreme rear to the navigation tables in the prow. \\n\\n \"Your ship,\" he cried, \"is engaged in sacrilege. Without your knowledge, itis performing such an act as will doom the soul of every man among you tothe eternal frigidity of space! Listen! It is the intention of yourcommander to take this ship to the Foundation and there to bombard thatsource of all blessings into submission to his sinful will. And since thatis his intention, I, in the name of the Galactic Spirit, remove him fromhis command, for there is no command where the blessing of the GalacticSpirit has been withdrawn. The divine king himself may not maintain hiskingship without the consent of the Spirit.\"His voice took on a deeper tone, while the acolyte listened with venerationand the two soldiers with mounting fear. \"And because this ship is uponsuch a devil\u0027s errand, the blessing of the Spirit is removed from it aswell.\"He lifted his arms solemnly, and before a thousand televisors throughoutthe ship, soldiers cowered, as the stately image of their priest-attendantspoke: \\n\\n \"In the name of the Galactic Spirit and of his prophet, Hari Seldon, and ofhis interpreters, the holy men of the Foundation, I curse this ship. Letthe televisors of this ship, which are its eyes, become blind. Let itsgrapples, which are its arms, be paralyzed. Let the nuclear blasts, whichare its fists, lose their function. Let the motors, which are its heart,cease to beat. Let the communications, which are its voice, become dumb. \\n\\n Let its ventilations, which are its breath, fade. Let its lights, which areits soul, shrivel into nothing. In the name of the Galactic Spirit, I socurse this ship.\"And with his last word, at the stroke of midnight, a hand, light-yearsdistant in the Argolid Temple, opened an ultrawave relay, which at theinstantaneous speed of the ultrawave, opened another on the flagshipWienis. \\n\\n And the ship died! \\n\\n For it is the chief characteristic of the religion of science that itworks, and that such curses as that of Aporat\u0027s are really deadly. \\n\\n Aporat saw the darkness close down on the ship and heard the sudden ceasingof the soft, distant purring of the hyperatomic motors. He exulted and fromthe pocket of his long robe withdrew a self-powered nucleo-bulb that filledthe room with pearly light. \\n\\n He looked down at the two soldiers who, brave men though they undoubtedlywere, writhed on their knees in the last extremity of mortal terror. \"Saveour souls, your reverence. We are poor men, ignorant of the crimes of ourleaders,\" one whimpered. \\n\\n \"Follow,\" said Aporat, sternly. \"Your soul is not yet lost.\"The ship was a turmoil of darkness in which fear was so thick and palpable,it was all but a miasmic smell. Soldiers crowded close wherever Aporat andhis circle of light passed, striving to touch the hem of his robe, pleadingfor the tiniest scrap of mercy. \\n\\n And always his answer was, \"Follow me!\"He found Prince Lefkin, groping his way through the officers\u0027 quarters,cursing loudly for lights. The admiral stared at the priest-attendant withhating eyes. \\n\\n \"There you are!\" Lefkin inherited his blue eyes from his mother, but therewas that about the hook in his nose and the squint in his eye that markedhim as the son of Wienis. \"What is the meaning of your treasonable actions? \\n\\n Return the power to the ship. I am commander here.\"\"No longer,\" said Aporat, somberly. \\n\\n Lefkin looked about wildly. \"Seize that man. Arrest him, or by Space, Iwill send every man within reach of my voice out the air lock in the nude.\"He paused, and then shrieked, \"It is your admiral that orders. Arrest him.\"Then, as he lost his head entirely, \"Are you allowing yourselves to befooled by this mountebank, this harlequin? Do you cringe before a religioncompounded of clouds and moonbeams? This man is an imposter and theGalactic Spirit he speaks of a fraud of the imagination devised to? \\n\\n Aporat interrupted furiously. \"Seize the blasphemer. You listen to him atthe peril of your souls.\"And promptly, the noble admiral went down under the clutching hands of ascore of soldiers. \\n\\n \"Take him with you and follow me.\"Aporat turned, and with Lefkin dragged along after him, and the corridorsbehind black with soldiery, he returned to the communications room. There,he ordered the ex-commander before the one televisor that worked. \\n\\n \"Order the rest of the fleet to cease course and to prepare for the returnto Anacreon.\"The disheveled Lefkin, bleeding, beaten, and half stunned, did so. \\n\\n \"And now,\" continued Aporat, grimly, \"we are in contact with Anacreon onthe hyperwave beam. Speak as I order you.\"Lefkin made a gesture of negation, and the mob in the room and the otherscrowding the corridor beyond, growled fearfully. \\n\\n \"Speak!\" said Aporat. \"Begin: The Anacreonian navy? \\n\\n Lefkin began. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47172.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
