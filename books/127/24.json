{"id":3454,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"Lord Dorwin took snuff. He also had long hair, curled intricately and,quite obviously, artificially, to which were added a pair of fluffy, blondsideburns, which he fondled affectionately. Then, too, he spoke inoverprecise statements and left out all the r\u0027s. \n At the moment, Hardin had no time to think of more of the reasons for theinstant detestation in which he had held the noble chancellor. Oh, yes, theelegant gestures of one hand with which he accompanied his remarks and thestudied condescension with which he accompanied even a simple affirmative. \n But, at any rate, the problem now was to locate him. He had disappearedwith Pirenne half an hour before ?passed clean out of sight, blast him. \n Hardin was quite sure that his own absence during the preliminarydiscussions would quite suit Pirenne. \n But Pirenne had been seen in this wing And on this floor. It was simply amatter of trying every door. Halfway down, he said, \"Ah!\" and stepped intothe darkened room. The profile of Lord Dorwin\u0027s intricate hair-do wasunmistakable against the lighted screen. \n Lord Dorwin looked up and said: \"Ah, Hahdin. You ah looking foah us, nodoubt?\" He held out his snuffbox ? overadorned and poor workmanship atthat, noted Hardinand was politely refused whereat he helped himself to apinch and smiled graciously. \n Pirenne scowled and Hardin met that with an expression of blankindifference. \n The only sound to break the short silence that followed was the clicking ofthe lid of Lord Dorwin\u0027s snuffbox. And then he put it away and said: \n \"A gweat achievement, this Encyclopedia of yoahs, Hahdin. A feat, indeed,to rank with the most majestic accomplishments of all time.\"\"Most of us think so, milord. It\u0027s an accomplishment not quite accomplishedas yet, however.\"\"Fwom the little I have seen of the efficiency of yoah Foundation, I haveno feahs on that scoah.\" And he nodded to Pirenne, who responded with adelighted bow. \n Quite a love feast, thought Hardin. \"I wasn\u0027t complaining about the lack ofefficiency, milord, as much as of the definite excess of efficiency on thepart of the Anacreonians ? though in another and more destructivedirection.\"\"Ah, yes, Anacweon.\" A negligent wave of the hand. \"I have just come fromtheah. Most bahbawous planet. It is thowoughly inconceivable that humanbeings could live heah in the Pewiphewy. The lack of the most elementawywequiahments of a cultuahed gentleman; the absence of the most fundamentalnecessities foah comfoht and convenience ? the uttah desuetude into whichthey? \n Hardin interrupted dryly: \"The Anacreonians, unfortunately, have all theelementary requirements for warfare and all the fundamental necessities fordestruction.\"\"Quite, quite.\" Lord Dorwin seemed annoyed, perhaps at being stopped midwayin his sentence. \"But we ahn\u0027t to discuss business now, y\u0027know. Weally, I\u0027mothahwise concuhned. Doctah Piwenne, ahn\u0027t you going to show me the secondvolume? Do, please.\"The lights clicked out and for the next half-hour Hardin might as well havebeen on Anacreon for all the attention they paid him. The book upon thescreen made little sense to him, nor did he trouble to make the attempt tofollow, but Lord Dorwin became quite humanly excited at times. Hardinnoticed that during these moments of excitement the chancellor pronouncedhis r\u0027s. \n When the lights went on again, Lord Dorwin said: \"Mahvelous. Twulymahvelous. You ah not, by chance, intewested in ahchaeology, ah you,Hahdin?\"\"Eh?\" Hardin shook himself out of an abstracted reverie. \"No, milord, can\u0027tsay I am. I\u0027m a psychologist by original intention and a politician byfinal decision.\"\"Ah! No doubt intewesting studies. 1, myself, y\u0027know\" ?he helped himselfto a giant pinch of snuff ?dabble in ahchaeology.\"\"Indeed?\"\"His lordship,\" interrupted Pirenne, \"is most thoroughly acquainted withthe field.\"\"Well, p\u0027haps I am, p\u0027haps I am,\" said his lordship complacently. \"I havedone an awful amount of wuhk in the science. Extwemely well-read, in fact. \n I\u0027ve gone thwough all of Jawdun, Obijasi, Kwomwill ... oh, all of them,y\u0027know.\"\"I\u0027ve heard of them, of course,\" said Hardin, \"but I\u0027ve never read them.\"\"You should some day, my deah fellow. It would amply repay you. Why, Icutainly considah it well wuhth the twip heah to the Pewiphewy to see thiscopy of Lameth. Would you believe it, my Libwawy totally lacks a copy. Bythe way, Doctah Piwenne, you have not fohgotten yoah pwomise totwansdevelop a copy foah me befoah I leave?\"\"Only too pleased.\"\"Lameth, you must know,\" continued the chancellor, pontifically, \"pwesentsa new and most intwesting addition to my pwevious knowledge of the \u0027OwiginQuestion.\"\u0027 \n \"Which question?\" asked Hardin. \n \"The \u0027Owigin Question.\u0027 The place of the owigin of the human species,y\u0027know. Suahly you must know that it is thought that owiginally the humanwace occupied only one planetawy system.\"\"Well, yes, I know that.\"\"Of cohse, no one knows exactly which system it is ? lost in the mists ofantiquity. Theah ah theawies, howevah. Siwius, some say. Othahs insist onAlpha Centauwi, oah on Sol, oah on 61 Cygni ?all in the Siwius sectah, yousee.\"\"And what does Lameth say?\"\"Well, he goes off along a new twail completely. He twies to show thatahchaeological wemains on the thuhd planet of the Ahctuwian System showthat humanity existed theah befoah theah wah any indications ofspace-twavel.\"\"And that means it was humanity\u0027s birth planet?\"\"P\u0027haps. I must wead it closely and weigh the evidence befoah I can sayfoah cuhtain. One must see just how weliable his obsuhvations ah.\"Hardin remained silent for a short while. Then he said, \"When did Lamethwrite his book?\"\"Oh ?I should say about eight hundwed yeahs ago. Of cohse, he has based itlahgely on the pwevious wuhk of Gleen.\"\"Then why rely on him? Why not go to Arcturus and study the remains foryourself?\"Lord Dorwin raised his eyebrows and took a pinch of snuff hurriedly. \"Why,whatevah foah, my deah fellow?\"\"To get the information firsthand, of course.\"\"But wheah\u0027s the necessity? It seems an uncommonly woundabout andhopelessly wigmawolish method of getting anywheahs. Look heah, now, I\u0027vegot the wuhks of all the old mastahs ? the gweat ahchaeologists of thepast. I wigh them against each othah ?balance the disagweements ?analyzethe conflicting statements ?decide which is pwobably cowwect ?and come toa conclusion. That is the scientific method. At least\" ?patronizingly ?asI see it. How insuffewably cwude it would be to go to Ahctuwus, oah to Sol,foah instance, and blundah about, when the old mastahs have covahed thegwound so much moah effectually than we could possibly hope to do.\"Hardin murmured politely, \"I see.\"\"Come, milord,\" said Pirenne, \"think we had better be returning.\"\"Ah, yes. P\u0027haps we had.\"As they left the room, Hardin said suddenly, \"Milord, may I ask aquestion?\"Lord Dorwin smiled blandly and emphasized his answer with a graciousflutter of the hand. \"Cuhtainly, my deah fellow. Only too happy to be ofsuhvice. If I can help you in any way fwom my pooah stoah of knowledge-\"\"It isn\u0027t exactly about archaeology, milord.\"\"No?\"\"No. It\u0027s this: Last year we received news here in Terminus about themeltdown of a power plant on Planet V of Gamma Andromeda. We got the barestoutline of the accident ?no details at all. I wonder if you could tell meexactly what happened.\"Pirenne\u0027s mouth twisted. \"I wonder you annoy his lordship with questions ontotally irrelevant subjects.\"\"Not at all, Doctah Piwenne,\" interceded the chancellor. \"It is quite allwight. Theah isn\u0027t much to say concuhning it in any case. The powah plantdid undergo meltdown and it was quite a catastwophe, y\u0027know. I believewadiatsen damage. Weally, the govuhnment is sewiously considewing placingseveah westwictions upon the indiscwiminate use of nucleah powah ?thoughthat is not a thing for genewal publication, y\u0027know.\"\"I understand,\" said Hardin. \"But what was wrong with the plant?\"\"Well, weally,\" replied Lord Dorwin indifferently, \"who knows? It hadbwoken down some yeahs pweviously and it is thought that the weplacementsand wepaiah wuhk wuh most infewiah. It is so difficult these days to findmen who weally undahstand the moah technical details of ouah powahsystems.\" And he took a sorrowful pinch of snuff. \n \"You realize,\" said Hardin, \"that the independent kingdoms of the Peripheryhad lost nuclear power altogether?\"\"Have they? I\u0027m not at all suhpwised. Bahbawous planets?Oh, but my deahfellow, don\u0027t call them independent. They ahn\u0027t, y\u0027know. The tweaties we\u0027vemade with them ah pwoof positive of that. They acknowledge the soveweigntyof the Empewah. They\u0027d have to, of cohse, oah we wouldn\u0027t tweat with them.\"\"That may be so, but they have considerable freedom of action.\"\"Yes, I suppose so. Considewable. But that scahcely mattahs. The Empiah isfah bettah off, with the Pewiphewy thwown upon its own wesoahces ?as itis, moah oah less. They ahn\u0027t any good to us, y\u0027know. Most bahbawousplanets. Scahcely civilized.\"\"They were civilized in the past. Anacreon was one of the richest of theoutlying provinces. I understand it compared favorably with Vega itself.\"\"Oh, but, Hahdin, that was centuwies ago. You can scahcely dwaw conclusionfwom that. Things wah diffewent in the old gweat days. We ahn\u0027t the men weused to be, y\u0027know. But, Hahdin, come, you ah a most puhsistent chap. \n I\u0027ve told you I simply won\u0027t discuss business today. Doctah Piwenne didpwepayah me foah you. He told me you would twy to badgah me, but I\u0027m fahtoo old a hand foah that. Leave it foah next day.
