{"id":3448,"no":18,"title":"PART II THE ENCYCLOPEDISTS Chapter 1","content":"TERMINUS?.. Its location (see map) was an odd one for the role it wascalled upon to play in Galactic history, and yet as many writers have nevertired of pointing out, an inevitable one. Located on the very fringe of theGalactic spiral, an only planet of an isolated sun, poor in resources andnegligible in economic value, it was never settled in the five centuriesafter its discovery, until the landing of the Encyclopedists.... It was inevitable that as a new generation grew, Terminus would becomesomething more than an appendage of the psychohistorians of Trantor. Withthe Anacreonian revolt and the rise to power of Salvor Hardin, first of thegreat line of... ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICALewis Pirenne was busily engaged at his desk in the one well-lit comer ofthe room. Work had to be co-ordinated. Effort had to be organized. Threadshad to be woven into a pattern. Fifty years now; fifty years to establish themselves and set upEncyclopedia Foundation Number One into a smoothly working unit. Fiftyyears to gather the raw material. Fifty years to prepare. It had been done. Five more years would see the publication of the firstvolume of the most monumental work the Galaxy had ever conceived. And thenat ten-year intervals ?regularly ?like clockwork ?volume after volume. And with them there would be supplements; special articles on events ofcurrent interest, until? Pirenne stirred uneasily, as the muted buzzer upon his desk mutteredpeevishly. He had almost forgotten the appointment. He shoved the doorrelease and out of an abstracted comer of one eye saw the door open and thebroad figure of Salvor Hardin enter. Pirenne did not look up. Hardin smiled to himself. He was in a hurry, but he knew better than totake offense at Pirenne\u0027s cavalier treatment of anything or anyone thatdisturbed him at his work. He buried himself in the chair on the other sideof the desk and waited. Pirenne\u0027s stylus made the faintest scraping sound as it raced across paper. Otherwise, neither motion nor sound. And then Hardin withdrew a two-creditcoin from his vest pocket. He flipped it and its stainless-steel surfacecaught flitters of light as it tumbled through the air. He caught itand-flipped it again, watching the flashing reflections lazily. Stainlesssteel made good medium of exchange on a planet where all metal had to beimported. Pirenne looked up and blinked. \"Stop that!\" he said querulously. \"Eh?\"\"That infernal coin tossing. Stop it.\"\"Oh.\" Hardin pocketed the metal disk. \"Tell me when you\u0027re ready, will you? I promised to be back at the City Council meeting before the new aqueductproject is put to a vote.\"Pirenne sighed and shoved himself away from the desk. \"I\u0027m ready. But Ihope you aren\u0027t going to bother me with city affairs. Take care of thatyourself, please. The Encyclopedia takes up all my time.\"\"Have you heard the news?\" questioned Hardin, phlegmatically. \"What news?\"\"The news that the Terminus City ultrawave set received two hours ago. TheRoyal Governor of the Prefect of Anacreon has assumed the title of king.\"\"Well? What of it?\"\"It means,\" responded Hardin, \"that we\u0027re cut off from the inner regions ofthe Empire. We\u0027ve been expecting it but that doesn\u0027t make it any morecomfortable. Anacreon stands square across what was our last remainingtrade route to Santanni and to Trantor and to Vega itself. Where is ourmetal to come from? We haven\u0027t managed to get a steel or aluminum shipmentthrough in six months and now we won\u0027t be able to get any at all, except bygrace of the King of Anacreon.\"Pirenne tch-tched impatiently. \"Get them through him, then.\"\"But can we? Listen, Pirenne, according to the charter which establishedthis Foundation, the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee hasbeen given full administrative powers. I, as Mayor of Terminus City, havejust enough power to blow my own nose and perhaps to sneeze if youcountersign an order giving me permission. It\u0027s up to you and your Boardthen. I\u0027m asking you in the name of the City, whose prosperity depends uponuninterrupted commerce with the Galaxy, to call an emergency meeting? \"Stop! A campaign speech is out of order. Now, Hardin, the Board ofTrustees has not barred the establishment of a municipal government onTerminus. We understand one to be necessary because of the increase inpopulation since the Foundation was established fifty years ago, andbecause of the increasing number of people involved in non-Encyclopediaaffairs. But that does not mean that the first and only aim of theFoundation is no longer to publish the definitive Encyclopedia of all humanknowledge. We are a State-supported, scientific institution, Hardin. Wecannot ? must not ? will not interfere in local politics.\"\"Local politics! By the Emperor\u0027s left toe, Pirenne, this is a matter oflife and death. The planet, Terminus, by itself cannot support a mechanizedcivilization. It lacks metals. You know that. It hasn\u0027t a trace of iron,copper, or aluminum in the surface rocks, and precious little of anythingelse. What do you think will happen to the Encyclopedia if thiswatchmacallum King of Anacreon clamps down on us?\"\"On us? Are you forgetting that we are under the direct control of theEmperor himself? We are not part of the Prefect of Anacreon or of any otherprefect. Memorize that! We are part of the Emperor\u0027s personal domain, andno one touches us. The Empire can protect its own.\"\"Then why didn\u0027t it prevent the Royal Governor of Anacreon from kickingover the traces? And only Anacreon? At least twenty of the outermost prefects of the Galaxy, the entirePeriphery as a matter of fact, have begun steering things their own way. Itell you I feel damned uncertain of the Empire and its ability to protectus.\"\"Hokum! Royal Governors, Kings ?what\u0027s the difference? The Empire isalways shot through with a certain amount of politics and with differentmen pulling this way and that. Governors have rebelled, and, for thatmatter, Emperors have been deposed, or assassinated before this. But whathas that to do with the Empire itself? Forget it, Hardin. It\u0027s none of ourbusiness. We are first of all and last of all-scientists. And our concernis the Encyclopedia. Oh, yes, I\u0027d almost forgotten. Hardin!\"\"Well?\"\"Do something about that paper of yours!\" Pirenne\u0027s voice was angry. \"The Terminus City Journal? It isn\u0027t mine; it\u0027s privately owned. What\u0027s itbeen doing?\"\"For weeks now it has been recommending that the fiftieth anniversary ofthe establishment of the Foundation be made the occasion for publicholidays and quite inappropriate celebrations.\"\"And why not? The computoclock will open the Vault in three months. I wouldcall this first opening a big occasion, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\"Not for silly pageantry, Hardin. The Vault and its opening concern theBoard of Trustees alone. Anything of importance will be communicated to thepeople. That is final and please make it plain to the Journal.\"\"I\u0027m sorry, Pirenne, but the City Charter guarantees a certain minor matterknown as freedom of the press.\"\"It may. But the Board of Trustees does not. I am the Emperor\u0027srepresentative on Terminus, Hardin, and have full powers in this respect.\"Hardin\u0027s expression became that of a man counting to ten, mentally. Hesaid, grimly: \"in connection with your status as Emperor\u0027s representative,then, I have a final piece of news to give you.\"\"About Anacreon?\" Pirenne\u0027s lips tightened. He felt annoyed. \"Yes. A special envoy will be sent to us from Anacreon. In two weeks.\"\"An envoy? Here? From Anacreon?\" Pirenne chewed that. \"What for?\"Hardin stood up, and shoved his chair back up against the desk. \"I give youone guess.\" And he left ?quite unceremoniously.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47146.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
