{"id":3510,"no":80,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"Onum Barr was an old man, too old to be afraid. Since the lastdisturbances, he had lived alone on the fringes of the land with what bookshe had saved from the ruins. He had nothing he feared losing, least of allthe worn remnant of his life, and so he faced the intruder withoutcringing. \"Your door was open,\" the stranger explained. His accent was clipped and harsh, and Barr did not fail to notice thestrange blue-steel hand-weapon at his hip. In the half gloom of the smallroom, Barr saw the glow of a force-shield surrounding the man. He said, wearily, \"There is no reason to keep it closed. Do you wishanything of me?\"\"Yes.\" The stranger remained standing in the center of the room. He waslarge, both in height and bulk. \"Yours is the only house about here.\"\"It is a desolate place,\" agreed Barr, \"but there is a town to the east. Ican show you the way\u0027.\"\"In a while. May I sit?\"\"If the chairs will hold you,\" said the old man, gravely. They were old,too. Relics of a better youth. The stranger said, \"My name is Hober Mallow. I come from a far province.\"Barr nodded and smiled, \"Your tongue convicted you of that long ago. I amOnum Barr of Siwenna ? and once Patrician of the Empire.\"\"Then this is Siwenna. I had only old maps to guide me.\"\"They would have to be old, indeed, for star-positions to be misplaced.\"Barr sat quite still, while the other\u0027s eyes drifted away into a reverie. He noticed that the nuclear force-shield had vanished from about the manand admitted dryly to himself that his person no longer seemed formidableto strangers ? or even, for good or for evil, to his enemies. He said, \"My house is poor and my resources few. You may share what I haveif your stomach can endure black bread and dried corn.\"Mallow shook his head, \"No, I have eaten, and I can\u0027t stay. All I need arethe directions to the center of government.\"\"That is easily enough done, and poor though I am, deprives me of nothing. Do you mean the capital of the planet, or of the Imperial Sector?\"The younger man\u0027s eyes narrowed, \"Aren\u0027t the two identical? Isn\u0027t thisSiwenna?\"The old patrician nodded slowly, \"Siwenna, yes. But Siwenna is no longercapital of the Normannic Sector. Your old map has misled you after all. Thestars may not change even in centuries, but political boundaries are alltoo fluid.\"\"That\u0027s too bad. In fact, that\u0027s very bad. Is the new capital far off?\"\"It\u0027s on Orsha II. Twenty parsecs off. Your map will direct you. How old isit?\"\"A hundred and fifty years.\"\"That old?\" The old man sighed. \"History has been crowded since. Do youknow any of it?\"Mallow shook his bead slowly. Barr said, \"You\u0027re fortunate. It has been an evil time for the provinces,but for the reign of Stannell VI, and he died fifty years ago. Since thattime, rebellion and ruin, ruin and rebellion.\" Barr wondered if he weregrowing garrulous. It was a lonely life out here, and he had so littlechance to talk to men. Mallow said with sudden sharpness, \"Ruin, eh? You sound as if the provincewere impoverished.\"\"Perhaps not on an absolute scale. The physical resources of twenty-fivefirst-rank planets take a long time to use up. Compared to the wealth ofthe last century, though, we have gone a long way downhill ?and there isno sign of turning, not yet. Why are you so interested in all this, youngman? You are all alive and your eyes shine!\"The trader came near enough to blushing, as the faded eyes seemed to looktoo deep into his and smile at what they saw. He said, \"Now look here. I\u0027m a trader out there ?out toward the rim of theGalaxy. I\u0027ve located some old maps, and I\u0027m out to open new markets. Naturally, talk of impoverished provinces disturbs me. You can\u0027t get moneyout of a world unless money\u0027s there to be got. Now how\u0027s Siwenna, forinstance?\"The old man leaned forward, \"I cannot say. It will do even yet, perhaps. But you a trader? You look more like a fighting man. You hold your handnear your gun and there is a scar on your jawbone.\"Mallow jerked his head, \"There isn\u0027t much law out there where I come from. Fighting and scars are part of a trader\u0027s overhead. But fighting is onlyuseful when there\u0027s money at the end, and if I can get it without, so muchthe sweeter. Now will I find enough money here to make it worth thefighting? I take it I can find the fighting easily enough.\"\"Easily enough,\" agreed Barr. \"You could join Wiscard\u0027s remnants in the RedStars. I don\u0027t know, though, if you\u0027d call that fighting or piracy. Or youcould join our present gracious viceroy ? gracious by right of murder,pillage, rapine, and the word of a boy Emperor, since rightfullyassassinated.\" The patrician\u0027s thin cheeks reddened. His eyes closed andthen opened, bird-bright. \"You don\u0027t sound very friendly to the viceroy, Patrician Barr,\" saidMallow. \"What if I\u0027m one of his spies?\"\"What if you are?\" said Barr, bitterly. \"What can you take?\" He gestured awithered arm at the bare interior of the decaying mansion. \"Your life.\"\"It would leave me easily enough. It has been with me five years too long. But you are not one of the viceroy\u0027s men. If you were, perhaps even nowinstinctive self-preservation would keep my mouth closed.\"\"How do you know?\"The old man laughed, \"You seem suspicious ?Come, I\u0027ll wager you think I\u0027mtrying to trap you into denouncing the government. No, no. I am pastpolitics.\"\"Past politics? Is a man ever past that? The words you used to describe theviceroy ?what were they? Murder, pillage, all that. You didn\u0027t soundobjective. Not exactly. Not as if you were past politics.\"The old man shrugged, \"Memories sting when they come suddenly. Listen! Judge for yourself! When Siwenna was the provincial capital, I was apatrician and a member of the provincial senate. My family was an old andhonored one. One of my great-grandfathers had been?No, never mind that. Past glories are poor feeding.\"\"I take it,\" said Mallow, \"there was a civil war, or a revolution.\"Barr\u0027s face darkened. \"Civil wars are chronic in these degenerate days, butSiwenna had kept apart. Under Stannell VI, it had almost achieved itsancient prosperity. But weak emperors followed, and weak emperors meanstrong viceroys, and our last viceroy ?the same Wiscard, whose remnantsstill prey on the commerce among the Red Stars ?aimed at the ImperialPurple. He wasn\u0027t the first to aim. And if he had succeeded, he wouldn\u0027thave been the first to succeed. \"But he failed. For when the Emperor\u0027s Admiral approached the province atthe head of a fleet, Siwenna itself rebelled against its rebel viceroy.\" Hestopped, sadly. Mallow found himself tense on the edge of his seat, and relaxed slowly,\"Please continue, sir.\"\"Thank you,\" said Barr, wearily. \"It\u0027s kind of you to humor an old man. They rebelled; or I should say, we rebelled, for I was one of the minorleaders. Wiscard left Siwenna, barely ahead of us, and the planet, and withit the province, were thrown open to the admiral with every gesture ofloyalty to the Emperor. Why we did this, 朓\u0027m not sure. Maybe we felt loyalto the symbol, if not the person, of the Emperor, 朼 cruel and viciouschild. Maybe we feared the horrors of a siege.\"\"Well?\" urged Mallow, gently. \"Well, came the grim retort, \"that didn\u0027t suit the admiral. He wanted theglory of conquering a rebellious province and his men wanted the loot suchconquest would involve. So while the people were still gathered in everylarge city, cheering the Emperor and his admiral, he occupied all armedcenters, and then ordered the population put to the nuclear blast.\"\"On what pretext?\"\"On the pretext that they had rebelled against their viceroy, the Emperor\u0027sanointed. And the admiral became the new viceroy, by virtue of one month ofmassacre, pillage and complete horror. I had six sons. Five died ? variously. I had a daughter. I hope she died, eventually. I escaped becauseI was old. I came here, too old to cause even our viceroy worry.\" He benthis gray head, \"They left me nothing, because I had helped drive out arebellious governor and deprived an admiral of his glory.\"Mallow sat silent, and waited. Then, \"What of your sixth son?\" he askedsoftly. \"Eh?\" Barr smiled acidly. \"He is safe, for he has joined the admiral as acommon soldier under an assumed name. He is a gunner in the viceroy\u0027spersonal fleet. Oh, no, I see your eyes. He is not an unnatural son. Hevisits me when he can and gives me what he can. He keeps me alive. And someday, our great and glorious viceroy will grovel to his death, and it willbe my son who will be his executioner.\"\"And you tell this to a stranger? You endanger your son.\"\"No. I help him, by introducing a new enemy. And were I a friend of theviceroy, as I am his enemy, I would tell him to string outer space withships, clear to the rim of the Galaxy.\"\"There are no ships there?\"\"Did you find any? Did any space-guards question your entry? With ships fewenough, and the bordering provinces filled with their share of intrigue andiniquity, none can be spared to guard the barbarian outer suns. No dangerever threatened us from the broken edge of the Galaxy, 杣ntil you came.\"\"I? I\u0027m no danger.\"\"There will be more after you.\"Mallow shook his head slowly, \"I\u0027m not sure I understand you.\"\"Listen!\" There was a feverish edge to the old man\u0027s voice. \"I knew youwhen you entered. You have a force-shield about your body, or had when Ifirst saw you.\"Doubtful silence, then, \"Yes, 朓 had.\"\"Good. That was a flaw, but you didn\u0027t know that. There are some things Iknow. It\u0027s out of fashion in these decaying times to be a scholar. Eventsrace and flash past and who cannot fight the tide with nuclear-blast inhand is swept away, as I was. But I was a scholar, and I know that in allthe history of nucleics, no portable force-shield was ever invented. Wehave force-shields ?huge, lumbering powerhouses that will protect a city,or even a ship, but not one, single man.\"\"Ah?\" Mallow\u0027s underlip thrust out. \"And what do you deduce from that?\"\"There have been stories percolating through space. They travel strangepaths and become distorted with every parsec, 朾ut when I was young therewas a small ship of strange men, who did not know our customs and could nottell where they came from. They talked of magicians at the edge of theGalaxy; magicians who glowed in the darkness, who flew unaided through theair, and whom weapons would not touch. \"We laughed. I laughed, too. I forgot it till today. But you glow in thedarkness, and I don\u0027t think my blaster, if I had one, would hurt you. Tellme, can you fly through air as you sit there now?\"Mallow said calmly, \"I can make nothing of all this.\"Barr smiled, \"I\u0027m content with the answer. I do not examine my guests. Butif there are magicians; if you are one of them; there may some day be agreat influx of them, or you. Perhaps that would be well. Maybe we need newblood.\" He muttered soundlessly to himself, then, slowly, \"But it works theother way, too. Our new viceroy also dreams, as did our old Wiscard.\"\"Also after the Emperor\u0027s crown?\"Barr nodded, \"My son hears tales. In the viceroy\u0027s personal entourage, onecould scarcely help it. And he tells me of them. Our new viceroy would notrefuse the Crown if offered, but he guards his line of retreat. There arestories that, failing Imperial heights, he plans to carve out a new Empirein the Barbarian hinterland. It is said, but I don\u0027t vouch for this, thathe has already given one of his daughters as wife to a Kinglet somewhere inthe uncharted Periphery.\"\"If one listened to every story? \"I know. There are many more. I\u0027m old and I babble nonsense. But what doyou say?\" And those sharp, old eyes peered deep. The trader considered, \"I say nothing. But I\u0027d like to ask something. DoesSiwenna have nuclear power? Now, wait, I know that it possesses theknowledge of nucleics. I mean, do they have power generators intact, or didthe recent sack destroy them?\"\"Destroy them? Oh, no. Half a planet would be wiped out before the smallestpower station would be touched. They are irreplaceable and the suppliers ofthe strength of the fleet.\" Almost proudly, \"We have the largest and beston this side of Trantor itself.\"\"Then what would I do first if I wanted to see these generators?\"\"Nothing!\" replied Barr, decisively. \"You couldn\u0027t approach any militarycenter without being shot down instantly. Neither could anyone. Siwenna isstill deprived of civic rights.\"\"You mean all the power stations are under the military?\"\"No. There are the small city stations, the ones supplying power forheating and lighting homes, powering vehicles and so forth. Those arealmost as bad. They\u0027re controlled by the tech-men.\"\"Who are they?\"\"A specialized group which supervises the power plants. The honor ishereditary, the young ones being brought up in the profession asapprentices. Strict sense of duty, honor, and all that. No one but atech-man could enter a station.\"\"I see.\"\"I don\u0027t say, though,\" added Barr, \"that there aren\u0027t cases where tech-menhaven\u0027t been bribed. In days when we have nine emperors in fifty years andseven of these are assassinated, 杦hen every space-captain aspires to theusurpation of a viceroyship, and every viceroy to the Imperium,I suppose even a tech-man can fall prey to money. But it would require agood deal, and I have none. Have you?\"\"Money? No. But does one always bribe with money?\"\"What else, when money buys all else.\"\"There is quite enough that money won\u0027t buy. And now if you\u0027ll tell me thenearest city with one of the stations, and how best to get there, I\u0027llthank you.\"\"Wait!\" Barr held out his thin hands. \"Where do you rush? You come here,but I ask no questions. In the city, where the inhabitants are still calledrebels, you would be challenged by the first soldier or guard who heardyour accent and saw your clothes.\"He rose and from an obscure comer of an old chest brought out a booklet. \"My passport, 杅orged. I escaped with it.\"He placed it in Mallow\u0027s hand and folded the fingers over it. \"Thedescription doesn\u0027t fit, but if you flourish it, the chances are many toone they will not look closely.\"\"But you. You\u0027ll be left without one.\"The old exile shrugged cynically, \"What of it? And a further caution. Curbyour tongue! Your accent is barbarous, your idioms peculiar, and every oncein a while you deliver yourself of the most astounding archaisms. The lessyou speak, the less suspicion you will draw upon yourself. Now I\u0027ll tellyou how to get to the city? Five minutes later, Mallow was gone. He returned but once, for a moment, to the old patrician\u0027s house, beforeleaving it entirely, however. And when Onum Barr stepped into his littlegarden early the next morning, he found a box at his feet. It containedprovisions, concentrated provisions such as one would find aboard ship, andalien in taste and preparation. But they were good, and lasted long.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47252.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
