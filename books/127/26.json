{"id":3456,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"This was the second meeting of the Board that Hardin had attended, if onewere to exclude the informal talks the Board members had had with thenow-departed Lord Dorwin. Yet the mayor had a perfectly definite idea thatat least one other, and possibly two or three, had been held, to which hehad somehow never received an invitation. Nor, it seemed to him, would he have received notification of this one hadit not been for the ultimatum. At least, it amounted to an ultimatum, though a superficial reading of thevisigraphed document would lead one to suppose that it was a friendlyinterchange of greetings between two potentates. Hardin fingered it gingerly. It started off floridly with a salutation from\"His Puissant Majesty, the King of Anacreon, to his friend and brother, Dr. Lewis Pirenne, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, of the EncyclopediaFoundation Number One,\" and it ended even more lavishly with a gigantic,multicolored seal of the most involved symbolism. But it was an ultimatum just the same. Hardin said: \"It turned out that we didn\u0027t have much time after all ?onlythree months. But little as it was, we threw it away unused. This thinghere gives us a week. What do we do now?\"Pirenne frowned worriedly. \"There must be a loophole. It is absolutelyunbelievable that they would push matters to extremities in the face ofwhat Lord Dorwin has assured us regarding the attitude of the Emperor andthe Empire.\"Hardin perked up. \"I see. You have informed the King of Anacreon of thisalleged attitude?\"\"I did ? after having placed the proposal to the Board for a vote andhaving received unanimous consent.\"\"And when did this vote take place?\"Pirenne climbed onto his dignity. \"I do not believe I am answerable to youin any way, Mayor Hardin.\"\"All right. I\u0027m not that vitally interested. It\u0027s just my opinion that itwas your diplomatic transmission of Lord Dorwin\u0027s valuable contribution tothe situation\"?he lifted the comer of his mouth in a sour half-smile?that was the direct cause of this friendly little note. They might havedelayed longer otherwise ?though I don\u0027t think the additional time wouldhave helped Terminus any, considering the attitude of the Board.\"Said Yate Fulham: \"And just how do you arrive at that remarkableconclusion, Mr. Mayor?\"\"In a rather simple way. It merely required the use of that much-neglectedcommodity ? common sense. You see, there is a branch of human knowledgeknown as symbolic logic, which can be used to prune away all sorts ofclogging deadwood that clutters up human language.\"\"What about it?\" said Fulham. \"I applied it. Among other things, I applied it to this document here. Ididn\u0027t really need to for myself because I knew what it was all about, butI think I can explain it more easily to five physical scientists by symbolsrather than by words.\"Hardin removed a few sheets of paper from the pad under his arm and spreadthem out. \"I didn\u0027t do this myself, by the way,\" he said. \"Muller Holk ofthe Division of Logic has his name signed to the analyses, as you can see.\"Pirenne leaned over the table to get a better view and Hardin continued: \"The message from Anacreon was a simple problem, naturally, for the men whowrote it were men of action rather than men of words. It boils down easilyand straightforwardly to the unqualified statement, when in symbols is whatyou see, and which in words, roughly translated, is, \u0027You give us what wewant in a week, or we take it by force.\u0027\"There was silence as the five members of the Board ran down the line ofsymbols, and then Pirenne sat down and coughed uneasily. Hardin said, \"No loophole, is there, Dr. Pirenne?\"\"Doesn\u0027t seem to be.\"\"All right.\" Hardin replaced the sheets. \"Before you now you see a copy ofthe treaty between the Empire and Anacreon ?a treaty, incidentally, whichis signed on the Emperor\u0027s behalf by the same Lord Dorwin who was here lastweek ?and with it a symbolic analysis.\"The treaty ran through five pages of fine print and the analysis wasscrawled out in just under half a page. \"As you see, gentlemen, something like ninety percent of the treaty boiledright out of the analysis as being meaningless, and what we end up with canbe described in the following interesting manner: \"Obligations of Anacreon to the Empire: None! \"Powers of the Empire over Anacreon: None!\"Again the five followed the reasoning anxiously, checking carefully back tothe treaty, and when they were finished, Pirenne said in a worried fashion,\"That seems to be correct.\"\"You admit, then, that the treaty is nothing but a declaration of totalindependence on the part of Anacreon and a recognition of that status bythe Empire?\"\"It seems so.\"\"And do you suppose that Anacreon doesn\u0027t realize that, and is not anxiousto emphasize the position of independence ?so that it would naturally tendto resent any appearance of threats from the Empire? Particularly when itis evident that the Empire is powerless to fulfill any such threats, or itwould never have allowed independence.\"\"But then,\" interposed Sutt, \"how would Mayor Hardin account for LordDorwin\u0027s assurances of Empire support? They seemed ? He shrugged. \"Well,they seemed satisfactory.\"Hardin threw himself back in the chair. \"You know, that\u0027s the mostinteresting part of the whole business. I\u0027ll admit I had thought hisLordship a most consummate donkey when I first met him ?but it turned outthat he was actually an accomplished diplomat and a most clever man. I tookthe liberty of recording all his statements.\"There was a flurry, and Pirenne opened his mouth in horror. \"What of it?\" demanded Hardin. \"I realize it was a gross breach ofhospitality and a thing no so-called gentleman would do. Also, that if hislordship had caught on, things might have been unpleasant; but he didn\u0027t,and I have the record, and that\u0027s that. I took that record, had it copiedout and sent that to Holk for analysis, also.\"Lundin Crast said, \"And where is the analysis?\"\"That,\" replied Hardin, \"is the interesting thing. The analysis was themost difficult of the three by all odds. When Holk, after two days ofsteady work, succeeded in eliminating meaningless statements, vaguegibberish, useless qualifications ? in short, all the goo and dribble ?hefound he had nothing left. Everything canceled out.\"\"Lord Dorwin, gentlemen, in five days of discussion didn\u0027t say one damnedthing, and said it so you never noticed. There are the assurances you hadfrom your precious Empire.\"Hardin might have placed an actively working stench bomb on the table andcreated no more confusion than existed after his last statement. He waited,with weary patience, for it to die down. \"So,\" he concluded, \"when you sent threats ?and that\u0027s what they were ? concerning Empire action to Anacreon, you merely irritated a monarch whoknew better. Naturally, his ego would demand immediate action, and theultimatum is the result-which brings me to my original statement. We haveone week left and what do we do now?\"\"It seems,\" said Sutt, \"that we have no choice but to allow Anacreon toestablish military bases on Terminus.\"\"I agree with you there,\" replied Hardin, \"but what do we do toward kickingthem off again at the first opportunity?\"Yate Fulham\u0027s mustache twitched. \"That sounds as if you have made up yourmind that violence must be used against them.\"\"Violence,\" came the retort, \"is the last refuge of the incompetent. But Icertainly don\u0027t intend to lay down the welcome mat and brush off the bestfurniture for their use.\"\"I still don\u0027t like the way you put that,\" insisted Fulham. \"It is adangerous attitude; the more dangerous because we have noticed lately thata sizable section of the populace seems to respond to all your suggestionsjust so. I might as well tell you, Mayor Hardin, that the board is notquite blind to your recent activities.\"He paused and there was general agreement. Hardin shrugged. Fulham went on: \"If you were to inflame the City into an act of violence,you would achieve elaborate suicide ? and we don\u0027t intend to allow that. Our policy has but one cardinal principle, and that is the Encyclopedia. Whatever we decide to do or not to do will be so decided because it will bethe measure required to keep that Encyclopedia safe.\"\"Then,\" said Hardin, \"you come to the conclusion that we must continue ourintensive campaign of doing nothing.\"Pirenne said bitterly: \"You have yourself demonstrated that the Empirecannot help us; though how and why it can be so, I don\u0027t understand. Ifcompromise is necessary? Hardin had the nightmarelike sensation of running at top speed and gettingnowhere. \"There is no compromise! Don\u0027t you realize that this bosh aboutmilitary bases is a particularly inferior grade of drivel? Haut Rodric toldus what Anacreon was after ?outright annexation and imposition of its ownfeudal system of landed estates and peasant-aristocracy economy upon us. What is left of our bluff of nuclear power may force them to move slowly,but they will move nonetheless.\"He had risen indignantly, and the rest rose with him except for Jord Fara. And then Jord Fara spoke. \"Everyone will please sit down. We\u0027ve gone quitefar enough, I think. Come, there\u0027s no use looking so furious, Mayor Hardin;none of us have been committing treason.\"\"You\u0027ll have to convince me of that!\"Fara smiled gently. \"You know you don\u0027t mean that. Let me speak!\"His little shrewd eyes were half closed, and the perspiration gleamed onthe smooth expanse of his chin. \"There seems no point in concealing thatthe Board has come to the decision that the real solution to theAnacreonian problem lies in what is to be revealed to us when the Vaultopens six days from now.\"\"Is that your contribution to the matter?\"\"Yes.\"\"We are to do nothing, is that fight, except to wait in quiet serenity andutter faith for the deus ex machina to pop out of the Vault?\"\"Stripped of your emotional phraseology, that\u0027s the idea.\"\"Such unsubtle escapism! Really, Dr. Fara, such folly smacks of genius. Alesser mind would be incapable of it.\"Fara smiled indulgently. \"Your taste in epigrams is amusing, Hardin, butout of place. As a matter of fact, I think you remember my line of argumentconcerning the Vault about three weeks ago.\"\"Yes, I remember it. I don\u0027t deny that it was anything but a stupid ideafrom the standpoint of deductive logic alone. You said ?stop me when Imake a mistake ?that Hari Seldon was the greatest psychologist in theSystem; that, hence, he could foresee the right and uncomfortable spotwe\u0027re in now; that, hence, he established the Vault as a method of tellingus the way out.\"\"You\u0027ve got the essence of the idea.\"\"Would it surprise you to hear that I\u0027ve given considerable thought to thematter these last weeks?\"\"Very flattering. With what result?\"\"With the result that pure deduction is found wanting. Again what is neededis a little sprinkling of common sense.\"\"For instance?\"\"For instance, if he foresaw the Anacreonian mess, why not have placed uson some other planet nearer the Galactic centers? It\u0027s well known thatSeldon maneuvered the Commissioners on Trantor into ordering the Foundationestablished on Terminus. But why should he have done so? Why put us outhere at all if he could see in advance the break in communication lines,our isolation from the Galaxy, the threat of our neighbors ? and ourhelplessness because of the lack of metals on Terminus? That above all! Orif he foresaw all this, why not have warned the original settlers inadvance that they might have had time to prepare, rather than wait, as heis doing, until one foot is over the cliff, before doing so? \"And don\u0027t forget this. Even though he could foresee the problem then, wecan see it equally well now. Therefore, if he could foresee the solutionthen, we should be able to see it now. After all, Seldon was not amagician. There are no trick methods of escaping from a dilemma that he cansee and we can\u0027t.\"\"But, Hardin,\" reminded Fara, \"we can\u0027t!\"\"But you haven\u0027t tried. You haven\u0027t tried once. First, you refused to admitthat there was a menace at all! Then you reposed an absolutely blind faithin the Emperor! Now you\u0027ve shifted it to Hari Seldon. Throughout you haveinvariably relied on authority or on the past ?never on yourselves.\"His fists balled spasmodically. \"It amounts to a diseased attitude ?aconditioned reflex that shunts aside the independence of your mindswhenever it is a question of opposing authority. There seems no doubt everin your minds that the Emperor is more powerful than you are, or HariSeldon wiser. And that\u0027s wrong, don\u0027t you see?\"For some reason, no one cared to answer him. Hardin continued: \"It isn\u0027t just you. It\u0027s the whole Galaxy. Pirenne heardLord Dorwin\u0027s idea of scientific research. Lord Dorwin thought the way tobe a good archaeologist was to read all the books on the subject ?writtenby men who were dead for centuries. He thought that the way to solvearchaeological puzzles was to weigh the opposing authorities. And Pirennelistened and made no objections. Don\u0027t you see that there\u0027s something wrongwith that?\"Again the note of near-pleading in his voice. Again no answer. He went on: \"And you men and half of Terminus as well are just as bad. Wesit here, considering the Encyclopedia the all-in-all. We consider thegreatest end of science. is the classification of past data. It isimportant, but is there no further work to be done? We\u0027re receding andforgetting, don\u0027t you see? Here in the Periphery they\u0027ve lost nuclearpower. In Gamma Andromeda, a power plant has undergone meltdown because ofpoor repairs, and the Chancellor of the Empire complains that nucleartechnicians are scarce. And the solution? To train new ones? Never! Insteadthey\u0027re to restrict nuclear power.\"And for the third time: \"Don\u0027t you see? It\u0027s Galaxywide. It\u0027s a worship ofthe past. It\u0027s a deterioration ?a stagnation!\"He stared from one to the other and they gazed fixedly at him. Fara was the first to recover. \"Well, mystical philosophy isn\u0027t going tohelp us here. Let us be concrete. Do you deny that Hari Seldon could easilyhave worked out historical trends of the future by simple psychologicaltechnique?\"\"No, of course not,\" cried Hardin. \"But we can\u0027t rely on him for asolution. At best, he might indicate the problem, but if ever there is tobe a solution, we must work it out ourselves. He can\u0027t do it for us.\"Fulham spoke suddenly. \"What do you mean ?\u0027indicate the problem\u0027? We knowthe problem.\"Hardin whirled on him. \"You think you do? You think Anacreon is all HariSeldon is likely to be worried about. I disagree! I tell you, gentlemen,that as yet none of you has the faintest conception of what is really goingon.\"\"And you do?\" questioned Pirenne, hostilely. \"I think so!\" Hardin jumped up and pushed his chair away. His eyes werecold and hard. \"If there\u0027s one thing that\u0027s definite, it is that there\u0027ssomething smelly about the whole situation; something that is bigger thananything we\u0027ve talked about yet. Just ask yourself this question: Why wasit that among the original population of the Foundation not one first-classpsychologist was included, except Bor Alurin? And he carefully refrainedfrom training his pupils in more than the fundamentals.\"A short silence and Fara said: \"All right. Why?\"\"Perhaps because a psychologist might have caught on to what this was allabout ? and too soon to suit Hari Seldon. As it is, we\u0027ve been stumblingabout, getting misty glimpses of the truth and no more. And that is whatHari Seldon wanted.\"He laughed harshly. \"Good day, gentlemen!\"He stalked out of the room.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47154.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
