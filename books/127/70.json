{"id":3500,"no":70,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"Commdor Asper was a man of the people, by self-acclamation. His remainingback-fringe of gray hair drooped limply to his shoulders, his shirt neededlaundering, and he spoke with a snuffle. \n \"There is no ostentation here, Trader Mallow,\" he said. \"No false show. Inme, you see merely the first citizen of the state. That\u0027s what Commdormeans, and that\u0027s the only title I have.\"He seemed inordinately pleased with it all, \"in fact, I consider that factone of the strongest bonds between Korell and your nation. I understand youpeople enjoy the republican blessings we do.\"\"Exactly, Commdor,\" said Mallow gravely, taking mental exception to thecomparison, \"an argument which I consider strongly in favor of continuedpeace and friendship between our governments.\"\"Peace! Ah!\" The Commdor\u0027s sparse gray beard twitched to the sentimentalgrimaces of his face. \"I don\u0027t think there is anyone in the Periphery whohas so near his heart the ideal of Peace, as I have. I can truthfully saythat since I succeeded my illustrious father to the leadership of thestate, the reign of Peace has never been broken. Perhaps I shouldn\u0027t sayit\" 杊e coughed gently? \"but I have been told that my people, myfellow-citizens rather, know me as Asper, the Well-Beloved.\"Mallow\u0027s eyes wandered over the well-kept garden. Perhaps the tall men andthe strangely-designed but openly-vicious weapons they carried justhappened to be lurking in odd comers as a precaution against himself. Thatwould be understandable. But the lofty, steel-girdered walls that circledthe place had quite obviously been recently strengthened ? an unfittingoccupation for such a Well-Beloved Asper. \n He said, \"It is fortunate that I have you to deal with then, Commdor. Thedespots and monarchs of surrounding worlds, which haven\u0027t the benefit ofenlightened administration, often lack the qualities that would make aruler well-beloved.\"\"Such as?\" There was a cautious note in the Commdor\u0027s voice. \n \"Such as a concern for the best interests of their people, You, on theother hand, would understand,\"The Commdor kept his eyes on the gravel path as they walked leisurely, Hishands caressed each other behind his back. \n Mallow went on smoothly, \"Up to now, trade between our two nations hassuffered because of the restrictions placed upon our traders by yourgovernment. Surely, it has long been evident to you that unlimited trade? \n \"Free Trade!\" mumbled the Commdor. \n \"Free Trade, then. You must see that it would be of benefit to both of us. \n There are things you have that we want, and things we have that you want. \n It asks only an exchange to bring increased prosperity. An enlightenedruler such as yourself, a friend of the people ?I might say, a member ofthe people ? needs no elaboration on that theme. I won\u0027t insult yourintelligence by offering any.\"\"True! I have seen this. But what would you?\" His voice was a plaintivewhine. \"Your people have always been so unreasonable. I am in favor of allthe trade our economy can support, but not on your terms. I am not solemaster here.\" His voice rose, \"I am only the servant of public opinion. Mypeople will not take commerce which carries with it a compulsory religion.\"Mallow drew himself up, \"A compulsory religion?\"\"So it has always been in effect. Surely you remember the case of Askonetwenty years ago. First they were sold some of your goods and then yourpeople asked for complete freedom of missionary effort in order that thegoods might be run properly; that Temples of Health be set up. There wasthen the establishment of religious schools; autonomous rights for allofficers of the religion and with what result? Askone is now an integralmember of the Foundation\u0027s system and the Grand Master cannot call hisunderwear his own. Oh, no! Oh, no! The dignity of an independent peoplecould never suffer it.\"\"None of what you speak is at all what I suggest,\" interposed Mallow. \n \"No?\"\"No. I\u0027m a Master Trader. Money is my religion. All this mysticism andhocus-pocus of the missionaries annoy me, and I\u0027m glad you refuse tocountenance it. It makes you more my type of man.\"The Commdor\u0027s laugh was high-pitched and jerky, \"Well said! The Foundationshould have sent a man of your caliber before this.\"He laid a friendly hand upon the trader\u0027s bulking shoulder, \"But man, youhave told me only half. You have told me what the catch is not. Now tell mewhat it is.\"\"The only catch, Commdor, is that you\u0027re going to be burdened with animmense quantity of riches.\"\"Indeed?\" he snuffled. \"But what could I want with riches? The true wealthis the love of one\u0027s people. I have that.\"\"You can have both, for it is possible to gather gold with one hand andlove with the other.\"\"Now that, my young man, would be an interesting phenomenon, if it werepossible. How would you go about it?\"\"Oh, in a number of ways. The difficulty is choosing among them. Let\u0027s see. \n Well, luxury items, for instance. This object here, now? \n Mallow drew gently out of an inner pocket a flat, linked chain of polishedmetal. \"This, for instance.\"\"What is it?\"\"That\u0027s got to be demonstrated. Can you get a woman? Any young female willdo. And a mirror, full length.\"\"Hm-mmm. Let\u0027s get indoors, then.\"The Commdor referred to his dwelling place as a house. The populaceundoubtedly would call it a palace. To Mallow\u0027s straightforward eyes, itlooked uncommonly like a fortress. it was built on an eminence thatoverlooked the capital. Its walls were thick and reinforced. Its approacheswere guarded, and its architecture was shaped for defense. Just the type ofdwelling, Mallow thought sourly, for Asper, the Well-Beloved. \n A young girl was before them. She bent low to the Commdor, who said, \"Thisis one of the Commdora\u0027s girls. Will she do?\"\"Perfectly!\"The Commdor watched carefully while Mallow snapped the chain about thegirl\u0027s waist, and stepped back. \n The Commdor snuffled, \"Well. Is that all?\"\"Will you draw the curtain, Commdor. Young lady, there\u0027s a little knob justnear the snap. Will you move it upward, please? Go ahead, it won\u0027t hurtyou.\"The girl did so, drew a sharp breath, looked at her hands, and gasped,\"Oh!\"From her waist as a source she was drowned in a pale, streamingluminescence of shifting color that drew itself over her head in a flashingcoronet of liquid fire. It was as if someone had tom the aurora borealisout of the sky and molded it into a cloak. \n The girl stepped to the mirror and stared, fascinated. \n \"Here, take this.\" Mallow handed her a necklace of dull pebbles. \"Put itaround your neck.\"The girl did so, and each pebble, as it entered the luminescent fieldbecame an individual flame that leaped and sparkled in crimson and gold. \n \"What do you think of it?\" Mallow asked her. The girl didn\u0027t answer butthere was adoration in her eyes. The Commdor gestured and reluctantly, shepushed the knob down, and the glory died. She left ? with a memory. \n \"It\u0027s yours, Commdor,\" said Mallow, \"for the Commdora. Consider it a smallgift from the Foundation.\"\"Hm-mmm.\u0027 The Commdor turned the belt and necklace over in his hand asthough calculating the weight. \"How is it done?\"Mallow shrugged, \"That\u0027s a question for our technical experts. But it willwork for you without ? mark you, without ? priestly help.\"\"Well, it\u0027s only feminine frippery after all. What could you do with it? \n Where would the money come in?\"\"You have balls, receptions, banquets ? that sort of thing?\"\"Oh, yes.\"\"Do you realize what women will pay for that sort of jewelry? Ten thousandcredits, at least.\"The Commdor seemed struck in a heap, \"Ah!\"\"And since the power unit of this particular item will not last longer thansix months, there will be the necessity of frequent replacements. Now wecan sell as many of these as you want for the equivalent in wrought iron ofone thousand credits. There\u0027s nine hundred percent profit for you.\"The Commdor plucked at his beard and seemed engaged in awesome mentalcalculations, \"Galaxy, how they would fight for them. I\u0027ll keep the supplysmall and let them bid. Of course, it wouldn\u0027t do to let them know that Ipersonally? \n Mallow said, \"We can explain the workings of dummy corporations, if youwould like. 朤hen, working further at random, take our complete line ofhousehold gadgets. We have collapsible stoves that will roast the toughestmeats to the desired tenderness in two minutes. We\u0027ve got knives that won\u0027trequire sharpening. We\u0027ve got the equivalent of a complete laundry that canbe packed in a small closet and will work entirely automatically. Dittodish-washers. Ditto-ditto floor-scrubbers, furniture polishers,dust-precipitators, lighting fixtures ?oh, anything you like. Think ofyour increased popularity, if you make them available to the public. Thinkof your increased quantity of, uh, worldly goods, if they\u0027re available as agovernment monopoly at nine hundred percent profit. It will be worth manytimes the money to them, and they needn\u0027t know what you pay for it. And,mind you, none of it will require priestly supervision. Everybody will behappy.\"\"Except you, it seems. What do you get out of it?\"\"Just what every trader gets by Foundation law. My men and I will collecthalf of whatever profits we take in. Just you buy all I want to sell you,and we\u0027ll both make out quite well. Quite well.\"The Commdor was enjoying his thoughts, \"What did you say you wanted to bepaid with? Iron?\"\"That, and coal, and bauxite. Also tobacco, pepper, magnesium, hardwood. \n Nothing you haven\u0027t got enough of.\"\"It sounds well.\"\"I think so. Oh, and still another item at random, Commdor. I could retoolyour factories.\"\"Eh? How\u0027s that?\"\"Well, take your steel foundries. I have handy little gadgets that could dotricks with steel that would cut production costs to one percent ofprevious marks. You could cut prices by half, and still split extremely fatprofits with the manufacturers. I tell you, I could show you exactly what Imean, if you allowed me a demonstration. Do you have a steel foundry inthis city? It wouldn\u0027t take long.\"\"It could be arranged, Trader Mallow. But tomorrow, tomorrow. Would youdine with us tonight?\"\"My men? began Mallow. \n \"Let them all come,\" said the Commdor, expansively. \"A symbolic friendlyunion of our nations. It will give us a chance for further friendlydiscussion. But one thing,\" his face lengthened and grew stem, \"none ofyour religion. Don\u0027t think that all this is an entering wedge for themissionaries.\"\"Commdor,\" said Mallow, dryly, \"I give you my word that religion would cutmy profits.\"\"Then that will do for now. You\u0027ll be escorted back to your ship.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47242.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
