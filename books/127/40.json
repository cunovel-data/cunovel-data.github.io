{"id":3470,"no":40,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"The snow had ceased, but it caked the ground deeply now and the sleekground car advanced through the deserted streets with lumbering effort. Themurky gray light of incipient dawn was cold not only in the poetical sensebut also in a very literal way ?and even in the then turbulent state ofthe Foundation\u0027s politics, no one, whether Actionist or pro-Hardin foundhis spirits sufficiently ardent to begin street activity that early. \n Yohan Lee did not like that and his grumblings grew audible. \"It\u0027s going tolook bad, Hardin. They\u0027re going to say you sneaked away.\"\"Let them say it if they wish. I\u0027ve got to get to Anacreon and I want to doit without trouble. Now that\u0027s enough, Lee.\"Hardin leaned back into the cushioned seat and shivered slightly. It wasn\u0027tcold inside the well-heated car, but there was something frigid about asnow-covered world, even through glass, that annoyed him. \n He said, reflectively, \"Some day when we get around to it we ought toweather-condition Terminus. It could be done.\"\"I,\" replied Lee, \"would like to see a few other things done first. Forinstance, what about weather-conditioning Sermak? A nice, dry cell fittedfor twenty-five centigrade all year round would be just fight.\"\"And then I\u0027d really need bodyguards,\" said Hardin, \"and not just thosetwo,\" He indicated two of Lee\u0027s bully-boys sitting up front with thedriver, hard eyes on the empty streets, ready hands at their atom blasts. \n \"You evidently want to stir up civil war.\"\"I do? There are other sticks in the fire and it won\u0027t require muchstirring, I can tell you.\" He counted off on blunt fingers, \"One: Sermakraised hell yesterday in the City Council and called for an impeachment.\"\"He had a perfect right to do so,\" responded Hardin, coolly. \"Besideswhich, his motion was defeated 206 to 184.\"\"Certainly. A majority of twenty-two when we had counted on sixty as aminimum. Don\u0027t deny it; you know you did.\"\"It was close,\" admitted Hardin. \n \"All right. And two; after the vote, the fifty-nine members of theActionist Party reared upon their hind legs and stamped out of the CouncilChambers.\"Hardin was silent, and Lee continued, \"And three: Before leaving, Sermakhowled that you were a traitor, that you were going to Anacreon to collectyour payment, that the Chamber majority in refusing to vote impeachment hadparticipated in the treason, and that the name of their party was not\u0027Actionist\u0027 for nothing. What does that sound like?\"\"Trouble, I suppose.\"\"And now you\u0027re chasing off at daybreak, like a criminal. You ought to facethem, Hardin ?and if you have to, declare martial law, by space!\"\"Violence is the last refuge? \n \"朞f the incompetent. Bah!\"\"All right. We\u0027ll see. Now listen to me carefully, Lee. Thirty years ago,the Time Vault opened, and on the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning ofthe Foundation, there appeared a Hari Seldon recording to give us our firstidea of what was really going on.\"\"I remember,\" Lee nodded reminiscently, with a half smile. \"It was the daywe took over the government.\"\"That\u0027s right. It was the time of our first major crisis. This is oursecond-and three weeks from today will be the eightieth anniversary of thebeginning of the Foundation. Does that strike you as in any waysignificant?\"\"You mean he\u0027s coming again?\"\"I\u0027m not finished. Seldon never said anything about returning, youunderstand, but that\u0027s of a piece with his whole plan. He\u0027s always done hisbest to keep all foreknowledge from us. Nor is there any way of tellingwhether the computer is set for further openings short of dismantling theVault ? and it\u0027s probably set to destroy itself if we were to try that. \n I\u0027ve been there every anniversary since the first appearance, just on thechance. He\u0027s never shown up, but this is the first time since then thatthere\u0027s really been a crisis.\"\"Then he\u0027ll come.\"\"Maybe. I don\u0027t know. However, this is the point. At today\u0027s session of theCouncil, just after you announce that I have left for Anacreon, you willfurther announce, officially, that on March 14th next, there will beanother Hari Seldon recording, containing a message of the utmostimportance regarding the recent successfully concluded crisis. That\u0027s veryimportant, Lee. Don\u0027t add anything more no matter how many questions areasked.\"Lee stared. \"Will they believe it?\"\"That doesn\u0027t matter. It will confuse them, which is all I want. Betweenwondering whether it is true and what I mean by it if it isn\u0027t ?they\u0027lldecide to postpone action till after March 14th. I\u0027ll be back considerablybefore then.\"Lee looked uncertain. \"But that \u0027successfully concluded.\u0027 That\u0027s bull!\"\"Highly confusing bull. Here\u0027s the airport!\"The waiting spaceship bulked somberly in the dimness. Hardin stampedthrough the snow toward it and at the open air lock turned about withoutstretched hand. \n \"Good-by, Lee. I hate to leave you in the frying pan like this, but there\u0027snot another I can trust. Now please keep out of the fire.\"\"Don\u0027t worry. The frying pan is hot enough. I\u0027ll follow orders.\" He steppedback, and the air lock closed. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47168.html","bookId":127,"book":{"id":127,"title":"基地系列 FOUNDATION 基地","description":"简介： 1966年擊敗了「魔戒」系列，奪得世界科幻大會雨果獎「永遠最佳系列小說」延續已達一萬二千年，統領疆域廣達數百萬星球的古老銀河帝國，正在緩慢的步上無可挽回的衰亡之路。哈里．謝頓 (Hari Seldon) --未來史學的創造者，計算出在銀河帝國滅亡後隨之而來的將是長達三萬...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/23/10-50-50-24-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:43 AM"}}
