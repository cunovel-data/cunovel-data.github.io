You do like tassels, don’t you?”\\n\\n “Tassels?”\\n\\n “Shh.” Summer looked around to be sure no one was listening. “I’ll save them for after the honeymoon.”\\n\\n “Why?”\\n\\n “Because, my darling husband, they cover—” She stopped abruptly.\\n\\n “Yes?” he coaxed.\\n\\n “Husband,” she said the word as if saying a prayer. “James, you’re my husband.”\\n\\n “I know. And you’re my wife.” It hit him then, too. The beauty of it, of belonging to each other, of the word itself.\\n\\n Their families all seemed to return at once.\\n\\n “I don’t know about anyone else,” Helen Lawton was saying, “but I’m starved.”\\n\\n There was a chorus of agreement. They trooped into the hotel’s elegant restaurant and ordered dinner and champagne, although Summer could barely eat and had trouble following the conversation.\\n\\n “We’ll say good-night, then,” James announced the minute they could leave without being rude. “Thank you all for making this the most incredible day of my life.”\\n\\n “It’s still early,” Helen protested.\\n\\n “Helen,” Hank snapped. “Think about it.”\\n\\n “Oh, yes, sorry.” Helen’s face brightened, and she smiled apologetically at James.\\n\\n “Will we see you in the morning?”\\n\\n “Helen!” her husband growled.\\n\\n “I’m just asking, Hank. What harm is there in asking?”\\n\\n “I don’t know, Mom. What time is your flight?”\\n\\n James didn’t listen to the answer, although he supposed he should have. As it was, he had a hard time hiding his impatience. He and his wife—his wife—would only have two more days together. Luckily that was two days and three nights. Their flights were leaving within a half hour of each other, and then it would be a whole month before he saw her again.\\n\\n “All right, then, darling,” Helen said, hugging Summer, “we’ll see you both in the morning.”\\n\\n The entourage left, and James was alone with Summer at last.\\n\\n “Are we going to my room or yours?” she asked, smiling up at him.\\n\\n “Neither. I rented the honeymoon suite here for the rest of our stay. Your mother packed your suitcase and had it sent over.”\\n\\n “You think of everything.” She reached up and removed the wedding veil and shook her head, freeing her curls. “I can’t tell you how anxious I am to get out of this dress.”\\n\\n James chuckled as he led the way to the elevator. “Not nearly as anxious as I am to get you out of it.”\\n\\n “Who were all those guests?” she asked him when they stepped inside the elevator car.\\n\\n “I thought they were friends of your family.”\\n\\n “I’ve never seen them before in my life.”\\n\\n James shrugged. “Me, neither.”\\n\\n “You know what? I’ll bet my mother invited them. She couldn’t bear to have us married in an empty chapel.”\\n\\n James fingered his room key. “Are you hungry?”\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n “Good. Let’s go work up an appetite.”\\n\\n Summer smiled and moistened her lips with the tip of her tongue. “I have a feeling you aren’t talking about racquetball.”\\n\\n James cleared his throat. He wanted her so much his body trembled with the strength of his need. “You’re right about that.”\\n\\n Six\\n\\n James astonished Summer. She didn’t know what to expect from him as a lover, but it wasn’t this. They’d made love no less than three times during their wedding night, and Summer woke the following morning to find him standing at the foot of their bed, fresh from the shower.\\n\\n His nude body glistened in the early-morning light. Droplets of water dripped from his hair and onto the dark curls that covered his chest.\\n\\n “Good morning, Mrs. Wilkens.”\\n\\n Summer smiled and stretched her arms high above her head, arching her back. The sheet slipped away, exposing her breasts.\\n\\n “Good morning, James.” She saw that he was fully aroused and slowly lifted her gaze to his. Already her body was responding to him, throbbing with readiness and need. James’s eyes narrowed as they focused on her.\\n\\n Wordlessly she knelt on the bed and held out her arms to him. She smiled, thinking someone should’ve warned her about this man before they were married. At this rate, they’d both be dead within a week.\\n\\n He walked over to the side of the bed, kissed her once, twice, and then knelt beside it.\\n\\n All her life Summer had never experienced such power. Or such love. Her breathing grew slow and shallow. She half closed her eyes in pleasure at the simple touch of his hand.\\n\\n James groaned, and Summer recognized his meaning. He couldn’t wait any longer. Neither could she. She threw her arms around his neck and slowly lay back against the bed, bringing him with her.\\n\\n She smiled contentedly as they began to make love. All of a sudden her eyes flew open. “James, you forgot—”\\n\\n “It’ll be all right,” he assured her breathlessly. “Just this one time.”\\n\\n She didn’t want him to stop. Not now. “Okay.”\\n\\n James reached his climax soon after she experienced hers. A harsh groan tore from his throat, and his powerful body shuddered.\\n\\n His shoulders still heaving, he gathered her in his arms and spread soft, delicate kisses over her face. He started to move away from her, but she wouldn’t let him.\\n\\n “Not yet,” she pleaded. “I want to be a part of you.”\\n\\n “You are. You always will be. You could travel to Mars, and my heart would be with you.” He brushed the damp hair from her forehead. “I can’t believe you love me.”\\n\\n “I do, so much my heart feels like it’s about to burst wide open. Will it always be like this?” she asked. “Two weeks ago, you were someone whose letters I looked forward to. This week you’re the most important person in my life.”\\n\\n James kissed the tip of her nose. “It’s only going to get better from here on out.”\\n\\n “Better?” She laughed delightedly. “I can’t imagine it.”\\n\\n In one uninterrupted movement James rolled onto his back, taking her with him so she was sprawled across his chest. Across his heart. “I can’t, either. Summer, I love you.”\\n\\n “Good.” She pressed her head against his shoulder. “But what about—”\\n\\n “I’ll remember next time,” he promised. “The last thing we need now is an unplanned pregnancy.”\\n\\n “I’m pretty sure this is my safe time, so don’t worry.”\\n\\n James kissed her neck. “I suppose we should get dressed and meet everyone for breakfast.”\\n\\n “I suppose,” she agreed, but neither of them showed any signs of moving.\\n\\n “It won’t be so bad,” James whispered.\\n\\n They’d been married less than twenty-four hours and already Summer could read her husband’s thoughts. “Being separated? It’s going to be terrible. I don’t know how I’ll last four months without you.”\\n\\n “Four months.” He made it sound like an eternity.\\n\\n “James, where do you live?”\\n\\n He gave her a puzzled look. “Seattle. You know my address.”\\n\\n “But is it an apartment? A condo? A town house or what?”\\n\\n “A house.”\\n\\n Summer liked the idea of that.\\n\\n A slow grin spread across his face. “I must’ve known I was going to meet you. This is a big house on Queen Anne Hill with seven bedrooms.”\\n\\n “James!”\\n\\n “It’s a lovely older home. I’m quite proud of the garden. I hope you’ll like it.”\\n\\n “I love it already.”\\n\\n “You haven’t seen it.”\\n\\n “No, but I saw the look on your face when you talked about it. The house is going to be perfect for us, just perfect.”\\n\\n His eyes grew dark. “You’re perfect.”\\n\\n “I hope we’ll always love each other as much as we do at this moment.” Summer laid her head on his chest and sighed.\\n\\n Time had never passed more quickly for James. He’d dreaded leaving Summer almost from the moment they’d met again on New Year’s Eve. It was as though Seattle was another world, one he wasn’t that eager to return to. Not when it meant having to say goodbye to Summer.\\n\\n His wife of two days was unusually quiet as they packed their suitcases on Saturday morning, the day of their departure. When she found him watching her, she offered him a reassuring smile.\\n\\n The bellboy carried their luggage to the lobby. While James was checking out of the hotel, he noticed Summer twisting the plain gold band around her finger. His own felt awkward and heavy, and he wondered if she was experiencing any regrets. For his own part, he didn’t have a single one.\\n\\n Having returned the rental car earlier, James ordered a car. He and Summer held hands as they rode silently to the airport.\\n\\n He wanted to assure her it wouldn’t be so bad, but that would’ve been a blatant lie. Every minute he was away from her was a minute too long. He wanted to be sure she understood how much he loved her, how crucial she was to him. But the backseat of a limo with a driver listening in didn’t seem the most appropriate place to tell her those things.\\n\\n Nothing would ever be the same for either of them, and they both knew it.\\n\\n The car dropped them off, and since they were flying on different airlines, they separated to check in their luggage and receive their seat assignments.\\n\\n James finished first and caught sight of Summer hurrying through the crowd toward him. Even from that distance he sensed her sadness. He met her halfway and they went through security together.\\n\\n “My flight leaves from Concourse B,” she said, looking down at her ticket. Her voice was small and tight.\\n\\n “Mine’s Concourse A.”\\n\\n “What time’s your flight?”\\n\\n She already knew, but apparently needed to hear it again. “Ten-thirty,” James told her.\\n\\n “My departure’s at ten.”\\n\\n He was perfectly aware of what time her plane left. “I’ll walk down to Concourse B with you.”\\n\\n “You can’t, James, you might miss your own flight.”\\n\\n Frankly he didn’t give a damn. “Then I’ll catch the next one.”\\n\\n “I’ll worry. James, really, I’m a big girl. I can find my way around the airport.”\\n\\n “I didn’t say you couldn’t,” he snapped, surprising himself.\\n\\n Summer looked up at him, her eyes brimming with tears. She turned and walked away from him and headed for Concourse B.\\n\\n James followed and wanted to kick himself. He wouldn’t see his wife for weeks and here he was, apparently doing his utmost to start an argument. No doubt there was some psychological reason for his attitude. He’d examine what was happening later, but at the moment he was more concerned about saying goodbye to her properly. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-manning-grooms-those-manning-men-0/page-42.html","bookId":1982,"book":{"id":1982,"title":"The Manning Grooms (Those Manning Men #0)","description":"Storyline: The Manning Grooms (Those Manning Men #3-4) \\n Jason Manning is content with his life as a bachelor, a slob and a sports fan.
