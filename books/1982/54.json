Paul’s the author in the family.”\n “He’s very good,” Leah said proudly. “His first book was published last year, and he’s sold two more.”\n “That’s great!”\n “Let me help,” Jamie insisted, removing the platter from Elizabeth’s hands. She carried it to the long table, beautifully decorated with paper bells and a lovely ceramic bride-and-groom centerpiece.\n “I’ve been waiting for a long time to use these decorations,” Elizabeth said disparagingly. “My children didn’t give me the opportunity. It all started with the girls. Neither one of them saw fit to have a church wedding. Then Rich married Jamie and Paul married Leah, again without the kind of wedding I always wanted.”\n “Jason and Charlotte were the only ones to have a big wedding,” Leah explained. “I don’t think Eric and Elizabeth have ever forgiven the rest of us.”\n “You’re darn right, we haven’t,” Eric said, joining them.\n “They made it up to us with grandchildren, dear,” his wife interjected. “Now, don’t get started on that. We’re very fortunate.”\n Summer couldn’t remember the last time she’d sat down at a dinner table with this many people. A rowdy group of children ate at card tables set up in the kitchen. Twin boys seemed to instigate the chaos, taking delight in teasing their younger cousins. The noise level was considerable, but Summer didn’t mind.\n More than once, she caught James watching her. She smiled and silently conveyed that she was enjoying herself. Who wouldn’t be?\n There were gifts to open after the meal and plenty of marital advice. Summer, whose mood had been bleak earlier, found herself laughing so hard her sides ached.\n The evening was an unqualified success, and afterward Summer felt as if she’d met a houseful of new friends. Jamie, Leah and Charlotte seemed eager to make her feel welcome. Charlotte was the first to extend an invitation for lunch. Since they were both pregnant, they already had something important in common.\n “A week from Friday,” Charlotte reminded her as Summer and James prepared to leave. She mentioned the name of the restaurant and wrote her phone number on the back of a business card.\n “I’ll look forward to it,” Summer told her and meant it.\n It wasn’t until they were home that she remembered her meeting with Southworth. She didn’t know if she’d be in Seattle in another week, let alone available for lunch.\n Sadness pressed against her heart.\n James slipped his arm around her waist. He turned off the downstairs lights, and together they moved toward the stairs. “As I recall,” he whispered in her ear, “you made me a promise earlier.”\n “I did?”\n “You asked me to make love to you, remember?”\n “Oh, yes…” Shivers of awareness slid up and down her spine.\n “I certainly hope you intend to keep that promise.”\n She yawned loudly, covering her mouth, fighting back waves of tiredness. “I have no intention of changing my mind.”\n “Good.” They reached the top of the stairs, and he nuzzled her neck. “I wonder if it’ll always be like this,” he murmured, steering her toward their bedroom.\n “Like what?”\n “My desire for you. I feel like a kid in a candy store.”\n Summer laughed, then yawned again. “I enjoyed meeting the Mannings. They’re wonderful people.”\n “Are those yawns telling me something?” he asked.\n She nodded. “I’m tired, James.” But it was more than being physically weary. She felt a mental and emotional exhaustion that left her depleted.\n “Come on, love,” James urged gently. He led her into the bedroom and between long, deep kisses, he undressed her and placed her on the bed. He tucked her in and kissed her cheek.\n The light dimmed, and Summer snuggled into the warmth. It took her a few minutes to realize James hadn’t joined her.\n “James?” She forced her eyes open.\n “Yes, love?”\n “Aren’t you coming to bed?”\n “Soon,” he said. “I’m taking a shower first.”\n A shower, she mused, wondering at his sudden penchant for cleanliness.\n Then she heard him mutter, “A nice, long, cold shower.”\n James had been looking forward to the ultrasound appointment for weeks. He’d met Dr. Wise, Summer’s obstetrician, earlier and had immediately liked and trusted the man, who was in his late forties. David Wise had been delivering babies for more than twenty years, and his calm reassurance had gone a long way toward relieving James’s fears.\n The ultrasound clinic was in the same medical building as Dr. Wise’s office. He’d said he’d join them there, although James wasn’t convinced that was his regular policy. Still, he felt grateful.\n Summer sat next to him in the waiting room, her face pale and lifeless. She hadn’t been herself in the past few days, and James wondered what was bothering her. He didn’t want to pry and hoped she’d soon share whatever it was.\n They held hands and waited silently until Summer’s name was called.\n It was all James could do to sit still as the technician, a young woman named Rachel, explained the procedure.\n Summer was instructed to lie flat on her back on the examining table. Her T-shirt was raised to expose the bump that was their child. As James smiled down on her Dr. Wise entered the room.\n A gel was spread across Summer’s abdomen. It must have been cold because she flinched.\n “It’s about this time that women start to suggest the male of the species should be responsible for childbearing,” Dr. Wise told him.\n “No, thanks,” James said, “I like my role in all this just fine.”\n Dr. Wise chuckled. Rachel pressed a stethoscope-like instrument across Summer’s stomach, and everyone’s attention turned toward the monitor.\n James squinted but had trouble making out the details on the screen.\n “There’s the baby’s head,” Dr. Wise said, pointing to a curved shape.\n James squinted again and he noticed Summer doing the same.\n “Well, well. Look at this,” the physician continued. “I’m not altogether surprised.”\n “Look at what?” James studied the screen intently.\n “We have a second little head.”\n “My baby has two heads?” Summer cried in alarm.\n “Two heads?” James echoed.\n “What I’m saying,” Dr. Wise returned calmly, “is that there appear to be two babies.”\n “Twins?”\n “It certainly seems that way.” As the ultrasound technician moved the instrument across Summer’s abdomen, Dr. Wise pointed to the monitor. “Here’s the first head,” he said, tracing the barely discernible round curve, “and here’s the second.”\n James squinted for all he was worth just to see one. “Twins,” he murmured.\n “That explains a lot,” Dr. Wise said, patting Summer’s arm. “Let’s run a copy of this for you both,” he said, and Rachel pushed a series of buttons.\n Within minutes they had the printout to examine for themselves. While Summer dressed, James studied the picture.\n “Twins,” he said again, just for the pleasure of hearing himself say it. He turned to Summer and smiled broadly. “Twins,” he repeated, grinning from ear to ear.\n She smiled, and James thought he saw tears in her eyes.\n “It won’t be so bad,” he said, then immediately regretted his lack of sensitivity. He wasn’t the one carrying two babies, nor would he be the one delivering them. “I’ll do whatever I can to help,” he quickly reassured her.\n She gave him a watery smile.\n “Say something,” he pleaded. “Are you happy?”\n “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I’m still in shock. What about you?”\n “Other than the day I married you, I’ve never been happier.” He couldn’t seem to stop smiling. “I can hardly wait to tell my father. He’s going to be absolutely thrilled.”\n Summer stared at the ultrasound. “Can you tell? Boys? Girls? One of each?” Strangely, perhaps, it hadn’t occurred to her to ask Dr. Wise.\n James scratched his head. “I had enough trouble finding the two heads. I decided not to try deciphering anything else.”\n They left the doctor’s office and headed for the parking garage across the street.\n “This calls for a celebration. I’ll take you to lunch,” he said.\n “I was thinking more along the lines of a nap.”\n James grinned and looked at his watch. “Is there time?”\n “James,” she said, laughing softly. “I meant a real nap. I’m exhausted.”\n “Oh.” Disappointment shot through him. “You don’t want to celebrate with a fancy lunch?”\n She shook her head. “Don’t be upset with me. I guess I need time to think about everything.”\n That sounded odd to James. What was there to think about? True, Summer was pregnant with twins, but they had plenty of time to prepare. As for any mental readjustment, well, he’d made that in all of two seconds. The twins were a surprise, yes, but a pleasant one.\n “This news has upset you, hasn’t it?” he asked.\n “No,” she was quick to assure him. “It’s just that…well, it changes things.”\n “What things?”\n She shook her head again and didn’t answer. James frowned, not knowing how to calm her fears or allay her doubts. She didn’t seem to expect him to do either and instead appeared to be withdrawing into herself.\n “You don’t mind if I tell my dad, do you?” he asked. If he didn’t share the news with someone soon, he was afraid he’d be reduced to stopping strangers on the street.\n She smiled at him, her eyes alight with love. “No, I don’t mind if you tell Walter.”\n He walked her to where she’d parked and kissed her, then walked the short distance back to the King County Courthouse. His thoughts were so full of Summer that he went a block too far before he realized what he’d done.\n In his office, the first thing he did was reach for the phone.\n His father answered immediately. “You’ll never guess what I’m looking at,” he told Walter.\n “You’re right, I’ll never guess.”\n “Today was Summer’s ultrasound,” James reminded him. Hiding his excitement was almost impossible.\n “Ah, yes, and what did you learn?”\n James could hear the eagerness in Walter’s voice. “I have the picture in front of me.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-manning-grooms-those-manning-men-0/page-54.html","bookId":1982,"book":{"id":1982,"title":"The Manning Grooms (Those Manning Men #0)","description":"Storyline: \n The Manning Grooms (Those Manning Men #3-4) \n Jason Manning is content with his life as a bachelor, a slob and a sports fan.
