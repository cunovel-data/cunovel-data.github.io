I don’t know if I’m ready for this.”\n “You!” she said, and giggled.\n James’s fingers curled around her hand. “This isn’t a laughing matter. I’ve never been more frightened in my life. No, only once,” he amended. “The night I came home and found you gone.”\n “The babies and I are going to be just fine,” she said again. “Don’t worry, James, please. This is your night to shine. I’m just sorry Mutt and Jeff chose right now to make their debut.”\n “At the moment, the election is the last thing on my mind. None of it matters.”\n “You’re going to win the primary,” she insisted. Summer knew the competition had been steep, and Ralph Southworth had done what damage he could, eager to prove himself right.\n “We’re almost at the hospital,” James said, sounding relieved.\n “Relax,” she said, and as it turned out, her words were a reminder to herself. The next contraction hit with unexpected severity, and she drew in a deep breath trying to control the pain.\n “Summer!”\n “I’m fine,” she said breathlessly.\n James pulled into the emergency entrance at Virginia Mason Hospital and raced around the front of the car. He opened the door, unsnapped the seat belt and lovingly helped her out.\n Someone rolled a wheelchair toward her, and while Summer sat and answered the questions in Admitting, James parked the car.\n She was on the maternity floor when he rejoined her, looking pale and harried.\n “Stop worrying,” she scolded him.\n James dragged a chair to the side of her bed and slumped into it. “Feel my heart,” he said and placed her hand over his chest.\n “It feels like a machine gun,” Summer said, smiling. She moved her hand to his face and cupped his cheek.\n “I need you so much,” James whispered.\n Summer couldn’t speak due to a strong contraction. James clasped her hand and talked to her in soothing tones, urging her to relax. As the pain ebbed, she kept her eyes closed.\n When she opened them, she found James standing by the hospital bed, studying her. She smiled weakly and he smiled in return.\n Dr. Wise arrived and read her chart, then asked, “How are we doing here?”\n “Great,” Summer assured him.\n “Not so good,” James said contradicting her. “I think Summer needs something for the pain, and frankly I’m not feeling so well myself.”\n “James, I’m fine,” Summer told him yet again.\n “What your husband’s saying is that he needs help to deal with seeing you in pain,” the physician explained.\n “Do something, Doc.”\n Dr. Wise slapped James affectionately on the back. “Why don’t we let Summer be the one to decide if she needs an epidural? She’s a better judge than either one of us.”\n “All right.” But James’s agreement came reluctantly.\n For Summer the hours passed in a blur. Her labor was difficult, and she was sure she could never have endured it if not for James, who stood faithfully at her side. He encouraged her, lifted her spirits, rubbed her back, reassured her of his love.\n News of the primary filtered into the room in messages from Charlotte and various nurses, who caught snippets on the waiting room TV. In the beginning Summer strained to hear each bit of information. But as the evening wore on, she became so consumed by what was happening to her and the babies that she barely heard.\n She lost track of time, but it seemed to her that it was well into the wee hours of the morning when she was taken into the delivery room.\n James briefly left her side and returned a few minutes later, gowned in surgical green. He resembled a prison escapee, and she took one look at him and laughed.\n “What’s so funny?”\n “You.”\n James drew in a deep breath and held Summer’s hand. “It’s almost time.”\n “I know,” she breathed softly. “Ready or not, we’re about to become parents. I have the feeling this is going to be the ride of a lifetime.”\n “It’s been that way for me from the night I met you.”\n “Are you sorry, James?”\n “Sorry?” he repeated. “No way!” Leaning over, he kissed her forehead. “My only regret is that I didn’t marry you that first New Year’s.”\n “Oh, James, I do love you.”\n Dr. Wise joined them. “Well, you two, let’s see what we’ve got here, shall we?” He grinned at James. “Congratulations, Your Honor. You won the primary. This is obviously a night for good news.”\n Two months later Summer woke to the soft, mewling cry of her infant daughter. She climbed silently out of bed and made her way into their daughters’ nursery.\n There she found James sitting upright in the rocker, sound asleep with Kellie in his arms. Kerrie fussed in her crib.\n Lifting the tiny bundle, Summer changed Kerrie’s diaper, then sat in the rocker next to her husband and offered the hungry child her breast. Kerrie nursed eagerly and Summer ran her finger down the side of her baby’s perfect face.\n Her gaze wandered to her husband and she felt a surge of pride and love. The election had been that night, and he’d won the court seat by a wide margin. During the heat of the last two weeks of the campaign, James had let her compose and sing a radio commercial for him. Summer had been proud of her small part in his success, although she didn’t miss life on the stage. Her twin daughters kept her far too busy for regrets.\n James must have felt her scrutiny because he stirred. He looked up and saw Summer with Kerrie.\n “I might as well feed Kellie, too,” she said. Experience had taught her that the minute one was fed and asleep, the other would wake and demand to be nursed. Her twin daughters were identical in more than looks. Even their sleep patterns were the same.\n James stood and expertly changed Kellie’s diaper.\n When Kerrie finished nursing, Summer swapped babies with him. James gently placed his daughter on his shoulder and patted her back until they heard the tiny burp.\n “Why didn’t you wake me?” Summer asked.\n “You were sleeping so soundly.”\n “It was quite a night, Your Honor,” she said, looking over at her husband. “I couldn’t be more thrilled for you, James. Your position on the bench is secure.”\n “I couldn’t have done it without you,” he told her.\n “Don’t be ridiculous.”\n “It’s true,” he said with feeling. “You and Kerrie and Kellie. The voters fell in love with the three of you. Those radio commercials you sang were the talk of the town. I’m the envy of every politician I know.”\n “Because I can sing?”\n “No, because you’re my wife.” His eyes were dark, intense. “I’m crazy about you, Summer. I still can’t believe how much you’ve given me.”\n “I love you, too, James.” Summer closed her eyes. It had started almost two years ago in Vegas, when it felt as if her heart was breaking. Now her heart was filled to overflowing. Life couldn’t get any better than it was right then, she decided.\n But Summer was wrong.\n Because the best was yet to come. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-manning-grooms-those-manning-men-0/page-59.html","bookId":1982,"book":{"id":1982,"title":"The Manning Grooms (Those Manning Men #0)","description":"Storyline: \n The Manning Grooms (Those Manning Men #3-4) \n Jason Manning is content with his life as a bachelor, a slob and a sports fan.
