Against the odds, Jazmine had succeeded in adapting to a new school and a new home, and she’d made friends.\\n\\n A few minutes later, Jazmine set the phone aside and raced over to Shana. “Uncle Adam suggested visiting Victoria, B.C.,” she said breathlessly. “I’ve never been there and he said it’s a wonderful day trip.”\\n\\n “That does sound nice,” Shana said wistfully. She was astonished at the way Adam’s suggestion reflected her own earlier musings about Victoria. It was almost eerie.\\n\\n “He wants to talk to you,” Jazmine said. She ran to get the portable phone and handed it to Shana.\\n\\n Shana walked into the back room, nervously tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. She’d moussed it into submission that morning, but whole sections were already attempting a breakout.\\n\\n “Hello,” she said and hoped her voice didn’t betray her feelings. She thought about this man far too often and had an intense love-hate relationship with him that he knew nothing about. She was attracted to him and yet she didn’t want to be. The fact that he—\\n\\n “Shana?” Adam said, cutting into her thoughts.\\n\\n “I’m here,” she said primly.\\n\\n “That’s a great idea of Jazmine’s. You can come, can’t you?”\\n\\n “To Victoria, you mean? Ah…”\\n\\n “We’ll make it a day trip. I’m off until Thursday. I’ll pick you and Jazmine up, then we’ll take the Fauntleroy ferry over to the Kitsap Peninsula, drive to Port Angeles and take another ferry across the Strait to Victoria.”\\n\\n “I…I’m—” Shana hesitated when she saw Jazmine staring at her with pleading eyes. She’d folded her hands as if in prayer, and Shana’s resolve weakened. “I’ll need to check with Catherine before I take a whole day.” Shana instantly felt guilty; she’d invested her life savings in this business and she shouldn’t be running off for a day of fun. She should be at work.\\n\\n “Ask her,” Adam urged.\\n\\n Shana turned away from the phone and came face-to-face with Catherine, who had her hands on her hips. “Go. I’ll manage just fine. It’s only one day, for Pete’s sake.”\\n\\n “But…”\\n\\n “Aunt Shana,” Jazmine said pulling on her arm. “Just do it. We’ll have a blast.”\\n\\n Shana wasn’t nearly as sure. That night, long after Jazmine was in bed and she herself should have been, she e-mailed her sister.\\n\\n Sent: June 24\\n\\n From:\\n\\n [email protected]\\n\\n To:\\n\\n [email protected]\\n\\n Subject: Jazmine, Adam Kennedy and me\\n\\n Dear Alison,\\n\\n As you probably already know, I’m going off on a day trip to Victoria, British Columbia, with Jazz and Adam. Basically I got talked into it, and I’ll give you three guesses whose fault that is. Your daughter could talk circles around Larry King. Mark my words, that kid will have her own talk show one day.\\n\\n Yes, Adam Kennedy will be there, too. I don’t mind having him around anymore. I put up a good fight, let him know I wasn’t interested in a relationship and even made a point of telling him about Jazz playing matchmaker. He listened politely and agreed with everything I had to say. The least he could’ve done was argue—just kidding! Without even trying, he’s worn down my defenses. I have to admit I’ve enjoyed the time I’ve spent with him. Twice now, after he’s visited Jazz, he’s stayed for a cup of coffee and we’ve talked. There hasn’t been a hint of romance, although, yes—I’m attracted. I definitely feel we have some chemistry, but I’m too preoccupied (and too scared!) to do anything about it.\\n\\n Okay, I’ve bared my soul. It’s your turn. What’s up with you and this Commander Dillon? I know you, Ali. You wouldn’t have mentioned him at all if you didn’t care, so I repeat—what’s up?\\n\\n It’s almost eleven and I should be in bed. Adam’s arriving very early. I offered to drive over to his place, but he said it was no trouble coming to get us.\\n\\n Write soon. Jazmine and I both look forward to your e-mails.\\n\\n Love,\\n\\n Shana\\n\\n Less than twelve hours later, Shana was on a midmorning ferry that had left Port Angeles for Vancouver Island. An excited Jazmine jogged up and down the outside deck while Adam and Shana drank cups of coffee inside. They were seated on wooden benches, across from each other.\\n\\n “I can’t believe I’m doing this,” she muttered. The alarm had rung at four that morning and they were on the road by five.\\n\\n “Did you see the Olympic Mountains?” Jazmine dashed inside shouting—as if they could possibly have missed them. “I learned in class that some of those mountains have never been climbed or explored.”\\n\\n This was news to Shana, but she wasn’t much of an expert on Washington State history or geography.\\n\\n “Do either of you know about Point Roberts?” Adam asked when Jazmine threw herself down on the bench, sitting next to Adam and across from Shana.\\n\\n Both Shana and Jazmine shook their heads. “Never heard of it,” Shana said.\\n\\n “It’s a little piece of the United States that is geographically part of Canada.”\\n\\n “What?” Jazmine frowned. “I don’t get it.”\\n\\n “The United States and Canada are separated by the 49th parallel at Washington and British Columbia. There’s a small point of land that drops below it. That’s Point Roberts. Maybe we can go there sometime.”\\n\\n “So it’s in Canada but not really?”\\n\\n “Take a look at a map and you’ll see what I mean.”\\n\\n While Jazmine walked over to examine the wall at the other end of the ferry, where a map of Washington was posted, Shana sipped her coffee and smiled at Adam. “She idolizes you, you know.”\\n\\n Adam shifted on the hard bench and crossed his arms. “As it happens, I think the world of her, too.”\\n\\n It was confession time for Shana, although what she had to say was probably no secret to Adam. “I was jealous of that in the beginning.”\\n\\n Adam’s gaze held hers. “And now?”\\n\\n “Now…” She hesitated. “I appreciate the fact that she has you. She needs a strong male figure in her life, especially with her dad gone.”\\n\\n “She’s come to love you, too, Shana. And it’s all happened in remarkably little time. That says a lot for you, I think. You’ve been patient with her and you’ve managed to find just the right approach.”\\n\\n His praise brought a sheen of tears to her eyes. Embarrassed and wanting to hide the effect of his words, Shana quickly blinked them away.\\n\\n “Listen,” Adam said, lowering his voice. “There’s something I should probably tell you. There’s a rumor floating around that several of us could be transferred to Hawaii. I’ve wanted to go back for quite a while—ever since I left, really. I just wish the timing was better. I should also tell you it could be soon.”\\n\\n “No,” Shana cried, unable to hold back the automatic protest.\\n\\n Everyone in the immediate vicinity seemed to stop and look in their direction.\\n\\n Adam leaned forward and reached for her hand. “Dare I hope that response is for you as well as Jazmine?”\\n\\n Shana ignored the question. “I guess I should congratulate you, then—since this is an assignment you want.”\\n\\n “What about you, Shana?” he pressed. “Will you miss me?”\\n\\n He wasn’t going to drop this as easily as she’d hoped. “Of…course.” The lump in her throat was growing as she dealt with the coming disappointment—her own and Jazmine’s. This would devastate her niece.\\n\\n “I’ll miss you and Jazmine, too.” Adam’s eyes held hers, and he brushed his thumb over her hand. “I’ve enjoyed our visits. Especially those talks over coffee.”\\n\\n As the old expression had it, hope sprang eternal. “It’s not a for-sure decision, right? I mean, there’s a possibility you won’t be going.”\\n\\n “I wouldn’t count on it.”\\n\\n “Oh, well,” she said, doing her best to seem nonchalant about this unexpected turn of events. He’d probably known for some time and was only now free to mention it. “I guess that answers that.” She tried to speak lightly, concealing her sense of loss.\\n\\n He grinned sheepishly. “I have to admit that Jazmine’s matchmaking plans didn’t upset me nearly as much as they did you.”\\n\\n Her responding smile felt a little shaky, which was exactly how she felt herself. During the last few weeks, she’d come to like and trust Adam, and just when she was feeling comfortable with him, he made this announcement.\\n\\n Adam switched seats so that he was sitting next to her. “I probably shouldn’t have said anything about Hawaii yet, but I wanted you to know as soon as possible, so we can prepare Jazmine.”\\n\\n “No—you did the right thing.” Until she’d learned that he might leave, Shana hadn’t realized how much she’d come to rely on Adam. She and Jazmine would be on their own for the next four and a half months, and just then that felt like an eternity.\\n\\n “Hey, guys,” Jazmine said, running toward them. She flopped down on the wooden seat. “I found Point Roberts on the map! It’s really cool, isn’t it?”\\n\\n “Really cool,” Adam agreed solemnly.\\n\\n Shana didn’t know how a whole day could pass so quickly. Victoria was everything she’d heard and read. Although she’d never been to England, she imagined it must be like this. They explored the harbor, rode a horse-drawn carriage through the downtown area, had high tea at the Empress Hotel and toured some quaint little shops. In one of them, Shana couldn’t resist buying a made-in-England teapot covered in delicate little roses, while Adam got each of them a sweatshirt with maple leaves dancing across the front.\\n\\n “I loved the carriage ride best,” Jazmine told them on the ferry ride back to Port Angeles. “I wish we had time to visit Butchart Gardens.” She waved a brochure she’d picked up. “The pictures of the flowers are so beautiful. I always wanted a garden….” She leaned her head against Shana and closed her eyes. Within moments she was asleep.\\n\\n Shana carefully eased the girl off her shoulder and gently laid Jazmine’s head down on the seat. Lifting the girl’s legs, she set them on the bench, then covered Jazmine with her jacket. Her niece looked angelic, and Shana’s heart swelled with love for this child. She felt protective and proud. Jazmine had taught her so many lessons about love.\\n\\n Adam slid over so Shana could sit with him across from Jazmine. The day had been wonderful but, like Jazmine, she was tired. When Adam placed his arm around her, she gave in to the urge to rest her head against his shoulder. It was an invitation to intimacy, she realized, and she relaxed, comfortable and suddenly happy. “Thank you for such a special day,” she whispered as he twined their fingers together.\\n\\n His hold on her tightened momentarily.\\n\\n Shana turned her head to look up at him—and that was when it happened. She read the intention in his eyes and knew he wanted to kiss her. At first, she wondered if what she saw was a reflection of her own desire, but instinct told her he felt the same thing. For the briefest of moments, she had a choice—she could either pull away or let him kiss her. Without rational thought, she closed her eyes, lifted her mouth to his and accepted his kiss. As soon as their lips met, Shana knew she’d made the right decision. She felt his kiss all the way to her toes. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-husband-navy-6/page-16.html","bookId":1961,"book":{"id":1961,"title":"Navy Husband (Navy #6)","description":"Storyline: Navy Husband (Navy #6) \\n Hi Ali, \\n Just a quick note from your ever-loving sister.
