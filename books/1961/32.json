Shana squealed with joy and hugged Alison excitedly, then hugged her brother-in-law to be. “How did you know?” Alison asked. “We didn’t,” Adam answered. “We came because we have some exciting news of our own.” “We’re pregnant,” Shana burst out. Now it was Alison’s turn to shout with happiness. “Can I babysit?” Jazmine asked. “I could spend the summers with you in Hawaii and—” “We’ll decide that later,” Alison said, cutting her daughter off. “We were about to sit down for dinner. Join us,” she insisted. The two women immediately went into the kitchen. While Alison got out extra silverware, Shana took the dinner and salad plates from the cupboard, along with two extra water glasses. Jazmine promptly delivered them to the table. Shana paused. “Less than a year ago who would’ve believed we’d both have Navy husbands?” “Navy husbands,” Alison repeated as her diamond flashed in the light. “It has a nice sound to it, doesn’t it?” “The nicest sound in the world,” Shana agreed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-husband-navy-6/page-32.html","bookId":1961,"book":{"id":1961,"title":"Navy Husband (Navy #6)","description":"Storyline: Navy Husband (Navy #6) Hi Ali, Just a quick note from your ever-loving sister. Wanted to bring you up to date on how things are going with Jazmine. After all, I am — according to the Navy — your official \"parenting plan.\" I adore Jazmine. But who knew that a nine-year-old had so many opinions? Including an opinion on my love life (or lack thereof). I\u0027m pretty sure she\u0027s trying to set me up with that friend of yours, Adam Kennedy. Excuse me Lieutenant Commander Adam Kennedy. Yeah, yeah, I know. He\u0027s great looking and very helpful(if a little dictatorial), but I am not in the market for a Navy husband. Do me a favor — tell your daughter that, okay? Love you. Miss you.
