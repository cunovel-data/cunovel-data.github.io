Wanted to bring you up to date on how things are going with Jazmine. After all, I am — according to the Navy — your official \"parenting plan.\" \\n I adore Jazmine. But who knew that a nine-year-old had so many opinions? Including an opinion on my love life (or lack thereof). I\u0027m pretty sure she\u0027s trying to set me up with that friend of yours, Adam Kennedy. Excuse me Lieutenant Commander Adam Kennedy. \\n Yeah, yeah, I know. He\u0027s great looking and very helpful(if a little dictatorial), but I am not in the market for a Navy husband. \\n Do me a favor — tell your daughter that, okay? \\n Love you. Miss you. \\n Shana\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/navy-husband-navy-6.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
