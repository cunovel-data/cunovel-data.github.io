{"id":1787,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"Aunt Alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece. Mr. Tate rose, but shedeclined assistance. For once in his life, Atticus’s instinctive courtesy failed him: he satwhere he was.\\n\\n 　　Somehow, I could think of nothing but Mr. Bob Ewell saying he’d get Atticus if it tookhim the rest of his life. Mr. Ewell almost got him, and it was the last thing he did.\\n\\n 　　“Are you sure?” Atticus said bleakly.\\n\\n 　　“He’s dead all right,” said Mr. Tate. “He’s good and dead. He won’t hurt these childrenagain.”\\n\\n 　　“I didn’t mean that.” Atticus seemed to be talking in his sleep. His age was beginningto show, his one sign of inner turmoil, the strong line of his jaw melted a little, onebecame aware of telltale creases forming under his ears, one noticed not his jet-blackhair but the gray patches growing at his temples.\\n\\n 　　“Hadn’t we better go to the livingroom?” Aunt Alexandra said at last.\\n\\n 　　“If you don’t mind,” said Mr. Tate, “I’d rather us stay in here if it won’t hurt Jem any. Iwant to have a look at his injuries while Scout… tells us about it.”\\n\\n 　　“Is it all right if I leave?” she asked. “I’m just one person too many in here. I’ll be in myroom if you want me, Atticus.” Aunt Alexandra went to the door, but she stopped andturned. “Atticus, I had a feeling about this tonight—I—this is my fault,” she began. “Ishould have—”\\n\\n 　　Mr. Tate held up his hand. “You go ahead, Miss Alexandra, I know it’s been a shock toyou. And don’t you fret yourself about anything—why, if we followed our feelings all thetime we’d be like cats chasin‘ their tails. Miss Scout, see if you can tell us whathappened, while it’s still fresh in your mind. You think you can? Did you see himfollowing you?”\\n\\n 　　I went to Atticus and felt his arms go around me. I buried my head in his lap. “Westarted home. I said Jem, I’ve forgot m’shoes. Soon’s we started back for ‘em the lightswent out. Jem said I could get ’em tomorrow…”\\n\\n 　　“Scout, raise up so Mr. Tate can hear you,” Atticus said. I crawled into his lap.\\n\\n 　　“Then Jem said hush a minute. I thought he was thinkin‘—he always wants you tohush so he can think—then he said he heard somethin’. We thought it was Cecil.”\\n\\n 　　“Cecil?”\\n\\n 　　“Cecil Jacobs. He scared us once tonight, an‘ we thought it was him again. He had ona sheet. They gave a quarter for the best costume, I don’t know who won it—”\\n\\n 　　“Where were you when you thought it was Cecil?”\\n\\n 　　“Just a little piece from the schoolhouse. I yelled somethin‘ at him—”\\n\\n 　　“You yelled, what?”\\n\\n 　　“Cecil Jacobs is a big fat hen, I think. We didn’t hear nothin‘—then Jem yelled hello orsomethin’ loud enough to wake the dead—”\\n\\n 　　“Just a minute, Scout,” said Mr. Tate. “Mr. Finch, did you hear them?”\\n\\n 　　Atticus said he didn’t. He had the radio on. Aunt Alexandra had hers going in herbedroom. He remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she couldhear hers. Atticus smiled. “I always play a radio too loud.”\\n\\n 　　“I wonder if the neighbors heard anything…” said Mr. Tate.\\n\\n 　　“I doubt it, Heck. Most of them listen to their radios or go to bed with the chickens.\\n\\n 　　Maudie Atkinson may have been up, but I doubt it.”\\n\\n 　　“Go ahead, Scout,” Mr. Tate said.\\n\\n 　　“Well, after Jem yelled we walked on. Mr. Tate, I was shut up in my costume but Icould hear it myself, then. Footsteps, I mean. They walked when we walked andstopped when we stopped. Jem said he could see me because Mrs. Crenshaw putsome kind of shiny paint on my costume. I was a ham.”\\n\\n 　　“How’s that?” asked Mr. Tate, startled.\\n\\n 　　Atticus described my role to Mr. Tate, plus the construction of my garment. “Youshould have seen her when she came in,” he said, “it was crushed to a pulp.”\\n\\n 　　Mr. Tate rubbed his chin. “I wondered why he had those marks on him, His sleeveswere perforated with little holes. There were one or two little puncture marks on his armsto match the holes. Let me see that thing if you will, sir.”\\n\\n 　　Atticus fetched the remains of my costume. Mr. Tate turned it over and bent it aroundto get an idea of its former shape. “This thing probably saved her life,” he said. “Look.”\\n\\n 　　He pointed with a long forefinger. A shiny clean line stood out on the dull wire. “BobEwell meant business,” Mr. Tate muttered.\\n\\n 　　“He was out of his mind,” said Atticus.\\n\\n 　　“Don’t like to contradict you, Mr. Finch—wasn’t crazy, mean as hell. Low-down skunkwith enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill children. He’d never havemet you face to face.”\\n\\n 　　Atticus shook his head. “I can’t conceive of a man who’d—”\\n\\n 　　“Mr. Finch, there’s just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to‘em. Even then, they ain’t worth the bullet it takes to shoot ’em. Ewell ‘as one of ’em.”\\n\\n 　　Atticus said, “I thought he got it all out of him the day he threatened me. Even if hehadn’t, I thought he’d come after me.”\\n\\n 　　“He had guts enough to pester a poor colored woman, he had guts enough to pesterJudge Taylor when he thought the house was empty, so do you think he’da met you toyour face in daylight?” Mr. Tate sighed. “We’d better get on. Scout, you heard himbehind you—”\\n\\n 　　“Yes sir. When we got under the tree—”\\n\\n 　　“How’d you know you were under the tree, you couldn’t see thunder out there.”\\n\\n 　　“I was barefooted, and Jem says the ground’s always cooler under a tree.”\\n\\n 　　“We’ll have to make him a deputy, go ahead.”\\n\\n 　　“Then all of a sudden somethin‘ grabbed me an’ mashed my costume… think I duckedon the ground… heard a tusslin‘ under the tree sort of… they were bammin’ against thetrunk, sounded like. Jem found me and started pullin‘ me toward the road. Some—Mr.\\n\\n 　　Ewell yanked him down, I reckon. They tussled some more and then there was thisfunny noise—Jem hollered…” I stopped. That was Jem’s arm.\\n\\n 　　“Anyway, Jem hollered and I didn’t hear him any more an‘ the next thing—Mr. Ewellwas tryin’ to squeeze me to death, I reckon… then somebody yanked Mr. Ewell down.\\n\\n 　　Jem must have got up, I guess. That’s all I know…”\\n\\n 　　“And then?” Mr. Tate was looking at me sharply.\\n\\n 　　“Somebody was staggerin‘ around and pantin’ and—coughing fit to die. I thought itwas Jem at first, but it didn’t sound like him, so I went lookin‘ for Jem on the ground. Ithought Atticus had come to help us and had got wore out—”\\n\\n 　　“Who was it?”\\n\\n 　　“Why there he is, Mr. Tate, he can tell you his name.”\\n\\n 　　As I said it, I half pointed to the man in the corner, but brought my arm down quicklylest Atticus reprimand me for pointing. It was impolite to point.\\n\\n 　　He was still leaning against the wall. He had been leaning against the wall when Icame into the room, his arms folded across his chest. As I pointed he brought his armsdown and pressed the palms of his hands against the wall. They were white hands,sickly white hands that had never seen the sun, so white they stood out garishly againstthe dull cream wall in the dim light of Jem’s room.\\n\\n 　　I looked from his hands to his sand-stained khaki pants; my eyes traveled up his thinframe to his torn denim shirt. His face was as white as his hands, but for a shadow onhis jutting chin. His cheeks were thin to hollowness; his mouth was wide; there wereshallow, almost delicate indentations at his temples, and his gray eyes were so colorlessI thought he was blind. His hair was dead and thin, almost feathery on top of his head.\\n\\n 　　When I pointed to him his palms slipped slightly, leaving greasy sweat streaks on thewall, and he hooked his thumbs in his belt. A strange small spasm shook him, as if heheard fingernails scrape slate, but as I gazed at him in wonder the tension slowlydrained from his face. His lips parted into a timid smile, and our neighbor’s imageblurred with my sudden tears.\\n\\n 　　“Hey, Boo,” I said.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/759/3877.html","bookId":57,"book":{"id":57,"title":"杀死一只知更鸟 To Kill a Mockingbird","description":"简介： 知更鸟（Mockingbird）在字面上与情节没什么联系，但在小说中具有强大象征性。它代表了天真无辜者。而杀死一只知更鸟的故事就是一个罪恶毁灭天真无辜者的故事。小说中的杰姆（Jem）、汤姆鲁滨逊（Tom Robinson）、迪尔（Dill）、布（Boo）、雷蒙德先生（Mr. Raymoud）、...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/130217/1-13021FZ446438.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/759","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
