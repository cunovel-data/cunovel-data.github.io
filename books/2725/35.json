{"id":79285,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"Before I bit into my peach, I closed my eyes and inhaled the fragrance. “Your loss.” I had never had a peach like that before. So perfectly ripe. Your fingers sank into the fruit a little just touching it. I gobbled it up, peach juice running down my chin, pulp dripping all over my hands. It was sweet and tart. A full-body experience, smell and taste and sight. “This is a perfect peach,” I said. “I almost don’t want to have another one, because there’s no way it can be as good.” “Let’s test it out,” Conrad said, and he went and bought me another peach. I ate that one in four bites. “Was it as good?” he asked me. “Yeah. It was.” Conrad reached out and wiped my chin with his shirt. It was maybe the most intimate thing anyone had ever done to me. I felt light-headed, unsteady on my feet. It was all in the way he looked at me, just those few seconds. Then he dropped his eyes, like the sun was too bright behind me. I sidestepped away from him and said, “I’m gonna buy some more, for Jere.” “Good idea,” he said, backing away. “I’ll go wait for you in the car.” I was shaking as I piled peaches into a plastic bag. Just one look, one touch from him, and I was shaking. It was madness. I was marrying his brother. Back in the car, I didn’t speak. I couldn’t have even if I wanted to. I didn’t have the words. In the quiet of the air-conditioned car, the silence between us felt blaringly loud. So I rolled down my window and fixed my eyes on all the moving objects on my side. At home, Jeremiah’s car was parked in the driveway. Conrad disappeared as soon as we got into the house. I found Jere napping on the couch, his sunglasses still on his head. I kissed him awake. His eyes fluttered open. “Hey.” “Hey. Want a peach?” I asked, swinging my plastic bag like a pendulum. I felt jittery all of a sudden. Jere hugged me and said, “You’re a peach.” “Did you know Conrad’s allergic to peaches?” “Of course. Remember that time he had peach ice cream and his mouth swelled up?” I broke away and went to wash the peaches. I told myself, there’s nothing to feel guilty about, nothing happened. You didn’t do anything. I was rinsing peaches in the red plastic colander, shaking excess water off the way I’d seen Susannah do so many times. While the water was running over the peaches, Jeremiah came up behind me and grabbed one, saying, “I think they’re clean now.” He lifted himself onto the kitchen counter and bit into the peach. “Good, right?” I asked him. I held one up to my face and inhaled deeply, trying to clear my mind of all the crazy thoughts. Jeremiah nodded. He’d already finished it and was lobbing the pit into the sink. “Really good. Did you get any strawberries? I could eat a whole box of strawberries right now.” “No, just the peaches.” I put the peaches in the silver fruit bowl, arranging them as nicely as I could. My hands were still shaking. Chapter Thirty-nine The apartment had wall-to-wall navy blue carpeting, and even though I had flip-flops on, I could just tell that it was moist. The kitchen was the size of an airplane bathroom, practically, and the bedroom had no windows. The place had high ceilings—that was the only nice thing about it, in my opinion. Jeremiah and I had spent the whole day looking at apartments near our school. So far we’d seen three. This place was the worst by far. “I like the carpet,” Jeremiah said appreciatively. “It’s nice to wake up in the morning and put your feet down on carpet.” I glanced toward the open door, where the landlord was waiting for us. He looked around my dad’s age. He had a long white ponytail, a mustache, and a tattoo of a topless mermaid on his forearm. He caught me looking at the tattoo and grinned at me. I gave him a weak smile in return. Then I walked back into the bedroom and motioned for Jeremiah to follow me. “It smells like cigarette smoke in here,” I whispered. “It’s, like, absorbed in the carpet.” “Febreeze it, baby.” “You Febreeze it. By yourself. I’m not living here.” “What’s the problem? This place is practically on campus, it’s so close. And there’s outdoor space—we can grill. Think of all the parties we’ll have. Come on, Belly.” “Come on nothing. Let’s go back to the first place we looked at. That place had central air-conditioning.” Above us, I could feel rather than hear the bass from someone’s stereo pumping. Jeremiah jammed his hands into his pockets. “That place was all old people and families. This place is for people our age. College kids like us.” I looked back at the landlord. He was looking at his cell phone, pretending not to listen to our conversation. Lowering my voice, I said, “This place is basically a frat house. If I wanted to live in a frat house, I would bunk with you back at fraternity row.” He rolled his eyes. Loudly, he said, “I guess we’re not taking the apartment.” To the landlord, he shrugged, like whaddyagonnado. Like they were in on it together, just a couple of guys, partners. “Thank you for showing us the apartment,” I said. “No problemo,” the guy said, lighting a cigarette. As we stepped out of the apartment, I shot Jeremiah a dirty look. He mouthed, What, in a bewildered way. I just shook my head. “It’s getting late,” Jeremiah said in the car. “Let’s just pick a place. I want to get this over with already.” “Okay, fine,” I said, turning up the AC. “Then I pick the first place.” “Fine,” he said. “Fine,” I said back. We went back to the first apartment complex to fill out paperwork. We went straight to the management office. The building manager’s name was Carolyn. She was tall and red haired and she wore a printed wrap dress. Her perfume smelled like Susannah’s. I took this as a definite good omen. “So your parents aren’t renting the apartment for you?” Carolyn asked. “Most students have their parents sign the lease.” I opened my mouth to speak, but Jeremiah beat me to it. “No, we’re doing this on our own,” he said. “We’re engaged.” Surprise registered on her face, and I saw her glance ever so briefly at my stomach. “Oh!” she said. “Well, congratulations.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-35.html","bookId":2725,"book":{"id":2725,"title":"We\u0027ll Always Have Summer (Summer #3)","description":"Storyline: It\u0027s been two years since Conrad told Belly to go with Jeremiah.
