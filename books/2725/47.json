I have five words for you. Are you ready?” I opened my eyes and nodded. Very solemnly he said, “Go big or go home.” “What the hell does that even mean, Steven?” Taylor snapped. A laugh escaped from deep down in my chest. “Go big or go home? Go big or go home.” I was laughing so hard, tears were running down my cheeks. Taylor jumped up. “Your makeup!” She grabbed the box of tissues on the dresser and wiped my face delicately. I was still laughing. “Snap out of it, Conklin,” Taylor said, shooting a worried look at my brother. The flower in her hair was askew. She was right: the humidity wasn’t doing her hair any favors. Steven said, “Aw, she’s fine. She’s just having a laugh. Right, Belly?” “Go big or go home,” I repeated, giggling. “I think she’s hysterical or something. Should I slap her?” Taylor asked my brother. “No, I’ll do it,” he said, advancing toward me. I stopped laughing. I wasn’t hysterical. Or maybe I was, a little bit. “I’m fine, you guys! Nobody gets to slap me. Geez.” I stood up. “What time is it?” Steven pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. “It’s two o’clock. We still have a couple of hours before people get here.” Taking a deep breath, I said, “Okay. Steven, will you go tell Mom I think we should move the wedding inside? If we push the couches to the side, we can probably fit a couple of the tables in the living room.” “I’ll get the other guys on it,” he said. “Thanks, Stevie. And Taylor, will you—” Hopefully, she asked, “Stay and fix your makeup?” “No. I was going to ask if you could get out too. I need to think.” Exchanging looks, the two of them shuffled out of my room, and I shut the door behind them. As soon as I saw him, everything would make sense again. It had to. Chapter Fifty-five Conrad I woke up that morning to Steven shaking my bed. “Have you seen Jere?” he demanded. “I was asleep,” I muttered, my eyes still closed. “How could I have seen him?” Steven stopped shaking the bed and sat down on the edge. “He’s gone, man. I can’t find him anywhere, and he left his phone. What the hell happened last night?” I sat up. Belly must have told him. Shit. “I don’t know,” I said, rubbing my eyes. “What are we gonna do?” This was all my fault. I got out of bed and said, “Go ahead and get dressed. I’ll look for him. Don’t tell Belly anything.” Looking relieved, he said, “Sounds good. But shouldn’t Belly know? We don’t have a ton of time before the wedding. I don’t want her to get ready and everything if he’s not coming.” “If I’m not back in an hour, you can tell her then.” I threw off my T-shirt and put on the white linen shirt Jere had made us all buy. “Where are you gonna go?” Steven asked me. “Maybe I should go with you.” “No, you stay here and take care of her. I’ll find him.” “So you know where he is, then?” “Yeah, I think so,” I said. I didn’t have a clue where that bastard was. I just knew I had to fix this. On my way out, Laurel stopped me and said, “Have you seen Jere? I need to give him something.” “He went out to get something for the wedding,” I said. “I’m going to meet him now. I’ll give it to him.” She handed me an envelope. I recognized the paper right away. It was my mom’s stationery. Jere’s name was written on the front in her handwriting. Smiling, Laurel said, “You know, I think it might be nicer this way, coming from you. Beck would like that, don’t you think?” There was no way I was coming back without Jere. As soon as I was outside, I sprinted to my car and just gunned it out of there. I went to the boardwalk first, then the skate park we used to hang out at as kids, then the gym, then a diner we’d stop at on the way into town. He’d always 268 · jenny han liked their strawberry milkshakes. But he wasn’t there. I drove around the mall parking lot. No car and no Jere. I couldn’t find him anywhere, and my hour was almost up. I was screwed. Steven was going to tell Belly, and then this would be just one more, epic time I messed up her life. What if Jere had left Cousins completely? He could be back in Boston for all I knew. It would have been great if I had some sudden epiph-any, some insight into where he was, seeing as how we were brothers. But all I could do was run down the list, every place we ever went. Where would Jeremiah go if he was upset? He’d go to my mom. But her grave wasn’t here, it was in Boston. In Cousins she was everywhere. Then it came to me—the garden. Maybe Jere had gone to the garden at the shelter. It was worth a shot. I called Steven on the way over. “I think I know where he is. Don’t tell Belly anything yet.” “All right. But if I don’t hear from you in half an hour, I’m telling her. Either way, I’m kicking his ass for this.” We hung up as I pulled into the women’s shelter parking lot. I saw his car right away. I felt a mixture of profound relief and dread. What right did I have to say anything to him? I was the one who was responsible for this mess. Jere was sitting on a bench by the garden, his head in his hands. He was still in last night’s clothes. His head snapped up when he heard me coming. “I’m warning you, man. Don’t come near me right now.” I kept walking. When I was standing right in front of him, I said, “Come back to the house with me.” He glowered at me. “Fuck you.” “You’re supposed to be getting married in a couple of hours. We don’t have time to do this right now. Just hit me. It’ll make you feel better.” I tried to pick up his arm, and he shoved me off. “No, it’ll make you feel better. You don’t deserve to feel better. But after the shady shit you pulled, I should beat the crap out of you.” “Then do it,” I said. “And then let’s go. Belly’s waiting for you. Don’t make her wait on her wedding day.” “Shut up!” he yelled, lunging at me. “You don’t get to talk to me about her.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-47.html","bookId":2725,"book":{"id":2725,"title":"We\u0027ll Always Have Summer (Summer #3)","description":"Storyline: It\u0027s been two years since Conrad told Belly to go with Jeremiah.
