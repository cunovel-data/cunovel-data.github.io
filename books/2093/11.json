{"id":90290,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Ama climbed the path to the cave, bread and milk in the bag on her back, a heavy puzzlement in her heart. How in the world could she ever manage to reach the sleeping girl?\\n\\n She came to the rock where the woman had told her to leave the food. She put it down, but she didn\u0027t go straight home; she climbed a little farther, up past the cave and through the thick rhododendrons, and farther up still to where the trees thinned out and the rainbows began.\\n\\n There she and her daemon played a game: they climbed up over the rock shelves and around the little green-white cataracts, past the whirlpools and through the spectrum tinted spray, until her hair and her eyelids and his squirrel fur were beaded all over with a million tiny pearls of moisture. The game was to get to the top without wiping your eyes, despite the temptation, and soon the sunlight sparkled and fractured into red, yellow, green, blue, and all the colors in between, but she mustn\u0027t brush her hand across to see better until she got right to the top, or the game would be lost.\\n\\n Kulang, her daemon, sprang to a rock near the top of the little waterfall, and she knew he\u0027d turn at once to make sure she didn\u0027t brush the moisture off her eyelashes - except that he didn\u0027t.\\n\\n Instead, he clung there, gazing forward.\\n\\n Ama wiped her eyes, because the game was canceled by the surprise her daemon was feeling. As she pulled herself up to look over the edge, she gasped and fell still, because looking down at her was the face of a creature she had never seen before: a bear, but immense, terrifying, four times the size of the brown bears in the forest, and ivory white, with a black nose and black eyes and claws the length of daggers. He was only an arm\u0027s length away. She could see every separate hair on his head.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s that?\" said the voice of a boy, and while Ama couldn\u0027t understand the words, she caught the sense easily enough.\\n\\n After a moment the boy appeared next to the bear: fierce-looking, with frowning eyes and a jutting jaw. And was that a daemon beside him, bird-shaped? But such a strange bird: unlike any she\u0027d seen before. It flew to Kulang and spoke briefly: Friends. We shan\u0027t hurt you.\\n\\n The great white bear hadn\u0027t moved at all.\\n\\n \"Come up,\" said the boy, and again her daemon made sense of it for her.\\n\\n Watching the bear with superstitious awe, Ama scrambled up beside the little waterfall and stood shyly on the rocks. Kulang became a butterfly and settled for a moment on her cheek, but left it to flutter around the other daemon, who sat still on the boy\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"Will,\" said the boy, pointing to himself.\\n\\n She responded, \"Ama.\" Now that she could see him properly, she was frightened of the boy almost more than the bear: he had a horrible wound: two of his fingers were missing. She felt dizzy when she saw it.\\n\\n The bear turned away along the milky stream and lay down in the water, as if to cool himself. The boy\u0027s daemon took to the air and fluttered with Kulang among the rainbows, and slowly they began to understand each other.\\n\\n And what should they turn out to be looking for but a cave, with a girl asleep?\\n\\n The words tumbled out of her in response: \"I know where it is! And she\u0027s being kept asleep by a woman who says she is her mother, but no mother would be so cruel, would she? She makes her drink something to keep her asleep, but I have some herbs to make her wake up, if only I could get to her!\"\\n\\n Will could only shake his head and wait for Balthamos to translate. It took more than a minute.\\n\\n \"Iorek,\" he called, and the bear lumbered along the bed of the stream, licking his chops, for he had just swallowed a fish, \"Iorek,\" Will said, \"this girl is saying she knows where Lyra is. I\u0027ll go with her to look, while you stay here and watch.\"\\n\\n Iorek Byrnison, foursquare in the stream, nodded silently. Will hid his rucksack and buckled on the knife before clambering down through the rainbows with Ama. The mist that filled the air was icy. He had to brush his eyes and peer through the dazzle to see where it was safe to put his feet.\\n\\n When they reached the foot of the falls, Ama indicated that they should go carefully and make no noise, and Will walked behind her down the slope, between mossy rocks and great gnarled pine trunks where the dappled light danced intensely green and a billion tiny insects scraped and sang. Down they went, and farther down, and still the sunlight followed them, deep into the valley, while overhead the branches tossed unceasingly in the bright sky.\\n\\n Then Ama halted. Will drew himself behind the massive bole of a cedar, and looked where she was pointing. Through a tangle of leaves and branches, he saw the side of a cliff, rising up to the right, and partway up -\\n\\n \"Mrs. Coulter,\" he whispered, and his heart was beating fast.\\n\\n The woman appeared from behind the rock and shook out a thick-leaved branch before dropping it and brushing her hands together. Had she been sweeping the floor? Her sleeves were rolled, and her hair was bound up with a scarf. Will could never have imagined her looking so domestic.\\n\\n But then there was a flash of gold, and that vicious monkey appeared, leaping up to her shoulder. As if they suspected something, they looked all around, and suddenly Mrs. Coulter didn\u0027t look domestic at all.\\n\\n Ama was whispering urgently: she was afraid of the golden monkey daemon; he liked to tear the wings off bats while they were still alive.\\n\\n \"Is there anyone else with her?\" Will said. \"No soldiers, or anyone like that?\"\\n\\n Ama didn\u0027t know. She had never seen soldiers, but people did talk about strange and frightening men, or they might be ghosts, seen on the mountainsides at night... But there had always been ghosts in the mountains, everyone knew that. So they might not have anything to do with the woman.\\n\\n Well, thought Will, if Lyra\u0027s in the cave and Mrs. Coulter doesn\u0027t leave it, I\u0027ll have to go and pay a call.\\n\\n He said, \"What is this drug you have? What do you have to do with it to wake her up?\"\\n\\n Ama explained.\\n\\n \"And where is it now?\"\\n\\n In her home, she said. Hidden away.\\n\\n \"All right. Wait here and don\u0027t come near. When you see her, you mustn\u0027t say that you know me. You\u0027ve never seen me, or the bear. When do you next bring her food?\"\\n\\n Half an hour before sunset, Ama\u0027s daemon said.\\n\\n \"Bring the medicine with you then,\" said Will. \"I\u0027ll meet you here.\"\\n\\n She watched with great unease as he set off along the path. Surely he didn\u0027t believe what she had just told him about the monkey daemon, or he wouldn\u0027t walk so recklessly up to the cave.\\n\\n Actually, Will felt very nervous. All his senses seemed to be clarified, so that he was aware of the tiniest insects drifting in the sun shafts and the rustle of every leaf and the movement of the clouds above, even though his eyes never left the cave mouth.\\n\\n \"Balthamos,\" he whispered, and the angel daemon flew to his shoulder as a bright-eyed small bird with red wings. \"Keep close to me, and watch that monkey.\"\\n\\n \"Then look to your right,\" said Balthamos tersely.\\n\\n And Will saw a patch of golden light at the cave mouth that had a face and eyes and was watching them. They were no more than twenty paces away. He stood still, and the golden monkey turned his head to look in the cave, said something, and turned back.\\n\\n Will felt for the knife handle and walked on.\\n\\n When he reached the cave, the woman was waiting for him.\\n\\n She was sitting at her ease in the little canvas chair, with a book on her lap, watching him calmly. She was wearing traveler\u0027s clothes of khaki, but so well were they cut and so graceful was her figure that they looked like the highest of high fashion, and the little spray of red blossom she\u0027d pinned to her shirtfront looked like the most elegant of jewels. Her hair shone and her dark eyes glittered, and her bare legs gleamed golden in the sunlight.\\n\\n She smiled. Will very nearly smiled in response, because he was so unused to the sweetness and gentleness a woman could put into a smile, and it unsettled him.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re Will,\" she said in that low, intoxicating voice.\\n\\n \"How do you know my name?\" he said harshly.\\n\\n \"Lyra says it in her sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Where is she?\"\\n\\n \"Safe.\"\\n\\n \"I want to see her.\"\\n\\n \"Come on, then,\" she said, and got to her feet, dropping the book on the chair.\\n\\n For the first time since coming into her presence, Will looked at the monkey daemon. His fur was long and lustrous, each hair seeming to be made of pure gold, much finer than a human\u0027s, and his little face and hands were black. Will had last seen that face, contorted with hate, on the evening when he and Lyra stole the alethiometer back from Sir Charles Latrom in the house in Oxford. The monkey had tried to tear at him with his teeth until Will had slashed left-right with the knife, forcing the daemon backward, so he could close the window and shut them away in a different world. Will thought that nothing on earth would make him turn his back on that monkey now.\\n\\n But the bird-shaped Balthamos was watching closely, and Will stepped carefully over the floor of the cave and followed Mrs. Coulter to the little figure lying still in the shadows.\\n\\n And there she was, his dearest friend, asleep. So small she looked! He was amazed at how all the force and fire that was Lyra awake could look so gentle and mild when she was sleeping. At her neck Pantalaimon lay in his polecat shape, his fur glistening, and Lyra\u0027s hair lay damp across her forehead.\\n\\n He knelt down beside her and lifted the hair away. Her face was hot. Out of the corner of his eye, Will saw the golden monkey crouching to spring, and set his hand on the knife; but Mrs. Coulter shook her head very slightly, and the monkey relaxed.\\n\\n Without seeming to, Will was memorizing the exact layout of the cave: the shape and size of every rock, the slope of the floor, the exact height of the ceiling above the sleeping girl. He would need to find his way through it in the dark, and this was the only chance he\u0027d have to see it first.\\n\\n \"So you see, she\u0027s quite safe,\" said Mrs. Coulter.\\n\\n \"Why are you keeping her here? And why don\u0027t you let her wake up?\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s sit down.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t take the chair, but sat with him on the moss-covered rocks at the entrance to the cave. She sounded so kindly, and there was such sad wisdom in her eyes, that Will\u0027s mistrust deepened. He felt that every word she said was a lie, every action concealed a threat, and every smile was a mask of deceit. Well, he would have to deceive her in turn: he\u0027d have to make her think he was harmless. He had successfully deceived every teacher and every police officer and every social worker and every neighbor who had ever taken an interest in him and his home; he\u0027d been preparing for this all his life.\\n\\n Right, he thought. I can deal with you.\\n\\n \"Would you like something to drink?\" said Mrs. Coulter. \"I\u0027ll have some, too... It\u0027s quite safe. Look.\"\\n\\n She cut open some wrinkled brownish fruit and pressed the cloudy juice into two small beakers. She sipped one and offered the other to Will, who sipped, too, and found it fresh and sweet.\\n\\n \"How did you find your way here?\" she said.\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t hard to follow you.\"\\n\\n \"Evidently. Have you got Lyra\u0027s alethiometer?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, and let her work out for herself whether or not he could read it.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ve got a knife, I understand.\"\\n\\n \"Sir Charles told you that, did he?\"\\n\\n \"Sir Charles? Oh - Carlo, of course. Yes, he did. It sounds fascinating. May I see it?\"\\n\\n \"No, of course not,\" he said. \"Why are you keeping Lyra here?\"\\n\\n \"Because I love her,\" she said. \"I\u0027m her mother. She\u0027s in appalling danger and I won\u0027t let anything happen to her.\"\\n\\n \"Danger from what?\" said Will.\\n\\n \"Well...\" she said, and set her beaker down on the ground, leaning forward so that her hair swung down on either side of her face. When she sat up again, she tucked it back behind her ears with both hands, and Will smelled the fragrance of some scent she was wearing combined with the fresh smell of her body, and he felt disturbed.\\n\\n If Mrs. Coulter saw his reaction, she didn\u0027t show it. She went on: \"Look, Will, I don\u0027t know how you came to meet my daughter, and I don\u0027t know what you know already, and I certainly don\u0027t know if I can trust you; but equally, I\u0027m tired of having to lie. So here it is: the truth.\\n\\n \"I found out that my daughter is in danger from the very people I used to belong to - from the Church. Frankly, I think they want to kill her. So I found myself in a dilemma, you see: obey the Church, or save my daughter. And I was a faithful servant of the Church, too. There was no one more zealous; I gave my life to it; I served it with a passion.\\n\\n \"But I had this daughter...\"\\n\\n \"I know I didn\u0027t look after her well when she was young. She was taken away from me and brought up by strangers. Perhaps that made it hard for her to trust me. But when she was growing up, I saw the danger that she was in, and three times now I\u0027ve tried to save her from it. I\u0027ve had to become a renegade and hide in this remote place, and I thought we were safe; but now to learn that you found us so easily - well, you can understand, that worries me. The Church won\u0027t be far behind. And they want to kill her, Will. They will not let her live.\"\\n\\n \"Why? Why do they hate her so much?\"\\n\\n \"Because of what they think she\u0027s going to do. I don\u0027t know what that is; I wish I did, because then I could keep her even more safe. But all I know is that they hate her, and they have no mercy, none.\"\\n\\n She leaned forward, talking urgently and quietly and closely.\\n\\n \"Why am I telling you this?\" she went on. \"Can I trust you? I think I have to. I can\u0027t escape anymore, there\u0027s nowhere else to go. And if you\u0027re a friend of Lyra\u0027s, you might be my friend, too. And I do need friends, I do need help. Everything\u0027s against me now. The Church will destroy me, too, as well as Lyra, if they find us. I\u0027m alone, Will, just me in a cave with my daughter, and all the forces of all the worlds are trying to track us down. And here you are, to show how easy it is to find us, apparently. What are you going to do, Will? What do you want?\"\\n\\n \"Why are you keeping her asleep?\" he said, stubbornly avoiding her questions.\\n\\n \"Because what would happen if I let her wake? She\u0027d run away at once. And she wouldn\u0027t last five days.\"\\n\\n \"But why don\u0027t you explain it to her and give her the choice?\"\\n\\n \"Do you think she\u0027d listen? Do you think even if she listened she\u0027d believe me? She doesn\u0027t trust me. She hates me, Will. You must know that. She despises me. I, well... I don\u0027t know how to say it... I love her so much I\u0027ve given up everything I had - a great career, great happiness, position and wealth - everything, to come to this cave in the mountains and live on dry bread and sour fruit, just so I can keep my daughter alive. And if to do that I have to keep her asleep, then so be it. But I must keep her alive. Wouldn\u0027t your mother do as much for you?\"\\n\\n Will felt a jolt of shock and rage that Mrs. Coulter had dared to bring his own mother in to support her argument. Then the first shock was complicated by the thought that his mother, after all, had not protected him; he had had to protect her. Did Mrs. Coulter love Lyra more than Elaine Parry loved him? But that was unfair: his mother wasn\u0027t well.\\n\\n Either Mrs. Coulter did not know the boil of feelings that her simple words had lanced, or she was monstrously clever. Her beautiful eyes watched mildly as Will reddened and shifted uncomfortably; and for a moment Mrs. Coulter looked uncannily like her daughter.\\n\\n \"But what are you going to do?\" she said.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ve seen Lyra now,\" Will said, \"and she\u0027s alive, that\u0027s clear, and she\u0027s safe, I suppose. That\u0027s all I was going to do. So now I\u0027ve done it, I can go and help Lord Asriel like I was supposed to.\"\\n\\n That did surprise her a little, but she mastered it.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t mean - I thought you might help us,\" she said quite calmly, not pleading but questioning. \"With the knife. I saw what you did at Sir Charles\u0027s house. You could make it safe for us, couldn\u0027t you? You could help us get away?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to go now,\" Will said, standing up.\\n\\n She held out her hand. A rueful smile, a shrug, and a nod as if to a skillful opponent who\u0027d made a good move at the chessboard: that was what her body said. He found himself liking her, because she was brave, and because she seemed like a more complicated and richer and deeper Lyra. He couldn\u0027t help but like her.\\n\\n So he shook her hand, finding it firm and cool and soft. She turned to the golden monkey, who had been sitting behind her all the time, and a look passed between them that Will couldn\u0027t interpret.\\n\\n Then she turned back with a smile.\\n\\n \"Good-bye,\" he said.\\n\\n And she said quietly, \"Good-bye, Will.\"\\n\\n He left the cave, knowing her eyes were following, and he didn\u0027t look back once. Ama was nowhere in sight. He walked back the way he\u0027d come, keeping to the path until he heard the sound of the waterfall ahead.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s lying,\" he said to Iorek Byrnison thirty minutes later. \"Of course she\u0027s lying. She\u0027d lie even if it made things worse for herself, because she just loves lying too much to stop.\"\\n\\n \"What is your plan, then?\" said the bear, who was basking in the sunlight, his belly flat down in a patch of snow among the rocks.\\n\\n Will walked up and down, wondering whether he could use the trick that had worked in Oxford: use the knife to move into another world and then go to a spot right next to where Lyra lay, cut back through into this world, pull her through into safety, and then close up again. That was the obvious thing to do: why did he hesitate?\\n\\n Balthamos knew. In his own angel shape, shimmering like a heat haze in the sunlight, he said, \"You were foolish to go to her. All you want to do now is see the woman again.\"\\n\\n Iorek uttered a deep, quiet growl. At first Will thought he was warning Balthamos, but then with a little shock of embarrassment he realized that the bear was agreeing with the angel. The two of them had taken little notice of each other until now - their modes of being were so different - but they were of one mind about this, clearly.\\n\\n And Will scowled, but it was true. He had been captivated by Mrs. Coulter. All his thoughts referred to her: when he thought of Lyra, it was to wonder how like her mother she\u0027d be when she grew up; if he thought of the Church, it was to wonder how many of the priests and cardinals were under her spell; if he thought of his own dead father, it was to wonder whether he would have detested her or admired her; and if he thought of his own mother...\\n\\n He felt his heart grimace. He walked away from the bear and stood on a rock from which he could see across the whole valley. In the clear, cold air he could hear the distant tok-tok of someone chopping wood, he could hear a dull iron bell around the neck of a sheep, he could hear the rustling of the treetops far below. The tiniest crevices in the mountains at the horizon were clear and sharp to his eyes, as were the vultures wheeling over some near-dead creature many miles away.\\n\\n There was no doubt about it: Balthamos was right. The woman had cast a spell on him. It was pleasant and tempting to think about those beautiful eyes and the sweetness of that voice, and to recall the way her arms rose to push back that shining hair...\\n\\n With an effort he came back to his senses and heard another sound altogether: a far-distant drone.\\n\\n He turned this way and that to locate it, and found it in the north, the very direction he and Iorek had come from.\\n\\n \"Zeppelins,\" said the bear\u0027s voice, startling Will, for he hadn\u0027t heard the great creature come near. Iorek stood beside him, looking in the same direction, and then reared up high, fully twice the height of Will, his gaze intent.\\n\\n \"How many?\"\\n\\n \"Eight of them,\" said Iorek after a minute, and then Will saw them, too: little specks in a line.\\n\\n \"Can you tell how long it will take them to get here?\" Will said.\\n\\n \"They will be here not long after nightfall.\"\\n\\n \"So we won\u0027t have very much darkness. That\u0027s a pity.\"\\n\\n \"What is your plan?\"\\n\\n \"To make an opening and take Lyra through into another world, and close it again before her mother follows. The girl has a drug to wake Lyra up, but she couldn\u0027t explain very clearly how to use it, so she\u0027ll have to come into the cave as well. I don\u0027t want to put her in danger, though. Maybe you could distract Mrs. Coulter while we do that.\"\\n\\n The bear grunted and closed his eyes. Will looked around for the angel and saw his shape outlined in droplets of mist in the late afternoon light.\\n\\n \"Balthamos,\" he said, \"I\u0027m going back into the forest now, to find a safe place to make the first opening. I need you to keep watch for me and tell me the moment she comes near - her or that daemon of hers.\"\\n\\n Balthamos nodded and raised his wings to shake off the moisture. Then he soared up into the cold air and glided out over the valley as Will began to search for a world where Lyra would be safe.\\n\\n In the creaking, thrumming double bulkhead of the leading zeppelin, the dragonflies were hatching. The Lady Salmakia bent over the splitting cocoon of the electric blue one, easing the damp, filmy wings clear, taking care to let her face be the first thing that imprinted itself on the many-faceted eyes, soothing the fine-stretched nerves, whispering its name to the brilliant creature, teaching it who it was.\\n\\n In a few minutes the Chevalier Tialys would do the same to his. But for now, he was sending a message on the lodestone resonator, and his attention was fully occupied with the movement of the bow and his fingers.\\n\\n He transmitted:\\n\\n \"To Lord Roke:\\n\\n \"We are three hours from the estimated time of arrival at the valley. The Consistorial Court of Discipline intends to send a squad to the cave as soon as they land.\\n\\n \"It will divide into two units. The first unit will fight its way into the cave and kill the child, removing her head so as to prove her death. If possible, they will also capture the woman, though if that is impossible, they are to kill her.\\n\\n \"The second unit is to capture the boy alive.\\n\\n \"The remainder of the force will engage the gyropters of King Ogunwe. They estimate that the gyropters will arrive shortly after the zeppelins. In accordance with your orders, the Lady Salmakia and I will shortly leave the zeppelin and fly directly to the cave, where we shall try to defend the girl against the first unit and hold them at bay until reinforcements arrive.\\n\\n \"We await your response.\"\\n\\n The answer came almost immediately.\\n\\n \"To the Chevalier Tialys:\\n\\n \"In the light of your report, here is a change of plan.\\n\\n \"In order to prevent the enemy from killing the child, which would be the worst possible outcome, you and the Lady Salmakia are to cooperate with the boy. While he has the knife, he has the initiative, so if he opens another world and takes the girl into it, let him do so, and follow them through. Stay by their side at all times.\"\\n\\n The Chevalier Tialys replied:\\n\\n \"To Lord Roke:\\n\\n \"Your message is heard and understood. The Lady and I shall leave at once.\"\\n\\n The little spy closed the resonator and gathered his equipment together.\\n\\n \"Tialys,\" came a whisper from the dark, \"it\u0027s hatching. You should come now.\"\\n\\n He leapt up to the strut where his dragonfly had been struggling into the world, and eased it gently free of the broken cocoon. Stroking its great fierce head, he lifted the heavy antennae, still moist and curled, and let the creature taste the flavor of his skin until it was entirely under his command.\\n\\n Salmakia was fitting her dragonfly with the harness she carried everywhere: spider-silk reins, stirrups of titanium, a saddle of hummingbird skin. It was almost weightless. Tialys did the same with his, easing the straps around the insect\u0027s body, tightening, adjusting. It would wear the harness till it died.\\n\\n Then he quickly slung the pack over his shoulder and sliced through the oiled fabric of the zeppelin\u0027s skin. Beside him, the Lady had mounted her dragonfly, and now she urged it through the narrow gap into the hammering gusts. The long, frail wings trembled as she squeezed through, and then the joy of flight took over the creature, and it plunged into the wind. A few seconds later Tialys joined her in the wild air, his mount eager to fight the swift-gathering dusk itself.\\n\\n The two of them whirled upward in the icy currents, took a few moments to get their bearings, and set their course for the valley. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-amber-spyglass-his-dark-materials-3/page-11.html","bookId":2093,"book":{"id":2093,"title":"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials #3)","description":"Storyline: The Amber Spyglass(His Dark Materials 3) \\n The Amber Spyglass is the third and final novel in the His Dark Materials series, written by English author Philip Pullman, and published in 2000. \\n At the end of The Subtle Knife, Marisa Coulter captured Lyra.
