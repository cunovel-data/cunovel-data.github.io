{"id":90305,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"It was dark, with an enfolding blackness that pressed on Lyra\u0027s eyes so heavily that she almost felt the weight of the thousands of tons of rock above them. The only light they had came from the luminous tail of the Lady Salmakia\u0027s dragonfly, and even that was fading; for the poor insects had found no food in the world of the dead, and the Chevalier\u0027s had died not long before.\\n\\n So while Tialys sat on Will\u0027s shoulder, Lyra held the Lady\u0027s dragonfly in her hands as the Lady soothed it and whispered to the trembling creature, feeding it first on crumbs of biscuit and then on her own blood. If Lyra had seen her do that, she would have offered hers, since there was more of it; but it was all she could do to concentrate on placing her feet safely and avoiding the lowest parts of the rock above.\\n\\n No-Name the harpy had led them into a system of caves that would bring them, she said, to the nearest point in the world of the dead from which they could open a window to another world. Behind them came the endless column of ghosts. The tunnel was full of whispers, as the foremost encouraged those behind, as the brave urged on the fainthearted, as the old gave hope to the young.\\n\\n \"Is it much farther, No-Name?\" said Lyra quietly. \"Because this poor dragonfly\u0027s dying, and then his light\u0027ll go out.\"\\n\\n The harpy stopped and turned to say:\\n\\n \"Just follow. If you can\u0027t see, listen. If you can\u0027t hear, feel.\"\\n\\n Her eyes shone fierce in the gloom. Lyra nodded and said, \"Yes, I will, but I\u0027m not as strong as I used to be, and I\u0027m not brave, not very anyway. Please don\u0027t stop. I\u0027ll follow you - we all will. Please keep going, No-Name.\"\\n\\n The harpy turned back and moved on. The dragonfly shine was getting dimmer by the minute, and Lyra knew it would soon be completely gone.\\n\\n But as she stumbled forward, a voice spoke just beside her - a familiar voice.\\n\\n \"Lyra - Lyra, child...\"\\n\\n And she turned in delight.\\n\\n \"Mr. Scoresby! Oh, I\u0027m so glad to hear you! And it is you - I can see, just - oh, I wish I could touch you!\"\\n\\n In the faint, faint light she made out the lean form and the sardonic smile of the Texan aeronaut, and her hand reached forward of its own accord, in vain.\\n\\n \"Me too, honey. But listen to me - they\u0027re working some trouble out there, and it\u0027s aimed at you - don\u0027t ask me how. Is this the boy with the knife?\"\\n\\n Will had been looking at him, eager to see this old companion of Lyra\u0027s; but now his eyes went right past Lee to look at the ghost beside him. Lyra saw at once who it was, and marveled at this grown-up vision of Will - the same jutting jaw, the same way of holding his head.\\n\\n Will was speechless, but his father said:\\n\\n \"Listen - there\u0027s no time to talk about this - just do exactly as I say. Take the knife now and find a place where a lock has been cut from Lyra\u0027s hair.\"\\n\\n His tone was urgent, and Will didn\u0027t waste time asking why. Lyra, her eyes wide with alarm, held up the dragonfly with one hand and felt her hair with the other.\\n\\n \"No,\" said Will, \"take your hand away - I can\u0027t see.\"\\n\\n And in the faint gleam, he could see it: just above her left temple, there was a little patch of hair that was shorter than the rest.\\n\\n \"Who did that?\" said Lyra. \"And - \"\\n\\n \"Hush,\" said Will, and asked his father\u0027s ghost, \"What must I do?\"\\n\\n \"Cut the short hair off right down to her scalp. Collect it carefully, every single hair. Don\u0027t miss even one. Then open another world - any will do - and put the hair through into it, and then close it again. Do it now, at once.\"\\n\\n The harpy was watching, the ghosts behind were crowding close. Lyra could see their faint faces in the dimness. Frightened and bewildered, she stood biting her lip while Will did as his father told him, his face close up to the knifepoint in the paling dragonfly light. He cut a little hollow space in the rock of another world, put all the tiny golden hairs into it, and replaced the rock before closing the window.\\n\\n And then the ground began to shake. From somewhere very deep came a growling, grinding noise, as if the whole center of the earth were turning on itself like a vast millwheel, and little fragments of stone began to fall from the roof of the tunnel. The ground lurched suddenly to one side. Will seized Lyra\u0027s arm, and they clung together as the rock under their feet began to shift and slide, and loose pieces of stone came tumbling past, bruising their legs and feet -\\n\\n The two children, sheltering the Gallivespians, crouched down with their arms over their heads; and then in a horrible sliding movement they found themselves being borne away down to the left, and they held each other fiercely, too breathless and shaken even to cry out. Their ears were filled with the roar of thousands of tons of rock tumbling and rolling down with them.\\n\\n Finally their movement stopped, though all around them smaller rocks were still tumbling and bounding down a slope that hadn\u0027t been there a minute before. Lyra was lying on Will\u0027s left arm. With his right hand he felt for the knife; it was still there at his belt.\\n\\n \"Tialys? Salmakia?\" said Will shakily.\\n\\n \"Both here, both alive,\" said the Chevalier\u0027s voice near his ear.\\n\\n The air was full of dust, and of the cordite smell of smashed rock. It was hard to breathe, and impossible to see: the dragonfly was dead.\\n\\n \"Mr. Scoresby?\" said Lyra. \"We can\u0027t see anything... What happened?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here,\" said Lee, close by. \"I guess the bomb went off, and I guess it missed.\"\\n\\n \"Bomb?\" said Lyra, frightened; but then she said, \"Roger - are you there?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" came the little whisper. \"Mr. Parry, he saved me. I was going to fall, and he caught hold.\"\\n\\n \"Look,\" said the ghost of John Parry. \"But hold still to the rock, and don\u0027t move.\"\\n\\n The dust was clearing, and from somewhere there was light: a strange faint golden glimmer, like a luminous misty rain falling all around them. It was enough to strike their hearts ablaze with fear, for it lit up what lay to their left, the place into which it was all falling - or flowing, like a river over the edge of a waterfall.\\n\\n It was a vast black emptiness, like a shaft into the deepest darkness. The golden light flowed into it and died. They could see the other side, but it was much farther away than Will could have thrown a stone. To their right, a slope of rough stones, loose and precariously balanced, rose high into the dusty gloom.\\n\\n The children and their companions were clinging to what was not even a ledge - just some lucky handÂ¨C and footholds - on the edge of that abyss, and there was no way out except forward, along the slope, among the shattered rocks and the teetering boulders, which, it seemed, the slightest touch would send hurtling down below.\\n\\n And behind them, as the dust cleared, more and more of the ghosts were gazing in horror at the abyss. They were crouching on the slope, too frightened to move. Only the harpies were unafraid; they took to their wings and soared above, scanning backward and forward, flying back to reassure those still in the tunnel, flying ahead to search for the way out.\\n\\n Lyra checked: at least the alethiometer was safe. Suppressing her fear, she looked around, found Roger\u0027s little face, and said:\\n\\n \"Come on, then, we\u0027re all still here, we en\u0027t been hurt. And we can see now, at least. So just keep going, just keep on moving. We can\u0027t go any other way than round the edge of this...\" She gestured at the abyss. \"So we just got to keep going ahead. I swear Will and me\u0027ll just keep on till we do. So don\u0027t be scared, don\u0027t give up, don\u0027t lag behind. Tell the others. I can\u0027t look back all the time because I got to watch where I\u0027m going, so I got to trust you to come on steady after us, all right?\"\\n\\n The little ghost nodded. And so, in a shocked silence, the column of the dead began their journey along the edge of the abyss. How long it took, neither Lyra nor Will could guess; how fearful and dangerous it was, they were never able to forget. The darkness below was so profound that it seemed to pull the eyesight down into it, and a ghastly dizziness swam over their minds when they looked. Whenever they could, they looked ahead of them fixedly, on this rock, that foothold, this projection, that loose slope of gravel, and kept their eyes from the gulf; but it pulled, it tempted, and they couldn\u0027t help glancing into it, only to feel their balance tilting and their eyesight swimming and a dreadful nausea gripping their throats.\\n\\n From time to time the living ones looked back and saw the infinite line of the dead winding out of the crack they\u0027d come through: mothers pressing their infants\u0027 faces to their breasts, aged fathers clambering slowly, little children clutching the skirts of the person in front, young boys and girls of Roger\u0027s age keeping staunch and careful, so many of them... And all following Will and Lyra, so they still hoped, toward the open air.\\n\\n But some didn\u0027t trust them. They crowded close behind, and both children felt cold hands on their hearts and their entrails, and they heard vicious whispers:\\n\\n \"Where is the upper world? How much farther?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re frightened here!\"\\n\\n \"We should never have come - at least back in the world of the dead we had a little light and a little company - this is far worse!\"\\n\\n \"You did a wrong thing when you came to our land! You should have stayed in your own world and waited to die before you came down to disturb us!\"\\n\\n \"By what right are you leading us? You are only children! Who gave you the authority?\"\\n\\n Will wanted to turn and denounce them, but Lyra held his arm; they were unhappy and frightened, she said.\\n\\n Then the Lady Salmakia spoke, and her clear, calm voice carried a long way in the great emptiness.\\n\\n \"Friends, be brave! Stay together and keep going! The way is hard, but Lyra can find it. Be patient and cheerful and we\u0027ll lead you out, don\u0027t fear!\"\\n\\n Lyra felt herself strengthened by hearing this, and that was really the Lady\u0027s intention. And so they toiled on, with painful effort.\\n\\n \"Will,\" said Lyra after some minutes, \"can you hear that wind?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I can,\" said Will. \"But I can\u0027t feel it at all. And I tell you something about that hole down there. It\u0027s the same kind of thing as when I cut a window. The same kind of edge. There\u0027s something special about that kind of edge; once you\u0027ve felt it you never forget it. And I can see it there, just where the rock falls away into the dark. But that big space down there, that\u0027s not another world like all the others. It\u0027s different. I don\u0027t like it. I wish I could close it up.\"\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t closed every window you\u0027ve made.\"\\n\\n \"No, because I couldn\u0027t, some of them. But I know I should. Things go wrong if they\u0027re left open. And one that big...\" He gestured downward, not wanting to look. \"It\u0027s wrong. Something bad will happen.\"\\n\\n While they were talking together, another conversation had been taking place a little way off: the Chevalier Tialys was talking quietly with the ghosts of Lee Scoresby and John Parry.\\n\\n \"So what are you saying, John?\" said Lee. \"You\u0027re saying we ought not to go out into the open air? Man, every single part of me is aching to join the rest of the living universe again!\"\\n\\n \"Yes, and so am I,\" said Will\u0027s father. \"But I believe that if those of us who are used to fighting could manage to hold ourselves back, we might be able to throw ourselves into the battle on Asriel\u0027s side. And if it came at the right moment, it might make all the difference.\"\\n\\n \"Ghosts?\" said Tialys, trying to hold the skepticism from his voice, and failing. \"How could you fight?\"\\n\\n \"We couldn\u0027t hurt living creatures, that\u0027s quite true. But Asriel\u0027s army is going to contend with other kinds of being as well.\"\\n\\n \"Those Specters,\" said Lee.\\n\\n \"Just what I was thinking. They make for the daemon, don\u0027t they? And our daemons are long gone. It\u0027s worth a try, Lee.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m with you, my friend.\"\\n\\n \"And you, sir,\" said John Parry\u0027s ghost to the Chevalier: \"I have spoken to the ghosts of your people. Will you live long enough to see the world again, before you die and come back as a ghost?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true, our lives are short compared to yours. I have a few days more to live,\" said Tialys, \"and the Lady Salmakia a little longer, perhaps. But thanks to what those children are doing, our exile as ghosts will not be permanent. I have been proud to help them.\"\\n\\n They moved on. And that abominable fall yawned all the time, and one little slip, one footstep on a loose rock, one careless handhold, would send you down forever and ever, thought Lyra, so far down you\u0027d die of starvation before you ever hit the bottom, and then your poor ghost would go on falling and falling into an infinite gulf, with no one to help, no hands to reach down and lift you out, forever conscious and forever falling...\\n\\n Oh, that would be far worse than the gray, silent world they were leaving, wouldn\u0027t it?\\n\\n A strange thing happened to her mind then. The thought of falling induced a kind of vertigo in Lyra, and she swayed. Will was ahead of her, just too far to reach, or she might have taken his hand; but at that moment she was more conscious of Roger, and a little flicker of vanity blazed up for a moment in her heart. There\u0027d been an occasion once on Jordan College roof when just to frighten him, she\u0027d defied her vertigo and walked along the edge of the stone gutter.\\n\\n She looked back to remind him of it now. She was Roger\u0027s Lyra, full of grace and daring; she didn\u0027t need to creep along like an insect.\\n\\n But the little boy\u0027s whispering voice said, \"Lyra, be careful - remember, you en\u0027t dead like us - \"\\n\\n And it seemed to happen so slowly, but there was nothing she could do: her weight shifted, the stones moved under her feet, and helplessly she began to slide. In the first moment it was annoying, and then it was comic: How silly! she thought. But as she utterly failed to hold on to anything, as the stones rolled and tumbled beneath her, as she slid down toward the edge, gathering speed, the horror of it slammed into her. She was going to fall. There was nothing to stop her. It was already too late.\\n\\n Her body convulsed with terror. She wasn\u0027t aware of the ghosts who flung themselves down to try and catch her, only to find her hurtling through them like a stone through mist; she didn\u0027t know that Will was yelling her name so loudly that the abyss resounded with it. Instead, her whole being was a vortex of roaring fear. Faster and faster she tumbled, down and down, and some ghosts couldn\u0027t bear to watch; they hid their eyes and cried aloud.\\n\\n Will felt electric with fear. He watched in anguish as Lyra slid farther and farther, knowing he could do nothing, and knowing he had to watch. He couldn\u0027t hear the desperate wail he was uttering any more than she could. Another two seconds - another second - she was at the edge, she couldn\u0027t stop, she was there, she was falling -\\n\\n And out of the dark swooped that creature whose claws had raked her scalp not long before, No-Name the harpy, woman-faced, bird-winged, and those same claws closed tight around the girl\u0027s wrist. Together they plunged on down, the extra weight almost too much for the harpy\u0027s strong wings, but they beat and beat and beat, and her claws held firm, and slowly, heavily, slowly, heavily, the harpy carried the child up and up out of the gulf and brought her limp and fainting to Will\u0027s reaching arms.\\n\\n He held her tight, pressing her to his chest, feeling the wild beat of her heart against his ribs. She wasn\u0027t Lyra just then, and he wasn\u0027t Will; she wasn\u0027t a girl, and he wasn\u0027t a boy. They were the only two human beings in that vast gulf of death. They clung together, and the ghosts clustered around, whispering comfort, blessing the harpy. Closest at hand were Will\u0027s father and Lee Scoresby, and how they longed to hold her, too; and Tialys and Salmakia spoke to No-Name, praising her, calling her the savior of them all, generous one, blessing her kindness.\\n\\n As soon as Lyra could move, she reached out trembling for the harpy and put her arms around her neck, kissing and kissing her ravaged face. She couldn\u0027t speak. All the words, all the confidence, all the vanity had been shaken out of her.\\n\\n They lay still for some minutes. Once the terror had begun to subside, they set off again, Will holding Lyra\u0027s hand tightly in his good one. They crept forward, testing each spot before they put any weight on it, a process so slow and wearisome that they thought they might die of fatigue; but they couldn\u0027t rest, they couldn\u0027t stop. How could anyone rest, with that fearful gulf below them?\\n\\n And after another hour of toil, he said to her:\\n\\n \"Look ahead. I think there\u0027s a way out...\"\\n\\n It was true: the slope was getting easier, and it was even possible to climb slightly, up and away from the edge. And ahead: wasn\u0027t that a fold in the wall of the cliff? Could that really be a way out?\\n\\n Lyra looked into Will\u0027s brilliant, strong eyes and smiled.\\n\\n They clambered on, up and farther up, with every step moving farther from the abyss. And as they climbed, they found the ground firmer, the handholds more secure, the footholds less liable to roll and twist their ankles.\\n\\n \"We must have climbed a fair way now,\" Will said. \"I could try the knife and see what I find.\"\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" said the harpy. \"Farther to go yet. This is a bad place to open. Better place higher up.\"\\n\\n They carried on quietly, hand, foot, weight, move, test, hand, foot... Their fingers were raw, their knees and hips were trembling with the effort, their heads ached and rang with exhaustion. They climbed the last few feet up to the foot of the cliff, where a narrow defile led a little way into the shadow.\\n\\n Lyra watched with aching eyes as Will took the knife and began to search the air, touching, withdrawing, searching, touching again.\\n\\n \"Ah,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You found an open space?\"\\n\\n \"I think so...\"\\n\\n \"Will,\" said his father\u0027s ghost, \"stop a moment. Listen to me.\"\\n\\n Will put down the knife and turned. In all the effort he hadn\u0027t been able to think of his father, but it was good to know he was there. Suddenly he realized that they were going to part for the last time.\\n\\n \"What will happen when you go outside?\" Will said. \"Will you just vanish?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet. Mr. Scoresby and I have an idea. Some of us will remain here for a little while, and we shall need you to let us into Lord Asriel\u0027s world, because he might need our help. What\u0027s more,\" he went on somberly, looking at Lyra, \"you\u0027ll need to travel there yourselves, if you want to find your daemons again. Because that\u0027s where they\u0027ve gone.\"\\n\\n \"But Mr. Parry,\" said Lyra, \"how do you know our daemons have gone into my father\u0027s world?\"\\n\\n \"I was a shaman when I was alive. I learned how to see things. Ask your alethiometer - it\u0027ll confirm what I say. But remember this about daemons,\" he said, and his voice was intense and emphatic. \"The man you knew as Sir Charles Latrom had to return to his own world periodically; he could not live permanently in mine. The philosophers of the Guild of the Torre degli Angeli, who traveled between worlds for three hundred years or more, found the same thing to be true, and gradually their world weakened and decayed as a result.\\n\\n \"And then there is what happened to me. I was a soldier; I was an officer in the Marines, and then I earned my living as an explorer; I was as fit and healthy as it\u0027s possible for a human to be. Then I walked out of my own world by accident, and couldn\u0027t find the way back. I did many things and learned a great deal in the world I found myself in, but ten years after I arrived there, I was mortally sick.\\n\\n \"And this is the reason for all those things: your daemon can only live its full life in the world it was born in. Elsewhere it will eventually sicken and die. We can travel, if there are openings into other worlds, but we can only live in our own. Lord Asriel\u0027s great enterprise will fail in the end for the same reason: we have to build the Republic of Heaven where we are, because for us there is no elsewhere.\\n\\n \"Will, my boy, you and Lyra can go out now for a brief rest; you need that, and you deserve it; but then you must come back into the dark with me and Mr. Scoresby for one last journey.\"\\n\\n Will and Lyra exchanged a look. Then he cut a window, and it was the sweetest thing they had ever seen.\\n\\n The night air filled their lungs, fresh and clean and cool; their eyes took in a canopy of dazzling stars, and the shine of water somewhere below, and here and there groves of great trees, as high as castles, dotting the wide savanna.\\n\\n Will enlarged the window as wide as he could, moving across the grass to left and right, making it big enough for six, seven, eight to walk through abreast, out of the land of the dead.\\n\\n The first ghosts trembled with hope, and their excitement passed back like a ripple over the long line behind them, young children and aged parents alike looking up and ahead with delight and wonder as the first stars they had seen for centuries shone through into their poor starved eyes.\\n\\n The first ghost to leave the world of the dead was Roger. He took a step forward, and turned to look back at Lyra, and laughed in surprise as he found himself turning into the night, the starlight, the air... and then he was gone, leaving behind such a vivid little burst of happiness that Will was reminded of the bubbles in a glass of champagne.\\n\\n The other ghosts followed Roger, and Will and Lyra fell exhausted on the dew-laden grass, every nerve in their bodies blessing the sweetness of the good soil, the night air, the stars. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-amber-spyglass-his-dark-materials-3/page-26.html","bookId":2093,"book":{"id":2093,"title":"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials #3)","description":"Storyline: The Amber Spyglass(His Dark Materials 3) \\n The Amber Spyglass is the third and final novel in the His Dark Materials series, written by English author Philip Pullman, and published in 2000. \\n At the end of The Subtle Knife, Marisa Coulter captured Lyra.
