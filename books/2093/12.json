{"id":90291,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"As darkness fell, this was how things stood. In his adamant tower, Lord Asriel paced up and down. His attention was fixed on the little figure beside the lodestone resonator, and every other report had been diverted, every part of his mind was directed to the news that came to the small square block of stone under the lamplight. King Ogunwe sat in the cabin of his gyropter, swiftly working out a plan to counter the intentions of the Consistorial Court, which he\u0027d just learned about from the Gallivespian in his own aircraft. The navigator was scribbling some figures on a scrap of paper, which he handed to the pilot. The essential thing was speed: getting their troops on the ground first would make all the difference. The gyropters were faster than zeppelins, but they were still some way behind. In the zeppelins of the Consistorial Court, the Swiss Guard were attending to their kit. Their crossbows were deadly over five hundred yards, and an archer could load and fire fifteen bolts a minute. The spiral fins, made of horn, gave the bolt a spin and made the weapon as accurate as a rifle. It was also, of course, silent, which might be a great advantage. Mrs. Coulter lay awake in the entrance to the cave. The golden monkey was restless, and frustrated: the bats had left the cave with the coming of darkness, and there was nothing to torment. He prowled about by Mrs. Coulter\u0027s sleeping bag, scratching with a little horny finger at the occasional glowflies that settled in the cave and smearing their luminescence over the rock. Lyra lay hot and almost as restless, but deep, deep asleep, locked into oblivion by the draught her mother had forced down her only an hour before. There was a dream that had occupied her for a long time, and now it had returned, and little whimpers of pity and rage and Lyratic resolution shook her breast and her throat, making Pantalaimon grind his polecat teeth in sympathy. Not far away, under the wind-tossed pines on the forest path, Will and Ama were making their way toward the cave. Will had tried to explain to Ama what he was going to do, but her daemon could make no sense of it, and when he cut a window and showed her, she was so terrified that she nearly fainted. He had to move calmly and speak quietly in order to keep her nearby, because she refused to let him take the powder from her, or even to tell him how it was to be used. In the end he had to say simply, \"Keep very quiet and follow me,\" and hope that she would. Iorek, in his armor, was somewhere close by, waiting to hold off the soldiers from the zeppelins so as to give Will enough time to work. What neither of them knew was that Lord Asriel\u0027s force was also closing in: the wind from time to time brought a far-distant clatter to Iorek\u0027s ears, but whereas he knew what zeppelin engines sounded like, he had never heard a gyropter, and he could make nothing of it. Balthamos might have been able to tell them, but Will was troubled about him. Now that they\u0027d found Lyra, the angel had begun to withdraw back into his grief: he was silent, distracted, and sullen. And that, in turn, made it harder to talk to Ama. As they paused on the path, Will said to the air, \"Balthamos? Are you there?\" \"Yes,\" said the angel tunelessly. \"Balthamos, please stay with me. Stay close and warn me of any danger. I need you.\" \"I haven\u0027t abandoned you yet,\" said the angel. That was the best Will could get out of him. Far above in the buffeting midair, Tialys and Salmakia soared over the valley, trying to see down to the cave. The dragonflies would do exactly as they were told, but their bodies couldn\u0027t easily cope with cold, and besides, they were tossed about dangerously in the wild wind. Their riders guided them low, among the shelter of the trees, and then flew from branch to branch, taking their bearings in the gathering dark. Will and Ama crept up in the windy moonlight to the closest point they could reach that was still out of sight of the cave mouth. It happened to be behind a heavy-leaved bush just off the path, and there he cut a window in the air. The only world he could find with the same conformation of ground was a bare, rocky place, where the moon glared down from a starry sky onto a bleached bone-white ground where little insects crawled and uttered their scraping, chittering sounds over a wide silence. Ama followed him through, fingers and thumbs moving furiously to protect her from the devils that must be haunting this ghastly place; and her daemon, adapting at once, became a lizard and scampered over the rocks with quick feet. Will saw a problem. It was simply that the brilliant moonlight on the bone-colored rocks would shine like a lantern once he opened the window in Mrs. Coulter\u0027s cave. He\u0027d have to open it quickly, pull Lyra through, and close it again at once. They could wake her up in this world, where it was safer. He stopped on the dazzling slope and said to Ama: \"We must be very quick and completely silent. No noise, not even a whisper.\" She understood, though she was frightened. The little packet of powder was in her breast pocket: she\u0027d checked it a dozen times, and she and her daemon had rehearsed the task so often that she was sure they could do it in total darkness. They climbed on up the bone-white rocks, Will measuring the distance carefully until he estimated that they would be well inside the cave. Then he took the knife and cut the smallest possible window he could see through, no larger than the circle he could make with thumb and forefinger. He put his eye to it quickly to keep the moonlight out and looked through. There it all was: he\u0027d calculated well. He could see the cave mouth ahead, the rocks dark against the night sky; he could see the shape of Mrs. Coulter, asleep, with her golden daemon beside her; he could even see the monkey\u0027s tail, trailing negligently over the sleeping bag. Changing his angle and looking closer, he saw the rock behind which Lyra was lying. He couldn\u0027t see her, though. Was he too close? He shut that window, moved back a step or two, and opened again. She wasn\u0027t there. \"Listen,\" he said to Ama and her daemon, \"the woman has moved her and I can\u0027t see where she is. I\u0027m going to have to go through and look around the cave to find her, and cut through as soon as I\u0027ve done that. So stand back - keep out of the way so I don\u0027t accidentally cut you when I come back. If I get stuck there for any reason, go back and wait by the other window, where we came in.\" \"We should both go through,\" Ama said, \"because I know how to wake her, and you don\u0027t, and I know the cave better than you do, too.\" Her face was stubborn, her lips pressed together, her fists clenched. Her lizard daemon acquired a ruff and raised it slowly around his neck. Will said, \"Oh, very well. But we go through quickly and in complete silence, and you do exactly what I say, at once, you understand?\" She nodded and patted her pocket yet again to check the medicine. Will made a small opening, low down, looked through, and enlarged it swiftly, getting through in a moment on hands and knees. Ama was right behind him, and altogether the window was open for less than ten seconds. They crouched on the cave floor behind a large rock, with the bird-formed Balthamos beside them, their eyes taking some moments to adjust from the moon-drenched brilliance of the other world. Inside the cave it was much darker, and much more full of sound: mostly the wind in the trees, but below that was another sound, too. It was the roar of a zeppelin\u0027s engine, and it wasn\u0027t far away. With the knife in his right hand, Will balanced himself carefully and looked around. Ama was doing the same, and her owl-eyed daemon was peering this way and that; but Lyra was not at this end of the cave. There was no doubt about it. Will raised his head over the rock and took a long, steady look down toward the entrance, where Mrs. Coulter and her daemon lay deep in sleep. And then his heart sank. There lay Lyra, stretched out in the depths of her sleep, right next to Mrs. Coulter. Their outlines had merged in the darkness; no wonder he hadn\u0027t seen her. Will touched Anna\u0027s hand and pointed. \"We\u0027ll just have to do it very carefully,\" he whispered. Something was happening outside. The roar of the zeppelins was now much louder than the wind in the trees, and lights were moving about, too, shining down through the branches from above. The quicker they got Lyra out, the better, and that meant darting down there now before Mrs. Coulter woke up, cutting through, pulling her to safety, and closing again. He whispered that to Ama. She nodded. Then, as he was about to move, Mrs. Coulter woke up. She stirred and said something, and instantly the golden monkey sprang to his feet. Will could see his silhouette in the cave mouth, crouching, attentive, and then Mrs. Coulter herself sat up, shading her eyes against the light outside. Will\u0027s left hand was tight around Ama\u0027s wrist. Mrs. Coulter got up, fully dressed, lithe, alert, not at all as if she\u0027d just been asleep. Perhaps she\u0027d been awake all the time. She and the golden monkey were crouching inside the cave mouth, watching and listening, as the light from the zeppelins swung from side to side above the treetops and the engines roared, and shouts, male voices warning or calling orders, made it clear that they should move fast, very fast. Will squeezed Ama\u0027s wrist and darted forward, watching the ground in case he stumbled, running fast and low. Then he was at Lyra\u0027s side, and she was deep asleep, Pantalaimon around her neck; and then Will held up the knife and felt carefully, and a second later there would have been an opening to pull Lyra through into safety - But he looked up. He looked at Mrs. Coulter. She had turned around silently, and the glare from the sky, reflected off the damp cave wall, hit her face, and for a moment it wasn\u0027t her face at all; it was his own mother\u0027s face, reproaching him, and his heart quailed from sorrow; and then as he thrust with the knife, his mind left the point, and with a wrench and a crack, the knife fell in pieces to the ground. It was broken. Now he couldn\u0027t cut his way out at all. He said to Ama, \"Wake her up. Do it now.\" Then he stood up, ready to fight. He\u0027d strangle that monkey first. He was tensed to meet its leap, and he found he still had the hilt of the knife in his hand; at least he could use it to hit with. But there was no attack either from the golden monkey or from Mrs. Coulter. She simply moved a little to let the light from outside show the pistol in her hand. In doing so, she let some of the light shine on what Ama was doing: she was sprinkling a powder on Lyra\u0027s upper lip and watching as Lyra breathed in, helping it into her nostrils by using her own daemon\u0027s tail as a brush. Will heard a change in the sounds from outside: there was another note now as well as the roar of the zeppelins. It sounded familiar, like an intrusion from his own world, and then he recognized the clatter of a helicopter. Then there was another and another, and more lights swept across the ever-moving trees outside, in a brilliant green scatter of radiance. Mrs. Coulter turned briefly as the new sound came to her, but too briefly for Will to jump and seize the gun. As for the monkey daemon, he glared at Will without blinking, crouched ready to spring. Lyra was moving and murmuring. Will bent down and squeezed her hand, and the other daemon nudged Pantalaimon, lifting his heavy head, whispering to him. Outside there was a shout, and a man fell out of the sky, to land with a sickening crash not five yards from the entrance to the cave. Mrs. Coulter didn\u0027t flinch; she looked at him coolly and turned back to Will. A moment later there came a crack of rifle fire from above, and a second after that, a storm of shooting broke out, and the sky was full of explosions, of the crackle of flame, of bursts of gunfire. Lyra was struggling up into consciousness, gasping, sighing, moaning, pushing herself up only to fall back weakly, and Pantalaimon was yawning, stretching, snapping at the other daemon, flopping clumsily to one side as his muscles failed to act. As for Will, he was searching the cave floor with the utmost care for the pieces of the broken knife. No time to wonder how it had happened, or whether it could be mended; but he was the knife bearer, and he had to gather it up safely. As he found each piece, he lifted it carefully, every nerve in his body aware of his missing fingers, and slipped it into the sheath. He could see the pieces quite easily, because the metal caught the gleam from outside: seven of them, the smallest being the point itself. He picked them all up and then turned back to try and make sense of the fight outside. Somewhere above the trees, the zeppelins were hovering, and men were sliding down ropes, but the wind made it difficult for the pilots to hold the aircraft steady. Meanwhile, the first gyropters had arrived above the cliff. There was only room for them to land one at a time, and then the African riflemen had to make their way down the rock face. It was one of them who had been picked off by a lucky shot from the swaying zeppelins. By this time, both sides had landed some troops. Some had been killed between the sky and the ground; several more were wounded and lay on the cliff or among the trees. But neither force had yet reached the cave, and still the power inside it lay with Mrs. Coulter. Will said above the noise: \"What are you going to do?\" \"Hold you captive.\" \"What, as hostages? Why should they take any notice of that? They want to kill us all anyway.\" \"One force does, certainly,\" she said, \"but I\u0027m not sure about the other. We must hope the Africans win.\" She sounded happy, and in the glare from outside, Will saw her face full of joy and life and energy. \"You broke the knife,\" he said. \"No, I didn\u0027t. I wanted it whole, so we could get away. You were the one who broke it.\" Lyra\u0027s voice came urgently: \"Will?\" she muttered. \"Is that Will?\" \"Lyra!\" he said, and knelt quickly beside her. Ama was helping her sit up. \"What\u0027s happening?\" Lyra said. \"Where are we? Oh, Will, I had this dream...\" \"We\u0027re in a cave. Don\u0027t move too fast, you\u0027ll get dizzy. Just take it carefully. Find your strength. You\u0027ve been asleep for days and days.\" Her eyes were still heavy, and she was racked by deep yawns, but she was desperate to be awake, and he helped her up, putting her arm over his shoulder and taking much of her weight. Ama watched timidly, for now that the strange girl was awake, she was nervous of her. Will breathed in the scent of Lyra\u0027s sleepy body with a happy satisfaction: she was here, she was real. They sat on a rock. Lyra held his hand and rubbed her eyes. \"What\u0027s happening, Will?\" she whispered. \"Ama here got some powder to wake you up,\" he said, speaking very quietly, and Lyra turned to the girl, seeing her for the first time, and put her hand on Ama\u0027s shoulder in thanks. \"I got here as soon as I could,\" Will went on, \"but some soldiers did, too. I don\u0027t know who they are. We\u0027ll get out as soon as we can.\" Outside, the noise and confusion were reaching a height; one of the gyropters had taken a fusillade from a zeppelin\u0027s machine gun while the riflemen were jumping out on the cliff top, and it burst into flames, not only killing the crew but also preventing the remaining gyropters from landing. Another zeppelin, meanwhile, had found a clear space farther down the valley, and the crossbow men who disembarked from it were now running up the path to reinforce those already in action. Mrs. Coulter was following as much as she could see from the cave mouth, and now she raised her pistol, supporting it with both hands, and took careful aim before firing. Will saw the flash from the muzzle, but heard nothing over the explosions and gunfire from outside. If she does that again, he thought, I\u0027ll rush and knock her over, and he turned to whisper that to Balthamos; but the angel was nowhere near. Instead, Will saw with dismay, he was cowering against the wall of the cave, back in his angel form, trembling and whimpering. \"Balthamos!\" Will said urgently. \"Come on, they can\u0027t hurt you! And you have to help us! You can fight - you know that - you\u0027re not a coward - and we need you - \" But before the angel could reply, something else happened. Mrs. Coulter cried out and reached down to her ankle, and simultaneously the golden monkey snatched at something in midair, with a snarl of glee. A voice - a woman\u0027s voice - but somehow minute - came from the thing in the monkey\u0027s paw: \"Tialys! Tialys!\" It was a tiny woman, no bigger than Lyra\u0027s hand, and the monkey was already pulling and pulling at one of her arms so that she cried out in pain. Ama knew he wouldn\u0027t stop till he\u0027d torn it off, but Will leapt forward as he saw the pistol fall from Mrs. Coulter\u0027s hand. And he caught the gun - but then Mrs. Coulter fell still, and Will became aware of a strange stalemate. The golden monkey and Mrs. Coulter were both utterly motionless. Her face was distorted with pain and fury, but she dared not move, because standing on her shoulder was a tiny man with his heel pressed against her neck, his hands entwined in her hair; and Will, through his astonishment, saw on that heel a glistening horny spur and knew what had caused her to cry out a moment before. He must have stung her ankle. But the little man couldn\u0027t hurt Mrs. Coulter anymore, because of the danger his partner was in at the hands of the monkey; and the monkey couldn\u0027t harm her, in case the little man dug his poison spur into Mrs. Coulter\u0027s jugular vein. None of them could move. Breathing deeply and swallowing hard to govern the pain, Mrs. Coulter turned her tear-dashed eyes to Will and said calmly, \"So, Master Will, what do you think we should do now?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-amber-spyglass-his-dark-materials-3/page-12.html","bookId":2093,"book":{"id":2093,"title":"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials #3)","description":"Storyline: The Amber Spyglass(His Dark Materials 3) The Amber Spyglass is the third and final novel in the His Dark Materials series, written by English author Philip Pullman, and published in 2000.
