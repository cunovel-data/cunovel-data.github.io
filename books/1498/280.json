Do you want to accompany me in meeting with the other two commanders tomorrow? Even though they don’t have any orders from their kingdom, it will be better for you to explain the circumstances to them.” “It won’t be a problem as it’s my responsibility. We’ll head there with you tomorrow.” “Alright, I won’t disturb your rest any further.” Everyone stood up to see off the prince. “Zhan Hu, how could you tell your father about our matters? If it didn’t go well, it might have ruined the base that we have been bitterly constructing. Do you understand? How can you be so irresponsible?” Xiu Si, who had never fumed, angered after sending the prince off. Zhan Hu looked helplessly at me before muttering, “I...I just blurted it out. I’m sorry.” I held Xiu Si back. “Let’s forget about it. Big Brother Xiu Si, Big Brother Zhan Hu also doesn’t wish for any mishaps. They will also find that out sooner or later.” Xiu Si sighed. “Zhan Hu, I might have said it too harshly, but we are currently at a critical juncture so we can’t make even the slightest mistake. If there’s a mistake that were to happen, not only will we be finished, there won’t be any forces in the world left that can mediate in integrating the various races to deal with the Monster King.” I patted Zhan Hu, whose face was covered with perspiration. “What Big Brother Xiu Si said is right. Big Brother, you must pay more attention in the future. Even though the Prince and the rest are the close with you, when we are dealing with the fate of the world, we mustn’t be careless. Xiu Si also meant well. It definitely wasn’t personal.” Zhan Hu sheepishly replied, “I know that I’m in the wrong. Zhang Gong, I’ll control my mouth from now on.” I smiled. “That’s for the best. Alright, it’s already very late. How about some supper? Big Brother Xiu Si, you should also stop being angry.” 　　………… Mu Zi and I were strolling in the courtyard. The night was mesmerizing. The wind brought a refreshing feeling with it as it blew. Mu Zi held onto my hand. “Zhang Gong, our plans finally has hope, but why are you still unhappy?” I smiled. “This is only part of our plans. Even if it’s important, it’s not the most crucial part. I’m worried about the Monster King, as we don’t know when he will suddenly appear before us. We’re in the open, while he’s in hiding. Even while I\u0027m at my best, when I try imaging his strength, I get a sense of foreboding. After these matters here are over, I want to head to a place to further improve my powers. The God King had said that only if I head there, I will then really have the power to fight against the Monster King.” Mu Zi asked, astonished, “What place? I’ve never heard this from you before.” “Currently I can’t tell you that, as I don’t know if it’s good or bad to head there. Mu Zi, please promise me that if something was to happen to me, you must take care of yourself and find another person who will love you, alright?” After hearing what I said, Mu Zi’s eye rim reddened. “Zhang Gong, why are you still asking me such things at this point? You’re the only one that can bring me joy in this world. After experiencing so many up and downs, can it be that you don’t have faith in me?” I smiled as I shook my head before gently wiping off her tears that flowed from her eyes. “Don’t misunderstand. It’s not that I don’t trust you, but it’s only natural to wish her all the best when loving somebody. When everything is over and I survive, we can still be like we are now. I’ll definitely take care of you for all eternity. However, it’s hard to predict what happens in the future, as neither you nor I know what will happen. I don’t wish for you to abandon your life’s happiness for me. Do you understand? Please promise me that no matter what happens, you’ll still live on happily, alright?” Mu Zi abruptly clung on my neck as she burst into tears. My heart was very calm because I had finally said what I had been storing in my heart. I gently hugged her waist as I let her to freely vent her feelings. It was a long time before Mu Zi gradually stopped crying. The clothes on my shoulder were soaked. I lifted her charming face and gently nudged her reddened nose as I teased her, “Aiya! Mu Zi, why is your nose so red? Should I get Big Brother Xiu Si to give it a look?” Mu Zi pouted her small adorable mouth as she turned tears to laughter. “You’re detestable. You only know how to bully me.” I gently kissed on her forehead. “How is my previous suggestion? You still haven’t answered me.” Mu Zi, who had just stopped crying, teared again. While she hit on my shoulder, she shouted, “Not good! Not Good! Ten thousand times not good!” I grabbed on her fist. “Mu Zi, don’t be like this. Why are you acting like a child? You have to face the reality, alright?” Feeling wronged, Mu Zi lifted her head and replied, “Why? Why must you always push me away? I’ll give you a clear answer. I, Mu Zi, will solely love Zhang Gong Wei for all eternity. No matter what changes you may have, as long as you’re alive, I’ll stay by your side to serve and take care of you forever, in order to be your most obedient and loving wife. If...If you were to die, I still won’t change and chase you to the next world to continue being your wife. Please don’t push me away. If you still don’t want me, I’ll die in front of you right now.” Mu Zi’s firm conviction had broken through my last defence against her. I could no longer deny her overflowing feelings. I tightly embraced her and frantically kissed every part of her face before finally landing on her cherry lips. Mu Zi also gradually became passionate as I expressed my love for her, as she frantically responded to me. Luckily, we were in the courtyard and not in a room. Otherwise, I really didn’t know what would happen. I reluctantly left her slightly swollen red lips after a long time. I looked deeply in her eyes. “Mu Zi, I love you. I really do. My love for you has never changed. I won’t avoid my feelings any longer, in order to make you the happiest girl in this world. I’ll use everything within my power to protect and cherish you. Will you be my wife?” We calmly looked at each other. Tears were flowing down Mu Zi’s face as she constantly nodded. Her translucent tears drifted through the air, creating a moving scene. “I’m willing. I really am. I’m willing to be Zhang Gong Wei’s wife through all of eternity and will never leave you.” The great God inheritor, Child of Light, Grand Magister Zhang Gong Wei and the Demon race’s princess, Dark elemental Magister Mu Zi, had certified their love under the mesmerizing moon light on this very night as they swore to be together for their entire life.
