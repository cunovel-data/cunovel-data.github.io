While it was circulating, I investigated its usages. As I meditated, the seal Mi Jia Lie left on my mind was lifted. His memories flowed through me, allowing me to comprehend the usage for the newfound divine powers and techniques in my body. If I could fuse these powers and techniques with the Holy Sword’s might, I would reach the peak realm. Looking at his memories, I understood why the Holy Sword’s power was so immense. The Dark Monster Blade wielded by the Dark Monster Jia Si Ke Li Duo couldn’t be compared to the tyrannical might of its divine power. The Radiant Holy Sword was once the weapon of the God King, it was the greatest divine instrument in the God’s Realm.\n Following the immense surge of divine power, I unknowingly floated mid air and the power coalesced in the center of the room. Fortunately, under my suppression, the wild power stayed within a three meter radius of me, else the room would have been blown apart. After an entire day, I finally comprehended the information contained in Mi Jia Lie’s memories and gradually gained mastery over the divine power in my body. I didn’t know that Mu Zi and Hai Shui had returned. To be honest, they couldn’t even enter the room, the immense divine power was protecting my body, making its golden radiance fill the entire room.\n “Elder sister Mu Zi, we can’t enter. What shall we do?” Hai Shui asked anxiously.\n Mu Zi raised her head to look at the darkened sky. “It seems that he won’t wake up. Let’s not disturb him and spend the night in the lounge. What he said was right. This room didn’t need protection, Zhang Gong’s power was more than sufficient. It seems that we really do need to cultivate from now on. If not, the gap will become too large.”\n Hai Shui chuckled lightly. “Elder sister, why worry? We won’t need to cultivate anymore now that he’s so strong. Won’t it be easier for him to protect us?”\n Mu Zi’s face reddened. “You must be happy to see him return and promise not to leave us behind. You should be at ease now. When you were depressed in the past, I was really worried! Now that we have hope for successfully defeating the Monster race, we can enjoy life. I don’t know how matters are for the Demon race and whether or not father can hold back the Monster race’s attacks. When we looked at the gulf before, it had already quieted. I believe that the monsters that invaded the Demon and Beast races will be eliminated sooner or later.”\n Hai Shui lowered her head. “Elder sister, I’ve made you worry about me. The Demon race should be alright. It’s also useless to worry now. Let’s go and find some blankets, it’s getting cold.”\n 　　…………\n My consciousness was compl immersed in my cultivation so I didn’t know how much time had passed. I finally understood the methods for using the divine powers. With a loud yell, my consciousness returned, my senses gradually came back into focus. I gradually withdrew the divine powers that were being emitted from my body, reverting my golden eyes back to their original appearance. ‘Hmm?’ After withdrawing my powers, the room was so bright! I clearly remembered it to have only a single window though. When I raised my head head in curiousity, I was shocked. I didn’t know when it happened but the entire roof had simply disappeared, allowing the bright sunlight to enter the room. I no longer a wondered why the room was very bright. It was definitely because of my immense divine power. It wasn’t too bad though, at least the walls didn’t collapse.\n “Zhang Gong, so you’ve finally woken up.” Mu Zi’s unhappy voice sounded from outside. When the door opened, Mu Zi and Hai Shui came in.\n Seeing them, my heart warmed. “How did you know I’d woken up? Your gauging of time is really accurate!”\n Hai Shui laughed. “How can we not know? After the roof got blasted away, the divine light soared into the sky, making everyone in the fort come looking for you. We had to spend lots of effort to maintain the peace while you trained! When that divine light suddenly disappeared elder sis Mu Zi and I knew that you were done cultivating. You’re really capable of meditating for 5 days.”\n I was alarmed. “What? It’s been 5 days? Time flies.”\n Mu Zi said, “Quickly get up, lazy bum. How are your injuries?” Upon asking that, Mu Zi’s face expressed care and concern.\n I quickly moved between them, embracing their soft and delicate bodies, one in each arm. “Alright, don’t worry about me. That’s right, are there any movements from the Monster race and have any monsters appeared from the gulf?”\n Mu Zi frowned. “I’m also very surprised, after you started meditating, there wasn’t the slightest movement from the Monster race. The gulf remains peaceful as though nothing ever happened.”\n I was stunned. “It seems as though they’re gathering power while they await the revival of the Monster King. It’ll probably be the last battle with the Monster race the next time they appear. How are Big Brother Zhan Hu and the rest?”\n Mu Zi replied, “Their injuries have recovered, but they are still feeling weak.”\n I nodded. “Alright, I’ll go and see them. I must quickly give them the divine wills as soon as possible so that they will have sufficient powers to help me eliminate the Monster King by using the ultimate forbidden spell.”\n When Mu Zi, Hai Shui and I walked out of the room, Zhan Hu and the rest were working out in the courtyard. Seeing their energy, vigor, and agility, they didn’t seem to be injured. \n Zhan Hu laughed. “Zhang Gong, you’ve woken up. You brat, it is fine to cultivate in closed doors, but you didn’t need to kick out the two ladies.”\n I was stunned and looked towards Mu Zi and Hai Shui. Mu Zi rolled her eyes at me. “Let’s stop talking, didn’t you need to give them the divine wills?”\n Before walking over to the brothers, I released Mu Zi and Hai Shui from my embrace. “My injuries have completely recovered. How about you guys?”\n Zhan Hu brandished his fist. “We’re fine already. After receiving the divine instruments, our recovery power has become much greater ”\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-12-chapter-13","bookId":1498,"book":{"id":1498,"title":"Child of Light","description":"The lazy Zhang Gong decides to learn light magic, a magic often ridiculed as useless for it’s defensive nature.
