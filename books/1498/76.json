At the beginning they thought I had walked in the opposite direction. It was only after I explained that I had to go find someone that they understood\\n\\n I promised Big Brother Zhan Hu that after my business in Xiuda was over, I would first find him and tell him about the circumstances of his family. Although we had to travel a farther distance, they didn’t say anything.\\n\\n On the journey, I felt that they only came to sightsee. Although Xing Ao and Gao De were each nearly thirty years old, both acted like children. And whenever Dong Ri found something new, he immediately talked about it with others. Likewise the always earnest Xiu Si had relaxed very much.\\n\\n After an unceasing trudge, we finally arrived at our destination. Just as we entered the mountain, we encountered some trouble. Twenty or so people jumped down from the trees and surrounded us. Their boss yelled, “Halt! Is this somewhere you guys should be going? Carefully hand over your money and afterwards turn back. Otherwise you can’t blame uncle for killing you.”\\n\\n It seems that we’ve run into Big Brother’s subordinates. I walked in front to take a look. Isn’t this the guy that was at Big Brother’s side from last time? I didn’t know if he still recognized me. Without waiting for me to say anything, he loudly said, “Ah! Is that Second Boss?”\\n\\n Shocked I violently fell and said, “When did I become the Second Boss?”\\n\\n That bandit said, “Ah, It really is you, Second Boss.” Calling me this, when I looked at everyone, they suspiciously glanced at me; I quickly grew faint. Please don’t think of me as some bandit leader.\\n\\n “Don’t call me the Second Boss. Is big brother Zhan Hu well?”\\n\\n “You’re the sworn brother of our Boss, so of course you’re the Second Boss. The Boss talks about you often daily. You’ve returned now so hurry up and go. Brothers, open up a path for the Second Boss.”\\n\\n What happened afterwards is unclear. We just followed the twenty or so people into the mountain while I explained to everyone the events through which I came to know Zhan Hu. They all wanted to quickly meet this Heaven Knight who could match my martial arts.\\n\\n Just as we arrived into the village, Zhan Hu came out and welcomed us. It seems that his scouts reported truly fast. I quickly rushed up and stopped to embrace him. I emotionally said, “Big Brother, I’ve returned.”\\n\\n “Good, good, good. It’s good that you’ve returned. Go. We’ll talk at home.”\\n\\n After returning to Zhan Hu’s thatched cottage, I introduced everyone to him. Big brother was extremely happy to meet others from his hometown so he brought out a scrumptious feast in our honor.\\n\\n At the wine table, seeing Big Brother’s impatient expression, I knew what he wanted to ask. I smiled and said, “Big brother, your house is in good condition. After we finished eating, we’ll talk in detail.” Zhan Hu immediately calmed down.\\n\\n During this meal, everyone was in very high spirits. Everyone called Zhan Hu, Big Brother. Today Zhan Hu intentionally drank less. I also only tasted it.\\n\\n Night time. Everyone had already entered into the land of pleasant dreams. Zhan Hu and I went to a small hill. On top of the hill I began explaining the events that happened in the short period of time I had been away. He was extraordinarily happy when he heard that his second brother already reached the rank of a Radiant Knight and he was very anxious when he heard I received a serious injury.\\n\\n “Big Brother, Big Brother Shan Yun said they really miss you. All along they haven’t blamed you. Will you return home earlier? He promised for the time being that he won’t speak of you to His Majesty the Prince. I feel like you should return. It has already been many years.\\n\\n Zhan Hu sighed and said, “I really should go back and take a look. Father is so old now. This unfilial son mustn’t let that old man grieve any longer. Once you’ve obtained the Holy Sword, I’ll go back.”\\n\\n “Ah? Big Brother, you want to go too? You don’t need to. You should immediately return to Xiuda.”\\n\\n “Foolish brat, is the Holy Sword really that easy to obtain? You are certain to come across danger after danger. If I don’t accompany you, how would I feel at ease? You don’t need to urge me, as I intend to.”\\n\\n “Big brother……..” I emotionally embraced his thick and broad shoulders speechlessly.\\n\\n When we departed the next day, we had a new member among our ranks. Everybody held Zhan Hu in extremely high esteem since he was my big brother. Thus, we set off on a long journey of learning. Originally it was supposed to be a one man journey, but now it has turned into a journey of six people. I don’t know if this would go against Teacher Di’s intention but everybody was too enthusiastic for me to refuse them. I had already tried to persuade Big Brother to stay and lead his village. However, his answer was too good. He said that in these last few years the village had saved up not a small amount of money so he would tell them to not go out “hunting” while he was gone. What else could I say to him?\\n\\n Like that, we head straight to the Kena province of the Dalu Kingdom. This was the only clue that Teacher Di had given me. The route was not short at all. The Kingdom of Dalu was on the other side of Xiuda. In other words, we have to pass through the entire Kingdom of Xiuda. When we set out, everyone picked a fine horse from Zhan Hu’s bandit village.\\n\\n Apart from me, they were all knights, each capable of expertly controlling a horse. I have never rode on a horse before, yet they gave me the tallest, strongest horse. Just as we had started, without even traveling far, my whole body ached. Do I use battle spirit to protect my body? I could no longer stand it and decided this time to learn how to ride a horse. Following everyone’s continuous guidance, I can now barely keep up and I no longer feel tired. I originally thought of talking about letting me use teleportation magic to follow them, but everyone unanimously disagreed. That is why I had no choice but to suffer through this bitter hardship.\\n\\n After nearly two months of trudging along, we finally arrived at the border of the Dalu Kingdom. I looked at the map. This province was still 400 kilometers away. In front of us should be the Lunwa city.\\n\\n I faced everyone and said, “Once we’ve entered the city ahead of us we’ll rest properly for two days. This short period of madly rushing forward has nearly exhausted me to death.”\\n\\n Xing Ao replied with a smile, “Ah, the magnificent magister is so exhausted. What a pity that you don’t know wind magic, otherwise you could just fly.”\\n\\n Xing Ao’s words reminded me of something. As we all continued walking towards Lunwa city, I asked Big Brother Zhan Hu, “I heard from my teacher once that once your martial skill reaches a certain level, you’ll be able to use your battle spirit to fly. Is that true?”\\n\\n Zhan Hu replied to me in astonishment, “I didn’t expect you to even know this. It’s possible to fly using battle spirit, but you need to have the strength of at least a Heaven Knight. This is also the origin of the name Heaven Knight.”\\n\\n I excitedly asked, “Then you and Xiu Si can fly?”\\n\\n Xiu Si interrupted from the side saying, “That’s right. But I can only fly about five kilometers before my battle spirit is exhausted. Big Brother Zhan Hu should be able to fly a bit longer.”\\n\\n “It’s not that much further.” Big Brother Zhan Hu modestly said.\\n\\n I yearningly said, “I truly envy you. Ah! It really feels nice to fly in the sky.”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-3-chapter-32","bookId":1498,"book":{"id":1498,"title":"Child of Light","description":"The lazy Zhang Gong decides to learn light magic, a magic often ridiculed as useless for it’s defensive nature.
