The most sensitive part in the human body was the brain. Even with my cultivation, I wouldn’t casually surge magic powers or battle spirit towards it. There must be a reason for her action, but it was extremely risky. A rictus of pain gradually formed on Xiao Rou’s face as white smoke was slowly released from her head, giving off a burned smell. It couldn’t be that her head was burning up right? It shouldn’t happen; Xiao Rou’s cultivation was gentle in nature, so she shouldn’t have any offensive powers. Even when blending her powers with mine, it shouldn’t be possible for Xiao Rou’s head to be set alight. Xiao Rou’s expression showed intensifying pain. Bean-sized sweat drops that were gold in color, flowed down her face, giving off a pungent smell. I quickly placed a small defensive barrier around my nose to filter the scent coming over. The boundary around us slowly filled up with white smoke. The situation here had attracted everyone’s attention. Zhan Hu and the rest instinctively formed a protective circle with the boundary as its center while Mu Zi and Ke Lun Duo stayed at the outer perimeter, watching us. Mu Zi asked, “What are they doing? Why is there so much smoke?” No one had ill feelings towards Mu Zi due to my relationship with her. Zhan Hu replied, “Xiao Rou seems to be cultivating, and Zhang Gong is protecting her in the process. You can just rest at the side. Once they’re done with training, we will have our meal.” Ke Lun Duo looked at the boundary and exclaimed, “Zhang Gong treats that demon fox really well. He’s even using his divine power to protect her. That demon fox should be making a new breakthrough.” Once he said that, Xiao Rou, who was in the boundary, suddenly cried out mournfully. She spread her limbs as she floated up into the sky within the barrier. Her clothing had disintegrated completely and all the hairs on her body had instantly turned into ash. Startled, I hastily shot my power into her body, which resulted to her being suspended in mid air, while sensing the circulation of powers in her body. Xiao Rou abruptly opened her eyes and two cold light rays shot out like lightning. When I saw its sharpness, my heart shuddered. I knew that she had made a qualitative leap in strength. Xiao Rou called out, “Master, I’ve succeeded!” Upon saying that, she dashed towards me, but stopped when she was a metre away from me. After looking at the golden fluid on her body, she frowned. I smiled as I gently brandished Sukard’s staff, creating an enormous waterball that slowly moved towards her. When it was in front of her, it suddenly turned into a whirlpool that covered her. With this method, I could help wash the dirt off her body and also test the standards her powers had reached. Xiao Rou was initially shocked, but she quickly leaped into the whirlpool. Unexpectedly, she didn’t need to change back to her original form when faced with an advanced water spell. Under our astonishment, the dirt on her body gradually cleared, revealing a lustrous, pure white and delicate figure. Xiao Rou cheered out as she dashed towards me and wound around me like an octopus. My entire body stiffened from the intense stimulation. I immediately cast a protective barrier around my body and gently pushed her away. After I dispersed the boundary around me, I took out a large mage robe from the spatial pocket and covered Xiao Rou’s body with it. The slightly pale Mu Zi gazed at me with eyes full of sadness. Xiao Rou excitedly told me, “Master, I’ve finally evolved into a nine tailed demon fox. Take a look at this.” Upon saying that, a light flashed, and she appeared in her original form. The fur on her body had turned into a beautiful silver colour with nine tails at her back. I knew that Xiao Rou wouldn\u0027t be any weaker than the cyclops we had fought previously now that she had become an A-ranked demon beast. I took out a shirt and a pair of pants from the spatial pocket. “Congratulations Xiao Rou, you’ve finally evolved!” Xiao Rou changed back to her human form. However, the color of her long hair which reached to her butt had become a blend of silver and ash grey. She quickly put on the clothes that I had given her. With her sparkling and almost translucent skin, she wasn’t inferior to Hai Shui when it came to beauty. Her looks were only slightly inferior to Mu Zi’s. I looked at everyone’s stunned expressions and mischievously chided them, “You bunch of lechers, what are you doing? Never seen a beauty before?” Jian Shan instantly moved over and sized Xiao Rou up before he said with a smile, “Xiao Rou, you really are too beautiful. Wanna be my girlfriend?” Xiao Rou’s face flushed before she replied, displeased, “Big Brother Jian Shan, what do you think you’re doing? I’m a demon beast, not a human.” Jian Shan scratched his head. “Aiya! I’ve forgotten about that. I’m really sorry.” His words made everyone laugh. “It isn’t impossible. There’s a possibility that Xiao Rou can become a human. Jian Shan, if you’re serious, I can try to help you.” I said with a smile. Jian Shan elatedly replied, “Really? That’s great! Will she look the same as she does now after transmuting into human?” My mood dampened. “If you only like Xiao Rou’s looks, I won’t help you since I’m responsible for taking care of her.” Jian Shan replied apologetically, “How can I be that kind of person? I like Xiao Rou’s personality.” Zhan Hu teasingly said, “You don’t mind that she’s a demon beast? Will your elders agree?” Jian Shan gave an embarrassed smile, but didn’t say more. Xiao Rou’s eyes suddenly reddened and she stood behind me with her head lowered. I knew that she must be upset; even a demon beast would want someone who would love her. Moreover, Xiao Rou was a demon beast with intelligence. I consoled her, saying, “Xiao Rou, I’ll definitely help you turn into a human and find your ideal partner. How’s that?” Xiao Rou clung on my arm and said, crying, “Xiao Rou doesn’t want to be with anyone, nor does she want to turn into a human. Xiao Rou just wants to follow and serve Master for her entire life.” I smiled but didn’t mind. I just patted her head to console her. Dong Ri suddenly punched Jian Shan. “You’ve offended Xiao Rou. Hmph! You won’t get any food today as punishment.” Jian Shan looked awkwardly at me and didn’t refute Dong Ri’s words since he knew that his previous action had hurt Xiao Rou. I remedied the situation by saying, “That should be enough. Everyone must be hungry. Let’s have our meal first. Big Brother Zhan Hu, how’s your cooking skills today?” Zhan Hu arrogantly replied, “I’m an old-timer and top expert when it comes to cooking. I guarantee that whatever I cook will make you bite your tongue. Let’s go.” Big Brother’s cooking skill really was extraordinary. Even if he didn’t have any ready- made seasoning, the demon beast meat was well seasoned so it was still extremely delicious. It even managed to cheer up the melancholic Mu Zi. Xiao Rou was so engrossed in eating that she disregarded everything other than having her meal. Jian Shan had given her the best part of the demon beast from his share to make up for his mistake. She had a demon beast’s leg in her left hand and a piece of the demon’s chest meat in her right, eating cheerfully. Seeing that all these people with different ideals got together in eating the delicacies, I chuckled. ‘Who cares what tomorrow will be like? We must be proud to be joyous in life. Let’s eat!” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-9-chapter-42","bookId":1498,"book":{"id":1498,"title":"Child of Light","description":"The lazy Zhang Gong decides to learn light magic, a magic often ridiculed as useless for it’s defensive nature.
