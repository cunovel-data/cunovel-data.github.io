The silence lengthened. “I wish you’d kept me in the loop,” he said finally. “I intended to. I went to your office, but you’d gone home to sleep, and I remembered how tired you said you were. I didn’t want to interrupt your rest before . . . you know, tonight.” Another pause, longer, hung between us. So much was packed into that one little word, tonight. The first night of the full moon. Kane’s transformation into a hellhound. The Night Hag on the hunt for me. “All right,” Kane said. “Get me up to speed now. Tell me everything that happened since I last saw you.” “I got a tip about where Pryce and the Old Ones were holding Tina.” “A tip from whom?” “Butterfly.” “That damn guilt demon,” he growled. “And you trusted it?” “The tip was good. I’ve told you before—Eidolons can’t lie.” “But they can manipulate. You told me that, too.” It was true. And that was exactly what I’d been afraid of—that Butterfly was leading me into a trap set by Pryce. The next time that Eidolon dared to show its damn face, I’d kill it. No truces, no niceness. Just one dead demon. “As I said, the tip was good. And Tina’s life was at stake.” Fear gripped me. “Do you know what happened to her? Is she safe?” “There’s been nothing about her in the news. Details are sketchy. So far, all the reporting is focusing on the SWAT team casualties. And you.” And me. I wished finding out what had happened was as easy as turning on the news. “All, right, so the demon gave you this tip. Then what?” “After I stopped at your office, I checked out the site. I talked to a neighbor. I called Daniel, and he organized the raid. He couldn’t be on site because of the virus threat.” “Wait, what virus threat?” There had been nothing on the news about the factory being a suspected plague virus lab. The authorities might cover up that information to prevent a panic—I’d seen them do that before. But they’d also have come up with a reason to keep humans away. According to Kane’s description, and confirmed by the newspaper photo on Kaysi’s table, cops and journalists swarmed over the site. So the biohazard team hadn’t found any virus. My eye on the clock, I resumed my narrative. “Daniel emphasized I was there as a consultant—not to fight. So after I debriefed the team, I waited in the van, until I heard that scream.” Kane didn’t speak, but I knew what he was thinking as clearly as if the phone could broadcast his thoughts. He was thinking that once again, I had to go rushing in. And yes, he was right. If someone was in trouble and I could help, I did have to go rushing in. It’s part of who I am. But today, “who I am” felt like a wide-open question. Had I helped those cops? Or had I sent them to their deaths? Even worse, had I been the one to kill them? “I saw Pryce,” I said. “During the raid?” “After. When I blacked out I ended up in Limbo somehow, and Pryce was there, waiting. He . . . he told me the Destroyer possesses me now. That its power makes me kill without caring what I destroy. He said that’s what happened to the SWAT team.” At that moment, the full horror of Pryce’s claim hit me, really hit me, for the first time. “He said I killed them, Kane. And he said I’ll keep killing.” My voice couldn’t make it through the last sentence without cracking. For so long, I’d fought the Destroyer, pushed down the rage it created in me. But the Hellion had grown stronger, and I was so tired. Maybe Pryce had a point. Maybe some part of me did want to quit struggling and give in. I stifled a sob. My greatest fear—and it was coming true. “Vicky, listen to me. I know you. I’ve seen the Destroyer’s hold on you, yes. But I’ve also seen how hard you fight. How deep your reserves are. You are stronger. Do you hear me? You are stronger.” The certainty in his voice, his unshakable belief in me, touched me inside. Something small and tight stirred, like a long-buried seed groping toward a hint of warmth in the frozen ground. I wasn’t sure Kane was right. In fact, I greatly feared he was wrong. But he believed his words, and that meant something. It meant a lot. “Thank you,” I whispered. “I want so badly to hold you right now. This wasn’t how I pictured saying good-bye, not today.” The frustration in his voice shifted into something else. “But you stay strong, my love. Stay strong, and . . . and tonight I’ll do my best to do the same.” I nodded, tears running down my face, knowing he couldn’t see and yet knowing he understood. 35 BEFORE WE HUNG UP, KANE SAID MAB WANTED TO SPEAK with me. “Mab’s there?” Surprise gave me back my voice. “I’m at your apartment. I figured you’d get in touch if you could—call me or your home phone, or contact Mab using that dream-phone thing you do. However you managed it, I wanted to be there.” I didn’t have words for the feelings that swelled in my chest. So instead, I asked him to put Mab on. “We probably won’t talk again,” he said. Tonight was the full moon, and he had to travel to the werewolf retreat in Princeton. “I’ll leave this phone with your aunt. And Vicky . . .” His voice wavered. “Please know that, whatever happens, I love you.” “I love you, too,” I whispered. “Whatever happens.” A moment later, Mab’s brisk voice took over the line. “Victory, child, are you all right?” “I am.” I cleared my throat. Now wasn’t the time to give way to mushy feelings. “I’m recovering from a shift. Vicky Vaughn went into the Old Ones’ hideout, but a feral cat came running out.” “It must have been a desperate situation.” “It was.” I briefly repeated what I’d told Kane, bringing Mab up to speed on yesterday’s events. “A kind animal lover gave me a saucer of milk and a bed for the night. And this person barely blinked an eye when I shifted back to my usual form.” “Can you stay out of sight until this evening?” “I’ll manage.” I wasn’t going to take advantage of Kaysi’s hospitality—after all, I was a fugitive from justice. I’d find another place to hide. Boston had no shortage of empty buildings. “See that you do. I’ve contacted the Night Hag. You’re to give her the falcon tonight.” “Where?” “Your photo was all over the news by late afternoon, so I knew the exchange couldn’t take place here. And, needless to say, the witches your Mr. Kane hired for protection are suddenly unavailable. At any rate, I asked Mallt-y-Nos to suggest a spot. We’re meeting there at midnight. Do you know a place called . . .” In the pause I could hear papers rustle. “Fenway Park?” “The baseball stadium?” “Oh, is that what it is? I assumed it was some sort of green space.” Green space. If that’s what you want to call the Green Monster, the green-painted, thirty-seven-foot-high wall that flanks left field. I flipped through the paper. There wasn’t a game tonight. But how were we supposed to get inside? We’d figure it out as we went. “Can you find your way there?” I asked. “Certainly.” Mab’s tone could have been either amusement or annoyance. It was hard to tell without seeing her expression. “If you need a map, Juliet can print one out from her computer.” “For heaven’s sake, child, don’t worry about me. Take care of yourself. Rest if you can. Meditate. Focus on staying pure; it will give you strength. I’ll meet you at Fenway Park at eleven.” I still didn’t like it. If Mab got lost, or if I ran into a problem, neither of us would have a way to contact the other. The dream phone wasn’t an option while we were both awake. “I really think you should have Juliet print you out a map. Tell her to mark Gate A on Yawkey Way. I’ll meet you there.” “All right.” This time, Mab’s sigh made it clear she was more than a little annoyed by my concerns. “Although honestly, you’d do well to remember that I’ve had three centuries of experience in getting from one place to another.” Her tone softened, but there was steel beneath it. “And Victory . . . do listen to what Mr. Kane said. The Destroyer is strong, but you are stronger. You can draw on that strength whenever you choose, but you must believe in it. Ponder that today.” I promised her I would, and we said good-bye. “Thanks, Kaysi,” I called down the hallway as I hung up the phone. She appeared a moment later, a bundle of clothes in her arms. “I hope these will fit,” she said, cocking her head as she inspected me. “You’re a little taller than I am. Skinnier, too.” “They’ll be fine. I really appreciate it.” “I have to get ready for work. Feel free to eat some breakfast and make more calls. After I’m gone, you can take a shower, grab a nap on the couch—whatever you need. Just be sure to lock the door if you leave.” “If there’s anything I can do to repay you . . .” “Don’t worry about that. Just do whatever’s necessary to find out what happened. When I see in the paper that you’ve cleared your name, I’ll be proud I helped.” Suddenly, I couldn’t think of anything to say. I held out my arms to accept the stack of clothes. “Good luck,” Kaysi said. She turned and went back down the hall. A door closed, and the shower started running. A box of cereal stood on the table. I poured myself a bowl and refreshed my coffee. There was milk in the fridge, of course. Kaysi kept a good supply for any hungry cats that might wander by.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hellhound-deadtown-5/page-53.html","bookId":2613,"book":{"id":2613,"title":"Hellhound (Deadtown #5)","description":"Storyline: Hellhound (Deadtown #5) They call it Deadtown: the city’s quarantined section for its inhuman and undead residents.
