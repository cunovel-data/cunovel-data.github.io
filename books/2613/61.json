Using my hand, she picked up the pink rubber glove. Her voice spoke in my mind. I will honor your wishes—for now—taking this glove as a signal you wish to have this body to yourself. But it is only through my courtesy. The time is coming when, whatever either of us wishes, we must work together.\\n\\n My sparkling fingers still tingled with power. As I pulled the glove over them, I knew I was doing so only with Ceridwen’s permission. The goddess’s voice faded, yet her words were distinct. Two more gifts have I given you today: your privacy and the child’s life. Do not take them for granted.\\n\\n Again, I felt the threat that laced her tone.\\n\\n I didn’t realize how badly my hands were shaking until Kane took both of them in his. “Are you all right?” he asked.\\n\\n Was I?\\n\\n A goddess had taken up residence in my body and was keeping count of the “gifts” she’d bestowed upon me—each one, I was sure, with miles of strings attached.\\n\\n A Hellion, its essence still burned into my arm, laid claim to me.\\n\\n The Old Ones remained at large. Tina was missing. Mab’s bloodstone had shattered. The war between the realms still loomed.\\n\\n Yet somehow, with Kane’s hands holding mine, I could look into his eyes and believe that nothing was insurmountable. No trace of tortured hellhound lingered in those gray eyes. In them, I saw intelligence and loyalty, steadiness and strength. I saw belief in me. I saw love.\\n\\n Whatever was coming, we’d face it together. How many times had he told me that? But now I could see it. And I think he saw the same thing.\\n\\n “Yeah,” I said. “I’m all right.”\\n\\n And if there was any hint of contradiction—a whisper in my mind, a twinge in my demon mark—I didn’t pay attention.\\n\\n Kane put his arm around me. Together, we watched my father and my niece soar through the blue suburban sky \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hellhound-deadtown-5/page-61.html","bookId":2613,"book":{"id":2613,"title":"Hellhound (Deadtown #5)","description":"Storyline: Hellhound (Deadtown #5) \\n They call it Deadtown: the city’s quarantined section for its inhuman and undead residents. Most humans stay far from its borders—but Victory Vaughn, Boston’s only professional demon slayer, isn’t exactly human… \\n Boston’s zombies have suddenly become inexplicably violent—horror movie-style—resulting in a catastrophic all-out battle against humans. More troubling to Vicky is that she’s had dreams and visions of herself fighting alongside the demons. At least, she hopes they’re just visions—otherwise, that puts her on the front lines of the wrong side of the war. \\n Vicky’s not surprised to discover that Pryce, her demi-demon cousin and loathed adversary, is behind the outbreak of the zombie plague, having formed an unholy pact with the Old Ones. Now, as the violence escalates and alliances shift, Vicky knows she’s the only one who can stop the plague.
