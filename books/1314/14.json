{"id":23984,"no":14,"title":"THE BROWNIES\u0027 CANDY-PULL.","content":"ONE evening, while the Brownies sat Enjoying free and friendly chat, Some on the trees, some on the ground, And others perched on fences round— One Brownie, rising in his place, Addressed the band with beaming face. The listeners gathered with delight Around the member, bold and bright, To hear him tell of scenes he\u0027d spied While roaming through the country wide. \"Last eve,\" said he, \"to shun the blast, Behind a cottage fence I passed. While there, I heard a merry rout, And as the yard was dark without, I crawled along through weeds and grass, Through melon-vines and broken glass, Until I might, unnoticed, win A glimpse of all the sport within. At length, below the window-pane, To reach the sill I stretched in vain; But, thanks to my inquiring mind And sundry bricks, I chanced to find The facts I can relate in full About that lively candy-pull. \"An hour or more, I well believe, I stood, their actions to perceive, With elbows resting on the sill, And nose against the window still. I watched them closely at their fun, And learned how everything was done. The younger members took the lead, And carried on the work with speed. With nimble feet they ran about From place to place, with laugh and shout; But older heads looked on the while, And cheered the youngsters with a smile, And gave advice in manner kind To guide the inexperienced mind. They placed the sugar in a pot, And stirred it round till boiling hot; Then rolled and worked it in their hands, And stretched it out in shining bands, Until it reached across the floor, From mantel-piece to kitchen door. \"These eyes of mine for many a night Have not beheld a finer sight. To pull the candy was the part Of some who seemed to know the art. The moon had slipped behind the hill, And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will; But still, with nose against the pane, I kept my place through wind and rain. There, perched upon the shaky pile, With bated breath I gazed the while. I watched them with the sharpest sight That I might tell the tale aright; For all the active youngsters there Appeared to have of work their share. Some put fresh sugar in the pot, Some kept the fire blazing hot, And worked away as best they could To keep the stove well filled with wood. Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill, At moving here and there at will, Would have to \u0027lively\u0027 be and \u0027tear Around\u0027 to beat those children there! Some cut it up, more passed it round, While others ate it by the pound!\" At this, a murmur of surprise On every side began to rise; Then smiles o\u0027er every visage flitted, As wide as cheeks and ears permitted, That told what train of thought had sped At once through every Brownie\u0027s head— A thought of pleasure near at hand That well would suit the cunning band. THE Brownies act without delay When new ideas cross their way, And soon one raised a finger small And close attention gained from all. They crowded near with anxious glance To learn what scheme he could advance— What methods mention or employ To bring about the promised joy. Said he: \"A vacant house is near. The owner leaves it every year For several months, and pleasure seeks On ocean waves or mountain peaks. The range is there against the wall, The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all, While cans of syrup may be found In every grocer\u0027s store around. The Brownie must be dull and tame, And scarce deserves to bear the name, Who will not join with heart and hand To carry out a scheme so grand.\" Another cried: \"When to his bed The sun to-morrow stoops his head, Again we\u0027ll muster in full force And to that building turn our course.\" Next eve they gained the street at last That through the silent city passed; And soon they paused, their eyes they raised And on the vacant mansion gazed. In vain the miser hides his store, In vain the merchant bars his door, In vain the locksmith changes keys— The Brownies enter where they please. Through iron doors, through gates of brass, And walls of stone they safely pass, And smile to think how soon they can Upset the studied schemes of man. Within that house, without delay, Behind the guide they worked their way, More happy far and full of glee Than was the owner, out at sea. The whale, the shark, or fish that flies Had less attraction for his eyes Than had the shining candy-balls For Brownies, swarming through his halls. Soon coal was from the cellar brought And kindling wood came, quick as thought; Then pots and pans came rattling in And syrup sweet, in cans of tin. Just where the syrup had been found It matters not. It was around. The cunning band was soon possessed Of full supplies and of the best; Next tablespoons of silver fine In every hand appeared to shine, And ladles long, of costly ware, That had been laid away with care. No sooner was the syrup hot Than some around the kettle got, And dabbed away in eager haste To be the first to get a taste. Then some were scalded when the spoon Let fall its contents all too soon, And gave the tongue too warm a mess To carry without some distress. Then steps were into service brought That dancing-masters never taught, And smothered cries and swinging hand Would wake the wonder of the band. And when the candy boiled until It could be pulled and hauled at will, Take every shape or twist, and seem As free as fancy in a dream, The busy, happy-hearted crew Enjoyed the moments as they flew. The Brownies in the building stayed And candy ate as fast as made. But when at length the brightening sky Gave warning they must homeward fly, They quickly sought the open air And had but little time to spare. The shortest way, as often found, Was o\u0027er the roughest piece of ground, Where rocks as large as houses lay All scattered round in wild array. Some covered o\u0027er with clinging vines, Some bearing up gigantic pines, Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast, For centuries had stood the blast. But over all the rugged ground The Brownies passed with lightsome bound, Now jumping clear from block to block, Now sliding down the shelving rock, Or cheering on the lagging kind Who here and there would fall behind. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76906.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
