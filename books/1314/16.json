{"id":23986,"no":16,"title":"THE BROWNIES\u0027 FANCY BALL.","content":"IT was the season of the year When people, dressed in fancy gear, From every quarter hurried down And filled the largest halls in town; And there to flute and fiddle sweet Went through their sets with lively feet. The Brownies were not slow to note That fun indeed was now afloat; And ere the season passed away, Of longest night and shortest day, They looked about to find a hall Where they could hold their fancy ball. Said one: \"A room can soon be found Where all the band can troop around; But want of costumes, much I fear, Will bar our pleasure all the year.\" Another said: \"One moment wait! My eyes have not been shut of late,— Don\u0027t show a weak and hopeless mind Because your knowledge is confined,— For I\u0027m prepared to take the band To costumes, ready to the hand, Of every pattern, new or old: The kingly robes, with chains of gold, The cloak and plume of belted knight, The pilgrim\u0027s hat and stockings white, The dresses for the ladies fair, The gems and artificial hair, The soldier-suits in blue and red, The turban for the Tartar\u0027s head, All can be found where I will lead, If friends are willing to proceed.\" Those knowing best the Brownie way Will know there was no long delay, Ere to the town he made a break With all the Brownies in his wake. It mattered not that roads were long, That hills were high or winds were strong; Soon robes were found on peg and shelf, And each one chose to suit himself. The costumes, though a world too wide, And long enough a pair to hide, Were gathered in with skill and care, That showed the tailor\u0027s art was there. Then out they started for the hall, In fancy trappings one and all; Some clad like monks in sable gowns; And some like kings; and more like clowns; And Highlanders, with naked knees; And Turks, with turbans like a cheese; While many members in the line Were dressed like ladies fair and fine, And swept along the polished floor A train that reached a yard or more. By happy chance some laid their hand Upon the outfit of a band; The horns and trumpets took the lead, Supported well by string and reed; And violins, that would have made A mansion for the rogues that played, With flute and clarionet combined In music of the gayest kind. In dances wild and strange to see They passed the hours in greatest glee; Familiar figures all were lost In flowing robes that round them tossed; And well-known faces hid behind Queer masks that quite confused the mind. The queen and clown, a loving pair, Enjoyed a light fandango there; While solemn monks of gentle heart, In jig and scalp-dance took their part. The grand salute, with courteous words, The bobbing up and down, like birds, The lively skip, the stately glide, The double turn, and twist aside Were introduced in proper place And carried through with ease and grace. So great the pleasure proved to all, Too long they tarried in the hall, And morning caught them on the fly, Ere they could put the garments by! Then dodging out in great dismay, By walls and stumps they made their way; And not until the evening\u0027s shade Were costumes in their places laid.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76908.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
