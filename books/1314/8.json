{"id":23978,"no":8,"title":"THE BROWNIES\u0027 GARDEN.","content":"ONE night, as spring began to show In buds above and blades below, The Brownies reached a garden square That seemed in need of proper care. Said one, \"Neglected ground like this Must argue some one most remiss, Or beds and paths would here be found Instead of rubbish scattered round. Old staves, and boots, and woolen strings, With bottles, bones, and wire-springs, Are quite unsightly things to see Where tender plants should sprouting be. This work must be progressing soon, If blossoms are to smile in June.\" A second said, \"Let all give heed: On me depend to find the seed. For, thanks to my foreseeing mind, To merchants\u0027 goods we\u0027re not confined. Last autumn, when the leaves grew sere And birds sought regions less severe, One night through gardens fair I sped, And gathered seeds from every bed; Then placed them in a hollow tree, Where still they rest. So trust to me To bring supplies, while you prepare The mellow garden-soil with care.\" [40] Another cried, \"While some one goes To find the shovels, rakes, and hoes, That in the sheds are stowed away, We\u0027ll use this plow as best we may. Our arms, united at the chain, Will not be exercised in vain, But, as if colts were in the trace, We\u0027ll make it dance around the place. I know how deep the share should go, And how the sods to overthrow. So not a patch of ground the size Of this old cap, when flat it lies, But shall attentive care receive, And be improved before we leave.\" Then some to guide the plow began, Others the walks and beds to plan. And soon they gazed with anxious eyes For those who ran for seed-supplies. But, when they came, one had his say, And thus explained the long delay: \"A woodchuck in the tree had made His bed just where the seeds were laid. We wasted half an hour at least In striving to dislodge the beast; Until at length he turned around, Then, quick as thought, without a sound, And ere he had his bearings got, The rogue was half across the lot.\" Then seed was sown in various styles, In circles, squares, and single files; While here and there, in central parts, They fashioned diamonds, stars, and hearts, Some using rake, some plying hoe, Some making holes where seed should go; While some laid garden tools aside And to the soil their hands applied. To stakes and racks more were assigned, That climbing-vines support might find. Cried one, \"Here, side by side, will stand The fairest flowers in the land. The thrifty bees for miles around Ere long will seek this plot of ground, And be surprised to find each morn New blossoms do each bed adorn. And in their own peculiar screed Will bless the hands that sowed the seed.\" And while that night they labored there, The cunning rogues had taken care With sticks and strings to nicely frame In line the letters of their name. That when came round the proper time For plants to leaf and vines to climb, The Brownies would remembered be, If people there had eyes to see. But morning broke (as break it will Though one\u0027s awake or sleeping still), And then the seeds on every side The hurried Brownies scattered wide. BROWNIE Along the road and through the lane They pattered on the ground like rain, Where Brownies, as away they flew, Both right and left full handfuls threw, And children often halted there To pick the blossoms, sweet and fair, That sprung like daisies from the mead Where fleeing Brownies flung the seed. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76900.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
