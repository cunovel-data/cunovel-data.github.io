{"id":23980,"no":10,"title":"THE BROWNIES IN THE SWIMMING-SCHOOL.","content":"WHILE Brownies passed along the street, Commenting on the summer\u0027s heat That wrapped the city day and night, A swimming-bath appeared in sight. Said one: \"Of all the sights we\u0027ve found, Since we commenced to ramble round, This seems to better suit the band Than anything, however grand. We\u0027ll rest awhile and find our way Inside the place without delay, And those who understand the art, Can knowledge to the rest impart; For every one should able be, To swim, in river, lake, or sea. We never know how soon we may, See some one sinking in dismay,— And then, to have the power to save A comrade from a watery grave, Will be a blessing sure to give Us joy the longest day we live.\" The doors soon opened through the power That lay in Brownie hands that hour. When once within the fun began, As here and there they quickly ran; Some up the stairs made haste to go, Some into dressing-rooms below, In bathing-trunks to reappear And plunge into the water clear; Some from the spring-board leaping fair Would turn a somersault in air; More to the bottom like a stone, Would sink as soon as left alone, While others after trial brief Could float as buoyant as a leaf. Some all their time to others gave Assisting them to ride the wave, Explaining how to catch the trick, Both how to strike and how to kick; And still keep nose above the tide, That lungs with air might be supplied. Thus diving in and climbing out, Or splashing round with laugh and shout, The happy band in water played As long as Night her scepter swayed. They heard the clocks in chapel towers Proclaim the swiftly passing hours. But when the sun looked from his bed To tint the eastern sky with red, In haste the frightened Brownies threw Their clothes about them and withdrew. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76902.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
