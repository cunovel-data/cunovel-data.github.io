{"id":23988,"no":18,"title":"THE BROWNIES\u0027 TALLY-HO.","content":"AS shades of evening closed around, The Brownies, from some wooded ground, Looked out to view with staring eye A Tally-Ho, then passing by. Around the park they saw it roll, Now sweeping round a wooded knoll, Now rumbling o\u0027er an arching bridge, Now hid behind a rocky ridge, Now wheeling out again in view To whirl along some avenue. They hardly could restrain a shout When they observed the grand turnout. The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud, The prancing horses, and the crowd Of people perched so high in air Pleased every wondering Brownie there. Said one: \"A rig like this we see Would suit the Brownies to a T! And I\u0027m the one, here let me say, To put such pleasures in our way: I know the very place to go To-night to find a Tally-Ho. It never yet has borne a load Of happy hearts along the road; But, bright and new in every part \u0027Tis ready for an early start. The horses in the stable stand With harness ready for the hand; If all agree, we\u0027ll take a ride For miles across the country wide.\" Another said: \"The plan is fine; You well deserve to head the line; But, on the road, the reins I\u0027ll draw; I know the way to \u0027gee\u0027 and \u0027haw,\u0027 And how to turn a corner round, And still keep wheels upon the ground.\" Another answered: \"No, my friend, We\u0027ll not on one alone depend; But three or four the reins will hold, That horses may be well controlled. The curves are short, the hills are steep, The horses fast, and ditches deep, And at some places half the band May have to take the lines in hand.\" That night, according to their plan, The Brownies to the stable ran; Through swamps they cut to reach the place, And cleared the fences in their race As lightly as the swallow flies To catch its morning meal supplies. Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled, And stylish shoes completely spoiled, Across the roughest hill or rock They scampered like a frightened flock, Now o\u0027er inclosures knee and knee, With equal speed they clambered free And soon with faces all aglow They crowded round the Tally-Ho; But little time they stood to stare Or smile upon the strange affair. As many hands make labor light, And active fingers win the fight, Each busy Brownie played his part, And soon \u0027t was ready for the start. But ere they took their seats to ride By more than one the horns were tried, Each striving with tremendous strain The most enlivening sound to gain, And prove he had a special right To blow the horn throughout the night. Though some were crowded in a seat, And some were forced to keep their feet Or sit upon another\u0027s lap, And some were hanging to a strap, With merry laugh and ringing shout, And tooting horns, they drove about. A dozen miles, perhaps, or more, The lively band had traveled o\u0027er, Commenting on their happy lot And keeping horses on the trot, When, as they passed a stunted oak A wheel was caught, the axle broke! Then some went out with sudden pitch, And some were tumbled in the ditch, And one jumped off to save his neck, While others still hung to the wreck. Confusion reigned, for coats were rent, And hats were crushed, and horns were bent, And what began with fun and clatter Had turned to quite a serious matter. Some blamed the drivers, others thought The tooting horns the trouble brought. More said, that they small wisdom showed, Who left the root so near the road. But while they talked about their plight Upon them burst the morning light With all the grandeur and the sheen That June could lavish on the scene. So hitching horses where they could, The Brownies scampered for the wood. And lucky were the Brownies spry: A dark and deep ravine was nigh That seemed to swallow them alive So quick were they to jump and dive, To safely hide from blazing day That fast had driven night away, And forced them to leave all repairs To other heads and hands than theirs. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76910.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
