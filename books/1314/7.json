{"id":23977,"no":7,"title":"THE BROWNIES AT NIAGARA FALLS.","content":"THE Brownies\u0027 Band, while passing through The country with some scheme in view, Paused in their race, and well they might, When broad Niagara came in sight. Said one: \"Give ear to what I say, I\u0027ve been a traveler in my day; I\u0027ve waded through Canadian mud To Montmorenci\u0027s tumbling flood. But ah! Niagara is the fall That truly overtops them all— The children prattle of its tide, And age repeats its name with pride The school-boy draws it on his slate, The preacher owns its moral weight; The tourist views it dumb with awe, The Indian paints it for his squaw, And tells how many a warrior true Went o\u0027er it in his bark canoe, And never after friend or foe Got sight of man or boat below.\" Another said: \"The Brownie Band Upon the trembling brink may stand, Where kings and queens have sighed to be, But dare not risk themselves at sea.\" Some played along the shelving ledge That beetled o\u0027er the river\u0027s edge; Some gazed in meditation deep Upon the water\u0027s fearful leap; Some went below, to crawl about Behind the fall, that shooting out Left space where they might safely stand And view the scene so wild and grand. Some climbed the trees of cedar kind, That o\u0027er the rushing stream inclined, To find a seat, to swing and frisk And bend the boughs at fearful risk; Until the rogues could dip and lave Their toes at times beneath the wave. Still more and more would venture out In spite of every warning shout. At last the weight that dangled there Was greater than the tree could bear. And then the snapping roots let go Their hold upon the rocks below, And leaping out away it rode Upon the stream with all its load! Then shouts that rose above the roar Went up from tree-top, and from shore, When it was thought that half the band Was now forever leaving land. It chanced, for reasons of their own, Some men around that tree had thrown A lengthy rope that still was strong And stretching fifty feet along. Before it disappeared from sight, The Brownies seized it in their might, And then a strain for half an hour Went on between the mystic power Of Brownie hands united all, And water rushing o\u0027er the fall. But true to friends the Brownies strained, And inch by inch the tree was gained. Across the awful bend it passed With those in danger clinging fast, And soon it reached the rocky shore With all the Brownies safe once more. And then, as morning showed her face, The Brownies hastened from the place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76899.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
