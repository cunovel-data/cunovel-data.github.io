{"id":23991,"no":21,"title":"THE BROWNIES\u0027 HALLOW-EVE.","content":"ON Hallow-eve, that night of fun, When elves and goblins frisk and run, And many games and tricks are tried At every pleasant fireside, The Brownies halted to survey A village that below them lay, And wondered as they rested there To hear the laughter fill the air That from the happy children came As they enjoyed some pleasant game. Said one: \"What means this merry flow That comes so loudly from below, Uncommon pleasures must abound Where so much laughter can be found.\" Another said: \"Now, by your leave, I\u0027ll tell you \u0027t is All-Hallow-eve, When people meet to have their sport At curious games of every sort; I know them all from first to last, And now, before the night has passed, For some convenient place we\u0027ll start Without delay to play our part.\" Two dozen mouths commenced to show Their teeth in white and even row; Two dozen voices cried with speed, \"The plan is good we\u0027re all agreed.\" And in a trice four dozen feet Went down the hill with even beat. Without a long or wearying race The Brownies soon secured a place That answered well in every way For all the games they wished to play. There tubs of water could be found, By which to stoop or kneel around, And strive to bring the pennies out That on the bottom slipped about. Then heads were wet and shoulders, too, Where some would still the coin pursue, And mouth about now here and there Without a pause or breath of air Until in pride, with joyful cries, They held aloft the captured prize. More stood the tempting bait beneath, And with a hasty snap of teeth The whirling apple thought to claim And shun the while the candle\u0027s flame,— But found that with such pleasure goes An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose. More named the oats as people do To try which hearts are false, which true, And on the griddle placed the pair To let them part or smoulder there; And smiled to see, through woe or weal, How often hearts were true as steel. Still others tried to read their fate Or fortune in a dish or plate, Learn whether they would ever wed, Or lead a single life instead; Or if their mate would be a blessing, Or prove a partner most distressing. Then others in the open air, Of fun and frolic had their share; Played \"hide and seek,\" and \"blindman\u0027s buff,\" And \"tag\" o\u0027er places smooth or rough, And \"snap the whip\" and \"trip the toe,\" And games that none but Brownies know. As if their lives at stake were placed, They jumped around and dodged and raced, And tumbled headlong to the ground When feet some hard obstruction found; At times across the level mead, Some proved their special claims to speed, And as reward of merit wore A wreath of green till sport was o\u0027er. The hours flew past as hours will When joys do every moment fill; The moon grew weak and said good-night, And turned her pallid face from sight; Then weakening stars began to fail, But still the Brownies kept the vale; Full many a time had hours retired Much faster than the band desired, And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay Aside, because of coming day, But never yet with greater pain Did they behold the crimson stain That morning spread along the sky, And told them they must homeward fly \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76913.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
