{"id":23992,"no":22,"title":"THE BROWNIES\u0027 FLAG-POLE.","content":"THE Brownies through a village bound, Paused in their run to look around, And wondered why the central square Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair. Said one: \"Without delay we\u0027ll go To woods that stand some miles below. The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest So straight and high above the rest, We soon can choose a flag-pole there To ornament this village square. Then every one a hand will lend To trim it off from end to end, To peel it smooth and paint it white, And hoist it in the square to-night.\" Then to the woods the Brownies ran At once to carry out their plan; While some ran here and there with speed For implements to serve their need, Some rambled through the forest free To find the proper kind of tree, Then climbed the tree while yet it stood To learn if it was sound and good, Without a flaw, a twist, or bend, To mar its looks from end to end. When one was found that suited well, To work the active Brownies fell; And soon with sticks beneath their load, The band in grand procession strode; It gave them quite enough to do To safely put the project through, But when they reached the square, at last, Some ropes around the pole were passed And from the tops of maples tall A crowd began to pull and haul, While others gathered at the base Until the flag-pole stood in place. For Brownies seldom idle stand When there is fun or work on hand. At night when darkness wraps us round They come from secret haunts profound, With brushes, pots of paint, and all, They clamber over fence and wall; And soon on objects here and there That hold positions high in air, And most attract the human eye, The marks of Brownie fingers lie. Sometimes with feet that never tire They climb the tall cathedral spire; When all the town is still below, Save watchmen pacing to and fro, By light of moon, and stars alone, They dust the marble and the stone, And with their brushes, small and great, They paint and gild the dial-plate; And bring the figures plain in sight That all may note Time\u0027s rapid flight. And accidents they often know While through the heavy works they go, Where slowly turning wheels at last In bad position hold them fast. But Brownies, notwithstanding all The hardships that may them befall, Still persevere in every case Till morning drives them from the place. And then with happy hearts they fly To hide away from human eye. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76914.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
