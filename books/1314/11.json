{"id":23981,"no":11,"title":"THE BROWNIES AND THE WHALE.","content":"AS Brownies chanced at eve to stray Around a wide but shallow bay, Not far from shore, to their surprise, They saw a whale of monstrous size, That, favored by the wind and tide, Had ventured in from ocean wide, But waves receding by-and-by, Soon left him with a scant supply. At times, with flaps and lunges strong He worked his way some yards along, Till on a bar or sandy marge He grounded like a leaden barge. \"A chance like this for all the band,\" Cried one, \"but seldom comes to hand. I know the bottom of this bay Like those who made the coast survey. \u0027Tis level as a threshing-floor And shallow now from shore to shore; That creature\u0027s back will be as dry As hay beneath a tropic sky, Till morning tide comes full and free And gives him aid to reach the sea.\" \"I catch the hint!\" another cried; \"Let all make haste to gain his side Then clamber up as best we may, And ride him round till break of day.\" At once, the band in great delight Went splashing through the water bright, And soon to where he rolled about They lightly swam, or waded out. Now climbing up, the Brownies tried To take position for the ride. Some lying down a hold maintained; More, losing place as soon as gained, Were forced a dozen times to scale The broad side of the stranded whale. Now half-afloat and half-aground The burdened monster circled round, Still groping clumsily about As if to find the channel out, And Brownies clustered close, in fear That darker moments might be near. And soon the dullest in the band Was sharp enough to understand The creature was no longer beached, But deeper water now had reached. For plunging left, or plunging right, Or plowing downward in his might, The fact was plain, as plain could be— The whale was working out to sea! A creeping fear will seize the mind As one is leaving shores behind, And knows the bark whereon he sails Is hardly fit to weather gales. Soon Fancy, with a graphic sweep, Portrays the nightmares of the deep; While they can see, with living eye, The terrors of the air sweep by. For who would not a fierce bird dread, If it came flying at his head? And these were hungry, squawking things, With open beaks and flapping wings. They made the Brownies dodge and dip, Into the sea they feared to slip. The birds they viewed with chattering teeth, Yet dreaded more the foes beneath. The lobster, with his ready claw; The fish with sword, the fish with saw; The hermit-crab, in coral hall, Averse to every social call; The father-lasher, and the shrimp, The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp, All these increase the landsman\u0027s fright, As shores are fading out of sight. Such fear soon gained complete command Of every Brownie in the band. They looked behind, where fair and green The grassy banks and woods were seen. They looked ahead, where white and cold The foaming waves of ocean rolled, And then, with woful faces drew Comparisons between the two. Some blamed themselves for action rash Against all reason still to dash In danger\u0027s way, and never think Until they stood on ruin\u0027s brink. While others threw the blame on those Who did the risky trip propose. But meantime deep and deeper still The whale was settling down until His back looked like an island small That scarce gave standing-room to all. But, when their chance seemed slight indeed To sport again o\u0027er dewy mead, The spouting whale, with movement strong, Ran crashing through some timbers long That lumbermen had strongly tied In cribs and rafts, an acre wide. \u0027Twas then, in such a trying hour, The Brownies showed their nerve and power. The diving whale gave little time For them to choose a stick to climb,— But grips were strong; no hold was lost, However high the logs were tossed; By happy chance the boom remained That to the nearest shore was chained, And o\u0027er that bridge the Brownies made A safe retreat to forest shade. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76903.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
