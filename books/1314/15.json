{"id":23985,"no":15,"title":"THE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.","content":"ONE NIGHT the Brownies found their way To where some tracks and switches lay, And buildings stood, such as are found In every town on railroad ground. They moved about from place to place, With prying eyes and cautious pace They peeped in shops and gained a view, Where cars were standing bright and new; While others, that had service known, And in some crash were overthrown, On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs, Were undergoing full repairs. The table that turns end for end Its heavy load, without a bend, Was next inspected through and through And tested by the wondering crew. They scanned the signal-lights with care That told the state of switches there,— Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead, Or simply to some siding led. Then round a locomotive strong They gathered in an earnest throng, Commenting on the style it showed, Its strength and speed upon the road. Said one: \"That \u0027pilot\u0027 placed before Will toss a cow a block or more; You\u0027d hardly find a bone intact When such a thing her frame has racked— Above the fence, and, if you please, Above the smoke-stack and the trees Will go the horns and heels in air, When hoisted by that same affair.\" \"Sometimes it saves,\" another cried, \"And throws an object far aside That would to powder have been ground, If rushing wheels a chance had found. I saw a goat tossed from the track And landed on a farmer\u0027s stack, And though surprised at fate so strange, He seemed delighted at the change; And lived content, on best of fare, Until the farmer found him there.\" Another said: \"We\u0027ll have some fun And down the road this engine run. The steam is up, as gauges show; She\u0027s puffing, ready now to go; The fireman and the engineer Are at their supper, in the rear Of yonder shed. I took a peep, And found the watchman fast asleep. So now\u0027s our time, if we but haste, The joys of railway life to taste. I know the engine-driver\u0027s art, Just how to stop, reverse, and start; I\u0027ve watched them when they little knew From every move I knowledge drew; We\u0027ll not be seen till under way, And then, my friends, here let me say, The man or beast will something lack Who strives to stop us on the track.\" Then some upon the engine stepped, And some upon the pilot crept, And more upon the tender found A place to sit and look around. And soon away the engine rolled At speed \u0027twas fearful to behold; It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight, At least at mile-a-minute rate; And even where the curves were short The engine turned them with a snort That made the Brownies\u0027 hearts the while Rise in their throats, for half a mile. But travelers many dangers run On safest roads beneath the sun. They ran through yards, where dogs came out To choke with dust that whirled about, And so could neither growl nor bark Till they had vanished in the dark; Some pigs that wandered late at night, And neither turned to left nor right, But on the crossing held debate Who first should squeeze beneath the gate, Were helped above the fence to rise Ere they had time to squeal surprise, And never after cared to stray Along the track by night or day. But when a town was just in sight, And speed was at its greatest height,— Alas! that such a thing should be,— An open switch the Brownies see. Then some thought best at once to go Into the weeds and ditch below; But many on the engine stayed And held their grip, though much dismayed. And waited for the shock to fall That would decide the fate of all. In vain reversing tricks were tried, And brakes to every wheel applied; The locomotive forward flew, In spite of all that skill could do. But just as they approached the place Where trouble met them face to face, Through some arrangement, as it seemed, Of which the Brownies never dreamed, The automatic switch was closed, A safety signal-light exposed, And they were free to roll ahead, And wait for those who\u0027d leaped in dread; Although the end seemed near at hand Of every Brownie in the band, And darkest heads through horrid fright Were in a moment changed to white, The injuries indeed were small. A few had suffered from their fall, And some were sprained about the toes, While more were scraped upon the nose; But all were able to succeed In climbing to a place with speed, And there they stayed until once more They passed the heavy round-house door. Then jumping down on every side The Brownies scampered off to hide; And as they crossed the trestle high The sun was creeping up the sky, And urged them onward in their race To find some safe abiding place. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778/76907.html","bookId":1314,"book":{"id":1314,"title":"Another Brownie Book","description":"简介： When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,And trees were bending with their loads,The wind grew mild which had been raw...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2778","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
