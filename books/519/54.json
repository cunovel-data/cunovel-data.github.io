{"id":10463,"no":54,"title":"CHAPTER LIV. A STAB IN THE DARK.","content":"\"If there is one thing that is likely to come between you and Bruce,\" said Lawrence, as he struggled into his overcoat, \"it is your devotion to that child, Hetty. There is nothing the matter with her at all. She is merely suffering from strawberries. I had an idea to work this afternoon, contrary to my usual custom, and I soothed Mamie with strawberries. Blame me as you like, but there it is.\" \n \n Hetty laughed. It was past eleven, and Lawrence was going down to his club for an hour. The little girl had been a bit more fretful than usual. \n \n \"I\u0027m so sorry for the poor child,\" she said. \n \n \"And so am I. You\u0027ve done as much for her as if she were your own, but all the same I should not be sorry if somebody claimed her. I\u0027ve never had the slightest doubt that she is no relation to the Countess at all.\" \n \n \"Then why should a woman like that encumber herself----\" \n \n \"My dear child, I don\u0027t look upon it in that light at all. The child gave our picturesque friend a certain distinction--\u0027My husband is dead, and this is my only child,\u0027 and all that sort of thing. It pays in society.\" \n \n With which cynical remark Lawrence lighted a cigarette and departed. From above the fretful voice of Mamie called to her dear Hetty. In sooth, the child was running a great risk of being spoilt. \n \n \"What is it, darling?\" Hetty said. \"What can I do for you?\" \n \n Mamie was thirsty. She scornfully refused a suggestion of soda-water; nothing would content her but a certain fruit salt that came from a certain place some way off. She was quite sure that she could not do without it, and that unless the salt was forthcoming she would have a dreadful headache in the morning. \n \n \"All right,\" Hetty said cheerfully. \"I\u0027ll go and get it for you.\" \n \n There was the best part of a mile to go; it was getting very late, but Hetty had not been out all day, so that she enjoyed the walk. She made her way back along the darkness of Alton Square. Most of the houses were dark, and nobody was to be seen. \n \n From a little way off came the sound of rapid footsteps. The step grew swifter, and there was the sound of another behind. As if by magic a half score of people seemed to spring from under the trees against the square yonder. \n \n It all seemed like a dream to Hetty after, a confused mist out of which came two struggling figures, there was the flash of a knife, and Hetty, heedless of danger, darted forward with an idea of interfering. \n \n The cry that rose to her lips was stifled, a firm hand grasped her arm, another was laid tightly over her mouth. \n \n \"You must say and do nothing,\" a hoarse voice whispered. \"It is a fair quarrel and a fair punishment. Accept my deepest apologies for handling a lady so roughly, but I am but the creature of circumstance.\" \n \n Hetty\u0027s heart was beating violently. The struggle seemed interminable, but in reality it was a mere matter of seconds. Then one figure fell to the ground and lay there rigid and motionless. It was too dark to see more than the outline of the tragedy, and almost before it had begun it had dissolved away, leaving only that ominously still figure lying prone in the roadway. \n \n Hetty\u0027s antagonist had vanished also. He had gone clean out of sight before Hetty realised that she was free. Then she called loudly for help. A policeman came from somewhere, and Hetty was pouring out her tale. \n \n \"Seems pretty bad,\" said the policeman gruffly, as he flashed his lantern down on the white still face. \"This here\u0027s a job for the ambulance.\" \n \n He whistled again and again, and presently the ambulance came trotting up. It was only when the body was raised that Hetty recognized the white still face. With a thrill it came to her that she was looking at Balmayne. \n \n She was conscious of no feeling of astonishment. At every turn she seemed to be brought into contact with the central figures of the Corner House tragedy. A sudden inspiration came to her. \n \n \"As it happens, I know the gentleman,\" she said. \"When I was governess to the Countess Lalage\u0027s little girl he frequently came to the house. I am a niece of Mr. Gilbert Lawrence, the novelist, who lives close by. There is a room to spare in his house, and this looks like a bad case. If you will follow me----\" \n \n The sergeant in charge of the ambulance had no objection to make. A little later and Balmayne was stripped and in bed. A doctor who had been summoned shook his head as he made his diagnosis of the wound. \n \n \"Critical,\" he said. \"There has been a great loss of blood, too. It is all a matter of constitution now. Till I can send a nurse in----\" \n \n Hetty nodded. She perfectly understood. And Bruce had often told her that she was one of the best nurses he had ever met. There was nothing to do for the moment beyond watching over the patient to see that no change occurred. \n \n Hetty sat there all alone for some time wondering. It looked as if fate was playing into her hands. If the man lying at the point of death could only speak, if he could only be induced to do so. \n \n Balmayne opened his eyes and looked languidly about him. It was quite evident that he had not the slightest idea what had happened. \n \n \"Where am I?\" he murmured, faintly. \n \n Hetty explained in a few words. The patient was not to talk. He was to lie there and try to sleep again. If he did so and obeyed instructions, before long he would be out and well again. \n \n A queer smile played over the listener\u0027s face. \n \n \"Till next time,\" he said. \"It\u0027s all over with me. The pitcher has gone too often to the well, and it has got broken at last. And I deserved all I got--there is no question whatever about that.\" \n \n \"You are not to say another word,\" Hetty said sternly. \n \n \"All right. Only that you are an angel of goodness. If I could only tell you----\" \n \n He lay back exhausted and closed his eyes again. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59965.html","bookId":519,"book":{"id":519,"title":"The Corner House","description":"简介： A brilliant light streamed from the open doorway of No. 1, Lytton Avenue, making a lane of flame across the pavement, touching pinched gaunt faces that formed a striking contrast to the dazzling scene within.
