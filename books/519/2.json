{"id":10411,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. HETTY.","content":"The figure of a girl rose out of a bower of palms and ferns and stood before Gordon Bruce with a shy welcome in her violet eyes. Just for a moment Bruce found himself contrasting this fresh English beauty with the Lalage Southern loveliness to the detriment of the latter. There was a purity and sweetness, a wonderful tenderness of expression about Hetty Lawrence that had always appealed to Bruce. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had known the Countess Lalage\u0027s governess for years. He admired her independence of character, too, though on the whole he would have preferred her taking the home that her uncle Gilbert Lawrence, the great novelist, was ever urging upon her. But she would have a home of her own soon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gordon, I am so glad you have come,\" she whispered. \"I have stolen away for half an hour as Mamie is better. If she wants me I have told the nurse----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She can\u0027t want you half so badly as I do,\" Gordon laughed as he bent down and kissed the shy lips. \"And that queer little creature will have to learn to do without you altogether before long. Four new patients today, Hetty. And I have taken the house in Green-Street.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can we really afford it?\" Hetty asked anxiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bruce kissed her again. He loved that little pathetic, anxious look of hers. He spoke confidently of the time when Harley Street should be theirs. There was a strength and reliance about her lover that always comforted Hetty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall be glad,\" she whispered, after a thoughtful pause, \"glad to get away from here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s flattering to me. But I thought you liked the Countess.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Hetty glanced fearfully around her. Nobody was near--only the palms and the scented roses could hear her confidences. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have tried,\" she confessed, \"and I have failed. She fascinates and yet repels me. There is some strange mystery about her. Gordon, I feel sure that there is the shadow of some great crime on her house. It sounds weak, hysterical, perhaps, but I can\u0027t get it out of my mind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, darling, the Countess has been a good friend to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know. You are strong and ambitious, and she is helping to make you the fashion. But has it ever struck you why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps it is because she has the good taste to like me,\" Gordon laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because she loves you,\" said Hetty, in a thrilling whisper. \"Because her whole heart and soul is given over to a consuming passion for you. There is a woman who would go any length to win a man\u0027s love. If a husband stood in the way she would poison him; if a woman, she would be destroyed. Gordon, I am frightened; I wake up in the middle of the night trembling. I wish you had never come here; I don\u0027t know what I wish.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gordon looked down into the troubled violet eyes with amazement. Surely he would wake up presently and find that he had been dreaming. Countess Lalage with all the world at her feet, and he a struggling doctor. Oh, it was preposterous! And yet little words and signs and hints unnoticed at the time were coming to his mind now. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish you hadn\u0027t told me this,\" he murmured, uneasily. \"It would have been far----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He paused. From overhead somewhere came the sound of a frightened, wailing cry, the pitiful call of a child in terror. Hetty was on her feet in a moment, all her fears had gone to the winds. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mamie,\" she exclaimed. \"Of course, nurse has crept off to the rest of the servants. Poor little wee frightened soul.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Hetty flashed off down the corridor, and was gone leaving Bruce to his troubled thoughts. Just before going, Hetty stood on her toes, and kissed her lover lightly on the lips. It was, perhaps, a goodnight caress, for there was a chance that she might not return. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a sound at the top of the corridor, just the suggestion of a swish of silken drapery, and Gordon Bruce half turned. Under a cluster of electric lights stood Leona Lalage; she must have seen everything. It might have been fancy, it might have been a guilty conscience, but just for the moment Countess Lalage seemed transformed into a white fury with two murderous demons gleaming in her dark restless eyes. Then her silk and ivory fan fell from her hands, and Gordon hastened to recover it. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he looked up again the mask of evil passions was gone. The Countess was smiling in her most fascinating manner. Gordon could not know that the long filbert nails had cut through the woman\u0027s glove, and were making red sores on the pink flesh. He did not know that he would have stood in peril of his life had there been a weapon near at hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must not flirt with my governess, Dr. Bruce,\" she said. \"I would have given a great deal not to have seen what I saw just now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebuke sounded in the best of taste. Gordon bowed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have a good excuse,\" he said, \"in fact, the very best. As I told you some months ago, I have known Miss Lawrence for years. We have always understood one another, but because I was in no position to marry nothing has been said. Won\u0027t you be the first to congratulate me on my engagement?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then fetch me an ice. By the time you return I shall have thought of something pretty to say. Ah, I have pricked my finger. The ice, my dear boy, the ice. The finger will not hurt till you return.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her hand had shot out grasping for something to steady herself on--the whole world spun around her. She had given her whole passionate, tempestuous soul to this man; she had never dreamt that she could fail to gain his love. She had never failed before, she had only required to hold up her hand. . . . \\n\\n \\n\\n She clasped the stem of a rose passionately. The cruel thorns cut into the soft white flesh, but there was pleasure in the very pain. Another moment and she would have flashed out her secret and despair to the world. For the moment she was crushed and beaten to the earth. Yet she spoke very quietly and evenly, though the effort brought the blood thrilling to her temples. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was alone now; she could give vent to her passionate anger. She smashed her fan across her knee, she tore her long gloves into fragments. Dimly, in a mirror opposite, she saw her white ghastly face, and the stain of blood where she had caught her lips between her teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I have to sit down and submit to that tamely,\" she murmured. \"You little white-faced cat, you pink doll, so you are going to get the best of me. We shall see; oh, yes, we shall see. If I could be somewhere where I could tear myself to pieces, where I could scream aloud and nobody could hear! If I could only face him now and smile and say honeyed words! Tomorrow, perhaps, but not tonight. Even I have my limits. . . . He\u0027s coming back!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One glance at the dim mirror and Leona Lalage flew down the corridor. The music of the band was like the sound of mocking demons in her ears. As she flew up the stairs she could see the blank windows of the Corner House staring dreadfully in. Then she locked the door behind her and flung herself headlong down on the bed. . . . \\n\\n \\n\\n Only for a minute, a brief respite; then she must go down to her guests again. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59913.html","bookId":519,"book":{"id":519,"title":"The Corner House","description":"简介： A brilliant light streamed from the open doorway of No. 1, Lytton Avenue, making a lane of flame across the pavement, touching pinched gaunt faces that formed a striking contrast to the dazzling scene within.
