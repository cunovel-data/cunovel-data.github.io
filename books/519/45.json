{"id":10454,"no":45,"title":"CHAPTER XLV. A CHASE.","content":"Meanwhile, Balmayne had been waiting impatiently for the return of his companion. Half an hour passed, and there was no sign of her return. There had been so many accidents and strokes of ill-luck lately that even Balmayne was nervous. He had half a mind to go and see what was wrong, but he changed his mind and lighted a cigarette instead. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was angry and afraid at the same time. Twice already the same policeman had passed the black motor, and had examined it critically. The third time he came round he would be pretty sure to want to know why it was still there. If---- \\n\\n \\n\\n A sudden cry smote the air, a yell of murder followed by the quick rush of footsteps. A police-whistle screamed hoarsely, there were answering whistles out of the darkness. The rush of footsteps drew nearer. The next instant, sobbing breathlessly, Leona Lalage flung herself headlong into the car. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What on earth,\" Balmayne began, \"what on earth----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t stop to ask questions,\" Leona panted. \"Get along quickly. Go home by as long a route as you can. Ah, they are coming.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A policeman was coming. He hailed the car. He could have no suspicion of its occupants as yet, he only sought information. Balmayne pulled the lever and the car started. The officer yelled instructions to somebody in the darkness; from point to point the message went along. There was no escape unless good luck stood on their side. And the motor was terribly swift. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And now perhaps you wouldn\u0027t mind telling me what it\u0027s all about,\" Balmayne growled as the motor sped along. \"What was the fuss about?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I found Charlton there,\" Leona panted. \"Above all persons in the world, I found Charlton there. He was sitting in the darkness waiting for Isidore----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you haven\u0027t even got the notes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The notes! I had more important matters to think of. I found matches and lighted the gas. And there sitting opposite me was Charlton. It was part of my wretched luck that I should have stumbled on him in this disguise. Had I been differently dressed he would never have recognized me. I----. Faster, faster.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A policeman stepped out of the gloom and tried to pull up the car. It flashed by him at the rate of 70 miles an hour. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I would have made some excuse and got away,\" Leona went on. \"But he had me fast. He was going to send me to gaol. That would have been a pretty thing for Countess Lalage! But he only knew me for what I used to be. If I could only get away and destroy the disguise he would never get on my track again. I pretended that I could not fight him any more; I lulled his suspicions to sleep I was going to show him how the forgery was done. He stooped to get me a pen and the knife went into his shoulder. Had he not moved I should have killed him. He managed to creep to the window and give the alarm.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Leona stopped for want of breath. Her face was streaming with moisture. The fierce rush of cold air cooled her heated temples. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There was nothing else for it,\" she said. \"I wish I had killed him, then I should have got the notes and returned home comfortably. As it is half the officers in London are looking for the car at the present moment. See that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She tugged at Balmayne\u0027s arm. A cordon of men were drawn up across the road. With marvellous dexterity Balmayne whipped the car round almost into a set of men who scattered right and left. One clung to the back of the car for a moment, but Balmayne beat him off at length. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Turn down Churton Street,\" Leona whispered. \"There seems to be nobody at that corner. If we can only get round by way of Hill Crescent we may manage to escape yet. Once in the square we can baffle them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was quiet enough in Churton Street. And again in Collin\u0027s Crescent, which was so near home that the long line of Lytton Avenue could be seen. But there again standing figures came out of the gloom and the car sped on. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So near and yet so far,\" said Balmayne between his teeth. \"The best thing would be to climb the railings and hide in one of the gardens, only it would mean abandoning the car. And we might just as well give ourselves up as that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Leona nodded, the spirit of adventure was upon her now, it fired her blood. And there was something intoxicating about that maddening pace. Still, they could not go on at that speed for ever. Another half an hour at that speed and the petrol must give out. Balmayne was growing anxious. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Another dash round, then I must try the lane at the back of the house,\" he said. \"The car can\u0027t go on like this for ever.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They sped on again, finding the avenues of escape gradually closing in. Day and night there are always people in the London streets, and the news was flying far that murder had been committed, and that the culprits were escaping in a fast motor. By an extra spurt of speed a rope drawn across the roadway near the avenue was just escaped. A yell of execration followed from the crowd. \\n\\n \\n\\n The car flashed round the corner of Lytton Avenue on two wheels. There was a jolt and a crash as the flying machine went over a balk of wood laid across the road, and the next instant the occupants were rolling across the path. Just for the moment there was nobody in sight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quick,\" cried Balmayne, as he pulled his companion to her feet. \"You don\u0027t seem to be hurt, It\u0027s a mystery we were not killed. There\u0027s a rail out of the long line of rails in the square yonder, close here. Ah! Now you squeeze through and I\u0027ll follow. We shall save our skins yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They crawled through and hid themselves in the black shrubs. A policeman came running up and surveyed the wreck thoughtfully. His lantern played all over it, he stooped down and rubbed at the dull frame-work vigorously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, what\u0027s this?\" he exclaimed. \"What does the game mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Found anything out, mate?\" another officer asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Found out a lot,\" said the first policeman. \"This motor\u0027s as bright as your lantern really, It\u0027s all covered over with blacklead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59956.html","bookId":519,"book":{"id":519,"title":"The Corner House","description":"简介： A brilliant light streamed from the open doorway of No. 1, Lytton Avenue, making a lane of flame across the pavement, touching pinched gaunt faces that formed a striking contrast to the dazzling scene within.
