{"id":10438,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.","content":"But it was not for long that Hetty remained like that. There was much to be done yet and much to learn. The thought of Gordon spurred her on. If she could get this woman into her power and force her to speak, all would be well. Hetty never doubted for a moment that Leona Lalage was at the bottom of her lover\u0027s misfortunes. \\n\\n \\n\\n If she could only communicate with Gordon! But how was that to be done? Hetty thought for a moment. Then the inspiration came to her. In her stockinged feet she crept down to the basement to the housekeeper\u0027s room and closed the door behind her. She was not more than a minute gone, and when she reached her room again it was with the knowledge that she could count on somebody now. \\n\\n \\n\\n These two fiends would not dare to do him any harm now. All the same, Hetty made up her mind not to go to bed. She had Mamie in her own room, the door of which she left purposely open. If the worst came to the worst she could ring the electric alarm on the top landing and rouse the household. Mamie was sleeping peacefully with her head on her hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You poor little soul?\" Hetty murmured. \"Ah, you poor little soul!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile the precious twain downstairs had laid their burden on a couch in the dining-room. Balmayne himself poured out a glass of wine, and carried it unsteadily to his lips. He was worn out and shaking; he did not know what to do. It was not often that he was so hopelessly beaten as this. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A mischievous boy with a pocket knife, and a white-faced cat of a governess with a headache,\" she said, bitterly. \"It\u0027s maddening to think of a little thing like that coming between us and our schemes. And if I thought for a moment that Hetty Lawrence really suspected anything----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pshaw!\" Balmayne growled. \"She doesn\u0027t suspect anything. Her manner was too simple and natural for that. And the girl carries her goodness and purity in her face. Oh, you can laugh, but that girl lives in another world than ours. When I looked at her just now, she reminded me of what I might have been.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Countess gave a low, scornful laugh. Balmayne sentimental was amusing. She had the profoundest contempt herself for girls of Hetty\u0027s type. It was always a mystery to her what men could see in them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, she saved us from murder tonight,\" Balmayne said, looking grimly down into the white face on the sofa. \"By Jove, he\u0027s coming to!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maitrank stirred and stirred uneasily. Then he opened his eyes and stared round him. His quick, active mind was beginning to work. But those eyes were a little uneasy and fearsome as they saw both Leona and Balmayne there. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What has happened?\" Maitrank asked. \"Have I been asleep or what? There\u0027s something that seems to burn into my brain. Have I been ill?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Looks like it!\" said Balmayne. \"You left here all right some time ago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know. I remember that now. I said goodnight to the Countess--eh, eh, the Countess!--and there was a policeman outside talking to a man in evening dress. He said goodnight to me and I walked down the road. I don\u0027t recollect anything else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He paused in some confusion. He had the profoundest respect for the cunning and audacity of the people with whom he had to deal. Was this some startling new plot that they had been working on him? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then how did I get back again?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I found you in the road,\" Balmayne said boldly. \"I was going away from here, seeing that my services were no longer required. I happened to find you. I was just in time, for one of the street prowlers was going through your pockets. Probably your fur coat attracted his attention. It is fortunate----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maitrank plunged his hands into his pockets. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have been robbed!\" he cried, \"robbed of those diamonds! Ah, tell me what is this new trick you have played on me! Help! Help!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He yelled aloud. The scream of rage and disappointment rang through the house. It caused a servant to turn over sleepily and wonder what the matter was, it roused little Mamie, and brought her up in bed with a scream of fear. Hetty heard it too, and wondered if murder was not being committed after all. \\n\\n \\n\\n She could not stand there doing nothing. She ran downstairs and burst into the dining-room. She had a good excuse at the end of her tongue. The Countess turned upon her fiercely and demanded what she was doing there. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mamie,\" Hetty said simply. \"The child has been greatly frightened. She is calling for you. Will you please go up at once?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was all so simple and natural that Leona Lalage could say nothing for a moment. The stranger was standing up searching his pockets wildly. His eyes gleamed with hatred and defeat and baffled avarice. He knew that he had been made the victim of some trick, but there was no name for it yet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will come up,\" Leona said, anything to get Hetty out of the room. \"It is very unfortunate that this should have happened here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The door closed behind them. Maitrank\u0027s fingers crooked and reached for Balmayne. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dog,\" he hissed, \"dog, I\u0027ll be even with you yet. How it has been managed I do not know yet, but I shall find out. My diamonds, give me my diamonds.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Balmayne took the bare throat of the speaker in his grip and shook Maitrank as a reed is shaken in the wind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be silent!\" he hissed; \"have a care or----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He paused. There was a loud imperious knocking at the front door. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59940.html","bookId":519,"book":{"id":519,"title":"The Corner House","description":"简介： A brilliant light streamed from the open doorway of No. 1, Lytton Avenue, making a lane of flame across the pavement, touching pinched gaunt faces that formed a striking contrast to the dazzling scene within.
