{"id":10436,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. A GLASS OF WINE.","content":"Hetty\u0027s patience was rewarded at last. She could hear the faint murmur of the motor in the street; there was a sudden gush of air as the front door opened, and the voice of the Countess in her most honeyed tones as she ushered somebody into the dining-room. Instantly the girl crept downstairs and hid herself behind the portière over the door. It was an audacious thing to do, but her audacity paid, as it generally does. All the lights in the room were ablaze; at one end of the table was a dainty supper, flanked by a couple of gold-topped bottles. A little shabby man with a hooked nose was in the act of taking off a heavy fur-lined coat. \"How good of you to come,\" the Countess said. \"Sit down and let me wait upon you--there is no need at all to ring for the servants. You can talk and eat at the same time. There! I will give you some of the cigarettes you are so fond of.\" The meal was finished presently. Hetty caught the scent of cigarette smoke. The Countess lounged back in her chair, smoking too. She seemed perfectly self-possessed. She looked so easy and comfortable that Maitrank was filled with admiration. \"You are quite well and blooming?\" he asked. \"Ah, it is an easy conscience.\" \"I\u0027ve no conscience at all,\" the Countess laughed. \"If I had possessed such a thing I should not be here at this moment.\" Maitrank muttered. \"Perhaps not. Also you would not have robbed me of the best part of ￡100,000. Charming swindler, where is my money?\" \"Most courteous of Shylocks, it is all spent. I am going to be frank with you, which is very virtuous on my part, seeing that you have found me out. That San Salvator property is worth exactly nothing. Also it is mortgaged in four places. But for a bit of pure bad luck I should have got more out of you for it.\" \"Ay, ay,\" Maitrank showed his yellow fangs in a grin, \"that is true. Go on.\" \"You have found me out and I must pay you. It is no question of honour, I am bound to do so to save my face. But meanwhile I must find another victim.\" \"Meanwhile you will do nothing of the sort,\" said the usurer. \"I am not going to wait. Give me half and I will hold the sword suspended for a fortnight. Give me those diamonds, and I will write a receipt for ￡30,000.\" A little flush of colour crept into Leona Lalage\u0027s cheek. \"They are worth half as much again,\" she cried. \"You are a coward to take advantage of your position like that, and with a woman too.\" Maitrank grinned again, in no way abashed. \"I never want another woman like you to deal with,\" he said. \"I prefer a man, however great a scoundrel he may be. But you would have robbed me; I have turned the tables on you. And I am going to squeeze you. Give me those diamonds, take a receipt for the sum I mentioned, and I wait a fortnight.\" \"And if I refuse your offer?\" said Leona between her teeth. Maitrank glanced meaningly round the luxurious room. He took in the works of art, the carpets and skins, the flowers, and the soft shaded light. \"This place is more comfortable than a gaol,\" he said coolly. He saw nothing of the murderous look in the eyes of his companion. Nobody had seen him enter the house, nobody even knew that he was in London. All the servants had gone to bed. Lalage had by her hand an accomplice ready for anything. She checked the words that rose to her lips. She produced pen, ink, and paper. With a passionate gesture she tore the diamonds from her throat and breast and hair. \"Take them,\" she said hoarsely; \"take them and write me a receipt at once before I repent. Better do anything than come between a woman and her jewels. There, a glass of wine. To your speedy ruin and destruction.\" She poured out the amber liquid from a fresh bottle into a fresh glass and drank it down. With a shaking hand she filled another glass for Maitrank, who accepted it gallantly. The diamonds he slipped coolly into his pocket. \"Never lose your temper,\" he said. \"It leads to apoplexy. Ah, my fine madam, you thought to pinch me, but I have pinched you instead.\" The Countess rose with her eyes blazing. She pointed to the door. \"Begone!\" she cried. \"Go, before I do you mischief. See, I help you on with your coat. Now go, and don\u0027t let me see that ugly yellow face of yours for a fortnight.\" Maitrank chuckled as he passed down the steps. A policeman bade him goodnight, a policeman chatting to a man in evening dress. The policeman passed along the empty road, the other followed Maitrank. A second later and Maitrank staggered, and fell headlong in the roadway. The policeman had passed out of sight now. Like a flash the man in evening dress was upon the form of the unconscious capitalist. He was picked up as if he had been a feather-weight. An instant later and he was back at No. 1, Lytton Avenue, again. \"Quick!\" the Countess whispered. \"You managed that very cleverly, Balmayne. We have a credible witness who saw this creature leave the house, thanks to you.\" \"And the idea of drugging the glass before pouring out the wine, thanks to you,\" said Balmayne. \"I must get this chap through the garden and on the motor at once. Give me a few minutes\u0027 start, and he\u0027s not likely to trouble us again.\" Hetty sped from her hiding-place through the hall into the garden. The little green gate was open, and beyond the motor, once more in its black guise. Hetty stood there just a minute, wondering what next she should do. If there was only somebody near that she could confide in and send a message by! If she could only prevent Balmayne from starting on his mysterious errand! There was no time to be lost, for she could hear Balmayne coming down the garden. And then a happy inspiration came to her. From her head she removed the gold and ornamented dagger, with its long steel pin. She stooped down. . . Balmayne came with his burden, which he flung in and covered with a rug. He pulled at the lever, and the great machine started, and then dragged, as if some great weight was hanging on behind. A snarling curse came from Balmayne\u0027s lips. \"A thousand maledictions on it!\" he muttered. \"Both back tires are punctured!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59938.html","bookId":519,"book":{"id":519,"title":"The Corner House","description":"简介： A brilliant light streamed from the open doorway of No. 1, Lytton Avenue, making a lane of flame across the pavement, touching pinched gaunt faces that formed a striking contrast to the dazzling scene within.
