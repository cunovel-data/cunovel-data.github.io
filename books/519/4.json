{"id":10413,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. WEAVING THE NET.","content":"Hetty rubbed her eyes with the feeling that it had all been a dream. It was not yet very late, only a little after midnight, and the brilliant saloons were still crowded with guests. Down below in the dining-rooms people were supping, there was the dreamy music of a band somewhere. As if nothing in the world had happened Countess Lalage sat smiling brilliantly and chatting with not the least distinguished of her guests, Mr. Gilbert Lawrence, the famous novelist. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hetty\u0027s uncle was evidently flattered. He liked talking of his own work, for his heart was in it, and he had for audience one of the most brilliant and beautiful women in London. His voice was something high pitched and it carried easily to Hetty\u0027s ears. Apparently, Bruce was gone, for the girl could see nothing of him anywhere. She was only too glad for a chance to sit down quietly and ponder over the disturbing events of the evening. Nobody was likely to be particularly interested in Leona Lalage\u0027s governess. \\n\\n \\n\\n The little man with the keen restless eyes and the pince-nez did not suggest the popular idea of the novelist. He chattered on with frank egotism. The world made much of him, and he took it for granted that all the world was interested in his work. And he was talking eagerly to Leona Lalage about the Corner House. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hetty caught her breath eagerly. That dark and evil place seemed to have suddenly become part and parcel of her life. Instinctively she half hid herself behind a great dragon vase full of palms. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fact is I used to know the man who lived there,\" Gilbert Lawrence was saying in his quick staccato way. \"And I was once in the house. No, I never met the wife. A depressing, gloomy house, like Tom Hood\u0027s haunted mansion. Just the place to plan a murder in, and never be found out. After the scandal I worked out a novel on the subject.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Leona Lalage\u0027s eyes gleamed like points of fire. They seemed to be burnt into her face. Hetty could see the restless play of the 62jeweled hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you ever publish it?\" she asked, eagerly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never had the chance to write it,\" Lawrence cried. \"But I worked it all out. Wicked woman, revenge, plot to bring hero within the grip of the law. It\u0027s pigeonholed in my writing desk, and labelled \u0027The Corner House.\u0027 But I don\u0027t suppose it will ever be written.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Worth stealing,\" a Society journalist lounging by remarked. \"I could write a novel, only I can never think of a plot. Your old housekeeper is asleep long ago. Where do you carry your latchkey?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ticket pocket of my overcoat,\" laughed Lawrence. \"But you\u0027ll be found out, Stead. Being a critic, the public would never take you seriously.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Countess\u0027s eyes flamed again suddenly. Hetty, watching, was utterly puzzled. What was there in this trivial conversation that held this woman almost breathless? She had the air of one who has taken a great resolution. She seemed like a man face to face with death, who sees a way out. \\n\\n \\n\\n A great many of the guests had by this time departed. It was growing very quiet in the streets now, the jingle of harness and the impatient pawing of horses had almost ceased. A soldierly-looking man came up to Leona Lalage, and held out his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you are not going to Aldershot tonight. Captain Gifford?\" Leona asked. \"A cab? How extravagant!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Motor car,\" the stolid dragoon replied. \"I\u0027ve got a fifteen horsepower Daimler that I can knock seventy miles an hour out of at a pinch. And no danger of being picked up for scorching on a dark night like this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Countess put her hand to her throat as if she had found some trouble with her breathing. Those wonderful eyes of hers were gleaming like electric flashes. Her face was white, but her lips were drawn narrow with resolution. She rose, and sauntered carelessly to the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dote on motors,\" she said. \"Nothing pleases me better than to go out in my own alone. I am coming to see your steed, Captain. The rooms are so hot here that I have a great mind to run away with it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gifford murmured something about the honour and pleasure. There was no vehicle to be seen in the dark street besides the gleaming mass of brass and steel that quietly simmered by the pavement. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A beauty!\" the Countess exclaimed, \"And the same action as my own. I believe I know as much about it as my chauffeur. Captain Gifford, let me try it alone, do. Harris, give me a coat. No, one of the gentlemen\u0027s overcoats--that grey one will do. Do let me go round the square alone!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gifford consented with outward urbanity. Few men could say no when Leona Lalage asked for a favour. With a man\u0027s coat over her gleaming black dress and ivory shoulders she sprang into the car, and the next moment she was flying round the corner. She laughed recklessly as she passed out of sight, a laugh with a ring of insolent triumph in it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ten minutes, twenty minutes passed, whilst Gifford fidgeted with a half-chewed cigarette in his teeth. Then there was a distant whirr, two flaming eyes and the gleam of brass and steel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An adventure!\" the Countess cried gaily. \"I have been dodging a couple of policemen, or I should have been back before. Beware of the high road. Goodbye, Captain, and if ever you wish to dispose of your Mercedes, give me the first offer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She passed up the steps with a face white but smiling, a queer lingering smile that boded ill to some one. \\n\\n \\n\\n A few guests of the higher Bohemian type still lingered, but with easy tact the hostess contrived to get rid of them. Her absence had not been noticed, the little escapade on the motor was not mentioned. \\n\\n \\n\\n The took of triumph faded from her eyes, she had grown worn and weary. The roses were wilting on the walls, the lights were mostly down now. Hetty, looking in to see if anything was wanted, found herself driven away almost fiercely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am tired, weary, worn-out,\" the Countess cried. \"I am sick of it all, sick of the world, and sick to death of myself. Go to bed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The house was quiet at last, there was a passing cab or two, the heavy tramp of a policeman. Up in the nursery little Mamie was still sleeping, she was flushed and uneasy and murmuring as she slept. The recreant nurse lay on her back snoring loudly. Well, Hetty was a light sleeper, and her room was just opposite the nursery. Nurse would have slept through an earthquake. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hetty returned to her room, but not to sleep. The vague shadow of some coming trouble lay upon her. She was young and healthy, and she was engaged to one of the best men on earth. And they were going to be married soon. She ought to have been superlatively happy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yet she was restless and uneasy. She had never known what it was to be nervous before. There was a dull booming noise somewhere, a knocking that seemed to proceed from the Corner House. Hetty heard something fall with a thud, she could have sworn to a stifled cry. A door opened and closed somewhere, there was a strong draught as if the basement had been opened. Hetty\u0027s heart was beating in some strange, unaccountable way. A little cry brought her to her feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n But it was only Mamie whimpering and crying for her. The child was awake and sitting up in bed, whilst the nurse still slept. Mamie was hot and feverish. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am so sorry,\" she said, \"but my throat is all parched up. Dearest, do please get me some soda-water.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, darling,\" Hetty whispered. \"Lie down and be quiet, and I will see what I can do for you. I shan\u0027t be long.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was everything that Hetty required in the dining-room. She crept softly down the marble staircase in her stockinged feet; down below in the hall a solitary point of flame in the electric corona made fitful shadows everywhere. There was one light also in the big, dark, dining-room, which was always left there, so that Hetty had no difficulty in finding a syphon of soda-water. She crept out into the hall again and paused. \\n\\n \\n\\n Cigarette smoke. Smoke of a pungent acrid kind that might have been smoked in the house, but never beyond the kitchens. And it was fresh, too, for a trailing wreath of it hung heavy on the air. Without a doubt somebody was in the morning room. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, Hetty could hear the chink of a glass, the fizz of something aerated. Her heart was beating painfully, but she was not afraid. Dimly, in a mirror opposite, she could see a hand reflected. But she could not see the face. The girl deflected the mirror slightly, so that the head and shoulders of the intruder were dimly focused upon it. \\n\\n \\n\\n A cry rose to her lips, but she stifled it. In a sudden, blind, unreasoning fear she fled noiselessly up the stairs. She had seen that man\u0027s features. It was the face of the man from the Corner House! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59915.html","bookId":519,"book":{"id":519,"title":"The Corner House","description":"简介： A brilliant light streamed from the open doorway of No. 1, Lytton Avenue, making a lane of flame across the pavement, touching pinched gaunt faces that formed a striking contrast to the dazzling scene within.
