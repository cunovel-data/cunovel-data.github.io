{"id":10441,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. TOUCH AND GO.","content":"Balmayne relaxed his grip of the old man\u0027s throat as the knocking was repeated. Some accident might have happened, but on the other hand it was possible that there was some real and tangible danger here. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to go quite so far,\" he muttered. \"Only this time you have made the grand mistake of your life. Be silent now and you shall get your jewels back. It is the only way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maitrank nodded breathlessly. He did not lack pluck, but he was an old man and the rapidity of events dazed him. All the glittering electrics in the room were whirling like a wheel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going away till I\u0027ve got them,\" he said doggedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Balmayne hastened to the door. He might want some ready lie; on the other hand, his diplomacy might be needed. But he set his teeth a trifle closer as he saw Dr. Bruce standing there. \"I have been called,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In that case come this way,\" Balmayne replied. He dared not ask a direct question. He was racking his brains to know who had summoned the doctor, and why. \"There is nothing the matter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I did not gather that from Miss Lawrence\u0027s message,\" said Bruce uneasily. \\n\\n \\n\\n Balmayne concealed a smile. He had got it. There was only one way in which Hetty could have summoned her lover, and that was by means of the telephone. That there was such an instrument in the house he knew quite well. And why did Hetty Lawrence do this thing? Was she merely frightened, or had she learnt a great deal more than the conspirators imagined? \\n\\n \\n\\n In the garden she might have seen a great deal. She might have heard a great deal, too, as Balmayne was bound to admit. But then when she had disclosed herself in the garden her face was quite tranquil, there had been nothing on it but a certain natural surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was impossible to suspect Hetty of being an actress. The girl was too open and natural for that. And in his queer way Balmayne admired the gentle womanliness of an innocent girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still, it was just as well to be on the safe side. There must be no suspicion that there had been any foul play here. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Lawrence meant well,\" Balmayne said, \"but really there was no occasion to send for you at all. A mere accident.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bruce bowed. He knew that he had done a foolish thing in betraying the fact that Hetty had sent for him. And her message would not have been in the nature of a prayer had not the need been urgent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shall see our friend presently,\" Balmayne went on. \"Herr Maitrank--I mean the Countess\u0027s friend--made a late call here. I had occasion to go out after he had left and found him lying unconscious in the road. Whilst there it seemed he was robbed of certain valuables. He was so good as to suggest that it might have been here that he lost his gems--I mean his valuables.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The fellow was lying smoothly enough, but Bruce knew that he was lying. There would be awkward explanations presently, when Hetty Lawrence came to speak; for instance, how would it tally with the pretty story that Balmayne was bringing the unconscious form of Maitrank by the garden gate when he was found in the street? \\n\\n \\n\\n But already Balmayne was prepared for that. His luminous cunning brain saw the whole way clear. To save the situation a great sacrifice would have to be made. A coup de théatre was necessary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps it was as well that Miss Lawrence took matters in her own hands and sent for you,\" he said thoughtfully. \"At any rate, your presence may get us out of a certain degree of responsibility. The patient, if I may so call him, is quieter now, and you will have no difficulty with him. Of course, that is if he will see you at all. If not you will acquit us of any discourtesy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bruce bowed again. He would have given a good deal to know what the other was driving at. Was there any real meaning in the chatter, or was it all for the purpose of delay? Bruce hinted that it was late. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you want to get home,\" Balmayne cried. \"Pardon me. I will go and see if they are ready for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He passed out, closing the door behind him. Then he sneezed loudly twice, and instantly Leona Lalage appeared at the head of the stairs. He flew up to her silently on the thick carpet and laid his lips to her ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dr. Bruce is here,\" he whispered. \"That little fool of a governess of yours took it in her head to call him on the telephone. Of course, she knows nothing, but if Bruce and our friend Maitrank meet, goodness knows what will happen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see, I see,\" the Countess replied. \"If we could only scheme some plan----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have a plan already arranged. It requires a great sacrifice, but you will have to make it. Give me those diamonds.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What, the diamonds that have caused all this trouble to get. Never!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Give me the gems,\" Balmayne said doggedly. \"Everything depends upon you doing what I tell you now. Besides, we shall get them back again. By sheer force of circumstances the tables have been turned in Maitrank\u0027s favour. Give me the gems!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He spoke fiercely, with his eyes gleaming. He saw the heave of Leona\u0027s magnificent white breast, the look of anger on her face. And meanwhile the precious minutes were stealing on rapidly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well,\" he said, \"then I shall wash my hands of the whole business. Fool, do you want to stand in the dock? And there are other dupes with not a tithe of the wit and brains of Maitrank. The gems!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Countess turned on her heel, and disappeared. A moment later, and she was back with the glittering stream of fire in her hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There,\" she whispered. \"Take them. It is the bitterest moment of my life for----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Balmayne stopped to hear no more, but hurried quickly down the stairs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59943.html","bookId":519,"book":{"id":519,"title":"The Corner House","description":"简介： A brilliant light streamed from the open doorway of No. 1, Lytton Avenue, making a lane of flame across the pavement, touching pinched gaunt faces that formed a striking contrast to the dazzling scene within.
