{"id":10435,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. THE BLACK MOTOR.","content":"A certain sense of elation had taken possession of Hetty. She had been tried in the fire, and she had not been found wanting. She had done her work well, and she knew it. And she was not quite satisfied. Things were going on here that she ought to know. At any moment she might come across important information that would be of the greatest use to Gordon. She no longer had the slightest doubt that the Countess was at the bottom of the business that threatened to deprive him of his good name. \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as the weakness was passed, she followed Leona Lalage. She heard the latter fumbling with the sash of the drawing-room window, she felt the sudden rush of air. The owner of the house had barely reached the garden before Hetty was after her. It was all for Gordon\u0027s sake, she told herself; for him she would do anything. \\n\\n \\n\\n She crept on until the green door in the wall was reached. It was risky to peep out, but Hetty had to hazard that. The black motor car was in front of her, so that she was behind the gleaming lights. With a thrill Hetty recognized that motor. It was the same one that she had seen leaving the Corner House on the morning of the murder. She was destined to see more of it before long. But she saw other things; she saw Leona tear the skirt of her dress away; a wild cry of surprise rose to her lips, but she choked it down. Here before her was the Spanish woman of Gordon\u0027s story. The sudden flood of light set Hetty trembling from head to foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the present she was not destined to obtain further information. The big gates of the courtyard of the Corner House was closed upon her. But she waited. Wit! Her little white teeth shut together; she would have waited there all night. She heard Lalage\u0027s sudden cry; she heard the muttered conversation that followed. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was only just in time to get back behind the green gates when the Countess emerged again with something in her hand. Her head was held high, her eyes gleamed with triumph. Then the great black car shot noiselessly away, and Hetty crept back to the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n She managed to gain her bedroom unseen, she stood with a fast-beating heart at the head of the landing listening. All the servants had gone to bed long ago, there were only one or two of the electrics burning. \\n\\n \\n\\n A moment later Countess Lalage came out of her bedroom and swept down the stairs. All signs of her disguise had gone; she was dressed from head to foot in a new and magnificent gown, black set off with red, her diamonds flashed and streamed in the light. Evidently the adventures of the night were not over, for the Countess would not have taken all that trouble had she not expected some one. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hetty crept back to her room and softly closed the door. She could hear the snap of the electric switches as Leona Lalage proceeded from room to room downstairs until the whole place was brilliant with light. Evidently some one was to be welcomed royally. And crime and light do not go very well together. \\n\\n \\n\\n Or perhaps it was a crime. With all the servants in bed anybody alone with Leona Lalage and Balmayne would have a dangerous time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must see further into this,\" Hetty told herself. \"When this honoured guest comes I will creep downstairs and listen. It\u0027s not a very nice thing to do, but if ever the end justifies the means, surely this is a case in point.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She had to listen and wait a long time. Meanwhile the black motor was throbbing its way to Charing Cross. It was quite late as it passed under the archway into the station. But, strange to say, the motor was no longer black, but it gleamed with lacquer and steel and brass like the perfect beauty that it was. \\n\\n \\n\\n There were only a few passengers by the train, one an old bent man with a grey moustache and a hooked nose coming down over it. His boots and hat and gloves were shabby enough, but his fur-lined overcoat, which he wore in spite of the warm night, was a magnificent garment of real sable. He stepped along the platform absently. As he looked round for a cab, Balmayne hailed him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can I be of any service to you, Herr Maitrank?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n The little man\u0027s eyes twinkled shrewdly. He seemed to be amused about something. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What a lucky meeting,\" he exclaimed. \"If that is your motor you can drive me to the Metropole and sup with me. You are a clever young man, so clever that you will not pretend this meeting is an accident.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to try and deceive you,\" said Balmayne. \"I\u0027m going to play the game with all the cards on the table.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So? Then you know why I am here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. You have come to look into Countess Lalage\u0027s affairs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With a view to saving myself the loss of many thousand pounds. The money itself would not make much difference to me, but I love my money. To make it is the whole end and aim of my life. Lie to me, deceive me, abuse me, anything you like, and I care nothing. But rob me of money, ah!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The little beady eyes gleamed angrily, the speaker spat furiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I found out by chance,\" he went on. \"A bit of good luck showed me how I had been swindled. But I said nothing--ah, I said nothing, because in this case silence is golden! And nobody knows but myself. Thinks I, that woman is a long way from being played out yet--she has resources. Some people would have made a fuss and cried out and spoilt everything, but not so Maitrank. I come here to get my money and I shall have it, mark you. But I am not easy in my mind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About your money, Herr Maitrank?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About my money! No. I shall get that all right. What I am uneasy about is this: How did you know I was coming, and why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Balmayne shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is my affair,\" he said. \"Perhaps I have been prepared for this--perhaps I have had a watch kept on you. But no matter. We have had time and we are ready. Will you come and see the Countess now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maitrank hesitated a moment and nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It will give me a good supper free,\" he said, \"and a glass of wine. And if you try any tricks on me, heaven help you, for I won\u0027t!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59937.html","bookId":519,"book":{"id":519,"title":"The Corner House","description":"简介： A brilliant light streamed from the open doorway of No. 1, Lytton Avenue, making a lane of flame across the pavement, touching pinched gaunt faces that formed a striking contrast to the dazzling scene within.
