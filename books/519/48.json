{"id":10457,"no":48,"title":"CHAPTER XLVIII. HETTY SPEAKS OUT.","content":"There was a good deal of whispering and talking in corners and under the trees at Longmere House. A fussy little man with an eyeglass seemed to have a great deal to say. Lady Longmere laughed somewhat scornfully as she watched him. A great pile of strawberries were on her plate. \n \n \"I have a great many faults,\" the pretty American heiress said, \"but scandal never was one of them. Look at that little wretch of a Mosley Harcourt. Nobody likes him, and nobody is free from his poisonous tongue, but he goes everywhere because he has the very latest gossip.\" \n \n Hetty nodded absently; in society parlance Lady Longmere had taken Hetty up. Since the night of the card party at Lytton Avenue, when her ladyship had foresworn cards for good and all, she had seen a good deal of Hetty. And she was one of the few who stuck loyally to Bruce. \n \n \"Here\u0027s your young man,\" she said presently. \"He didn\u0027t want to come, but I made a special journey and persuaded him. Never hide yourself at times like this.\" \n \n \"Gordon is very sensitive,\" said Hetty. \"That\u0027s the kind of thing that hurts.\" \n \n She clutched at the handle of her sunshade passionately as a society leader responded to Bruce\u0027s uplifted hat by a cold stare. \n \n \"And Gordon saved that woman\u0027s life,\" Hetty said. \"He sat up all one night with her and part of the second. It\u0027s very hard, Lady Longmere.\" \n \n Lady Longmere replied generally that it would benefit Bruce in the long run. Lady Rockingham came up and said it was very hot. After his rebuff Bruce stood by as if unconscious of Lady Rockingham\u0027s presence. \n \n \"Surely your ladyship knows Dr. Bruce!\" Hetty said with a vivid splash of colour on either cheek \"A little time ago I understood that Dr. Bruce----\" \n \n \"Dr. Bruce perfectly understands,\" Lady Rockingham said coldly. \n \n \"But you evidently don\u0027t,\" Hetty said coolly. \"I was going to give your ladyship a little information. I fancy you were present at Lytton Avenue the night of the card party when those mysterious notes were produced. It was never known exactly who paid them over to Mr. Isidore, but I know now. They came from Countess Lalage; indeed, she admitted as much to my uncle, Mr. Lawrence.\" \n \n Bruce drew Hetty gently away. The girl was sore and angry, and might be betrayed into saying something that she would be sorry for afterwards. After all, it did not matter much so long as they had one another. \n \n The grounds were large and secluded; there were plenty of spots there for lovers. They might have been far away in the country. \n \n \"I have been talking to Lawrence,\" Bruce said. \"My dear little girl, I have only learnt lately what you have endured for me. If these people had found you out they would most certainly have murdered you.\" \n \n Hetty smiled lightly. She had her own reward. It would be mainly due to her that her lover\u0027s good name would be cleared. \n \n \"But it makes my blood boil to see you treated in that way by that woman,\" she cried, \"especially after what you did for her. I long to tell her who the real culprit was, and that in a few days a woman in whose house she had been would be arrested for the crime.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t,\" Bruce smiled. \"What a sensation those good people will have presently! And most of them have been on intimate terms with our Countess. My darling, I shall never be easy in my mind till you are out of that house.\" \n \n \"And I shall never go till I can make some arrangements for Mamie,\" Hetty said. \"Of course the secret cannot be kept much longer, and then I suppose everything will be seized by the creditors. But even the servants are in the dark as yet.\" \n \n Bruce nodded moodily. He seemed to have something on his mind that he could not throw off. The cloud lifted a little under Hetty\u0027s blandishments; it was impossible to sit looking into those clear eyes and be wholly unhappy. \n \n \"You have some trouble,\" Hetty said anxiously. \n \n \"I have,\" Gordon said, \"but I shan\u0027t tell it to you today. Let us talk of something else. Let us forget the world for ourselves.\" \n \n A band was playing somewhere; there were voices pitched high close by; then came the clear laugh of Lady Longmere. \n \n \"Say, what a comedy!\" she said. \"What does it matter? It will be something to say afterwards that we knew the woman.\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" said Lady Rockingham. \"Mr. Harcourt, are you quite clear and certain of your facts? Who told you?\" \n \n \"Shouldn\u0027t dare to speak thus of the fascinating Lalage,\" Harcourt, the little man with the eyeglass, drawled. \"Should be afraid of a knife in my back, or something horribly Corsican of that kind. Can\u0027t tell you any more except I know the police had a warrant for her arrest, and that she\u0027s bolted.\" \n \n \"And she\u0027s got a diamond star of mine worth a thousand pounds!\" Lady Rockingham screamed. \"A stone was missing, and she offered to have it replaced for me out of her stock of loose diamonds. I made a friend of that woman, a vulgar adventuress, who steals brooches and the like.\" \n \n \"Be a lesson to us all,\" Harcourt said sapiently, \"for at least a month. And then we shall run after the next flashy adventurer who comes along. Give me the money, and I\u0027ll put any gutter flower-girl in society, and at the top of all in a month. It\u0027s only a question of cash.\" \n \n The speaker passed on. Hetty seemed amused about something. \n \n \"So the story has leaked out,\" she said. \"But it has its funny side. Fancy Leona Lalage getting Lady Rockingham\u0027s star like that! It was the sort of cynical thing she would have enjoyed.\" \n \n Bruce held up his hand for silence. \n \n \"What are the boys saying in Piccadilly?\" he asked. \n \n The cries came nearer; a familiar name was mentioned. \n \n \"Latest society scandal!\" came the shrill voices. \"Latest society sensation! Flight of the Countess Lalage!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59959.html","bookId":519,"book":{"id":519,"title":"The Corner House","description":"简介： A brilliant light streamed from the open doorway of No. 1, Lytton Avenue, making a lane of flame across the pavement, touching pinched gaunt faces that formed a striking contrast to the dazzling scene within.
