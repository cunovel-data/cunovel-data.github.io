{"id":16813,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV. EDGAR GETS INTO TROUBLE.","content":"While Solon Talbot was intent upon making money, his son Edgar was left to spend his time pretty much as he pleased. His father had secured him a place with a firm of brokers in Wall Street, in fact in the office of Crane \u0026 Lawton, through whom he intended to dispose of his mining stocks. Edgar received five dollars a week, and this his father allowed him to keep for himself. But five dollars a week in a city like New York won\u0027t go very far when a boy gives up his evenings to playing pool. One night Edgar made the acquaintance of a showy young man whom he ignorantly supposed belonged to a prominent New York family. It was in fact our old acquaintance, Hamilton Schuyler, with whom Mark had already had some experiences which did not impress him very much in the young man\u0027s favor. Schuyler\u0027s attention was drawn to Edgar at a pool-room in the neighborhood of Forty-Second Street, and he made inquiries about him. Ascertaining that Edgar\u0027s father was supposed to be rich he cultivated his acquaintance, and flattered him artfully. \"You play a good game of billiards, Mr. Talbot,\" he said. \"Oh, fair,\" answered Edgar complacently. \"Do you mind having a game with me?\" \"You probably play a good deal better than I do.\" \"We can try and see. By the way, let me introduce myself,\" and he handed Edgar his card. \"Schuyler Hamilton!\" read Edgar, \"that is an old name, is it not?\" \"Yes,\" answered Schuyler carelessly. \"I am related to most of the old Knickerbocker families. I am very particular whom I associate with, but I saw at once that you were a gentleman.\" Foolish Edgar was very much flattered. \"My father is a capitalist,\" he said. \"We used to live in Syracuse, but he thinks he can make more money in New York.\" \"Just so. There are plenty of chances of making money here. I made five thousand dollars in Wall Street last week myself.\" \"You did!\" exclaimed Edgar dazzled. \"Yes. Sometimes I have made more. I don\u0027t often lose. Which ball will you select. The spot?\" \"Yes.\" \"I suppose it takes considerable money to speculate in Wall Street?\" \"Oh no, not on a margin.\" \"I should like to make a strike myself. I am in the office of Crane \u0026 Lawton.\" \"Are you indeed? I never did any business with them, but I understand that they stand very high.\" \"I think they are rich.\" The game was played, and resulted in the success of Edgar. \"Really, you play a strong game. Suppose—just for the excitement of it—we stake a dollar on the next game. What do you say?\" \"All right!\" Edgar had received his week\u0027s pay in the afternoon, and was well provided. He flattered himself he could play better than Schuyler, and thought it would be very agreeable to win money in that way. Schuyler managed to let him win. \"Really,\" he said with pretended annoyance, \"I am afraid you are more than a match for me.\" \"Perhaps I was lucky,\" said Edgar, elated. \"At any rate I will try again. Let us call it two dollars.\" \"Very well,\" assented Edgar. Somehow this game was won by his opponent by five points. Edgar was annoyed, for this took a dollar from his pocket, and it had been arranged that the loser should pay for the use of the tables. It was an accident, however, and he kept on. At the close of the evening he was without a cent. \"I have been unlucky,\" he said, trying to hide his mortification. \"I have lost all the money I had with me.\" \"That is too bad. Here, give me a memorandum for two dollars, and I will hand you back that amount. Some time when you are in funds you can pay me.\" \"Thank you!\" said Edgar in a tone of relief. \"You are really a better player than I am,\" went on Schuyler, \"but the balls happened to run in my favor. Another evening I shall be the loser.\" This was the first of Edgar\u0027s acquaintance with Schuyler Hamilton, but it was by no means the last. They got into the way of meeting nearly every night and Edgar ran more and more into Schuyler\u0027s debt. However, Hamilton was very easy with him. He accepted memorandums of indebtedness, which somehow seemed a very easy way of paying debts. Edgar did not reflect that a day of reckoning must come at last. At last Hamilton Schuyler thought it time to bring matters to a crisis. \"Do you know how much you are owing me, Edgar?\" he said one evening. \"No,\" answered Edgar uneasily. \"Seventy-five dollars!\" \"It can\u0027t be!\" exclaimed Edgar, incredulous. \"These things increase faster than you think for,\" said Schuyler carelessly. \"I suppose you\u0027ll let it run,\" remarked Edgar with a troubled look. \"I should be glad to do so, my dear boy, but I need the money. I was hit rather hard at the races yesterday, and the long and short of it is, that you will have to pay me.\" \"I can\u0027t pay you,\" said Edgar doggedly. Schuyler frowned. \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded sternly. \"I mean exactly what I say. I haven\u0027t got any money. I only get five dollars a week, and I can\u0027t spare any of that.\" \"You\u0027ve got to get the money. You had no business to bet if you couldn\u0027t pay.\" \"I never did bet till I got acquainted with you.\" \"Enough of this, boy!\" said Hamilton, waving his hand in a dignified manner. \"I shall have to lay the matter before your father.\" \"No, don\u0027t do that! He wouldn\u0027t let me keep my wages.\" \"That is your affair, not mine. Can\u0027t you tell him you want to pay a tailor\u0027s bill, and get the money that way?\" \"No; I get my clothes charged at his tailor\u0027s.\" \"Oh, well, I don\u0027t care how you get it as long as you do get it. Doesn\u0027t your father leave any money lying about in his desk or in his bureau drawers?\" \"No. Besides, you don\u0027t want me to steal, do you?\" \"Not if you can get the money any other way.\" \"Look here, Mr. Schuyler, I thought you were rich. How do you happen to be in want of seventy-five dollars?\" \"Anybody might be short of money. One day when I was traveling in the Adirondacks, I met a rich man—a millionaire—who was in trouble. \u0027I say, Schuyler,\u0027 he said to me, \u0027can you loan me a hundred dollars. I give you my word I am almost penniless, and no one knows me here.\u0027 Now I happened to have three hundred dollars in my pocketbook, and I at once produced it and lent him the money. You see even a millionaire can get into a money scrape.\" \"Who was the millionaire?\" asked Edgar, who was not quite so credulous a believer of Schuyler\u0027s pictures as formerly. \"I don\u0027t feel at liberty to tell. It would not be honorable. But to come back to our own business! You must make some arrangement to pay me.\" \"Tell me how,\" said Edgar sulkily. \"Don\u0027t you deposit for your firm in the Park Bank?\" \"Yes.\" \"Always checks?\" \"Sometimes there are bank bills.\" Schuyler bent over and whispered in Edgar\u0027s ear. Edgar flushed and then looked nervous and agitated. \"You ask me to do that,\" he said. \"Yes, there is no danger. Say you lost the bills in the street.\" Edgar was not a conscientious boy or a boy of high principle, but this suggestion shocked him. \"Would you ruin me?\" he asked. \"I would have you pay me what you owe me. If you don\u0027t there will be a fuss.\" \"I wish I had never met you, Mr. Schuyler,\" said poor Edgar bitterly. \"I have been disappointed in you,\" said Schuyler coldly. \"I thought you were the son of a gentleman and a gentleman yourself.\" \"Who says I am not?\" \"I don\u0027t. I expect you to behave like one. Good night.\" This interview took place on Fifth Avenue not far from Delmonico\u0027s café. When the two parted another boy, who had been following at a little distance, moved rapidly forward and placed his hand on Edgar\u0027s shoulder. \"Cousin Edgar,\" he said. Edgar turned. \"Mark!\" he said, not with his old hauteur, for trouble had humbled his pride. \"Yes. Who was that you were walking with?\" asked Mark. \"No one you know. He is Mr. Schuyler, from one of the best New York families.\" Mark smiled. \"I hope you have no business with him,\" he said. \"I owe him seventy-five dollars, and I don\u0027t know how on earth I am going to pay him.\" \"What do you owe him that for?\" \"For bets on games of billiards.\" \"This Hamilton Schuyler, as he calls himself, is an adventurer, a swindler, and a thief. His family is not as good as yours or mine.\" \"Is this true?\" asked Edgar stupefied. \"Yes. Don\u0027t trouble yourself about what you owe him. Appoint a meeting for him to-morrow evening at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. I will go there and meet him with you. I\u0027ll get you out of your scrape.\" \"Do that, Mark, and I\u0027ll be your friend for life. I\u0027ll never treat you meanly again.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2989/82453.html","bookId":323,"book":{"id":323,"title":"Mark Mason\u0027s Victory","description":"简介： The speaker was a man of middle age, with a thin face and a nose like a Hawk.
