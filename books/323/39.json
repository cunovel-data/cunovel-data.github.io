{"id":16817,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIX. CONCLUSION.","content":"Solon Talbot went home in high spirits. It was only recently that he had become aware of the great value of the Golden Hope shares. It had come to him as an agreeable surprise. \"With what I was worth before,\" he soliloquized, \"I may now rate myself at one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That is very good—for a beginning. I can afford to buy the house in Forty-Seventh Street, for I shall still have a hundred thousand dollars over, and in five years I mean to make it half a million.\" He paced up and down his library in a state of joyous excitement. No thought of giving his sister-in-law her rightful due entered his mind. \"How can she find out?\" he reflected. \"Old Mr. Doane never told any of us of his mining shares. I presume he looked upon them as rather a risky investment. It has proved to be a splendid speculation, but it was rather a lucky accident than a shrewd purchase.\" \"\u0027Mark!\u0027 exclaimed Talbot. What brings you here!\"—Page 303. Mark Mason\u0027s Victory. \"\u0027Mark!\u0027 exclaimed Talbot. What brings you here!\"—Page 303. Mark Mason\u0027s Victory. It was after breakfast on the morning succeeding the sale of stock. Mr. Talbot was preparing to go over to the house which he proposed to purchase for a last examination before making up his mind, when the servant entered the library. \"There is a boy down-stairs wishes to see you, Mr. Talbot,\" he said. \"Perhaps a boy from Crane \u0026 Lawton,\" he reflected. \"Show him up.\" Directly afterwards Mark Mason entered the room. \"Mark!\" exclaimed Talbot. \"What brings you here!\" \"A matter of business, Uncle Solon.\" \"Then you will have to wait, for I am just going out.\" \"The business is important,\" said Mark significantly. \"Well, what is it?\" \"I understand you sold yesterday the shares in the Golden Hope Mine belonging to grandfather\u0027s estate.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Solon Talbot, his face showing his surprise and dismay. \"There were four hundred shares, and they were sold to Luther Rockwell, the banker.\" \"Who told you this? Have you had any communication from Crane \u0026 Lawton?\" \"No; though I know the sale was made through them.\" Solon Talbot paused long enough to pull himself together. It would never do to surrender at discretion. He would brazen it out to the last. \"Your information is partly true,\" he said. \"I did sell some shares of mining stock, but they belonged to me. You have nothing to do with them.\" \"Uncle Solon,\" said Mark composedly, \"it is useless to try to deceive me. The four hundred shares were bought by my grandfather, and belonged to his estate. Half of the proceeds rightfully belongs to my mother.\" Spots of perspiration stood on Solon Talbot\u0027s brow. Should he allow fifty thousand dollars to slip from his grasp? \"You audacious boy!\" he exclaimed. \"How dare you make such an assertion?\" \"Because I happen to know that the four hundred shares stood in the name of my grandfather, Elisha Doane.\" \"That is a lie. May I ask where you got this information?\" \"From the purchaser of the stock, Luther Rockwell.\" \"What do you know of Luther Rockwell?\" demanded Solon Talbot, incredulous. \"He is one of my best friends. Before buying the shares of the Golden Hope Mine he asked my advice.\" \"Do you expect me to believe such ridiculous stuff? What could you know about the mine?\" \"I have recently returned from California. On the way I stopped in Nevada, and I have in my pocket a statement signed by the secretary of the company, that four hundred shares of the stock stood in the name of my grandfather.\" It was a series of surprises. Solon Talbot walked up and down the library in a state of nervous agitation. \"What do you expect me to do?\" he added finally. \"This letter will inform you, Uncle Solon.\" \"From whom is it?\" \"From my lawyer, George Gerrish.\" Mr. Gerrish, as Mr. Talbot knew, was one of the leaders of the bar. He opened it with trembling hands, and read the following: \"Mr. Solon Talbot: \"Dear Sir: \"My client, Mark Mason, authorizes me to demand of you an accounting of the sums received by you as executor of the estate of his late grandfather, Elisha Doane, to the end that his mother, co-heiress with your wife, may receive her proper shares of the estate. An early answer will oblige, \"Yours respectfully, \"George Gerrish.\" \"Do you know Mr. Gerrish well, too?\" asked Talbot. \"No, sir, but Mr. Rockwell gave me a note to him. I have had an interview with him.\" \"Say to him that he will hear from me.\" Mark bowed and withdrew. Within a week Solon Talbot had agreed to make over to his sister-in-law, Mrs. Mason, a sum of over fifty thousand dollars, representing her share of her father\u0027s estate. He reconsidered his purpose of buying the house in West Forty-Seventh Street, and decided to remain in the flat which he then occupied. Mrs. Mason and Mark took a handsome flat up town, and henceforth were able to live as well as their pretentious relatives. Mark was advised by Mr. Rockwell as to the investment of his mother\u0027s money, and it has already increased considerably. He is himself taking a mercantile course at a commercial college, and will eventually enter the establishment of Mr. Gilbert, with whom he is as great a favorite as ever. It never rains but it pours. One morning Mrs. Mack, the aged miser, was found dead in bed. She left a letter directing Mark to call on her lawyer. To his surprise he found that he was left sole heir to the old lady\u0027s property, amounting to about five thousand dollars. \"What shall I do with it, mother?\" he asked. \"I have no rightful claim to it. She only left it to me that her nephew might not get it.\" \"Keep it till he gets out of prison, and then help him judiciously if he deserves it. Meanwhile invest it and give the income to charity.\" Mark was glad that he was able to follow this advice. Jack Minton is still in jail, and it is to be feared that his prison life will not reform him, but Mark means to give him a chance when he is released. Through Mark\u0027s influence, his old friend, Tom Trotter, has been taken into a mercantile establishment where his natural sharpness is likely to help him to speedy promotion. Mark has agreed to pay his mother\u0027s rent for the next three years, and has given Tom a present of two hundred dollars besides. He is not one of those who in prosperity forget their humble friends. And now after some years of privation and narrow means Mrs. Mason and Mark seem in a fair way to see life on its sunny side. I hope my readers will agree that they merit their good fortune. On the other hand, Mr. Talbot has lost a part of his money by injudicious speculation, and his once despised sister-in-law is now the richer of the two. Edgar has got rid of his snobbishness and through Mark\u0027s friendship is likely to grow up an estimable member of society.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2989/82457.html","bookId":323,"book":{"id":323,"title":"Mark Mason\u0027s Victory","description":"简介： The speaker was a man of middle age, with a thin face and a nose like a Hawk.
