{"id":16786,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. A SCENE IN MRS. MACK\u0027S ROOM.","content":"Fifteen minutes before a stout, ill-dressed man of perhaps forty years of age knocked at the door of Mrs. Mack\u0027s room. \"Come in!\" called the old lady in quavering accents. The visitor opened the door and entered. \"Who are you?\" asked the old lady in alarm. \"Don\u0027t you know me, Aunt Jane?\" replied the intruder. \"I\u0027m Jack Minton, your nephew.\" \"I don\u0027t want to see you—go away!\" cried Mrs. Mack. \"That\u0027s a pretty way to receive your own sister\u0027s son, whom you haven\u0027t seen for five years.\" \"I haven\u0027t seen you because you\u0027ve been in jail,\" retorted his aunt in a shrill voice. \"Yes, I was took for another man,\" said Jack. \"He stole and laid it off on to me.\" \"I don\u0027t care how it was, but I don\u0027t want to see you. Go away!\" \"Look here, Aunt Jane, you\u0027re treating me awful mean. I\u0027m your own orphan nephew, and you ought to make much of me.\" \"An orphan—yes. You hurried your poor mother to the grave by your bad conduct,\" said Mrs. Mack with some emotion. \"You won\u0027t find me so soft as she was.\" \"Soft? No, you\u0027re as hard as flint, but all the same you\u0027re my aunt, and you\u0027re rich, while I haven\u0027t a dollar to bless myself with.\" \"Rich! Me rich!\" repeated the old lady shrilly. \"You see how I live. Does it look as if I was rich?\" \"Oh, you can\u0027t humbug me that way. You could live better if you wanted to.\" \"I\u0027m poor—miserably poor!\" returned the old woman. \"I\u0027d like to be as poor as you are!\" said Jack Minton grimly. \"You\u0027re a miser, that\u0027s all there is about it. You half starve yourself and live without fire, when you might be comfortable, and all to save money. You\u0027re a fool! Do you know where all your money will go when you\u0027re dead?\" \"There won\u0027t be any left.\" \"Won\u0027t there? I\u0027ll take the risk of that, for I shall be your heir. It\u0027ll all go to me!\" said Jack, chuckling. \"Go away! Go away!\" cried the terrified old woman wildly. \"I want to have a little talk with you first, aunt,\" said Jack, drawing the only other chair in the room in front of Mrs. Mack and sitting down on it. \"You\u0027re my only relation, and we ought to have an understanding. Why, you can\u0027t live more than a year or two—at your age.\" \"What do you mean?\" said Mrs Mack angrily. \"I\u0027m good for ten years. I\u0027m only seventy-seven.\" \"You\u0027re living on borrowed time, Aunt Jane, you know that yourself. You\u0027ve lived seven years beyond the regular term, and you can\u0027t live much longer.\" \"Go away! Go away!\" said the terrified old woman, really alarmed at her nephew\u0027s prediction. \"I don\u0027t want to have anything to do with you.\" \"Don\u0027t forget that I\u0027m your heir.\" \"I can leave my money as I please—not that I\u0027ve got much to leave.\" \"You mean you\u0027ll make a will? Well, go ahead and do it. There was a man I know made a will and he died the next day.\" This shot struck home, for the old woman really had a superstitious dread of making a will. \"You\u0027re a terrible man!\" she moaned. \"You scare me.\" \"Come, aunt, be reasonable. You can leave part of your money away from me if you like, but I want you to help me now. I\u0027m hard up. Do you see this nickel?\" and he drew one from his vest pocket. \"Yes.\" \"Well, it\u0027s all the money I\u0027ve got. Why, I haven\u0027t eaten anything to-day, and I have no money to pay for a bed.\" \"I—I haven\u0027t any supper for you.\" \"I don\u0027t want any here. I wouldn\u0027t care to board with you, Aunt Jane. Why, I should soon become a bag of bones like yourself. I don\u0027t believe you\u0027ve got five cents\u0027 worth of provisions in the room.\" \"There\u0027s half a loaf of bread in the closet.\" \"Let me take a look at it.\" He strode to the closet and opened the door. On a shelf he saw half a loaf of bread, dry and stale. He took it in his hand, laughing. \"Why, that bread is three days\u0027 old,\" he said. \"Where\u0027s your butter?\" \"I—I don\u0027t eat butter. It\u0027s too high!\" \"And you don\u0027t care to live high!\" said Jack, laughing at his own joke. \"I don\u0027t care to rob you of this bread, Aunt Jane. It\u0027s too rich for my blood. Don\u0027t you ever eat anything else?\" \"Sometimes,\" she answered, hesitating. \"I\u0027d rather take my supper at the cheapest restaurant on the Bowery. What I want is money.\" Mrs. Mack uttered a little cry of alarm. \"Oh, don\u0027t go into a fit, aunt! I only want a little, just to get along till I can find work. Give me twenty-five dollars, and I won\u0027t come near you again for a month. I swear it.\" \"Twenty-five dollars!\" ejaculated Mrs. Mack in dismay. \"Do you think I am made of money?\" \"I don\u0027t take you for an Astor or a Vanderbilt, Aunt Jane, but you\u0027ve got a tidy lot of money somewhere—that I am sure of. I shouldn\u0027t wonder if you had five thousand dollars. Now where do you keep it?\" \"Have you taken leave of your senses?\" asked the old woman sharply. \"No, I haven\u0027t, but it looks to me as if you had. But I can\u0027t waste my time here all night. I\u0027m your only relative, and it\u0027s your duty to help me. Will you let me have twenty-five dollars or not?\" \"No, I won\u0027t,\" answered Mrs. Mack angrily. \"Then I\u0027ll take the liberty of helping myself if I can find where you keep your hoards.\" Jack Minton jumped up from his chair and went at once to a cheap bureau, which, however, was probably the most valuable article in the room, and pulling out the top drawer, began to rummage about among the contents. Then it was that Mrs. Mack uttered the piercing shriek referred to at the end of the last chapter, and her nephew, tramping across the floor, seized her roughly by the shoulder. \"What do you mean by this noise, you old fool?\" he demanded roughly. \"Help! Murder! Thieves!\" screamed the old woman. Then the door opened, and Mark Mason burst into the room, followed by Tom Trotter. \"What\u0027s the matter, Mrs. Mack?\" asked Mark. \"This man is going to rob me,\" answered the old woman. \"Oh, save me!\" \"It\u0027s a lie!\" said Jack Minton. \"Just ask this woman who I am. She knows.\" \"Who is he, Mrs. Mack?\" \"It is my nephew, Jack Minton. He——\" \"Do you hear that? I\u0027m her nephew, come in to make her a call after a long time.\" \"What are you doing to her?\" demanded Mark suspiciously. \"Trying to stop her infernal racket. You\u0027d think I was murdering her by the way she goes on.\" \"What made you scream, Mrs. Mack?\" \"Because he—he was going to rob me.\" \"How is that?\" demanded Mark sternly. \"None of your business, kid! You ain\u0027t no call to interfere between me and my aunt.\" \"I have if she asks me to.\" \"He was at my bureau drawers. He told me I must give him twenty-five dollars.\" \"Supposing I did? It\u0027s the least you can do for your own nephew that hasn\u0027t a cent to bless himself with.\" \"Oh, take him away, Mark! He\u0027ll rob me first and murder me afterwards, and I\u0027m his mother\u0027s only sister.\" \"You see she admits it. She\u0027s rolling in money——\" \"Oh!\" exclaimed Mrs. Mack, throwing up her hands. \"You know I\u0027m poor, Mark Mason.\" \"No, I don\u0027t, Mrs. Mack. I think you\u0027ve got all the money you need, but you have a right to keep it if you want to. Mr. Minton, you had better leave the room. Your aunt is evidently afraid of you, and, old as she is, your staying here may make her sick.\" \"It ain\u0027t much use living, the way she is. Aunt Jane, I ask you again will you lend me twenty-five dollars?\" \"No, no!\" \"Will you lend me five dollars?\" \"No.\" \"Are you going to turn your own nephew out into the street without a cent to buy food or pay for a bed?\" He glowered at his aunt so fiercely as he said this that Mark was afraid he might strangle her. \"Mrs. Mack,\" he said, \"you had better give him something if he is in so much need. Since he is really your nephew, you might give him a dollar on condition that he won\u0027t trouble you again.\" After long persuasion the old woman was induced to do this, though she declared that it would leave her destitute, and send her to the poor-house. \"Now, Mr. Minton,\" said Mark, \"I advise you not to come here again, or I may have to call in a policeman.\" \"I\u0027ve a great mind to throw you down-stairs,\" growled Jack. \"You\u0027d have to throw me too!\" put in Tom Trotter. \"I\u0027d do it with pleasure.\" Jack left the room and steered his way to the nearest saloon, while Mark and Tom returned to the room beneath.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2989/82426.html","bookId":323,"book":{"id":323,"title":"Mark Mason\u0027s Victory","description":"简介： The speaker was a man of middle age, with a thin face and a nose like a Hawk.
