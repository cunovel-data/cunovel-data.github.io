{"id":16810,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. NAHUM SPRAGUE\u0027S SURPRISE.","content":"Philip waited impatiently from supper-time till half-past nine o\u0027clock. Fortunately Mr. Sprague and Oscar went to bed rather earlier than usual. On account of Philip\u0027s being locked up some of the \"chores\" which he had been accustomed to do fell to the father and son. So it happened that when it was twenty minutes to eight Mr. Sprague said: \"I feel sleepy. I think I shall turn in now.\" \"I am sleepy too, pa,\" said Oscar. \"I wonder how Philip feels.\" \"You can sleep with him if you want to,\" said Mr. Sprague jocosely. \"Thank you, dad. You\u0027re very kind, but I don\u0027t care to sleep on the floor. I guess the young beggar will feel pretty sore in the morning.\" \"It\u0027s his own fault,\" said Nahum grimly. \"All the same you\u0027d better let him out to-morrow. I don\u0027t care about doing his chores right along.\" \"I\u0027ll see about that. Whenever he will get down on his knees and beg my pardon he can go free.\" By nine o\u0027clock Mr. and Mrs. Sprague and Oscar were in bed, and by half-past nine all were fast asleep. The whole family were good sleepers, and it may be added for the senior Sprague that he was a good snorer also. Philip posted himself at the window. About five minutes after the time agreed upon he saw in the moonlight his two boy friends approaching, bearing between them a long ladder. His heart leaped within him. They had not forgotten him after all. He stood at the open window and waved his hand. \"There he is, Albert!\" said Arthur Burks. \"I guess he\u0027s glad to see us. We\u0027ll soon have him out of there.\" The two boys came under the window and called up softly: \"Has old Sprague gone to bed?\" \"Yes,\" answered Phil. \"I hear him snoring.\" \"I hope they are all fast asleep,\" said Albert. \"Here, Arthur, you just hold on to the ladder while I raise it.\" \"Do you think it is tall enough?\" asked Arthur. \"I\u0027ll risk it.\" The two boys worked till they had the ladder raised and leaning against the window. \"Will you dare to get out of the window and get down?\" asked Arthur. \"I guess so.\" \"Be very careful. You don\u0027t want to fall.\" Cautiously Phil put out one leg and placed his foot on one rung of the ladder. Then clutching firm hold of the side he put out the other, and now he had both feet on the rung. \"Now come down carefully!\" said Albert. Phil followed directions. He was only ten years old, and he certainly did feel a little timid, but he felt that behind him was a prison and before him was liberty, and he did not hesitate. So rung by rung he cautiously descended, till he stood on the ground beside the ladder in the company of his two friends. \"Bravo, Phil!\" said Arthur Burks. \"You\u0027ve done splendidly. Now, Albert, let\u0027s get away before old Sprague hears us.\" The ladder was carefully taken down, and the two boys walked off with it. Albert at the head and Arthur at the foot, while Phil followed behind. \"We\u0027ll go to your house first, Albert, and take the ladder,\" said Arthur. \"Then Phil will go home with me.\" The two boys lived not far apart, and this arrangement proved convenient. \"I wonder what old Sprague will say in the morning,\" laughed Albert. \"He\u0027ll wonder how in the world Philip got away.\" \"Perhaps he\u0027ll think he jumped out of the window.\" \"How do you feel, Phil?\" asked Arthur. \"I feel pretty hungry.\" \"What did you have for supper?\" \"Two thin slices of bread and a cup of tea.\" \"I guess we\u0027ll find something in the pantry at our house,\" said Arthur, \"unless Rob\u0027s got out of bed and eaten it up.\" By ten o\u0027clock the ladder was replaced and the several boys were safe at home. Arthur was as good as his word. He got out some bread and butter, some cold meat and a glass of milk, and Philip made a hearty meal. \"I haven\u0027t had as good a supper for a long time,\" he said with a deep sigh of satisfaction. \"That\u0027s why you\u0027re so skinny. If we had you here we\u0027d soon fat you up. Now are you ready to go to bed?\" \"Yes, Arthur. How kind you are to me.\" \"I can\u0027t compare with your friend Oscar, Phil.\" \"I hope not. Oscar\u0027s about as mean a boy as I know. He\u0027s very different from you and Albert.\" Meanwhile unconscious of the loss of one of their little household Mr. and Mrs. Sprague and Oscar slumbered on till after sunrise. \"Get up, Oscar!\" called Nahum Sprague, going to his son\u0027s room. \"You must get up.\" \"What must I get up for?\" grumbled Oscar. \"Because you will have to do Philip\u0027s chores this morning.\" \"Why don\u0027t you call him, pa? I don\u0027t see why I should do his work.\" \"Because he is locked up for punishment. I am not ready to let him out yet.\" \"It seems to me I am being punished. He has nothing to do while I have to get up early and work.\" \"Would you be willing to change places with him, be locked up all day, live on bread and water, and sleep on the hard floor?\" \"Well, he\u0027s done it, and now you might let him out and set him to work.\" \"I have already said that I would let him out when he got down on his knees and begged my pardon.\" \"And have I got to do his work till he begs your pardon? I say, that ain\u0027t fair.\" \"I begin to think, Oscar, you are very lazy. I\u0027ll tell you what you may do. When you are dressed you may go to the door of the attic room and ask Philip if he is ready to apologize to me. If he says yes, I\u0027ll go up and receive his apology, and then he can come down and go to work.\" \"All right, pa, I\u0027ll do it. I guess he\u0027s got enough by this time.\" Five minutes later Oscar was at Philip\u0027s door. He had forgotten to bring up the key which his father had taken down-stairs the evening previous. He put his mouth to the keyhole, first rapping at the door to command attention. \"I say, you Phil!\" he called out. There was no answer. Oscar rapped again. \"Philip Lillis!\" he called. For reasons which we understand, though Oscar didn\u0027t, there was no response. Oscar became angry, and began to pound vigorously at the door. \"There, if he doesn\u0027t hear that he must be deaf!\" he said to himself. \"I say, do you want to be let out?\" No answer. \"He hears me, and won\u0027t answer out of pure spite,\" reflected Oscar indignantly. He continued to pound. \"Look here, you young beggar,\" he cried, \"if you don\u0027t answer me I\u0027ll get pa to bring up the horsewhip and flog you within an inch of your life. There won\u0027t be any bar-room loafers to save you this time.\" Even this threat seemed to produce no effect, and Oscar, quite out of temper, descended the stairs. \"Well,\" said Mr. Sprague, \"what does he say?\" \"What does he say? He won\u0027t say anything.\" \"Perhaps he didn\u0027t hear you,\" suggested Mr. Sprague. \"If he didn\u0027t he must be as deaf as a post.\" \"Slickening, is he?\" \"That\u0027s about the size of it.\" \"Well, we can cure him of that.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what to do, pa. I\u0027ll get the horsewhip and you can give him a good thrashing. I told him you would. There won\u0027t be any one to interfere up there.\" \"That\u0027s true. Go and get the whip, Oscar.\" No employment was more congenial. Oscar went down-stairs with alacrity and soon reappeared with the whip. By this time his father was dressed and ready for action. \"Here\u0027s the whip, pa. May I go up with you?\" \"Yes; come up.\" Father and son ascended the stairs and stood before Philip\u0027s door. \"Speak to him first, pa, and see if he will answer you.\" Nahum Sprague in a stern and authoritative tone called \"Philip.\" No answer. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you, pa.\" \"Philip Lillis!\" Again no reply. \"I didn\u0027t think the boy would be so owdacious. I\u0027ll soon learn him!\" Mr. Sprague turned the key and opened the door, entering the room with upraised whip. He gave a gasp of surprise. \"Why, he isn\u0027t here!\" he ejaculated. \"Isn\u0027t here?\" shouted Oscar in amazement. \"No; and the winder is open,\" exclaimed Mr. Sprague. \"He wouldn\u0027t dare to jump out, would he?\" Nahum Sprague advanced to the window and put his head out, expecting to see Philip on the ground beneath, perhaps with a broken limb. But no Philip was visible! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2989/82450.html","bookId":323,"book":{"id":323,"title":"Mark Mason\u0027s Victory","description":"简介： The speaker was a man of middle age, with a thin face and a nose like a Hawk.
