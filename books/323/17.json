{"id":16795,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. MARK MAKES A CALL ON EUCLID AVENUE.","content":"Mark was not altogether pleased to find that he had not got rid of the railroad adventurer. He recognized him as a dangerous and unprincipled man. As long as Mark had the diamond pin in his possession, the vicinity of such a fellow meant peril. He decided that he had better lose no time in delivering the pin to Mrs. Loring. He had told Florence that he would call the next day, but really there was no reason why he should not deliver it at once. About three o\u0027clock he called a cab and directed the driver to drive to No. 1001? Euclid Avenue. The distance was somewhat more than a mile, and in fifteen minutes he found himself at his destination. \"Shall I wait for you?\" asked the hackman. \"No; I may be in the house some time.\" He paid for the cab and rang the doorbell. \"Is Mrs. Loring at home?\" asked Mark of the servant who answered the bell. \"Yes, sir, but I don\u0027t know if she will see you.\" \"Tell her that I come from Mr. Swan of New York.\" \"She will see you,\" said the servant returning after a short absence. Mark was ushered into the reception room, and in a few minutes a pleasant-looking woman of middle age entered. She seemed surprised when her glance rested upon Mark. \"Surely you are not Mr. Swan\u0027s messenger?\" she said. \"Yes, madam.\" \"And you—have brought the pin?\" \"Here it is,\" said Mark, producing it from his pocket. Mrs. Loring eagerly opened the casket and uttered an exclamation of delight. \"It is beautiful—just what I wanted,\" she said. \"Mr. Swan said he thought he knew your taste.\" \"Did he mention the price?\" \"A thousand dollars. Here is the bill.\" \"I shall not dispute the price, for I have perfect confidence in Mr. Swan. But—isn\u0027t it strange that he should have selected so young a messenger?\" she continued, regarding Mark with curiosity. \"I agree with you,\" said Mark, smiling, \"but I feel confidence in Mr. Swan\u0027s judgment and did not object to come.\" \"You might have been robbed, if any evil-minded person had known what you carried.\" \"That is true, but they would not be likely to think a boy would be intrusted with an article of great value.\" \"That is certainly an important consideration. How long have you been in Mr. Swan\u0027s employ?\" \"About a week.\" \"And he trusted you like this?\" said the lady in astonishment. \"I am really a telegraph boy. Mr. Swan had known me in that character.\" \"He certainly paid you a great compliment, and his confidence does not seem to have been misplaced. Shall I pay you for the pin?\" \"You can give me a check payable to Mr. Swan, and I will forward it to him by mail.\" \"I will do so. Can you wait?\" \"Oh, yes, Mrs. Loring. I had no business in Cleveland except to deliver this ring.\" At that moment Florence Loring entered the room, and to her mother\u0027s surprise went up to Mark and offered her hand. \"I am glad to see you, Mr. Mason,\" she said. \"Thank you, Miss Florence.\" \"Is this call made on me?\" \"Partly,\" answered Mark smiling, \"but I had some business with your mother.\" \"How in the world did you two get acquainted?\" asked Mrs. Loring. \"Don\u0027t you remember, mama, what I told you about being robbed by a man who sat next to me, and having my purse returned by a boy—a young gentleman.\" \"I don\u0027t mind being called a boy,\" said Mark. \"I shall be one for some time yet.\" \"Well?\" \"Mr. Mason is the one who recovered my purse. Before that he kindly offered to loan me some money. But what possible business can he have with you?\" \"See what he has brought me from New York. He comes from Mr. Swan.\" \"Oh mama, how lovely! Is it a present for me? You know my birthday comes in eight months.\" \"My dear child, even if it came to-morrow I should hardly pay a thousand dollars for a birthday gift for you.\" \"A thousand dollars? It seems even more lovely now that I know the price.\" \"Remain here, Florence, and entertain Mr. Mason while I go to the library and write a check for the purchase money.\" \"All right, mama! Mr. Mason, why didn\u0027t you tell me what business you had with mama?\" \"I shouldn\u0027t have minded telling you, but if some one else had heard, your clerical friend for instance, I might have been robbed.\" \"That is true. I hope I shall never see him again.\" \"Perhaps you may. I have seen him.\" \"You have seen him?\" ejaculated Florence in surprise. \"Where?\" \"At the dinner table at my hotel.\" \"Do you think he is staying there?\" \"I only know that I saw him at the table.\" \"At what hotel are you staying?\" \"At the Erie Hotel.\" \"I hope you will be cautious. He may do you an injury,\" said Florence with flattering earnestness. \"It was because I saw him that I was anxious to deliver the pin as soon as possible.\" \"But he wouldn\u0027t know you had it.\" \"He would suppose I had some money for traveling expenses.\" \"True. And now you will have the large check my mother is to give you.\" \"I shall not keep it in my possession. I shall go back to the hotel at once and inclose it in a letter to Mr. Swan.\" \"You seem to be a remarkable boy—I mean you are remarkably sharp for your age.\" \"Telegraph boys have to be sharp.\" \"So you are a telegraph boy. Are there any telegraph girls?\" \"Not that I know of.\" \"I am afraid we poor girls would be too easily imposed upon.\" \"Well, have you entertained Mr. Mason?\" asked Mrs. Loring re-entering the room. \"I have done my best, mama. What do you think he tells me? That horrid man that stole my purse is staying at his hotel.\" \"Then I hope you won\u0027t send him an invitation to call here.\" \"He would call fast enough,\" suggested Mark, \"if he knew what a valuable diamond pin you have in the house.\" \"Then I hope he won\u0027t find out. How did it happen, Florence, you didn\u0027t watch him when he was sitting beside you?\" \"How could you expect me to watch a man who was engaged in reading a volume of sermons. They were the sermons of Rev. Dr. Hooker.\" \"Perhaps that is where he learned hooking,\" laughed Mark. \"That\u0027s a good joke!\" said Florence. \"By the way, mama, have you tickets for the theater this evening?\" \"Yes, but one won\u0027t be used. Louisa Frost can\u0027t go.\" \"Then suppose you give it to Mr. Mason. I am sure he would enjoy the play.\" \"Well thought of, Florence. Won\u0027t you get one of the tickets? You will find them on my bureau, that is if our young friend has no other engagement.\" \"I have none whatever,\" said Mark promptly. \"You are very kind, Mrs. Loring.\" \"You must thank Florence. If you were a few years older I should be afraid she had designs upon you. It is leap year, you know.\" \"Now, mama, what will Mr. Mason think of me? I am propriety personified.\" Mark concluded his call and left the house, well pleased at having successfully carried out his instructions. He went back directly to the hotel, and sitting down in the reading room wrote the following letter to his employer: \"Henry Swan, Esq., \"Dear Sir: I have delivered the diamond ring, and inclose Mrs. Loring\u0027s check for a thousand dollars in payment. She is very much pleased with it, and says it exactly suits her. I have had a pleasant journey, and expect to start on my return to-morrow. \"Yours respectfully, \"Mark Mason.\" As he was writing the address some one passed behind his chair and looked over his shoulder at the superscription. It was the \"Rev.\" Mr. Buffington, as he called himself. His eye lighted up as he saw to whom the letter was addressed. \"So this boy is traveling for a New York jeweler,\" he said to himself. \"I am glad to know this. He probably carries a stock of jewelry with him, and if so, I shall cultivate his acquaintance.\" He passed out of the reading room without Mark observing him. Mr. Buffington took care to keep out of the way, and Mark supposed he had left the hotel. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2989/82435.html","bookId":323,"book":{"id":323,"title":"Mark Mason\u0027s Victory","description":"简介： The speaker was a man of middle age, with a thin face and a nose like a Hawk.
