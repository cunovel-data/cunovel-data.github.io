{"id":16808,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. A CIRCUS IN MR. SPRAGUE\u0027S YARD.","content":"Philip timidly made known his request and the bottle was filled. The saloon-keeper attended to the order in a matter-of-fact manner. As long as he got his pay he cared very little whom he dealt with. Philip, feeling ashamed of his burden, came out with the bottle and set out on his return home. He had been delayed by the conversation at the door, and he had also had to wait to have the bottle filled, there being several customers to attend to before him. So it happened that when he got back Mr. Sprague and Oscar were awaiting him impatiently. \"There the boy comes at last, father,\" said Oscar. \"He\u0027s creeping like a snail.\" Whisky was Mr. Sprague\u0027s one extravagance, and he had waited longer than usual for his customary drink. This made him irritable. \"Why don\u0027t you come along faster, you young beggar?\" he called out harshly. \"I\u0027ll start him up, dad,\" said Oscar with alacrity. \"Do so!\" Oscar started down the road with a cruel light in his eyes. He liked nothing better than to ill-treat the unfortunate boy who had been left to the tender mercies of his father. Philip did not understand what Oscar\u0027s coming portended till the older boy seized him violently by the shoulders. \"Why don\u0027t you hurry up?\" he demanded. \"Don\u0027t you know any better than to waste your time playing on the street?\" \"I didn\u0027t waste any time. I couldn\u0027t get waited on at first.\" \"That\u0027s too thin! You were walking like a snail any way. I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t make you stir your stumps a little faster.\" Oscar pushed Philip so violently that the little fellow stumbled, and then came a catastrophe! He was thrown forward. The bottle came in contact with a stone, and of course broke, spilling the precious contents, as Nahum Sprague thought them. \"Now you\u0027ve done it!\" exclaimed Oscar. \"I wouldn\u0027t be in your shoes, young man. Pa will flog you within an inch of your life.\" \"See what Philip has done, pa!\" said Oscar, pointing to the broken bottle. Nahum Sprague absolutely glared at the unfortunate boy. His throat was dry and parched, and his craving for whisky was almost painful in its intensity. And now to have the cup dashed from his lips! It would take time to get a fresh supply, not to count the additional cost. His wrath was kindled against the poor boy. \"What made you break the bottle, you young rascal?\" he demanded harshly. \"I didn\u0027t mean to,\" answered Philip, pale with fright. \"You didn\u0027t mean to? I suppose it fell of itself,\" retorted Mr. Sprague with sarcasm. \"Oscar pushed me,\" exclaimed Philip. \"He pushed me very hard, or I wouldn\u0027t have dropped it.\" \"Now he wants to throw it all upon me, pa. Ain\u0027t you ashamed of yourself?\" \"It\u0027s true, Oscar, and you know it,\" returned Philip with a show of spirit. \"You said I didn\u0027t move fast enough.\" \"It\u0027s a wicked lie. I just touched you on the shoulder, and you broke the bottle out of spite.\" \"I have no doubt Oscar is right,\" said Nahum Sprague severely. \"You have destroyed my property. You have broken the bottle as well as wasted the whisky. You are a wicked and ungrateful boy. Here I have been keeping you out of charity because your lazy and shiftless father left you nothing.\" \"Don\u0027t you say anything against my father,\" said Philip, his meek spirit aroused by this cruel aspersion of the only human being who had cared for him since his mother\u0027s death. \"Hoity, toity! Here\u0027s impudence! So I am not to say anything against your father after caring for him through his sickness and burying him at my own expense.\" \"I\u0027ll pay you back, Mr. Sprague, indeed I will,\" said Philip, his lip quivering. \"You\u0027ll pay me back, you who are nothing but a beggar. Well, here\u0027s cheek. You talk as if you were rich instead of a pauper.\" \"I\u0027ll pay you some time—I have no money now—but I\u0027ll work day and night when I am a man to pay you.\" \"That all sounds very well, but it don\u0027t pay me for the bottle of whisky. I must give you a lesson for your carelessness. Oscar, go and get the horsewhip.\" \"I\u0027ll do it, dad,\" said Oscar joyfully. He was naturally a cruel boy, and the prospect of seeing Philip flogged gave him the greatest pleasure. There was a small outbuilding near the house which had once been used for a stable when Mr. Sprague kept a horse, but the last poor animal having pined away and died, as it was believed from insufficient food, it was no longer in use except as a store house for various odds and ends. The horsewhip was saved over from the time when it was needed for its legitimate purpose. \"Oh, don\u0027t whip me, Mr. Sprague!\" pleaded Philip, frightened at the last words of his cruel guardian. He was a sensitive boy, one of the kind that thrives under kind influences, and droops under ill-treatment. He had a delicate physical organization that shrank from pain, which some boys bear with stoical fortitude. It was not merely pain, but the humiliation of a blow that daunted him. Mr. Sprague did not make any reply to his pleadings, but waited impatiently for Oscar to appear. This was not long. Sent on a congenial errand Oscar wasted no time, but came out of the building promptly with the horsewhip in his hand. \"Here it is, dad!\" he said, handing it to his father. All this happened in open view of the house and of the public road. Mr. Sprague was so intent upon his plan of punishing Philip that he did not notice the approach of two men walking with unsteady steps along the highway and now close at hand. They were the two men who had talked with Philip in front of the drinking saloon. They had been drinking, but had not reached the stage of helplessness. \"I say, Joe,\" said one, looking towards Nahum Sprague\u0027s house, \"there\u0027s where old Sprague lives.\" \"He\u0027s a mean rascal,\" hiccoughed the other. \"I\u0027d like to thrash him.\" \"There\u0027s the kid—the one he sent to buy some drink. And there\u0027s old Sprague with a whip in his hand. I\u0027ll be dog-goned if he ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to lick him. It\u0027s a beastly shame. I say, suppose we take a hand.\" \"All right, Bill.\" Meanwhile Nahum Sprague, quite unaware that he was likely to be interfered with, took the whip from the hand of his son. He looked at Philip very much as a cat looks at a mouse whom she is preparing to swallow. \"Now you\u0027re going to catch it,\" he announced, with a cruel gleam in his eyes. \"Now you\u0027re going to see what you get for spilling my whisky. I\u0027ll learn you!\" \"Oh, please don\u0027t whip me, Mr. Sprague!\" pleaded Philip. \"Indeed. I didn\u0027t mean to break the bottle.\" \"Nahum brought the whip down with a swish on Philip\u0027s legs.\"—Page 285. Mark Mason\u0027s Victory. \"Nahum brought the whip down with a swish on Philip\u0027s legs.\"—Page 285. Mark Mason\u0027s Victory. \"That\u0027s too thin! You didn\u0027t want to go for the whisky in the first place. You said your papa,\" with a mocking sneer, \"didn\u0027t like to have you go to a saloon.\" \"That\u0027s true, but I went.\" \"Because you had to. You are lazy and put on airs, just as if you wasn\u0027t a beggar dependent on me for the bread you eat and the clothes you wear.\" \"My father bought me these clothes,\" said Philip. \"Suppose he did? When you have worn them out you\u0027ll expect me to buy you some more.\" \"What are you waiting for, pa?\" asked Oscar impatiently. \"If you\u0027re going to lick him, why don\u0027t you do it?\" \"I\u0027m going to,\" said Nahum, and, raising the whip he brought it down with a swish around the legs of the poor boy. Philip cried with pain, dancing up and down, and Oscar went into a fit of laughter at what he thought an amusing spectacle. \"That\u0027s the talk, dad!\" exclaimed Oscar. \"You gave it to him good. Give it to him again.\" \"I mean to,\" said Nahum grimly, and he raised the whip a second time. \"Say, Joe, are we going to stand this?\" asked Bill. \"Not by a long shot! Follow me, pard.\" Mr. Sprague\u0027s back was turned to the street, and he did not see the quick approach of the two miners. He was just about to bring down the whip again upon poor defenseless Philip when he thought he was struck by a cyclone. Bill seized him by the collar, while Joe snatched the whip from his hand. \"Why, why, what\u0027s all this?\" asked the astonished man in dismay. \"Two can play at your little game,\" answered Joe. \"You can stand it better than the kid,\" and he lashed the unfortunate Nahum across the legs just as Philip had suffered a short time before. \"Stop, stop!\" yelled Nahum, who was a coward at heart. \"What do you mean? I\u0027ll have the law of you.\" \"That\u0027s what you were doing to the kid. I\u0027ll give you a dose of your own medicine,\" and Mr. Sprague received a second stroke. \"Give me the whip, Joe!\" cried Bill. \"Give me a chance at him! Don\u0027t keep all the fun to yourself.\" \"All right! Here it is.\" Bill used the whip quite as effectively as his friend Joe. \"You stop licking my pa!\" exclaimed Oscar, not daring, however, to approach the scene of conflict. \"I say, kid, what was he licking you for?\" asked Bill after the first blow. \"He said I broke the bottle and spilled the whisky.\" \"And did you?\" \"Yes, but Oscar pushed me and made me do it.\" \"Who\u0027s Oscar?\" \"That boy there.\" \"Oho! so he\u0027s to blame for it.\" \"It\u0027s a lie!\" retorted Oscar. \"It isn\u0027t. I know the kid\u0027s telling the truth. He deserves a dose, too. Bring him here, Joe.\" Joe advanced upon Oscar, and after a short chase seized him by the collar, and brought him up to the self-appointed dispenser of justice. \"Hold him tight, Joe!\" Then Oscar felt the whip lash coiling around his legs. \"You quit that!\" he howled in anger and dismay. \"One more will do you good. You\u0027re bigger than the kid and you can stand it better.\" A second time the lash descended with even greater force, and Oscar jumped and danced as Philip had done before him, but somehow it didn\u0027t seem to impress him as so funny. \"You\u0027d better give the old man more and then we\u0027ll let him go,\" said Joe. \"I\u0027ll have you arrested!\" shrieked Nahum Sprague, but in spite of his threat he received another dose of the same medicine. \"When you want some more call on us!\" said Bill. As he spoke he flung the whip out into the street, and the two ministers of justice went off laughing. \"If they try to lick you again, kid, come and tell us,\" Joe called back. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2989/82448.html","bookId":323,"book":{"id":323,"title":"Mark Mason\u0027s Victory","description":"简介： The speaker was a man of middle age, with a thin face and a nose like a Hawk.
