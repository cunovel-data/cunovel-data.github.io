{"id":16779,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. TWO STRANGERS FROM SYRACUSE.","content":"\"That is the City Hall over there, Edgar.\" The speaker was a man of middle age, with a thin face and a nose like a Hawk. He was well dressed, and across his vest was visible a showy gold chain with a cameo charm attached to it. The boy, probably about fifteen, was the image of his father. They were crossing City Hall Park in New York and Mr. Talbot was pointing out to his son the public buildings which make this one of the noted localities in the metropolis. \"Shine?\" asked a bootblack walking up to the pair. \"I\u0027d like to take a shine, father,\" said Edgar. \"What do you charge?\" \"Five cents, but I don\u0027t object to a dime,\" replied the bootblack. \"Can I have a shine, father?\" \"Why didn\u0027t you get one at the hotel?\" \"Because they charged ten cents. I thought I could get it for less outside.\" \"Good boy!\" said the father in a tone of approval. \"Get things as low as you can. That\u0027s my motto, and that\u0027s the way I got rich. Here, boy, you can get to work.\" Instantly the bootblack was on his knees, and signed for Edgar to put his foot on the box. \"What\u0027s your name, boy?\" asked Edgar with a condescending tone. \"No, it ain\u0027t boy. It\u0027s Tom.\" \"Well, Tom, do you make much money?\" \"Well, I don\u0027t often make more\u0027n five dollars a day.\" \"Five dollars? You are trying to humbug me.\" \"It\u0027s true though. I never made more\u0027n five dollars in a day in my life, \u0027cept when I shined shoes for swells like you who were liberal with their cash.\" Edgar felt rather flattered to be called a swell, but a little alarmed at the suggestion that Tom might expect more than the usual sum. \"That\u0027s all right, but I shall only pay you five cents.\" \"I knew you wouldn\u0027t as soon as I saw you.\" \"Why?\" \"\u0027Cause you don\u0027t look like George W. Childs.\" \"Who\u0027s he?\" \"The Ledger man from Philadelphia. I once blacked his shoes and he gave me a quarter. General Washington once paid me a dollar.\" \"What!\" ejaculated Edgar. \"Do you mean to say that you ever blacked General Washington\u0027s shoes?\" \"No; he wore boots.\" \"Why, my good boy, General Washington died almost a hundred years ago.\" \"Did he? Well, it might have been some other general.\" \"I guess it was. You don\u0027t seem to know much about history.\" \"No, I don\u0027t. I spent all my time studyin\u0027 \u0027stronomy when I went to school.\" \"What\u0027s your whole name?\" \"Tom Trotter. I guess you\u0027ve heard of my father. He\u0027s Judge Trotter of the Supreme Court?\" \"I am afraid you don\u0027t tell the truth very often.\" \"No, I don\u0027t. It ain\u0027t healthy. Do you?\" \"Of course I do.\" This conversation was not heard by Mr. Talbot, who had taken a seat on one of the park benches, and was busily engaged in reading the morning World. By this time Tom began to think it was his time to ask questions. \"Where did you come from?\" he inquired. \"How do you know but I live in the city?\" \"\u0027Cause you ain\u0027t got New York style.\" \"Oh!\" said Edgar rather mortified. Then he added in a tone which he intended to be highly sarcastic: \"I suppose you have.\" \"Well, I guess. You\u0027d ought to see me walk down Fifth Avener Sunday mornin\u0027 with my best girl.\" \"Do you wear the same clothes you\u0027ve got on now?\" \"No, I guess not. I\u0027ve got a little Lord Fauntleroy suit of black velvet, with kid gloves and all the fixin\u0027s. But you ain\u0027t told me where you live yet.\" \"I live in Syracuse. My father\u0027s one of the most prominent citizens of that city.\" \"Is it the man you was walkin\u0027 with?\" \"Yes; there he is sitting on that bench.\" \"He ain\u0027t much to look at. You look just like him.\" \"Really, I think you are the most impudent boy I ever met!\" said Edgar with asperity. \"Why, what have I said? I only told you you looked like him.\" \"Yes, but you said he wasn\u0027t much to look at!\" \"I guess he\u0027s rich, and that\u0027s better than good looks.\" \"Yes, my father is quite wealthy,\" returned Edgar complacently. \"I wish I was rich instead of good lookin\u0027.\" \"You good looking!\" \"That\u0027s what everybody says. I ain\u0027t no judge myself.\" Tom looked roguishly at Edgar, and his aristocratic patron was obliged to confess that he had a pleasant face, though it was marred by a black spot on each cheek, probably caused by the contact of his hands. \"You\u0027re a queer boy,\" said Edgar. \"I don\u0027t know what to make of you.\" \"Make a rich man of me, and we\u0027ll go to Europe together. My doctor says I ought to travel for my health.\" \"Edgar, haven\u0027t you got your shoes blacked yet?\" asked his father from the bench. Tom struck the box sharply with his brush to show that the job was completed. \"Just got done, governor,\" he said familiarly. \"Here is your money,\" said Edgar, producing some pennies from his pockets. \"There\u0027s only four,\" observed Tom with a critical glance. \"Only four! Haven\u0027t you dropped one?\" \"No. That\u0027s all you gave me.\" \"Father, have you got a cent?\" Mr. Talbot\u0027s hand dived into his pocket, and he brought out a penny, but it was a Canadian coin. \"I don\u0027t know as I can pass this,\" said Tom. \"They\u0027re very particular at the Windsor Hotel, where I am boarding.\" \"You can save it till you go traveling in Canada,\" suggested Edgar, with unusual brightness for him. \"That\u0027s so,\" answered Tom, who appreciated a joke. \"I\u0027ll stop in Syracuse on the way and pay you a visit.\" \"How does he know about our living in Syracuse?\" asked Mr. Talbot. \"I told him I lived there.\" \"He said you was a big bug up there.\" \"I hope you didn\u0027t use that expression, Edgar,\" said his father. \"Oh well, that\u0027s what he meant. Won\u0027t you have a shine yourself, governor?\" \"No; I don\u0027t think I shall need it.\" \"Where\u0027d you get that shine you\u0027ve got on?\" \"In Syracuse.\" \"Tell \u0027em they don\u0027t understand shinin\u0027 boots up there.\" \"Hadn\u0027t you better go up there and give them some lessons?\" suggested Edgar. \"Well, I don\u0027t mind, if I can get free board at your house.\" \"Do you think we would have a bootblack living in our house?\" \"Don\u0027t waste any time on him, Edgar. He is a street boy, and his manners are fitted to his station.\" \"Thank you, governor. That\u0027s the biggest compliment I\u0027ve had for a long time.\" Mr. Talbot laughed. \"Really, boy, you are very grotesque.\" \"That\u0027s another compliment,\" said Tom, taking off his hat and bowing with mock politeness. \"Hallo, Tom!\" Tom turned to meet the smile of a District Telegraph messenger, who was crossing the park to Broadway. \"How\u0027s yourself, Mark?\" he said. \"I\u0027d offer to shake hands, but I\u0027ve been doin\u0027 a little business for these gentlemen, and my gloves ain\u0027t handy.\" No. 79, following the direction of Tom\u0027s nod, glanced at Mr. Talbot and Edgar, and instantly a look of surprise came over his face. \"Why, Uncle Solon, is that you?\" he exclaimed. Solon Talbot looked embarrassed, and seemed in doubt whether to acknowledge his relationship to the humble telegraph boy. \"Are you Mark Mason?\" he asked. \"Yes; don\u0027t you know me?\" \"I haven\u0027t seen you for two years, you know.\" \"And this is Edgar!\" continued the telegraph boy. \"You\u0027ve grown so I would hardly know you.\" \"I hope you are well,\" said Edgar coldly. \"Thank you. Uncle Solon, where are you staying?\" \"Ahem! I am stopping up town.\" \"Shall you be in the city long?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Mother would like very much to see you. She would like to ask about grandfather\u0027s estate.\" \"Ah—um—yes! Where do you live?\" \"No. 174 St. Mark\u0027s Place, near First Avenue.\" \"We\u0027ll call if we can. Edgar, we\u0027ll have to hurry away.\" As they walked toward the other side of the park at a brisk pace, Tom asked: \"You don\u0027t mean to say that\u0027s your uncle, Mark?\" \"Yes; that is, he married my mother\u0027s sister.\" \"And that young swell is your cousin?\" \"Yes.\" \"He is rich, isn\u0027t he?\" \"I suppose so.\" \"Why don\u0027t he do something for you and your mother?\" \"He was always a very selfish man. But we don\u0027t ask any favors—mother and I don\u0027t. All we ask is justice.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \"My grandfather, that is mother\u0027s father and Mrs. Talbot\u0027s, died two years ago, and Uncle Solon was the administrator. We supposed he had left a good deal of money, but all we have received from his estate is seventy-five dollars.\" \"Do you think the old feller\u0027s been playin\u0027 any game on you?\" \"I don\u0027t know what to think.\" \"I tell you what, Mark, he deserves a good lickin\u0027 if he\u0027s cheated you, and I\u0027d like to give it to him.\" \"Well, Tom, I must be going. I can\u0027t stop talking here, or I\u0027ll get into trouble at the office.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2989/82419.html","bookId":323,"book":{"id":323,"title":"Mark Mason\u0027s Victory","description":"简介： The speaker was a man of middle age, with a thin face and a nose like a Hawk.
