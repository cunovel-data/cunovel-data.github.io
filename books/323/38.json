{"id":16816,"no":38,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII THE MINING STOCK IS SOLD.","content":"\"But I understood that you were poor,\" said Mr. Rockwell, surprised at Mark\u0027s statement. \"That we are so is because Mr. Talbot as executor has concealed from my mother the existence of the stock as a part of grandfather\u0027s estate.\" \"How long since your grandfather died?\" \"Nearly two years.\" \"And the stock is only now to be sold?\" \"Yes; my uncle had advices that it would be well to wait, as it was likely to go up.\" \"And your mother\u0027s share is half—say, two hundred shares?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then she will be comfortable for life. At the price I am thinking of paying, this will amount to over fifty thousand dollars. Now can you give me any information about the mine?\" \"Yes, sir; I made it my business to inquire. It is confidently expected to go considerably higher. It is growing richer every day.\" \"I shall rely upon your statements and buy the stock. After it is sold I advise you to take immediate steps to secure your share. Have you consulted a lawyer?\" \"Yes; a young man.\" \"In a matter of this importance an older and more experienced lawyer will be better. I will give you a note to my own lawyer.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"I am now going to the office of Crane \u0026 Lawton where I shall meet your uncle, and conclude the business. Come here in less than two hours and I may be able to tell you the result.\" \"I will do so.\" Solon Talbot was much elated when informed by Crane \u0026 Lawton that they had found a purchaser for his mining stock in the person of Luther Rockwell, the well-known banker. \"Do you think he would stand a higher price?\" asked Talbot. \"It would not be wise to ask it.\" \"He is very rich. He could afford to pay more.\" \"True; but he became rich through prudence and shrewdness. Sell to him and you won\u0027t have to wait for your money.\" \"No doubt you are right. I will be guided by your advice.\" When Solon Talbot was introduced to Mr. Rockwell he made a deferential bow. \"I am honored in making your acquaintance, Mr. Rockwell,\" he said. \"Thank you, sir.\" The banker would have been more cordial but for what he had heard from Mark. \"How long have you owned this stock, Mr. Talbot?\" inquired Mr. Rockwell. \"Three years.\" \"It is not held in your name.\" \"No; it belongs to the estate of my late father-in-law, Elisha Doane.\" \"I take it that you are the executor of the estate.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Solon Talbot would not have been so communicative if he had supposed that the banker was a friend to Mark. He had forgotten Mark\u0027s agency in protecting Mr. Rockwell from the dynamite fiend. \"The stock was probably purchased at a very low figure.\" \"I presume so, though I do not know what was paid for it. Indeed I never heard of it until I came to examine the items of my father-in-law\u0027s estate. He didn\u0027t have much else.\" \"It is fortunate for his heirs.\" \"Yes,\" answered Talbot rather nervously. He was afraid Mr. Rockwell might inquire who were the other heirs. Had he done so, he would have evaded the question or boldly declared that there was no other heirs except himself. After half an hour\u0027s conversation the purchase was made, and a check for one hundred and four thousand dollars was handed to Mr. Talbot. \"I hope you will not have occasion to regret your purchase, Mr. Rockwell,\" said Solon. \"I think I shall not from advices I have received about increasing richness.\" At the time appointed Mark called at Mr. Rockwell\u0027s office. \"Well, Mark,\" said the lawyer, \"I made the purchase.\" \"At two hundred and sixty?\" \"Yes. I congratulate you.\" \"That is, if I succeed in getting our share from my uncle.\" \"I will give you a letter to my lawyer, Mr. Gerrish. Obtain a letter from him, as your counsel, and call to-morrow upon your uncle with a formal demand for your mother\u0027s share of the proceeds of the mining stock.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2989/82456.html","bookId":323,"book":{"id":323,"title":"Mark Mason\u0027s Victory","description":"简介： The speaker was a man of middle age, with a thin face and a nose like a Hawk.
