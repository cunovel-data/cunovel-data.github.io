{"id":96248,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"The next day Becky and I arrived at school to an unusual sight. Students were buzzing about the Crypt, and I noticed several girls wearing the same T-shirt Becky had given me for my birthday - black with THE CRYPT in white skeleton bone letters. \"That club rocks!\" I heard the Prada-bee say to her friend. Her Crypt shirt was over her long-sleeve button down. \"I can\u0027t wait to go again.\" \"I\u0027m going every night,\" her friend retorted. She was wearing one, too, but it was underneath her green cashmere cardigan. \"How did they get those?\" I asked Becky. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said, just as bewildered as I was. Several other students we passed as we headed to our lockers had Crypt shirts, but even those who didn\u0027t were blabbing about the fantastic time they had at the new club. I was so pleased that even though I was still looked at as an oddball, we were all sharing in the same joy that was the Crypt. Now that Alexander (as Phoenix) was key in cementing Jagger\u0027s mortals-only club policy, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that my fellow students, family, and townspeople were in no immediate danger from unknown vampires. Maybe Scarlet, Onyx, and Sebastian would be staying in Dullsville. It would be a dream for me to spend time with them and Alexander in the darkened hours. Even Jagger and Luna, who were far from what I\u0027d call best friends, could be a nice addition to this town. Jagger had made a fantasy of mine come true - and I had to give him major props for that. And by the number of Crypt T-shirtï¿½Cwearing students, Jagger could be next in line to my own nemesis, Trevor, in being Dullsville\u0027s most popular. I opened my locker. \"Can you believe that tonight is finally your joint birthday party?\" Becky said. \"I\u0027m so excited, I can\u0027t wait. I wish we could just skip the school part and head straight to the club. But you know I wish that every day.\" She laughed. \"But seriously, I can\u0027t even concentrate. I have a test third period and all I can think about are tombstones.\" \"What are you wearing?\" Becky asked. \"I\u0027ve tried on a million things. I can\u0027t decide between a minidress and a corset one.\" \"I can\u0027t believe that out of all the students, we get invites for the party. And you are the guest of honor,\" Becky gushed. As we shut our locker doors, I walked proudly down the hallway, knowing I was going to open the Covenant just for us. When we turned the corner, I bumped into Trevor, who was wearing a black Crypt T-shirt. \"Where did you get that?\" I asked. \"I\u0027m all out. Too bad I only have the one I\u0027m wearing. Want to swap shirts? We can change here,\" he suggested with a wink. \"Thanks, but it would be best for all of us if you kept your shirt on.\" The truth was Trevor had the best physique in school, but I wasn\u0027t about to tell him that. Besides, he already knew. \"So are you going to wear that special bracelet?\" Trevor whispered as Becky got a quick drink at the water fountain. I didn\u0027t say anything. My usual stinging barbs would have been funny but not totally appropriate. Trevor had given me a present - a real one. And to slam him would have made me a heel. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"It was beautiful.\" He was surprised at my sincerity. I felt like hugging him. It was the right thing to do. I know he would have wanted a kiss, but I wasn\u0027t about to get sick to my stomach. Trevor looked like he didn\u0027t know what to do. He was ready to slam me back, but since I had said something nice, he was speechless. He just grinned awkwardly and walked away. \"Hey, Trevor,\" I called. \"Yeah?\" he asked, stopping. He stood with his hands on his hips, probably sure this time I was going to hurl a major verbal assault. He grinned like a champion. I scurried up to him and before he could move, I hugged him. I hugged him so hard, I could feel his heart racing. For a moment I locked my hands together behind his back, like one hugging someone they really cared about would. I\u0027d caught Trevor off guard. He didn\u0027t know what to do. For a moment he didn\u0027t return my hug. Then he softened, as if he\u0027d waited all his life for this display of affection. Just as he drew his arms around me, I stepped back. Trevor smiled a bigger smile than I\u0027d ever seen. It was the least I could do. I was so excited about the party that even pressing my body against my nemesis to show my gratitude wasn\u0027t going to spoil it. \"Now I have to burn these clothes,\" I said to him as Becky caught up to me and I slipped inside my classroom. Becky showed up at my house well before sunset. We modeled our outfits and tried out different hairstyles. She looked stellar in a black cami with a demi sweater and violet rayon skirt. The doorbell rang as I was still trying to squeeze on my final outfit. \"They\u0027re here!\" Becky said excitedly. It wasn\u0027t like she never saw Matt. She saw him every day at school and on many evenings. But every time he arrived, she was just as thrilled as the time before. And I couldn\u0027t blame her. My heart pounded out of my chest every chance I got to see Alexander. \"Girls,\" my mom called from downstairs. \"Your dates are here!\" I laced myself into my lavender monster boots, and Becky helped zip me into my black minidress and fix my barrettes. Since I\u0027d gotten behind the time, I would have been a mess without her smoothing touches. We descended the staircase like debutantes. Alexander and Matt were awaiting us, with huge smiles and in handsome club attire. \"Can I take a picture?\" my mom asked. \"Mom!\" I said, totally embarrassed. It wasn\u0027t enough that my boyfriend was a vampire and wouldn\u0027t even show up in the photo, but my mom making a fuss was more unbearable. \"Your dad is still at work,\" my mom said. \"He\u0027d hate to miss this moment.\" \"Oh yes, please, use my phone,\" Becky said. \"I\u0027ll send you the pics.\" I didn\u0027t even try to get out of it. Becky and Matt squeezed next to Alexander and me. We smiled as if Alexander were going to show up after all. \"Say cheese,\" my mom said. Alexander squinted when the flash went off. \"Are you okay?\" my mom asked. \"Just something in my eye. It was great seeing you, Mrs. Madison,\" Alexander said, giving my mom a polite kiss on the cheek. \"Now our car awaits.\" We gave quick hugs and good-byes to my mom as we walked out the front door and to the driveway, where Jameson was waiting with a limo. \"You are kidding me!\" I screamed. \"Only the best for the best,\" Alexander said. Becky and I continued to scream and giggle as we got in the back of the limo and headed to the Crypt like celebrities on their way to an awards show. I arrived with my boyfriend and friends at the Crypt. I was excited to finally have the party celebrating Alexander\u0027s and my birthdays that Jagger had talked so much about. I wasn\u0027t sure what he had in store for us, but I knew it would be something special. The club was open to all its usual customers, but our party was going to be somewhere else in the club. I wasn\u0027t supposed to know the location, but I\u0027d learned from Phoenix that we were finally going to see the Covenant after all. We all milled about on the main floor until Jagger said it was time for the party. Becky approached me and seemed gravely concerned. \"What\u0027s up?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s party time.\" \"Nothing . . . it\u0027s just something that I\u0027ve been weirded out by for a while.\" \"Did I do something?\" \"No - it\u0027s not you. It\u0027s - \" \"Tell me.\" \"I want to show you this,\" Becky said. She led me into an alcove away from dancing clubsters. She held out her phone. \"Remember the picture I took at the soccer field again of Sebastian? He didn\u0027t show up in any of the pictures. He\u0027s clearly missing.\" \"That\u0027s all?\" I asked. \"Yes, that\u0027s weird. But maybe there is something wrong with your phone.\" \"I got to thinking. Maybe the rumor wasn\u0027t just a rumor.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"All the signs. For so long now. I can\u0027t believe you - of all people - haven\u0027t noticed.\" \"What are you saying?\" I asked my best friend. \"These are the pictures of the workers I took before Jagger told me not to take pictures.\" She showed me her phone again. There were no workers in view. \"Maybe they were out of the frame,\" I said. \"Everyone? All the pictures I took of you are perfect.\" \"Maybe it\u0027s time to buy a new cell phone. I think we have to get back - \" \"And then this one.\" She took out a camera from her purse. \"I used my camera this time. I took it tonight. It is of Jagger, Luna, and Sebastian.\" \"You weren\u0027t supposed to take pictures. . . .\" She held out the camera, shaking in her hand. There wasn\u0027t anyone in the picture. I didn\u0027t know what to say. \"Maybe it\u0027s the lighting?\" I tried. Becky\u0027s face was determined. \"It\u0027s not the cell phone. It\u0027s not the camera. It\u0027s them!\" \"Becky, you aren\u0027t making sense - \" \"That\u0027s why Sebastian bit Luna at Alexander\u0027s party. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve only seen them during the night and why they don\u0027t go to school. They can\u0027t. They are - \" \"I have to get back - \" She reached into her purse again. \"Then it won\u0027t matter if I throw these cloves of garlic on the dance floor.\" I imagined it then. One by one, Alexander, Jagger, Luna, Sebastian, Onyx, and Scarlet breathing in the garlic fumes and gasping for breath. All laboring to get fresh air. Finally each one, falling to the floor. . . . I reached for her purse. \"No - you can\u0027t! You have to take that out of here! They won\u0027t be able to breathe!\" Becky was stunned by my reaction. Her face turned ghostly white. She pulled out an empty hand. She could barely breathe herself. \"Raven, I don\u0027t have any garlic. . . .\" I covered my mouth in horror. \"So it\u0027s true,\" she said faintly. My best friend knew - about Jagger, Luna, Sebastian, Onyx, and Scarlet. And if I couldn\u0027t prove her wrong - or worse, lie to her - then it would be only moments before she realized the truth about Alexander, too. My head swirled with excuses. The camera doesn\u0027t work, it\u0027s the lighting . . . but when I opened my mouth, no words came out. Instead I nodded, as if I\u0027d been waiting for her to tell me those words forever. In fact, I must have been. She was my best friend and I\u0027d kept the biggest secret from her - something I\u0027d never done. And now she\u0027d found out on her own, and I couldn\u0027t keep the secret any longer. Her lower lip quivered and she wobbled in place. \"Becky?\" I put my hand on her shoulder. Becky began to succumb to her dizziness. Her knees buckled and she started to fall. I quickly grabbed her with both hands, trying to keep her standing. \"What\u0027s wrong with her?\" a clubster asked. \"She feels faint,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s give her some air.\" I held her up and guided her over to the bar, then helped her sit down. \"We need some water,\" I said. I hugged my best friend. \"It\u0027s okay, Becky. You\u0027ll be okay. We\u0027ll be okay.\" The bartender put a glass of water on the bar. \"I\u0027m not thirsty,\" she said, pushing it away. \"Drink it,\" I said, handing it to her. Becky gulped it down. For a moment we girls sat in silence, processing what had just happened. Becky had just learned my boyfriend\u0027s true identity and now I had to deal with my best friend holding this secret knowledge. \"I\u0027m scared, Raven. I\u0027m really scared.\" Tears began streaming down her face. Her house of Hello Kitty cards was falling down in front of me. I was left breathless. \"And this picture, too,\" she said, scrolling her phone. \"It\u0027s the one your mom took tonight with me and you and Matt and Alexander. OnlyAlexander isn\u0027t in the picture.\" I couldn\u0027t speak nor look at the picture my friend was holding out, shaking in her fingers. \"So, does that mean - Alexander, too?\" I didn\u0027t answer. \"It\u0027s funny, really. I\u0027ve never seen him in the daylight. Not once. And those pictures from the Snow Ball, he didn\u0027t turn out, and now tonight. . . .\" I nodded. I knew she was frightened. For her, for me, for us. For the town. Even for Alexander. \"You tried to tell me once underneath the staircase at school. But I laughed at you.\" \"I would have laughed, too.\" \"Is it possible to be a good vampire?\" Becky said. \"I think Alexander\u0027s proof.\" Matt raced over. He noticed Becky\u0027s pale complexion. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Becky feels faint,\" I said. \"I think you should take her home.\" \"But they\u0027re going to have your celebration,\" she muttered. \"You\u0027ve had enough for tonight,\" I said. \"Matt, do you mind?\" I asked. \"I think she needs some rest.\" \"I don\u0027t want to leave,\" she said. \"I want to stay. I want to know everything now.\" \"What do you want to know?\" Matt said. \"What is she talking about?\" \"I want to know more about vampires,\" Becky said. \"And Raven knows everything there is to know.\" \"Are you sure you\u0027re okay?\" Matt asked. Becky looked at me with a knowing smile. \"I don\u0027t want to be left in the dark anymore.\" I insisted Matt sit with Becky while she continued to drink her water and I went to find Alexander. \"I have to tell you something,\" I said when I finally found him by the club\u0027s entrance. \"It will have to wait. Jagger wants us to join him for the VIP party.\" Jagger unlocked the Covenant door and waved us over. Becky and Matt trailed behind. We walked down darkened, crooked wooden steps. When we reached the bottom we could clearly see the room Jagger had been hiding. Twinkling tombstones lined the walls and morbid music played. \"Happy birthday!\" everyone cheered. Sebastian, Luna, Scarlet, Onyx, Jagger, Trevor, and a few others who must have been friends of Jagger\u0027s from the Coffin Club applauded. \"And look at this. A covenant altar. Perfect for parties,\" Jagger said. A wrought-iron, spooky spiderweb-designed trellis was beautiful. Underneath it lay a coffin with two antique pewter goblets adorned with bats. \"We are going to have a ceremony tonight. Just for kicks,\" Sebastian said. \"A mock ceremony to unite us with our girlfriends for eternity. I\u0027m going first, then it\u0027s your turn.\" \"Are you kidding?\" Alexander asked. \"That is cool.\" I kind of liked the idea. A mock covenant. Alexander and I could practice what it would really be like to have the ceremony and for me to be turned without it being a reality. Like posing for a picture with a wacky facade at a theme park. However, I\u0027d be the only one in the picture. Luna was dressed in a frilly taffeta pink dress and black monster boots. Her baby pink hair cascaded over her naked shoulders. \"Happy birthday, Raven,\" she said. \"Thanks, Luna.\" \"And happy birthday, Alexander.\" She stood on her tiptoes and gave him a peck on the cheek. \"You\u0027ll soon find out what you\u0027ve been missing,\" I heard her say. \"I can see why you\u0027re dying to have a covenant ceremony with Luna,\" I said to Sebastian. \"She does look like an angel.\" \"She\u0027s a beauty,\" he said with a starry-eyed stare. Becky came up to me and Alexander. She stared at him like she was seeing him for the first time. She reached out to touch his arm as if she was trying to see if he was real. \"What\u0027s up?\" Alexander said. \"Happy birthday,\" she said in a whisper. \"But are you really eighteen?\" \"Yes,\" he answered, confused. \"You\u0027re not really one hundred and eighteen?\" \"No,\" Alexander insisted. \"What are you talking about?\" She stepped back, then raced to Matt\u0027s side. \"What\u0027s wrong with her?\" Alexander asked. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been trying to tell you. Becky found - \" Just then Jagger motioned us over to a giant cake sitting on a table. \"Time to make a wish.\" The cake was a long sheet cake with black flowers and tiny tombstones on it. In blood-red letters it read, \"Happy Birthday, Alexander and Raven.\" It was really sweet that Jagger had taken the time to decorate this room, get us this cake, and arrange for this party. Two candles were burning like tiny torches. Alexander and I looked at each other. We both made our separate wishes and blew out the candles. \"Thanks, Jagger,\" I said. I gave him a big hug. He was taken aback by my affection but seemed grateful for it. We each took a piece of cake and then headed for the small dance floor. \"So it\u0027s just us?\" Becky said. \"Who are not . . . ?\" \"You, me, Matt, and Trevor. But I still think Trevor is one, deep down,\" I teased. \"Scarlet and Onyx?\" \"Oh yeah,\" I said as I danced. \"Are we in danger?\" \"No - I carry garlic, just in case.\" \"You do?\" I shook my head. \"You are safe tonight. Nothing is going to happen.\" Just then Sebastian took a swig from a bottle. His mouth was stained with red liquid that he wiped off with the back of his hand. \"Is that wine?\" Becky asked. \"I\u0027m afraid not.\" We continued to dance, and my friend tried to absorb her new reality without passing out. It was then she spotted two marks on Luna\u0027s neck. \"I think I have to go to the bathroom,\" Becky said. \"Are you okay?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" she said, starting for the door. \"I\u0027ll go with you,\" I said, and followed her up the stairs and into the girl\u0027s bathroom. She splashed water on her face. \"When did you know?\" she asked. \"After Alexander\u0027s Welcome to the Neighborhood party. I was using Ruby\u0027s compact and he didn\u0027t show up in the reflection.\" \"That was months ago.\" \"I know.\" \"And you held this secret inside you for that long?\" \"I had to. For everyone\u0027s sake.\" \"Who else knows?\" \"No one. It\u0027s so important that no one else know.\" \"I\u0027m not going to tell anyone. Who\u0027d believe me? But I have to tell Matt.\" \"He\u0027ll have to swear to secrecy.\" \"He will,\" she assured me. She dotted her face and neck with a paper towel. \"I know this is a dream come true for you. But for me - \" \"A nightmare?\" \"Pretty much. Your boyfriend and all these people I\u0027ve come to know are vampires.\" \"Can you believe it?\" \"And they sleep here?\" \"Yes, isn\u0027t that cool?\" I said with a smile. \"In coffins?\" \"Yes, you want to see?\" \"You are joking.\" \"No, I\u0027m not.\" We left the restroom and I pushed through the crowd of clubsters, Becky trailing close behind. \"I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m ready for this,\" she said when we reached the spiral staircase. \"I almost fainted once. And these stairs are spooky enough.\" \"It\u0027s just down here.\" \"Besides, don\u0027t you want to get back to the party? Matt is by himself.\" \"Alexander is with him.\" I\u0027m not sure if that was comforting to Becky anymore. I, too, wanted to return to the party. I\u0027d been waiting to celebrate for days, and in such a cool vampire way. But I\u0027d also been waiting to share this secret with someone - anyone, especially my best friend - for so long now, it was comforting being able to reveal the load I\u0027d been carrying alone. \"All right,\" I said. \"I can show you later.\" Just then Scarlet arrived behind us. \"What are you girls up to?\" \"Uh . . . I had to get something in Jagger\u0027s office,\" I said. I didn\u0027t have to lie anymore, but I was so used to it, I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. Besides, I wasn\u0027t sure how Scarlet felt about Becky knowing she was a vampire. \"Cool. I have to go to our room, so we can walk together.\" She stepped around us and we followed her down the hall. \"I just need to grab some fresh lipstick. Trevor rubbed it all off.\" Becky hung back as Scarlet opened the door and popped inside. \"Do you guys mind if I take off?\" Scarlet asked when she came back out. \"I want to head back to the party. Sebastian and Luna are going to have their mock covenant ceremony. You don\u0027t want to miss it.\" \"We\u0027ll only be a sec,\" I said. \"Are you feeling faint?\" I said to Becky when Scarlet had gone. \"Sort of.\" \"Then we\u0027ll stop.\" \"I think this might be a dream,\" she said. \"Hopefully I\u0027ll wake up any minute.\" \"Okay, but don\u0027t freak out if you don\u0027t.\" I opened the coffin room door wider so she could see in. There they were, five coffins in a row. Becky screamed. Fortunately we were too far away from the Crypt for anyone to hear. \"That\u0027s how they sleep?\" she asked. \"Yes.\" \"And Alexander, too?\" \"His is black and it\u0027s at the Mansion.\" Becky didn\u0027t move but remained fixed in the hallway. It was as if she expected one of the coffins to open and a dead person to jump out. \"No one is in them,\" I assured her. \"They are all at the party.\" \"They really sleep here? Even Sebastian?\" she wondered aloud. \"Yes, his is the one with stickers from different countries on it.\" \"A vampire was interested in me?\" It was too much for her to take in on one night. \"Yes, he was.\" \"I feel woozy again.\" She began to get weak-kneed, so I pulled her into Jagger\u0027s office. \"A tarantula?\" she said nervously. \"And gravestone etchings on the walls?\" \"Maybe this wasn\u0027t the best place for you to sit down. But you should really catch your breath.\" It was then I spotted the blueprints for the Covenant lying out on the table. On closer inspection I noticed something I hadn\u0027t seen before. These plans were old and weathered. They were the original factory plans. In the margin, written in pencil, was a small area that remained untouched. When I looked closer, it said, \"tomb.\" Now I was ready to faint. It appeared to be a small burial site for soldiers. Part of the factory had been built over sacred ground - the part that Jagger now called the Covenant. And any minute, Sebastian and Luna were going to have a real covenant ceremony. And unbeknownst to Alexander\u0027s best friend, it wasn\u0027t going to be \"just for fun.\" \"Oh no!\" I said. \"What?\" Becky asked. \"We have to get upstairs!\" \"I still feel woozy.\" \"Do you want me to leave you here?\" Becky recovered lightning fast. Before I could move, she was standing at the door. I grabbed the original blueprints and we raced through the hallway and up the rickety spiral staircase. We squeezed through the crowd and scurried down the Covenant stairs. When we reached the underground club, Sebastian and Luna were standing over a coffin on the covenant stage. \"Where were you?\" Alexander said. \"Sebastian and Luna are doing their ceremony. And we\u0027re next.\" Trevor, Scarlet, Jagger, and Onyx were watching from the sidelines. \"I have to talk to you,\" I whispered. \"Shh!\" Jagger scolded. Sebastian held up a goblet and recited some words I couldn\u0027t understand. \"I have to talk to you - it can\u0027t wait any longer!\" \"It will have to wait until after the ceremony,\" Alexander said. Then Luna repeated the same words and took a drink from her goblet. \"We are on sacred ground,\" I said to Alexander. \"What?\" he said. Just then Sebastian turned to Luna. He held her hands and stared lovingly at her. He then took one hand and brushed her hair off of her neck. He smiled and leaned in. I shoved the blueprints in front of Alexander and in my loudest voice declared, \"We are on sacred ground!!!\" Sebastian stopped, and everyone in the club turned to me. Alexander\u0027s face turned white, but it was Sebastian\u0027s face that was the most horrified. \"What?\" I waved the blueprints. \"We are over a real tomb. You are performing a real covenant ceremony!\" \"I thought this was a joke. Just a game,\" Sebastian said, stepping back. He looked at Luna, whose bright face fell. Sebastian jumped off the stage and shook his head. Disgusted, he pushed past us and headed up the stairs. Jagger\u0027s face was red with anger. Luna stood alone on the stage. It was the second time she\u0027d been stood up at a covenant ceremony. First by Alexander, and now by Sebastian. Even I didn\u0027t wish that kind of rejection for her. I could see the horror and sadness in her face. One tiny pink tear fell down her porcelain white cheek. \"Luna - \" I said, jumping up onstage to comfort her. She gave me a killer stare that made me shudder. Then she stormed off the stage and out of the club. Alexander went after Sebastian. Jagger was nowhere in sight. Matt held Becky in his arms. While everyone was in chaos, I took a moment at the altar. I imagined Alexander and me standing together over the coffin. He\u0027d recite foreign words and lift his goblet and drink. Then I\u0027d do the same. We\u0027d face each other and stare into each other\u0027s eyes like a dream. He\u0027d take me in his arms and give me a lust-filled, passionate kiss, then slide his fangs up my shoulder until they met the nape of my neck. \"I\u0027ve been waiting for this day for an eternity,\" he\u0027d say. Then he\u0027d take the final plunge. I sighed, imagining how happy I\u0027d feel. I spun around to find no one else in the room but Trevor, who was staring straight at me. \"My turn?\" he said with a coy smile. \"I can be into freaky foreign customs, too.\" I grumbled and then stormed off the stage and out of the club.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-18.html","bookId":2146,"book":{"id":2146,"title":"Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8)","description":"Storyline: Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8) The morbidly monotonous Dullsville has finally become the most exciting place on earth now that Raven is madly in love with her hot vampire boyfriend Alexander, and a crew of vampires has taken residence in Dullsville\u0027s old mill.
