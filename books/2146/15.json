{"id":96245,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"A year ago today, my mom presented me with two homemade cakes, one in the shape of a one and the other in the shape of a six; Becky gave me a pewter necklace with a tiny charm of a bat; and I heard the news of a family moving into the Mansion on Benson Hill. The year that followed was a dream come true. Not only did I feel one year older, I felt many years wiser. I\u0027d met and fallen in love with a vampire. I\u0027d been shown the Underworld, his family, his friend, his nemesis, and experienced love on a level that was truly out of this world. It only made me excited for what this next year might bring me. But most exciting was that the Crypt would be opening tonight. I came downstairs to the sound of \"Happy Birthday\" being sung at different octaves by my family. Sweet sixteen had been received with more fanfare than not-so-sweet seventeen. But even so, my family didn\u0027t let my birthday go unnoticed. My dad kissed me on the cheek. My mom gave me a huge squeeze and handed me a card. I quickly opened it to find a birthday check. My brother slid a card to me across the table where he was eating breakfast. Enclosed was a gift card to our local coffee shop. \"Thanks, Billy. This is an awesome gift! Really.\" I gave my little brother a hug. He was surprised by my sudden display of affection and barely hugged me back. \"And tonight we\u0027re going to celebrate!\" my mom said. \"I got reservations at Pip\u0027s.\" Pip\u0027s was a mom-and-pop restaurant that specialized in one-of-a-kind meals, cheesy decor, and making a big deal about birthdays. \"Pip\u0027s? I\u0027m seventeen, not four,\" I said. \"Besides, tonight I was going to go out with my friends.\" My mother sighed. \"But I made reservations.\" The club was opening, and I was supposed to sit in a restaurant while all of Dullsville High was going to be bopping to the music of the Skeletons? \"Well, it\u0027s your birthday. If you don\u0027t want to celebrate it with your family . . . ,\" my mom said, deflated. \"Of course I do.\" I tried to hide my apathy. \"I invited Becky and Matt, too.\" \"I appreciate it,\" I said. My family quickly dispersed, engrossed in upcoming meetings, work, and school. It wasn\u0027t long before my little celebration was over and I found myself alone. When I reached the front door, there was a bouquet of flowers with a note. Happy Birthday. Love, Alexander I didn\u0027t have time to put them in a vase. Instead, I took them with me and hopped in Becky\u0027s truck. \"Those are beautiful,\" she said. \"He\u0027s so sweet,\" I said. \"He remembered.\" \"Haven\u0027t you been talking about your birthday all the time?\" she asked. \"Pretty much,\" I said. We both broke into giggles. Becky handed me a long box. \"Thanks,\" I said, ripping it open. It was a black shirt withTHE CRYPT written in white skeleton bone letters. \"This is the best present ever! How did you get it?\" \"I have connections,\" she said proudly. When I opened my locker I expected something nefarious to jump out. Instead, a bat-shaped box of chocolates was waiting for me. \"Aww,\" I said. \"Look what Alexander gave me.\" \"Those look delish!\" Becky said, almost salivating. \"If you need someone to share those with, you\u0027ve got your girl.\" I put the chocolates in my bag, wanting Alexander\u0027s presence to be close to me. I didn\u0027t have the protection of the darkness. The sun was out, and so was the blonde-haired monster. I didn\u0027t know what my nemesis had planned, so I was on edge the entire day. By the time I got home, I was fatigued. I plopped down on my bed and opened my backpack to get out the chocolates when I found something shiny. It was a small present with white wrapping paper and a silver bow. I opened the card to see what Alexander had snuck in my bag. The tiny card read, \"Happy Birthday, Monster Girl.\" I pushed it aside. No telling what was inside. I hung out in my room, texting Becky, checking messages, and putting laundry away. But nothing could get my mind off the shiny box. Finally curiosity got the best of me. I slowly opened the box. I knew it was going to be something dead. It was worse. Far worse than opening the present to find an empty box. What I saw was by far more nefarious and cunning. Trevor really got me this time. I found a small bracelet with RAVEN engraved in sterling silver, with two black leather bands united at a silver clasp. It was beautiful. Warmth flooded my veins, and my heart was reluctantly but still deeply moved. I was touched. And he knew I would be. Trevor took the time to buy something real for me. Instead of giving me a gag gift, he gave me the kind of present one gives to a best friend or true love. And it made me wonder if this was a sign of his feelings for me, especially after that powerful dream. For some reason I couldn\u0027t wipe the smile off my face. Trevor Mitchell wanted to wrap himself around my wrist. I put the bracelet back in the box and began to close it when, at the last second, I opened it again. No one was watching. I had to see what the bracelet looked like on. I placed it on my wrist and closed the clasp. The letters shined and the leather straps were really cool. Trevor did have good taste. I imagined the girlfriend he\u0027d ultimately have, him bathing her in jewels and then going out with someone else. Trevor knew I couldn\u0027t return it. First of all, it would have been rude - even for me. Who else could wear this gift with my unusual name on it? He wouldn\u0027t be able to get his money back on a custom design. And if I wore it to school, Trevor would know I liked it, and he\u0027d never wipe the gloating smile from his face. And worse, if I showed it to Alexander, my boyfriend would be really ticked off. Trevor ultimately had won his game. No one would know if I wore it for a while. I imagined that he\u0027d taken the time to have it ordered, bought it, and boxed it up, all while thinking of me. It was odd, to say the least. And odder still that I didn\u0027t want to remove it quite yet. But then I got a text from Alexander. He must have woken up early, before the sun set, and was restless in his coffin. And then I remembered how real boyfriends behaved. The kind that didn\u0027t kiss one girl and give presents to another. I quickly unclasped the bracelet and buried it, along with any pleasant thoughts of Trevor, in my dresser drawer. Alexander, handsome in a classy suit coat and black jeans, arrived at our front door with a bouquet of flowers. \"But you already gave me flowers this morning,\" I said. \"I couldn\u0027t be there to see your face,\" he said, handing them to me. \"Now I can.\" I gave him a huge kiss and we stepped inside. \"Those are beautiful,\" my mother said, coming down the stairs and wrangling an earring in her ear. \"I\u0027ll get a vase.\" \"I\u0027d like to take one to dinner,\" I said. \"You can wear it in your hair,\" my mother said like a former hippie. The last time I\u0027d wanted flowers pinned on me was when Alexander gave me a corsage for the Snow Ball. I\u0027d pricked my finger and he had made a strange expression I\u0027d since come to find out was that of a vampire looking at fresh blood. I made sure not to tempt my boyfriend in front of my parents. Instead of using pins and needles, Alexander was kind enough to clip the flower in my barrette. When we got to the restaurant, it was hard not to think of the Crypt, even while so much fussing was going on. I was so anxious to get to the club. Even though we could sit down immediately, we\u0027d be ordering appetizers, main courses, and desserts. It would be ages until we\u0027d be able to meet the gang at the dance club. Alexander must have sensed my anxiousness. He rested his hand on my twitching leg. I was suddenly overcome with a sense of peace. I was relaxed. I scanned the table. I had a great mother and father, and though they never understood me, they still were always there for me. My brother, Billy, who was the biggest pest in the world, was texting Henry as if no one knew and would occasionally answer a question without even looking up. But still, there he sat, celebrating my birthday. My best friend, who was there for me, laughing and gossiping since the day we met, and her boyfriend. And of course, the love of my life, my vampire soulmate, who had taken my blood as his own. I realized I was with the most gorgeous guy - holding his hand and wearing one of the flowers he\u0027d given me in my hair. I didn\u0027t want to be anywhere else. And when that horrible moment came, when the waitstaff brought a candlelit dessert and my family and a few patrons sang \"Happy Birthday,\" and I blushed beet red, I kind of liked it. I looked around the room as the single candle blazed in the sundae. I had a best friend, a family, and my true love. What else could I want? I really had everything I wanted sitting at the table - except the one thing I\u0027d been wishing for since I was in kindergarten: to become a vampire. I closed my eyes, wished, and blew out the candle to cheers and applause. I wondered just how many more years I\u0027d be making that wish. As we got out of the Mercedes and headed through the back alley to the Crypt, Alexander pulled me aside. \"This is my real gift. I didn\u0027t want to freak out your parents.\" \"Then what were the flowers?\" \"Just a prelude gift.\" \"What is it?\" I asked coyly. \"You\u0027ll see.\" He handed me a box. I only hoped it wasn\u0027t a bracelet that said \"Raven.\" I wouldn\u0027t know what to do. I opened the box. There wasn\u0027t a bracelet. Instead there was a slender silver eternity ring with petite black diamonds. The center diamond was in the shape of a small heart. Chills ran down my spine. I almost fainted right there in the alley of the Crypt. \"Alexander - I don\u0027t know what to say. This is beautiful!\" \"This way you\u0027ll always know that just because I haven\u0027t turned you doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t be together forever.\" \"How can you afford this?\" I asked. \"How could I not afford it?\" \"I\u0027ve never had anything real - besides a pearl necklace my parents gave me last year for my birthday.\" \"Just put it on.\" Tears welled in my eyes. Nothing I\u0027d ever owned twinkled liked the ring I was now holding. I slid it on my right ring finger. \"It fits?\" he asked eagerly. \"It\u0027s like having the stars on my finger,\" I said, jumping up and down. I reached up to him and gave him the most passionate kiss I\u0027d ever given. \"Get a room, dudes. Or at least a car,\" Sebastian said, slapping Alexander on the back. I showed Sebastian the ring. \"Are you getting married?\" he asked. \"Dude - \" \"It\u0027s not an engagement ring,\" I said. \"It\u0027s an eternity ring.\" Luna spied the glistening ring and bore her fangs at me. The expression she wore spoke volumes. \"It\u0027s time we get to the club. We\u0027ve been waiting forever for it to open!\" Alexander said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-15.html","bookId":2146,"book":{"id":2146,"title":"Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8)","description":"Storyline: Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8) The morbidly monotonous Dullsville has finally become the most exciting place on earth now that Raven is madly in love with her hot vampire boyfriend Alexander, and a crew of vampires has taken residence in Dullsville\u0027s old mill.
