{"id":96243,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Alexander and I had a midnight date at the cemetery. We hadn\u0027t seen each other alone in days and were both missing each other incredibly.\\n\\n When I finally reached the back of the cemetery, Alexander hadn\u0027t arrived. Then I saw a figure lurking in the shadows. I raced to him, until I noticed blonde hair.\\n\\n Trevor took my arm. \"It\u0027s okay,\" he said. \"No one will notice.\" \"But I\u0027m in love withAlexander,\" I told him firmly. \"And I\u0027m in love with . . . you.\" \"You are not.\" His stare was riveting. \"But you know that I am.\" He was right. I\u0027d felt it for years. Trevor stepped even closer to me. \"Are you going to punish me for the rest of my life? Because I wear khakis and don\u0027t listen to that rancid music?\" His green eyes bore through me to the bottom of my combat boots. \"I\u0027m not punishing you. I don\u0027t love you. I love Alex - \" I tried to step back, but he still held my arm.\\n\\n Then he leaned in so close I thought our lips would touch. \"But what if you hadn\u0027t met him?\" he whispered. \"And I came to you, like I did tonight. Just us. No one ever knowing.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t turn away. \"I don\u0027t know . . . I\u0027d probably feel the same way I do now.\" \"But maybe you wouldn\u0027t,\" he urged in his sexy, almost breathless tone. \"Are you really being true to yourself? We\u0027ve known each other since we were kids. Not evenAlexander can say that.\" His fingers slid down my sleeve so they reached my hand. \"We\u0027re not all that different. I\u0027ve been saying that for years.\" He paused.\\n\\n I was slightly afraid of what he\u0027d do next.\\n\\n His fingers slid down between mine. Trevor Mitchell was holding my hand. His grip was powerful, like that of a handsome athlete. He\u0027d crossed a line. I was holding someone else\u0027s hand. This hand wasn\u0027t Alexander\u0027s, but it felt good, too. Like I was supposed to have held his hand and touched him. As if I\u0027d been waiting all my life.\\n\\n Trevor had grabbed me before but this was different. It didn\u0027t feel like he was trying to get back at me or put a notch on his headboard. It felt as if he was doing it because he wanted to more than anything else.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" he said. He drew my hair back from my face. \"This is about you and me now. Not anyone else. They can\u0027t keep us apart any longer. You can\u0027t keep us apart. This is meant to be.\" His movements were tender and his voice soft and sincere.\\n\\n He pulled me to him so our chests were touching and he wrapped his arms around my waist. We stood face-to face. He smiled his gorgeous smile.\\n\\n No one was around. I wasn\u0027t scared. His hands were strong, and I felt a power from him. He smelled sweet, and his muscular body was warm. His eyes shined like the moonlight.\\n\\n Before I could pull away, he leaned in and kissed me. His lips were magnetic and tender. I wasn\u0027t sure why I wasn\u0027t mad. For a moment, I was lost in his kiss.\\n\\n I could feel his hands on my back pockets as he pulled me closer to him. It took all my strength to turn away from him. For some reason I found his lips as riveting as his gaze. \"I can\u0027t,\" I said. \"I came here for Alexander, not you.\" \"But you stayed for me.\" His tone was as sincere as his kiss. It was then that he stepped back.\\n\\n He held out the necklace he must have gotten from my pocket when he kissed me. The key swung back and forth like a medal.\\n\\n \"Monster Girl,\" he whispered. \"No - \" I said. \"No!!!\" I awoke with a jolt to find Nightmare pawing at my shirt. I sat up. I could barely breathe. Nightmare jumped back, startled. Stunned, I reached out and grabbed my cat. \"It\u0027s just you pawing at me. Not that monster.\" I cuddled my cat. Both our hearts were racing. \"I had a horrible nightmare, Nightmare. And not the good kind.\" I got up, went to the bathroom and splashed water on my face, and tried to calm myself with a cup of water.\\n\\n I switched the light on and hopped back into bed, put Nightmare on the pillow next to me, and pulled the covers over my head.\\n\\n It was the first time I ever remember sleeping with the light on. The following morning, when Becky and I were walking to our lockers, I couldn\u0027t hold it in any longer. \"Do you ever have weird dreams?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"All the time.\" \"Do they mean anything?\" \"Some people say they do. But others don\u0027t. What did you dream?\" \"That I . . . I can\u0027t even say it.\" I sunk my head. \"It was that bad?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then I wouldn\u0027t worry about it. What did you eat before you went to bed?\" \"I don\u0027t remember.\" \"It might have interfered with your sleep. That\u0027s all.\" \"I dreamed Trevor was in love with me.\" I spit it out like it was bad food. \"You\u0027ve just now figured that out?\" she asked. \"Why does everyone say that?\" \"Because he\u0027s obsessed with you.\" I shook off her comment. \"But it gets worse, if you can imagine.\" \"Tell me.\" \"In the dream . . .\" \"Yes?\" \"I was in love with him, too.\" She paused. \"That\u0027s it?\" \"I was in love with him. Don\u0027t you see why it was a nightmare?\" \"It\u0027s just a dream, Raven. If dreams were real, then I\u0027d be a ballerina.\" \"Really? I thought you\u0027d say that I was secretly passionately in love with Trevor Mitchell.\" \"Gross! Besides, you are already in love withAlexander. There is no room for anyone else.\" Relieved, I hugged Becky with the force of a million best friends. I was almost afraid I\u0027d squash the life out of her.\\n\\n Just before the sun set, I headed for the bathroom to get ready to go to the Crypt. Alexander\u0027s birthday was coming up and I still hadn\u0027t filled the vial. It wouldn\u0027t be too hard to prick my finger with a sterilized pin, but I\u0027d been putting it off while being consumed with the Crypt. I was standing in front of the mirror, applying corpse white foundation, when I inadvertently broke the scab on the corner of my lip. The wound on my face reopened.\\n\\n \"Darn it!\" I grumbled. I was so embarrassed by my crazy face. I reached for more cover-up as a little spot of blood arose. But then I remembered, I needed it this time.\\n\\n I grabbed a Dixie Cup and let a few drops fall into it. I pushed my tongue against the inside of my cheek, forcing more blood to drip. I didn\u0027t need much to fill the small vial. Within a few minutes, I had enough. I washed my wound and pressed it with a wet tissue, holding it for a few minutes. It was then my mom opened the door.\\n\\n I quickly stepped in front of the cup and stuck the vial in my pocket. \"What are you doing?\" she asked. \"What are you doing?\" I asked. \"This is a private area.\" \"I didn\u0027t realize anyone was in here!\" \"Well, I am! And I\u0027m busy.\"\\n\\n \"I just needed your flat iron,\" she said. She opened the top drawer and grabbed the flat iron. I leaned over and pushed the cup behind a towel with my fingers, afraid that she\u0027d notice the bloody cup in the mirror.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that on your face?\" she asked. \"Tissue?\" \"Mom, please.\"\\n\\n \"I can help you. That happens all the time. You just have to press it for a while and then use some cover-up. But don\u0027t pick at it.\"\\n\\n \"Mom, I know what to do.\" I leaned against the sink\u0027s counter, blocking the cup from her view, and tried to urge her out. \"Please, just give me some private time.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if you need me, let me know,\" she said, closing the door behind her. This time, I locked it.\\n\\n I took the vial out of my pocket and carefully poured the Dixie Cup\u0027s contents into it. When I was finished, I crumpled the cup and threw it in the garbage can. I secured the vial and wrapped several tissues around it. I was exhausted, having come within seconds of being caught and having to explain to my mother why I was trying to fill\\n\\n a vial with blood. But ultimately I was pleased with my present for Alexander. I glanced at myself in the mirror. Dating a vampire wasn\u0027t as easy as I had always dreamed it would be.\\n\\n Though the Crypt\u0027s opening was only a few days away, I turned my attention to Alexander\u0027s birthday. We had said we\u0027d have a joint celebration at the Crypt, but I couldn\u0027t let this special day go by without a separate celebration. I\u0027d spent the afternoon decorating the outside of the Mansion, and Jameson was kind enough to let me in to decorate Alexander\u0027s room with a few balloons. Now I was waiting impatiently in the gazebo for the sun to set. This was nothing new. My whole life, I was always waiting for the bright sun to disappear from view. But tonight I was ultra-impatient. It was my boyfriend\u0027s eighteenth birthday.\\n\\n When the sun was out of view, I raced into the Mansion and up the grand staircase. I burst into Alexander\u0027s room and yelled, \"Surprise!\"\\n\\n He stood, sleepy and dreamy. His hair was tousled and his shirtless chest was lean and pale against his dark boxer shorts.\\n\\n Alexander crept out of his closet room into his regular attic room. He fought his way through a few dozen black balloons. \"I thought we were going to celebrate together,\" he said, \"at the Crypt.\" \"We are. But not now. Get dressed.\" \"I mean both our birthdays. We were going to plan a joint party.\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t let yours go by without a private celebration.\" I gave him a big squeeze and an even bigger kiss, then anxiously danced around while he put on a T-shirt, jeans, and boots. Then I took him by the hand and led him to the Mansion\u0027s backyard.\\n\\n I\u0027d decorated the gazebo with black and purple streamers and bat, spider, and pumpkin balloons. Two floor-length candelabras lit the outdoor room.\\n\\n \"Wow - you went all out,\" he said. \"But you always do.\" \"Happy eighteenth birthday, Alexander!\" I said as he took in the decorations. \"Wow - I\u0027m dating a man.\" \"Weren\u0027t you always?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but there is something sexy about you being official. You are also two years older than me right now. I love an older man.\" I gave him a coy kiss.\\n\\n \"This is really cool how you decorated the backyard,\" he said. \"You really are great at design.\" \"Thanks!\" I said, beaming as bright as the moon. \"Now I want to give you your gift.\" \"Isn\u0027t this party enough?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" I handed him the small box. He took his time unwrapping it. \"Hurry,\" I said. \"I\u0027m trying to guess what it is.\" \"You\u0027re not supposed to guess. You are supposed to open it.\" \"Wow, Raven, this is really cool. He held it up to the candlelight. The snake is really awesome.\" \"There\u0027s something inside it.\" He was surprised at first but shook it and noticed the movement of liquid. \"Me,\" I said.\\n\\n He held the vial in his hands and pulled me toward him so intently. \"Wow - I don\u0027t know what to say,\" Alexander murmured. \"This is the best birthday ever,\" he raved.\\n\\n He put the necklace on, and it looked amazing hanging around his neck. \"I\u0027m never going to take it off,\" he said, giving me a juicy kiss.\\n\\n Jameson arrived with a chocolate cake in the shape of a black palette with candles looking like small paintbrushes. As he and I began singing to Alexander, a third voice joined in. Sebastian stepped out of the shadows as the song came to an end. \"Happy birthday, dude!\" he said. I couldn\u0027t help but invite one guest. I knew it would be romantic to have an intimate dinner withAlexander, but with his best friend in town, it wouldn\u0027t be the same if he wasn\u0027t included.\\n\\n Jameson and Sebastian gave Alexander a large box with a bow. Inside was a guitar. \"Wow - thank you!\" \"Now you can really have a garage band,\" Sebastian said. The four of us sat at the table, eating cake and talking and laughing over the sound of a wailing guitar. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-13.html","bookId":2146,"book":{"id":2146,"title":"Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8)","description":"Storyline: Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8) \\n The morbidly monotonous Dullsville has finally become the most exciting place on earth now that Raven is madly in love with her hot vampire boyfriend Alexander, and a crew of vampires has taken residence in Dullsville\u0027s old mill.
