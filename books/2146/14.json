I sat up to find Becky standing by my bed. \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked. \"Am I late for school? It\u0027s Saturday, isn\u0027t it?\" But Becky wasn\u0027t interested in the days of the week. She handed me a cup of coffee from Javalicious. \"Thanks,\" I said. \"You\u0027ll need it. I just came from Matt\u0027s scrimmage.\" \"They played in the morning?\" \"No - you slept most of the day away.\" She opened the curtains and I was blinded by the sun. \"No - \" I said, squinting. I turned to look at my clock. It was four-fifteen. \"You need to be awake for this. Rumors are spreading that there are vampires living in Dullsville!\" Becky said. \"Can you believe that?\" \"What?\" \"I swear. Vampires, here in Dullsville. That\u0027s what people are saying.\" \"They said that whenAlexander moved here. Trevor started that one, remember?\" \"Well, they are saying it again.\" \"Where, when, and who?\" I asked. \"I need names.\" \"Well, you know it started when Sebastian bit Luna at Alexander\u0027s party.\" \"Yes, but they don\u0027t have proof that really happened.\" I yawned. \"But it\u0027s more than that. The soccer snobs and other students were weirded out whenAlexander, Sebastian, Scarlet, Onyx, Jagger, and Luna came to the game,\" Becky confessed. \"That\u0027s not news. . . .\" \"They said they\u0027re . . . freaks.\" \"They\u0027ve said that about me all my life. That\u0027s nothing new either.\" \"You know how people talk. Jagger and his entourage don\u0027t go to school and are only seen at night. Scarlet drives a skull and Jagger a hearse.\" \"Yes, I guess it does look a bit weird to Dullsvillians. But totally normal to me.\" I smiled with pride. \"Matt said Trevor told him that Scarlet has fangs, and others are saying they live in graves in the factory.\" Coffins, I wanted to correct her. \"Trevor will say anything,\" I said. \"And they live in the mill because they are making it into a dance club.\" \"I know that, and you know that. But it\u0027s not just Trevor. Even Matt thinks things are strange.\" \"He does?\" \"But not too strange. He knows Alexander. But like me, he\u0027s a bit worried that those guys are living in that creepy factory.\" \"They are fine. Really.\" \"But there\u0027s more.\" \"Yes?\" \"No one wants to go to the club now.\" \"Are you serious?\" She nodded. \"He\u0027s going to be opening up the Crypt in just two days! If no one comes, then he\u0027s going to close it.\" Now I was the one freaking out. \"I\u0027m sorry to be the one to tell you,\" she said sincerely. \"No, I\u0027m glad you did. I\u0027d hate for that part to be a surprise.\" I had to get to the factory. Jagger couldn\u0027t close the Crypt before he opened it. As soon as it was dark, I rushed to the Sinclair Mill and whisked past Scarlet and Onyx without even saying hi and headed straight for Jagger, Alexander, and Sebastian, who were having celebratory drinks. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Alexander said. \"Everyone at school is saying that vampires are living here. Now no one wants to come to the club\u0027s opening. We have to do something. We only have two days!\" \"What do you mean?\" Jagger said. \"Just that. Rumors about us - you guys. That you are vampires. Sebastian bit Luna. You don\u0027t go to school and are never seen in the daylight. These people live for that stuff. Then you throw in a skull car and a hearse. I told you it wasn\u0027t safe for you to have an underground club here. Now do you see what I mean?\" \"How are we going to open if no one shows?\" Sebastian wondered. Failure wasn\u0027t in Jagger\u0027s vocabulary. \"They\u0027ll have to show,\" he said defiantly. \"Dude, we have to have girls here to make this work,\" Sebastian said. Luna shot him a dirty look. \"And guys, too.\" \"Stop. Let me think,\" Jagger said. \"What if we change? We\u0027ll have to make our look be more \u0027friendly.\u0027\" \"So you guys are going to be preps?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s a thought.\" \"Your hair is white with blood-red tips,\" I said. \"I can dye it brown.\" \"And Luna - her pink hair?\" \"I\u0027m not touching my hair,\" she said. \"And what about all your tats? You\u0027re just going to scrape them off?\" \"We\u0027ll cover ours up,\" Jagger said. He didn\u0027t like that I was challenging his idea. \"No. You can\u0027t change who you are. I\u0027ve been this way my whole life and I\u0027ve never changed,\" I said firmly. \"And they accepted you?\" Jagger charged. They all turned to me, already knowing the answer. \"This is about business,\" Jagger said. \"Not about making friends.\" \"But it is,\" I said. \"You can\u0027t not be who you are. That\u0027s why I love you guys. If you change, then you\u0027ll be like everyone else in town. I can\u0027t have you do that. There\u0027s got to be another way.\" \"Then can you tell me what it is?\" Jagger challenged. \"I have already invested a lot of money in this. You told me how everyone in town would come here to dance. Now you are telling me they aren\u0027t. What do you suggest I do?\" There was only one person in Dullsville who could change everyone\u0027s mind. \"Trevor Mitchell,\" I said. \"If he\u0027s on board, then everyone in town will be, too.\" \"We\u0027ll have to do more than just show up to his soccer game,\" Jagger said. \"This time, we\u0027ll have to make him a partner.\" It wasn\u0027t too long before Scarlet returned with Trevor. Apparently all it took was a few texts, several lip-locks, and the promise of even more power in Dullsville than he already had to convince him to accept a one-on-one meeting with Jagger. Jagger didn\u0027t hold the meeting in his office. With its walls adorned with cemetery sketches and a tarantula creeping in an aquarium, not to mention its location across the hall from the room filled with coffins, it wasn\u0027t the ideal setting. Instead Jagger held the meeting with the blonde jock in a small, vacant room on the top floor. I paced outside the room while Sebastian and Alexander downed blood-filled glasses and the girls calmed their nerves by painting their nails black. There wasn\u0027t a clock in the Crypt, but it seemed like the two were holed up for ages. Finally I couldn\u0027t bear it anymore. \"More cobwebs are going to form if they don\u0027t hurry,\" I said to the gang. \"What are they talking about in there?\" Just then the door creaked open. Trevor didn\u0027t make eye contact but just headed down the stairs. We all had our hearts in our stomachs, waiting for the result. \"He agreed!\" Jagger declared proudly. \"We\u0027re back in business.\" \"Yay!\" Scarlet, Onyx, and I cheered. Scarlet raced downstairs after Trevor to take him home. \"It means your portion goes down,\" Jagger said, putting his arm around Sebastian. \"We all had to give a little.\" Jagger opened a Romanian wine bottle and poured thick red liquid into tiny shot glasses. Everyone but me took one. I held one filled with cranberry juice. \"Here\u0027s to the Crypt,\" Jagger said. \"And sacrifice.\" Dullsville High had an unusual air about it. Instead of the normal school malaise or enthusiasm about sports and upcoming dances, this Monday the halls were filled with a different kind of buzzing, and the excitement couldn\u0027t be contained in the whispers. A crowd had gathered at the end of the hallway by the gym. Becky and I pushed our way through, dying to find out what all the fuss was about. Dance music was being played. \"It\u0027s awesome,\" Trevor said, handing out flyers. \"Nothing in town like it.\" \"This will be cool,\" one student said. \"I\u0027ll tell my friends.\" \"I can\u0027t wait until it opens.\" Nothing was cool in town without Trevor\u0027s stamp of approval. Even a few teachers were more interested in the club than they were in shutting down Trevor\u0027s makeshift promotional stand. \"I\u0027m all out, people, but I\u0027ll have more tomorrow,\" Trevor said. Students dispersed with their plastic vampire teeth, stickers, and flyers. My nemesis spotted me and his smile grew even bigger. \"So now I\u0027m part owner of a club,\" he said to me. \"I\u0027ll definitely have all access. I might even be able to remove your name from the VIP guest list if you\u0027re not too careful.\" \"I don\u0027t think that will happen. You aren\u0027t that powerful.\" He got up in my face. \"I\u0027m not sure you know all the terms of our agreement,\" he said, his green eyes blazing through me. \"What does that mean?\" I said, squaring off against him. \"The terms and conditions of me becoming part owner of said club, the Crypt. But that\u0027s not important now, because I also heard it\u0027s not too much longer till your birthday. Then you\u0027ll get the surprise you\u0027ve been waiting for all your life.\" \"Your funeral?\" He laughed. It was hard for me to make direct eye contact with Trevor after I had had that lust-filled dream about him. I felt that somehow he knew I\u0027d dreamed it - like it showed in my face. As he packed up his iPod, he said, \"I\u0027m missing something, and I think that you might know where it is.\" \"Geez, your brain? Intelligence? A sense of goodwill toward man? We could be here all day.\" \"A certain necklace with a key. I thought you might know where it is.\" \"Hey - if you need to keep your house key around your neck, then you have bigger worries. Try pinning it to your mittens next time.\" \"It\u0027s not a big deal, really. Jagger can just make me another. Besides, it might have slipped off when I was making out with Scarlet in the woods.\" \"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s what happened.\" He grasped my wrist. \"Don\u0027t worry, Monster Girl, you\u0027ll get your chance when we have that one dance on opening night. Jagger promised me many things. And that was one.\" \"Jagger can\u0027t promise you anything about me!\" I said, withdrawing my arm. \"I\u0027m not for sale!\" \"Fine, then I\u0027ll just stop telling people about the club. And tell them about the ghouls who live in the Sinclair Mill instead.\" \"You said you\u0027d help!\" I said, getting in his face. \"For a small dance . . . ,\" he retorted, his gaze softening. I imagined the Crypt\u0027s opening night. The vampires and me standing around, with rooms empty of clubsters. Jagger, Scarlet, and Sebastian tearing down the decorations, packing up their coffins, and driving the hearse, skull Beetle, and Mustang back to Hipsterville. \"Fine, you\u0027ll have your stupid dance,\" I said through gritted teeth. \"Just keep posting and handing out those flyers.\" I turned away and stormed off. \"I knew you\u0027d come around to my way of thinking,\" he called after me. \"You\u0027ll be begging for more.\" Just after sunset, I stormed over to the Sinclair Mill. Jagger was at the bar on his cell while the rest of the gang was hanging out. \"How could you?\" I shouted. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Alexander asked. \"He knows what\u0027s wrong!\" I said, pointing to Jagger. \"Me?\" Jagger said naively. \"How could he what?\" Alexander said with great concern. \"Sell me off to Trevor!\" I was so upset my fists were balled up and my lips were quivering. \"It\u0027s one dance,\" Jagger said. \"I\u0027m not for sale!\" I said. \"What did you do, Jagger?\" Alexander\u0027s pale face flushed red with anger. \"Dude, what were you thinking?\" Sebastian said. \"That\u0027s all he asked for. I tried money, but he said he wanted one dance with Raven on opening night. I figured you wouldn\u0027t care. It\u0027s just one dance.\" \"Are you kidding? You\u0027ve crossed the line!\" Alexander rose. \"Raven is not for sale.\" He was face-to-face with Jagger. Alexander was madder than I was. \"I figured Raven wouldn\u0027t care. It was for the good of the club, and she was so happy to have it open,\" Jagger said. \"But fine. I\u0027ll call him and tell him the deal\u0027s off.\" He picked up his cell phone. \"Stop - \" I said. \"Don\u0027t call him.\" \"Are you crazy?\" Alexander exclaimed. \"It\u0027s just one stupid dance. And it can be a fast dance. And you\u0027ll be right next to me,\" I told Alexander. \"I\u0027ll be there, too,\" Sebastian said, to the chagrin of Luna. \"And so will I,\" Jagger added firmly. I was truly touched with my vampire bodyguard entourage. \"This sounds exciting now.\" I beamed. Scarlet was sulking. It should have been her Trevor was asking to dance with. \"It\u0027s just to get back at me,\" I said, putting my arm around her. \"It\u0027s all that boy lives for.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-14.html","bookId":2146,"book":{"id":2146,"title":"Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8)","description":"Storyline: Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8) The morbidly monotonous Dullsville has finally become the most exciting place on earth now that Raven is madly in love with her hot vampire boyfriend Alexander, and a crew of vampires has taken residence in Dullsville\u0027s old mill.
