{"id":96233,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"What happened to your lip?\" Becky asked when I hopped into her truck the following morning before school. \"Did Alexander get carried away with you?\"\\n\\n \"Is it that noticeable?\" I pulled down the visor and checked my reflection in the mirror--anact I wouldn\u0027t be able to do if I were a vampire someday. I struggled with the idea that I would no longer be able to see myself and what that simple task would mean for me. To never be able to adjust things such as makeup, hair, and my clothes.\\n\\n Alexander was gorgeous naturally. Iwasn\u0027t sure that Iwas readyfor the world to see me without being able to present myself the way I wanted to be seen.\\n\\n As Itouched up mycut withcorpse white cover-up, Ifelt a renewed sense of confidence. It wasn\u0027t the kind of confidence one feels when securing oneself with makeup but rather an internal assurance and peace. I felt as if I couldn\u0027t containmyglow.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s up withyou?\" Beckysaid. \"You can\u0027t seem to stop smiling.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just inlove. . . .\" I said dreamily.\\n\\n \"Me too. We are bothso luckywe found good guys. Istill can\u0027t believe that we bothhave boyfriends, canyou?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Isaid honestly.\\n\\n We drove past the covered bridge that met the winding road leading up to the factory on the outskirts of town. I could see the smokestacks high above the trees, as if they were deliberately taunting me--reminding me of Jagger\u0027s presence.\\n\\n \"But Ihave so muchonmymind,\" Isaid, slightlyhinting to Becky.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"If there was something youwanted to happenbut it might be a threat to others, what would you do?\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t want it to happen.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s that simple?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Why would I want something that was not good for everyone?\"\\n\\n Becky was analtruist. That\u0027s why she was such a good friend to me. But in this case I would have preferred she be a bit more cynical.\\n\\n \"Why would it be bad?\" she asked, worried. \"Is this about you and Alexander?\"\\n\\n \"It might not be bad,\" I confessed, and it was true, since I didn\u0027t ultimately know Jagger\u0027s plans. I was just going by his previous history.\\n\\n \"I think it would be easier if you just told me what you are talking about instead of being so cryptic.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not reallya threat, not now anyway,\" Isaid.\\n\\n \"Iguess you\u0027d have to take the threatening part away. That\u0027s the onlywayit would work.\"\\n\\n I thought about what Becky said. If some how I made sure that no vampires were invited to the Crypt, other than the ones already inhabiting the vacant mill, then maybe there wouldn\u0027t be a threat. I knew Onyx and Scarlet, and so far they didn\u0027t seem to take advantage of unsuspecting mortals. If Sebastianliked Luna, Onyxhad her fangs set on Jagger, and we kept a close eye onScarlet\u0027s fondness for Trevor, all the vampires would be accounted for.\\n\\n Perhaps it could be a funplace for Dullsville\u0027s highschool students to hang out. Theycould, at last, finally understand what I\u0027ve beencraving all mylife. Maybe the darkness could make them, too, feel more alive than ever.\\n\\n And it could be a huge, morbid playpen for me.\\n\\n \"You are a genius,\" I declared.\\n\\n \"Now are you going to tell me what you are talking about?\"\\n\\n Just then my cell beeped. It was a text from Alexander.\\n\\n I can\u0027t sleep. Thinking of you.\\n\\n I melted inside, knowing that my boyfriend was lying in his coffin and dreaming of me. And though I loved Alexander\u0027s mysteryand old-fashioned style, I was grateful to be a not-so-normal girl witha not-so-normal boyfriend now that we were able to communicate like a normal couple.\\n\\n I quickly texted back.\\n\\n Miss you like crazy.\\n\\n I held the phone out to Beckyproudly. \"Alexander,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I have something to tell you. . .\" mybest friend said as we pulled into the entrance to school. \"There are rumors aboutAlexander\u0027s party. Some people are saying Sebastianbit Luna. Like for real--like a vampire!\"\\n\\n \"Why would they say that?\" I asked skeptically.\\n\\n \"Someone swore they saw blood and the rumor snowballed. Now some kids are freaked out. They\u0027ve beentalking about it all week. Iwas kind of afraid to tell you. Ididn\u0027t want youto be upset. But it isn\u0027t going away.\"\\n\\n \"So? That\u0027s all these people do is talk.\"\\n\\n \"But Ithink it doesn\u0027t reallymatter, since Sebastianand those guys aren\u0027t evenhere anymore.\"\\n\\n They are still here, I wanted to say. I weighed my thoughts. I wasn\u0027t sure if it was time to tell her Sebastian and Jagger were sequestered in the factory, making a second Coffin Club.\\n\\n \"I kind of wish Sebastianhadn\u0027t left,\" she said in a tone that was mostlysaved for a confessional. \"Not because I like him--inthat way--but there was something different about him. LikeAlexander and that Jagger guy. Ireally can\u0027t put myfinger onit. They\u0027re different from the guys here.\"\\n\\n Because they are vampires, I wanted to say.\\n\\n \"It must be that Europeancharisma,\" she finallysaid.\\n\\n \"Yes, that must be it.\" Ismiled.\\n\\n Beckypulled into the student parking lot and turned off the truck. \"Your birthdayis coming soon,\" she said excitedly as we got out and headed toward the mainentrance. \"What do youwant to do? We could all go to Hatsy\u0027s or Hooligans.\"\\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t what Ireallyhad inmind.\"\\n\\n \"The cemetery?\" she asked nervously.\\n\\n I smiled again. I hadn\u0027t thought much about celebrating my birthday. Ever since I was little, all my parties were duds and the only ones I ever enjoyed were when Becky and I just stayed up all night pigging out on brownies,chips, and super-sugared and hyper-caffeinated sodas and endlessly watching vampire movies.\\n\\n \"Alexander turns eighteenjust before mybirthday. Ithink we should just have one partytogether.\"\\n\\n \"That sounds awesome! Maybe we canhave it at the Mansion,\" she suggested.\\n\\n \"Did I hear it\u0027s going to be someone\u0027s birthday?\" a familiar male\u0027s voice said from behind me.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t even bother turning around and continued walking, but that didn\u0027t stop mynemesis from disturbing me. He jumped in front of me, blocking my way.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been a whole year, has it?\" he asked in a syrupytone. \"Maybe this birthday I\u0027ll finally give you what you\u0027ve always wanted.\"\\n\\n Becky was shocked and blushed. But I wasn\u0027t moved.\\n\\n Trevor was as menacing as he was gorgeous. If he were a vampire, he\u0027d be the dark kind, the kind that sneaks up on innocent girls and bites without a thought. Trevor possessed many of the qualities of a vampire without actually being one. He constantly preyed upon me, was deeply charismatic, and tried to suck the life out of me.\\n\\n Trevor could have anygirl he wanted--except for me. But for some reason, I\u0027d always beena thorninhis side,maybe one that he never really wanted to get rid of.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll just have to Lysol myself and make sure to get a rabies shot,\" he said. \"Iwon\u0027t turnonthe lights. For my protection--not yours.\" He leaned inso close to me I thought for a moment he was going to kiss me.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t forget to bring your `Dating for Dummies\u0027 handbook,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll need it.\"\\n\\n Instead of scowling, his face lit up witha glistening white, devilishsmile. It was as if I\u0027d made his dayand our quick and battling banter were like an aphrodisiac to him. He winked at me before he arrogantly turned away and disappeared into the crowd of students.\\n\\n Becky appeared weary as we headed to our lockers, but I remained unperturbed.\\n\\n At the moment, celebrating our birthdays ina joint partyshould have beenthe biggest event inmylife. UsuallyI\u0027d be obsessed with thoughts of decorating the mansion with bat-shaped balloons, dark purple streamers, and a monster-size chocolate cake with tiny coffins.\\n\\n But Icouldn\u0027t think of anything else whenJagger and his friends were secluded inthe vacant mill, designing its transformationinto one of the most cryptic of all clubs. WithAlexander\u0027s best friend onlya short distance away from the Mansion, insecret, I knew I wouldn\u0027t be able to invite him or the others. It felt like a stake throughmyheart and made me miserablylonelyfor myboyfriend\u0027s sake.\\n\\n The whole birthday celebration was already ripe with drama. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-3.html","bookId":2146,"book":{"id":2146,"title":"Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8)","description":"Storyline: Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8) \\n The morbidly monotonous Dullsville has finally become the most exciting place on earth now that Raven is madly in love with her hot vampire boyfriend Alexander, and a crew of vampires has taken residence in Dullsville\u0027s old mill.
