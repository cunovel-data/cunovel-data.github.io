{"id":96235,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Alexander and I parked the Mercedes at a distance and traipsed through the darkness toward the factory. I would have felt like a scolded child, with Alexander dragging me back to return my stolen goods, but Alexander knew,too, that we had to double check Jagger\u0027s intentions to make sure the club he was building was safe for Alexander\u0027s life intownand for the mortal residents of Dullsville.\n We had three options. One, we could boldly go into the factory and face Jagger and Luna with my questions and admit I had their plans. Two, we could hang out and act natural, and while Alexander was chatting with the guys I could returnthe blueprint. Or three, bothAlexander and Icould sneak inand, withAlexander\u0027s nocturnal vampire vision, find our way to the office. The third was the riskiest, and thus, the most appealing to me. We both agreed that admitting that I\u0027d takenthe plans might be a cause for a brokentruce, so we decided to attempt the full sneak-in.\n It was a cool, windy night, and the leaves rustled in the trees as we passed by them. When we reached the gravel road we both sighed with relief. The road was empty of all familiar vehicles.\n I showed Alexander the door I\u0027d used to enter the factoryand we quickly snuck in.\n The empty, hollow factoryrooms were just as I\u0027d seenthem a few hours earlier.\n I illuminated the way with my flashlight, though Alexander could make out objects better than I could in the dark depths of the factory.\n We descended the rickety staircase and I led the way down the narrow, dark, and dank hallway until we reached the last two opposing doors.\n \"It\u0027s this one,\" I said. I reached for the door knob, but like the last time, it fell off in my hand.\n Alexander\u0027s face grew serious. \"Hurry!\"\n My hand shook as I stuck the knob back in its groove and tried to wind it so the latch would catch.\n Alexander anxiously tapped his monster boots on the cement floor. The sound echoed, causing me to be more nervous thanIalreadywas. Finally, the knob caught the latchand we were inside Jagger\u0027s office.\n I raced to the desk. The rolled-up blueprints were inthe same positionI\u0027d left them. Iquicklytook off the rubber band and unrolled them.\n \"Here.\" I showed Alexander the second set.\n Alexander peered at the plans. These drawings weren\u0027t as big as the Crypt\u0027s blueprints were.\n \"It looks like another club,\" I said, using what I\u0027d learned byexamining the Crypt\u0027s plans withAlexander.\n \"Yes . . .\" he said. \"Here\u0027s a small bar, a mainstage, and a game room.\"\n \"The Covenant . . .\" I said. \"This room has to be the one Jagger\u0027s planning as the vampire club. It\u0027s underground and secluded, just like the Dungeonis at the CoffinClub. He said it himself-- mortals above, vampires below.\"\n Alexander shook his head, frustrated bywhat we\u0027d just discovered.\n \"What\u0027s this?\" Iasked. Ipointed to a small unmarked boxdrawnopposite the mainstage.\n Alexander and I froze when we heard noises coming from upstairs.\n I could barely breathe.\n \"We\u0027ve got to go,\" he said, replacing the Crypt blueprints ontop of the ones for the Covenant. WhileAlexander headed for the doorway, I rolled them back up, being careful not to damage them in any way. I bound them with the rubber band and set them back into their original position.\n Now that we\u0027d accomplished the sneaking inpart, we\u0027d have to accomplishthe harder part--sneaking out.\n Alexander hung by the doorway as I grabbed my backpack and fumbled with my flashlight.\n I could hear noises above us getting closer, and I did my best not to panic.\n I tried to recover and tiptoed to the door, trying to avoid flashing the beam inAlexander\u0027s face. The light shook as I made my way between the desk and the filing cabinets. Suddenly my face banged hard into something.\n \"Are youokay?\"Alexander whispered.\n I felt the large metal object infront of me. It was cool to the touchand felt smooth. I\u0027d walked into one of the filing cabinets.\n \"Are youokay?\"Alexander asked again.\n I was too embarrassed and shocked to feel any pain. I shined the beam on the floor as I continued toward the doorway.\n \"What\u0027s that?\"Alexander whispered.\n \"What\u0027s what?\" Iwondered. \"Ididn\u0027t hear anything.\"\n \"That scent . . .\"\n \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s just mold. This place hasn\u0027t beencleaned inyears.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a bad smell . . . it\u0027s the scent of--\"\n It was then I felt the dewy drops on the side of my cheek. I must have broken open my wound when I ran into the cabinet.\n I stepped into the moonlight.Alexander\u0027s eyes lit up, thenhe backed away.\n Alexander didn\u0027t know what to do. If he got anycloser to me, he might be attracted to mymouth, withlust and thirst.\n We didn\u0027t have time for a romantic vampire moment betweenus.\n We heard the scuffling of footsteps coming down the staircase at the end of the hallway.\n \"They won\u0027t--\" I said. \"It\u0027s not enoughand theyare too far away.\"\n Alexander put his finger to his lips to direct me to be silent as they came down the corridor.\n \"You must wipe it away. Before--\"\n My cut was small, but the scent of blood would be ripe on a breezy night in an empty factory. If the vampires were close, it wouldn\u0027t take long until they\u0027d know a mortal was near.\n \"Do yousmell that?\" I heard someone say. I couldn\u0027t see them, but I could hear them shuffling around intheir coffin room.\n \"It\u0027s blood,\" I heard a voice say. I couldn\u0027t tell if it was Sebastianor Jagger.\n \"It must be from the bottle in your office. You left it there last night,\" Onyx said.\n \"Ifinished it,\" Jagger said.\n \"It\u0027s human,\" I heard a female voice say. \"Definitelynot ananimal.\"\n \"Yes, it\u0027s mortal. I could smell that a mile away.\"\n \"But whywould anyone be here?\" Irecognized Sebastian\u0027s voice.\n \"It could be a homeless person,\" Jagger said. \"Ican\u0027t keep track of everynook and crannyof this vast place.\"\n The voices were so close; I knew they had to be standing only a few feet away.\n I pulled my sleeve over my fist and pressed it to the crease of my mouth.\n Alexander\u0027s escape would be easyand painless and take onlyseconds. Inbat form, he could easily fly through the sky-high ceiling and out the crack in the window. I, on the other hand, had only two legs and a very impatient nature. Without someone to guide me out, I had only the help of my flashlight.\n \"I\u0027m not leaving youhere,\"Alexander said as if he was reading mythoughts.\n \"That handle gets stuck,\" Isaid. \"Maybe that could ward them off for a few minutes. Pushthe door closed.\"\n \"There\u0027s no other wayto escape,\" he said.\n I could only hope they would let me be--but withsucha temptationas my blood looming before them, now wasn\u0027t the time to find out. It was one thing for me to be inthe companyofAlexander. But it wasn\u0027t a good idea to be in the company of other, more impulsive vampires.\n Alexander peered throughthe crack of the doorway. \"They\u0027re intheir room. Now is our onlychance!\"\n He grabbed my hand and yanked me out of the room and toward the staircase. It was rickety and dangerous at best, but the elevator would be creakyand loud if it still worked. Not onlywould it draw attentionto us--it could trap us in a cryptic cage.\n We had just reached the stairs when the voices and footsteps emerged from the other end of the hallway. There was no time for a dash up and out. Alexander drew me behind the circular stairs and we stood close together in the shadows.\n \"Maybe Ishould tellAlexander I\u0027m still here,\" Sebastiansaid. \"What if he stumbles uponus, dude? He\u0027d be, like,double mad knowing Ihadn\u0027t told him Ididn\u0027t leave.\"\n \"Whyare we talking about this now?\" Jagger said. \"We might have anintruder.\"\n \"Because this is just as important.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you wait until the club is up and running?\" Jagger asked. \"Thenyoucaninvite him. Wouldn\u0027t that be cool?\"\n \"So, I just wait for months?\" Sebastian said. \"That\u0027s not cool, dude. Not cool at all. I have to face him again.\"\n Just then Sebastian stepped away from Jagger. He was standing in plain view of me. I held my breath. My combat boot was sticking out clearly in his sight line. Sebastian eyed it for what seemed like forever. Our cover was blown. I was unsure what he was going to do next.\n \"That\u0027s it--\" Sebastian declared. He turned his attention away from my boot and stared in Jagger\u0027s direction. \"I\u0027m going to the Mansion.\"\n \"Now?\" Jagger asked. \"But we have to find out who--\"\n \"You said it yourself. It could be anyone. We can make a clean sweep of this place later tonight. But right now I have to talk toAlexander.\"\n Sebastian started to go.\n \"Hey, hold on,\" Jagger said, grabbing his arm.\n I continued to breathe as shallowly as possible.\n \"If yougo--we\u0027ll all go,\" Jagger said. \"Idon\u0027t want youto be the onlygood guyinthis situation.\"\n \"A trip to the Mansion?\" Iheard Scarlet say.\n I heard more giggles and voices as they went up the steps and out of the factory, then car doors shutting and two engines starting. When we heard the cars drive out over gravel, Alexander and I tiptoed up the steps and peered out of a window to make sure theyhad reallyleft and this wasn\u0027t a prank. The hearse was driving downthe bumpy road, followed bySebastian\u0027s Mustang. For a moment it stopped. Sebastianglanced back at the window where I was standing. He stared right up at me, sending horror-film-like shivers through my flesh. Then he turned away and drove off.\n \"Did yousee that?\" Isaid toAlexander. He nodded and put his arm around me, relieved. Itried to catchmybreath,still nervous by our potentiallydangerous vampire encounter. I began to soak in the gesture of Sebastian\u0027s good deed.\n \"Sebastian maybe many things,\" I said. \"But your best friend has still got your back.\"\n Alexander and I went to the cemetery, where he cuddled me in his arms, trying to calm me down from our harrowing encounter, and we debated our next move. We sat together infront of his grandmother\u0027s monument,Alexander gently stroking my hair. It was still sinking in that he was so drawn to me in ways that most boyfriends aren\u0027t. He needed and craved me, thirsted for things about me that were onlyattractive to a vampire. Most girls at Dullsville High would be running away, but I was more attracted to him than ever.\n Alexander had his arm around me but his thoughts were far away.\n I could sense the ache he felt for the strain on his and Sebastian\u0027s relationship. If Becky and I were fighting--which hardly ever happened--we\u0027d apologize within minutes. But they were guys. I was happy that Sebastian had the strength to talk to Alexander. Alexander was relieved to know that Sebastian made the attempt.\n And we figured this much: Jagger planned to open a dance club for mortals and vampires in Dullsville, and Sebastian was going to be his partner.\n \"Do youthink Sebastianknows about the Covenant?\"\n Alexander shook his head. \"He wouldn\u0027t be game for that.\"\n \"Evenunder their seducing powers?\" Iasked.\n \"Well, maybe . . .\"\n \"What do we do now?\" Iasked.\n \"Iguess we have to stop them from making a CoffinClub here intown.\"\n \"Do we reallyhave to?\" Iasked.\n \"Are youkidding? Whythe suddenchange of heart? Weren\u0027t youthe one trying to convince me that this could be dangerous?\"\n I sat up. \"Ilove the CoffinClub.\"\n \"But it is full of underground vampires.\"\n \"What if this one wasn\u0027t? What if it was just full of the vampires we know?\" Isuggested. \"Jagger could still have a club and you and Sebastian would have a place to drink your Romanian smoothies.\"\n \"The vampires we know? You saw how my best friend acted. How are they going to be partying with a bunch of mortals?\"\n I wasn\u0027t sure. I only knew Iw anted the Crypt--a place I could dance in.\n Closing the Crypt before it even opened meant I\u0027d never even be able to experience the club at all. How ever, I didn\u0027t want the students of Dullsville to be in harm\u0027s way for my needs. There had to be a way to compromise.\n \"Maybe we canconvince him to openthe club just to mortals,\" I suggested.\n Alexander thought. \"Ithink it\u0027s a great idea. But Idon\u0027t think he\u0027ll go for that. He wants the Crypt to be like the Coffin Club. To be the king of bothworlds.\"\n \"Listen, Trevor\u0027s great at soccer. Youare great at painting.And Jagger? He\u0027s great at making clubs. He can do it.\"\n \"Yes, I know. But does he want to?\"\n \"He\u0027s so misguided. He wants to be loved like youand Trevor. He reallydoes. He just doesn\u0027t see it because he was too busy trying to get revenge. But now that he\u0027s not? He could just be a success and popular owning and running this club for mortals.\"\n \"Again, Ithink that\u0027s a good idea--but youare talking about Jagger here.\"\n \"Alexander, I want this club. The CoffinClub is too far awayfor me to go to. Myparents have the countryclub. Billy has Math Club. I don\u0027t have anything.\"\n \"What about me? The Mansion?\"\n \"I love hanging out withyouat the Mansion! Don\u0027t misunderstand me. But I\u0027m prettyclose to having mykind of club.\n A place for me to go to and have fun. I\u0027ve never had a place like that anywhere.\"\n \"Well, youlike Hatsy\u0027s Diner,\" he encouraged playfully.\n \"I do, if Iwant a burger. But I want to dance. I want to move and be in the darkness.\"\n Alexander had traveled to cities and clubs around the world.Althoughhe was a vampire, he\u0027d been able to go to fun places that didn\u0027t see the light of day. I\u0027d spent my life miserable in places where I didn\u0027t belong.\n \"But if we can convince Jagger to keep the vampires out and just let mortals in,\" I began, \"then it can be a club like anyother.And there isn\u0027t a club anywhere near here for teens to party. I\u0027m sure he\u0027d get a crowd. It would be a win-winsituationfor him.\"\n Alexander wasn\u0027t convinced.\n \"We\u0027ll have to persuade him that it\u0027s in his best interest to keep the club,\" I pressed.\n \"Are yougoing to tell him?\" he asked with a coygrin.\n \"He\u0027s not going to listento me,\" I said. \"But he\u0027ll listento you. He\u0027d have to.\"\n \"Would he?\"Alexander wondered. \"Jagger and I have a truce. But further than that? I\u0027m not sure that I could convince him to open his club anyway but the way he wants to.\"\n I sighed. \"But I fantasize about the Coffin Club. It was a wesome--the music of the Skeletons blasting against the walls. Those freakymannequins hanging from the ceiling. The coffinlid doors.And the secret dungeon.\"\n \"And Phoenix. . .\"Alexander laughed.\n \"Yes, Phoenix,\" Isaid, recallingAlexander\u0027s purple-haired alter ego who convinced Jagger to keep the Dungeona secret. \"Iwas crazyabout him as well. Not like you, Imean. But like you.\"\n Then it hit me.\n \"What if he came back?\" Iwondered aloud. \"What if Phoenixmade sure that the club remained onlymortal? Except for you, Sebastian, and the others, of course. But the Covenant would remainclosed.\"\n Alexander thought for a moment.\n I was sure this was a great idea. \"Phoenix was able to keep peace whenJagger was trying to make the Coffin Club nefarious and bring inmore vampires,\" Isaid. \"Phoenixstood up against Jagger, withthe club members by his side, and forced him to keep the clubsters happy by keeping it a secret and civil club. He can do the same here by keeping it mortal.\"\n \"I\u0027m not so sure . . .\"\n \"And if Jagger doesn\u0027t want to listen, Phoenixcould threatento go back to the CoffinClub. He could shut down that club--Jagger\u0027s flagship location. Jagger wouldn\u0027t let anything jeopardize the CoffinClub again. Phoenixis ultimatelythe onlyone withreal power over Jagger.\"\n Alexander fiddled with a dandelion in the grass.\n \"I\u0027d love to see him again,\" Isaid, taking another approach. \"That sexypurple hair. That hot rod motorcycle. Those tight black pants.And now that Iknow it\u0027s you,\" Isaid, sidling up toAlexander, \"Imight evenbe able to give him that kiss he was looking for.\"\n \"Hey, don\u0027t be cheating onme withme,\" he teased.\n \"Oh, it would be so cool. The Crypt. Dancing together and hanging out withScarlet and Onyx. Dullsville has come alive since I met you.\"\n I rested myhead on his shoulder as I fantasized about the Crypt;Alexander was lost inthought, too. I\u0027d put a lot of ideas in his head. I decided to change the subject.\n \"Our birthdays are just around the corner,\" I said. \"Becky wants to know what we\u0027re going to do.\"\n \"We should celebrate them together,\" he offered.\n \"That\u0027s what Isaid!\"\n \"We could throw a joint party,\" he suggested.\n \"Really? That would be the best birthdayever!\"\n \"And Ithink Iknow just the place,\"Alexander said. \"It\u0027s called the Crypt.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-5.html","bookId":2146,"book":{"id":2146,"title":"Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8) \n The morbidly monotonous Dullsville has finally become the most exciting place on earth now that Raven is madly in love with her hot vampire boyfriend Alexander, and a crew of vampires has taken residence in Dullsville\u0027s old mill.
