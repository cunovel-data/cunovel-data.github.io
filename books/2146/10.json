{"id":96240,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"I arrived at the mill just after sunset. Jagger was right - there wasn\u0027t much to do to make the abandoned mill a place to have a rave. Just clear boxes and add some lighting. But Jagger had bigger dreams for his parties. He wanted the patrons to be comfortable and have a unique experience.\n The transformation was shocking. A bar was placed in the middle of the northern-most wall. Several round tables, wooden chairs, and bar stools were covered with black velvet. It was truly magical how much they were able to do under the cloak of darkness.\n I beamed with excitement as the abandoned factory was becoming the ultimate dance club. I found Sebastian and Luna overlapping limbs on a crate in the corner. It was obvious that with Luna around, Sebastian wasn\u0027t being the help to Jagger that Jagger was hoping for. \"Luna, maybe you and Raven could get us some food at that diner,\" Jagger said. \"Take my car,\" he said, throwing the keys to his sister.\n Luna and I each tried to hide our reluctance. For both of us, it meant time away from our loves. And worse, time together.\n Each vampire looked at us, seeing our reactions and waiting to see which one of us came up with an excuse first. \"Sure,\" Luna finally said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n It was a thrill to ride in Jagger\u0027s hearse. A plastic skeleton hung from the rearview mirror and the vintage car\u0027s interior was perfectly amazing, with restored black vinyl upholstered seats. The black curtains in back were drawn closed, and I wondered if indeed there might be a body in the hearse. The silver bat hood ornament glistened in the moonlight.\n Luna\u0027s candy-pink-nailed fingers gripped the black leather steering wheel and her hair cascaded over her shoulders as if she were on a photo shoot.\n \"So what are your plans?\" I asked, trying to pry any info out of her while I had the chance. \"Building the Crypt.\" \"And who do you think will show up?\" I asked. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m sure Jagger has it all figured out.\" \"You mean you don\u0027t know?\" \"Know what?\" \"Is it going to be like the Coffin Club, with an underground vampire hangout?\" Just then she pulled into the parking lot. She withdrew a list from her purse. \"You didn\u0027t answer - \"\n She got out of the car and surveyed the list like she was memorizing it for a quiz. She didn\u0027t even look up and continued to walk through the parking lot, ignoring impending traffic.\n \"Watch out, Luna,\" I said when a car came too close for my comfort. \"What?\" she said indifferently, reaching the curb and entering the restaurant.\n When we stepped into Hatsy\u0027s Diner, all heads turned. Moms and dads gave us the look of \"don\u0027t grow up to look like them, sweetie.\"\n And though the guys in town preferred their girls in paisley, it didn\u0027t stop them from gawking at the new girl in ripped tights and a skirt that barely covered her bottom.\n I was invisible as far as they were concerned. No one ever paid attention to me, but when Luna arrived at the counter, more than three waiters came over to help. She leaned over the counter and gave the soda jerk our order.\n He quickly passed it back to the cooks and raced around to the shake machine. Luna got bored and turned to me. \"So, what do you think of my new boyfriend?\" she said with sappy eyes. I didn\u0027t want to tell her the truth and risk being mean. I thought Sebastian was great - but not for her.\n \"He\u0027s so funny and handsome,\" she gushed. \"The best of both worlds.\" She twisted her hair between her fingers. \"He\u0027s going to take me to Paris and Rome. What about Alexander? Where is he taking you?\"\n Alexander hadn\u0027t taken me anywhere - and we didn\u0027t have plans to go anywhere. \"We talk about Rome and Paris, too,\" I said. \"But we are far too busy for any of that right now,\" I shot back. \"Oh yes, you are bogged down by school. I don\u0027t know how you manage.\" I don\u0027t, I wanted to say. \"I think I might want to stay here with Sebastian.\" \"He\u0027s staying here?\" \"For now. So I will, too.\" \"For how long?\" I asked. \"As long as it takes.\" \"As long as what takes?\" She wasn\u0027t about to answer. Luna had coyness down to a science. \"So, when do you think Alexander will turn you?\" she said directly. It was the one question that burned inside of me. I wasn\u0027t about to tell her that. She already knew.\n \"Do you know - his grandmother was never bitten. You could become just like her. In that monument in the cemetery.\"\n I was thrown by her statement. It was so harsh and brutal that I was taken off guard. I was mad for me - but even more mad for Alexander\u0027s grandmother.\n But then I thought about what it meant - if that was my fate, too. And if it was, it wasn\u0027t so bad. Many people live their entire lives never finding true love. Grandmother Sterling had loved and had a wonderful family. And I had found true love at sixteen.\n \"It\u0027s a shame,\" Luna continued, \"his grandfather died before they could make that decision.\" \"But if he was a vampire . . .\" I asked, surprised, \"then how could he die?\"\n \"There was a revolt. Decades ago. Vampires can die, too, you know. It\u0027s hard, but they can. And it\u0027s not a pleasant way to go.\"\n This was information I hadn\u0027t heard from Alexander. There were rumors of a revolt in Romania and how that was the reason the baroness had built the Mansion on Benson Hill. But I thought it was just a rumor.\n \"She came here to protect her family,\" Luna went on. \"Was it your family that started the revolt?\" I asked cautiously.\n \"No . . .\" She laughed with a cute cackle. \"It was mortals. They are far more destructive than vampires. I thought you would have figured that out by now.\"\n She drew a long sip from her strawberry-pink shake. \"But is that what you really want? To spend your life waiting? It seems so pathetic.\" Her sharp words pierced me more painfully than fangs. \"Well, I\u0027ll be sure to invite you to our wedding,\" she continued. \"Wedding?\" I asked. \"Yes, when Sebastian and I get married.\" \"You are getting married? But you just met. And you\u0027re not even . . .\"\n \"I\u0027m eighteen. Romeo and Juliet betrothed their love at sixteen. And no, we aren\u0027t getting married today. But eventually. I\u0027m sure Alexander is kicking himself, seeing all he could have had that his best friend has now. A partnership in a club. And a girl who isn\u0027t afraid to be bitten.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. I\u0027m not afraid.\" \"Aren\u0027t you? It seems like you are waiting an eternity - for eternity.\" \"You don\u0027t know anything about it,\" I said through gritted teeth. \"So if you both are so serious and so in love, then when is your official date?\"\n She knew what Alexander was like. She knew he wasn\u0027t going to turn me anytime soon, and she was shoving it in my face.\n \"We don\u0027t need that to show how much we care for each other.\"\n Page Break \"Those are just excuses. Commitment. That\u0027s what it\u0027s all about. Taking that covenant together. Bonding yourselves together for eternity. Isn\u0027t that what we are all looking for? Maybe Alexander wasn\u0027t ready to do that with me, but it\u0027s obvious he isn\u0027t ready to do that with you, either.\"\n Now I was boiling mad. I felt like dumping my shake on her head right in front of the whole town. Anger welled up in my boots all the way through my torn tights and raged up my spine.\n \"Eternity is forever, but marriage? That\u0027s even longer,\" she said with that cute girlie giggle. \"What if I told you that Alexander planned to turn me? On my twenty-first birthday. In the cemetery, in front of the whole town!\"\n \"Then I\u0027d tell you I think you\u0027re making it up.\" I fumed inside. \"Besides, we can ask Alexander all about that turning at twenty-one when we get back.\"\n I was horrified at the thought of returning to the factory and Luna asking Alexander about something we hadn\u0027t really discussed and I had just now made up.\n \"And I\u0027ll ask Sebastian about your wedding, too,\" I shot back. Luna froze, frostier than her pink shake. It was then I knew I\u0027d caught her, too. \"Well, for now, we\u0027ll just consider our discussion a secret between friends.\"\n The waiter placed two large bags of food and a carton filled with shakes on the counter. Luna grabbed a handful of napkins and her shake and headed out the door and left me to struggle with the rest. When we arrived back at the mill, I bolted out the car door, leaving Luna to carry the load. Only it backfired. No one was glad to see me. The vampires were hungry and she got the credit for the bounty. Each ravenous vampire took his or her meal and tore into the food while I picked at mine, having eaten three times that day already.\n It was very obvious that Sebastian was head-overï¿½CDoc Martens for Luna. He doted on her so much it made my stomach turn. I knew he was mesmerized by her, as she did have a hypnotic glow around her. However, if Alexander wasn\u0027t interested in her, then I wondered why I was so jealous of her.\n Scarlet also seemed preoccupied. I sensed a loneliness emanating from her. We all were coupled up. There were obviously three couples here - Luna and Sebastian, Alexander and me, Jagger and Onyx - and each couple was in a stage of romance, whether one had been bitten or not. And there was one single vampire girl. Scarlet, however, longed for a mortal just as I did for a vampire. She was pining for Trevor, a conservative mortal who was a player on and off the field. I knew Trevor wasn\u0027t good for her, for so many reasons. And at the end of the day, if he was going to be with his antithesis girl, someone goth, it probably would have been me.\n The advantage I had was the sunlight. Something Scarlet, oddly enough, longed for, and I detested.\n Instead of giving me a good-night kiss at my front door, Alexander came inside. I think we both needed some private time together since all our nights were being consumed with the Crypt and being on the watch for the possible Covenant. Alexander didn\u0027t hang out in my bedroom a lot. I preferred the Mansion, with its magnificent space and style, and it was also minus two doting parents and one pesky little brother.\n But having Alexander in my room felt amazing. My little space didn\u0027t seem so morbid after all. Alexander brought life to it. And having him there was exhilarating. The way he walked around, examining and touching everything on display, was like he was touching me. I watched him look closely at my knickknacks, books, and music as if he was trying to get to know me or see into my soul. I felt safe with him here. Nothing could bother me - not physically or emotionally. And as tough as I was, it was nice for a moment to let my guard down and feel safe because of someone else for a change.\n Alexander sat on my bed, like a gentleman would, if it were acceptable for a gentleman to sit on a lady\u0027s bed. But I pulled him over and made him lie beside me. I imagined what it would be like if he could cuddle with me as I fell asleep here, just as I did with him in his coffin. But that wasn\u0027t going to happen anytime soon, especially when we\u0027d often get interrupted by Billy Boy, looking for attention.\n \"Wow - I don\u0027t know how you sleep like this. I worry about you all the time,\" he said tenderly. \"What do you mean?\" \"Open - exposed. Anyone - or anything - could come into your room. You aren\u0027t hidden from danger.\" \"What would come into my room?\"\n \"I don\u0027t even want to think about it. I\u0027m miles away from you and . . . it\u0027s just not safe. Not from the sun, I mean. But from people. There are so many things that can happen if you\u0027re not secured.\" \"We have a security system.\" I caressed his hair playfully, but Alexander was serious. \"I know. But don\u0027t you feel strange looking up and knowing anyone could watch you sleeping? Especially since you can\u0027t see in the dark.\"\n I thought about it for a moment. I\u0027d contemplated many things from the vampire\u0027s viewpoint, but this was something I hadn\u0027t.\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to scare you. It\u0027s one of the reasons I want to . . .\" \"Yes?\" \"It is one of the reasons I\u0027d want you to be a vampire.\" I sat up. \"Really?\" \"It just seemed odd to me that mortals would prefer to sleep that way.\" \"That\u0027s not what I meant.\" I leaned into him eagerly. \"I just feel funny - you here, not totally secured. But I guess it works for your kind. It always has.\" \"Yes, but back to what you were saying.\" I hoped he\u0027d go back to talking about me becoming a vampire. \"I want you to be safe, that\u0027s all,\" he said, squeezing my hand.\n From Alexander\u0027s perspective, we mortals lived open, vulnerable lives. He was hidden away from the sun and predators. Even if someone were to find the coffin, he was locked inside.\n \"It\u0027s weird. You can see all these things and hear all these noises. No wonder you have insomnia.\" \"I have insomnia because you aren\u0027t here with me. So . . . if you really want me to be safe, maybe it\u0027s time.\" \"I\u0027d just feel safer if you\u0027d start sleeping in a coffin.\" Just then my door creaked open. Billy\u0027s expression turned to surprise. \"Get out!\" I said, hopping off the bed. \"Uh . . . we are making up lyrics to a song.\" But that didn\u0027t keep Billy out. Instead he was totally interested. \"You\u0027re writing a song? That\u0027s so cool. I want to hear it.\" \"It goes, \u0027Safer in a coffin, and if your brother doesn\u0027t leave, he\u0027ll be in one, too.\u0027\" Billy just frowned. \"It\u0027s okay, man,\" Alexander said. \"What\u0027s up?\" \"What are you doing in my room?\" I snarled at Billy. \"I\u0027m one step away from bringing back Nerd Boy.\"\n My brother wasn\u0027t bothered by my threat. He was under the Alexander spell. Like a kid in the company of a professional athlete, Billy was enamored byAlexander\u0027s presence. Alexander was the big brother Billy never had. And in kind, Alexander was always attentive to my brother, as kind and focused on him as he could be.\n \"Isn\u0027t it past your bedtime?\" I finally asked. I could see Alexander had a longing for my younger sibling, as if he was missing one himself. He seemed delighted by the attention.\n I let the two talk for a few more minutes before I led, or rather pushed, my little brother out of my room. Alexander and I had enough distractions to deal with and I wanted my precious alone time with him. I thought now would be a good time to bring up what I\u0027d learned from my conversation with Luna at Hatsy\u0027s Diner. I sat on the bed withAlexander and entwined my fingers with his. \"Sebastian really likes Luna,\" I said.\n \"Yes, I can see that.\" \"No. I mean they\u0027ve talked future and everything.\" \"Yeah . . . ?\" \"I think they are going to get married.\" Alexander laughed. \"Sebastian? I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Luna seems to think so. And the way he drools all over her, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised. . . .\" \"You don\u0027t know Sebastian that well then.\" Alexander continued to laugh. \"Well, maybe he found the right one,\" I said. \"For today.\" \"I think this is different,\" I tried to tell him. \"How?\" \"Because he bit her.\" I looked him straight in the eyes. But Alexander wasn\u0027t impressed. \"But didn\u0027t he say the same thing about Becky? That she was different?\" Alexander asked. \"I guess . . .\"\n \"Do you know how many times I\u0027ve heard him say that?\" Alexander said with a grin. \"That\u0027s what vampires do, they bite.\"\n \"But you don\u0027t.\" \"Not yet . . .\" He lifted my hair from my neck and nibbled it, sending me into giggles.\n Then he took my hand. \"Sebastian\u0027s only heard me say I was in love once. About a girl I met when I came to this town.\"\n My heart melted. Alexander was truly dreamy. His soulful eyes stared into mine and I kissed him with all my love. When we finished our embrace, I thought again about our conversation. \"But with Luna - Sebastian seems to be sure this time,\" I said. \"And he\u0027s acting on it - though impulsively,\" I lamented. \"Raven, I don\u0027t live my life based on what everyone else is doing. I never have. And I thought you didn\u0027t either. That\u0027s one of the reasons I\u0027m so attracted to you.\"\n He was right. Why did I have to live my life differently - or expect things for Alexander and me because of anyone else? I\u0027d been living according to my rules since I was born. And now, because Luna came to town, I was going to adjust my whole existence to keep up with hers? And worse, I was trying to do the same for Alexander.\n But I couldn\u0027t get past her. She struck me to the core. It wasn\u0027t rational but emotional. \"It\u0027s normal to be jealous sometimes,\" Alexander said. \"But what are you jealous of, really? A guy who meets a girl and, without a thought, bites her at a party? What if Sebastian goes to another party? How will she feel then?\"\n I guess I was jealous that Luna was a vampire and I was still a mortal. That she was bitten and I wasn\u0027t. And that she thought she was getting married . . . and I still wasn\u0027t sure. But was I brave enough to say all those things to Alexander? To confront him out of fear and not out of love? And because of one impulsive person and another shifty one, to make him prove things to me he might not be ready to prove?\n Alexander pulled me to him and took my face into his hands. \"I hope that biting you isn\u0027t the only way I can convince you of my love for you. It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t want to. And it\u0027s not that I don\u0027t think about it every day. I\u0027ve loved you from the first moment I saw you.\"\n He stared so deeply into my eyes that I could see myself in them. For a moment, I was saddened, realizing he couldn\u0027t see his own reflection in mine. And if I was turned, I wouldn\u0027t be able to see myself in his anymore. But not seeing reflections didn\u0027t seem to bother him. He wasn\u0027t asking me to change. He loved me the way I was, and no guy had ever done that before.\n He drew my face to his and kissed me deeply, kissed the jealousy away, and I was flooded with a sense of love and an even deeper eternal desire. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-10.html","bookId":2146,"book":{"id":2146,"title":"Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8) \n The morbidly monotonous Dullsville has finally become the most exciting place on earth now that Raven is madly in love with her hot vampire boyfriend Alexander, and a crew of vampires has taken residence in Dullsville\u0027s old mill.
