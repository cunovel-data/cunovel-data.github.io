{"id":96249,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"So you think Trevor knows we\u0027re vampires?\" Alexander asked the next day when I met him at the Mansion. \"No, he thought it was just something weird you guys do. But Becky knows the truth.\" Alexander appeared worried. \"Well, someone was bound to find out, I guess. It\u0027s funny. I came here to escape the Maxwells and now I\u0027ve brought them to your town.\" \"You couldn\u0027t have known,\" I reassured him. \"So is the feud back on?\" \"It might be with Sebastian. But I think they were doing it to also get back at me.\" Just then we heard a knock from downstairs. \"Alexander, you have a visitor,\" Jameson called. We headed out of the attic room and met Sebastian outside the TV room. \"Thanks, Raven. I owe you one.\" He leaned in and gave me a hug. \"I knew you liked her, but . . . ,\" I tried. \"So how are you doing?\" Alexander asked. \"Pretty good,\" he said. \"What\u0027s going to happen to the Crypt?\" I asked. \"It will remain open,\" Sebastian said, \"but Jagger\u0027s losing a partner.\" \"Are you leaving town?\" I asked, not able to mask the sadness in my voice. \"For the first time there is nowhere else I want to go,\" he said. \"Do you want to crash here?\" Alexander asked. \"I don\u0027t want to mess with your setup,\" he said. \"Besides, I need way more electricity than this Mansion can provide. I\u0027ve found an apartment in town that\u0027s cool.\" \"You\u0027re staying?\" I asked excitedly. \"Yeah, for a little while.\" He looked at his shoes as if he was trying to find the words. \"I\u0027ve always thought that Onyx was really pretty. And I don\u0027t like the way Jagger doesn\u0027t pay attention to her. She needs to know what a real boyfriend is like.\" \"And you\u0027re just the man?\" I asked, thrilled. \"Who knows, I might be. Anyway, I just wanted to stop over and say thanks. I have to set up my new place. You guys can come over tonight if you want.\" \"That sounds great. I\u0027ll walk you out,\" Alexander offered. While I waited for him to return, I heard Alexander\u0027s phone beeping from the table. It beeped. And beeped. If I wasn\u0027t calling him and neither was Sebastian, it might be his parents. When I saw the caller ID, my heart sank. Stormy. Who was Stormy? After a few moments of emotional flatlining, my blood pressure soared. What do I do now? I couldn\u0027t be that girlfriend - the kind who snoops in drawers and closets and invades emails and texts. Or could I? When I saw the number\u0027s prefix, it was definitely foreign. Not from Dullsville or even the United States. I looked at the message. When are you coming back? I miss you like crazy! Luv, Stormy. Stormy! \"Luv?\" My thoughts raced. Alexander had another girlfriend? It was the last thing I was intending to find. The number was foreign, so this girl obviously didn\u0027t live in Dullsville or even in this country. I hadn\u0027t imagined Alexander could be involved with someone else. Who was this \"Stormy\"? Was she pretty? Was she a vampire? And was Alexander in love with her, too? I paced in my boyfriend\u0027s room. I gazed out the window. I tried to act calmly. \"That\u0027s cool that Sebastian will be staying in town,\" Alexander said when he reentered the room. \"Uh-huh,\" I said flatly. \"What\u0027s up?\" he asked. \"You seemed excited a few minutes ago.\" \"I am,\" I said indifferently. \"You seem weird. Distant. What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Uh . . . nothing.\" I\u0027d imagined Alexander to be someone that maybe he wasn\u0027t. A guy who was straight and truthful. Who didn\u0027t have girls in every country. He was so handsome and wildly hot, I was a fool to think that girls wouldn\u0027t be throwing themselves at him. I was wearing my broken heart on my black lace sleeve. \"Something\u0027s up,\" Alexander said. \"I know that face.\" \"I just thought we were only seeing each other,\" I said, my voice cracking. He was taken aback. \"I am. Aren\u0027t you?\" he asked, bewildered. \"I thought you weren\u0027t like other guys, like Trevor.\" My heart was aching. \"What are you talking about?\" Alexander asked. \"Who\u0027s Stormy?\" I asked. I handed him the phone. Alexander paused. \"You read my text?\" \"The phone kept beeping and so I thought it might be something urgent. Something from your mother.\" \"Raven - \" he said. \"Who\u0027s Stormy?\" I demanded. \"She\u0027s my sister!\" I was floored. \"What?\" I said. \"You have a sister?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"You have a sister?\" I repeated. \"Yes. I have a little sister. Is that so terrible?\" \"No! Well, yes, it is, because you never told me.\" \"You never asked,\" he said, half teasing. \"And she never came up. I left my life suddenly when I came here to the Mansion. I didn\u0027t know how long I\u0027d stay. I didn\u0027t plan on getting close to anyone here.\" \"But I\u0027ve never even seen a picture. Or painting.\" \"Do you have a picture of Billy Boy in your room?\" \"Uh . . . good point. But you\u0027ve never even talked about her.\" \"I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d be able to be close to anyone here - then I met you. And everything changed. But really, when we\u0027re together, I only want to talk about us.\" If I didn\u0027t hear it straight from his dreamy lips, I\u0027d have thought it was a line from a romantic movie. \"Honestly, talking about my family made me kind of miss them. So I never really did.\" His voice was so sincere, I felt lonely for my boyfriend\u0027s situation. Here I was surrounded by my family, seeing them every day and celebrating my birthday with them. And Alexander lived in this big old Mansion alone. I gave him a huge hug. First, I was sad for his plight, but second, I was so overjoyed that Alexander didn\u0027t have a secret lover. But he did have a secret sister. It was one of the reasons I loved him so much. He was so mysterious, and even after all these months I was still learning things about him. \"Do you have a dog, too?\" I asked. Alexander laughed. \"A few pet bats.\" \"Stormy\u0027s lucky,\" I said. \"She has the coolest big brother in the universe.\" Alexander beamed at the compliment. \"I can see why she misses you. I\u0027d hate it if I had a big brother and he left town for another country.\" \"She has full reign of the house. She\u0027s in heaven.\" \"I don\u0027t think so. Not with a brother like you. Stormy Sterling,\" I said. \"It has an awesome ring to it.\" \"Her real name is Athena, but we call her Stormy.\" \"\u0027A\u0027 - like Alexander.\" He nodded. \"I bet she\u0027s really cool.\" Then it hit me. \"She wants you to come home,\" I said. \"Yes,\" he said. \"So you\u0027ll have to go?\" I said, my heart breaking again. \"For a short visit? Or forever?\" \"It would just be a short visit.\" \"I can\u0027t take that,\" I said selfishly. \"We are already separated by the sunlight. Now by countries and weeks?\" \"That\u0027s why I convinced her to come here.\" \"So you won\u0027t have to go?\" \"No,\" he said, shaking his head. \"Then you\u0027ll still be here,\" I said, squeezing him with all my might. \"And I\u0027ll get to meet her, too?\" \"Don\u0027t be so excited. You\u0027ll have wished I had gone home to visit. We call her Stormy for a reason,\" he said. And with that, Alexander turned off his phone. Between creeps and Crypts, nemeses and best friends, pesky mortal families and visiting vampire parents and siblings, we were lucky enough to get any night time together. Alexander took this opportunity to lean in and flash his sexy fangs at me, and then led me into his closet room and opened his coffin and helped me inside. He lowered the lid, closing the door on all worlds, mortal and immortal. He drew my hair back and rested his body next to mine. He pulled me in and kissed me with the heart and soul of a gorgeous, mysterious, and very romantic vampire.
