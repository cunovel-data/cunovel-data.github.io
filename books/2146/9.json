{"id":96239,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"As soon as the torture of another dreadfully monotonous Dullsville High day was over, I raced to the Sinclair Mill. Nothing was going to stop me from helping Jagger and his cryptic clique from decorating the decadent dance club. When I made my way inside the decaying building I saw that Jagger had already marked the floor with glow tape where the stage, dance floor, and bar would be. While the vampires slept, I swept, removed empty cardboard boxes, and cleared away any debris that would get in the way of the quick renovations. By the time the sun set and the vampires awoke, I was exhausted. Alexander greeted me with a kiss and Javalicious coffee, and I sat on a box sipping it and watching as Onyx and Scarlet and the vampires worked. Scarlet drank her own piping hot latte. But instead of cocoa beans, hers was brewed with blood. I rested my weary head against Alexander\u0027s shoulder. In this environment, unlike any other in Dullsville, I was accepted as one of the \"in\" crowd - and I was in my element - hanging out with vampires and helping decorate a nocturnal dance club. I looked on as a truck backed into a loading dock and a few guys that looked more dead than alive loaded chairs, lighting equipment, and a pool table into the factory. Alexander kept a watchful eye on the incoming boxes, making sure that there were no nefarious items or clues about whether Jagger still planned on opening the Covenant. Sebastian did his best to help, but Luna clung to him, keeping his hands busy. He often got caught up in talking to Alexander and had to be nudged back to work by Jagger. As the evening wore on, it was clear that there was only one person who didn\u0027t contribute to the transformation: Luna. The wispy fairy girl draped herself on a chair like a princess and, when breaks were taken, canoodled with Sebastian or asked him to fetch her bloody lattes. Several times I caught her fingering Sebastian\u0027s dreadlocks but staring at Alexander. I felt she was up to something, but what, I wasn\u0027t sure. The following day at school, Becky and I were having lunch by the flagpole while waiting for Matt to join us. She was biting into a sandwich and I was picking at my organic peanut butter one. \"Have you heard any more about that club?\" Becky asked out of the blue. \"I hear rumblings all the time, but no one has any concrete information. I was wondering where it\u0027s going to be and when it\u0027s going to open.\" I had to tell Becky what I knew about the club - leaving out, of course, the vampire element. The rumors about the club echoed off the walls of Dullsville High, and it wasn\u0027t right to keep her in the dark any longer. \"You have to swear to secrecy.\" \"Of course. You know something?\" \"I know a lot.\" Becky put her sandwich aside. \"Tell me everything.\" \"It\u0027s Jagger - he\u0027s going to open a club here. And it\u0027s going to be in the vacant Sinclair Mill.\" \"Wow - that sounds cool.\" \"But you can\u0027t tell anyone because Alexander and I have to find out a bit more about it.\" \"Like what?\" \"Like who he\u0027s opening it to.\" \"I thought I heard it was for everyone.\" \"Yes. But I want to confirm it first. And I have bigger news,\" I said, bursting to tell her more. \"What\u0027s bigger than that?\" \"He told me I can help him!\" \"That is awesome!\" \"I went there yesterday and helped clean up.\" \"I\u0027d love to help, too,\" Becky said. I hadn\u0027t anticipated her reaction and willingness to be involved. I couldn\u0027t imagine Becky being on the inside of the factory, setting up the club with the vampires. It was one thing for me to be there - it was another for her. \"I\u0027m not sure you\u0027d enjoy it. It\u0027s really messy work.\" \"And working on a farm isn\u0027t?\" She had a point. \"It\u0027s just that - \" \"I usually have all my homework done by the end of the day,\" she said. \"So I could use the time after school to help you guys.\" \"Well, they really don\u0027t start working until the evening. And they go all night, since they don\u0027t have school.\" \"I can help then, too. Matt is so busy with his scrimmages. It would be good for me to have something to do besides always waiting on the sidelines.\" Becky flashed her soft baby face and sweet pleading eyes. \"Fine,\" I said. \"But this is our secret. I\u0027m going over there tonight withAlexander. We\u0027ll pick you up on the way.\" Just then Matt bolted out of the main entrance and headed over to us. \"My lips are sealed,\" Becky said with a wink. Becky dug her powder blue nails into my arm as I led her down the dark gravel road toward the factory. \"This mill is so creepy,\" she said. Her teeth were chattering, not from the cold but from fear. \"I can\u0027t imagine anyone would want to come here willingly. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not meeting you here.\" \"I\u0027d never do that to you,\" I said. \"Why don\u0027t they have lights inside?\" she asked, looking at the darkened building as we walked to the door of the factory. \"I only see flickering candles.\" \"I guess the electricity doesn\u0027t work yet.\" To me this was like a dream place; to my best friend it was a nightmare. She cowered, several times covering her hair as if at any moment a swarm of bats would fly over her head. She might have been right. Alexander opened the unwieldy door. \"Are you sure this is safe?\" Becky asked before stepping inside. \"I wouldn\u0027t bring you here if it wasn\u0027t.\" I took her hand. \"I won\u0027t let anything happen to you,\" I said. She seemed a bit relieved, but only slightly, when we entered the factory and it was illuminated with votives and candelabras. \"I\u0027m trying to be brave,\" she said as she maneuvered around an empty crate. Her foot hit something as we walked. \"Yikes!\" she said with a gasp. \"What\u0027s that? I\u0027m afraid to look. Is it a dead body?\" \"It\u0027s just an empty crate,\" I assured her. She wasn\u0027t about to let go of my hand. I was touched that she was battling her fears to share in my new hangout. There was an awkward pause when we entered the main room and I saw Jagger seated on a bar stool. When he spotted us, he immediately rose. He was surprised, and, by his frown, I could see he was not too happy that I\u0027d brought a visitor. \"She\u0027s with us,\" I said. \"She\u0027s not going to spoil your secret.\" There was an even more awkward pause when Sebastian spotted Becky. It was obvious he still had a pang for her - and more so since he\u0027d tasted her blood. Becky appeared delighted to see Sebastian, and the two locked eyes. Luna swooped in from the shadows, sensing their romantic tension, and grabbed Sebastian around his waist as if he were a prize she\u0027d won at a state fair. \"Sebastian and I were just thinking of ways to promote the club,\" Luna proclaimed. \"We thought about T-shirts. I was thinking mine could say WELCOME TO THE CRYPT and on the back SEBASTIAN\u0027S GHOUL.\" \"That sounds awesome,\" I said. \"We brought Raven\u0027s best friend, Becky,\" Alexander said. \"She wanted to help out.\" Alexander\u0027s words were like a knight\u0027s to his round table. His permission for Becky to be there wasn\u0027t going to be challenged by anyone. Not even Jagger. Sebastian squirmed in Luna\u0027s clutches. It was apparent he was trying to finagle his position so he could talk to Becky. But Luna wasn\u0027t going to let my best friend intercept her new boyfriend\u0027s attention. Luna grabbed his hand. \"Jagger needs these crates returned to the dock. And while we are there, there\u0027s something I want to show you.\" She flipped back her hair from her neck, exposing a tiny bite mark. She giggled and flashed her glistening lashes. Becky wasn\u0027t suspicious. In the dim light of the mill, the marks were not clearly visible and could have been just a scratch. But I knew their true origin. \"Yes, Sebastian and I have big plans for the club, and for us. Right, Sabby?\" Luna said. \"Sabby?\" I mouthed to Alexander. \"We are going to be together for a while,\" she said, then whispered so only I could hear, \"maybe even eternity.\" I wasn\u0027t sure why she was trying to shove her relationship with Sebastian in front of me and Alexander. Perhaps she was still hurt byAlexander\u0027s spurning her at the covenant ceremony in Romania. Perhaps she was still in love with him and wanted to show him what he was missing. Or maybe she wanted to make me feel bad because I didn\u0027t have what she did - a guy who bit her. Most likely, it was all of the above. \"Uh - \" Sebastian said as he attempted to make conversation with us, but Luna\u0027s charms were no match for him, and he was reluctantly led away by the tempting vampire. I proudly showed Becky around the room and described the plans to her. Alexander watched as the two of us made our way to each corner. I could feel his gaze on me, and I sensed an ease on his part that I was truly happy with this cryptic endeavor. \"Here\u0027s where the dance floor is going to be,\" I said. \"And here there are going to be cages.\" \"How cool!\" Becky said. \"I can\u0027t imagine dancing in a cage, but I\u0027ve seen it on TV.\" She took out her cell phone from her purse. \"Strike a pose,\" she said, holding up her phone as a camera. I laughed and raised my arms like I owned the club myself. We had to get out of the way as a few workers came through with large wooden panels. She snapped a few photos of them and they appeared shocked, as if no one had taken their picture before. Becky continued taking pictures of Jagger\u0027s workers as they placed cardboard tombstones against a wall. \"You shouldn\u0027t do that - \" I said to her as they winced from the flash of light. \"What\u0027s that?\" Jagger asked, storming in the room. When he saw Becky taking pictures, he snapped. \"You can\u0027t do that! Not here!\" Becky\u0027s cheery face turned sour. She was taken off guard, and I could tell she felt awful. \"She didn\u0027t mean anything by it,\" I said, facing Jagger. Sebastian must have heard Jagger\u0027s harsh tone, as he and Luna came running into the room. \"Becky was taking pictures of the workers!\" Jagger said. \"This is why - \" \"She didn\u0027t do anything wrong.\" I defended her. \"I asked her to take those.\" I could see Becky\u0027s cheeks getting redder. I\u0027d brought her here, and within five minutes she was being insulted. \"What\u0027s the big deal?\" she asked softly. \"I don\u0027t allow cameras in the club,\" Jagger said. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t know. I was just going to take some action shots,\" Becky said innocently. \"Before and after pictures.\" \"I think that\u0027s a great idea,\" Sebastian said. Luna huffed. \"You do?\" She folded her arms defiantly, clearly miffed. \"Jagger is so secretive about this place because he has a lot invested in it, and he\u0027s afraid of people hearing about it before it\u0027s finished,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not going to show the pictures to anyone,\" Becky whimpered. \"I know,\" I said. \"Jagger just overreacted.\" Jagger sidled up to Becky. I was ready to pounce if he did anything nefarious to my best friend. By the look of it so were Alexander and Sebastian. They were suddenly at my best friend\u0027s side. Jagger wasn\u0027t about to take us on and instead changed his tune. \"How about you take a few of Raven by the tombstones?\" he suggested. \"I\u0027d love to have some of them. And I think your idea about before and after shots is really creative.\" We were impressed with Jagger\u0027s handling of the situation. Luna wasn\u0027t as much. She didn\u0027t like Sebastian\u0027s sudden defense of Becky and was obviously threatened. \"I don\u0027t have to, really,\" Becky said. She began putting her phone in her pocket when Jagger stopped her. \"No, I think it\u0027s a great idea. I wish I\u0027d thought of it myself. Besides, Raven loves to be photographed,\" Jagger said. \"The others? Not so much. We aren\u0027t as photogenic.\" \"Thanks, Jagger,\" I said. \"Yes, thanks!\" Becky said. \"I can be the official photographer of the Crypt.\" \"Awesome!\" Jagger said. \"You\u0027ll have to send me the shots.\" \"I\u0027ll make you a scrapbook.\" Jagger seemed genuinely pleased with Becky\u0027s enthusiasm and naivete. Becky was so excited about her new role at the Crypt. She began staging and snapping pictures of me as furniture and fixtures were being loaded into the mill. Sebastian, Luna, Alexander, and Jagger remained aloof so as not to be a part of any of the photos. I\u0027d never been so happy - save for being on the other end of Alexander\u0027s lips or cuddling together in his coffin. Here I was with my best friend and true love, surrounded by modern-day vampires and creating a haunting dance club. Even Onyx and Scarlet were taking to my best friend. \"Here,\" Onyx said, extending her hand. \"I\u0027ll take some of you and Raven together.\" Becky and I posed by the tombstones while Onyx snapped pictures of us. As Onyx returned the phone to Becky, Scarlet was at the bar, pouring blood-red liquid into a cup. \"What\u0027s that?\" Becky asked. \"Uh . . . Kool-Aid,\" Scarlet replied. \"I love Kool-Aid.\" \"I wish I had more,\" she said. \"But we do. In back,\" Onyx said without thinking. Scarlet shot her an evil glare. Then Onyx realized her misstep and bit her burgundy-colored lip. \"That\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll pick up something on the way home.\" The last thing I needed was Becky putting a cup of blood to her mouth and taking a swig. She\u0027d never recover. And neither would I. Becky stood out like a daisy in a sea of dead roses in her cheery colors, while we were dark in our morbid outfits. \"So where are you guys staying?\" Becky asked. \"Here,\" Scarlet said as if Becky already knew. \"In this place?\" Becky was as shocked as she was horrified. \"Uh-huh.\" Scarlet grinned. \"There\u0027s barely any electricity. And there\u0027s no furniture.\" \"We know,\" Scarlet said. \"Why don\u0027t you stay with one of the families in town? Or at least a hotel?\" \"It\u0027s free here, and besides, we like it,\" Onyx said. \"This place isn\u0027t acceptable for you guys to sleep in. We have some extra room at our house,\" Becky said. \"I can check with my parents, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027re more than welcome to stay - \" \"That is so sweet of you,\" Scarlet said sincerely. \"I hate to think of you sleeping here with the bugs and spiders,\" she said, shuddering. \"We like it that way,\" Scarlet insisted. \"I think they\u0027re lucky,\" I chimed in with a smile. \"Of course you would.\" Becky laughed. \"It\u0027s like Camp Raven. You guys are so brave,\" Becky went on. \"Where do you sleep?\" \"Downstairs.\" \"Ooh . . .,\" Becky said. \"You must be scared to death - at night.\" \"Actually it\u0027s during the day we are creeped out,\" Scarlet said. The two vampires giggled. \"I can show you,\" Onyx said. Scarlet cleared her throat. I imagined Onyx opening the door revealing five coffin beds. If Becky didn\u0027t faint, I would. Onyx was a gothic version of Becky. She was as sincere as she was kind. At the end of the day, though she was a vampire, she didn\u0027t have bite. Just then Alexander came and got us. \"Jagger could use some help painting the entrance.\" \"Now, that\u0027s something I can do,\" Becky said eagerly. \"Sleep in a factory\u0027s basement, no, but paint a factory wall, yes.\" The following day Becky was a little preoccupied. I didn\u0027t get to the bottom of it until after school when I tried to make plans with her to go back to the factory. \"I need to do some homework,\" she said as we headed for her truck. \"I can drop you off at home.\" \"I thought you\u0027d already finished it.\" \"I did . . . but I think I should probably look it over again. Just to make sure.\" Becky was an amateur at lying and a novice at fibbing. Her excuses were transparent. \"You don\u0027t want to go?\" I fished. \"Do I have to? I know I said I wanted to help, and I do. But do I have to go back into that place before it\u0027s finished?\" \"Of course not . . . I just thought - \" \"I can shop for you guys. I can hand out flyers. And when it\u0027s finished, I\u0027d love to go. But now? Without proper lighting and cleaning . . .\" \"Don\u0027t worry.\" \"I didn\u0027t sleep at all last night. I kept thinking about how dark and spooky it was there - so much so that I started seeing shadows in my room. And Scarlet, Onyx, and Luna - I don\u0027t think it\u0027s safe that they sleep there.\" \"Relax,\" I said. \"Why don\u0027t you stay home and work on the scrapbook then.\" Becky sighed like a yoga instructor. The sullen expression she\u0027d worn all day drew back, a cheery smile overcame her, and her cheeks blossomed apple red. I, too, felt elated, until Trevor jumped between me and the truck. \"Where are you going in such a hurry?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t remember it being any of your business.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t be snooping, would you? To find out where that club is going to be located?\" \"Maybe I already know. Besides, how would you know?\" \"Things like permits to vacant buildings need to be cleared first. And those things don\u0027t come to just anyone. My dad owns this town and everything in it.\" He guided my hair off my shoulder and I batted him away. \"Not everything!\" I said. \"He doesn\u0027t own me.\" \"Not yet,\" he said with a grin. \"But I can ensure you full access to the club - and to something else.\" \"You?\" I laughed out loud. \"No, something that you really want.\" He held up a key and dangled it in front of my face. Then he slid the key in his back pocket. \"Want to get it?\" \"Not in this lifetime!\" I opened the truck door and hopped inside. The front door to the factory was an unwieldy door that couldn\u0027t hold a lock even if there was one on it. Besides, it would be just as easy to pull the frail door off its hinges. If Trevor had a key to a door inside the Crypt, what did it lead to? Trevor watched me as Becky drove off. He was gorgeous and menacing, and was one step ahead of me. It only made him more annoying.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cryptic-cravings-vampire-kisses-8/page-9.html","bookId":2146,"book":{"id":2146,"title":"Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8)","description":"Storyline: Cryptic Cravings (Vampire Kisses #8) The morbidly monotonous Dullsville has finally become the most exciting place on earth now that Raven is madly in love with her hot vampire boyfriend Alexander, and a crew of vampires has taken residence in Dullsville\u0027s old mill.
