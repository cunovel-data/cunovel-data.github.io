Payton doesn\u0027t and this is her story. \n Nick Hawke likes his car fast and his girls even faster.

Determined to avoid the devastation he has watched his father endure in the aftermath of his mother leaving, he believes there is no room in his life or his heart for a relationship lasting more than one night. He seeks happiness in things that won’t let him down...fast cars, adrenaline and one night stands. To his absolute dismay, all of that changes when he unexpectedly runs into an old friend and is introduced to Payton Archer, the first girl he ever wanted for more than one night. There’s only one catch...she is completely immune to him and his smooth talking ways.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shallow-going-under-2.jpg","author":"Georgia Cates","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":41,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
