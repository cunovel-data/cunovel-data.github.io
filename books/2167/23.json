{"id":98181,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\"\u0027The snows will be soon in coming this year,\" Lady Dasslerond remarked, staring out of her high tree house at the gray clouds that loomed on the horizon just north of the enchanted valley.\n \"A difficult winter would be consistent,\" Tuntun replied, her expression even more grave than usual.\n Lady Dasslerond turned back to the pair and considered the words. The raid on Dundalis, the sightings of goblins and even giants, the evidence of many, earthquakes to the north of Andur\u0027Blough Inninness -- all pointed to the resurgence of the dactyl. There were even reports of a smoke cloud rising lazily over the Barbacan, streaming from a solitary mountain known as Aida.\n It made sense; the dactyl could -- and indeed, likely would awaken a long -- dormant volcano, using the magma to strengthen its underworld magic.\n \"How long is he?\" Lady Dasslerond asked as her gaze returned to the west and north.\n \"He has just passed his sixth year with us,\" Juraviel answered without hesitation. \"He was rescued from the goblins in the harvest season of the year the humans call 816. Their reckoning shows the turn of 823 approaching.\"\n Lady Dasslerond turned to Juraviel, her expression showing that his answer was not acceptable. \"But how long is he?\" she asked again.\n Juraviel sighed and rested back against the wide trunk of the maple. Measuring such things was never easy for the elf, especially since he feared he viewed Elbryan with favorable eyes.\n \"He is ready,\" Tuntun unexpectedly put in. \"The blood of Mather runs thick in his veins. In a half century, we will be telling our next would-be ranger that he is of the blood of Elbryan.\" Juraviel couldn\u0027t suppress a small laugh, even given the gravity of this meeting. To hear Tuntun speaking so well of Elbryan seemed to him the ultimate irony. \"Tuntun speaks the truth,\" he confirmed as soon as the shock wore off. \"Elbryan has trained hard and well. He fights with grace and power, runs silent and wary, and has visited the Oracle many times, almost always with success.\"\n \"He found a kindred spirit?\" asked Lady Dasslerond.\n \"Only that of Mather,\" Juraviel replied, beaming as the smile widened across his lady\u0027s fair face.\n \"But he is not yet ready,\" Juraviel added quickly. \"There is more for him to learn of himself and of the woodland arts. He has a year remaining, and then, he will indeed walk as a ranger.\"\n Lady Dasslerond was shaking her head before the elf even finished his proclamation. \"The winter will be difficult,\" she said firmly. \"And the humans have settled several communities along the edge of the Wilderlands, have even resettled that place which was, and is again, known as Dundalis. If what we fear is true, then Elbryan will be needed, before the next season of harvest.\"\n \"Even if our fears of the dactyl prove false,\" Tuntun added, \"many of the humans are unprepared for the Wilderlands. The presence of a ranger would do them well.\"\n \"The turn of spring?\" Juraviel asked.\n \"You will have the boy prepared for his walk,\" Lady Dasslerond agreed.\n \"And what of Joycenevial?\" Juraviel asked.\n \"The bowyer is ready for him,\" Lady Dasslerond replied. \"And the darkfern is tall this season.\"\n Juraviel nodded. He knew that Joycenevial, the finest bowyer in all of Caer\u0027alfar, in all of the world, had been cultivating a special darkfern all these six years since Elbryan had been brought to Andur\u0027Blough Inninness. This would be Joycenevial\u0027s first human task since Mather, and, since the bowyer was aged even by elven standards, most likely his last.\n This one would-be special.\n Elbryan thought that he knew every trail and grove in the enchanted valley, and so he was indeed confused on that day when Juraviel led him down, a particularly twisting path, often branching and crisscrossing a stream more than a dozen times. Their destination must be important indeed, Elbryan realized, for this trail was even more difficult to follow than the winding ways that hid Caer\u0027alfar itself!\n Finally, after hours of backtracking, the pair came to a short descent down a steep, sandy bank. At the bottom of the ravine, past a blocking wall of low evergreen bushes, they came to a bed of ferns, bluish green in color. Most were about waist high to Elbryan, shoulder high to Juraviel. Elbryan understood immediately that this was their destination, that there was something unusual about these plants; they were growing in neat rows, evenly spaced, and the ground around them was bare. He wouldn\u0027t have expected much undergrowth, for the ferns cast shade, but this area was too clean, as if caring hands regularly weeded it.\n \"These are the darkfern,\" Juraviel said, his tone full of reverence. He led Elbryan to the nearest plant and bent low, bidding the young man to inspect the fern\u0027s stem.\n The plant was thick and smooth, and the stem didn\u0027t seem to narrow at all as it came up high and spread, three-pronged, to the leafy fronds. Elbryan peered closer, and his green eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed again quickly as he moved even closer to inspect the stem.\n Silvery lines wove gracefully about the dark green stem; they seemed to Elbryan consistent with the fishing lines and the bowstrings the elves used.\n \"The darkfern is one with the metal,\" Juraviel explained as soon as he realized that Elbryan had found the key. \"This ravine was chosen for the planting because we learned that it is rich in minerals, particularly silverel, which the plant prefers above all.\"\n \"The plant brings the metal lines up with it?\" Elbryan asked. Many implications came to him then, as if the fog veiling one of the mysteries of elven life had suddenly lifted. The elves used many metal implements -- shields and swords mostly -- and Elbryan had sometimes wondered where they got the material, since, to his knowledge, there were no working mines in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness. He had assumed that they traded for the metal, but then he had come to realize that elven metal was unlike anything he had seen outside the enchanted valley. He remembered his father\u0027s sword, bulky and dark, but that hardly compared to the fine elvish blades, shining bright and holding so keen an edge.\n \"They are as one,\" Juraviel confirmed. \"The darkfern is the lone source of silverel.\"\n Elbryan stared hard at the lines of gleaming metal. He felt as if he had seen this same pattern before, though where that might have been, he could not remember.\n \"Treated and cured properly, the stems are incredibly strong and resilient,\" Juraviel explained; \"and pliable.\"\n \"Even after you take the metal from them?\"\n \"We do not always take the silverel from the harvested stem,\" the elf replied.\n Elbryan thought on that for a moment, particularly on Juraviel\u0027s last claim that the plants were pliable. Then it came to him where he had seen this same design. \"Elvish bows,\" he breathed as the fog flew from yet another mystery. Now he knew how the elvish bows, so small and frail, could launch an arrow a hundred yards on a straight line.\n He looked up from the plant to see Juraviel nodding.\n \"There is no composite, not bone and wood, even when blended with sinew, that is stronger,\" the elf said. He motioned to the man. \"Come with me,\" he bade.\n They walked carefully past the cultivated rows to the tallest fern of -- all, one whose broad fronds were above Elbryan\u0027s head. Unexpectedly, Juraviel handed Elbryan his sword, then motioned the young man back a few paces.\n Elbryan watched, mesmerized, as the elf closed his eyes and began to chant in the elvish tongue, using many words so arcane that Elbryan didn\u0027t recognize them. The song came louder, faster, and Juraviel began to dance delicate, spinning circles wrapped in a larger circle that encompassed the plants. Elbryan concentrated, looking for the root sounds that made up the elf\u0027s song, but still he could not decipher many of the ancient words. He did understand that Juraviel was praising the plant and thanking it for the gift it would soon give. This did not surprise Elbryan; the elves always showed respect for other living creatures, always prayed and danced over the bodies of animals they had hunted, and sang countless songs to the fruits and berries of Andur\u0027Blough Inninness.\n The twirling elf tossed several puffs of powder upon the plant, then bent low and with some reddish gel painted a stripe around the base of the stem just an inch or two from the ground. He finished with a leaping flourish and landed pointing to the stripe. \"One clean strike!\" he commanded.\n Elbryan rolled to one knee quickly and brought the sword flashing across, severing the plant at exactly the stripe. The darkfern landed upright and held for a moment, then slowly tumbled to the side into Juraviel\u0027s waiting hands.\n \"Follow quickly,\" the elf bade, and ran off.\n Elbryan had to work hard to keep up. Juraviel ran all the way back to Caer\u0027alfar, to the side of the glen, to a tall tree that housed only a single elf.\n \"Joycenevial is as old as the oldest tree in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness,\" Juraviel explained as the aged elf came out of his home and slowly descended. Without saying a word, he dropped between the pair, took the cut fern from Juraviel, and held it up near Elbryan. He turned it over and nodded, apparently pleased by the fine and clean cut, then started back up his tree, fern in hand.\n \"No markings?\" Juraviel asked.\n Joycenevial only shook his head, not even bothering to look back at the pair.\n Juraviel praised him once, then started away, Elbryan in tow. The young man had a million questions stirring around in his head. \"The red gel?\" he dared to ask, trying to start a conversation, trying to unravel this most extraordinary day.\n \"Without it, you would never have cut through the darkfern,\" Juraviel replied.\n Elbryan noted the curtness of the answer, the elf\u0027s crisp, almost sharp tone, and he understood that further questioning would be unwelcome, that he would learn what he must when the elves decided to tell him.\n Juraviel sent Elbryan off to his duties then, but interrupted the young man again that afternoon, two bows, including one that was fairly large by elvish standards, in hand.\n \"We haven\u0027t much time,\" Juraviel explained, handing the large bow to his student.\n Elbryan took it and, ignoring the multitude of questions that again swirled in his thoughts, silently followed. He studied the bow as he walked, and concluded at once that this was not formed of the darkfern such as he had cut, but from a smaller plant.\n The old elf took up a curious-looking knife, bent upward on both sides and with its cutting edge on one side of a slit running down its middle. He grasped it firmly in his left hand and cradled the fern stem -- now stripped of its fronds -- in his right. He tucked the long shaft of the plant under his right shoulder, then gently, very gently, scraped the blade along the stem.\n A tiny strip peeled away, so thin as to be nearly translucent. Joycenevial nodded solemnly; he had treated the fern stem perfectly for the carving.\n The old elf closed his eyes and began a chant. He pictured Elbryan at the moment when the young human held the stem, envisioned the size of his hand, the length of his arms. Other bowyers would have marked the stem appropriately, but Joycenevial was far beyond such crude necessities. His was an act of the purest creation and not a mere crafting; his art was bound by magic and by the sheer skill that seven hundred years had honed. And so it was with eyes closed that the old elf went to work on the stem, singing softly, using the music of his voice to pace his cuts in depth and intensity. He would spend the better part of half a year on this one, he knew, scraping and treating, notching and weaving spells of strength. Twice a week during the carving, he would coat the stem with special oils to add to its resilience. And when at last the bow had taken shape, he would hang it over an ever-smoking pit, a secret, enchanted place where the magic was strong indeed, so strong that it continually filtered up from the ground.\n Half a year -- not so long a time as measured by the elves of Caer\u0027alfar, a mere moment in the long history of Belli\u0027mar Joycenevial, father of Juraviel. He closed his eyes and considered the final ceremony, for the bow and the boy: the naming. He had no idea what title he would give the bow; that would come to him as the weapon took on its own personality, its own nuances.\n The name would have to be correct, for this bow would be the epitome of his crafting, Joycenevial determined, the highest achievement in a career so often marked by perfection. Every elf in the valley carried a bow crafted by Joycenevial, as did every ranger that had gone out from Andur\u0027Blough Inninness in the last half millennium. Not one of them would hold their weapon up against this bow, however, for Belli\u0027mar Joycenevial, as old as the oldest tree in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness, knew that it would be his last.\n This one was special.\n At least this time he had hit the tree that held the target! Elbryan looked at Juraviel hopefully, but the elf just stood, shaking his head. In one swift movement, Juraviel put up his bow and let fly an arrow, then another, then a third in rapid succession.\n It had come so fluidly, so fast, that Elbryan was still staring at the elf when he heard the third arrow hit. He was almost afraid to look up at the mark and wasn\u0027t surprised to find all three embedded squarely in the target, one in the bull\u0027seye, the other two right beside it.\n \"I will never shoot as well as you,\" Elbryan lamented, in as close to a whine as Juraviel had heard from the young man in years. \"Or as well as any elf in the valley.\"\n \"True enough,\" retorted the elf, and he smiled as Elbryan\u0027s green eyes widened. That apparently was not the response the young man wanted to hear.\n With a growl, proud Elbryan put up his bow and let fly, missing everything this time.\n \"You are aiming at the target,\" Juraviel remarked.\n Elbryan looked at him curiously; of course he was aiming at the target!\n \"At the whole target,\" the elf explained. \"Yet the tip of your arrow is not nearly large enough to cover the whole.\"\n Elbryan relaxed and tried to decipher the words. He considered them in relationship to the entire elven philosophy of life, the oneness. Suddenly it seemed possible to him that his arrow and the target were one and that his bow was merely a tool he used that he might join the arrow and target.\n \"Aim at a specific, very precise point on the target,\" Juraviel explained. \"You must tighten your focus.\"\n Elbryan understood. He had to find the exact spot where the arrow belonged, the specific point where the two, target and arrow, were to be joined. He lifted the bow -- which was too small for him -- again, drew back to the length of the bend, though his long arms would have allowed him to pull much farther, and let fly.\n He missed, but the arrow notched into the tree barely two inches above the target by far the closest the young man had come.\n \"Well done,\" Juraviel congratulated. \"Now you understand.\" And the elf began to walk away.\n \"Where are you going?\" Elbryan called to him. \"We have only been out for minutes. My quiver holds ten arrows yet.\"\n \"Your lesson for this day is completed,\" Juraviel replied. \"Contemplate it and spend as long as you desire perfecting it.\" The elf walked off, disappearing into the thick brush of the forest.\n Elbryan nodded grimly, determined that by the time Juraviel brought him out here the next day, he would be able to hit that target with ease. He would stay out here all the rest of the day, and would return as soon as his duties with the milk-stones were completed the next morning, so he thought.\n Every time his concentration wavered even a bit, his arrow flew wide of the mark, disappearing into the forest scrub. Elbryan had come out to this place with a full quiver, a score of arrows, but within half an hour, his quiver was empty and not a one could be found. Just as well, the young man thought, for the fingers of his right hand ached, as did the muscle in the middle of his chest, and the inside of his left forearm was badly chafed.\n The next day, Juraviel gave Elbryan a black leather guard to put on that left arm and a new bow, this one not of darkfern but the largest the elf could find in all the valley -- though it was also too small for the towering man. Juraviel also brought with him a light green triangular huntsmen\u0027s cap, which Elbryan accepted with a confused shrug. This time they went out with two full quivers, and Elbryan, improving minute by minute, spent nearly three hours at the range. At the end of the day, Juraviel revealed a new tool for him, the very cap he wore upon his head. The elf showed him how to bring the front tip of the triangular hat low above his eyes and to use that point as a reference in lining up his shots.\n The very next day, Elbryan hit the target two out of every three shots.\n All through the fall and winter, Juraviel trained Elbryan with the bow. The young man learned the practical aspects of the weapon, learned how to fashion arrows, heavy for greater damage and light for longer flight, and how to replace bowstrings -- though the elven silverel string rarely broke. Most important of all, Elbryan came to know that archery was more a test of the mind than the body, a concentration and focus. All of the physical aspects -- the draw, the aiming, the loosing of the arrow -- soon became automatic repetition, but each individual shot remained a mental measure of distance and wind, of the length of the draw and the weight of the arrow. The fingers of the young man\u0027s right hand were soon laced with calluses, and the leather on the inside of his black arm guard had been worn down to half its original thickness. For Elbryan went at this training with all the hunger he had shown in his other endeavors, with a pride and determination that had many of the often scatterbrained elves shrugging their shoulders in disbelief. Every day, whatever the weather, Elbryan was at the target, working, training, drawing shot after shot, and inevitably sinking his arrows into the target, near if not in the bull\u0027s-eye. He learned to shoot fast -- and from different angles: to roll on the ground and come around with an arrow flying; to hang upside down from the branch of a tree, arcing his shot skyward so it held the appropriate range; to let fly two arrows at once and put them near each other, usually both on the target.\n Every morning he performed bi\u0027nelle dasada and then his physical conditioning with the milk-stones. He spent his lunches talking philosophy with Juraviel, then went with the elf to the archery range for more practice.\n His evenings, to his surprise, were most often spent with Tuntun, for the female had been the primary instructor, and friend, of Mather, a man about whom Elbryan desperately wanted to learn more. Tuntun recounted many stories of Mather, from his training days in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness -- he had made so many of the same mistakes as Elbryan! -- to his exploits in the Wilderlands. How many thousands of goblins and giants had fallen to Mother\u0027s deadly blade! That sword, too; became a topic of many discussions, for Tempest, as the blade was named, was one of but six ranger swords ever crafted, the most powerful swords to ever go out from Andur\u0027Blough Inninness. Of the six, only one was still accounted for, a huge broadsword named Icebreaker, wielded by a rarely seen ranger, Andacanavar, in the far northland of Alpinador.\n \"You are of a rare breed indeed,\" Tuntun remarked one starry evening. \"It might be that you are the only ranger alive, though we have not felt the sorrow of Andacanavar\u0027s demise.\"\n The reverence with which she spoke touched Elbryan and at the same time laid a great weight upon his strong shoulders. He had come to feel special, in many ways superior. Because of the elves, he had been given a rare and precious gift: another language -- physical and verbal -- another way of looking at the world about him, another way of perceiving the movements of his own body. He had come so far from that frightened waif stumbling out of burned Dundalis. He was the blood of Mather, Elbryan the Ranger.\n Why, then, was he so terrified?\n To find his answer, Elbryan often visited the Oracle. Each time, it became easier for him to conjure the spirit of Mather, and though the specter never offered any words in response, Elbryan\u0027s own soliloquies allowed the young man to keep things fairly sorted out, to keep his perspective and his nerve.\n The winter, a difficult one even in the enchanted valley -- as Lady Dasslerond had predicted -- passed slowly, the snows coming early and deep and holding on stubbornly as the season shifted to spring.\n For Elbryan, life went along at its usual frantic pace, learning and growing. He was truly an archer now, not as proficient as some of the elves, but certainly an expert by the measure of humans. His understanding of the natural world about him would never be complete -- there was simply too much for any individual to know -- but it continued to deepen with each passing day and each new experience. The entire way in which Elbryan now viewed the world around him was conducive to such learning; truly he was the sponge and all the world a liquid.\n The shift came dramatically, unexpectedly, when Elbryan was roused from his bed one blustery Toumanay night by Juraviel and Tuntun. The elves prodded and pushed him, finally getting him out of his low tree house wearing only a cloak and a loincloth. They escorted him to a wide tree-lined field, where all two hundred elves of Caer\u0027alfar had gathered.\n Juraviel pulled away Elbryan\u0027s cloak, while Tuntun pushed him, shivering, to the middle of the field.\n \"Remove it,\" she said sternly, indicating the loincloth.\n Modesty caused Elbryan to hesitate, but Tuntun wasn\u0027t in the mood for a debate. With a flick of her daggers, one in each hand, she cut away the meager covering, caught it before it dropped two inches, then skittered away, leaving the confused, naked man standing alone, with all the eyes of Andur\u0027Blough Inninness upon him.\n Holding hands, the elves formed a wide circle about him. Then they began to dance, the circle rotating to the left. They broke their line often, individual elves leaping into pirouettes or simply following steps of their own choosing, but in general the rotation continued about Elbryan.\n The elven song filled his ears and all his body, gradually taking him from his place of modesty, relaxing him, intoxicating him. All the forest seemed to join in -- the gusty breezes, the birdsong, the croaking of frogs.\n Elbryan tilted back his head, considering the stars, the few rushing clouds. He found he was turning as the circle turned, as if compelled, as if the elven movement had summoned a whirlpool about him, spinning him with its currents. All seemed a dream, vague and somehow removed.\n \"What do you hear?\" came a question near him. \"At this, your moment of birth, what do you see?\"\n Elbryan didn\u0027t even consider the source -- Lady Dasslerond standing\n right before him. \"I hear the birds,\" he answered absently. \"The night birds.\"\n All the world around him went silent, the dream state shattered by the sudden change. Elbryan blinked a few times as he came to a halt, though, to his dizzy perspective, the stars above him continued on their merry rotating way.\n \"Tai\u0027marawee!\" Lady Dasslerond cried out, and Elbryan, hardly conscious that she was out in the middle of the field with him; jumped at the sound of her voice. He looked down at her as the two hundred elves echoed the cry of \"Tai\u0027marawee!\"\n Elbryan considered the words: tai for \"bird\" and marawee for \"night.\"\n \"The Nightbird,\" Lady Dasslerond explained. \"You have been named Nightbird on this, the evening of your birth.\"\n Elbryan swallowed hard, not comprehending what this was all about. Juraviel and Tuntun certainly had not prepared him for such a ceremony.\n Without explanation, Lady Dasslerond then threw a handful of glittering powder in Elbryan\u0027s face.\n All the world seemed to stop, then to start again but more slowly. The elvish singing and all the harmony of the forest had renewed, and he was alone again in the middle of the field, turning as the circle turned. So gradually that Elbryan never noticed it, the elven voices faded away one by one. He realized he was alone long after all the elves had gone, and before he could decipher any meaning to it all, sleep overtook him, right there, naked in the middle of the field.\n The night of his birth.\n Belli\u0027mar Joycenevial nodded his head as he considered the product of his love. They had named the ranger Nightbird, and so the elf\u0027s dream had not deceived him. This bow, Hawkwing by name, certainly fit all that Elbryan had become.\n Joycenevial held the beautiful weapon up before him. It was taller than he, rubbed and stained to glassy smoothness -- even in the dim light of the single candle, Hawkwing\u0027s dark green, silverlined hue shone clearly -- with a sculpted handgrip and delicate, tapered ends. The removable high tip was set with three feathers, so perfectly aligned that they appeared as one when the bow was at rest.\n Hawkwing and Nightbird -- the old elf liked the connection. This would be the last bow he ever crafted, for he knew beyond doubt that if he made a thousand more, he would never near the perfection of this weapon.\n Elbryan awoke as he had fallen asleep, alone and naked on the field, except that he found a red strip of cloth tied about his left arm, a green strip tied about his right, both crossing the middle of his huge biceps. He considered them for a moment, but didn\u0027t even think of removing them. Then he turned his attention to the awakening world about him. The dawn had long passed; Elbryan knew that he had missed his sword-dance, for the first time since it had been taught to him. Somehow, that morning, it didn\u0027t matter. The young man spotted his cloak and wrapped it about him, but then, instead of returning to his tree house, he went to the Oracle, where he had left his mirror, blanket, and chair.\n \"Uncle Mather?\"\n The spirit was waiting for him, serene in the depths of the mirror. A thousand questions came to Elbryan, but before he could utter even the first, his mind was clouded, by images of a road, of a moor and a forest, of a valley of evergreen trees that seemed vaguely familiar.\n Elbryan fought to steady his breathing; he was beginning to understand. Dark terror crept up all around him, threatening to swallow him where he sat, and he desperately wanted to ask Uncle Mather about it all, to relieve himself one more time of those doubts.\n But this time, Elbryan was a receptacle and not the speaker. This time, he rested back, even closed his eyes, and let that unknown path find its place in his mind.\n He came out of the cave even less relaxed than he had been when he had gone in, his face reflecting his fear and uncertainty, more questions raised than answered.\n When he got back to Caer\u0027alfar, he was surprised to see the place deserted. He moved quickly to his tree house and found it empty of all his possessions -- his clothing, his baskets for collecting the milk-stones.\n A new set of clothes, finely made, was laid out on the floor before him. They had to be for him, for they would obviously fit none other in Caer\u0027alfar. Unless, Elbryan pondered, another would-be ranger had been brought in.\n He shook that thought away, shrugged off his cloak, and began donning the clothing: deerskin boots, high arid soft; supple breeches with a narrow belt made of rope lined with silverel for strength; a soft sleeveless shirt with a leather vest lined in silverel; and finally, a thick forest-green traveling cloak and a lighter-green triangular huntsmen\u0027s cap.\n Elbryan looked around, wondering what he was expected to do next. He thought of the field again and made his way there, to find all the elves of Caer\u0027alfar waiting for him, this time standing quietly in neatly ordered rows. In front of the gathering stood Lady Dasslerond and Belli\u0027mar Juraviel. They motioned immediately for Elbryan to join them.\n When he got there, Juraviel handed him a full pack, a fine knife strapped on one side, a balanced hand axe on the other.\n A long moment passed before Elbryan realized that the elves were waiting for him to properly inspect the gift. He fumbled with the ties and opened the pack, then bent low and gingerly dumped it out onto the ground. Flint and steel, a slender cord of the same silverel-lined rope as his belt, a packet of the same red gel he had seen Juraviel use on the darkfern, the blanket and mirror needed for Oracle -- which must have been retrieved soon after he had left the place -- and most telling of all, a, waterskin and a supply of food, carefully salted and packed.\n Elbryan looked up to his elven friend, but found no answer there. Carefully, his hands trembling, he repacked the satchel, then stood tall before Juraviel and the Lady of Andur\u0027Blough Inninness.\n \"The red band is soaked in permanent salves,\" Juraviel explained. \"Both bandage and tourniquet. The green will filter air when placed over nose and mouth, will even allow you to pass under water for a short time.\"\n \"These are our gifts to you, Nightbird,\" Lady Dasslerond added. \"These and this!\" She snapped her fingers and Belli\u0027mar Joycenevial stepped forth from the ranks of elves, cradling the beautiful bow.\n \"Hawkwing,\" the old elf explained, handing it over. \"It will serve as a staff, as well.\" With a simple movement, he removed the feathered tip, taking the bowstring with it, then just as easily replaced it, bending the bow to restring it with hardly an effort. \"Fear not, for though it seems delicate, you\u0027ll not break it. Not by striking, not by a bolt of lightning, not by the breath of a great dragon!\"\n His proclamation was met by a sudden burst of well-deserved cheering for the old elf.\n \"Draw it,\" Juraviel prompted.\n Elbryan put down the pack and raised the bow. He was amazed by its balance, by the smoothness of its long and comfortable draw. As the bow bent, the three feathers on its top tip separated from one another, looking like the \"fingers\" on the end of the wing of a gliding hawk.\n \"Hawkwing,\" the old bowyer said again to Elbryan. \"It will serve you as bow for all your days, and as staff until you have earned your sword, if ever you do.\"\n Tears in his eyes, the old elf handed over a quiver full of long arrows, then slowly turned and moved back to his place in line.\n \"Our gifts to you,\" Lady Dasslerond said again. \"Which do you consider the most precious?\"\n Elbryan paused for a long while, understanding that this was a critical moment for him, a subtle test that he could not fail. \"All the supplies and clothes,\" he began, \"are worthy of a king, even a king of elves. And this bow,\" he said with all reverence, looking at Joycenevial. \"I am sure that it has no equal and know that I am truly blessed in carrying it.\n \"But the Oracle,\" Elbryan continued, turning back to Lady Dasslerond, his voice firm, \"that is the gift I hold most precious.\"\n The Lady didn\u0027t blink, but suddenly Elbryan knew that he spoke mistakenly. Perhaps it was the slightly crestfallen look of his friend Juraviel that tipped him to the truth of his own thoughts.\n \"No,\" he said quietly, \"that is not the greatest of your gifts.\"\n \"What is?\" the Lady prompted anxiously.\n \"Nightbird,\" Elbryan replied without hesitation. \"All that I am; all that I have become. I am a ranger now, and no gift in all the world -- not all the gold, not all the silverel, not all the kingdoms -- could be greater. The greatest gift is the name you have given me, the name I have earned through your patience and your time, the name that marks me as elf-friend. There could be no higher honor, no higher responsibility.\"\n \"You are ready to face that responsibility,\" Juraviel dared to interject.\n \"It is time for you to go,\" Lady Dasslerond stated.\n Elbryan\u0027s first instinct was to ask where, but he held the thought private, trusting that the elves would tell him if he needed to know. When they did not, when they did nothing but bow to him once, then filter out of the field, leaving him, once again completely alone, he had his answer.\n The Oracle had shown him the way.\n The land was relatively flat and brown, with sparse low shrubs poking here and there. But the gentle slopes were deceiving and the ranger, running smooth, could not usually see very far in any direction. There were the Moorlands -- the Soupy Bogs, they had been affectionately called by the settlers on the edge of the Wilderlands. To the child Elbryan, this had been the place of wildly exaggerated fireside tales.\n Except that now, he ran through the Moorlands, and recalling those tales of howling beasts and horrid guardians wasn\u0027t very comforting.\n The mist was light this day, not closing in on the man as it had the previous day, when Elbryan felt as if watching eyes were with him every step. He came over a rise and saw a silvery stream winding below him, meandering this way and that across the brown clay. Instinctively, the ranger\u0027s hand went to his waterskin, and he found it less than half full. He trotted down to the stream, which was just a few feet across and less than a foot deep, and dipped his hand, nodding when he found that the water was quite clear. The ground here was simply too compacted to be swept up in the light flow. Rivulets of runoff had been crystalline all through the Moorlands, except in those low basins where the water collected and remained, where the ground and water seemed to blend, to melt together into a thick muddy stew.\n Elbryan continued his inspection of the stream to make sure that nothing ominous was swimming along its course, then hooked his pack on the stiff branch of a prickly shrub and gingerly removed his boots. He had been running for five days, the last two in the Moorlands. The cool water and the soft bed beneath it felt good indeed on his sore feet; he briefly considered pulling off all his clothes and lying down in the flow.\n But then he felt something, or heard something. One of his senses subtly called out a warning to him. The ranger froze where he stood, tuned his senses outward to his environment. The muscles in his feet relaxed, nerves on end, feeling for vibrations beneath him. He turned his head side to side slowly, eyes sharp.\n He noted a splash, not so far in the distance upstream.\n Elbryan considered his position. The stream flowed around one of the deceivingly high rises, turning out of sight just a couple dozen yards from where he stood.\n He heard another splash, closer, and then a voice, though he could not make out the words. He looked around again, this time searching for a vantage point, a perch from which he might ambush any enemies. The terrain wasn\u0027t very promising; the best he could do would be backtrack up the rise and crouch just beyond the ridgeline. He would have to time his move perfectly, though, for various areas of that high ground would be visible from around the upstream bend.\n Elbryan dismissed the notion altogether; he was on the eastern edge of the Moorlands by now, not so far from human settlements. Whoever or whatever was coming certainly wasn\u0027t kicking up a storm -- it could not be giants. There was no reason for him to think that these would be enemies.\n Even if they were, Nightbird had Hawkwing in hand.\n He pulled his forest-green cloak tighter about his shoulders, lifted the hood up over his head and cap, then went about his business, crouching low to dip his waterskin in the stream.\n The noise increased -- by the volume and consistency of the splashing, Elbryan figured there must be about a half dozen bipedal creatures approaching. More important to him, though, was the continuing conversation, not the words, of which he could understand only a few, but the high, grating tone of the voices. Elbryan had heard such voices before.\n The splashing and talking stopped suddenly; the creatures had rounded the bend. Elbryan remained crouching. He peeked out around the side of his hood to make sure that they carried no bows.\n Goblins, six of them, stood and gawked from barely thirty feet away, one with a spear up on its shoulder, but not yet ready to throw. The others held clubs and crude swords, but thankfully, no bows.\n Elbryan stayed low. With his posture and his cloak the creatures couldn\u0027t be sure of his race.\n \"Eeyan kos?\" one of them called.\n Elbryan smiled under his hood and did not look the goblins\u0027 way.\n \"Eeyan kos?\" the same one asked again. \"Dokdok crus?\"\n \"Duck, duck, goose,\" Elbryan said under his breath, the name of a game he had played perhaps a decade before. He smiled again as he thought of that innocent time, but it was not a longlasting sentiment, swept away in the wave of darker emotions as he considered what creatures such as these had done to his world.\n The goblin called out again. It was time to answer, he knew, and since he had no idea what the goblin was saying, he merely stood up tall, too tall to be any goblin, and slowly dropped back the hood of his cloak.\n Half of the goblin party shrieked; the spear wielder accompanied its yell by rushing three strides forward and hurling its weapon.\n Elbryan waited until the last possible moment, then flashed Hawkwing across in front of him, deflecting the spear. He moved the bow around and out as it connected, diverting then defeating the spear\u0027s momentum, turning it harmlessly in midair and then catching it mid-shaft in his right hand as his left brought Hawkwing back to his side.\n Suddenly he held the spear, aimed right back at its original wielder. That stopped the goblins cold before they could even begin to charge.\n Emotions churned confusingly in the young man. He remembered the teachings of the elves, mostly of tolerance, though they held no love for goblinkind or for any of the fomorian races. However, Elbryan was not in any human settlement, not in any land claimed by his kind, and quite possibly was within the boundaries of goblin territory. If that was the case, would he be justified in waging battle with these six?\n Yet, one had just attacked him, though it might have come more from fear than aggression. And Elbryan, whatever logical reasoning he summoned, could not possibly dismiss those memories of Dundalis.\n He hesitated; were these goblins responsible for what their kin had done to Elbryan\u0027s home? The one the elves had named Nightbird had to give himself an honest answer; he owed that much, at least, to Belli\u0027mar Juraviel.\n A flick of his powerful wrist sent the spear flying back the way it had come, to land with a splash and stick up from the stream just a foot or so in front of the creature who had thrown it. Elbryan cast a warning glance the goblins\u0027 way, then turned sideways to them, focusing on the water, and bent down to finish filling his waterskin.\n He had given them one chance; a large part of him, that boy who remembered Dundalis, hoped they would not take it.\n He heard and felt the water stirring as the creatures came on slowly. He sensed that at least two had broken away, moving out of the stream to flank him front and back.\n Elbryan measured their approach, kept wary for any hint that the spear was coming his way once more.\n Everything seemed to stop, all movement, all splashing. The creatures were not more than ten feet away, he knew. Slowly he turned square with the main group of four, rising to stand straight, a foot and more higher than his tallest foe.\n \"Eenegash!\" the closest and ugliest of the group demanded, holding forth its sword, a two-foot blade not unlike the one Olwan had given Elbryan for his patrols.\n \"I do not understand,\" he replied evenly.\n The goblins muttered something among themselves; Elbryan realized that they could not understand his language either. Then the ugly one turned back to him.\n \"Eenegash! \" it said again, more forcefully, and it pointed its sword at the staff, then at the riverbank.\n \"I hardly think so,\" Elbryan replied, smiling widely and shaking his head. In a barely noticeable movement, the ranger pulled the feathered tip from the bow, tucking it and the bowstring into his belt.\n The goblin gave a threatening growl. Elbryan shook his head again.\n The creature rushed to close half the distance and prodded with its sword, a movement more of intimidation than an actual attack. But it was the creature who was surprised.\n Elbryan grabbed the staff, right hand over left; reversed his grip with his left as the pole started moving, and snapped it across so quickly in front of him that the goblin never had a chance to move. The staff connected simultaneously on the sword and the goblin\u0027s hand, knocking the weapon from the creature\u0027s grasp and launching it a dozen feet away. A subtle shift, still too quick for the creature to dodge, and Elbryan stabbed the tapered end out straight, striking the goblin on its sloping forehead right above and between the eyes, laying it out straight in the stream.\n With a whoop of delight, the other goblins, predictably, came on.\n Elbryan brought his staff back in, letting go with his left hand, flipping with his right to send the forward tip under. Never breaking the momentum, he extended his right arm out, catching the closing goblin, the one that had run out of the stream to flank the man, completely by surprise, Hawkwing\u0027s tip stabbing right under its chin.\n Back in came the weapon, a full and defensive spin between the ranger and the three goblins coming along in the stream. Elbryan caught the staff firmly in his left hand and extended that arm out in similar fashion so that the other flanking goblin was poked away. Back in came the staff, half spun and caught again in the right hand, half spun, angled outward diagonally, and caught again in the left, and then the right hand catching it, too, as the trailing end came around and over, Elbryan shifting the weapon\u0027s angle and striding boldly ahead. The downward chop connected squarely on the head of the center goblin, the spearwielder, Hawkwing\u0027s incredible hardness splitting wide the creature\u0027s skull with a resounding crack!\n Elbryan swept his staff out to the left, knocking aside a club strike, then back to the right, parrying a sword. Back left, back right, each time the angle shifting to defeat the intended attack. Then back left, then left again, knocking wide the creature\u0027s club arm. Elbryan stepped left as well and spun, avoiding an awkward cut of its sword. He came around hard and low, Hawkwing flying before him. The goblin, to its credit, recognized the circuitous attack and managed to get its club down, but Elbryan merely lifted Hawkwing\u0027s flying tip, cracking across the creature\u0027s skinny forearm, shattering bone. The club fell into the stream; the goblin shrieked and clutched at its arm.\n Elbryan stepped forward, facing the creature squarely, staff coming horizontal in front of him, and punched out with his left, right, left, Hawkwing swishing about to smack the goblin hard on alternate sides of its head. The ranger dropped his right foot back after the last strike, retracting the staff, then turned sidelong to his current foe, expecting an attack from the sword wielder. Seeing that creature in full flight, Elbryan stabbed the staff back out hard to his left, hitting the dazed and battered goblin right in the face.\n He didn\u0027t see but heard the movement as the goblin that had come in at his left struggled to its feet. Hawkwing went swinging again, turning a vertical circle under and then over Elbryan\u0027s right shoulder as he turned and leaped out to the left. Down raced the staff above the angle of the terrified goblin\u0027s pitiful attempt to parry, crashing hard against the base of the creature\u0027s neck. The goblin jolted perfectly still and then, as if the wave of energy had rolled right down to its feet and then come rushing back up, the creature went into a weird Backward leap, landing on its feet for a long moment, then slowly falling over.\n Elbryan turned and dropped into a defensive crouch, but no enemies presented themselves. The first one he had hit, the leader, was. on its hands and knees in the middle of the stream, facing away, too dazed to even get back to its feet. The one he had hit to the right of the stream was still on the ground, squirming and gasping for air that would hardly come. This last one he had hit was surely dead, as was the spear wielder, and the one who had taken four blows to the head lay unmoving at the stream\u0027s edge, its face in the water. The last of the group, the one with the sword, faced Elbryan from twenty paces, hopping up and down, hurling curses that the ranger did not understand.\n Casually, in no hurry, Elbryan replaced the feathered tip of his bow and in one fluid motion, bent the shaft around his leg and hooked the bowstring over the bottom edge.\n The goblin caught on, howled, and fled.\n Up came Hawkwing; three feathers separated. Clear and straight for thirty- five feet.\n The arrow slammed the goblin square in the back, lifting it clear of the stream and sending it another five feet. Arms and legs flailing, it flopped heavily, facedown in the water.\n Grim Elbryan retrieved the axe from the side of his pack and finished the task at hand.\n Then he was on his way, running across the Moorlands.\n Part Three CONFLICT\n Did you go home, Uncle Mother? When you walked away from Andur\u0027Blough Inninness, from your elven home, did you return to the place you had known in your childhood?\n I had thought it a vision that led me across the Moorlands then north to a sweeping vale of knee-deep caribou moss and stark pines. Now I wonder if it wasn\u0027t merely a memory returned, a backtracking of the same course the elves. had taken on that day when they pulled rite from Dundalis. Perhaps they then placed a veil over my memory, that I had no desire to escape Caer\u0027alfar and run back to the place of my kinfolk. Perhaps that last Oracle in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness was no more than a lifting of the veil.\n I had not even considered this until my northern trek led me back to these lands familiar. I feared that I had erred in my course, that I had returned home by memory, not by vision.\n Now I understand This land is my land, my ranger haunt. It is under my protection, though the proud and hardy folk here would hardly believe they need it, and certainly would refuse it should I ask.\n They are more numerous than when I lived here last. Weedy Meadow remains a village of four score -- the goblins never attacked after the sacking of Dundalis -- and a new village, nearly twice that in number, has been built some thirty miles to the west, even further into the Wilderlands. End-o\u0027-the-World, they call it, and a fitting name it seems.\n And, Uncle Mother, they have rebuilt Dundalis and have kept its name. I do not yet understand how I feel about this. Is the new Dundalis a tribute to the last or a mockery? It pained me when, walking along the wide cart path, l happened upon a signposts new signpost, for we never had such things -- proclaiming the village limits, the edge of Dundalis. For a moment, I admit, I even held fast a fantasy that my memory of the destruction, of the carnage, was in error. Perhaps, I dared to think, the elves had tricked me into believing that Dundalis and all its folk had died, to keep me from fleeing their custody, or from wanting to flee.\n Under the name on the signpost, someone had scrawled \"Dundalis dan Dundalis, \" and under that, another prankster had added \"McDundalis, \" both indications that this place was \"the son of Dundalis. I should have understood the implication.\n It was with great anticipation that l walked that last mile to the village proper -- to see a place that I knew not.\n There is a tavern now, larger than the old common house and built on the foundation of my old home.\n Built by strangers.\n It was such an awkward moment, Uncle Mather, a feeling of absolute displacement. l had come home, and yet, this was not my home. The people were much the same -- strong and firm, tough as the deepest winter night -- and yet, they were not the same. No Brody Gentle, no Bunker Crawyer, no Shane McMichaer no Thomas Ault, no Mother and Father, no Pony.\n No Dundalis.\n I refused the invitation. of the tavern\u0027s proprietor, a jolly-looking man, and without a word -- I suppose that was the moment the folk of the village began to suspect that l was a bit unusual -- headed back the way I had come. I took my frustrations out on the signpost, I admit, tearing off the lowest board, the scribbled references to the original village.\n Never had I felt so alone, not even that morning after the disaster. The world had moved on without me. I meant to come and speak with you then, Uncle Mather, and so I crossed by the town, up the slope on the northern edge. There are several small caves on the backside of that slope, overlooking the wide vale. In one of those, so I believed, I would find Oracle. I would find Uncle Mather. I would find peace.\n I never made it over that ridge. It is a funny thing, memory. To the elves, it is a way to walk backward in time, to rediscover old scenes from the perspective of new enlightenments.\n So it was that morning on the ridge north of Dundalis. I saw her,\n Uncle Mather, my Pony, as alive to me as ever she was, as wonderful and beautiful. I remembered her so very vividly that she was indeed beside me once again for a few fleeting moments.\n I have no new friends among the current residents of Dundalis, and in truth, I expect none. But I have found peace, Uncle Mather. I have come home. -ELBRYAN WYNDON \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demon-awakens-the-demonwars-saga-1/page-23.html","bookId":2167,"book":{"id":2167,"title":"The Demon Awakens (The DemonWars Saga #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Demon Awakens (The DemonWars Saga #1) \n In THE DEMON AWAKENS, bestselling author R.
