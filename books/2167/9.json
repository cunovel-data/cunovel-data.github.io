{"id":98167,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"The schedule was grueling, designed to find weakness and break those who were not fit for the daily rigors of the Order of St.-Mere-Abelle. For the four chosen Preparers candidates, Avelyn and Quintall, Thagraine and Pellimar -- two students from the class of God\u0027s Year 815 -- life was even more difficult. In addition to their daily duties as first -- and second -- year students at the abbey, they were given the extra chores of preparation for their journey to Pimaninicuit.\\n\\n After vespers, their classmates knelt to pray for one hour, spent an hour with their letters, then retired early to meditate and sleep, to reinvigorate their bodies for the tasks of the next day.\\n\\n But after vespers, the four Preparers began a four-hour regimen, each with an appointed master. They studied the Halo, the charts that determined the astronomical data which would indicate the time of the showers. They learned of seamanship, of how to navigate by the stars of the night sky -- and of how those stars would change when the ship carrying the monks crossed certain latitudes. They learned how to tie ropes in a variety of ways, knots necessary for the many uses aboard a sailing vessel. They learned sea etiquette, the rules of the wide waters, and they learned, most of all, the properties of the various stones and of how they must prepare the stones immediately after the shower.\\n\\n For Avelyn, the night lessons were the promise of his greatest aspirations. He was with Master Jojonah most nights, and Avelyn lived up to his reputation as the finest student to enter St.-Mere-Abelle in many decades. After only two weeks, his predictions of astronomical shifts were perfect, and within the first month, he could recite all the known magical stones, from adamite to turquoise, their reputed properties, and the greatest known magical effects which had been brought about by each.\\n\\n Master Jojonah watched the young brother with mounting pride, and Avelyn recognized that the older man considered him a protege. There was security in that, Avelyn came to realize, but also responsibility. Some of the other masters, Siherton in particular, watched him closely, very closely, seeking an excuse to berate him. It seemed to Avelyn as if he had fallen into the middle of a running rivalry between the two older men.\\n\\n That bothered the young monk profoundly. To see such human frailty in the masters of St.-Mere-Abelle touched the very core of Avelyn\u0027s faith. These were men of God, the men closest to God, and such petty actions on their part diminished the very meaning of the Abellican Church. All that should have mattered was the retrieval of the stones. Toward his fellow Preparers, young men he would compete against for the coveted two positions of those who would actually step onto the island of Pimaninicuit, Avelyn felt no rivalry. He exalted in their successes as much as in his own. If they proved the better, he believed, then that was obviously God\u0027s will. The proven better two must go to the island; all that mattered was the success of the journey, the retrieval of God\u0027s highest gift to humanity.\\n\\n It quickly became apparent to the watching masters that Avelyn Desbris would be one of the two. During the long hours put in at night, not one of the other three came close to him; they were still mired in charting the stars when Avelyn had moved on to the specific humours that caused the \"magical\" reaction, having already passed through the recognition of the stones by touch as well as sight and the recognition of their potential intensity by their brightness, shape, and hue. After only five weeks of a four-year training program, the first position of Preparer was nearly secured. If Avelyn did not take ill, the competition to go onto the island of Pimaninicuit had been narrowed to three monks fighting for one slot.\\n\\n The daytime training was not as easy or as inspiring for Avelyn. He found the many prayer rituals boring, even trite, in light of the revelations he was finding every night. The candle ceremonies, the water bucket lines, the stone carriers bringing material to the newest sections of the abbey, the gift of the class of God\u0027s Year 816, simply did not measure up against the mysteries of the God-given stones. Worst of all, and most intense of all, was the physical training. From sunrise to noon each day; with only an hour break -- half for a meal and half for a prayer the students assembled in a courtyard for a lesson in the martial arts or ran barefoot along the rough walls of the abbey or swam in the frigid waters of All Saints Bay. For months they learned to fall and roll; they hardened their bodies by slapping, slapping, slapping one another until their skin grew less sensitive. They walked through attack and defense routines, slowly, endlessly, building in their sore muscles memories of the moves. For the first year, they would study barehanded techniques, punching and grappling. After that, the monks would move on to weapon mastery. And through it all, bare- handed and with weapons, they would square off against each other, pounding on each other relentlessly. Physical perfection was the goal; it was said that a monk of St.-Mere-Abelle could outfight any man alive, and the masters seemed determined to keep that reputation intact.\\n\\n Avelyn was not the worst of his class, but he was certainly not near the best: Quintall. The short, stocky man went at the martial training as eagerly as Avelyn went at the nighttime studies. As the year progressed, as Avelyn further separated himself from the other three candidate Preparers, he came to dread his daytime matches against any of them, particularly Quintall. There was supposed to be no anger toward an opponent, only respect and mutual learning, but Quintall growled whenever the masters paired him against Avelyn.\\n\\n Avelyn understood the man\u0027s motives. Quintall was carrying over the nighttime rivalry. He could not beat Avelyn at the Ring Stone studies, but he gained a measure of superiority during the day. In most of the maneuvers, the monks were supposed to pull their punches, but Quintall often blasted the breath from Avelyn; there was no striking above the shoulders allowed, but more than once, Quintall knifed a \"serpent hand\" across Avelyn\u0027s throat, dropping him to his knees, gasping for breath.\\n\\n \"Is this how you plan, to get to the island?\" Avelyn quietly asked after one such mishap. The slips had become too common; Avelyn honestly believed Quintall meant to eliminate the competition.\\n\\n The look the stocky man gave him in reply did little to allay the monk\u0027s mounting suspicions. Quintall\u0027s grin was certainly as far from Godlike as anything Avelyn had ever seen, and the fact that their training with weapons, where wounds could easily become more severe, was not far away, brought goose bumps to the scholarly young man.\\n\\n What bothered Avelyn even more was that if he could recognize what was going on here, then so could the masters, who watched every move of every student so closely. The Order of St.-Mere-Abelle took its physical training seriously; perhaps Avelyn was expected to defend himself against such tactics. Perhaps this training was not so far removed from the nighttime training, which Avelyn considered more important. If he couldn\u0027t survive in the courtyard of the abbey, after all, what chance did he have on the high and wild seas?\\n\\n He watched Quintall walk away from him, his stride so confident, even cocky. Avelyn folded his hands and bowed his head, closed his eyes and began to plot his defense for the next time he and Quintall were paired.\\n\\n All the troubles of the day were lost each night when Avelyn went to his true work, usually under the tutelage of Master Jojonah. Sometimes that work entailed exhaustive study, reading text after text and reciting procedures so many times in rapid succession that Avelyn would often continue reciting them after he had gone to sleep. Other nights Avelyn and Master Jojonah would simply spend on the roof, huddled against a chill ocean breeze with no fire between them. They would sit and stare at the stars. An occasional question might pass between them, but otherwise their vigil would be as silent as it was dark. Master Jojonah\u0027s instructions were vague at best, but Avelyn came to understand them in his heart. He was to watch the night sky, to learn every twinkle of light, to become so familiar with the visible stars that he would not only know their given names but also might create pet names of his own for them.\\n\\n Avelyn loved those nights. He felt so close to God, to his dead mother, to all humanity, living and dead. He felt a part of the larger and higher truths, a oneness with the universe.\\n\\n But the quiet awe. of stargazing placed a distant second on Avelyn\u0027s preferred list of duties. His real zest and heart came shining through on those nights he and Master Jojonah worked with the stones. There were nearly fifty different types at the abbey, each with its own particular properties, and each individual stone with its own particular intensity. Some stones had multiple uses -- hematite, for example, could be used for simple out-of-body experiences, for possession of another\u0027s body, for domination of another\u0027s spirit, and also to heal another\u0027s physical wounds.\\n\\n Avelyn knew all the uses of all the stones, and gradually he was coming to sensitize his fingers to the magical humours within any stone he touched. Handed two similar stones, Avelyn could quickly discern which was the stronger.\\n\\n Jojonah nodded on each occasion as if expecting that of any student, but in truth the master was again amazed by the young man\u0027s prowess. There were in the abbey no more than four other monks, three of them masters and one Father Abbot Markwart himself, who could so distinguish magical intensity, and that fact had been the determining factor in Dalebert Markwart\u0027s ascension to the highest rank, for his chief rival could not determine magical intensity in individual stones.\\n\\n And here before Jojonah\u0027s astonished eyes was a young novice, a man of only twenty winters, performing feats that would tax the Father Abbot of St.- Mere-Abelle to the very limits of his powers!\\n\\n \"The night is cloudy,\" Avelyn dared to note, one dreary and cold November evening as he followed Master Jojonah up the winding staircase of a tower, toward the perch where they would normally sit and study the stars.\\n\\n Master Jojonah kept quiet and continued on his way, and Avelyn knew better than to press the point.\\n\\n Avelyn was even more surprised, when he came to the tower top, to find Master Siherton and the Father Abbot waiting for them. Siherton held a small diamond, and from it came enough light for Avelyn to discern the man\u0027s features clearly. The young man bowed low and kept his gaze on the floor stones even when he straightened, focusing his attention on the joints among the rocks, each black line seeming so distinct in the harsh diamond light. He had been in St.- Mere-Abelle for several months and had only gazed upon Father Abbot Markwart a handful of times, usually at vespers, when the older leader would sometimes come forth and oversee the celebration.\\n\\n The three older men moved to the edge of the tower and talked among themselves. Avelyn tried hard not to eavesdrop, but he did catch snatches of the conversation, mostly Siherton complaining vigorously that this was against strict procedure. \"This is neither a requirement nor a sensible test for any first-year student,\" the tall and hawkish master argued.\\n\\n \"Not a test, but a show,\" Jojonah argued, * unintentionally lifting his voice.\\n\\n \"A show-off, more likely,\" sneered Siherton. \"The place has already been secured,\" he went on. \"Why must you press on with it?\"\\n\\n Jojonah stamped his foot and pointed an accusing finger at Siherton; Avelyn was quick to look away from that uncomfortable sight. How it bothered him to see masters bickering! Particularly when he realized that they were arguing over him!\\n\\n Now Avelyn began to recite his evening prayers so that he might hear no more. He did catch one reference by Master Jojonah to the morning routine, something about its being too dangerous.\\n\\n Finally, Father Abbot Markwart halted the conversation with an upraised hand. He led the two masters back to Avelyn and bade the young man to look up at him. \"It is unusual,\" he said calmly. \"And know you, Masters Siherton and Jojonah, that it is neither a test nor a show and irrelevant to the decisions to be made concerning Pimaninicuit. Suffice it to say that it is for my pleasure, for my curiosity.\"\\n\\n He focused on Avelyn then, his face serene, comforting. \"I have heard much about you, my son,\" he said quietly. \"Your progress has been monumental in Master Jojonah\u0027s estimation.\"\\n\\n Avelyn was too awestruck to beam.\\n\\n \"You have used the stones?\"\\n\\n It took a long moment for Avelyn even to register the question. He nodded dumbly.\\n\\n \"You have walked high with hematite, so says Master Jojonah,\" Abbot Markwart went on. \"And you have lit the hearths of many rooms with the small celestite crystals.\"\\n\\n Avelyn nodded again. \"The greatest was the hematite,\" he managed to say.\\n\\n The Father Abbot smiled gently. \"Satisfy my curiosity,\" he bade Avelyn. He held out his left hand and opened it to show Avelyn three stones: malachite, ringed with various shades of green; shining, polished amber; and a silvery piece of chrysotile, the largest of the three resembling a sheet of straight bars, long and narrow lying side by side.\\n\\n \"Do you know them?\" Markwart asked.\\n\\n Avelyn sorted them out in his mind. He did indeed know the magical properties of these three, though those properties seemed oddly disparate for Father Abbot Markwart to be presenting them together. He nodded.\\n\\n Markwart handed him the stones. \"Do you feel their intensity?\" he asked, looking hard into Avelyn\u0027s eyes. He needed to know the truth, Avelyn realized. Markwart needed to be absolutely certain.\\n\\n Avelyn fell into the stones, closed his eyes, and passed the items one at a time into his free hand that he might weigh their magical strength. He opened his eyes a moment later, staring hard at the Father Abbot, and nodded again.\\n\\n \"Why must we use such a combination?\" Master Jojonah dared to interrupt.\\n\\n Father Abbot Markwart, his eyes glowing fiercely in the diamond light, waved a hand to silence the master. Nonetheless, Jojonah began to protest again, but Markwart cut him short.\\n\\n \"I warned you of the conditions!\" the old Father Abbot growled.\\n\\n Avelyn swallowed hard; he had never imagined such ferocity coming from the gentle man, the most Godly man in all the world.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll not allow the ruby to be used anywhere near St.-Mere-Abelle.\" Father Abbot Markwart went on. \"I\u0027ll not take such a chance for the sake of your student\u0027s pride.\" He turned back to Avelyn and smiled again, but there was little gentle or comforting in that hungry grin. \"If Brother Avelyn cannot utilize the simple stones I have given to him, then he has no right even to hold this one.\" He ended by bringing forth his other hand, turning it over, and opening it to reveal the most beautiful, perfect jewel that Avelyn had ever seen.\\n\\n \"Corundum,\" the Father Abbot explained. \"A ruby. Before I give this to you, understand that what I ask of you is dangerous indeed.\"\\n\\n Avelyn nodded and reached out for the jewel, too stunned to fully appreciate the gravity in the old man\u0027s voice. Markwart handed it over.\\n\\n \"The puzzle is before you,\" the Father Abbot explained. \"There are no ships in. Sort it out.\" With that, he walked to the far edge of the tower and motioned for the two masters to join him.\\n\\n Avelyn studied them intently. Father Abbot Markwart appeared wickedly intense, the gleam in his eyes seeming almost maniacal, and certainly frightening. Master Siherton wouldn\u0027t even look his way, and Avelyn could sense that the man desired his failure. Master Jojonah was the most intense, but in a kinder way. Avelyn could smell the man\u0027s fear -- fear for Avelyn\u0027s safety -- and only then did the young monk appreciate the weight of this performance and the danger.\\n\\n \"Sort it out,\" the Father Abbot said again urgently.\\n\\n Avelyn bowed his head and considered the stones. The ruby was thrumming in his hand, its magic intense and straining for release. Avelyn knew what he could do with that jewel, and when he stopped to consider the implications for the other monks if he used the ruby first, the puzzle seemed not so difficult. Father Abbot Markwart had pointedly mentioned that there were no ships in; Avelyn knew where he was supposed to go. Malachite, amber, serpentine, ruby, in that order.\\n\\n Avelyn paused and considered the sequence and the implications. He would have to have not one but two other stones already in use when he called forth the powers of the ruby. He had once used two stones together -- a hematite and a chrysoberyl, that he might walk out of body with no urge to take possession of any form he passed. But three? Avelyn took a deep breath, consciously keeping his eyes from the eager gazes of the onlookers.\\n\\n Malachite first, he told himself; and he walked to the outer edge of the tower, overlooking the sea, black and thunderous a hundred yards below. Avelyn clutched the malachite firmly, felt its magic tingling and coursing through his hand, then his arm, and into all his body. And then he felt lighter, strangely so, almost as light as he did when spirit-walking with hematite. He went over the tower\u0027s edge with hardly a hesitation, his body beginning a gentle, controlled fall.\\n\\n Avelyn tried not to think of the reality of his position as the tower walls slipped past his descending form. The cliff wall below the tower was less smooth and far from sheer, and the young monk had to constantly push himself away, angling down and out from the abbey.\\n\\n As he neared the pounding surf, Avelyn shifted the amber into the hand holding the malachite and brought forth its powers as well.\\n\\n He touched down easily atop the surf, berating himself for not simply walking his body horizontally across the cliff to land atop the wharf instead. No sense in worrying about that now, he decided; so he kept the malachite functioning until he caught his balance, then, with a deep breath, let it go.\\n\\n Only the amber was functioning now, and it kept him above the water. With another deep and steadying breath, his confidence in the stone growing, Avelyn walked out across the dark waters, his feet barely making the slightest depression on the rolling surface.\\n\\n He looked back over his shoulder several times as he moved out from the abbey. He had to get far enough away so that using the ruby would not pose any risk to the structure, and even farther than that, considering the angle of the tall tower, if he wanted the two masters and the Father Abbot truly to witness the demonstration.\\n\\n Now Avelyn called upon the serpentine, a stone he had never before put to any real test. He knew its reputed properties, of course, but he had never attempted to use them. Master Jojonah had done so once in Avelyn\u0027s presence, when he had retrieved a jewel from a hot hearth, and the young monk had to focus on that now to take faith that the serpentine would protect him.\\n\\n All too soon, the moment was upon him. He was far out from shore, standing firm on the rolling waves, the serpentine shield strong about him. Avelyn put the ruby in his hand.\\n\\n \"He might have slipped under the waters,\" Siherton said dryly. \"A great and difficult task we will have in retrieving the stones.\"\\n\\n Father Abbot Markwart chuckled, but Master Jojonah didn\u0027t appreciate the levity. \"Brother Avelyn is worth more to us than all the stones in St.-Mere- Abelle combined,\" he asserted, drawing incredulous looks from both his companions.\\n\\n \"I think, perhaps, that you have become too close to this novice,\" the Father Abbot warned.\\n\\n Before the old man could go on, though, his breath was stolen away as a tremendous fireball erupted out at sea, rings of searing flames spreading out wide from a central point that the three knew to be Avelyn.\\n\\n \"Pray that the serpentine shield was in full!\" Markwart gasped, thoroughly stunned by the intensity and size of the blast. The ruby was strong, but this was ridiculous!\\n\\n \"I told you!\" Master Jojonah said over and over. \"I told you!\"\\n\\n Even Siherton had little in the way of rebuttal. He watched, as impressed as his companions, as the fireball widened and churned, as the ocean hissed in protest so loudly that the three could hear it clearly, as the top waters turned to steam and rose in a thick fog. Brother Avelyn was strong indeed!\\n\\n And probably dead, Siherton realized, though he was too shaken to make the point at that moment. If Avelyn had concentrated so much of his energy into the ruby, then likely he had let the serpentine shield slip. Then likely he was now a charred thing, drifting to the bottom of the harbor.\\n\\n The three waited a long time, Jojonah growing ever more concerned, but Markwart resignedly saying, \"A pity,\" many times, and Siherton seeming on the verge of a chuckle.\\n\\n Then came a sound not so far below them, a deep breath as one might take after great exertion. They rushed to the edge and peered over, Siherton holding the diamond low, focusing its light downward to reveal a haggard-looking but very much alive Brother Avelyn, the malachite clenched tightly in one hand, his other hand working at the wall, pulling his nearly weightless body upward. Avelyn\u0027s brown robes were tattered and dripping; he had the stench of burned hair about him.\\n\\n He got near the tower\u0027s lip and Jojonah pulled him over.\\n\\n \"Some of the flames got through,\" a shivering Avelyn explained, bowing his head in shame, holding his arms wide to display the damage to his robe. \"I had to let go of the amber\u0027s power briefly and dunk myself.\"\\n\\n Only then did Jojonah realize how blue Avelyn\u0027s lips appeared. He looked sharply at Siherton, and when the master didn\u0027t respond; Jojonah snatched the diamond from him. The light went out for just a moment, then returned, brighter than ever. And warmer. Jojonah held the diamond close to Avelyn, and the young monk felt its warmth flowing into his aching, frozen form.\\n\\n \"I am sorry,\" Avelyn said to Father Abbot Markwart through chattering teeth. \"I have failed.\" He held his hand out limply, returning the four stones.\\n\\n Father Abbot Markwart burst out into the most heartfelt laughter Avelyn had ever heard. The cackling old man pocketed the four stories, then clenched his empty fist, and from a ring on his finger, set with a tiny diamond, he brought forth a light of his own. He motioned for Siherton to follow and started for the stairs.\\n\\n Master Jojonah waited until the pair had gone, then lifted Avelyn\u0027s head so the young brother could look directly into his soft brown eyes. \"You will be one of the chosen pair who go onto the island of Pimaninicuit,\" he said with all confidence.\\n\\n He led Avelyn down from the tower then, to the warmth of the lower levels. Avelyn undressed and wrapped a blanket about himself, then sat alone with his thoughts in front of a blazing fire. Though the trial of the four stones, the high wall, and the cold sea had exhausted him, he did not sleep that night. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demon-awakens-the-demonwars-saga-1/page-9.html","bookId":2167,"book":{"id":2167,"title":"The Demon Awakens (The DemonWars Saga #1)","description":"Storyline: The Demon Awakens (The DemonWars Saga #1) \\n In THE DEMON AWAKENS, bestselling author R.
