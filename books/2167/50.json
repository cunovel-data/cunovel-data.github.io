{"id":98208,"no":50,"title":"Page 50","content":"\"The terrain grows more wild, Uncle Mather, more fitting to the nature of our enemies. The trees are older, never harvested by humans, and darker. The animals do not fear us, do not respect our weapons or our cunning.\"\\n\\n Elbryan rested back against the diagonal tree root in this impromptu room of Oracle, digesting his own words. They were true enough; in this region so far to the north of any known human settlements, all the world seemed somehow larger and more imposing. The towering mountains that formed the dread Barbacan loomed less than a day\u0027s march away, dominating the northern horizon, making the travelers feel smaller still.\\n\\n \"It brings me mixed feelings,\" the ranger went on. \"I fear for our safety -- will I be able to protect my friends, not necessarily from the threats of our enemy but from the simple truths of survival in this region? And yet, out here, I am somewhat more free than ever, more true to the training the elves have given me. There is no room for error in the far north, no margin of safety, and that keeps me ever vigilant, on my guard, tingling with wariness. I am afraid, and thus, I am alive.\"\\n\\n Again, Elbryan sat back, smiling at the irony of it all. I am afraid, and thus, I am alive.\\n\\n \"If given the opportunity, most people would choose a life of quiet luxury,\" he said softly, \"would choose to surround themselves with servants, with concubines, even. That is their mistake, for out here, danger ever present, I am ten times more alive than ever they could be. And with the. challenge that is Pony and with the challenge I hope that I pose for her I am many times more satisfied. It is, I believe, the difference between physical satisfaction and true lovemaking, the difference between release and passion. I may die soon following this course before me, but out here, at one with my spirit and my nature, on the edges of catastrophe, I have lived many times more than most will ever know.\\n\\n \"So I do not regret this journey that fate has laid before me, Uncle Mather, nor do I regret that the others -- Bradwarden and Avelyn, Paulson and Chipmunk, and most of all, Pony -- have been swept along this course. I pity Belli\u0027mar Juraviel, that he could not see it through, that duty turned his path.\"\\n\\n Elbryan put his chin in his paten, resting, thinking, and staring always at the faint image at the corner of the mirror. It was true, all of it; he hated the death and the suffering, of course, but he could not deny his excitement, and the sense of righteousness, the belief that he was indeed making a difference in the world.\\n\\n He looked closely at Mather\u0027s image, seeking a smile of approval or a frown that would indicate his feelings were not true but merely a contrived defense against despair. He looked closely, and he saw a shadow beginning to creep in across the glassy surface within the depths of the mirror. The ranger sighed, thinking this a sign of disapproval, thinking that he might have fallen into a trap of justifications, but gradually he came to understand that it was not a cloud emanating from Mather or from his own true feelings. Elbryan began to understand that it was something else, something darker by far.\\n\\n Elbryan sat bolt upright, unblinking. \"Uncle Mather?\" he asked breathlessly, a coldness creeping into his very body.\\n\\n A coldness, a blackness, a living death.\\n\\n The ranger\u0027s mind was whirling, trying to make sense of the undeniable event. Only one creature could bring such darkness, he realized, and then, suddenly, he understood. Whether Mather had facilitated the warning from the other side of life, or whether it was simply a connection wrought of the magic of Oracle, Elbryan neither knew nor cared. What he did know was that the, demon dactyl was searching for him; for them, sending its otherworldly vision out far and wide.\\n\\n Fear gripped Elbryan as he realized that his own use of Oracle might be helping his enemy locate him and his friends. He leaped up, slamming his head against the roots and ground that formed the cave\u0027s ceiling, and rushed to the mirror, turning it down, breaking all connection. He scrambled for the exit then, pulling down the blanket and wrapping it about the mirror, then crawled out into the waning daylight, calling for Avelyn.\\n\\n From the flow of molten lava, the demon dactyl pulled its latest creation -- a glowing spike, a tapering spear -- and held it aloft.\\n\\n \"Fools all.\" The beast laughed, eyeing its masterpiece, a weapon that would find and destroy the pitiful humans seeking Aida. Into the spike, the beast sent its vision, the telltale tracings of human-woven magic. Into the spike, the demon sent its power, the strength of the underworld, the strength to burn.\\n\\n Then the beast called to its elite guards, the armored giants, and to their leader, Togul Dek.\\n\\n When the brute was before the dark master, Bestesbulzibar held forth the glowing spear.\\n\\n Togul Dek hesitated, feeling the heat, the intense magical strength.\\n\\n Bestesbulzibar thrust the nine-foot spike forward and growled a final warning, and Togul Dek, more fearful of the demon than of the fiery implement, grasped it without further hesitation, though the giant winced as his flesh touched the diabolical weapon.\\n\\n Togul Dek\u0027s expression became one of surprise, for the spike felt cool to the touch.\\n\\n \"Take ten with you,\" Bestesbulzibar commanded. \"Humans approach my throne. The spear will lead you.\"\\n\\n \"Does Bestesbulzibar who is King want any living?\" the giant asked, barking each word.\\n\\n The dactyl scoffed as if the notion were absurd, revealing that he did not think these pitiful few worthy of his time and energy.\\n\\n \"Bring me their heads,\" he instructed. \"You may eat the rest.\"\\n\\n The giant stamped one boot and spun away, collecting its ten closest allies among the elite guard and sweeping out of the throne room.\\n\\n The dactyl dismissed the remaining guards and moved back to one of the glowing lava rivers, dipping his clawed fingers into the fiery stone, feeling the power of the magic that was his alone to command, musing again about the darkness of his complete rule.\\n\\n \"How could I have been such a fool?\" Avelyn lamented, dropping his round head into his plump hands.\\n\\n \"How so?\" Pony demanded, realizing they had no time for doubts and blame. Each challenge had to be met without regret for past decisions.\\n\\n \"I should have known that the dactyl would search us, out, should have. anticipated his magical vision,\" Avelyn replied:\\n\\n \"We do not know that the dactyl has searched us out,\" Elbryan interjected. \"Perhaps the shadow at Oracle was but a warning. We have met with few enemies since our departure, only one organized group that we even know was part of the demon\u0027s army. Why should Bestesbulzibar --\"\\n\\n \"Speak not that name aloud so close to the dactyl\u0027s home!\" Avelyn warned. \"Do not even think it, if you can so discipline your thoughts!\"\\n\\n Elbryan nodded an apology to Avelyn and to all the fearful others. \"We do not know that it is too late,\" the ranger said softly.\\n\\n \"Ye put up the guard, then?\" Bradwarden asked.\\n\\n Avelyn nodded. Using the sunstone he had taken from Quintall, he had enacted a shield against divining magic. It was not a difficult enchantment, actually; and one that powerful Avelyn could maintain with the focused sunstone for h very long time without severely taxing his energies for other magics.\\n\\n It was one that Avelyn should have enacted, he now realized, even as they set out from the region of Dundalis.\\n\\n \"Stupid!\" Paulson grumbled, eyeing the monk dangerously, and then he stormed away.\\n\\n Elbryan was quick to follow, catching up to the man, grabbing him by the elbow, and leading him farther from the camp behind a shielding wall of evergreens where they could speak in private.\\n\\n \"You did not mention that we should enact such a protective shield,\" the ranger pointed out.\\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t no wizard,\" Paulson argued. \"I didn\u0027t even know about such a thing.\"\\n\\n \"Then it is good that we have Avelyn with us, who can block the demon\u0027s sight.\"\\n\\n \"If the damned demon ain\u0027t upon us even now,\" Paulson retorted, and he glanced about nervously as he spoke the grim words.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll not tolerate any placement of blame on this journey,\" Elbryan said sternly.\\n\\n Paulson stared at him long and hard, finally relenting under the ranger\u0027s unblinking stare. Instead of growing defensive, as was his nature, the big man tried hard to see things from Elbryan\u0027s perspective. Finally, he nodded. \"It\u0027s good that Avelyn is with us,\" he said sincerely.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll get there,\" Elbryan promised, and started away.\\n\\n \"Hey, ranger,\" Paulson called after Elbryan had gone a few steps. Elbryan turned to regard the man, noting his grin.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll get there; eh?\" Paulson cracked. \"Ye sure that\u0027s a good thing?\"\\n\\n \"I am sure it is not,\" Elbryan replied, matching the big man\u0027s grin.\\n\\n From the edge of a high, rocky bluff, crouched defensively behind the stone, the companions watched the latest caravan wind its way out of the Barbacan. Goblins comprised the bulk of the line, trudging with heads down, looking thoroughly miserable, especially those chained to the various powrie war engines catapults, ballistae, and great corkscrew boring machines meant to drive huge holes in castle walls.\\n\\n The caravan went on and on, exiting a pass in the dark mountain wall and forming a line that went out of the companions\u0027 sight to the east.\\n\\n \"Alpinador, too, is under siege,\" Elbryan reasoned.\\n\\n \"The dactyl will use the summer months to drive right to the coast, no doubt where more powries await his armies,\" Avelyn added, and then, considering his own words, he snorted loudly. \"Unless of course the demon\u0027s soldiers have already driven to the coast. Ho, ho, what!\"\\n\\n \"Then no time for wasting,\" remarked Bradwarden, a few feet away, behind the others on a lower point. The centaur obviously could not climb up the stone and crouch, and so he had spent the last half hour waiting rather impatiently, listening to descriptions of the exotic powrie war machines and to Paulson\u0027s unending giant count.\\n\\n \"We have to wait for Pony,\" Elbryan reminded the anxious centaur.\\n\\n \"Then wait no more,\" came a voice from ahead, and the group turned as one to see the woman moving lightly down the trail.\\n\\n \"There. are several passes that will get us through,\" she explained. \"This trail branches a quarter mile from here; the left road winds back down and out of the range, but the right climbs higher and into the mountains, which are not so deep.\"\\n\\n \"Is there cover?\" Elbryan asked.\\n\\n Pony shrugged. \"As much as we can hope for,\" she replied.\\n\\n \"Boulders line the trail on both sides, but if our enemy has guards posted in proper position, they will likely spot us.\"\\n\\n \"Then we must spot them first,\" Elbryan said determinedly, taking up Hawkwing. He sent Chipmunk off and running, flanking them to the left, bade Pony guard the right, and he, himself, moved in front of Avelyn, Paulson, and Bradwarden, taking a long lead.\\n\\n Within an hour\u0027s time, they had climbed high across the southern face of the dark mountain, to the edge of the tree line, where the wind blew chill. Elbryan, far in the lead and out of sight of the others, left markers showing his course, but even with this, the ranger was fearful that they would all get separated and lost. The Barbacan was a wild place, as untamed as any land the ranger had ever seen; a place of huge, rocky outcroppings, jagged stones, and thick copses of dark trees. It was a place where a trail ended abruptly in a hundred-foot drop, or a boulder might come suddenly down upon an unwary traveler\u0027s head. A place of the most primal danger, it was a place where the ranger felt most alive.\\n\\n A slight noise to his right put Elbryan into a crouch, his hand going from his. bow to his sword. He slipped to shelter behind a stone, then dropped flat on his belly, peeking out around the edge at a small ravine, a cut in the mountain filled with trees and brush.\\n\\n The noise came again, soft footsteps, and Elbryan followed it to its source, just a shadow moving gracefully through the tangle. He took up Hawkwing again, his eyes never leaving the target.\\n\\n And then he relaxed as the shadow moved through a clear area.\\n\\n \"Pony,\" he called softly, catching her attention. He noted the stealthy manner in which she approached, and that kept him on his guard.\\n\\n \"Goblin,\" she whispered from a short distance, not daring to cross the last clearing to come beside Elbryan, \"high and to the left beyond the twin pines and behind the jutting stone.\"\\n\\n Elbryan scanned in that direction, but had to move out from his rock even to spot the jutting stone. He nodded as the place, though not the goblin, came into view.\\n\\n \"How many?\"\\n\\n \"I saw but one,\" Pony answered. \"There could be more, further to the left and down.\"\\n\\n Elbryan glanced back along the trail. He had moved from shadow to shadow, and it was unlikely that the goblin had spotted him from that distance, but Avelyn, and particularly Bradwarden, would have trouble being inconspicuous. By the ranger\u0027s calculations, the trailing trio would soon be well within the goblin\u0027s view.\\n\\n He noted a movement up above, a dark shape coming atop the jutting rock. Torn and uncertain, the ranger fitted an arrow to Hawkwing. \"If there are more, they\u0027ll soon know of us,\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"Perhaps I can get behind the spot,\" Pony replied.\\n\\n Elbryan started to ponder that possibility, then noted the goblin\u0027s attention was occupied by something back along Elbryan\u0027s path.\\n\\n \"It knows of us,\" the ranger explained, and up came his bow. The shot was fully a hundred yards, and he had no more of a target than the goblin\u0027s head and shoulders, and in the crosswinds of a mountain face. His arrow hit the mark right down the middle, and the dark form fell away.\\n\\n There came a cry and a second shape darted out from behind the boulder, scrambling away.\\n\\n \"We are known!\" the ranger called to Pony and the pair jumped up and started in pursuit, though they had little hope of catching a creature in this wild tangle. Just a few steps away, though, they skidded to a sudden stop, seeing the goblin coming back, staggering out of a copse and across an expanse of bare rock.\\n\\n They watched curiously as the monster jerked suddenly, then fell over, and a moment later, Chipmunk appeared from the brush behind the creature, scampering up to retrieve his daggers.\\n\\n \"Well done,\" Elbryan said, though the man was far from earshot.\\n\\n \"And a good thing it is,\" Pony added.\\n\\n \"All three of us,\" the ranger instructed, \"and get Paulson as well. We must search the area to make sure that no other sentinels were nearby to witness the kills.\"\\n\\n The four did just that, circling the area and spying out the spot from every conceivable angle, looking for goblins or any signs that goblins had been about. When they were at last convinced that the kills had been unnoticed, Elbryan hustled them along, coming to a bowl-shaped depression as night descended across the wild mountains. The ranger would have liked to go farther, but they could not travel the difficult and dangerous terrain in the dark, and they certainly could light no torches.\\n\\n They set their camp with confidence that their progress had gone undetected; they could not know that a giant carried a weapon which had sensed the kills and had led its wielder right to the spot of the disposed goblin carcasses, a spot not so far from their encampment.\\n\\n The night was cool and quiet, save the moan of the wind across mountain stones. Elbryan and Pony sat close, huddled under a blanket. To the side loomed the huge shape of Bradwarden, the centaur using its bulk to shield Avelyn from the wind. Paulson and Chipmunk were out and about, guarding the perimeter.\\n\\n \"Tomorrow we climb more sheer faces,\" Elbryan said with some concern.\\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t ye worry,\" Bradwarden assured him. \"I\u0027ll find me way.\"\\n\\n \"I am more concerned with Avelyn,\" the ranger remarked. As if on cue, the snoozing monk rolled over and snored loudly. \"He is in no shape for this.\"\\n\\n \"He will make it,\" Pony said with determination. \"I have traveled with Avelyn for many months and have never known him to complain. He sees this as his destiny; he will not be denied by any mountain obstacles.\"\\n\\n Elbryan studied Avelyn for a long while, considering his own experiences with the man, and conceded the point.\\n\\n \"Besides,\" noted the centaur, \"he\u0027s getting the best of sleep.\"\\n\\n Again as if on cue, the monk shifted and snored.\\n\\n \"Chipmunk?\" Paulson whispered, his voice quickly buried under the moaning wind. \"Is that yerself?\" The big man crouched lower, peering intently at a group of trees, the source of the unmistakable sound of a footstep.\\n\\n Only then did Paulson realize that there seemed to be one extra tree in the group. \"Damnation,\" he whispered, turning to run.\\n\\n A spinning sliver, flickering in the quiet light, spun right past his head, causing him to cry out and fall away. He hit the ground, looking back toward the giant, noting its surprised, jerky movement as Chipmunk\u0027s dagger hit it squarely in the chest with a metallic ring.\\n\\n \"Come on, then!\" the big man cried, scrambling to his feet, gaining confidence in the knowledge that his trusted comrade was nearby. The ringing sound of that last impact played in his mind, though; giants were tough enough adversaries without metal armor!\\n\\n And this one was indeed armored, Paulson realized as the monster closed on him. Again came the spinning slivers, two in rapid succession, this time angled higher to hit the monster about the head. Both did, and both were repelled by a metal helm.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t stay to fight!\" Paulson called and he turned to flee, noticing then an orange glow emanating at the giant\u0027s side. Mesmerized, the big man hesitated, then he screamed out, realizing that the glow was a spear-like weapon carried by a second giant! He got his weapon up to block, but the demon-forged spike blasted right through it, right through Paulson\u0027s raised forearm, and deep into the man\u0027s belly.\\n\\n Waves of searing agony ripped through Paulson. He had never imagined the possibility of such pain. Hardly conscious, he felt himself lifted high into the air and then, with a flick of the giant\u0027s huge arms, he was flying free, launched into the night, into death.\\n\\n Chipmunk ran screaming for his life, tears of fear and horror and the loss of yet another friend streaking his cheeks. Giants were all about him. He could feel the heat of the orange glow following his path. He had to get back to the camp, and yet, he realized that to do so would put them all in jeopardy, would likely bring about the end of the quest!\\n\\n Chipmunk found a hole instead, burying himself quickly under piled leaves at the base of a thick tree. His confidence mounted as a pair of giants stomped past, oblivious of him. A third came rushing by, and then came the one carrying the glowing spike.\\n\\n That giant, too, started past, but skidded to a stop just beyond the hole, compelled by the demonic weapon.\\n\\n Chipmunk tried to cry out as his covering was pushed aside, as he looked up at the towering, fifteen-foot-tall monster, up at the huge, awful spike. He tried to cry out, but no sound would come forth, only a breathless gurgle, that ended abruptly as the monstrous spike fast descended.\\n\\n The cries of the doomed pair had alerted Elbryan and the others to the danger, so they were not unprepared when the first of the giants crashed through the brush and charged over the rim of the bowl-shaped encampment. The leading brute, apparently thinking the centaur a mere horse, tramped right by Bradwarden, who stood with head and torso bowed.\\n\\n As the giant passed, Bradwarden turned, lifting his heavy bow and letting fly. The arrow hit solidly, denting the armor plate and driving through, but not so deep as to cause any serious wound. Three quick strides later, the centaur was upon the giant, ramming hard into the behemoth\u0027s back. Bradwarden\u0027s heavy bow, swung as a club, rang off the plated armor, splintering as it hit. The giant stumbled and went down, the centaur in fast pursuit, cursing his foolishness in using the bow and reaching for his cudgel. But two more giants were close behind, following their friend in, now bearing down on Bradwarden.\\n\\n \"What does it do?\" Pony asked Avelyn as the monk held aloft a stone the woman had not seen before, a clump of black octahedral crystals.\\n\\n \"It is lodestone,\" Avelyn explained. \"Magnetite.\" He went silent then, sending his thoughts into the stone, using his magical energies to ignite those powers within the stone. The giants were bearing down on Bradwarden in a straight line; Elbryan had gone off to the side and was now calling out the presence of more of the huge fomorians.\\n\\n Pony left Avelyn\u0027s side then, rusting to join with Elbryan.\\n\\n The orange glow outlined them, three more behemoths closing in. Hawkwing went to work at once, arrow after arrow rushing down to bang hard against metal armor, into the breastplate, then repeatedly into the visor, several tips slipping through to sting the giant face, to make the monster howl in agony.\\n\\n One of the three fell back from the charge, clutching at its face, blinded by the sting.\\n\\n Elbryan dropped his bow and drew out Tempest as Pony scrambled by. He ordered her to the left, toward the giant without the glowing spike, for he sensed that the spike held some diabolical power.\\n\\n Pony readily complied, thinking that the remaining giant, smaller than the spike wielder, would be a quicker kill -- not that any giant was an easy kill! She rushed right for it, feigning a dodge to the side as it lifted its huge sword. By far the quicker, agile Pony went one step left, then back to the right, then straight ahead, under the awkward cut of the giant\u0027s weapon, falling into a headlong roll that brought her right between the monster\u0027s widespread legs.\\n\\n The giant reacted quickly, snapping straight and tall, closing its legs to entrap the foolish human.\\n\\n Pony\u0027s graphite defeated that maneuver, though, sent a crackling bolt of energy along the monster\u0027s inner thighs that left it swaying, legs widespread, as the woman worked her way out the back. Now Pony went to more conventional weaponry, drawing her sword and turning right back in on the monster, slamming the weapon hard against the giant\u0027s lower back, seeking an opening between the protective plates.\\n\\n She found none, but stayed behind the staggering brute, belting away as the giant tried to turn and grab her.\\n\\n Elbryan didn\u0027t know what to make of this armored foe, and especially of its glowing spike. Why weren\u0027t the monster\u0027s hands burning? the ranger wondered, for surely that spike was brutally hot.\\n\\n The giant stabbed straight ahead and Elbryan left those thoughts behind, suddenly more concerned with keeping his body from sporting very large holes. He went around to the side with a flourish, snapping Tempest against the pursuing spike, each hit sending a shower of orange sparks into the air.\\n\\n Elbryan knew that he had to get up higher, within striking distance of the giant\u0027s head. He knew the terrain, had marked it clearly in his thoughts before the night had fallen. He ran hard to the side, then leaped up atop a rounded boulder, gaining a foothold and turning back in a quick charge to meet the rushing monster.\\n\\n Tempest snapped in, level with the giant\u0027s eyes. Up came the spike to block, but too late, and Tempest slashed hard against the visor, twisting the giant\u0027s head from the force of the blow.\\n\\n Out came a straight thrust of the spike; Elbryan turned his hips and skittered back. The ranger leaped ahead and launched a vicious sidelong swipe as the heavy, awkward spike retracted. He connected solidly on the side of the giant\u0027s head, knocking the helm away, the behemoth staggering a long stride to the side.\\n\\n \"The next will not be so blocked!\" the ranger promised.\\n\\n The giant was not without a trick of its own, though. It came at Elbryan, but shifted as Tempest came up to parry, as Elbryan\u0027s feet turned defensively sideways, allowing the ranger to retreat back or to either side. The giant plunged the spear down low instead, right into the boulder, and Elbryan was too surprised to seize the momentary opening and charge ahead.\\n\\n He had to leap away instead, far out to the side, crashing through twigs and saplings, for the boulder superheated, turned red, and then melted away right below him!\\n\\n The ranger was dazed but knew that he had to keep moving as this pile of molten stone rolled down, igniting small, smokey fires among the twigs.\\n\\n In the sudden glow, Elbryan saw more forms moving about the perimeter, giant forms, and between the reinforcements and that terrible glowing spike, the ranger knew that he and his friends were overmatched.\\n\\n Avelyn fell deeper into the stone, felt its energy building to a critical mass. Lodestone was highly magnetic; its enchantment would send it fast to a metal surface. Impossibly fast, faster than a crossbow bolt.\\n\\n The monk fell back, nearly toppling, as the stone suddenly zipped away, flying unerringly for the armored chest of the giant closest behind Bradwarden. It hit with a tremendous, thump, jerking the behemoth from the ground, and then, to Avelyn\u0027s amazement, for he had never really used magnetite before, the second giant in line shuddered violently as well.\\n\\n Bradwarden had forced the helm off the fallen giant by then, his cudgel turning the monster\u0027s head to mush before it could rise up. The centaur heard the commotion close behind and turned to see both giants slumping to the ground, the closest showing. a neatly blasted hole right through its breastplate, right through its chest, right through its back.\\n\\n \"Oh, good shot!\" Bradwarden congratulated Avelyn.\\n\\n The monk was already running toward Bradwarden, toward the fallen giants, thinking to retrieve the stone. But then there were other giants, all about, huge shadowy forms blurring the otherwise straight line of the perimeter.\\n\\n \"On me back!\" the centaur cried.\\n\\n \"My stone!\"\\n\\n \"No time!\"\\n\\n \"Everyone out!\" came a call, Elbryan\u0027s voice. \"Avelyn with Bradwarden! Myself with Pony! Paulson with Chipmunk!\" If the two are still with us! he added silently. \"Out and away, to a direction of your own choosing!\"\\n\\n Pony could hardly believe what she was hearing, what she was seeing. They had come so far together, and now they were being forced into an impromptu, hardly organized retreat. She waited for her turning giant to align itself properly, then scrambled back between its legs once more. Again there came that nasty crackle of energy, and this time, the giant\u0027s muscles betrayed it, tensing with the current, and the brute tumbled down.\\n\\n Pony had no time to stop and take advantage of the situation, though, as she scrambled for the center of the encampment, for Avelyn and Bradwarden, hoping against hope that they might all link together once more.\\n\\n She saw the monk lying across the centaur\u0027s back, Bradwarden\u0027s powerful legs pounding away up the north face of the bowl, the same direction from which the first giants had come. They made the lip and went over, and almost immediately after, all the sky lit up with the bright flames of a tremendous fireball.\\n\\n Pony fell back, all the battle stopped for a moment, and when she caught her breath, the woman was satisfied to hear the receding hoofbeats. Avelyn and Bradwarden, at least, had gotten away.\\n\\n But how might she and Elbryan? Pony had to wonder as she skittered down the rocky slope, a pair of giants in fast pursuit. Purely on instinct, the woman dove ahead, over the giant Bradwarden had killed. She felt a rush of wind and heard a crash behind her, a giant club smashing against armor.\\n\\n Still she scrambled, expecting to be buried at any moment, expecting her life to end with a sudden, burning explosion.\\n\\n Over the next giant she went, trying to regain her footing. But she tripped and stumbled, falling atop the third dead behemoth, her hand tearing against a jagged edge in the monster\u0027s breastplate then slipping into the gore of its torn guts.\\n\\n There was fighting right behind her! She turned and saw Elbryan darting about the giant pair, Tempest working furiously. But he could not win! Even if he beat these two, others were coming fast, including the one with the glowing spike!\\n\\n Pony\u0027s hand instinctively clutched onto something hard and she retracted it to find the stone Avelyn had used. She stared at it curiously for just a moment, trying to discern its energy.\\n\\n \"Run!\" came Elbryan\u0027s cry.\\n\\n Pony looked to the fight as she rose, saw Elbryan, Hawkwing in one hand, Tempest in the other, jump out of the path of a fast descending club, then leap back suddenly as a sword swished across. Pony cried out, thinking her love cut in half, but Elbryan had been quick enough to dodge out of harm\u0027s way.\\n\\n He planted his feet as he landed and rushed straight ahead, screaming wildly, his sword flow glowing a furious bluish-white, snapping to and fro, darting straight ahead, sparking as it banged against unyielding armor.\\n\\n But the ranger\u0027s tactic worked, the sudden rush forcing the giants into a short retreat, forcing them off balance. One went down over a fallen body, reaching out as it fell to grab its companion. Another short hop and attack by Elbryan had that one tumbling, too, both landing in a tangled heap.\\n\\n The ranger had no intention of jumping atop them, not with other giants bearing in. He turned and ran as Pony ran, catching up to Pony as they scrambled together up the north slope, following the trail of their friends. Over the lip, they saw the effects of Avelyn\u0027s fireball, small fires here and there, the largest being the one still burning atop the curled and blackened corpse of yet another giant. Down the pair ran through the heat and the smoke, stumbling, but using each other for support. They heard the roars behind them, knew that to stop was to die.\\n\\n Into the night, the four survivors went, stumbling blindly, separated, two and two, with a third of their party dead. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demon-awakens-the-demonwars-saga-1/page-50.html","bookId":2167,"book":{"id":2167,"title":"The Demon Awakens (The DemonWars Saga #1)","description":"Storyline: The Demon Awakens (The DemonWars Saga #1) \\n In THE DEMON AWAKENS, bestselling author R.
