{"id":20113,"no":40,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. POOR WALKER.","content":"That famous run took place towards the end of February, at which time Hampstead was counting all the hours till he should again be allowed to show himself in Paradise Row. He had in the mean time written one little letter to the Quaker\u0027s daughter;— \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Dearest Marion,—I only write because I cannot keep myself quiet without telling you how well I love you. Pray do not believe that because I am away I think of you less. I am to see you, I hope, on Monday, the 2nd of March. If you would write me but one word to say that you will be glad to see me! \\n\\n \\n\\n Always your own, \\n\\n \\n\\n H. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n She showed this to her father, and the sly old Quaker told her that it would not be courteous in her not to send some word of reply. As the young lord, he said, had been permitted by him, her father, to pay his addresses to her, so much was due to him. Why should his girl lose this grand match? Why should his daughter not become a happy and a glorious wife, seeing that her beauty and her grace had entirely won this young lord\u0027s heart? \"My Lord,\" she wrote back to him,—\"I shall be happy to see you when you come, whatever day may suit you. But, alas! I can only say what I have said.—Yet I am thine, Marion.\" She had intended not to be tender, and yet she had thought herself bound to tell him that all that she had said before was true. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was after this that Lord Llwddythlw distinguished himself, so much so that Walker and Watson did nothing but talk about him all the next day. \"It\u0027s those quiet fellows that make the best finish after all!\" said Walker, who had managed to get altogether to the bottom of his horse during the run, and had hardly seen the end of it quite as a man wishes to see it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The day but one after this, the last Friday in February, was to be the last of Hampstead\u0027s hunting, at any rate until after his proposed visit to Holloway. He, and Lady Frances with him, intended to return to London on the next day, and then, as far as he was concerned, the future loomed before him as a great doubt. Had Marion been the highest lady in the land, and had he from his position and rank been hardly entitled to ask for her love, he could not have been more anxious, more thoughtful, or occasionally more down-hearted. But this latter feeling would give way to joy when he remembered the words with which she had declared her love. No assurance could have been more perfect, or more devoted. She had coyed him nothing as far as words are concerned, and he never for a moment doubted but that her full words had come from a full heart. \"But alas! I can only say what I have said.\" That of course had been intended to remove all hope. But if she loved him as she said she did, would he not be able to teach her that everything should be made to give way to love? It was thus that his mind was filled, as day after day he prepared himself for his hunting, and day after day did his best in keeping to the hounds. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then came that last day in February as to which all those around him expressed themselves to be full of hope. Gimberley Green was certainly the most popular meet in the country, and at Gimberley Green the hounds were to meet on this occasion. It was known that men were coming from the Pytchley and the Cottesmore, so that everybody was supposed to be anxious to do his best. Hautboy was very much on the alert, and had succeeded in borrowing for the occasion Hampstead\u0027s best horse. Even Vivian, who was not given to much outward enthusiasm, had had consultations with his groom as to which of two he had better ride first. Sometimes there does come a day on which rivalry seems to be especially keen, when a sense of striving to excel and going ahead of others seems to instigate minds which are not always ambitious. Watson and Walker were on this occasion very much exercised, and had in the sweet confidences of close friendship agreed with themselves that certain heroes who were coming from one of the neighbouring hunts should not be allowed to carry off the honours of the day. \\n\\n \\n\\n On this occasion they both breakfasted at Gorse Hall, which was not uncommon with them, as the hotel,—or pot-house, as Hautboy called it,—was hardly more than a hundred yards distant. Walker was peculiarly exuberant, and had not been long in the house before he confided to Hautboy in a whisper their joint intention that \"those fellows\" were not to be allowed to have it all their own way. \"Suppose you don\u0027t find after all, Mr. Walker,\" said Lady Amaldina, as the gentlemen got up from breakfast, and loaded themselves with sandwiches, cigar-cases, and sherry-flasks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I won\u0027t believe anything so horrible,\" said Walker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should cut the concern,\" said Watson, \"and take to stagging in Surrey.\" This was supposed to be the bitterest piece of satire that could be uttered in regard to the halcyon country in which their operations were carried on. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tolleyboy will see to that,\" said Walker. \"We haven\u0027t had a blank yet, and I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll disgrace himself on such a day as this.\" Then they all started, in great glee, on their hacks, their hunters having been already sent on to Gimberley Green. \\n\\n \\n\\n The main part of the story of that day\u0027s sport, as far as we\u0027re concerned with it, got itself told so early in the day that readers need not be kept long waiting for the details. Tolleyboy soon relieved these imperious riders from all dangers as to a blank. At the first covert drawn a fox was found immediately, and without any of those delays, so perplexing to some and so comforting to others, made away for some distant home of his own. It is, perhaps, on such occasions as these that riders are subjected to the worst perils of the hunting field. There comes a sudden rush, when men have not cooled themselves down by the process of riding here and there and going through the usual preliminary prefaces to a run. They are collected in crowds, and the horses are more impatient even than their riders. No one on that occasion could have been more impatient than Walker,—unless it was the steed upon which Walker was mounted. There was a crowd of men standing in a lane at the corner of the covert,—of men who had only that moment reached the spot,—when at about thirty yards from them a fox crossed the lane, and two or three leading hounds close at his brush. One or two of the strangers from the enemy\u0027s country occupied a position close to, or rather in the very entrance of, a little hunting gate which led out of the lane into the field opposite. Between the lane and the field there was a fence which was not \"rideable!\" As is the custom with lanes, the roadway had been so cut down that there was a bank altogether precipitous about three feet high, and on that a hedge of trees and stakes and roots which had also been cut almost into the consistency of a wall. The gate was the only place,—into which these enemies had thrust themselves, and in the possession of which they did not choose to hurry themselves, asserting as they kept their places that it would be well to give the fox a minute. The assertion in the interests of hunting might have been true. A sportsman who could at such a moment have kept his blood perfectly cool, might have remembered his duties well enough to have abstained from pressing into the field in order that the fox might have his fair chance. Hampstead, however, who was next to the enemies, was not that cool hero, and bade the strangers move on, not failing to thrust his horse against their horses. Next to him, and a little to the left, was the unfortunate Walker. To his patriotic spirit it was intolerable that any stranger should be in that field before one of their own hunt. What he himself attempted, what he wished to do, or whether any clear intention was formed in his mind, no one ever knew. But to the astonishment of all who saw it the horse got himself half-turned round towards the fence, and attempted to take it in a stand. The eager animal did get himself up amidst the thick wood on the top of the bank, and then fell headlong over, having entangled his feet among the boughs. Had his rider sat loosely he would probably have got clear of his horse. But as it was they came down together, and unfortunately the horse was uppermost. Just as it happened Lord Hampstead made his way through the gate, and was the first who dismounted to give assistance to his friend. In two or three minutes there was a crowd round, with a doctor in the midst of it, and a rumour was going about that the man had been killed. In the mean time the enemies were riding well to the hounds, with Tolleyboy but a few yards behind them, Tolleyboy having judiciously remembered a spot at which he could make his way out of the covert into field without either passing through the gate or over the fence. \\n\\n \\n\\n The reader may as well know at once that Walker was not killed. He was not killed, though he was so crushed and mauled with broken ribs and collar-bone, so knocked out of breath and stunned and mangled and squeezed, so pummelled and pounded and generally misused, that he did not come to himself for many hours, and could never after remember anything of that day\u0027s performances after eating his breakfast at Gorse Hall. It was a week before tidings went through the Shires that he was likely to live at all, and even then it was asserted that he had been so altogether smashed that he would never again use any of his limbs. On the morning after the hunt his widowed mother and only sister were down with him at the hotel, and there they remained till they were able to carry him away to his own house. \"Won\u0027t I?\" was almost the first intelligible word he said when his mother suggested to him, her only son, that now at least he would promise to abandon that desperate amusement, and would never go hunting any more. It may be said in praise of British surgery generally that Walker was out again on the first of the following November. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Walker with his misfortunes and his heroism and his recovery would have been nothing to us had it been known from the first to all the field that Walker had been the victim. The accident happened between eleven and twelve,—probably not much before twelve. But the tidings of it were sent up by telegraph from some neighbouring station to London in time to be inserted in one of the afternoon newspapers of that day; and the tidings as sent informed the public that Lord Hampstead while hunting that morning had fallen with his horse at the corner of Gimberly Green, that the animal had fallen on him,—and that he had been crushed to death. Had the false information been given in regard to Walker it might probably have excited so little attention that the world would have known nothing about it till it learned that the poor fellow had not been killed. But, having been given as to a young nobleman, everybody had heard of it before dinner-time that evening. Lord Persiflage knew it in the House of Lords, and Lord Llwddythlw had heard it in the House of Commons. There was not a club which had not declared poor Hampstead to be an excellent fellow, although he was a little mad. The Montressors had already congratulated themselves on the good fortune of little Lord Frederic; and the speedy death of the Marquis was prophesied, as men and women were quite sure that he would not be able in his present condition to bear the loss of his eldest son. The news was telegraphed down to Trafford Park by the family lawyer,—with an intimation, however, that, as the accident had been so recent, no absolute credence should yet be given as to its fatal result. \"Bad fall probably,\" said the lawyer in his telegram, \"but I don\u0027t believe the rest. Will send again when I hear the truth.\" At nine o\u0027clock that evening the truth was known in London, and before midnight the poor Marquis had been relieved from his terrible affliction. But for three hours it had been supposed at Trafford Park that Lord Frederic had become the heir to his father\u0027s title and his father\u0027s property. \\n\\n \\n\\n Close inquiry was afterwards made as to the person by whom this false intelligence had been sent to the newspaper, but nothing certain was ever asserted respecting it. That a general rumour had prevailed for a time among many who were out that Lord Hampstead had been the victim, was found to have been the case. He had been congratulated by scores of men who had heard that he had fallen. When Tolleyboy was breaking up the fox, and wondering why so few men had ridden through the hunt with him, he was told that Lord Hampstead had been killed, and had dropped his bloody knife out of his hands. But no one would own as to having sent the telegram. Suspicion attached itself to an attorney from Kettering who had been seen in the early part of the day, but it could not be traced home to him. Official inquiry was made; but as it was not known who sent the message, or to what address, or from what post town, or even the wording of the message, official information was not forthcoming. It is probable that Sir Boreas at the Post Office did not think it proper to tell everybody all that he knew. It was admitted that a great injury had been done to the poor Marquis, but it was argued on the other side that the injury had been quickly removed. \\n\\n \\n\\n There had, however, been three or four hours at Trafford Park, during which feelings had been excited which afterwards gave rise to bitter disappointment. The message had come to Mr. Greenwood, of whose estrangement from the family the London solicitor had not been as yet made aware. He had been forced to send the tidings into the sick man\u0027s room by Harris, the butler, but he had himself carried it up to the Marchioness. \"I am obliged to come,\" he said, as though apologizing when she looked at him with angry eyes because of his intrusion. \"There has been an accident.\" He was standing, as he always stood, with his hands hanging down by his side. But there was a painful look in his eyes more than she had usually read there. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What accident—what accident, Mr. Greenwood? Why do you not tell me?\" Her heart ran away at once to the little beds in which her darlings were already lying in the next room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is a telegram from London.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n From London—a telegram! Then her boys were safe. \"Why do you not tell me instead of standing there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lord Hampstead—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lord Hampstead! What has he done? Is he married?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He will never be married.\" Then she shook in every limb, and clenched her hands, and stood with open mouth, not daring to question him. \"He has had a fall, Lady Kingsbury.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A fall!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The horse has crushed him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Crushed him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I used to say it would be so, you know. And now it has come to pass.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is he—?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dead? Yes, Lady Kingsbury, he is—dead.\" Then he gave her the telegram to read. She struggled to read it, but the words were too vague; or her eyes too dim. \"Harris has gone in with the tidings. I had better read the telegram, I suppose, but I thought you\u0027d like to see it. I told you how it would be, Lady Kingsbury; and now it has come to pass.\" He stood standing a minute or two longer, but as she sat hiding her face, and unable to speak, he left the room without absolutely asking her to thank him for his news. \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as he was gone she crept slowly into the room in which her three boys were sleeping. A door from her own chamber opened into it, and then another into that in which one of the nurses slept. She leaned over them and kissed them all; but she knelt at that on which Lord Frederic lay, and woke him with her warm embraces. \"Oh, mamma, don\u0027t,\" said the boy. Then he shook himself, and sat up in his bed. \"Mamma, when is Jack coming?\" he said. Let her train them as she would, they would always ask for Jack. \"Go to sleep, my darling, my darling, my darling!\" she said, kissing him again and again. \"Trafford,\" she said, whispering to herself, as she went back to her own room, trying the sound of the title he would have to use. It had been all arranged in her own mind how it was to be, if such a thing should happen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go down,\" she said to her maid soon afterwards, \"and ask Mrs. Crawley whether his Lordship would wish to see me.\" Mrs. Crawley was the nurse. But the maid brought back word that \"My Lord\" did not wish to see \"My Lady.\" For three hours he lay stupefied in his sorrow; and for three hours she sat alone, almost in the dark. We may doubt whether it was all triumph. Her darling had got what she believed to be his due; but the memory that she had longed for it,—almost prayed for it,—must have dulled her joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was no such regret with Mr. Greenwood. It seemed to him that Fortune, Fate, Providence, or what not, had only done its duty. He believed that he had in truth foreseen and foretold the death of the pernicious young man. But would the young man\u0027s death be now of any service to him? Was it not too late? Had they not all quarrelled with him? Nevertheless he had been avenged. \\n\\n \\n\\n So it was at Trafford Park for three hours. Then there came a postboy galloping on horseback, and the truth was known. Lady Kingsbury went again to her children, but this time she did not kiss them. A gleam of glory had come there and had passed away;—but yet there was something of relief. \\n\\n \\n\\n Why had he allowed himself to be so cowed on that morning? That was Mr. Greenwood\u0027s thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n The poor Marquis fell into a slumber almost immediately, and on the next morning had almost forgotten that the first telegram had come. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2737/75390.html","bookId":1384,"book":{"id":1384,"title":"Marion Fay","description":"简介： When Mr. Lionel Trafford went into Parliament for the Borough of Wednesbury as an advanced Radical, it nearly broke the heart of his uncle, the old Marquis of Kingsbury.
