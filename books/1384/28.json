{"id":20101,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER VI. MARION\u0027S OBSTINACY.","content":"Lord Hampstead drove himself very fast from Hendon Hall to the \"Duchess of Edinburgh\" at Holloway, and then, jumping out of his trap, left it without saying a word to his servant, and walked quickly up Paradise Row till he came to No. 17. There, without pausing a moment, he knocked sharply at the door. Going on such a business as this, he did not care who saw him. There was an idea present to him that he would be doing honour to Marion Fay if he made it known to all the world of Holloway that he had come there to ask her to be his wife. It was this feeling which had made him declare his purpose to his sister, and which restrained him from any concealment as to his going and coming. \\n\\n \\n\\n Marion was standing alone in the middle of the room, with her two hands clasped together, but with a smile on her face. She had considered much as to this moment, determining even the very words that she would use. The words probably were forgotten, but the purpose was all there. He had resolved upon nothing, had considered nothing,—except that she should be made to understand that, because of his exceeding love, he required her to come to him as his wife. \"Marion,\" he said, \"Marion, you know why I am here!\" And he advanced to her, as though he would at once have taken her in his arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my lord, I know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know that I love you. I think, surely, that never love was stronger than mine. If you can love me say but the one word, and you will make me absolutely happy. To have you for my wife is all that the world can give me now. Why do you go from me? Is it to tell me that you cannot love me, Marion? Do not say that, or I think my heart will break.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She could not say that, but as he paused for her answer it was necessary that she should say something. And the first word spoken must tell the whole truth, even though it might be that the word must be repeated often before he could be got to believe that it was an earnest word. \"My lord,\" she began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I do hate that form of address. My name is John. Because of certain conventional arrangements the outside people call me Lord Hampstead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is because I can be to you no more than one of the outside people that I call you—my lord.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Marion!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only one of the outside people;—no more, though my gratitude to you, my appreciation, my friendship for you may be ever so strong. My father\u0027s daughter must be just one of the outside people to Lord Hampstead,—and no more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why so? Why do you say it? Why do you torment me? Why do you banish me at once, and tell me that I must go home a wretched, miserable man? Why?—why?—why? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because, my lord—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can give a reason,—a good reason,—a reason which I cannot oppose, though it must be fatal to me unless I can remove it; a reason to which I must succumb if necessary, but to which, Marion, I will not succumb at once. If you say that you cannot love me that will be a reason.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n If it were necessary that she should tell him a lie, she must do so. It would have been pleasant if she could have made him understand that she would be content to love him on condition that he would be content to leave her. That she should continue to love him, and that he should cease to love her,—unless, perhaps, just a little,—that had been a scheme for the future which had recommended itself to her. There should be a something left which should give a romance to her life, but which should leave him free in all things. It had been a dream, in which she had much trusted, but which, while she listened to the violence of his words, she acknowledged to herself to be almost impossible. She must tell the lie;—but at the moment it seemed to her that there might be a middle course. \"I dare not love you,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dare not love me, Marion? Who hinders you? Who tells you that you may not? Is it your father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, my lord, no.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is Mrs. Roden.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, my lord. This is a matter in which I could obey no friend, no father. I have had to ask myself, and I have told myself that I do not dare to love above my station in life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am to have that bugbear again between me and my happiness?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Between that and your immediate wishes;—yes. Is it not so in all things? If I,—even I,—had set my heart upon some one below me, would not you, as my friend, have bade me conquer the feeling?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have set my heart on one whom in the things of the world I regard as my equal,—in all other things as infinitely my superior.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The compliment is very sweet to me, but I have trained myself to resist sweetness. It may not be, Lord Hampstead. It may not be. You do not know as yet how obstinate such a girl as I may become when she has to think of another\u0027s welfare,—and a little, perhaps, of her own.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you afraid of me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That I should not love you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Even of that. When you should come to see in me that which is not lovable you would cease to love me. You would be good to me because your nature is good; kind to me because your nature is kind. You would not ill-treat me because you are gentle, noble, and forgiving. But that would not suffice for me. I should see it in your eye, despite yourself,—and hear it in your voice, even though you tried to hide it by occasional softness. I should eat my own heart when I came to see that you despised your Quaker wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All that is nonsense, Marion.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lord!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say the word at once if it has to be said,—so that I may know what it is that I have to contend with. For you my heart is so full of love that it seems to be impossible that I should live without you. If there could be any sympathy I should at once be happy. If there be none, say so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is none.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No spark of sympathy in you for me,—for one who loves you so truly?\" When the question was put to her in that guise she could not quite tell so monstrous a lie as would be needed for an answer fit for her purpose. \"This is a matter, Marion, in which a man has a right to demand an answer,—to demand a true answer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lord Hampstead, it may be that you should perplex me sorely. It may be that you should drive me away from you, and to beg you never to trouble me any further. It may be that you should force me to remain dumb before you, because that I cannot reply to you in proper words. But you will never alter my purpose. If you think well of Marion Fay, take her word when she gives it you. I can never become your lordship\u0027s wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never! Certainly never!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you told me why;—all the reason why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have told you enough, Lord Hampstead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By heavens, no! You have not answered me the one question that I have asked you. You have not given me the only reason which I would take,—even for a while. Can you love me, Marion?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you loved me you would spare me,\" she said. Then feeling that such words utterly betrayed her, she recovered herself, and went to work with what best eloquence was at her command to cheat him out of the direct answer which he required. \"I think,\" she said, \"you do not understand the workings of a girl\u0027s heart in such a matter. She does not dare to ask herself about her love, when she knows that loving would avail her nothing. For what purpose should I inquire into myself when the object of such inquiry has already been obtained? Why should I trouble myself to know whether this thing would be a gain to me or not, when I am well aware that I can never have the gain?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Marion, I think you love me.\" She looked at him and tried to smile,—tried to utter some half-joking word; and then as she felt that she could no longer repress her tears, she turned her face from him, and made no attempt at a reply. \"Marion,\" he said again, \"I think that you love me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you loved me, my lord, you would not torture me.\" She had seated herself now on the sofa, turning her face away from him over her shoulder so that she might in some degree hide her tears. He sat himself at her side, and for a moment or two got possession of her hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Marion,\" he said, pleading his case with all the strength of words which was at his command, \"you know, do you not, that no moment of life can be of more importance to me than this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it so, my lord?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"None can be so important. I am striving to get her for my companion in life, who to me is the sweetest of all human beings. To touch you as I do now is a joy to me, even though you have made my heart so sad.\" At the moment she struggled to get her hand away from him, but the struggle was not at first successful. \"You answer me with arguments which are to me of no avail at all. They are, to my thinking, simply a repetition of prejudices to which I have been all my life opposed. You will not be angry because I say so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no, my lord,\" she said; \"not angry. I am not angry, but indeed you must not hold me.\" With that she extricated her hand, which he allowed to pass from his grasp as he continued his address to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As to all that, I have my opinion and you have yours. Can it be right that you should hold to your own and sacrifice me who have thought so much of what it is I want myself,—if in truth you love me? Let your opinion stand against mine, and neutralize it. Let mine stand against yours, and in that we shall be equal. Then after that let love be lord of all. If you love me, Marion, I think that I have a right to demand that you shall be my wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was something in this which she did not know how to answer;—but she did know, she was quite sure, that no word of his, no tenderness either on his part or on her own, would induce her to yield an inch. It was her duty to sacrifice herself for him,—for reasons which were quite apparent to herself,—and she would do it. The fortress of her inner purpose was safe, although he had succeeded in breaking down the bulwark by which it had been her purpose to guard it. He had claimed her love, and she had not been strong enough to deny the claim. Let the bulwark go. She was bad at lying. Let her lie as she might, he had wit enough to see through it. She would not take the trouble to deny her love should he persist in saying that it had been accorded to him. But surely she might succeed at last in making him understand that, whether she loved him or no, she would not marry him. \"I certainly shall never be your wife,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that is all?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What more, my lord?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can let me go, and never wish me to return?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can, my lord. Your return would only be a trouble to you, and a pain to me. Another time do not turn your eyes too often on a young woman because her face may chance to please you. It is well that you should marry. Go and seek a wife, with judgment, among your own people. When you have done that, then you may return and tell Marion Fay that you have done well by following her advice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will come again, and again, and again, and I will tell Marion Fay that her counsels are unnatural and impossible. I will teach her to know that the man who loves her can seek no other wife;—that no other mode of living is possible to him than one in which he and Marion Fay shall be joined together. I think I shall persuade her at last that such is the case. I think she will come to know that all her cold prudence and worldly would-be wisdom can be of no avail to separate those who love each other. I think that when she finds that her lover so loves her that he cannot live without her, she will abandon those fears as to his future fickleness, and trust herself to one of whose truth she will have assured herself.\" Then he took her hand, and kneeling at her knee, he kissed it before she was powerful enough to withdraw it. And so he left her, without another word, and mounting on his vehicle, drove himself home without having exchanged a single word at Holloway with any one save Marion Fay. \\n\\n \\n\\n She, when she was left alone, threw herself at full length on the sofa and burst into an ecstacy of tears. Trust herself to him! Yes, indeed. She would trust herself to him entirely, only in order that she might have the joy, for one hour, of confessing her love to him openly, let the consequences to herself afterwards be what they might! As to that future injury to her pride of which she had spoken both to her father and also to her friend,—of which she had said so much to herself in discussing this matter with her own heart—as to that he had convinced her. It did not become her in any way to think of herself in this matter. He certainly would be able to twist her as he would if she could stand upon no surer rock than her fears for her own happiness. One kiss from him would be payment for it all. But all his love, all his sweetness, all his truth, all his eloquence should avail nothing with her towards overcoming that spirit of self-sacrifice by which she was dominated. Though he should extort from her all her secret, that would be her strength. Though she should have to tell him of her failing health,—her certainly failing health,—though even that should be necessary, she certainly would not be won from her purpose. It might be sweet, she thought, to make him in all respects her friend of friends; to tell him everything; to keep no fear, no doubt, no aspiration a secret from him. \"Love you, oh my dearest, thou very pearl of my heart, love you indeed! Oh, yes. Do you not know that not even for an instant could I hide my love? Are you not aware, did you not see at the moment, that when you first knelt at my feet, my heart had flown to you without an effort on my part to arrest it? But now, my beloved one, now we understand each other. Now there need be no reproaches between us. Now there need be no speaking of distrust. I am all yours,—only it is not fit, as you know, dearest, that the poor Quaker girl should become your wife. Now that we both understand that, why should we be sad? Why should we mourn?\" Why should she not succeed in bringing things to such a pass as this; and if so, why should life be unhappy either to him or to her? \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus she was thinking of it till she had almost brought herself to a state of bliss, when her father returned to her. \"Father,\" she said, getting up and embracing his arm as he stood, \"it is all over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is over?\" asked the Quaker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has been here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Marion; and what has he said?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What he said it is hardly for me to tell you. What I said,—I would you could know it all without my repeating a word of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has he gone away contented?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay, not that, father. I hardly expected that. I hardly hoped for that. Had he been quite contented perhaps I might not have been so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should you not have both been made happy?\" asked the father. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may be that we shall be so. It may be that he shall understand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thou hast not taken his offer then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no! No, father, no. I can never accept his offer. If that be in your mind put it forth. You shall never see your Marion the wife of any man, whether of that young lord or of another more fitted to her. No one ever shall be allowed to speak to me as he has spoken.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why dost thou make thyself different from other girls?\" he said, angrily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, father, father!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is romance and false sentiment, than which nothing is more odious to me. There is no reason why thou shouldst be different from others. The Lord has not marked thee out as different from other girls, either in His pleasure or His displeasure. It is wrong for thee to think it of thyself.\" She looked up piteously into his face, but said not a word. \"It is thy duty to take thyself from His hands as He has made thee; and to give way to no vain ecstatic terrors. If, as I gather from thy words, this young man be dear to thee, and if, as I gather from this second coming of his, thou art dear to him, then I as thy father tell thee that thy duty calls thee to him. It is not that he is a lord.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no, father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is not, I say, that he is a lord, or that he is rich, or that he is comely to the eyes, that I would have thee go to him as his wife. It is because thou and he love each other, as it is the ordinance of the Lord Almighty that men and women should do. Marriage is honourable, and I, thy father, would fain see thee married. I believe the young man to be good and true. I could give thee to him, lord though he be, with a trusting heart, and think that in so disposing of my child I had done well for her. Think of this, Marion, if it be not already too late.\" All this he had said standing, so that he was able to leave the room without the ceremony of rising from his chair. Without giving her a moment for reply, having his hand on the lock of the door as he uttered the last words of his counsel to her, he marched off, leaving her alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n It may be doubted whether at the moment she could have found words for reply, so full was her heart with the feelings that were crowded there. But she was well aware that all her father\u0027s words could go for nothing. Of only one thing was she sure,—that no counsel, no eloquence, no love would ever induce her to become the wife of Lord Hampstead. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2737/75378.html","bookId":1384,"book":{"id":1384,"title":"Marion Fay","description":"简介： When Mr. Lionel Trafford went into Parliament for the Borough of Wednesbury as an advanced Radical, it nearly broke the heart of his uncle, the old Marquis of Kingsbury.
