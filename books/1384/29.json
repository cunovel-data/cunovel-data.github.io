DEMIJOHN\u0027S PARTY.","content":"Mrs. Demijohn presents her compliments to Mr. Crocker, and begs the honour of his company to tea at nine o\u0027clock on Wednesday, 31st of December, to see the New Year in. \\n\\n \\n\\n R.I.V.P.(Do come, C. D.) \\n\\n \\n\\n 10, Paradise Row, Holloway. \\n\\n 29th December, 18—. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n This note was delivered to Crocker on his arrival at his office on the morning of Saturday, the 27th. \\n\\n \\n\\n It must be explained that Crocker had lately made the acquaintance of Miss Clara Demijohn without any very formal introduction. Crocker, with that determination which marked his character, in pursuit of the one present purport of his mind to effect a friendly reconciliation with George Roden, had taken himself down to Holloway, and had called at No. 11, thinking that he might induce his friend\u0027s mother to act on his behalf in a matter appertaining to peace and charity. Mrs. Roden had unhappily been from home, but he had had the good fortune to encounter Miss Demijohn. Perhaps it was that she had seen him going in and out of the house, and had associated him with the great mystery of the young nobleman; perhaps she had been simply attracted by the easy air with which he cocked his hat and swung his gloves;—or, perhaps it was simply chance. But so it was that in the gloom of the evening she met him just round the corner opposite to the \"Duchess of Edinburgh,\" and the happy acquaintance was commenced. No doubt, as in all such cases, it was the gentleman who spoke first. Let us, at any rate, hope so for the sake of Paradise Row generally. Be that as it may, before many minutes were over she had explained to him that Mrs. Roden had gone out in a cab soon after dinner, and that probably something was up at Wimbledon, as Mrs. Roden never went anywhere else, and this was not the day of the week on which her visits to Mrs. Vincent were generally made. Crocker, who was simplicity itself, soon gave her various details as to his own character and position in life. He, too, was a clerk in the Post Office, and was George Roden\u0027s particular friend. \"Oh, yes; he knew all about Lord Hampstead, and was, he might say, intimately acquainted with his lordship. He had been in the habit of meeting his lordship at Castle Hautboy, the seat of his friend, Lord Persiflage, and had often ridden with his lordship in the hunting-field. He knew all about Lady Frances and the engagement, and had had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of her ladyship. He had been corresponding lately with Lord Hampstead on the subject. No;—he had not as yet heard anything of Marion Fay, the Quaker\u0027s daughter. Then Clara had something to say on her side. She quite understood that if she expected to be communicated with, she also must communicate; and moreover, young Mr. Crocker was by his age, appearance, and sex, just such a one as prompted her to be communicative without loss of self-respect. What was the good of telling things to Mrs. Duffer, who was only an old widow without any friends, and with very small means of existence? She had communicated her secrets to Mrs. Duffer simply from want of a better pair of ears into which she could pour them. But here was one in telling secrets to whom she could take delight, and who had secrets of his own to give in return. It is not to be supposed that the friendship which arose grew from the incidents of one meeting only. On that first evening Crocker could not leave the fair one without making arrangements for a further interview, and so the matter grew. The intimacy between them was already of three days\u0027 standing when the letter of invitation above given reached Crocker\u0027s hands. To tell the very truth, the proposed party was made up chiefly for Crocker\u0027s sake. What is the good of having a young man if you cannot show him to your friends? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Crocker!\" said Mrs. Demijohn to her niece; \"where did you pick up Crocker?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What questions you do ask, aunt! Pick him up, indeed!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So you have—; picked him up, as you\u0027re always a doing with young men. Only you never know how to keep \u0027em when you\u0027ve got \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I declare, aunt, your vulgarity is unbearable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to have any Crocker in my house,\" said the old woman, \"unless I know where he comes from. Perhaps he\u0027s a counter-skipper. He may be a ticket-of-leave man for all you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aunt Jemima, you\u0027re so provoking that I sometimes think I shall have to leave you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where will you go to, my dear?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To this question, which had often been asked before, Clara thought it unnecessary to make any answer; but returned at once to the inquiries which were not unnaturally made by the lady who stood to her in the place of a mother. \"Mr. Crocker, Aunt Jemima, is a clerk in the Post Office, who sits at the same desk with George Roden, and is intimately acquainted both with Lord Hampstead and with Lady Frances Trafford. He used to be George Roden\u0027s bosom friend; but there has lately been some little tiff between the young men, which would be so pleasant if we could make it up. You have got to a speaking acquaintance with Mrs. Roden, and perhaps if you will ask them they\u0027ll come. I am sure Marion Fay will come, because you always get your money from Pogson and Littlebird. I wish I had the cheek to ask Lord Hampstead.\" Having heard all this, the old lady consented to receive our sporting friend from the Post Office, and also assented to the other invitations, which were given. \\n\\n \\n\\n Crocker, of course, sent his compliments, and expressed the great pleasure he would have in \"seeing the New Year in\" in company with Mrs. Demijohn. As the old lady was much afflicted with rheumatism, the proposition as coming from her would have been indiscreet had she not known that her niece on such occasions was well able to act as her deputy. Mrs. Roden also promised to come, and with difficulty persuaded her son that it would be gracious on his part to be so far civil to his neighbours. Had he known that Crocker also would be there he certainly would not have yielded; but Crocker, when at the office, kept the secret of his engagement to himself. The Quaker also and Marion Fay were to be there. Mr. Fay and Mrs. Demijohn had long known each other in regard to matters of business, and he, for the sake of Messrs. Pogson and Littlebird\u0027s firm, could not refuse to drink a cup of tea at their client\u0027s house. A junior clerk from the same counting-house, one Daniel Tribbledale by name, with whom Clara had made acquaintance at King\u0027s Court some two years since, was also to be of the party. Mr. Tribbledale had at one time, among all Clara\u0027s young men, been the favourite. But circumstances had occurred which had somewhat lessened her goodwill towards him. Mr. Littlebird had quarrelled with him, and he had been refused promotion. It was generally supposed at the present time in the neighbourhood of Old Broad Street that Daniel Tribbledale was languishing for the love of Clara Demijohn. Mrs. Duffer, of course, was to be there, and so the list of friends for the festive occasion was completed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Duffer was the first to come. Her aid, indeed, was required for the cutting up of the cakes and arrangements of the cups and saucers. The Quaker and his daughter were next, appearing exactly at nine o\u0027clock,—to do which he protested to be the best sign of good manners that could be shown. \"If they want me at ten, why do they ask me at nine?\" demanded the Quaker. Marion was forced to give way, though she was by no means anxious to spend a long evening in company with Mrs. Demijohn. As to that seeing of the New Year in, it was quite out of the question for the Quaker or for his daughter. The company altogether came early. The only touch of fashion evinced on this occasion was shown by Mr. Crocker. The Rodens, with Mr. Tribbledale at their heels, appeared not long after Mr. Fay, and then the demolition of the Sally Lunns was commenced. \"I declare I think he means to deceive us,\" whispered Clara to her friend, Mrs. Duffer, when all the good tea had been consumed before the young man appeared. \"I don\u0027t suppose he cares much for tea,\" said Mrs. Duffer; \"they don\u0027t now-a-days.\" \"It isn\u0027t just for the tea that a man is expected to come,\" said Clara, indignantly. It was now nearly ten, and she could not but feel that the evening was going heavily. Tribbledale had said one tender word to her; but she had snubbed him, expecting Crocker to be there almost at once, and he had retired silent into a corner. George Roden had altogether declined to make himself agreeable—to her; but as he was an engaged man, and engaged to a lady of rank, much could not be expected of him. Mrs. Roden and the Quaker and Mrs. Demijohn did manage to keep up something of conversation. Roden from time to time said a few words to Marion. Clara, who was repenting herself of her hardness to young Tribbledale, was forced to put up with Mrs. Duffer. When suddenly there came a thundering knock at the door, and Mr. Crocker was announced by the maid, who had been duly instructed beforehand as to all peculiarities in the names of the guests. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a little stir, as there always is when a solitary guest comes in much after the appointed time. Of course there was rebuke,—suppressed rebuke from Mrs. Demijohn, mild rebuke from Mrs. Duffer, a very outburst of rebuke from Clara. But Crocker was up to the occasion. \"Upon my word, ladies, I had no help for it. I was dining with a few friends in the City, and I couldn\u0027t get away earlier. If my own ideas of happiness had been consulted I should have been here an hour ago. Ah, Roden, how are you? Though I know you live in the same street, I didn\u0027t think of meeting you.\" Roden gave him a nod, but did not vouchsafe him a word. \"How\u0027s his lordship? I told you, didn\u0027t I, that I had heard from him the other day?\" Crocker had mentioned more than once at his office the fact that he had received a letter from Lord Hampstead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t often see him, and very rarely hear from him,\" said Roden, without turning away from Marion to whom he was at the moment speaking. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If all our young noblemen were like Hampstead,\" said Crocker, who had told the truth in declaring that he had been dining, \"England would be a very different sort of place from what it is. The most affable young lord that ever sat in the House of Peers.\" Then he turned himself towards Marion Fay, at whose identity he made a guess. He was anxious at once to claim her as a mutual friend, as connected with himself by her connection with the lord in question. But as he could find no immediate excuse for introducing himself, he only winked at her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you acquainted with Mr. Tribbledale, Mr. Crocker?\" asked Clara. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never had the pleasure as yet,\" said Crocker. Then the introduction was effected. \"In the Civil Service?\" asked Crocker. Tribbledale blushed, and of necessity repudiated the honour. \"I thought, perhaps, you were in the Customs. You have something of the H.M.S. cut about you.\" Tribbledale acknowledged the compliment with a bow. \"I think the Service is the best thing a man can do with himself,\" continued Crocker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is genteel,\" said Mrs. Duffer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And the hours so pleasant,\" said Clara. \"Bank clerks have always to be there by nine.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is a young man to be afraid of that?\" asked the Quaker, indignantly. \"Ten till four, with one hour for the newspapers and another for lunch. See the consequence. I never knew a young man yet from a public office who understood the meaning of a day\u0027s work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think that is a little hard,\" said Roden. \"If a man really works, six hours continuously is as much as he can do with any good to his employers or himself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well done, Roden,\" said Crocker. \"Stick up for Her Majesty\u0027s shop.\" Roden turned himself more round than before, and continued to address himself to Marion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Our employers wouldn\u0027t think much of us,\" said the Quaker, \"if we didn\u0027t do better for them than that in private offices. I say that the Civil Service destroys a young man, and teaches him to think that the bread of idleness is sweet. As far as I can see, nothing is so destructive of individual energy as what is called public money. If Daniel Tribbledale would bestir himself he might do very well in the world without envying any young man his seat either at the Custom House or the Post Office.\" Mr. Fay had spoken so seriously that they all declined to carry that subject further. Mrs. Demijohn and Mrs. Duffer murmured their agreement, thinking it civil to do so, as the Quaker was a guest. Tribbledale sat silent in his corner, awestruck at the idea of having given rise to the conversation. Crocker winked at Mrs. Demijohn, and thrust his hands into his pockets as much as to say that he could get the better of the Quaker altogether if he chose to exercise his powers of wit and argument. \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon after this Mr. Fay rose to take his daughter away. \"But,\" said Clara, with affected indignation, \"you are to see the Old Year out and the New Year in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have seen enough of the one,\" said Mr. Fay, \"and shall see enough of the other if I live to be as near its close as I am to its birth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But there are refreshments coming up,\" said Mrs. Demijohn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have refreshed myself sufficiently with thy tea, madam. I rarely take anything stronger before retiring to my rest. Come, Marion, thou requirest to be at no form of welcoming the New Year. Thou, too, wilt be better in thy bed, as thy duties call upon thee to be early.\" So saying, the Quaker bowed formally to each person present, and took his daughter out with him under his arm. Mrs. Roden and her son escaped almost at the same moment, and Mrs. Demijohn, having waited to take what she called just a thimbleful of hot toddy, went also to her rest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here\u0027s a pretty way of seeing the New Year in,\" said Clara, laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are quite enough of us for the purpose,\" said Crocker, \"unless we also are expected to go away.\" But as he spoke he mixed a tumbler of brandy and water, which he divided among two smaller glasses, handing them to the two ladies present. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I declare,\" said Mrs. Duffer, \"I never do anything of the kind,—almost never.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On such an occasion as this everybody does it,\" said Crocker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope Mr. Tribbledale will join us,\" said Clara. Then the bashful clerk came out of his corner, and seating himself at the table prepared to do as he was bid. He made his toddy very weak, not because he disliked brandy, but guided by an innate spirit of modesty which prevented him always from going more than halfway when he was in company. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the evening became very pleasant. \"You are quite sure that he is really engaged to her ladyship?\" asked Clara. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish I were as certainly engaged to you,\" replied the polite Crocker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What nonsense you do talk, Mr. Crocker;—and before other people too. But you think he is?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am sure of it. Both Hampstead and she have told me so much themselves out of their own mouths.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My!\" exclaimed Mrs. Duffer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And here\u0027s her brother engaged to Marion Fay,\" said Clara. Crocker declared that as to this he was by no means so well assured. Lord Hampstead in spite of their intimacy had told him nothing about it. \"But it is so, Mr. Crocker, as sure as ever you are sitting there. He has been coming here after her over and over again, and was closeted with her only last Friday for hours. It was a holiday, but that sly old Quaker went out of the way, so as to leave them together. That Mrs. Roden, though she\u0027s as stiff as buckram, knows all about it. To the best of my belief she got it all up. Marion Fay is with her every day. It\u0027s my belief there\u0027s something we don\u0027t understand yet. She\u0027s got a hold of them young people, and means to do just what she likes with \u0027em.\" Crocker, however, could not agree to this. He had heard of Lord Hampstead\u0027s peculiar politics, and was assured that the young lord was only carrying out his peculiar principles in selecting Marion Fay for himself and devoting his sister to George Roden. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not that I like that kind of thing, if you ask me,\" said Crocker. \"I\u0027m very fond of Hampstead, and I\u0027ve always found Lady Frances to be a pleasant and affable lady. I\u0027ve no cause to speak other than civil of both of them. But when a man has been born a lord, and a lady a lady—. A lady of that kind, Miss Demijohn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, exactly;—titled you mean, Mr. Crocker?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quite high among the nobs, you know. Hampstead will be a Marquis some of these days, which is next to a Duke.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And do you know him,—yourself?\" asked Tribbledale with a voice of awe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" said Crocker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To speak to him when you see him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I had a long correspondence with him about a week ago about a matter which interested both of us very much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And how does he address you?\" asked Clara,—also with something of awe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Dear Crocker;\u0027—just that. I always say \u0027My dear Lord Hampstead,\u0027 in return. I look upon \u0027Dear Hampstead,\u0027 as a little vulgar, you know, and I always think that one ought to be particular in these matters. But, as I was saying, when it comes to marriage, people ought to be true to themselves. Now if I was a Marquis,—I don\u0027t know what I mightn\u0027t do if I saw you, you know, Clara.\" \"Clara\" pouted, but did not appear to have been offended either by the compliment or by the familiarity. \"But under any other circumstances less forcible I would stick to my order.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So would I,\" said Mrs. Duffer. \"Marquises ought to marry marquises, and dukes dukes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There it is!\" said Clara, \"and now we must drink its health, and I hope we may be all married to them we like best before it comes round again.\" This had reference to the little clock on the mantelpiece, the hands of which had just crept round to twelve o\u0027clock. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish we might,\" said Crocker, \"and have a baby in the cradle too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go away,\" said Clara. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That would be quick,\" said Mrs. Duffer. \"What do you say, Mr. Tribbledale?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where my heart\u0027s fixed,\" said Tribbledale, who was just becoming warm with the brandy-and-water, \"there ain\u0027t no hope for this year, nor yet for the one after.\" Whereupon Crocker remarked that \"care killed a cat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You just put on your coat and hat, and take me across to my lodgings. See if I don\u0027t give you a chance,\" said Mrs. Duffer, who was also becoming somewhat merry under the influences of the moment. But she knew that it was her duty to do something for her young hostess, and, true woman as she was, thought that this was the best way of doing it. Tribbledale did as he was bid, though he was obliged thus to leave his lady-love and her new admirer together. \"Do you really mean it?\" said Clara, when she and Crocker were alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I do,—honest,\" said Crocker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you may,\" said Clara, turning her face to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2737/75379.html","bookId":1384,"book":{"id":1384,"title":"Marion Fay","description":"简介： When Mr. Lionel Trafford went into Parliament for the Borough of Wednesbury as an advanced Radical, it nearly broke the heart of his uncle, the old Marquis of Kingsbury.
