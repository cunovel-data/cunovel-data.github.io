{"id":20117,"no":44,"title":"VOL. III. CHAPTER I. \"I WILL COME BACK AS I WENT.\"","content":"While Lord Hampstead\u0027s party were at Gorse Hall, some weeks before poor Walker\u0027s accident, there came a letter from George Roden to Lady Frances, and she, when she reached Hendon Hall, found a second. Both these letters, or parts of them, shall be here given, as they will tell all that need be added to what is already known of the story of the man, and will explain to the reader the cause and manner of action which he adopted. Rome, January 30th, 18—. Dearest Fanny,— I wonder whether it will seem as odd to you to receive a letter from me written at Rome as it is to me to write it. Our letters hitherto have been very few in number, and have only declared that in spite of obstacles we shall always love each other. I have never before had anything in truth to tell you; but now I have so much that I do not know how to begin or how to go on with it. But it must be written, as there is much that will interest you as my dearest friend, and much also that will concern yourself should you ever become my wife. It may be that a point will arise as to which you and your friends,—your father, for instance, and your brother,—will feel yourselves entitled to have a voice in deciding. It may be quite possible that your judgment, or, at any rate, that of your friends, may differ from my own. Should it be so I cannot say that I shall be prepared to yield; but I will, at any rate, enable you to submit the case to them with all fairness. I have told you more than once how little I have known of my own family,—that I have known indeed nothing. My mother has seemed to me to be perversely determined not to tell me all that which I will acknowledge I have thought that I ought to know. But with equal perversity I have refrained from asking questions on a subject of which I think I should have been told everything without questioning. And I am a man not curious by nature as to the past. I am more anxious as to what I may do myself than as to what others of my family may have done before me. When, however, my mother asked me to go with her to Italy, it was manifest that her journey had reference to her former life. I knew from circumstances which could not be hidden from me,—from her knowledge, for instance, of Italian, and from some relics which remained to her of her former life,—that she had lived for some period in this country. As my place of birth had never been mentioned to me, I could not but guess that I had been born in Italy, and when I found that I was going there I felt certain that I must learn some portion of the story of which I had been kept in ignorance. Now I have learnt it all as far as my poor mother knows it herself; and as it will concern you to know it too, I must endeavour to explain to you all the details. Dearest Fanny, I do trust that when you have heard them you will think neither worse of me on that account,—nor better. It is as to the latter that I am really in fear. I wish to believe that no chance attribute could make me stand higher in your esteem than I have come to stand already by my own personal character. Then he told her,—not, perhaps, quite so fully as the reader has heard it told in the last chapter,—the story of his mother\u0027s marriage and of his own birth. Before they had reached Rome, where the Duca di Crinola at present lived, and where he was at present a member of the Italian Cabinet, the mother had told her son all that she knew, having throughout the telling of the story unconsciously manifested to him her own desire to remain in obscurity, and to bear the name which had been hers for five-and-twenty years; but at the same time so to manage that he should return to England bearing the title to which by his birth she believed him to be entitled. When in discussing this he explained to her that it would be still necessary for him to earn his bread as a clerk in the Post Office in spite of his high-sounding nobility, and explained to her the absurdity of his sitting in Mr. Jerningham\u0027s room at the desk with young Crocker, and calling himself at the same time the Duca di Crinola, she in her arguments exhibited a weakness which he had hardly expected from her. She spoke vaguely, but with an assurance of personal hope, of Lady Frances, of Lord Hampstead, of the Marquis of Kingsbury, and of Lord Persiflage,—as though by the means of these noble personages the Duca di Crinola might be able to live in idleness. Of all this Roden could say nothing in this first letter to Lady Frances. But it was to this that he alluded when he hoped that she would not think better of him because of the news which he sent her. \"At present,\" he wrote, continuing his letter after the telling of the story, we are staying with my uncle, as I presume I am entitled to call him. He is very gracious, as also are his wife and the young ladies who are my cousins; but I think that he is as anxious as I am that there should be no acknowledged branch of the family senior to his own. He is Duca di Crinola to all Italy, and will remain so whether I assume the title or not. Were I to take the name, and to remain in Italy,—which is altogether impossible,—I should be nobody. He who has made for himself a great position, and apparently has ample means, would not in truth be affected. But I am sure that he would not wish it. He is actuated by a sense of honesty, but he certainly has no desire to be incommoded by relatives who would, as regards the family, claim to be superior to himself. My dearest mother wishes to behave well to him, wishes to sacrifice herself; but is, I fear, above all things, anxious to procure for her son the name and title which his father bore. As for myself, you will, I think, already have perceived that it is my desire to remain as I was when last I saw you, and to be as ever Yours, most affectionately, George Roden. Lady Frances was, as may be imagined, much startled at the receipt of this letter;—startled, and also pleased. Though she had always declared to herself that she was in every respect satisfied with her lover from the Post Office, though she had been sure that she had never wanted him to be other than he was, still, when she heard of that fine-sounding name, there did for a moment come upon her an idea that, for his sake, it might be well that he should have the possession of all that his birth had done for him. But when she came to understand the meaning of his words, as she did on the second or third reading of his letter,—when she discovered what he meant by saying that he hoped she would not think better of him by reason of what he was telling her, when she understood the purport of the manner in which he signed his name, she resolved that in every respect she would think as he thought and act as he wished her to act. Whatever might be the name which he might be pleased to give her, with that would she be contented, nor would she be led by any one belonging to her to ask him to change his purpose. For two days she kept the letter by her unanswered, and without speaking of it to anybody. Then she showed it to her brother, exacting from him a promise that he should not speak of it to any one without her permission. \"It is George\u0027s secret,\" she said, \"and I am sure you will see that I have no right to disclose it. I tell you because he would do so if he were here.\" Her brother was willing enough to make the promise, which would of course be in force only till he and Roden should see each other; but he could not be brought to agree with his sister as to his friend\u0027s view of the position. \"He may have what fancies he pleases about titles,\" he said, \"as may I; but I do not think that he would be justified in repudiating his father\u0027s name. I feel it a burden and an absurdity to be born to be an earl and a marquis, but I have to put up with it; and, though my reason and political feeling on the matter tell me that it is a burden and an absurdity, yet the burden is easily borne, and the absurdity does not annoy me much. There is a gratification in being honoured by those around you, though your conscience may be twinged that you yourself have done nothing to deserve it. It will be so with him if he takes his position here as an Italian nobleman.\" \"But he would still have to be a clerk in the Post Office.\" \"Probably not.\" \"But how would he live?\" asked Lady Frances. \"The governor, you would find, would look upon him in a much more favourable light than he does at present.\" \"That would be most unreasonable.\" \"Not at all. It is not unreasonable that a Marquis of Kingsbury should be unwilling to give his daughter to George Roden, a clerk in the Post Office,—but that he should be willing to give her to a Duca di Crinola.\" \"What has that to do with earning money?\" \"The Governor would probably find an income in one case, and not in the other. I do not quite say that it ought to be so, but it is not unreasonable that it should be so.\" Then Lady Frances said a great deal as to that pride in her lover which would not allow him to accept such a position as that which was now suggested. There was a long discussion on the subject. Her brother explained to her how common it was for noblemen of high birth to live on means provided by their wives\u0027 fortunes, and how uncommon it was that men born to high titles should consent to serve as clerks in a public office. But his common sense had no effect upon his sister, who ended the conversation by exacting from him a renewed assurance of secrecy. \"I won\u0027t say a word till he comes,\" said Hampstead; \"but you may be sure that a story like that will be all over London before he does come.\" Lady Frances of course answered her lover\u0027s letter; but of what she said it is only necessary that the reader should know that she promised that in all things she would be entirely guided by his wishes. Then came his second letter to her, dated on the day on which poor Walker had nearly been crushed to death. \"I am so glad that you agree with me,\" he wrote. Since my last letter to you everything here has been decided as far as I can decide it,—or, indeed, as far as any of us can do so. There can, I think, be no doubt as to the legality of my mother\u0027s marriage. My uncle is of the same opinion, and points out to me that were I to claim my father\u0027s name no one would attempt to dispute it. He alone could do so,—or rather would be the person to do so if it were done. He would make no such attempt, and would himself present me to the King here as the Duca di Crinola if I chose to remain and to accept the position. But I certainly will not do so. I should in the first place be obliged to give up my nationality. I could not live in England bearing an Italian title, except as an Italian. I do not know that as an Italian I should be forced to give up my place in the Post Office. Foreigners, I believe, are employed in the Civil Service. But there would be an absurdity in it which to me would be specially annoying. I could not live under such a weight of ridicule. Nor could I live in any position in which some meagre income might be found for me because of my nobility. No such income would be forthcoming here. I can imagine that your father might make a provision for a poor son-in-law with a grand title. He ought not to do so, according to my ideas, but it might be possible that he should find himself persuaded to such weakness. But I could not accept it. I should not be above taking money with my wife, if it happened to come in my way, provided that I were earning an income myself to the best of my ability. For her sake I should do what might be best for her. But not even for your sake,—if you wished it, as I know you do not,—could I consent to hang about the world in idleness as an Italian duke without a shilling of my own. Therefore, my darling, I purpose to come back as I went, Your own, George Roden. Clerk in the Post Office, and entitled to consider myself as being on \"H.M.S.\" when at work from ten till four. This letter reached Lady Frances at Hendon Hall on the return of herself and her brother from Gorse Hall. But before that time the prophecy uttered by Lord Hampstead as to the story being all over London had already been in part fulfilled. Vivian during their hunting weeks at Gorse Hall had been running continually up and down from London, where his work as private secretary to the Secretary of State had been, of course, most constant and important. He had, nevertheless, managed to have three days a week in Northamptonshire, explaining to his friends in London that he did it by sitting up all night in the country, to his friends in the country that he sat up all night in town. There are some achievements which are never done in the presence of those who hear of them. Catching salmon is one, and working all night is another. Vivian, however, managed to do what was required of him, and to enjoy his hunting at the same time. On his arrival at Gorse Hall the day before the famous accident he had a budget of news of which he was very full, but of which he at first spoke only to Hampstead. He could not, at any rate, speak of it in the presence of Lady Frances. \"You have heard this, haven\u0027t you, about George Roden?\" he asked, as soon as he could get Lord Hampstead to himself. \"Heard what about George Roden?\" asked the other, who, of course, had heard it all. \"The Italian title.\" \"What about an Italian title?\" \"But have you heard it?\" \"I have heard something. What have you heard?\" \"George Roden is in Italy.\" \"Unless he has left it. He has been there, no doubt.\" \"And his mother.\" Hampstead nodded his head. \"I suppose you do know all about it?\" \"I want to know what you know. What I have heard has come to me as a secret. Your story can probably be divulged.\" \"I don\u0027t know that. We are apt to be pretty close as to what we hear at the Foreign Office. But this didn\u0027t come as specially private. I\u0027ve had a letter from Muscati, a very good fellow in the Foreign Office there, who had in some way heard your name as connected with Roden.\" \"That is very likely.\" \"And your sister\u0027s,\" said Vivian in a whisper. \"That is likely too. Men talk about anything now-a-days.\" \"Lord Persiflage has heard direct from Italy. He is interested, of course, as being brother-in-law to Lady Kingsbury.\" \"But what have they heard?\" \"It seems that Roden isn\u0027t an Englishman at all.\" \"That will be as he likes, I take it. He has lived here as an Englishman for five-and-twenty years.\" \"But of course he\u0027ll prefer to be an Italian,\" said Vivian. \"It turns out that he is heir to one of the oldest titles in Italy. You have heard of the Ducas di Crinola?\" \"I have heard of them now.\" \"One of them is Minister of Education in the present Cabinet, and is likely to be the Premier. But he isn\u0027t the head of the family, and he isn\u0027t really the Duca di Crinola. He is called so, of course. But he isn\u0027t the head of the family. George Roden is the real Duca di Crinola. I thought there must be something special about the man when your sister took such a fancy to him.\" \"I always thought there was something special about him,\" said Hampstead; \"otherwise I should hardly have liked him so well.\" \"So did I. He always seemed to be,—to me,—just one of ourselves, you know. A fellow doesn\u0027t come out like that unless he\u0027s somebody. You Radicals may say what you please, but silk purses don\u0027t get made out of sow\u0027s ears. Nobody stands up for blood less than I do; but, by George, it always shows itself. You wouldn\u0027t think Crocker was heir to a dukedom.\" \"Upon my word, I don\u0027t know. I have a great respect for Crocker.\" \"And now what\u0027s to be done?\" asked Vivian. \"How done?\" \"About Di Crinola? Lord Persiflage says that he can\u0027t remain in the Post Office.\" \"Why not?\" \"I\u0027m afraid he doesn\u0027t come in for much?\" \"Not a shilling.\" \"Lord Persiflage thinks that something should be done for him. But it is so hard. It should be done in Italy, you know. I should think that they might make him extra Secretary of Legation, so as to leave him here. But then they have such a small salary!\" As the story of George Roden\u0027s birth was thus known to all the Foreign Office, it was probable that Hampstead\u0027s prophecy would be altogether fulfilled.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2737/75394.html","bookId":1384,"book":{"id":1384,"title":"Marion Fay","description":"简介： When Mr. Lionel Trafford went into Parliament for the Borough of Wednesbury as an advanced Radical, it nearly broke the heart of his uncle, the old Marquis of Kingsbury.
