{"id":20134,"no":61,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. CROCKER\u0027S TALE.","content":"A thing difficult to get is the thing mostly prized, not the thing that is valuable. Two or three additional Kimberley mines found somewhere among the otherwise uninteresting plains of South Africa would bring down the price of diamonds amazingly. It could hardly have been the beauty, or the wit, or the accomplishments of Clara Demijohn which caused Mr. Tribbledale to triumph so loudly and with so genuine an exultation, telling all Broad Street of his success, when he had succeeded in winning the bride who had once promised herself to Crocker. Were it not that she had all but slipped through his fingers he would never surely have thought her to be worthy of such a p?an. Had she come to his first whistle he might have been contented enough,—as are other ordinary young men with their ordinary young women. He would probably have risen to no enthusiasm of passion. But as things had gone he was as another Paris who had torn a Helen from her Menelaus,—only in this case an honest Paris, with a correct Helen, and from a Menelaus who had not as yet made good his claim. But the subject was worthy of another Iliad, to be followed by another ?neid. By his bow and his spear he had torn her from the arms of a usurping lover, and now made her all his own. Another man would have fainted and abandoned the contest, when rejected as he had been. But he had continued the fight, even when lying low on the dust of the arena. He had nailed his flag to the mast when all his rigging had been cut away;—and at last he had won the battle. Of course his Clara was doubly dear to him, having been made his own after such difficulties as these. \"I\u0027m not one of those who easily give way in an affair of the heart,\" he said to Mr. Littlebird, the junior partner in the firm, when he told that gentleman of his engagement. \"So I perceive, Mr. Tribbledale.\" \"When a man has set his affection on a young lady,—that is, his real affection,—he ought to stick to it,—or die.\" Mr. Littlebird, who was the happy father of three or four married and marriageable daughters, opened his eyes with surprise. The young men who had come after his young ladies had been pressing enough, but they had not died. \"Or die!\" repeated Tribbledale. \"It is what I should have done. Had she become Mrs. Crocker, I should never again have been seen in the Court,\"—\"the Court\" was the little alley in which Pogson and Littlebird\u0027s office was held,—\"unless they had brought my dead body here to be identified.\" He was quite successful in his enthusiasm. Though Mr. Littlebird laughed when he told the story to Mr. Pogson, not the less did they agree to raise his salary to ￡160 on and from the day of his marriage. \"Yes, Mr. Fay,\" he said to the poor old Quaker, who had lately been so broken by his sorrow as hardly to be as much master of Tribbledale as he used to be, \"I have no doubt I shall be steady now. If anything can make a young man steady it is—success in love.\" \"I hope thou wilt be happy, Mr. Tribbledale.\" \"I shall be happy enough now. My heart will be more in the business,—what there isn\u0027t of it at any rate with that dear creature in our mutual home at Islington. It was lucky about his having taken those lodgings, because Clara had got as it were used to them. And there are one or two things, such as a clock and the like, which need not be moved. If anything ever should happen to you, Mr. Fay, Pogson and Littlebird will find me quite up to the business.\" \"Something will happen some day, no doubt,\" said the Quaker. On one occasion Lord Hampstead was in the Court having a word to say to Marion\u0027s father, or, perhaps, a word to hear. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll excuse me, my lord,\" said Tribbledale, following him out of the office. \"Oh, yes,\" said Hampstead, with a smile,—for he had been there often enough to have made some acquaintance with the junior clerk. \"If there be anything I can do for you, I will do it willingly.\" \"Only just to congratulate me, my lord. You have heard of—Crocker?\" Lord Hampstead owned that he had heard of Crocker. \"He has been interfering with me in the tenderest of parts.\" Lord Hampstead looked serious. \"There is a young woman\"—the poor victim frowned, he knew not why; but remitted his frown and smiled again; \"who had promised herself to me. Then that rude assailant came and upset all my joy.\" Here, as the narrator paused, Lord Hampstead owned to himself that he could not deny the truth of the description. \"Perhaps,\" continued Tribbledale,—\"perhaps you have seen Clara Demijohn.\" Lord Hampstead could not remember having been so fortunate. \"Because I am aware that your steps have wandered in the way of Paradise Row.\" Then there came the frown again,—and then the smile. \"Well;—perhaps it may be that a more perfect form of feminine beauty may be ascribed to another.\" This was intended as a compliment, more civil than true, paid to Marion Fay on Lord Hampstead\u0027s behalf. \"But for a combination of chastity and tenderness I don\u0027t think you can easily beat Clara Demijohn.\" Lord Hampstead bowed, as showing his readiness to believe such a statement coming from so good a judge. \"For awhile the interloper prevailed. Interlopers do prevail;—such is the female heart. But the true rock shows itself always at last. She is the true rock on which I have built the castle of my happiness.\" \"Then I may congratulate you, Mr. Tribbledale.\" \"Yes;—and not only that, my lord. But Crocker is nowhere. You must own that there is a triumph in that. There was a time! Oh! how I felt it. There was a time when he triumphed; when he talked of \u0027my Clara,\u0027 as though I hadn\u0027t a chance. He\u0027s up a tree now, my lord. I thought I\u0027d just tell you as you are so friendly, coming among us, here, my lord!\" Lord Hampstead again congratulated him, and expressed a hope that he might be allowed to send the bride a small present. \"Oh, my lord,\" said Tribbledale, \"it shall go with the clock and the harmonium, and shall be the proudest moment of my life.\" When Miss Demijohn heard that the salary of Pogson and Littlebird\u0027s clerk,—she called it \"Dan\u0027s screw\" in speaking of the matter to her aunt,—had been raised to ￡160 per annum, she felt that there could be no excuse for a further change. Up to that moment it had seemed to her that Tribbledale had obtained his triumph by a deceit which it still might be her duty to frustrate. He had declared positively that those fatal words had been actually written in the book, \"Dismissal—B. B.\" But she had learned that the words had not been written as yet. All is fair in love and war. She was not in the least angry with Tribbledale because of his little ruse. A lie told in such a cause was a merit. But not on that account need she be led away by it from her own most advantageous course. In spite of the little quarrel which had sprung up between herself and Crocker, Crocker, still belonging to Her Majesty\u0027s Civil Service, must be better than Tribbledale. But when she found that Tribbledale\u0027s statement as to the ￡160 was true, and when she bethought herself that Crocker would probably be dismissed sooner or later, then she determined to be firm. As to the ￡160, old Mrs. Demijohn herself went to the office, and learned the truth from Zachary Fay. \"I think he is a good young man,\" said the Quaker, \"and he will do very well if he will cease to think quite so much of himself.\" To this Mrs. Demijohn remarked that half-a-dozen babies might probably cure that fault. So the matter was settled, and it came to pass that Daniel Tribbledale and Clara Demijohn were married at Holloway on that very Thursday which saw completed the alliance which had been so long arranged between the noble houses of Powell and De Hauteville. There were two letters written on the occasion which shall be given here as showing the willingness to forget and forgive which marked the characters of the two persons. A day or two before the marriage the following invitation was sent;— Dear Sam,— I hope you will quite forget what is past, at any rate what was unpleasant, and come to our wedding on Thursday. There is to be a little breakfast here afterwards, and I am sure that Dan will be very happy to shake your hand. I have asked him, and he says that as he is to be the bridegroom he would be proud to have you as best man. Your old sincere friend, Clara Demijohn,—for the present. The answer was as follows:— Dear Clara,— There\u0027s no malice in me. Since our little tiff I have been thinking that, after all, I\u0027m not the man for matrimony. To sip the honey from many flowers is, perhaps, after all my line of life. I should have been happy to be Dan Tribbledale\u0027s bottle-holder, but that there is another affair coming off which I must attend. Our Lady Amaldina is to be married, and I must be there. Our families have been connected, as you know, for a great many years, and I could not forgive myself if I did not see her turned off. No other consideration would have prevented me from accepting your very kind invitation. Your loving old friend, Sam Crocker. There did come a pang of regret across Clara\u0027s heart, as she read this as to the connection of the families. Of course Crocker was lying. Of course it was an empty boast. But there was a savour of aristocracy even in the capability of telling such a lie. Had she made Crocker her husband she also would have been able to drag Castle Hautboy into her daily conversations with Mrs. Duffer. At the time of these weddings, the month of August, ?olus had not even yet come to a positive and actual decision as to Crocker\u0027s fate. Crocker had been suspended;—by which act he had been temporarily expelled from the office, so that his time was all his own to do what he pleased with it. Whether when suspended he would receive his salary, no one knew as a certainty. The presumption was that a man suspended would be dismissed,—unless he could succeed in explaining away or diminishing the sin of which he had been supposed to be guilty. ?olus himself could suspend, but it required an act on the part of the senior officer to dismiss,—or even to deprive the sinner of any part of his official emoluments. There had been no explanation possible. No diminishing of the sin had been attempted. It was acknowledged on all sides that Crocker had,—as Miss Demijohn properly described it,—destroyed Her Majesty\u0027s Mail papers. In order that unpardonable delay and idleness might not be traced home to him, he had torn into fragments a bundle of official documents. His character was so well known that no one doubted his dismissal. Mr. Jerningham had spoken of it as a thing accomplished. Bobbin and Geraghty had been congratulated on their rise in the department. \"Dismissal—B. B.\" had been recorded, if not in any official book, at any rate in all official minds. But B. B. himself had as yet decided nothing. When Crocker attended Lady Amaldina\u0027s wedding in his best coat and gloves he was still under suspension; but trusting to the conviction that after so long a reprieve capital punishment would not be carried out. Sir Boreas Bodkin had shoved the papers on one side, and, since that, nothing further had been said on the matter. Weeks had passed, but no decision had been made public. Sir Boreas was a man whom the subordinates nearest to him did not like to remind as to any such duty as this. When a case was \"shoved on one side\" it was known to be something unpalateable. And yet, as Mr. Jerningham whispered to George Roden, it was a thing that ought to be settled. \"He can\u0027t come back, you know,\" he said. \"I dare say he will,\" said the Duca. \"Impossible! I look upon it as impossible!\" This Mr. Jerningham said very seriously. \"There are some people, you know,\" rejoined the other, \"whose bark is so much worse than their bite.\" \"I know there are, Mr. Roden, and Sir Boreas is perhaps one of them; but there are cases in which to pardon the thing done seems to be perfectly impossible. This is one of them. If papers are to be destroyed with impunity, what is to become of the Department? I for one should not know how to go on with my duties. Tearing up papers! Good Heavens! When I think of it I doubt whether I am standing on my head or my heels.\" This was very strong language for Mr. Jerningham, who was not accustomed to find fault with the proceedings of his superiors. He went about the office all these weeks with a visage of woe and the air of a man conscious that some great evil was at hand. Sir Boreas had observed it, and knew well why that visage was so long. Nevertheless when his eyes fell on that bundle of papers,—on the Crocker bundle of papers,—he only pushed it a little further out of sight than it was before. Who does not know how odious a letter will become by being shoved on one side day after day? Answer it at the moment, and it will be nothing. Put it away unread, or at least undigested, for a day, and it at once begins to assume ugly proportions. When you have been weak enough to let it lie on your desk, or worse again, hidden in your breast-pocket, for a week or ten days, it will have become an enemy so strong and so odious that you will not dare to attack it. It throws a gloom over all your joys. It makes you cross to your wife, severe to the cook, and critical to your own wine-cellar. It becomes the Black Care which sits behind you when you go out a riding. You have neglected a duty, and have put yourself in the power of perhaps some vulgar snarler. You think of destroying it and denying it, dishonestly and falsely,—as Crocker did the mail papers. And yet you must bear yourself all the time as though there were no load lying near your heart. So it was with our ?olus and the Crocker papers. The papers had become a great bundle. The unfortunate man had been called upon for an explanation, and had written a blundering long letter on a huge sheet of foolscap paper,—which Sir Boreas had not read, and did not mean to read. Large fragments of the torn \"mail papers\" had been found, and were all there. Mr. Jerningham had written a well-worded lengthy report,—which never certainly would be read. There were former documents in which the existence of the papers had been denied. Altogether the bundle was big and unholy and distasteful. Those who knew our ?olus well were sure that he would never even undo the tape by which the bundle was tied. But something must be done. One month\u0027s pay-day had already passed since the suspension, and the next was at hand. \"Can anything be settled about Mr. Crocker?\" asked Mr. Jerningham, one day about the end of August. Sir Boreas had already sent his family to a little place he had in the West of Ireland, and was postponing his holiday because of this horrid matter. Mr. Jerningham could never go away till ?olus went. Sir Boreas knew all this, and was thoroughly ashamed of himself. \"Just speak to me about it to-morrow and we\u0027ll settle the matter,\" he said, in his blandest voice. Mr. Jerningham retreated from the room frowning. According to his thinking there ought to be nothing to settle. \"D—— the fellow,\" said Sir Boreas, as soon as the door was closed; and he gave the papers another shove which sent them off the huge table on to the floor. Whether it was Mr. Jerningham or Crocker who was damned, he hardly knew himself. Then he was forced to stoop to the humility of picking up the bundle. That afternoon he roused himself. About three o\u0027clock he sent, not for Mr. Jerningham, but for the Duca. When Roden entered the room the bundle was before him, but not opened. \"Can you send for this man and get him here to-day?\" he asked. The Duca promised that he would do his best. \"I can\u0027t bring myself to recommend his dismissal,\" he said. The Duca only smiled. \"The poor fellow is just going to be married, you know.\" The Duca smiled again. Living in Paradise Row himself, he knew that the lady, née Clara Demijohn, was already the happy wife of Mr. Tribbledale. But he knew also that after so long an interval Crocker could not well be dismissed, and he was not ill-natured enough to rob his chief of so good an excuse. He left the room, therefore, declaring that he would cause Crocker to be summoned immediately. Crocker was summoned, and came. Had Sir Boreas made up his mind briefly to dismiss the man, or briefly to forgive him, the interview would have been unnecessary. As things now were the man could not certainly be dismissed. Sir Boreas was aware of that. Nor could he be pardoned without further notice. Crocker entered the room with that mingling of the bully and the coward in his appearance which is generally the result when a man who is overawed attempts to show that he is not afraid. Sir Boreas passed his fingers through the hairs on each side of his head, frowned hard, and, blowing through his nostrils, became at once the ?olus that he had been named; Assumes the god, Affects to nod, And seems to shake the spheres. \"Mr. Crocker,\" said the god, laying his hand on the bundle of papers still tied up in a lump. Then he paused and blew the wrath out of his nostrils. \"Sir Boreas, no one can be more sorry for an accident than I am for that.\" \"An accident!\" \"Well, Sir Boreas; I am afraid I shall not make you understand it all.\" \"I don\u0027t think you will.\" \"The first paper I did tear up by accident, thinking it was something done with.\" \"Then you thought you might as well send the others after it.\" \"One or two were torn by accident. Then—\" \"Well!\" \"I hope you\u0027ll look it over this time, Sir Boreas.\" \"I have done nothing but look it over, as you call it, since you came into the Department. You\u0027ve been a disgrace to the office. You\u0027re of no use whatsoever. You give more trouble than all the other clerks put together. I\u0027m sick of hearing your name.\" \"If you\u0027ll try me again I\u0027ll turn over a new leaf, Sir Boreas.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it for a moment. They tell me you\u0027re just going to be married.\" Crocker was silent. Could he be expected to cut the ground from under his own feet at such a moment? \"For the young lady\u0027s sake, I don\u0027t like turning you adrift on the world at such a time. I only wish that she had a more secure basis for her happiness.\" \"She\u0027ll be all right,\" said Crocker. He will probably be thought to have been justified in carrying on the delusion at such a crisis of his life. \"But you must take my assurance of this,\" said ?olus, looking more like the god of storms, \"that no wife or baby,—no joy or trouble,—shall save you again if you again deserve dismissal.\" Crocker with his most affable smile thanked Sir Boreas and withdrew. It was said afterwards that Sir Boreas had seen and read that smile on Roden\u0027s face, had put two and two together in regard to him, and had become sure that there was to be no marriage. But, had he lost that excuse, where should he find another?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2737/75411.html","bookId":1384,"book":{"id":1384,"title":"Marion Fay","description":"简介： When Mr. Lionel Trafford went into Parliament for the Borough of Wednesbury as an advanced Radical, it nearly broke the heart of his uncle, the old Marquis of Kingsbury.
