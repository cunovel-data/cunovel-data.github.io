{"id":2412,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"2:1 [hgb] 所 以 在 基 督 里 若 有 什 么 劝 勉 ， 爱 心 有 什 么 安 慰 ， 圣 灵 有 什 么 交 通 ， 心 中 有 什 么 慈 悲 怜 悯 ， \n [kjv] If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, \n [bbe] If then there is any comfort in Christ, any help given by love, any uniting of hearts in the Spirit, any loving mercies and pity, \n 2:2 [hgb] 你 们 就 要 意 念 相 同 ， 爱 心 相 同 ， 有 一 样 的 心 思 ， 有 一 样 的 意 念 ， 使 我 的 喜 乐 可 以 满 足 。 \n [kjv] Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. \n [bbe] Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in harmony and of one mind; \n 2:3 [hgb] 凡 事 不 可 结 党 ， 不 可 贪 图 虚 浮 的 荣 耀 。 只 要 存 心 谦 卑 ， 各 人 看 别 人 比 自 己 强 。 \n [kjv] Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. \n [bbe] Doing nothing through envy or through pride, but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself; \n 2:4 [hgb] 各 人 不 要 单 顾 自 己 的 事 ， 也 要 顾 别 人 的 事 。 \n [kjv] Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. \n [bbe] Not looking everyone to his private good, but keeping in mind the things of others. \n 2:5 [hgb] 你 们 当 以 基 督 耶 稣 的 心 为 心 。 \n [kjv] Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: \n [bbe] Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus, \n 2:6 [hgb] 他 本 有 神 的 形 像 ， 不 以 自 己 与 神 同 等 为 强 夺 的 。 \n [kjv] Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: \n [bbe] To whom, though himself in the form of God, it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like God; \n 2:7 [hgb] 反 倒 虚 己 ， 取 了 奴 仆 的 形 像 ， 成 为 人 的 样 式 。 \n [kjv] But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: \n [bbe] But he made himself as nothing, taking the form of a servant, being made like men; \n 2:8 [hgb] 既 有 人 的 样 子 ， 就 自 己 卑 微 ， 存 心 顺 服 ， 以 至 于 死 ， 且 死 在 十 字 架 上 。 \n [kjv] And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. \n [bbe] And being seen in form as a man, he took the lowest place, and let himself be put to death, even the death of the cross. \n 2:9 [hgb] 所 以 神 将 他 升 为 至 高 ， 又 赐 给 他 那 超 乎 万 名 之 上 的 名 ， \n [kjv] Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: \n [bbe] For this reason God has put him in the highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every name; \n 2:10 [hgb] 叫 一 切 在 天 上 的 ， 地 上 的 ， 和 地 底 下 的 ， 因 耶 稣 的 名 ， 无 不 屈 膝 ， \n [kjv] That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; \n [bbe] So that at the name of Jesus every knee may be bent, of those in heaven and those on earth and those in the underworld, \n 2:11 [hgb] 无 不 口 称 耶 稣 基 督 为 主 ， 使 荣 耀 归 与 父 神 。 \n [kjv] And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. \n [bbe] And that every tongue may give witness that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. \n 2:12 [hgb] 这 样 看 来 ， 我 亲 爱 的 弟 兄 你 们 既 是 常 顺 服 的 ， 不 但 我 在 你 们 那 里 ， 就 是 我 如 今 不 在 你 们 那 里 ， 更 是 顺 服 的 ， 就 当 恐 惧 战 兢 ， 作 成 你 们 得 救 的 工 夫 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. \n [bbe] So then, my loved ones, as you have at all times done what I say, not only when I am present, but now much more when I am not with you, give yourselves to working out your salvation with fear in your hearts; \n 2:13 [hgb] 因 为 你 们 立 志 行 事 ， 都 是 神 在 你 们 心 里 运 行 ， 为 要 成 就 他 的 美 意 。 \n [kjv] For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. \n [bbe] For it is God who is the cause of your desires and of your acts, for his good pleasure. \n 2:14 [hgb] 凡 所 行 的 ， 都 不 要 发 怨 言 ， 起 争 论 ， \n [kjv] Do all things without murmurings and disputings: \n [bbe] Do all things without protests and arguments; \n 2:15 [hgb] 使 你 们 无 可 指 摘 ， 诚 实 无 伪 ， 在 这 弯 曲 悖 谬 的 世 代 ， 作 神 无 瑕 疵 的 儿 女 。 你 们 显 在 这 世 代 中 ， 好 像 明 光 照 耀 ， \n [kjv] That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; \n [bbe] So that you may be holy and gentle, children of God without sin in a twisted and foolish generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world, \n 2:16 [hgb] 将 生 命 的 道 表 明 出 来 ， 叫 我 在 基 督 的 日 子 ， 好 夸 我 没 有 空 跑 ， 也 没 有 徒 劳 。 \n [kjv] Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. \n [bbe] Offering the word of life; so that I may have glory in you in the day of Christ, because my running was not for nothing and my work was not without effect. \n 2:17 [hgb] 我 以 你 们 的 信 心 为 供 献 的 祭 物 。 我 若 被 浇 奠 在 其 上 ， 也 是 喜 乐 ， 并 且 与 你 们 众 人 一 同 喜 乐 。 \n [kjv] Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. \n [bbe] And even if I am offered like a drink offering, giving myself for the cause and work of your faith, I am glad and have joy with you all: \n 2:18 [hgb] 你 们 也 要 照 样 喜 乐 ， 并 且 与 我 一 同 喜 乐 。 \n [kjv] For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. \n [bbe] And in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy. \n 2:19 [hgb] 我 靠 主 耶 稣 指 望 快 打 发 提 摩 太 去 见 你 们 ， 叫 我 知 道 你 们 的 事 ， 心 里 就 得 着 安 慰 。 \n [kjv] But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. \n [bbe] But I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may be comforted when I have news of you. \n 2:20 [hgb] 因 为 我 没 有 别 人 与 我 同 心 ， 实 在 挂 念 你 们 的 事 。 \n [kjv] For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. \n [bbe] For I have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you. \n 2:21 [hgb] 别 人 都 求 自 己 的 事 ， 并 不 求 耶 稣 基 督 的 事 。 \n [kjv] For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ\u0027s. \n [bbe] For they all go after what is theirs, not after the things of Christ. \n 2:22 [hgb] 但 你 们 知 道 提 摩 太 的 明 证 ， 他 兴 旺 福 音 与 我 同 劳 ， 待 我 像 儿 子 待 父 亲 一 样 。 \n [kjv] But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. \n [bbe] But his quality is clear to you; how, as a child is to its father, so he was a help to me in the work of the good news. \n 2:23 [hgb] 所 以 我 一 看 出 我 的 事 要 怎 样 了 结 ， 就 盼 望 立 刻 打 发 他 去 。 \n [kjv] Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. \n [bbe] Him then I am hoping to send as quickly as possible, when I am able to see how things will go for me: \n 2:24 [hgb] 但 我 靠 着 主 ， 自 信 我 也 必 快 去 。 \n [kjv] But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. \n [bbe] But I have faith in the Lord that I myself will come before long. \n 2:25 [hgb] 然 而 我 想 必 须 打 发 以 巴 弗 提 到 你 们 那 里 去 。 他 是 我 的 兄 弟 ， 与 我 一 同 作 工 ， 一 同 当 兵 ， 是 你 们 所 差 遣 的 ， 也 是 供 给 我 需 用 的 。 \n [kjv] Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. \n [bbe] But it seemed to me necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, who has taken part with me in the work and in the fight, and your servant, sent by you for help in my need; \n 2:26 [hgb] 他 很 想 念 你 们 众 人 ， 并 且 极 其 难 过 ， 因 为 你 们 听 见 他 病 了 。 \n [kjv] For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. \n [bbe] Because his heart was with you all, and he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill: \n 2:27 [hgb] 他 实 在 是 病 了 ， 几 乎 要 死 。 然 而 神 怜 恤 他 ， 不 但 怜 恤 他 ， 也 怜 恤 我 ， 免 得 我 忧 上 加 忧 。 \n [kjv] For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. \n [bbe] For in fact he was ill almost to death: but God had mercy on him; and not only on him but on me, so that I might not have grief on grief. \n 2:28 [hgb] 所 以 我 越 发 急 速 打 发 他 去 ， 叫 你 们 再 见 他 ， 就 可 以 喜 乐 ， 我 也 可 以 少 些 忧 愁 。 \n [kjv] I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. \n [bbe] I have sent him, then, the more gladly, so that when you see him again, you may be happy and I may have the less sorrow. \n 2:29 [hgb] 故 此 你 们 要 在 主 里 欢 欢 乐 乐 地 接 待 他 。 而 且 要 尊 重 这 样 的 人 。 \n [kjv] Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: \n [bbe] So take him to your hearts in the Lord with all joy, and give honour to such as he is: \n 2:30 [hgb] 因 他 为 作 基 督 的 工 夫 ， 几 乎 至 死 ， 不 顾 性 命 ， 要 补 足 你 们 供 给 我 的 不 及 之 处 。 \n [kjv] Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me. \n [bbe] Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, putting his life in danger to make your care for me complete. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/170/2285.html","bookId":92,"book":{"id":92,"title":"腓立比书 Philippians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 基 督 耶 稣 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 和 提 摩 太 ， 写 信 给 凡 住 腓 立 比 ， 在 基 督 耶 稣 里 的 众 圣 徒 ， 和 诸 位 监 督 ， 诸 位 执 事 。 [kjv] Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Chris...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/170","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
