And he said unto them, Behold, the king\u0027s son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David. \n [bbe] And all the people made an agreement with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Truly, the king\u0027s son will be king, as the Lord has said about the sons of David. \n 23:4 [hgb] 又 说 ， 你 们 当 这 样 行 ， 祭 司 和 利 未 人 凡 安 息 日 进 班 的 ， 三 分 之 一 要 把 守 各 门 ， \n [kjv] This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors; \n [bbe] This is what you are to do: let a third of you, of the priests and Levites, who come in on the Sabbath, keep the doors; \n 23:5 [hgb] 三 分 之 一 要 在 王 宫 ， 三 分 之 一 要 在 基 址 门 。 众 百 姓 要 在 耶 和 华 殿 的 院 内 。 \n [kjv] And a third part shall be at the king\u0027s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD. \n [bbe] And a third are to be stationed at the king\u0027s house; and a third at the doorway of the horses: while all the people are waiting in the open spaces round the house of the Lord. \n 23:6 [hgb] 除 了 祭 司 和 供 职 的 利 未 人 之 外 ， 不 准 别 人 进 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 惟 独 他 们 可 以 进 去 ， 因 为 他 们 圣 洁 。 众 百 姓 要 遵 守 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 。 \n [kjv] But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD. \n [bbe] But let no one come into the house of the Lord but only the priests and those of the Levites who have work to do there; they may go in for they are holy; but the rest of the people are to keep the orders of the Lord. \n 23:7 [hgb] 利 未 人 要 手 中 各 拿 兵 器 ， 四 围 护 卫 王 。 凡 擅 入 殿 宇 的 ， 必 当 治 死 。 王 出 入 的 时 候 ， 你 们 当 跟 随 他 。 \n [kjv] And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out. \n [bbe] And the Levites are to make a circle round the king, every man being armed; and any man who comes into the house is to be put to death; you are to keep with the king when he comes in and when he goes out. \n 23:8 [hgb] 利 未 人 和 犹 大 众 人 都 照 着 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 一 切 所 吩 咐 的 去 行 ， 各 带 所 管 安 息 日 进 班 出 班 的 人 来 ， 因 为 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 不 许 他 们 下 班 。 \n [kjv] So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses. \n [bbe] So the Levites and all Judah did as Jehoiada the priest had given them orders: every one took with him his men, those who were to come in and those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada had not sent away the divisions. \n 23:9 [hgb] 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 便 将 神 殿 里 所 藏 大 卫 王 的 枪 ， 盾 牌 ， 挡 牌 交 给 百 夫 长 ， \n [kjv] Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David\u0027s, which were in the house of God. \n [bbe] Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body-covers which had been King David\u0027s and which were kept in the house of God. \n 23:10 [hgb] 又 分 派 众 民 手 中 各 拿 兵 器 ， 在 坛 和 殿 那 里 ， 从 殿 右 直 到 殿 左 ， 站 在 王 子 的 四 围 。 \n [kjv] And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about. \n [bbe] And he put all the people in position, every man with his instruments of war in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left, by the altar and the house and all round the king. \n 23:11 [hgb] 于 是 领 王 子 出 来 ， 给 他 戴 上 冠 冕 ， 将 律 法 书 交 给 他 ， 立 他 作 王 。 耶 何 耶 大 和 众 子 膏 他 ， 众 人 说 ， 愿 王 万 岁 。 \n [kjv] Then they brought out the king\u0027s son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king. \n [bbe] Then they made the king\u0027s son come out, and they put the crown on his head and gave him the arm-bands and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons put the holy oil on him and said, Long life to the king. \n 23:12 [hgb] 亚 他 利 雅 听 见 民 奔 走 赞 美 王 的 声 音 ， 就 到 民 那 里 ， 进 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， \n [kjv] Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD: \n [bbe] Now Athaliah, hearing the noise of the people running and praising the king, came to the people in the house of the Lord: \n 23:13 [hgb] 看 见 王 站 在 殿 门 的 柱 旁 ， 百 夫 长 和 吹 号 的 人 侍 立 在 王 左 右 ， 国 民 都 欢 乐 吹 号 ， 又 有 歌 唱 的 ， 用 各 样 的 乐 器 领 人 歌 唱 赞 美 。 亚 他 利 雅 就 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 喊 叫 说 ， 反 了 。 反 了 。 \n [kjv] And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason. \n [bbe] And looking, she saw the king in his place by the pillar at the doorway, and the captains and the horns by his side; and all the people of the land were giving signs of joy and sounding the horns; and the makers of melody were playing on instruments of music, taking the chief part in the song of praise. Then Athaliah, violently parting her robes, said, Broken faith, broken faith! \n 23:14 [hgb] 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 带 管 辖 军 兵 的 百 夫 长 出 来 ， 吩 咐 他 们 说 ， 将 她 赶 到 班 外 ， 凡 跟 随 她 的 必 用 刀 杀 死 。 因 为 祭 司 说 ， 不 可 在 耶 和 华 殿 里 杀 她 。 \n [kjv] Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD. \n [bbe] Then Jehoiada the priest gave orders to the captains of hundreds who had authority over the army, saying, Take her outside the lines, and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be put to death in the house of the Lord. \n 23:15 [hgb] 众 兵 就 闪 开 ， 让 她 去 。 她 走 到 王 宫 的 马 门 ， 便 在 那 里 把 她 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king\u0027s house, they slew her there. \n [bbe] So they put their hands on her, and she went to the king\u0027s house by the doorway of the king\u0027s horses; and there she was put to death. \n 23:16 [hgb] 耶 何 耶 大 与 众 民 和 王 立 约 ， 都 要 作 耶 和 华 的 民 。 \n [kjv] And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD\u0027s people. \n [bbe] And Jehoiada made an agreement between the Lord and all the people and the king, that they would be the Lord\u0027s people. \n 23:17 [hgb] 于 是 众 民 都 到 巴 力 庙 ， 拆 毁 了 庙 ， 打 碎 坛 和 像 ， 又 在 坛 前 将 巴 力 的 祭 司 玛 坦 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. \n [bbe] Then all the people went to the house of Baal and had it pulled down, and its altars and images broken up; and Mattan, the priest of Baal, they put to death before the altars. \n 23:18 [hgb] 耶 何 耶 大 派 官 看 守 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 是 在 祭 司 利 未 人 手 下 。 这 祭 司 利 未 人 是 大 卫 分 派 在 耶 和 华 殿 中 ， 照 摩 西 律 法 上 所 写 的 ， 给 耶 和 华 献 燔 祭 ， 又 按 大 卫 所 定 的 例 ， 欢 乐 歌 唱 。 \n [kjv] Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David. \n [bbe] And Jehoiada put the work and the care of the house of the Lord into the hands of the priests and the Levites, who had been grouped in divisions by David to make burned offerings to the Lord, as it is recorded in the law of Moses, with joy and song as David had said. \n 23:19 [hgb] 且 设 立 守 门 的 把 守 耶 和 华 殿 的 各 门 ， 无 论 为 何 事 ， 不 洁 净 的 人 都 不 准 进 去 。 \n [kjv] And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in. \n [bbe] And he put door-keepers at the doors of the Lord\u0027s house, to see that no one who was unclean in any way might come in. \n 23:20 [hgb] 又 率 领 百 夫 长 和 贵 胄 ， 与 民 间 的 官 长 ， 并 国 中 的 众 民 ， 请 王 从 耶 和 华 殿 下 来 ， 由 上 门 进 入 王 宫 ， 立 王 坐 在 国 位 上 。 \n [kjv] And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king\u0027s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. \n [bbe] Then he took the captains of hundreds and the chiefs and the rulers of the people and all the people of the land, and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord through the higher doorway into the king\u0027s house, and put the king on the seat of the kingdom. \n 23:21 [hgb] 国 民 都 欢 乐 ， 合 城 都 安 静 。 众 人 已 将 亚 他 利 雅 用 刀 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword. \n [bbe] So all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death with the sword. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1404.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
