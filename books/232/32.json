{"id":7145,"no":32,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"32:1 [hgb] 这 虔 诚 的 事 以 后 ， 亚 述 王 西 拿 基 立 来 侵 入 犹 大 ， 围 困 一 切 坚 固 城 ， 想 要 攻 破 占 据 。 [kjv] After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself. [bbe] Now after these things and this true-hearted work, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came into Judah, and put his army in position before the walled towns of Judah, designing to make his way into them by force. 32:2 [hgb] 希 西 家 见 西 拿 基 立 来 ， 定 意 要 攻 打 耶 路 撒 冷 ， [kjv] And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, [bbe] And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come for the purpose of fighting against Jerusalem, 32:3 [hgb] 就 与 首 领 和 勇 士 商 议 ， 塞 住 城 外 的 泉 源 。 他 们 就 都 帮 助 他 。 [kjv] He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him. [bbe] He took up with his rulers and men of war the question of stopping up the water-springs outside the town; and they gave him their support. 32:4 [hgb] 于 是 有 许 多 人 聚 集 ， 塞 了 一 切 泉 源 ， 并 通 流 国 中 的 小 河 ， 说 ， 亚 述 王 来 ， 为 何 让 他 得 着 许 多 水 呢 ？ [kjv] So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water? [bbe] So they got together a great number of people, and had all the water-springs and the stream flowing through the land stopped up, saying, Why let the kings of Assyria come and have much water? 32:5 [hgb] 希 西 家 力 图 自 强 ， 就 修 筑 所 有 拆 毁 的 城 墙 ， 高 与 城 楼 相 齐 。 在 城 外 又 筑 一 城 ， 坚 固 大 卫 城 的 米 罗 ， 制 造 了 许 多 军 器 ， 盾 牌 。 [kjv] Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance. [bbe] Then he took heart, building up the wall where it was broken down, and making its towers higher, and building another wall outside; and he made strong the Millo in the town of David, and got together a great store of all sorts of instruments of war. 32:6 [hgb] 设 立 军 长 管 理 百 姓 ， 将 他 们 招 聚 在 城 门 的 宽 阔 处 ， 用 话 勉 励 他 们 ， 说 ， [kjv] And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, [bbe] And he put war chiefs over the people, and sent for them all to come together to him in the wide place at the doorway into the town, and to give them heart he said to them, 32:7 [hgb] 你 们 当 刚 强 壮 胆 ， 不 要 因 亚 述 王 和 跟 随 他 的 大 军 恐 惧 ， 惊 慌 。 因 为 与 我 们 同 在 的 ， 比 与 他 们 同 在 的 更 大 。 [kjv] Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him: [bbe] Be strong and take heart; have no fear, and do not be troubled on account of the king of Assyria and all the great army with him: for there is a greater with us. 32:8 [hgb] 与 他 们 同 在 的 是 肉 臂 ， 与 我 们 同 在 的 是 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 ， 他 必 帮 助 我 们 ， 为 我 们 争 战 。 百 姓 就 靠 犹 大 王 希 西 家 的 话 ， 安 然 无 惧 了 。 [kjv] With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. [bbe] With him is an arm of flesh; but we have the Lord our God, helping us and fighting for us. And the people put their faith in what Hezekiah, king of Judah, said. 32:9 [hgb] 此 后 ， 亚 述 王 西 拿 基 立 和 他 的 全 军 攻 打 拉 吉 ， 就 差 遣 臣 仆 到 耶 路 撒 冷 见 犹 大 王 希 西 家 和 一 切 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 犹 大 人 ， 说 ， [kjv] After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying, [bbe] After this, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem (at that time he was stationed with all his army in front of Lachish), to say to Hezekiah and all the men of Judah in Jerusalem, 32:10 [hgb] 亚 述 王 西 拿 基 立 如 此 说 ， 你 们 倚 靠 什 么 ， 还 在 耶 路 撒 冷 受 困 呢 ？ [kjv] Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem? [bbe] Sennacherib, king of Assyria, says, In what are you placing your hope, waiting here in the walled town of Jerusalem? 32:11 [hgb] 希 西 家 对 你 们 说 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 必 救 我 们 脱 离 亚 述 王 的 手 ， 这 不 是 诱 惑 你 们 ， 使 你 们 受 饥 渴 而 死 吗 ？ [kjv] Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? [bbe] Is it not Hezekiah who has got you to do it, causing your death from need of food and water, by saying, The Lord our God will give us salvation out of the hands of the king of Assyria? 32:12 [hgb] 这 希 西 家 岂 不 是 废 去 耶 和 华 的 丘 坛 和 祭 坛 ， 吩 咐 犹 大 与 耶 路 撒 冷 的 人 说 你 们 当 在 一 个 坛 前 敬 拜 ， 在 其 上 烧 香 吗 ？ [kjv] Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it? [bbe] Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, Give worship before one altar only, burning offerings on it? 32:13 [hgb] 我 与 我 列 祖 向 列 邦 所 行 的 ， 你 们 岂 不 知 道 吗 ？ 列 邦 的 神 何 尝 能 救 自 己 的 国 脱 离 我 手 呢 ？ [kjv] Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? [bbe] Have you no knowledge of what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of every land? were the gods of the nations of those lands able to keep their land from falling into my hands? 32:14 [hgb] 我 列 祖 所 灭 的 国 ， 那 些 神 中 谁 能 救 自 己 的 民 脱 离 我 手 呢 ？ 难 道 你 们 的 神 能 救 你 们 脱 离 我 手 吗 ？ [kjv] Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? [bbe] Who was there among all the gods of those nations, which my fathers put to destruction, who was able to keep his people safe from my hands? and is it possible that your God will keep you safe from my hands? 32:15 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 不 要 叫 希 西 家 这 样 欺 哄 诱 惑 你 们 ， 也 不 要 信 他 。 因 为 没 有 一 国 一 邦 的 神 能 救 自 己 的 民 脱 离 我 手 和 我 列 祖 的 手 ， 何 况 你 们 的 神 更 不 能 救 你 们 脱 离 我 的 手 。 [kjv] Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand? [bbe] So do not be tricked by Hezekiah or let him get you to do this, and do not put any faith in what he says: for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to keep his people safe from my hands, or the hands of my fathers: how much less will your God keep you safe from my hands! 32:16 [hgb] 西 拿 基 立 的 臣 仆 还 有 别 的 话 毁 谤 耶 和 华 神 和 他 仆 人 希 西 家 。 [kjv] And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah. [bbe] And his servants said even more against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah. 32:17 [hgb] 西 拿 基 立 也 写 信 毁 谤 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 说 ， 列 邦 的 神 既 不 能 救 他 的 民 脱 离 我 手 ， 希 西 家 的 神 也 不 能 救 他 的 民 脱 离 我 手 了 。 [kjv] He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand. [bbe] And he sent letters, in addition, to put shame on the Lord, the God of Israel, and to say evil against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not been able to keep their people safe from my hands, no more will the God of Hezekiah keep his people safe from my hands. 32:18 [hgb] 亚 述 王 的 臣 仆 用 犹 大 言 语 向 耶 路 撒 冷 城 上 的 民 大 声 呼 叫 ， 要 惊 吓 他 们 ， 扰 乱 他 们 ， 以 便 取 城 。 [kjv] Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews\u0027 speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. [bbe] These things they said, crying out with a loud voice in the Jews\u0027 language, to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, with the purpose of troubling them and putting fear into them, so that they might take the town; 32:19 [hgb] 他 们 论 耶 路 撒 冷 的 神 ， 如 同 论 世 上 人 手 所 造 的 神 一 样 。 [kjv] And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man. [bbe] Talking of the God of Jerusalem as if he was like the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of men\u0027s hands. 32:20 [hgb] 希 西 家 王 和 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 先 知 以 赛 亚 因 此 祷 告 ， 向 天 呼 求 。 [kjv] And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. [bbe] And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, made prayer because of this, crying out to heaven. 32:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 就 差 遣 一 个 使 者 进 入 亚 述 王 营 中 ， 把 所 有 大 能 的 勇 士 和 官 长 ， 将 帅 尽 都 灭 了 。 亚 述 王 满 面 含 羞 地 回 到 本 国 ， 进 了 他 神 的 庙 中 ， 有 他 亲 生 的 儿 子 在 那 里 用 刀 杀 了 他 。 [kjv] And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword. [bbe] And the Lord sent an angel who put to death all the men of war and the chiefs and the captains in the army of the king of Assyria. So he went back to his country in shame. And when he came into the house of his god, his sons, the offspring of his body, put him to death there with the sword. 32:22 [hgb] 这 样 ， 耶 和 华 救 希 西 家 和 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 脱 离 亚 述 王 西 拿 基 立 的 手 ， 也 脱 离 一 切 仇 敌 的 手 ， 又 赐 他 们 四 境 平 安 。 [kjv] Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side. [bbe] So the Lord gave Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem salvation from the power of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from all others, giving them rest on every side. 32:23 [hgb] 有 许 多 人 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 将 供 物 献 与 耶 和 华 ， 又 将 宝 物 送 给 犹 大 王 希 西 家 。 此 后 ， 希 西 家 在 列 邦 人 的 眼 中 看 为 尊 大 。 [kjv] And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. [bbe] And great numbers came to Jerusalem with offerings for the Lord, and things of great price for Hezekiah, king of Judah: so that he was honoured among all nations from that time. 32:24 [hgb] 那 时 希 西 家 病 得 要 死 ， 就 祷 告 耶 和 华 ， 耶 和 华 应 允 他 ， 赐 他 一 个 兆 头 。 [kjv] In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign. [bbe] In those days Hezekiah was ill and near death; and he made prayer to the Lord, and the Lord in answer gave him a sign. 32:25 [hgb] 希 西 家 却 没 有 照 他 所 蒙 的 恩 报 答 耶 和 华 。 因 他 心 里 骄 傲 ， 所 以 忿 怒 要 临 到 他 和 犹 大 并 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. [bbe] But Hezekiah did not do as had been done to him; for his heart was lifted up in pride; and so wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem. 32:26 [hgb] 但 希 西 家 和 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 觉 得 心 里 骄 傲 ， 就 一 同 自 卑 ， 以 致 耶 和 华 的 忿 怒 在 希 西 家 的 日 子 没 有 临 到 他 们 。 [kjv] Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. [bbe] But then, Hezekiah, in sorrow for what he had done, put away his pride; and he and all Jerusalem made themselves low, so that the wrath of the Lord did not come on them in Hezekiah\u0027s life-time. 32:27 [hgb] 希 西 家 大 有 尊 荣 资 财 ， 建 造 府 库 ， 收 藏 金 银 ， 宝 石 ， 香 料 ， 盾 牌 ， 和 各 样 的 宝 器 ， [kjv] And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; [bbe] And Hezekiah had very great wealth and honour; and he made himself store-houses for his gold and silver and jewels and spices, and for body-covers and all sorts of beautiful vessels. 32:28 [hgb] 又 建 造 仓 房 ， 收 藏 五 谷 ， 新 酒 ， 和 油 ， 又 为 各 类 牲 畜 盖 棚 立 圈 。 [kjv] Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. [bbe] And store-houses for the produce of grain and wine and oil; and buildings for all sorts of beasts and flocks. 32:29 [hgb] 并 且 建 立 城 邑 ， 还 有 许 多 的 羊 群 牛 群 ， 因 为 神 赐 他 极 多 的 财 产 。 [kjv] Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. [bbe] And he made towns for himself, and got together much property in flocks and herds: for God had given him great wealth. 32:30 [hgb] 这 希 西 家 也 塞 住 基 训 的 上 源 ， 引 水 直 下 ， 流 在 大 卫 城 的 西 边 。 希 西 家 所 行 的 事 尽 都 亨 通 。 [kjv] This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. [bbe] It was Hezekiah who had the higher spring of the water of Gihon stopped, and the water taken down on the west side of the town of David. In everything he undertook, Hezekiah did well. 32:31 [hgb] 惟 有 一 件 事 ， 就 是 巴 比 伦 王 差 遣 使 者 来 见 希 西 家 ， 访 问 国 中 所 现 的 奇 事 。 这 件 事 神 离 开 他 ， 要 试 验 他 ， 好 知 道 他 心 内 如 何 。 [kjv] Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart. [bbe] However, in the business of the representatives sent by the rulers of Babylon to get news of the wonder which had taken place in the land, God gave up guiding him, testing him to see what was in his heart. 32:32 [hgb] 希 西 家 其 余 的 事 和 他 的 善 行 ， 都 写 在 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 先 知 以 赛 亚 的 默 示 书 上 ， 和 犹 大 ， 以 色 列 的 诸 王 记 上 。 [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and the good he did, are recorded in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 32:33 [hgb] 希 西 家 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 大 卫 子 孙 的 高 陵 上 。 他 死 的 时 候 ， 犹 大 人 和 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 都 尊 敬 他 。 他 儿 子 玛 拿 西 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] So Hezekiah went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the higher part of the resting-places of the sons of David: and all Judah and the people of Jerusalem gave him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son became king in his place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1529.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
