{"id":7117,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"4:1 [hgb] 他 又 制 造 一 座 铜 坛 ， 长 二 十 肘 ， 宽 二 十 肘 ， 高 十 肘 。 [kjv] Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof. [bbe] Then he made a brass altar, twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high. 4:2 [hgb] 又 铸 一 个 铜 海 ， 样 式 是 圆 的 ， 高 五 肘 ， 径 十 肘 ， 围 三 十 肘 。 [kjv] Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. [bbe] And he made the great water-vessel of metal, round in form, measuring ten cubits across from edge to edge; it was five cubits high and thirty cubits round. 4:3 [hgb] 海 周 围 有 野 瓜 的 样 式 ， 每 肘 十 瓜 ， 共 有 两 行 ， 是 铸 海 的 时 候 铸 上 的 （ 野 瓜 原 文 作 牛 ） 。 [kjv] And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast. [bbe] And under it was a design of flowers all round it, ten to a cubit, circling the water-vessel in two lines; they were made from liquid metal at the same time as the water-vessel. 4:4 [hgb] 有 十 二 只 铜 牛 驮 海 ， 三 只 向 北 ， 三 只 向 西 ， 三 只 向 南 ， 三 只 向 东 。 海 在 牛 上 ， 牛 尾 向 内 。 [kjv] It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. [bbe] It was supported on twelve oxen, three facing to the north, three to the west, three to the south, and three to the east, the water-vessel resting on top of them; their back parts were all turned to the middle of it. 4:5 [hgb] 海 厚 一 掌 ， 边 如 杯 边 ， 又 如 百 合 花 ， 可 容 三 千 吧 特 。 [kjv] And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths. [bbe] It was as thick as a man\u0027s open hand, and the edge of it was curved like the edge of a cup, like a lily flower; it would take three thousand baths. 4:6 [hgb] 又 制 造 十 个 盆 ， 五 个 放 在 右 边 ， 五 个 放 在 左 边 ， 献 燔 祭 所 用 之 物 都 洗 在 其 内 。 但 海 是 为 祭 司 沐 浴 的 。 [kjv] He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in. [bbe] And he made ten washing-vessels, putting five on the right side and five on the left; such things as were used in making the burned offering were washed in them; but the great water-vessel was to be used by the priests for washing themselves. 4:7 [hgb] 他 又 照 所 定 的 样 式 造 十 个 金 灯 台 放 在 殿 里 ， 五 个 在 右 边 ， 五 个 在 左 边 。 [kjv] And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. [bbe] And he made the ten gold supports for the lights, as directions had been given for them, and he put them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left. 4:8 [hgb] 又 造 十 张 桌 子 放 在 殿 里 ， 五 张 在 右 边 ， 五 张 在 左 边 。 又 造 一 百 个 金 碗 。 [kjv] He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold. [bbe] He made ten tables, and put them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made a hundred gold basins. 4:9 [hgb] 又 建 立 祭 司 院 和 大 院 ， 并 院 门 ， 用 铜 包 裹 门 扇 。 [kjv] Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass. [bbe] Then he made the open space for the priests, and the great open space and its doors, plating the doors with brass. 4:10 [hgb] 将 海 安 在 殿 门 的 右 边 ， 就 是 南 边 。 [kjv] And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south. [bbe] He put the great water-vessel on the right side of the house to the east, facing south. 4:11 [hgb] 户 兰 又 造 了 盆 ， 铲 ， 碗 。 这 样 ， 他 为 所 罗 门 王 作 完 了 神 殿 的 工 。 [kjv] And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God; [bbe] And Huram made all the pots and the spades and the basins. So he came to the end of all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of God: 4:12 [hgb] 所 造 的 就 是 两 根 柱 子 和 柱 上 两 个 如 球 的 顶 ， 并 两 个 盖 柱 顶 的 网 子 ， [kjv] To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars; [bbe] The two pillars, and the two crowns on the tops of the pillars, and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars; 4:13 [hgb] 和 四 百 石 榴 ， 安 在 两 个 网 子 上 ， 每 网 两 行 盖 着 两 个 柱 上 如 球 的 顶 。 [kjv] And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars. [bbe] And the four hundred apples for the network, two lines of apples for the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars. 4:14 [hgb] 盆 座 和 其 上 的 盆 ， [kjv] He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; [bbe] And he made the ten bases and the ten washing-vessels which were on the bases; 4:15 [hgb] 海 和 海 下 的 十 二 只 牛 ， [kjv] One sea, and twelve oxen under it. [bbe] The great water-vessel with the twelve oxen under it. 4:16 [hgb] 盆 ， 铲 子 ， 肉 锸 子 ， 与 耶 和 华 殿 里 的 一 切 器 皿 ， 都 是 巧 匠 户 兰 用 光 亮 的 铜 为 所 罗 门 王 造 成 的 ， [kjv] The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass. [bbe] All the pots and the spades and the meat-hooks and their vessels, which Huram, who was as his father, made for King Solomon for the house of the Lord, were of polished brass. 4:17 [hgb] 是 在 约 旦 平 原 疏 割 和 撒 利 但 中 间 借 胶 泥 铸 成 的 。 [kjv] In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah. [bbe] The king made them of liquid metal in the lowland of Jordan, in the soft earth between Succoth and Zeredah. 4:18 [hgb] 所 罗 门 制 造 的 这 一 切 甚 多 ， 铜 的 轻 重 无 法 可 查 。 [kjv] Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out. [bbe] So Solomon made all these vessels, a very great store of them, and the weight of the brass used was not measured. 4:19 [hgb] 所 罗 门 又 造 神 殿 里 的 金 坛 和 陈 设 饼 的 桌 子 ， [kjv] And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set; [bbe] And Solomon made all the vessels used in the house of God, the gold altar and the tables on which the holy bread was placed, 4:20 [hgb] 并 精 金 的 灯 台 和 灯 盏 ， 可 以 照 例 点 在 内 殿 前 。 [kjv] Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; [bbe] And the supports for the lights with their lights, to be burning in the regular way in front of the inmost room, of the best gold; 4:21 [hgb] 灯 台 上 的 花 和 灯 盏 ， 并 蜡 剪 都 是 金 的 ， 且 是 纯 金 的 。 [kjv] And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold; [bbe] The flowers and the vessels for the lights and the instruments used for them, were all of gold; it was the best gold. 4:22 [hgb] 又 用 精 金 制 造 镊 子 ， 盘 子 ， 调 羹 ， 火 鼎 。 至 于 殿 门 和 至 圣 所 的 门 扇 ， 并 殿 的 门 扇 ， 都 是 金 子 妆 饰 的 。 [kjv] And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold. [bbe] The scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire-trays, of the best gold; and the inner doors of the house, opening into the most holy place, and the doors of the Temple, were all of gold.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1423.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
