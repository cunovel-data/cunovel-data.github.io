{"id":7130,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"17:1 [hgb] 亚 撒 的 儿 子 约 沙 法 接 续 他 作 王 ， 奋 勇 自 强 ， 防 备 以 色 列 人 ， [kjv] And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel. [bbe] And Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place, and made himself strong against Israel. 17:2 [hgb] 安 置 军 兵 在 犹 大 一 切 坚 固 城 里 ， 又 安 置 防 兵 在 犹 大 地 和 他 父 亚 撒 所 得 以 法 莲 的 城 邑 中 。 [kjv] And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. [bbe] He put forces in all the walled towns of Judah, and responsible chiefs in the land of Judah and in the towns of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 17:3 [hgb] 耶 和 华 与 约 沙 法 同 在 。 因 为 他 行 他 祖 大 卫 初 行 的 道 ， 不 寻 求 巴 力 ， [kjv] And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim; [bbe] And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he went in the early ways of his father, not turning to the Baals, 17:4 [hgb] 只 寻 求 他 父 亲 的 神 ， 遵 行 他 的 诫 命 ， 不 效 法 以 色 列 人 的 行 为 。 [kjv] But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. [bbe] But turning to the God of his father and keeping his laws, and not doing as Israel did. 17:5 [hgb] 所 以 耶 和 华 坚 定 他 的 国 ， 犹 大 众 人 给 他 进 贡 。 约 沙 法 大 有 尊 荣 资 财 。 [kjv] Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance. [bbe] So the Lord made his kingdom strong; and all Judah gave offerings to Jehoshaphat, and he had great wealth and honour. 17:6 [hgb] 他 高 兴 遵 行 耶 和 华 的 道 ， 并 且 从 犹 大 除 掉 一 切 丘 坛 和 木 偶 。 [kjv] And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah. [bbe] His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord; and he went so far as to take away the high places and the wood pillars out of Judah. 17:7 [hgb] 他 作 王 第 三 年 ， 就 差 遣 臣 子 便 亥 伊 勒 ， 俄 巴 底 ， 撒 迦 利 雅 ， 拿 坦 业 ， 米 该 亚 往 犹 大 各 城 去 教 训 百 姓 。 [kjv] Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. [bbe] In the third year of his rule he sent Benhail and Obadiah and Zechariah and Nethanel and Micaiah, his captains, as teachers into the towns of Judah; 17:8 [hgb] 同 着 他 们 有 利 未 人 示 玛 雅 ， 尼 探 雅 ， 西 巴 第 雅 ， 亚 撒 黑 ， 示 米 拉 末 ， 约 拿 单 ， 亚 多 尼 雅 ， 多 比 雅 ， 驼 巴 多 尼 雅 ， 又 有 祭 司 以 利 沙 玛 ， 约 兰 同 着 他 们 。 [kjv] And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests. [bbe] And with them, Shemaiah and Nethaniah and Zebadiah and Asahel and Shemiramoth and Jehonathan and Adonijah and Tobijah and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and Elishama and Jehoram the priests. 17:9 [hgb] 他 们 带 着 耶 和 华 的 律 法 书 ， 走 遍 犹 大 各 城 教 训 百 姓 。 [kjv] And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people. [bbe] And they gave teaching in Judah and had the book of the law of the Lord with them; they went through all the towns of Judah teaching the people. 17:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 使 犹 大 四 围 的 列 国 都 甚 恐 惧 ， 不 敢 与 约 沙 法 争 战 。 [kjv] And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. [bbe] And the fear of the Lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands round Judah, so that they made no wars against Jehoshaphat. 17:11 [hgb] 有 些 非 利 士 人 与 约 沙 法 送 礼 物 ， 纳 贡 银 。 亚 拉 伯 人 也 送 他 公 绵 羊 七 千 七 百 只 ， 公 山 羊 七 千 七 百 只 。 [kjv] Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats. [bbe] And some of the Philistines took offerings to Jehoshaphat, and made him payments of silver; and the Arabians gave him flocks, seven thousand, seven hundred sheep, and seven thousand, seven hundred he-goats. 17:12 [hgb] 约 沙 法 日 渐 强 大 ， 在 犹 大 建 造 营 寨 和 积 货 城 。 [kjv] And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store. [bbe] Jehoshaphat became greater and greater, and made strong towers and store-towns in Judah. 17:13 [hgb] 他 在 犹 大 城 邑 中 有 许 多 工 程 ， 又 在 耶 路 撒 冷 有 战 士 ， 就 是 大 能 的 勇 士 。 [kjv] And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem. [bbe] He had much property in the towns of Judah; he had forces of armed men, great and strong, in Jerusalem. 17:14 [hgb] 他 们 的 数 目 ， 按 着 宗 族 ， 记 在 下 面 ， 犹 大 族 的 ， 千 夫 长 押 拿 为 首 率 领 大 能 的 勇 士 三 十 万 。 [kjv] And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand. [bbe] This is the number of them, listed by their families, the captains of thousands of Judah: Adnah, the captain, and with him three hundred thousand men of war; 17:15 [hgb] 其 次 是 ， 千 夫 长 约 哈 难 率 领 大 能 的 勇 士 二 十 八 万 。 [kjv] And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand. [bbe] Second to him Jehohanan, the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand; 17:16 [hgb] 其 次 是 细 基 利 的 儿 子 亚 玛 斯 雅 ， 他 为 耶 和 华 牺 牲 自 己 ， 率 领 大 能 的 勇 士 二 十 万 。 [kjv] And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour. [bbe] After him Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who freely gave himself to the Lord, and with him two hundred thousand men of war; 17:17 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 族 ， 是 大 能 的 勇 士 以 利 雅 大 率 领 ， 拿 弓 箭 和 盾 牌 的 二 十 万 。 [kjv] And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.
