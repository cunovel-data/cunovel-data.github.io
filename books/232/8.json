{"id":7121,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 所 罗 门 建 造 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 ， 二 十 年 才 完 毕 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house, \n [bbe] Now at the end of twenty years, in which time Solomon had put up the house of the Lord and a house for himself, \n 8:2 [hgb] 以 后 所 罗 门 重 新 修 筑 希 兰 送 给 他 的 那 些 城 邑 ， 使 以 色 列 人 住 在 那 里 。 \n [kjv] That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there. \n [bbe] He took in hand the building up of the towns which Huram had given him, causing the children of Israel to make living-places for themselves there. \n 8:3 [hgb] 所 罗 门 往 哈 马 琐 巴 去 ， 攻 取 了 那 地 方 。 \n [kjv] And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it. \n [bbe] And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and overcame it. \n 8:4 [hgb] 所 罗 门 建 造 旷 野 里 的 达 莫 ， 又 建 造 哈 马 所 有 的 积 货 城 ， \n [kjv] And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath. \n [bbe] And he put up the buildings of Tadmor in the waste land, and of all the store-towns in Hamath; \n 8:5 [hgb] 又 建 造 上 伯 和 仑 ， 下 伯 和 仑 作 为 保 障 ， 都 有 墙 ， 有 门 ， 有 闩 。 \n [kjv] Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; \n [bbe] And of Beth-horon the higher and the lower, walled towns with walls and doorways and locks; \n 8:6 [hgb] 又 建 造 巴 拉 和 所 有 的 积 货 城 ， 并 屯 车 辆 马 兵 的 城 ， 与 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 利 巴 嫩 ， 以 及 自 己 治 理 的 全 国 中 所 愿 意 建 造 的 。 \n [kjv] And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion. \n [bbe] And of Baalath, and all the store-towns which Solomon had, and the towns where he kept his war-carriages and his horse men, and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule. \n 8:7 [hgb] 至 于 国 中 所 剩 下 不 属 以 色 列 人 的 赫 人 ， 亚 摩 利 人 ， 比 利 洗 人 ， 希 未 人 ， 耶 布 斯 人 ， \n [kjv] As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel, \n [bbe] As for all the rest of the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel: \n 8:8 [hgb] 就 是 以 色 列 人 未 曾 灭 绝 的 ， 所 罗 门 挑 取 他 们 的 后 裔 作 服 苦 的 奴 仆 ， 直 到 今 日 。 \n [kjv] But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day. \n [bbe] Their men who were still living in the land, and whom the children of Israel had not put an end to, these Solomon put to forced work, as is done to this day; \n 8:9 [hgb] 惟 有 以 色 列 人 ， 所 罗 门 不 使 他 们 当 奴 仆 作 工 ， 乃 是 作 他 的 战 士 ， 军 长 的 统 领 ， 车 兵 长 ， 马 兵 长 。 \n [kjv] But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen. \n [bbe] But Solomon did not make use of the children of Israel as servants for his work; they were men of war, his chiefs and his captains, and captains of his war-carriages and his horsemen. \n 8:10 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 有 二 百 五 十 督 工 的 ， 监 管 工 人 。 \n [kjv] And these were the chief of king Solomon\u0027s officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people. \n [bbe] Now these were the chief men in authority whom King Solomon had: two hundred and fifty of them, in authority over the people. \n 8:11 [hgb] 所 罗 门 将 法 老 的 女 儿 带 出 大 卫 城 ， 上 到 为 她 建 造 的 宫 里 。 因 所 罗 门 说 ， 耶 和 华 约 柜 所 到 之 处 都 为 圣 地 ， 所 以 我 的 妻 不 可 住 在 以 色 列 王 大 卫 的 宫 里 。 \n [kjv] And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come. \n [bbe] Then Solomon made Pharaoh\u0027s daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her; for he said, I will not have my wife living in the house of David, king of Israel, because those places where the ark of the Lord has come are holy. \n 8:12 [hgb] 所 罗 门 在 耶 和 华 的 坛 上 ， 就 是 在 廊 子 前 他 所 筑 的 坛 上 ， 与 耶 和 华 献 燔 祭 。 \n [kjv] Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch, \n [bbe] Then Solomon made burned offerings to the Lord on the altar of the Lord which he had put up in front of the covered way, \n 8:13 [hgb] 又 遵 着 摩 西 的 吩 咐 在 安 息 日 ， 月 朔 ， 并 一 年 三 节 ， 就 是 除 酵 节 ， 七 七 节 ， 住 棚 节 ， 献 每 日 所 当 献 的 祭 。 \n [kjv] Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles. \n [bbe] Offering every day what had been ordered by Moses, on the Sabbaths and at the new moon and at the regular feasts three times a year, that is at the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tents. \n 8:14 [hgb] 所 罗 门 照 着 他 父 大 卫 所 定 的 例 ， 派 定 祭 司 的 班 次 ， 使 他 们 各 供 己 事 ， 又 使 利 未 人 各 尽 其 职 ， 赞 美 耶 和 华 ， 在 祭 司 面 前 作 每 日 所 当 作 的 。 又 派 守 门 的 按 着 班 次 看 守 各 门 ， 因 为 神 人 大 卫 是 这 样 吩 咐 的 。 \n [kjv] And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded. \n [bbe] And he gave the divisions of the priests their places for their work, as ordered by his father David, and to the Levites he gave their work of praise and waiting on the priests, to do what was needed day by day; and he gave the door-keepers their places in turn at every door; for so David, the man of God, had given orders. \n 8:15 [hgb] 王 所 吩 咐 众 祭 司 和 利 未 人 的 ， 无 论 是 管 府 库 或 办 别 的 事 ， 他 们 都 不 违 背 。 \n [kjv] And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures. \n [bbe] All the orders given by the king to the priests and Levites, in connection with any business or stores, were done with care. \n 8:16 [hgb] 所 罗 门 建 造 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 从 立 根 基 直 到 成 功 的 日 子 ， 工 料 俱 备 。 这 样 ， 耶 和 华 的 殿 全 然 完 毕 。 \n [kjv] Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected. \n [bbe] And all the work of Solomon was complete, from the day when he put the base of the Lord\u0027s house in position, till Solomon had come to the end of building the Lord\u0027s house. \n 8:17 [hgb] 那 时 ， 所 罗 门 往 以 东 地 靠 海 的 以 旬 迦 别 和 以 禄 去 。 \n [kjv] Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom. \n [bbe] Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth by the sea in the land of Edom. \n 8:18 [hgb] 希 兰 差 遣 他 的 臣 仆 ， 将 船 只 和 熟 悉 泛 海 的 仆 人 送 到 所 罗 门 那 里 。 他 们 同 着 所 罗 门 的 仆 人 到 了 俄 斐 ， 得 了 四 百 五 十 他 连 得 金 子 ， 运 到 所 罗 门 王 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. \n [bbe] And Huram sent him, by his servants, ships and experienced seamen, who went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir and came back with four hundred and fifty talents of gold, which they took to King Solomon. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1416.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
