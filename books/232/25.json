{"id":7138,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"25:1 [hgb] 亚 玛 谢 登 基 的 时 候 年 二 十 五 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 二 十 九 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 约 耶 但 ， 是 耶 路 撒 冷 人 。 [kjv] Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother\u0027s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. [bbe] Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years; his mother\u0027s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 25:2 [hgb] 亚 玛 谢 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 只 是 心 不 专 诚 。 [kjv] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart. [bbe] He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but his heart was not completely true to the Lord. 25:3 [hgb] 国 一 坚 定 ， 就 把 杀 他 父 王 的 臣 仆 杀 了 ， [kjv] Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father. [bbe] Now when he became strong in the kingdom, he put to death those men who had taken the life of the king his father. 25:4 [hgb] 却 没 有 治 死 他 们 的 儿 子 ， 是 照 摩 西 律 法 书 上 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 说 ， 不 可 因 子 杀 父 ， 也 不 可 因 父 杀 子 ， 各 人 要 为 本 身 的 罪 而 死 。 [kjv] But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin. [bbe] But he did not put their children to death, for he kept the orders of the Lord recorded in the book of the law of Moses, saying, The fathers are not to be put to death for their children or the children for their fathers, but a man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done. 25:5 [hgb] 亚 玛 谢 招 聚 犹 大 人 ， 按 着 犹 大 和 便 雅 悯 的 宗 族 设 立 千 夫 长 ， 百 夫 长 ， 又 数 点 人 数 ， 从 二 十 岁 以 外 ， 能 拿 枪 拿 盾 牌 出 去 打 仗 的 精 兵 共 有 三 十 万 。 [kjv] Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. [bbe] Then Amaziah got all Judah together and put them in order by their families, even all Judah and Benjamin, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds: and he had those of twenty years old and over numbered, and they came to three hundred thousand of the best fighting-men, trained for war and in the use of the spear and the body-cover. 25:6 [hgb] 又 用 银 子 一 百 他 连 得 ， 从 以 色 列 招 募 了 十 万 大 能 的 勇 士 。 [kjv] He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver. [bbe] And for a hundred talents of silver, he got a hundred thousand fighting-men from Israel. 25:7 [hgb] 有 一 个 神 人 来 见 亚 玛 谢 ， 对 他 说 ， 王 阿 ， 不 要 使 以 色 列 的 军 兵 与 你 同 去 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 不 与 以 色 列 人 以 法 莲 的 后 裔 同 在 。 [kjv] But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim. [bbe] But a man of God came to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with you; for the Lord is not with Israel, that is, the children of Ephraim. 25:8 [hgb] 你 若 一 定 要 去 ， 就 奋 勇 争 战 吧 。 但 神 必 使 你 败 在 敌 人 面 前 。 因 为 神 能 助 人 得 胜 ， 也 能 使 人 倾 败 。 [kjv] But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down. [bbe] But go yourself, and be strong in war; God will not let you go down before those who are fighting against you; for God has power to give help or to send you down before your attackers. 25:9 [hgb] 亚 玛 谢 问 神 人 说 ， 我 给 了 以 色 列 军 的 那 一 百 他 连 得 银 子 怎 么 样 呢 ？ 神 人 回 答 说 ， 耶 和 华 能 把 更 多 的 赐 给 你 。 [kjv] And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this. [bbe] Then Amaziah said to the man of God, But what is to be done about the hundred talents which I have given for the armed band of Israel? And the man of God in answer said, God is able to give you much more than this. 25:10 [hgb] 于 是 亚 玛 谢 将 那 从 以 法 莲 来 的 军 兵 分 别 出 来 ， 叫 他 们 回 家 去 。 故 此 ， 他 们 甚 恼 怒 犹 大 人 ， 气 忿 忿 地 回 家 去 了 。 [kjv] Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger. [bbe] So Amaziah, separating the armed band which had come to him from Ephraim, sent them back again; which made them very angry with Judah, and they went back burning with wrath. 25:11 [hgb] 亚 玛 谢 壮 起 胆 来 ， 率 领 他 的 民 到 盐 谷 ， 杀 了 西 珥 人 一 万 。 [kjv] And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand. [bbe] Then Amaziah took heart, and went out at the head of his people and came to the Valley of Salt, where he put to death ten thousand of the children of Seir; 25:12 [hgb] 犹 大 人 又 生 擒 了 一 万 带 到 山 崖 上 ， 从 那 里 把 他 们 扔 下 去 ， 以 致 他 们 都 摔 碎 了 。 [kjv] And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces. [bbe] And ten thousand more the children of Israel took living, and made them go up to the top of the rock, pushing them down from the top of the rock so that their bodies were broken by the fall. 25:13 [hgb] 但 亚 玛 谢 所 打 发 回 去 ， 不 许 一 同 出 征 的 那 些 军 兵 攻 打 犹 大 各 城 ， 从 撒 玛 利 亚 直 到 伯 和 仑 ， 杀 了 三 千 人 ， 抢 了 许 多 财 物 。 [kjv] But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil. [bbe] But the men of the band which Amaziah sent back and did not take with him to the fight, made attacks on the towns of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon, putting to death three thousand of their people and taking away a great store of their goods. 25:14 [hgb] 亚 玛 谢 杀 了 以 东 人 回 来 ， 就 把 西 珥 的 神 像 带 回 ， 立 为 自 己 的 神 ， 在 它 面 前 叩 拜 烧 香 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them. [bbe] Now when Amaziah came back from the destruction of the Edomites, he took the gods of the children of Seir and made them his gods, worshipping them and burning offerings before them. 25:15 [hgb] 因 此 ， 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 向 亚 玛 谢 发 作 ， 就 差 一 个 先 知 去 见 他 ， 说 ， 这 些 神 不 能 救 它 的 民 脱 离 你 的 手 ， 你 为 何 寻 求 它 呢 ？ [kjv] Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand? [bbe] And so the wrath of the Lord was moved against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, Why have you gone after the gods of the people who have not given their people salvation from your hands? 25:16 [hgb] 先 知 与 王 说 话 的 时 候 ， 王 对 他 说 ， 谁 立 你 作 王 的 谋 士 呢 ？ 你 住 口 吧 。 为 何 找 打 呢 ？ 先 知 就 止 住 了 ， 又 说 ， 你 行 这 事 ， 不 听 从 我 的 劝 戒 ， 我 知 道 神 定 意 要 灭 你 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king\u0027s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. [bbe] But while he was talking to him the king said to him, Have we made you one of the king\u0027s government? say no more, or it will be the cause of your death. Then the prophet gave up protesting, and said, It is clear to me that God\u0027s purpose is your destruction, because you have done this and have not given ear to my words. 25:17 [hgb] 犹 大 王 亚 玛 谢 与 群 臣 商 议 ， 就 差 遣 使 者 去 见 耶 户 的 孙 子 ， 约 哈 斯 的 儿 子 ， 以 色 列 王 约 阿 施 ， 说 ， 你 来 ， 我 们 二 人 相 见 于 战 场 。 [kjv] Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face. [bbe] Then Amaziah, king of Judah, acting on the suggestion of his servants, sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us have a meeting face to face. 25:18 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 约 阿 施 差 遣 使 者 去 见 犹 大 王 亚 玛 谢 ， 说 ， 利 巴 嫩 的 蒺 藜 差 遣 使 者 去 见 利 巴 嫩 的 香 柏 树 ， 说 ， 将 你 的 女 儿 给 我 儿 子 为 妻 。 后 来 利 巴 嫩 有 一 个 野 兽 经 过 ， 把 蒺 藜 践 踏 了 。 [kjv] And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. [bbe] And Joash, king of Israel, sent to Amaziah, king of Judah, saying, The thorn-tree in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son for a wife: and a beast from the woodland in Lebanon went by, crushing the thorn under his feet. 25:19 [hgb] 你 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 打 败 了 以 东 人 ， 你 就 心 高 气 傲 ， 以 致 矜 夸 。 你 在 家 里 安 居 就 罢 了 ， 为 何 要 惹 祸 使 自 己 和 犹 大 国 一 同 败 亡 呢 ？ [kjv] Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee? [bbe] You say, See, I have overcome Edom; and your heart is lifted up with pride: now keep in your country; why do you make causes of trouble, putting yourself, and Judah with you, in danger of downfall? 25:20 [hgb] 亚 玛 谢 却 不 肯 听 从 。 这 是 出 乎 神 ， 好 将 他 们 交 在 敌 人 手 里 ， 因 为 他 们 寻 求 以 东 的 神 。 [kjv] But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom. [bbe] But Amaziah gave no attention; and this was the purpose of God, so that he might give them up into the hands of Joash, because they had gone after the gods of Edom. 25:21 [hgb] 于 是 以 色 列 王 约 阿 施 上 来 ， 在 犹 大 的 伯 示 麦 与 犹 大 王 亚 玛 谢 相 见 于 战 场 。 [kjv] So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah. [bbe] And so Joash, king of Israel, went up; and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, came face to face at Beth-shemesh in Judah. 25:22 [hgb] 犹 大 人 败 在 以 色 列 人 面 前 ， 各 自 逃 回 家 里 去 了 。 [kjv] And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent. [bbe] And Judah was overcome before Israel, and they went in flight, every man to his tent. 25:23 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 约 阿 施 在 伯 示 麦 擒 住 约 哈 斯 （ 就 是 亚 哈 谢 ） 的 孙 子 ， 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 ， 犹 大 王 亚 玛 谢 ， 将 他 带 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 又 拆 毁 耶 路 撒 冷 的 城 墙 ， 从 以 法 莲 门 直 到 角 门 ， 共 四 百 肘 。 [kjv] And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. [bbe] And Joash, king of Israel, made Amaziah, king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, prisoner at Beth-shemesh, and took him to Jerusalem; and he had the wall of Jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of Ephraim to the doorway in the angle, four hundred cubits. 25:24 [hgb] 又 将 俄 别 以 东 所 看 守 神 殿 里 的 一 切 金 银 和 器 皿 ， 与 王 宫 里 的 财 宝 都 拿 了 去 ， 并 带 人 去 为 质 ， 就 回 撒 玛 利 亚 去 了 。 [kjv] And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king\u0027s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. [bbe] And he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the Lord, under the care of Obed-edom, and all the wealth from the king\u0027s house, as well as those whose lives would be the price of broken faith, and went back to Samaria. 25:25 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 约 哈 斯 的 儿 子 约 阿 施 死 后 ， 犹 大 王 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 亚 玛 谢 又 活 了 十 五 年 。 [kjv] And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. [bbe] Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, went on living for fifteen years after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. 25:26 [hgb] 亚 玛 谢 其 余 的 事 ， 自 始 至 终 不 都 写 在 犹 大 和 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 吗 ？ [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, are they not recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 25:27 [hgb] 自 从 亚 玛 谢 离 弃 耶 和 华 之 后 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 有 人 背 叛 他 ， 他 就 逃 到 拉 吉 。 叛 党 却 打 发 人 到 拉 吉 ， 将 他 杀 了 。 [kjv] Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there. [bbe] Now from the time when Amaziah gave up worshipping the Lord, they made secret designs against him in Jerusalem; and he went in flight to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him and put him to death there. 25:28 [hgb] 人 就 用 马 将 他 的 尸 首 驮 回 ， 葬 在 犹 大 京 城 他 列 祖 的 坟 地 里 。 [kjv] And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah. [bbe] And they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in the town of David.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1522.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
