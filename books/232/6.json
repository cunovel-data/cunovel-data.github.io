{"id":7119,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"6:1 [hgb] 那 时 ， 所 罗 门 说 ， 耶 和 华 曾 说 他 必 住 在 幽 暗 之 处 。 [kjv] Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. [bbe] Then Solomon said, O Lord, to the sun you have given the heaven for a living-place, but your living-place was not seen by men, 6:2 [hgb] 但 我 已 经 建 造 殿 宇 作 你 的 居 所 ， 为 你 永 远 的 住 处 。 [kjv] But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever. [bbe] So I have made for you a living-place, a house in which you may be for ever present. 6:3 [hgb] 王 转 脸 为 以 色 列 会 众 祝 福 ， 以 色 列 会 众 就 都 站 立 。 [kjv] And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood. [bbe] Then, turning his face about, the king gave a blessing to all the men of Israel; and they were all on their feet together. 6:4 [hgb] 所 罗 门 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 因 他 亲 口 向 我 父 大 卫 所 应 许 的 ， 也 亲 手 成 就 了 。 [kjv] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying, [bbe] And he said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who himself gave his word to my father David, and with his strong hand has made his word come true, saying, 6:5 [hgb] 他 说 ， 自 从 我 领 我 民 出 埃 及 地 以 来 ， 我 未 曾 在 以 色 列 众 支 派 中 选 择 一 城 建 造 殿 宇 为 我 名 的 居 所 ， 也 未 曾 拣 选 一 人 作 我 民 以 色 列 的 君 。 [kjv] Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel: [bbe] From the day when I took my people out of the land of Egypt, no town in all the tribes of Israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the resting-place of my name; and I took no man to be a ruler over my people Israel; 6:6 [hgb] 但 选 择 耶 路 撒 冷 为 我 名 的 居 所 ， 又 拣 选 大 卫 治 理 我 民 以 色 列 。 [kjv] But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel. [bbe] But now I have made selection of Jerusalem, that my name might be there, and of David, to be over my people Israel. 6:7 [hgb] 所 罗 门 说 ， 我 父 大 卫 曾 立 意 要 为 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 名 建 殿 ， [kjv] Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. [bbe] Now it was in the heart of my father David to put up a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. 6:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 却 对 我 父 大 卫 说 ， 你 立 意 要 为 我 的 名 建 殿 ， 这 意 思 甚 好 。 [kjv] But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart: [bbe] But the Lord said to David my father, You did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name: 6:9 [hgb] 只 是 你 不 可 建 殿 ， 惟 你 所 生 的 儿 子 必 为 我 名 建 殿 。 [kjv] Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. [bbe] But you yourself will not be the builder of the house; but your son, the offspring of your body, he it is who will put up a house for my name. 6:10 [hgb] 现 在 耶 和 华 成 就 了 他 所 应 许 的 话 ， 使 我 接 续 我 父 大 卫 坐 以 色 列 的 国 位 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 说 的 ， 又 为 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 名 建 造 了 殿 。 [kjv] The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. [bbe] And the Lord has kept his word; for I have taken my father David\u0027s place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel, as the Lord gave his word; and I have made the house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel. 6:11 [hgb] 我 将 约 柜 安 置 在 其 中 ， 柜 内 有 耶 和 华 的 约 ， 就 是 他 与 以 色 列 人 所 立 的 约 。 [kjv] And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel. [bbe] And there I have put the ark, in which is the agreement of the Lord, which he made with the people of Israel. 6:12 [hgb] 所 罗 门 当 着 以 色 列 会 众 ， 站 在 耶 和 华 的 坛 前 ， 举 起 手 来 ， [kjv] And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands: [bbe] Then he took his place in front of the altar of the Lord, all the men of Israel being present, 6:13 [hgb] 所 罗 门 曾 造 一 个 铜 台 ， 长 五 肘 ， 宽 五 肘 ， 高 三 肘 ， 放 在 院 中 。 就 站 在 台 上 ， 当 着 以 色 列 的 会 众 跪 下 ， 向 天 举 手 ， [kjv] For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven, [bbe] (For Solomon had made a brass stage, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had put it in the middle of the open space; on this he took his place and went down on his knees before all the meeting of Israel, stretching out his hands to heaven.) 6:14 [hgb] 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 阿 ， 天 上 地 下 没 有 神 可 比 你 的 。 你 向 那 尽 心 行 在 你 面 前 的 仆 人 守 约 施 慈 爱 。 [kjv] And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts: [bbe] And he said, O Lord, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth; keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants, while they go in your ways with all their hearts; 6:15 [hgb] 向 你 仆 人 我 父 大 卫 所 应 许 的 话 现 在 应 验 了 。 你 亲 口 应 许 ， 亲 手 成 就 ， 正 如 今 日 一 样 。 [kjv] Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. [bbe] For you have kept the word which you gave to your servant David, my father; with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day. 6:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 阿 ， 你 所 应 许 你 仆 人 我 父 大 卫 的 话 说 ， 你 的 子 孙 若 谨 慎 自 己 的 行 为 ， 遵 守 我 的 律 法 ， 象 你 在 我 面 前 所 行 的 一 样 ， 就 不 断 人 坐 以 色 列 的 国 位 。 现 在 求 你 应 验 这 话 。 [kjv] Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me. [bbe] So now, O Lord, the God of Israel, let your word to your servant David, my father, come true, when you said, You will never be without a man to take his place before me on the seat of the kingdom of Israel; if only your children give attention to their ways, walking in my law, as you have done before me. 6:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 成 就 向 你 仆 人 大 卫 所 应 许 的 话 。 [kjv] Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David. [bbe] So now, O Lord, the God of Israel, make your word come true which you said to your servant David. 6:18 [hgb] 神 果 真 与 世 人 同 住 在 地 上 吗 ？ 看 哪 ， 天 和 天 上 的 天 尚 且 不 足 你 居 住 的 ， 何 况 我 所 建 的 这 殿 呢 ？ [kjv] But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built! [bbe] But is it truly possible that God may be housed with men on earth? see, heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting-place: how much less this house which I have made: 6:19 [hgb] 惟 求 耶 和 华 我 的 神 垂 顾 仆 人 的 祷 告 祈 求 ， 俯 听 仆 人 在 你 面 前 的 祈 祷 呼 吁 。 [kjv] Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee: [bbe] Still, let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant and to his prayer for grace, O Lord my God, and give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant makes before you; 6:20 [hgb] 愿 你 昼 夜 看 顾 这 殿 ， 就 是 你 应 许 立 为 你 名 的 居 所 。 求 你 垂 听 仆 人 向 此 处 祷 告 的 话 。 [kjv] That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place. [bbe] That your eyes may be open to this house day and night, to this place of which you have said that you would put your name there; to give ear to the prayer which your servant may make, turning to this place. 6:21 [hgb] 你 仆 人 和 你 民 以 色 列 向 此 处 祈 祷 的 时 候 ， 求 你 从 天 上 你 的 居 所 垂 听 ， 垂 听 而 赦 免 。 [kjv] Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive. [bbe] And give ear to the prayers of your servant and of your people Israel, when they make their prayers, turning to this place; give ear from heaven your living-place; and hearing have mercy. 6:22 [hgb] 人 若 得 罪 邻 舍 ， 有 人 叫 他 起 誓 ， 他 来 到 这 殿 ， 在 你 的 坛 前 起 誓 ， [kjv] If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house; [bbe] If a man does wrong to his neighbour and has to take an oath, and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house: 6:23 [hgb] 求 你 从 天 上 垂 听 ， 判 断 你 的 仆 人 ， 定 恶 人 有 罪 ， 照 他 所 行 的 报 应 在 他 头 上 。 定 义 人 有 理 ， 照 他 的 义 赏 赐 他 。 [kjv] Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness. [bbe] Then let your ear be open in heaven, and be the judge of your servants, giving punishment to the wrongdoer, so that his sin may come on his head; and, by your decision, keeping from evil him who has done no wrong. 6:24 [hgb] 你 的 民 以 色 列 若 得 罪 你 ， 败 在 仇 敌 面 前 ， 又 回 心 转 意 承 认 你 的 名 ， 在 这 殿 里 向 你 祈 求 祷 告 ， [kjv] And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house; [bbe] And if your people Israel are overcome in war, because of their sin against you; if they are turned to you again, honouring your name, making prayers and requesting your grace in this house: 6:25 [hgb] 求 你 从 天 上 垂 听 ， 赦 免 你 民 以 色 列 的 罪 ， 使 他 们 归 回 你 赐 给 他 们 和 他 们 列 祖 之 地 。 [kjv] Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers. [bbe] Then give ear from heaven, and let the sin of your people Israel have forgiveness, and take them back again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers. 6:26 [hgb] 你 的 民 因 得 罪 你 ， 你 惩 罚 他 们 ， 使 天 闭 塞 不 下 雨 ， 他 们 若 向 此 处 祷 告 ， 承 认 你 的 名 ， 离 开 他 们 的 罪 ， [kjv] When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them; [bbe] When heaven is shut up and there is no rain, because of their sin against you: if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place, honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them: 6:27 [hgb] 求 你 在 天 上 垂 听 ， 赦 免 你 仆 人 和 你 民 以 色 列 的 罪 ， 将 当 行 的 善 道 指 教 他 们 ， 且 降 雨 在 你 的 地 ， 就 是 你 赐 给 你 民 为 业 之 地 。 [kjv] Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance. [bbe] Then give ear from heaven, so that the sin of your servants and the sin of your people Israel may have forgiveness, when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go; and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for their heritage. 6:28 [hgb] 国 中 若 有 饥 荒 ， 瘟 疫 ， 旱 风 ， 霉 烂 ， 蝗 虫 ， 蚂 蚱 ， 或 有 仇 敌 犯 境 ， 围 困 城 邑 ， 无 论 遭 遇 什 么 灾 祸 疾 病 ， [kjv] If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be: [bbe] If there is no food in the land, if there is disease, if the fruits of the earth are damaged by heat or water, locust or worm; if their towns are shut in by their attackers: whatever trouble or whatever disease there may be: 6:29 [hgb] 你 的 民 以 色 列 ， 或 是 众 人 ， 或 是 一 人 ， 自 觉 灾 祸 甚 苦 ， 向 这 殿 举 手 ， 无 论 祈 求 什 么 ， 祷 告 什 么 ， [kjv] Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house: [bbe] Whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, whatever his trouble may be, whose hands are stretched out to this house: 6:30 [hgb] 求 你 从 天 上 你 的 居 所 垂 听 赦 免 。 你 是 知 道 人 心 的 ， 要 照 各 人 所 行 的 待 他 们 （ 惟 有 你 知 道 世 人 的 心 ） ， [kjv] Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:) [bbe] Then give ear from heaven your living-place, answering with forgiveness, and give to every man, whose secret heart is open to you, the reward of all his ways; (for you, and you only, have knowledge of the hearts of the children of men;) 6:31 [hgb] 使 他 们 在 你 赐 给 我 们 列 祖 之 地 上 一 生 一 世 敬 畏 你 ， 遵 行 你 的 道 。 [kjv] That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. [bbe] So that they may give you worship, walking in your ways, as long as they are living in the land which you gave to our fathers. 6:32 [hgb] 论 到 不 属 你 民 以 色 列 的 外 邦 人 ， 为 你 的 大 名 和 大 能 的 手 ， 并 伸 出 来 的 膀 臂 ， 从 远 方 而 来 ， 向 这 殿 祷 告 ， [kjv] Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name\u0027s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house; [bbe] And as for the man from a strange land, who is not of your people Israel but comes from a far country because of the glory of your name and your strong hand and your outstretched arm; when he comes to make his prayer, turning to this house: 6:33 [hgb] 求 你 从 天 上 你 的 居 所 垂 听 ， 照 着 外 邦 人 所 祈 求 的 而 行 ， 使 天 下 万 民 都 认 识 你 的 名 ， 敬 畏 你 ， 象 你 的 民 以 色 列 一 样 ， 又 使 他 们 知 道 我 建 造 的 这 殿 是 称 为 你 名 下 的 。 [kjv] Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name. [bbe] Then give ear from heaven your living-place, and give him his desire, whatever it may be; so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name, worshipping you as do your people Israel, and may see that this house which I have made is truly named by your name. 6:34 [hgb] 你 的 民 若 奉 你 的 差 遣 ， 无 论 往 何 处 去 与 仇 敌 争 战 ， 向 你 所 选 择 的 城 与 我 为 你 名 所 建 造 的 殿 祷 告 ， [kjv] If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name; [bbe] If your people go out to war against their attackers, by whatever way you may send them, if they make their prayers to you turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which I have put up for your name: 6:35 [hgb] 求 你 从 天 上 垂 听 他 们 的 祷 告 祈 求 ， 使 他 们 得 胜 。 [kjv] Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. [bbe] Then give ear from heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace, and see right done to them. 6:36 [hgb] 你 的 民 若 得 罪 你 （ 世 上 没 有 不 犯 罪 的 人 ） ， 你 向 他 们 发 怒 ， 将 他 们 交 给 仇 敌 掳 到 或 远 或 近 之 地 。 [kjv] If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near; [bbe] If they do wrong against you, (for no man is without sin,) and you are angry with them, and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them, so that they take them away prisoners to a land far off or near; 6:37 [hgb] 他 们 若 在 掳 到 之 地 想 起 罪 来 ， 回 心 转 意 ， 恳 求 你 说 ， 我 们 有 罪 了 ， 我 们 悖 逆 了 ， 我 们 作 恶 了 。 [kjv] Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly; [bbe] And if they take thought, in the land where they are prisoners, turning again to you, crying out in prayer to you in that land, and saying, We are sinners, we have done wrong, we have done evil; 6:38 [hgb] 他 们 若 在 掳 到 之 地 尽 心 尽 性 归 服 你 ， 又 向 自 己 的 地 ， 就 是 你 赐 给 他 们 列 祖 之 地 和 你 所 选 择 的 城 ， 并 我 为 你 名 所 建 造 的 殿 祷 告 ， [kjv] If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name: [bbe] If with all their heart and soul they are turned again to you, in the land where they are prisoners, the land where they have been taken, and make their prayers, turning their eyes to their land which you gave to their fathers, and to the town which you took for yourself, and the house which I have made for your name: 6:39 [hgb] 求 你 从 天 上 你 的 居 所 垂 听 你 民 的 祷 告 祈 求 ， 为 他 们 伸 冤 ， 赦 免 他 们 的 过 犯 。 [kjv] Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee. [bbe] Then give ear from heaven your living-place to their prayer and their cry, and see right done to them, answering with forgiveness your people who have done wrong against you. 6:40 [hgb] 我 的 神 阿 ， 现 在 求 你 睁 眼 看 ， 侧 耳 听 在 此 处 所 献 的 祷 告 。 [kjv] Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. [bbe] Now, O my God, may your eyes be open and your ears awake to the prayers made in this place. 6:41 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 阿 ， 求 你 起 来 ， 和 你 有 能 力 的 约 柜 同 入 安 息 之 所 。 耶 和 华 神 阿 ， 愿 你 的 祭 司 披 上 救 恩 。 愿 你 的 圣 民 蒙 福 欢 乐 。 [kjv] Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness. [bbe] Up! now, O Lord God, come back to your resting-place, you and the ark of your strength: let your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints be glad in what is good. 6:42 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 阿 ， 求 你 不 要 厌 弃 你 的 受 膏 者 ， 要 记 念 向 你 仆 人 大 卫 所 施 的 慈 爱 。 [kjv] O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant. [bbe] O Lord God, let him whom you have taken for yourself never be given up by you: keep in mind your mercies to David your servant.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1419.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
