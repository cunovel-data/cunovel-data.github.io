but give yourselves to the Lord, and come into his holy place, which he has made his for ever, and be the servants of the Lord your God, so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from you. \\n\\n 30:9 [hgb] 你 们 若 转 向 耶 和 华 ， 你 们 的 弟 兄 和 儿 女 必 在 掳 掠 他 们 的 人 面 前 蒙 怜 恤 ， 得 以 归 回 这 地 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 有 恩 典 ， 施 怜 悯 。 你 们 若 转 向 他 ， 他 必 不 转 脸 不 顾 你 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him. \\n\\n [bbe] For if you come back to the Lord, those who took away your brothers and your children will have pity on them, and let them come back to this land: for the Lord your God is full of grace and mercy, and his face will not be turned away from you if you come back to him. \\n\\n 30:10 [hgb] 驿 卒 就 由 这 城 跑 到 那 城 ， 传 遍 了 以 法 莲 ， 玛 拿 西 ， 直 到 西 布 伦 。 那 里 的 人 却 戏 笑 他 们 ， 讥 诮 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. \\n\\n [bbe] So the runners went from town to town through all the country of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun: but they were laughed at and made sport of. \\n\\n 30:11 [hgb] 然 而 亚 设 ， 玛 拿 西 ， 西 布 伦 中 也 有 人 自 卑 ， 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. \\n\\n [bbe] However, some of Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun put away their pride and came to Jerusalem. \\n\\n 30:12 [hgb] 神 也 感 动 犹 大 人 ， 使 他 们 一 心 遵 行 王 与 众 首 领 凭 耶 和 华 之 言 所 发 的 命 令 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] And in Judah the power of God gave them one heart to do the orders of the king and the captains, which were taken as the word of the Lord. \\n\\n 30:13 [hgb] 二 月 ， 有 许 多 人 在 耶 路 撒 冷 聚 集 ， 成 为 大 会 ， 要 守 除 酵 节 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. \\n\\n [bbe] So a very great number of people came together at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month. \\n\\n 30:14 [hgb] 他 们 起 来 ， 把 耶 路 撒 冷 的 祭 坛 和 烧 香 的 坛 尽 都 除 去 ， 抛 在 汲 沦 溪 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron. \\n\\n [bbe] And they got to work and took away all the altars in Jerusalem, and they put all the vessels for burning perfumes into the stream Kidron. \\n\\n 30:15 [hgb] 二 月 十 四 日 ， 宰 了 逾 越 节 的 羊 羔 。 祭 司 与 利 未 人 觉 得 惭 愧 ， 就 洁 净 自 己 ， 把 燔 祭 奉 到 耶 和 华 殿 中 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] Then on the fourteenth day of the second month they put the Passover lambs to death: and the priests and the Levites were shamed, and made themselves holy and took burned offerings into the house of the Lord. \\n\\n 30:16 [hgb] 遵 着 神 人 摩 西 的 律 法 ， 照 例 站 在 自 己 的 地 方 。 祭 司 从 利 未 人 手 里 接 过 血 来 ， 洒 在 坛 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites. \\n\\n [bbe] And they took their places in their right order, as it was ordered in the law of Moses, the man of God: the priests draining out on the altar the blood given them by the Levites. \\n\\n 30:17 [hgb] 会 中 有 许 多 人 尚 未 自 洁 ， 所 以 利 未 人 为 一 切 不 洁 之 人 宰 逾 越 节 的 羊 羔 ， 使 他 们 在 耶 和 华 面 前 成 为 圣 洁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] For there were still a number of the people there who had not made themselves holy: so the Levites had to put Passover lambs to death for those who were not clean, to make them holy to the Lord. \\n\\n 30:18 [hgb] 以 法 莲 ， 玛 拿 西 ， 以 萨 迦 ， 西 布 伦 有 许 多 人 尚 未 自 洁 ， 他 们 却 也 吃 逾 越 节 的 羊 羔 ， 不 合 所 记 录 的 定 例 。 希 西 家 为 他 们 祷 告 说 ， 凡 专 心 寻 求 神 ， 就 是 耶 和 华 他 列 祖 之 神 的 ， 虽 不 照 着 圣 所 洁 净 之 礼 自 洁 ， 求 至 善 的 耶 和 华 也 饶 恕 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one \\n\\n [bbe] For a great number of the people from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not made themselves clean, but they took the Passover meal, though not in the right way. For Hezekiah had made prayer for them, saying, May the good Lord have mercy on everyone \\n\\n 30:19 [hgb] \\n\\n [kjv] That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary. \\n\\n [bbe] Who, with all his heart, is turned to God the Lord, the God of his fathers, even if he has not been made clean after the rules of the holy place. \\n\\n 30:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 垂 听 希 西 家 的 祷 告 ， 就 饶 恕 （ 原 文 作 医 治 ） 百 姓 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord gave ear to Hezekiah, and made the people well. \\n\\n 30:21 [hgb] 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 以 色 列 人 大 大 喜 乐 ， 守 除 酵 节 七 日 。 利 未 人 和 祭 司 用 响 亮 的 乐 器 ， 日 日 颂 赞 耶 和 华 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] So the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with great joy: and the Levites and the priests gave praise to the Lord day by day, making melody to the Lord with loud instruments. \\n\\n 30:22 [hgb] 希 西 家 慰 劳 一 切 善 于 事 奉 耶 和 华 的 利 未 人 。 于 是 众 人 吃 节 筵 七 日 ， 又 献 平 安 祭 ， 且 向 耶 和 华 他 们 列 祖 的 神 认 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers. \\n\\n [bbe] And Hezekiah said kind words to the Levites who were expert in the ordering of the worship of the Lord: so they kept the feast for seven days, offering peace-offerings and praising the Lord, the God of their fathers. \\n\\n 30:23 [hgb] 全 会 众 商 议 ， 要 再 守 节 七 日 。 于 是 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 又 守 节 七 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness. \\n\\n [bbe] And by the desire of all the people, the feast went on for another seven days, and they kept the seven days with joy. \\n\\n 30:24 [hgb] 犹 大 王 希 西 家 赐 给 会 众 公 牛 一 千 只 ， 羊 七 千 只 为 祭 物 。 众 首 领 也 赐 给 会 众 公 牛 一 千 只 ， 羊 一 万 只 ， 并 有 许 多 的 祭 司 洁 净 自 己 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. \\n\\n [bbe] For Hezekiah, king of Judah, gave to the people for offerings, a thousand oxen and seven thousand sheep; and the rulers gave a thousand oxen and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests made themselves holy. \\n\\n 30:25 [hgb] 犹 大 全 会 众 ， 祭 司 ， 利 未 人 ， 并 那 从 以 色 列 地 来 的 会 众 和 寄 居 的 人 ， 以 及 犹 大 寄 居 的 人 ， 尽 都 喜 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the people of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and those who had come from Israel, and men from other lands who had come from Israel or who were living in Judah, were glad with great joy. \\n\\n 30:26 [hgb] 这 样 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 大 有 喜 乐 ， 自 从 以 色 列 王 大 卫 儿 子 所 罗 门 的 时 候 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 没 有 这 样 的 喜 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. \\n\\n [bbe] So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for nothing like this had been seen in Jerusalem from the time of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel. \\n\\n 30:27 [hgb] 那 时 ， 祭 司 ， 利 未 人 起 来 ， 为 民 祝 福 。 他 们 的 声 音 蒙 神 垂 听 ， 他 们 的 祷 告 达 到 天 上 的 圣 所 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the priests and the Levites gave the people a blessing: and the voice of their prayer went up to the holy place of God in heaven. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1527.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
