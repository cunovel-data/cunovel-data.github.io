{"id":7114,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 [kjv] And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. [bbe] And Solomon, the son of David, made himself strong in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and made him very great. 1:2 [hgb] 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 千 夫 长 ， 百 夫 长 ， 审 判 官 ， 首 领 与 族 长 都 来 。 [kjv] Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers. [bbe] And Solomon sent word to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every chief in all Israel, heads of their families. 1:3 [hgb] 所 罗 门 和 会 众 都 往 基 遍 的 丘 坛 去 ， 因 那 里 有 神 的 会 幕 ， 就 是 耶 和 华 仆 人 摩 西 在 旷 野 所 制 造 的 。 [kjv] So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness. [bbe] Then Solomon, and all the men of Israel with him, went to the high place at Gibeon, because the Tent of meeting of God, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had made in the waste land, was there. 1:4 [hgb] 只 是 神 的 约 柜 ， 大 卫 已 经 从 基 列 耶 琳 搬 到 他 所 预 备 的 地 方 ， 因 他 曾 在 耶 路 撒 冷 为 约 柜 支 搭 了 帐 幕 ， [kjv] But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. [bbe] But the ark of God had been moved by David from Kiriath-jearim to the place which he had made ready for it, for he had put up a tent for it at Jerusalem. 1:5 [hgb] 并 且 户 珥 的 孙 子 ， 乌 利 的 儿 子 比 撒 列 所 造 的 铜 坛 也 在 基 遍 耶 和 华 的 会 幕 前 。 所 罗 门 和 会 众 都 就 近 坛 前 。 [kjv] Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it. [bbe] And the altar of brass which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the Tent of the Lord; and Solomon and all the people went to give worship there. 1:6 [hgb] 所 罗 门 上 到 耶 和 华 面 前 会 幕 的 铜 坛 那 里 ， 献 一 千 牺 牲 为 燔 祭 。 [kjv] And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it. [bbe] And Solomon went up there to the brass altar before the Lord at the Tent of meeting, offering on it a thousand burned offerings. 1:7 [hgb] 当 夜 ， 神 向 所 罗 门 显 现 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 愿 我 赐 你 什 么 ， 你 可 以 求 。 [kjv] In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee. [bbe] In that night God came to Solomon in a vision, and said to him, Say what I am to give you. 1:8 [hgb] 所 罗 门 对 神 说 ， 你 曾 向 我 父 大 卫 大 施 慈 爱 ， 使 我 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead. [bbe] And Solomon said to God, Great was your mercy to David my father, and you have made me king in his place. 1:9 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 阿 ， 现 在 求 你 成 就 向 我 父 大 卫 所 应 许 的 话 。 因 你 立 我 作 这 民 的 王 ， 他 们 如 同 地 上 尘 沙 那 样 多 。 [kjv] Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. [bbe] Now, O Lord God, let your word to David my father come true; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in number. 1:10 [hgb] 求 你 赐 我 智 慧 聪 明 ， 我 好 在 这 民 前 出 入 。 不 然 ， 谁 能 判 断 这 众 多 的 民 呢 ？ [kjv] Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? [bbe] Give me now wisdom and knowledge, so that I may go out and come in before this people: for who is able to be the judge of this great people of yours? 1:11 [hgb] 神 对 所 罗 门 说 ， 我 已 立 你 作 我 民 的 王 。 你 既 有 这 心 意 ， 并 不 求 资 财 ， 丰 富 ， 尊 荣 ， 也 不 求 灭 绝 那 恨 你 之 人 的 性 命 ， 又 不 求 大 寿 数 ， 只 求 智 慧 聪 明 好 判 断 我 的 民 。 [kjv] And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: [bbe] And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you did not make request for money, property, or honour, or for the destruction of your haters, or for long life; but you have made request for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, so that you may be the judge of my people over whom I have made you king: 1:12 [hgb] 我 必 赐 你 智 慧 聪 明 ， 也 必 赐 你 资 财 ， 丰 富 ， 尊 荣 。 在 你 以 前 的 列 王 都 没 有 这 样 ， 在 你 以 后 也 必 没 有 这 样 的 。 [kjv] Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like. [bbe] Wisdom and knowledge are given to you; and I will give you wealth and honour, such as no king has had before you or ever will have after you. 1:13 [hgb] 于 是 ， 所 罗 门 从 基 遍 丘 坛 会 幕 前 回 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 治 理 以 色 列 人 。 [kjv] Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel. [bbe] So Solomon went back from the high place at Gibeon, from before the Tent of meeting, to Jerusalem; and he was king over Israel. 1:14 [hgb] 所 罗 门 聚 集 战 车 马 兵 ， 有 战 车 一 千 四 百 辆 ， 马 兵 一 万 二 千 名 ， 安 置 在 屯 车 的 城 邑 和 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 就 是 王 那 里 。 [kjv] And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. [bbe] And Solomon got together war-carriages and horsemen; he had one thousand, four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen, which he kept, some in the carriage-towns and some with the king at Jerusalem. 1:15 [hgb] 王 在 耶 路 撒 冷 使 金 银 多 如 石 头 ， 香 柏 木 多 如 高 原 的 桑 树 。 [kjv] And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance. [bbe] And the king made silver and gold as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedar like the sycamore-trees of the lowland in number. 1:16 [hgb] 所 罗 门 的 马 是 从 埃 及 带 来 的 ， 是 王 的 商 人 一 群 一 群 按 着 定 价 买 来 的 。 [kjv] And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king\u0027s merchants received the linen yarn at a price. [bbe] And Solomon\u0027s horses came out of Egypt; the king\u0027s traders got them from Kue at a price. 1:17 [hgb] 他 们 从 埃 及 买 来 的 车 ， 每 辆 价 银 七 百 舍 客 勒 ， 马 每 匹 一 百 五 十 舍 客 勒 。 赫 人 诸 王 和 亚 兰 诸 王 所 买 的 车 马 ， 也 是 按 这 价 值 经 他 们 手 买 来 的 。 [kjv] And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means. [bbe] A war-carriage might be got from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1424.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
