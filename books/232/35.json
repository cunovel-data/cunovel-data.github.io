Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand, six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen. \n 35:9 [hgb] 利 未 人 的 族 长 歌 楠 雅 和 他 两 个 兄 弟 示 玛 雅 ， 拿 坦 业 ， 与 哈 沙 比 雅 ， 耶 利 ， 约 撒 拔 将 羊 羔 五 千 只 ， 牛 五 百 只 ， 给 利 未 人 作 逾 越 节 的 祭 物 。 \n [kjv] Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen. \n [bbe] And Conaniah and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen. \n 35:10 [hgb] 这 样 ， 供 献 的 事 齐 备 了 。 祭 司 站 在 自 己 的 地 方 ， 利 未 人 按 着 班 次 站 立 ， 都 是 照 王 所 吩 咐 的 。 \n [kjv] So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king\u0027s commandment. \n [bbe] So everything was made ready and the priests took their places with the Levites in their divisions, as the king had said. \n 35:11 [hgb] 利 未 人 宰 了 逾 越 节 的 羊 羔 ， 祭 司 从 他 们 手 里 接 过 血 来 洒 在 坛 上 。 利 未 人 剥 皮 ， \n [kjv] And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them. \n [bbe] And they put the Passover lambs to death, the blood being drained out by the priests when it was given to them, and the Levites did the skinning. \n 35:12 [hgb] 将 燔 祭 搬 来 ， 按 着 宗 族 的 班 次 分 给 众 民 ， 好 照 摩 西 书 上 所 写 的 ， 献 给 耶 和 华 。 献 牛 也 是 这 样 。 \n [kjv] And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen. \n [bbe] And they took away the burned offerings, so that they might give them to be offered to the Lord for the divisions of the families of the people, as it is recorded in the book of Moses. And they did the same with the oxen. \n 35:13 [hgb] 他 们 按 着 常 例 ， 用 火 烤 逾 越 节 的 羊 羔 。 别 的 圣 物 用 锅 ， 用 釜 ， 用 罐 煮 了 ， 速 速 地 送 给 众 民 。 \n [kjv] And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people. \n [bbe] And the Passover lamb was cooked over the fire, as it says in the law; and the holy offerings were cooked in pots and basins and vessels, and taken quickly to all the people. \n 35:14 [hgb] 然 后 为 自 己 和 祭 司 预 备 祭 物 。 因 为 祭 司 亚 伦 的 子 孙 献 燔 祭 和 脂 油 ， 直 到 晚 上 。 所 以 利 未 人 为 自 己 和 祭 司 亚 伦 的 子 孙 ， 预 备 祭 物 。 \n [kjv] And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron. \n [bbe] And after that, they made ready for themselves and for the priests; for the priests, the sons of Aaron, were offering the burned offerings and the fat till night; so the Levites made ready what was needed for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron. \n 35:15 [hgb] 歌 唱 的 亚 萨 之 子 孙 ， 照 着 大 卫 ， 亚 萨 ， 希 幔 ， 和 王 的 先 见 耶 杜 顿 所 吩 咐 的 ， 站 在 自 己 的 地 位 上 。 守 门 的 看 守 各 门 ， 不 用 离 开 他 们 的 职 事 ， 因 为 他 们 的 弟 兄 利 未 人 给 他 们 预 备 祭 物 。 \n [kjv] And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king\u0027s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. \n [bbe] And the sons of Asaph, the makers of melody, were in their places, as ordered by David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, the king\u0027s seer; and the door-keepers were stationed at every door: there was no need for them to go away from their places, for their brothers the Levites made ready for them. \n 35:16 [hgb] 当 日 ， 供 奉 耶 和 华 的 事 齐 备 了 ， 就 照 约 西 亚 王 的 吩 咐 守 逾 越 节 ， 献 燔 祭 在 耶 和 华 的 坛 上 。 \n [kjv] So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah. \n [bbe] So everything needed for the worship of the Lord was made ready that same day, for the keeping of the Passover and the offering of burned offerings on the altar of the Lord, as King Josiah had given orders. \n 35:17 [hgb] 当 时 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 以 色 列 人 守 逾 越 节 ， 又 守 除 酵 节 七 日 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. \n [bbe] And all the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread at that time for seven days. \n 35:18 [hgb] 自 从 先 知 撒 母 耳 以 来 ， 在 以 色 列 中 没 有 守 过 这 样 的 逾 越 节 ， 以 色 列 诸 王 也 没 有 守 过 ， 像 约 西 亚 ， 祭 司 ， 利 未 人 ， 在 那 里 的 犹 大 人 ， 和 以 色 列 人 ， 以 及 耶 路 撒 冷 居 民 所 守 的 逾 越 节 。 \n [kjv] And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. \n [bbe] No Passover like it had been kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; and not one of the kings of Israel had ever kept a Passover like the one kept by Josiah and the priests and the Levites and all those of Judah and Israel who were present, and the people of Jerusalem. \n 35:19 [hgb] 这 逾 越 节 是 约 西 亚 作 王 十 八 年 守 的 。 \n [kjv] In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept. \n [bbe] In the eighteenth year of the rule of Josiah this Passover was kept. \n 35:20 [hgb] 这 事 以 后 ， 约 西 亚 修 完 了 殿 ， 有 埃 及 王 尼 哥 上 来 ， 要 攻 击 靠 近 伯 拉 河 的 迦 基 米 施 。 约 西 亚 出 去 抵 挡 他 。 \n [kjv] After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him. \n [bbe] After all this, and after Josiah had put the house in order, Neco, king of Egypt, went up to make war at Carchemish by the river Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him. \n 35:21 [hgb] 他 差 遣 使 者 来 见 约 西 亚 ， 说 ， 犹 大 王 阿 ， 我 与 你 何 干 。 我 今 日 来 不 是 要 攻 击 你 ， 乃 是 要 攻 击 与 我 争 战 之 家 ， 并 且 神 吩 咐 我 速 行 ， 你 不 要 干 预 神 的 事 ， 免 得 他 毁 灭 你 ， 因 为 神 是 与 我 同 在 。 \n [kjv] But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not. \n [bbe] But he sent representatives to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Judah? I have not come against you this day, but against those with whom I am at war; and God has given me orders to go forward quickly: keep out of God\u0027s way, for he is with me, or he will send destruction on you. \n 35:22 [hgb] 约 西 亚 却 不 肯 转 去 离 开 他 ， 改 装 要 与 他 打 仗 ， 不 听 从 神 借 尼 哥 之 口 所 说 的 话 ， 便 来 到 米 吉 多 平 原 争 战 。 \n [kjv] Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. \n [bbe] However, Josiah would not go back; but keeping to his purpose of fighting against him, and giving no attention to the words of Neco, which came from God, he went forward to the fight in the valley of Megiddo. \n 35:23 [hgb] 弓 箭 手 射 中 约 西 亚 王 。 王 对 他 的 臣 仆 说 ， 我 受 了 重 伤 ， 你 拉 我 出 阵 吧 。 \n [kjv] And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded. \n [bbe] And the bowmen sent their arrows at King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am badly wounded. \n 35:24 [hgb] 他 的 臣 仆 扶 他 下 了 战 车 ， 上 了 次 车 ， 送 他 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 他 就 死 了 ， 葬 在 他 列 祖 的 坟 墓 里 。 犹 大 人 和 耶 路 撒 冷 人 都 为 他 悲 哀 。 \n [kjv] His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. \n [bbe] So his servants took him out of the line of war-carriages, and put him in his second carriage and took him to Jerusalem, where he came to his end, and they put his body in the resting-place of his fathers. And in all Judah and Jerusalem there was great weeping for Josiah. \n 35:25 [hgb] 耶 利 米 为 约 西 亚 作 哀 歌 。 所 有 歌 唱 的 男 女 也 唱 哀 歌 ， 追 悼 约 西 亚 ， 直 到 今 日 。 而 且 在 以 色 列 中 成 了 定 例 。 这 歌 载 在 哀 歌 书 上 。 \n [kjv] And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations. \n [bbe] And Jeremiah made a song of grief for Josiah; and to this day Josiah is named by all the makers of melody, men and women, in their songs of grief; they made it a rule in Israel; and the songs are recorded among the songs of grief. \n 35:26 [hgb] 约 西 亚 其 余 的 事 和 他 遵 着 耶 和 华 律 法 上 所 记 而 行 的 善 事 ， \n [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD, \n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and the good he did, in keeping with what is recorded in the law of the Lord, \n 35:27 [hgb] 并 他 自 始 至 终 所 行 的 ， 都 写 在 以 色 列 和 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 \n [kjv] And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. \n [bbe] And all his acts, first and last, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1532.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
