[bbe] Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. 26:2 [hgb] 亚 玛 谢 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 之 后 ， 乌 西 雅 收 回 以 禄 仍 归 犹 大 ， 又 重 新 修 理 。 [kjv] He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. [bbe] He was the builder of Eloth, which he got back for Judah after the death of the king. 26:3 [hgb] 乌 西 雅 登 基 的 时 候 年 十 六 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 五 十 二 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 耶 可 利 雅 ， 是 耶 路 撒 冷 人 。 [kjv] Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother\u0027s name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. [bbe] Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for fifty-two years; his mother\u0027s name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem. 26:4 [hgb] 乌 西 雅 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 效 法 他 父 亚 玛 谢 一 切 所 行 的 。 [kjv] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did. [bbe] He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done. 26:5 [hgb] 通 晓 神 默 示 ， 撒 迦 利 亚 在 世 的 时 候 ， 乌 西 雅 定 意 寻 求 神 。 他 寻 求 耶 和 华 ， 神 就 使 他 亨 通 。 [kjv] And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper. [bbe] He gave himself to searching after God in the days of Zechariah, who made men wise in the fear of God; and as long as he was true to the Lord, God made things go well for him. 26:6 [hgb] 他 出 去 攻 击 非 利 士 人 ， 拆 毁 了 迦 特 城 ， 雅 比 尼 城 ， 和 亚 实 突 城 。 在 非 利 士 人 中 ， 在 亚 实 突 境 内 ， 又 建 筑 了 些 城 。 [kjv] And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines. [bbe] He went out and made war against the Philistines, pulling down the walls of Gath and Jabneh and Ashdod, and building towns in the country round Ashdod and among the Philistines. 26:7 [hgb] 神 帮 助 他 攻 击 非 利 士 人 和 住 在 姑 珥 巴 力 的 亚 拉 伯 人 ， 并 米 乌 尼 人 。 [kjv] And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims. [bbe] And God gave him help against the Philistines, and against the Arabians living in Gur-baal, and against the Meunim. 26:8 [hgb] 亚 扪 人 给 乌 西 雅 进 贡 。 他 的 名 声 传 到 埃 及 ， 因 他 甚 是 强 盛 。 [kjv] And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly. [bbe] The Ammonites gave offerings to Uzziah: and news of him went out as far as the limit of Egypt; for he became very great in power. 26:9 [hgb] 乌 西 雅 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 角 门 和 谷 门 ， 并 城 墙 转 弯 之 处 ， 建 筑 城 楼 ， 且 甚 坚 固 。 [kjv] Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them. [bbe] Uzziah made towers in Jerusalem, at the doorway in the angle and at the doorway in the valley and at the turn of the wall, arming them. 26:10 [hgb] 又 在 旷 野 与 高 原 和 平 原 ， 建 筑 望 楼 ， 挖 了 许 多 井 ， 因 他 的 牲 畜 甚 多 。 又 在 山 地 和 佳 美 之 地 ， 有 农 夫 和 修 理 葡 萄 园 的 人 ， 因 为 他 喜 悦 农 事 。 [kjv] Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry. [bbe] And he put up towers in the waste land and made places for storing water, for he had much cattle, in the low hills and in the table land; and he had farmers and vine-keepers in the mountains and in the fertile land, for he was a lover of farming. 26:11 [hgb] 乌 西 雅 又 有 军 兵 ， 照 书 记 耶 利 和 官 长 玛 西 雅 所 数 点 的 ， 在 王 的 一 个 将 军 哈 拿 尼 雅 手 下 ， 分 队 出 战 。 [kjv] Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king\u0027s captains. [bbe] In addition, Uzziah had an army of fighting-men who went out to war in bands, as they had been listed by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the authority of Hananiah, one of the king\u0027s captains. 26:12 [hgb] 族 长 ， 大 能 勇 士 的 总 数 共 有 二 千 六 百 人 ， [kjv] The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred. [bbe] The heads of families, the strong men of war, were two thousand, six hundred. 26:13 [hgb] 他 们 手 下 的 军 兵 共 有 三 十 万 七 千 五 百 人 ， 都 有 大 能 ， 善 于 争 战 ， 帮 助 王 攻 击 仇 敌 。 [kjv] And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. [bbe] And under their orders was a trained army of three hundred and seven thousand, five hundred, of great strength in war, helping the king against any who came against him. 26:14 [hgb] 乌 西 雅 为 全 军 预 备 盾 牌 ， 枪 ， 盔 ， 甲 ， 弓 ， 和 甩 石 的 机 弦 ， [kjv] And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones. [bbe] And Uzziah had all these forces armed with body-covers and spears and head-covers and coats of metal and bows and stones for sending from leather bands. 26:15 [hgb] 又 在 耶 路 撒 冷 使 巧 匠 作 机 器 ， 安 在 城 楼 和 角 楼 上 ， 用 以 射 箭 发 石 。 乌 西 雅 的 名 声 传 到 远 方 。 因 为 他 得 了 非 常 的 帮 助 ， 甚 是 强 盛 。 [kjv] And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong. [bbe] And in Jerusalem he made machines, the invention of expert men, to be placed on the towers and angles of the walls for sending arrows and great stones. And his name was honoured far and wide; for he was greatly helped till he was strong. 26:16 [hgb] 他 既 强 盛 ， 就 心 高 气 傲 ， 以 致 行 事 邪 僻 ， 干 犯 耶 和 华 他 的 神 ， 进 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 要 在 香 坛 上 烧 香 。 [kjv] But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. [bbe] But when he had become strong, his heart was lifted up in pride, causing his destruction; and he did evil against the Lord his God; for he went into the Temple of the Lord for the purpose of burning perfumes on the altar of perfumes. 26:17 [hgb] 祭 司 亚 撒 利 雅 率 领 耶 和 华 勇 敢 的 祭 司 八 十 人 ， 跟 随 他 进 去 。 [kjv] And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men: [bbe] And Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty of the Lord\u0027s priests, who were strong men; 26:18 [hgb] 他 们 就 阻 挡 乌 西 雅 王 ， 对 他 说 ， 乌 西 雅 阿 ， 给 耶 和 华 烧 香 不 是 你 的 事 ， 乃 是 亚 伦 子 孙 承 接 圣 职 祭 司 的 事 。 你 出 圣 殿 吧 。 因 为 你 犯 了 罪 。 你 行 这 事 ， 耶 和 华 神 必 不 使 你 得 荣 耀 。 [kjv] And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God. [bbe] And they made protests to Uzziah the king, and said to him, The burning of perfumes, Uzziah, is not your business but that of the priests, the sons of Aaron, who have been made holy for this work: go out of the holy place, for you have done wrong, and it will not be to your honour before God. 26:19 [hgb] 乌 西 雅 就 发 怒 ， 手 拿 香 炉 要 烧 香 。 他 向 祭 司 发 怒 的 时 候 ， 在 耶 和 华 殿 中 香 坛 旁 众 祭 司 面 前 ， 额 上 忽 然 发 出 大 麻 疯 。 [kjv] Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar. [bbe] Then Uzziah was angry; and he had in his hand a vessel for burning perfume; and while his wrath was bitter against the priests, the mark of the leper\u0027s disease came out on his brow, before the eyes of the priests in the house of the Lord by the altar of perfumes. 26:20 [hgb] 大 祭 司 亚 撒 利 雅 和 众 祭 司 观 看 ， 见 他 额 上 发 出 大 麻 疯 ， 就 催 他 出 殿 。 他 自 己 也 急 速 出 去 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 降 灾 与 他 。 [kjv] And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him. [bbe] And Azariah, the chief priest, and all the priests, looking at him, saw the mark of the leper on his brow, and they sent him out quickly and he himself went out straight away, for the Lord\u0027s punishment had come on him. 26:21 [hgb] 乌 西 雅 王 长 大 麻 疯 直 到 死 日 ， 因 此 住 在 别 的 宫 里 ， 与 耶 和 华 的 殿 隔 绝 。 他 儿 子 约 坦 管 理 家 事 ， 治 理 国 民 。 [kjv] And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king\u0027s house, judging the people of the land. [bbe] So King Uzziah was a leper till the day of his death, living separately in his private house; for he was cut off from the house of God; and Jotham his son was ruling over his house, judging the people of the land. 26:22 [hgb] 乌 西 雅 其 余 的 事 ， 自 始 至 终 都 是 亚 摩 斯 的 儿 子 先 知 以 赛 亚 所 记 的 。 [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, were recorded by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 26:23 [hgb] 乌 西 雅 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 王 陵 的 田 间 他 列 祖 的 坟 地 里 。 因 为 人 说 ， 他 是 长 大 麻 疯 的 。 他 儿 子 约 坦 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] So Uzziah went to rest with his fathers; and they put his body into the earth in the field used for the resting-place of the kings, for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son became king in his place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1523.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
