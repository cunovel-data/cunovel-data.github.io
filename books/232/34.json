[bbe] Josiah was eight years old when he became king; he was ruling in Jerusalem for thirty-one years. 34:2 [hgb] 他 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 效 法 他 祖 大 卫 所 行 的 ， 不 偏 左 右 。 [kjv] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left. [bbe] And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, walking in the ways of his father David, without turning to the right hand or to the left. 34:3 [hgb] 他 作 王 第 八 年 ， 尚 且 年 幼 ， 就 寻 求 他 祖 大 卫 的 神 。 到 了 十 二 年 才 洁 净 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 除 掉 丘 坛 ， 木 偶 ， 雕 刻 的 像 ， 和 铸 造 的 像 。 [kjv] For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. [bbe] In the eighth year of his rule, while he was still young, his heart was first turned to the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he undertook the clearing away of all the high places and the pillars and the images of wood and metal from Judah and Jerusalem. 34:4 [hgb] 众 人 在 他 面 前 拆 毁 巴 力 的 坛 ， 砍 断 坛 上 高 高 的 日 像 ， 又 把 木 偶 和 雕 刻 的 像 ， 并 铸 造 的 像 打 碎 成 灰 ， 撒 在 祭 偶 像 人 的 坟 上 ， [kjv] And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. [bbe] He had the altars of the Baals broken down, while he himself was present; and the sun-images which were placed on high over them he had cut down; and the pillars of wood and the metal images he had broken up and crushed to dust, dropping the dust over the resting-places of the dead who had made offerings to them. 34:5 [hgb] 将 他 们 祭 司 的 骸 骨 烧 在 坛 上 ， 洁 净 了 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. [bbe] And he had the bones of the priests burned on their altars, and so he made Judah and Jerusalem clean. 34:6 [hgb] 又 在 玛 拿 西 ， 以 法 莲 ， 西 缅 ， 拿 弗 他 利 各 城 ， 和 四 围 破 坏 之 处 ， 都 这 样 行 。 [kjv] And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about. [bbe] And in all the towns of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon as far as Naphtali, he made waste their houses round about. 34:7 [hgb] 又 拆 毁 祭 坛 ， 把 木 偶 和 雕 刻 的 像 打 碎 成 灰 ， 砍 断 以 色 列 遍 地 所 有 的 日 像 ， 就 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 了 。 [kjv] And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem. [bbe] He had the altars and the pillars of wood pulled down and the images crushed to dust, and all the sun-images cut down, through all the land of Israel, and then he went back to Jerusalem. 34:8 [hgb] 约 西 亚 王 十 八 年 ， 净 地 净 殿 之 后 ， 就 差 遣 亚 萨 利 雅 的 儿 子 沙 番 ， 邑 宰 玛 西 雅 ， 约 哈 斯 的 儿 子 史 官 约 亚 去 修 理 耶 和 华 他 神 的 殿 。 [kjv] Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. [bbe] Now in the eighteenth year of his rule, when the land and the house had been made clean, he sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah, the ruler of the town, and Joah, the son of Joahaz, the recorder, to make good what was damaged in the house of the Lord his God. 34:9 [hgb] 他 们 就 去 见 大 祭 司 希 勒 家 ， 将 奉 到 神 殿 的 银 子 交 给 他 。 这 银 子 是 看 守 殿 门 的 利 未 人 从 玛 拿 西 ， 以 法 莲 ， 和 一 切 以 色 列 剩 下 的 人 ， 以 及 犹 大 ， 便 雅 悯 众 人 ， 并 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 收 来 的 。 [kjv] And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem. [bbe] And they came to Hilkiah, the chief priest, and gave him all the money which had been taken into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the door, had got from Manasseh and Ephraim and those of Israel who had not been taken away as prisoners, and from all Judah and Benjamin and the people of Jerusalem. 34:10 [hgb] 又 将 这 银 子 交 给 耶 和 华 殿 里 督 工 的 ， 转 交 修 理 耶 和 华 殿 的 工 匠 ， [kjv] And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house: [bbe] And they gave it to the overseers of the work of the Lord\u0027s house, and the overseers gave it to the workmen working in the house, for building it up and making good what was damaged; 34:11 [hgb] 就 是 交 给 木 匠 ， 石 匠 ， 买 凿 成 的 石 头 和 架 木 与 栋 梁 ， 修 犹 大 王 所 毁 坏 的 殿 。 [kjv] Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. [bbe] Even to the woodworkers and builders to get cut stone and wood for joining the structure together and for making boards for the houses which the kings of Judah had given up to destruction. 34:12 [hgb] 这 些 人 办 事 诚 实 ， 督 工 的 是 利 未 人 米 拉 利 的 子 孙 雅 哈 ， 俄 巴 底 。 督 催 的 是 哥 辖 的 子 孙 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 米 书 兰 。 还 有 善 于 作 乐 的 利 未 人 。 [kjv] And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick. [bbe] And the men did the work well; and those who had authority over them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, who were to be responsible for seeing that the work was done; and others of the Levites, who were expert with instruments of music, 34:13 [hgb] 他 们 又 监 管 扛 抬 的 人 ， 督 催 一 切 作 工 的 。 利 未 人 中 也 有 作 书 记 ， 作 司 事 ， 作 守 门 的 。 [kjv] Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters. [bbe] Had authority over the transport workers, giving directions to all who were doing any sort of work; and among the Levites there were scribes and overseers and door-keepers. 34:14 [hgb] 他 们 将 奉 到 耶 和 华 殿 的 银 子 运 出 来 的 时 候 ， 祭 司 希 勒 家 偶 然 得 了 摩 西 所 传 耶 和 华 的 律 法 书 。 [kjv] And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses. [bbe] Now when they were taking out the money which had come into the Lord\u0027s house, Hilkiah the priest came across the book of the law of the Lord, which he had given by the mouth of Moses. 34:15 [hgb] 希 勒 家 对 书 记 沙 番 说 ， 我 在 耶 和 华 殿 里 得 了 律 法 书 。 遂 将 书 递 给 沙 番 。 [kjv] And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. [bbe] Then Hilkiah said to Shaphan the scribe, I have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan. 34:16 [hgb] 沙 番 把 书 拿 到 王 那 里 ， 回 覆 王 说 ， 凡 交 给 仆 人 们 办 的 都 办 理 了 。 [kjv] And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it. [bbe] And Shaphan took the book to the king; and he gave him an account of what had been done, saying, Your servants are doing all they have been given to do; 34:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 殿 里 的 银 子 倒 出 来 ， 交 给 督 工 的 和 匠 人 的 手 里 了 。 [kjv] And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen. [bbe] They have taken out all the money which was in the Lord\u0027s house and have given it to the overseers and to the workmen. 34:18 [hgb] 书 记 沙 番 又 对 王 说 ， 祭 司 希 勒 家 递 给 我 一 卷 书 。 沙 番 就 在 王 面 前 读 那 书 。 [kjv] Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. [bbe] Then Shaphan the scribe said to the king, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book; and he made a start at reading some of it to the king. 34:19 [hgb] 王 听 见 律 法 上 的 话 ， 就 撕 裂 衣 服 ， [kjv] And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes. [bbe] And the king, hearing the words of the law, took his robe in his hands, violently parting it as a sign of his grief. 34:20 [hgb] 吩 咐 希 勒 家 与 沙 番 的 儿 子 亚 希 甘 ， 米 迦 的 儿 子 亚 比 顿 ， 书 记 沙 番 ， 和 王 的 臣 仆 亚 撒 雅 说 ， [kjv] And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king\u0027s, saying, [bbe] And he gave orders to Hilkiah and to Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Abdon, the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah, the king\u0027s servant, saying, 34:21 [hgb] 你 们 去 为 我 ， 为 以 色 列 和 犹 大 剩 下 的 人 ， 以 这 书 上 的 话 求 问 耶 和 华 。 因 我 们 列 祖 没 有 遵 守 耶 和 华 的 言 语 ， 没 有 照 这 书 上 所 记 的 去 行 ， 耶 和 华 的 烈 怒 就 倒 在 我 们 身 上 。 [kjv] Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book. [bbe] Go and get directions from the Lord for me and for those who are still in Israel and for Judah, about the words of this book which has come to light; for great is the wrath of the Lord which has been let loose on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord or done what is recorded in this book. 34:22 [hgb] 于 是 ， 希 勒 家 和 王 所 派 的 众 人 都 去 见 女 先 知 户 勒 大 。 户 勒 大 是 掌 管 礼 服 沙 龙 的 妻 ， 沙 龙 是 哈 斯 拉 的 孙 子 ， 特 瓦 的 儿 子 。 户 勒 大 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 第 二 区 。 他 们 请 问 于 她 。 [kjv] And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect. [bbe] So Hilkiah, and those whom the king sent, went to Huldah the woman prophet, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the robes (now she was living in Jerusalem, in the second part of the town); and they had talk with her about this thing. 34:23 [hgb] 她 对 他 们 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 你 们 可 以 回 覆 那 差 遣 你 们 来 见 我 的 人 说 ， [kjv] And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me, [bbe] And she said to them, The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, Say to the man who sent you to me, 34:24 [hgb] 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 必 照 着 在 犹 大 王 面 前 所 读 那 书 上 的 一 切 咒 诅 ， 降 祸 与 这 地 和 其 上 的 居 民 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah: [bbe] These are the words of the Lord: See, I will send evil on this place and on its people, even all the curses in the book which they have been reading before the king of Judah; 34:25 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 离 弃 我 ， 向 别 神 烧 香 ， 用 他 们 手 所 作 的 惹 我 发 怒 ， 所 以 我 的 忿 怒 如 火 倒 在 这 地 上 ， 总 不 息 灭 。 [kjv] Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched. [bbe] Because they have given me up, burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the works of their hands; so my wrath is let loose on this place and will not be put out. 34:26 [hgb] 然 而 差 遣 你 们 来 求 问 耶 和 华 的 犹 大 王 ， 你 们 要 这 样 回 覆 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 至 于 你 所 听 见 的 话 ， [kjv] And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard; [bbe] But to the king of Judah who sent you to get directions from the Lord, say, This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said: Because you have given ear to my words, 34:27 [hgb] 就 是 听 见 我 指 着 这 地 和 其 上 居 民 所 说 的 话 ， 你 便 心 里 敬 服 ， 在 我 面 前 自 卑 ， 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 向 我 哭 泣 ， 因 此 我 应 允 了 你 。 这 是 我 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD. [bbe] And your heart was soft, and you made yourself low before God, on hearing his words about this place and its people, and with weeping and signs of grief have made yourself low before me, I have given ear to you, says the Lord God. 34:28 [hgb] 我 必 使 你 平 平 安 安 地 归 到 坟 墓 ， 到 你 列 祖 那 里 ， 我 要 降 与 这 地 和 其 上 居 民 的 一 切 灾 祸 ， 你 也 不 至 亲 眼 看 见 。 他 们 就 回 覆 王 去 了 。 [kjv] Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again. [bbe] See, I will let you go to your fathers, and be put in your last resting-place in peace, and your eyes will not see all the evil which I will send on this place and on its people. So they took this news back to the king. 34:29 [hgb] 王 差 遣 人 招 聚 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 的 众 长 老 来 。 [kjv] Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. [bbe] Then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of Judah and of Jerusalem. 34:30 [hgb] 王 和 犹 大 众 人 ， 与 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 ， 并 祭 司 利 未 人 ， 以 及 所 有 的 百 姓 ， 无 论 大 小 ， 都 一 同 上 到 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 王 就 把 殿 里 所 得 的 约 书 念 给 他 们 听 。 [kjv] And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD. [bbe] And the king went up to the house of the Lord, with all the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem, and the priests and the Levites and all the people, small and great; and they were present at his reading of the book of the law which had come to light in the house of the Lord. 34:31 [hgb] 王 站 在 他 的 地 位 上 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 立 约 ， 要 尽 心 尽 性 地 顺 从 耶 和 华 ， 遵 守 他 的 诫 命 ， 法 度 ， 律 例 ， 成 就 这 书 上 所 记 的 约 言 。 [kjv] And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book. [bbe] Then the king, taking his place by the pillar, made an agreement before the Lord, to go in the way of the Lord, and to keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and with all his soul, and to keep the words of the agreement recorded in this book. 34:32 [hgb] 又 使 住 耶 路 撒 冷 和 便 雅 悯 的 人 都 服 从 这 约 。 于 是 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 都 遵 行 他 们 列 祖 之 神 的 约 。 [kjv] And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. [bbe] And he made all the people in Jerusalem and Benjamin give their word to keep it. And the people of Jerusalem kept the agreement of God, the God of their fathers. 34:33 [hgb] 约 西 亚 从 以 色 列 各 处 将 一 切 可 憎 之 物 尽 都 除 掉 ， 使 以 色 列 境 内 的 人 都 事 奉 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 。 约 西 亚 在 世 的 日 子 ， 就 跟 从 耶 和 华 他 们 列 祖 的 神 ， 总 不 离 开 。 [kjv] And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers. [bbe] Josiah took away all the disgusting things out of all the lands of the children of Israel, and made all who were in Israel servants of the Lord their God. And as long as he was living they were true to the Lord, the God of their fathers.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1531.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
