His mother\u0027s name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. [bbe] Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years; and his mother\u0027s name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 27:2 [hgb] 约 坦 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 效 法 他 父 乌 西 雅 一 切 所 行 的 ， 只 是 不 入 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 百 姓 还 行 邪 僻 的 事 。 [kjv] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly. [bbe] He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Uzziah had done; but he did not go into the Temple of the Lord. And the people still went on in their evil ways. 27:3 [hgb] 约 坦 建 立 耶 和 华 殿 的 上 门 ， 在 俄 斐 勒 城 上 多 有 建 造 ， [kjv] He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much. [bbe] He put up the higher doorway of the house of the Lord, and did much building on the wall of the Ophel. 27:4 [hgb] 又 在 犹 大 山 地 建 造 城 邑 ， 在 树 林 中 建 筑 营 寨 和 高 楼 。 [kjv] Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers. [bbe] In addition, he made towns in the hill-country of Judah, and strong buildings and towers in the woodlands. 27:5 [hgb] 约 坦 与 亚 扪 人 的 王 打 仗 胜 了 他 们 ， 当 年 他 们 进 贡 银 一 百 他 连 得 ， 小 麦 一 万 歌 珥 ， 大 麦 一 万 歌 珥 。 第 二 年 ， 第 三 年 也 是 这 样 。 [kjv] He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third. [bbe] He went to war with the king of the children of Ammon and overcame them. That year, the children of Ammon gave him a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of grain and ten thousand measures of barley. And the children of Ammon gave him the same amount the second year and the third. 27:6 [hgb] 约 坦 在 耶 和 华 他 神 面 前 行 正 道 ， 以 致 日 渐 强 盛 。 [kjv] So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God. [bbe] So Jotham became strong, because in all his ways he made the Lord his guide. 27:7 [hgb] 约 坦 其 余 的 事 和 一 切 争 战 ， 并 他 的 行 为 ， 都 写 在 以 色 列 和 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 27:8 [hgb] 他 登 基 的 时 候 年 二 十 五 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 十 六 年 。 [kjv] He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

[bbe] And Jotham went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the earth in the town of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1524.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
