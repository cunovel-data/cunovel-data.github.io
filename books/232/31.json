Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. \\n\\n [bbe] Now when all this was over, all the men of Israel who were present went out into the towns of Judah, causing the stone pillars to be broken up and the wood pillars to be cut down, pulling down the high places and the altars in all Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, till all were gone. Then all the children of Israel went back to their towns, every man to his property. \\n\\n 31:2 [hgb] 希 西 家 派 定 祭 司 利 未 人 的 班 次 ， 各 按 各 职 献 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 ， 又 在 耶 和 华 殿 （ 原 文 作 营 ） 门 内 事 奉 ， 称 谢 颂 赞 耶 和 华 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Hezekiah put in order the divisions of the priests and Levites, every man in his division, in relation to his work, for the burned offerings and peace-offerings, and for the ordering of worship and for giving praise at the doors of the Lord\u0027s house. \\n\\n 31:3 [hgb] 王 又 从 自 己 的 产 业 中 定 出 分 来 为 燔 祭 ， 就 是 早 晚 的 燔 祭 和 安 息 日 ， 月 朔 ， 并 节 期 的 燔 祭 ， 都 是 按 耶 和 华 律 法 上 所 载 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He appointed also the king\u0027s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] And he gave the king\u0027s part of his private property for the burned offerings, that is, for the morning and evening offerings, and the offerings for the Sabbath and the new moons and the regular feasts, as it is recorded in the law of the Lord. \\n\\n 31:4 [hgb] 又 吩 咐 住 耶 路 撒 冷 的 百 姓 将 祭 司 ， 利 未 人 所 应 得 的 分 给 他 们 ， 使 他 们 专 心 遵 守 耶 和 华 的 律 法 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] In addition, he gave orders to the people of Jerusalem to give to the priests and Levites that part which was theirs by right, so that they might be strong in keeping the law of the Lord. \\n\\n 31:5 [hgb] 谕 旨 一 出 ， 以 色 列 人 就 把 初 熟 的 五 谷 ， 新 酒 ， 油 ， 蜜 ， 和 田 地 的 出 产 多 多 送 来 ， 又 把 各 物 的 十 分 之 一 送 来 的 极 多 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the order was made public, straight away the children of Israel gave, in great amounts, the first-fruits of their grain and wine and oil and honey, and of the produce of their fields; and they took in a tenth part of everything, a great store. \\n\\n 31:6 [hgb] 住 犹 大 各 城 的 以 色 列 人 和 犹 大 人 也 将 牛 羊 的 十 分 之 一 ， 并 分 别 为 圣 归 耶 和 华 他 们 神 之 物 ， 就 是 十 分 取 一 之 物 ， 尽 都 送 来 ， 积 成 堆 垒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps. \\n\\n [bbe] And the children of Israel and Judah, who were living in the towns of Judah came with the tenth part of their oxen and sheep, and a tenth of all the holy things which were to be given to the Lord their God, and put them in great masses. \\n\\n 31:7 [hgb] 从 三 月 积 起 ， 到 七 月 才 完 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. \\n\\n [bbe] The first store of things was put down in the third month, and in the seventh month the masses were complete. \\n\\n 31:8 [hgb] 希 西 家 和 众 首 领 来 ， 看 见 堆 垒 ， 就 称 颂 耶 和 华 ， 又 为 耶 和 华 的 民 以 色 列 人 祝 福 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw all the store of goods, they gave praise to the Lord and to his people Israel. \\n\\n 31:9 [hgb] 希 西 家 向 祭 司 ， 利 未 人 查 问 这 堆 垒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Hezekiah put questions to the priests and Levites about the store of goods. \\n\\n 31:10 [hgb] 撒 督 家 的 大 祭 司 亚 撒 利 雅 回 答 说 ， 自 从 民 将 供 物 送 到 耶 和 华 殿 以 来 ， 我 们 不 但 吃 饱 ， 且 剩 下 的 甚 多 。 因 为 耶 和 华 赐 福 给 他 的 民 ， 所 剩 下 的 才 这 样 丰 盛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store. \\n\\n [bbe] And Azariah, the chief priest, of the family of Zadok, said in answer, From the time when the people first came with their offerings into the house of the Lord, we have had food enough, and more than enough: for the blessing of the Lord is on his people; and there is this great store which has not been used. \\n\\n 31:11 [hgb] 希 西 家 吩 咐 在 耶 和 华 殿 里 预 备 仓 房 ， 他 们 就 预 备 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them, \\n\\n [bbe] Then Hezekiah said that store-rooms were to be made ready in the house of the Lord; and this was done. \\n\\n 31:12 [hgb] 他 们 诚 心 将 供 物 和 十 分 取 一 之 物 ， 并 分 别 为 圣 之 物 ， 都 搬 入 仓 内 。 利 未 人 歌 楠 雅 掌 管 这 事 ， 他 兄 弟 示 每 为 副 管 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next. \\n\\n [bbe] And in them they put all the offerings and the tenths and the holy things, keeping nothing back, and over them was Conaniah the Levite, with Shimei his brother second to him. \\n\\n 31:13 [hgb] 耶 歇 ， 亚 撒 细 雅 ， 拿 哈 ， 亚 撒 黑 ， 耶 利 末 ， 约 撒 拔 ， 以 列 ， 伊 斯 玛 基 雅 ， 玛 哈 ， 比 拿 雅 都 是 督 理 ， 在 歌 楠 雅 和 他 兄 弟 示 每 的 手 下 ， 是 希 西 家 王 和 管 理 神 殿 的 亚 撒 利 雅 所 派 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jehiel and Azaziah and Nahath and Asahel and Jerimoth and Jozabad and Eliel and Ismachiah and Mahath and Benaiah were overseers, under the directions of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the order of Hezekiah the king and Azariah, the ruler of the house of God. \\n\\n 31:14 [hgb] 守 东 门 的 利 未 人 音 拿 的 儿 子 可 利 ， 掌 管 乐 意 献 与 神 的 礼 物 ， 发 放 献 与 耶 和 华 的 供 物 和 至 圣 的 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things. \\n\\n [bbe] And Kore, the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the east door, had control of the offerings freely given to God, and the distribution of the offerings of the Lord and the most holy things. \\n\\n 31:15 [hgb] 在 他 手 下 有 伊 甸 ， 珉 雅 珉 ， 耶 书 亚 ， 示 玛 雅 ， 亚 玛 利 雅 ， 示 迦 尼 雅 ， 在 祭 司 的 各 城 里 供 紧 要 的 职 任 ， 无 论 弟 兄 大 小 ， 都 按 着 班 次 分 给 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small: \\n\\n [bbe] And under him were Eden and Miniamin and Jeshua and Shemaiah and Amariah and Shecaniah, in the towns of the priests, who were made responsible for giving it to all their brothers, by divisions, to small and great: \\n\\n 31:16 [hgb] 按 家 谱 ， 三 岁 以 外 的 男 丁 ， 凡 每 日 进 耶 和 华 殿 ， 按 班 次 供 职 的 ， 也 分 给 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;
