In his days the land was quiet ten years. \n [bbe] So Abijah went to rest with his fathers, and they put him into the earth in the town of David, and Asa his son became king in his place; in his time the land was quiet for ten years. \n 14:2 [hgb] 亚 撒 行 耶 和 华 他 神 眼 中 看 为 善 为 正 的 事 ， \n [kjv] And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: \n [bbe] And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God; \n 14:3 [hgb] 除 掉 外 邦 神 的 坛 和 丘 坛 ， 打 碎 柱 像 ， 砍 下 木 偶 ， \n [kjv] For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: \n [bbe] For he took away the altars of strange gods and the high places, and had the upright stones broken and the wood pillars cut down; \n 14:4 [hgb] 吩 咐 犹 大 人 寻 求 耶 和 华 他 们 列 祖 的 神 ， 遵 行 他 的 律 法 ， 诫 命 。 \n [kjv] And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. \n [bbe] And he made Judah go after the Lord, the God of their fathers, and keep his laws and his orders. \n 14:5 [hgb] 又 在 犹 大 各 城 邑 除 掉 丘 坛 和 日 像 ， 那 时 国 享 太 平 。 \n [kjv] Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. \n [bbe] And he took away the high places and the sun-images from all the towns of Judah; and the kingdom was quiet under his rule. \n 14:6 [hgb] 又 在 犹 大 建 造 了 几 座 坚 固 城 。 国 中 太 平 数 年 ， 没 有 战 争 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 赐 他 平 安 。 \n [kjv] And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. \n [bbe] He made walled towns in Judah, for the land was quiet and there were no wars in those years, because the Lord had given him rest. \n 14:7 [hgb] 他 对 犹 大 人 说 ， 我 们 要 建 造 这 些 城 邑 ， 四 围 筑 墙 ， 盖 楼 ， 安 门 ， 作 闩 。 地 还 属 我 们 ， 是 因 寻 求 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 。 我 们 既 寻 求 他 ， 他 就 赐 我 们 四 境 平 安 。 于 是 建 造 城 邑 ， 诸 事 亨 通 。 \n [kjv] Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. \n [bbe] He said to Judah, Let us make these towns, building walls round them with towers and doors and locks. The land is still ours, because we have been true to the Lord our God; we have been true to him and he has given us rest on every side. So they went on building and all went well for them. \n 14:8 [hgb] 亚 撒 的 军 兵 ， 出 自 犹 大 拿 盾 牌 拿 枪 的 三 十 万 人 。 出 自 便 雅 悯 拿 盾 牌 拉 弓 的 二 十 八 万 人 。 这 都 是 大 能 的 勇 士 。 \n [kjv] And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour. \n [bbe] And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men of Judah armed with body-covers and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand of Benjamin armed with body-covers and bows; all these were men of war. \n 14:9 [hgb] 有 古 实 王 谢 拉 率 领 军 兵 一 百 万 ， 战 车 三 百 辆 ， 出 来 攻 击 犹 大 人 ， 到 了 玛 利 沙 。 \n [kjv] And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. \n [bbe] And Zerah the Ethiopian, with an army of a million, and three hundred war-carriages, came out against them to Mareshah. \n 14:10 [hgb] 于 是 亚 撒 出 去 与 他 迎 敌 ， 就 在 玛 利 沙 的 洗 法 谷 彼 此 摆 阵 。 \n [kjv] Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. \n [bbe] And Asa went out against him, and they put their forces in position in the valley north of Mareshah. \n 14:11 [hgb] 亚 撒 呼 求 耶 和 华 他 的 神 说 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 惟 有 你 能 帮 助 软 弱 的 ， 胜 过 强 盛 的 。 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 帮 助 我 们 。 因 为 我 们 仰 赖 你 ， 奉 你 的 名 来 攻 击 这 大 军 。 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 是 我 们 的 神 ， 不 要 容 人 胜 过 你 。 \n [kjv] And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. \n [bbe] And Asa made prayer to the Lord his God and said, Lord, you only are able to give help against the strong to him who has no strength; come to our help, O Lord our God, for our hope is in you, and in your name we have come out against this great army. O Lord, you are our God; let not man\u0027s power be greater than yours. \n 14:12 [hgb] 于 是 耶 和 华 使 古 实 人 败 在 亚 撒 和 犹 大 人 面 前 ， 古 实 人 就 逃 跑 了 。 \n [kjv] So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. \n [bbe] So the Lord sent fear on the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah; and the Ethiopians went in flight. \n 14:13 [hgb] 亚 撒 和 跟 随 他 的 军 兵 追 赶 他 们 ， 直 到 基 拉 耳 。 古 实 人 被 杀 的 甚 多 ， 不 能 再 强 盛 ， 因 为 败 在 耶 和 华 与 他 军 兵 面 前 。 犹 大 人 就 夺 了 许 多 财 物 ， \n [kjv] And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. \n [bbe] And Asa and the people who were with him went after them as far as Gerar; and so great was the destruction among the Ethiopians that they were not able to get their army together again, for they were broken before the Lord and before his army; and they took away a great amount of their goods. \n 14:14 [hgb] 又 打 破 基 拉 耳 四 围 的 城 邑 。 耶 和 华 使 其 中 的 人 都 甚 恐 惧 。 犹 大 人 又 将 所 有 的 城 掳 掠 一 空 ， 因 其 中 的 财 物 甚 多 ， \n [kjv] And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them. \n [bbe] And they overcame all the towns round Gerar, because the Lord sent fear on them; and they took away their goods from the towns, for there were stores of wealth in them. \n 14:15 [hgb] 又 毁 坏 了 群 畜 的 圈 ， 夺 取 许 多 的 羊 和 骆 驼 ， 就 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 了 。 \n [kjv] They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem. \n [bbe] And they made an attack on the tents of the owners of the cattle, and took away great numbers of sheep and camels and went back to Jerusalem. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1411.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
