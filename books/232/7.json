{"id":7120,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"7:1 [hgb] 所 罗 门 祈 祷 已 毕 ， 就 有 火 从 天 上 降 下 来 ， 烧 尽 燔 祭 和 别 的 祭 。 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 充 满 了 殿 。 [kjv] Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house. [bbe] Now when Solomon\u0027s prayers were ended, fire came down from heaven, burning up all the offerings; and the house was full of the glory of the Lord. 7:2 [hgb] 因 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 充 满 了 耶 和 华 殿 ， 所 以 祭 司 不 能 进 殿 。 [kjv] And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD\u0027s house. [bbe] And the priests were not able to go into the house of the Lord, for the Lord\u0027s house was full of the glory of the Lord. 7:3 [hgb] 那 火 降 下 ， 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 在 殿 上 的 时 候 ， 以 色 列 众 人 看 见 ， 就 在 铺 石 地 俯 伏 叩 拜 ， 称 谢 耶 和 华 说 ， 耶 和 华 本 为 善 ， 他 的 慈 爱 永 远 长 存 。 [kjv] And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. [bbe] And all the children of Israel were looking on when the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord was on the house; and they went down on their knees, with their faces to the earth, worshipping and praising the Lord, and saying, He is good; for his mercy is unchanging for ever. 7:4 [hgb] 王 和 众 民 在 耶 和 华 面 前 献 祭 。 [kjv] Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD. [bbe] Then the king and all the people made offerings before the Lord. 7:5 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 用 牛 二 万 二 千 ， 羊 十 二 万 献 祭 。 这 样 ， 王 和 众 民 为 神 的 殿 行 奉 献 之 礼 。 [kjv] And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. [bbe] King Solomon made an offering of twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people kept the feast of the opening of the house of God. 7:6 [hgb] 祭 司 侍 立 ， 各 供 其 职 。 利 未 人 也 拿 着 耶 和 华 的 乐 器 ， 就 是 大 卫 王 造 出 来 ， 借 利 未 人 颂 赞 耶 和 华 的 。 （ 他 的 慈 爱 永 远 长 存 。 ） 祭 司 在 众 人 面 前 吹 号 ， 以 色 列 人 都 站 立 。 [kjv] And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood. [bbe] And the priests were in their places, and the Levites with their instruments of music for the Lord\u0027s song, which David the king had made for the praise of the Lord whose mercy is unchanging for ever, when David gave praise by their hand; and the priests were sounding horns before them; and all Israel were on their feet. 7:7 [hgb] 所 罗 门 因 他 所 造 的 铜 坛 容 不 下 燔 祭 ， 素 祭 ， 和 脂 油 ， 便 将 耶 和 华 殿 前 院 子 当 中 分 别 为 圣 ， 在 那 里 献 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 牲 的 脂 油 。 [kjv] Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat. [bbe] Then Solomon made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the Lord, offering the burned offerings there, and the fat of the peace-offerings; for there was not room on the brass altar which Solomon had made for all the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat. 7:8 [hgb] 那 时 所 罗 门 和 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 从 哈 马 口 直 到 埃 及 小 河 ， 所 有 的 以 色 列 人 都 聚 集 成 为 大 会 ， 守 节 七 日 。 [kjv] Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. [bbe] So Solomon kept the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great meeting, for the people had come together from the way into Hamath and from as far as the river of Egypt. 7:9 [hgb] 第 八 日 设 立 严 肃 会 ， 行 奉 献 坛 的 礼 七 日 ， 守 节 七 日 。 [kjv] And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. [bbe] And on the eighth day they had a holy meeting; the offerings for making the altar holy went on for seven days, and the feast for seven days. 7:10 [hgb] 七 月 二 十 三 日 ， 王 遣 散 众 民 。 他 们 因 见 耶 和 华 向 大 卫 和 所 罗 门 与 他 民 以 色 列 所 施 的 恩 惠 ， 就 都 心 中 喜 乐 ， 各 归 各 家 去 了 。 [kjv] And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. [bbe] And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he sent the people away to their tents, full of joy and glad in their hearts, because of all the good which the Lord had done to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people. 7:11 [hgb] 所 罗 门 造 成 了 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 。 在 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 凡 他 心 中 所 要 作 的 ， 都 顺 顺 利 利 地 作 成 了 。 [kjv] Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king\u0027s house: and all that came into Solomon\u0027s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected. [bbe] So Solomon came to the end of building the house of the Lord and the king\u0027s house; and everything which it was in his mind to make in the house of the Lord and for himself had been well done. 7:12 [hgb] 夜 间 耶 和 华 向 所 罗 门 显 现 ， 对 他 说 ， 我 已 听 了 你 的 祷 告 ， 也 选 择 这 地 方 作 为 祭 祀 我 的 殿 宇 。 [kjv] And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice. [bbe] Now the Lord came to Solomon in a vision by night, and said to him, I have given ear to your prayer, and have taken this place for myself as a house where offerings are to be made. 7:13 [hgb] 我 若 使 天 闭 塞 不 下 雨 ， 或 使 蝗 虫 吃 这 地 的 出 产 ， 或 使 瘟 疫 流 行 在 我 民 中 ， [kjv] If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; [bbe] If, at my word, heaven is shut up, so that there is no rain, or if I send locusts on the land for its destruction, or if I send disease on my people; 7:14 [hgb] 这 称 为 我 名 下 的 子 民 ， 若 是 自 卑 ， 祷 告 ， 寻 求 我 的 面 ， 转 离 他 们 的 恶 行 ， 我 必 从 天 上 垂 听 ， 赦 免 他 们 的 罪 ， 医 治 他 们 的 地 。 [kjv] If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. [bbe] If my people, on whom my name is named, make themselves low and come to me in prayer, searching for me and turning from their evil ways; then I will give ear from heaven, overlooking their sin, and will give life again to their land. 7:15 [hgb] 我 必 睁 眼 看 ， 侧 耳 听 在 此 处 所 献 的 祷 告 。 [kjv] Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place. [bbe] Now my eyes will be open and my ears awake to the prayers made in this place. 7:16 [hgb] 现 在 我 已 选 择 这 殿 ， 分 别 为 圣 ， 使 我 的 名 永 在 其 中 ， 我 的 眼 ， 我 的 心 也 必 常 在 那 里 。 [kjv] For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. [bbe] For I have taken this house for myself and made it holy, so that my name may be there for ever; and my eyes and my heart will be there at all times. 7:17 [hgb] 你 若 在 我 面 前 效 法 你 父 大 卫 所 行 的 ， 遵 行 我 一 切 所 吩 咐 你 的 ， 谨 守 我 的 律 例 典 章 ， [kjv] And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments; [bbe] And as for you, if you will go on your way before me as David your father did, doing whatever I have given you orders to do and keeping my laws and my decisions: 7:18 [hgb] 我 就 必 坚 固 你 的 国 位 ， 正 如 我 与 你 父 大 卫 所 立 的 约 ， 说 ， 你 的 子 孙 必 不 断 人 作 以 色 列 的 王 。 [kjv] Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel. [bbe] Then I will make strong the seat of your kingdom, as I gave my word to David your father, saying, You will never be without a man to be ruler in Israel. 7:19 [hgb] 倘 若 你 们 转 去 丢 弃 我 指 示 你 们 的 律 例 诫 命 ， 去 事 奉 敬 拜 别 神 ， [kjv] But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; [bbe] But if you are turned away from me, and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you, but go and make yourselves servants to other gods, giving them worship: 7:20 [hgb] 我 就 必 将 以 色 列 人 从 我 赐 给 他 们 的 地 上 拔 出 根 来 ， 并 且 我 为 己 名 所 分 别 为 圣 的 殿 也 必 舍 弃 不 顾 ， 使 他 在 万 民 中 作 笑 谈 ， 被 讥 诮 。 [kjv] Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations. [bbe] Then I will have this people uprooted out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, I will put away from before my eyes, and make it an example and a word of shame among all peoples. 7:21 [hgb] 这 殿 虽 然 甚 高 ， 将 来 经 过 的 人 必 惊 讶 说 ， 耶 和 华 为 何 向 这 地 和 这 殿 如 此 行 呢 ？ [kjv] And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house? [bbe] And this house will become a mass of broken walls, and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder, and will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house? 7:22 [hgb] 人 必 回 答 说 ， 是 因 此 地 的 人 离 弃 耶 和 华 他 们 列 祖 的 神 ， 就 是 领 他 们 出 埃 及 地 的 神 ， 去 亲 近 别 神 ， 敬 拜 事 奉 他 ， 所 以 耶 和 华 使 这 一 切 灾 祸 临 到 他 们 。 [kjv] And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them. [bbe] And their answer will be, Because they were turned away from the Lord, the God of their fathers, who took them out of the land of Egypt, and took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants: that is why he has sent all this evil on them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1418.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
