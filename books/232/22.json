{"id":7135,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"22:1 [hgb] 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 立 约 兰 的 小 儿 子 亚 哈 谢 接 续 他 作 王 。 因 为 跟 随 亚 拉 伯 人 来 攻 营 的 军 兵 曾 杀 了 亚 哈 谢 的 众 兄 长 。 这 样 ， 犹 大 王 约 兰 的 儿 子 亚 哈 谢 作 了 王 。 \n [kjv] And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. \n [bbe] And the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the army had put all the older sons to death. So Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, became king. \n 22:2 [hgb] 亚 哈 谢 登 基 的 时 候 年 四 十 二 岁 （ 列 王 下 八 章 二 十 六 节 作 二 十 二 岁 ） ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 一 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 亚 他 利 雅 ， 是 暗 利 的 孙 女 。 \n [kjv] Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother\u0027s name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. \n [bbe] Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for one year. His mother\u0027s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri. \n 22:3 [hgb] 亚 哈 谢 也 行 亚 哈 家 的 道 。 因 为 他 母 亲 给 他 主 谋 ， 使 他 行 恶 。 \n [kjv] He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly. \n [bbe] He went in the ways of the family of Ahab, for his mother was his teacher in evil-doing. \n 22:4 [hgb] 他 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 像 亚 哈 家 一 样 。 因 他 父 亲 死 后 有 亚 哈 家 的 人 给 他 主 谋 ， 以 致 败 坏 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction. \n [bbe] And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as the family of Ahab did; for after the death of his father they were his guides to his destruction. \n 22:5 [hgb] 他 听 从 亚 哈 家 的 计 谋 ， 同 以 色 列 王 亚 哈 的 儿 子 约 兰 往 基 列 的 拉 末 去 ， 与 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 争 战 。 亚 兰 人 打 伤 了 约 兰 。 \n [kjv] He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram. \n [bbe] Acting on their suggestion, he went with Jehoram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, to make war on Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead: and Joram was wounded by the bowmen. \n 22:6 [hgb] 约 兰 回 到 耶 斯 列 ， 医 治 在 拉 末 与 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 打 仗 所 受 的 伤 ， 犹 大 王 约 兰 的 儿 子 亚 撒 利 雅 （ 即 亚 哈 谢 ） 因 为 亚 哈 的 儿 子 约 兰 病 了 ， 就 下 到 耶 斯 列 看 望 他 。 \n [kjv] And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick. \n [bbe] And he went back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which they had given him at Ramah when he was fighting against Hazael, king of Aram. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to Jezreel to see Jehoram, the son of Ahab, because he was ill. \n 22:7 [hgb] 亚 哈 谢 去 见 约 兰 就 被 害 了 ， 这 是 出 乎 神 。 因 为 他 到 了 ， 就 同 约 兰 出 去 攻 击 宁 示 的 孙 子 耶 户 。 这 耶 户 是 耶 和 华 所 膏 ， 使 他 剪 除 亚 哈 家 的 。 \n [kjv] And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. \n [bbe] Now by the purpose of God, Ahaziah\u0027s journey to see Jehoram was the cause of his downfall: for when he came there, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu, the son of Nimshi, who had been marked out by the Lord for the destruction of the family of Ahab. \n 22:8 [hgb] 耶 户 讨 亚 哈 家 罪 的 时 候 ， 遇 见 犹 大 的 众 首 领 和 亚 哈 谢 的 众 侄 子 服 事 亚 哈 谢 ， 就 把 他 们 都 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them. \n [bbe] Now when Jehu was effecting the punishment of the family of Ahab, he came to the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah\u0027s brothers, the servants of Ahaziah, and put them to death. \n 22:9 [hgb] 亚 哈 谢 藏 在 撒 玛 利 亚 ， 耶 户 寻 找 他 ， 众 人 将 他 拿 住 ， 送 到 耶 户 那 里 ， 就 杀 了 他 ， 将 他 葬 埋 。 因 他 们 说 ， 他 是 那 尽 心 寻 求 耶 和 华 之 约 沙 法 的 儿 子 。 这 样 ， 亚 哈 谢 的 家 无 力 保 守 国 权 。 \n [kjv] And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom. \n [bbe] And he went in search of Ahaziah; and when they came where he was, (for he was in a secret place in Samaria,) they took him to Jehu and put him to death; then they put his body to rest in the earth, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, whose heart was true to the Lord. So the family of Ahaziah had no power to keep the kingdom. \n 22:10 [hgb] 亚 哈 谢 的 母 亲 亚 他 利 雅 见 她 儿 子 死 了 ， 就 起 来 剿 灭 犹 大 王 室 。 \n [kjv] But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. \n [bbe] Now when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom of Judah put to death. \n 22:11 [hgb] 但 王 的 女 儿 约 示 巴 将 亚 哈 谢 的 儿 子 约 阿 施 从 那 被 杀 的 王 子 中 偷 出 来 ， 把 他 和 他 的 乳 母 都 藏 在 卧 房 里 。 约 示 巴 是 约 兰 王 的 女 儿 ， 亚 哈 谢 的 妹 子 ， 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 的 妻 。 她 收 藏 约 阿 施 ， 躲 避 亚 他 利 雅 ， 免 得 被 杀 。 \n [kjv] But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king\u0027s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not. \n [bbe] But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, secretly took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, away from among the king\u0027s sons who were put to death, and put him and the woman who took care of him in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest and sister of Ahaziah, kept him safe from Athaliah, so that she did not put him to death. \n 22:12 [hgb] 约 阿 施 和 她 们 一 同 藏 在 神 殿 里 六 年 。 亚 他 利 雅 篡 了 国 位 。 \n [kjv] And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land. \n [bbe] And she kept him safe with her in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah was ruling the land. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1403.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
