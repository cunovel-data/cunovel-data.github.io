{"id":7141,"no":28,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"28:1 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 登 基 的 时 候 年 二 十 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 十 六 年 。 不 像 他 祖 大 卫 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， [kjv] Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father: [bbe] Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years; he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord, like David his father: 28:2 [hgb] 却 行 以 色 列 诸 王 的 道 ， 又 铸 造 巴 力 的 像 ， [kjv] For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim. [bbe] But he went in the ways of the kings of Israel and made images of metal for the Baals. 28:3 [hgb] 并 且 在 欣 嫩 子 谷 烧 香 ， 用 火 焚 烧 他 的 儿 女 ， 行 耶 和 华 在 以 色 列 人 面 前 所 驱 逐 的 外 邦 人 那 可 憎 的 事 。 [kjv] Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. [bbe] More than this, he had offerings burned in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and made his children go through fire, copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel. 28:4 [hgb] 并 在 丘 坛 上 ， 山 冈 上 ， 各 青 翠 树 下 献 祭 烧 香 。 [kjv] He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. [bbe] And he made offerings and had perfumes burned in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree. 28:5 [hgb] 所 以 ， 耶 和 华 他 的 神 将 他 交 在 亚 兰 王 手 里 。 亚 兰 王 打 败 他 ， 掳 了 他 许 多 的 民 ， 带 到 大 马 色 去 。 神 又 将 他 交 在 以 色 列 王 手 里 ， 以 色 列 王 向 他 大 行 杀 戮 。 [kjv] Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. [bbe] So the Lord his God gave him up into the hands of the king of Aram; and they overcame him, and took away a great number of his people as prisoners to Damascus. Then he was given into the hands of the king of Israel, who sent great destruction on him. 28:6 [hgb] 利 玛 利 的 儿 子 比 加 一 日 杀 了 犹 大 人 十 二 万 ， 都 是 勇 士 ， 因 为 他 们 离 弃 了 耶 和 华 他 们 列 祖 的 神 。 [kjv] For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. [bbe] For Pekah, the son of Remaliah, in one day put to death a hundred and twenty thousand men of Judah, all of them good fighting-men; because they had given up the Lord, the God of their fathers. 28:7 [hgb] 有 一 个 以 法 莲 中 的 勇 士 ， 名 叫 细 基 利 ， 杀 了 王 的 儿 子 玛 西 雅 和 管 理 王 宫 的 押 斯 利 甘 ， 并 宰 相 以 利 加 拿 。 [kjv] And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king\u0027s son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king. [bbe] And Zichri, a great fighting-man of Ephraim, put to death Maaseiah, the king\u0027s son, and Azrikam, the controller of his house, and Elkanah, who was second in authority to the king. 28:8 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 掳 了 他 们 的 弟 兄 ， 连 妇 人 带 儿 女 共 有 二 十 万 ， 又 掠 了 许 多 的 财 物 ， 带 到 撒 玛 利 亚 去 了 。 [kjv] And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. [bbe] And the children of Israel took away as prisoners from their brothers, two hundred thousand, women and sons and daughters, and a great store of their goods, and took them to Samaria. 28:9 [hgb] 但 那 里 有 耶 和 华 的 一 个 先 知 ， 名 叫 俄 德 ， 出 来 迎 接 往 撒 玛 利 亚 去 的 军 兵 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 你 们 列 祖 的 神 恼 怒 犹 大 人 ， 所 以 将 他 们 交 在 你 们 手 里 ， 你 们 竟 怒 气 冲 天 ， 大 行 杀 戮 。 [kjv] But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven. [bbe] But a prophet of the Lord was there, named Oded; and he went out in front of the army which was coming into Samaria and said to them, Truly, because the Lord, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them up into your hands, and you have put them to death in an outburst of wrath stretching up to heaven. 28:10 [hgb] 如 今 你 们 又 有 意 强 逼 犹 大 人 和 耶 路 撒 冷 人 作 你 们 的 奴 婢 ， 你 们 岂 不 也 有 得 罪 耶 和 华 你 们 神 的 事 吗 ？ [kjv] And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God? [bbe] And now your purpose is to keep the children of Judah and Jerusalem as men-servants and women-servants under your yoke: but are there no sins against the Lord your God to be seen among yourselves? 28:11 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 当 听 我 说 ， 要 将 掳 来 的 弟 兄 释 放 回 去 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 向 你 们 已 经 大 发 烈 怒 。 [kjv] Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you. [bbe] And now give ear to me, and send back the prisoners whom you have taken from your brothers: for the wrath of the Lord is burning against you. 28:12 [hgb] 于 是 ， 以 法 莲 人 的 几 个 族 长 就 是 约 哈 难 的 儿 子 亚 撒 利 雅 ， 米 实 利 末 的 儿 子 比 利 家 ， 沙 龙 的 儿 子 耶 希 西 家 ， 哈 得 莱 的 儿 子 亚 玛 撒 起 来 拦 挡 出 兵 回 来 的 人 ， [kjv] Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, [bbe] Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah, the son of Johanan, Berechiah, the son of Meshillemoth Jehizkiah, the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, put themselves against those who had come from the war, 28:13 [hgb] 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 不 可 带 进 这 被 掳 的 人 来 。 你 们 想 要 使 我 们 得 罪 耶 和 华 ， 加 增 我 们 的 罪 恶 过 犯 。 因 为 我 们 的 罪 过 甚 大 ， 已 经 有 烈 怒 临 到 以 色 列 人 了 。 [kjv] And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel. [bbe] And said to them, You are not to let these prisoners come here; for what you are designing to do will be a cause of sin against the Lord to us, making even greater our sin and our wrongdoing, which now are great enough, and his wrath is burning against Israel. 28:14 [hgb] 于 是 带 兵 器 的 人 将 掳 来 的 人 口 和 掠 来 的 财 物 都 留 在 众 首 领 和 会 众 的 面 前 。 [kjv] So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. [bbe] So the armed men gave up the prisoners and the goods they had taken to the heads and the meeting of the people. 28:15 [hgb] 以 上 提 名 的 那 些 人 就 站 起 ， 使 被 掳 的 人 前 来 。 其 中 有 赤 身 的 ， 就 从 所 掠 的 财 物 中 拿 出 衣 服 和 鞋 来 ， 给 他 们 穿 ， 又 给 他 们 吃 喝 ， 用 膏 抹 他 们 。 其 中 有 软 弱 的 ， 就 使 他 们 骑 驴 ， 送 到 棕 树 城 耶 利 哥 他 们 弟 兄 那 里 ， 随 后 就 回 撒 玛 利 亚 去 了 。 [kjv] And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria. [bbe] And those men who have been named went up and took the prisoners, clothing those among them who were uncovered, with things from the goods which had been taken in the war, and putting robes on them and shoes on their feet; and they gave them food and drink and oil for their bodies, and seating all the feeble among them on asses, they took them to Jericho, the town of palm-trees, to their people, and then went back to Samaria. 28:16 [hgb] 那 时 ， 亚 哈 斯 王 差 遣 人 去 见 亚 述 诸 王 ， 求 他 们 帮 助 。 [kjv] At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him. [bbe] At that time King Ahaz sent for help to the king of Assyria. 28:17 [hgb] 因 为 以 东 人 又 来 攻 击 犹 大 ， 掳 掠 子 民 。 [kjv] For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives. [bbe] For the Edomites had come again, attacking Judah and taking away prisoners. 28:18 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 也 来 侵 占 高 原 和 犹 大 南 方 的 城 邑 ， 取 了 伯 示 麦 ， 亚 雅 仑 ， 基 低 罗 ， 梭 哥 和 属 梭 哥 的 乡 村 ， 亭 纳 和 属 亭 纳 的 乡 村 ， 瑾 锁 和 属 瑾 锁 的 乡 村 ， 就 住 在 那 里 。 [kjv] The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there. [bbe] And the Philistines, forcing their way into the towns of the lowlands and the south of Judah, had taken Beth-shemesh and Aijalon and Gederoth and Soco, with their daughter-towns, as well as Timnah and Gimzo and their daughter-towns, and were living there. 28:19 [hgb] 因 为 以 色 列 王 亚 哈 斯 在 犹 大 放 肆 ， 大 大 干 犯 耶 和 华 ， 所 以 耶 和 华 使 犹 大 卑 微 。 [kjv] For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD. [bbe] For the Lord made Judah low, because of Ahaz, king of Israel; for he had given up all self-control in Judah, sinning greatly against the Lord. 28:20 [hgb] 亚 述 王 提 革 拉 毗 尼 色 上 来 ， 却 没 有 帮 助 他 ， 反 倒 欺 凌 他 。 [kjv] And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. [bbe] Then Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, came to him, but was a cause of trouble and not of strength to him. 28:21 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 从 耶 和 华 殿 里 和 王 宫 中 ， 并 首 领 家 内 所 取 的 财 宝 给 了 亚 述 王 ， 这 也 无 济 于 事 。 [kjv] For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not. [bbe] For Ahaz took a part of the wealth from the house of the Lord, and from the house of the king and of the great men, and gave it to the king of Assyria; but it was no help to him. 28:22 [hgb] 这 亚 哈 斯 王 在 急 难 的 时 候 ， 越 发 得 罪 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz. [bbe] And in the time of his trouble, this same King Ahaz did even more evil against the Lord. 28:23 [hgb] 他 祭 祀 攻 击 他 的 大 马 色 之 神 ， 说 ， 因 为 亚 兰 王 的 神 帮 助 他 们 ， 我 也 献 祭 与 他 ， 他 好 帮 助 我 。 但 那 些 神 使 他 和 以 色 列 众 人 败 亡 了 。 [kjv] For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. [bbe] For he made offerings to the gods of Damascus, who were attacking him, and said, Because the gods of the kings of Aram are giving them help, I will make offerings to them so that they may give me help. But they were the cause of his downfall, and of that of all Israel. 28:24 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 将 神 殿 里 的 器 皿 都 聚 了 来 ， 毁 坏 了 ， 且 封 锁 耶 和 华 殿 的 门 。 在 耶 路 撒 冷 各 处 的 拐 角 建 筑 祭 坛 ， [kjv] And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. [bbe] And Ahaz got together the vessels of the house of God, cutting up all the vessels of the house of God, and shutting the doors of the Lord\u0027s house; and he made altars in every part of Jerusalem. 28:25 [hgb] 又 在 犹 大 各 城 建 立 丘 坛 ， 与 别 神 烧 香 ， 惹 动 耶 和 华 他 列 祖 神 的 怒 气 。 [kjv] And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers. [bbe] And in every town of Judah he made high places where perfumes were burned to other gods, awaking the wrath of the Lord, the God of his fathers. 28:26 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 其 余 的 事 和 他 的 行 为 ， 自 始 至 终 都 写 在 犹 大 和 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 [kjv] Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. [bbe] Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, first and last, are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 28:27 [hgb] 亚 哈 斯 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 耶 路 撒 冷 城 里 ， 没 有 送 入 以 色 列 诸 王 的 坟 墓 中 。 他 儿 子 希 西 家 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] And Ahaz went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the earth in Jerusalem; but they did not put him in the resting-place of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son became king in his place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1525.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
