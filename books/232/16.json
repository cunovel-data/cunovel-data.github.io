{"id":7129,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"16:1 [hgb] 亚 撒 三 十 六 年 ， 以 色 列 王 巴 沙 上 来 攻 击 犹 大 ， 修 筑 拉 玛 ， 不 许 人 从 犹 大 王 亚 撒 那 里 出 入 。 [kjv] In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. [bbe] In the thirty-sixth year of the rule of Asa, Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah, building Ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa, king of Judah. 16:2 [hgb] 于 是 亚 撒 从 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 的 府 库 里 拿 出 金 银 来 ， 送 与 住 大 马 色 的 亚 兰 王 便 哈 达 ， 说 ， [kjv] Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king\u0027s house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, [bbe] Then Asa took silver and gold out of the stores of the Lord\u0027s house and of the king\u0027s store-house, and sent to Ben-hadad, king of Aram, at Damascus, saying, 16:3 [hgb] 你 父 曾 与 我 父 立 约 ， 我 与 你 也 要 立 约 。 现 在 我 将 金 银 送 给 你 ， 求 你 废 掉 你 与 以 色 列 王 巴 沙 所 立 的 约 ， 使 他 离 开 我 。 [kjv] There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. [bbe] Let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father: see, I have sent you silver and gold; go and put an end to your agreement with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he may give up attacking me. 16:4 [hgb] 便 哈 达 听 从 亚 撒 王 的 话 ， 派 军 长 去 攻 击 以 色 列 的 城 邑 。 他 们 就 攻 破 以 云 ， 但 ， 亚 伯 玛 音 ， 和 拿 弗 他 利 一 切 的 积 货 城 。 [kjv] And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. [bbe] And Ben-hadad did as King Asa said, and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of Israel, attacking Ijon and Dan and Abel-maim, and all the store-towns of Naphtali. 16:5 [hgb] 巴 沙 听 见 就 停 工 ， 不 修 筑 拉 玛 了 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease. [bbe] Then Baasha, hearing of it, put a stop to the building of Ramah, and let his work come to an end. 16:6 [hgb] 于 是 亚 撒 王 率 领 犹 大 众 人 ， 将 巴 沙 修 筑 拉 玛 所 用 的 石 头 ， 木 头 都 运 去 ， 用 以 修 筑 迦 巴 和 米 斯 巴 。 [kjv] Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah. [bbe] Then King Asa, with all Judah, took away the stones and wood with which Baasha was building Ramah, and he made use of them for building Geba and Mizpah. 16:7 [hgb] 那 时 ， 先 见 哈 拿 尼 来 见 犹 大 王 亚 撒 ， 对 他 说 ， 因 你 仰 赖 亚 兰 王 ， 没 有 仰 赖 耶 和 华 你 的 神 ， 所 以 亚 兰 王 的 军 兵 脱 离 了 你 的 手 。 [kjv] And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand. [bbe] At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa, king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have put your faith in the king of Aram and not in the Lord your God, the army of the king of Aram has got away out of your hands. 16:8 [hgb] 古 实 人 ， 路 比 人 的 军 队 不 是 甚 大 吗 ？ 战 车 马 兵 不 是 极 多 吗 ？ 只 因 你 仰 赖 耶 和 华 ， 他 便 将 他 们 交 在 你 手 里 。 [kjv] Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand. [bbe] Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a very great army, with war-carriages and horsemen more than might be numbered? but because your faith was in the Lord, he gave them up into your hands. 16:9 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 眼 目 遍 察 全 地 ， 要 显 大 能 帮 助 向 他 心 存 诚 实 的 人 。 你 这 事 行 得 愚 昧 。 此 后 ， 你 必 有 争 战 的 事 。 [kjv] For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars. [bbe] For the eyes of the Lord go this way and that, through all the earth, letting it be seen that he is the strong support of those whose hearts are true to him. In this you have done foolishly, for from now you will have wars. 16:10 [hgb] 亚 撒 因 此 恼 恨 先 见 ， 将 他 囚 在 监 里 。 那 时 亚 撒 也 虐 待 一 些 人 民 。 [kjv] Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time. [bbe] Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, burning with wrath against him because of this thing. And at the same time Asa was cruel to some of the people. 16:11 [hgb] 亚 撒 所 行 的 事 ， 自 始 至 终 都 写 在 犹 大 和 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 [kjv] And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. [bbe] Now the acts of Asa, first and last, are recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 16:12 [hgb] 亚 撒 作 王 三 十 九 年 ， 他 脚 上 有 病 ， 而 且 甚 重 。 病 的 时 候 没 有 求 耶 和 华 ， 只 求 医 生 。 [kjv] And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians. [bbe] In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, Asa had a very bad disease of the feet; but he did not go to the Lord for help in his disease, but to medical men. 16:13 [hgb] 他 作 王 四 十 一 年 而 死 ， 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， [kjv] And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign. [bbe] So Asa went to rest with his fathers, and death came to him in the forty-first year of his rule. 16:14 [hgb] 葬 在 大 卫 城 自 己 所 凿 的 坟 墓 里 ， 放 在 床 上 ， 其 床 堆 满 各 样 馨 香 的 香 料 ， 就 是 按 作 香 的 作 法 调 和 的 香 料 ， 又 为 他 烧 了 许 多 的 物 件 。 [kjv] And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries\u0027 art: and they made a very great burning for him. [bbe] And they put him into the resting-place which he had made for himself in the town of David, in a bed full of sweet perfumes of all sorts of spices, made by the perfumer\u0027s art, and they made a great burning for him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1407.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
