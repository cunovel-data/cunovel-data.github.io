[bbe] Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against him, and took him away in chains to Babylon. 36:7 [hgb] 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 又 将 耶 和 华 殿 里 的 器 皿 带 到 巴 比 伦 ， 放 在 他 神 的 庙 里 （ 或 作 自 己 的 宫 里 ） 。 [kjv] Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. [bbe] And Nebuchadnezzar took away some of the vessels of the Lord\u0027s house, and put them in the house of his god in Babylon. 36:8 [hgb] 约 雅 敬 其 余 的 事 和 他 所 行 可 憎 的 事 ， 并 他 一 切 的 行 为 ， 都 写 在 以 色 列 和 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 他 儿 子 约 雅 斤 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and the disgusting things he did, and all there is to be said against him, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place. 36:9 [hgb] 约 雅 斤 登 基 的 时 候 年 八 岁 （ 列 王 下 二 十 四 章 八 节 作 十 八 岁 ） ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 三 个 月 零 十 天 ， 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 。 [kjv] Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.

[bbe] In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and took him away to Babylon, with the beautiful vessels of the house of the Lord, and made Zedekiah, his father\u0027s brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem. 36:11 [hgb] 西 底 家 登 基 的 时 候 年 二 十 一 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 十 一 年 ， [kjv] Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. [bbe] Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; he was ruling in Jerusalem for eleven years. 36:12 [hgb] 行 耶 和 华 他 神 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 。 先 知 耶 利 米 以 耶 和 华 的 话 劝 他 ， 他 仍 不 在 耶 利 米 面 前 自 卑 。 [kjv] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD. [bbe] He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did not make himself low before Jeremiah the prophet who gave him the word of the Lord. 36:13 [hgb] 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 曾 使 他 指 着 神 起 誓 ， 他 却 背 叛 ， 强 项 硬 心 ， 不 归 服 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 。 [kjv] And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel. [bbe] And he took up arms against King Nebuchadnezzar, though he had made him take an oath by God; but he made his neck stiff and his heart hard, turning away from the Lord, the God of Israel. 36:14 [hgb] 众 祭 司 长 和 百 姓 也 大 大 犯 罪 ， 效 法 外 邦 人 一 切 可 憎 的 事 ， 污 秽 耶 和 华 在 耶 路 撒 冷 分 别 为 圣 的 殿 。 [kjv] Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem. [bbe] And more than this, all the great men of Judah and the priests and the people made their sin great, turning to all the disgusting ways of the nations; and they made unclean the house of the Lord which he had made holy in Jerusalem. 36:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 他 们 列 祖 的 神 因 为 爱 惜 自 己 的 民 和 他 的 居 所 ， 从 早 起 来 差 遣 使 者 去 警 戒 他 们 。 [kjv] And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place: [bbe] And the Lord, the God of their fathers, sent word to them by his servants, sending early and frequently, because he had pity on his people and on his living-place; 36:16 [hgb] 他 们 却 嘻 笑 神 的 使 者 ， 藐 视 他 的 言 语 ， 讥 诮 他 的 先 知 ， 以 致 耶 和 华 的 忿 怒 向 他 的 百 姓 发 作 ， 无 法 可 救 。 [kjv] But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy. [bbe] But they put shame on the servants of God, making sport of his words and laughing at his prophets, till the wrath of God was moved against his people, till there was no help. 36:17 [hgb] 所 以 ， 耶 和 华 使 迦 勒 底 人 的 王 来 攻 击 他 们 ， 在 他 们 圣 殿 里 用 刀 杀 了 他 们 的 壮 丁 ， 不 怜 恤 他 们 的 少 男 处 女 ， 老 人 白 叟 。 耶 和 华 将 他 们 都 交 在 迦 勒 底 王 手 里 。 [kjv] Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand. [bbe] So he sent against them the king of the Chaldaeans, who put their young men to death with the sword in the house of their holy place, and had no pity for any, young man or virgin, old man or white-haired: God gave them all into his hands. 36:18 [hgb] 迦 勒 底 王 将 神 殿 里 的 大 小 器 皿 与 耶 和 华 殿 里 的 财 宝 ， 并 王 和 众 首 领 的 财 宝 ， 都 带 到 巴 比 伦 去 了 。 [kjv] And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon. [bbe] And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the stored wealth of the Lord\u0027s house and the wealth of the king and his chiefs, he took away to Babylon. 36:19 [hgb] 迦 勒 底 人 焚 烧 神 的 殿 ， 拆 毁 耶 路 撒 冷 的 城 墙 ， 用 火 烧 了 城 里 的 宫 殿 ， 毁 坏 了 城 里 宝 贵 的 器 皿 。 [kjv] And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. [bbe] And the house of God was burned and the wall of Jerusalem broken down; all its great houses were burned with fire and all its beautiful vessels given up to destruction. 36:20 [hgb] 凡 脱 离 刀 剑 的 ， 迦 勒 底 王 都 掳 到 巴 比 伦 去 ， 作 他 和 他 子 孙 的 仆 婢 ， 直 到 波 斯 国 兴 起 来 。 [kjv] And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: [bbe] And all who had not come to death by the sword he took away prisoners to Babylon; and they became servants to him and to his sons till the kingdom of Persia came to power: 36:21 [hgb] 这 就 应 验 耶 和 华 借 耶 利 米 口 所 说 的 话 ， 地 享 受 安 息 。 因 为 地 土 荒 凉 便 守 安 息 ， 直 满 了 七 十 年 。 [kjv] To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years. [bbe] So that the words of the Lord, which he said by the mouth of Jeremiah, might come true, till the land had had pleasure in her Sabbaths; for as long as she was waste the land kept the Sabbath, till seventy years were complete. 36:22 [hgb] 波 斯 王 古 列 元 年 ， 耶 和 华 为 要 应 验 借 耶 利 米 口 所 说 的 话 ， 就 激 动 波 斯 王 古 列 的 心 ， 使 他 下 诏 通 告 全 国 ， 说 ， [kjv] Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, [bbe] Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, in order that the words which the Lord had said by the mouth of Jeremiah might come true, the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, was moved by the Lord, and he made a public statement and had it given out through all his kingdom and put in writing, saying, 36:23 [hgb] 波 斯 王 古 列 如 此 说 ， 耶 和 华 天 上 的 神 已 将 天 下 万 国 赐 给 我 ， 又 嘱 咐 我 在 犹 大 的 耶 路 撒 冷 为 他 建 造 殿 宇 。 你 们 中 间 凡 作 他 子 民 的 ， 可 以 上 去 ， 愿 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 。 [kjv] Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up. [bbe] Cyrus, king of Persia, has said, All the kingdoms of the earth have been given to me by the Lord, the God of heaven; and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may the Lord his God be with him and let him go up.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1533.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
