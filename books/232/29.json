{"id":7142,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"29:1 [hgb] 希 西 家 登 基 的 时 候 年 二 十 五 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 二 十 九 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 亚 比 雅 ， 是 撒 迦 利 雅 的 女 儿 。 \n [kjv] Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother\u0027s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. \n [bbe] Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old; and he was king in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years; and his mother\u0027s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. \n 29:2 [hgb] 希 西 家 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 效 法 他 祖 大 卫 一 切 所 行 的 。 \n [kjv] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done. \n [bbe] He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. \n 29:3 [hgb] 元 年 正 月 ， 开 了 耶 和 华 殿 的 门 ， 重 新 修 理 。 \n [kjv] He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them. \n [bbe] In the first year of his rule, in the first month, opening the doors of the Lord\u0027s house, he made them strong. \n 29:4 [hgb] 他 召 众 祭 司 和 利 未 人 来 ， 聚 集 在 东 边 的 宽 阔 处 ， \n [kjv] And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street, \n [bbe] And he sent for the priests and the Levites, and got them together in the wide place on the east side, \n 29:5 [hgb] 对 他 们 说 ， 利 未 人 哪 ， 当 听 我 说 ， 现 在 你 们 要 洁 净 自 己 ， 又 洁 净 耶 和 华 你 们 列 祖 神 的 殿 ， 从 圣 所 中 除 去 污 秽 之 物 。 \n [kjv] And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place. \n [bbe] And said to them, Give ear to me, O Levites: now make yourselves holy, and make holy the house of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and take away everything unclean from the holy place. \n 29:6 [hgb] 我 们 列 祖 犯 了 罪 ， 行 耶 和 华 我 们 神 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 离 弃 他 ， 转 脸 背 向 他 的 居 所 ， \n [kjv] For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs. \n [bbe] For our fathers have done evil, sinning in the eyes of the Lord our God, and have given him up, turning away their faces from the house of the Lord, and turning their backs on him. \n 29:7 [hgb] 封 锁 廊 门 ， 吹 灭 灯 火 ， 不 在 圣 所 中 向 以 色 列 神 烧 香 ， 或 献 燔 祭 。 \n [kjv] Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel. \n [bbe] The doors of his house have been shut and the lights put out; no perfumes have been burned or offerings made to the God of Israel in his holy place. \n 29:8 [hgb] 因 此 ， 耶 和 华 的 忿 怒 临 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 将 其 中 的 人 抛 来 抛 去 ， 令 人 惊 骇 ， 嗤 笑 ， 正 如 你 们 亲 眼 所 见 的 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes. \n [bbe] And so the wrath of the Lord has come on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has given them up to be a cause of fear and wonder and shame, as your eyes have seen. \n 29:9 [hgb] 所 以 我 们 的 祖 宗 倒 在 刀 下 ， 我 们 的 妻 子 儿 女 也 被 掳 掠 。 \n [kjv] For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. \n [bbe] For see, our fathers have been put to death with the sword, and our sons and daughters and wives have been taken away prisoners because of this. \n 29:10 [hgb] 现 在 我 心 中 有 意 与 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 立 约 ， 好 使 他 的 烈 怒 转 离 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us. \n [bbe] Now it is my purpose to make an agreement with the Lord, the God of Israel, so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from us. \n 29:11 [hgb] 我 的 众 子 阿 ， 现 在 不 要 懈 怠 。 因 为 耶 和 华 拣 选 你 们 站 在 他 面 前 事 奉 他 ， 与 他 烧 香 。 \n [kjv] My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense. \n [bbe] My sons, take care now: for you have been marked out by the Lord to come before him and to be his servants, burning offerings to him. \n 29:12 [hgb] 于 是 ， 利 未 人 哥 辖 的 子 孙 ， 亚 玛 赛 的 儿 子 玛 哈 ， 亚 撒 利 雅 的 儿 子 约 珥 。 米 拉 利 的 子 孙 ， 亚 伯 底 的 儿 子 基 士 ， 耶 哈 利 勒 的 儿 子 亚 撒 利 雅 。 革 顺 的 子 孙 ， 薪 玛 的 儿 子 约 亚 ， 约 亚 的 儿 子 伊 甸 ， \n [kjv] Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah: \n [bbe] Then the Levites took their places; Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel, the son of Azariah, among the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish, the son of Abdi, and Azariah, the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah, the son of Zimmah, and Eden, the son of Joah; \n 29:13 [hgb] 以 利 撒 反 的 子 孙 申 利 和 耶 利 。 亚 萨 的 子 孙 撒 迦 利 雅 和 玛 探 雅 。 \n [kjv] And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: \n [bbe] And of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; \n 29:14 [hgb] 希 幔 的 子 孙 耶 歇 和 示 每 。 耶 杜 顿 的 子 孙 示 玛 雅 和 乌 薛 。 \n [kjv] And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel. \n [bbe] And of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. \n 29:15 [hgb] 起 来 聚 集 他 们 的 弟 兄 ， 洁 净 自 己 ， 照 着 王 的 吩 咐 ， 耶 和 华 的 命 令 ， 进 去 洁 净 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 \n [kjv] And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD. \n [bbe] And they got their brothers together and made themselves holy, and went in, as the king had said by the word of the Lord, to make the house of the Lord clean. \n 29:16 [hgb] 祭 司 进 入 耶 和 华 的 殿 要 洁 净 殿 ， 将 殿 中 所 有 污 秽 之 物 搬 到 耶 和 华 殿 的 院 内 ， 利 未 人 接 去 ， 搬 到 外 头 汲 沦 溪 边 。 \n [kjv] And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron. \n [bbe] And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to make it clean, and everything unclean which was to be seen in the Temple of the Lord they took out into the outer square of the Lord\u0027s house, and the Levites got it together and took it away to the stream Kidron. \n 29:17 [hgb] 从 正 月 初 一 日 洁 净 起 ， 初 八 日 到 了 耶 和 华 的 殿 廊 ， 用 八 日 的 工 夫 洁 净 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 到 正 月 十 六 日 才 洁 净 完 了 。 \n [kjv] Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end. \n [bbe] On the first day of the first month the work of making the house holy was started, and on the eighth day they came to the covered way of the Lord; in eight days they made the Lord\u0027s house holy, and on the sixteenth day of the first month the work was done. \n 29:18 [hgb] 于 是 ， 他 们 晋 见 希 西 家 王 ， 说 ， 我 们 已 将 耶 和 华 的 全 殿 和 燔 祭 坛 ， 并 坛 的 一 切 器 皿 ， 陈 设 饼 的 桌 子 ， 与 桌 子 的 一 切 器 皿 都 洁 净 了 。 \n [kjv] Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof. \n [bbe] Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, We have made all the house of the Lord clean, as well as the altar of burned offerings with all its vessels, and the table for the holy bread, with all its vessels. \n 29:19 [hgb] 并 且 亚 哈 斯 王 在 位 犯 罪 的 时 候 所 废 弃 的 器 皿 ， 我 们 预 备 齐 全 ， 且 洁 净 了 ， 现 今 都 在 耶 和 华 的 坛 前 。 \n [kjv] Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD. \n [bbe] And all the vessels which were turned out by King Ahaz in his sin while he was king, we have put in order and made holy, and now they are in their places before the altar of the Lord. \n 29:20 [hgb] 希 西 家 王 清 早 起 来 ， 聚 集 城 里 的 首 领 都 上 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 \n [kjv] Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD. \n [bbe] Then Hezekiah the king got up early, and got together the great men of the town, and went up to the house of the Lord. \n 29:21 [hgb] 牵 了 七 只 公 牛 ， 七 只 公 羊 ， 七 只 羊 羔 ， 七 只 公 山 羊 ， 要 为 国 ， 为 殿 ， 为 犹 大 人 作 赎 罪 祭 。 王 吩 咐 亚 伦 的 子 孙 众 祭 司 ， 献 在 耶 和 华 的 坛 上 ， \n [kjv] And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD. \n [bbe] And they took with them seven oxen and seven male sheep and seven lambs and seven he-goats as a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the holy house and for Judah. And he gave orders to the sons of Aaron, the priests, that these were to be offered on the altar of the Lord. \n 29:22 [hgb] 就 宰 了 公 牛 ， 祭 司 接 血 洒 在 坛 上 ， 宰 了 公 羊 ， 把 血 洒 在 坛 上 ， 又 宰 了 羊 羔 ， 也 把 血 洒 在 坛 上 。 \n [kjv] So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar. \n [bbe] So they put the oxen to death and their blood was given to the priests to be drained out against the altar; then they put the male sheep to death, draining out their blood against the altar, and they put the lambs to death, draining out their blood against the altar. \n 29:23 [hgb] 把 那 作 赎 罪 祭 的 公 山 羊 牵 到 王 和 会 众 面 前 ， 他 们 就 按 手 在 其 上 。 \n [kjv] And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them: \n [bbe] Then they took the he-goats for the sin-offering, placing them before the king and the meeting of the people, and they put their hands on them: \n 29:24 [hgb] 祭 司 宰 了 羊 ， 将 血 献 在 坛 上 作 赎 罪 祭 ， 为 以 色 列 众 人 赎 罪 ， 因 为 王 吩 咐 将 燔 祭 和 赎 罪 祭 为 以 色 列 众 人 献 上 。 \n [kjv] And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel. \n [bbe] And the priests put them to death, and made a sin-offering with their blood on the altar, to take away the sin of all Israel: for the king gave orders that the burned offering and the sin-offering were for all Israel. \n 29:25 [hgb] 王 又 派 利 未 人 在 耶 和 华 殿 中 敲 钹 ， 鼓 瑟 ， 弹 琴 ， 乃 照 大 卫 和 他 先 见 迦 得 ， 并 先 知 拿 单 所 吩 咐 的 ， 就 是 耶 和 华 借 先 知 所 吩 咐 的 。 \n [kjv] And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king\u0027s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets. \n [bbe] Then he put the Levites in their places in the house of the Lord, with brass and corded instruments of music as ordered by David and Gad, the king\u0027s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for the order was the Lord\u0027s, given by his prophets. \n 29:26 [hgb] 利 未 人 拿 大 卫 的 乐 器 ， 祭 司 拿 号 ， 一 同 站 立 。 \n [kjv] And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. \n [bbe] So the Levites took their places with David\u0027s instruments, and the priests with their horns. \n 29:27 [hgb] 希 西 家 吩 咐 在 坛 上 献 燔 祭 ， 燔 祭 一 献 ， 就 唱 赞 美 耶 和 华 的 歌 ， 用 号 ， 并 用 以 色 列 王 大 卫 的 乐 器 相 和 。 \n [kjv] And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel. \n [bbe] And Hezekiah gave the word for the burned offering to be offered on the altar. And when the burned offering was started, then the song of the Lord was started, with the blowing of horns and with all the instruments of David, king of Israel. \n 29:28 [hgb] 会 众 都 敬 拜 ， 歌 唱 的 歌 唱 ， 吹 号 的 吹 号 ， 如 此 直 到 燔 祭 献 完 了 。 \n [kjv] And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished. \n [bbe] And all the people gave worship, to the sound of songs and the blowing of horns; and this went on till the burned offering was ended. \n 29:29 [hgb] 献 完 了 祭 ， 王 和 一 切 跟 随 的 人 都 俯 伏 敬 拜 。 \n [kjv] And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped. \n [bbe] And at the end of the offering, the king and all who were present with him gave worship with bent heads. \n 29:30 [hgb] 希 西 家 王 与 众 首 领 又 吩 咐 利 未 人 用 大 卫 和 先 见 亚 萨 的 诗 词 颂 赞 耶 和 华 。 他 们 就 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 颂 赞 耶 和 华 ， 低 头 敬 拜 。 \n [kjv] Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped. \n [bbe] Then King Hezekiah and the captains gave orders to the Levites to give praise to God in the words of David and Asaph the seer. And they made songs of praise with joy, and with bent heads gave worship. \n 29:31 [hgb] 希 西 家 说 ， 你 们 既 然 归 耶 和 华 为 圣 ， 就 要 前 来 把 祭 物 和 感 谢 祭 奉 到 耶 和 华 殿 里 。 会 众 就 把 祭 物 和 感 谢 祭 奉 来 ， 凡 甘 心 乐 意 的 也 将 燔 祭 奉 来 。 \n [kjv] Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings. \n [bbe] Then Hezekiah made answer and said, Now that you have given yourselves to the Lord, come near and take offerings and praise-offerings into the house of the Lord. So all the people took in offerings and praise-offerings: and those whose hearts were moved, took in burned offerings. \n 29:32 [hgb] 会 众 所 奉 的 燔 祭 如 下 ， 公 牛 七 十 只 ， 公 羊 一 百 只 ， 羊 羔 二 百 只 ， 这 都 是 作 燔 祭 献 给 耶 和 华 的 。 \n [kjv] And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD. \n [bbe] The number of burned offerings which the people took in was seventy oxen, a hundred male sheep, and two hundred lambs: all these were for burned offerings to the Lord. \n 29:33 [hgb] 又 有 分 别 为 圣 之 物 ， 公 牛 六 百 只 ， 绵 羊 三 千 只 。 \n [kjv] And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. \n [bbe] And the holy things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. \n 29:34 [hgb] 但 祭 司 太 少 ， 不 能 剥 尽 燔 祭 牲 的 皮 ， 所 以 他 们 的 弟 兄 利 未 人 帮 助 他 们 ， 直 等 燔 祭 的 事 完 了 ， 又 等 别 的 祭 司 自 洁 了 。 因 为 利 未 人 诚 心 自 洁 ， 胜 过 祭 司 。 \n [kjv] But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. \n [bbe] There were not enough priests for the work of cutting up all the burned offerings; so their brothers the Levites gave them help till the work was done and the priests had made themselves holy: for the Levites were more upright in heart to make themselves holy than the priests. \n 29:35 [hgb] 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 牲 的 脂 油 ， 并 燔 祭 同 献 的 奠 祭 甚 多 。 这 样 ， 耶 和 华 殿 中 的 事 务 俱 都 齐 备 了 （ 或 作 就 整 顿 了 ） 。 \n [kjv] And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order. \n [bbe] And there was a great amount of burned offerings, with the fat of the peace-offerings and the drink offerings for every burned offering. So the work of the Lord\u0027s house was put in order. \n 29:36 [hgb] 这 事 办 的 甚 速 ， 希 西 家 和 众 民 都 喜 乐 ， 是 因 神 为 众 民 所 预 备 的 。 \n [kjv] And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly. \n [bbe] And Hezekiah and all the people were full of joy, because God had made the people ready: for the thing was done suddenly. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88/1526.html","bookId":232,"book":{"id":232,"title":"Chronicles历代志下","description":"简介： 大 卫 的 儿 子 所 罗 门 国 位 坚 固 。 耶 和 华 他 的 神 与 他 同 在 ， 使 他 甚 为 尊 大 。 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 所 罗 门 吩 咐 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/88","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
