{"id":29418,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV. LIKE THE SPIRIT OF A LITTLE CHILD.","content":"The smoke of the gun curled slowly and reluctantly out of the narrow windows, and through the garret opening I heard a hurried rush of feet beneath me on the stairs, light and quick—a woman’s footsteps when she is young. My head span round, and had it not been for Mary Gordon, whose arm caught and steadied me, I should doubtless have fallen from top to bottom. \n \n “Quintin, Quintin,” she cried, passionately, “are you hurt? Oh, my father has slain him. Wherefore did I let him go?” \n \n I held by the wall and steadied myself on her shoulder, scarce knowing what I did. \n \n Suddenly she cried aloud, a little frightened cry, and, drawing her kerchief from her bosom, she reached up and wiped my brow, down which red drops were trickling.{318} \n \n “You are hurt! You are sort hurt!” she cried. “And it is all my fault!” \n \n Then I said, “Nay, Mary, I am not hurt. It was but a faintish turn that came and passed.” \n \n “Oh, come away,” she cried; “he will surely slay you if you bide here, and your blood will be upon my hands.” \n \n “Nay, Mary,” I answered; “the demon, and not your father, did this thing, and such can do nothing without permission. I will yet meet and expel the devil in the name of the Lord!” \n \n She put her netted fingers about my arm to draw me away; nevertheless, even then, I withstood her. \n \n “Alexander Gordon,” I cried aloud, “the evil spirit hath done its worst. He will now depart from you. I am coming up the ladder.” \n \n I drew my arm free and mounted. As my head rose through the trap-door I own that my heart quaked, but there had come with the danger and the excitement a sort of angry exaltation which, more than aught else, carried me onward. Also I knew within me that if, as I judged, God had other work yet for me to{319} do in Scotland, He would clothe me in secret armour of proof against all assault. \n \n Also the eyes of Mary Gordon were upon me. I had passed my word to her; I could not go back. \n \n As I looked about the garret between the cobwebs, the strings of onions, and the bunches of dried herbs, I could see Sandy Gordon crouching at the far end, all drawn together like a tailor sitting cross-legged on his bench. He had his musket between his knees, and his great sword was cocked threateningly over his shoulder. \n \n “What, Corbie! Are ye there again?” cried he, fleeringly. “Then ye are neither dead nor feared.” \n \n “No,” said I; “the devil that possesses you has been restrained from doing me serious hurt. I will call on the Lord to expel what He hath already rendered powerless.” \n \n “Man, Quintin,” he cried, “ye should have fetched Telfair and the Presbytery with you. Ye are not fit for the job by yourself. Mind you, this is no hotchin’ wee de’il, sitting cross-legged on the hearth in the gloaming like Andrew Mackie’s in Ringcroft. It takes the black Father of Spirits himself, ripe from hell, to grip{320} the Bull of Earlstoun, and set him to roaring like this in the blank middle of the day.” \n \n “But,” said I, “there is One stronger than any devil or devilkin—your father’s and your mother’s God! You are but a great bairn, Sandy. Do ye mind where ye first learned the Lord’s Prayer and the Twenty-third Psalm?” \n \n At my words the great mountain of a man threw his head back and dropped his sword. \n \n “Aye, I mind,” he said, sullenly. \n \n “Where was it?” said I. \n \n “It was at my mother’s knee in the turret chamber that looks to the woods, if ye want to ken.” \n \n “What did your mother when ye had ended the lesson?” \n \n “What is that to you, Quintin MacClellan?” he thundered, fiercely. “I tell you, torment me not!” \n \n He snarled this out at me suddenly like the roar of a beast in a cage, thrusting forth his head at me and showing his teeth in the midst of his red beard. \n \n “What did your mother when ye had learned your psalm?” \n \n “She put her hands upon my head.” \n \n “And then what did she?”{321} \n \n “She prayed.” \n \n “Do ye mind the words of that prayer?” \n \n “I mind them.” \n \n “Then say them.” \n \n “I will not!” he shouted loud and fierce, clattering his gun on the floor and leaping to his feet. His sword was in his hand, and he pointed it threateningly at me. \n \n “You will not say your mother’s prayer,” I answered; “then I will say it for you.” \n \n “No, you shall not, Quintin MacClellan,” he growled. “If it comes to that, I will say it myself. What ken you about my mother’s prayer?” \n \n “I have a mother of mine own, and not once nor twice she hath said a prayer for me.” \n \n The point of the sword dropped. He stood silent. \n \n “Her hands were on your head,” I suggested, “you had finished your prayers. It was in the turret chamber that looks to the north.” \n \n “I ken—I ken!” he cried, turning his head this way and that like a beast tied and tormented. \n \n But in his eyes there grew a far-away look. The convulsive fingers loosened on the sword-hilt{322}. The blade fell unheeded to the ground and lay beside the empty musket. \n \n “O Lord!” he gasped, hardly above his breath, “from all the dangers of this night keep my laddie. From powers of evil guard him with thy good angels. The Lord Christ be his yoke-bearer. Deliver him from sin and from himself. When I am under green kirkyard sward, be Thou to him both father and mother. O God, Father in Heaven, bless the lad!” \n \n It was his mother’s prayer. \n \n And as the words came softer Alexander Gordon fell on his knees, and moaned aloud in the dim smoky garret. \n \n Then, judging that my work was done, I, too, kneeled on my knees, and for the space of an hour or thereby the wind of the summer blew through the chamber, the shadows crawled up the walls, and Alexander Gordon moved not nor spoke. \n \n Then I arose, took him by the hand, and bade him follow me. We went down both of us together. And in the room below we found Mary, who had sat listening with her head on her hand. \n \n “Here is your father,” I said; “take him to{323} his chamber, and when he is ready bring him again into the great room.” \n \n So very obediently he went with her as a little child might. \n \n Presently she brought him in again, clean washed and with the black look gone from his brow. \n \n I bade her set him by the window. She looked at me to see if she should leave us alone. But I desired her to stay. \n \n Then very gently I set the right way before him. \n \n “Alexander,” said I, “ye have done that which has worked great scandal. Ye shall confess that publicly. Ye are innocent of the greater iniquity laid to your charge. Ye shall clear yourself of that by a solemn oath taken both in the presence of God and before men.” \n \n “That I cannot,” said he, speaking for the first time; “the Presbytery have refused me the privilege.” \n \n “There is a door open for you,” I said, “in a place where the Presbytery and your enemies have no power. It may not be long mine to offer you. But for one day it shall be yours, and after the service on Sabbath in the Kirk of Balmaghie ye shall stand up and clear yourself{324} by oath of the greater sin—after having made confession of the more venial fault.” \n \n “I will do it!” he said, and put his hand in mine. \n \n So I left him sitting there with his daughter, with the knowledge that my soul had power over his. And in the eventide, greatly comforted, I took my way homewards, knowing that he would not fail me. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1651/48776.html","bookId":1204,"book":{"id":1204,"title":"The Standard Bearer","description":"简介： A book iron-grey and chill is this that I have written, the tale of times when the passions of men were still working like a yeasty sea after the storms of the Great Killing.
