{"id":29390,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII. MY BROTHER HOB.","content":"The years which took me, Quintin MacClellan, from the boyishness of thirteen to eighteen and manhood were eventful ones for Scotland. The second Charles had died just when the blast was strongest, and for a while it looked as if his brother would be the worst of the two. But because he wished well to the Papists, and could not ease them without also somewhat benefiting us of the Covenant, the bitterness of the shower slacked and we had some peace. \\n\\n \\n\\n But, as for me, it mattered not greatly. My heart within me was determined that which it should do. Come storm or peaceful years, come life or death, I was determined to stand in the forefront and hold up again the banner which had been dabbled in the blood of Richard Cameron at Ayrsmoss, and trailed in the dust of victory by the haughty and the cruel.{61} \\n\\n \\n\\n That very year I went to my father, and I asked of him a wage to be spent in buying me books for my learning. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You want to be a minister?” said my father, looking, as he well might, no little astonished. “Have you gotten the grace of God in your heart?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nay, father,” I answered him, “that I know not. But nevertheless I have a desire to know and to learn——” \\n\\n \\n\\n But another voice cut into the matter and gravity of our discourse. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Bless the lad, and so you shall, Quintin!” cried my mother from the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n I heard my father sigh as though he would have said, “The fat is in the fire now!” Yet he refrained him and said nothing, standing as was his custom with his hands deep in the long side flaps of his waistcoat. Then he showed how hard it was to become a minister, and ever my mother countered his objections, telling how such-an-one’s son had gone forward and been successful. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And they had none such a comfortable down-sitting nor yet any such blessing in flocks and herds as you, goodman!” she would say.{62} \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nor yet a mother so set and determined in her own way!” cried my father a little sharply. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nay, now, John,” she made answer; “I did but mention those other lads, because not one of them is to be compared with our Quintin!” \\n\\n \\n\\n My father laughed a little. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well,” he said, “at all events there is time enough. The lad is but fourteen, and muckle much good water will run under the brigs ere it be time to send him to the college. But I will speak to Gilbert Semple, the Edinburgh carrier, to ask his cousin, the goodly minister, what books are best fitted for a lad who desires to seek learning and college breeding. And in the meantime the laddie has aye his Bible. I mind what good Master Rutherford said when he was in Anwoth: ‘If so be ye want manners e’en read the Bible. For the Bible is no ill-bred book. It will take you unashamed through an earthly court as well as through the courts of the Master of Assemblies, through the Star Chamber as well as through the chamber of the stars.’” \\n\\n \\n\\n And though at the time I understood not well then what my father meant, yet I read in my Bible as I had opportunity, keeping it with{63} one or two other books in the poke-nook of my plaid whenever I went to the hills. After a while Gilbert Semple, the carrier, brought me from Edinburgh certain other volumes—some of Latin and Greek grammar, with one or two in the mathematics which were a sore puzzle and heartbreak to me, till there came among us one of the Hill Folk, a well-learned man, who, being in hiding in a Whig’s hole on the side of Cairn Edward, was glad for the passing of the time to teach me to thread the stony desolation of verbs irregular and the quags of the rules of syntax. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nevertheless, at this time, I fear there was in me no very rooted or living desire for the ministry. I longed, it is true, for a wider and more ample career than the sheep-herding on the hills of Kells could afford. And in this my mother supported me. Hob and David also, though they desired not the like for themselves, yet took some credit in a brother who had it in him to struggle through the narrow and thorn-beset wicket gate of learning. \\n\\n \\n\\n Many a time did our great, stupid, kindly, butter-hearted Hob come to me, as I lay prone kicking my heels to some dyke-back with my Latin grammar under my nose, and stand{64} looking over with a kind of awe on his honest face. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Read us a bit,” he would say. \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereat very gladly I would screed him off half a page of the rules of the syntax in the Latin tongue, according to the Dutch pronunciation which the preacher lad of the Cairn Edward cave had taught me.[3] \\n\\n \\n\\n And as I rolled the weighty and sounding words glibly off, Hob would listen with an air of infinite satisfaction, like one that rolls a sweet morsel under his tongue. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Read that leaf again! It’s a grand-soundin’ ane that! Like ‘And the Lord said unto Moses’ in the Book of Exodus. Certes, what it is to have learning!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then very gravely I would read to the foot of the page and stop. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hob would stand a moment to digest his meal of the Humanities. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Lie ye there, laddie,” he would say; “gather what lear ye can out of your books. I will look to the hill sheep for you this day!” \\n\\n \\n\\n I shall never forget his delight when, after{65} great wrestlings, I taught him the proper cases of Penna, “a pen,” which in time he attained so great a mastery over that even in his sleep he could be heard muttering, “Penna, a pen; pennae, of a pen.” And our David, slinking sulkily in at a wolf-lope from his night-raking among the Glenkens lasses, would sometimes bid him to be silent in no kindly tones, at which the burly Hob, who could have broken slender David over his knee, would only grunt and turn him over, recommencing monotonously under his breath, “Penna, a pen!” \\n\\n \\n\\n My father smiled at all this—but covertly, not believing, I think, that there was any outgate for me into the ministry. And with the state of things in Scotland, indeed, I myself saw none. Nevertheless, I had it in me to try. And if Mr. Linning, Mr. Boyd, Mr. Shields, Mr. Renwick and others had gotten their learning in Holland, why should not I? \\n\\n \\n\\n In return for Penna, a pen (pennae, of a pen, et cetera), Hob taught me the use of arms, the shooting to the dot of an “i” with a gun and a pistol, the broad sword and the small sword, having no mercy on me at all, but abusing me like a sheep-stealer if I failed or grew slack at the practice.{66} \\n\\n \\n\\n “For,” he said, “if ever you are to be a right minister in Scotland, it is as like that ye will need to lead a charge with Richard Cameron, as that ye will spend all your time in the making of sermons and delivering them.” \\n\\n \\n\\n So he taught me also single-stick till I was black and blue all over. He would keep on so long belabouring me that I could only stop him with some verbal quib, which as soon as it pierced his thick skull would make him laugh so long and so loudly that the lesson stopped of itself. Yet for all that he had in after time the mighty assurance to say that it was I who had no true appreciation of humour. \\n\\n \\n\\n One day, when he had basted me most unmercifully, I said to him, “I also would ask you one thing, Hob, and if you tell me without sleeping on it, I will give you the silver buckle of my belt.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Say on,” said he, casting an eager eye at the waist-leather which Jean Gordon had sent me. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Wherein have I the advantage over the leopard?” I asked him. \\n\\n \\n\\n He thought it over most profoundly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I give it up,” he said at last. “I do not know.”{67} \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why,” said I, as if it had been the simplest thing, “because when I play back-sword with you I can change my spots and Scripture declares that the leopard cannot.” \\n\\n \\n\\n This he understood not at the time, but the next Sabbath morning it came upon him in the time of worship in the kitchen, and in the midst of the solemnity he laughed aloud, whereat my father, much incensed, asked him what ailed him and if his wits had suddenly taken leave of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “It was our Quintin,” dithered Hob, tremulously trying to command his midriff; “he told me that when I played back-sword with him he could change his spots and that the leopard could not.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “When said he that?” asked my father, with cold suspicion, for I had been sitting demure as a gib cat at his own elbow. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Last Monday in the gloaming, when we were playing at back-sword in the barn,” said Hob. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Thou great fool,” cried my father, “go to the hill breakfastless, and come not in till ye have learned to behave yourself in the time of worship.” \\n\\n \\n\\n To which Hob responded nothing, but rose{68} and went obediently, smothering his belated laughter in his broad bonnet of blue. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was waiting for me after by the sheep-buchts, when I went out with a bicker of porridge under my coat. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am sore vexed to have made our father angry,” he said, “but the answer came upon me suddenly, and in truth it was a proper jest—for, of course, a leopard could not play back-sword.”{69} \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1651/48748.html","bookId":1204,"book":{"id":1204,"title":"The Standard Bearer","description":"简介： A book iron-grey and chill is this that I have written, the tale of times when the passions of men were still working like a yeasty sea after the storms of the Great Killing.
