{"id":31828,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII","content":"The fit of anger during which Nacha had ordered Monsalvat out of her house had quite passed by the time she returned from the cemetery. She could only marvel at her sudden refusal to hear more of what but a few moments before had offered her starving life the ideal it craved. Nevertheless, the regretful gentleness pervading her now was due undoubtedly to the soothing effect of her visit to Riga\u0027s grave. The thought of the dead poet made her repent of her sudden harshness towards Monsalvat. After that silent leave-taking from her friend, how indeed could she help yearning to turn away from the life she was leading? And yet could she accomplish that? No practicable plan occurred to her; Monsalvat might have helped; but she, stupidly, had driven him away. Strange how certain she felt, nevertheless, that he would not continue offended, that he would forgive her for everything in the end. Still, it was not probable now that he would look for her. Where could she find him? What were his occupations? What places did he frequent? Alas! she knew nothing of him at all, except his name. By some strange confusion in her imagination, the figures of Monsalvat and Riga began to blend in her memory. She could not think of one apart from the other. Was there, perhaps, some spiritual resemblance between them? Outwardly they were such different men. Monsalvat gave an impression of serenity, of poise; Riga, on the contrary, seemed all nerves, all tension. What had Riga, weak, sensitive, the typical neurotic, the creature of whim and circumstance, to set against Monsalvat\u0027s strength of mind and will? Evidently this courageous stranger who had broken his way into her intimacy so suddenly had most of the requirements for success. Riga was one of those men born to fall of their own weakness, even before the battle of existence overwhelms them. But both were generous, high-minded, incapable of envy, or meanness of any kind. What good luck to have met a friend like Monsalvat at just this moment! And what an irreparable misfortune to have lost him forever! When Arnedo came home early in the evening, he brought his friends, and their women, with him as usual. Nacha was once more lost in gloom. She tried to talk, and jest in the spirit of the party, but her words seemed to stick in her throat, and her laughter had in it no note of gaiety. Moreover, all her attempts to conceal her real state of feeling were useless. Arnedo and his companions were not to be deceived; and Pampa\u0027s face openly expressed the displeasure he was experiencing. Finally he called one of the other men to an adjoining room and Nacha, suspecting something, and listening intently, overheard this dialogue between them. \"Why don\u0027t you get rid of her, old man? When a woman goes around looking like Good Friday all day long....\" \"She never used to be like that. There was no one could beat her when it came to dancing, and seeing that things went right in the kitchen, and dressing, and singing and playing, and entertaining people generally. She always gave a fellow a good time, Nacha did. She was good-natured, full of spirit, and....\" \"Well, what\u0027s happened to her, do you suppose?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Anyhow I\u0027m going to let her go. You know, I told you about that matter, down at Belgrano.... Well, it\u0027s just like this.\" And Pampa gave a claw at the air with his fingers closing. \"I see,\" his companion replied. \"So you\u0027ve got a substitute for Nacha! What about today\u0027s trip out there? Anything doing?\" Nacha did not care to listen further. She joined the other girls, and was now apparently in better humor. When the two men came back she plunged with deliberate fervor into the merriment, reaching out for the champagne, and pretending drunkenness—not for Arnedo\u0027s edification, indeed; she knew now that her fate was settled—but to leave a good impression on all these people whom perhaps she would never see again. Meanwhile the memory of Monsalvat and of Riga was vivid in her mind; their image looked up at her from the hollow of her wine glass; she seemed to see them standing in the doorways, their eyes sad with reproach; now they were directly in front of her, now she felt them by her side. One of Arnedo\u0027s friends was speaking, and she thought surely it was Monsalvat\u0027s voice she heard and was about to call his name. Later she had the impression that Riga was about to come into the room; and she actually looked around at the door—not without some alarm, on her companions\u0027 account. How terrified they would be at this intrusion of the dead! Arnedo and his guests were talking of the Centennial celebration; of \"shows\" and cabaret performances, of chorus girls and races. There were three women and four men at the table, only one of the latter in evening clothes. All of them had been present in the cabaret at the time of the quarrel with Monsalvat; and, since that whole occurrence was not an ordinary one, they soon began to discuss it. \"Who was that fool?\" asked \"the Duck,\" who had led the chorus of burlesque weepers in the cabaret. At this question everyone looked at Nacha, who sat there anxiously shifting her eyes from one to another of her inquisitors. \"Why,\" drawled Arnedo, with an air of importance nevertheless, \"he is the brother of one of my best conquests. Don\u0027t you all remember Eugenia?\" Nacha turned cold. Did Monsalvat know? Where was this Eugenia? Was she, too, part of \"the life\"? Ah, yes; that was it! That explained Monsalvat\u0027s actions, and his fervent words of that afternoon. So, then, he was not in love with her! The interest he showed in her was the interest he had in all girls sharing his sister\u0027s lot. How stupid not to have thought of that before! Of course! How could a man like Monsalvat care for an outcast like \"Lila,\" like Nacha Regules! Another guest, the man in the dinner-coat, a tall and skinny youth, whom his companions, out of regard for his large-boned nose, called \"the Parrot,\" declared that Monsalvat wrote for the Patria, where articles had appeared signed with that name; whereupon all four men felt moved to express their scorn for this \"literary fellow,\" a man who spent his time reading trash and writing nonsense and could only be an utter ninny. These young descendants of Moreira were, for that matter, quite sincere in the contempt they voiced. Products of the aggressive money-making illiteracy of the Argentine, they instinctively hated the \"intellectual\" as a menace to the power of their class, and could not look upon students and scientists save with disdainful hostility. From their point of view any man under forty who lived for something besides \"a good time\" was beyond comprehension. They despised books and newspapers; for they vaguely realized that in these lay a power of intelligence destined sooner or later to put an end to the half-breed barbarism incarnate in themselves. As the dinner went on, the patoteros tried to exhibit their brilliancy. But wit for them consisted at best in anecdotes of the sort known in Argentina as \"German jokes\"; in pelting one another with bread pills; or in suddenly bursting out with some deafeningly loud rendition of a snatch from a music hall ballad. One of their best numbers was \"the Duck\u0027s\" weeping act, his most successful parlor stunt. Then \"the Parrot\" would rise from his place, disappear, and return wearing a woman\u0027s hat; or Pampa, flourishing his revolver, would pretend he was fighting a duel, seasoning his antics with picturesque obscenities from the jargon of a well-known vaudeville act. The others, meanwhile, acted as chorus and audience, laughing, and contributing an assortment of musical accompaniments. Nacha was now quite merry; she began to sing, beating time on her glass with a spoon. The others took up the suggestion, and improvised an orchestra. \"The Parrot\" jumped up on the table to conduct, the others remaining in their places. \"Get down off of that!\" yelled Arnedo. The maid stopped in the doorway, doubling up with laughter at this uproarious scene. Shrieks, explosions of mirth, snatches of song, the clink of glasses, exclamations, and words from the gutter mingled in a deafening din. Suddenly it occurred to Nacha to begin a jota. Arnedo rushed at her, clasped her in his arms and bellowed: \"That\u0027s the way I like to see you, my little nigger!\" \"I suppose so,\" said Nacha, throwing him off, \"but what about your \u0027nigger\u0027 in Belgrano? You can do without me, now that you\u0027ve found someone who can stand you!\" Arnedo stopped short, paralyzed for the moment. Then his eyes slowly went the rounds of his friends. Befuddled as he was, he could not remember to which one of them he had mentioned this affair. He turned, finally, on Nacha. \"Who told you that? Come, speak up, this moment. Have you had a detective trailing me? You\u0027re mean enough to!...\" Nacha looked at him in astonishment, pretending she did not understand. \"What is the matter? What did I say?\" Arnedo staggered towards her, an arm lifted to strike. Nacha covered her face with her hands to ward off the blow. The man was beside himself with fury. It was not so much that Nacha knew about his adventures; he had boasted of them to her more than once himself. What irritated him, because it lowered his prestige with his \"crowd,\" was the fact that she was breaking with him. That was his right!... And that she had found a pretext for doing so.... Besides, he got it into his head that Nacha was going to Monsalvat; and the thought that the man he had offended was turning the tables on him was unbearable. A new idea, however, suddenly thrust itself upon him. \"Was it one of these girls who told you?\" he broke out, facing the two startled women. \"What\u0027s it all about?\" asked one of them. \"This is the first I\u0027ve heard of it,\" declared the other. Arnedo seized his glass, which was full of wine, and drained it at a gulp. He stood brooding for a few seconds at the table; then, thrusting his right hand inside his belt, he cried out to the man with whom he had been talking when Nacha overheard him: \"Now I remember! Of course it was you.... You thought you\u0027d play a joke on me by blabbing! You always were a dog; but now you\u0027re going to pay up!\" Therewith he jerked out his revolver and began pointing it about in various directions. His friends seized his arm, but in healthy fear of an accident, refrained from any effort to take the weapon from him. The scene was well on its way to a bad end, when a man named Amiral walked in upon the group. This fellow, the perfect type of the impoverished rake, was always to be found hovering about some couple or other, never under any circumstances accompanied by a woman; he would have to pay for her drinks. He shared the champagne other people bought, rode in taxis other people paid for, and even gathered a few crumbs from other people\u0027s love affairs. Very tall, very thin, with extremely long arms, skeleton-like legs, a wan face, thick up-turned mustache, and bulging, glassy eyes, he was far from prepossessing in appearance. Though his perpetual penury made him something of a joke with women, Amiral was born for \"gallant\" adventure. In the eighteenth century he would have been a Marquis of Marivaux or a Count of Goldoni, prodigal of love and madrigals. In the less favorable present, his position in society, such as it was, derived from his trips to Europe. In Argentina there is no more valid claim to consideration than foreign travels. The oftener one goes abroad, the greater one\u0027s \"prestige,\" and Amiral \"went across\" every two years. He travelled parsimoniously, carried his own luggage, never used a cab, and was extremely sparing of tips. Generally he took lodgings in Paris, where he lived on borrowings from his fellow-countrymen. He knew nothing of the French capital save the life of the boulevards, of the Abbaye de Thélème, of the cabarets, and of the furnished apartments on the Chaussée d\u0027Antin. However, in Argentina, this was readily marketable knowledge; a number of patotas tolerated Amiral for his amiable discourses on the gay life of Paris. His inevitable stock in trade was to expatiate on the theme that Buenos Aires had \"no atmosphere\"; and could the authority of such a widely travelled man be questioned in these matters? When, in the circles he frequented, the discussion turned to women, someone could always be heard to quote Amiral\u0027s oracular utterances: \"Amiral says that in Paris...\" and the point under discussion was settled. \"Why, my good friends, what\u0027s all this, anyway? Are you rehearsing for the movies?\" said the new arrival, coming into the room with his accustomed laugh, his grotesque arms describing absurdly elongated arcs in the air. \"Why, you boys aren\u0027t serious, are you? Oh, say.... Really now, good fellows like you....\" The intervention had a quieting effect on Arnedo, who put his revolver away. One of the women tried to explain the scene to the newcomer, but Amiral held her off at the ends of unbelievably long arms. \"No, no! No post mortems, please! The act is all over, my young friends. Now for a merry little interlude. Come, bring on the suds! Say, girl, hasn\u0027t Pampa got a couple of bottles of champagne? I like mine dry.\" The servant made haste to obey the order. Amiral punctiliously drank a toast to the mutual love of \"the Arnedos,\" and once more laughter, shouting, dancing, clinking of spoons on glasses, general uproar, became the order of the evening. Arnedo, supported by the hilarious demands of the company, insisted that Nacha declare she had no intention of leaving him; and yielding to this unanimous pressure, she obeyed. Thus, under Amiral\u0027s protection, a reconciliation was accomplished. Arnedo took Nacha from her place and made her sit on his lap, while jests at this public flirtation began to fly back and forth. The first bottle had been drunk, and they were making good headway with the second, when Nacha, who had been gradually returning to her depression, burst into tears: \"What\u0027s the meaning of this?\" asked Amiral. \"Oh, nothing!\" Arnedo growled. \"Show her the label on a bottle and she gets one of these fits.\" Now completely succumbing to the champagne, her face distraught and her arms and body twitching in absurd gestures, Nacha began to talk in a rambling, incoherent jumble of words that moved the company to uncontrollable hilarity. \"I loved him so much, and he died!\" she moaned. \"He was here this afternoon, and he told me he loved me; and now he is dead. There never was another man like him—so good, so brave! No one else would have done what he did in the cabaret—Carlos Riga was his name. Oh, poor girl that I am! He told me I would suffer—that I must suffer—but I want to live—to live—I want to live and to suffer! He said he would be my friend. Why did he do that? And then go and die right afterwards? Everyone who loves me goes and dies! You\u0027re laughing at me! Why? Isn\u0027t it the truth? I may be all you say I am, but I know what love is, and I\u0027m not going to leave this house....\" \"She has a fine one on, has Nacha!\" \"That\u0027s a shine for a cloudy day!\" But Nacha had lost consciousness of everything about her. Her eyes were heavy with sleep. She sagged forward in her chair, till her head rested on her arms, and, still at the table there, she fell fast asleep. It was late the next day when she woke in bed; and the servant was bringing her a note from Arnedo. In it he explained that he did not care to have her remain a moment longer under his roof, that she was free to go to Monsalvat or to whomever she preferred. With the message he enclosed a hundred peso bill. Nacha read the letter without emotion. Her first thought was one of shame at the spectacle she must have made the night before. As for Arnedo, she was glad to have her relations with him end in this fashion. A sudden and immediate break—yes, that was better! It was clear he was still fond of her, otherwise he would have told her to go himself, or have had the servant put her out. Consideration for her feelings to such an extent as the letter showed was an incredible act of delicacy on Pampa\u0027s part, had he been serious! She was tempted to remain, just to go him one better. But no! She was through with Pampa and his kind. Monsalvat had told her she was a good, a noble woman, at heart. Could she not be, if she tried? Try she would, at any rate. She wrote a few words to her former lover, assuring him that she bore him no ill-will, and returning the hundred pesos. Then she quietly packed her belongings, dressed, had her trunk carried downstairs, and getting into a cab, gave the driver the address of a boarding house she had selected from a list in the Patria. \"Strictly respectable,\" the advertisement had declared. Nacha felt quite elated now. To herself she seemed to have already gone a long way on the road to respectability. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3110/85632.html","bookId":934,"book":{"id":934,"title":"Nacha Regules","description":"简介： An August night!
