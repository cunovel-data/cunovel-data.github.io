{"id":18415,"no":10,"title":"X FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD","content":"If I were forced to be a boy, and a boy in the country,—the best kind of boy to be in the summer,—I would be about ten years of age. As soon as I got any older, I would quit it. The trouble with a boy is that just as he begins to enjoy himself he is too old, and has to be set to doing something else. If a country boy were wise he would stay at just that age when he could enjoy himself most, and have the least expected of him in the way of work. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of course the perfectly good boy will always prefer to work, and to do \"chores\" for his father and errands for his mother and sisters, rather than enjoy himself in his own way. I never saw but one such boy. He lived in the town of Goshen,—not the place where the butter is made, but a much [Pg 74] better Goshen than that. And I never saw him, but I heard of him; and being about the same age, as I supposed, I was taken once from Zoar, where I lived, to Goshen to see him. But he was dead. He had been dead almost a year, so that it was impossible to see him. He died of the most singular disease: it was from not eating green apples in the season of them. This boy, whose name was Solomon, before he died would rather split up kindling-wood for his mother than go a-fishing: the consequence was, that he was kept at splitting kindling-wood and such work most of the time, and grew a better and more useful boy day by day. Solomon would not disobey his parents and eat green apples,—not even when they were ripe enough to knock off with a stick,—but he had such a longing for them that he pined and passed away. If he had eaten the green apples he would have died of them, probably; so that his example is a difficult one to follow. In fact, a boy is a hard subject to get a moral from. All his little playmates who ate green apples came to Solomon\u0027s [Pg 75] funeral, and were very sorry for what they had done. \\n\\n RUNNING ON THE STONE WALL \\n\\n \\n\\n John was a very different boy from Solomon, not half so good, nor half so dead. He was a farmer\u0027s boy, as Solomon was, but he did not take so much interest in the farm. If John could have had his way he would have discovered a cave full of diamonds, and lots of nail-kegs full of gold-pieces and Spanish dollars, with a pretty little girl living in the cave, and two beautifully caparisoned horses, upon which, taking the jewels and money, they would have ridden off together, he did not know where. John had got thus far in his studies, which were apparently arithmetic and geography, but were in reality the Arabian Nights, and other books of high and mighty adventure. He was a simple country boy, and did not know much about the world as it is, but he had one of his own imagination, in which he lived a good deal. I dare say he found out soon enough what the world is, and he had a lesson or two when he was quite young, in two incidents, which I may as well relate. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 76] \\n\\n \\n\\n If you had seen John at this time, you might have thought he was only a shabbily dressed country lad, and you never would have guessed what beautiful thoughts he sometimes had as he went stubbing his toes along the dusty road, nor what a chivalrous little fellow he was. You would have seen a short boy, barefooted, with trousers at once too big and too short, held up, perhaps, by one suspender only; a checked cotton shirt; and a hat of braided palm-leaf, frayed at the edges and bulged up in the crown. It is impossible to keep a hat neat if you use it to catch bumble-bees and whisk \u0027em; to bail the water from a leaky boat; to catch minnows in; to put over honey-bees\u0027 nests; and to transport pebbles, strawberries, and hens\u0027 eggs. John usually carried a sling in his hand, or a bow, or a limber stick sharp at one end, from which he could sling apples a great distance. If he walked in the road, he walked in the middle of it, shuffling up the dust; or, if he went elsewhere, he was likely to be running on the top of the fence or the stone-wall, and chasing chipmunks. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 77] \\n\\n \\n\\n John knew the best place to dig sweet-flag in all the farm; it was in a meadow by the river, where the bobolinks sang so gayly. He never liked to hear the bobolink sing, however, for he said it always reminded him of the whetting of a scythe, and that reminded him of spreading hay; and if there was anything he hated it was spreading hay after the mowers. \"I guess you wouldn\u0027t like it yourself,\" said John, \"with the stubs getting into your feet, and the hot sun, and the men getting ahead of you, all you could do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Towards evening once, John was coming along the road home with some stalks of the sweet-flag in his hand; there is a succulent pith in the end of the stalk which is very good to eat, tender, and not so strong as the root; and John liked to pull it, and carry home what he did not eat on the way. As he was walking along he met a carriage, which stopped opposite to him; he also stopped and bowed, as country boys used to bow in John\u0027s day. A lady leaned from the carriage and said,— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What have you got, little boy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 78] \\n\\n \\n\\n She seemed to be the most beautiful woman John had ever seen; with light hair, dark, tender eyes, and the sweetest smile. There was that in her gracious mien and in her dress which reminded John of the beautiful castle ladies, with whom he was well acquainted in books. He felt that he knew her at once, and he also seemed to be a sort of young prince himself. I fancy he didn\u0027t look much like one. But of his own appearance he thought not at all, as he replied to the lady\u0027s question, without the least embarrassment,— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s sweet-flag stalk; would you like some?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed, I should like to taste it,\" said the lady, with a most winning smile. \"I used to be very fond of it when I was a little girl.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n John was delighted that the lady should like sweet-flag, and that she was pleased to accept it from him. He thought himself that it was about the best thing to eat he knew. He handed up a large bunch of it. The lady took two or three stalks, and was about to return the rest, when John said,— \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 79] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please keep it all, ma\u0027am. I can get lots more. I know where it\u0027s ever so thick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, thank you,\" said the lady; and as the carriage started she reached out her hand to John. He did not understand the motion, until he saw a cent drop in the road at his feet. Instantly all his illusion and his pleasure vanished. Something like tears were in his eyes as he shouted,— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want your cent. I don\u0027t sell flag!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n John was intensely mortified. \"I suppose,\" he said, \"she thought I was a sort of beggar-boy. To think of selling flag!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At any rate, he walked away and left the cent in the road, a humiliated boy. The next day he told Jim Gates about it. Jim said he was green not to take the money; he\u0027d go and look for it now, if he would tell him about where it dropped. And Jim did spend an hour poking about in the dirt, but he did not find the cent. Jim, however, had an idea: he said he was going to dig sweet-flag, and see if another carriage wouldn\u0027t come along. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 80] \\n\\n \\n\\n John\u0027s next rebuff and knowledge of the world was of another sort. He was again walking the road at twilight, when he was overtaken by a wagon with one seat, upon which were two pretty girls, and a young gentleman sat between them driving. It was a merry party, and John could hear them laughing and singing as they approached him. The wagon stopped when it overtook him, and one of the sweet-faced girls leaned from the seat and said, quite seriously and pleasantly,— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Little boy, how\u0027s your mar?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n John was surprised and puzzled for a moment. He had never seen the young lady, but he thought that she perhaps knew his mother; at any rate his instinct of politeness made him say,— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s pretty well, I thank you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does she know you are out?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And thereupon all three in the wagon burst into a roar of laughter and dashed on. \\n\\n \\n\\n It flashed upon John in a moment that he had been imposed on, and it hurt him dreadfully. His self-respect was injured somehow, and he felt as if his lovely, gentle [Pg 81] mother had been insulted. He would like to have thrown a stone at the wagon, and in a rage he cried,— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re a nice\"—But he couldn\u0027t think of any hard, bitter words quick enough. \\n\\n \\n\\n Probably the young lady, who might have been almost any young lady, never knew what a cruel thing she had done. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1796/52210.html","bookId":1077,"book":{"id":1077,"title":"Being a Boy","description":"简介： This volume was first published over twenty years ago.
