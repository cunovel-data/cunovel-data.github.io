{"id":42949,"no":69,"title":"The Pimienta Pancakes","content":"While we were rounding up a bunch of the Triangle-O cattle in the Frio bottoms a projecting branch of a dead mesquite caught my wooden stirrup and gave my ankle a wrench that laid me up in camp for a week.\\n\\n On the third day of my compulsory idleness I crawled out near the grub wagon, and reclined helpless under the conversational fire of Judson Odom, the camp cook. Jud was a monologist by nature, whom Destiny, with customary blundering, had set in a profession wherein he was bereaved, for the greater portion of his time, of an audience.\\n\\n Therefore, I was manna in the desert of Jud\u0027s obmutescence.\\n\\n Betimes I was stirred by invalid longings for something to eat that did not come under the caption of \"grub.\" I had visions of the maternal pantry \"deep as first love, and wild with all regret,\" and then I asked:\\n\\n \"Jud, can you make pancakes?\"\\n\\n Jud laid down his six-shooter, with which he was preparing to pound an antelope steak, and stood over me in what I felt to be a menacing attitude. He further endorsed my impression that his pose was resentful by fixing upon me with his light blue eyes a look of cold suspicion.\\n\\n \"Say, you,\" he said, with candid, though not excessive, choler, \"did you mean that straight, or was you trying to throw the gaff into me? Some of the boys been telling you about me and that pancake racket?\"\\n\\n \"No, Jud,\" I said, sincerely, \"I meant it. It seems to me I\u0027d swap my pony and saddle for a stack of buttered brown pancakes with some first crop, open kettle, New Orleans sweetening. Was there a story about pancakes?\"\\n\\n Jud was mollified at once when he saw that I had not been dealing in allusions. He brought some mysterious bags and tin boxes from the grub wagon and set them in the shade of the hackberry where I lay reclined. I watched him as he began to arrange them leisurely and untie their many strings.\\n\\n \"No, not a story,\" said Jud, as he worked, \"but just the logical disclosures in the case of me and that pink-eyed snoozer from Mired Mule Canada and Miss Willella Learight. I don\u0027t mind telling you.\\n\\n \"I was punching then for old Bill Toomey, on the San Miguel. One day I gets all ensnared up in aspirations for to eat some canned grub that hasn\u0027t ever mooed or baaed or grunted or been in peck measures. So, I gets on my bronc and pushes the wind for Uncle Emsley Telfair\u0027s store at the Pimienta Crossing on the Nueces.\\n\\n \"About three in the afternoon I throwed my bridle rein over a mesquite limb and walked the last twenty yards into Uncle Emsley\u0027s store. I got up on the counter and told Uncle Emsley that the signs pointed to the devastation of the fruit crop of the world. In a minute I had a bag of crackers and a long-handled spoon, with an open can each of apricots and pineapples and cherries and greengages beside of me with Uncle Emsley busy chopping away with the hatchet at the yellow clings. I was feeling like Adam before the apple stampede, and was digging my spurs into the side of the counter and working with my twenty-four-inch spoon when I happened to look out of the window into the yard of Uncle Emsley\u0027s house, which was next to the store.\\n\\n \"There was a girl standing there--an imported girl with fixings on-- philandering with a croquet maul and amusing herself by watching my style of encouraging the fruit canning industry.\\n\\n \"I slid off the counter and delivered up my shovel to Uncle Emsley.\\n\\n \"\u0027That\u0027s my niece,\u0027 says he; \u0027Miss Willella Learight, down from Palestine on a visit. Do you want that I should make you acquainted?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027The Holy Land,\u0027 I says to myself, my thoughts milling some as I tried to run \u0027em into the corral. \u0027Why not? There was sure angels in Pales--Why, yes, Uncle Emsley,\u0027 I says out loud, \u0027I\u0027d be awful edified to meet Miss Learight.\u0027\\n\\n \"So Uncle Emsley took me out in the yard and gave us each other\u0027s entitlements.\\n\\n \"I never was shy about women. I never could understand why some men who can break a mustang before breakfast and shave in the dark, get all left-handed and full of perspiration and excuses when they see a bold of calico draped around what belongs to it. Inside of eight minutes me and Miss Willella was aggravating the croquet balls around as amiable as second cousins. She gave me a dig about the quantity of canned fruit I had eaten, and I got back at her, flat-footed, about how a certain lady named Eve started the fruit trouble in the first free-grass pasture--\u0027Over in Palestine, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 says I, as easy and pat as roping a one-year-old.\\n\\n \"That was how I acquired cordiality for the proximities of Miss Willella Learight; and the disposition grew larger as time passed. She was stopping at Pimienta Crossing for her health, which was very good, and for the climate, which was forty per cent. hotter than Palestine. I rode over to see her once every week for a while; and then I figured it out that if I doubled the number of trips I would see her twice as often.\\n\\n \"One week I slipped in a third trip; and that\u0027s where the pancakes and the pink-eyed snoozer busted into the game.\\n\\n \"That evening, while I set on the counter with a peach and two damsons in my mouth, I asked Uncle Emsley how Miss Willella was.\\n\\n \"\u0027Why,\u0027 says Uncle Emsley, \u0027she\u0027s gone riding with Jackson Bird, the sheep man from over at Mired Mule Canada.\u0027\\n\\n \"I swallowed the peach seed and the two damson seeds. I guess somebody held the counter by the bridle while I got off; and then I walked out straight ahead till I butted against the mesquite where my roan was tied.\\n\\n \"\u0027She\u0027s gone riding,\u0027 I whisper in my bronc\u0027s ear, \u0027with Birdstone Jack, the hired mule from Sheep Man\u0027s Canada. Did you get that, old Leather-and-Gallops?\u0027\\n\\n \"That bronc of mine wept, in his way. He\u0027d been raised a cow pony and he didn\u0027t care for snoozers.\\n\\n \"I went back and said to Uncle Emsley: \u0027Did you say a sheep man?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027I said a sheep man,\u0027 says Uncle Emsley again. \u0027You must have heard tell of Jackson Bird. He\u0027s got eight sections of grazing and four thousand head of the finest Merinos south of the Arctic Circle.\u0027\\n\\n \"I went out and sat on the ground in the shade of the store and leaned against a prickly pear. I sifted sand into my boots with unthinking hands while I soliloquised a quantity about this bird with the Jackson plumage to his name.\\n\\n \"I never had believed in harming sheep men. I see one, one day, reading a Latin grammar on hossback, and I never touched him! They never irritated me like they do most cowmen. You wouldn\u0027t go to work now, and impair and disfigure snoozers, would you, that eat on tables and wear little shoes and speak to you on subjects? I had always let \u0027em pass, just as you would a jack-rabbit; with a polite word and a guess about the weather, but no stopping to swap canteens. I never thought it was worth while to be hostile with a snoozer. And because I\u0027d been lenient, and let \u0027em live, here was one going around riding with Miss Willella Learight!\\n\\n \"An hour by sun they come loping back, and stopped at Uncle Emsley\u0027s gate. The sheep person helped her off; and they stood throwing each other sentences all sprightful and sagacious for a while. And then this feathered Jackson flies up in his saddle and raises his little stewpot of a hat, and trots off in the direction of his mutton ranch. By this time I had turned the sand out of my boots and unpinned myself from the prickly pear; and by the time he gets half a mile out of Pimienta, I singlefoots up beside him on my bronc.\\n\\n \"I said that snoozer was pink-eyed, but he wasn\u0027t. His seeing arrangement was grey enough, but his eye-lashes was pink and his hair was sandy, and that gave you the idea. Sheep man?--he wasn\u0027t more than a lamb man, anyhow--a little thing with his neck involved in a yellow silk handkerchief, and shoes tied up in bowknots.\\n\\n \"\u0027Afternoon!\u0027 says I to him. \u0027You now ride with a equestrian who is commonly called Dead-Moral-Certainty Judson, on account of the way I shoot. When I want a stranger to know me I always introduce myself before the draw, for I never did like to shake hands with ghosts.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Ah,\u0027 says he, just like that--\u0027Ah, I\u0027m glad to know you, Mr. Judson. I\u0027m Jackson Bird, from over at Mired Mule Ranch.\u0027\\n\\n \"Just then one of my eyes saw a roadrunner skipping down the hill with a young tarantula in his bill, and the other eye noticed a rabbit-hawk sitting on a dead limb in a water-elm. I popped over one after the other with my forty-five, just to show him. \u0027Two out of three,\u0027 says I. \u0027Birds just naturally seem to draw my fire wherever I go.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Nice shooting,\u0027 says the sheep man, without a flutter. \u0027But don\u0027t you sometimes ever miss the third shot? Elegant fine rain that was last week for the young grass, Mr. Judson?\u0027 says he.\\n\\n \"\u0027Willie,\u0027 says I, riding over close to his palfrey, \u0027your infatuated parents may have denounced you by the name of Jackson, but you sure moulted into a twittering Willie--let us slough off this here analysis of rain and the elements, and get down to talk that is outside the vocabulary of parrots. That is a bad habit you have got of riding with young ladies over at Pimienta. I\u0027ve known birds,\u0027 says I, \u0027to be served on toast for less than that. Miss Willella,\u0027 says I, \u0027don\u0027t ever want any nest made out of sheep\u0027s wool by a tomtit of the Jacksonian branch of ornithology. Now, are you going to quit, or do you wish for to gallop up against this Dead-Moral-Certainty attachment to my name, which is good for two hyphens and at least one set of funeral obsequies?\u0027\\n\\n \"Jackson Bird flushed up some, and then he laughed.\\n\\n \"\u0027Why, Mr. Judson,\u0027 says he, \u0027you\u0027ve got the wrong idea. I\u0027ve called on Miss Learight a few times; but not for the purpose you imagine. My object is purely a gastronomical one.\u0027\\n\\n \"I reached for my gun.\\n\\n \"\u0027Any coyote,\u0027 says I, \u0027that would boast of dishonourable--\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Wait a minute,\u0027 says this Bird, \u0027till I explain. What would I do with a wife? If you ever saw that ranch of mine! I do my own cooking and mending. Eating--that\u0027s all the pleasure I get out of sheep raising. Mr. Judson, did you ever taste the pancakes that Miss Learight makes?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Me? No,\u0027 I told him. \u0027I never was advised that she was up to any culinary manoeuvres.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027They\u0027re golden sunshine,\u0027 says he, \u0027honey-browned by the ambrosial fires of Epicurus. I\u0027d give two years of my life to get the recipe for making them pancakes. That\u0027s what I went to see Miss Learight for,\u0027 says Jackson Bird, \u0027but I haven\u0027t been able to get it from her. It\u0027s an old recipe that\u0027s been in the family for seventy-five years. They hand it down from one generation to another, but they don\u0027t give it away to outsiders. If I could get that recipe, so I could make them pancakes for myself on my ranch, I\u0027d be a happy man,\u0027 says Bird.\\n\\n \"\u0027Are you sure,\u0027 I says to him, \u0027that it ain\u0027t the hand that mixes the pancakes that you\u0027re after?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Sure,\u0027 says Jackson. \u0027Miss Learight is a mighty nice girl, but I can assure you my intentions go no further than the gastro--\u0027 but he seen my hand going down to my holster and he changed his similitude--\u0027than the desire to procure a copy of the pancake recipe,\u0027 he finishes.\\n\\n \"\u0027You ain\u0027t such a bad little man,\u0027 says I, trying to be fair. \u0027I was thinking some of making orphans of your sheep, but I\u0027ll let you fly away this time. But you stick to pancakes,\u0027 says I, \u0027as close as the middle one of a stack; and don\u0027t go and mistake sentiments for syrup, or there\u0027ll be singing at your ranch, and you won\u0027t hear it.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027To convince you that I am sincere,\u0027 says the sheep man, \u0027I\u0027ll ask you to help me. Miss Learight and you being closer friends, maybe she would do for you what she wouldn\u0027t for me. If you will get me a copy of that pancake recipe, I give you my word that I\u0027ll never call upon her again.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027That\u0027s fair,\u0027 I says, and I shook hands with Jackson Bird. \u0027I\u0027ll get it for you if I can, and glad to oblige.\u0027 And he turned off down the big pear flat on the Piedra, in the direction of Mired Mule; and I steered northwest for old Bill Toomey\u0027s ranch.\\n\\n \"It was five days afterward when I got another chance to ride over to Pimienta. Miss Willella and me passed a gratifying evening at Uncle Emsley\u0027s. She sang some, and exasperated the piano quite a lot with quotations from the operas. I gave imitations of a rattlesnake, and told her about Snaky McFee\u0027s new way of skinning cows, and described the trip I made to Saint Louis once. We was getting along in one another\u0027s estimations fine. Thinks I, if Jackson Bird can now be persuaded to migrate, I win. I recollect his promise about the pancake receipt, and I thinks I will persuade it from Miss Willella and give it to him; and then if I catches Birdie off of Mired Mule again, I\u0027ll make him hop the twig.\\n\\n \"So, along about ten o\u0027clock, I put on a wheedling smile and says to Miss Willella: \u0027Now, if there\u0027s anything I do like better than the sight of a red steer on green grass it\u0027s the taste of a nice hot pancake smothered in sugar-house molasses.\u0027\\n\\n \"Miss Willella gives a little jump on the piano stool, and looked at me curious.\\n\\n \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 says she, \u0027they\u0027re real nice. What did you say was the name of that street in Saint Louis, Mr. Odom, where you lost your hat?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Pancake Avenue,\u0027 says I, with a wink, to show her that I was on about the family receipt, and couldn\u0027t be side-corralled off of the subject. \u0027Come, now, Miss Willella,\u0027 I says; \u0027let\u0027s hear how you make \u0027em. Pancakes is just whirling in my head like wagon wheels. Start her off, now--pound of flour, eight dozen eggs, and so on. How does the catalogue of constituents run?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Excuse me for a moment, please,\u0027 says Miss Willella, and she gives me a quick kind of sideways look, and slides off the stool. She ambled out into the other room, and directly Uncle Emsley comes in in his shirt sleeves, with a pitcher of water. He turns around to get a glass on the table, and I see a forty-five in his hip pocket. \u0027Great post- holes!\u0027 thinks I, \u0027but here\u0027s a family thinks a heap of cooking receipts, protecting it with firearms. I\u0027ve known outfits that wouldn\u0027t do that much by a family feud.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Drink this here down,\u0027 says Uncle Emsley, handing me the glass of water. \u0027You\u0027ve rid too far to-day, Jud, and got yourself over-excited. Try to think about something else now.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Do you know how to make them pancakes, Uncle Emsley?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \"\u0027Well, I\u0027m not as apprised in the anatomy of them as some,\u0027 says Uncle Emsley, \u0027but I reckon you take a sifter of plaster of Paris and a little dough and saleratus and corn meal, and mix \u0027em with eggs and buttermilk as usual. Is old Bill going to ship beeves to Kansas City again this spring, Jud?\u0027\\n\\n \"That was all the pancake specifications I could get that night. I didn\u0027t wonder that Jackson Bird found it uphill work. So I dropped the subject and talked with Uncle Emsley for a while about hollow-horn and cyclones. And then Miss Willella came and said \u0027Good-night,\u0027 and I hit the breeze for the ranch.\\n\\n \"About a week afterward I met Jackson Bird riding out of Pimienta as I rode in, and we stopped on the road for a few frivolous remarks.\\n\\n \"\u0027Got the bill of particulars for them flapjacks yet?\u0027 I asked him.\\n\\n \"\u0027Well, no,\u0027 says Jackson. \u0027I don\u0027t seem to have any success in getting hold of it. Did you try?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027I did,\u0027 says I, \u0027and \u0027twas like trying to dig a prairie dog out of his hole with a peanut hull. That pancake receipt must be a jookalorum, the way they hold on to it.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027I\u0027m most ready to give it up,\u0027 says Jackson, so discouraged in his pronunciations that I felt sorry for him; \u0027but I did want to know how to make them pancakes to eat on my lonely ranch,\u0027 says he. \u0027I lie awake at nights thinking how good they are.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027You keep on trying for it,\u0027 I tells him, \u0027and I\u0027ll do the same. One of us is bound to get a rope over its horns before long. Well, so- long, Jacksy.\u0027\\n\\n \"You see, by this time we were on the peacefullest of terms. When I saw that he wasn\u0027t after Miss Willella, I had more endurable contemplations of that sandy-haired snoozer. In order to help out the ambitions of his appetite I kept on trying to get that receipt from Miss Willella. But every time I would say \u0027pancakes\u0027 she would get sort of remote and fidgety about the eye, and try to change the subject. If I held her to it she would slide out and round up Uncle Emsley with his pitcher of water and hip-pocket howitzer.\\n\\n \"One day I galloped over to the store with a fine bunch of blue verbenas that I cut out of a herd of wild flowers over on Poisoned Dog Prairie. Uncle Emsley looked at \u0027em with one eye shut and says:\\n\\n \"\u0027Haven\u0027t ye heard the news?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Cattle up?\u0027 I asks.\\n\\n \"\u0027Willella and Jackson Bird was married in Palestine yesterday,\u0027 says he. \u0027Just got a letter this morning.\u0027\\n\\n \"I dropped them flowers in a cracker-barrel, and let the news trickle in my ears and down toward my upper left-hand shirt pocket until it got to my feet.\\n\\n \"\u0027Would you mind saying that over again once more, Uncle Emsley?\u0027 says I. \u0027Maybe my hearing has got wrong, and you only said that prime heifers was 4.80 on the hoof, or something like that.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Married yesterday,\u0027 says Uncle Emsley, \u0027and gone to Waco and Niagara Falls on a wedding tour. Why, didn\u0027t you see none of the signs all along? Jackson Bird has been courting Willella ever since that day he took her out riding.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Then,\u0027 says I, in a kind of yell, \u0027what was all this zizzaparoola he gives me about pancakes? Tell me that.\u0027\\n\\n \"When I said \u0027pancakes\u0027 Uncle Emsley sort of dodged and stepped back.\\n\\n \"\u0027Somebody\u0027s been dealing me pancakes from the bottom of the deck,\u0027 I says, \u0027and I\u0027ll find out. I believe you know. Talk up,\u0027 says I, \u0027or we\u0027ll mix a panful of batter right here.\u0027\\n\\n \"I slid over the counter after Uncle Emsley. He grabbed at his gun, but it was in a drawer, and he missed it two inches. I got him by the front of his shirt and shoved him in a corner.\\n\\n \"\u0027Talk pancakes,\u0027 says I, \u0027or be made into one. Does Miss Willella make \u0027em?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027She never made one in her life and I never saw one,\u0027 says Uncle Emsley, soothing. \u0027Calm down now, Jud--calm down. You\u0027ve got excited, and that wound in your head is contaminating your sense of intelligence. Try not to think about pancakes.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Uncle Emsley,\u0027 says I, \u0027I\u0027m not wounded in the head except so far as my natural cognitive instincts run to runts. Jackson Bird told me he was calling on Miss Willella for the purpose of finding out her system of producing pancakes, and he asked me to help him get the bill of lading of the ingredients. I done so, with the results as you see. Have I been sodded down with Johnson grass by a pink-eyed snoozer, or what?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Slack up your grip in my dress shirt,\u0027 says Uncle Emsley, \u0027and I\u0027ll tell you. Yes, it looks like Jackson Bird has gone and humbugged you some. The day after he went riding with Willella he came back and told me and her to watch out for you whenever you got to talking about pancakes. He said you was in camp once where they was cooking flapjacks, and one of the fellows cut you over the head with a frying pan. Jackson said that whenever you got overhot or excited that wound hurt you and made you kind of crazy, and you went raving about pancakes. He told us to just get you worked off of the subject and soothed down, and you wouldn\u0027t be dangerous. So, me and Willella done the best by you we knew how. Well, well,\u0027 says Uncle Emsley, \u0027that Jackson Bird is sure a seldom kind of a snoozer.\u0027\"\\n\\n During the progress of Jud\u0027s story he had been slowly but deftly combining certain portions of the contents of his sacks and cans. Toward the close of it he set before me the finished product--a pair of red-hot, rich-hued pancakes on a tin plate. From some secret hoarding he also brought a lump of excellent butter and a bottle of golden syrup.\\n\\n \"How long ago did these things happen?\" I asked him.\\n\\n \"Three years,\" said Jud. \"They\u0027re living on the Mired Mule Ranch now. But I haven\u0027t seen either of \u0027em since. They say Jackson Bird was fixing his ranch up fine with rocking chairs and window curtains all the time he was putting me up the pancake tree. Oh, I got over it after a while. But the boys kept the racket up.\"\\n\\n \"Did you make these cakes by the famous recipe?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t I tell you there wasn\u0027t no receipt?\" said Jud. \"The boys hollered pancakes till they got pancake hungry, and I cut this recipe out of a newspaper. How does the truck taste?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re delicious,\" I answered. \"Why don\u0027t you have some, too, Jud?\"\\n\\n I was sure I heard a sigh.\\n\\n \"Me?\" said Jud. \"I don\u0027t ever eat \u0027em.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/42/1303.html","bookId":617,"book":{"id":617,"title":"The Stories Of O.Henry欧亨利短篇小说集","description":"简介： O.
