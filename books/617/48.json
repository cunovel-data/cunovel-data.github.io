{"id":42928,"no":48,"title":"The Hiding of Black Bill","content":"A lank, strong, red-faced man with a Wellington beak and small, fiery eyes tempered by flaxen lashes, sat on the station platform at Los Pinos swinging his legs to and fro. At his side sat another man, fat, melancholy, and seedy, who seemed to be his friend. They had the appearance of men to whom life had appeared as a reversible coat-- seamy on both sides.\n \"Ain\u0027t seen you in about four years, Ham,\" said the seedy man. \"Which way you been travelling?\"\n \"Texas,\" said the red-faced man. \"It was too cold in Alaska for me. And I found it warm in Texas. I\u0027ll tell you about one hot spell I went through there.\n \"One morning I steps off the International at a water-tank and lets it go on without me. \u0027Twas a ranch country, and fuller of spite-houses than New York City. Only out there they build \u0027em twenty miles away so you can\u0027t smell what they\u0027ve got for dinner, instead of running \u0027em up two inches from their neighbors\u0027 windows.\n \"There wasn\u0027t any roads in sight, so I footed it \u0027cross country. The grass was shoe-top deep, and the mesquite timber looked just like a peach orchard. It was so much like a gentleman\u0027s private estate that every minute you expected a kennelful of bulldogs to run out and bite you. But I must have walked twenty miles before I came in sight of a ranch-house. It was a little one, about as big as an elevated- railroad station.\n \"There was a little man in a white shirt and brown overalls and a pink handkerchief around his neck rolling cigarettes under a tree in front of the door.\n \"\u0027Greetings,\u0027 says I. \u0027Any refreshment, welcome, emoluments, or even work for a comparative stranger?\u0027\n \"\u0027Oh, come in,\u0027 says he, in a refined tone. \u0027Sit down on that stool, please. I didn\u0027t hear your horse coming.\u0027\n \"\u0027He isn\u0027t near enough yet,\u0027 says I. \u0027I walked. I don\u0027t want to be a burden, but I wonder if you have three or four gallons of water handy.\u0027\n \"\u0027You do look pretty dusty,\u0027 says he; \u0027but our bathing arrangements--\u0027\n \"\u0027It\u0027s a drink I want,\u0027 says I. \u0027Never mind the dust that\u0027s on the outside.\u0027\n \"He gets me a dipper of water out of a red jar hanging up, and then goes on:\n \"\u0027Do you want work?\u0027\n \"\u0027For a time,\u0027 says I. \u0027This is a rather quiet section of the country, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \"\u0027It is,\u0027 says he. \u0027Sometimes--so I have been told--one sees no human being pass for weeks at a time. I\u0027ve been here only a month. I bought the ranch from an old settler who wanted to move farther west.\u0027\n \"\u0027It suits me,\u0027 says I. \u0027Quiet and retirement are good for a man sometimes. And I need a job. I can tend bar, salt mines, lecture, float stock, do a little middle-weight slugging, and play the piano.\u0027\n \"\u0027Can you herd sheep ?\u0027 asks the little ranch-man.\n \"\u0027Do you mean have I heard sheep?\u0027 says I. \n \"\u0027Can you herd \u0027em--take charge of a flock of \u0027em ?\u0027 says he.\n \"\u0027Oh,\u0027 says I, \u0027now I understand. You mean chase \u0027em around and bark at \u0027em like collie dogs. Well, I might,\u0027 says I. \u0027I\u0027ve never exactly done any sheep-herding, but I\u0027ve often seen \u0027em from car windows masticating daisies, and they don\u0027t look dangerous.\u0027\n \"\u0027I\u0027m short a herder,\u0027 says the ranchman. \u0027You never can depend on the Mexicans. I\u0027ve only got two flocks. You may take out my bunch of muttons--there are only eight hundred of \u0027em--in the morning, if you like. The pay is twelve dollars a month and your rations furnished. You camp in a tent on the prairie with your sheep. You do your own cooking, but wood and water are brought to your camp. It\u0027s an easy job.\u0027\n \"\u0027I\u0027m on,\u0027 says I. \u0027I\u0027ll take the job even if I have to garland my brow and hold on to a crook and wear a loose-effect and play on a pipe like the shepherds do in pictures.\u0027\n \"So the next morning the little ranchman helps me drive the flock of muttons from the corral to about two miles out and let \u0027em graze on a little hillside on the prairie. He gives me a lot of instructions about not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd, and driving \u0027em down to a water-hole to drink at noon.\n \"\u0027I\u0027ll bring out your tent and camping outfit and rations in the buckboard before night,\u0027 says he.\n \"\u0027Fine,\u0027 says I. \u0027And don\u0027t forget the rations. Nor the camping outfit. And be sure to bring the tent. Your name\u0027s Zollicoffer, ain\u0027t it?\"\n \"\u0027My name,\u0027 says he, \u0027is Henry Ogden.\u0027\n \"\u0027All right, Mr. Ogden,\u0027 says I. \u0027Mine is Mr. Percival Saint Clair.\u0027\n \"I herded sheep for five days on the Rancho Chiquito; and then the wool entered my soul. That getting next to Nature certainly got next to me. I was lonesomer than Crusoe\u0027s goat. I\u0027ve seen a lot of persons more entertaining as companions than those sheep were. I\u0027d drive \u0027em to the corral and pen \u0027em every evening, and then cook my corn-bread and mutton and coffee, and lie down in a tent the size of a table-cloth, and listen to the coyotes and whippoorwills singing around the camp.\n \"The fifth evening, after I had corralled my costly but uncongenial muttons, I walked over to the ranch-house and stepped in the door.\n \"\u0027Mr. Ogden,\u0027 says I, \u0027you and me have got to get sociable. Sheep are all very well to dot the landscape and furnish eight-dollar cotton suitings for man, but for table-talk and fireside companions they rank along with five-o\u0027clock teazers. If you\u0027ve got a deck of cards, or a parcheesi outfit, or a game of authors, get \u0027em out, and let\u0027s get on a mental basis. I\u0027ve got to do something in an intellectual line, if it\u0027s only to knock somebody\u0027s brains out.\u0027\n \"This Henry Ogden was a peculiar kind of ranchman. He wore finger- rings and a big gold watch and careful neckties. And his face was calm, and his nose-spectacles was kept very shiny. I saw once, in Muscogee, an outlaw hung for murdering six men, who was a dead ringer for him. But I knew a preacher in Arkansas that you would have taken to be his brother. I didn\u0027t care much for him either way; what I wanted was some fellowship and communion with holy saints or lost sinners--anything sheepless would do.\n \"\u0027Well, Saint Clair,\u0027 says he, laying down the book he was reading, \u0027I guess it must be pretty lonesome for you at first. And I don\u0027t deny that it\u0027s monotonous for me. Are you sure you corralled your sheep so they won\u0027t stray out ?\n \"\u0027They\u0027re shut up as tight as the jury of a millionaire murderer,\u0027 says I. \u0027And I\u0027ll be back with them long before they\u0027ll need their trained nurse.\u0027\n \"So Ogden digs up a deck of cards, and we play casino. After five days and nights of my sheep-camp it was like a toot on Broadway. When I caught big casino I felt as excited as if I had made a million in Trinity. And when H. O. loosened up a little and told the story about the lady in the Pullman car I laughed for five minutes.\n \"That showed what a comparative thing life is. A man may see so much that he\u0027d be bored to turn his head to look at a $3,000,000 fire or Joe Weber or the Adriatic Sea. But let him herd sheep for a spell, and you\u0027ll see him splitting his ribs laughing at \u0027Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night,\u0027 or really enjoying himself playing cards with ladies.\n \"By-and-by Ogden gets out a decanter of Bourbon, and then there is a total eclipse of sheep.\n \"\u0027Do you remember reading in the papers, about a month ago,\u0027 says he, \u0027about a train hold-up on the M. K. \u0026 T.? The express agent was shot through the shoulder, and about $15,000 in currency taken. And it\u0027s said that only one man did the job.\u0027\n \"\u0027Seems to me I do,\u0027 says I. \u0027But such things happen so often they don\u0027t linger long in the human Texas mind. Did they overtake, overhaul, seize, or lay hands upon the despoiler?\u0027\n \"\u0027He escaped,\u0027 says Ogden. \u0027And I was just reading in a paper to-day that the officers have tracked him down into this part of the country. It seems the bills the robber got were all the first issue of currency to the Second National Bank of Espinosa City. And so they\u0027ve followed the trail where they\u0027ve been spent, and it leads this way.\u0027\n \"Ogden pours out some more Bourbon, and shoves me the bottle.\n \"\u0027I imagine,\u0027 says I, after ingurgitating another modicum of the royal boose, \u0027that it wouldn\u0027t be at all a disingenuous idea for a train robber to run down into this part of the country to hide for a spell. A sheep-ranch, now,\u0027 says I, would be the finest kind of a place. Who\u0027d ever expect to find such a desperate character among these song- birds and muttons and wild flowers? And, by the way,\u0027 says I, kind of looking H. Ogden over, \u0027was there any description mentioned of this single-handed terror? Was his lineaments or height and thickness or teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print ?\u0027\n \"\u0027Why, no,\u0027 says Ogden; \u0027they say nobody got a good sight of him because he wore a mask. But they know it was a train-robber called Black Bill, because he always works alone and because he dropped a handkerchief in the express-car that had his name on it.\u0027\n \"\u0027All right,\u0027 says I. \u0027I approve of Black Bill\u0027s retreat to the sheep-ranges. I guess they won\u0027t find him.\u0027\n \"\u0027There\u0027s one thousand dollars reward for his capture,\u0027 says Ogden.\n \"\u0027I don\u0027t need that kind of money,\u0027 says I, looking Mr. Sheepman straight in the eye. \u0027The twelve dollars a month you pay me is enough. I need a rest, and I can save up until I get enough to pay my fare to Texarkana, where my widowed mother lives. If Black Bill,\u0027 I goes on, looking significantly at Ogden, was to have come down this way--say, a month ago--and bought a little sheep-ranch and--\u0027\n \"\u0027Stop,\u0027 says Ogden, getting out of his chair and looking pretty vicious. \u0027Do you mean to insinuate--\u0027\n \"\u0027Nothing,\u0027 says I; \u0027no insinuations. I\u0027m stating a hypodermical case. I say, if Black Bill had come down here and bought a sheep- ranch and hired me to Little-Boy-Blue \u0027em and treated me square and friendly, as you\u0027ve done, he\u0027d never have anything to fear from me. A man is a man, regardless of any complications he may have with sheep or railroad trains. Now you know where I stand.\u0027\n \"Ogden looks black as camp-coffee for nine seconds, and then he laughs, amused.\n \"\u0027You\u0027ll do, Saint Clair,\u0027 says he. \u0027If I was Black Bill I wouldn\u0027t be afraid to trust you. Let\u0027s have a game or two of seven-up to- night. That is, if you don\u0027t mind playing with a train-robber.\u0027\n \"\u0027I\u0027ve told you,\u0027 says I, \u0027my oral sentiments, and there\u0027s no strings to \u0027em.\u0027\n \"While I was shuffling after the first hand, I asks Ogden, as if the idea was a kind of a casualty, where he was from.\n \"\u0027Oh,\u0027 says he, \u0027from the Mississippi Valley.\u0027\n \"\u0027That\u0027s a nice little place,\u0027 says I. \u0027I\u0027ve often stopped over there. But didn\u0027t you find the sheets a little damp and the food poor? Now, I hail,\u0027 says I, \u0027from the Pacific Slope. Ever put up there?\u0027\n \"\u0027Too draughty,\u0027 says Ogden. \u0027But if you\u0027ve ever in the Middle West just mention my name, and you\u0027ll get foot-warmers and dripped coffee.\u0027\n \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says I, \u0027I wasn\u0027t exactly fishing for your private telephone number and the middle name of your aunt that carried off the Cumberland Presbyterian minister. It don\u0027t matter. I just want you to know you are safe in the hands of your shepherd. Now, don\u0027t play hearts on spades, and don\u0027t get nervous.\u0027\n \"\u0027Still harping,\u0027 says Ogden, laughing again. \u0027Don\u0027t you suppose that if I was Black Bill and thought you suspected me, I\u0027d put a Winchester bullet into you and stop my nervousness, if I had any?\u0027\n \"\u0027Not any,\u0027 says I. \u0027A man who\u0027s got the nerve to hold up a train single-handed wouldn\u0027t do a trick like that. I\u0027ve knocked about enough to know that them are the kind of men who put a value on a friend. Not that I can claim being a friend of yours, Mr. Ogden,\u0027 says I, \u0027being only your sheep-herder; but under more expeditious circumstances we might have been.\u0027\n \"\u0027Forget the sheep temporarily, I beg,\u0027 says Ogden, \u0027and cut for deal.\u0027\n \"About four days afterward, while my muttons was nooning on the water- hole and I deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee, up rides softly on the grass a mysterious person in the garb of the being he wished to represent. He was dressed somewhere between a Kansas City detective, Buffalo Bill, and the town dog-catcher of Baton Rouge. His chin and eye wasn\u0027t molded on fighting lines, so I knew he was only a scout.\n \"\u0027Herdin\u0027 sheep?\u0027 he asks me.\n \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says I, \u0027to a man of your evident gumptional endowments, I wouldn\u0027t have the nerve to state that I am engaged in decorating old bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets.\u0027\n \"\u0027You don\u0027t talk or look like a sheep-herder to me,\u0027 says he.\n \"\u0027But you talk like what you look like to me,\u0027 says I.\n \"And then he asks me who I was working for, and I shows him Rancho Chiquito, two miles away, in the shadow of a low hill, and he tells me he\u0027s a deputy sheriff.\n \"\u0027There\u0027s a train-robber called Black Bill supposed to be somewhere in these parts,\u0027 says the scout. \u0027He\u0027s been traced as far as San Antonio, and maybe farther. Have you seen or heard of any strangers around here during the past month?\u0027\n \"\u0027I have not,\u0027 says I, \u0027except a report of one over at the Mexican quarters of Loomis\u0027 ranch, on the Frio.\u0027\n \"\u0027What do you know about him?\u0027 asks the deputy.\n \"\u0027He\u0027s three days old,\u0027 says I.\n \"\u0027What kind of a looking man is the man you work for ?\u0027 he asks. \u0027Does old George Ramey own this place yet? He\u0027s run sheep here for the last ten years, but never had no success.\u0027\n \"\u0027The old man has sold out and gone West,\u0027 I tells him. \u0027Another sheep-fancier bought him out about a month ago.\u0027\n \"\u0027What kind of a looking man is he ?\u0027 asks the deputy again.\n \"\u0027Oh,\u0027 says I, \u0027 a big, fat kind of a Dutchman with long whiskers and blue specs. I don\u0027t think he knows a sheep from a ground-squirrel. I guess old George soaked him pretty well on the deal,\u0027 says I.\n \"After indulging himself in a lot more non-communicative information and two-thirds of my dinner, the deputy rides away.\n \"That night I mentions the matter to Ogden. \"\u0027They\u0027re drawing the tendrils of the octopus around Black Bill,\u0027 says I. And then I told him about the deputy sheriff, and how I\u0027d described him to the deputy, and what the deputy said about the matter.\n \"\u0027Oh, well,\u0027 says Ogden, \u0027let\u0027s don\u0027t borrow any of Black Bill\u0027s troubles. We\u0027ve a few of our own. Get the Bourbon out of the cupboard and we\u0027ll drink to his health--unless,\u0027 says he, with his little cackling laugh, \u0027you\u0027re prejudiced against train-robbers.\u0027\n \"\u0027I\u0027ll drink,\u0027 says I, \u0027to any man who\u0027s a friend to a friend. And I believe that Black Bill,\u0027 I goes on, \u0027would be that. So here\u0027s to Black Bill, and may he have good luck.\u0027\n \"And both of us drank.\n \"About two weeks later comes shearing-time. The sheep had to be driven up to the ranch, and a lot of frowzy-headed Mexicans would snip the fur off of them with back-action scissors. So the afternoon before the barbers were to come I hustled my underdone muttons over the hill, across the dell, down by the winding brook, and up to the ranch-house, where I penned \u0027em in a corral and bade \u0027em my nightly adieus.\n \"I went from there to the ranch-house. I find H. Ogden, Esquire, lying asleep on his little cot bed. I guess he had been overcome by anti-insomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to the sheep business. His mouth and vest were open, and he breathed like a second-hand bicycle pump. I looked at him and gave vent to just a few musings. \u0027Imperial Caesar,\u0027 says I, \u0027asleep in such a way, might shut his mouth and keep the wind away.\u0027\n A man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep. What good is all his brain, muscle, backing, nerve, influence, and family connections? He\u0027s at the mercy of his enemies, and more so of his friends. And he\u0027s about as beautiful as a cab-horse leaning against the Metropolitan Opera House at 12.30 A.M. dreaming of the plains of Arabia. Now, a woman asleep you regard as different. No matter how she looks, you know it\u0027s better for all hands for her to be that way.\n \"Well, I took a drink of Bourbon and one for Ogden, and started in to be comfortable while he was taking his nap. He had some books on his table on indigenous subjects, such as Japan and drainage and physical culture--and some tobacco, which seemed more to the point.\n \"After I\u0027d smoked a few, and listened to the sartorial breathing of H. O., I happened to look out the window toward the shearing-pens, where there was a kind of a road coming up from a kind of a road across a kind of a creek farther away.\n \"I saw five men riding up to the house. All of \u0027em carried guns across their saddles, and among \u0027em was the deputy that had talked to me at my camp.\n \"They rode up careful, in open formation, with their guns ready. I set apart with my eye the one I opinionated to be the boss muck-raker of this law-and-order cavalry.\n \"\u0027Good-evening, gents,\u0027 says I. \u0027Won\u0027t you \u0027light, and tie your horses?\u0027\n \"The boss rides up close, and swings his gun over till the opening in it seems to cover my whole front elevation.\n \"\u0027Don\u0027t you move your hands none,\u0027 says he, \u0027till you and me indulge in a adequate amount of necessary conversation.\u0027\n \"\u0027I will not,\u0027 says I. \u0027I am no deaf-mute, and therefore will not have to disobey your injunctions in replying.\u0027\n \"\u0027We are on the lookout,\u0027 says he, \u0027for Black Bill, the man that held up the Katy for $15,000 in May. We are searching the ranches and everybody on \u0027em. What is your name, and what do you do on this ranch?\u0027\n \"\u0027Captain,\u0027 says I, \u0027Percival Saint Clair is my occupation, and my name is sheep-herder. I\u0027ve got my flock of veals--no, muttons--penned here to-night. The shearers are coming to-morrow to give them a hair- cut--with baa-a-rum, I suppose.\u0027\n \"\u0027Where\u0027s the boss of this ranch?\u0027 the captain of the gang asks me.\n \"\u0027Wait just a minute, cap\u0027n,\u0027 says I. \u0027Wasn\u0027t there a kind of a reward offered for the capture of this desperate character you have referred to in your preamble?\u0027\n \"\u0027There\u0027s a thousand dollars reward offered,\u0027 says the captain, \u0027but it\u0027s for his capture and conviction. There don\u0027t seem to be no provision made for an informer.\u0027\n \"\u0027It looks like it might rain in a day or so,\u0027 says I, in a tired way, looking up at the cerulean blue sky.\n \"\u0027If you know anything about the locality, disposition, or secretiveness of this here Black Bill,\u0027 says he, in a severe dialect, \u0027you are amiable to the law in not reporting it.\u0027\n \"\u0027I heard a fence-rider say,\u0027 says I, in a desultory kind of voice, \u0027that a Mexican told a cowboy named Jake over at Pidgin\u0027s store on the Nueces that he heard that Black Bill had been seen in Matamoras by a sheepman\u0027s cousin two weeks ago.\u0027\n \"\u0027Tell you what I\u0027ll do, Tight Mouth,\u0027 says the captain, after looking me over for bargains. \u0027If you put us on so we can scoop Black Bill, I\u0027ll pay you a hundred dollars out of my own--out of our own--pockets. That\u0027s liberal,\u0027 says he. \u0027You ain\u0027t entitled to anything. Now, what do you say?\u0027\n \"\u0027Cash down now?\u0027 I asks.\n \"The captain has a sort of discussion with his helpmates, and they all produce the contents of their pockets for analysis. Out of the general results they figured up $102.30 in cash and $31 worth of plug tobacco.\n \"\u0027Come nearer, capitan meeo,\u0027 says I, \u0027and listen.\u0027 He so did.\n \"\u0027I am mighty poor and low down in the world,\u0027 says I. \u0027I am working for twelve dollars a month trying to keep a lot of animals together whose only thought seems to be to get asunder. Although,\u0027 says I, \u0027I regard myself as some better than the State of South Dakota, it\u0027s a come-down to a man who has heretofore regarded sheep only in the form of chops. I\u0027m pretty far reduced in the world on account of foiled ambitions and rum and a kind of cocktail they make along the P. R. R. all the way from Scranton to Cincinnati--dry gin, French vermouth, one squeeze of a lime, and a good dash of orange bitters. If you\u0027re ever up that way, don\u0027t fail to let one try you. And, again,\u0027 says I, \u0027I have never yet went back on a friend. I\u0027ve stayed by \u0027em when they had plenty, and when adversity\u0027s overtaken me I\u0027ve never forsook \u0027em.\n \"\u0027But,\u0027 I goes on, \u0027this is not exactly the case of a friend. Twelve dollars a month is only bowing-acquaintance money. And I do not consider brown beans and corn-bread the food of friendship. I am a poor man,\u0027 says I, \u0027and I have a widowed mother in Texarkana. You will find Black Bill,\u0027 says I, \u0027lying asleep in this house on a cot in the room to your right. He\u0027s the man you want, as I know from his words and conversation. He was in a way a friend,\u0027 I explains, \u0027and if I was the man I once was the entire product of the mines of Gondola would not have tempted me to betray him. But,\u0027 says I, \u0027every week half of the beans was wormy, and not nigh enough wood in camp.\n \"\u0027Better go in careful, gentlemen,\u0027 says I. \u0027He seems impatient at times, and when you think of his late professional pursuits one would look for abrupt actions if he was come upon sudden.\u0027\n \"So the whole posse unmounts and ties their horses, and unlimbers their ammunition and equipments, and tiptoes into the house. And I follows, like Delilah when she set the Philip Stein on to Samson.\n \"The leader of the posse shakes Ogden and wakes him up. And then he jumps up, and two more of the reward-hunters grab him. Ogden was mighty tough with all his slimness, and he gives \u0027em as neat a single- footed tussle against odds as I ever see.\n \"\u0027What does this mean?\u0027 he says, after they had him down.\n \"\u0027You\u0027re scooped in, Mr. Black Bill,\u0027 says the captain. \u0027That\u0027s all.\u0027\n \"\u0027It\u0027s an outrage,\u0027 says H. Ogden, madder yet.\n \"\u0027It was,\u0027 says the peace-and-good-will man. \u0027The Katy wasn\u0027t bothering you, and there\u0027s a law against monkeying with express packages.\u0027\n \"And he sits on H. Ogden\u0027s stomach and goes through his pockets symptomatically and careful.\n \"\u0027I\u0027ll make you perspire for this,\u0027 says Ogden, perspiring some himself. \u0027I can prove who I am.\u0027\n \"\u0027So can I,\u0027 says the captain, as he draws from H. Ogden\u0027s inside coat-pocket a handful of new bills of the Second National Bank of Espinosa City. \u0027Your regular engraved Tuesdays-and-Fridays visiting- card wouldn\u0027t have a louder voice in proclaiming your indemnity than this here currency. You can get up now and prepare to go with us and expatriate your sins.\n \"H. Ogden gets up and fixes his necktie. He says no more after they have taken the money off of him.\n \"\u0027A well-greased idea,\u0027 says the sheriff captain, admiring, \u0027to slip off down here and buy a little sheep-ranch where the hand of man is seldom heard. It was the slickest hide-out I ever see,\u0027 says the captain.\n \"So one of the men goes to the shearing-pen and hunts up the other herder, a Mexican they call John Sallies, and he saddles Ogden\u0027s horse, and the sheriffs all ride tip close around him with their guns in hand, ready to take their prisoner to town.\n \"Before starting, Ogden puts the ranch in John Sallies\u0027 hands and gives him orders about the shearing and where to graze the sheep, just as if he intended to be back in a few days. And a couple of hours afterward one Percival Saint Clair, an ex-sheep-herder of the Rancho Chiquito, might have been seen, with a hundred and nine dollars--wages and blood-money--in his pocket, riding south on another horse belonging to said ranch.\"\n The red-faced man paused and listened. The whistle of a coming freight-train sounded far away among the low hills.\n The fat, seedy man at his side sniffed, and shook his frowzy head slowly and disparagingly.\n \"What is it, Snipy?\" asked the other. \"Got the blues again?\"\n \"No, I ain\u0027t\" said the seedy one, sniffing again. \"But I don\u0027t like your talk. You and me have been friends, off and on, for fifteen year; and I never yet knew or heard of you giving anybody up to the law--not no one. And here was a man whose saleratus you had et and at whose table you had played games of cards--if casino can be so called. And yet you inform him to the law and take money for it. It never was like you, I say.\"\n \"This H. Ogden,\" resumed the red-faced man, \"through a lawyer, proved himself free by alibis and other legal terminalities, as I so heard afterward. He never suffered no harm. He did me favors, and I hated to hand him over.\"\n \"How about the bills they found in his pocket?\" asked the seedy man.\n \"I put \u0027em there,\" said the red-faced man, \"while he was asleep, when I saw the posse riding up. I was Black Bill. Look out, Snipy, here she comes! We\u0027ll board her on the bumpers when she takes water at the tank.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/42/1282.html","bookId":617,"book":{"id":617,"title":"The Stories Of O.Henry欧亨利短篇小说集","description":"简介： O.
