{"id":42978,"no":98,"title":"Supply and Demand","content":"Finch keeps a hats-cleaned-by-electricity-while-you-wait establishment, nine feet by twelve, in Third Avenue. Once a customer, you are always his. I do not know his secret process, but every four days your hat needs to be cleaned again. Finch is a leathern, sallow, slowfooted man, between twenty and forty. You would say he had been brought up a bushelman in Essex Street. When business is slack he likes to talk, so I had my hat cleaned even oftener than it deserved, hoping Finch might let me into some of the secrets of the sweatshops. One afternoon I dropped in and found Finch alone. He began to anoint my headpiece de Panama with his mysterious fluid that attracted dust and dirt like a magnet. \"They say the Indians weave \u0027em under water,\" said I, for a leader. \"Don\u0027t you believe it,\" said Finch. \"No Indian or white man could stay under water that long. Say, do you pay much attention to politics? I see in the paper something about a law they\u0027ve passed called \u0027the law of supply and demand.\u0027\" I explained to him as well as I could that the reference was to a politico-economical law, and not to a legal statute. \"I didn\u0027t know,\" said Finch. \"I heard a good deal about it a year or so ago, but in a one-sided way.\" \"Yes,\" said I, \"political orators use it a great deal. In fact, they never give it a rest. I suppose you heard some of those cart-tail fellows spouting on the subject over here on the east side.\" \"I heard it from a king,\" said Finch--\"the white king of a tribe of Indians in South America.\" I was interested but not surprised. The big city is like a mother\u0027s knee to many who have strayed far and found the roads rough beneath their uncertain feet. At dusk they come home and sit upon the door- step. I know a piano player in a cheap cafe who has shot lions in Africa, a bell-boy who fought in the British army against the Zulus, an express-driver whose left arm had been cracked like a lobster\u0027s claw for a stew-pot of Patagonian cannibals when the boat of his rescuers hove in sight. So a hat-cleaner who had been a friend of a king did not oppress me. \"A new band ?\" asked Finch, with his dry, barren smile. \"Yes,\" said I, \"and half an inch wider.\" I had had a new band five days before. \"I meets a man one night,\" said Finch, beginning his story--\"a man brown as snuff, with money in every pocket, eating schweinerknuckel in Schlagel\u0027s. That was two years ago, when I was a hose-cart driver for No. 98. His discourse runs to the subject of gold. He says that certain mountains in a country down South that he calls Gaudymala is full of it. He says the Indians wash it out of the streams in plural quantities. \"\u0027Oh, Geronimo!\u0027 says I. \u0027Indians! There\u0027s no Indians in the South,\u0027 I tell him, \u0027except Elks, Maccabees, and the buyers for the fall dry- goods trade. The Indians are all on the reservations,\u0027 says I. \"\u0027I\u0027m telling you this with reservations,\u0027 says he. \u0027They ain\u0027t Buffalo Bill Indians; they\u0027re squattier and more pedigreed. They call \u0027em Inkers and Aspics, and they was old inhabitants when Mazuma was King of Mexico. They wash the gold out of the mountain streams,\u0027 says the brown man, \u0027and fill quills with it; and then they empty \u0027em into red jars till they are full; and then they pack it in buckskin sacks of one arroba each--an arroba is twenty-five pounds--and store it in a stone house, with an engraving of a idol with marcelled hair, playing a flute, over the door.\u0027 \"\u0027How do they work off this unearth increment?\u0027 I asks. \"\u0027They don\u0027t,\u0027 says the man. \u0027It\u0027s a case of \"Ill fares the land with the great deal of velocity where wealth accumulates and there ain\u0027t any reciprocity.\"\u0027 \"After this man and me got through our conversation, which left him dry of information, I shook hands with him and told him I was sorry I couldn\u0027t believe him. And a month afterward I landed on the coast of this Gaudymala with $1,300 that I had been saving up for five years. I thought I knew what Indians liked, and I fixed myself accordingly. I loaded down four pack-mules with red woollen blankets, wrought-iron pails, jewelled side-combs for the ladies, glass necklaces, and safety-razors. I hired a black mozo, who was supposed to be a mule- driver and an interpreter too. It turned out that he could interpret mules all right, but he drove the English language much too hard. His name sounded like a Yale key when you push it in wrong side up, but I called him McClintock, which was close to the noise. \"Well, this gold village was forty miles up in the mountains, and it took us nine days to find it. But one afternoon McClintock led the other mules and myself over a rawhide bridge stretched across a precipice five thousand feet deep, it seemed to me. The hoofs of the beasts drummed on it just like before George M. Cohan makes his first entrance on the stage. \"This village was built of mud and stone, and had no streets. Some few yellow-and-brown persons popped their heads out-of-doors, looking about like Welsh rabbits with Worcester sauce on em. Out of the biggest house, that had a kind of a porch around it, steps a big white man, red as a beet in color, dressed in fine tanned deerskin clothes, with a gold chain around his neck, smoking a cigar. I\u0027ve seen United States Senators of his style of features and build, also head-waiters and cops. \"He walks up and takes a look at us, while McClintock disembarks and begins to interpret to the lead mule while he smokes a cigarette. \"\u0027Hello, Buttinsky,\u0027 says the fine man to me. \u0027How did you get in the game? I didn\u0027t see you buy any chips. Who gave you the keys of the city?\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027m a poor traveller,\u0027 says I. \u0027Especially mule-back. You\u0027ll excuse me. Do you run a hack line or only a bluff?\u0027 \"\u0027Segregate yourself from your pseudo-equine quadruped,\u0027 says he, \u0027and come inside.\u0027 \"He raises a finger, and a villager runs up. \"\u0027This man will take care of your outfit,\u0027 says he, \u0027and I\u0027ll take care of you.\u0027 \"He leads me into the biggest house, and sets out the chairs and a kind of a drink the color of milk. It was the finest room I ever saw. The stone walls was hung all over with silk shawls, and there was red and yellow rugs on the floor, and jars of red pottery and Angora goat skins, and enough bamboo furniture to misfurnish half a dozen seaside cottages. \"\u0027In the first place,\u0027 says the man, \u0027you want to know who I am. I\u0027m sole lessee and proprietor of this tribe of Indians. They call me the Grand Yacuma, which is to say King or Main Finger of the bunch. I\u0027ve got more power here than a charge d\u0027affaires, a charge of dynamite, and a charge account at Tiffany\u0027s combined. In fact, I\u0027m the Big Stick, with as many extra knots on it as there is on the record run of the Lusitania. Oh, I read the papers now and then,\u0027 says he. \u0027Now, let\u0027s hear your entitlements,\u0027 he goes on, \u0027and the meeting will be open.\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says I, \u0027I am known as one W. D. Finch. Occupation, capitalist. Address, 54\u0027 East Thirty-second--\u0027 \"\u0027New York,\u0027 chips in the Noble Grand. \u0027I know,\u0027 says he, grinning. \u0027It ain\u0027t the first time you\u0027ve seen it go down on the blotter. I can tell by the way you hand it out. Well, explain \"capitalist.\"\u0027 \"I tells this boss plain what I come for and how I come to came. \"\u0027Gold-dust ?\u0027 says he, looking as puzzled as a baby that\u0027s got a feather stuck on its molasses finger. \u0027That\u0027s funny. This ain\u0027t a gold-mining country. And you invested all your capital on a stranger\u0027s story? Well, well! These Indians of mine--they are the last of the tribe of Peehes--are simple as children. They know nothing of the purchasing power of gold. I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ve been imposed on,\u0027 says he. \"\u0027Maybe so,\u0027 says I, \u0027but it sounded pretty straight to me.\u0027 \"\u0027W. D.,\u0027 says the King, all of a sudden, \u0027I\u0027ll give you a square deal. It ain\u0027t often I get to talk to a white man, and I\u0027ll give you a show for your money. It may be these constituents of mine have a few grains of gold-dust hid away in their clothes. To-morrow you may get out these goods you\u0027ve brought up and see if you can make any sales. Now, I\u0027m going to introduce myself unofficially. My name is Shane--Patrick Shane. I own this tribe of Peche Indians by right of conquest--single handed and unafraid. I drifted up here four years ago, and won \u0027em by my size and complexion and nerve. I learned their language in six weeks-it\u0027s easy: you simply emit a string of consonants as long as your breath holds out and then point at what you\u0027re asking for. \"\u0027I conquered \u0027em, spectacularly,\u0027 goes on King Shane, \u0027and then I went at \u0027em with economical politics, law, sleight-of-hand, and a kind of New England ethics and parsimony. Every Sunday, or as near as I can guess at it, I preach to \u0027em in the council-house (I\u0027m the council) on the law of supply and demand. I praise supply and knock demand. I use the same text every time. You wouldn\u0027t think, W. D.,\u0027 says Shane, \u0027that I had poetry in me, would you?\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says I, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t know whether to call it poetry or not.\u0027 \"\u0027Tennyson,\u0027 says Shane, \u0027furnishes the poetic gospel I preach. I always considered him the boss poet. Here\u0027s the way the text goes: \"\u0027You see, I teach \u0027em to cut out demand--that supply is the main thing. I teach \u0027em not to desire anything beyond their simplest needs. A little mutton, a little cocoa, and a little fruit brought up from the coast--that\u0027s all they want to make \u0027cm happy. I\u0027ve got \u0027em well trained. They make their own clothes and hats out of a vegetable fibre and straw, and they\u0027re a contented lot. It\u0027s a great thing,\u0027 winds up Shane, \u0027to have made a people happy by the incultivation of such simple institutions.\u0027 \"Well, the next day, with the King\u0027s permission, I has the McClintock open up a couple of sacks of my goods in the little plaza of the village. The Indians swarmed around by the hundred and looked the bargain-counter over. I shook red blankets at \u0027em, flashed finger- rings and ear-bobs, tried pearl necklaces and sidecombs on the women, and a line of red hosiery on the men. \u0027Twas no use. They looked on like hungry graven images, but I never made a sale. I asked McClintock what was the trouble. Mac yawned three or four times, rolled a cigarette, made one or two confidential side remarks to a mule, and then condescended to inform me that the people had no money. \"Just then up strolls King Patrick, big and red \u0027and royal as usual, with the gold chain over his chest and his cigar in front of him. \"\u0027How\u0027s business, W. D.?\u0027 he asks. \"\u0027Fine,\u0027 says I. \u0027It\u0027s a bargain-day rush. I\u0027ve got one more line of goods to offer before I shut up shop. I\u0027ll try \u0027em with safety- razors. I\u0027ve\u0027 got two gross that I bought at \u0027a fire sale.\u0027 \"Shane laughs till some kind of mameluke or private secretary he carries with him has to hold him up. \"\u00270 my sainted Aunt Jerusha!\u0027 says he, \u0027ain\u0027t you one of the Babes in the Goods, W. D.? Don\u0027t you know that no Indians ever shave? They pull out their whiskers instead.\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says I, \u0027that\u0027s just what these razors would do for \u0027em--they wouldn\u0027t have any kick coming if they used \u0027em once.\u0027 \"Shane went away, and I could hear him laughing a block, if there had been any block. \"\u0027Tell \u0027em,\u0027 says I to McClintock, \u0027it ain\u0027t money I want--tell \u0027em I\u0027ll take gold-dust. Tell \u0027em I\u0027ll allow \u0027em sixteen dollars an ounce for it in trade. That\u0027s what I\u0027m out for--the dust.\u0027 \"Mac interprets, and you\u0027d have thought a squadron of cops had charged the crowd to disperse it. Every uncle\u0027s nephew and aunt\u0027s niece of \u0027em faded away inside of two minutes. \"At the royal palace that night me and the King talked it over. \"\u0027They\u0027ve got the dust hid out somewhere,\u0027 says I, \u0027or they wouldn\u0027t have been so sensitive about it.\u0027 \"\u0027They haven\u0027t,\u0027 says Shane. \u0027What\u0027s this gag you\u0027ve got about gold? You been reading Edward Allen Poe? They ain\u0027t got any gold.\u0027 \"\u0027They put it in quills,\u0027 says I, \u0027and then they empty it in jars, and then into sacks of twenty-five pounds each. I got it straight.\u0027 \"\u0027W. D.,\u0027 says Shane, laughing and chewing his cigar, \u0027I don\u0027t often see a white man, and I feel like putting you on. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll get away from here alive, anyhow, so I\u0027m going to tell you. Come over here.\u0027 \u0027\u0027He draws aside a silk fibre curtain in a corner of the room and shows me a pile of buckskin sacks. \"\u0027Forty of \u0027em,\u0027 says Shane. \u0027One arroba in each one. In round numbers, $220,000 worth of gold-dust you see there. It\u0027s all mine. It belongs to the Grand Yacuma. They bring it all to me. Two hundred and twenty thousand dollars--think of that, you glass-bead peddler,\u0027 says Shane--\u0027 and all mine.\u0027 \"\u0027Little good it does you,\u0027 says I, contemptuously and hatefully. \u0027And so you are the government depository of this gang of money-less money-makers? Don\u0027t you pay enough interest on it to enable one of your depositors to buy an Augusta (Maine) Pullman carbon diamond worth $200 for $4.85 ?\u0027 \"\u0027Listen,\u0027 says Patrick Shane, with the sweat coming out on his brow. \u0027 I\u0027m confidant with you, as you have, somehow, enlisted my regards. Did you ever,\u0027 he says, \u0027feel the avoirdupois power of gold--not the troy weight of it, but the sixteen-ounces-to-the-pound force of it?\u0027 \"\u0027Never,\u0027 says I. \u0027I never take in any bad money.\u0027 \"Shane drops down on the floor and throws his arms over the sacks of gold-dust. \"\u0027I love it,, says he. \u0027I want to feel the touch of it day and night. It\u0027s my pleasure in life. I come in this room, and I\u0027m a king and a rich man. I\u0027ll be a millionaire in another year. The pile\u0027s getting bigger every month. I\u0027ve got the whole tribe washing out the sands in the creeks. I\u0027m the happiest man in the world, W. D. I just want to be near this gold, and know it\u0027s mine and it\u0027s increasing every day. Now, you know,\u0027 says he, \u0027why my Indians wouldn\u0027t buy your goods. They can\u0027t. They bring all the dust to me. I\u0027m their king. I\u0027ve taught \u0027em not to desire or admire. You might as well shut up shop.\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027ll tell you what you are,\u0027 says I. \u0027You\u0027re a plain, contemptible miser. You preach supply and you forget demand. Now, supply,\u0027 I goes on, \u0027is never anything but supply. On the contrary,\u0027 says I, \u0027demand is a much broader syllogism and assertion. Demand includes the rights of our women and children, and charity and friendship, and even a little begging on the street corners. They\u0027ve both got to harmonize equally. And I\u0027ve got a few things up my commercial sleeve yet,\u0027 says I, \u0027that may jostle your preconceived ideas of politics and economy. \"The next morning I had McClintock bring tip another mule-load of goods to the plaza and open it up. The people gathered around the same as before. \"I got out the finest line of necklaces, bracelets, hair-combs, and earrings that I carried, and had the women put \u0027em on. And then I played trumps. \"Out of my last pack I opened up a half gross of hand-mirrors, with solid tinfoil backs, and passed \u0027em around among the ladies. That was the first introduction of looking-glasses among the Peche Indians. \"Shane walks by with his big laugh. \"\u0027Business looking up any?\u0027 he asks. \"\u0027It\u0027s looking at itself right now,\u0027 says I. \"By-and-by a kind of a murmur goes through the crowd. The women had looked into the magic crystal and seen that they were beautiful, and was confiding the secret to the men. The men seemed to be urging the lack of money and the hard times just before the election, but their excuses didn\u0027t go. \"Then was my time. \"I called McClintock away from an animated conversation with his mules and told him to do some interpreting. \"\u0027Tell \u0027em,\u0027 says I, \u0027that gold-dust will buy for them these befitting ornaments for kings and queens of the earth. Tell \u0027em the yellow sand they wash out of the waters for the High Sanctified Yacomay and Chop Suey of the tribe will buy the precious jewels and charms that will make them beautiful and preserve and pickle them from evil spirits. Tell \u0027em the Pittsburg banks are paying four per cent. interest on deposits by mail, while this get-rich-frequently custodian of the public funds ain\u0027t even paying attention. Keep telling \u0027em, Mac,\u0027 says I, \u0027to let the gold-dust family do their work. Talk to \u0027em like a born anti-Bryanite,\u0027 says I. \u0027Remind \u0027em that Tom Watson\u0027s gone back to Georgia,\u0027 says I. \"McClintock waves his hand affectionately at one of his mules, and then hurls a few stickfuls of minion type at the mob of shoppers. \"A gutta-percha Indian man, with a lady hanging on his arm, with three strings of my fish-scale jewelry and imitation marble beads around her neck, stands up on a block of stone and makes a talk that sounds like a man shaking dice in a box to fill aces and sixes. \"\u0027He says,\u0027 says McClintock, \u0027that the people not know that gold-dust will buy their things. The women very mad. The Grand Yacuma tell them it no good but for keep to make bad spirits keep away.\u0027 \"\u0027You can\u0027t keep bad spirits away from money,\u0027 says I. \"\u0027They say,\u0027 goes on McClintock, \u0027the Yacuma fool them. They raise plenty row.\u0027 \"\u0027Going! Going!\u0027 says I. \u0027Gold-dust or cash takes the entire stock. The dust weighed before you, and taken at sixteen dollars the ounce-- the highest price on the Gaudymala coast.\u0027 \"Then the crowd disperses all of a sudden, and I don\u0027t know what\u0027s up. Mac and me packs away the hand-mirrors and jewelry they had handed back to us, and we had the mules back to the corral they had set apart for our garage. \"While we was there we hear great noises of shouting, and down across the plaza runs Patrick Shane, hotfoot, with his clothes ripped half off, and scratches on his face like a cat had fought him hard for every one of its lives. \"\u0027They\u0027re looting the treasury, W. D.,\u0027 he sings out. \u0027They\u0027re going to kill me and you, too. Unlimber a couple of mules at once. We\u0027ll have to make a get-away in a couple of minutes.\u0027 \"\u0027They\u0027ve found out,\u0027 says I,\u0027 the truth about the law of supply and demand.\u0027 \"\u0027It\u0027s the women, mostly,\u0027 says the King. \u0027And they used to admire me so!\u0027 \"\u0027They hadn\u0027t seen looking-glasses then,\u0027 says I. \"\u0027They\u0027ve got knives and hatchets,\u0027 says Shane; \u0027hurry !\u0027 \"\u0027Take that roan mule,\u0027 says I. \u0027You and your law of supply! I\u0027ll ride the dun, for he\u0027s two knots per hour the faster. The roan has a stiff knee, but he may make it,\u0027 says I. \u0027If you\u0027d included reciprocity in your political platform I might have given you the dun,\u0027 says I. \"Shane and McClintock and me mounted our mules and rode across the rawhide bridge just as the Peches reached the other side and began firing stones and long knives at us. We cut the thongs that held up our end of the bridge and headed for the coast.\" A tall, bulky policeman came into Finch\u0027s shop at that moment and leaned an elbow on the showcase. Finch nodded at him friendly. \"I heard down at Casey\u0027s,\" said the cop, in rumbling, husky tones, \"that there was going to be a picnic of the Hat-Cleaners\u0027 Union over at Bergen Beach, Sunday. Is that right?\" \"Sure,\" said Finch. \"There\u0027ll be a dandy time.\" \"Gimme five tickets,\" said the cop, throwing a five-dollar bill on the showcase. \"Why,\u0027\u0027 said Finch, \"ain\u0027t you going it a little too--\" \"Go to h--!\" said the cop. \"You got \u0027em to sell, ain\u0027t you? Somebody\u0027s got to buy \u0027em. Wish I could go along.\" I was glad to See Finch so well thought of in his neighborhood. And then in came a wee girl of seven, with dirty face and pure blue eyes and a smutched and insufficient dress. \"Mamma says,\" she recited shrilly, \"that you must give me eighty cents for the grocer and nineteen for the milkman and five cents for me to buy hokey-pokey with--but she didn\u0027t say that,\" the elf concluded, with a hopeful but honest grin. Finch shelled out the money, counting it twice, but I noticed that the total sum that the small girl received was one dollar and four cents. \"That\u0027s the right kind of a law,\" remarked Finch, as he carefully broke some of the stitches of my hatband so that it would assuredly come off within a few days--\"the law of supply and demand. But they\u0027ve both got to work together. I\u0027ll bet,\" he went on, with his dry smile, \"she\u0027ll get jelly beans with that nickel--she likes \u0027em. What\u0027s supply if there\u0027s no demand for it?\" \"What ever became of the King?\" I asked, curiously. \u0027\u0027Oh, I might have told you,\" said Finch. \"That was Shane came in and bought the tickets. He came back with me, and he\u0027s on the force now.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/42/1332.html","bookId":617,"book":{"id":617,"title":"The Stories Of O.Henry欧亨利短篇小说集","description":"简介： O.
