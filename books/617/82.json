{"id":42962,"no":82,"title":"The Rose of Dixie","content":"When The Rose of Dixie magazine was started by a stock company in Toombs City, Georgia, there was never but one candidate for its chief editorial position in the minds of its owners. Col. Aquila Telfair was the man for the place. By all the rights of learning, family, reputation, and Southern traditions, he was its foreordained, fit, and logical editor. So, a committee of the patriotic Georgia citizens who had subscribed the founding fund of $100,000 called upon Colonel Telfair at his residence, Cedar Heights, fearful lest the enterprise and the South should suffer by his possible refusal. The colonel received them in his great library, where he spent most of his days. The library had descended to him from his father. It contained ten thousand volumes, some of which had been published as late as the year 1861. When the deputation arrived, Colonel Telfair was seated at his massive white-pine centre-table, reading Burton\u0027s Anatomy of Melancholy. He arose and shook hands punctiliously with each member of the committee. If you were familiar with The Rose of Dixie you will remember the colonel\u0027s portrait, which appeared in it from time to time. You could not forget the long, carefully brushed white hair; the hooked, high-bridged nose, slightly twisted to the left; the keen eyes under the still black eyebrows; the classic mouth beneath the drooping white mustache, slightly frazzled at the ends. The committee solicitously offered him the position of managing editor, humbly presenting an outline of the field that the publication was designed to cover and mentioning a comfortable salary. The colonel\u0027s lands were growing poorer each year and were much cut up by red gullies. Besides, the honor was not one to be refused. In a forty-minute speech of acceptance, Colonel Telfair gave an outline of English literature from Chaucer to Macaulay, re-fought the battle of Chancellorsville, and said that, God helping him, he would so conduct The Rose of Dixie that its fragrance and beauty would permeate the entire world, hurling back into the teeth of the Northern minions their belief that no genius or good could exist in the brains and hearts of the people whose property they had destroyed and whose rights they had curtailed. Offices for the magazine were partitioned off and furnished in the second floor of the First National Bank building; and it was for the colonel to cause The Rose of Dixie to blossom and flourish or to wilt in the balmy air of the land of flowers. The staff of assistants and contributors that Editor-Colonel Telfair drew about him was a peach. It was a whole crate of Georgia peaches. The first assistant editor, Tolliver Lee Fairfax, had had a father killed during Pickett\u0027s charge. The second assistant, Keats Unthank, was the nephew of one of Morgan\u0027s Raiders. The book reviewer, Jackson Rockingham, had been the youngest soldier in the Confederate army, having appeared on the field of battle with a sword in one hand and a milk-bottle in the other. The art editor, Roncesvalles Sykes, was a third cousin to a nephew of Jefferson Davis. Miss Lavinia Terhune, the colonel\u0027s stenographer and typewriter, had an aunt who had once been kissed by Stonewall Jackson. Tommy Webster, the head office-boy, got his job by having recited Father Ryan\u0027s poems, complete, at the commencement exercises of the Toombs City High School. The girls who wrapped and addressed the magazines were members of old Southern families in Reduced Circumstances. The cashier was a scrub named Hawkins, from Ann Arbor, Michigan, who had recommendations and a bond from a guarantee company filed with the owners. Even Georgia stock companies sometimes realize that it takes live ones to bury the dead. Well, sir, if you believe me, The Rose of Dixie blossomed five times before anybody heard of it except the people who buy their hooks and eyes in Toombs City. Then Hawkins climbed off his stool and told on \u0027em to the stock company. Even in Ann Arbor he had been used to having his business propositions heard of at least as far away as Detroit. So an advertising manager was engaged -- Beauregard Fitzhugh Banks, a young man in a lavender necktie, whose grandfather had been the Exalted High Pillow-slip of the Kuklux Klan. In spite of which The Rose of Dixie kept coming out every month. Although in every issue it ran photos of either the Taj Mahal or the Luxembourg Gardens, or Carmencita or La Follette, a certain number of people bought it and subscribed for it. As a boom for it, Editor- Colonel Telfair ran three different views of Andrew Jackson\u0027s old home, \"The Hermitage,\" a full-page engraving of the second battle of Manassas, entitled \"Lee to the Rear!\" and a five-thousand-word biography of Belle Boyd in the same number. The subscription list that month advanced 118. Also there were poems in the same issue by Leonina Vashti Haricot (pen-name), related to the Haricots of Charleston, South Carolina, and Bill Thompson, nephew of one of the stockholders. And an article from a special society correspondent describing a tea-party given by the swell Boston and English set, where a lot of tea was spilled overboard by some of the guests masquerading as Indians. One day a person whose breath would easily cloud a mirror, he was so much alive, entered the office of The Rose of Dixie. He was a man about the size of a real-estate agent, with a self-tied tie and a manner that he must have borrowed conjointly from W J. Bryan, Hackenschmidt, and Hetty Green. He was shown into the editor- colonel\u0027s pons asinorum. Colonel Telfair rose and began a Prince Albert bow. \"I\u0027m Thacker,\" said the intruder, taking the editor\u0027s chair--\"T. T. Thacker, of New York.\" He dribbled hastily upon the colonel\u0027s desk some cards, a bulky manila envelope, and a letter from the owners of The Rose of Dixie. This letter introduced Mr. Thacker, and politely requested Colonel Telfair to give him a conference and whatever information about the magazine he might desire. \"I\u0027ve been corresponding with the secretary of the magazine owners for some time,\" said Thacker, briskly. \"I\u0027m a practical magazine man myself, and a circulation booster as good as any, if I do say it. I\u0027ll guarantee an increase of anywhere from ten thousand to a hundred thousand a year for any publication that isn\u0027t printed in a dead language. I\u0027ve had my eye on The Rose of Dixie ever since it started. I know every end of the business from editing to setting up the classified ads. Now, I\u0027ve come down here to put a good bunch of money in the magazine, if I can see my way clear. It ought to be made to pay. The secretary tells me it\u0027s losing money. I don\u0027t see why a magazine in the South, if it\u0027s properly handled, shouldn\u0027t get a good circulation in the North, too. \"Colonel Telfair leaned back in his chair and polished his gold-rimmed glasses. \"Mr. Thacker,\" said he, courteously but firmly, \"The Rose of Dixie is a publication devoted to the fostering and the voicing of Southern genius. Its watchword, which you may have seen on the cover, is \u0027Of, For, and By the South.\u0027\" \"But you wouldn\u0027t object to a Northern circulation, would you?\" asked Thacker. \"I suppose,\" said the editor-colonel, \"that it is customary to open the circulation lists to all. I do not know. I have nothing to do with the business affairs of the magazine. I was called upon to assume editorial control of it, and I have devoted to its conduct such poor literary talents as I may possess and whatever store of erudition I may have acquired.\" \"Sure,\" said Thacker. \"But a dollar is a dollar anywhere, North, South, or West--whether you\u0027re buying codfish, goober peas, or Rocky Ford cantaloupes. Now, I\u0027ve been looking over your November number. I see one here on your desk. You don\u0027t mind running over it with me? \"Well, your leading article is all right. A good write-up of the cotton-belt with plenty of photographs is a winner any time. New York is always interested in the cotton crop. And this sensational account of Hatfield-McCoy feud, by a schoolmate of a niece of the Governor of Kentucky, isn\u0027t such a bad idea. It happened so long ago that most people have forgotten it. Now, here\u0027s a poem three pages long called \u0027The Tyrant\u0027s Foot,\u0027 by Lorella Lascelles. I\u0027ve pawed around a good deal over manuscripts, but I never saw her name on a rejection slip.\" \"Miss Lascelles,\" said the editor, \"is one of our most widely recognized Southern poetesses. She is closely related to the Alabama Lascelles family, and made with her own hands the silken Confederate banner that was presented to the governor of that state at his inauguration.\" \"But why,\" persisted Thacker, \"is the poem illustrated with a view of the M. \u0026 0. Railroad freight depot at Tuscaloosa?\" \"The illustration,\" said the colonel, with dignity, \"shows a corner of the fence surrounding the old homestead where Miss Lascelles was born.\" \"All right,\" said Thacker. \"I read the poem, but I couldn\u0027t tell whether it was about the depot of the battle of Bull Run. Now, here\u0027s a short story called \u0027Rosies\u0027 Temptation,\u0027 by Fosdyke Piggott. It\u0027s rotten. What is a Piggott, anyway?\" \"Mr. Piggott,\" said the editor, \"is a brother of the principal stockholder of the magazine.\" \"All\u0027s right with the world--Piggott passes,\" said Thacker. \"Well this article on Arctic exploration and the one on tarpon fishing might go. But how about this write-up of the Atlanta, New Orleans, Nashville, and Savannah breweries? It seems to consist mainly of statistics about their output and the quality of their beer. What\u0027s the chip over the bug?\" \"If I understand your figurative language,\" answered Colonel Telfair, \"it is this: the article you refer to was handed to me by the owners of the magazine with instructions to publish it. The literary quality of it did not appeal to me. But, in a measure, I feel impelled to conform, in certain matters, to the wishes of the gentlemen who are interested in the financial side of The Rose.\" \"I see,\" said Thacker. \"Next we have two pages of selections from \u0027Lalla Rookh,\u0027 by Thomas Moore. Now, what Federal prison did Moore escape from, or what\u0027s the name of the F. F. V. family that he carries as a handicap?\" \"Moore was an Irish poet who died in 1852,\" said Colonel Telfair, pityingly. \"He is a classic. I have been thinking of reprinting his translation of Anacreon serially in the magazine.\" \"Look out for the copyright laws,\" said Thacker, flippantly. Who\u0027s Bessie Belleclair, who contributes the essay on the newly completed water-works plant in Milledgeville?\" \"The name, sir,\" said Colonel Telfair, \"is the nom de guerre of Miss Elvira Simpkins. I have not the honor of knowing the lady; but her contribution was sent to us by Congressman Brower, of her native state. Congressman Brower\u0027s mother was related to the Polks of Tennessee. \"Now, see here, Colonel,\" said Thacker, throwing down the magazine, \"this won\u0027t do. You can\u0027t successfully run a magazine for one particular section of the country. You\u0027ve got to make a universal appeal. Look how the Northern publications have catered to the South and encouraged the Southern writers. And you\u0027ve got to go far and wide for your contributors. You\u0027ve got to buy stuff according to its quality without any regard to the pedigree of the author. Now, I\u0027ll bet a quart of ink that this Southern parlor organ you\u0027ve been running has never played a note that originated about Mason \u0026 Hamlin\u0027s line. Am I right?\" \"I have carefully and conscientiously rejected all contributions from that section of the country--if I understand your figurative language aright,\" replied the colonel. \"All right. Now I\u0027ll show you something.\" Thacker reached for his thick manila envelope and dumped a mass of typewritten manuscript on the editors desk. \"Here\u0027s some truck,\" said he, \"that I paid cash for, and brought along with me.\" One by one he folded back the manuscripts and showed their first pages to the colonel. Here are four short stories four of the highest priced authors in the United States--three of \u0027em living in New York, and one commuting. There\u0027s a special article on Vienna-bred society by Tom Vampson. Here\u0027s an Italian serial by Captain Jack--no--it\u0027s the other Crawford. Here are three separate exposes of city governments by Sniffings, and here\u0027s a dandy entitled \u0027What Women Carry in Dress-Suit Cases\u0027--a Chicago newspaper woman hired herself out for five years as a lady\u0027s maid to get that information. And here\u0027s a Synopsis of Preceding Chapters of Hall Caine\u0027s new serial to appear next June. And here\u0027s a couple of pounds of vers de societe that I got at a rate from the clever magazines. That\u0027s the stuff that people everywhere want. And now here\u0027s a writeup with photographs at the ages of four, twelve, twenty-two, and thirty of George B. McClellan. It\u0027s a prognostication. He\u0027s bound to be elected Mayor of New York. It \u002711 make a big hit all over the country. He--\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Colonel Telfair, stiffening in his chair. \"What was the name?\" \"Oh, I see,\" said Thacker, with half a grin. Yes, he\u0027s a son of the General. We\u0027ll pass that manuscript up. But, if you\u0027ll excuse me, Colonel, it\u0027s a magazine we\u0027re trying to make go off--not the first gun at Fort Sumter. Now, here\u0027s a thing that\u0027s bound to get next to you. It\u0027s an original poem by James Whitcomb Riley. J.W. himself. You know what that means to a magazine. I won\u0027t tell you what I had to pay for that poem; but I\u0027ll tell you this--Riley can make more money writing with a fountain-pen than you or I can with one that lets the ink run. I\u0027ll read you the last two stanzas: \"I am not unfamiliar with the works of Mr. Riley,\" said the colonel, deliberately. \"I believe he lives in Indiana. For the last ten years I have been somewhat of a literary recluse, and am familiar with nearly all the books in the Cedar Heights library. I am also of the opinion that a magazine should contain a certain amount of poetry. Many of the sweetest singers of the South have already contributed to the pages of The Rose of Dixie. I, myself, have thought of translating from the original for publication in its pages the works of the great Italian poet Tasso. Have you ever drunk from the fountain of this immortal poet\u0027s lines, Mr. Thacker?\" \"Not even a demi-Tasso,\" said Thacker. Now, let\u0027s come to the point, Colonel Telfair. I\u0027ve already invested some money in this as a flyer. That bunch of manuscripts cost me $4,000. My object was to try a number of them in the next issue-I believe you make up less than a month ahead--and see what effect it has on the circulation. I believe that by printing the best stuff we can get in the North, South, East, or West we can make the magazine go. You have there the letter from the owning company asking you to co-operate with me in the plan. Let\u0027s chuck out some of this slush that you\u0027ve been publishing just because the writers are related to the Skoopdoodles of Skoopdoodle County. Are you with me?\" \"As long as I continue to be the editor of The Rose,\" said Colonel Telfair, with dignity, \"I shall be its editor. But I desire also to conform to the wishes of its owners if I can do so conscientiously.\" \"That\u0027s the talk,\" said Thacker, briskly. \"Now, how much of this stuff I\u0027ve brought can we get into the January number? We want to begin right away.\" \"There is yet space in the January number,\" said the editor, \"for about eight thousand words, roughly estimated.\" \"Great!\" said Thacker. \"It isn\u0027t much, but it\u0027ll give the readers some change from goobers, governors, and Gettysburg. I\u0027ll leave the selection of the stuff I brought to fill the space to you, as it\u0027s all good. I\u0027ve got to run back to New York, and I\u0027ll be down again in a couple of weeks.\" Colonel Telfair slowly swung his eye-glasses by their broad, black ribbon. \"The space in the January number that I referred to,\" said he, measuredly, \"has been held open purposely, pending a decision that I have not yet made. A short time ago a contribution was submitted to The Rose of Dixie that is one of the most remarkable literary efforts that has ever come under my observation. None but a master mind and talent could have produced it. It would just fill the space that I have reserved for its possible use.\" Thacker looked anxious. \"What kind of stuff is it?\" he asked. \"Eight thousand words sounds suspicious. The oldest families must have been collaborating. Is there going to be another secession ?\" \"The author of the article,\" continued the colonel, ignoring Thacker\u0027s allusions, \"is a writer of some reputation. He has also distinguished himself in other ways. I do not feel at liberty to reveal to you his name--at least not until I have decided whether or not to accept his contribution.\" \"Well,\" said Thacker, nervously, \"is it a continued story, or an account of the unveiling of the new town pump in Whitmire, South Carolina, or a revised list of General Lee\u0027s body-servants, or what?\" \"You are disposed to be facetious,\" said Colonel Telfair, calmly. \"The article is from the pen of a thinker, a philosopher, a lover of mankind, a student, and a rhetorician of high degree.\" \"It must have been written by a syndicate,\" said Thacker. \"But, honestly, Colonel, you want to go slow. I don\u0027t know of any eight- thousand-word single doses of written matter that are read by anybody these days, except Supreme Court briefs and reports of murder trials. You haven\u0027t by any accident gotten hold of a copy of one of Daniel Webster\u0027s speeches, have you?\" Colonel Telfair swung a little in his chair and looked steadily from under his bushy eyebrows at the magazine promoter. \"Mr. Thacker,\" he said, gravely, \"I am willing to segregate the somewhat crude expression of your sense of humor from the solicitude that your business investments undoubtedly have conferred upon you. But I must ask you to cease your jibes and derogatory comments upon the South and the Southern people. They, sir, will not be tolerated in the office of The Rose of Dixie for one moment. And before you proceed with more of your covert insinuations that I, the editor of this magazine, am not a competent judge of the merits of the matter submitted to its consideration, I beg that you will first present some evidence or proof that you are my superior in any way, shape, or form relative to the question in hand.\" \"Oh, come, Colonel,\" said Thacker, good-naturedly. \"I didn\u0027t do anything like that to you. It sounds like an indictment by the fourth assistant attorney-general. Let\u0027s get back to business. What\u0027s this 8,000 to 1 shot about?\" \"The article,\" said Colonel Telfair, acknowledging the apology by a slight bow, \"covers a wide area of knowledge. It takes up theories and questions that have puzzled the world for centuries, and disposes of them logically and concisely. One by one it holds up to view the evils of the world, points out the way of eradicating them; and then conscientiously and in detail comments the good. There is hardly a phase of human life that it does not discuss wisely, calmly, and equitably. The great policies of governments, the duties of private citizens, the obligations of home life, law, ethics, morality--all these important subjects are handled with a calm wisdom and confidence that I must confess has captured my admiration.\" \"It must be a crackerjack,\" said Thacker, impressed. \"It is a great contribution to the world\u0027s wisdom,\" said the colonel. \"The only doubt remaining in my mind as to the tremendous advantage it would be to us to give it publication in The Rose of Dixie is that I have not yet sufficient information about the author to give his work publicity in our magazine. \"I thought you said he is a distinguished man,\" said Thacker. \"He is,\" replied the colonel, \"both in literary and in other more diversified and extraneous fields. But I am extremely careful about the matter that I accept for publication. My contributors are people of unquestionable repute and connections, which fact can be verified at any time. As I said, I am holding this article until I can acquire more information about its author. I do not know whether I will publish it or not. If I decide against it, I shall be much pleased, Mr. Thacker, to substitute the matter that you are leaving with me in its place.\" Thacker was somewhat at sea. \"I don\u0027t seem to gather,\" said he, \"much about the gist of this inspired piece of literature. It sounds more like a dark horse than Pegasus to me.\" \"It is a human document,\" said the colonel-editor, confidently, \"from a man of great accomplishments who, in my opinion, has obtained a stronger grasp on the world and its outcomes than that of any man living to-day.\" Thacker rose to his feet excitedly. \"Say!\" he said. \"It isn\u0027t possible that you\u0027ve cornered John D. Rockefeller\u0027s memoirs, is it? Don\u0027t tell me that all at once.\" No, sir,\" said Colonel Telfair. \"I am speaking of mentality and literature not of the less worthy intricacies of trade.\" Well, what\u0027s the trouble about running the article,\" asked Thacker, a little impatiently, \"if the man\u0027s well known and has got the stuff ?\" Colonel Telfair sighed. \"Mr. Thacker,\" said he, \"for once I have been tempted. Nothing has yet appeared in The Rose of Dixie that has not been from the pen of one of its sons or daughters. I know little about the author of this article except that he has acquired prominence in a section of the country that has always been inimical to my heart and mind. But I recognize his genius; and, as I have told you, I have instituted an investigation of his personality. Perhaps it will be futile. But I shall pursue the inquiry. Until that is finished, I must leave open the question of filling the vacant space in our January number.\" Thacker arose to leave. \"All right, Colonel,\" he said, as cordially as he could. \"You use your own judgment. If you\u0027ve really got a scoop or something that will make \u0027em sit up, run it instead of my stuff. I\u0027ll drop in again in about two weeks. Good luck!\" Colonel Telfair and the magazine promoter shook hands. Returning a fortnight later, Thacker dropped off a very rocky Pullman at Toombs City. He found the January number of the magazine made up and the forms closed. The vacant space that had been yawning for type was filled by an article that was headed thus: SECOND MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Written for THE ROSE OF DIXIE BY A Member of the Well-known BULLOCH FAMILY, OF GEORGIA T.
