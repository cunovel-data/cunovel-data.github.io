We were no longer hugging, but our hands were joined. Around us, my fellow students gawped as though they were witnessing the end of the universe.\n \"Where have...\" Debbie started, then glanced around. Realizing we were the centre of attention, she let go of my hands and smiled sheepishly. \"Darren and I are old friends,\" she explained to the class. \"We haven\u0027t seen each other in...\"\n Again she stopped, this time with a frown. \"Excuse us,\" she muttered, grabbing my right hand and roughly leading the way outside. Closing the door, she swung me up against a wall, checked to make sure we were alone in the hall, leant in close and hissed, \"Where the hell have you been all these years?\"\n \"Here and there,\" I smiled, eyes roving her face, stunned by how much she\u0027d changed. She was taller too - even taller than me now.\n \"Why is your face the same?\" she snapped. \"You look almost exactly as I remember you. You\u0027ve aged a year or two, but it\u0027s been thirteen years!\"\n \"How time flies,\" I smirked, then stole a quick kiss. \"Good to see you again, Miss Hemlock.\"\n Debbie froze at the kiss, then took a step back. \"Don\u0027t do that.\"\n \"Sorry. Just glad to see you.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad to see you too. But if anyone sees me kissing a student...\"\n \"Oh, Debbie, I\u0027m not really a student. You know that. I\u0027m old enough to be... Well, you know how old I am.\"\n \"I thought I did. But your face...\" She traced the outline of my jaw, then my lips and nose, then the small triangular scar above my right eye. \"You\u0027ve been in the wars,\" she noted.\n \"You wouldn\u0027t believe it if I told you how right you are,\" I smiled.\n \"Darren Shan.\" She shook her head and repeated my name. \"Darren Shan.\"\n Then she slapped me!\n \"What\u0027s that for?\" I yelped.\n \"For leaving without saying goodbye and ruining my Christmas,\" she growled.\n \"That was thirteen years ago. Surely you\u0027re not still upset about it.\"\n \"The Hemlocks can carry a grudge a long, long time,\" she said, but there was the glint of a smile in her eyes.\n \"I did leave you a going-away present,\" I said.\n For a moment her face was blank. Then she remembered. \"The tree!\"\n Mr. Crepsley and me had killed the mad vampaneze - Murlough - in Debbie\u0027s house on Christmas Eve, after using her as bait to lure him out of his lair. Before leaving, I\u0027d placed a small Christmas tree by her bedside and decorated it (I\u0027d drugged Debbie and her parents earlier, so they were unconscious when Murlough attacked).\n \"I\u0027d forgotten about the tree,\" she muttered. \"Which brings us to another point - what happened back then? One moment we were sitting down to dinner, the next I woke up in bed and it was late Christmas Day. Mum and Dad woke in their beds too, with no idea of how they got there.\"\n \"How are Donna and Jesse?\" I asked, trying to avoid her question.\n \"Fine. Dad\u0027s still travelling the world, going wherever his work takes him, and Mum\u0027s started a new... No,\" she said, prodding me in the chest. \"Forget what\u0027s been going on with me. I want to know what\u0027s up with you. For thirteen years you\u0027ve been a fond memory. I tried finding you a few times, but you\u0027d vanished without a trace. Now you waltz back into my life, looking as though the years had been months. I want to know what gives.\"\n \"It\u0027s a long story,\" I sighed. \"And complicated.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got time,\" she sniffed.\n \"No, you haven\u0027t,\" I contradicted her, nodding at the closed classroom door.\n \"Damn. I forgot about them.\" She strode to the door and opened it. The kids inside had been talking loudly, but they stopped at the sight of their teacher. \"Get out your books!\" she snapped. \"I\u0027ll be with you presently.\" Facing me again, she said, \"You\u0027re right - we don\u0027t have time. And my schedule\u0027s full for the rest of the day - I\u0027ve a teachers\u0027 meeting to attend during lunch. But we have to get together soon and talk.\"\n \"How about after school?\" I suggested. \"I\u0027ll go home, change clothes, and we can meet... where?\"\n \"My place,\" Debbie said. \"I live on the third floor of an apartment block. 3c, Bungrove Drive. It\u0027s about a ten-minute walk from here.\"\n \"I\u0027ll find it.\"\n \"But give me a couple of hours to correct homework,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t come before half-six.\"\n \"Sounds perfect.\"\n \"Darren Shan,\" she whispered, a small smile lifting the corners of her mouth. \"Who\u0027d have believed it?\" She leant towards me, and I thought - hoped! - she was going to kiss me, but then she stopped, adopted a stern expression and pushed me back into class ahead of her.\n The lesson passed in a blur. Debbie tried hard not to pay special attention to me, but our eyes kept meeting and we were unable to stop smiling. The others kids noted the remarkable bond between us and it was the talk of the school by lunchtime. If the students had been suspicious of me at the start of the day, now they were downright wary, and everyone gave me a wide berth.\n I breezed through the later classes. It didn\u0027t bother me that I was out of my depth and ignorant of the subject matter. I no longer cared or tried to act clued up. Debbie was all I could think about. Even when Mr. Smarts threw my maths copy at me in science and bawled furiously, I only smiled, nodded and tuned him out.\n At the end of the day I rushed back to the hotel. I\u0027d been given the key to a locker, where I was supposed to leave my books, but I was so excited I didn\u0027t bother with it, and carried the full bag of books home with me. Mr. Crepsley was still in bed when I arrived, but Harkat was awake, and I hurriedly told him about my day and meeting Debbie.\n \"Isn\u0027t it wonderful?\" I finished breathlessly. \"Isn\u0027t it incredible? Isn\u0027t it the most...\" I couldn\u0027t think of any way to describe it, so I simply threw my hands into the air and yelled, \"Yahoo!\"\n \"It\u0027s great,\" Harkat said, wide mouth spreading into a jagged smile, but he didn\u0027t sound happy.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked, reading the unease in his round green eyes.\n \"Nothing,\" he said. \"It\u0027s great. Really. I\u0027m thrilled for you.\"\n \"Don\u0027t lie to me, Harkat. Something\u0027s bugging you. What?\"\n He came out with it. \"Doesn\u0027t this seem a bit... too coincidental?\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Of all the schools you could have gone to... all the teachers in the world... you end up at the one where your... old girlfriend\u0027s teaching? And in her class?\"\n \"Life\u0027s like that, Harkat. Strange things happen all the time.\"\n \"Yes,\" the Little Person agreed. \"And sometimes they happen... by chance. But other times they\u0027re... arranged.\"\n I\u0027d been unbuttoning my shirt, having slipped off my jumper and tie. Now I paused, fingers on the buttons, and studied him. \"What are you saying?\"\n \"Something smells rotten. If you\u0027d run into Debbie in the street, that... would be something else. But you\u0027re in her class at a school where... you shouldn\u0027t be. Somebody set you up to go to Mahler\u0027s, someone who... knows about Murlough, and about your past.\"\n \"You think the person who forged our signatures knew Debbie was working at Mahler\u0027s?\" I asked.\n \"That\u0027s obvious,\" Harkat said. \"And that in itself is cause for worry. But there\u0027s something else we... must consider. What if the person who set you up didn\u0027t... just know about Debbie - what if it was Debbie?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allies-of-the-night-the-saga-of-darren-shan-8/page-6.html","bookId":2444,"book":{"id":2444,"title":"Allies of the Night (The Saga of Darren Shan #8)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #8: Allies of the Night \n Allies of the Night is the eighth book of The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan.
