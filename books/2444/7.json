{"id":79515,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"I COULDN\u0027T believe Debbie was in league with the vampaneze or Mr. Tiny, or had played any part in setting me up to go to Mahler\u0027s. I told Harkat how stunned she\u0027d been to see me, but he said she might have been acting. \"If she went to all the trouble of getting... you there, she\u0027d hardly not act surprised,\" he noted.\n I shook my head stubbornly. \"She wouldn\u0027t do something like this.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know her, so I can\u0027t voice... an opinion. But you don\u0027t really know her either. She was a child when you... last saw her. People change as they grow.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think I should trust her?\"\n \"I\u0027m not saying that. Maybe she\u0027s genuine. Maybe she had nothing to do with faking the... forms, or with you being there - it could be a... huge coincidence. But caution is required. Go see her, but keep an eye... on her. Be careful what you say. Put some probing questions to her. And take a weapon.\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t hurt her,\" I said quietly. \"Even if she has plotted against us, there\u0027s no way I could kill her.\"\n \"Take one anyway,\" Harkat insisted. \"If she\u0027s working with the vampaneze, it may not be... her you have to use it on.\"\n \"You reckon the vampaneze could be lying in wait there?\"\n \"Maybe. We couldn\u0027t understand why... the vampaneze - if they\u0027re behind the fake forms - would send you... to school. If they\u0027re working with Debbie - or using... her - this might explain it.\"\n \"You mean they want to get me at Debbie\u0027s alone, so they can pick me off?\"\n \"They might.\"\n I nodded thoughtfully. I didn\u0027t believe Debbie was working with our foes, but it was possible that they were manipulating her to get to me. \"How should we handle this?\" I asked.\n Harkat\u0027s green eyes betrayed his uncertainty. \"I\u0027m not sure. It would be foolish to walk into... a trap. But sometimes risks must be taken. Perhaps this is our way to flush out... those who would ensnare us.\"\n Chewing my lower lip, I brooded upon it a while, then followed the most sensible course of action - I went and woke Mr. Crepsley.\n I rang the bell for 3c and waited. A moment later, Debbie\u0027s voice came over the intercom. \"Darren?\"\n \"The one and only.\"\n \"You\u0027re late.\" It was twenty past seven. The sun was setting.\n \"Got stuck doing homework. Blame my English teacher - she\u0027s a real dragon.\"\n \"Ha-flaming-ha.\"\n There was a buzzing noise and the door opened. I paused before entering and looked across the street at the opposite block of apartments. I spotted a lurking shadow on the roof - Mr. Crepsley. Harkat was behind Debbie\u0027s building. Both would rush to my rescue at the first sign of trouble. That was the plan we\u0027d hatched. Mr. Crepsley had suggested beating a hasty retreat - things were getting too complicated for his liking - but when I pulled rank, he\u0027d agreed to make the most of the situation and attempt to turn the tables on our opponents - if they showed.\n \"If a fight develops,\" he warned me before setting out, \"it may not be possible to choose targets. You are not prepared to raise a hand against your friend, but I am, if she is working with the enemy. Do not get in my way if that happens.\"\n I nodded grimly. I wasn\u0027t sure I could stand by and let him harm Debbie, even if it turned out that she was conspiring against us - but I\u0027d try.\n Trotting up the stairs, I was painfully aware of the two knives I was carrying, strapped to my calves so as not to show. I hoped I wouldn\u0027t have to use them, but it was good to know they were there if needed.\n The door to 3c was open, but I knocked before entering. \"Come in,\" Debbie called. \"I\u0027m in the kitchen.\"\n I closed the door but didn\u0027t lock it. Quickly scanned the apartment. Very tidy. Several bookcases, overflowing with books. A CD player and stand; lots of CDs. A portable TV set. A cover poster of The Lord of the Rings on one wall, a picture of Debbie with her parents on another.\n Debbie stepped in from the kitchen. She was wearing a long red apron and there was flour in her hair. \"I got bored waiting for you,\" she said, \"so I started to make scones. Do you like yours with currants or without?\"\n \"Without,\" I said and smiled as she ducked back into the kitchen - killers and their cohorts don\u0027t greet you with flour in their hair! Any half-doubts I had about Debbie quickly vanished and I knew I\u0027d nothing to fear from her. But I didn\u0027t drop my guard - Debbie didn\u0027t pose a threat, but there might be vampaneze in the room next door or hovering on the fire escape.\n \"How did you enjoy your first day at school?\" Debbie asked, as I wandered round the living room.\n \"It was strange. I haven\u0027t been inside a school since... Well, it\u0027s been a long time. So much has changed. When I was...\" I stopped. The cover of a book had caught my eye: The Three Musketeers. \"Is Donna still making you read this?\"\n Debbie poked her head through the doorway and looked at the book. \"Oh,\" she laughed. \"I was reading that when we first met, wasn\u0027t I?\"\n \"Yep. You hated it.\"\n \"Really? That\u0027s odd - I love it now. It\u0027s one of my favourites. I recommend it to my pupils all the time.\"\n Shaking my head wryly, I laid the book down and went to view the kitchen. It was small, but professionally organized. There was a lovely smell of fresh dough. \"Donna taught you well,\" I remarked. Debbie\u0027s mum used to be a chef.\n \"She wouldn\u0027t let me leave home until I could run a good kitchen,\" Debbie smiled. \"Graduating university was easier than passing the tests she set.\"\n \"You\u0027ve been to university?\" I asked.\n \"I\u0027d hardly be teaching if I hadn\u0027t.\"\n Laying a tray of unbaked scones into a petite oven, she switched off the light and motioned me back to the living room. As I flopped into one of the soft chairs she went to the CD stand and looked for something to play. \"Any preferences?\"\n \"Not really.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have much in the way of pop or rock. Jazz or classical?\"\n \"I don\u0027t mind.\"\n Choosing a CD, she took it out of its case, inserted it in the player and turned it on. She stood by the player a couple of minutes while flowing, lifting music filled the air. \"Like it?\" she asked.\n \"Not bad. What is it?\"\n \"The Titan. Do you know who it\u0027s by?\"\n \"Mahler?\" I guessed.\n \"Right. I thought I\u0027d play it for you, so you\u0027re familiar with it - Mr. Chivers gets very upset if his students don\u0027t recognize Mahler.\" Taking the chair next to mine, Debbie studied my face in silence. I felt uncomfortable, but didn\u0027t turn away. \"So,\" she sighed. \"Want to tell me about it?\"\n I\u0027d discussed what I should tell her with Mr. Crepsley and Harkat, and quickly launched into the story we\u0027d settled upon. I said I was the victim of an ageing disease, which meant I aged slower than normal people. I reminded her of the snake-boy, Evra Von, whom she\u0027d met, and said the two of us were patients at a special clinic.\n \"You aren\u0027t brothers?\" she asked.\n \"No. And the man we were with wasn\u0027t our father - he was a nurse at the hospital. That\u0027s why I never let you meet him - it was fun, having you think I was an ordinary person, and I didn\u0027t want him giving the game away.\"\n \"So how old are you?\" she enquired.\n \"Not much older than you,\" I said. \"The disease didn\u0027t set in until I was twelve. I wasn\u0027t very different to other children until then.\"\n She considered that in her careful, thoughtful manner. \"If that\u0027s true,\" she said, \"what are you doing in school now? And why pick mine?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know you were working at Mahler\u0027s,\" I said. \"That\u0027s a freak occurrence. I\u0027ve returned to school because... It\u0027s hard to explain. I didn\u0027t get a proper education when I was growing up. I was rebellious and spent a lot of time off fishing or playing football when I should have been learning. Lately I\u0027ve been feeling like I missed out. A few weeks ago I met a man who forges papers - passports, birth certificates, stuff like that. I asked him to set me up with a fake ID, so I could pretend I was fifteen.\"\n \"Whatever for?\" Debbie asked. \"Why didn\u0027t you go to an adult night school?\"\n \"Because, looks-wise, I\u0027m not an adult.\" I pulled a sad face. \"You don\u0027t know how miserable it gets, growing so slowly, explaining myself to strangers, knowing they\u0027re talking about me. I don\u0027t mingle much. I live alone and stay indoors most of the time. I felt this was an opportunity to pretend I was normal. I thought I could fit in with the people I most resemble - fifteen year olds. I hoped, if I dressed and talked like them, and went to school with them, maybe they\u0027d accept me and I wouldn\u0027t feel so lonely.\" Lowering my gaze; I added mournfully, \"I guess the pretence stops now.\"\n There was a silent beat. Another. Then Debbie said, \"Why should it?\"\n \"Because you know about me. You\u0027ll tell Mr. Chivers. I\u0027ll have to leave.\"\n Debbie reached across and took my left hand in hers. \"I think you\u0027re crazy,\" she said. \"Practically everyone I know couldn\u0027t wait to leave school, and here you are, desperate to return. But I admire you for this. I think it\u0027s great that you want to learn. I think you\u0027re very brave, and I won\u0027t say anything about it.\"\n \"Really?\"\n \"I think you\u0027ll be found out eventually - an act like this is impossible to sustain - but I won\u0027t blow the whistle on you.\"\n \"Thanks, Debbie. I...\" Clearing my throat, I looked at our joined hands. \"I\u0027d like to kiss you - to thank you - but I don\u0027t know if you want me to.\"\n Debbie frowned, and I could see what she was thinking - was it acceptable for a teacher to let one of her pupils kiss her? Then she chuckled and said, \"OK - but just on my cheek.\"\n Lifting my head, I leant over and brushed her cheek with my lips. I would have liked to kiss her properly, but knew I couldn\u0027t. Although we were of similar ages, in her eyes I was still a teenager. There was a line between us we couldn\u0027t step over - much as the adult within me hungered to cross it.\n We talked for hours. I learnt all about Debbie\u0027s life, how she\u0027d gone to university after school, studied English and sociology, graduated and went on to become a teacher. After a few part-time appointments elsewhere, she\u0027d applied for a number of permanent positions here - she\u0027d seen out her schooldays in this city, and felt it was the nearest place she had to a home. She ended up at Mahler\u0027s. She\u0027d been there two years and loved it. There\u0027d been men in her life - she\u0027d been engaged at one stage! - but none at the moment. And she said - very pointedly - that she wasn\u0027t looking for any either!\n She asked me about that night thirteen years ago and what had happened to her and her parents. I lied and said there\u0027d been something wrong with the wine. \"You all fell asleep at the table. I rang for the nurse who was looking after Evra and me. He came, checked, said you were OK and would be fine when you woke. We put the three of you to bed and I slipped away. I\u0027ve never been good at saying farewell.\"\n I told Debbie I was living alone. If she checked with Mr. Blaws, she\u0027d know that was a lie, but I didn\u0027t think ordinary teachers mixed much with inspectors.\n \"It\u0027s going to be bizarre having you in my class,\" she murmured. We were sitting on the couch. \"We\u0027ll have to be careful. If anyone suspects there was ever anything between us, we must tell the truth. It\u0027d mean my career if we didn\u0027t.\"\n \"Maybe it\u0027s a problem we won\u0027t have to worry about much longer,\" I said.\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m cut out for school. I\u0027m behind in all the subjects. In some - maths and science - I\u0027m not even within sighting distance of everyone else. I think I\u0027ll have to drop out.\"\n \"That\u0027s quitting talk,\" she growled, \"and I won\u0027t stand for it.\" She popped one of the scones - they were chestnut brown, smeared with butter and jam - into my mouth and made me munch on it. \"Finish what you start or you\u0027ll regret it.\"\n \"Buh I cahn\u0027t duh iht,\" I mumbled, mouth full of scone.\n \"Of course you can,\" she insisted. \"It won\u0027t be easy. You\u0027ll have to study hard, maybe get some private tuition...\" She stopped and her face lit up. \"That\u0027s it!\"\n \"What?\" I asked.\n \"You can come to me for lessons.\"\n \"What sort of lessons?\"\n She punched my arm. \"School lessons, you ninny! You can come round for an hour or two after school every day. I\u0027ll help you with your homework and fill you in on stuff you\u0027ve missed.\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t mind?\" I asked.\n \"Of course not,\" she smiled. \"It will be a pleasure.\"\n Enjoyable as the night was, it had to end eventually. I\u0027d forgotten about the possible threat of the vampaneze, but when Debbie excused herself and went to the bathroom, I fell to thinking about them, and wondered if Mr. Crepsley or Harkat had sighted any - I didn\u0027t want to come to Debbie\u0027s for lessons if it meant getting her mixed up in our dangerous affairs.\n If I waited for her to return, I might forget about the threat again, so I composed a quick note - \u0027Have to go. Wonderful to see you. Meet you at school in the morning. Hope you won\u0027t mind if I don\u0027t do my homework! - left it on the bare plate which had contained the scones, and ducked out as quietly as possible.\n I trotted down the stairs, humming happily, paused outside the main door at the bottom and let rip with three long whistles - my signal to Mr. Crepsley to let him know that I was leaving. Then I made my way round to the back of the building and found Harkat hiding behind a couple of large black rubbish bins. \"Any trouble?\" I asked.\n \"None,\" he replied. \"Nobody\u0027s gone near the place.\"\n Mr. Crepsley arrived and crouched behind the bins with us. He looked more solemn than usual. \"Spot any vampaneze?\" I asked.\n \"No.\"\n \"Mr. Tiny?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Things are looking good then,\" I smiled.\n \"What about Debbie?\" Harkat asked. \"Is she on the level?\"\n \"Oh, yes.\" I gave them a quick account of my conversation with Debbie. Mr. Crepsley said nothing, only grunted as I filled him in. He appeared very moody and distant.\n \"... so we\u0027ve arranged to meet each evening after school,\" I finished. \"We haven\u0027t set a time yet. I wanted to discuss it with you two first, to see if you want to shadow us when we meet. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any need - I\u0027m sure Debbie isn\u0027t part of a plot - but if you want, we can schedule the lessons for late at night.\"\n Mr. Crepsley sighed half-heartedly. \"I do not think that will be necessary. I have scouted the area thoroughly. There is no evidence of the vampaneze. It would be preferable if you came in daylight, but not essential.\"\n \"Is that a seal of approval?\"\n \"Yes.\" Again he sounded unusually downhearted.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked. \"You\u0027re not still suspicious of Debbie, are you?\"\n \"It has nothing to do with her. I...\" He looked at us sadly. \"I have bad news.\"\n \"Oh?\" Harkat and me exchanged uncertain glances.\n \"Mika Ver Leth transmitted a short telepathic message to me while you were inside.\"\n \"Is this about the Lord of the Vampaneze?\" I asked nervously.\n \"No. It is about our friend, your fellow Prince, Paris Skyle. He...\" Mr. Crepsley sighed again, then said dully, \"Paris is dead.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allies-of-the-night-the-saga-of-darren-shan-8/page-7.html","bookId":2444,"book":{"id":2444,"title":"Allies of the Night (The Saga of Darren Shan #8)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #8: Allies of the Night \n Allies of the Night is the eighth book of The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan.
