I was stunned beyond anything but passive observation. Debbie Hemlock walking into my English class had left me gobsmacked - but Steve Leopard (his real name was Leonard) turning up out of the blue like this was ten times as shocking.\\n\\n After a handful of anxious seconds, Steve lowered the arrow gun, then jammed it through a belt behind his back. He extended his hands, took my left arm above the elbow, and hauled me to my feet. I rose obediently, a puppet in his hands.\\n\\n \"Had you going for a minute, didn\u0027t I?\" he said - and smiled.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going to kill me?\" I wheezed.\\n\\n \"Hardly!\" He took my right hand and shook it awkwardly. \"Hello, Darren. Good to see you again, old friend.\"\\n\\n I stared at our clasped hands, then at his face. Then I threw my arms around him and hugged him for dear life. \"Steve!\" I sobbed into his shoulder.\\n\\n \"Stop that,\" he muttered and I could hear the sound of his own voice breaking. \"You\u0027ll have me in tears if you keep it up.\" Pushing me away, he wiped around his eyes and grinned.\\n\\n I dried my cheeks and beamed. \"It\u0027s really you!\"\\n\\n \"Of course. You don\u0027t think two people could be born this handsome, do you?\"\\n\\n \"Modest as ever,\" I noted wryly.\\n\\n \"Nothing to be modest about,\" he sniffed, then laughed. \"You able to walk?\"\\n\\n \"I think a hobble\u0027s the best I can manage,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Then lean on me. I don\u0027t want to hang around. Hooky might come back with his friends.\"\\n\\n \"Hooky? Oh, you mean the vampa-\" I stopped, wondering how much Steve knew about the creatures of the night.\\n\\n \"The vampaneze,\" he finished, nodding soberly.\\n\\n \"You know about them?\"\\n\\n \"Obviously.\"\\n\\n \"Is the hook-handed guy the one who\u0027s been killing people?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. But he isn\u0027t alone. We\u0027ll discuss it later. Let\u0027s get you out of here and cleaned up first.\" Letting me lean on him, Steve led me back the way I\u0027d come, and as we walked I couldn\u0027t help wondering if I\u0027d been knocked unconscious in the alley. If not for the pain in my leg - which was all too real - I\u0027d have been seriously tempted to think this was nothing but a wishful dream.\\n\\n Steve took me to the fifth floor of a run-down apartment block. Many of the doors we passed along the landing were boarded-over or broken down. \"Nice neighbourhood,\" I commented sarcastically.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a condemned building,\" he said. \"A few apartments are occupied - mostly by old folk with nowhere else to go - but the majority are empty. I prefer places like this to boarding houses and hotels. The space and quiet suit my purposes.\"\\n\\n Steve stopped at a battered brown door kept shut by an extra thick padlock and chain. Rooting through his pockets, he found a key, unlocked the padlock, removed the chain and pushed the door open. The air inside was stale, but he took no notice as he bundled me inside and closed the door. The darkness within held until he lit a candle. \"No electricity,\" he said. \"The lower apartments are still connected, but it went off up here last week.\"\\n\\n He helped me into a cluttered living room and laid me down on a couch that had seen better days - it was threadbare, and wiry springs stuck out through several holes. \"Try not to impale yourself,\" Steve laughed.\\n\\n \"Is your interior decorator on strike?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t complain,\" Steve scolded me. \"It\u0027s a good base to work from. If we had to report back to some swanky hotel, we\u0027d have to explain your leg and why we\u0027re covered in filth. As for accounting for these ...\" He shrugged off the pair of arrow guns and laid them down.\\n\\n \"Care to tell me what\u0027s going on, Steve?\" I asked quietly. \"How you were in that alley and why you\u0027re carrying those?\"\\n\\n \"Later,\" he said, \"after we\u0027ve tended to your wounds. And after you\u0027ve-\" he produced a mobile phone and tossed it to me \"-made a call.\"\\n\\n \"Who am I supposed to ring?\" I asked, staring at the phone suspiciously.\\n\\n \"Hooky followed you from your friend\u0027s house - the dark-skinned lady.\"\\n\\n My face whitened. \"He knows where Debbie lives?\" I gasped.\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s her name - yes. I doubt he\u0027ll go after her, but if you don\u0027t want to run the risk, my advice is to call and tell her to-\"\\n\\n I was hitting buttons before he finished. Debbie\u0027s phone rang four times. Five. Six. Seven. I was about to dash to her rescue, regardless of my bad leg, when she picked up and said, \"Hello?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s me.\"\\n\\n \"Darren? What are-\"\\n\\n \"Debbie - do you trust me?\"\\n\\n There was a startled pause. \"Is this a joke?\"\\n\\n \"Do you trust me?\" I growled.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" she answered, sensing my seriousness.\\n\\n \"Then get out now. Throw some gear into a bag and scram. Find a hotel for the weekend. Stay there.\"\\n\\n \"Darren, what\u0027s going on? Have you lost your-\"\\n\\n \"Do you want to die?\" I interrupted.\\n\\n A silent beat. Then, quietly, \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then get out.\" I hit the disconnect button and prayed she\u0027d heed my warning. \"Does the vampaneze know where I\u0027m staying?\" I asked, thinking of Harkat.\\n\\n \"I doubt it,\" Steve said. \"If he did, he\u0027d have attacked you there. From what I saw, he stumbled upon you earlier tonight by chance. He was casing a crowd, selecting his next victim, when he saw you and picked up your trail. He followed you to your friend\u0027s house, waited, trailed after you when you left, and...\"\\n\\n I knew the rest.\\n\\n Steve fetched a first-aid kit from a shelf behind the couch. He told me to lean forward, then examined the back of my head. \"Is it cut?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Yes, but not badly. It doesn\u0027t need stitches. I\u0027ll clean it up and apply a dressing.\" With my head seen to, he focused on my leg. It was deeply gashed and the material of my trousers was soaked through with blood. Steve snipped it away with a sharp pair of scissors, exposing the flesh beneath, then swabbed at the wound with cotton wool. When it was clean, he studied it momentarily, then left and came back with a reel of catgut and a needle. \"This\u0027ll hurt,\" he said.\\n\\n \"It won\u0027t be the first time I\u0027ve been stitched back together,\" I grinned. He went to work on the cut, and did a neat job on it. I\u0027d only have a small scar when it was fully healed. \"You\u0027ve done this before,\" I noted as he tucked the catgut away.\\n\\n \"I took first-aid classes,\" he said. \"Figured they\u0027d come in handy. Never guessed who my first patient would be.\" He asked if I wanted something to drink.\\n\\n \"Just some water.\"\\n\\n He pulled a bottle of mineral water out of a bag by the sink and filled a couple of glasses. \"Sorry it\u0027s not cold. The fridge won\u0027t work without electricity.\"\\n\\n \"No problem,\" I said, taking a long drink. Then I nodded at the sink. \"Has the water been cut off too?\"\\n\\n \"No, but you wouldn\u0027t want to drink any - fine for washing, but you\u0027d be on a toilet for days if you swallowed.\"\\n\\n We smiled at each other over the rims of our glasses.\\n\\n \"So,\" I said, \"mind telling me what you\u0027ve been up to these last fifteen years?\"\\n\\n \"You first,\" Steve said.\\n\\n \"Nuh-uh. You\u0027re the host. It\u0027s your place to start.\"\\n\\n \"Toss you for it?\" he suggested.\\n\\n \"OK.\"\\n\\n He produced a coin and told me to call. \"Heads.\"\\n\\n He flipped the coin, caught it and slapped it over. When he took his hand away he grimaced. \"I never did have much luck,\" he sighed, then started to talk. It was a long story, and we were down to the bottom of the bottle of water and on to a second candle before he finished.\\n\\n Steve hated Mr. Crepsley and me for a long, long time. He\u0027d sit up late into the night, plotting his future, dreaming of the day he\u0027d track us down and stake us through the heart. \"I was crazy with rage,\" he muttered. \"I couldn\u0027t think about anything else. In woodwork classes I made stakes. In geography I committed the maps of the world to memory, so I\u0027d know my way around whichever country I traced you to.\"\\n\\n He found out everything there was to know about vampires. He\u0027d had a large collection of horror books when I knew him, but he\u0027d doubled, then trebled that in the space of a year. He learnt what climates we favoured, where we preferred to make our homes, how best to kill us. \"I got in contact with people on the Internet,\" he said. \"You\u0027d be surprised how many vampire hunters there are. We exchanged notes, stories, opinions. Most were crackpots, but a few knew what they were talking about.\"\\n\\n When he turned sixteen he left school and home, and went out into the world. He supported himself through a series of odd jobs, working in hotels, restaurants and factories. Sometimes he stole, or broke into empty houses and squatted. They were rough, lean, lonely years. He had very few scruples, hardly any friends, and no real interests except learning how to become a killer of vampires.\\n\\n \"To begin with, I thought I\u0027d pretend to befriend them,\" he explained. \"I went in search of vampires, acting as if I wanted to become one. Most of what I\u0027d read in books or gleaned through the Internet was rubbish. I decided the best way to rid myself of my enemies was to get to know them.\"\\n\\n Of course, when he eventually tracked a few vampires down and worked himself into their good books, he realized we weren\u0027t monsters. He discovered our respect for life, that we didn\u0027t kill humans when we drank and that we were people of honour. \"It made me take a long, hard look at myself,\" he sighed, his face dark and sad by the light of the candle. \"I saw that I was the monster, like Captain Ahab in Moby Dick, chasing a pair of killer whales - except these whales weren\u0027t killers!\"\\n\\n Gradually his hatred subsided. He still resented me for going off with Mr. Crepsley, but accepted the fact that I hadn\u0027t done it to spite him. When he looked back at the past, he saw that I\u0027d given up my family and home to save his life, and hadn\u0027t tricked or plotted against him.\\n\\n That\u0027s when he dropped his crazy quest. He stopped searching for us, put all thoughts of revenge from his mind, and sat down to work out what he was going to do with the rest of his life. \"I could have gone back,\" he said. \"My mother\u0027s still alive. I could have returned home, finished my education, found a normal job, carved out an ordinary life for myself. But the night has a way of claiming those who embrace it. I\u0027d found out the truth about vampires - but also about vampaneze.\"\\n\\n Steve couldn\u0027t stop thinking about the vampaneze. He thought it was incredible that creatures like that could exist, roaming and killing as they pleased. It angered him. He wanted to put a stop to their murderous ways. \"But I couldn\u0027t go to the police,\" he smiled ruefully. \"I\u0027d have had to capture a live vampaneze to prove they existed, but taking a vampaneze alive is almost impossible, as I\u0027m sure you know. Even if they believed me, what could they have done? Vampaneze move in, kill, then move on. By the time I\u0027d convinced the police of the danger they were in, the vampaneze would have vanished, and the danger with him. There was only one thing for it - I had to take them on myself!\"\\n\\n Applying the knowledge he\u0027d gathered when studying to be a vampire hunter, Steve set himself the task of tracking down and killing as many vampaneze as he could. It wasn\u0027t easy - vampaneze hide their tracks (and the bodies of their victims) expertly, leaving little evidence of their existence - but in time he found people who knew something of their ways, and he built up a picture of vampaneze habits, traits and routes, and eventually stumbled upon one.\\n\\n \"Killing him was the hardest thing I\u0027d ever done,\" Steve said grimly. \"I knew he was a killer, and would kill again if I let him go, but as I stood there, studying him while he slept...\" He shivered.\\n\\n \"How did you do it?\" I asked quietly. \"A stake?\"\\n\\n He nodded bitterly. \"Fool that I was - yes.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" I frowned. \"Isn\u0027t a stake the best way to kill a vampaneze, like with vampires?\"\\n\\n He stared coldly at me. \"Ever kill anybody with a stake?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t!\" he snorted. \"Driving it in is simple enough, but blood gushes up into your face, over your arms and chest, and the vampaneze doesn\u0027t die straightaway like vampires do in movies. The one I killed lived for the better part of a minute, thrashing and screaming. He crawled out of the coffin and came after me. He was slow, but I slipped on his blood, and before I knew what was happening, he was on top of me.\"\\n\\n \"What did you do?\" I gasped.\\n\\n \"I punched and kicked him and tried to knock him off. Fortunately he\u0027d lost too much blood and hadn\u0027t the strength to kill me. But he died on top of me, his blood drenching me, his face next to mine as he shuddered and sobbed and...\"\\n\\n Steve looked away. I didn\u0027t press him for further details.\\n\\n \"Since then I\u0027ve learnt to use those.\" He nodded at the arrow guns. \"They\u0027re the best there is. An axe is good too - if you have a good aim and the strength to chop a head clean off - but stay away from ordinary guns - they\u0027re not reliable where the extra tough bones and muscles of the vampaneze are concerned.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bear that in mind,\" I said, grinning sickly, then asked how many vampaneze Steve had killed.\\n\\n \"Six, though two of those were mad and would have died before long anyway.\"\\n\\n I was impressed. \"That\u0027s more than most vampires kill.\"\\n\\n \"Humans have an advantage over vampires,\" Steve said. \"We can move about and strike by day. In a fair contest, a vampaneze would wipe the floor with me. But if you catch them in the day, while they\u0027re sleeping...\\n\\n \"Although,\" he added, \"that\u0027s changing. The last few I\u0027ve tracked have been accompanied by humans. I wasn\u0027t able to get close enough to kill them. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve heard of vampaneze travelling with human assistants.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re called vampets,\" I told him.\\n\\n He frowned. \"How do you know? I thought the families of the night had nothing to do with one another.\"\\n\\n \"We hadn\u0027t until recently,\" I said grimly, then glanced at my watch. Steve\u0027s story wasn\u0027t complete - he still hadn\u0027t explained how he\u0027d wound up here - but it was time I made a move. It was getting late and I didn\u0027t want Harkat to worry. \"Will you come to my hotel with me? You can finish telling me about yourself there. Besides, there\u0027s someone I\u0027d like you to share your story with.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Crepsley?\" Steve guessed.\\n\\n \"No. He\u0027s away on... business. This is somebody else.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"It would take too long to explain. Will you come?\"\\n\\n He hesitated a moment, then said he would. But he stopped to grab his arrow guns before we left - I had a feeling Steve didn\u0027t even go to the toilet without his weapons! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allies-of-the-night-the-saga-of-darren-shan-8/page-11.html","bookId":2444,"book":{"id":2444,"title":"Allies of the Night (The Saga of Darren Shan #8)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #8: Allies of the Night \\n Allies of the Night is the eighth book of The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan.
