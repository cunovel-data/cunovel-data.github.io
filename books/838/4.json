{"id":18752,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV CAPTAIN WELLS OF FORT WAYNE","content":"W E tarried at the table a considerable time,—not because of any tempting variety in the repast, as the food furnished was of the coarsest, but for the sake of companionship, and because we discovered much of passing interest to converse about. De Croix had travelled widely, and had seen a great variety of life both in camp and court. He proved a vivacious fellow, full of amusing anecdote,—a bottle of rich wine drawn from his own private stock so stimulating his imagination that I had little to do but sit and listen. Yet he contrived to learn from me,—how, I hardly know, the simple story of my life, and, indeed, assumed a certain air of patronizing superiority, boasting unduly of his wider experience and achievements in a way that somewhat nettled me at last, as I began to comprehend that he was merely showing ? 34 ? off his genteel graces the better to exhibit his contempt for my provincial narrowness. I did not permit this really to anger me, for our views upon such matters were totally different, and I could not help feel admiration for the brilliant and audacious fellow. The black waited upon us while we ate and drank, moving noiselessly across the rough floor, so keenly observant of his master\u0027s slightest wish as to convince me the latter possessed a temper which upon occasion burst its bounds. Yet now he was surely in the best of humors; and with the coming of our second bottle, after the remains of the repast had been removed, he sang several love-songs in his native tongue, the meaning of which I could only guess at. \"Saint Guise!\" he exclaimed at last, flinging one booted foot over the table corner. \"You are a very sphinx of a fellow. You deny being English, yet you have all the silence of that nation. I am hungry, Monsieur, for the sweet sound of the French tongue.\" \"\u0027Tis a language of which I know little,\" I answered, striving to speak pleasantly, although his manner was becoming less and less to my liking. \"I have met with your coureurs de bois in plenty, and picked up sufficient of their common phrases to enable me to converse on ordinary themes with them; yet I confess I find it difficult to follow your speech.\" \"Canaille,\" he returned, in tone of undisguised ? 35 ? contempt, \"Canadian half-breeds, the very offscourings of our people. Sacre! but you should know us at home, Monsieur,—we are the conquerors of the world!\" I wish I could picture to you how he said this. Simple as it now reads, he made it vital with meaning. The insolent boast was uttered with such a swagger that my face instantly flushed, and he noted it. \"Is it not true, Monsieur?\" he asked quickly, his own blood heated by the wine. \"I tell you, the whole of Europe has trembled, and will again, at the nod of our Napoleon. Why, even over here we had to come with our legions to help you repel the red-coats. Saint Guise! but it was the Frenchmen who made you a nation.\" \"Ay! but only that they might revenge themselves upon England,\" I retorted blindly, \"and the force sent merely hurried a result already inevitable; yet we gave you a slight touch of our own quality in \u002798 that stung a bit, I warrant.\" \"Bah! a ship or two. \u0027Twas well for you that our army was so closely engaged elsewhere, or the story would have a different ending.\" We were both of us upon our feet by this time, glaring at each other across the board, our faces hot with the ill-restrained passion of youth. A word more from either would surely have precipitated matters; but before it could be spoken the door leading into the ? 36 ? hallway was hurriedly flung aside, and, without apology for the intrusion, two men strode forward into the glare of light. \"Serve supper here, Hawkins,\" commanded the first, his back still turned toward us. \"Anything you may chance to have in the house,—only let there be little delay.\" He was a tall, dark-featured man, smoothly shaven, as swarthy as an Indian, with stern dark eyes, thick coarse hair, and an abrupt manner born of long command. His companion, of lighter build and younger face, was attired in a travel-stained uniform of blue and buff; but he who was evidently the leader was so completely wrapped within the folds of a riding-cloak as to reveal nothing of rank other than his unmistakable military presence and bearing. Turning from the door, he swept a penetrating glance over us, loosening the clasp of his cloak as he did so. \"I regret having thoughtlessly interrupted your quarrel, gentlemen,\" he said brusquely, \"but this appears to be the sole excuse for a public-room in the place. However, my services are at your command if they be desired in any way.\" De Croix laughed, perfectly at his ease in a moment. \"\u0027Tis scarce so serious,\" he explained lightly. \"A mere interchange of compliments over the respective merits of our nations in war.\" ? 37 ? The stranger looked at him intently, and with some manifest disapproval. \"And yours, no doubt, was France,\" he said shortly. De Croix bowed, his hand upon his heart. \"I have worn her uniform, Monsieur.\" \"I thought as much, and fear my sympathies may be altogether with your antagonist in the controversy. Yet what\u0027s the use of wasting life like that? Surely there is fighting enough in this world of ours for such young blades, without inventing cause for quarrel. Come, sit down once more, and join with us in whatsoever cheer our landlord may provide.\" As he spoke, he flung aside his cloak, revealing beneath merely the well-worn dress of a frontiersman, with an army sword-belt buckled about the waist. \"Come, Walter,\" he called to his companion, who remained standing, \"there is to be no touch of ceremony here to-night. Gentlemen, I am Captain Wells, formerly of the army, now Indian agent at Fort Wayne; and this is Sergeant Jordan.\" The Frenchman bowed gracefully, and extended a card across the table. The other glanced at it carelessly. \"Ah! De Croix; pleased to meet you. Think I heard some of our officers speak of seeing you a month ago at Detroit,—McBain or Ramsey, I have forgotten which.\" ? 38 ? \"I recall a game of cards with a Lieutenant Ramsey, a rather choleric Scotchman, with a magnificent capacity for strong whiskey.\" The Captain turned inquiringly toward me, and I hastened to name myself. \"Wayland, did you say?\" he asked, with deepened interest. \"\u0027Tis not a common appellation, yet I once knew a Major by that name in Wayne\u0027s command.\" \"My father, sir,\" I asserted proudly. With quick impulsiveness he extended his hand. \"As noble a soldier as I have ever known,\" he exclaimed heartily. \"I served with him in two campaigns. But what are you two young fellows doing here? for it would be hard to conceive of a more disheartening place of residence. Surely, De Croix, you are not permanently located in this delightful spot?\" \"The saints forbid!\" ejaculated the other, with an expression of horror that caused the younger officer to smile. \"Yet I have already survived ten days of it. We seek to join some party bound westward, either to Fort Dearborn or beyond.\" The elder officer smiled gravely, as his stern eyes wandered thoughtfully over our faces in the candle-light. \"You will scarcely find those who go beyond,\" he said, at last, slowly. \"That is our extreme frontier; ? 39 ? and even this post, I hear it rumored, is to be abandoned shortly. Indeed, I am now proceeding thither, hoping to escort a niece safely eastward because of that very probability. I can offer you naught save companionship and guidance upon the journey; yet if you needs must go, you may ride with us and welcome. But \u0027tis my first duty to advise you strongly against it.\" \"You look for trouble?\" I asked, for his words and manner were grave. \"I am not one easily alarmed,\" he answered, scanning our faces as we fronted him; \"but I have lived long among the Indians, and know them well. This new war with England will not pass without atrocities along the border, and in my judgment we are now on the eve of a general uprising of the savages. It will surely come with the first news of British success, and \u0027tis the fear of reverses at Dearborn that has hurried me westward. You, sir,\" and he turned toward me, \"are young, but it is evident you have been bred to the frontier, so you will realize what it may mean to us if we be caught in the Illinois country by such an uprising.\" I bowed, deeply impressed by his earnestness. \"I have, indeed, seen something of savage warfare, and know much of its horror,\" I replied stoutly. \"Yet what you say of the possible future only makes more urgent my duty to press on.\" ? 40 ? \"And you?\" he asked De Croix. \"Faith, Captain,\" was the instant reply, \"it is the gentle hand of love which leads me westward, and never yet did a true Frenchman hesitate in such a quest because danger lurked between.\" Wells smiled grimly. \"Then my conscience is left clear,\" he exclaimed heartily; \"and if you ride with me to death, \u0027tis of your own choosing. However, glad enough we have cause to be thus to gain two more fighting men. I have a party of Miamis travelling with me, and I doubt not there will be ample work for all before we return. Here comes supper; let us eat, drink, and be merry, even though to-morrow it be our fate to die. \u0027Tis the best border philosophy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87346.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
