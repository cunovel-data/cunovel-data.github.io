{"id":18749,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I A MESSAGE FROM THE WEST","content":"S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday. I had left the scythe lying at the edge of the long grass, and gone up through the rows of nodding Indian corn to the house, seeking a draught of cool water from the spring. It was hot in the July sunshine; the thick forest on every side intercepted the breeze, and I had been at work for some hours. How pleasant and inviting the little river looked in the shade of the great trees, while, as I paused a moment bending over the high bank, I could see a lazy pike nosing about among the twisted roots below. ? 2 ? My mother, her sleeves rolled high over her round white arms, was in the dark interior of the milk-house as I passed, and spoke to me laughingly; and I could perceive my father sitting in his great splint-bottomed chair just within the front doorway, and I marked how the slight current of air toyed with his long gray beard. The old Bible lay wide open upon his knee; yet his eyes were resting upon the dark green of the woods that skirted our clearing. I wondered, as I quaffed the cool sweet water at the spring, if he was dreaming again of those old days when he had been a man among men. How distinct in each detail the memory of it remains! The blue sky held but one fleecy white cloud in all its wide arch; it seemed as if the curling film of smoke rising from our chimney had but gathered there and hung suspended to render the azure more pronounced. A robin peeked impudently at me from an oak limb, and a roguish gray squirrel chattered along the low ridge-pole, with seeming willingness to make friends, until Rover, suddenly spying me, sprang hastily around the corner of the house to lick my hand, with glad barkings and a frantic effort to wave the stub of his poor old tail. It was such a homely, quiet scene, there in the heart of the backwoods, one I had known unchanged so long, that I little dreamed it was soon to witness the turning over of a page of destiny in my life, that almost from that hour I was to sever every relation of the past, ? 3 ? and be sent forth to buffet with the rough world alone. There were no roads, in those days, along that valley of the upper Maumee,—merely faint bridle-paths, following ancient Indian trails through dense woods or across narrow strips of prairie-land; yet as I hung the gourd back on its wooden peg, and lifted my eyes carelessly to the northward, I saw a horseman riding slowly toward the house along the river bank. There were flying rumors of coming Indian outbreaks along the fringe of border settlements; but my young eyes were keen, and after the first quick thrill of suspicion I knew the approaching stranger to be of white blood, although his apparel was scarcely less uncivilized than that of the savage. Yet so unusual were visitors, that I grasped a gun from its pegs in the kitchen, and called warningly to my mother as I passed on to meet the new-comer. He was a very large and powerful man, with a matted black beard and an extremely prominent nose. A long rifle was slung at his back, and the heavy bay horse he bestrode bore unmistakable signs of hard travelling. As he approached, Rover, spying him, sprang out savagely; but I caught and held him with firm grip, for to strangers he was ever a surly brute. \"Is this yere Major Wayland\u0027s place?\" the man questioned, in a deep, gruff voice, reining in his tired ? 4 ? horse, and carelessly flinging one booted foot across the animal\u0027s neck as he faced me. \"Yes,\" I responded with caution, for we were somewhat suspicious of stray travellers in those days, and the man\u0027s features were not pleasing. \"The Major lives here, and I am his son.\" He looked at me intently, some curiosity apparent in his eyes, as he deliberately drew a folded paper from his belt. \"No? Be ye the lad what downed Bud Eberly at the meetin\u0027 over on the Cow-skin las\u0027 spring?\" he questioned, with faintly aroused interest. I blushed like a school-girl, for this unexpected reference was not wholly to my liking, though the man\u0027s intentions were evidently most kind. \"He bullied me until I could take no more,\" I answered, doubtfully; \"yet I hurt him more seriously than I meant.\" He laughed at the trace of apology in my words. \"Lord!\" he ejaculated, \"don\u0027t ever let that worry ye, boy. The hull settlement is mighty glad \u0027twas done. Old Hawkins bin on the p\u0027int o\u0027 doin\u0027 it himself a dozen o\u0027 times. Told me so. Ye\u0027re quite a lad, ain\u0027t ye? Weigh all o\u0027 hundred an\u0027 seventy, I\u0027ll bet; an\u0027 strong as an ox. How old be ye, anyhow?\" \"Twenty,\" I answered, not a little mollified by his manner. \"You must live near here, then?\" \"Wal, no, but been sorter neighbor o\u0027 yourn fer ? 5 ? a month er so back; stoppin\u0027 up at Hawkins\u0027s shebang, at the ford, on the Military Road, visitin\u0027; but guess I never met up with none o\u0027 your folks afore. My name\u0027s Burns, Ol\u0027 Tom Burns, late o\u0027 Connecticut. A sojer from out West left this yere letter fer yer father at Hawkins\u0027s place more nor a week ago. Said as how it was mighty important; but blamed if this wasn\u0027t the fust chance he\u0027s hed to git it over yere sence. I told him I\u0027d fetch it, as it wasn\u0027t more nor a dozen miles er so outer my way.\" He held out a square paper packet; and while I turned it over curiously in my hand,—the first letter I had ever seen,—he took some loose tobacco from an outside pocket and proceeded leisurely to fill his pipe. My mother rolled my father\u0027s chair forward into the open doorway, and stood close behind him, as was her custom, one arm resting lightly upon the quaintly carved chair-back. \"What is it, John?\" she questioned gently. Instantly aroused by her voice, I crossed quickly over and placed the packet in my father\u0027s thin hands. He turned it over twice before he opened it, looking at the odd seal, and reading the superscription carefully aloud, as if fearful there might be some mistake: \"Major David Wayland, Along the Upper Maumee. Leave at Hawkins Ford \"Important.on Military Road.\" ? 6 ? I can see him yet as he read it, slowly feeling his way through the rude, uneven writing, with my mother leaning over his shoulder and helping him, her rosy cheeks and dark tresses making strange contrast beside his pain-racked features and iron-gray hair. \"Read it aloud, Mary,\" he said at last. \"I shall understand it better. \u0027Tis from Roger Matherson, of whom you have heard me speak.\" My mother was a good scholar, and she read clearly, only hesitating now and then over some ill-written or misspelled word. At Fort Dearborn, near the head of the Great Lake. Twelfth June, 1812. My Dear Old Friend: I have come to the end of life; they tell me it will be all over by the morrow, and there remains but one thing that greatly troubles me—my little girl, my Elsa. You know I have never much feared death, nor do I in this hour when I face it once more; for I have ever tried to honor God and do my duty as both man and soldier. David, I can scarcely write, for my mind wanders strangely, and my fingers will but barely grasp the pen. \u0027Tis not the grip of the old sword-hand you knew so well, for I am already very weak, and dying. But do you yet remember the day I drew you out of the rout at Saratoga, and bore you away safely, though the Hessians shot me twice? God knows, old friend, I never thought to remind you of the act,—\u0027twas no more than any comrade would have done,—yet I am here among strangers, and there is no one else living to whom I may turn in my need. David, in memory of it, will you not give my little orphan child a home? Your old comrade, upon his death-bed, begs this of you with his final breath. She is all alone here, save for me, and there is no blood kin in all the world ? 7 ? to whom I may appeal. I shall leave some property, but not much. As you love your own, I pray you be merciful in this hour to my little girl. Your old comrade, Roger Matherson. This had been endorsed by another and bolder hand: Captain Roger Matherson, late of the Massachusetts Continental Line, died at this fort, of fever, fourteenth June, 1812. His daughter is being cared for by the ladies of the garrison. Nathan Heald, Capt. First Regt. Inf., Commanding. The tears were clinging to my mother\u0027s long lashes as she finished the reading; she was ever tender of heart and sympathetic with sorrow. My father sat in silence, looking far off at the green woods. Presently he took the paper again into his hands, folded it carefully in the old creases, and placed it safely away between the Bible leaves. I saw my mother\u0027s fingers steal along the arm of the chair until they closed softly over his. \"The poor little lamb!\" she said gently. My father\u0027s old sword hung over the fireplace, and I saw his glance wander toward it, as something seemed to rise choking in his throat. He was always a man who felt deeply, yet said but little; and we both knew he was thinking about the old days and the strong ties of comradeship. The stranger struck flint and steel to light his ? 8 ? pipe; the act instantly recalled my father to the demands of hospitality. \"Friend,\" he said, speaking firmly, \"hitch to the stump yonder, and come in. You have brought me sad news enough, yet are no less welcome, and must break bread at our board. John,\" and he turned toward me, \"see to friend Burns\u0027s horse, and help your mother to prepare the dinner.\" Out in the rude shed, which answered as a kitchen during summer weather, I ventured to ask: \"Mother, do you suppose he will take the little girl?\" \"I hope so, John,\" she answered, soberly; \"but your father must decide himself. He will not tell us until he has thought it all out alone.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87343.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
