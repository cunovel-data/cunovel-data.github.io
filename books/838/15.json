{"id":18763,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV AN ADVENTURE UNDERGROUND","content":"A HEAVILY-BUILT man in shirt-sleeves, with a strong, good-humored face, and a shock of gray hair, appeared beside the girl in the doorway. \"\u0027Tis not the same scamp I that kissed you, Josette,\" he exclaimed, after examining me intently in the dim light, \"but I doubt not he may prove of similar breed, and it behooves you to be careful where you stand.\" \"Has De Croix been here?\" I questioned, scarcely deeming it possible he could have outstripped me in our race through the night. \"I know not the rascal\u0027s name,\" was the reply, in the man\u0027s deep voice, \"but certain I am there was one here scarce ten minutes agone asking after this same Matherson girl. Saint James! but she must have made some sweet acquaintances, judging from the looks of ? 151 ? her callers! Josette has been rubbing the fellow\u0027s kiss off her lips ever since he caught her unawares.\" \"He was a dandified young fellow?\" I urged, impatient to be off, yet eager to be sure. The girl laughed lightly, her roguish eyes ablaze with merriment. \"He might be sometime, Monsieur,\" she cried, evidently glad to talk, \"but to-night he reminded me of those scare-crows the farmers near Quebec keep in their fields; a little chap, with a bit of turned-up mustache, and a bright eye, but rags,—gracious, such rags as he wore!\" \u0027Twas De Croix, there could be no doubt of it,—De Croix, torn and dishevelled by his mad rush through the darkness, but with no shred of his reckless audacity gone. There was naught left, me now but to race back upon his trail, hopeful for some chance that might yet allow me to come in first on the return journey. In my throat I swore one thing,—the graceless villain should never collect his reward at both ends of his journey. He had already stolen the sweets from Josette\u0027s red lips, but he should never claim those of Mademoiselle. I lingered for but a single question more. \"But this Elsa Matherson,—she is not here, then?\" \"No,\" returned Mr. Kinzie, somewhat gruffly, \"and has not been since the closing of the gates of the ? 152 ? Fort. I think you are a parcel of mad fools, to be chasing around on such an errand; yet humanity leads me to bid you come in. There is not a safe foot of ground to-night for any strange white man within three hundred miles of Dearborn.\" I glanced about me into the black shadows, startled at his solemn words of warning. Away to the southward a faint glimmer told of the location of the Fort; farther to the west, a sudden blaze swept up into the sky, reflected in ruddy radiance on the clouds, and the thought came to me that the savages had put torch to the deserted cabin on the south branch of the river. \"No doubt \u0027tis true,\" I answered hastily; \"yet, whatever the danger may be, I must regain the stockade before dawn.\" I saw him step forward, as if he would halt me in my purpose; but, wishing to be detained no longer, my thoughts being all with De Croix and Mademoiselle, I turned away quickly and plunged back into the darkness. \"You young fool!\" he called after me, \"come back, or your life will be the forfeit!\" Without so much as answering, I ran silently in my moccasins to the spot where I had left Ol\u0027 Tom Burns. He sat upon his stump, motionless, apparently without the slightest interest in anything going on about him. \"Ol\u0027 Kinzie was gol-dern polite ter ye, sonny,\" he ? 153 ? commented. \"Reckon if an Injun was a scalpin\u0027 me right on his front doorstep he\u0027d never hev asked me ter walk inside like that! He an\u0027 me sorter drew on each other \u0027bout a year ago, down at Lee\u0027s shebang; an\u0027 he don\u0027t \u0027pear ter fergit \u0027bout it.\" \"Show me the nearest safe passage to the Fort,\" I said, interrupting him, almost rudely. He got up slowly, and cast his eyes with deliberation southward. \"Oh, thar ain\u0027t no sich special hurry, I reckon,\" he answered with an exasperating drawl. \"We\u0027ll be thar long afore daylight,—perviding allers we don\u0027t hit no Injuns meantime,—an\u0027 the slower we travel the less chance thar is o\u0027 thet.\" \"But, friend Burns,\" I urged, \"it is a racing matter. I must reach there in advance of another man, who has already been here ahead of me.\" \"Sol sorter reckoned from what I heerd; but ye needn\u0027t rip the shirt off ye on thet account. The feller can\u0027t git in thar till after daylight, nohow. Them sojers is too blame skeered ter open the gates in the dark, an\u0027 all the critter\u0027ll git if he tries it will be a volley o\u0027 lead; so ye might just as well take it easylike.\" The old man\u0027s philosophy seemed sound. De Croix would certainly not gain admittance until he could make himself known to the guard, and, carefully as the stockade was now patrolled, it was hardly probable ? 154 ? he would be permitted to approach close enough for identification during the night. De Croix was no frontiersman, and was reckless to a degree; yet his long training as a soldier would certainly teach him a measure of caution in approaching a guarded fort at such a time. \"Tis doubtless true,\" I admitted, \"yet I shall feel safer if we push on at once.\" \"Ye called the feller De Croix, didn\u0027t ye?\" he asked. \"Is it the French dandy as was at Hawkins\u0027s?\" \"Yes,\" I answered, \"and I guess you don\u0027t care much to help him.\" Burns wasted no breath in reply, but moved forward with noiseless step. Glancing back, I could clearly perceive Kinzie framed in the light of his open door. The vivacious French lass stood beside him, peering curiously out across his broad shoulders. Then we sank into the blackness of the ravine, and everything was blotted from our sight. Burns evidently knew the intricacies of the path leading to the Fort gate, for I soon felt my feet upon a beaten track, and stumbled no more over the various obstacles that rendered my former progress so uncertain. My guide moved with excessive caution, as it seemed to me, frequently pausing to peer forward into the almost impenetrable darkness, and sniffing the night-air suspiciously as if hoping thus to locate any ? 155 ? lurking foes when his keen eyes failed in the attempt. So dark was it that I had almost to tread upon his heels in order to follow him, as not the slightest sound came from his stealthy advance. As he surmounted the steeper inclines of land, I was able to perceive him dimly, usually leaning well forward and moving with the utmost caution, his long rifle held ready for instant use. As we drew nearer the river,—or where I supposed the river must be, for I could distinguish but little of our position,—he swerved from the footpath we were following, and the way instantly grew rougher to our feet. \"Reckon we\u0027d better hit the crick a bit below the Fort,\" he muttered, over his shoulder; \"less likely ter find Injuns waitin\u0027 fer us thar.\" \"You think there are savages on this shore?\" He turned partially, and peered at me through the darkness. \"I never heerd tell as Injuns was fools,\" he answered briefly. \"In course thar\u0027s some yere, an\u0027 we\u0027re almighty likely ter find \u0027em.\" On the bank of the river, which I could see dimly by the faint light of a star or two that had broken through the cloud-rifts, he paused suddenly, sniffing the air like a pointer dog. \"The gol-dern fools!\" he muttered, striking his rifle-butt on the ground with an expression of disgust. \"They\u0027ve gone and done it now!\" ? 156 ? \"Done what?\" I questioned, almost guessing his meaning as a pungent odor assailed my nostrils. \"That smells like rum!\" \"\u0027Tis rum. Dern if ever I see whar the A\u0027mighty finds so many blame idjits ter make sojers of! Them ar\u0027 fellers in the Fort wern\u0027t in tight \u0027nough pickle, with a thousand savages howlin\u0027 \u0027bout \u0027em, so they\u0027ve went an\u0027 poured all their liquor inter the river! If I know Injun nature, it jist means the craziest lot o\u0027 redskins, whin they find it out, ever was on these yere plains. I bet they make thet fool garrison pay mighty big fer this job!\" \"You mean the destruction of the liquor will anger them?\" \"Anger? It\u0027ll drive \u0027em plum crazy,—they\u0027ll be ravin\u0027 maniacs! It\u0027s the hope o\u0027 spoils thet\u0027s held \u0027em back so long. They\u0027ve wanted the Fort to be \u0027vacuated, so as they could plunder it,—thet\u0027s been the song o\u0027 the chiefs to hold their young men from raisin\u0027 ha\u0027r. But come, sonny, thar\u0027s nothin\u0027 gained a-stayin\u0027 here, an\u0027 dern me if I want ter meet any Injun with thet thar smell in the air. I don\u0027t swim no river smellin\u0027 like thet one does. We\u0027ll hev ter go further up, I reckon, an\u0027 cross over by the ol\u0027 agency buildin\u0027.\" We crept up the edge of the stream, keeping well in under the north bank, and moving with the utmost caution, for the chances were strong that this portion ? 157 ? of the river would be closely watched by the redskins. We met with no obstacle, however, nor were we apparently even observed from the stockade, as we slowly passed its overhanging shadow. I could distinguish clearly its dark outlines, even making out a head or two moving above the palisades; but no hail of any kind rang out across the intervening water, and we were soon beyond the upper block-house, where a faint light yet shone. We could see the dim shape of the two-story factory building, looking gloomy and deserted on the south shore. Burns lay flat at the water\u0027s edge, studying the building intently; and his extreme caution made me a bit nervous, although I could scarcely determine why, for I had thus far marked not the slightest sign of danger. \"I reckon we\u0027ll hev ter risk it,\" he said at length, as he bound his powder-horn upon his head with a dark cloth. \"Come right \u0027long arter me, and don\u0027t make no splashin\u0027.\" He slipped off so silently that I scarcely knew he was gone, until I missed the dark outline of his figure at my side. With all possible caution, I followed him. The current was not strong, but I partially faced it, and struck out with a long, steady stroke, so that my progress, as nearly as I could judge, was almost directly across the stream. Burns had been completely lost to my sight, although as I looked along the slightly glistening water I could see for some distance ? 158 ? ahead. I remember a black log bearing silently down upon me, and how I shrank from contact with it, fearful lest it might conceal some human thing. Soon after it had swirled by, my feet touched the shelving bank, and I crept cautiously up into the overhanging shadow. Burns was there, and had already reconnoitred our position; for my first knowledge of his presence came when he slowly lowered himself down the bank until he lay close beside me. \"They\u0027re thar,\" he said, soberly. \"Thought most likely they wud be.\" \"Indians?\" I asked, doubtfully,—for I had an impression the factory might be garrisoned by some of our own people. \"Sure; I heerd as how the sojers hed been drawed in, an\u0027 naturally reckoned the Injuns wouldn\u0027t be over-long findin\u0027 it out. \u0027Nother fool thing fer the sojers ter dew.\" He paused, listening intently. In the silence, above the slight sound of the running water, I felt sure I could distinguish voices speaking not far distant. \"It\u0027s no place yere ter stay,\" he whispered, his lips close at my ear. \"Reckon best thing we kin dew now is to find one o\u0027 the sojers\u0027 root-caves somewhar along the bank, an\u0027 crawl in thar till daylight. The Injuns ain\u0027t so likely to bother us when the guards kin see \u0027em from the Fort. They don\u0027t want no out-\u0027n\u0027-out fuss, to my notion, till they kin git inter the stockade ? 159 ? for good. Creep \u0027long yere with me, sonny, an\u0027 \u0027t won\u0027t be far till I find a hole somewhar thet\u0027ll hide us fer awhile anyhow.\" We crawled slowly along, snake-fashion, at the edge of the river, for perhaps thirty feet, our movements hidden by the high and slightly overhanging bank at our left. The night was so dark that Burns relied more upon feeling than sight to guide him. At last he stopped suddenly. \"Here\u0027s one o\u0027 \u0027em,\" he said. \"Crawl along in, sonny; thar\u0027s lots o\u0027 room after ye go a foot er two.\" It was the merest hole dug into the bank, roughly lined with irregular bits of rock, which opened out into quite a cellar about a yard from the surface. The air within felt somewhat chill and damp, as I put my head cautiously down the narrow opening; but there seemed no cause for fear, and I crept nimbly forward, feeling my way as I advanced along the rude mud walls. I could hear Burns behind me on his hands and knees, puffing slightly as he squeezed through the small aperture that led into the larger chamber. I had advanced perhaps two yards without reaching the end of this odd underground apartment, when suddenly, and directly in my front, there sounded a deep, hollow, unearthly groan. The sound was so terrifying that I stopped with chilled blood and beating heart, gripping my knife-hilt and peering forward into the dark as frightened as ever I was in my life. ? 160 ? I heard Burns gasp and half turn; then, before I could move, even had I dared venture such a thing, an instantaneous flash lit up the black interior. I caught one confused glimpse of a huge object, topped with a head of tumbled hair, of two flapping wings stretching out upon either side, and then the impenetrable curtain of the dark hid everything once more. Sweat bathed me in cold drops; nor could I have moved a limb to save my life. Behind me Burns was muttering what might have been a prayer; when the thing groaned again, a hollow, awful moan, thrilling with agony, that sent me grovelling upon my face as nearly dead as one could well be and yet breathe and know.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87357.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
