{"id":18757,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX IN SIGHT OF THE FLAG","content":"I T would have been impossible not to respond to his sparkling humor and good nature, even had the girl been desirous of doing otherwise. From the first I felt that she liked this reckless courtier, whose easy words and actions made me realize more deeply than ever my own heaviness of thought and wit. As he stood there now, bowing low before her, his clothing awry and his long hair in disorder from our fierce contest, she smiled upon him graciously, and extended a hand that he was prompt enough to accept and hold. \"Surely,\" she said mockingly, \"no maid, even in the glorious days of chivalry, had ever more heroic figures to do battle for her honor. I accept the amende, Monsieur, and henceforth enroll you as knight at my court. Upon my word,\" and she looked about at the ? 87 ? desolate sand-heaps surrounding us, \"\u0027tis not much to boast of here; nor, in truth, is Dearborn greatly better.\" She paused, drawing her hand gently from his grasp, and holding it out toward me. \"Yet, Captain,\" she continued, glancing at him archly over her shoulder, \"I have likewise another knight, this wood ranger, who hath also won my deep regard and gratitude.\" De Croix scowled, and twisted his short mustache nervously. \"You put a thorn beside every rose,\" he muttered. \"\u0027Twas your way in Montreal.\" \"A few hundred miles of travel do not greatly change one\u0027s nature. Either at Dearborn or Montreal, I am still Toinette. But, Messieurs, I have been told of a camp quite close at hand,—and yet you leave me here in the sand to famish while you quarrel.\" The tone of her voice, while still full of coquetry, was urgent, and I think we both noted for the first time how white of face she was, and how wearily her eyes shone. The Frenchman, ever ready in such courtesies, was the first to respond by word and act. \"You are faint, Toinette,\" he cried, instantly forgetful of everything else, and springing forward to give her the aid of his arm. \"I beg you lean upon me. I have been blind not to note your weakness before. \u0027Tis indeed not a long walk to our camp from ? 88 ? here,—yet, on my life, I know nothing of where it lies. Jordan,\" he added, speaking as if he were in command, \"lead back along the path we came. Sacre! the old bear was gruff enough over the delay of our search; he will be savage now.\" I know not how Jordan ever found his way back, for the sliding sand had already obliterated all evidences of former travel; but I walked sullenly beside him, leaving De Croix to minister to the needs of the girl as best he might. I felt so dull beside his ready tongue that, in spite of my real liking for the fellow, his presence angered me. \u0027Tis strange we should ever envy in others what we do not ourselves possess, ignoring those traits of character we have which they no less desire. So to me then it seemed altogether useless to contend for the heart of a woman,—such a woman, at least, as this laughing Toinette,—against the practised wiles of so gay and debonair a cavalier. I steeled my ears to the light badinage they continued to indulge in, and ploughed on through the heavy sand at Jordan\u0027s heels, in no mood for converse with any one. We came upon the camp suddenly, and discovered Captain Wells pacing back and forth, his stern face dark with annoyance. At sight of me, his passion burst all restraint. \"By God, sir!\" he ejaculated, \"if you were a soldier of mine, I would teach you what it meant to ? 89 ? put us to such a wait as this! Know you not, Master Wayland, that the lives of helpless women and children may depend upon our haste? And you hold us here in idleness while you wander along the lake-shore like a moonstruck boy!\" Before I could answer these harsh words, the girl stepped lightly to my side, and standing there, her hand upon my arm, smiled back into his angry eyes. I do not think he had even perceived her presence until that moment; for he stopped perplexed. \"And am I not worth the saving, Monsieur le Capitaine,\" she questioned, pouting her lips, \"that you should blame him so harshly for having stopped to rescue me?\" His harsh glance of angry resentment softened as he gazed upon her. \"Ah! was that it, then?\" he asked, in gentler tones. \"But who are you? Surely you are not unattended in this wilderness?\" \"I am from Fort Dearborn,\" she answered, \"and though only a girl, Monsieur, I have penetrated to the great West even farther than has Captain Wells.\" \"How know you my name?\" \"Mrs. Heald told me she believed you would surely come when you learned of our plight at the Fort, it was for that she despatched the man Burns with the message,—and she described you so perfectly ? 90 ? that I knew at once who you must be. There are not so many white men travelling toward Dearborn now as to make mistake easy.\" \"And the Fort?\" he asked, anxiously. \"Is it still garrisoned, or have we come too late?\" \"It was safely held two days ago,\" she answered, \"although hundreds of savages in war-paint were then encamped without, and holding powwow before the gate. No attack had then been made, yet the officers talked among themselves of evacuating.\" For a moment the stern soldier seemed to have forgotten her, his eyes fastened upon the western horizon. \"The fools!\" he muttered to himself, seemingly unconscious that he spoke aloud; \"yet if I can but reach there in time, my knowledge of Indian nature may accomplish much.\" He turned quickly, with a sharp glance over his military force. \"We delay no longer. Jordan, do you give this lady your horse for to-day\u0027s journey, and go you forward on foot with the Miamis. Watch them closely, and mark well everything in your front as you move.\" \"But, Captain Wells,\" she insisted, as he turned away, \"I am exceedingly hungry, and doubt not this youth would also be much the better for a bit of food.\" \"It will have to be eaten as you travel, then,\" he ? 91 ? answered, not unkindly, but with all his thought now fixed on other things, \"for our duty is to reach Dearborn at the first moment, and save those prisoned there from death, and worse.\" I shall always remember each detail of that day\u0027s march, though I saw but little of Toinette save in stolen glances backward, Wells keeping me close at his side, while De Croix, as debonair as ever, was her constant shadow, ministering assiduously to her wants and cheering her journey with agreeable discourse. I heard much of their chatter, earnestly as I sought to remain deaf to it. To this end Wells aided me but little, for he rode forward in stern silence, completely absorbed in his own thoughts. During the first few hours we passed through a dull desolation of desert sand, the queerly shaped hills on either side scarcely breaking the dead monotony, although they often hid from our sight our advance scouts, and made us feel isolated and alone. Once or twice I imagined I heard the deepening roar of waves bursting upon the shore-line to our right, but could gain no glimpse of blue water through those obscuring dunes. We were following a well-worn Indian trail, beaten hard by many a moccasined foot; and at last it ran from out the coarser sand and skirted along the western beach, almost at the edge of the waves. \u0027Twas a most delightful change from the cramped and narrowed vision that had been ours so long. Our faces ? 92 ? were now set almost directly northward; but I could not withdraw my eyes from the noble expanse of water heaving and tumbling in the dazzling sunlight. Indeed, there was little else about our course to attract attention; the shore in front lay clear and unbroken, bearing a sameness of outline that wearied the vision; each breaking wave was but the type of others that had gone before, and each jutting point of land was the picture of the next to follow. To our left, there extended, parallel to our course of march, a narrow ridge of white and firmly beaten sand, as regular in appearance as the ramparts of a fort. Here and there a break occurred where in some spring flood a sudden rush of water had burst through. Glancing curiously down these narrow aisles, as we rode steadily onward, I caught fleeting glimpses of level prairie-land, green with waving grasses, apparently stretching to the western horizon bare of tree or shrub. At first, I took this to be water also; until I realized that I looked out upon the great plains of the Illinois. The Captain was always chary of speech; now he rode onward with so stern a face, that presently I spoke in inquiry. \"You are silent, Captain Wells,\" I said. \"One would expect some rejoicing, as we draw so close to the end of our long journey.\" He glanced aside at me. \"Wayland,\" he said slowly, \"I have been upon ? 93 ? the frontier all my life, and have, as you know, lived in Indian camps and shared in many a savage campaign. I am too old a man, too tried a soldier, ever to hesitate to acknowledge fear; but I tell you now, I believe we are riding northward to our deaths.\" I had known, since first leaving the Maumee, that danger haunted the expedition; yet these solemn words came as a surprise. \"Why think you thus?\" I asked, with newly aroused anxiety, my thoughts more with the girl behind than with myself. \"Mademoiselle Toinette tells me the Fort is strong and capable of defence, and surely we are already nearly there.\" \"The young girl yonder with De Croix? It may be so, if it also be well provisioned for a long siege, as it is scarce likely any rescue party will be despatched so far westward. If I mistake not, Hull will have no men to spare. Yet I like not the action of the savages about us. \u0027Tis not in Indian nature to hold off, as these are doing, and permit reinforcements to go by, when they might be halted so easily. \u0027Twould ease my mind not a little were we attacked.\" \"Attacked? by whom?\" He faced me with undisguised surprise, a sarcastic smile curling his grim mouth. His hand swept along the western sky-line. \"By those red spies hiding behind that ridge of sand,\" he answered shortly. \"Boy, where are your ? 94 ? eyes not to have seen that every step we have taken this day has been but by sufferance of the Pottawattomies? Not for an hour since leaving camp have we marched out of shot from their guns; it means treachery, yet I can scarce tell where or how. If they have spared us this long, there is some good Indian reason for it.\" I glanced along that apparently desolate sand-bank, barely a hundred feet away, feeling a thrill of uneasiness sweep over me at the revelation of his words. My eyes saw nothing strange nor suspicious; but I could not doubt his well-trained instinct. \"It makes my flesh creep,\" I admitted; \"yet surely the others do not know. Hear how the Frenchman chatters in our rear!\" \"The young fool!\" he muttered, as the sound of a light laugh reached us; \"it will prove no jest, ere we are out of this again. Yet, Wayland,\" and his voice grew stronger, \"the red devils must indeed mean to pass us free,—for there is Fort Dearborn, and, unless my sight deceive me, the flag is up.\" I lifted my eyes eagerly, and gazed northward where his finger pointed. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87351.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
