{"id":18751,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III A NEW ACQUAINTANCE","content":"I DREW rein upon the upper river bank, before we finally plunged into the dark woods beyond, and glanced back. I had to brush the gathering tears from my eyes before I could see clearly; and when I finally rode away, the picture of that dear old home was fixed in my memory forever. Our house stood near the centre of an oak opening,—a little patch of native prairie-land, with a narrow stream skirting it on one side, and a dense fringe of forest all about. The small story-and-a-half cabin of hewn logs, with its lean-to of rough hand-riven planks, fronted to the southward; and the northern expanse of roof was green with moss. My father sat in the open doorway, his uplifted hand shading his eyes as he gazed after us; while my mother stood by his side, one arm resting upon the back of his chair, the other extended, waving a white cloth in ? 20 ? farewell. Rover was without, where I had bidden him remain, eagerly watching for some signal of relenting upon my part. Beyond stood the rude out-buildings, silhouetted against the deep green. It was a homely, simple scene,—yet till now it had been all the world to me. With a final wave of the hand, I moved forward, until the intervening trees, like the falling of a curtain, hid it all from view. Seth was astride the old mare, riding bareback, his white goat-like beard hanging down his breast until it mingled with her mane, while his long thin legs were drawn up in the awkward way he had. He was a strange, silent, gloomy man, as austere as his native hills; and we rode on with no exchange of speech. Indeed, my thoughts were of a nature that I had no wish to share with another; so it was some time before the depth of loneliness which oppressed my spirits enabled me to feel even passing interest in the things at hand. \"I\u0027d hate like thunder ter be a-goin\u0027 on your trip, Maester John,\" volunteered Seth at last, solemnly turning on the mare\u0027s broad back to face me. \"And why?\" I asked, wonderingly; for the man\u0027s rare gift of silence had won him a certain reputation for deep, occult knowledge which I could not wholly ignore. \"It will bring me the sight of some wonderful country, no doubt.\" His shrewd gimlet eyes seemed fairly to pierce ? 21 ? me, as he deliberately helped himself to tobacco from a pouch at his waist. \"Wal, that may all be, Maester John; but I\u0027ve heerd tell ther is some most awful things goes on out yonder,\" and he swung his long arm meaningly toward the west. \"Animyles sich as don\u0027t prowl raound yere, man-yeatin\u0027 snakes as big as thet tree, an\u0027 the blood-thirstiest salvages as ever was. An\u0027 arter a while ther ain\u0027t no more trees grows, ther Ian\u0027 is thet poor, by gosh! jist a plumb dead levil er\u0027 short grass, an\u0027 no show ter hide ner nuthin\u0027.\" \"Were you ever there, Seth?\" I questioned with growing anxiety, for I had heard some such vague rumors as these before. \"Me? Not by a dinged sight!\" he replied, emphatically. \"This yere is a long way further west thin I keer \u0027bout bein\u0027. Ol\u0027 Vermont is plenty good \u0027nough fer this chicken, an\u0027 many\u0027s ther day I wish I was back ther. But I hed a cousin onct who tuk ter sojerin\u0027 \u0027long with Gineral Clarke, an\u0027 went \u0027cross them ther prairies ter git Vincennes frum the British. Lor\u0027! it must a\u0027 bin more ner thirty year ago! He tol\u0027 me thet they jist hed ter wade up ter ther neck in water fer days an\u0027 days. I ain\u0027t so durn fond o\u0027 water as all thet. An\u0027 he said as how rattlesnakes was everywhere; an\u0027 ther Injuns was mos\u0027 twice es big es they be yere.\" \"But Clarke, and nearly all of his men, got back safely,\" I protested. ? 22 ? \"Oh, I guess some on \u0027em got back, \u0027cause they was an awful lot in thet army, mighty nigh two thousand on \u0027em, Ephriam said; but, I tell ye, they hed a most terrible tough time afore they did git hum. I seed my cousin whin he kim back, an\u0027 he was jist a mere shadder; though he was bigger ner you whin he went \u0027way.\" \"But Fort Dearborn is much farther to the north. Perhaps it will be better up there.\" \"Wuss,\" he insisted, with a most mournful shake of the head, \"a dinged sight wuss. Ephriam said es how the further north ye wint, the tougher it got. He saw an Injun from up near the big lake—a Pottamottamie, or somethin\u0027 like thet—what was nine fut high, an\u0027 he told him es how the rivers in his kintry was all full o\u0027 man-eatin\u0027 critters like snakes, an\u0027 some on \u0027em hed a hundred legs ter crawl with, an\u0027 cud travel a dinged sight faster ner a hoss. By gosh! but you bet I don\u0027t want none on it. Your father must \u0027a\u0027 been plum crazy fer ter sind ye way out ther all \u0027lone,—jist a green boy like you. What ye a-goin\u0027 fer, enyhow?\" I explained to him the occasion and necessity for my trip, but he shook his head dubiously, his long face so exceedingly mournful that I could not remain unaffected by it. \"Wal,\" he said at length, carefully weighing his words, \"maybe it\u0027s all right \u0027nough, but I\u0027ve got my ? 23 ? doubts jist the same. I\u0027ll bet thet ther gal is jist one o\u0027 them will-o\u0027-the-wisps we hear on, an\u0027 you never will find her. You\u0027ll jist wander \u0027round, huntin\u0027 an\u0027 huntin\u0027 her, till ye git old, or them monsters git ye. An\u0027 I\u0027ll be blamed if ever I heerd tell o\u0027 no sich fort as thet, nohow.\" Seth was certainly proving a Job\u0027s comforter; and I was already sufficiently troubled about the final outcome of my adventure. Hence my only hope of retaining any measure of courage was to discountenance further conversation, and we continued to jog along in silence, although I caught him looking at me several times in a manner that expressed volumes. We camped that night in the dense heart of some oak woods, beside a pleasant stream of clear, cool water. Late the following evening, just as the sun was disappearing behind the trees, our wearied horses emerged suddenly upon the bank of a broad river, and we could discern the dim outlines of Hawkins\u0027s buildings amid the deepening shadows of the opposite shore. Upon one thing I was now fully determined. Seth should start back with the first streak of the next dawn. His long face and dismal croakings kept me constantly upon nettles, and I felt that I should face the uncertain future with far stouter heart if he were out of my sight. Firm in this resolve, I urged my horse to splash his reluctant way through the shallows of the ford; and as our animals rose on the steep bank ? 24 ? of the western shore, we found ourselves at once in the midst of a group of scattered buildings. It seemed quite a settlement in that dim light, although the structures were all low and built of logs. The largest and most centrally located of these was evidently the homestead, as it had a rudely constructed porch in front, and a thin cloud of smoke was drifting from its chimney. As I drew nearer, I could perceive the reflection of a light streaming out through the open doorway. No one appeared in answer to our shouting,—not even a stray dog; and, in despair of thus arousing the inhabitants, I flung my rein to Seth, and, mounting the doorstep, peered within. As I did so, a shiny, round, black face, with whitened eyes and huge red lips, seemed to float directly toward me through the inner darkness. It was so startling an apparition that I sprang back in such haste as nearly to topple over backward from the steps. Heaven alone knows what I fancied it might be; indeed, I had little enough time in which to guess, for I had barely touched the ground,—my mind still filled with memories of Seth\u0027s grotesque horrors,—when the whole figure emerged into view, and I knew him instantly for a negro, though I had never before seen one of his race. He was a dandified-looking fellow, wearing a stiff white waistcoat fastened by gilded buttons, with a pair of short curly mustaches, waxed straight out at the ends; and ? 25 ? he stood there grinning at me in a manner that showed all his gleaming teeth. Before I could recover my wits enough to address him, I heard a voice from within the house,—a soft, drawling voice, with a marked foreign accent clinging to it. \"Sam,\" it called, \"have you found either of the scoundrelly rascals?\" The darkey started as if shot, and glanced nervously back over his shoulder. \"No, sah,\" he replied with vigor, \"dat Mistah Hawkins am not yere, sah. An\u0027 dat Mistah Burns has gone \u0027way fer gud, sah. But dar am a gemman yere, sah,—\" \"What!\" came a surprised ejaculation that caused the negro to jump, and I heard a chair overturned within. \"A gentleman? Sam, don\u0027t deceive me! For the love of Heaven, let me see him. May I be bastinadoed if it hasn\u0027t been three months since my eyes beheld the last specimen! Sam, where was it I saw the last one?\" \"Montreal, sah.\" \"By Saint Guise! \u0027tis gospel truth,\" and the speaker strode forward, candle in hand. \"Here, now, you ace of spades,\" he cried impatiently, \"hold the flame until I bid this paragon of the wilderness fit welcome in the name of Hawkins, who strangely seems to have vanished from the sylvan scene. Alas, poor Hawkins! two gentlemen at one time, I greatly ? 26 ? fear, will be the death of him. Would that his good friend Burns might be with him on this festive occasion. Ye gods, what a time it would be!\" As the black hastily reached out for the candle-stick, his erratic master as quickly changed his mind. \"No,\" he muttered thoughtfully, drawing back within the hall; \"\u0027tis far more fit that such formal greeting should occur within, where the essentials may be found with which to do full courtesy. I will instead retire. Sam, bid the gentleman meet me in the banquet hall, and then, mark you, thou archfiend of blackness, seek out at once that man Hawkins in his hidden lair, and bid him have ample repast spread instantly, on pain of my displeasure. By all the saints! if it be not at once forthcoming I will toast the scoundrel over his own slow fire.\" \"Seth,\" I said to my staring companion, as soon as I could recover from my own surprise, \"find a place for the horses somewhere in the stables, and come in.\" \"Where is your master to be found?\" I questioned of the black, whose air of self-importance had been resumed the moment he was left alone. \"Second door to de right, sah,\" he answered, gazing curiously at my deer-skin hunting-shirt as I pressed by. I had little difficulty in finding it, for all that the way was totally dark, as the fellow within was lustily ? 27 ? carolling a French love-song. I hung back for a moment, striving vainly to distinguish the words. Without pausing to make my presence known, I opened the door quietly, and stepped within. The room was not a large one, though it occupied the full width of the house; and the two lighted candles that illumined it, one sitting upon a table otherwise bare, the other occupying the rude dresser in the far corner, revealed clearly the entire interior. The sole occupant of the room sat upon a corner of the table, one foot resting on the floor, the other dangling carelessly. Hardly more than a year my elder, he bore in his face the indelible marks of a life vastly different. His features were clear-cut, and undeniably handsome, with a curl of rare good-humor to his lips and an audacious sparkle within his dark eyes. His hat, cocked and ornamented in foreign fashion, lay beside him; and I could not help noting his long hair, carefully powdered and arranged with a nicety almost conspicuous, while his clothing was rich in both texture and coloring, and exhibited many traces of vanity in ribbon and ornament. Within his belt, fastened by a large metal clasp, he wore a pearl-handled pistol with long barrel; and a rapier, with richly jewelled hilt, dangled at his side. Altogether he made a fine figure of a man, and one of a sort I had never met before. If he interested me, doubtless I was no less a ? 28 ? study to him. I could see the astonishment in his eyes, after my first entrance, change to amusement as he gazed. Then he brought a white hand down, with a smart slap, upon the board beside him. \"By all the saints!\" he exclaimed, \"but I believe the black was right. \u0027Tis the face of a gentle, or I know naught of the breed, though the attire might fool the very elect. Yet, parbleu! if memory serves, \u0027tis scarcely worse than what I wore in Spain.\" He swung down upon his feet and faced me, extending one hand with all cordiality, while lips and eyes smiled pleasantly. \"Monsieur,\" he said, bowing low, and with a grace of movement quite new to me, \"I bid you hearty welcome to whatsoever of good cheer this desert may have to offer, and present to you the companionship of Villiers de Croix. It may not seem much, yet I pledge you that kings have valued it ere now.\" It was a form of introduction most unfamiliar to me, and seemed bristling with audacity and conceit; but I recognized the heartiness of his purpose, and hastened to make fit response. \"I meet you with much pleasure,\" I answered, accepting the proffered hand. \"I am John Wayland.\" The graceful recklessness of the fellow, so conspicuous in each word and action, strongly attracted me. I confess I liked him from his first utterance, ? 29 ? although mentally, and perhaps morally as well, no two men of our age could possibly be more unlike. \"Wayland?\" he mused, with a shrug, as if the sound of the word was unpleasant. \"Wayland?—\u0027tis a harsh name to my ears, yet I have heard it mentioned before in England as that of a great family. You are English, then?\" I shook my head emphatically; for the old wounds of controversy and battle were then being opened afresh, and the feeling of antagonism ran especially high along the border. \"I am of this country,\" I protested with earnestness, \"and we call ourselves Americans.\" He laughed easily, evidently no little amused at my retort, twisting his small mustache through his slender fingers as he eyed me. \"Ah! but that is all one to me; it is ever the blood and not the name that counts, my friend. Now I am French by many a generation, Gascon by birth, and bearing commission in the Guard of the Emperor; yet sooth, \u0027tis the single accursed drop of Irish blood within my veins that brings me across the great seas and maroons me in this howling wilderness. But sit down, Monsieur. There will be both food and wine served presently, and I would speak with you more at ease.\" As he spoke he flung himself upon a low settee, carelessly motioning me toward another. ? 30 ? \"On my word,\" he said, eying me closely as I crossed over to the bench, \"but you are a big fellow for your years, and \u0027tis strength, not flabby flesh, or I know not how to judge. You would make a fine figure of a soldier, John Wayland. Napoleon perchance might offer you a marshal\u0027s baton, just to see you in the uniform. Parbleu! I have seen stranger things happen.\" \"You are now connected with the French army?\" I questioned, wondering what could have brought him to this remote spot. \"Ay, a Captain of the Guard, yet an exile, banished from the court on account of my sins. Sacre! but there are others, Monsieur. I have but one fault, my friend,—grave enough, I admit, yet but one, upon my honor, and even that is largely caused by that drop of Irish blood. I love the ladies over-well, I sometimes fear; and once I dared to look too high for favor.\" \"And have you stopped here long?\" \"Here—at Hawkins\u0027s, mean you? Ten days, as I live; would you believe I could ever have survived so grievous a siege?\" and he looked appealingly about upon the bare apartment. \"Ten days of Hawkins and of Sam, Monsieur; ay! and of Ol\u0027 Burns; of sky, and woods, and river, with never so much as a real white man even to drink liquor with. By Saint Louis! but I shall be happy enough to face you across ? 31 ? the board to-night. Yet surely it is not your purpose to halt here long?\" \"Only until I succeed in joining some party travelling westward to the Illinois country.\" \"No! is that your aim? \u0027Tis my trip also, if Fate be ever kind enough to bring hither a guide. Sacre! there was one here but now, as odd a devil as ever bore rifle, and he hath taken the western trail alone, for he hated me from the start. That was Ol\u0027 Burns. Know you him?\" \"\u0027Twas he who brought the message that sent me here; yet he said little of his own journey. But you mention not where you are bound?\" \"I seek Fort Dearborn, on the Great Lake.\" \"That likewise is to be the end of my journey. You go to explore?\" \"Explore? Faith, no,\" and he patted his hand upon the bench most merrily. \"There are but two reasons to my mind important enough to lure a French gentleman into such a hole as this, and send him wandering through your backwoods,—either war or love, Monsieur; and I know of no war that calleth me.\" Love, as he thus spoke of it, was almost an unknown term to me then; and, in truth, I scarcely grasped the full significance of his meaning. \"You seek some lady, then, at Fort Dearborn?\" I asked, for his tone seemed to invite the inquiry. ? 32 ? \"Ay!\" with quickened enthusiasm; \"\u0027tis there Toinette has hidden herself for this year or more,—Toinette, on my word as a French soldier, the fairest maid of Montreal. I have just discovered her whereabouts, yet I shall win her ere I traverse these trails again, or I am not Villiers de Croix.\" \"I travel thither to bring back a little orphan child with me,\" I explained simply, in response to his look, \"and will most gladly aid you where I can.\" Before he could answer, Hawkins, a gaunt, silent frontiersman, together with Sam, entered the room, bearing between them our evening meal. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87345.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
