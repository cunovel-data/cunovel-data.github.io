{"id":18753,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V THROUGH THE HEART OF THE FOREST","content":"W E lingered long over the wine,—for that which De Croix had furnished proved excellent, and greatly stimulated our discourse. Yet, I must confess, it was drunk chiefly by the Frenchman and Jordan; for Wells barely touched his glass, while I had never acquired a taste for such liquor. De Croix waxed somewhat boastful, toward the last; but we paid small heed to him, for I was deeply interested in Captain Wells\u0027s earlier experiences among the savages, which he related gravely and with much detail. Jordan proved himself a reckless, roistering young fellow, full of high spirits when in liquor; yet I formed an impression that he stood well in his commander\u0027s favor, for the latter warned him kindly to be more abstemious. However late it may have been when we finally sought rest, we were early astir the next morning. ? 42 ? I despatched Seth upon his return journey to the farm, bearing under his girdle as cheerful a note of farewell as I could frame; and then, though it was scarce later than sun-up, the rest of us were fairly upon the westward trail. There were in the party thirty Miami Indians, strong, lusty-looking warriors, most of them. The larger portion of them travelled in our advance, under command of one of their chiefs; a smaller detachment acting in similar manner as a rear-guard. The white men, as well as the negro, who controlled a pack animal heavily laden with his master\u0027s baggage, were on horseback; and it pleased me greatly,—for I was young and easily flattered,—to have Captain Wells rein in his horse at my side as soon as we were safely across the ford, leaving the Frenchman either to companion with Jordan or ride alone. I looked at De Croix curiously, as he moved forward with slow carelessness in our front, for he had kept the entire company waiting outside the house for half an hour in the gray dawn while he curled and powdered his hair. Doubtless this was what so disgusted Wells, whose long black locks were worn in a simple queue, tied somewhat negligently with a dark cord. I almost smiled at the scowl upon his swarthy face, as he contemplated the fashionably attired dandy, whose bright-colored raiment was conspicuous against the dark forest-leaves that walled us round. \"I have heard it claimed these gay French beaux ? 43 ? fight well when need arises,\" he commented at last, thoughtfully; \"but \u0027tis surely a poor place here for flaunting ribbons and curling locks. Possibly my fine gentleman yonder may have occasion to test his mettle before we ride back again. Sure it is that if that time ever comes he will not look so sweet.\" \"You make me feel that we go forward into real peril,\" I said, wondering that he should seem so fearful of the outcome, \"Have you special reason?\" \"The Miamis have already been approached by Indian runners, and their young men are restless. It was only because I am the adopted son of Big Turtle, and a recognized warrior of their tribe, that these have consented to accompany me; and I fear they may desert at the first sign of a hostile meeting,\" he answered gravely. \"There is an Indian conspiracy forming, and a most dangerous one, involving, so far as I can learn, every tribe north of the Ohio. Now that war with England has actually been declared, there can no longer be doubt that the chiefs will take sides with the British. They have everything to gain and little to lose by such action. The rumor was at Fort Wayne, even before we left, that Mackinac had already fallen; and if that prove true, every post west of the Alleghanies is in danger. I fear that death and flame will sweep the whole frontier; and I frankly acknowledge, Wayland, my only hope in this expedition is that, by hard travel, we may be able to reach Chicagou ? 44 ? and return again before the outbreak comes. Tom Burns, an old scout of Wayne\u0027s, and a settler in that country, was at Fort Wayne a month since with an urgent message from the commandant at Dearborn. I tell you frankly, it will be touch and go with us.\" \"Chicagou?\" I questioned, for the word was one I had heard but once before and was of an odd sound. \"Ay! old Au Sable called it the Chicagou portage long before the fort named Dearborn was ever established there. \u0027Tis the name the French applied to a small river entering the Great Lake from the west at that point.\" \"Have you journeyed there before?\" \"Once, in 1803. I held Indian council on the spot, and helped lay out the government reservation. \u0027Tis a strange flat country, with much broken land extending to the northward.\" Little by little our conversation lapsed into silence; for the narrow trail we followed was a most difficult one, and at times taxed our ingenuity to the utmost. It led through dense dark woods, fortunately free from underbrush, skirted the uncertain edges of numerous marshes in the soft ooze of which the hoofs of our horses sank dangerously, and for several miles followed the sinuous course of a small but rapid stream, the name of which I have forgotten. There were few openings in the thick forest-growth, and the matted branches overhead, interlaced with luxuriant ? 45 ? wild vines, so completely shut out all vestige of the sun that we toiled onward, hour after hour, in continuous twilight. What mysterious signs our guides followed, I was not sufficiently expert in woodcraft to determine. To my eyes,—and I sought to observe with care,—there was nowhere visible the slightest sign that others had ever preceded us; it was all unbroken, virgin wilderness, marked only by slow centuries of growth. The accumulation of moss on the tree-trunks, as well as the shading of the leaves, told me that we continued to journey almost directly westward; and there was no perceptible hesitancy in our steady progress, save as we deviated from it here and there because of natural obstacles too formidable to be directly surmounted. We skirted immense trees, veritable monarchs of the ages, hoary with time, grim guardians of such forest solitudes; climbed long hills roughened by innumerable boulders with sharp edges hidden beneath the fallen leaves, that lamed our horses; or descended into dark and gloomy ravines, dank with decaying vegetation, finally halting for a brief meal upon the southern edge of a small lake, the water of which was as clear and blue as the cloudless August sky that arched it. The sand of the shore where we rested was white as snow, yet De Croix had his man spread a cloak upon it before he ventured to sit down, and ? 46 ? with care tucked a lace handkerchief about his throat to prevent stray crumbs from soiling the delicate yellow of his waistcoat. \"One might fancy this was to be your wedding day, Monsieur,\" observed Wells, sarcastically, as he marked these dainty preparations, and noted with disgust the attentive negro hovering near. \"We are not perfumed courtiers dancing at the court of Versailles.\" De Croix glanced about him carelessly. \"Mon Dieu, no,\" he said, tapping the lid of a richly chased silver snuff-box with his slender fingers. \"Yet, my dear friend, a French gentleman cannot wholly forget all that belongs to the refinements of society, even in the heart of the wilderness. Sam, by any foul chance did you overlook the lavender water?\" \"No, sah; it am safe in de saddle-bags.\" \"And the powder-puff, the small hand-mirror, and the curling-iron?\" \"I saw to ebery one ob dem, sah.\" De Croix gave a deep sigh of relief, and rested back upon the cloak, negligently crossing his legs. \"Captain,\" he remarked slowly and thoughtfully, \"you\u0027ve no idea the trouble that negro is to me. Would you believe it? he actually left my nail-brush behind at Detroit, and not another to be had for love or money this side of Montreal! And only last night he mislaid a box of rouge, and, by Saint Denis! I ? 47 ? hardly dare hope there is so much as an ounce of it in the whole party.\" \"I rather suspect not,\" was the somewhat crusty reply; \"yet if a bit of bear\u0027s grease could be made to serve your turn, we might possibly find some among us.\" \"I know not its virtue,\" admitted the Frenchman gravely; \"yet if it reddens the lips it might be useful. But that which I had came from the shop of Jessold in Paris, and is beyond all price.\" We were ten days upon this forest journey, from the time of our crossing the Maumee; and they were hard days, even to those of us long habituated to the hardships of border travel. Indeed, I know few forms of exertion that so thoroughly test the mettle of men as journeying across the wilderness. There are no artificial surroundings, either to inspire or restrain; and insensibly humanity returns to natural conditions, permitting the underlying savage to gain ascendency. I have seen more than one seemingly polished gentleman, resplendent with all the graces of the social code, degenerate into a surly brute with only a few hours of such isolation and the ceaseless irritation of the trail. Yet I must acknowledge that De Croix accepted it all without a murmur, and as became a man. His entire plaint was over the luxuries he must forego, and he made far more ado about a bit of dust soiling his white linen than about any real hardship of the ? 48 ? march. \u0027Tis my memory that he rather grew upon us; for his natural spirits were so high that he sang where others swore, and found cause for amusement and laughter in much that tested sorely even the Indian-like patience of Wells. He was like a boy, this gayly perfumed dandy of the French court; but beneath his laces and ribbons, his affectations and conceits, there hid a stout heart that bade him smile where other men would lie down and die. He companioned mostly with Jordan as we journeyed, for Wells never could become reconciled to his mincing ways; yet I confess now that I began to value him greatly, and longed more than once to join with the two who rode in our advance, cheering their wearisome way with quips of fancy and snatches of song. He knew it too, the tantalizing rascal, and would frequently send back a biting squib over his shoulder, hoping thus to draw me away from the silent grim-faced soldier beside whom I held place. It was truly a rough and wild journey, full enough of hardship, and without adventure to give zest to the ceaseless toil. I know now that we made a wide detour to the southward, trusting thus to avoid any possible contact with prowling bands of either Pottawattomies or Wyandots, whom our friendly Miamis seemed greatly to dread. This took us far from the regular trail, rough and ill-defined as that was, and plunged us into an untrodden wilderness; so that ? 49 ? there were times when we fairly had to cut our way through the twisted forest branches and tangled brakes of cane with tomahawks and hunting-knives. We skirted rocky bluffs, toiled painfully over fallen timber, or waded ankle deep in softened clay, in the black gloomy shadows of dense woods which seemed interminable, meeting with nothing human, yet constantly startling wild game from the hidden coverts, and feeling more and more, as we advanced, the loneliness and danger of our situation,—realizing that each league we travelled only added to the length and peril of our retreat if ever disaster came or Fort Dearborn were found deserted. Captain Wells, naturally grave and silent from his long training among savages, grew more and more reticent and watchful as we progressed, riding often at my side for hours without uttering a word, his keen eyes warily searching the dark openings upon every hand as if suspecting that each spot of gloom might prove the chosen place for an ambuscade. Our Indian allies moved like shadows, gliding over the ground noiselessly; and the occasional outbursts of merriment from De Croix and his equally reckless companion grew gradually less frequent, and appeared more forced. The constant and never-ending toil of our progress, the depressing gloom of the sombre primeval forest on every side of us, the knowledge of possible peril lurking in each league of this haunted ? 50 ? silence, weighed upon us all, and at last closed the lips of even the most jovial of our number. It was the tenth day, as I remember,—though it may have been later, for I have no writing to guide me concerning dates,—when we emerged into a broad valley, treeless save for a thin fringe of dwarfed growth skirting the bank of a shallow stream which ran almost directly westward. I cannot describe how sweet, after our gloomy journey, the sunlight appeared, as we first marked it play in golden waves over the long grass; or the relief we felt at being able to gaze ahead once more and see something of the country that we were traversing. \u0027Twas like a sudden release from prison. Our jaded horses felt with us the exhilaration of the change, and moved with greater sprightliness than they had shown for days. As the sun began its circle downward, vast rolling hills of white and yellow sand arose upon the right of our line of march, huge mounds, many of them, glistening in the sunshine, some jagged at the summit, others rounded as if by art, so unusual in form and presence that I ventured to address our leader regarding them, as he rode with his head bent low and a far-off look in his eyes. \"The sand?\" he questioned, glancing up as if startled at the sound of my voice. \"Why, it has been cast there by the stormy waves of the Great Lake, my lad, and beaten into those strange and fantastic shapes ? 51 ? by the action of the wind. Doubtless \u0027tis the work of centuries of storms.\" \"Are we, then, so close to the lake?\" I asked eagerly,—for I had never yet seen so large a body of water, and his description fired my imagination. \"\u0027Tis but just beyond those dunes yonder, and will be still nearer when we come to camp. Possibly you might reach the shore before dark if you exercise care,—for there is danger of becoming lost in that sand desert. Those hills seem all alike when once you are among them.\" \"What is it that so greatly disturbs your Miamis?\" I ventured to ask, for I had been noticing for some time that they were restless and travelling poorly. \"They have been counselling now for two hours.\" He glanced aside at me in apparent surprise. \"Why, boy, I thought you were bred to the border; and can you ask me such a question? Do you observe nothing, like that fine gentleman yonder? What have we been following since first we entered this valley?\" \"An old Indian trail.\" \"True,\" he exclaimed, \"and one that has been traversed by a large war-party, bound west, within twelve hours.\" \"How know you this?\" \"By a hundred signs far plainer than print will ever be to my eyes. In faith, I thought those fellows ? 52 ? out yonder would have summoned me to council long ere this, instead of threshing it out among themselves. They are bolder warriors than I deemed, though they will doubtless revolt in earnest when we camp. We shall have to guard them well to-night.\" As he paused, his eyes fixed anxiously upon our Indian allies, De Croix began to hum a popular tune of the day, riding meanwhile, hat in hand, with one foot out of the stirrup to beat the time. Then Jordan caught up the refrain, and sang a verse. I saw one or two of the older Indians glance around at him in grave displeasure. \"The young fools!\" muttered Wells, uneasily. \"I shall enjoy seeing if that French popinjay keeps all of his fine airs when the hour for stern work comes.\" He lifted his voice. \"Jordan!\" The young soldier instantly ceased his song, and turned in his saddle to glance back. \"The time has come when I must insist on less noise, and more decorum upon the march,\" Wells said sternly. \"This is not Fort Wayne, nor is our road devoid of danger. Captain de Croix, I shall have to request you also to cease your singing for the present.\" There was that in his voice and manner which forbade remark, and we rode on silently. I asked: \"But you have not explained to me how you learned all this of which you spoke?\" ? 53 ? \"By the use of my eyes, of course. It is all simple; there are marks beside the beaten trail, as well as in its track, which prove clearly the party ahead of us to be moving westward, that it travelled rapidly, and was certainly not less than a hundred strong, with ponies and lodge-poles. Not more than a league back we passed the evidences of a camp that had not been deserted longer than twelve hours; and when we crossed the river, a feather from a war-bonnet was lying in the grass. These are small details, yet they tell the story. That feather, for instance, was dropped from a Pottawattomie head-dress, and no doubt there are warriors among those Indians yonder who could name the chief who wore it. It simply means, my lad, that the savages are gathering in toward Dearborn, and we may reach there all too late.\" \"Is the way yet long?\" and my eyes sought the horizon, where the sun hung like a red ball of fire. \"We should be there by the morrow,\" he answered, \"for we are now rounding the head of the Great Lake. I wish to God I might see what fate awaits us there.\" Young and thoughtless as I was in those days, I could not fail to realize the depth of feeling which swayed this stern, experienced man; and I rode on beside him, questioning no more. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87347.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
