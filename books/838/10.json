{"id":18758,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X A LANE OF PERIL","content":"W E passed a group of young cottonwoods, the only trees I had noted along the shore; and a few hundred feet ahead of us, the ridge of sand, which had obscured our westward view so long, gradually fell away, permitting the eye to sweep across the wide expanse of level plain until halted by a distant row of stunted trees that seemed to line a stream of some importance. As Captain Wells spoke, my glance, which had been fixed upon these natural objects, was instantly attracted by a strange scene of human activity that unfolded to the north and west. The land before us lay flat and low, with the golden sun of the early afternoon resting hot upon it, revealing each detail in an animated panorama wherein barbarism and civilization each bore a conspicuous part. The Fort was fully a mile and a half distant, and I could distinguish little of its outward appearance, ? 96 ? save that it seemed low and solidly built, like a stockade of logs set upon end in the ground. It appeared gloomy, grim, inhospitable, with its gates tightly closed, and no sign of life anywhere along its dull walls; yet my heart was thrilled at catching the bright colors of the garrison flag as the western breeze rippled its folds against the blue background of the sky. But it was outside those log barriers that our eyes encountered scenes of the greatest interest,—a mingling of tawdry decoration and wild savagery, where fierce denizens of forest and plain made their barbaric show. No finer stage for such a spectacle could well be conceived. Upon one side stretched the great waste of waters; on the other, level plains, composed of yellow sand quickly merging into the green and brown of the prairie, while, scattered over its surface, from the near lake-shore to the distant river, were figures constantly moving, decked in gay feathers and daubed with war-paint. Westward from the Fort, toward the point where a branch of the main river appeared to emerge from the southward, stood a large village of tepees, the sun shining yellow and white on their deer-skin coverings and making an odd glow in the smoke that curled above the lodge-poles. From where we rode it looked to be a big encampment, alive with figures of Indians. My companion and I both noted, ? 97 ? and spoke together of the fact, that they all seemed braves; squaws there may have been, but of children there were none visible. Populous as this camp appeared, the plain stretching between it and us was literally swarming with savages. A few were mounted upon horses, riding here and there with upraised spears, their hair flying wildly behind them, their war-bonnets gorgeous in the sunshine. By far the greater number, however, were idling about on foot, stalwart, swarthy fellows, with long black locks, and half-naked painted forms. One group was listening to the words of a chief; others were playing at la crosse; but most of them were merely moving restlessly here and there, not unlike caged wild animals, eager to be free. I heard Captain Wells draw in his breath sharply. \"As I live!\" he ejaculated, \"there can be scarce less than a thousand warriors in that band,—and no trading-party either, if I know aught of Indian signs.\" Before I could answer him, even had I any word to say, a chief broke away from the gathering mass in our immediate front, and rode headlong down upon us, bringing his horse to its haunches barely a yard away. He was a large, sinewy man, his face rendered hideous by streaks of yellow and red, wearing a high crown of eagle feathers, with a scalp of long light-colored ? 98 ? hair, still bloody, dangling at his belt. For a moment he and Captain Wells looked sternly into each other\u0027s eyes without speaking. Then the savage broke silence. \"Wau-mee-nuk great brave,\" he said, sullenly, in broken English, using Wells\u0027s Indian name, \"but him big fool come here now. Why not stay with Big Turtle? He tell him Pottawattomie not want him here.\" \"Big Turtle did tell me,\" was the quiet answer, \"that the Pottawattomies had made bad medicine and were dancing the war-dance in their villages; but I have met Pottawattomies before, and am not afraid. They have been my friends, and I have done them no wrong.\" He looked intently at the disguised face before him, seeking to trace the features. \"You are Topenebe,\" he said at last. \"True,\" returned the chief, with proud gravity. \"You serve me well once; for that I come now, and tell you go back,—there is trouble here.\" Wells\u0027s face darkened. \"Have I ever been a coward,\" he asked indignantly, \"that I should turn and run for a threat? Think you, Topenebe, that I fear to sing the death-song? I have lived in the woods, and gone forth with your war-parties; am I less a warrior, now that I fight with the people of my own race? Go take your ? 99 ? warning to some squaw; we ride straight on to Dearborn, even though we have to fight our way.\" The Indian glanced, as Wells pointed, toward the Fort, and sneered. \"All old women in there,\" he exclaimed derisively. \"Say this to-day, and that to-morrow. They shut the gates now to keep Indian on outside. No trade, no rum, no powder,—just lies. But they no keep back our young men much longer.\" His face grew dark, and his eyes angry. \"Why you bring them?\" he asked hotly, designating our escort of Miamis, already shrinking from the taunts of the gathering braves. \"They dog Indians, bad medicine; they run fast when Pottawattomie come.\" \"Don\u0027t be so certain about that, Topenebe,\" retorted Wells, shortly. \"But we cannot stop longer here; make way, that we may pass along. Jordan, push on with your advance through that rabble there.\" The Indian chief drew his horse back beside the trail, and we moved slowly forward, our Indian guides slightly in advance, and exhibiting in every action the disinclination they felt to proceed, and their constantly increasing fear of the wild horde that now resorted to every means in their power, short of actual violence, to retard their progress. As they closed in more closely around us, taunting the Miamis unmercifully, ? 100 ? even shaking tomahawks in their faces, with fierce eyes full of hatred and murder, I drew back my horse until I ranged up beside Mademoiselle Antoinette, and thus we rode steadily onward through that frenzied, howling mass, the girl between De Croix and me, who thus protected her on either side. It was truly a weary ride, full of insult, and perchance of grave peril had we faced that naked mob less resolutely. Doubtless the chiefs restrained their young men somewhat, but more than once we came within a hair\u0027s-breadth of serious conflict. They hemmed us in so tightly that we could only walk our horses; and twice they pressed upon Jordan so hard as to halt him altogether, bunching his cowardly Miamis, and even striking them contemptuously with their blackened sticks. The second time this occurred, Captain Wells rode forward to force a path, driving the spurs into his horse so quickly that the startled animal fairly cut a lane through the crowded savages before they could draw back. Naught restrained them from open violence but their knowledge of that stern-faced swarthy soldier who fronted them with such dauntless courage. Hundreds in that swarm had seen him before, when, as the adopted son of a great war-chief of the Miamis he had been at their side in many a wild foray along the border. \"Wau-mee-nuk, the white chief,\" passed from lip to lip; and sullenly, slowly, reluctantly, the frenzied ? 101 ? red circle fell back, as he pressed his rearing horse full against them. How hideous their painted faces looked, as we slowly pushed past them, their lips shrieking insult, their sinewy hands gripping at our stirrups, their brandished weapons shaken in our faces. With firm-set lips and watchful eyes I rode, bent well forward, so as best to protect the girl, my rifle held across my saddle pommel. Twice some vengeful arm struck me a savage blow, and once a young devil with long matted hair hanging over his fierce eyes thrust a sharpened stake viciously at the girl\u0027s face. I struck with quick-clinched hand, and he reeled back into the mass with a sharp cry of pain. My eyes caught the sudden dazzle, as De Croix whipped out his rapier. \"Not that, Monsieur!\" I cried hastily, across her horse\u0027s neck. \"Use the hilt, not the blade, unless you wish to die.\" He heard me above the clamor, and with a quick turn of the weapon struck fiercely at a scowling brave who grasped at his horse\u0027s rein. He smiled pleasantly across at me, his fingers twisting his small mustache. \"\u0027Tis doubtless good advice, friend Wayland,\" he said, carelessly, \"but these copper-colored devils are indeed most annoying upon this side, and I may lose my temper ere we reach the gate.\" \"For the sake of her who rides between us, I beg that you hold in hard, Monsieur,\" I answered. ? 102 ? \"\u0027T would be over-much to pay, I imagine, for a hot brain.\" I glanced at her as I spoke, scarcely conscious even then that I had removed my eyes from the threatening mob that pressed me, though I know I must have done so, for I retain the picture of her yet. She rode facing me, although her saddle was of the old army type with merely a folded blanket to soften its sharp contours, and her foot could barely find firm support within the narrow strap above the wooden stirrup. She sat erect and easily, swaying gently to the slow step of the horse. Her face was pale, but there was no evidence of timidity in her dark eyes, and she smiled at me as our glances met. \"You are surely a brave girl, Mademoiselle!\" I exclaimed, unable to restrain my admiration. \"\u0027Tis a scene to try any nerves.\" \"Yet almost worth the danger,\" she returned softly, \"to realize what men can be in such stress of need. You are the real—Beware of that half-breed, Monsieur!\" Her last words were a quick warning, yet my eyes were already upon the fellow, and as he dodged down, knife in hand, to aim a vicious lunge at the forward leg of her horse, I brought the stock of my rifle crunching against his shoulder. The next instant we had passed over his naked body as he lay gasping in the trail. ? 103 ? \"See!\" she cried, with eagerness. \"The gates are opened!\" We were possibly a hundred yards from the southern front of the stockade, when I glanced forward and saw the level ground between a seething mass of savage forms, so densely wedged together as to block further progress. I could see hundreds of brown sinewy arms uplifted from a sea of faces to brandish weapons of every description, and marked how the Miamis cowered like whipped curs behind the protection of Wells\u0027s horse, while close beside him stood Jordan, erect and silent as if on parade, a rifle grasped in his hands, his head bare, a great welt showing redly across his white forehead. A little party, hardly more than twenty infantrymen, marched steadily out from the open gateway of the Fort. The first file bore bayonets fixed upon their guns, and the naked savages fell slowly back before the polished steel. It was smartly done, and it thrilled my blood to note with what silent determination that small band of disciplined men pressed their way onward, passing through the threatening mass of redskins as indifferently as if they had been forest trees. A young, smooth-faced fellow, wearing a new officer\u0027s uniform, led them, sword in hand, a smile of light contempt upon his lips. \"Clear the space wider, Campbell!\" he said sternly, to the big corporal at his side. \"Swing your ? 104 ? files to left and right, and push the rabble out of the way.\" They did it with the butts of their guns, laughing at the brandished knives and tomahawks and the fierce painted faces that scowled at them, paying no apparent heed to the taunts and insults showered from every side. There were some stones thrown, a few blows were struck, but no rifle-shot broke the brief struggle. The young officer strode forward down the open space, and fronted our advance. \"I presume this is Captain Wells, from Fort Wayne?\" he said, lifting his cap as he spoke. \"It is,\" was the reply, \"and I am very glad to find that you still hold Fort Dearborn.\" The other\u0027s frank and boyish face darkened slightly, as if at an unpleasant memory. \"\u0027Tis no fault of some,\" he muttered hastily; then he checked himself. \"We are glad to greet you, Captain Wells,\" he added, in a more formal tone, glancing about upon us, \"and your party. I am Ensign Ronan, of the garrison; and if you will kindly pass between my guard lines, you will find Captain Heald awaiting you within.\" Thus we rode freely forward, with the guarding soldiery on either side of us, their faces to the howling savages; we passed in at the great southern gate, and halted amid the buildings of old Fort Dearborn.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87352.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
