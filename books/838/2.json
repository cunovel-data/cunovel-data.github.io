{"id":18750,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II THE CALL OF DUTY","content":"I T was upon my mind all through that long afternoon, as I swung the scythe in the meadow grass. I saw Burns ride away up the river trail soon after I returned to work, and wondered if he bore with him any message from my father. It was like a romance to me, to whom so few important things had ever happened. In some way, the coming of this letter out of the great unknown had lifted me above the narrow life of the clearing. My world had always been so small, such a petty and restricted circle, that this new interest coming within its horizon had widened it wonderfully. I had grown up on the border, isolated from what men term civilization; and I could justly claim to know chiefly those secrets which the frontier teaches its children. My only remembrance of a different mode of life centred about the ragged streets of a ? 10 ? small New England village, where I had lived in earlier childhood. Ever since, we had been in the depths of the backwoods; and after my father\u0027s accident I became the one upon whom the heavier part of the work fell. I had truly thrived upon it. In my hunting-trips, during the dull seasons, I learned many a trick of the forest, and had already borne rifle twice when the widely scattered settlements were called to arms by Indian forays. There were no schools in that country; indeed, our nearest neighbor was ten miles distant as the crow flies. But my mother had taught me, with much love and patience, from her old treasured school-books; and this, with other lore from the few choice volumes my father clung to through his wanderings, gave me much to ponder over. I still remember the evenings when he read to us gravely out of his old Shakespeare, dwelling tenderly upon passages he loved. And he instructed me in other things,—in honor and manliness, in woodcraft, and many a pretty thing at arms, until no lad in the settlements around could outdo me in rough border sport. I loved to hear him, of a boisterous winter night,—he spoke of such matters but seldom,—tell about his army life, the men he had fought beside and loved, the daring deeds born of his younger blood. In that way he had sometimes mentioned this Roger Matherson; and it was like a blow to me now to hear of his death. I wondered what the little girl ? 11 ? would be like; and my heart went out to her in her loneliness. Scarcely realizing it, I was lonely also. \"Has he spoken yet?\" I questioned anxiously of my mother, as I came up to the open kitchen door when the evening chores were done. \"No, John,\" she answered, \"he has been sitting there silently looking out at the woods ever since the man left. He is thinking, dear, and we must not worry him.\" The supper-table had been cleared away, and Seth, the hired man, had crept up the creaking ladder to his bed under the eaves, before my father spoke. We were all three together in the room, and I had drawn his chair forward, as was my custom, where the candle-light flickered upon his face. I knew by the look of calm resolve in his gray eyes that a decision had been reached. \"Mary,\" he began gravely, \"and you, John, we must talk together of this new duty which has just come to us. I hardly know what to decide, for we are so poor and I am now so helpless; yet I have prayed earnestly for guidance, and can but think it must be God\u0027s will that we care for this poor orphan child of my old friend.\" My mother crossed the room to him, and bent down until her soft cheek touched his lips. \"I knew you would, David,\" she whispered, in the tender way she had, her hand pressing back his short ? 12 ? gray hair. \"She shall ever be unto us as our own little girl,—the one we lost come back to us again.\" My father bent his head wearily upon one hand, his eyes upon the candle flame, his other hand patting her fingers. \"It must be all of ten years,\" he said slowly, \"since last I had word of Roger Matherson. He was in Canada then, yet has never since been long out of my mind. He saved my life, not once alone, as he would seem to remember, but three separate times in battle. We were children together in the blue Berkshire hills, and during all our younger manhood were more than brothers. His little one shall henceforth be as my own child. God hath given her unto us, Mary, as truly as if she had been born of our love. I knew that Roger had married, yet heard nothing of the birth of the child or the loss of his wife. However, from this hour the orphan is to be our own; and we must now decide upon some safe means of bringing her here without delay.\" He paused. No one of us spoke. His glance slowly wandered from the candle flame, until it settled gravely upon my face as I sat resting on a rude bench fitted into the chimney corner. He looked so intently at me that my mother seemed instantly to interpret his thought. \"Oh, surely not that, David?\" she exclaimed, pleadingly. \"Not John?\" \"I know of no other fit messenger, little woman,\" ? 13 ? he answered soberly. \"It has indeed troubled me far more than all the rest, to decide on this; yet there is no one else whom I think equal to the task. John is a good boy, mother, and has sufficient experience in woodcraft to make the journey.\" \"But the savages!\" she insisted. \"\u0027Tis said we are upon the verge of a fresh outbreak, stirred up by this new war with England, that may involve the settlements at any time. You know Burns told you just now,—and he is an old scout, familiar with the West,—that British agents were active along the whole border, and there was great uneasiness among the Indian tribes.\" \"There is serious promise of danger, \u0027tis true,\" he admitted, a flash of the old fire in his eyes. \"Yet that is scarce likely to halt David Wayland\u0027s son. Indeed, it is the greater reason why this helpless orphan child should be early brought to our protection. Think of the defenceless little girl exposed alone to such danger! Nor have we means of judging, Mary, of the real seriousness of the situation to the north and west. War between the nations may very likely arouse the spirit of the savages, yet rumors of Indian outbreak are always on the lips of the settlers. Burns himself was upon his return westward, and did not seem greatly troubled lest he fail to get through. He claimed to live at Chicagou Portage, wherever that may be. I only know it is the extreme frontier.\" ? 14 ? My mother did not answer; and now I spoke, my cheeks aflame with eagerness. \"Do you truly mean, sir, that I am to go in search of the little girl?\" I asked, barely trusting my own ears. \"Yes, John,\" my father replied gravely, motioning me to draw closer to his chair. \"This is a duty which has fallen to you as well as to your mother and me. We can, indeed, but poorly spare you from the work at this season; yet Seth will be able to look after the more urgent needs of the farm while you are absent, while he would prove quite useless on such a mission as this. Do not worry, Mary. Friend Burns is well acquainted with all that western country, and he tells me there is scarcely a week that parties of soldiers, or friendly Indians, do not pass along the trail, and that by waiting at Hawkins\u0027s place for a few days John will be sure to find some one with whom he may companion on the long journey westward. He would himself have accompanied him, but must first bear a message to friends at Vincennes. It is now some weeks since Roger Matherson died, and we shall prove unworthy of our trust if we delay longer in sending for his daughter.\" Though my mother was a western woman, patient and long habituated to sacrifice and peril, still her eyes, fixed upon my face, were filled with tears, and the color had deserted her cheeks. \"I know not why it should be so, David,\" she ? 15 ? urged softly; \"but in my heart I greatly fear this trip for John. Yet you have ever found me ready to yield wherever it seemed best, and I doubt not you are right in your decision.\" At any other time I should have gone to her with words of comfort and good cheer; but now my ambition was so aroused by this impending adventure as to permit me to think of nothing else. \"Is it so very far, father, to where I must go?\" I questioned, eagerly. \"Where is this Fort Dearborn, and how am I to journey in reaching there? \u0027Tis no garrison of which I have ever heard.\" \"Bring me the map your mother made of this country, and the regions to the westward,\" he said. \"I am not over clear in regard to the matter myself, although friend Burns, who claims to know all that country, gave me some brief description; but I found him most chary of speech.\" I got the map out of the great square cupboard in the corner, and spread the paper flat upon the table, placing knives at each corner to hold it open. I rolled his chair up before it, and the three of us bent our heads over the map together, our faces glowing in the candle flame. It was a copy made by a quill from a great government map my mother had seen somewhere in her journeying westward; and, though only a rude design, it was not badly done, and was sufficiently accurate for our purpose. Much of it was ? 16 ? still blank; yet the main open trails had been traced with care, the principal fords over the larger streams were marked, and the various government posts and trading settlements distinctly located and named. Searching for the head of the Great Lake, we were not long in discovering the position of the fort called Dearborn, which seemingly was posted upon the western shore, nearly opposite another garrison point at the mouth of the St. Joseph river. We were able to trace with clearness the military road that had been constructed northward from Fort Wayne, our nearest government post; but the map failed to exhibit evidence of any beaten track, or used trail, leading westward and around the head of the lake. There were numerous irregular lines which denoted unnamed streams, but by far the larger portion of the territory extending to the west beyond Fort Wayne had been simply designated as \"forest land\" and \"unexplored.\" \"Friend Burns tells me there is a trail used by both troops and savages, which he has traversed several times,\" my father explained, as he lifted his eyes from the map; \"but it is not over plain, nor easily followed, as communication with the Fort is mostly maintained by means of the waterways to the northward. The overland journey, however, will prove speedier, besides being less liable to disaster for one unaccustomed to boats. How soon can John be ready, mother?\" ? 17 ? Her voice trembled, and I felt the pressure of her hand upon my sleeve. \"It will take all of the morrow, David, to prepare his clothing properly,\" she replied, with the patient resignation of the frontier. \"There is much that will need seeing after.\" \"Then John will start the next dawn. You had best ride the brown colt, my son; he is of good breed, and speedy. Seth shall accompany you until you find suitable companionship at Hawkins\u0027s. He will bring back word of how you started, and that knowledge will greatly comfort your mother.\" He paused, and held out his thin hands. \"You go upon this strange journey willingly, my son?\" \"Yes, father.\" \"You will be both kind and thoughtful with Roger Matherson\u0027s little girl?\" \"She shall be to me as my own sister.\" I felt the confiding clasp of his fingers, and realized how much to him would be a successful termination of my journey. \"Kiss your mother, John,\" he said, a trustful look coming into his kindly eyes. \"We must all be astir early on the morrow.\" Beneath the rived shingles of my little room, under the sloping roof, how I turned and tossed through those long night hours! What visions, both ? 18 ? asleep and awake, came to me, thronging fast upon my heated brain, each more marvellous than its fellow, and all alike pointing toward that strange country which I was now destined by fate to travel! Vague tales of wonder and mystery had come floating to me out of that unknown West, and now I was to behold it all with my own eyes. But marvellous as were my dreams, the reality was to be even more amazing than these pictures of boyish imagination. Had I known the truth that night, I doubt greatly whether I should have had the courage to face it. At last the gray dawn came, stealing in at the only window, and found me eager for the trial.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87344.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
