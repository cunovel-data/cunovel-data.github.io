{"id":18762,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV DARKNESS AND SURPRISE","content":"I T was a greater distance to the water than I had supposed, but I struck at last fairly enough, and went down until I thought I should never come up again. As I rose to the surface and shook the moisture from my face and ears, a light laugh rang out high above me, and Mademoiselle\u0027s clear voice cried mockingly: \"The backwoodsman has taken the first trick, Monsieur.\" I saw De Croix\u0027s body dart, like a black arrow, far out into the air, and come sweeping down. He struck to my left, and a trifle behind me; but I waited not to learn just how. With lusty strokes I struck out for the north shore. It was a hard swim, for my deerskins held the water like so many bags, and the current, though not rapid, was sufficiently strong to ? 142 ? make me fight valiantly for every foot of way. I came out, panting heavily, upon a low bank of soft mud, and crept cautiously up under the black shadow of some low bushes growing there. I took time, as I rested, to glance back, hoping thus to learn more of the direction I should follow; for the Kinzie light was no longer visible, and my struggle with the current had somewhat bewildered me. I neither saw nor heard anything of De Croix; but the flame of the candle gleaming through the narrow slits of the block-house told me clearly where it stood, while a wild yelling farther to the southward convinced me that our Indian besiegers were yet astir and concocting some fresh deviltry at their camp. With a half-uttered prayer that they might all be there, I hastily pressed the water from my soggy clothes and plunged forward into the unknown darkness. A big cottonwood, as from its shape I judged it to be, rose against the stars in my front,—a dim outline swaying slightly in the westerly wind, and I took it as my first guide-mark, moving over the rough unknown ground as rapidly and silently as possible. The soft moccasins I wore aided me greatly, nor were there many trees along the way to drop twigs in the path to crackle under foot; yet I found the ground uneven and deceptive, rifted with small gullies, and more or less bestrewn with stones, against which I stumbled in the darkness. I was too thoroughly ? 143 ? trained in the stern and careful school of the frontier not to be cautious at such a time, for I knew that silence and seeming desolation were no proof of savage desertion; nor did I believe that Indian strategy would leave the north of the Fort wholly unguarded. Any rock, any black ravine, any clump of trees or bushes, might well be the lurking-place of hostiles, who would only too gladly wreak their vengeance upon any hapless straggler falling into their hands. I was unarmed, save for the long hunting-knife I carried in the bosom of my shirt; but my thought was not of fighting,—it was to get through without discovery. To De Croix I gave small consideration, save that the memory of the wager was a spur to urge me forward at greater speed. The place was strangely, painfully still; even the savage yelling of the distant Indians seemed to die away as I advanced, and nothing broke the oppressive silence but an occasional flutter of leaves, or my own deep breathing. I had gone, I take it, half or three-quarters of a mile, not directly north, but circling ever to the eastward, seeking thus to reach the house from the rear, when I came to a sharp break in the surface of the land, somewhat deeper and more abrupt than those before encountered. It seemed like a cut or ravine made by some rush of water lakeward; and, as I hesitated upon the edge of it, peering across and wondering if I had better risk the plunge, my eyes caught the blaze of the Kinzie ? 144 ? light scarce a hundred yards from the opposite bank of the ravine. Assured that I was headed right, I stepped off with a new confidence that, for the moment, conquered my usual prudence,—for the steep bank gave way instantly beneath my weight. I grasped vainly at the edge, fell heavily sidewise, and rolled like a great log, bruised and half-stunned, into the black gorge below. I remember gripping at a slender bush that yielded to my touch; but all the rest was no more than a breathless tumble, until I struck something soft at the bottom,—something that squirmed and gripped my long hair savagely, and pushed my head back with a grasp on the throat that nearly throttled me. It was all so sudden, so unexpected, that for the moment I was helpless as a child, struggling merely from the natural instinct of preservation to break free. I could perceive nothing, the darkness was so intense; yet as I gradually succeeded in getting my hands loose, I wound them in long coarse hair, pressed them against bare flesh, heard deep labored breathing close to my face, and believed I was struggling with a savage. It was a question of mere brute strength, and neither of us had had the advantage of surprise. I could feel the sharp prick of my own knife as he hugged me to him, but I dare not reach for it, and I held his arms so tightly that he lay panting and struggling as if in a vise. It was an odd fight, as we turned ? 145 ? and tossed, writhed and twisted among those sharp pointed rocks like two infuriated wild-cats in the dark, neither venturing to break hold for a blow, nor having breath enough in our bodies for so much as a curse. My adversary struck me once with his head under the chin, so hard a blow that everything turned red before me; and then I got my knee up into the pit of his stomach and caused him to quiver from the agony of it; yet the fellow clung to me like a bull-terrier, and never so much as whined. It was never my nature to yield easily, and I felt now this struggle was to cost his life or mine; so I clinched my teeth, and sought my best to push back the other\u0027s head until the neck should crack. But if I was a powerful man, this other was no less so, and he fought with a fierce and silent desperation that foiled me. We dug and tore, gouged and struck, digging our heels into the soft earth in a vain endeavor to gain some advantage of position. My cheek, I knew, was bleeding from contact with a jagged stone, and I was fast growing faint from the awful tension, when I felt his arms slip. \"My God!\" he panted. \"The devil has me!\" So startled was I by these English words, that I loosed my grip, staring breathlessly through the darkness. \"Are you white?\" I gasped, so weakened I could scarce articulate. ? 146 ? For a moment he did not answer, but I could hear his breath coming in gasps and sobs. Then he spoke slowly, his voice hoarse from exertion. \"By the memory of Moses! I was once,—but that squeeze must have turned me black, I\u0027m thinkin\u0027. An\u0027 ye\u0027re no Injun?\" \"Not so much as a feather of one,\" I retorted. \"But that is what I took you to be.\" We were both sitting up by this time, he with his back against the bank, both of us panting as if we could never regain our breath, and eagerly seeking to see each other\u0027s features in the gloom. Any attempt at conversation was painful, but I managed at last to stammer: \"You must be a whalebone man, or I\u0027d have broken every rib in your body.\" \"An\u0027 I\u0027m not a bit sure ye didn\u0027t,\" was the response, uttered between puffs. \"\u0027Twas the worst grip ever Ol\u0027 Tom Burns had squeeze him,—an\u0027 I\u0027ve felt o\u0027 bars mor\u0027 nor oncet. Who may ye be, anyhow, stranger? an\u0027 for what cause did ye jump down yere on me?\" There was a trace of growing anger in his tone, as remembrance of the outrage returned to his mind, which caused me to smile, now that I could breatheless painfully. It seemed such a ludicrous affair,—that dark struggle, each mistaking the purpose and color of the other. ? 147 ? \"My name is Wayland,\" I made haste to explain, \"and I left the Fort but now, hoping by this roundabout route to reach the Kinzie place and return under cover of darkness. I slipped on the edge of the bank up yonder, and the next thing I knew we were at it. I can assure you, friend, I supposed myself in the arms of a savage. You say your name is Burns?\" \"Ol\u0027 Tom Burns.\" \"What? It is not possible you are the same who brought a message to Major Wayland on the Maumee?\" \"I reckon I am,\" he said, deliberately. \"An\u0027 be you the boy I met?\" \"Yes,\" I said, still doubtful. \"But how came you here?\" \"Wal, here\u0027s whar I belong. I\u0027ve bin a sorter huntin\u0027 an\u0027 trappin\u0027 yer\u0027bouts fer goin\u0027 on nine year or so, an\u0027 I built a shanty to live in up yonder by the forks. I hedn\u0027t much more nor got home frum down east, when the Injuns burnt thet down; an\u0027 sence then I ain\u0027t bin much o\u0027 nowhar, but I reckon\u0027d I\u0027d go inter ther Fort to-morrow and git some grub.\" He spoke with a slow, deliberate drawl, as if not much accustomed to converse; and I pictured him to myself as one of those silent plainsmen, so habituated to solitude as almost to shun companionship, though he had already let drop a word or two that made me ? 148 ? deem him one not devoid of humor. Suddenly I thought of De Croix. \"Has any one passed here lately?\" I asked, rising to my feet, the old emulation throbbing in my veins. \"A white man, I mean, going north.\" \"Wal,\" he answered slowly, and as he also stood up I could make out, what I had not noted in our previous meeting, that he was as tall as I, but spare of build; \"I ain\u0027t seen nuthin\u0027, but some sort o\u0027 critter went ploughin\u0027 down inter the gulch up yonder, maybe ten minutes \u0027fore ye lit down yere on me. Dern if I know whether it were a human er a bar!\" \"Will you show me the nearest way to the Kinzie house?\" \"I reckon I\u0027ll show ye all right, but ye bet ye don\u0027t git me nigher ner a hundred foot o\u0027 the door,\" he returned seriously. \"John Kinzie\u0027s a mighty good man, stranger, but he an\u0027 Ol\u0027 Tom Burns ain\u0027t never hitched worth a cent.\" We climbed silently, and came out together upon the top. A slight beam of light crept along through the open door of the log house just in front of us, and for the first time I caught a fair view of my companion. He was a tall, gaunt, wiry fellow, typical in dress and manner of his class, the backwoodsmen of the Southwest, but with a peculiarly solemn face, seamed with wrinkles, and much of it concealed beneath a bushy, iron-gray beard. We eyed each other curiously. ? 149 ? \"Dern if ever I expected ter meet up with ye agin in no sich way as this,\" he said shortly. \"But thet\u0027s the house. Be ye goin\u0027 ter stay thar long?\" \"No,\" I answered, feeling anxious to have his guidance back to the Fort, \"not over five minutes. Will you wait?\" \"Reckon I may as well,\" and he seated himself on a stump. No one greeted me at the house, not even a dog; though I could see figures moving within. Either the occupants felt that an assumption of confidence was their best security, or experienced no fear of Indian treachery, for I rapped twice before there was any response. A young girl, with a face of rare beauty and a pair of roguish black eyes, peered out curiously. At sight of a stranger she drew back slightly, yet paused to ask: \"Did you wish to see some one here?\" \"I am seeking for a young girl,\" I answered, wondering if this could possibly be she, \"and they told me at the Fort I should probably find her here. May I ask if you are Elsa Matherson?\" For a moment she looked out at me, as if I might be an escaped lunatic. Then she turned her face over her shoulder toward those within. \"Mr. Kinzie,\" said she, \"here\u0027s another man looking for Elsa Matherson.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87356.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
