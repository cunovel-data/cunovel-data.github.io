{"id":18764,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI \"FRANCE WINS, MONSIEUR!\"","content":"F OR the moment, every muscle of my body seemed paralyzed. I distinctly heard the creature moving in my direction, and I backed away violently, actuated only by the thought of instant escape into the open air. But Burns blocked the solitary passage. \"Back out of here, for God\u0027s sake!\" I managed to exclaim through parched lips. \"That devil-thing is coming this way!\" He struggled desperately in the darkness, tugging madly at some obstacle, an oath smothered on his lips. I waited and listened, every nerve on edge. \"Dern it all, but I can\u0027t!\" he groaned at last. \"My blame ol\u0027 gun hes got wedged, and won\u0027t give an inch.\" Then a half-smothered laugh rippled out of the gloom just in front of me. ? 162 ? \"Heaven protect me, but it\u0027s Wayland!\" came a voice, and the laughter broke into a roar of merriment. \"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! This will be the death of me!\" The voice, choked and muffled as it was, sounded strangely hollow in that dark cave; yet it had a familiar tone. So surprising was the situation, that I could only stare into the black void, speechless. It was Burns who realized the need of action. \"Whoever the dern fool is,\" he growled, his voice hoarse with anger, \"choke the wind out of him, or his blame howling will bring every Injun on the river yere!\" \"De Croix!\" I exclaimed quickly, aroused to recollection by the seriousness of the situation, \"stop that infernal racket, or the two of us will throttle you!\" He puffed and gurgled, striving his best to smother the sense of ludicrousness that mastered him. To me there was small cause for merriment; the supreme terror of those moments merged into hot anger at the deception, and I crept forward eager to plant my hand upon the rascal\u0027s throat. \"What French mockery is this?\" I exclaimed, my hand hard upon his arm. \"Think you, Captain de Croix, that you can play such tricks in this wilderness, and not be made to pay for them?\" I felt him tremble under my fierce grasp; yet ? 163 ? it was not from fear, for my words only served to loosen his laughter once more. Burns now broke in, shoving the barrel of his long rifle forward over my shoulder till he struck the Frenchman a blow that effectually silenced him. \"You chattering ape!\" he said, growling like an angry bear, \"another yawp like that, and I\u0027ll blow a hole clean through you! Now, you French ninny, tell us what this means, an\u0027 be quick about it if ye want ter save yer hide!\" De Croix did not answer, but he ceased to laugh, and panted as if the breath had been knocked out of him. Another impatient movement by Burns led me to speak up hastily in his defence. \"Wait,\" I said, laying my grasp upon his gun, \"he has no breath left with which to make reply. \u0027Tis the French gallant who raced with me, the same whom you met at Hawkins\u0027s Ford; and no doubt he felt good reason to play the ghost here in this dark pit.\" \"Ay,\" panted De Croix painfully, \"I truly thought the savages were upon me, and sought to frighten them by the only means I could devise. Sacre! but you hit me a sore blow in the ribs! If I have frightened you, \u0027twas no worse than the terror that took me at your entrance here.\" For a time none spoke, and no sound, save De Croix\u0027s labored breathing, broke the silence. Burns had turned slightly, and I knew was listening intently ? 164 ? for any sound without. Apparently satisfied that the noise made by us had not been overheard, he asked in his old deliberate drawl: \"How in thunder, Mister Parly-voo, did ye git up thet thar combination, anyhow?\" I heard the Frenchman chuckle, and pinched him as a warning to be careful. He answered, in his reckless, easy way: \"\u0027Twas all simple enough behind the scenes, Messieurs. I but took some old sacking discovered here, and used it as a robe, standing my hair well on end; and a flash of powder made the scene most realistic. The thing indeed worked well. I would I had a picture of Master Wayland\u0027s face to show Toinette!\" This chance mention of her name recalled me to myself. The undecided wager was yet to be won, and the night was now nearly spent. There came to me a sudden determination to risk a rush through the darkness to the Fort gates, rather than chance any further defeat at the hands of this rash gallant. Yet prudence bade me question somewhat further before I ventured upon so mad a deed. \"No doubt \u0027twas most happy from your point of view, Monsieur. From ours, it was less so; and instead of laughing, you might better be thanking your lucky stars that you did not pay more dearly for such folly. But what brought you here? Why have you failed to reach the stockade?\" ? 165 ? \"Sacre!\" he muttered carelessly, \"but I had a fierce enough run for it as it was. Why did I not reach the stockade? Because, my friend, I am no real ghost to be invisible in the night, nor am I a bird to fly. \u0027Twas in the shadow of that big building yonder that I ran into a nest of those copper-colored fiends, and \u0027twas nip and tuck which of us won, had I not, by pure good luck, chanced to stumble into this hole, and so escape them. Perchance they also thought me a ghost, who knows? But, be that as it may, they were beating the river bank for me in the flesh, when you came creeping here.\" We lay flat on the floor, the three of us, our eyes fastened upon the faint light that began to stream in through the entrance. I could hear Burns muttering to himself, as is often the way with men who lead lives of solitude; and every now and then De Croix would shake silently at the recollection of what had just occurred. I minded neither of them, but chiefly planned how best I might outwit De Croix and win the prize offered by Mademoiselle. The promise of dawning day was in the outer air, too dim as yet to render our faces visible. Suddenly the slight draft of air veered, and swept a tiny breath of smoke into my nostrils. It came so quickly that I scarcely realized its significance until Burns scrambled to his knees with a growl. \"God! the devils have run us to cover!\" he cried, ? 166 ? sullenly. \"They have started a fire to smoke us out!\" It hardly needed a moment to prove this true; the thin smoke grew more and more dense, filling the narrow entrance until we lay gasping for breath. De Croix, ever the most impulsive, was the first to act. \"Parbleu!\" he gasped, pulling himself forward with his hands. \"Better Indians than this foul air! If I die, it shall at least be in the open.\" To remain longer cooped in that foul hole was indeed madness; and as soon as I could I followed him, rolling out of the entrance to the water\u0027s edge, fairly sick with the pressure upon my lungs, and caring so little what the end might be, provided I might first attain one breath of pure air, that before I gained strength to resist I was prisoner to as ill-looking a crew of savages as ever my eyes encountered. The villains triced us firmly with thongs of skin, and sat us up against the bank like so many puppets, dancing about before us, snapping their dirty fingers in our faces, and treating us to all manner of taunts and insults. \u0027Twas done so quickly as to seem a dream, had I not smarted so sorely from the blows dealt me, and my limbs chafed where the tight cords were drawn. I recall glancing aside at Burns; but his seamed and puckered face remained emotionless, as the red devils rolled him over till he stared straight up at the sky, now gray with coming dawn. The sight of De ? 167 ? Croix almost set me laughing, which won for me a kick from the brute who had me in special charge. The Frenchman was surely no court dandy now; his fancy clothing clung to him in rags, while the powder-flash within the cellar had blackened his face and made sad havoc with his gay mustache. He endeavored to smile at me as our eyes met, but the effort produced only what seemed like a demoniac grin. \"\u0027Tis a hard life, Monsieur,\" I could not forbear remarking, \"and will hardly remind you of Versailles.\" His form stiffened in its bonds, as if the words spurred his memory of other days. \"A French soldier smiles at fate, wherever it overtakes him,\" he answered, a touch of pride in his voice. \"Besides, the game is not played out,—I may yet prove the first one in. But see! if I mistake not, here comes the chief of all these devils.\" The new-comer strode down the high bank alone, and was greeted noisily by our captors. It was the same Indian that had halted Captain Wells the day previous; and he looked us over with a contemptuous sneer that curled his lips and transformed the whole expression of his hideously painted face. I noted that he paid but small heed to either De Croix or myself, contenting his vengeance with sharp kicks at our prostrate bodies; but as he came to Burns, he paused, bending down till he could peer into the old borderer\u0027s upturned face. ? 168 ? \"Bah! I know you,\" he said, brokenly. \"You Ol\u0027 Burns. Stake down in village for you.\" The old man neither moved his head nor gave the slightest sign that he had heard. \"Squaw eat heart,\" went on the Indian, prodding him with his stick; \"feed bones to dog. All white men go that way now,—Ol\u0027 Burns first.\" \"Topenebe,\" was the quiet reply, as the victim rolled over until he half-sat against the bank, \"I had the pleasure o\u0027 kickin\u0027 ye once down on the Kankakee, an\u0027 should be mighty glad ter do it agin. I reckon as how ye don\u0027t feel over friendly ter me, but ye\u0027re simply wastin\u0027 yer breath tauntin\u0027 me. Any time yer derned old fire is hot, I\u0027m ready to dance.\" These calm words angered the warrior, and he spat at him; then he turned and grunted an order in his own language. With blows of their sticks the Indians got us on our feet; but when they sought to drive us up the steep bank to the prairie, Ol\u0027 Burns balked and absolutely refused to move. \"Not one dern step, Topenebe,\" he swore grimly, \"with these yere things on my legs. I\u0027m no pony ter be hobbled, an\u0027 blame if I\u0027ll jump \u0027long fer any red skin. Ye kin carry me, if ye ain\u0027t too lazy; but, by thunder! thar\u0027ll be no walkin\u0027 till ye cut them bonds.\" Blows, curses, and threats failed alike to budge the old man. He simply sat down and smiled grimly at them; and we followed his example, dimly perceiving ? 169 ? there must be a purpose in it. Sheer obstinacy wins many a battle, and when we went up the bank our lower limbs were free, although to my mind we were as hopelessly bound as ever. Not so with Burns. I chanced to press close to him, as we came out upon the prairie, and he muttered a quick word into my ear. \"See how they herd us in the shade of the Agency! They are not yet ready to let the sojers know whut they\u0027re re\u0027lly up to. Not an Injun will go beyond thet line long enough to be seen. Be ready to run fer it as soon as I say \u0027Go,\u0027 an\u0027 tell the Frenchman.\" I succeeded in making De Croix understand, by means of the mongrel French at my command, which seemed not to be intelligible to the savages; and we moved forward at as slow a gait as our vigilant guards permitted, with every muscle tense for the coming strain. We were bunched together, with no pretence of order on the part of our captors; indeed, they seemed to be of various minds over what was to be done with us, though Topenebe exercised sufficient control over his mongrel followers to compel at least partial obedience to his orders. We tramped along to the west of the factory, the walls of which shut off all view of the Fort, a half-dozen of the savages about us, while the chief stalked on a few feet in advance. We had almost reached the southwestern corner of the big Agency building, and Topenebe had already taken a step to the right, carefully keeping the log-walls ? 170 ? as a protection between our movements and the eyes of the garrison, when Burns, shaking off the Indians nearest him, bounded suddenly forward and struck Topenebe with his head, hurling the fellow by his side over backward as he passed. \"Run for the gate!\" he yelled. Like an arrow from the bow, I shot around the Agency corner, and raced for the stockade, De Croix, running like a deer, barely a foot behind me. I never dreamed, in that moment of intense action, that Burns was not also coming,—that he had deliberately sacrificed himself in order to hold back the savages and give us the better chance for life. Behind arose the sound of struggle, but there was no indication of pursuit, and as I rounded the end of the stockade the lower gate swung open just before me and I glanced back, half pausing as I realized the old borderer had not followed us; then some one tripped me, and I fell headlong. With a sudden rush, De Croix swept by. \"France wins, Monsieur!\" he cried back in mocking triumph, as I staggered to my knees.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87358.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
