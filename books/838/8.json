{"id":18756,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII TWO MEN AND A MAID","content":"T HE emotion I felt was new and strange to me; for though I had known little of young women, yet as I looked upon her in that dim light of dawn I found myself wondering if I already loved this strange girl. Fair as her face certainly was, its beauty rendered even more striking by the pallor of her late exposure and the blackness of her dishevelled hair, it was her frankness and confidence which most appealed to me. She had held all my thoughts through the long hours of watchfulness as I sat there quietly, feeling the rise and fall of her regular breathing, and thrilled by the unconscious caress of stray tresses as they were blown against my cheek. How she trusted me, stranger though I was! Yet it was through no lack of knowledge of the great world of men, for this young girl had known court gallants and rough soldiery, soft-spoken courtiers and boastful men-at-arms. ? 78 ? So the night through I dreamed of what might be; and when the light finally came slowly reddening the eastern sky, I feasted my eyes unchecked upon that sweet upturned face, and made a rash vow that I would win her heart. I was still mirroring her image in my memory, forgetful of all else,—the broad white brow, the long dark lashes resting in such delicate tracery against the smooth velvet of the cheek now slightly flushed, the witching pink of the ear, the softly parted lips between which gleamed the small and regular teeth of ivory, the round white throat swelling ever so slightly to her breathing, when a sudden shout of surprised recognition aroused me from my reverie, and I looked up to see Jordan topping the sand-bank in our front, and waving his hand to some one beneath him and out of sight. \"See here, De Croix!\" he cried, excitedly, \"the prodigal has had good cause to lag behind. He has found the lost fairy of this wilderness.\" Before I could relieve myself of my burden,—for the mockery of his words angered me,—the French man appeared at his side, and glanced down where his companion\u0027s finger pointed. For a moment he gazed; then he murmured a sharp French oath, and strode heavily down the sand-bank. There was a look in his face that caused me to lay the girl\u0027s head back upon the sand and rise hastily. The sudden movement ? 79 ? awoke her, and her dark eyes looked up in startled confusion. By this time I had taken a quick step forward, and faced De Croix. \"This lady is under my protection,\" I said, a bit hotly, not relishing the manner of his approach, \"and any disrespect from either of you will be unwarranted.\" He paused, evidently surprised at my bold front, and his lip curled contemptuously. \"Ah, my young game-cock!\" he ejaculated, surveying me curiously. \"So you have spurs, and think you can use them? Well, I have no quarrel with you, but perchance I may have more reason to be the protector of this young lady than you suppose. Stand aside, Monsieur.\" She had risen from the sand, and now stood erect beside me. I saw Jordan grinning in great enjoyment of the scene, and that De Croix\u0027s eyes were full of anger; but I would not stir. In my heart I felt a dull pain at his words, a fear that they might prove too true; but I remained where I was, determined to take no step aside until she herself should judge between us. \"Will you stand back, Monsieur?\" he said, haughtily, dropping his hand upon the hilt of his rapier, \"or shall I show you how a gentleman of France deals with such impertinence?\" If he thought to affright me with his bravado, he reckoned ill of my nature, for I have ever driven badly; ? 80 ? my blood seems slow to heat, though it was warm enough now. \"If the lady wishes it, you may pass,\" I answered shortly, my eyes never leaving his face. \"Otherwise, if you take so much as another step I will crush every bone in your body.\" He saw I meant it, but there was no cowardice in him; and the steel had already flashed in the sunlight to make good his threat, when she touched me gently upon the shoulder. \"I beg you do not fight,\" she urged. \"I am not worthy, and \u0027tis all unneeded. Captain de Croix,\" and she swept him a curtsey which had the grace of a drawing-room in it, \"\u0027tis indeed most strange that we should meet again in such a spot as this. No contrast could be greater than the memory of our last parting. Yet is there any cause for quarrel because this young gentleman has preserved my life?\" De Croix hesitated, standing half-poised for attack, even his glib tongue and ready wit failing as she thus calmly questioned him. Indeed, as I later learned, there was that of witchery about this young girl which held him at bay more effectually than if she had been a princess of the royal blood,—a something that laughed his studied art to scorn. She noted now his hesitancy, and smiled slightly at the evidence of her power. \"Well, Monsieur, \u0027tis not often that your lips ? 81 ? fail of words,\" she continued, archly. \"Why is it I am made the subject of your quarrel?\" The slight sarcastic sting in her voice aroused him. \"By all the saints, Toinette!\" he exclaimed, striving to appear at his ease, \"this seems a poor greeting for one who has followed you through leagues of forest and across oceans of sand, hopeful at the least to gain a smile of welcome from your lips. Know you not I am here, at the very end of the world, for you?\" \"I think it not altogether unlikely,\" she replied with calmness. \"You have ever been of a nature to do strange things, yet it has always been of your own sweet will. Surely, Monsieur, I did never bid you come, or promise you a greeting.\" \"No,\" he admitted regretfully, \"\u0027tis, alas, true\"; and his eyes seemed to regain something of their old audacity. \"But there was that about our parting,—you recall it, Toinette, in the shadow of the castle wall?—which did afford me hope. No one so fair as you can be without heart.\" She laughed softly, as though his words recalled memories of other days, pressing back her hair within its ribbon. \"Such art of compliment seems more in place at Montreal than here. This is a land of deeds, not words, Monsieur. Yet, even though I confess your conclusion partially true, what cause does it yield ? 82 ? why you should seek a quarrel with my good friend, John Wayland?\" \"You know him, then?\" he asked, in quick astonishment. \"Know him! Do you think I should be here otherwise? Fie, Captain de Croix, that you, the very flower of the French court, should express so poor a thought of one you profess to respect so highly!\" He looked from one to the other of us, scarce knowing whether she were laughing at him or not. \"Sacre!\" he exclaimed at last. \"I believe it not, Mademoiselle. The boy would have boasted of such an acquaintance long before this. You know him, you say, for how long?\" \"Since yester even, if you must know. But he has a face, Monsieur, a face frank and honest, not like that of a man long trained at courts to deceive. \u0027Tis for that I trust him, and have called him friend.\" \"You may rue the day.\" \"No, Captain de Croix,\" she exclaimed, proudly. \"I know the frontiersmen of my father\u0027s blood. They are brave men, and true of heart. This John Wayland is of that race.\" And she rested one hand lightly upon my arm. The motion, simple as it was, angered him. \"You ask why I sought quarrel,\" he said sternly. \"\u0027Twas because I suspected this uncouth hunter had wronged you. Now I understand \u0027twas of your own ? 83 ? choice. I wish you joy, Mademoiselle, of your new conquest.\" I felt the girl\u0027s slight form straighten, and saw his bold eyes sink beneath the flame of her look. \"Captain de Croix,\" and every sentence stung like the lash of a whip, \"those are cowardly words, unworthy a French gentleman and soldier. Did you leave all your courtesy behind in Montreal, or dream that in this wilderness I should cringe to any words you might speak? You wish the truth; you shall have it. Three days ago, through an accident, I drifted, in an oarless boat, out from the river-mouth at Fort Dearborn to the open lake. None knew of my predicament. A storm blew me helpless to the southward, and after hours of exposure to danger, and great mental anguish, I was driven ashore amid the desolation of this sand. This comrade of yours found me scarce alive, ministered to my sore need, protected me through the hours of the night, stood but now between me and your ribaldry, counting his life but little beside the reputation of a woman. He may not wear the latest Paris fashions, Monsieur, but he has proved himself a man.\" \"I meant not all I said, Toinette,\" he hastened to explain. \"You will forgive, I know, for I was sorely hurt to find that some one else had done the duty that was plainly mine. Surely no rude backwoodsman is to come between us now?\" ? 84 ? She glanced from the one to the other, with true French coquetry. \"Faith, I cannot tell, Monsieur,\" she said, gayly; \"stranger things have happened, and \u0027tis not altogether fine clothes that win the hearts of maidens on this far frontier. We learn soon to love strength, and the manly traits of the border. On my word, Monsieur, this John Wayland seems to have rare powers of body; I imagine he might even have crushed you, as he said.\" \"Think you so?\" he asked, eying me curiously. \"Yet \u0027tis not always as it looks, Mademoiselle.\" It came so quickly as to startle me. I was wondering at the smile that curled his lips, when he sprang upon me, casting his arms around my waist, and twining one leg about mine. The shock of this sudden and unexpected onset took me completely by surprise, and I gave back sharply, scarce realizing his purpose, till he had the under-hold, and sought to lift me for a throw. \u0027Twas my weight alone that saved me, together with the rare good fortune that I had been leaning upon my gun. As the breath came back to me, we locked grimly in a fierce struggle for the mastery. I had felt the straining grip of strong arms before, but De Croix surprised me, he was like steel, quick of motion as a wild-cat, with many a cunning French wrestling trick that tried me sorely. I heard a quick exclamation ? 85 ? of surprise from the girl, a shout of delighted approval from Jordan, and then there was no sound but the harsh trampling of our feet and the heavy breathing. De Croix\u0027s effort was to lift me to his hip for a throw; mine, to press him backward by bodily strength. Both of us were sadly hindered by the sliding sand on which we strove. Twice I thought I had him, when my footing failed; and once he held me fairly uplifted from the ground, yet could not make the toss. \u0027Twas a wild grapple, for when we had exhausted all the tricks we knew, it came to be a sheer test of physical endurance. Then, for the first time, I felt myself the master,—though he was a man, that gay French dandy, and never did my ribs crack under the pressure of a stronger hand. But I slowly pressed him back, inch by inch, struggling like a demon to the last, until I forced his shoulders to the sand. For a moment he lay there, panting heavily; then the old frank and easy smile came upon his lips. \"Your hand, monsieur,\" he said; \"that is, if it yet retains sufficient strength to lift me.\" Upon his feet he brushed the sand from out his long hair, and bowed gallantly. \"I have done my very best, Mademoiselle, \u0027Tis defeat, but not disgrace, for I have made your giant puff to win. May I not hope it has won me restoration to your good graces?\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87350.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
