{"id":18779,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI A SEARCH, AND ITS REWARD","content":"I SLEPT at last, soundly, for several hours, lying well hidden behind the skins at the back of the lodge. There seemed nothing else to do; for poor De Croix had no thought other than that of the woman who had just left us, and I was exhausted by hours of excitement and toil. He was asleep when I awoke, lying just as I had left him, his face still buried in the short trodden grass that carpeted the floor. It was so quiet without that I listened in vain for a sound to indicate the presence of Indians. Silence so profound was in strange contrast with the hideous uproar of the preceding night, and curiosity led me finally to project my head from beneath the lodge covering and gain a cautious glimpse of the camp with out. The yellow sunshine of the calm summer afternoon ? 326 ? rested hot and glaring on the draped skins of the tepees, and on the brown prairie-grass, trampled by hundreds of passing feet. I could perceive a few squaws working lazily in the shade of the trees near the bank of the river; but no other moving figures were visible. Several recumbent forms were within my sight, their faces toward the sun, evidently sleeping off the heavy potations of the night. Otherwise the great encampment appeared completely deserted; there were no spirals of smoke rising above the lodge-poles, no gossiping groups anywhere about. It was plain enough to me. Those of the warriors capable of further action were elsewhere engaged upon some fresh foray, while the majority, overcome by drinking, were asleep within their darkened lodges. Surely, daylight though it was, no safer moment could be expected in which to establish communication with Toinette. With night the camp would be again astir; and even if I succeeded in reaching her at some later hour it would leave small margin of darkness for our escape. Every moment of delay now added to our grave peril, and there was much planning to be done after we met. Possibly I should have waited, as I had been told to do; but it was ever in my blood to act rather than reason, and I am sure that in this case no cause remains for regret. I must confess that my heart beat somewhat faster, as I crept slowly forth and peered cautiously ? 327 ? around the bulging side of the big lodge I had just left, to assure myself no savages were stirring. It was not that I greatly feared the venture, nor that a sense of danger excited my nerves; but rather the one thought in my mind was that now my way lay toward Mademoiselle. How would she greet me? Should I learn my fate from her tell-tale eyes, or by a sudden gleam of surprise in her lovely face? These were the reflections that inspired me, for a new hope had been born within me through the forced confession of De Croix. There was little danger of exposure while I advanced through the shelter of the lodges, for I was always under partial cover. But I waited and watched long before daring to pass across the wide open space in the centre of which the fire had been kindled. The torture-post yet stood there, black and charred, while the ground beneath was littered with dead ashes. The bodies of three white men, two of them naked and marked by fire, lay close at hand, just as they had been carelessly flung aside to make room for new victims; yet I dared not stop to learn who they might have been in life. The sight of their foul disfigurement only rendered me the more eager to reach the living with a message of hope. I moved like a snake, dragging my body an inch at a time by firmly grasping with extended hands the tough grass-roots, and writhing forward as noiselessly ? 328 ? as if I were stalking some prey. There were times when I advanced so slowly it would have puzzled a watcher to determine whether mine was not also the body of the dead. At length, even at that snail\u0027s rate of progress, I gained the protection of the tepees upon the other side of the camp, and skulked in among them. The lodge just before me, blackened by paint and weather, must be the one I sought. I rested close within its shadow, striving to assure myself there was no possibility of mistake. As my eyes lifted, I could trace in dim outline the totem of the chief faintly sketched on the taut skin: it was the same I had noted on the brawny breast of Little Sauk. Never did I move with greater woodland skill, for I felt that all depended upon my remaining undiscovered; a single false move now would defeat all hope. Who might be within, concealed by that black covering, was a mystery to be solved only by extremest caution. Inch by inch I worked the skin-covering of the tepee entrance up from the ground, screwing my eye to the aperture in an effort to penetrate the shrouded interior. But the glare of the sun was so reflected into my eyeballs, that it left me almost blind in the semi-gloom beneath that dark roof, and I could distinguish no object with certainty. Surely, nothing moved within; and I drew myself slowly forward, until half my body lay extended upon the beaten dirt-floor. It was ? 329 ? then that I caught a glimpse of a face peering at me from out the shadows,—the face of Toinette; and, alas for my eager hopes of surprising her heart and solving its secrets! the witch was actually laughing in silence at my predicament. The sight made my face flush in sudden indignation; but before I could find speech, she had hastily accosted me. \"Good faith, Master Wayland! but I greet you gladly!\" she said, and her soft hand was warm upon mine; \"yet it truly caused me to smile to observe the marvellous caution with which you came hither.\" \"It must have been indeed amusing,\" I answered, losing all my vain aspirations in a moment under her raillery; \"though it is not every prisoner in an Indian camp who could find like cause for merriment.\" Her eyes grew sober enough as they rested inquiringly on my face, for all that they still held an irritatingly roguish twinkle in their depths. \"It was the expression upon your face which so amused me,\" she explained. \"I am not indifferent to all that your coming means, nor to the horrors this camp has witnessed. More than that, you appear to me like one risen from the dead. I have truly mourned for you, John Wayland. I lost all power, all desire for resistance, when I saw you stricken from your horse, and often since my eyes have been moist in thoughts of you. No doubt \u0027twas but the sudden reaction from seeing you again alive that made me so forgetful of ? 330 ? these dread surroundings as to smile. I beg you to forgive me; it was not heartlessness, but merely the way of a thoughtless girl, Monsieur.\" It had been impossible for me to resist her cajolery from the beginning; and now I read in her eyes the truth of all she spoke. \"There is naught for you to forgive, Mademoiselle,\" I answered, drawing myself wholly within the tepee and resting on my knees. \"But are you quite alone here, and without guards?\" \"For the present, yes. Little Sauk has been gone from the camp for some hours. They watch me with some care at night, yet of what use can their guarding be? If I should get without the lodge, escape would be hopeless for a girl like me. But now tell me about yourself. Are you also prisoner to the Indians? Surely I saw you struck down in that mad mêlée. \u0027Twas then I lost heart, and gave up every hope of rescue.\" \"No, I am not a prisoner, Mademoiselle. I fell, stunned by a blow dealt me from behind, but was saved from capture by the falling of my horse across my body. I am here now of my own will, and for no other purpose than to save you.\" \"To save me! Oh, Monsieur! it would make me blush really to think I ranked so high in your esteem. Was it not rather that other girl you came to seek,—the one you sought so far through the wilderness, ? 331 ? only to find hidden in this encampment of savages? Tell me, Monsieur, was she by any chance of fate the heroine who last night plucked Captain de Croix from the flames of torture?\" \"You know, then, of his danger and deliverance?\" I said, not feeling eager to answer her query. \"\u0027Twas a most brave and womanly act.\" \"A strange exercise of power, indeed, Monsieur,\" and she looked directly into my eyes; \"and the savages tell me she claimed to have knowledge of him.\" Surely I had a right to relate the whole story of De Croix\u0027s confession; yet somehow I did not deem it the manly thing to do. Rather, I would let her learn the truth in God\u0027s own time, and from other lips than mine. Perchance she would respect me more in the end for keeping silence now. But in this decision I failed to consider that hasty words of explanation might naturally lead her to believe the existing friendship mine instead of his. \"We met her across the river in the darkness last night,\" I answered. \"At my request, she acted as my guide into the Indian camp.\" The expression in her eyes puzzled me; nor could I interpret the sudden flush that lent color to her cheeks. \"You are frank, Monsieur,\" she said quietly, \"and doubtless \u0027tis better so. But the strange situation of this young woman has much of romance about it, and ? 332 ? interests me greatly. How chances she to be here? Surely she cannot be of Indian blood?\" \"She holds connection with some sisterhood of the Church, as I understand, and has lived for some time amid the Pottawattomies, seeking to win the heathen to Christ.\" \"A Catholic?\" she asked, her eyes brightening with deeper interest. \"Such is my understanding, though in truth she never said as much to me. Indeed, we spoke little, Mademoiselle, for our path was in the midst of peril, even before the capture of poor De Croix upset all our plans.\" \"Doubtless,\" she answered with a slight trace of sarcasm in the soft voice. \"But Captain de Croix,—he was not seriously injured, I trust? Where have the savages confined him? And know you what they in tend as to his future?\" \"He will forever bear some scars, I fear,\" I answered, wondering dully at the calmness of her inquiry. \"I have just left him sleeping quietly in the council tent. Know you anything of what fate has befallen other of our friends of the garrison?\" Her eyes grew sad. \"Only what little I have learned through the taunting of my own captor,\" she answered, her voice trembling. \"Captain Wells is dead, together with Ensign Ronan and Surgeon Van Voorhees. Both Captain Heald and his wife were ? 333 ? sorely wounded, and they, with Lieutenant Helm, are prisoners somewhere in the camp; but the Lieutenant\u0027s wife is safe with the Silver-man\u0027s family across the river. The Indians hold these in hope of ransom, and wreak their vengeance upon the common soldiers who were so unfortunate as to fall into their hands alive. Yet few, I think, survived the massacre.\" \"You have doubtless guessed aright. I noted with what fearful spirit of revenge the savages dealt with some of their captives, while sparing others. Surely you, for instance, have met with but little hardship thus far at the hands of Little Sauk?\" She glanced up at me, with a touch of the old coquettishness in her dark eyes and a quick toss of her head, while one white hand smoothed her soft hair. \"Think you then, Monsieur, I do not look so ill?\" In spite of every effort at control, my heart swept into my eyes; she must have read the swift message, for her own drooped instantly, with a quick flutter of long lashes against her cheeks. \"I have already told you how greatly I admire you,\" I faltered, \"and you make no less fair a picture now.\" \"Then I shall not tempt you to add to your compliment,\" she hastily responded, rising to her feet, \"for I like loyalty in a man better than mere gallantry of speech. You ask me about Little Sauk. He holds me for ransom, although Heaven knows \u0027twill prove ? 334 ? but waste of time, for I am aware of no one in all the East who would invest so much as a dollar to redeem me from Indian hands. Yet such is his purpose, as told to me this morning.\" \"Perchance, then,\" I urged, doubtfully, \"you may prefer remaining quietly here rather than risk the peril of trying to escape?\" She looked at me keenly, as if in wonder at my words; and I could see that her eyes were moistening with the sudden rush of feeling. \"You are either dull of comprehension, John Wayland,\" she said, a bit pertly, \"or else you understand me less than any man I ever knew. If I seem brave and light of heart amidst all this horror, \u0027tis merely that I may not utterly break down, and become an object of contempt. I feel, Monsieur, I am not devoid of heart nor of the finer qualities of womanhood. Prefer to remain here? Holy Mother of Christ! It would be my choice to die out yonder on the prairie, rather than stay here in these Indian lodges. There is no peril I would not face joyfully, in an effort to escape from this place of torture and barbarity. I confess that an hour ago I cared not greatly what my end might be; I had lost heart and hope. But now your coming, as of one risen from the dead, has brought back my courage.\" \"You will go, then, whenever and wherever I say?\" ? 335 ? She stepped forward with her old frank confidence, resting both hands in mine, her eyes upon my face. \"Out yonder in the night, and amid the sand, John Wayland,\" she said earnestly, \"I remember saying I would travel with you whithersoever you wished. I know you far better now than I did then, and I hesitate not at taking upon myself the same vow.\" What power then sealed my lips, I know not. Doubtless there is a fate in such matters, yet \u0027tis strange the light of invitation in her eyes did not draw me to lay bare my heart. In naught else had I a drop of coward blood within my veins; while here I hesitated, fearful lest her pleading face might change to sudden roguishness, and she laugh lightly at the love that held my heart in thrall. Truly, the witch had puzzled me so sorely with her caprices, her quick change of mood, her odd mixture of girlish frankness and womanly reserve, that I knew not which might prove the real Toinette,—the one to trust, or the one to doubt. So I stood there, clasping her soft hands in mine, my heart throbbing, yet my tongue hesitating to perform its office. But at last the halting words came in a sudden, irrepressible rush. \"Toinette!\" I cried, \"Toinette! I could forget all else,—our danger here, the horrors of the night just passed, the many dead out yonder,—all else but you.\" ? 336 ? She gave a sudden startled cry, her affrighted eyes gazing across my shoulder. I wheeled, with quick intuition of danger; and there, just within the entrance of the tepee, the flap of which he had let fall behind him, in grave silence stood an Indian.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87373.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
