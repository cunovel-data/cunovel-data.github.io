{"id":18771,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII THE DEATH-SHADOW OF THE MIAMIS","content":"I T was after midnight when I finally ceased my labors, feeling I had performed my fair share of the hard work of preparation. By this time everything was comparatively quiet within the stockade enclosure; the wagons were piled with all that could be loaded before morning, and many of the wearied soldiers had flung themselves upon the ground to snatch what rest they might before the early call to march. The women and children had disappeared, to seek such comfort as was possible amid the ruins of their former quarters; and only the sentries remained alert, pacing their solemn rounds on the narrow walk overlooking the palisades and the silent plain without. Physically wearied as I was, my mind remained intensely active, and I felt no desire for sleep. I do not ? 237 ? recall that I gave much thought to the perils of our situation. One grows careless and indifferent to danger,—and in truth I looked forward to no serious trouble with the Indians upon the morrow\u0027s march through the sand-dunes; not that I greatly trusted to those reluctant pledges wrung from the chiefs, but because I felt that if properly handled in that open country our force was of sufficient fighting strength to repel any ordinary attack from ill-armed savages, my long border experience rendering me a bit disdainful of Indian courage and resourcefulness. So it was that my restless mind dwelt rather upon other matters more directly personal. I could not put away the thought of the half-seen girl flitting about amid the dusk of the Pottawattomie camp, especially as Captain Heald had declared her to be Elsa Matherson. I was surprised to discover that she I sought, instead of being a mere child, was a woman grown; for in this we were all deceived by the words of her father. What did she there, passing with such apparent freedom from restraint among those fierce warriors? and how was I ever to reach her with any hope of rescue, even if she desired it? There was evidently a mystery here which I could never solve through idle musing; and yet I could but ask myself where lay my graver duty,—beside this single woman, who seemingly needed no defender, or with the many helpless ones who must march forth on the morrow on that long and ? 238 ? dangerous passage through the wilderness? Indeed, what hope could I cherish of aiding the young girl, if I now deserted these others, and endeavored alone to penetrate that Indian camp in search of her? Then came another thought. It was of Mademoiselle. It was this that effectually halted me. To whomsoever else she might have given her heart, she was still the one for whom I was most glad either to live or die; and in spite of De Croix, I would ride at her side on the morrow, within striking distance of any prowling hostile. Let the Matherson girl wait; my arm belonged first of all to the defence of Mademoiselle. Busied with these thoughts, and endeavoring to adjust this decision with my conscience, I passed out upon the platform, that I might look forth once more upon the moonlit waters of the lake. There were a few dim figures to be seen, leaning over the logs; but I supposed them to be members of the night-guard, and, feeling no desire for companionship, I halted in a lonely spot at the northeastern corner of the stockade. How desolate, how solemnly impressive, was the scene! To the north all was black in the dense night, the shadows of the scattering trees obscuring the faint glow of the moon and yielding little of detail to the searching eye. Even the single ray of light which the evening previous had blazed forth as a friendly beacon ? 239 ? from the Kinzie home, was now absent. I could vaguely distinguish the dim outlines of the deserted house in the distance, and noticed a large boat moored close to the bank beneath the Fort stockade, doubtless the one in which the fugitives expected to venture out upon the lake on the morrow. It was the wide stretch of water, gleaming like silver, that fascinated me, as it always did in its numberless changing moods. What unutterable loneliness spoke to the soul in those unknown leagues of tossing sea! how far the eye wandered unchecked, searching vainly for aught to rest upon other than glistening surge or darkling hollow! The mystery of the ages lay unexpressed in those tossing billows, sweeping in out of the black east, making low moan to the unsympathetic and unheeding sky. Deeper and deeper the spirit of unrest, of doubt, of brooding discontent, weighed down upon me as I gazed; life seemed as aimless as that constant turmoil yonder, a mere silver-tinted heaving, destined to burst in useless power on a shore of rock, and then roll back again into the mighty deep. I leaned over the palisades, sunk deep in revery of home, recalling one by one the strange incidents of the last month that had so curiously conspired to cause a total upheaval of my life; and for the moment I grew oblivious of my surroundings. A mere lad, knowing little of himself and less of life, had ridden ? 240 ? westward from the Maumee; a man, in thought and character, leaned now over that beleaguered stockade of Dearborn. I was recalled to actualities by a light touch on the sleeve of my shirt, and a half-laughing, half-petulant voice at my elbow. \"Well, Master Laggard! do I not show you great honor in thus seeking you out, after your avoidance of me all these hours?\" I glanced aside into the fair face and questioning eyes, noting at the same time that De Croix stood only a step beyond her in the shadows. \"I have been very busy, Mademoiselle,\" I tried to explain; \"it has been a time when every strong hand was needed.\" \"Fudge!\" was the indignant rejoinder. \"Did I not perceive you loitering more than once to-night,—though each time I drew near, hopeful of a word of greeting, it was to behold you disappear as if by magic? Do I flatter you by thus showing my interest? Yet \u0027twas only that I might have explanation, that I sought you thus. Come, confess that you feared my just resentment for going forth on so perilous a trip without telling me of your plans.\" \"\u0027Twas not altogether that,\" I answered, for dissembling was never an easy task for me, \"as I only did what I believed would most please you. Nor have I anything to regret in my action, now that we have ? 241 ? thus gained the pledge of the Pottawattomies for protection upon the march.\" She watched me closely as I spoke, and I wondered if she realized ever so dimly the impulse of loving service that had inspired my deed. Whether \u0027twas so or not, her whole mood quickly changed. \"I must admit you are a constant puzzle to me, John Wayland, yet rather an interesting one withal. For instance, here is Josette, who did assure me but an hour ago that your very name was unknown to her, although, if memory serves, you asserted only yesterday that you were seeking her from the Maumee country. Perhaps, sir, you can explain the contradiction?\" \"It was not altogether as you have stated it, Mademoiselle,\" I stammered, confused by the directness of her attack. \"I said nothing of knowing this Josette, and you have deceived yourself in the matter. I came here seeking a young girl, \u0027tis true, but found no trace of her until a few hours ago, most curiously, in the heart of that Indian camp yonder.\" \"You found her there? How strange!\" \"Most strange indeed, Mademoiselle, especially as she appeared to enjoy perfect liberty among the savages.\" \"You spoke with her?\" \"Not a word; it was only a glimpse I caught of her in the firelight, and when I sought to go to her ? 242 ? the warriors interfered and forced me back. But Captain Heald, who saw her at the same time, assured me \u0027twas the one I sought.\" \"\u0027Tis small wonder, then, you could stand here at my very side so long, and yet see me not, or remain indifferent to my presence,\" she said, drawing slightly back. \"Come, Captain de Croix, let us walk to the other corner of the stockade, and leave Master Wayland to dream of his mysterious beauty undisturbed.\" \"You misapprehend me,\" I cried, awakened by her words, but more by De Croix\u0027s smile. \"She has no such hold upon my memory as that, for until to-night I had supposed her a mere child. I knew not you were upon the platform, believing the forms I saw in the gloom to be those of the night-guard. What dark figure is that, even now leaning over the logs yonder?\" It was De Croix\u0027s deeper voice that made answer. \"\u0027Tis Captain Wells; and we found him in no mood for conversation. Seemingly he hath small faith in the pledges of the chiefs.\" \"My own hope rests far more upon our skill at arms, Monsieur,\" I answered directly; \"for I have known Indian treachery all my life. They may keep faith with us to-morrow, for John Kinzie has great influence with them for good; nevertheless, I shall oil my gun carefully before riding forth.\" It was in his eyes to make reply; but before ? 243 ? it could come the girl between us uttered a cry so piercing that it set us gazing where her finger pointed out across the lake. \"Look there, Messieurs! Did ever mortal behold so grewsome a sight before? What means the portent?\" It is before me now, in each grim, uncanny detail,—though I know well that my pen will fail to give it fit description, or convey even feebly a sense of the overwhelming dread of what we saw. Nature has power to paint what human hand may never hope to copy; and though, as I now know well, it was no more than a strange commingling of cloud and moon in atmospheric illusion, still the effect was awe-inspiring to a degree difficult of realization within the environments of peace and safety. To us, it appeared as a dreadful warning,—a mysterious manifestation of supernatural power, chilling our blood with terror and striking agony into our souls. Up from the far east had rolled an immense black cloud, rifted here and there by bars of vivid yellow as electric bolts tore it asunder. Moonlight tipped its heavy edges with a pale spectral gleam; and as it swiftly rose higher and higher into the sky, blotting out the stars, it seemed to dominate the entire expanse, hovering over us menacingly, and assuming the shape of some gigantic monster, with leering face and cruel mouth, bending forward as if to smite us with huge uplifted hand. ? 244 ? Perchance our tensioned nerves may have exaggerated the resemblance, but nothing more horribly real have my eyes ever beheld. For a moment I cowered, like a nerveless craven, behind the logs, gazing up at that awful apparition, that mocking devil\u0027s-face, as a man fronts death in some terrible and unexpected form. It seemed as if the breath of the creature must be pestilence, and that it would smite us gasping to earth, or draw us helplessly struggling within its merciless clutch. A prayer trembled on my lips, but remained unuttered, for I could only stare upward at the mighty, crawling thing now overshadowing us, my arms uplifted in impotent effort to avert the crushing blow. I could hear the girl sob where she had sunk upon the platform, and caught one glimpse of De Croix, his face yellow in the weird glare as he stared in speechless terror out over the water, his hands clutching the palisades. It was Captain Wells, who had been standing near us, who first found voice. \"Tis the Death-Shadow of the Miamis!\" he cried, in choked accents, striding toward us along the narrow plank, and pointing eastward. \"I knew it must come, for our doom is sealed.\" What centuries of Indian superstition rested behind the fateful utterance, I know not; but facing that horrible spectre as we did, his words held me in speechless awe. In the blood of us all such terrors ? 245 ? linger to unman the bravest; and for the moment such fright and panic swept me as I have never known before or since. I, who have laughed at death even in the hour of torture, sank in deadly agony before that mystery of light and shadow, as if it indeed foreshadowed the wrath of the Great Spirit. The sobs of Mademoiselle recalled me somewhat to myself, and led me to forget my own terror that I might help to relieve hers. \"I beg you, fear not,\" I urged, though my voice trembled and my lips were dry. \"Come, Mademoiselle,\" and I found her hand and clasped it, feeling the touch a positive relief to my unstrung nerves, \"look up and see! the cloud is even now breaking asunder, and has already lost much of its form of terror. Mind not the words of Captain Wells; he has been raised among the Indians, and drunk in their superstitions. De Croix, arouse yourself, and help me to bring courage to this girl.\" He drew back from his grip on the palisades, as if, by sheer power of will, he forced his fascinated eyes from the cloud-bank, shivering like a man with an ague fit. \"Sacre! did ever human eyes behold so foul a thing!\" he cried, his voice shaking, his hand shading his face. \"\u0027Twill haunt me till the hour I die.\" \"Bah! \u0027Twill all be forgotten with return of daylight,\" I was quick to reply; for had found relief ? 246 ? in action, and could perceive already that the clouds were becoming shapeless and drifting rapidly southward in a great billowy mass. \"Do not stand there moping like a day-blind owl, but aid me to make Mademoiselle see the foolishness of her fears.\" The sting of these words moved him more than a blow would have done; but as he knelt beside her, I noted there was little of the old reckless ring in his voice. \"\u0027Tis indeed true, Toinette,—\u0027twas but a cloud, and has already greatly changed in aspect. \u0027Twill be no more than cause for laughter when the sun gilds the plain, and will form a rare tale to tell to the gallants at Montreal. Yet, Saint Guise! \u0027twas grewsome enough, and my knees quake still from the terror of the thing.\" Mademoiselle was as brave and cool-headed a girl as ever I knew; but so thoroughly had she been unnerved by this dreadful happening, that it was only after the most persistent urging on our part that she consented to be led below. There, at the foot of the ladder, I stepped aside to permit De Croix to walk with her across the parade; but she would not go without a word of parting. \"Do not think me weak and silly,\" she implored, her face, still white from the terror, upturned to me in the moonlight. \"It was so spectral and ghastly that I gave way to sudden fear.\" ? 247 ? \"You need no excuse,\" I hastened to assure her. \"When the thing frightened De Croix and me, and even set so old a soldier as Captain Wells to raving, it was no wonder it unnerved a girl, however brave she might prove in the presence of real danger. But you can sleep now, convinced it was naught but a floating cloud.\" She smiled at me over her shoulder, and I watched the pair with jealous eyes until they disappeared. I noticed Captain Wells standing beside me. \"You thought I raved up yonder,\" he said gravely; \"to-morrow will prove that my interpretation of the vision was correct.\" \"You believe it a prophecy of evil?\" \"It was the warning of the Great Spirit—the Death-Shadow of the Miamis. Never has it appeared to men of our tribe except on the eve of great disaster, the forerunner of grave tragedy. We ride forth from these gates to death.\" It was plain that no amount of reasoning could change his Indian superstition; and with a word more of expostulation I left him standing there, and sought a place where I might lie down. Already the numbing sensation of supernatural fear had left me, for in the breaking up of that odd-formed cloud I realized its cause; and now the physical fatigue I felt overmastered all else. I found a quiet corner, and, with a saddle for a pillow, was soon fast asleep. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87365.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
