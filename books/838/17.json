{"id":18765,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII A CONTEST OF WITS","content":"T HOUGH I was never of hasty or violent temper, it was quite as well that I failed to gain a sight of De Croix as I passed the posts and the sentry clanged the gate behind me. The Frenchman\u0027s scurvy trick would have heated cooler blood than mine; nor was my spirit soothed by the harsh fall I suffered. But De Croix had not waited; nowhere along the bare sunlit parade was he visible. I saw nothing but a squad of grinning soldiers lounging beside the barracks, until Captain Wells, issuing from the guard-house door, caught sight of me and came forward. \"Back, are you, Master Wayland?\" he said gruffly, and \u0027twas easy to see he did not approve of my escapade. \"I scarcely thought to see you here again with so full a head of hair, after I learned of ? 172 ? your mad wager. Providence must indeed take special care of fools. Have the redskins captured our French friend?\" \"He entered a step in my advance.\" A gleam of amusement played over his swarthy face. \"Ah, and so you let him win!\" he exclaimed; \"he, a mere voyager from the courts, unused to forest play! Such remissness deserves the guard-house, at the very least. Come, how happened it that this gay sprig outfooted you?\" \"\u0027Twas but a trick,\" I retorted, aroused by these contemptuous words, \"and one I shall make him pay well for. But I pray you cut these bands and set me free.\" I think he had not noticed them before; but now, as he quickly drew his knife across the deer-skin thongs, his whole expression changed. \"\u0027Tis Indian tying,\" he said earnestly; \"you have been in the hands of the savages?\" \"Ay!\" and the memory of it instantly brought back the recollection of the sacrifice that had won us our freedom. \"There were three of us taken at daylight on the river bank, beyond the factory building. De Croix and I escaped through the efforts of one who is still a prisoner, and marked for torture.\" Many were gathering about us by this time, anxious to learn whatever news I brought from without; ? 173 ? but it was Captain Heald himself who now pushed his way through the throng until he fronted me. \"Who was it?\" he asked, sharply. \"We have lost no men!\" \"His name is Burns, sir. I ran across him just back of the Kinzie house.\" \"Burns? Ol\u0027 Tom Burns?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Heald laughed, a look of evident relief on his haggard features. \"We shall not have to worry much as to his fate,\" he said, turning toward Wells. \"You remember the fellow, William? He was one of Mad Anthony\u0027s scouts, and came west with you in 1803 when you first held council here.\" The other nodded, a twinkle of pleasant recollection in his eyes. \"Remember him?\" he repeated. \"I am not likely ever to forget him. He it was who brought me your message at Fort Wayne a month ago. My sympathies in this case are entirely with the Indians. There are likely to be things happening when Ol\u0027 Tom is around, unless he has lost his versatility and nerve in recent years. Come, my lad, give us the details of the story, for it must be worth the hearing if Ol\u0027 Burns played a leading part. He is as full of tricks as a dog of fleas.\" I repeated the story briefly, for I was now eager to be away before De Croix could dress and claim his ? 174 ? wager. I knew well the conceited coxcomb would never seek the presence of Mademoiselle until he had shed the rags he wore on entering the Fort. I remember yet that throng of faces, anxious yet amused, peering over each other\u0027s shoulders to get a better view of me as I talked, and constantly augmented as the word passed quickly about the garrison that we had safely returned from our midnight adventures. \"You will send aid to him?\" I questioned, as I concluded, my eyes fixed appealingly upon Captain Heald. \"Not I,\" was the prompt and decisive rejoinder. \"No soldier of this command shall leave the stockade until the hour for our final departure. The fellow had a chance to come in here with the others before the gates were closed, but was obstinate as a mule, and must now take the consequences. But you need not worry about Ol\u0027 Tom, my boy; he\u0027ll circumvent those red devils in some way, you may rest assured, nor would he even thank us for interference. I have no force with which to control the horde of savages that surround us here. A clash of arms would be their excuse for immediate attack, and might mean death and torture to the whole garrison. Our only hope lies in being permitted to pass out without armed collision; and to do this requires that we ignore such hidden deeds. \u0027Twas a mad prank of yours last night, and might have involved us all in common ruin. Go this ? 175 ? time free, except for these words of censure; for you are not directly under my orders. Another such attempt, subversive of all discipline, and the gates of Dearborn will be closed against you.\" These harsh expressions stung me, but I felt them in a measure merited, and made no reply. \"\u0027Twas but the act of a boy, Heald,\" interposed Wells kindly, resting his hand upon my shoulder, \"and you will find the lad well worth having when time of trial comes.\" I slipped away through an opening in the curious throng, and hastened across the open parade toward the mess-room. I felt dust-covered and bruised from my rough experiences, and hoped to discover opportunities for a bath. The building called the mess-room was long, running nearly half the length of the stockade, built like the others of logs, two stories in height, and containing a number of rooms. The single flight of stairs, opening just within the porch, was exceedingly rude, and built without any protecting rail. I hesitated a moment when fairly within the entrance, scarce knowing which way to turn in search of what I sought; but as I waited there, a light step sounded upon the bare floor above, and glancing up, with quickened beat of the heart, my eyes caught the soft drapery of a woman as she stepped on the upper stair. I could scarcely have retreated had I wished to do so, though I realized instantly who it was, and drew ? 176 ? back against the wall, so that she came down, singing lightly to herself, without noticing my presence until we were face to face. It was a picture to touch the heart of any man, and abide forever in the memory. I saw the sunlight as it streamed through an upper window along the rough log wall and flecked her white dress with ever-changing spots of quivering gold, and, as she drew nearer to my standing-place, played softly amid the masses of her dark-brown hair, giving it a tinge of glory. How daintily fair she was! how archly sweet looked the clear girlish face under the coquettish sweep of the broad hat! and with what unconscious grace she moved down the rude stairway, one white hand steadying her against the brown logs, the other gathering her draperies so close that I could not be blind to the daintily slippered foot that shyly peeped below the petticoat of ruffled silk. I may not have loved her then as I learned to do in later days, but my heart throbbed riotously at her presence, and I stood forgetful of all else. As she turned aside at the foot of the stairs, she saw me, and the color deserted her face, only to return instantly in deeper volume, while her tell-tale eyes hid themselves behind long lashes. \"And are you indeed returned, Master Wayland?\" she asked quickly, conquering her first emotion with a proud uplifting of her head. \"You surprised me greatly. I think I first mistook you for a ghost ? 177 ? come back to haunt me for having despatched you on so perilous a quest. You cannot know how I have been scolded for doing such a thing; yet surely you would have gone, even if I had failed to encourage it.\" \"Perhaps so, Mademoiselle,\" I answered, hoping I might lead her to speak with greater seriousness; \"but it was the hope of the reward that spurred me forward.\" \"Ah, of course,\" she said deliberately ignoring her own offer, and with a reckless toss of her head, \"you sought a fair girl for whose sake you have travelled far. Pray tell me, Monsieur,—I am so curious to know,—do you truly think Josette fairer than I?\" She spoke so lightly, smiling softly into my eyes, that I hardly detected the faint tinge of regretful sarcasm in her low voice. \"Josette, you ask me? Why, Josette is indeed a most charming girl, Mademoiselle; but to my mind there can be no comparison between her and you, for you are the fairest woman I have ever known.\" Her dark eyes were full upon me, and I saw her parted lips move as if she would speak. But no words came, and we stood there silent except for the nervous tapping of her foot against the floor. Her look of seriousness changed into a smile. \"By my faith, but you pay compliments with so grave a countenance, Monsieur, that I hardly know how to receive them. Most men whisper such things ? 178 ? with a light laugh, or a twinkle of the eye, and I know their words to be empty as bubbles of air. But you, why, you almost make me feel you are in earnest.\" \"And I am,\" I interrupted, longing to seize her hand as I knew De Croix would have done, and pour forth the words that burnt upon my lips. \"I have not been privileged to see much of the great outside world, Mademoiselle,—the world of courts and cities,—nor do I know how lovely its women may be; but no ideal formed in dreams satisfies me as you do. I know naught of idle compliments, nor the graces of a courtier; but my words are from the heart.\" \"I do truly believe and trust you, John Wayland,\" and she gave me her hand. \"But let us talk of this no longer. My vanity is already more than satisfied by your frank and honest speech. And so you found Josette?\" \"Yes,\" I answered, scarce noting what it was I said, so puzzled was I by her quick retreat. \"And that meeting, perchance, was so pleasant that it has taken your thought from all else? It must indeed be so, or why is it that Master Wayland doth not claim of me the stake of the wager?\" \"Because,\" I stammered, greatly embarrassed by her roguish questioning eyes, \"I fear it has not been fairly won.\" \"Not fairly won?\" she echoed, puzzled by my ? 179 ? tone and manner. \"Surely you have made the trip, and the terms were plain. Really, Monsieur, you do not think I would withhold so small a reward from the winner?\" \"But there was another,—the prize was destined for him who came back first.\" \"And has Captain de Croix returned also?\" \"We arrived together, Mademoiselle, but it was his good fortune to be earliest through the gate.\" \u0027Twas good to see how her face lit up with the amusement this reply afforded her. \"Pish! but you are in truth the most marvellous man I ever knew. \u0027Tis good to meet with such open honesty; and when did maid ever have before so unselfish a cavalier to do her honor? Monsieur, I greatly doubt if Captain de Croix will prove so thoughtful when his hour comes.\" \"You are right, Toinette,\" broke in a voice at my back. \"I know not what Master Wayland may be yielding up so easily, but, like the Shylock of your William Shakespeare, I am here to claim my pound of flesh.\" I wheeled and faced him, standing firmly between his approach and the girl, my blood instantly boiling at the familiar sound of that drawling voice. \"I have refused to accept from Mademoiselle what I had not fairly earned,\" I said, with quiet emphasis, \"and so, no doubt, will you.\" ? 180 ? There was that about my words and action that astonished him, and for the moment his old audacity was gone as he swept a puzzled glance over our faces. I have often reflected upon the contrast we must have presented to her sight as we stood there,—for De Croix had donned his best attire, and was once again resplendent in frills and ribbons, with heavily powdered hair. \"Oh, most certainly, what I have not earned,\" he said at length, \"but the kiss promised is surely mine by every right, as I was the first in.\" \"\u0027Twas done by a most scurvy trick.\" \"Poof! what of that? \u0027Tis the same whether the goal be won by wit and strategy, or mere fleetness of foot. Toinette will make no such fine distinction, I warrant you.\" \"Mademoiselle,\" and I turned toward the smiling girl, who seemingly enjoyed our interchange of compliments, \"what may have been your understanding of this wager?\" \"Why,\" she answered slowly, endeavoring to recall the details to mind, \"Captain de Croix declared he would willingly make the trip for a touch of rosy lips, and In a spirit of venture I promised that whichever of you two first completed the journey and returned here should obtain such reward.\" \"There, \u0027tis plain enough,\" he cried, stroking his mustache complacently, \"and I have won.\" ? 181 ? \"Most surely you have,\" I retorted, \"and the reward has already been given you.\" \"Been given?\" she questioned, \"and by whom?\" \"The girl Josette.\" She looked from the one to the other of us, puzzled for a brief moment at the odd situation. Then, as her eyes settled upon De Croix\u0027s flushed and angry face, she laughed gaily, even as she daintily drew aside her skirts to pass us by. \"Pish, Monsieur!\" she cried, shaking her finger at him, \"I doubt it not. No, you need not deny it, for \u0027tis but one of your old-time tricks, as I knew them well at Montreal. \u0027Twould be no more than right were I even now to reward Master Wayland, for he hath truly won it,—yet for that I will delay awhile.\" And with a flash of her dark eyes that held us speechless, she was gone.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87359.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
